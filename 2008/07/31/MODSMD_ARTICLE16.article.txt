## Stanford newcomers offer new impressions

DAILY VISITING INTERN
W inals are over, seniors have graduated and many
students, faculty and staff have packed their
112 bags for summer vacation. But the Stanford
campus, currently home to a diverse range of
JtL. summer programs, is anything but dead.
High-school students from various programs — includ
ing the Education Program for Gifted Youth (EPGY),
High School Summer College (HSSC), Junior Statesmen
of America (JSA) and Lead America — seem to have
taken over every corner of the campus. Unlike the few
academic-year students who are still around this summer,
most of these students arc complete newcomers to the
Stanford atmosphere. But just as they are new to Stanford,
Stanford is new to them — and there's plenty to see.
"The campus is so big," said JSA student Mia Wait,
noting — as many newcomers before her have learned —
the need for a bike.
Jessica Gonzales, also from JSA, agreed.
"I was amazed how gigantic the campus was; I almost
got lost," Gonzales said. "Libraries here arc so amazing,
too — one library has like three floors and there are about
20 libraries!"
In fact, the Stanford campus covers more than 8,000
acres and 23 libraries — an area that would take years for
anyone to cover.
But the colossal campus is not the only thing that
amazes campus newcomers: Stanford's architectural splen
dor catches anyone's eye.
"I fell in love with it," said HSSC student Chrystele
Kay.
"It was spectacular," added Rena Li, another HSSC
student living in Lagunita. "The architecture here is

amazing."
JSA's Sung Hee An was also enchanted by the
beauty of the campus.

"I really liked the campus because it natu
rally blends in with its landscape — like
flowers and trees. It's beautiful," she said.

As many noted, Stanford's natural
wonders add greatly to the many man
made structures.

"The campus is very pretty, lively and
green," said HSSC student Ivona
Pankova. "It's not a city, but it is pretti
er than a city, I think."

The size and charm of Stanford's
campus — with its California weather,
iridescent flowers, tropical trees and
palatial buildings — has appealed to
most of its summer visitors. Yet, the
appearance is only one of the numer
ous aspects of Stanford that have
attracted thousands of people here
every summer.
Shanthi Narla, a rising high-school
senior in HSSC, said that the diversity
of the Stanford community appealed to
her.

"I loved it," she said. "People
here are so nice, especially the
mentors. Everyone is so diverse

and accepting."
According to Narla, people
at Stanford know how to
appreciate diversity, while

neighbors back at her home in
Springfield, 111. are narrow-mind
ed and unwilling to accept cultur-

al differences.
As Narla and others have come to call Stanford home,
so have the many Stanford students before them. Once

naive freshmen themselves, academic-year students
remember their first impressions of Stanford to this day.
"It was a Garden of Eden," Marie Baylon '11
recalled, i felt like [1 was| going to school in a big

garden."
To Amy Kwon '10, however, ihe campus didn't
appear quite as Edenic. In fact, her first impression
was rather off-putting.
"Interestingly enough, my first impression of

Stanford was not all roses and peaches," she
wrote in an email to The Weekly. "1 thought it
was too manicured and perfect-looking to he real
— nothing like the raw vitality that I perceived in
Berkeley or back at home |inOregon|.
"However, Admit Weekend changed
that for me," she continued. "I loved the students
I met there and was amazed at how friendly and
easygoing people were."

As summer winds down, students from
the various programs will return to their
homes and schools, taking their impres-

sions of Stanford with them. Come
fall, returning students will take up

residence on campus once again,
along with a whole new batch

of incoming freshmen — and
first impressions.
