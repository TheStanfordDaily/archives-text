# Student groups get work – and fun – done in the summer sun

HI AIR LAING
Aside from all the obvious activity on campus this
summer — students doing research, taking classes
and participating in sports camps — some student
groups active during the year have continued to
function in the off-season. A few organizations
are able to operate with just a hardcore group of executives and
directors. Other groups have required full-staff activities in the
summer.
Dance Marathon (DM), which works to raise money for
Partners in Health, never slows down. While most DM volun
teers are away, its directors and executives are still hard at
work in the summer, according to director Laura Ha '10.
"We're trying to develop good relationships with the com
munity and we're working on further solidifying our relation
ship with Face Aids," Ha said.
The group is also working on budgeting and staff develop
ment, and talking to local nonprofits about serving as sec
ondary beneficiaries of DM's fundraising efforts. And natural
ly, they're preparing for the arrival of the freshmen in
September and a fresh new class of volunteers.
One director, Jessie Liu '09, has even gone to Rwanda and
visited one of Partners in Health's clinics.
"I was completely astounded with the work they've been
able to accomplish here," Liu said. She's looking forward to
sharing what she has learned with her Stanford classmates.
Dance Marathon isn't the only student group whose staff is
hard at work this summer, even from off-campus. Students for
Choice, a group interested in promoting responsible sexual and

reproductive freedom, is also working to promote its goals and
get prepared for the fall.
Students for Choice is particularly concerned about the
price of birth control pills. At Vaden, the price went from $10
to $19 due to a change in national policy affecting pharmaceu
tical companies.
According to Meryl Holt '09, Students for Choice has
already acted on the issue by advocating for an ASSU senate
resolution on birth control, which passed at the end of the
school year. Currently, the group is "starting talks with the
ASSU executives to move on this issue in the fall," Holt said.
Students for Choice hopes "to find a way to provide support
for women who are having trouble affording the Pill," she
added. The group plans either to tap into University resources
or to establish a separate endowment for reproductive health
to meet the needs of struggling women.
While both these groups are able to work in the summer
with just a few dedicated members on campus or elsewhere,
some groups require students to be on campus for the summer.
One of these groups, Stanford College Prep (formerly known
as Upward Bound) works with first-generation college hope
fuls as they take classes at Stanford during the summer.
According to Sarah Ohr '09, the students come and take
classes on campus during a five-week program. High school
juniors and seniors also take an SAT prep class. 1 utors with
Stanford College Prep help the kids during study hall Monday
through Thursday and make sure that the kids understand their
classes and are getting their work done. Stanford College Prep
is also active during the school year.
Another student group with active members on campus is
the Stanford Project on Hunger (SPOON). According to

Tommy Tobin '10, SPOON co-director and the director of
summer SPOON, the organization has about 25 active volun
teers in the area during the summer, ranging from high-school
students to undergraduate and graduate students.
During the summer, the volunteers collect unused and
unserved food from various dining halls and campus eateries
and give the food to the Opportunity Center in Palo Alto.
Volunteers have already collected over 1500 pounds and hope
to collect over 2000 pounds of food before the end of the sum
mer. SPOON is active during the school year as well, and this
is its first year operating a summer program.
"Even though students do, hunger doesn't take a break,"
Tobin said.
On the lighter side, the Band is always around to provide a
little on-campus entertainment. Rehearsals are every Monday
at 7 p.m. — open to anyone interested in showing up and trying
out an instrument.
In addition to rehearsals, the Band has had numerous per
formances, including weddings, the Fourth of July parade in
Redwood City, ESPN's Title Town USA shoot en J the AIDS
walk in San Francisco. Soon, members will be performing at
Stanford Sierra Camp, as they do every summer.
The Band is also starting to plan field shows for this football
season. And, as is tradition, the Stanford Tree is starting to cre
ate the new tree costume, which shall be unveiled at All
Campus Rally, more commonly known as Band Run, in the fall.
So while summer on campus may seem quiet compared to
the school year, there is always something going on for the stu
dent who likes to stay involved.
