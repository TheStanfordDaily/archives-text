## STANFORD FOOTBALL Fall Camp features QB battle Intrigue abounds on Card roster heading into Harbaugh's second year 
### DENIS GRIFFIN SPORTS EDITOR 
With some of the amazing highlights
Stanford football racked up last season,
including victories over USC and Cal, it is
somewhat remarkable that the threshold
of the 20()8 season is so far devoid of
much in the way of buzz.
No, rather than excitement at the
prospect of another season of shocking
upsets, dramatic highs and fewer lows
than Stanford fans had become used to,
instead there is a cautious optimism that
perhaps the Cardinal could take the next
step: Become a bit more of a stable pro
gram. Show that last year wasn't a fluke.
Defeat more than three Pac-10 oppo
nents.
But make no mistake, that is progress.
Remarkably, one year after Jim
Harbaugh's first season on the Farm, no
longer is the hope of most Stanford fans
that the team can merely avoid embar
rassment, but that it can rise to the level
of a respectable Pac-10 contender. And if
these and others of what once were con
sidered to be lofty goals are to be
achieved in the 2008 season, the founda
tions will need to be strengthened in Fall
Camp, opening tomorrow, where
Harbaugh will fill in his depth chart as
some players emerge and others fall.

Highlighting the practices will be the
search for a starting quarterback, but
plenty of other spots in the opening game
lineup against Oregon State are up for
grabs as well. The following is a run-down
of what to watch for as camp gets under
way:
Quarterback quandary: Despite return
ing rising senior Tavita Pritchard, who
started seven games in 2(X)7, the starting
quarterback job in '08 for the Cardinal
appears to be very much in the air. At the
Pac-10 media day last week, Harbaugh
told the San Jose Mercury News that he
hoped to have a starter at the position in
place by the eighth or ninth practice, but
also made clear that he is excited about
the Cardinal's prospects at the position.
"We have three quarterbacks we feel
we can win with," the second-year
Stanford coach said at the podium. "I will
tell you right now, I bet we could win with
all three of them. It will be a heated com
petition. The neat thing about watching
them compete in the spring is that the
guys see it and the coaches can feel it.
Every single snap is important to them.
All three of them want to be the starting
quarterback. It is truly the best thing for
our football team to have that competi
tion."
The three quarterbacks vying for the
job are Pritchard; rising junior Alex
Loukas from Bannockburn, 111., who has
yet to play a down of Pac-10 football but
has impressed coaches this offseason; and
Jason Forcier, who transferred to
Stanford prior to the start of last season as
a junior from Michigan. Highly touted
true-freshman Andrew Luck figures to be

a bystander in this year's clash for the
starting job, but could play a big role in
the team's plans for the position down the
road.
O-line shuffle: With the departure of last
year's senior starter Tim Mattran, rising
senior Alex Fletcher has shifted to center
from his traditional place at right guard.
Fletcher paired with rising senior Chris
Marinelli on the right side of the line last
season and the return of both should give
the Cardinal a measure of stability up
front.
On the left side, senior tackle Allen
Smith was already looking to return from
a torn patella tendon suffered against
Oregon last season before breaking his
kneecap in the offseason. However ques
tionable his return this year may be,
Stanford coaches are confident that fel
low senior Ben Muth can fill in and be
successful at tackle. But the team's two
starting spots at guard appear to be much
more unsettled.
As Fletcher said at the Pac-10 media
day, perhaps the Cardinal's chief advan
tage up front on offense will be the
group's experience and cohesiveness as a
unit.
"In terms of the offensive line, when 1
came in we were the weakness of the
team and now we are finally the
strength," he said. "A lot of guys had to
develop and get better. That is one of the
best places to have strength, but you are
one out of five and you are only as good
as the guy next to you."
Defensive adjustments: The Cardinal

Despite starting seven games last season for the Cardinal, includ

Pritchard will have to fend off two rivals for the QB job this season.
defense will be returning plenty of its
headliners from the '07 season, with
names like (defensive end) Pannel
Egboh, (safety) Bo McNally and
(linebacker) Clinton Snyder, all of
whom are rising seniors. Among the
other names of note is rising sopho
more defensive tackle Sione Fua, who
was looking dominant in spring prac
tices in 2007 before missing last season
to go on his LDS mission.
Indeed, the major turnover on the
defensive side of the ball comes in the
coaching ranks as last season's coordi
nator Scott Shafcr left in January to
accept the same job at Michigan under
new head coach Rich Rodriguez.
Shafer, who did a tremendous job
putting some teeth into a Stanford
defense that recorded 50 turnovers
and 37 sacks, will be replaced by co
defensive coordinators Andy Buh,

who coached Stanford's linebackers
last season, and Ron Lynn, who brings
38 years of coaching experience to the
Stanford squad. Lynn's coaching
career has been highlighted by stints as
a defensive coordinator with the San
Diego Chargers (1986-91), Cincinnati
Bengals (1992-93) and Washington
Redskins (1994-96).
Stacked backficld? Despite rising
junior Tyrone McGraw's decision to
drop off the squad, the Cardinal nev
ertheless will return plenty of runners
with experience who would all love to
be the featured back this season,
behind the bruising blocking of rising
sophomore fullback Owen Marecic.
The problem is that in the past most of
them have faced significant health
issues that have limited their produc
tivity.
The two biggest names at running
back for the Cardinal are rising
junior Toby Gerhart and redshirt
senior Anthony Kimble. Prior to last
season, Kimble had been viewed as a
fast outside threat who could be com
plemented by the punishing inside

style of Gerhart. But both players
clearly worked on rounding out their
games, as Gerhart displayed plenty
of flash against San Jose State in the
second game of the '07 season, gain
ing 141 yards on 12 carries, before
being lost for the season with a knee
injury. In Gerhart's absence, Kimble
became a more complete threat,
despite only seeing action in seven
contests due to injury.
Stanford would clearly be thrilled
if one or both could manage to put
together a complete season in 2008. If,
however, injuries continue to hound
the pair, shifty rising sophomore
Jeremy Stewart, along with a host of
lesser-knowns, could have to carry the
load.
Key departurcs:Aside from plenty of
graduated seniors, like quarterback
TC Ostrander, wide receivers Evan
Moore and Mark Bradford, Mattran
and defensive backs Tim Sims and
Nick Sanchez, the Cardinal will have
to deal with several more unforeseen
absences in 2008. McGraw and rising
sophomore Kellen Kiilsgaard both

chose to drop football, in Kiilsgaard's
case so he could focus exclusively on
playing baseball for Stanford.
Kiilsgaard arrived on the Farm as a
highly touted quarterback recruit, but
Harbaugh's plans to go with more
pro-style players led to the freshman
frequently changing positions in his
first season.
Further depleting the Cardinal ros
ter are the suspensions of tight end
Ben Ladner and receiver and punt
returner Chris Hobbs, both rising
seniors. Harbaugh confirmed with the
Mercury News last week that, while
both players will still receive scholar
ships, neither will "be a part of the
team" in the 2008 season.
Practices start tomorrow at Elliot
Field just outside of Maples Pavilion
and are open to the public. Stanford's
first game of the 2008 season will be a
Pac-10 matchup at home against
Oregon State on Aug. 28 at 6 p.m.
