# The 						many feces of Manny
## 
### 
It makes sense. It's not hard to
understand why Theo Epstein
is trying to shop Manny
Ramirez. It's understandable that
the Red Sox have gotten sick of
"Manny being Manny."
With the trade deadline
approaching today at 4 p.m. EST,
it has recently been reported that
the Red Sox are seriously consid
ering trading the future Hall of
Famer. The most substantial
rumor suggests that Ramirez
could he sent to Florida for a
young hitter, perhaps Jeremy
Hermida or Josh Willingham.
The flurry of speculation about
a possible trade gained speed
when Ramirez pulled himself out
of the lineup for Friday's show
down with the Yankees and Joba
Chamberlain. Ramirez supposed
ly had a sore knee, but MRl's on
both knees came back negative.
Then, Manny threw some fuel
on the fire in a way that only he
could. On Sunday the slugger told
ESPNde~>ortes,"l don't care
where I play, I can even play in
Iraq if need be.'
The Red Sox must feel like
parents paying thousands in

Duane

tuition for a child who couldn't
care less. Manny is making $20
million this year, yet he has no
problem announcing to the world
that "the Red Sox don't deserve a
player like [him]."
Manny is frustrated because
the Sox haven't exercised their
club option to bring him back for
another $20 million next year. It is
team policy not to discuss con
tracts during the season, but
unsurprisingly Manny wants
Epstein to make an exception.
Dealing with situations like
this must be laid out in the MLB
CM manual. Overpaid star acts
out. Team gets fed up. Team
trades star. Everyone is better off.
But what Theo Epstein and all
the supporters of a trade are for
getting is who they arc dealing
with.
Besides being a 12-time All-
Star and a member of the 500
home run club, Manny combines
off-field insanity with on-field
accomplishment like no other
American athlete. He high-fives

fans in between a catch and a
throw. He talks on cell phones
during pitching changes. He flips
his helmet into the air when he
rounds third base. He doesn't
hustle, and he doesn't really care.
Last October, when his Red
Sox were down three games to
one against the Cleveland Indians
in the ALCS, Ramirez admitted
that losing the series "wouldn't be
the end of the world." Hut his
stats don't reflect his verbalized
lack of commitment. His .299
average and 20 homers already
this year have kept the Sox lineup
afloat through injuries and
slumps. His presence in the
Boston lineup forces pitchers to
throw strikes to David Ortiz. His
.400 OBP gives Mike Lowell tons
of RBI opportunities. In short,
Ramirez is irreplaceable.
The Red Sox have come
mighty close to getting rid of their
dreadlocked right fielder in the
past, but their faith has always
been rewarded. Boston publicly
dangled Ramirez as trade bait
before the 2004 season. Manny
responded by driving in 130 runs
and being named the MVP of the
2004 World Series. In '05, the Red
Sox were sick of Manny's antics and
tried to trade him before the July 31
deadline. Epstein couldn't work out
a deal and Manny responded with

the game-winning hit for the Red
Sox that night.
So 1 warn you, Theo Epstein and
John Henry: Don't trade Manny!
He's too special. He's too good.
Yesterday the Yankees acquired
Pudge Rodriguez. You're trailing
the Rays by three games. There is
no room in the tight AL East race to
let feelings get in the way of win
ning.
Sure, a trade would make things
run a little bit smoother for Red Sox

Nation. Traveling secretary Jack
McCormick wouldn't have to worry
about being pushed to the ground.
Manager Terry Francona could set
the lineup without it being subject to
the whims of Manny's knee.
Life would be easier, but without
Manny, the Red Sox can forget
about defending their World Series
title. Terry Francona has made pub
lic his opinion on the matter:
"I'd take a guy that's hitting .500
that's miserable as opposed to a guy

that hands out bouquets to his team
mates and is hitting a buck-forty
five."
So Theo, throw out the manual
and put down the phone â€” because
without Manny being Manny at
Fenway Park, October will be foot
ball season in New England.
