Dunn named to replace
cross country legend on
the Farm

Edrick Floreal, the director of Track
& Field at Stanford, announced on
Tuesday the hiring of Jason Dunn as
the Stanford cross country head coach.
The position opened when former
coach Peter Tegan retired in May after
44 years of coaching experience in
which athletes he coached racked up 44
individual national titles and 302 All-
American honors. His teams won 45
conference titles and he was named
National Cross Country Coach of the
Year five times.
The coach replacing the legend,
Dunn, most recently coached at
Virginia. He was last year's Men's
ACC Cross Country Coach of the Year
and led both Virginia's men's and
women's cross country teams to the
NCAA Championships last season,
Dunn has also demonstrated a com
mitment to academics over his career.
His men's and women's teams have
both been named All-Academic
squads in each of the last five years.

Twenty-two of his athletes have
achieved individual All-Academic sta
tus.
The Stanford women's cross coun
try team is coming off a third consecu
tive NCAA title, hut will have to deal
with the graduation of senior leader
Arianna Lambie, who placed ninth at
the NCAA championship and was
named the Pac-10 Woman of the Year
in June.
Prior to coaching at Virginia, Dunn
was an assistant at his alma mater,
William and Mary, and Arizona State.

Stanford rowers make a
splash at FISA World
Championships
Stanford rower Erika Roddy, a
rising sophomore, helped make his
tory on Sunday as the U.S. Junior
Women's Eight won the 2008 FISA
World Rowing Senior Championship
for the first time.
The U.S. squad was in third place
behind Germany and Romania at the
500-meter mark, but the U.S. slowly
made up ground. The American crew
overtook the Romanians at the 1,750
mark and ended up winning by a
mere 2.05 seconds.
Roddy's contributions to the U.S.
victory adds to an already impressive
tally of Stanford rowers' achieve
ments this summer, as rising senior
Alex Osborne, Silas Stafford '08 and
Jessi Reel '08 each brought home
gold a week ago at the FISA World
Rowing Under-23 Championships,
with Stafford and Osborne also
members of the U.S. Men's Eight
and Reel rowing with the US
Women's Eight. Rounding out the
Stanford rowers' achievements was
Steph Morrison, '08, who helped the
Canadian Under-23 team finish
fourth.
