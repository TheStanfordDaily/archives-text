## Kim shines at Ohio tourney, finishes sixth 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK 
Commencing last Thursday and conclud
ing this past Sunday, the Nationwide
Children's Hospital Invitational in
Columbus, Ohio was an event packed with
plenty of excitement.
Sihwan Kim '08 recorded the best finish
of the seven All-American sponsor invitees
with a tie for sixth in his first professional
event. After an even-par front nine, Kim
birdied the 10th hole and made eagle at the
12th when he knocked in a 25-foot chip shot
from just off the green. A bogey at No. 13
dropped him back to two under, where he
eventually finished.
Kim, a native of South Korea who arrived
in the U.S. in 2000, was the second Stanford
freshman to be named a first-team All-
American — the first being Tiger Woods.
"I tried really hard to prepare for college
golf because I saw a lot of guys fading away
after they get into college," Kim told
GoStanford.com. "I learned from Coach
(Conrad) Ray, who used to play on the
Nationwide Tour, about game management
and the mental game also."
Kim's success at the event, though, was
somewhat overshadowed by Bill Lundc's tri
umphant return at the Invitational. After
taking a break from golf in 2006, Lunde
returned to the sport he loved and became a
first-time event winner on Sunday on the
Nationwide Tour. He topped Dustin Bray by
just one stroke at the Invitational.
Lunde shot 67-22-67-73 for a cumulative
score of 279 on Sunday — a five-under-par
total. The $135,000 check he received follow
ing the event jumped him to seventh on the
money list and almost assured him of a PGA
Tour card for next season. Bray's final-round
69 earned him a runner-up finish and a start

at next week's Cox Classic in Omaha. More
significantly, Bray advanced 105 spots on the
money list to 45th.
Lunde started unsteadily with a double
bogey at the second hole, but gained
momentum with birdies at holes four and 12,
both par fives. Two later bogeys at the 15th
and 16th holes seemed to have killed his
chances.
Needing a birdie at the final hole to claim
victory — Bray already in the clubhouse at
four-under-par 280 — Lunde hit his 150-yard
approach to the final hole just off the left
side of the green. As Lunde chipped in from
30 feet, the crowd was sent into a frenzy.
Following Bray were three players,
Tommy Tolles, Skip Kendall and Brendon
De Jonge, who all tied for third with three
under-par scores at 281. Six other players
shared the sixth position with Kim, includ
ing Josh Broadaway, who has five top-10
finishes and 18 top-25 finishes in his three
year professional career on the Nationwide
Tour.
Bray was the 10th alternate before the
tournament began and considered going to a
Tar Heel Tour event, but when he discov
ered he had forgotten to register for that
event he came to Columbus instead. A poor
tee shot at the par-three 17th hole led to his
first bogey of the day. When he missed a 12-
footer on the last for birdie, the fireworks
happened. Lunde captured the victory.
"Call it fate or whatever you like," said
Bray to PGA Tour staff. "I'm not going to
say that I've had a lot of bad breaks in the
last year and a half, but I was just looking for
that good bounce, and I felt like getting into
this event was my good bounce."
