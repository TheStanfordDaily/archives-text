## LOCAL EATS CRAVING TART AND TANGY? Yogurt joints keep customers cool with frozen treats, toppings galore 
### LYDIA CHOW SHELLY HORWITZ DAILY VISITING INTERNS 
RED MANGO I 429 University Ave., Palo
Alto I Sun-Thu 11 a.m. to 11:30 p.m., Fri & Sat
11 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.
The latest frozen yogurt shop to open in
downtown Palo Alto, Red Mango offers a sim
plistic but nevertheless satisfying experience.
Owned by Stanford alum and Survivor winner
Yul Kwon '97, Red Mango greets customers
with upbeat music and chic red and white
decor. Service is friendly and efficient, with an
effective ordering system. Red Mango offers
two yogurt flavors, original and green tea,
both of which are creamy in texture. The taste
is not excessively saccharine, but tart and sub
tly sweet. Toppings, which are categorized into
fruit and dry, begin at $1; for each additional
topping, another 25 cents are added. A
refreshing variety of fruit is offered, such as
mango and watermelon. Dry toppings are just
as diverse, including Ghirardelli dark choco
late, mochi and Bear Naked granola. Servings
come in three sizes: small ($2.95), medium
($3.95) and large ($6.45) for original flavor.
Green tea costs $1 more. Frozen Yogurt
Blenders (smoothie blends of yogurt and three
toppings) are also available in two sizes: regu
lar ($4.95) and large ($5.95) in original flavor.
FRAICHE I 644 Emerson St., Suite 110, Palo
Alto I Mon-Thu 7 a.m. to 10:30 p.m., Fri 7 a.m.
to 11 p.m., Sat 9 a.m. to 11 p.m., Sun 9 a.m. to
10:30 p.m.
Located on Emerson Street in downtown
Palo Alto, Fraiche delivers a healthy variety of
homemade, organic European-style yogurt in
a friendly, bustling atmosphere. Slightly small
er and more crowded than Red Mango,
Fraiche offers a wider range of yogurts, includ
ing fresh yogurt (whole milk, 2 percent milk,
nonfat) and frozen yogurt (natural, valrhona
chocolate, soy). The toppings arc just as
diverse, categorized into fruit, crunch and spe
cialty, the latter featuring unique toppings
such as raspberry puree and local honeys. The
star of Fraiche, however, is its homemade
mochi ball topping. The natural frozen yogurt
flavor tastes slightly sweeter than Red
Mango's original flavor, while the sweetness of
the valrhona chocolate balances well with
crunch toppings. Sizes include junior ($2.95),
regular ($3.95) and large ($5.25) and the
yogurt is also available for take-home in a pint
($6.95) or a quart ($12.95). Fraiche also offers
a healthy assortment of handmade baked
goods and Blue Bottle organic coffee.
YUMI YOGURT I 947 El Camino Real,
Redwood City I 10 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.
As most Stanford students know, Yumi
Yogurt is essentially Dairy Queen's smaller,

dingier-yet-tastier cousin. The shop's motif is a
pair of bright red lips, and the decor is neon
and linoleum. But the yogurt is delicious and
comes in three sizes: small ($3.75), medium
($4) and large ($4.55). Flavors like tiramisu,
German chocolate cake and southern straw
berry (Yumi definitely specializes in sweet,
rather than tart, tastes) are creamy, and come
in very generous servings. A small is almost
too large to finish, and definitely big enough to
share. A warning, though: Lines can form
quickly and the store is tiny. There's barely
room for three tables, each for two people,
max. You're better off eating your yogurt out
side. The staff is usually curt, and their service
is mediocre at best.
YOGURT STOP I 401 El Camino Real,
Menlo Park I Mon-Sat 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Sun
12 p.m. to 10 p.m.
Yogurt Stop's flavors are mostly sweet and
fun — dulce de leche, cookies and cream,
Georgia Peach — with organic, tart yogurt
offered occasionally. A few of the flavors can be
a bit too sweet, but the texture is consistently
smooth. Sizes range from small ($3.75) to large
($4.50). Any yogurt can be spiced up with one
or more of the several topping options (priced
at an additional $1.10 each), which include
chocolate chips, carob chips, both chocolate
and rainbow sprinkles and crumbled cookie
bits. One flavor to look for in particular is the
French Vanilla Custard, a custard-frozen
yogurt combo. Yogurt Stop also serves gelato,
smoothies and coffee. Be sure to go to the
ATM beforehand, though — as the seasoned
customer knows, the place only accepts cash.
ICE BEE I 829 Mission Street, San Francisco
I Mon-Thur 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Fri & Sat 11
a.m. to 12 a.m., Sun 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Its name says it all: "Ice Bee, freestyle
swirling" delivers all the flavors and options of
a typical yogurt joint, but in a buffet-style for
mat. Customers can choose from several fla
vor options, mostly tart, and a plethora of top
pings like mochi, fruit, sprinkles and nuts.

Personalized yogurt and toppings ensure that
the customer never i'cels cheated, and at 43
cents per ounce, the price of a custom cup usu
ally beats competitors' anyway. Though the
interior is small, seating is modern and com
fortable. Located just a block from the San
Francisco Metreon, Ice Bee is a perfect post
movie stop before heading home.
FROZO'S I 1000 Lafayette Street, Santa
Clara I Mon-Thu, Sun 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Fri &
Sat 11 a.m. to 12 a.m.
A popular hangout among Santa Clara stu
dents, Frozo's frozen yogurt offers more

yogurt and topping options than its competi
tors. With more than half a dozen rotating
yogurt flavors, and over 60 toppings from
candy to fruit to syrups, Frozo's selection can
be somewhat intimidating. Customers can
choose from sweet or tart yogurts in flavors
like pistachio, cookies n' cream, Golden Gate
chocolate or Funilla, and add toppings as they
see fit. With all the topping options, it's tempt
ing to mix flavors that don't match, though at
only 39 cents per ounce, Frozo's is cheap
enough for experimentation.

too large to finish, and definitely big enough to
share. A warning, though: Lines can form
quickly and the store is tiny. There's barely
room for three tables, each for two people,
max. You're better off eating your yogurt out
side. The staff is usually curt, and their service
is mediocre at best.
YOGURT STOP I 401 El Camino Real,
Menlo Park I Mon-Sat 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Sun
12 p.m. to 10 p.m.
Yogurt Stop's flavors are mostly sweet and
fun — dulce de leche, cookies and cream,
Georgia Peach — with organic, tart yogurt
offered occasionally. A few of the flavors can be
a bit too sweet, but the texture is consistently
smooth. Sizes range from small ($3.75) to large
($4.50). Any yogurt can be spiced up with one
or more of the several topping options (priced
at an additional $1.10 each), which include
chocolate chips, carob chips, both chocolate
and rainbow sprinkles and crumbled cookie
bits. One flavor to look for in particular is the
French Vanilla Custard, a custard-frozen
yogurt combo. Yogurt Stop also serves gelato,
smoothies and coffee. Be sure to go to the
ATM beforehand, though — as the seasoned
customer knows, the place only accepts cash.
ICE BEE I 829 Mission Street, San Francisco
I Mon-Thur 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Fri & Sat 11
a.m. to 12 a.m., Sun 11 a.m. to 9 p.m.
Its name says it all: "Ice Bee, freestyle
swirling" delivers all the flavors and options of
a typical yogurt joint, but in a buffet-style for
mat. Customers can choose from several fla
vor options, mostly tart, and a plethora of top
pings like mochi, fruit, sprinkles and nuts.

Personalized yogurt and toppings ensure that
the customer never i'cels cheated, and at 43
cents per ounce, the price of a custom cup usu
ally beats competitors' anyway. Though the
interior is small, seating is modern and com
fortable. Located just a block from the San
Francisco Metreon, Ice Bee is a perfect post
movie stop before heading home.
FROZO'S I 1000 Lafayette Street, Santa
Clara I Mon-Thu, Sun 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., Fri &
Sat 11 a.m. to 12 a.m.
A popular hangout among Santa Clara stu
dents, Frozo's frozen yogurt offers more

yogurt and topping options than its competi
tors. With more than half a dozen rotating
yogurt flavors, and over 60 toppings from
candy to fruit to syrups, Frozo's selection can
be somewhat intimidating. Customers can
choose from sweet or tart yogurts in flavors
like pistachio, cookies n' cream, Golden Gate
chocolate or Funilla, and add toppings as they
see fit. With all the topping options, it's tempt
ing to mix flavors that don't match, though at
only 39 cents per ounce, Frozo's is cheap
enough for experimentation.

RAINBOW SPRINKLES: An employee loads fresh fruit onto an "original" flavored yogurt at
Red Mango on University Ave. Opened by Survivor Winner and Stanford alum Yul Kwon '97 just
a few months ago, the shop is one of many yogurt vendors popping up around the Bay Area.
RED MANGO I 429 University Ave., Palo
Alto I Sun-Thu 11 a.m. to 11:30 p.m., Fri & Sat
11 a.m. to 12:30 a.m.
The latest frozen yogurt shop to open in
downtown Palo Alto, Red Mango offers a sim
plistic but nevertheless satisfying experience.
Owned by Stanford alum and Survivor winner
Yul Kwon '97, Red Mango greets customers
with upbeat music and chic red and white
decor. Service is friendly and efficient, with an
effective ordering system. Red Mango offers
two yogurt flavors, original and green tea,
both of which are creamy in texture. The taste
is not excessively saccharine, but tart and sub
tly sweet. Toppings, which are categorized into
fruit and dry, begin at $1; for each additional
topping, another 25 cents are added. A
refreshing variety of fruit is offered, such as
mango and watermelon. Dry toppings are just
as diverse, including Ghirardelli dark choco
late, mochi and Bear Naked granola. Servings
come in three sizes: small ($2.95), medium
($3.95) and large ($6.45) for original flavor.
Green tea costs $1 more. Frozen Yogurt
Blenders (smoothie blends of yogurt and three
toppings) are also available in two sizes: regu
lar ($4.95) and large ($5.95) in original flavor.
FRAICHE I 644 Emerson St., Suite 110, Palo
Alto I Mon-Thu 7 a.m. to 10:30 p.m., Fri 7 a.m.
to 11 p.m., Sat 9 a.m. to 11 p.m., Sun 9 a.m. to
10:30 p.m.
Located on Emerson Street in downtown
Palo Alto, Fraiche delivers a healthy variety of
homemade, organic European-style yogurt in
a friendly, bustling atmosphere. Slightly small
er and more crowded than Red Mango,
Fraiche offers a wider range of yogurts, includ
ing fresh yogurt (whole milk, 2 percent milk,
nonfat) and frozen yogurt (natural, valrhona
chocolate, soy). The toppings arc just as
diverse, categorized into fruit, crunch and spe
cialty, the latter featuring unique toppings
such as raspberry puree and local honeys. The
star of Fraiche, however, is its homemade
mochi ball topping. The natural frozen yogurt
flavor tastes slightly sweeter than Red
Mango's original flavor, while the sweetness of
the valrhona chocolate balances well with
crunch toppings. Sizes include junior ($2.95),
regular ($3.95) and large ($5.25) and the
yogurt is also available for take-home in a pint
($6.95) or a quart ($12.95). Fraiche also offers
a healthy assortment of handmade baked
goods and Blue Bottle organic coffee.
YUMI YOGURT I 947 El Camino Real,
Redwood City I 10 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.
As most Stanford students know, Yumi
Yogurt is essentially Dairy Queen's smaller,

dingier-yet-tastier cousin. The shop's motif is a
pair of bright red lips, and the decor is neon
and linoleum. But the yogurt is delicious and
comes in three sizes: small ($3.75), medium
($4) and large ($4.55). Flavors like tiramisu,
German chocolate cake and southern straw
berry (Yumi definitely specializes in sweet,
rather than tart, tastes) are creamy, and come
in very generous servings. A small is almost
too large to finish, and definitely big enough to
share. A warning, though: Lines can form
quickly and the store is tiny. There's barely
room for three tables, each for two people,
max. You're better off eating your yogurt out
side. The staff is usually curt, and their service
is mediocre at best.
