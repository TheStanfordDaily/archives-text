# ON STAGE
## Summer Theater moves into second act 
### SHELLY RONEN 
The silence gives way to flashes of bold storytelling as Frank
Hardy (Andrew Robinson), his desperate wife Grace (Courtney
Walsh Phleger) and their charming manager, Teddy (Jeffrey Bilir),
gently wander onto the Pigott theater stage. The lights go down and
give way to Stanford Summer Theater's second show of the season,
Brian Friers "Faith Healer," a play composed of four confronta
tional monologues. Mesmerizing and unrelenting, neither the actors
nor the audience receive room to breathe. The play is a grueling
experience: The actors put out an immense amount of hungry ener
gy, which begs the audience to reciprocate.
Drawing the audience into a beautiful commentary on the nature
of faith and the power of hope, the three storytellers reflect on their
attachments to the masterful performance act of faith healing.
Though the general frame of the story seems clear, the audience can
not feel confident in its sources of information. The three characters
travel to various outposts around the British Isles, dealing with rev
elation and self-deception while struggling with unsure finances and
transportation. It is upon these unstable grounds that we bear wit
ness to their attempts to relate to one another. The audience cannot
necessarily trust its storytellers, but must face the conflicts between
their accounts.
Firmly rooted in their cultural situation, the players neverthe
less manage to achieve universally translatable characters.
Robinson grapples with his challenging part, tempering cruel
power with vulnerable dependence upon his ailing patronage. His
product is wild and alluring and his focus seems to look past and
through the audience.
Phleger at times barks out of victimization, yet at other times her
language lilts gently as it is released from her brooding body. Bihr's
connection with the audience is unparalleled, while his intuitive tim
ing and physical sass relates us to the space in which the story comes
alive.
At its best, the play breaks free of the literal narrative and the
characters echo one another in a quaint, eerie way that betrays the
playwright's talent for human portraiture. Director Rush Rehm,
professor of drama and classics, says he hopes that audiences "will
give themselves over to it." Indeed, the monologues demand con
centration â€” even if the audience is unwilling in the task.
The set is an invitation for audience members to involve them
selves; rows of chairs on stage seem to continue from the seats into
the theater itself. A shabby red curtain hangs in the back, giving the
impression that the action takes place in front of the intended stage.
Though this play may not be everyone's cup of tea, it is certainly
a testament to the theatrical challenges of portraying the complex
relationship of love and art. The script may gently pummel at you,
and you may tire of the tension in the air throughout, but when the
lights come back up, you feel cheated; you have been robbed of

potential moments in which to believe in the healing, and to share in
these characters' questioning faith that moments of elation make the
cruel failures worthwhile.
Faith Healer opens today and runs through August 17 at Pigott
Theater. For tickets, showtimes and other information visit
