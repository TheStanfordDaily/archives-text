## Port O'Brian charts unexplored waters 
### PAUL CRAFT 
Indie rock has an obsession with the sea.
Pinback, Modest Mouse and The
Decemberists have all released music with a
nautical theme. None of these bands,
though, have a genuine claim to the theme.
When was the last time Colin Meloy actual
ly met an old mariner seeking revenge? Or
Isaac Brock experienced a shipwreck?
One indie band, however, does have a
genuine claim to sea-faring imagery: the
Oakland-based group Port O'Brien. The
quintet released their new album, "All We
Could Do Was Sing" this past May to little
fanfare, but has gradually gained more buzz.
Every summer growing up, Port
O'Brien's founder, Van Pierszalowski,
worked on a fishing boat with his father near
Kodiak Island, Alaska. (The band's name
sake is a port on the island.) Pierszalowski's
lyrics grapple with the hard lifestyle chosen
by his father and passed down to him. It is a
peek into the mind of a young man con

fronting both his love and hatred of the cold,
lonely life of a fisherman. Like a Greek trag
ic hero, he longs to be something else, but
ultimately decides that he has been born to
follow his father.
Even with some very personal themes,
Port O'Brien manages to be emotionally
cathartic without being melodramatic.
Personal questions are yelped out over a
rickety bed of guitars and drums that com
bine country rock with indie rock. The
instruments create a rootsy wall of sound:
chiming major chords, noodling guitar solos
and seesaw beats. There is, not surprisingly,
a hint of the sea shanty style: unpolished
group sing-a-longs and drunken, otf-kilter
melodies. M. Ward, the reigning king of
messy roots rock, even named Port O'Brien
as his favorite new band.
The album gets off to an upbeat start
with, "I Woke Up Today." Reminiscent of
their musical peer Akron/Family, the track
is a group sing-along undergirded by a repet
itive acoustic riff and stomping rhythm. The
main refrain declares the down-to-earth per
spective of Pierszalowski's music: "I woke
up today/In a very simple way/In the morn
ing/All I could I do was sing." It is this streak
of genuine humility that makes Port O'Brien
so fresh. In "Fisherman's Son," for instance,
Pierszalowski mournfully contemplates his

upbringing and his future: "I'm doing fine in
the city/I don't miss the stars ... (But) lam
a fisherman's son/And that is what I will
become."
The album often lingers in moody bal
ladry, but also manages to turn up the tempo.
There is a desperate energy running through
the music that will appeal to any Arcade Fire
or Wolf Parade fan. The band best channels
this energy during their faster tracks.
"Pigeonhold" is a jerky electric guitar-dri
ven cut that builds up to a white noise guitar
freak-out. It's the release of tension built up
over several slower, moodier songs. "Close
the Lid" features the poppiest burst of sound,
with a guitar line that echoes the melody and
prominent bass that exudes The Cure. The
album lingers a bit too long in ballads at the
beginning. But, in the second half of the
album. Port O'Brien manages to explore
some genuinely original indie territory.
Much of this originality grows from the
album's classic themes of self-doubt, fate
and family. If you listen closely, the beauty
of the music, the images and introspection
create a rich literary world of its own. It is
refreshing to hear a band using music to
express unique personal questions and not
just clever literary fantasies.
