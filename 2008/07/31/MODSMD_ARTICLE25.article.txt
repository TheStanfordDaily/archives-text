# LOCAL EATS
## Tamerine serves up classy, pricey Vietnamese fare 
### TOMMY TOBIN 
Near the end of the downtown University
Ave. strip sits Tamarine, a hopping Vietnamese
restaurant. The eatery is tremendously trendy
and chic, with bamboo menus, a fashionable
wait staff and a packed house. Tamarine has a
great bar that is well stocked. Though
Tamerine does not necessarily scale its appeal
(or its prices) to the average college student, it's
still a place of good taste, with excellent service,
impeccable food and charm.
Tamarine places a lot of emphasis on the
fact that it is both a restaurant and an art
gallery. It exhibits Vietnamese art, with an
event and auction semi-annually to benefit the
Kipp Bayview Academy, a middle school in
San Francisco that aims to have each of its
graduates go on to get a college degree.
On to the food, though, which comes fast
and furious, full of flavor and presented with
flair. The dishes are served as small plates, but
family style. Even though these plates look
quaint and small, they can fill you up fast.
Before ordering then, talk to the wait staff.
They are quick and very helpful, especially if
you don't eat Vietnamese food very often.
Take my advice: Take their advice!
Among the appetizers, the salt and pepper
calamari is tender and served fillet-style, blend
ing these subtle tastes to create the most deli
cious calamari you will likely ever find. The
shrimp cupcakes are good, but not great. For a
combination of flavors, try the Tamarine Taste,
a sampler of several items, including taro root
rolls, tea leaf beef and papaya salad.
Following the starters, Tamarine presents
the diner with some fantastic soup and noodle
options. The Ha Long Bay soup is great for
those who enjoy crab wontons or coconut milk.
Tamarine also serves a perennial classic, pho
noodles, with their own distinctive flavors.
The entrees, again served family style on
small plates, are served sizzling. The Tamarine
Prawns are a must-try. These prawns are huge
— like mini-lobster tails — but still juicy, and
served with a flavorful soy-like house sauce.
For the diner seeking more turf than surf, try
the Shaken Beef. The filet mignon melts in
your mouth, sending waves of flavor coursing
through every bite.
Tamarine even boasts an entire rice section
in its menu. While you might be used to decid
ing between white or fried rice, now you're pre
sented with seven options, ranging from
coconut rice to jasmine to tomato red. The
Empress rice comes highly recommended — it
is seasoned, with an egg on top. Accept your
waiter's offer to mix the egg into the rice for
you — the tableside entertainment satisfies
both the eye and the palate.
With all of its positive aspects, Tamarine has
some major pitfalls. First, it is quite loud, so pri
vate conversations may or may not be heard
amidst the din of the dining hustle and bustle.
The place is also cramped — tables are pushed
together too close for comfort — though both
these problems can be evaded by requesting a
quieter, more private table upon reservation.
Entrees will set you back between $18 and
$30. Not to say that they aren't worth the money
(they most definitely are), just something to
keep in mind when you're planning your next
night out on the town. You can definitely fill up
without ordering some of the pricier items, so
choose wisely. Also, while Tamarine makes veg
etarian options easy to identify on its menu, it
does not offer much for vegan diners.
