## SLAC takes center stage in Univ. dispute with DOE 
### MILES OSGOOD 
A recent struggle between University officials and
the U.S. Department of Energy over the famed
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) will likely
result in its renaming, so that 'Stanford' is no longer part
of the name.
According to SLAC insiders, the controversy may
indicate tension between the physicists who work at
SLAC and the Department of Energy (DOE), which
pays its $300 million annual bill. At the very least, the
naming spat could damage the center's sterling reputa
tion.
Problems began when the DOE tried to trademark
"SLAC" as part of a nationwide campaign to secure
government laboratories. Stanford objected, laying
claim to its own name, and instead offered a royalty-free
perpetual license, which the DOE refused. In the inter
ests of both administrative parties, "Stanford" will likely
not be in the final name at all. Hundreds of petition
signees disapprove.
One leading physics professor, who asked to remain
anonymous to avoid personally antagonizing the DOE,
suggested that the Department of Energy's refusal to

accept Stanford's offer of a royalty-free perpetual
license may indicate that it is seeking to tighten its con
trol of the lab, something that physicists are not happy
about.
The name change may also be part of an effort to
open competitive bidding for the contract to operate the
center, which is up for renewal every five years.
"In principal, somebody else could come in and do a
better job than Stanford University," said Keith
Hodgson, Deputy Director of SLAC. "The Department
of Energy could choose to compete that contract, to put
out a call for proposals."
But Hodgson downplayed the idea.
"That's not, in my view, coupled to this name change
business," he said.
While Hodgson admits that with DOE funding
comes restrictions, he doesn't feel that control issues are
ruining the Stanford-DOE relationship.
"As 1 moved more towards SLAC, 1 made a con
scious decision that 1 was going to work on things that
were, in fact, mission-oriented," he said. "On the other
hand, 1 gained the opportunity to work in a multi-disci-
