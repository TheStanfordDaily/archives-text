## SLAC takes center stage in Univ. dispute with DOE 
### MILES OSGOOD 
A recent struggle between University officials and
the U.S. Department of Energy over the famed
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) will likely
result in its renaming, so that 'Stanford' is no longer part
of the name.
According to SLAC insiders, the controversy may
indicate tension between the physicists who work at
SLAC and the Department of Energy (DOE), which
pays its $300 million annual bill. At the very least, the
naming spat could damage the center's sterling reputa
tion.
Problems began when the DOE tried to trademark
"SLAC" as part of a nationwide campaign to secure
government laboratories. Stanford objected, laying
claim to its own name, and instead offered a royalty-free
perpetual license, which the DOE refused. In the inter
ests of both administrative parties, "Stanford" will likely
not be in the final name at all. Hundreds of petition
signees disapprove.
One leading physics professor, who asked to remain
anonymous to avoid personally antagonizing the DOE,
suggested that the Department of Energy's refusal to

accept Stanford's offer of a royalty-free perpetual
license may indicate that it is seeking to tighten its con
trol of the lab, something that physicists are not happy
about.
The name change may also be part of an effort to
open competitive bidding for the contract to operate the
center, which is up for renewal every five years.
"In principal, somebody else could come in and do a
better job than Stanford University," said Keith
Hodgson, Deputy Director of SLAC. "The Department
of Energy could choose to compete that contract, to put
out a call for proposals."
But Hodgson downplayed the idea.
"That's not, in my view, coupled to this name change
business," he said.
While Hodgson admits that with DOE funding
comes restrictions, he doesn't feel that control issues are
ruining the Stanford-DOE relationship.
"As 1 moved more towards SLAC, 1 made a con
scious decision that 1 was going to work on things that
were, in fact, mission-oriented," he said. "On the other
hand, 1 gained the opportunity to work in a multi-disci-
plinary environment that allowed me
to study problems that I simply could -
n't attack [on Stanford campus.]"
Bill Madia, Stanford's vice presi
dent for SLAC, was blunt about the
dispute.
"The issue as I understand it is not
about who controls the facility," he
said. "That's unambiguous: It's their
lab."
Officials were quick to dismiss alle
gations that the name change is any
thing more than recognition of the
center's changing mission.
"1 don't think it's about control at
all," Madia said. "It's about how the
name reflects a different kind of labo
ratory."
For decades, the linear accelerator
defined SLAC, and it was the main
focus of research at the center. Now,
attention is being focused on projects
like the Linac Coherent Light Source,
a half-mile extension of the main accel
erator that harnesses hard X-rays. The
$500 million project — which will
enable researchers to image molecu
lar, atomic and subatomic particles at
an unprecedented rate and precision
— opens in one year.
"What's happened in the last 10
years is that the centricity of the linear
accelerator has changed," Hodgson
said. "The U.S. chose not to fund the
next generations of particle accelera
tors required to keep up in this field"
Regardless of the reason for the
change, many of SLAC's physicists are
unhappy with the possibility of drop
ping 'Stanford' from the center's name
because they see it as an insult to the
center's illustrious history and are con
cerned that it may make it more diffi
cult to attract top-tier researchers.
"It appears, particularly among
engineering staff, that there is great
value, literally, in being associated with
Stanford University," said Particle
Physics and Astrophysics Prof. Martin
Breidenbach. "A change in the name
will break the manifest link."
According to those involved in the
petition to keep SLAC's name intact,
the primary reason to save the current
name is its historical reputation.
"The concern is how a name
change could not reflect the wonderful
history of the laboratory," Madia said.
SLAC, after all, has housed four
Nobel Prize winners, neutralized
arsenic in Indian rivers, discovered
three quarks and imaged DNA tran
scription. Until the Beijing Airport
opened last year, the accelerator was
the longest building in the world. Only
four weeks ago, physicists detected the
lowest-energy particle of the bottomo
nium family.
"We're all pretty proud of the labo
ratory—not onlv its past, but also its
present and fuiw ~" said DOE site
manager Paul Goian.
Despite the recent controversy,
most Stanford and DOE scientists are
hopeful for SLAC's technological
future — regardless of what its name
will be.
"The really remarkable thing is that
we're talking about a laboratory that
started in 1962, and we're now looking
at the future," Hodgson said. "We can
predict that SLAC is still going to be
here and doing discovery-level sci
ence."
