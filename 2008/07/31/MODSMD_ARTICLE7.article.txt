## Hospital denies workers' union recognition 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Stanford Hospital and Clinics and
the Lucille Packard Children's
Hospital announced Tuesday that
they will no longer recognize the
union that represents 1,450 non-tech
nical employees at the medical center,
because the union was allegedly not
directly elected by the workers.
Service Employees International
Union (SEIU) Local 715, which has
long represented the Stanford
employees, merged with SEIU Local
521 last year, and has since been
absorbed by the United Healthcare
Workers.
Lucille Packard Children's
Hospital spokeswoman Sarah Staley
told the San Jose Mercury News that
it is business as usual at the Hospital,
and that employees won't see any
changes.
The contract Stanford negotiated
with SEIU Local 715 was scheduled
to expire in November of this year.
The SEIU is holding a press con
ference tomorrow morning at
Stanford Hospital, announcing its
intent to hold union elections.
