## Medical Center sells lab, lays off workers 200 workers left job-searching as business taken by LabCorp 
### RYAN MAC CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford Medical Center announced last
week that it would lay off 200 workers at its 3375
Hillview Ave. outreach laboratory —just a year
and a half alter hundreds of workers were
moved into the brand new lab.
Stanford's outreach business is being
acquired by Laboratory Corporation of
America (LabCorp); executives from LabCorp
told analysts that the deal is expected to close
by Aug, 1. The building will continue to be
owned by Stanford, but LabCorp will take over
the lab's outreach practice, which consists of
basic services and tests done for private compa
nies.
"Approximately 200 employees received
[layoff] notices and, to date, over half have been
hired or offered positions by LabCorp — and
we expect that number to grow," said Gary
Migdol, medical center director of communica
tions. "In addition, outreach lab employees who
have expressed a desire to remain at SHC are
given priority consideration for open positions
within both Stanford Hospital & Clinics and
Lucile Packard Children's Hospital,"
But not all employees have been offered
assignments from LabCorp or Stanford — and
this has led to some animosity between labora
tory workers and the Hospital.
"When [the laboratory] first opened,
Stanford publicized it as a successful enterprise

that would create lots of business," said Myriam
Escamilla, assistant trustee for the United
Healthcare Workers, a local union representing
Stanford Hospital workers. "Workers trans
ferred there because they hoped for great
things. The problem now is that with the trans
fer, it is not the hospital, but rather the workers
who pay the price for failure."
Workers are now feeling betrayed by the
hospital, Escamilla said, because layoffs are
coming so soon after the transfers.

Complicating matters fur
ther, Escamilla's union does
not represent any of the 3375
Hillview laboratory workers.
Under the contract of United
Health Care Workers with
Stanford Hospital and Clinics,
only employees working on the
footprint of Stanford Medical
Center can be represented by

the union. Members who
transferred to the Hillview
laboratory had to withdraw

from the union in order to
work there.

"About 100 workers
who transferred were
union members,"

Escamilla said. "When
we first heard of the

news from several
workers, they were
very disappointed

and wanted to see
if organizing could
help prevent their
layoffs. However,

the union had no jurisdiction over non-union
members so we couldn't assist them."

When it first opened in February 2007, the
Hillview laboratory was advertised as a cutting
edge facility that would provide the newest test
ing services with increased space, improved effi
ciency and important innovation. One and a
half years later, Stanford's outreach business is
being sold because it has failed to become eco
nomically viable for the hospital. Officials
would not comment if the sale was directly
related to the hospital's plans for expansion in
the near future.

"This decision was made only after a thor
ough review of all aspects of the basic clinical
outreach lab, including the business, market and
financial status of the services provided," Migdol
said. "There were concerns about the financial

viability of the basic outreach lab. After sev
eral years of net losses, SHC had to make

the tough decision to sell the basic part of
the outreach laboratory business."

But the sale won't affect
patient care, hospital officials

stressed. The center will contin
ue to provide basic, as well as
specialized, laboratory testing

services to ensure that patients
are treated with the utmost care

and attention.

"An important point to
remember is that there will be no
impact on Stanford Hospital inpa
tients or outpatients," Migdol said.
