## Olshansky defends journalist Afghani reporter Jawed Ahmad detained by U.S. as enemy combatant

Law School Prof. Barbara
Olshansky is representing a journalist
who ran into trouble while reporting
from the Middle East: Jawed Ahmad,
a 22-year-old Afghani working for
Canada's CTV, didn't run into the
usual threats, though, that are faced
by war-zone journalists, such as kid
napping or roadside bombs. Rather,
Ahmad was detained by the U.S. gov
ernment.

On October 26 of last year, the
young journalist simply vanished.
Weeks later, reporters learned from

Ahmad's family that he had been
arrested by U.S. troops, locked up in
the U.S. military prison at Bagram Air
Base and accused of being an enemy
combatant in his home country.
Following his arrest, Ahmad was
held without charges or trial for sever
al months in the detention center at
Bagram. This June, lawyers represent
ing Ahmad filed a federal lawsuit
challenging his detention on grounds
similar to those cited in successful law
suits on behalf of captives at the U.S.
military prison at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba.
"They stopped sending people to
Guantanamo and are sending them to
Bagram instead," Olshansky said. "In
some ways, we have a stronger case
than Guantanamo."
Unfortunately, Ahmad's story is
not the first of its kind; he is only one
of over 600 detainees who arc current
ly being held in the U.S. military
prison at Bagram. What makes

Ahmad's case particularly troubling is
that as a journalist, not only are his
personal rights being put in jeopardy,
but so is freedom of the press.
"In the U.S., we believe that free
dom of the press is an essential com
ponent of our democracy, but it
appears that under military order, the
U.S. government is detaining foreign
journalists without basis and without
due process," Olshansky said. "That
runs afoul of our beliefs and the law. It
also interferes with our ability as citi
zens to get uncensored press reports
from combat zones."
The Law School's Human Rights
Clinic, with Olshansky at its head, is
petitioning for Ahmad's right to a fair
trial. Olshansky, who has been litigat
ing Guantanamo cases since their
commencement, believes that the
grounds for Ahmad's arrest do not
justify his imprisonment.
