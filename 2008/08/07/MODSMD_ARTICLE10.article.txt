## Researchers awarded millions Keck Foundation grants $2.5 million to Deisseroth, Wysocka 
### MELANIE KIM DAILY VISITING INTERN 
Two Stanford researchers received a total of $2.5
million from the W.M. Keck Foundation this week
for research purposes. Assistant Professor of
Bioengineering Karl Deisseroth received a $ 1.5-mil
lion science and engineering grant and Assistant
Prof, of Chemical and Systems Biology Joanna
Wysocka was chosen as one of Keek's five Young
Emerging Scholars, receiving a $l-million grant.
Every year, the Keck Foundation selects around
30 institutions that will submit one candidate to be
eligible for the Distinguished Young Scholars in
Medical Research Award. Keck then picks 10 nomi
nees to be interviewed at the Foundation in front of a
scientific board. Out of the 10, Keck chooses five to
receive the $1 -million grant.
"The nominees are all assistant professors because
this is meant to be for young scholars," Wysocka
explained. "By definition, the whole idea is to pro
mote young scientists who are embarking on their sci
entific career by giving them money and allowing
them to explore new and sometimes risky areas. It

gives me more freedom and flexibility to pursue what
I really want to do."
Wysocka will use her $1-million grant to further
advance her research regarding the epigenetic regula
tion of DNA — or the "on" and "off" regulation of
gene expression that is independent of the inherited
DNA sequence.
"One of the fundamental questions of biology is
how a single cell — a zygote which forms upon fertil
ization — can become a whole organism that consists
of so many cell types," she said. "The whole process
of development occurs without changes in DNA
sequence because each of our cells has the same
genome. So, the difference is which specific genes of
the sequence are active and which are silent."
Wysocka will focus her research on the enzymes
that regulate this active and silent process.
As differentiation progresses, the number of cells
with a particular characteristic decreases significant
ly. Wysocka's research team hopes to develop tech
nology that will allow them to get to these specific
cells and proteins and identify them. Their current
project involves the combination of protein purifica
tion with microfluid technology. The additional fund
ing provided by the Keck Foundation will support
these projects and also fuel additional research.
"We are big spenders," Wysocka said. "Most of
the research we do, such as stem-cell
research, is quite expensive. Some
sequencing even costs thousands of
dollars for single rounds. As a small
lab, we wouldn't have been able to
do it, but with some extra cash, we
can do those things. It's very excit
ing."
Wysocka has high hopes that her
research will be useful for the future.
"We think that this will also be
significant for regenerative medi
cine," she said. "If you imagine the
therapeutic uses in regenerative

medicine, one possibility is, perhaps
sometime in the future, to repro
gram cells from a patient to whatev
er type of cell the patient needs in
vitro and then introduce those cells
back to the patient."
"Of course, this is something to
do in the future," she continued,
"but ultimately, I don't think this is
science fiction. This is within reach."
Deisseroth is also pursuing
research that might seem straight
out of science fiction. Having genet
ically engineering brain cells to pro
duce light-sensitive proteins that
would control neural activity (neu
rons become more active when
exposed to blue light and less active
in yellow light), his group plans to
use the grant to face new challenges.

Armed with the $1.5-million
grant, Deisseroth will pursue apply
ing the light-pulse technique to cells
other than neurons, according to a
School of Medicine press release.
His research group has also found a
way to engineer cells to be stimulat
ed, rather than turned off, by yellow
light. This enables scientists to con
duct experiments that can differenti
ate two types of cells — one turning
on with yellow light and another
with blue light. This will be useful in
detecting the actual cause of certain
maladies when more than one cell
type is suspected of causing the trou
ble.
