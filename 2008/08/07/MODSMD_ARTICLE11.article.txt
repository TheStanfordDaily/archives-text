## Scientist finds potential solution for baldness 
### BEN ASHER DAILY VISITING INTERN 
Recent research on mice at the Stanford
Center for Clinical Science Research is provid
ing hope for balding humans everywhere.
Researchers suggest that a protein called
Laminin-511 could be used to promote hair
growth in humans. Thus far, it has shown good
results when tested on mice, and Dr. Peter
Marinkovich thinks it could become available
for humans in just two years.

The Laminin-511 protein works at the
boundary between the dermis and epidermis
layers of the skin, transmitting signals between
them. Laminin-511 is naturally found in both
mice and humans, according to Marinkovich,
who has been researching it since 2001.
"It's exciting," he said. "It's not really sav
ing any lives or anything, but hair loss can be
devastating to people, even traumatic.
[Laminin-511] could improve the quality of
life."
Generally, drug research starts at the dis

ease and moves towards a cure. However,
Marinkovich started with the protein and
started looking at which diseases it had an
effect on.
"It was an accident," he admitted.
The estimated two-year development time
for Laminin-511 will involve petitioning the
FDA to start clinical trials and planning a
means of safely mass-producing the treatment
for the public, Marinkovich said. If the FDA
approves the treatment for humans, it could
open the doors to further Laminin-related

treatments for diseases.
Not only could a Laminin-511 injection
help with balding in general, but it could also
be helpful for patients dealing with cancer
treatments.
"Chemo patients have the best chance of
responding to Laminin-511," Marinkovich
said. Soon, for those fighting anything
from chemo to male-pattern baldness, a full
head of hair might be just an injection away.
