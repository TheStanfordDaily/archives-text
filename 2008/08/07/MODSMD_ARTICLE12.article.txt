Every college has them — those quintessential
locales where students congregate, whether to
study or just have a good time. But the source of
appeal for campus hotspots is often difficult to
articulate.
For instance, there must be more to the Stanford coffee
house (CoHo) than its piping hot java. The uproar upon its
closure would suggest so.
On a lazy Saturday afternoon, three things are going on:
studying, socializing and sipping of coffee. Everyone at the
CoHo either has a laptop on the table in front of them or a
person sitting next to them chatting away.
"It's a good hangout place," said Ally Calva, an employ
ee at the CoHo and granddaughter of owner Ray Klein.
"There is also good coffee and food, like the Portobcllo
Panini. It's so good!"
Not only does the food rake in the customers, but the

nightly entertainment does as well. Shaquille Tisdell, a sum
mer Jazz Session student, conies to the CoHo every Monday
night to watch the jazz jam sessions.
"With the entertainment and everything, it just has a
great environment," Tisdell said. "I try to come here every
day."
For Calva and Tisdell, the good products and inviting
atmosphere make the CoHo a Stanford hotspot.
"It's the CoHo," Tisdell added. "People at Stanford are
programmed to like it! Oh, and the attendees are hot! Every
male comes here first!"
Just a hop, skip and short bike ride from the CoHo,
Green Library is a world away in terms of atmosphere, but
still a popular destination for students. Although few go
there for the camaraderie (shh, there's studying going on) or
a good cup o' joe (sorry, not allowed), the air is cool and the
seats are inviting.
John Sutherland, a second-year graduate student in clas

sics, visits the library a few times each week.
"1 like it because it has air conditioning — that's always a
plus around here," Sutherland said. "I also have really easy
access to books here."
Green is filled with many interesting books, some in
places where students don't need to worry about falling
asleep while studying. Just mosey on over to the West
Stacks, where you have to stay vigilant for fear of making an
appearance in a real-life horror movie. The narrow, claustro
phobic halls evoke scenes from "Cry Wolf" in the way
motion sensors flicker the lights.
The scary atmosphere and deads Hence, however, don't
deter some students.
"Despite the fact that I have witnessed strange things
back here, I enjoy the silence," said Hugh Gorman '09.
