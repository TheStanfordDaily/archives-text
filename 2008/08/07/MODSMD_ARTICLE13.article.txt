## Perspectives Chronic Lyme Disease Andrea Runyan 
### 
I have several unconventional
beliefs.
For example, 1 think that chronic
Lyme disease exists and is due to
continued infection. This might
sound like a mundane claim (that an
infectious disease exists) until you
realize the extent of the controversy
over chronic Lyme disease/post-
Lyme syndrome.
The "official" position, espoused
by the IDS A, CDC and most doc
tors, is that chronic Lyme disease, a
condition that thousands of people
claim to suffer from, doesn't exist
and that patients' symptoms can't be
due to continued infection.
My personal experience makes
me believe otherwise. I got the
bulls-eye rash and some hardcore
Lyme symptoms in June and took
six weeks of antibiotics. However,
since ending the prescription last
week, my original symptoms are
returning full-force. My doctor says
there's no way I can still have Lyme
and that it must be "post-Lyme syn
drome," but not an active infection.
However, this sure feels like an
active infection to me, given that I'm
getting back serious, clear-cut symp
toms I haven't had ever since the
antibiotics cleared them up a few
weeks ago.
There are reasons to believe that
Lyme bacteria can survive short
term antibiotic treatment, given that
the bacteria may hide out in cystic
form and in the nervous system
(where standard antibiotics do not
reach) to return when conditions are
more favorable. It's been shown
that mice get chronic Lyme disease
and sustain persistent infections
from which other Lyme-free mice
can become infected. The
International Lyme and Associated
Diseases Society reports that
between 30 and 62 percent of Lyme
patients show treatment failure (i.e.
relapse) within three years of short
term antibiotic treatment thought to
be effective for treating the disease,
so there's reason to think at least
some bacteria can survive the initial
course of antibiotics.
I can understand the arguments
that something besides an active
infection may be a factor in persis
tent Lyme symptoms. Anyone
who's had a die-off reaction when
they started antibiotics knows that
the bacterial lipoproteins from dead
bacteria can cause serious symp
toms. However, if chronic Lyme dis
ease is only due to inactive leftover
toxins, then why do symptoms alter
nately flare up and die down in the
absence or presence of antibiotics?
I can also understand studies
showing that continued antibiotic
treatment for chronic Lyme may not
always be effective, but to me, that's
because Lyme disease can be diffi

cult to eradicate, not because it's not
due to an infection. Whatever the
cause of chronic Lyme disease, we
can't just give up trying to treat it.
It's not something you can just live
with. The symptoms I'm dealing
with now are serious enough that it's
hard to write this column.
Complications from disseminated
Lyme disease include arthritis, bone
pain, Bells palsy, memory problems,
difficulty finding words, vision
changes, hallucinations, paralysis,
long-term fatigue and inability to
work; it can severely affect people's
lives, as seen in the recent documen
tary "Under Our Skin."
It's hard when you have serious
symptoms from a serious infectious
disease and doctors say that you
don't have anything wrong with you.
There's shame from being told
you're making it up, frustration at
your symptoms not being acknowl
edged and most of all. fear about
how to treat a worsening condition
— when the people who are usually
best at that (doctors and Western
medicine) are not helping you.
I have to wonder why Western
medicine abandons chronic Lyme
patients. Does it have something to
do with insurance companies not
wanting to cover long-term treat
ment for chronic Lyme disease? It's
ironic that you can be denied insur
ance coverage on the basis of having
chronic Lyme disease, but then if
you already have insurance, it often
won't cover treatment for that same
condition (with reasons for this
including that the doesn't exist or
that treatment is experimental).
Something's going on with the
politics of Lyme disease, to the
detriment of thousands of patients.
It may be a while before we under
stand the situation, much less sort it
out, but we can take care of our
selves in the meantime.
Educate yourself about Lyme
disease so as to catch it early in
yourself or others, when it has a
much better prognosis. Understand
that you can have Lyme disease
even if you never have the rash and
if you test negative for it. Try to
avoid getting Lyme disease in the
first place by avoiding tick bites. For
anyone who has or has had Lyme
disease, read Brian Rosner's book,
"The Top 10 Lyme Disease
Treatments," and watch the recent
documentary about Lyme disease
controversy (most of which is on
You Tube), "Under Our Skin." And,
write to me about what you think or
what you've experienced.
