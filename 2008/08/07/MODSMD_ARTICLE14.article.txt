## Defending the Blue Dogs 
### 
The Netroots, or whatever it is
they call themselves these
days, have latched upon the
ludicrous idea of expelling Blue Dog
Democrats from the Democratic
Party. The Blue Dogs are a group
ing of moderate and conservative
House Democrats who tend to rep
resent more conservative, rural
areas. Glenn Greenwald, a well
known leftist blogger, revived the
expulsion idea; Daily Kos and other
fanatical sites have been talking
about it for years.
Greenwald argues that the
Democrats have failed to stand up
to President Bush on issues like
Iraq, spending and FISA, which
then gives Americans a low opinion
of Congress. Greenwald wants to
target Blue Dogs' seats and run
more liberal primary challengers.
He trumpets the case of Georgia
Rep. John Barrow, a well-known
Blue Dog who received consider
able pressure from leftist political
action committees and faced a pri
mary challenger.
Barrow won the primary by a
huge margin, but nevertheless
Greenwald seems thrilled that he
had to "devote far more resources
to defending his seat for November.
That is what it means to attach a
price to trampling on the political
values of Democratic supporters."
Making it tough for Democrats to
win Republican-leaning districts
seems to be his mission.
Greenwald and the Netroots are
living in a fantasy world. Yes, the
Democrats have a big majority in
the House already and will expand it
in November. Yes, Democrats have
a 15-point lead on generic ID over

Republicans. What Greenwald fails
to realize is that Democrats already
hold pretty much all of the liberal
leaning Congressional districts. Any
more gains will have to be won from
Republican-leaning districts. The
three by-election victories that
Democrats have won this year — in
rural Illinois, Louisiana and
Mississippi — are not districts that
Netroots-approved "progressive
Democrats" can win.
Besides poor electoral math, the
Netroots ignore the important role
that Blue Dog Democrats play in
intra-Party dynamics. House
Democrats have already moved too
far to the left on trade, foreign poli
cy and domestic spending. Maybe
not this election, but at some point,
these liberal positions will most like
ly come back to bite Democrats. It
has been a lesson time and time
again that as soon as the Democrats
go too far to the left, they get
crushed in presidential and
Congressional elections — witness
the 1968 riots, the 1972 McGovern
campaign or 1988's disastrous
Michael Dukakis campaign.
Liberal Democrats lose elections;
moderate Democrats like Bill
Clinton win them. The reason why
Barack Obama is barely leading
