## All's Fair

The abundance was unsettling
and euphoric. Everywhere
you looked, people held
watermelon halves in the palms of
their hands. 1 watched as they dug
into the red, meaty fruit with plastic
forks; as juice dripped around their
fingers and wrists and stained their
T-shirts. Small children crouched in
the dirt around a shared wedge and
pulled at the flesh with their fingers.
Elderly women spit out seeds as
sluggers do chewing tobacco, with
out dainty ceremony or polite ritu

enjoy more of the sweet, cold

In the 100-degree heat of the
sun, I felt woozy and dehydrated
and watched as organizers heaped
the big, green ovals onto the juice

this immense magnitude of water
melon consumption. However,
standing there in the sun, among
the townspeople of Water Valley, it
seemed exactly like what one is
supposed to do on a hot, summer
day in America.
A town or county fair represents
something so and
stereotypically American. It's "Our
Town," "The Music Man" and
"Charlotte's Web" all wrapped up
in a few brilliant days of funnel
cake, produce competitions, flag
waving and Ferris wheels. The town
fair is a reaffirmation that good,
honest people make up this increas
ingly urban country of shrinking
local traditions. It hints at a mythos
that we are indeed a collage of
Norman Rockwell subjects parad

and saluting the flag. Eating that
watermelon felt incredibly whole
