## All's Fair 
### 
The abundance was unsettling
and euphoric. Everywhere
you looked, people held
watermelon halves in the palms of
their hands. 1 watched as they dug
into the red, meaty fruit with plastic
forks; as juice dripped around their
fingers and wrists and stained their
T-shirts. Small children crouched in
the dirt around a shared wedge and
pulled at the flesh with their fingers.
Elderly women spit out seeds as
sluggers do chewing tobacco, with
out dainty ceremony or polite ritu
al, hocking furiously in order to
enjoy more of the sweet, cold

melon.
In the 100-degree heat of the
sun, I felt woozy and dehydrated
and watched as organizers heaped
the big, green ovals onto the juice
soaked tables, cut effortlessly
through the rinds and offered up
hearty pieces free of charge to the
frenzied crowd. "Get your water
melon," they said, "there's plenty."
Wet with sweat and desperately
parched from eating fried chicken
on a stick, 1 grabbed a fork and a
foot-long piece of cold fruit and
brought it up to my eager lips. 1
gobbled it down, delicious, dizzy
and ecstatic.
This was the 39th annual
Watermelon Festival of Water
Valley, Miss. I found myself here
with two co-workers from the non
profit I work at in Jackson. We saw
a roadside sign and decided it was a
perfect opportunity to get a taste of
local character; little did we know
how big a taste we would get.
Certainly, it was a bit bizarre to see
this immense magnitude of water
melon consumption. However,
standing there in the sun, among
the townspeople of Water Valley, it
seemed exactly like what one is
supposed to do on a hot, summer
day in America.
A town or county fair represents
something so and
stereotypically American. It's "Our
Town," "The Music Man" and
"Charlotte's Web" all wrapped up
in a few brilliant days of funnel
cake, produce competitions, flag
waving and Ferris wheels. The town
fair is a reaffirmation that good,
honest people make up this increas
ingly urban country of shrinking
local traditions. It hints at a mythos
that we are indeed a collage of
Norman Rockwell subjects parad
ing around our prize-winning pigs
and saluting the flag. Eating that
watermelon felt incredibly whole
some and pure. It made me wish
that I could be a part of Water
Valley all year round, and 1 felt a
longing for a golden age of small
towns and right living.
Last week, I also went to the
Neshoba County Fair. It is perhaps
Mississippi's most famous fair,
affectionately — and officially, as
it's a registered trademark —
referred to as "the world's largest
house party." It earns this title
because within the fairgrounds are
over 600 tightly packed cabins.
Families from all over Mississippi
come every year to stay in the same
cabin. Usually, these little treasures
have been in the family for genera
tions, passed from one patriarch to
the next. Dividing the rows of cab
ins are hand-painted signs delineat
ing neighborhoods such as "Happy
Hollow" and "Sunset Strip." People
sit on their porches, prepare home
cooked meals and invite their
neighbors to share sweet ice tea and
some barbecue, and most likely
reminisce about the good old times.
Political speeches make up the
main event of the fair; in fact, this
was where Ronald Reagan began
his 1980 presidential campaign. (My
boss likes to call Neshoba,
"Woodstock for Republicans.") For

an entire day, politicians from every
level of Mississippi government give
speeches to an often rowdy crowd in
the main square's pavilion. The gen
eral theme this year was about how
liberals in Washington ruin every
thing. I imagine that's a reoccurring
theme.
This year's candidates for the
Senate seat vacated by Trent Lott,
Republican Roger Wicker and for
mer Democratic Governor Ronnie
Musgrove, spoke back to back. The
race so far has been surprisingly
tight, so the candidates spared no
opportunity to jab at the others'
senatorial fitness; although
Musgrove, a Democrat facing a
largely disapproving crowd, had to
play it safe. He proclaimed himself:
"A Mississippi Democrat... pro-life
and pro-gun." Like Wicker, he
explained that Washington is out of
touch with the values of common
Americans and made appeals to the
crowd's sense of history and
Mississippi and Neshoba County
pride.
In all the rhetoric of local pride
and tradition, obviously I found
myself alienated, being the very
worst kind of liberal, one from
Massachusetts. But just like when I
was eating the watermelon, I was
also slightly charmed and intoxicat
ed. Looking around at the quaint
cabins with their lovely front porch
es, lively home-spun decor and
ample character. I too longed for
simpler times, when neighbors and

longtime friends could get together
and have things their way without
the meddling fingers of
Washington.
But then, when I walked over to
the horse track to watch some har
ness racing, I realized the deep fault
in this nostalgia for an imaginary
past. At the horse track, 1 saw the
first black people 1 had seen all day;
they were the horse trainers and rid
ers, maintaining the animals owned
by the all white cabin owners.
Suddenly, those porch scenes didn't
seem so cute anymore, instead
loaded with heavy historical bag
gage.
Although the fried Oreos may
be delicious, the Bluegrass band
swinging and the watermelon
incredibly sweet and succulent, I
am glad the county-fair comes only
once a year. I remember why it can
be a good thing Washington politi
cians and not smooth-talking,
crowd-pleasing, county fair orators
run this country.
