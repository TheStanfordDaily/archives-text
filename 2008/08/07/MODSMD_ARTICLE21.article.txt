## PGA LEGENDS RENO-TAHOE OPEN Grube in the money in Reno Rob Grube '08 finishes 14th; Wie misses the cut again 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK DAILY VISITING INTERN 
After an exhilarating five-day tourna
ment, running from July 28 through Aug. 3,
the Reno-Tahoe Open proved to be a sensa
tional event for Stanford golf fans, ending in
disappointment for one golfer with Cardinal
ties and achievement for another.
Rob Grube '08, who helped lead the
Cardinal to a national title in 2007, finished in
a seven-way tie for 14th place in his PGA
Tour debut with a seven-under-par 281 after
four rounds of play. The former Stanford
golfer had an outstanding performance at the
PGA Legends Reno-Tahoe Open, shooting
rounds of 70-74-69-68 at Reno's Montreux
Golf and Country Club; he also earned a
$48,000 paycheck out of the $3 million purse
for his efforts.
Grube, who was invited to play in the
tournament on a sponsor's exemption, was
one of just two players not on the FedEx Cup
circuit to make the cut and finish all four
rounds.
At just 23 years of age, Grube is one of the
Cardinal's top golfers of all time. Along with
earning his fourth consecutive first-team All-
Pac-10 Conference Award this past season
and being named the conference's scholar
athlete of the year in men's golf, Grube post
ed five top-10 finishes in his 11 tournaments
as a senior.
For Stanford freshman Michelle Wie,
however, the outcome was not nearly so rosy.
Playing in the men's event, Wie not only
failed once again to make a cut on the PGA
Tour, but also struggled to an eight-over-par
80 at the Reno-Tahoe Open.
Wie, who opened with a one-over 73 this
past Thursday, looked to be in contention to
become the first woman since 1945 to make a
PGA Tour cut, making the turn at one over
for the day after starting on the back nine.
Unfortunately, the 18-year-old from
Hawaii fell apart coming home. Following
her double-bogey at the fourth hole, she took
a nine at the par-four eighth. This followed
Wie's last professional appearance, when she
was disqualified from an LPGA Tour event
for failing to sign her scorecard.
The tournament marked Wie's eighth
appearance in a PGA event. In her last five
men's tournaments, she has gone a combined
67 shots over the cut. Still, Wie has tried to
keep an open mind, hoping to learn from her

poor finishes in men's events thus far in her
career.
"I am taking away a lot of good things
from this week," Wie said in an interview
with The Weekly. "I made some really good
putts, some really good drives. I know that
there are some things 1 need to work on, but
I feel like 1 learned a lot."
Addressing criticisms from those who
believe she should stick to women's events,
given her inability to far to make a cut against
the men, Wie responded that some of her
greatest challenges thus far seem to have
been in adjusting to the men's game, arguing
that further experience could be the key to
her success in the PGA.
"I think if 1 played a couple (of men's tour
naments) in a row it'd be a different story, but
it's hard to play one a year, you know?" she
said. "I think if I played eight in a row and
missed all eight, that'd be a different story."
Still, even with another disappointing fin
ish against the men, Wie claims her game is
progressing.
"I feel like I did a lot of good things, and
hopefully that outshines the ones that I made
mistakes on," she said.
Aside from the Stanford golfers' experi
ences at the event, the Reno-Tahoe open
belonged to Parker McLachlin, who dazzled
spectators by matching a course record,

shooting a 10-under 62 on Friday. McLachlin
led at the halfway point of the $3-million tour
nament and finished with a 36-hole total of
14-under 130.
McLachlin started the last day of the tour
nament tied for sixth, but he quickly traveled
up the leadcrboard, finishing with a four-shot
lead over 1987 Masters champion Larry Mize
(66), John Merrick (67), Australian Nick
Flanagan (65) and England's Brian Davis
(67).
Notes:A trio of Cardinal golfers are com
peting at the Pacific Coast Amateur
Championship in Victoria, British Columbia
this week, with rising senior Daniel Lim
leading the way in a seven-way-tie for 11th
place. Lim is shooting a three-under-par 137
following the first two rounds at the event.
Rising sophomore Steve Ziegler currently
finds himself in a five-way tie for 20th place
after moving up 30 spots in the rankings yes
terday, when he shot a four-under-par 66 to
bring his total to a one-under 139. Rising
senior Dodge Kemmer, meanwhile, is cur
rently tied for 74th place after shooting a
nine-over-par 79 yesterday. The tournament
is slated to continue today with the third of
four rounds.
