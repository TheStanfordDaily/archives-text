Busy home, out-of-conference
slate highlight Cardinal
basketball's 2008-09 schedule
First-year Cardinal head coach Johnny
Dawkins announced the 2008-09 Stanford
men's basketball schedule on Monday. The
slate features 17 regular-season home games,
in addition to the usually challenging Pac-10
Conference matchups.

Hoping to follow in the footsteps of last
year's team, which set a new program record
for home victories (16) in a single season,
Stanford once again will play 17 games at
home. In fact, the Cardinal will play seven of its
first 10 contests at Maples Pavilion before kick
ing off league play against Arizona State on
Jan. 2.
Those home contests will include visits
from Air Force (Nov. 26), Colorado (Nov. 29),
Northwestern (Dec. 20) and Texas Tech (Dec.

28) — marking the first time in program histo
ry that Stanford will play at least one team
from the Big 10 (Air Force), the Big 12
(Colorado) and Mountain West at Maples in
the same season.
After emerging from two months of non
conference play, Stanford will again face a dif
ficult Pac-10 schedule.
"Our non-conference opponents will pre-
pare us for the variety of styles we will
see in conference play ," Dawkins told
GoStanford.com. "Playing teams from
the Big 10, Big 12 and Mountain West
at home in the same year will give our
fans an opportunity to watch us play
against quality competition."
As Stanford will have its season
opener at Yale on Nov. 14, this will rep
resent the first time the Cardinal has
opened the season on the road since an
81-66 victory at New Mexico on Nov.
17,2001.
Four days following the home open
er, Stanford will host Cal State-
Northridge for their first matchup in 15
years.
After playing Air Force on Nov.
26,the Cardinal will face Colorado in
the first of two Big 12/Pac-10
Hardwood Series matchups, with a
game against Texas Tech on Dec. 28
being the second. Stanford went 2-0 in
last year's regular season against the
Big 12, the first of Hardwood Series
Play-

After hosting Hartford on Dec. 30,
Stanford will welcome Arizona State to
the Farm for the Pac-10 opener for
both teams on Jan. 2.
Stanford's first conference road trip
will be to the Pacific Northwest, as the

championship game on March 14.
Athletes go "green" in Beijing to
promote global environmental
health
Five athletes with ties to Stanford
athletics are tackling more than their
respective events at the Beijing
Olympics. Appropriately, given the
tremendous Beijing air pollution that
has made headlines in recent days, the
Cardinal quintet will also look to take
on environmental issues and promote
global awareness of the health of our
planet on their way to gold-medal
glory.
Rachel Buehler '08 (women's soc
cer), Nicole Barnhart '05 (women's soc
cer), Matt Gentry '05 (wrestling),
Sabrina Kolker '03 (women's rowing)
and Jamie Schroeder '05 (men's row
ing) have joined the Green Laces move
ment, a cause which supports and
encourages athletes and athletic organi
zations to be more green, and promotes
people (athletes especially) wearing
Green Laces to show their pride in help
ing the planet.
In their support of the Green Laces
movement, the athletes have made
promises to wear green shoelaces to
show that they are aware of the inces
sant damages being done to the envi
ronment. In addition, each of the ath
letes also made individual pledges to

help environmental causes in their own
lives, like "[turning] out the lights when
leaving a room," recycling, reusing
water bottles and eating more vegeta
bles.
Other headliners involved in the
Green Laces movement, modeled in
many ways after the Live Strong wrist
bands popularized by American cyclist
Lance Armstrong, include Yao Ming
and Leßron James.
Stanford women's volleyball a
unanimous choice to finish atop the
Pac-10 yet again
The Stanford women's volleyball
team has been voted unanimously by
conference coaches to win the Pac-10
volleyball title for the third consecutive
season. The Cardinal, which won its
flth Pac-10 title and reached the
NCAA championship match for the
second straight year in 2007, will return
three All-Americans, including Pac-10
Player of the Year and VCA National
Player of the Year Foluke
Akinradewo.
Stanford received the maximum of
90 points in the selection, 15 more than
second-place UCLA, and received a
first-place vote from each of the confer
ence's nine opposing head coaches.
Stanford is the first team to be picked
unanimously by all nine other coaches
since USC in 2003.
USC and California received 68 and
62 points to nail down third and fourth
place, respectively. Washington placed
with 59 points, followed by Oregon,
which earned 51 points. Rounding out
the list, in order, were Arizona, Arizona
State, Oregon State and Washington
State.
The Pac-10 again sent three teams
to the Final Four in 2007 (Stanford,
USC and California), marking the third
time in four seasons that the Pac-10

made up three-fourths of the Final
Four teams. The conference has taken
home five of the last seven NCAA
titles.
All 10 teams of the Pac-10 will open
the 2008 season on Friday, Aug. 29 in
tournament play. The Cardinal, specifi
cally, will meet Nebraska in the season
opener as part of the Runza/AVCA
Showcase at the Qwest Center in
Omaha.
Track and field adds Ninow to
assist throwers
Edrick Floreal, the Franklin P.
Johnson Director of Track and Field
was pleased to announce yesterday that
Andrew Ninow will be hired as an assis
tant coach to work with the Cardinal's
throwers.
"Andrew is one of the nation's top
up-and-coming throws coaches and we
are very excited to have him on board,"
Floreal told GoStanford.com. "He is
extremely knowledgeable, passionate
and committed to creating a power
house throws contingent at Stanford."
A native of Sacramento, Ninow is a
UCLA alumnus; he remained with the
Bruins after graduation, serving as an
assistant throws and weight coach
before accepting the throws coaching
position at the University of San
Francisco.
Ninow was a two-time Pac-10 and
West Regional competitor for UCLA.
His best overall finish was eighth at the
2007 NCAA West Regional in the
hammer throw. His personal best toss is
207-4 in that event.
Ninow and the Cardinal will get the
track and field season underway in
early 2009 when they will compete
indoors at the UW Indoor Preview on
Jan. 16.
