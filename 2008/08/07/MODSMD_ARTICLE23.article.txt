## Politics can wait until after Games 
### 
Docs anyone remember, four months ago, when a
few crazy people climbed the Golden Gate
Bridge in San Francisco and unraveled that
giant banner? Why were they doing that again?
If you do recall, or if you check out the video on
You Tube (just type in "Golden Gate Bridge protest"),
they were taking advantage of the publicity generated
by the Olympic Torch relay scheduled to run through
the city the next day to protest China's occupation of
Tibet. And they were far from being the only ones con
cerned with the current state of affairs in Tibet.
Similar protests occurred around the world, espe
cially after Chinese forces killed dozens of Tibetans dur
ing uprisings in March. Many called for political leaders
to boycott the Opening Ceremonies or even the entire
Games. Experts on ESPN, and elsewhere, predicted
that the extraordinary air pollution in Beijing would
cause still more problems for the world's athletes and
there were rumors that many competitors would only
stay in Beijing on the days of their events to avoid res
piratory problems.
With all of this controversy and speculation, the
upcoming Summer Olympic Games are arguably the
most controversial since the 1980 Summer Games in
Moscow. The games in the then-Soviet Union were
boycotted by 62 countries, with the U.S. leading the
pack. And, after the Opening Ceremonies tomorrow,
the greatest Olympic clamor in nearly 30 years will be
upon us.
But despite all the controversy surrounding the
Games in China, they are still about to get underway
and provide two weeks of world-class competition and
entertainment for millions of viewers worldwide. And
that is something we should all be thrilled to see, regard
less of the other issues at play.
The Olympic experience is the only spectacle that
can put so many sports and athletes into the global spot
light and provide them with quality media coverage.
The world is full of interesting sports outside of what we
see every day in the newspaper and on ESPN, and the
Olympics gives fans a chance to enjoy things like sailing,
whitewater kayaking, competitive table tennis and
handball. And — you can take my word on this — elite
table tennis is an extremely entertaining sport.
Sports like these lack the extensive appeal and mon
eymaking ability to gain regular media coverage in any
widespread manner, meaning that both avid and casual
sports fans will have over 3,600 hours of coverage on
television and online to find new sports and events to
love that they wouldn't normally have access to.
But it's the athletes who really make the Olympics
something worth getting excited about.
These are people who have committed huge por
tions of their lives to becoming as good as they can be in
their respective events — many without seeing any sig
nificant financial gain for doing so — in the hopes of
winning a medal for their country or setting a record.
Each one of them is a symbol of what dedication and
perseverance can do and all should be models of what
can be achieved with hard work.
Of course, like any other group, the pool of
Olympians will not be without its bad apples. Blood
doping is a major problem in many sports and certainly
some athletes in Beijing will be cheating. But testing has
become broad and effective enough to ensure that most
of them will be clean.
And, of course, the national pride aspect is always
there. The Olympics are the only time when just about
every country in the world is able to compete against
each other in such a broad collection of events. That is
something that can create some real unity and pride for
people all around the world, and there's not a nation on
the planet that couldn't use more of
that, including our own.
Take the case of Michael Phelps,
for example. Setting a record for gold
medals won in a single Olympics cer
tainly isn't going to reshape America,
but it could help bring Americans a
little closer together during a divisive
election season and help us recall all
that we have in common rather than
all that separates us. And that is
something worth celebrating.
So when the Olympic torch makes
it final run tomorrow and the games
get underway, don't worry so much
about China's human rights or envi
ronmental record. Those are things
that need to be addressed and every
one has a right to be concerned with
or angered by, but they shouldn't
overshadow the Games, because that
is what they are: games.
Have fun, watch some sports you
hadn't ever heard of or seen before,
cheer for underdogs and celebrate
the human stories of triumph. There
are things worth protesting in China
and around the globe, but don't let
this mar the Games and the unity,
excitement, pride and hope they can
bring. Let the Olympics be the sym
bol of global unity and celebration
they claim to be and maybe they will
help bring a divided and often cruel
world just a little bit closer together.
And you can always protest the
next day.
