# OLYMPIC SWIMMING
## More than just a "splash-and-dash" 
### KENAN JIANG STAFF WRITER 
Ben Wildman-Tobriner '07 is in many ways a pretty aver
age, just-out-of-college guy. He studied for the MCATs last
year, got into UC-San Francisco School of Medicine, admits
taking his academics seriously and has an easygoing, laid-back
attitude. Like most Stanford grads, he's also doing pretty well
transitioning from college to being a professional, working for
Speedo, where he is fortunate enough to be doing something
he is passionate about.
But that is where the "average" aspect of Wildman-
Tobriner comes to a screeching halt.
Wildman-Tobriner swims the 50-meter freestyle for a living.
In swimming terms, the 50 is the shortest and fastest event — a
virtual sprint through the water. For him. the difference
between first and last is literally separated by a few-hundredths
of a second — a margin of victory that is virtually impossible to
distinguish for the average spectator, at least without the aid of

slow-motion replay.
The only thing a spectator will definitely be able to see at the
end of a 50-meter race is the waves generated by the power of
the athletes involved. To non-swimmers, it may look like the 50
is just a "splash-and-dash," where whoever waves his arms the
fastest in a windmill-like action wins with a little luck.
Wildman-Tobriner, however — affectionately nicknamed
"Wild Man" by his former Stanford swim teammates — does
everything in his power to make his own luck.
He puts in 6,000 to 7,000 meters per day, lifts weights two to
three times each week and does a variety of dry-land exercise
as part of daily training. That's about 130 laps in the pool, four
miles per day (or 28 miles per week) and five hours per day (35
hours each week) dedicated to mastering his craft.
It's all for a lightning-quick sprint race that takes just over
20 seconds to complete. Wildman-Tobriner rehearses all the
details of the sprint during practice so that he can achieve the
perfect race: the start, the streamline, the sprint and the finish.
In the 50, any slight mistake during any part of the race means
certain defeat. The race is simply too short and Wildman-
Tobriner's opponents too skilled to allow for any mistakes — it
is merciless in its brevity.
That's not to say the Olympic swimmer has not had some
luck.
"You can't control what other people do, and in events
where an entire field of eight is separated by less than two
tenths of a second, a little bit of luck is going to play into it,"he
told NBC.
Wildman-Tobriner can also be considered lucky for his
four-year Spcedo contract, which allows him to continue doing
what 99 percent of college swimmers never achieve — work as
a professional swimmer.
In the world of swimming, where major media coverage
comes around every four years and glamorous endorsement
deals are nonexistent (except, perhaps, in the rare case of
Michael Phelps), the 6-foot-4, 200-pound Wildman-Tobriner
has become one of the new faces of American sprint swimming.
The much-needed Olympic spotlight also brings in pressure as

Wildman-Tobriner, along with sprint stars Garrett Weber-
Gale, Cullen Jones and Jason Lezak are expected to play a
major role in Team USA's sprint freestyle medal haul in
Beijing, as well as bring in the gold for the 4xloom freestyle
relay team and end its 12-year gold medal drought.
Wildman-Tobriner has already piled up quite a list of
achievements in the world of swimming, making for a full tro
phy-case. He is a 20-time NCAA All-American and also boasts
two World Championship gold medals in the 4xloo relay and
the 50m freestyle individual event at the 2007 Melbourne
World Swimming Championships. Despite being a relative
unknown on the international scene, Wildman-Tobriner
defeated world class swimmers including fellow American
Cullen Jones and Sweden's Stefan Nystrand. The World
Championships are considered the second biggest stage in
swimming, next to the Olympics.
"Winning the 50 free in Melbourne was an amazing experi
ence and [it] did a whole lot for my confidence," Wildman-
Tobriner said to NBC. "Just to know that I could go up against
the best in the world and compete, it puts the whole [Olympic
process] in perspective."
With the Beijing Games opening tomorrow, he will have to
perform again on swimming's biggest stage. Wildman-
Tobriner will be considered much less of an underdog than he
was in Melbourne, but his main competitors this time around
include world record-holder Eamon Sullivan of Australia,
European record-holder Amaury Leaveaux of France, 100 m
freestyle world record-holder Alain Bernard and old rival
Cesar Cielo of Brazil, whom Wildman-Tobriner finished sec
ond to in both the 50 and 100-yard freestyles at the 2007
NCAA championships.
"The Wild Man" will begin his Olympic quest on Sunday in
Beijing, where he will swim in the heats of the 4xloom freestyle
relay, an event the U.S. has not won for two consecutive
Olympics; the U.S. men, led by its young sprint stars, are
favored to take home the gold.
