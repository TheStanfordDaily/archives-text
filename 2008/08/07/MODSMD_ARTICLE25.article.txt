## OUT OF THE BUBBLE OLD-TIME FILMS ARE NEW AGAIN 
### EMMA MARTIN DAILY VISITING INTERN 
As students walk down
University Avenue in Palo Alto,
few even glance up at the
Stanford Theatre marquee
before heading to more popular
gathering places such as Red
Mango or Pluto's.
Passersby, however, are miss
ing a vibrant historical landmark
of the Stanford community. If
they ventured into the Art Deco
building, they would be greeted
with red leather seats, high paint
ed ceilings and an organist who
rises from the floor to play
before and after each (for the
most part) black-and-white
movie showing. The theater
offers a welcoming environment
for all ages.
Even though it is located in
Palo Alto, the Stanford Theatre
"has always been called the
Stanford Theatre since the 19205,
because it's a part of the college
community," said Cyndi
Mortensen, Stanford Theatre
Foundation manager.
Built in 1925 as the Peninsula
Premier Movie Palace, the 1,250-
seat theater was designed by
architects William Day and
Charles Peter Weeks, who also
created the Mark Hopkins and
St. Francis Hotels and the
California Theater in San Jose.
Throughout its life, the Stanford
Theatre has functioned as mainly
a movie theater; however,
according to Mortensen, it also
showed live theater for a brief
time.
In 1987, David W. Packard

(son of David Packard, founder
of the Hewlett-Packard
Company) wanted to pay tribute
to the death of the actor and
dancer Fred Astaire. Packard
rented the Stanford Theatre for
two weeks and showed 26 of
Astaire's films. The showings
were a success: Three sold out,
total attendance was 13,(X)0 and
$50,000 was raised for charity.
Packard and the Packard
Foundation purchased the the
ater in 1988 and restored it to its
1920s splendor. They also
formed the non-profit Stanford
Theatre Foundation to run the
newly opened business.

Today, the Stanford Theatre
plays classic Hollywood films
each day of the week. Its founda
tion hopes to "recreate the
movie-going experience of the

1920s and 305," said Mortensen.
They choose films from that era
to show "because the pre-1950s
was the height of the Golden
Age," she added.
For example, the Stanford
Theatre will be showing a double
feature of Jimmy Stewart's "The
Naked Spur" (1953) and
"Broken Arrow" (1950) this
weekend. Both movies are
Westerns. Next Wednesday,
Aug. 13, the theater will feature
silent film "Broken Blossoms"
(1919). The organ will be playing
throughout the silent film.
Besides hoping to expose
people to the Golden Age of
movies, the Stanford Theater
Foundation hopes to educate its
guests about the art of early
films.
"We want to make people
aware of the need to preserve the
old films," explained Mortensen.
"It's not a permanent art form."
The founder of the Stanford
Theatre Foundation, Packard,
agrees. In 1988, he told The New
York Times, "Gradually, people
arc going to realize that these
films are that important. When
the classical scholars look back
on the 20th century 1,000 years
from now, what are they going to
find valuable?" The movies of
the Golden Age.
The next time you're wander
ing to your favorite restaurant in
Palo Alto, stop by the historical
Stanford Theatre to experience
what theatergoing used to be all
about.
