# LOCAL EATS
## Authentic Mexican fare makes close quarters worth it 
### TOMMY TOBIN 
In Menlo Park, right off Santa Cruz
Avenue, rests Cafe Del Sol, a down-home
Mexican eatery. With moderately reasonable
prices (about $12 to $20 per dish), diners
expect a good meal — and they get one. The
restaurant serves up some great fare, with
high-quality ingredients and complimentary
taquitos. The Cafe is a tasty spot for some

grub and a good place to take a friend for
dinner.
Sitting in my wobbly table, 1 started look
ing around the place. Noticing the decor,
among it crooked paintings of fruit, 1 though
it could use some attention, but it's also a
simple sign — this place eatery focuses less
on its appearance and feel and more on the
food. The ambiance certainly doesn't add to
the dining experience. The tables are so closc
together that it was difficult even for my
somewhat-slim frame to fit into the chair
without moving the table. With the close
quarters and thoughtless decoration, though,
is the food worth it?
Yes. While there has been some chatter
on the Internet, particularly on yelp.com,
about the restaurant's service (or lack there
of), the service is more than acceptable. The
wait staff is responsive, and it isn't much of a
concern anyway as the experience is centered

moreso around the food.
The menu is reasonable, but not exten
sive. There aren't terribly many vegetarian
options and they are not clearly identified. At
first glance, the offerings seem seafood
heavy. However, there are several turf
options, ranging from beef tacos to filet
mignon.
Diners should note when upon sitting
down, complimentary taquitos are served in
lieu of the usual chips and dip. These taquitos
are served for quality, not quantity. To sup
plement them, order the nachos. The
Chicken Nachos arc an excellent choice,
served with chips, guacamole and other top
pings arranged in the shape of the sun. The
Shrimp Del Sol is also a good call, especially
with the sweet mango sauce to compliment
the saltiness of the grilled shrimp.
As for the soups, the options are limited,
with only two offerings. The Chicken Soup is

dccently tasty, with little pizzazz save two
peppers that strike you when you are least
expecting them.
The entrees are strong. El Combo is a col
orful plateful of food, with cilantro green
rice, beans, guacamolc and choice of taco
and/or enchilada. The Fajita plate is made
with some high-quality meats and is tasty, full
of savory flavor. The additional items on the
plate, such as rice, beans and guacamole, are
among the Cafe's best — diners can taste the
freshness, with the creamy butteriness of
avocado coming through in every bite of the
guacamole.
Cafe Del Sol is located on 1010 Doyle
Street in Menlo Park. Reservations are not
required and parking is not bad, especially as
lots of spaces flank the restaurant on Santa
Cruz Avenue.
