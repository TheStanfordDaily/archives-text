## "Express" satisfies, needs more fuel Franco takes the cake, or shall we say brownie, in this summer' stoner flick 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Smoked-out films tend to be well intentioned. All
"Pineapple Express" wants to do is be as pleasant
and funny as a stoner comedy can be. The effort is
admirable, and even if it is far from a masterpiece,
there's no way to fault the film for its good inten
tions.
The movie opens with an admiring ode to its main
subject. White-collar worker Dale Denton (Seth
Rogen) stops by the apartment of his dealer, Saul Silver
(James Franco) to sample a new strain called pineapple
express. After Saul tries and fails to keep Dale there as
a friend and not simply a purchaser. Dale leaves, and
later that night witnesses a murder. Fleeing in a cough
ing fit of shock and smoke, he drops his joint, contain-

ing the titular herb.
The murderer, local
drug kingpin Ted
Jones (Gary Cole),
samples the joint and
recognizes his own
wares, pointing the
way directly to Saul
and Dale, who now
have to find a way to
not get murdered.

From here on out things get complicated, and the
intrigue-filled plot becomes both somewhat nonsensical
and completely beside the point. The movie riffs on all
the mainstays of standard-issue action films and appears
determined to make any possible situation as ridiculous
as possible.
A spirited rant from Jones about how he will murder
all of his enemies ends with him tickling his companion.
Dale interrogates Saul's supplier, Red (Danny R.
Mcßride), with a cactus. Most of a set-piece car chase
takes place with Saul's foot through a car window.
Summed up, no opportunity is missed to make things
sillier, and it helps that everyone looks like they're hav
ing a good time.
Rogen, somewhat confined in a straight-man role,
still tosses off choice one-liners throughout. Hanging
around and smoking makes a perfect set-up for spirited
improvisations, and Rogen particularly shines playing
off Franco. Mcßride makes an increasingly bizarre sup
porting role something special, and under-recognized
comedic talents Craig Robinson and Kevin Corrigan
contribute what they can as Jones' henchmen.
Most impressive of all is Franco, who nails his role
and consistently proves to be the most interesting char
acter, wearing an easygoing smile throughout and alter
nately embodying a concerned four-year-old or a
relaxed kitten. Even with a particularly manic conclu
sion, the strong performances let the film endure with
out the whole structure falling into a sea of accumulat
ed absurdity.
Still, for fans of the filmmakers, "Pineapple
Express" is a slight disappointment. The recent films
from the comedic collective that has loosely assembled
around producer Judd Apatow, including stand-outs
"The 40 Year-Old Virgin," "Knocked Up" and
"Superbad," were excellent, and "Express" fails to
meet their high standards. The rich characters and
confident plotting of these films provide a frame for
free-wheeling improvisation that sustains laughs and
interest, and much of its benefits wind up missing from
"Pineapple Express."
The movie's steadfast refusal to treat anything
remotely seriously makes quite a lot of sense, given the
story it tells; but the film loses the special, tender
hearted sincerity that made its kindred projects so suc
cessful. "Pineapple Express" gets its material too right,
mustering a charming and upbeat sensibility, but not
bringing about the sense of purpose to make it all
come together.
