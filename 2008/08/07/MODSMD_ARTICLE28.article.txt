# Doc "American Teen" tells all: high school still chock full of cliches

### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The stories in "American Teen" are old, familiar
narratives that are a part of the stubbornly persistent
stereotypes of the high-school experience. Director
Nanette Burstein descended on a public high school in
Warsaw, Ind. and filmed the jock, the nerd, the
princess, the outsider and the handsome guy for 10

Mitch, respectively — has the appropriate personality
and corresponding cliched goal as the film begins, and
the story follows each

requisite steps of
senior year and on
toward graduation.

feature the teens wearing the same outfits and sitting
in the same positions, the number of serendipitous
close-ups surpasses normal good fortune and the com
plete nonchalance of non-lead characters when faced
with a camera all testify to the movie playing games
with whatever really happened. All documentaries do
this, however, and no one would expect Burstein to
torpedo the careful efforts of her marketers.

the nerd, rockets awkwardness at any available target.
Megan, royalty within a petty and small-minded social
structure, does petty and small-minded things to
assert her position. Even external events and institu-

SMOKED UP: Seth Rogen and James Franco team up in "Pineapple Express." The highly anticipated film promises run-of-the-mill
action sequences and plenty of jokes of the green persuasion. Though audiences may not be too surprised by the plot, Franco delivers
a praiseworthy performance, and Rogen offers classic comedy in an area he knows all too well.
