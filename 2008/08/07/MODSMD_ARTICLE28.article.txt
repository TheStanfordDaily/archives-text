# Doc "American Teen" tells all: high school still chock full of cliches
## 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The stories in "American Teen" are old, familiar
narratives that are a part of the stubbornly persistent
stereotypes of the high-school experience. Director
Nanette Burstein descended on a public high school in
Warsaw, Ind. and filmed the jock, the nerd, the
princess, the outsider and the handsome guy for 10
months. Each lead — Colin, Jake, Megan, Hannah and
Mitch, respectively — has the appropriate personality
and corresponding cliched goal as the film begins, and
the story follows each

of them through the
requisite steps of
senior year and on
toward graduation.
The easy criticism
to make is that the
movie imposes and
fashions narratives
upon the less cooper
ative material of real

life. Burstein has claimed repeatedly that her film is
authentic and its episodes natural. She is lying.
Conversations supposedly taking place months apart
feature the teens wearing the same outfits and sitting
in the same positions, the number of serendipitous
close-ups surpasses normal good fortune and the com
plete nonchalance of non-lead characters when faced
with a camera all testify to the movie playing games
with whatever really happened. All documentaries do
this, however, and no one would expect Burstein to
torpedo the careful efforts of her marketers.
"American Teen" truly sins by being relentlessly
tedious. The five leads display an impressive dedica
tion to act exactly as expected in any situation. Jake,
the nerd, rockets awkwardness at any available target.
Megan, royalty within a petty and small-minded social
structure, does petty and small-minded things to
assert her position. Even external events and institu-

SMOKED UP: Seth Rogen and James Franco team up in "Pineapple Express." The highly anticipated film promises run-of-the-mill
action sequences and plenty of jokes of the green persuasion. Though audiences may not be too surprised by the plot, Franco delivers
a praiseworthy performance, and Rogen offers classic comedy in an area he knows all too well.

tions are accommodating, from the
three-point defense of Warsaw's
basketball rivals to the decisions
made by their colleges of choice.
It is tempting to give Burstein
the benefit of the doubt here and
say that she had the dismal luck to
choose a town and a cast too typical
for its own good. But the deliberate
choice of characters who fit the
grand stereotypes, the manipula
tion of the footage and her enthusi
astic acceptance of face-value
labels and situations indicate that
she mostly got the movie she want
ed.
When the students freely specu
late about their lives and futures,
Burstein avoids inconvenient com
plexity by laying their words over
simplistic animated sequences; she
transforms vulnerable and reveal
ing speculation into illustrations of
how misguided they are. Wherever
the rote run-through of life at its
most routine was supposed to lead
us, we certainly arrive, though the

film is too polite to tell us anything
about what this accomplishes. Nor
do we learn much about the inner
lives of the documentary's cast,
who weren't allowed to venture
off-script. They're clearly real and
sympathetic people, but this is
inferred rather than demonstrated.
None of this, of course, will pre
vent "American Teen" from
receiving dutiful accolades. A cho
rus of people far removed from
high school will seize upon their
reasons to lavish it with praise, and
that is okay. The film's barely-con
cealed contempt for the real peo
ple it follows and self-satisfaction
at its run through old standards is
harmless. The production left no
one's life in ruins, and the film can
not even manage to be offensive. It
is merely lazy. Burstein is system
atic and dogged in her dedication
to ignore, wall up and otherwise
avoid the rough edges of life at its
most interesting. If there is any
thing of high-school experience
that the film evokes perfectly, as its
now-graduated subjects could
attest, it is the grim monotony of a
study hall.
