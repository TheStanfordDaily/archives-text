## HOSPITAL & CLINICS Hospital, workers argue union status SEIU no longer recognized; workers pursue new election

Stanford Hospital and Lucile Packard
Children's I lospital announced last week that
they will no longer recognize Service
Employees International Union Local 715,
sparking controversy between hospital admin
istrators and healthcare workers. Affected
workers have since filed for new union repre
sentation.
In 1998, SEIU Local 715 was elected by
Stanford healthcare workers to represent
approximately 1,450 non-technical employ
ees, including housekeepers, food service
workers, nursing assistants, phlebotomists,
unit secretaries and transporters.
Stanford representatives withdrew recog
nition of SEIU Local 715 due to internal con
fusions within the union itself.
' SEIU had a lot of internal transfers and
movements," said Sarah Staley, director of
communications for Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital. "Since March of 2007, we
have repeatedly attempted to contact Local
715 to prove if they are still in existence. Due
to their lack of responsiveness, and due large
ly to the fact that they have failed to represent
our employees — which they had been elect
ed to do — we feel it is necessary to withdraw
our recognition of them."
There certainly has been a lot of internal
activity by the union; in 2006, five local unions
were merged, including SEIU Local 715 and
United Healthcare Workers. This formed the
SEIU United Healthcare Workers-West
union, which represents over 150,000 health
care employees and is one of the largest grow
ing hospital and healthcare unions in the west
ern United States.
Still, union representatives don't think that

the mergers justify Stanford's latest actions.
"This is only the latest attempt in
Stanford's high-priced attorneys' efforts to
avoid recognition of healthcare workers'
rights," said United Healthcare Workers vice
president John Borsos.
Staley disagrees, pointing out the techni
calities of the union election.
"Our employees only elected SEIU Local
715 as union representatives," she said. "Thus,
we can only work with that union."

"We can't recognize...
any organization
other than that which
has been elected by
our employees."

Stanford hospital representatives also
pointed out that healthcare employees are
free to hold another election to elect a new
healthcare union.
"Theoretically, healthcare employees can
join another union, but fairness and law
requires that they will have another election
to obtain that representation," Staley said.
"We can't recognize or work with any organi
zation other than that which has been elected
by our employees."
However, Stanford officials argue that
union representation does not fundamentally
affect healthcare workers' compensation or
representation in the hospital, and that former
union members will not be affected by
Stanford's decision to no longer recognize
SEIU Local 715.
"Our hospitals remain committed to com-
