# Stanford in Redwood City
## University plans satellite campus for administrative shuffling 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At 8,180 acres, Stanford has the
largest contiguous university campus in
America â€” and a planned off-campus
expansion means that it's about to get
bigger. With usable space on campus
running out, a 1.5 million-square foot
Redwood City expansion is in the
works.
The University has already pur
chased and submitted plans for a 33-
acre satellite campus between
Broadway and Highway 101 in
Redwood City. These 33 acres, in addi
tion to the 11-acre outpatient medical
facility that is currently being con
structed in the same plot, will become
part of a larger 46-acre "Stanford in

Redwood City" campus, located at
Midpoint Technology Park.
Larry Horton, the University's
director of government and communi
ty relations, explained that the estab
lishment of a satellite campus comes
from the University's desire to priori
tize on-campus space.
"The on-campus core space is limit
ed and extremely precious," Horton
said. "The priority for core, on-campus
space should be teaching and research.
Thus, some important University activ
ities that can be performed off-campus
will be relocated to the Redwood City
campus."
Stanford has submitted a design
plan to the Redwood City Planning
Commission calling for the existing
buildings on the purchased 33 acres to

be replaced with 13 new buildings for
administrative offices, research and
development and medical clinic uses.
Though plans for construction on
the North Campus are still being dis
cussed between the University and the
Redwood City Council, some adminis
trative functions are already being
moved away from campus.
University offices located in 655 and
656 Serra Street on the Stanford cam
pus have already been relocated to the
Stanford Research Park, west of El
Camino. The spaces cleared by 655 and
656 Serra Street will be used for the
construction of new buildings for the
Graduate School of Business.
Horton emphasized that University
personnel relocated to Redwood
City are not being shunned to off
campus locations.
"Stanford wants to construct
good quarters in Redwood City and
make it highly desirable for staff to
be there," Horton said. "We want
the satellite campus to be a true
extension to the core campus. The
office buildings constructed there
will have many amenities, including
child care, a gym, et cetera."
Furthermore, Stanford hopes to
become a contributing member of
the Redwood City community once
that campus is established.
Stanford's project proposal com
posed was submitted to Redwood
City in late May. Though the
Redwood City Planning
Commission has kicked off the
approval process, a decision won't
be reached until later this month.
With residential and light indus
trial areas bordering the North
Campus plot, however, a number of
concerns will have to be addressed
before any construction can begin.
"Of course we will confront dif
ferent issues, such as environmental
impact reports and concerns about
traffic," Horton said. "But we are
confident that we will be able to
determine these impacts, re-exam
ine the project, and correctly
address them. Stanford's presence
in Redwood City will be a positive
one."
