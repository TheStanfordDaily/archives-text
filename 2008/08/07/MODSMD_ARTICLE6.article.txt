## Housing assures fall quarter spaces On-campus housing expected for all undergrads 
### RYAN MAC CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students worried about securing on
campus housing for the coming quarter
can breathe a collective sigh of relief,
according to Student Housing officials.
While a recent extension of the deadline
for assignment cancellation might have
given nervous students the feeling that
on-campus spaces was scarce, Housing
insists that all undergraduates should
expect to have a place to live on campus
come fall.
On Monday, officials pushed back
the housing cancellation deadline to
Aug. 8 — creating the impression that
the Housing Office needed for more
undergraduates to drop due to the
unusually large number of students
(122) not assigned housing after the
Draw. However, this was not the case.
Director of Housing Offices and
Front Desks Sue Nunan said that the
decision to extend the deadline was

made to avoid confusion over changed
policies, not to signify impending set
backs in the undergraduate housing situ
ation.
"In an effort to improve service to
students this year and simplify our draw
process, we had students sign their
Resident Agreement when they applied
for housing," Nunan wrote in an email to
The Weekly. "In the past, students had
to sign their contract after being
assigned, and we wanted to avoid stu
dents having to take this extra step. We
frequently change deadlines when poli
cies change in an effort to be sure stu
dents are fully aware of what action they
need to take to avoid an extra fee."
In fact, housing assignments seem to
be right on track. Rodger Whitney, exec
utive director of student housing, firmly
believes that the University will be able
to provide housing to all eligible under
graduates by fall quarter.
"We fully anticipate that we will be
able to house all undergraduate students
who are waiting for housing at this time
and encourage any undergraduate still
seeking housing to apply for autumn
quarter through the Housing
Assignments office," Whitney said.
"The number of freshman students
has gone down and we have fewer
undergraduate students unassigned
this year than last year at this time."
According to Assignments
Supervisor Christopher Collinson,
there are currently only 55 under
graduates who have not been
assigned housing, and of those stu
dents, 23 have exceeded their four
years of guaranteed housing on
campus. Furthermore, with the pos
sibility of more cancellations and
the addition of extra space at
Crothers Hall, Housing seems to be
prepared to accommodate the
undergraduate population.
"Up to this time we have had
about 60 undergraduate cancella
tions since the Draw and have
added additional spaces at Crothers
Hall for Autumn Quarter,"
Collinson wrote in an email to The
Weekly. "As you recall, students
assigned to Crothers will have a firm
priority to Xanadu when it opens
Winter Quarter."
The University has also provided
graduate students with a variety of

options. With the Munger housing
complex opening in autumn 2009 as
well as the numerous other on-cam
pus grad residences, Stanford will be
able to provide a little under 60 per
cent of its graduate students with
housing, more than most other
schools.
And for those grads looking for
off-campus accommodations,
Housing is always looking to help.
Whitney recognized some gradu
ates' desires to live away from the
Farm and mentioned that his office
is always willing to help searching
students even given market condi
tions.
"There will always be some per
centage of graduate students who
will seek off-campus housing, unlike
the undergraduate students," he
said. "As a side note, the local mar
ket is relatively stable at this time
and hasn't changed significantly in
the last 12 months."
Undergraduate students still
looking for on-campus housing
should call (650) 725-2810 or write
to housingassignments@lists.Stan
ford.edu. Graduate students looking
for off-campus housing should call
the Community Housing Office at
(650) 723-3906 or write to communi
tyhousing@lists.stanford.edu.
