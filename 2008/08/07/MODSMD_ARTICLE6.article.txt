## Housing assures fall quarter spaces On-campus housing expected for all undergrads 
### RYAN MAC CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Students worried about securing on
campus housing for the coming quarter
can breathe a collective sigh of relief,
according to Student Housing officials.
While a recent extension of the deadline
for assignment cancellation might have
given nervous students the feeling that
on-campus spaces was scarce, Housing
insists that all undergraduates should
expect to have a place to live on campus
come fall.
On Monday, officials pushed back
the housing cancellation deadline to
Aug. 8 â€” creating the impression that
the Housing Office needed for more
undergraduates to drop due to the
unusually large number of students
(122) not assigned housing after the
Draw. However, this was not the case.
Director of Housing Offices and
Front Desks Sue Nunan said that the
decision to extend the deadline was

made to avoid confusion over changed
policies, not to signify impending set
backs in the undergraduate housing situ
ation.
"In an effort to improve service to
students this year and simplify our draw
process, we had students sign their
Resident Agreement when they applied
for housing," Nunan wrote in an email to
The Weekly. "In the past, students had
to sign their contract after being
assigned, and we wanted to avoid stu
dents having to take this extra step. We
frequently change deadlines when poli
cies change in an effort to be sure stu
dents are fully aware of what action they
need to take to avoid an extra fee."
In fact, housing assignments seem to
be right on track. Rodger Whitney, exec
utive director of student housing, firmly
believes that the University will be able
to provide housing to all eligible under
graduates by fall quarter.
"We fully anticipate that we will be
able to house all undergraduate students
who are waiting for housing at this time
and encourage any undergraduate still
seeking housing to apply for autumn
