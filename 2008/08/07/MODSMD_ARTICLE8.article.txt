## Stanford set to host Senior Games in 2009 Bay Area will host more athletes then Beijing next year 
### MILES OSGOOD 
The Beijing Olympic Games are just one day
away, but a group of organizers and University offi
cials arc counting down to a different athletic com
petition. Last Friday marked the beginning of a
one-year countdown to the 2009 Senior Games,
which will be held at Stanford and the surrounding
Bay Area.
The games — which will bring over 12,000 ath
letes and $35 million to the Bay Area — have
required four years of logistical planning since the
bid to host the games was won over sites in the
Houston area.
In 21 states, including California, senior athletes
have already qualified for the Games' 18 medal
sports. Participants compete in age brackets from
50+ to 75+ in sports ranging from triathlon to horse
shoes. Over the Games' 15 days, 17 of the 25 sports

will take place at Stanford.
To prepare for the games. Bay Area organizers
have held regional competitions each March since
2005. Stanford campus itself is no stranger to
Olympic-sized contests. The old stadium housed
World Cup matches and Olympic trials; two years
ago, the Avery Aquatic Center hosted 7,500 swim
mers for the 10-day FIN A World Championships.
"The venues we can offer the athletes are
incredible," said Local Organizing Committee
(LOC) President Anne Cribbs '79. "Our goal has
always been to provide the best competition condi
tions for athletes. The selection committee saw
[the] Stanford campus — they were thrilled."
While Stanford facilities are world-class, the task
of preparing them for 12,000 athletes — more than
the number expected in Beijing — is daunting.
"Think about the senior games as being 18
national championships," Cribbs said.
As 35,000 athletes and family members arrive in
the Bay Area, the LOC predicts a direct economic
impact greater than Louisville's in 2007 — a $30
million profit. While visitors spend around the Bay
Area, corporate sponsors will help keep tickets free

for local spectators.
The games are expected to become the largest
multi-sport event in Bay Area history, but organiz
ers are especially focused on making them the
greenest. Plans include stainless steel water bottles,
hydration stations, local farmers' markets, dorm
housing and widespread public transportation.
Even the torch will be carbon-free.
"We have a commitment to make sure these
games are green, to reduce our footprint on the
environment," Cribbs said.
The LOC also stands by a commitment to the
community. Cribbs hopes that the Games will
encourage an aging population to stay active and
athletically competitive. The seven performance
sports arc open to all seniors who register.
Organizers also predict that the Games will
bring together Bay Area natives in support of their
neighbors.
"We are looking forward to having Northern
California come, cheer on the athletes and be
inspired by their achievements," Cribbs said.
