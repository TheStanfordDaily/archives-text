## Study analyzes gov. restrictions on Univ. research 
### SCOTT BLAND SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Federally funded university research —
including grants offered to Stanford — con
tinues to be subject to controversial restric
tions set by the U.S. government, according
to a recent report.
Prepared jointly by the Council on
Governmental Relations (COGR) and the
American Association of Universities
(AAU), the study tallied 180 "troublesome
clauses" found in federal research grants or
contracts by a group of 20 research universi
ties from July through December 2007. All
incidents were self-reported by the universi
ties participating in the study.
"Troublesome clauses" refer to sections
of research grants that impose restrictions
on the ability of foreign students to work on
the projects or require government review
of research findings before publication.
Though this is accepted practice for certain
projects, the clauses are increasingly found

in contracts relating to "fundamental
research" — initial discovery research done
to expand knowledge, not for practical con
siderations.
Stanford reported three such clauses in
the period covered by the study. The
University of Maryland, College Park led
the way with 33 reports.
According to Anne Hannigan, director of
the office of research administration, the three
contracts were for research for the Federal

research, we just have certain projects that
we won't even apply for."

Aviation Administration, the U.S. Air Force
and a company subcontracting work for the
Department of Energy. Two of the contracts
contained foreign national restrictions and the
other had a publication control.
Hannigan said that the University suc
cessfully negotiated to have each of the
clauses removed and retained the contracts
without compromising Stanford's policies
on academic freedom.

could not be reached by press time.
There has always been friction between
government institutions demanding a devo
tion to national security and universities
insistent on unencumbered research and
academic freedom, but the past decade has
seen an upsurge in conflict between the two.
"There's certainly been an increase in
troublesome clauses in the last six or seven
years, post-9/11 really," Hannigan said.
The COGR report 3 follow-up on a
previous study conduct' ( »vith the same 20
universities over a six-month period starting
in August 2003. That report, issued in 2004,
found 138 troublesome clauses. The increase
between reports is due to a spike in publica
tion restrictions such as export clauses,
which prevent overseas dissemination of
research reports and articles.
Stanford has managed to weather the con
flict relatively well compared to other univer
sities, reporting only one third of the average
