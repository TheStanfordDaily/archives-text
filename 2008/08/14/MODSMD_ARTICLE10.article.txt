## This Stanford Life The 						Stanford Brand Paul Craft 
### 
For the better part of this sum
mer, I've worked at the
Stanford Bookstore. More
specifically, I've worked in the
Bookstore's official apparel section.
You know, that area on the second
floor covered with red and white
sweatshirts as far as the eye can see.
(Seriously, if you want a red T-shirt,
there is no better place in the Bay
Area.)
Most people would say that I am
just a "folder" or, at best, a "clerk."
But I look at myself as something
much more: a "retail ambassador." I
sell not only fine cotton apparel man
ufactured in exotic places like
Honduras and Hong Kong, I also sell
this university.
The Stanford Bookstore, perhaps
more than anywhere else on campus,
demonstrates that that our university
sells itself as a brand. This is not nec
essarily a bad thing — we have a lot
to sell to prospective students, facul
ty and staff. But sometimes, after a
few hours of folding, deprived of nat
ural light and hydration, 1 imagine
that I'm actually at Abercrombie and
Fitch. For a moment, all I can sec is
the same logo in dozens of minor
variations, each piece of clothing sup
posedly representing a lifestyle,
promising to make each owner more
special and elite.
The majority of our summer sta
tus-seekers are tourists, summer
camp kids and conference partici
pants. The customers come in look

ing to buy a little piece of Stanford's
enormously positive reputation. The
clothing itself sometimes get a mixed
reaction — "Do you have this in
XXX-Large?," "Is this fleece pull
over really worth $96?" or "Do you
have this particular logo, but on a
dark green, spandex jumpsuit?" On
the other hand, Stanford University
itself is inevitably treated with
respect and enthusiasm.
Summer camp kids are the most
eager to buy into our brand. They
shuttle in and out of the store, Jamba
Juices in hand, cliques in chase.
Sometimes they debate the finer
points between schools. ("USC is
better at film," said one kid, while
another kid skillfully replied "Yeah,
but Stanford is Stanford.")
Sometimes they dream out loud
about applying here. I've fielded
dozens of detailed questions about
the admissions process. (I think one
camp attendee wanted me to write
him a recommendation.) All in all,
Stanford's prospects look bright with
the tween and teen crowd.
Foreign tourists are also surpris
ingly eager to buy into our brand.
(Economically-speaking, with the
weakness of the dollar, it makes
sense.) European visitors are more
frequent than expected, but they also
manage to restrain their enthusiasm.
Most of them shuffle in as a family or
couple, poke around and then leave.
Chinese and Korean tour groups,
however, make a scene. They tend to
stream in as huge groups. First, they
thoroughly inspect the clothing, ask
ing questions about quality and size
and maybe even try to barter for a
lower price. They often seem to have

not just a respect, but a reverence for
our university.
Occasionally, this brand-rever
ence gets a bit out of control. Once, a
family was discussing what to buy.
Their little girl, who looked about
five, was playing nearby. The father
leaned down and said, "Do you want
this Stanford shirt, honey?"
Suddenly looking up with elation the
girl said, "Stanford! Wow!
Stanford!" When our brand res
onates with the preschool set, maybe
we've gone too far.
Even so, I am proud to be an
apparel ambassador. Watching all
this, I can't help but swell up with
pride for our brand. I love Stanford

and the shoppers love Stanford — we
are both on the same page. (If any
thing, it makes me want to start my
own huge research university.
Imagine all the "Paul Craft" sweat
shirts. Glorious.) Indeed, I often pic
ture Leland Stanford, Jr. standing in
the apparel section, looking out at all
the clothing in his honor. Somehow, 1
think he'd be proud of our brand, too.

Paul is filled with so much Stanford
pride that he might even begin selling
knock-off versions of official Stanford
apparel. To offer funds for his new
business, or to comment on this col
umn, please email Paul at pcraft®
