For the better part of this sum
mer, I've worked at the
Stanford Bookstore. More
specifically, I've worked in the
Bookstore's official apparel section.
You know, that area on the second
floor covered with red and white
sweatshirts as far as the eye can see.
(Seriously, if you want a red T-shirt,
there is no better place in the Bay
Area.)
Most people would say that I am
just a "folder" or, at best, a "clerk."
But I look at myself as something
much more: a "retail ambassador." I
sell not only fine cotton apparel man
ufactured in exotic places like
Honduras and Hong Kong, I also sell
this university.
The Stanford Bookstore, perhaps
more than anywhere else on campus,
demonstrates that that our university
sells itself as a brand. This is not nec
essarily a bad thing — we have a lot
to sell to prospective students, facul
ty and staff. But sometimes, after a
few hours of folding, deprived of nat
ural light and hydration, 1 imagine
that I'm actually at Abercrombie and
Fitch. For a moment, all I can sec is
the same logo in dozens of minor
variations, each piece of clothing sup
posedly representing a lifestyle,
promising to make each owner more
special and elite.
The majority of our summer sta
tus-seekers are tourists, summer
camp kids and conference partici
pants. The customers come in look

ing to buy a little piece of Stanford's
enormously positive reputation. The
clothing itself sometimes get a mixed
reaction — "Do you have this in
XXX-Large?," "Is this fleece pull
over really worth $96?" or "Do you
have this particular logo, but on a
dark green, spandex jumpsuit?" On
the other hand, Stanford University
itself is inevitably treated with
respect and enthusiasm.
Summer camp kids are the most
eager to buy into our brand. They
shuttle in and out of the store, Jamba
Juices in hand, cliques in chase.
Sometimes they debate the finer
points between schools. ("USC is
better at film," said one kid, while
another kid skillfully replied "Yeah,
but Stanford is Stanford.")
Sometimes they dream out loud
about applying here. I've fielded
dozens of detailed questions about
the admissions process. (I think one
camp attendee wanted me to write
him a recommendation.) All in all,
Stanford's prospects look bright with
the tween and teen crowd.
Foreign tourists are also surpris
ingly eager to buy into our brand.
(Economically-speaking, with the
weakness of the dollar, it makes
sense.) European visitors are more
