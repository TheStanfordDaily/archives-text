## America and China at the Olympics 
### 
In the spring, I wrote a column
attacking the Olympics for being
over-politicized and over-cov
ered by the media. China's refusal to
allow Taiwan to march under its own
flag and the fact that The New York
Times sent 32 reporters to the
Games demonstrates that politics
and the media are indeed too promi
nent at the Olympics. Despite all this
— and the endless wall-to-wall cov
erage of Michael Phelps — I've
found myself enjoying this Olympics.
The Beijing Olympics, despite the
best attempts of its organizers to
hide everything other than a careful
ly crafted image, has revealed a great
deal about China today.
The women's gymnastics compe
tition was particularly illuminating.
Bela Karolyi's allegations that some
of the Chinese gymnasts were under
age seems legitimate considering the
physical appearance of the girls as
well as the admission of a former
Chinese gymnast on state-owned
television that she competed at 14
years old, two years under the legal
limit, in the 2000 Sydney Games. It
seems highly unlikely that the
International Olympic Committee
(IOC), which is reaping huge rev
enues from these Olympics, will
investigate these claims. NBC, to its
credit, was more than happy to cover
the allegations of underage partici
pants, as the U.S. team — which fea
tures, as it always docs, rosy-cheeked
All-American girls — failed to over

come the Chinese gymnastics
machine.
The network, however, did not
cover any aspect of the protest in
Beijing that occurred less than a
half-mile from the "Bird's Nest,"
the main Olympic stadium. Several
foreign nationals were arrested,
and one accredited British journal
ist — not involved in the protest —
was treated very roughly by
Chinese police. His film was confis
cated. The protest, not surprisingly,
was reported to have lasted only
minutes, as the hundreds of plain
clothes policemen patrolling the
athletic centers swooped on the
protestors immediately. Beijing
organizers promised that the press
would have as much freedom as
other countries to cover events
inside the country, but that has
been anything but true. The lOC,
not wanting to endanger its own
enormous revenue from the
Olympics, has said nothing.
The protest took place in some
sort of "wonderland" for ethnic
minorities set up for visitors. Along
with China's rather bizarre use of
children in traditional ethnic dress

during the opening ceremonies, the
Olympics have underscored China's
token treatment of minorities. The
continuing terrorist attacks by
Muslim minorities in western China,
which the media has been essentially
unable to cover, have offered us a
rare opening to see how the majority
Han perceive their own minorities
— mostly as foreign, caricatured
curiosities, it seems. Although the
terrorist attacks are unlawful and
immoral, the Chinese Communist
Party (CCP) seems disinclined to
recognize Muslim minorities as any
thing more than illegitimate nui
sances.
The Olympics, finally, have
shown the extent of China's nation
alism, although that nationalism
might not be larger than other coun
tries'. I was watching a men's volley
ball game between the U.S. and
Venezuela, and the mostly Chinese
crowd was firmly behind Venezuela.
The American announcers pretend
ed that the Chinese just didn't want a
sweep, but it was clear that they were
rooting against the U.S. This is not in
itself a bad thing, but Americans
have consistently underestimated
Chinese nationalism, which has been
on display during these Olympics.
Phelps' events at the Water Cube
have, conspicuously, many unfilled
seats. China's lack of interest in
watching a dominant swimmer is
