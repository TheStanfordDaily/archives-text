## Antibiotics and Depression Runyan 
### 
I think this is something that
everyone needs to know, yet is
hardly discussed: Antibiotics
can cause depression.
I became aware of this last
January, when I took Flagyl
(metronidazole) and started feeling
probably the worst 1 have felt in my
life. When nothing seemed to
explain my change in mood, I real
ized that my antibiotic might be to
blame, and sure enough, an Internet
search revealed that other people
have become extremely depressed
— even suicidal —on metronida
zole and many other antibiotics.
With that knowledge, I asked my
doctor (who had not heard of this
side effect) if I could stop the med
ication early, and I soon felt better.
But what if I hadn't realized that
antibiotics can cause depression? I
might have made poor choices,
thinking something else was causing
my depression. Sometimes people

commit suicide on antibiotics. For
example, there have been so many
cases of suicide on the acne medica
tion Accutane that there was a
Congressional investigation into the
matter.
Still, however, the connection
between antibiotics and depression
is rarely mentioned in mainstream
sources. When you search for this
topic online, you'll find plenty of
forum posts and mentions in long
lists of antibiotic side effects, but
you'll see hardly any mention in
health writing or patient education.
People know that antibiotics can
cause digestive symptoms and yeast
infections, but it's not widely known
that they can cause depression. For
example, when I told my pharma
cist 1 was feeling depressed on
Flagyl, she said "But it's an antibiot
ic — it can't be making you
depressed."
1 think it's essential for anyone
who might take, prescribe, or
dispsense an antibiotic (which
means most of us) to be aware that
antibiotics can cause depression
and other psychiatric side effects.
It's much easier to cope with
antibiotic-induced mood changes

when one knows that they are, in
fact, antibiotic-induced.
Several factors might con
tribute to depression on antibi
otics. First, there can be side
effects from the medication itself.
Additionally, there might be
depression from the change in gut
flora or from the loss of healthy
bacteria (which serve functions
such as producing and helping with
the absorption of certain vitamins).
It's been noted that gut bacteria can
affect mood. A report by Lowry et
al. in Neuroscience
(2007;146(2):756-772) found that
the soil microbe Mycobacterium
vaccae essentially improved the
mood of mice (as it had been found

to do in humans when it was tested
as a potential cancer treatment). In
contrast, Gaykenia et al. found that
an intestinal Campylobacter jejuni
infection made mice more anxious
(Brain, Behavior, and Immunity
2004;18(3) :238-245).
Just as we have come to appreci
ate the mind-body connection more
in recent years, we may start to rec
ognize the bacteria-mind connec
tion. But we don't need to wait until
that happens to acknowledge and
make people aware of the antibiot
ic-depression connection.
