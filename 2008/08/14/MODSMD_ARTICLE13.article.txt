## FOOTBALL Pritchard takes the lead at QB 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY STAFF WRITER 
Sccond-year head football coach
Jim Harbaugh has chosen a starting
quarterback — for now.
Harbaugh tabbed rising senior
Tavita Pritchard to lead the offense,
with rising junior Alex Loukas and ris
ing senior Jason Forcier backing him
up as the second- and third-string
quarterbacks, respectively. 1 larbaugh
had previously decided on that same
order following spring practices.
In anticipation of Tuesday's intra
squad scrimmage, the first of the sum
mer, Harbaugh established a depth
chart for one of the Cardinal's most
unsettled positions, but also made
clear that it was only for the time
being and that Pritchard would not
necessarily be the starter come open
ing day against Oregon State, Aug. 28.
According to Pritchard, the three
QBs exhibit similar physical charac
teristics. What distinguished him from
the rest of the field, he said, was his
experience running the Stanford
offense under the pressure of game
situations.
"All three of us aren't that differ
ent; we're all mobile and like to move
around," Pritchard said. "It's the
experience, being able to play at the
speed of the game. It helps me get my
mind on it quickly, and really lets me

run the offense."
Pritchard saw action in nine con
tests last season and made the first
start of his career against then-No. 2
USC at the L.A. Coliseum. There he
led the Cardinal to a monumental,
come-from-behind 24-23 victory. He
started every game thereafter, with
one notable exception — Big Game
against Cal — but largely split time
with T.C. Ostrander '08 ewer that
span. Pritchard finished the season
with 1,114 passing yards.
In contrast, Loukas has yet to see
any action in two years on the Farm.
Forcier, who transferred from
Michigan after the 2006 season and
(because of NCAA rules) sat out for
the entirety of 2007, threw three pass
es during his career in Ann Arbor.
Still, Harbaugh emphasized that
despite the notable gulf in game-day
experience, there wasn't a lot separat
ing the three quarterbacks.
"There's not a huge difference
between the three of them,"
Harbaugh said. "We feel we have
three guys who we can win with. We
treat all of them as starters."
Pritchard concurred, saying that the
competition has brought out the best in
each of the QBs vying for the job.
"Everyone has been making plays
and running the offense," he said.
"[lt's] made our whole team confident
in all three of us."

With the vast majority of defensive
starters returning to the Farm, many
of the Cardinal's questions centered
around the offense and in particular,
the quarterback competition.
Pritchard was never able to complete
ly wrest the top spot on the depth
chart from Ostrander last year, and as
a result, he did not come into camp as
the starting 08.
In addition to the quarterback hat
tie, there were numerous holes in the
receiving corps following the gradua
tion of Mark Bradford '08, Stanford's
leading receiver last season and now a
member of the Dallas Cowboys, as
well as Evan Moore '08, now with the
Green Bay Packers.
But instead of falling into disarray,
rising junior Richard Sherman, a star

in the making, and numerous other
receivers — such as rising sopho
mores Doug Baldwin and Ryan
Whalen, and incoming freshmen
Chris Owusu and Warren Reuland —
have stepped up to help stabilize the
unit. Pritchard said that the offense
has already gelled and will continue to
come together over the rest of camp.
In hopes of continuing that
process, the Tacoma, Wash.-native
expects the remaining practices to be
as intense as always.
"Coach wants us to continue to
practice as we have been and not be
content," Pritchard said. "He wants us
to keep improving our skills."
In particular, Pritchard has focused

on the accuracy, release and timing of
his throws. He completed 50 percent
of his passes last season, a solid but
not outstanding percentage, but threw
nearly twice as many interceptions
(nine) as he did touchdowns (five).
On the whole, Pritchard said that

the offense has to take the "next step"
this year.
"We had flashes last year," he said.
"This year, it's about consistency. We
have to score in the red zone, for
example. We have to continue to
progress."
Alter Tuesday's scrimmage,
Harbaugh said that the team is
already exhibiting promising signs of
attaining that goal.
"We've had very little fluctuation
in our practices," he said. "I'm very

happy with the consistency we are
showing."
With only two weeks left until the
beginning of the season, Pritchard still
has plenty of work left in order to lock
down the starting job. But with many
passers and receivers displaying their
talent, the offense appears to be in
good hands — whosever hands those
wind up being.
