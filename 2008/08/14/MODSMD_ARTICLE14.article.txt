## Cape Cod League sharpens Cardinal talent 
### JACK DUANE STANFORD DAILY INTERN 
The position of closer is one of the least enviable
in sports. You come in when the game is close and
are expected to be impenetrable. Blow it, and
you're the scapegoat. A small lead can evaporate
with one swing of the bat and it will be your fault.
Stanford pitcher Drew Storen thrives in this sit
uation. Storen earned the closer's role last spring as
a freshman and didn't disappoint head coach Mark
Marquess. Armed with a 92 mile-per-hour fastball
and a deceiving curveball, the first-year sensation
had no problem adjusting to college competition.
Storen led the team with eight saves and posted an
impressive 5-3 record.
And he's not letting his skills rust during the off
season.
Along with Stanford teammates, rising seniors
Brent Milleville and Joey August and rising junior
Jeff Inman, Storen migrated to the East Coast for
the summer to compete in the Cape Cod Baseball
League. There, he has pitched for the Cotuit
Kettleers. With Stanford making a deep run to the
CWS, Storen went to Massachusetts right after the
college season ended.
The Cape Cod League is the premier amateur
summer baseball league. MLB scouts make an

annual pilgrimage to ihc eastern tip of
Massachusetts to watch college players battle it out
in a 10-team, wooden-bat league. The competition
is fierce and admission is free. Names are made
every year in the league, as players show off and
sharpen their skills in the most professional setting
this side of the amateur draft.
Storen's Kettleers made it to the Western
Division Series thanks in large part to his five saves
and 2.76 ERA. In Game 1, Storen closed out a 64
victory over the Falmouth Commodores. After a loss
and a rain out, the Kettleers needed a win on
Tuesday in Game 3 to advance to the Cape League
Championship series.
Lowell Park, Cotuit's home turf, is a well-mani
cured field surrounded by tall trees. Nearly 3,(XX) fans
were in attendance Tuesday, taking advantage of the
opportunity to watch future MLB stars for free. Kids,
wearing swimsuits and Crocs, punched their mitts
and waited for a foul ball to come zipping their way.
Falmouth jumped out to an early lead in the top
of the second inning, but Cotuit rallies in the third
inning to score what would be the team's last three
runs of the game. With his team winning, Storen
began his closer's routine.
"It all starts when I put my cleats on in the fifth
inning," he said. "Then I watch hitters."
After a few innings of watching, Storen began to

jog up and down the left field line. Both team's pitch
ers had settled down by the seventh inning and the
score was still 3-1. Storen knew that there would be
little room for error. As a freshman, he is one of the
youngest players in the league. And as for the advan
tage a pitcher has against wood, rather than alu
minum bats? It's less than you might think.
"1 haven't noticed [a difference]," Storen said. "1
think the fact that every hitter [in the league] bats
three or four for their college team balances it out."
Things stayed calm until Storen started warming
up. The bullpen catcher was a high-school kid and his
job was tough. Relatively small, at 6-foot-1 and 165
pounds, Storen hurled missiles from the base of the
mound to get warm. At this point, one didn't want to
mess with Drew Storen.
"1 love the closer mentality," he said. "[lt's] high
risk, high reward."
After throwing a few curveballs just to make sure
that the movement is still there, Storen took a seat to
consider the task at hand. A save would propel his
team into the championship. A rough outing would
mean the end of the season.
Kettleers Head Coach Mike Roberts called
Storen in from the bullpen.
It was only the eighth inning â€” Storen would
