## Wie has to step down to step up 
### 
Two weeks ago, Stanford fresh
man Michelle Wie once again
played in a tournament on the
PGA Tour, and once again she
failed to make the cut. Haven't we
heard this before?
But this one at least had an inter
esting background story to it.
Because the PGA Legends Reno
Tahoe Open took place at the same
time as the U.S. Women's British
Open, the same old questions had a
new spin. Why wasn't Wie overseas,
playing against her LPGA foes, try
ing to win her first major? Her status
on the LPGA Tour allows her to
enter the event as long as she quali
fies or gets a special exemption. But
here's the twist â€” she didn't even
qualify.
So she accepts an invitation to
play in a men's tournament (with a
run-down field) and goes on to miss
the cut by nine strokes. In fact, she's
yet to win an LPGA tournament,
but still she insists on playing on the
men's side. She missed the cut at the
U.S. Women's Open in June by six
shots, but she still tries to make the
cut in a PGA tournament.
Honestly, I'm just dumbfounded.
Wie is 0-for-48 in her attempts to
win her first women's event. If she
had won once or twice, I probably
would be writing something differ
ent right now. She has shown noth
ing that proves she is ready to play
against professional women, let
alone against professional men
where the courses are bigger and the
drives are longer.
Truthfully, it's not entirely her
fault. After all, the reason Wie gets
to play in a tournament is because of
a sponsor's exemption. That means
someone is allowing her to play in
tournaments.
Those spots should go to players
that actually have a chance, are try
ing to compete regularly or need the
money. Wie is trying to make a
name for herself, but at this point,
it's time to wonder what type of
name she's making.
I just don't get it. Wie doesn't
have any status on any tour. She
refuses to try to qualify for status on
the LPGA Tour. She can't even play
in college or amateur events becausc
of her professional status. Her only
hopes of playing in any tournaments
are through the sponsored exemp
tions. And, she still insists on playing
in PGA Tour tournaments?
You can't deny Wie's ability. She
is a good golfer, and any average joe
out there would be wrong to say that
she isn't. But good is just a tad high
