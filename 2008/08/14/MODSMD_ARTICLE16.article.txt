## Borrelli has big shoes to fill for Cardinal 
### ANGELIQUE DAKKAK DAILY VISITING INTERN 
Jason Borrelli, an assistant with
the Cardinal during the 2007-08 sea
son, was named as Stanford
wrestling's new head coach on Aug.
8. As one would expect, given that it
will be Borrelli's first head coaching
job at the Division 1 level, he was
elated to accept the position.
"I am extremely excited and hon
ored," Borrelli said just days after his
selection. "The opportunity to coach
at one of the top institutions in the
world is very intriguing. The
Stanford wrestling program has
made some great strides over the
past years and 1 am thrilled to be a
part of its continued success."
A former Central Michigan stand
out where he wrestled under the
guidance of his father, longtime
Chippewas head coach Tom Borrelli,
Jason Borrelli came to the Farm as
an assistant coach prior to the start of
last season and helped guide the
Cardinal to one of its most successful
seasons ever. Working primarily with
the lower weight classes, Borrelli
helped the Cardinal win 13 duals,
post its highest Pac-10 finish in school
history (second), and send a pro
gram-record five wrestlers to the
NCAA Championships in St. Louis,
Mo.
All told, Borrelli and the staff led
Stanford to a 19th place finish
nationally, matching the program's
second-highest finish in school histo
ry and just its third all-time top-20
finish. Possessing two of the confer
ence's four All-Americans, the
Cardinal's 19th-place finish was the
best in the Pac-10.
Still, Borrelli will have his work
cut out for him replacing former
coach Kerry McCoy, under whose
guidance the program improved by
leaps and bounds over the past three
seasons — from the nearly perennial
conference doormat to a serious con
tender for the Pac-10 Championship.
Making matters still more difficult
are the departures of a pair of stand
outs in Tanner Gardner '08 at 125
pounds and Josh Zupancic '08 at 157
pounds. Zupancic was one of the few
two-time All-Americans in program
history, while Gardner was the only

three-time honoree. Adding further
to the Cardinal's issues is the gradua
tion of heavyweight Phil Doerner '08,
leaving Stanford with no obvious
candidates for that spot in its lineup.
Despite all this, Borrelli is confi
-nt that he can keep the Cardinal on
the right path going forward.
"1 think things will turn out
alright," he said. "We all know this
will be a challenge, but we know we'll
pull through. The loss of McCoy is, of
course, disappointing, but 1 think
we'll be just fine. A lot of work will
have to be put in, but 1 think we'll do
great — maybe even better than last
season. One thing is certain: We'll
have an exciting season."
It's clear that Borrelli was certain
ly a big part of the Cardinal's success
last season. Indeed, a record-break
ing season from Gardner and a stand
out debut from rising sophomore
Lucas Espericueta show that the
Central Michigan grad has a healthy
resume — a fact that wasn't lost on
Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby.
"Jason Borrelli is bright, hard
working and very enthusiastic about
Stanford wrestling," Bowlsby told
GoStanford.com following the
coach's hiring. "We did a national
search to find a successor for Kerry
McCoy and ultimately one of Kerry's
assistants demonstrated he was the
right choice."
Prior to his arrival at Stanford,
Borrelli was an assistant coach at
Central Michigan. A Mt. Pleasant,
Mich.-native, Borrelli was a two-time
Michigan State Champion in high
school before beginning his career at
Central Michigan in 2001. As a
starter all four years in college,
Borrelli was part of five consecutive
team Mid-American Conference
(MAC) championships. As a junior
in 2005, he won the 133-pound MAC
title. Borrelli qualified for the NCAA
Championships at 133 pounds twice,
in both 2(X)5 and 2006, and he cap
tained the Chippewa team as a
senior. Borrelli was also a four-year
NWCA All-Academic selection and
graduated from Central Michigan in
December 2005 with a degree in
Business Administration.
