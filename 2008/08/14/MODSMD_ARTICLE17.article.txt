## Cardinal makes it to 200-medal mark with three in Beijing 
### 
Two Stanford swimmers earned
Stanford's first medals of the 2008
Olympic Games with their efforts in
the preliminary rounds of the men's
and women's 4 x 100-meter freestyle
relays, raising Stanford's all-time
Olympic medal count to 199.
Although neither swam in the final,
Ben Wildman-Tobriner '07 is now a
gold medalist while junior Julia Smit
earned a silver.
Late last night, however, the
Cardinal made it to the 200-medal
mark with Smit's bronze medal as a
reserve on the women's 4 x 200-
meter relay team.
Wildman-Tobriner was part of a
U.S. team that set a world record
with a time of 3:12.23 in the prelimi
nary heat of the 4 x 100-meter free
relay, turning in an impressive mark
of 48.03 seconds in his leg. The event
finals proved to be the most intense
swimming race of the Beijing Games
thus far, with the United States'
Jason Lezak coming from behind in
the final 50 meters to beat France to
the wall and earn gold. The U.S.
foursome set a world record for the
second time in one day, completing
the race in a phenomenal 3:08.24.
Smit, on the other hand, helped
America qualify for third in the
finals of the 4 x 100-meter free relay,
swimming a key leg in the prelimi
nary heat. The U.S. squad that swam
the finals finished in an American
record time of 3:34.33 to earn the sil
ver medal, following the

Netherlands by a slim .57 seconds.
