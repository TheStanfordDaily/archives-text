# Tree stands for Mascot Hall of Fame election
## 
### 
The Stanford Tree has been nom
inated along with five other colle
giate mascots for the Golden Silly
String Award and induction into the

Mascot Hall of Fame.
Although the current Tree,
Patrick "Patchez" Fortune '09, was
unaware of the Mascot Hall of Fame
until he was recently nominated, he is
nonetheless confident in his chances
of winning the online vote to decide
this year's inductee. The Stanford
Tree's current opposition is com

prised of three birds, a dog and an
orange, hailing from South Carolina,
Miami, St. Joseph's, Tennessee and
Syracuse, respectively.
"I'd say [the odds of winning are]
pretty solid," Fortune said. "I've met
some of the other mascots and they
weren't anything too special.
They're nice guys, but 1 don't know

if they're quite of legend stature
yet."
Past inductees to the Mascot Hall
of Fame include Brutus Buckeye of
Ohio State and Big Red of Western
Kentucky. Voting runs through
Sept. 12 on mascothalloffame.com.
