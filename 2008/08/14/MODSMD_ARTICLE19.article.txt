## CAMPUS HAPPENINGS SCULPTURE CREW SAVES THE DAY 
### LYDIA CHOW DAILY VISITING INTERN 
They storm across campus in matching hats and
T-shirts, zipping around in a flashy orange vehicle,
ready to answer the distressed calls of grimy and cob
webbed statues in need of a valiant savior. One is
armed with blue rubber gloves and an arsenal of
hoses, brushes and liquid solvents. No, it's not a new
Justice League of superheroes — it's Stanford's very
own Sculpture Crew.
The Outdoor Sculpture Maintenance Crew was
established in 1993 to survey the sculpture conditions
of the University's vast collection. Today, Cantor
Arts Center hires a diverse group of students to clean
and maintain the various pieces spread across cam
pus. Teams of two or three students work year
round, keeping the permanent artwork presentable
for students and visitors alike.
Susan Roberts-Manganelli, manager of collec
tions, exhibitions and conservation at Cantor, said
that the Sculpture Crew offers a great opportunity
for students interested in art careers.
"The sculpture crew gets people from all sorts of
departments," Roberts-Manganelli said, explaining
that rather than hiring employees from outside the
University, the Sculpture Crew was created to give
students interested in art a chance to get hands-on
experience, literally.
"For art students, it's a great way to further their
education by seeing how much maintenance is
required for certain kinds of sculptures," she said.
"But also we know that Stanford students are the

ones who will purchase art, donate art and become
the patrons of the arts in the future."
Although art majors are the typical job applicants,
students from other majors have also been drawn by
the prospect of working outdoors in beautiful weath
er.
"It's a nice way to take a break from studying,"
said sculpture maintenance technician Thomas
Nguyen '01. An English major, Nguyen first learned
about the Sculpture Crew from a friend in the art
department.
"It's great if you like hauling hoses, getting wet
and being in the sun when the weather is so great,"
Nguyen said. "Plus, it's a good job to have because
it's really self-directed."
While the typical maintenance jobs require only a
simple wash, objects conservator and professional
sculpture cleaner Tracy Power works with a handful
of students on larger projects involving re-waxing
and repainting.
"With this job, you get to see many different parts
of campus," Power said. "You get to work in lifts and
harnesses, you get to touch and climb on the statues
in the museum and you're invited to museum open
ings. It's particularly valuable for people making
sculptures to see the amount of maintenance
required, and when you work with the outdoor
pieces, it helps artists understand the logistics of
sculpting."
Power and Nguyen are on duty together today.

GRIME BE GONE: Sculpture Crew members Thomas Nguyen '01 and Tracy Power
assess and treat the beloved "Claw" sculpture in White Plaza on Friday. The campus
cleaners keep sculptures around the Farm in top shape for viewing year-round.
drained White Memorial Fountain
(better known as The Claw), amidst
heavy construction near the Stanford
Bookstore, they carefully inspect the
condition of the bronze and copper
structure for signs of damage.
"Fountains like this one usually
need less work," Power explained,
taking multiple photographs of the
fountain to document its condition.
"Even if we removed the patina from
this bronze sculpture, it'll be back
once the water is turned back on."
With the teamwork of an
indomitable hero-sidekick team like
Batman and Robin, Power and
Nguyen discuss the possible cause for
certain unusual color splotches.
"These purple areas you don't see
naturally with bronze — they might
be caused by some kind of chemical
in the water," Power said. "And these
red splotches are probably from
paint."
To identify the proper treatment,
Nguyen and Power brought along a
cooler filled with bottles of liquid sol
vents such as acetone and DTP A.
Using cotton swabs, they experiment
ed with various solvents to see which
chemicals effectively remove the
unnaturally colored areas and per
haps prescribe the appropriate treat
ment for the sculpture.
Nguyen, who first joined the crew
with only limited knowledge of sculp
tures, has nevertheless learned a great
deal through his experience with
Sculpture Crew.
"It's mainly art majors who are on
the crew, but even so, you learn a lot
about the art over time," he said.
"Now, if 1 go around to different
cities, I'll see a sculpture and think.
'Oh, it's a Moore.' I've learned to
appreciate the sculptures more, and
now sometimes I'll get annoyed when
I see them dirty or vandalized."
While the crew usually takes care
of normal wear and tear, on occasion
there is an unfortunate case of van
dalism that requires particular atten
tion. According to Power, the biggest
problem with vandalism is with the
Alexander Calder sculpture, "The
Falcon." This sculpture, located near
the Law School, has traditionally
been a part of Frisbee golf courses.
"People ride their skateboards and
bikes on the Calder, and the spokes
end up tearing the paint," Power
added. "It's really heartbreaking to
see what happens to it."
Interest in joining Sculpture Crew
has been down recently, according to
Roberts-Manganelli, but she hopes
that, come September, she can draw
an enthusiastic batch of super-clean
ers— ready to save the day, battle
dirt and grime and be defenders of
cleanliness and art.
