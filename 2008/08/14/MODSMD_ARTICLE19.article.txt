## CAMPUS HAPPENINGS SCULPTURE CREW SAVES THE DAY 
### LYDIA CHOW DAILY VISITING INTERN 
They storm across campus in matching hats and
T-shirts, zipping around in a flashy orange vehicle,
ready to answer the distressed calls of grimy and cob
webbed statues in need of a valiant savior. One is
armed with blue rubber gloves and an arsenal of
hoses, brushes and liquid solvents. No, it's not a new
Justice League of superheroes â€” it's Stanford's very
own Sculpture Crew.
The Outdoor Sculpture Maintenance Crew was
established in 1993 to survey the sculpture conditions
of the University's vast collection. Today, Cantor
Arts Center hires a diverse group of students to clean
and maintain the various pieces spread across cam
pus. Teams of two or three students work year
round, keeping the permanent artwork presentable
for students and visitors alike.
Susan Roberts-Manganelli, manager of collec
tions, exhibitions and conservation at Cantor, said
that the Sculpture Crew offers a great opportunity
for students interested in art careers.
"The sculpture crew gets people from all sorts of
departments," Roberts-Manganelli said, explaining
that rather than hiring employees from outside the
University, the Sculpture Crew was created to give
students interested in art a chance to get hands-on
experience, literally.
"For art students, it's a great way to further their
education by seeing how much maintenance is
required for certain kinds of sculptures," she said.
"But also we know that Stanford students are the

ones who will purchase art, donate art and become
the patrons of the arts in the future."
Although art majors are the typical job applicants,
students from other majors have also been drawn by
the prospect of working outdoors in beautiful weath
er.
"It's a nice way to take a break from studying,"
said sculpture maintenance technician Thomas
Nguyen '01. An English major, Nguyen first learned
about the Sculpture Crew from a friend in the art
department.
"It's great if you like hauling hoses, getting wet
and being in the sun when the weather is so great,"
Nguyen said. "Plus, it's a good job to have because
it's really self-directed."
While the typical maintenance jobs require only a
simple wash, objects conservator and professional
sculpture cleaner Tracy Power works with a handful
of students on larger projects involving re-waxing
and repainting.
"With this job, you get to see many different parts
of campus," Power said. "You get to work in lifts and
harnesses, you get to touch and climb on the statues
in the museum and you're invited to museum open
ings. It's particularly valuable for people making
sculptures to see the amount of maintenance
required, and when you work with the outdoor
pieces, it helps artists understand the logistics of
sculpting."
Power and Nguyen are on duty together today.
