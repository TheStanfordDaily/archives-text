# ART SCENE
## Contemporary glass a treat for the eyes 
### BEN ASHER DAILY VISITING INTERN 
Surrounding the Oshman Family Rotunda
at the Cantor Arts Center resides a unique
collection of Italian-influenced American
glass artwork. "Contemporary Glass," which
opened at Cantor on Aug. 1 and runs
through the end of January, features artists
like Dale Chihuly and William Morris.
Toward the end of the 19th century,
Venetian glass firm Saviati donated over 200
glass works to Jane Stanford as thanks for
commissioning its artists to do mosaic work
around campus. Although American artists
are featured in the current exhibit, the con
nection between their work and their
Venetian counterparts is clear.
One piece in particular, "Artifact: Shard"
by William Morris, looks exactly like the
name sounds. Though obviously constructed
of glass, the piece appears ceramic. What is
most intriguing about this particular glass
piece is the aesthetics of its surface.
Unlike the other, more traditional pieces
of glass, the surface of "Shard" is rough. The
artist uses the piece as a canvas for a cave
painting, which reemphasizes its stone-like
appearance. The graphic itself docs not look
like a painting, but part of the glass.
When you think of glass, you usually think

of a window. However, the texture variety in
this exhibit is astounding. Some pieces have
the typical gloss finish, like that of a window
pane, while others have more of a matte fin
ish, making for a ceramic look.
Contributing to the diversity of this exhib
it is a variety of levels of detail. There are less
intricate, taller, more stylized vases, as well as
translucent bowls with bright tropical color
ing. The glass bowls, "Fonte" and
"Inviting Chaos" by Mary Ann "Toots"
Zynsky, are some of the more delicate works.
The thin walls of the bowls allow light to pass
through their deeper coloring.
"Contemporary Glass" is definitely a
crowd favorite. Even children react strongly
when they see the glass artwork. As soon as
one child on a group trip to the museum
stepped into the rotunda and saw the glass,
he said, "Awesome!" Take it from the kids
â€” you're not going want to miss out on this
unique experience.
