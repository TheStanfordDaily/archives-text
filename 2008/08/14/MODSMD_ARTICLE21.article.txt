# Cantor highlights work of late alum

Cantor brings a Stanford family member
home in its current exhibit, "Richard
Diebenkorn, Artist and Carey Stanton,
Collector: Their Stanford Connection." The
collection boasts an assortment of small
paintings, prints, watercolors and drawings
by the late Richard Diebenkorn '44.
After graduating, Diebenkorn returned
to Stanford as an artist-in-residence during
the '60s. He was one of the best-known
abstract expressionists in the United States
and worked throughout the country, though
primarily on the West Coast in the later
part of his career. Born in Portland, but a
San Francisco native, Diebenkorn's style

evolved over the more then 50 years in
which he was working. His work grew from
a Henri Matisse influence to a decidedly
geometric style that he began using in the
19605.
Diebenkorn's friend and fellow Stanford
alumnus Carey Stanton '44, M.D. '47 collect
ed the paintings that are being shown at
Cantor. The pieces focus on Santa Cruz
Island, which until the 1980s was owned pri
vately, a large portion by the Stanton family.
The collection features 45 pieces of
Diebenkorn's work, spanning from the 1950s
to the late 1980s, and show the evolution of
his style during this period. The works high
light the colors of the scene while leaving the
viewer with a vague impression of the reality
of the subject; it gives a sense of watching an
unreal space while drawing you into the vivid
colors and details.
At first glance, Diebenkorn's style is rem
iniscent of watercolor; though his medium is
oil on canvas. One of the most prominent
works, "View of the Ocean, Santa Cruz
Island," is on display at the entrance to the
exhibit. It combines a slew of cool colors into
a geometric pattern, with smaller, warmer
geometric sections for contrast. Although
this work is geometric, it is not at all as stiff as
the work of Piet Mondrian. The majority of
Diebenkorn's paintings are generally soft,
and some pieces have no geometric focus at
all.
The paintings of the Diebenkorn exhibit
range from simple objects to small land
scapes, some more detailed then others.
There are a few portraits, and many of his
paintings contain human figures. Observers

overloaded with either warm or cool
colors, with just a little of the oppo
site painted in. However, none of
Diebenkorn's colors are particularly
bright or immediately catchy. The
collection contains a few black and
white sketches in both pencil and
dark ink.
In addition to Stanton's collec
tion, "Richard Diebenkorn:
Abstractions on Paper," an array of

Diebenkorn's other prints and
paper, is on display. The works
come from several private collec
tions, including pieces from Cantor,
and feature Diebenkorn's work
from the 1970s and 1980s. The soft
texture of each piece provides just
enough abstraction for fans of
abstract art. However, world objects
emerge to the viewer in nearly all of
his paintings, making his work
accessible to anyone.
