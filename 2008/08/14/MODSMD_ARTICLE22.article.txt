## Hollywood takes a worthy shot at itself "Tropic Thunder" succeeds with ironic humor, surprising cast 
### ERIC MESSINGER 
From time to time, Hollywood feels the
need to make fun of itself. People outside the
system take shots at the big machine all the
time, but there is a unique pleasure in seeing
Hollywood-sized dollars and connections glee
fully applied to the task. "Tropic Thunder,"
directed by Ben Stiller, makes use of $100 mil
lion and a strong cast for an exercise in this
brand of self-deprecation. And, in the best
Hollywood fashion, it puts a huge amount of
effort into entertaining the hell out of its audi
ence.
The movie-within-a-movie is a Vietnam
War film shot on location, with rookie
Englishman Damien Cockburn (Steve
Coogan) directing a shoot filled with explo
sions and troublesome personalities. Action
star Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller) struggles to
revive his career, while comedian Jeff Portnoy
(Jack Black) battles an escalating drug habit.
To make matters worse, Australian actor and
"five-time Oscar winner" Kirk Lazarus
(Robert Downey, Jr.) darkens his skin to play
an African-American sergeant, causing prob
lems with genuinely black rapper Alpa Chino
(Brandon T. Jackson). Effects specialist Cody
(Danny Mcßride) doesn't help matters with
his enthusiasm for explosives. Adding a final,
destabilizing element is the presence of Four
Leaf Tayback (Nick Nolte), who wrote the
book being adapted into the movie, and insists
that the actors need to immerse themselves in
the reality of Vietnam if they want to capture
the experience.
As in all movie situations, once they take
Four Leaf Tayback's advice, everything goes
to hell, and the actors find themselves lost in
the jungle. Speedman thinks the filming is still
in progress, even when he's captured by armed
drug growers and held for ransom. His con
fuscd agent (Matthew McConaughey) tries to
organize studio efforts to save him, while
Lazarus and the rest of the actors try to decide
if it's worth risking their lives to rescue an
idiot.
Fake trailers before the opening credits

introduce the lead actors, and
the film shoot is as over-the
top as it gets. This full-on par
ody can exhaust its strength if
stretched too long, which the
filmmakers recognize. Past
the opening half-hour, after
the actual making of the
movie goes off the rails,

"Tropic Thunder" eases up into a gentler
satire focused on the actors. The prevailing
tone of balls-out absurdity carries over, thank
fully, even as the overt gags soften.
Some remnants of its opening parody wind
up hobbling the movie, whether it's the down
right lazy "funny names" jokes or the necessi
ty of revolving around the film shoot plotline.
For the most part, however, the film navigates
this difficult shift. The visuals assist consider
ably, with the shadows and atmosphere on
some shots achieving all the humor of a longer
sequence, without knocking you over the head

with the joke. The camera
earns smiles before the actors
have to say a word.
Several scenes of the charac
ters sitting and talking — a
challenge in any comedy —
succeed beautifully. These
work thanks to Downey, Jr ~
who provides a reliable anchor

for the main group of actors, investing Lazarus
with a confidence bordering on the fanatic.
Black, who at first appears unnecessary, slow
hums Portnoy's drug withdrawal marvelously.
He brings his full mania to the fore precisely
when the film needs the energy, rather than
expending his charm early.
The supporting cast also shines. Mcßride
follows up on his scene-stealing role in
"Pineapple Express" with more of the same
energy, while Nolte is fantastic. And one guest
turn by an actor I won't name should restore
some of his tarnished credibility. Even the

perennially inconsistent Stiller gives his best in
his scenes of isolated lunacy. "Tropic
Thunder" channels the particular talents of
the ensemble as well as it can.
It's evident that the filmmakers understood
the limitations of its concepts and characters,
and they employ the available tricks at a care
ful pace. The care and self-awareness is both
endearing and effective. Even the near-total
absence of women is more a comment on the
consequences of hyper-masculine attitudes
than an absent-minded omission. Calculated
and resourceful, it's a Hollywood product to
the bone, but "Tropic Thunder" succeeds by
being smarter than most loud, dumb comedies
about being a loud, dumb comedy. In turning
the guns on themselves, the actors and film
makers don't forget what Hollywood does
best.

WAR OF IRONY: Ben Stiller leads the troops as an actor for and director of "Tropic Thunder," the latest summer comedy. A movie within a
movie, "Thunder" successfully turns the cameras on Hollywood, parodying political correctness left and right. The film treads lightly on overdone
humor, and tactfully navigates the limitations that come in comedic territory like this.
