## "Transsiberian" showcases gorgeous Russian landscape, but that's it

The most profound character in
"Transsiberian," the new drama
from writer-director Brad Anderson
("The Machinist"), may be the
frozen countryside our heroes Roy
(Woody Harrelson), and Jessie
(Emily Mortimer) arc traveling over
by train. The images Anderson gives
us of Siberia's vast tundra — from
aerial views of the Trans-Siberian
Express chugging through endless
snowy forests to a particularly lovely
shot of a dappled stallion startled by
the train — show us Russia's fron
tier as we imagine it: wild and often
savage, but with an unfiltered beau
ty-

"Transsiberian" follows the story
of an American couple, who, on the
train from Beijing to Moscow, get
caught up in a drug-smuggling ring.
This "Brokedown Palace"-esque
film relies heavily upon audience
empathy to achieve its narrative
goals. Filmmakers attempt to sway
the audience into rooting for the
relationship between lowa goober
boy Roy and his former-bad girl
wife Jessie; if you don't, it's hard to
care about any of the highly unbe
lievable, highly unfortunate circum
stances they find themselves in.
Here's where the filmmakers fail,
though: The relationship is doomed
to fail anyway. He's a devout
Christian; she's not. He wants kids;

she doesn't. He's
head-over-heels in
love with her; she's
making eyes at the
first hottie who
enters their train
compartment.
There's no way this
relationship is going

to last, and we don't particularly
want it to.
The aforementioned hottie, by
the way, is a worldly Spaniard
named Carlos (Eduardo Noriega),
who is allegedly returning with his
American girlfriend Abby (Kate
Mara) from teaching English in
Japan. Carlos, Abby, Jessie and Roy
strike up a friendship of circum-

stances, with the
women bonding
over their shared
history as teenage
runaways and the
men bonding over
their shared love of
vodka.
The trouble

begins when, while stretching his
legs in Irkutsk, Roy misses the train.
The other three disembark at the
next station, Carlos and Jessie kind
of hook up, some drugs get planted
somewhere they don't belong, and
eventually Roy and Jessie run afoul
of a crooked Russian narcotics
detective named Grinko (Ben
Kingsley). Without giving away too

much, they keep all their toes.
Aside from audience empathy,
the thing that makes a suspenseful
drama interesting is a subtle, twist
ing plot with insinuations that mean
one thing when you first hear them
and something completely different
when you recall them later.
"Transsiberian" doesn't have many
of those.
For the most part, Anderson and
co-writer Will Conroy approach the
film's narrative with the subtlety of
a baboon on steroids being chased
by an elephant, who is also on
steroids. Abby steals a sidewise
glance at a mysterious man on the
train platform, then suddenly
