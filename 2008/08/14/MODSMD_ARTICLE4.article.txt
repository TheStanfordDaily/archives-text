Stanford neurosurgeon dies
Stanford neurosurgeon Dr. John Borchers was killed in a
small plane crash last week near Lake Tahoe. Borchers had
been a clinical instructor in the School of Medicine's neuro
surgery division since 2006.
Borchers' body was identified today by the Washoe
County coroner's office.
Last Thursday, the neurosurgeon checked out a Cessena
172 from his flying club at Palo Alto Airport for a nighttime
trip to Reno, Nev. The plane was found wrecked Friday morn
ing on the east side of Mount Baldy. The National
Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash.
Borchers was 41 years old. He is survived by his wife, a son,
two daughters, his father and his sister.
University ranks second on Chinese list
Stanford placed second in a popular college ranking list
published annually by China's Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
Stanford was behind top-ranked Harvard University and
ahead of the University of California, Berkeley, which earned
third place, in the Academic Ranking of World Universities.
Although the Chinese-produced ranking system doesn't
draw as much domestic attention as the U.S. News and World
Report rankings, it has sparked a flurry of attention abroad.
Several foreign nations, notably France, have lamented
that their top national universities are not well represented on
the list. Only three non-American universities rank in the top
20, and American schools take up 54 of the top 100 spots.
Prof, given $3.1 million stem-cell research grant
Assistant Prof, of Medicine Ching-Pin Chang was awarded
a five year, $3.1 million grant by the California Institute of
Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) for stem-cell research.
Chang will investigate the role of stem cells in the narrow
ing of coronary arteries enlarged by angioplasty.
The grant brings the total amount Stanford researchers
have received from CIRM to $94 million.
"We expect these awards to play a significant role in chang
ing the career trajectory of funded researchers, encouraging
talented young investigators to pursue careers in stein-cell
research," said CIRM President Alan Trounson in a press
release. "I'm pleased that great research has the opportunity
for funding."
