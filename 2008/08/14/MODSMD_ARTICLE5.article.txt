## RESEARCH Prof. steps down over conflict Under Senate investigation, Schatzberg leaves project 
### DEVIN BANERJEE NEWS EDITOR 
Psychiatry Prof, and Department
Chair Alan Schatzberg has stepped
down from his position as principal
investigator on a federal research grant,
following what has now been six
months of Congressional scrutiny
regarding the professor's financial ties
to the drug industry.
The move — deemed "temporary"
by Stanford officials — comes after half
a year of communications between the
University and Sen. Chuck Grassley
(R-IA), who has been unearthing
details of Schatzberg's financial rela
tionship with Corcept Therapeutics, a
public company specializing in depres
sion treatment. Schatzberg co-founded
Corcept in 1998 and now owns more
than $6 million in the company's stock.
Schatzberg, who is also the presi
dent-elect of the American Psychiatric
Association, served as principal investi
gator of research that was being funded
by a grant from the National Institutes
of Health (NIH). The research — cen
tered on the biology of psychotic
depression — involved the drug
mifepristone, which has been used since
1988 to induce abortions but has recent
ly been tested by Corcept as an anti
depressant.
In a July 31 letter from Grassley to
University President John Hennessy,
Grassley noted a potential conflict of

interest between the professor's
research on mifepristone and his equity
in Corcept.
"This equity could grow dramatical
ly if the results of Dr. Schatzberg's gov
ernment-sponsored research find that
mifepristone could be used to treat psy
chotic major depression," the lowa sen
ator wrote.
In a July 31 letter from the
University to the National Institute of
Mental Health (NIMH), Stanford
General Counsel Debra Zumwalt
stressed that "appropriate steps were
taken to prevent bias or actual conflict
of interest." Zumwalt noted that other
faculty members, who had no financial
interest in the results of the research,
assumed responsibility for the mifepris
tone trials.
Michelle Brandt, senior media rela
tions manager of the School of
Medicine, said in an email to The
Weekly that Medical School Prof.
Charles Deßattista oversaw the initial
mifepristone trials in place of
Schatzberg, followed by several other
doctors.
"Dr. Schatzberg did not select or
screen the participants, treat the partic
ipants or consult on the treatment they
received, collect the data from the par
ticipants' visits or analyze the data,"
Brandt said. "It would not have been
appropriate for him to do so."
Still, Grassley noted in his letter to
Hennessy that, according to NIH grant
policy, the primary investigator of an
NIH grant is responsible for scientific
or technical aspects, as well as day-to
day management of the project.
"So, the question arises: How could
Dr. Schatzberg monitor the research

funded with his NIH grants if he was
not involved closely in the study?"
Grassley asked.
Grassley also pointed to several
other NIH-funded mifepristone trials
listed on Stanford's Web site and
ClinicalTrials.gov next to Schatzberg's
name. In response, Stanford Vice
Provost and Dean of Research Ann
Arvin explained in a July 31 letter to
Grassley the progression of doctors
who assumed responsibility for the
mifepristone trials, and she told the sen
ator that Schatzberg will step down
from his role as principal investigator.
"Despite our belief that Stanford,
NIMH and Dr. Schatzberg have han
dled this grant in accordance with the
regulations and applicable policies and
with due regard for the integrity of the
research," Arvin wrote, "we can see
how having Dr. Schatzberg continue as
the principal investigator on the grant
can create an appearance of conflict of
interest."
"And we want to eliminate that con
cern," Zumwalt added to the same
statement in her letter to the NIMH.
According to Brandt, School of
Medicine Prof. Fredric Kraemer will
temporarily replace Schatzberg as prin
cipal investigator on the grant.
In Grassley's most recent letter to
Stanford officials, the senator also
probed the University's financial ties to
Corcept. Claiming Stanford may have a
conflict of interest similar to
Schatzberg's, Grassley has given the
