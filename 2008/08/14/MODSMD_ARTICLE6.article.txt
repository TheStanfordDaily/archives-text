## Study finds exercise key to aging well, living long 
### MELANIE KIM DAILY VISITING IN TERN 
Jogging regularly into old age
may have more benefits than a sim
ple runner's high — the healthy
habit may slow the effects of aging,
according to a Stanford study two
decades in the making.
In 1984, Emeritus Prof, of
Medicine James Fries came up
with a hypothesis called
Compression of Morbidity, which
holds that healthy lifestyles will not
only prolong survival, but will also
decrease the number of years with
disability. He gathered a team of
researchers and began his experi
ment.
The study started with around

1,000 people over the age of 50.
Half of the participants were mem
bers of a runner's dub, and the
other half were otherwise healthy
people from Stanford, but not
members of the running club. For
21 years up until 2005, the partici
pants rated their disability status
on a scale of 0 (no severe health
problems at all) to 3 (pretty much
unable to do most things).
"Everybody reported increasing
disability as they get older, especial
ly since we're talking about people
who were around 60 when they
started," said Prof, of Medicine
Eliza Chakravarty. "However, we
found that over time, the runners
group had very low levels of dis
ability that increased very slowly.
The controls, on the other hand,
had disability that increased much
more quickly. At the end of the
study, the difference between the
disability levels was very dramatic."
Participants who were part of a
runner's club also enjoyed lower
mortality rates — about half that of
the non-participants.
"So not only were they less dis
abled, but they lived longer as
well," Chakravarty said of the run
ning participants.
One difficulty in this study was
getting rid of self-selection bias —
the possibility that factors other
than running contributed to the
experimental results. According to
Fries, it was a highly plausible
explanation that a positive, healthy
attitude — rather than running —
produced better outcomes. The
research team tried to minimize
the self-selection bias in several
ways.
"We statistically adjusted for
many factors such as obesity and
age," Chakravarty said. "We also
chose pretty healthy people in our
control group. They were not
obese, had normal body weight,
bad the same education levels as
the runners and didn't drink or
smoke much. We tried to restrict it
so that the main difference
between the two groups was run
ning."
The basic message of the study,
however, is simple: Exercising, at

any age, is very important.
"People shouldn't be discour
aged from exercising because
they're older," Chakravarty said.
"Adopting an exercising program
— even in the 50s or 60s will be
beneficial down the road. We're
just really excited that we're able to
show benefits of exercise, not only
in living longer, but living healthi
er up into the 80s."
Of course, swimmers, bikers
and other exercise fiends need not
fret over the study's emphasis on
running; other forms of cardiovas

cular exercise serve a similar pur
pose.
"We think it's probably vigorous
exercise in general [that produce
these results]," Chakravarty said.
"Even though we chose the groups
for running and non-running, we
don't necessarily think that there is
anything specific to running —
that running is better than cycling
or swimming or any other form of
regular aerobic exercise."
