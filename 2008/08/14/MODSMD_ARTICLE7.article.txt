# Stanford Hospital vs. SEIU LOCAL 715
## Court affirms SHC decision; vote pending 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The controversial decision by
Stanford Medical Center to suspend
recognition of a union representing
1,450 healthcare workers was
affirmed by a judge in a National
Labor Relations Board ruling on
Friday.

Administrative judge John J.
McCarrick of San Francisco ruled
that the union failed to properly
prove to Stanford that it existed, thus
violating labor rules.
In 1998, Stanford employees
elected Service Employees
International Union (SEIU) Local
715 as their workers' union. In 2006,
however, SEIU Local 715 and other
local unions underwent a number of
mergers that resulted in consolida
tion into the United Healthcare
Workers (UHW) Union-West.
Stanford Hospital & Clinics
(SHC) and Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital (LPCH) with
drew recognition of the union this
month, stating that their employees
had elected SEIU Local 715, not
UHW Union-West, as their workers'
union.
"The union engaged in unfair
labor practices when they failed to
notify us of this merger, and they
failed to prove the existence of SEIU
Local 715 to us," said Sarah Staley,
director of communications for
LPCH.

But union officials disagree, argu
ing that Stanford is misleading the
public about the conflict.
"All the National Labor
Relations Board said was that lx>cal
715 was supposed to have provided
information to Stanford proving the
union's existence, and we didn't,"
said John Borsos, vice president of
United Healthcare Workers.
"Stanford, as usual, is taking some
thing and completely distorting it.
It's a cover to justify their 10-year
pattern of anti-union behavior."
Stanford hospital employees will
be voting to determine the future of
their union representation in early
September, in an election held by the
National Labor Relations Board.
In anticipation of the election,
SHC and LPCH administrators
recently launched a Web site,

tifying the hospitals' fair treatment of
workers.
"We wanted to provide a one
stop, fact-based, around-the-clock
