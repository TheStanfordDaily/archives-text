## Stanford's private stories From the fanny to the personal

DAILY VISITING INTERN
On a sunny day in August,
lots of diverse people with
unique stories roam about
the Stanford campus.
Graduate students study in the library,
tourists photograph MemChu and bik
ers hurry to escape the heat. But the
dark blue jeans of one biker stand out
— they belong to Abi Nishimura, a
High School Summer College (HSSC)
student from Atlanta.
Her jeans may not suit the weath
er, but Nishimura remembers how
the dark color once saved her from
devastating embarrassment during a
second-grade standardized test.
"1 finished early, and 1 really had
to pee," Nishimura said. "It took me a
while because 1 had to finish the test,
and I couldn't go until I was done. So
I was holding it and holding it until I
was finally allowed.
"But I couldn't undo the button on
my pants!" Nishimura continued. "I
tried and I tried because I really had
to pec, but it didn't work. So I ended
up peeing in my pants — at school!"
But Nishimura didn't panic.
Looking at the contrasting dark
shades of her jeans, she turned to the
bathroom sink and sprinkled water
on herself in an attempt to hide her
embarrassment — and it worked.
"I went back into the quiet testing
room with my dark jeans and sat in
there smelling all like pee,"
Nishimura said.
She rides away on her bicycle. As
embarrassing as her story might
sound, Nishimura isn't the only one
with a mortifying experience. Around
the corner from her, a girl in a red
Stanford sweater runs frantically to
catch the departing Marguerite shut
tle. Unfortunately, the bus driver
shows no mercy, leaving behind
Tweety Huang, an HSSC student
from Boston. Huang is not at all dis
appointed— she knows her running
ability too well.
"I am in a field hockey team at my
high school," she noted. "Every
Monday, we have to run the whole
field. But one time, our coach made us
run the field two times as punishment.
I am a slow runner, and I remember
my coach thinking that 1 was the first
to finish the run when I was only
halfway done. 1 felt really embar
rassed when she called out 'Great
job!' as I completed my first lap."
A jog down the street, in the
School of Education, visiting Prof.
Solomon Major teaches International
Organizations. Like many Stanford
professors, Major appears 10 feet tall

to his students. However, Major
revealed an embarrassing fact: He
was never a good student himself.
"I almost flunked out of high
school, and I almost flunked out of
UCSB [UC-Santa Barbara]," Major
said. "1 got into UCSB because of
family friends, and because it was our
local school. 1 probably shouldn't
have gotten in. 1 know I'm smart, but
I'm just not a good student. Some
people are good at the business of
being a student. 1 read more than peo
ple, studied more than people, but 1
never really studied to pass a class."
Exiting the oldest building on cam
pus, the animated voice of Omonigho
Oiyemhonlan '11 catches the atten
tion of passersby. She joyfully chats
away with people she met for the first
time. However, there is another side
to her cheerful laugh.
"It might not seem that way, but
inside, I am a really, really, really shy
person," Oiyemhonlan admitted. "I
get louder and more enthusiastic
when I am really uncomfortable. It's
funny because my loudness is a
defense mechanism, but it works out
well. 1 guess I'm really backwards, or
my character is rewired in some dif
ferent way."
Back on West Campus, Katie
Rice, an HSSC student from Atlanta
has different shades of jeans scattered
on her bed and a collection of acces
sories glimmering on her shelf. Not to
mention, the loud music booming
from her iPod speaker. Her room def
initely glistens with the fresh spirit of
a teenager. Not everyone, however,
sees Rice as the lively high-school stu
dent that she is.
"A young woman who worked at
the grocery store said to me, 'Your
daughter is so cute!' as she looked at
my younger sister," Rice said. "I awk
wardly shook my head, fearing for the
worst. The woman gave me a con
fused look and asked, 'But aren't you
two...?' pointing at my dad and
myself. At that point, I wanted to
scream: i am only fifteen!"'
"It was even more humiliating
because she felt really bad and kept
repeating, 'But you look so old!'"
Rice added.
Under their surface appearance,
there's apparently much more to the
people who roam Stanford campus —
whether it's their actual age, an
embarrassing secret or elementary
school humiliation. At a place where
intellectual inquiry is encouraged, all
it takes is curiosity and the courage to
ask what that secret something is.
