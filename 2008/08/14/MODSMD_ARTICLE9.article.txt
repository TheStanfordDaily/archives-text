Stanford Medical Cenlcr and Kaiser Permanente
were awarded a $3.89 million grant from the
American Heart Association (AHA) on Monday.
Meant to establish a Northern California heart
research center, the grant will help pursue optimal
care in cardiovascular medicine.
Stanford and Kaiser researchers will conduct
large-scale observational effectiveness and safety
studies for cardiovascular therapies at the center,
which will be led by Mark Hlatky, professor of health
research and policy and medicine, as well as Kaiser
research scientist Dr. Alan Go.
The first two studies performed by the new center
will use top-of-the-line analytic research methods to
evaluate the effectiveness of various pharmacologic
therapies and emerging technologies. These treat
ments include stents, defibrillators and coronary
bypass.
"We want to assess the benefits of treatments as
well as risks, and we want to determine whether these

vary in different types of patients," Hlatky said. "Our
second goal is to identify a representative population
of patients who have coronary disease or heart failure
and document which treatments they are getting and
how well those treatments are working."
For the first time, the medical records databases
for all of Kaiser's 3.3 million Northern California
members will be linked, allowing researchers to lever
age Kaiser's broad set of data along with the expertise
of both teams.
"Investigators from Stanford and from Kaiser will
both work in the center," Hlatky said. "We will focus
on analyzing data from Kaiser patients, but will be
able to tap into other data sources as well to look fur
ther into interesting issues."
Hlatky emphasized the value of using patient data
to get a better sense of treatments' efficacy.
"The findings of the center can be used to improve
the quality of care, both in Kaiser and in other set
tings," he said. "The linked Kaiser data will allow us
to determine how well treatments work outside of the
carefully controlled conditions of a clinical trial."
The Stanford-Kaiser Permanente Cardiovascular
Outcomes Research Center is one of three new cen
ters to receive funds from the AHA to improve the
nation's cardiovascular health. The other two centers
are at Duke University and UCLA.
