Open Letter from Community Leaders
In Support of Stanford Caregivers
The Stanford Hospital and Clinics and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital provide our community with vital healthcare services
and jobs. Frontline caregivers and support staff at the hospitals have helped make them world-class medical institutions.
For ten years, more than 1,400 caregivers at the Stanford hospitals have been members of the Service Employees International
Union (SEIU), Local 715. Through their union, they have achieved modest but important improvements in pay, benefits and
job security. Since 2006, Stanford caregivers and Local 715 have sought and received the assistance of SEIU's statewide healthcare
workers' local, United Healthcare Workers/West (UHW), in implementing their collective bargaining agreement
with the hospitals and making further improvements in working conditions and patient care.
The Stanford hospitals have refused to accept any role for UHW in continuing to assist SEIU members at Stanford. To resolve
this issue, caregivers are preparing for a new union election, if necessary, to establish that UHW is their union. Despite
threats from supervisors in a number of departments, a large majority of union caregivers at the Stanford hospitals have recently
signed authorization cards that affirm their choice to be represented by UHW, and more are signing every week.
As elected officials and community leaders, we call upon the leaders of the Stanford hospitals and Stanford University to
remain neutral and allow caregivers to make their own choice regarding union representation. Hospital officials must ensure
that caregivers are able to make this choice in an environment free of intimidation and harassment. Once the choice has been
made, we urge hospital leaders to work quickly and constructively with hospital employees and their chosen representatives
to settle a contract that meets industry standards, improves patient care and creates better jobs. We believe that this best
serves the interests of the hospitals, their employees, and the community as a whole.
