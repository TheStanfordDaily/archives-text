I IHhEHEhR Summer Science Lecture Series
■ Meeting the world's growing energy needs in a sustainable fashion is one of the most
I pressing problems of our time. Although there are multiple possibilities on the horizon
for renewable and clean energy, many scientific and engineering challenges remain.
I This is an exciting time for researchers in the field of sustainable energy.
I Join Stacey Bent, Professor of Chemical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and
I Materials Science as she touches upon current research at Stanford that is exploring
I the use of new materials to develop the next generation of solar cells and fuel cells.
