Suddenly, 1 didn't know where 1
was. I looked around, I saw a
thick wall of green trees lining
the Interstate and signs for Wendy's,
McDonald's and Chevron stations
ahead. Relying on a GPS to guide me,
I even forgot which highway I was
moving on at HO miles an hour. My
car radio played the tranquil voice of
a New Yorker podcast. I could have
been in any state in the Union, mind
lessly thundering through its terrify
ingly vast network of looping clover
leaves, on ramps and off ramps. I felt
panicked at the all-encompassing
anonymity of this Anywhere, USA.
Ouickly 1 switched off the podcast to
search for a local station and turned
at the next exit, determined to see
something specific to this unknown
place —or at the very least, find a
Waffle House.
II you've been reading this column
in the last two months, you probably
know that, for the first time in my life,
I've been living in the South, and that
I frequently discuss issues of
American regionalism. Whether it be
watermelon festivals, provincial poli
tics or Elvis eyewitness testimonials,
over this summer I have reveled in
and been beguiled by the specificities
of localities. In my fascination with all
things local, however, I have also dis
covered that one needs to search out
the eccentricities of place — the gas
station with its own barbecue smoke
house or the gallery of folk art. These
loci of local character are quickly
rescinding farther and farther away
from the interstate, fading deeper
into the nether-regions of the heart
land.
Oh boy, I wish the WPA still exist
ed.
During the Great Depression,
FDR's New Deal programs paid writ
ers and photographers to travel
throughout the country and capture
the essence of towns small and large
in a series of travel guides. Much of
the goal of this work — besides pay
ing the salaries of unemployed writ
ers — was to report on and preserve
traditions and cultures of communi
ties before they disappeared under
the growing mantle of modernity.
Ironically, the programs of FDR
largely expanded the presence of the
federal government in the everyday
lives of Americans, and they may
have inevitably eroded local autono
my and customs.
This summer, The New York
Times has published a series of travel
articles about these WPA guides,
which have had a wave of renewed
interest since the Library of Congress
recently put them online. I've been
reading this series with a rapt interest.
Perhaps for our generation, so accus
tomed to the complexes of suburban

sprawl and mall culture, the world
described in the WPA travel guides
seems entirely otherworldly and exot
ic. But for me, they are especially per
tinent for my summer job; a fat WPA
guide for Alabama sits on my office
desk.
I write histories of Southern
Jewish communities for a non-profit
organization in Jackson, Miss. I think
about disappearing cultures every
day. The Mississippi-born Jewish
author Edward Cohen writes in his
memoir "The Peddler's Grandson"
of the melancholy similarities of
these two cultures: "One can hardly
hail from two more historically losing
causes than the South and Judaism.
Both my cultures have long tragic
pasts, and not one jot of it has been
forgotten." In many ways. Southern
and Jewish cultures have king been
on the decline, one from historic and
economic trends, the other from the
simple truths of numbers and
birthrates. Thus, the Southern Jewish
experience is one of battling against a
diminishing way of life.
From only one summer of study
ing them, I can attempt to summa
rize the story of Southern Jews. They
were immigrants who came to fledg
ling frontier communities as early as
the 18th century. They traded in fur
and dry goods and fought for the
Confederacy. Many settled during
the emergence of the New South,
hearing in their far-off homelands of
the slowly booming Reconstruction
economies. As members of the mer
chant class they profited from the
wealth of these new industrial towns.
They formed synagogues and com
munity centers, and bought plots of
land to bury their dead. They adapt
ed their traditions to fit into local
customs, bringing gospel choirs into
their houses of worship and drop
ping matzah balls into their gumbo.
Often, these merchants would
become prominent civic leaders.
Their stores would grow and shape
Main Streets of downtowns through
out the South.
My boss likes to say that in many
ways, "the story of Southern Jews is
the story of sons not wanting to work
in their fathers' businesses." But also,
theirs is the story of almost every
American downtown. In the second
half of the 20th century, as the econo
my changed, when industries moved
abroad and monolithic malls were on
the rise, Jewish-owned businesses
closed shop over and ewer again. And
many Jews, once important figures in
small-town Southern life, moved
