## FOOTBALL Defensive talent ready to break out Front seven reach to bring the heat in '08 
### JACK DUANE STANFORD DAILY INTERN 
Stanford's defensive unit will be a mix of
the familiar and foreign this upcoming sea
son. With eight starters returning, there is
an encouraging sense of continuity in the
locker room, a feeling that rising senior
defensive end Erik Lorig has noticed.
"Our front seven's experience has
allowed us to really focus on better tech
nique and individual responsibility," Lorig
said on Tuesday.
However, the Cardinal will have to deal
with the departure of Defensive
Coordinator Scott Shafer, who took a simi
lar position with Michigan. Shafer imple
mented the 4-3 last year and coached a
defense that had the fifth-most tackles for
loss in the NCAA and the second-most
sacks in the Pac-10. Former NFL coach
Ron Lynn was hired as co-defensive coor
dinator and assistant head coach. Lynn will
collaborate with linebackers' coach Andy
Buh, who was elevated to co-defensive
coordinator during the off season.
With lingering questions surrounding
the quarterback position and the offense,
it's quite clear that Stanford will need an
impressive defensive showing to improve
upon last year's 4-8 record.
Defensive Line
Stanford is led up front by rising senior
DE Pannel Egboh. At 6-foot-6 and 270
pounds, Egboh has NFL talent and size.
Erik Lorig, a former tight end, will start as
the other end and continue to learn the
intricacies of defensive line play. Rising
juniors Ekom Udofia and Brian Bulcke will
work together as the two starting interior
linemen.
The line struggled last year against the
run and Head Coach Jim Harbaugh
observed that "the speed on the line
[looked] weak" in Tuesday's scrimmage.
Rising sophomore Sione Fua could play
a significant role in helping stuff the run for
the Cardinal. The 6-foot-2, 305-pound Fua
was highly recruited out of high school, but
missed last season while on a mission for
his church. The defensive line should be
able to wreak havoc on opposing quarter
backs this season, but the ability to stop the
run will be the true test of the unit's effec
tiveness.
Linebackers
The linebacker position should be the
strength of the Stanford football team. The
Cardinal returns three starting linebackers
from a unit that was surprisingly solid all
last season.
Rising junior Clinton Snyder,
who has been named to presea
son watch lists for every NCAA
linebacker award, is the clear
leader of the defense. Starting all
but two games in his previous two
seasons on the Farm, Snyder has
made a name for himself in the
Pac-10 with a knack for finding
the ball and hard hitting. Snyder
earned honorable mention All-
Pac-10 honors last year with 96
tackles and a team-high eight
sacks.
Fifth-year senior Pat Maynor,
another headliner of the line
backer corps, has played in 30
games for the Cardinal and led
the team with a career-best 16.5
tackles for loss.
Rising sophomore Chike
Amajoyi, who made an immedi
ate contribution as a true fresh
man last year, rounds out the
starting trio.
"[The starting linebackers] set
the tone for a very tough, aggres
sive and athletic unit," Harbaugh
told GoStanford.com.
Secondary
Stanford's secondary strug
gled against strong passers last
year, and the forecast for 2008

isn't particularly bright on the
surface. Last year's team inter
ception leader Nick Sanchez and
fellow corner Tim Sims have
graduated and rising junior free
safety Austin Yancy, who started
all 12 games last year, is out for
five to six weeks with a hamstring
injury.
As cornerbacks, rising junior
Kris Evans and rising senior
Wopamo Osaisai will be depend
ed upon to weather the storm in
their first years as starters.
Osaisai allowed too many big
plays last year and needs to chan
nel his special teams' success and
tremendous speed into coverage
brilliance. Rising junior strong
safety Bo McNally led last year's
team with 114 tackles and "still
has room for growth" according
to defensive backs coach Clayton
White. Rising sophomore Taylor
Skaufel will fill in at free safety
while Yancy rehabilitates.
The secondary could benefit
from the pressure a strong front
seven is expected to provide. But
if opposing quarterbacks have
enough time, it could be a long
season for Stanford's secondary.
