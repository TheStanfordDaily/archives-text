## FOOTBALL Defensive talent ready to break out Front seven reach to bring the heat in '08 
### JACK DUANE STANFORD DAILY INTERN 
Stanford's defensive unit will be a mix of
the familiar and foreign this upcoming sea
son. With eight starters returning, there is
an encouraging sense of continuity in the
locker room, a feeling that rising senior
defensive end Erik Lorig has noticed.
"Our front seven's experience has
allowed us to really focus on better tech
nique and individual responsibility," Lorig
said on Tuesday.
However, the Cardinal will have to deal
with the departure of Defensive
Coordinator Scott Shafer, who took a simi
lar position with Michigan. Shafer imple
mented the 4-3 last year and coached a
defense that had the fifth-most tackles for
loss in the NCAA and the second-most
sacks in the Pac-10. Former NFL coach
Ron Lynn was hired as co-defensive coor
dinator and assistant head coach. Lynn will
collaborate with linebackers' coach Andy
Buh, who was elevated to co-defensive
coordinator during the off season.
With lingering questions surrounding
the quarterback position and the offense,
it's quite clear that Stanford will need an
impressive defensive showing to improve
upon last year's 4-8 record.
Defensive Line
Stanford is led up front by rising senior
DE Pannel Egboh. At 6-foot-6 and 270
pounds, Egboh has NFL talent and size.
Erik Lorig, a former tight end, will start as
the other end and continue to learn the
intricacies of defensive line play. Rising
juniors Ekom Udofia and Brian Bulcke will
work together as the two starting interior
linemen.
The line struggled last year against the
run and Head Coach Jim Harbaugh
observed that "the speed on the line
[looked] weak" in Tuesday's scrimmage.
Rising sophomore Sione Fua could play
a significant role in helping stuff the run for
the Cardinal. The 6-foot-2, 305-pound Fua
was highly recruited out of high school, but
missed last season while on a mission for
his church. The defensive line should be
able to wreak havoc on opposing quarter
backs this season, but the ability to stop the
run will be the true test of the unit's effec
tiveness.
Linebackers
The linebacker position should be the
strength of the Stanford football team. The
Cardinal returns three starting linebackers
from a unit that was surprisingly solid all
