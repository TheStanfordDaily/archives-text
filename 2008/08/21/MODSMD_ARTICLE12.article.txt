## Card hopes to amp up offense in 2008 
### JACOB JOHNSON STAFF WRITER 
An old axiom of American foot
ball claims that defense wins cham
pionships, hut if last season offers
any clue, the Cardinal men's soccer
team will need more than just a solid
D to take home a title in 2008.
Last year, the Cardinal squad was
extremely successful at keeping the
ball out of the net — both on
defense and. unfortunately for
Stanford, on offense as well While
the Cardinal men held opponents to
an average of 0.83 goals per game —
they allowed only 16 goals all season
they only managed to score 23
goals in 18 games.
"We will have to be better offen
sively." rising senior TJ Novak said.
"Last year we tied a lot of games 0-
0, so we are hoping to change that."
Indeed, the Cardinal finished
three games last season at 0-0, and
saw an astounding five contests go to
double overtime. In fact, other than
a 5-1 exhibition victory over
Sacramento State and a 4-0 win over
Oregon State, the Cardinal couldn't
score more than three goals in a
game last year. And they only man
aged three goals in two other games,
making for a total of 16 games out of
a full 20-game schedule (including
two exhibition matches) in which the
Cardinal scored just two goals or
fewer.

If they fail to improve on last
year's 7-6-5 record, though, it cer
tainly won't be for lack of effort. The
Stanford men have been doing dou
ble workouts almost ever day. with a
training session in the morning fol
lowed by video and technique work
in the afternoons.
Members of the team stressed the
importance of playing well early in
the season in order to build momen
tum going into Pac-10 competition.
Conference play begins on Oct. 3 in
Seattle, against the Huskies, with
five more games against Pac-10
opponents coming in the next 30
days.
The Cardinal saw its first action
on Wednesday night when the squad
hosted Sonoma State in an exhibi
tion match, with Stanford losing 2-1.
Rising sophomore Bobby Warshaw
slipped past a pair of defenders to
score Stanford's lone goal in the
47th minute of play.
The Cardinal will hope to get an
offensive boost from six incoming
freshmen, four of whom could make
an immediate impact on the squad's
offensive attack. The incoming class
includes midfielders Clayton Hoi/
and Adoni Levine, forward Cullen
Wilson and midfielder/forward Ben
Grafentin. All look to make a differ

and the squad's veterans are already
