## Manny's talent deserves better than his attitude 
### 
If you don't know why I would
lead-off a sports column with
Michael Phelps' name this week,
you have clearly spent the last 10
days living under a rock somewhere.
Phelps had been touted in the
international media since the 2004
Games in Athens as the athlete who
could finally surpass fellow
American Mark Spitz's seemingly
unbreakable record of seven gold
medals in a single Olympics, set at
the 1972 Games in Munich.
But still, it seemed almost impos
sible that he could succeed until he
took the top place on the podium for
the eighth time last Saturday. In a
sport where winning by half a sec
ond counts as a soaring victory,
Phelps proved he was better than
the best competition the world had
to offer eight consecutive times.
What Phelps did last week was
the most astounding display of
supremacy by an individual athlete
since Lance Armstrong won the
Tour de France seven straight times
and will probably never be equaled.
Unless, perhaps, the now 23-year
old Baltimore native can pull it off

again in 2012 at the London Games.
But Phelps' amazing feat will not
be the focus here this week. Instead
this column will discuss another
amazing feat in sports, although this
time amazing for its childish selfish
ness and not for its difficulty. No,
now we move on to the fact that
Manny Ramirez remains a celebrat
ed athlete and will get another
multi-million dollar contract this
winter.
Over the last month and a half,
the baseball world watched as the
Manny soap opera played out in
Boston, culminating in his trade to
the Los Angeles Dodgers at the end
of July. Big names often move at
MLB's trading deadline â€” usually
from a team falling out of contention
to one looking to beef up its talent
heading into the season's home
stretch.
From the Dodgers' point of view
the trade makes perfect sense: They
were a team with horrendous power
and poor run-production, fighting to
stay alive in the unremarkable
National League West. Since the
trade they are 10-6 and Manny has
slugged another six long balls for his
new team.
But the Red Sox were, and still
are, in a tight race both in the
American League East and for the
wild card. They currently sit four
and-a-half games back of Tampa
Bay in the East and lead the wild
card race by a game over
Minnesota. While Jason Bay is a
great, if relatively unknown, hitter,
any lineup is going to get worse
when it loses Manny.
No, the BoSox traded Ramirez
not because he asked to be traded,
but because he forced their hand.
True, there is nothing wrong
with a player nearing the end of his
contract privately letting his team
know he doesn't plan on re-signing
with them. It gives the franchise the
option of trading him to get some
thing in return or hold on to the
player and make a run for it. But,
make no mistake, this wasn't
Manny's method.
Instead he told the media he
wanted to be traded, accused the
franchise and Boston fanbase of
being "undeserving" of his talents
and made it clear he did not feel
obligated to play hard or take his
job seriously if he didn't get what he
wanted. There were even rumors
that he, at least temporarily, refused
to board the plane for the team's
final road trip prior to the trade. In
effect, he held the team hostage.
Now that Manny has gotten his
wish, his bat is as hot as ever; he is
almost running, rather than jogging,
to ground balls hit to left; and he

even cut his hair (okay, clipped an
inch off) when asked by manage
ment. The message he is sending is
clear: "As long as you keep me
happy, and pay me, I will give you
one of the greatest right-handed hit
ters ever, but 1 only play when I
want to."
This is an athlete whose conduct
does not respect his teammates, his
fans or even his own talent. He is a
child without loyalty. He doesn't
acknowledge that a contract puts
more expectations on him than just
to be physically present. He is a
model for selfishness and immaturi
ty. His is an attitude that is com
pletely undeserving of the money
he receives ("earns" just doesn't fit)
and the talent and ability he was
blessed with.
But, as is the case in professional
sports, supreme talent can cause all
else to be overlooked and Manny
will once again be handed a massive
contract this winter. Someone will
take a chance on the talent and
ignore the attitude, and Manny will
get big hits and probably even win
some games for whoever that is.
But that organization will also have
to deal with the days Manny doesn't
want to play and the strain he can
put on a clubhouse full of athletes
who get up each morning ready to
work.
So watch as Manny tears up
Chavez Ravine as long as the
Dodgers stay close and watch as he
signs a massive contract somewhere
this summer, but wait and see how
long he can manage to behave,
especially if the team that signs him
next year has a disappointing sea
son.

Erik Adams has seen Manny's act too
many times to he fooled again.
