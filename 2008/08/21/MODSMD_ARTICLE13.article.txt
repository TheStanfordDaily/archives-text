## Manny's talent deserves better than his attitude 
### 
If you don't know why I would
lead-off a sports column with
Michael Phelps' name this week,
you have clearly spent the last 10
days living under a rock somewhere.
Phelps had been touted in the
international media since the 2004
Games in Athens as the athlete who
could finally surpass fellow
American Mark Spitz's seemingly
unbreakable record of seven gold
medals in a single Olympics, set at
the 1972 Games in Munich.
But still, it seemed almost impos
sible that he could succeed until he
took the top place on the podium for
the eighth time last Saturday. In a
sport where winning by half a sec
ond counts as a soaring victory,
Phelps proved he was better than
the best competition the world had
to offer eight consecutive times.
What Phelps did last week was
the most astounding display of
supremacy by an individual athlete
since Lance Armstrong won the
Tour de France seven straight times
and will probably never be equaled.
Unless, perhaps, the now 23-year
old Baltimore native can pull it off

again in 2012 at the London Games.
But Phelps' amazing feat will not
be the focus here this week. Instead
this column will discuss another
amazing feat in sports, although this
time amazing for its childish selfish
ness and not for its difficulty. No,
now we move on to the fact that
Manny Ramirez remains a celebrat
ed athlete and will get another
multi-million dollar contract this
winter.
Over the last month and a half,
the baseball world watched as the
Manny soap opera played out in
Boston, culminating in his trade to
the Los Angeles Dodgers at the end
of July. Big names often move at
MLB's trading deadline â€” usually
from a team falling out of contention
to one looking to beef up its talent
heading into the season's home
stretch.
From the Dodgers' point of view
the trade makes perfect sense: They
were a team with horrendous power
and poor run-production, fighting to
stay alive in the unremarkable
