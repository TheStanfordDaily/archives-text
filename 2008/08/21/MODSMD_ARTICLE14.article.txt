In last week's story "Borrelli has
big shoes to fill for Cardinal," author
Angelique Dakkak, a Daily Visiting
Intern, inaccurately attributed the fol
lowing quotation to wrestling head
coach Jason Borrelli:

"I think things will turn out
alright," he said. "We all know this
will be a challenge, hut we know we'll
pull through. The loss of McCoy is, of
course, disappointing, hut I think
we'll be just fine. A lot of work will
have to be put in, but I think we'll do
great — maybe even better than last
season. One thing is certain: We'll

have an exciting season."
Borrelli did not make such a state
ment to The Weekly, and the quota
tion, among other information includ
ed in the article, was derived from a
CSTV.com press release on Borrelli's
hiring. The Weekly apologizes for the
error, and the story has been removed
from the online edition.
