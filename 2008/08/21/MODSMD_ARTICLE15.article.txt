## BEYOND THE BUBBLE OUTSIDE LANDS IS HERE Beck, Radiohead, Jack Johnson headline SF music fest 
### PAUL CRAFT 
For music fans around the world, summer
means festivals. Chicago has Lollapalooza
and the Pitchfork Music Festival. England has
the famed Glastonbury Festival. Even
Denmark has the Rosklide Festival. And now
the Bay Area has its very own premier sum
mer music event: the Outside Lands Festival.
Starting tomorrow and running through
Sunday, the Outside Lands Festival will fea
ture dozens of bands playing live in San
Francisco's famous Golden Gate Park.
The musical lineup spans several generations
of musicians and styles of music, featuring
everything from the avant-garde noise rock of
Liars to the soothing acoustic pop of Jack
Johnson. Fortunately, each day of the festival
boasts bands that arc worth your time and
money. The Festival will be spread out over sev
eral stages. For more information, check out
www.sfoutsidelands.com.

Here is a list of a few standout acts, with the
stage and time noted.
Friday, Aug. 22
Gates open at 3 p.m.; music begins at 5 p.m.
Radiohead — Lands End, 8 p.m.
Dull. Any follower of rock music has likely
heard whispers of Radiohead's spectacular live
performances. Tickets to their smaller shows
sell out in mere minutes, so this particular gig
might be your best shot to see them live in the
near future. Plus, they will be the first band
allowed to play live, at night, in Golden Gate
Park. Just picture this Friday night — the moon,
the shimmering lights of San Francisco shining
behind you and Thorn Yorke crooning over
Johnny Greenwood's angular guitar. Sounds
like the perfect night to me.
Beck — Sutro, 6:40 p.m.
The master of rock reinvention
himself brings his creativity to the
Outside Lands Festival tomorrow.
In 2006, he delivered an awe-inspir
ing show at the Download Festival
that involved lots of puppets. (Need
I say more?) His most recent
release, "Modern Guilt," is a gem
of indie rock atmospherics and
melancholy themes. Plus, imagine
the roar of the crowd when he plays
the opening chords to his hit,
"Loser."
Black Mountain — Twin Peaks,
5:30 p.m.
If you want to time travel back
to Golden Gate Park's hippie era,
make sure to see this band.
Combining both the hard and folky
sounds of the 19705, they no doubt
make their fellow Canadian fore
runner, Neil Young, very proud.
Saturday, Aug. 23
Gates open at 11 a.m.; music at 1

p.m.
Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers
— Lands End, 7:55 p.m.
Tired yet of "Free Fallin'"? I'm
not quite there — yet. Indeed. Tom
Petty did a good job during half
time at the Super Bowl, and he will
be equally proficient as he closes
Saturday's festivities. This is their
first show since the Super Bowl.
Cake — Sutro 6:50 p.m.
This Sacramento band combines
tight rhythms, funky horns and a
sense of humor. In their heyday in
the alt-rock days of the 19905, this
band was great. Hopefully their
show will recapture the magic.
Liars — Panhandle, 2:55 p.m.
This band can be summarized in
one word: noise. If you're looking
for a full-tilt assault on your
eardrums, check out this New York
band.
The Walkmen — Panhandle, 5:55
p.m.
This stalwart of the New York
post-post-punk scene brings their
new material, entitled "You and
Me" to the West Coast. Expect lots

of anguished singing, waves of dis
torted rhythm guitar and precious
piano ambiance in a sloppy, punk
vibe. The furious strumming and
hatred-tinged singing on "The Rat"
will provide the perfect catharsis to
your stressful work week.
Lupe Fiasco — Twin Peaks, 3:35
p.m.
Ever since Lupe helped out on
Kanye West's track "Touch the
Sky," ("bottle-shaped body like
Mrs. Butterworth"), Lupe Fiasco
has grown into a star in his own
right. No doubt he will bring a
crowd, delivering some insights into
skateboarding and Chicago along
the way.
Sunday, Aug. 24
Gates open at 11 a.m.; music at 1
p.m.
Wilco — Twin Peaks, 6:35 p.m.
Perfectly balancing their more
experimental sounds with tradi
tional guitar jamming, Wilco is a
crowd-pleaser live. More recent
material like "At Least That's
What You Said" feature extended
guitar freak-outs while their earlier
"Summer Teeth" sound is more
country and pop inspired. Band

leader Jeff Tweedy played an
excellent set last year at Golden
Gate Park's Hardly Strictly
Bluegrass Festival.
Broken Social Scene — Twin
Peaks, 5 p.m.
Don't be surprised if this group
brings out more than 15 band mem
bers at once, including Feist and
Emily Haines from Metric. This
Canadian group plays with the
loose feel of a collective — a huge
group of friends jamming. If you're
a fan of indie rock, this will be a
giant party. Also check out their
collaborators and band mates.
Stars.
Andrew Bird — Twin Peaks, 3:35
p.m.
Andrew Bird relies heavily on
loops in his show. He will, for
instance, play a few notes on glock
enspiel, loop it, then play a guitar
riff, loop it and keep building up
the sound until he has single-hand
edly fleshed out the song. Based on
his most recent material, Andrew's
set will manage to be both intimate
and energetic.
