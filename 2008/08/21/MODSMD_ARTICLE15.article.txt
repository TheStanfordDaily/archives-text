### PAUL CRAFT 
For music fans around the world, summer
means festivals. Chicago has Lollapalooza
and the Pitchfork Music Festival. England has
the famed Glastonbury Festival. Even
Denmark has the Rosklide Festival. And now
the Bay Area has its very own premier sum
mer music event: the Outside Lands Festival.
Starting tomorrow and running through
Sunday, the Outside Lands Festival will fea
ture dozens of bands playing live in San
Francisco's famous Golden Gate Park.
The musical lineup spans several generations
of musicians and styles of music, featuring
everything from the avant-garde noise rock of
Liars to the soothing acoustic pop of Jack
Johnson. Fortunately, each day of the festival
boasts bands that arc worth your time and
money. The Festival will be spread out over sev
eral stages. For more information, check out
www.sfoutsidelands.com.

Here is a list of a few standout acts, with the
stage and time noted.
Friday, Aug. 22
Gates open at 3 p.m.; music begins at 5 p.m.
Radiohead — Lands End, 8 p.m.
Dull. Any follower of rock music has likely
heard whispers of Radiohead's spectacular live
performances. Tickets to their smaller shows
sell out in mere minutes, so this particular gig
might be your best shot to see them live in the
near future. Plus, they will be the first band
allowed to play live, at night, in Golden Gate
Park. Just picture this Friday night — the moon,
the shimmering lights of San Francisco shining
behind you and Thorn Yorke crooning over
Johnny Greenwood's angular guitar. Sounds
like the perfect night to me.
