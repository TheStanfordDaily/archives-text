# ART SCENE
## Only a few weeks left to catch Kahlo Frida Kahlo exhibit delves deep into the artist's emotional life 
### SHELLY RONEN 
Frida Kahlo's work is a must-see. Her
identity as a Mexican woman as well as her
boisterous vibrancy, sexuality and all
encompassing love (or Diego Rivera are
all prominent themes in her powerful, per
sonal work, which is on exhibit now
through Sept. 28 at the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art.
Bom in 1907, Kahlo lived through the
Mexican Revolution, an experience which
no doubt informs the folkloric influences in
her painting and gestures to the indigenous
Mexico that comes alive in her self-explo
rations. But intertwined with issues of iden
tity and culture is a more brutally personal
discussion of the body. Her own body was
frail and debilitating for much of her life.
Following a tragic bus accident, which
should have killed her, Kahlo was physical
ly challenged recovering from an impaled
abdomen and almost entirely crushed
limbs. This physical state restricted her
movement and prevented her from having
children; an urgent longing that recurs in
her graphic work.
The depth of Kahlo's art was intriguing
and I found myself in heated thought, pass
ing judgments over her life — the virtues
of her relationship with Rivera, or her
androgyny, sexuality and beauty — merely
hy looking into her paintings. Yet I also
sensed the need to connect the work to the
woman. She used her life as her subject,
and the result yielded a pleasingly repel
lant, incredible, inexplicable beauty.
Kahlo's captivating style could not
upstage her formidable life. Indeed, her
work deals largely with personal themes of
identity and nation, as well as the narra
tives of her turbulent love story with
Mexican muralist Rivera, whom she mar
ried twice and continued to dole on pow
erfully despite his many affairs.
Her relationship with Diego domi
nates many works, including the largest
work, "The Two Fridas," which docu
ments the two women in her — one that
Diego used to love and one that he aban
doned, their open hearts attached to one
another by a blood line. This work is cer
tainly the most daunting in size and the
powerful physical imagery make it a very
striking contrast to the smaller works,
such as the intricate "Self Portrait on the
Border Line between Mexico and the
United Slates." This one, like others,
contains dense detail in a delicate and
small painting, which viewers crowd
around in order to decrypt.
Self-portraits seem to take up the bulk
of this collection. Perhaps they are more
powerful, despite the paradoxical stern
stance of the subject. Expressionless
eyes, crowned by her characteristic eye
brows, stare just beyond their viewer's
gaze. Kahlo's regal stance is decorated by
her voluminous clothing and her rosy
cheeks enlivened by warm colors.
Natural imagery surrounds her; monkeys,

a cat, parrots and butterflies decorate her
many portraits. But the viewer's eyes
return again and again to Kahlo's face,
both blank and deeply contemplative,
loaded with powerful emotion.
The gentle cultural references, dualities
and symmetries cry out in creative bold
tones while her face remains constant. Her
earrings and hairstyle may change, but her
face remains devoid of movement, a sur
prise given the shocking personal insights
of these pieces. Sometimes Kahlo is depict
ed weeping, as in "The Love Embrace of
the Universe, the Earth (Mexico), Diego,
Me and Seiior Xolotl," which continues to
occupy my thoughts. To me, this painting is
a warm call for universal love and safety,
yet it is so moving as it occupies a precari
ous space between achieving this desper
ate wish and depicting its own naivety and
acting instead as a monument to its very
failure.
Lines of people waited to see her work
and a collection of photographs of her life
this past weekend. The echoes of their feel
on the polished floor were in concert with
the tapping of fingers on tickets and
brochures. The crowd hummed excitedly in
anticipation of this painter's collection,
whose life —as her work —was colorful
and vibrant, yet emotionally heavy. Despite
the crowds and the struggles to get close to
her often astoundingly small paintings, the
exhibition is a moving, fascinating visual
spectacle. And what's more, it is in spirit
with Frida's fixation with community that
the gallery be filled to capacity and that
viewers be forced to mumble excuses as they
shuffle past one another and make eye-con
tact over her stark, demanding works.
The exhibit is on display for only a few
more weeks. Catch the Frida Kahlo exhib
it before it leaves the SFMOMA Sept 28.
Timed tickets are available, along with
more information at sfmoma.org, or by
phone at (415)357-4000.

"Self Portrait with Thorn Necklace and
