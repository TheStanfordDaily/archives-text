## "Man on Wire" takes careful steps to success 
### ERIC MESSINGER 
On Aug. 6,
1974, a French-
American
team snuck
into the upper
most floors of
the World
Trade Center
towers with

one ton of equipment and worked into the early
hours of the next day, stringing a cable between
the two rooftops. Early on Aug. 7, ignoring
every instinct of self-preservation, a man named
Philippe Petit stepped onto the wire and walked
between the rooftops for 45 minutes. Police offi-

cers gathered at both ends of the
wires and onlookers amassed below.
They were staring at a man who was
1,300 feet off the ground.
Based on Petit's book, "To Reach
the Clouds," "Man on Wire" takes
its name from a police report filed
after his capture, when baffled offi
cials tried to classify what laws he
had broken. The documentary,
directed by James Marsh, unpacks
and lays out what led up to these
three simple words. Marsh inter-cuts
present-day interviews with Philippe
and his crew, archival footage,
filmed reenactments and surviving
photographs and documents to retell
the story of the preparations, the act
itself and, briefly, its aftermath.
While Philippe is the star of the
proceedings, both past and present,
Marsh interviews many of his collab
orators as well. They recount their
reactions to hearing about
Philippe's plan and the nerve
wracking details of its implementa
tion, from several near-misses with
security personnel to shooting an
arrow from one tower to the other.
The individual roles of many of the
players can get lost in the big picture
and who winds up in each tower
playing what role can appear beside
the point. Only Philippe's best
friend, Jean-Louis, and his girl
friend, Anne, have a chance to
express themselves in any great
degree. Their emotional investment
in Philippe's dream is touching, and
no less illuminating are their evi
dent wounds at Philippe's past
behavior. The film makes it
clear that those closest to a man
with a self-absorbed confidence and
a manic determination do not go
unaffected. These close looks are
fleeting, however, and for the most
part the group forms a loose con
federation, a chorus of reasonable

people who assisted a dreamer. The
film defines them in relation to him.
This isn't a problem, however,
because Philippe is probably the
best interview subject a documen
tary filmmaker could imagine. He
explains his dream to walk between
the towers with a passion that con
vinces you of its importance by his
fervor alone. He is lively and capti
vating when he recounts the details
of the plot, and he speaks animated
ly about the lucky strokes that
allowed for success. The role of talk
ing head cannot contain him. At
times, Marsh has him get out of
chair and actually act out what hap
pened. not content merely to articu
late but to show. Philippe remains
every inch a performer, and a great
one at that.
With this spark at the movie's
heart, the energy never ceases. The
use of dramatic re-enactments,
though irritatingly not separated
from archival footage, gives the
preparations the unhealthy excite
ment of a good caper. The informa

tion about planning and preparation
doesn't rob the walk of any of its
wonder. It helps that the events are
in no dispute and that the act is
unimpeachably impressive — a
great situation for any documentary
— but Marsh also never loses sight
of its core fascination.
Although the film commemo
rates an act of supreme recklessness,
"Man on Wire" embodies restraint.
There is no over-reach in assessing
the importance of the event, and
even Philippe is content to let the
triumph of the action mostly speak
for itself. Also, to the film's enor
mous credit, there is no attempt to
thread in the events of 9/11. "Man
on Wire" keeps its aims humble, and
it is content to leave you filled with a
sense of possibility. This is a quiet
gem that has slipped its way in
between the summer's more impos
ing projects, and it would be a
shame to let it pass by unnoticed.
