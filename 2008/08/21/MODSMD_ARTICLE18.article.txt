# ON STAGE
## Acts bring back the funk, flavor of 90s hip hop 
### STUART JENKINS 
Last Saturday's Rock the Bells at Shoreline
Amphitheatre paid tribute to 90s era rap and hip
hop. The daylong, festival-style show rotated
artists on one main stage and acts included
Immortal Technique, Supernatural and Scratch
(of The Roots), Ghostface Killah and Raekwon
the Chef, De La Soul, Method Man and Redman.
Mos Del. Nas and A Tribe Called Quest.
Angry and oft-offensive Peruvian political
activist Immortal Technique performed tracks
from all three of his albums. Appropriately
dressed in army fatigue pants and black boots, he
was one of many artists to articulate his political
views between songs. However, unlike other
artists, his articulation was extremely well
informed and philosophically seeded. He attempt
ed to connect with his audience by comparing the
"vertical slums" of his New York to the "horizon
tal slums" of the West Coast, a move the man who
released Revolutionary Volume 1 in 1998 may not
have made. Though still radical — saying things
like. "II your dad's a cop. fuck your dad" —he
stood out as a talented lyricist and performer.
Wu-Tang's Method Man and long-time part
ner Redman stole the show. Security guards
seemed frustrated as they followed Method Man
through the audience and could only watch as he.
on multiple occasions, attempted to crowd-surf
vertically while rapping down to the riotous audi
ence beneath him. Redman stood atop onstage
speakers between songs, grinning
widely as he led the audience in
chants of "Fuck you, Redman," and
"Fuck you. Method Man." Musically,
the highlight was a cover of Wu-
Tang's "M-E-T-H-O-D Man." Upon
its completion, the obligatory 20-per
son Wu-Tang entourage, including
one man in an electric wheelchair, cel
ebrated wildly.
De La Soul's high-energy perfor
mance helped the group stand out in
a show full of early 90s success stories.
While headliner O-Tip, of A Tribe
Called Quest, attempted to adopt the
onstage persona of a later generation
of artists (a Jay-Z/Nas/Kanye West
style strut), De La Soul bounced all
over the stage as they would have 20
years ago. Their high energy and
authentic "old-school" performance
balanced out the festival and con
tributed an important dimension to
the show.
