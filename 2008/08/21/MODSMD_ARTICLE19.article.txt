## The
						Mynt Indian: fine food, but not fine dining 
### TOMMY TOBIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The sometimes perplexing deci
sion about where to go out to eat is
made easier by the following simple
criteria. Is the food good? Is the din
ing environment — food, ambiance
and service — worth the trip? With
these in mind, let's turn our atten
tion to The Mynt, an Indian restau
rant in Sunnyvale.
Is the food tasty? Yes.
Is the dining environment, taken
in sum, worth the trip? No.
Don't get me wrong, the food
here is pretty good. The veggie
samosas (sorry carnivores, only veg
etarian samosa available) are worth
ordering, especially as they come
with multiple pieces and can be eas
ily shared with the table. For those
seeking a sampler platter, the
Tandoori Hors D'oeuvres gets the
job done, consisting of chicken,
prawns and kebob.
The menu is long, listing tandoori
sizzlers, chicken 'n egg "classics,"
lamb and seafood. While the restau
rant doesn't give you free naan, it
does provide a wide list of hot bread
and rice selections from which to
choose.
The Signature Special section of
the menu lists pre-plated (read: in a
warming tray) that are ready shortly
after one orders. Options here
include lamb, chicken, veggies and
lobster.
An interesting feature of the
restaurant is that its color scheme
matches symbols in its menu.
Particularly, according to the menu,
the symbols correspond to items
which were "analyzed and adjusted"
by San Jose State University's

Nutrition Department to conform to
guidelines for South Asian heart
health.
Moving from the food on to the
dining environment. The Mynt's
ledger is mixed at best. While the
wait staff is nice and responsive, my
dining experience, at least, was
marred by a couple of service errors.
First, I was served the wrong dish.
We had ordered samosas and
received chaat. The staff was nice
enough to correct this, but it
shouldn't have happened at a place
that charges $12 to 16 per entree.
The second error was that I was
served a dirty plate as I awaited my
entree. Again the staff was respon
sive, but this just shouldn't happen.
The mixed experience was com
pounded by the noise-level in the
restaurant. Parts of the eatery are so
loud that the racket all but inhibits
conversation (read: understanding)
between the waiter and the table.
Conversation between you and your
dining partner can also be greatly
hampered by these noise factors. To
beat this, go towards the section of the
eatery with lower ceilings, as it seems
to be quieter (or less notably noisy).
There are a good number of
Indian eateries within a much closer
proximity than The Mynt and with
comparable food. But if you happen
to be in or around Sunnyvale and
have a hankering for Indian food.
The Mynt is not bad. It's just not
worth the half-hour trip from the
Stanford campus.
The Mynt is located at 5210
Prospect Road in San Jose and is
open for lunch and dinner.
