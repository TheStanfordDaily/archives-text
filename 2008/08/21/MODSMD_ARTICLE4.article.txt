## STUDENT LIFE Congress passes act to reduce textbook, college costs 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Following governmental action, stu
dents at Stanford and across the country
should soon have access to more choices
and information so they can reduce the
costs of attending college.
The Higher Education Opportunity
Act of 2008, signed into law by President
Bush on Aug. 14, targets student loans
and textbook prices. In addition, the law
simplifies financial aid applications and
extends grants for low-income students.
The bill had made its way through
Congress as an update to prior legisla
tion.
While the full implications of the
1,100-page legislation will take time to
assess, its impact on some students' cost
of living could come as soon as this fall,
when students old and new shop for their
autumn-quarter books. The law forces
textbook publishers to make "unbun
dled" versions of main course textbooks
available. These textbooks often had
been packaged with additional course

materials, such as workbooks and sup
plementary CDs. The law also aims to
make information about pricing more
transparent for both students and facul
ty-
Director of Financial Aid Karen
Cooper noted that the legislation could
have broad implications, not limited to a
potential impact on book costs.
"It does a lot of tweaking of the feder
al financial aid program," Cooper said.
"The transparency of book costs is just a
small part of that bill."
The law could play a role in the
Financial Aid Office's assessments of
expected student costs. Stanford com
piles data for its "textbook allowance"
for financial aid based largely on student
surveys. Currently, students are expected
to incur $1,455 in yearly book costs for
the 2(X)8-09 academic year. Results from
the upcoming year's surveys, sent out
during spring quarter, will provide an
indication as to whether the law has
checked growing costs.
