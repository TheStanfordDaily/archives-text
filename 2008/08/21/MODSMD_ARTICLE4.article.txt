## STUDENT LIFE Congress passes act to reduce textbook, college costs 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Following governmental action, stu
dents at Stanford and across the country
should soon have access to more choices
and information so they can reduce the
costs of attending college.
The Higher Education Opportunity
Act of 2008, signed into law by President
Bush on Aug. 14, targets student loans
and textbook prices. In addition, the law
simplifies financial aid applications and
extends grants for low-income students.
The bill had made its way through
Congress as an update to prior legisla
tion.
While the full implications of the
1,100-page legislation will take time to
assess, its impact on some students' cost
of living could come as soon as this fall,
when students old and new shop for their
autumn-quarter books. The law forces
textbook publishers to make "unbun
dled" versions of main course textbooks
available. These textbooks often had
been packaged with additional course

materials, such as workbooks and sup
plementary CDs. The law also aims to
make information about pricing more
transparent for both students and facul
ty-
Director of Financial Aid Karen
Cooper noted that the legislation could
have broad implications, not limited to a
potential impact on book costs.
"It does a lot of tweaking of the feder
al financial aid program," Cooper said.
"The transparency of book costs is just a
small part of that bill."
The law could play a role in the
Financial Aid Office's assessments of
expected student costs. Stanford com
piles data for its "textbook allowance"
for financial aid based largely on student
surveys. Currently, students are expected
to incur $1,455 in yearly book costs for
the 2(X)8-09 academic year. Results from
the upcoming year's surveys, sent out
during spring quarter, will provide an
indication as to whether the law has
checked growing costs.

"We try to get a picture of the full
costs, not just what we bill," Cooper
said.
In addition to assessing the
effects of the act, Stanford is taking
some steps of its own to address stu
dent book costs. University
Registrar Thomas Black, in an email
to The Weekly, discussed an upcom
ing effort to make course textbook
information available through
Axess, drawing upon information
from the Stanford Bookstore's ven
dor.
"One of the projects we have
scheduled this year is writing an
interface between Axess and
eFollett.com," Black said. eFollett is
the vendor for the Stanford
Bookstore.
"Such an interface will make it
easier for students to identify the
materials they should secure for the
courses they have selected," he

added.
This measure would be in keep
ing with the legislation's aim to pro
mote greater transparency. Black
noted that the interface, ideally,
would allow students to have a list
ing of the course materials they need
and find the option that works for
them. He also said the system could
provide students more time to com
pare options.
"We haven't worked out the
details — and student input is wel
come — hut we hope that the infor
mation will be complete, including
ISBN codes, so students may shop
with other vendors as desired for
price, service, vendor loyalty, etc.,"
Black noted. "We hope to encour
age our faculty to select and desig
nate their materials before Axess
opens each quarter so students will
have ample time to shop for their
course materials."
While the law will affect the
broader picture of higher education,
few changes are expected at the
Stanford Bookstore, according to
Director of Stores Ken Bowers.
"We don't see radical changes

coming as a result of the bill,"
Bowers said. He emphasized that
the decision to stock lower- or high
er-priced books comes down to fac
ulty decisions.
"As far as we're concerned, we
will sell what the faculty asks us to
sell," Bowers said. "We don't act as
an independent adjudicator of what
the faculty assigns their students."
1 le added that faculty, particular
ly at higher-level universities, often
have to balance a concern for stu
dents' pockets with ensuring the
best possible materials.
"[With] Stanford being a level
one research university, there's a lot
of thought from professors about
what students really need to learn,"
Bowers said. "It's a real dilemma for
faculty."
While textbook prices will likely
continue to be a concern for most
students, "The more we can do to
keep those hook prices down, the
better it is for students," Cooper
said.
