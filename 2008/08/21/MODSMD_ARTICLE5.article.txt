## Medical center considers expanding housing at city's request Report calls for 1,800 housing units as a result of 3,200 jobs from expansion 
### RYAN MAC CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Palo Alto City Council's hopes that Stanford
Hospital and Clinics will develop housing as part
of its expansion project have hit a major impedi
ment as the hospital lacks the land to contribute to
such an effort.
Last week, Keyser Marston Associates (KMA),
an independent consultant hired by the city,
released a report stating that 1,800 housing units
would have to be built around Palo Alto — the
result of the 3.200 jobs created by the expansion of
the hospital and the growth of the Stanford
Shopping Center.
If the hospital is required to develop homes, it
would be the first employer in Palo Alto that
would have to provide housing for its workers.
However, according to Shelley Hebert, the hospi
tal's public affairs executive director, it is unrea
sonable for the city to expect that the medical cen
ter develop housing, especially because it lacks the
necessary resources.
"One broader issue regarding the |KMA
report] is if the hospital can be asked or be expect
ed to provide land," Hebert said. "We don't con
trol the land. The hospital leases the land from the
University. Also, no other employer who's creat
ing jobs has ever had to create housing. It is not
reasonable to think that the hospital should be
able to do that."
Though some city officials have projected cer
tain areas for development, Hebert has stated that
these projects are under the discretion of the
University, not the hospital. Because they are two
distinct entities, the plans of the University cannot
be associated with hospital expansion. The hospi
tal believes, however, that with these projects
already being planned, the city's demands for
more housing may be unnecessary.
"Property at Quarry and El Camino and anoth
er parcel at Quarry and Arboretum are already
planned for housing under the Santa Clara County
General Use Permit," Hebert said. "They are part

of the academic campus, not leased to the hospital.
The fact that this housing near the medical center
is already planned by the University is another
reason we do not think building housing for hospi
tal employees is necessary."
Yet aside from all this, the biggest argument
against the housing projections from Hebert is the
fact that only nine percent of current hospital
employees live in the Palo Alto area.
"Local housing can
reduce the need for
lower-income employees
to commute in from very
long distances.'''
— Yoriko Kishimoto, Palo Alto Councilwoman
"The analysis only gives you an estimate of how
many employees might need housing at certain
income levels, but it doesn't tell how many
employees may want to live in Palo Alto," Hebert
said. "People make decisions for where they want
to live on a number of issues, not just proximity to
work.
The city, however, believes that housing is
indeed necessary in order to provide affordable
housing for workers and to mitigate traffic that
may be created from the expanded facilities. Palo
Alto Councilwoman Yoriko Kishimoto focused on
the positives of such a project for the city.
"Local housing can reduce the need for lower
income employees to commute in from very long
distances," she wrote in an email to The Weekly.
"New housing will cause more local trips, but these
are trips which can be translated to walk, bike
|and] shuttle alternatives."
For Hebert, simply viewing the
project from individualized posi
tives or negatives is not the means
for progress. She stated that the
project should not rely on the
eariy KMA report as the defini
tive means for action and that it is
not until the comprehensive
Environmental Impact Report
(EIR) is released that decisive

actions can be taken.
"When all of the studies cur
rently being conducted for the
Environmental Impact Report are
completed, the information will
enable us to fully analyze issues
that may be interdependent," she
said. "We feel it is necessary to
take a comprehensive approach
and not an individual approach."
With the EIR to be completed
by the end of the year, both city
officials and the hospital will wait
until final plans regarding housing
or construction are made. As for
now, negotiations will simply be

based on a great deal of speculation
with neither side wanting to give up
too much, perhaps best stated by
Vice Mayor Peter Drekmeier.
"No one wants to give up too
much too early on," Drekmeier
said in an earlier interview with
The Weekly. "There are obvious
ly some differences and issues
with mitigation. However, by the
release of the EIR later in the
year, everything should be negoti
ated and smoothed out."
