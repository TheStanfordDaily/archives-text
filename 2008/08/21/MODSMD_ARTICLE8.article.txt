## Researchers find risk in HIV drug Nevirapine found to contribute to resistance weeks after administration 
### MELANIE KIM DAILY VISITING INTERN 
Stanford researchers have found that a common drug
used to prevent transmission of the HIV virus from
mothers to their children may actually spur drug-resis
tant forms of AIDS.
The drug, nevirapine, is administered as a single pill
to the mother before labor and in liquid form to the
child just after hirth. According to researchers, this per
sistence of nevirapine levels in the mother's blood and
breast milk puts the mother and baby at risk for devel
oping drug-resistant viral strains, which can be very dif
ficult to treat.
The researchers studied 32 HIV-positive women in
Zimbabwe in a study that was originally designed to
look at appropriate doses for newborns. In the process,
researchers found that drug resistance in the blood per
sisted for two weeks following administration of nevi
rapine for over two-thirds of the women. In addition,
one-third of the women had drug resistance in their
breast milk after eight weeks. Though none of the moth
ers had drug-resistant forms of HIV, RNA testing two
months later showed resistant viruses in the hlood of
one-third of the mothers as well as in the breast milk of
two-thirds.
Researchers also looked at nevirapine levels in
search of a correlation with drug resistance in mothers'
breast milk or plasma. However, it was impossible to
predict development of resistance because of the differ

ent rates of drug metabolism between women.
From their work, researehers developed a concern
that infants are prone to infection with a drug-resistant
variant during breast-feeding or at some later point after
delivery. This puts children at risk even if they escape
infection during delivery.
"We know that there are better, more effective
modalities to try to prevent infection, such as combi
nation therapies for the mother," said Dr. Seble
Kassaye, Stanford medical fellow and the study's first
author. "We need to continue to work towards using
more effective regimens in mothers, both for their
own benefit as well as to prevent infection in their
babies."
Researchers have also found lhat there is an even
wider selection of drug-resistance mutations when more
sensitive tests, such as clonal analysis, are used.
"What we see with our commonly available tests is
not really the full picture of what's there and what resis
tance is developing in the mother," Kassaye said. "From
that standpoint, there is probably even more room for
concern. But again, in terms of the public health
response, the availability of single-dose nevirapine is
very valuable because it allows public health depart
ments to actually start addressing the problem â€”to
start building infrastructure around something that
seemed doable."
Researchers are worried, however, about the long
term effects.
School of Medicine Prof. David Katzenstein told
U.S. News and World Report that while nevirapine may
be better than nothing, the threat of resistance develop
ing on a larger scale could seriously damage future treat
ment efforts.
