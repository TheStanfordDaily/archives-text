## Stu's Views It's not about the medals: Three points on the Olympics 
### 
The big political news of the
week will be Obama's vice
presidential announcement,
which may very well come by the
time this column is published. I
could very well write a column how
much I like the centrism of Sen.
Evan Bayh or the foreign-policy
assertiveness of Sen. Joe Biden. but
I will likely be wrong and the com
mentators will have a field day. So
no go.
I've been watching a ridiculous
amount of Olympics coverage, how
ever. NBC's coverage has been pre
dictably sappy, with wall-to-wall
coverage of Michael Phelps.
Coverage has not benefited the seri
ous sports fan, as the focus has been
on individual competitors and their
soft-lighted stories, rather than the
actual competitions themselves. To
a certain extent, 1 can understand
the narrow-bore focus on Phelps;
he's been the only American athlete
so far to achieve dominance in his
sport besides female gymnasts
Nastia Liukin and Shawn Johnson,
who traded off defeating the thir
teen-year-old Chinese gymnasts. I
could write a lot about the
Olympics, but I think it is important
to make three points that the media
seems disinclined to.
1) These Olympics have only
strengthened my discomfort with
sports in which victory is completely
determined by judges. We've seen
some gymnasts — namely Liukin,
who tied for first in one event but
received a silver medal — be denied

what is rightfully theirs by the
arcana of a scoring system that no
one seems to understand. Most
sports at least attempt to be trans
parent in their method for determin
ing victors and let matters be settled
on the playing field. Gymnastics,
controlled by a small cabal of insid
ers and experts, seems to pride itself
on being complicated. The sport's
governing authorities obstinately
refuse to even look into the "allega
tions" (which are obvious to every
one) that the PRC is using underage
gymnasts.
2) There's also been considerable
consternation in the media about
China's huge lead in gold medals,
which they will likely carry through
to the end. It's rather unprecedent
ed that the U.S. is losing by so many
in the gold meal count. What we
don't realize is that the U.S., in
recent Olympic history, had only
dominated the medal count in 19%.
In 1992, the U.S. actually lost to the
Unified Team (comprised of all the
former Soviet states besides the
Baltics). In 2(MX), the U.S. barely
scraped by, 91-88, over the Russians.
In 2004, the U.S. only won 102-92.
The rise of China as America's main
sports threat is new, however, and

likely to continue for the decades to
come, as the Russian team has
turned in a middling performance at
these Olympics.
3) There's been an interesting
debate in political circles about the
U.S. Olympic Committee wanting to
ask Congress to supplement their
$130 million annual budget, which
comes from mostly private sources
and corporate sponsorships. Most
countries receive generous state
subsidies for international athletics
competitions, most notably the
Chinese, who are said to have 46,000
full-time athletes on the state pay
roll. Funding from the federal gov
ernment (if it replaces some corpo
rate sponsorships) might be in the
best interest of the U.S. Olympic
Team, as the use of athletes (who
make barely enough to get by) for
corporations' profit is one of the
greatest misfortunes of the modern
Olympics.
Despite my enjoyment of the
Olympics, the intensity of the cover
age in the American media has been
exhausting and I will be glad when it
is all over. Not only is it detracting
from the presidential election, but
it's also detracting from preseason
coverage of college football, which
is surely the most important annual
event in sports.

Florida will take the title. Send your
