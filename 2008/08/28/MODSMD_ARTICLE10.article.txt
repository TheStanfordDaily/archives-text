# Students help out, learn from clinics overseas

"Eze," I asked, "I was just wondering...
when someone gets injured... say, falls from
a tree or, God forbid, [gets] shot or stabbed.
.. what happens to them?"
"If I found a man shot on my doorstep, I
would give him some water and some
bread."
"But what about his life? Is the hospital
called? Does anyone take him to the hospi
tal?"
"Oh no, no no no. Calling the hospital
will bring the police here. They will beat us,
and arrest us."
"But if there is no hospital care... does
anyone do anything? Do they... survive? "
Eze responded, "Those who are fit will
survive..."
(Excerpt from Jared Sun, Spring 2008)

Jarcd Sun '09 encountered the grim reali
ty of a South African township's emer
gency medical care system on one of his
first days with Stanford's Cape Town,
South Africa program. The experience was
enough to prompt Sun and other Stanford
students to help improve local critical-case
response, and after contending with South
African norms, the group decided that a com
munity-based EMT system could address the
failing government service. Much of the rest
of their study abroad experience then focused
on establishing the local infrastructure.
Sun is one of a growing number of
Stanford students whose interests in medicine
and healthcare have fused with an itch to go
abroad, either in a University study-abroad
program, a summer seminar or a self-driven
scheme. Often fresh from Humßio lecture,
these students are exploring medicine and
healthcare internationally, and they're finding
that being a doctor's shadow abroad — let
alone making an impact — means adapting to
an entirely new set of beliefs about human

need.
Emily Dansereau '10 learned firsthand
this summer in Cochabamba, Bolivia that
outsiders have to be prepared to let the local
institutions they encounter govern what stu
dents can do to help.
Dansereau and Brindha
Saravanabavanandhan'lo were eager to teach
young Bolivian girls about healthy exercise
when they first arrived in Cochabamba. They
were surprised, however, when they were told
to stop a yoga demonstration they were giving
at a women's center. It "went against the cen
ter's philosophy," they were told, because
yoga was not Christian.
Over the next few weeks in the clinics,
Dansereau confronted homophobia, conflict
ing opinions about birth control and teen preg
nancy and a wariness towards Americans.
"I was conscious to say that I am opposed
to many of the current government's policies,"
Dansereau said. "I sometimes felt that I was

actively distancing myself from my
identity as an American."
Regardless of the reservations she
faced daily at the Cochabamba clinic,
Dansereau eventually found that the
materials and infrastructure to make a
serious difference existed — it was sim
ply a matter of asking.
About three weeks into the pro
gram, Dansereau and a fellow volun
teer envisioned a new project.
"Another volunteer and I wanted
to start a dental health project," she
said. "We asked at the clinic if they
had ideas of where we could get infor
mational material. They told us that
they actually already have lots of
materials — for dental health [as well
as] rabies, maternal health and other
projects. All the materials were just
sitting there because there was no one
to use them."
Dansereau, armed with 700 tooth
brushes and 300 tubes of toothpaste,
led demonstrations of healthy dental
hygiene to all who would listen, and

ended up making the impact she
sought to make.
Though Dansereau and Sun
reported that the clinics they served
struggled with bureaucratic shortcom
ings, not all aspects of the medical sys
tems that Stanford students have
encountered abroad reflect negatively
on the infrastructure of the govern
ments there.
Dansereau was impressed by the
fact that, in Bolivia, consultations and
treatments are relatively inexpensive.
A consultation, for example, costs six
bolivianos, equivalent to about 85
cents.
Sun saw the most generosity pour
ing from individual nurses, volunteers
and community organizations within
the townships he visited. He shad
owed a single nurse, and her bravery
was nothing like a routine round at
Lucille Packard Children's Hospital.
"[She was] the only nurse on duty
for a hospital condemned with gun
shot wounds, stabs, drugs and alco
hol," Sun said.
Though they have a starkly differ
ent set of customs to adapt to, the
budding healthcare advocates and
practitioners offered the same general
wisdom on embarking on a clinical

experience abroad. Change, they
noted, comes after weeks of shadow
ing doctors and seeing the unbeliev
able range of cases that come through
a clinic daily. It takes understanding
and creativity to assess a clinic com
munity's needs from the outside.
Sun still maintains contact with the
EMT program he helped establish,
and it has been one of his greatest
undertakings as a Stanford student.
"The idea is community empower
ment," he said. "It is one of the most
ambitious projects I've ever done
independently, and even if it is not
fully successful, I know that I am at
least making some benefit and that I
will learn a lot through the process."
Dansereau agreed that learning
through doing is what makes studying
abroad so valuable.
"It's so easy to get comfortable at
Stanford and caught up in your life
there," she said. "There's the poten
tial to learn a lot from time in a med
ical setting abroad; there's also the
potential to contribute a lot. But if you
want to do either of these, you will
have to be very proactive."

Dansereau confronted homophobia, conflict
ing opinions about birth control and teen preg
nancy and a wariness towards Americans.
"I was conscious to say that I am opposed
to many of the current government's policies,"
Dansereau said. "I sometimes felt that I was

actively distancing myself from my
identity as an American."
Regardless of the reservations she
faced daily at the Cochabamba clinic,
Dansereau eventually found that the
materials and infrastructure to make a
serious difference existed — it was sim
ply a matter of asking.
About three weeks into the pro
gram, Dansereau and a fellow volun
teer envisioned a new project.
"Another volunteer and I wanted
to start a dental health project," she
said. "We asked at the clinic if they
had ideas of where we could get infor
mational material. They told us that
they actually already have lots of
materials — for dental health [as well
as] rabies, maternal health and other
projects. All the materials were just
sitting there because there was no one
to use them."
Dansereau, armed with 700 tooth
brushes and 300 tubes of toothpaste,
led demonstrations of healthy dental
hygiene to all who would listen, and

ended up making the impact she
sought to make.
Though Dansereau and Sun
reported that the clinics they served
struggled with bureaucratic shortcom
ings, not all aspects of the medical sys
tems that Stanford students have
encountered abroad reflect negatively
on the infrastructure of the govern
ments there.
Dansereau was impressed by the
fact that, in Bolivia, consultations and
treatments are relatively inexpensive.
A consultation, for example, costs six
bolivianos, equivalent to about 85
cents.
Sun saw the most generosity pour
ing from individual nurses, volunteers
and community organizations within
the townships he visited. He shad
owed a single nurse, and her bravery
was nothing like a routine round at
Lucille Packard Children's Hospital.
"[She was] the only nurse on duty
for a hospital condemned with gun
shot wounds, stabs, drugs and alco
hol," Sun said.
Though they have a starkly differ
ent set of customs to adapt to, the
budding healthcare advocates and
practitioners offered the same general
wisdom on embarking on a clinical

experience abroad. Change, they
noted, comes after weeks of shadow
ing doctors and seeing the unbeliev
able range of cases that come through
a clinic daily. It takes understanding
and creativity to assess a clinic com
munity's needs from the outside.
Sun still maintains contact with the
EMT program he helped establish,
and it has been one of his greatest
undertakings as a Stanford student.
"The idea is community empower
ment," he said. "It is one of the most
ambitious projects I've ever done
independently, and even if it is not
fully successful, I know that I am at
least making some benefit and that I
will learn a lot through the process."
Dansereau agreed that learning
through doing is what makes studying
abroad so valuable.
"It's so easy to get comfortable at
Stanford and caught up in your life
there," she said. "There's the poten
tial to learn a lot from time in a med
ical setting abroad; there's also the
potential to contribute a lot. But if you
want to do either of these, you will
have to be very proactive."
