"Eze," I asked, "I was just wondering...
when someone gets injured... say, falls from
a tree or, God forbid, [gets] shot or stabbed.
.. what happens to them?"
"If I found a man shot on my doorstep, I
would give him some water and some
bread."
"But what about his life? Is the hospital
called? Does anyone take him to the hospi
tal?"
"Oh no, no no no. Calling the hospital
will bring the police here. They will beat us,
and arrest us."
"But if there is no hospital care... does
anyone do anything? Do they... survive? "
Eze responded, "Those who are fit will
survive..."
(Excerpt from Jared Sun, Spring 2008)

Jarcd Sun '09 encountered the grim reali
ty of a South African township's emer
gency medical care system on one of his
first days with Stanford's Cape Town,
South Africa program. The experience was
enough to prompt Sun and other Stanford
students to help improve local critical-case
response, and after contending with South
African norms, the group decided that a com
munity-based EMT system could address the
failing government service. Much of the rest
of their study abroad experience then focused
on establishing the local infrastructure.
Sun is one of a growing number of
Stanford students whose interests in medicine
and healthcare have fused with an itch to go
abroad, either in a University study-abroad
program, a summer seminar or a self-driven
scheme. Often fresh from Humßio lecture,
these students are exploring medicine and
healthcare internationally, and they're finding
that being a doctor's shadow abroad — let
alone making an impact — means adapting to
an entirely new set of beliefs about human

need.
Emily Dansereau '10 learned firsthand
this summer in Cochabamba, Bolivia that
outsiders have to be prepared to let the local
institutions they encounter govern what stu
dents can do to help.
Dansereau and Brindha
Saravanabavanandhan'lo were eager to teach
young Bolivian girls about healthy exercise
when they first arrived in Cochabamba. They
were surprised, however, when they were told
to stop a yoga demonstration they were giving
at a women's center. It "went against the cen
ter's philosophy," they were told, because
yoga was not Christian.
Over the next few weeks in the clinics,
Dansereau confronted homophobia, conflict
ing opinions about birth control and teen preg
nancy and a wariness towards Americans.
"I was conscious to say that I am opposed
to many of the current government's policies,"
Dansereau said. "I sometimes felt that I was
