## Growing Up McCain Paul Craft 
### 
Igrew up with John McCain. His
Arizona senate offices — and
now, "Southwestern Campaign
Headquarters" — are just blocks
from my childhood home in Phoenix,
Ariz. Located on the unassuming
16th St. in a short glass building across
from an auto repair place, I passed
these offices every day for nine years
on the way to school. Further along
this same route was John McCain's
church. North Phoenix Baptist
Church. Then, just a few blocks north
of my destination was one of his half
dozen houses. Finally, a few blocks
south was the Catholic high school
attended by some of my neighbor
hood friends and John McCain's son,
who is now serving in Iraq.
So as a native Arizonan, I have
long lived with John McCain's
admirable ideals and frustrating con
tradictions. Growing up in a staunch
ly Republican family, we, like many
others in Arizona, traced our political
attitudes back to the days of Barry
Goldwater. He held an iconoclastic
libertarian outlook that likely grew
out of Arizona's hot and lonely fron
tier lifestyle. Nowadays, Goldwater is
the political patron saint of the
"leave-me-alone" philosophy. But
McCain, much to Arizona
Republicans' chagrin, never sub
scribed to this philosophy. He does
adhere selectively, most notably on
economic issues. But while
Goldwater's primary unit of political
thinking was the individual, McCain's
primary unit of political thinking is
the nation.

This was always apparent in
McCain's relationship to Arizona.
While he was physically a part of my
life in Arizona, in most respects,
McCain never really belonged to our
state. It is not because he is not a
native Ari/.onan — very few people
of his generation are natives. Rather,
McCain has always deliberately rep
resented the United States of
America above and beyond the state
of Arizona.
Indeed, McCain is, as columnist
David Brooks said, a "romantic
nationalist" — a devotee of
America and "a cause larger than
one's self." Just look at this year's
Republican National Convention
theme: "Country First." The people
of Arizona, in his thinking, are
essentially another special interest
looking out for its own narrow inter
ests and not the interest of the
nation-at-large. Of course, of any
body, John McCain has credibility
to talk about national service — he
has spent his life at the Naval
Academy, in the Navy, in a POW
camp and in Congress. Let's just say
that he is an authority on serving
America. It is this overarching
theme that binds together what is an
otherwise erratic political outlook.
Indeed, McCain uses larger,
romantic ideas like national duly,
greater good and personal integrity
to guide his decisions on smaller indi

vidua! issues. His political thinking
defies easy placement on the usual
political spectrum and certainly party
labels. Moreover, this outlook means
he is far from a policy wonk. While
policy wonks look at the painstaking
details of individual bills and plans,
McCain assumes that his sound
ideals will guide the minutia. He
finds romantic crusades, like fighting
federal corruption or fighting terror,
and then legislates accordingly. He is
a man of principled ends, not
detailed means.
While growing up in Arizona and
still today, I appreciate and respect
McCain's romantic outlook. I think
his heart is in the right place. (The
national media, most of America and
a vast majority of Arizona have,
according to polls, long shared my
affection for him.) But I'm not sure
that this is McCain's moment in histo
ry. I think the problems that we face
today are more complex than he
makes them out to be. While he
wants to reduce our age to sweeping
and stark battles, it seems to me that
we're really in an age of complexity. I
just hope that he will begin to address
these complexities —to channel his
bigger ideas through good policy, par
ticularly more reasonable foreign pol
icy. Then I'd be proud to see his
Arizona senate offices move from
16th St. to 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.
