Stanford professor emeritus of education

91.
Gage retired two decades ago, but was still
active in his field — he had just finished writing
a book, A Conception of Education, that will be
published this year.
Gage's many accomplishments include co
founding the Stanford Center for the Research
and Development in Teaching, being elected to
the National Academy of Education and win
ning the E. L. Thorndike Award for Career
Achievement in Educational Psychology from
the American Psychological Association.

"Nate came into the office every day right up
to his final days," Dean of Education Deborah
Stipek told the Stanford News Service. "I kidded
him about being my most conscientious faculty
member. He kidded me about being the prettiest
dean he'd ever had and the only one he'd ever
kissed — on the cheek, of course. He was devot
ed to his work and to Stanford. It is hard to imag
ine the school without him."
A memorial service for Gage will be held at
Stanford in early November.
Facebook moves to Stanford Research Park
Stanford Research Park, once home to tech
nology legends including Hewlett-Packard,
General Electric and Lockheed, will now play
host to Facebook. The prominent social net
working company is seeking to consolidate its
various Palo Alto locations while it looks for a
long-term real estate solution.
Facebook is leaving behind several down
town Palo Alto locations in favor of the larger
Stanford Research Park building to remedy the
fragmentation that comes with having five sepa
rate company locations in the area.
The company will move into its new digs
early next year. Facebook has not yet announced
where it plans to move next, and it is not known

whether a permanent campus will be located in
the Palo Alto area.
Stanford opens new childcare facility
A new childcare center opening in Escondido
village next Tuesday will enroll KM) children,
becoming the fourth center on campus to pro
vide lull time child care. The center will be man
aged by a non-profit. Children's Creative
Learning Centers (CCLC).
Stanford's Board of Trustees approved plans
last April for a second phase of child-care center
development, which will add a $5.4 million cen
ter in 2010 to accommodate an additional 1(H)
children.
Stanford provides as much as $5000 to some
Stanford employees with children under 10 years
old for childcare.
"There are other schools that subsidize only
the people that get to get into their centers. This
is more broad," said Teresa Rasco, director of
Work Life Office, a division of Stanford Human
Resources which oversees CCLC, to Stanford
News Service. "The need is very big — not only
at Stanford, but in the community. And that's
one reason why Stanford has taken on more cen
ters, because the community is so impacted and
finding childcare is difficult."
