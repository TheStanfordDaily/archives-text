## FOOTBALL Cardinal keys to success in 2008 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY STAFF WRITER 
When Stanford lakes on Oregon
State tonight, it will mark the start
of what looks to be a second season
of rebuilding under head coach Jim
Harbaugh. After a 4-8 record last
year — a three-win improvement
from 2006 — the Cardinal finds
itself at a critical juncture. Will the
team continue its progression and
possibly play its way into bowl con
tention, or will the squad's improve
ment stagnate or worse, regress?
As football is a team sport, these
questions cannot be answered by the
play of any one individual — success
clearly depends on the play of the
squad as a whole. But specific points
of interest can help make or break
the Cardinal's season. Four of Ihem
make up our keys to the season.
The play of quarterback Tavita
Pritchard
Despite stiff competition in
spring practice and summer camp
from junior Alex Loukas and senior
Jason Forcier, Pritchard, the senior
incumbent 08, never relinquished
the starting quarterback job. But
with that contest over, the real tests
are just beginning. Pritchard forev
er etched himself into Stanford lore
with his performance against USC
last October, but the rest of his sea
son was shaky. He had trouble find
ing the end zone and, despite con
sistently throwing for close to 200
yards a game, had some problems
with his accuracy, completing just
50 percent of his passes for the sea
son. He was never able to win the
No. 1 OB job entirely, and % split a
considerable amount of time with
T.C. Ostrander '08.
Pritchard worked specifically on
his accuracy this off-season, and in
the process earned the trust of his
coach — the job is now his to lose.
If he becomes a OB who can direct
a game from the pocket, while also

Quote to Note:
"I know taking shots deep will be in their
game plan. That's what they resorted to
last year. I expect them to try to run the
ball a lot more. They are pretty excited
about their offensive line and their run
ning back is healthy, so I expect to see a
lot more run-first and get the deep ball
mixed in." —Oregon State safety Greg

Soph. Ryan Whalen emerged over the summer to challenge the Cardinal's
top returning receiver, junior Richard Sherman, for his starting job. The pair
shared a spot atop the depth chart prior to the season opener.
succeed. If not, Stanford could be in
for a rude awakening.
Red Zone production
With an injury-decimated rush
ing attack and uneven quarterback
play, Stanford had a hard time mov
ing the ball last season. But that
turned out to be an almost secondary
offensive problem. When the
Stanford squad entered the Red
Zone (inside the 20-yard line), they
simply could not score. In 37 Red
Zone attempts, Stanford hit pay-dirt
just 27 times, a 72.97-percent success
rate, which was good for last in the
Pac-10 and 104 th out of 119 Division-
I teams. If you can't score touch
downs, you can't win. The Cardinal
must improve upon this percentage
to succeed in 2(X)8.
Can the young wide receivers ade
quately replace Mark Bradford and
Evan Moore?
Last season, now-graduated
seniors Mark Bradford and Evan
Moore accounted for over a third of
the Cardinal's receiving attack. With
the pair now gone, Stanford will
have to replace their production.
Junior Richard Sherman, who led
the team in yards and touchdowns
through the air last year, is an obvi
ous candidate for the job. But Ryan
Whalen, who had all of one catch
last season, has pressed him hard for
his starting job in camp. This, of

course, is both good and bad. On the
one hand, Whalen's tenacity shows
that he's ready for a larger role this
season; but on the other hand,
Sherman, who will be relied upon
heavily, should have secured his job.
Doug Baldwin, whose athleticism
was put on display on both offense
and special teams last year, will like
ly start as well. A host of other
reserve wide-outs will also have to
step up. Can they do it? The
Cardinal certainly has the talent.
The squad should surpass Moore
and Bradford's combined four
touchdowns last season, and make
up close to the yardage total as well.
Can the linebacker corps live up to its
billing?
The Cardinal's most dominant unit
heading into the new season is its line
backers. Senior Pat Maynor and red
shirt junior Clinton Snyder were both
selected to the preseason Butkus
Award watch list. Chike Amajoyi, who
earned Pac-10 All-Frosh honors last
season, joins them as the third starter.
A solid reserve corps that includes
Nick Macaluso and Thaddeus Chase
backs them up. It makes for one of the
top linebacking units in the confer
ence, and has put Stanford's defense
on the preseason map.
But can they justify the hype?
Synder will move from middle line
backer to the outside this year — he
will be freed up to better rush the
passer, his specialty. Amajoyi, who
thrives on contact, will move to
MLB. where he'll see the most action
in that regard. Maynor, another tack
ling machine, will once again roam at

OLB. If all three perform to expecta
tions— with Snyder providing hack
field pressure and Amajoyi and
Maynor swallowing up the short
attack — then Stanford's defense will
be a force.
First up: Oregon State
The Cardinal's first big test of
2(X)8 comes in its first week of play as

they take on the conference-rival
Beavers. Oregon State topped
Stanford 23-6 on Oct. 27 last season
and 30-7 in the teams' last meeting at
Stanford. A family reunion is also on
tap as Harbaugh's son. Jay, a fresh
man at Oregon State, works on the
OSIJ coaching staff as a student assis
tant.
"I feel like this is a better team

than we had last year," Harbaugh
told the San Jose Mercury News. "So
many signs are there. Hopefully, that
translates into more wins, but that's
why you go play the games — to find
out."
Kickoff is scheduled for 6 p.m.
tonight at Stanford Stadium, with
the game slated for live broadcast on
ESPN2.
