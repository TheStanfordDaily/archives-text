## FOOTBALL Cardinal keys to success in 2008 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY STAFF WRITER 
When Stanford lakes on Oregon
State tonight, it will mark the start
of what looks to be a second season
of rebuilding under head coach Jim
Harbaugh. After a 4-8 record last
year — a three-win improvement
from 2006 — the Cardinal finds
itself at a critical juncture. Will the
team continue its progression and
possibly play its way into bowl con
tention, or will the squad's improve
ment stagnate or worse, regress?
As football is a team sport, these
questions cannot be answered by the
play of any one individual — success
clearly depends on the play of the
squad as a whole. But specific points
of interest can help make or break
the Cardinal's season. Four of Ihem
make up our keys to the season.
The play of quarterback Tavita
Pritchard
Despite stiff competition in
spring practice and summer camp
from junior Alex Loukas and senior
Jason Forcier, Pritchard, the senior
incumbent 08, never relinquished
the starting quarterback job. But
with that contest over, the real tests
are just beginning. Pritchard forev
er etched himself into Stanford lore
with his performance against USC
last October, but the rest of his sea
son was shaky. He had trouble find
ing the end zone and, despite con
sistently throwing for close to 200
yards a game, had some problems
with his accuracy, completing just
50 percent of his passes for the sea
son. He was never able to win the
No. 1 OB job entirely, and % split a
considerable amount of time with
T.C. Ostrander '08.
Pritchard worked specifically on
his accuracy this off-season, and in
the process earned the trust of his
coach — the job is now his to lose.
If he becomes a OB who can direct
a game from the pocket, while also

hard times. The Beavers are 8-3 against

Quote to Note:
"I know taking shots deep will be in their
game plan. That's what they resorted to
last year. I expect them to try to run the
ball a lot more. They are pretty excited
about their offensive line and their run
ning back is healthy, so I expect to see a
lot more run-first and get the deep ball
mixed in." —Oregon State safety Greg

Soph. Ryan Whalen emerged over the summer to challenge the Cardinal's
top returning receiver, junior Richard Sherman, for his starting job. The pair
shared a spot atop the depth chart prior to the season opener.
