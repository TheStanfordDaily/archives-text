## Stanford ready to seize elusive NCAA title in '08 
### JACK DUANE DAILY VISITING IN TERN 
It's always tough to lose the
championship game. That feeling of
coming so far but not quite far
enough has been all too familiar
lately for the Stanford women's vol
leyball team. In 2(X)6, the Cardinal
fell to Nebraska in the NCAA final.
Last year Stanford fought its way
back to the championship game,
where the team dug its way out of a
2-0 deficit against Penn State, only
to lose in five sets.

The Cardinal will embark on the
2008 season with those devastating
losses in the past, but undoubtedly
lingering in the minds of the team's
returning players.
"Life's too short to let [the loss
es] bother you," head coach John
Dunning said. "But I definitely
think it motivates them."
The No. 2 Cardinal begins its
season tomorrow and Dunning
hasn't provided the team with a
schedule full of cupcake opponents
to boost their confidence. The team
will head to Omaha, Neb. to start

the season in the Runza/AVCA
Showcase at the Quest Center.
After Stanford plays No. 7
Nebraska in front of a partisan-
Husker crowd on Friday, the squad
will meet No. 3 Texas in its second
match on Sunday. USC rounds out
the Showcase's field, but the two
Pac-10 Conference powers will not
meet.
The key to Stanford's success
this year will be its group of return
ing All-American hitters: rising
seniors Foluke Akinradewo and
Cynthia Barboza and rising sopho

more Alix Klineman. Akinradewo
won Ihe AVCA National Player of
the Year last season and has been
selected as a captain by the coaches
heading into the 2008 campaign.
Klineman, standing at 6-foot-4, was
the Pac-10 Freshman of the year
and led the team with an average of
4.12 kills per game.
All three All-American hitters
spent the offseason training with
the world's best players as part of
the U.S. National Training Team.
Dunning doesn't mind that his three
stars missed working out with the
team because "their confidence
level is in a new world."
"It's really amazing how much
they mature in that situation," he
said.
Also, Cardinal fans need not
worry about Klineman's sore shoul
der. The U.S. National Team had
her avoid hitting for two months and
the results have been superb. All
signs indicate that she will be 100
percent for the start of the season.
Beyond the stars, Stanford
returns 11 players and six mem
bers of last year's starting rotation.
The squad is teeming with playoff
experience, as seven Cardinal vet
erans have been to the Final Four
twice.
Dunning, one of the winningest
coaches in NCAA history, recruited
a solid class to add to the mix and
has been impressed with the contri
butions of the freshmen during fall
camp. Jessica Walker, a 6-1 middle
blocker, is widely considered to be
the gem of the class and was highly
recruited out of Booker T.
Washington High School in
Houston.
Also new to the game are a few
significant rule changes that were
made over the summer. In following
international standards, NCAA
games will now be played to 25
instead of 30 points. The effect on
strategy is significant, Dunning
admitted, adding that "a quick start
is huge now and there [will be] a lot
less time to play through things."
Games will be shorter and coaches
can only make 12 substitutions,
compared with 15 last year.
The Cardinal will fly from
Omaha to play Central Florida on
Sept. 2, where a new gym is being

opened. The team will finish its road
trip in Missouri at the St. Louis
Invitational on Sept 5 and 6.
After staying in California for the
rest of the month, Stanford will
enter Pae-10 competition that is as
tough as ever. Six teams in the con
ference are ranked in the top 10
nationally.
Dunning said that his early sea

son goals are for the team to "enjoy
the moment and develop a group
spirit." Come December, that could
be the difference between going
home losers and bringing Stanford's
seventh women's volleyball national
championship back to the Farm.

Sophomore Alix Klineman is a key returning member of the Cardinal squad
that has finished second in the nation in each of the last two years. Klineman,
along with rising seniors Foluke Akinradewo and Cynthia Barboza, should
form a terrific trio of returning Ail-American hitters for the Cardinal in 2008.
