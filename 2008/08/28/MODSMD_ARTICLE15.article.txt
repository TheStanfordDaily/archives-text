## Stanford ready to seize elusive NCAA title in '08 
### JACK DUANE DAILY VISITING IN TERN 
It's always tough to lose the
championship game. That feeling of
coming so far but not quite far
enough has been all too familiar
lately for the Stanford women's vol
leyball team. In 2(X)6, the Cardinal
fell to Nebraska in the NCAA final.
Last year Stanford fought its way
back to the championship game,
where the team dug its way out of a
2-0 deficit against Penn State, only
to lose in five sets.

The Cardinal will embark on the
2008 season with those devastating
losses in the past, but undoubtedly
lingering in the minds of the team's
returning players.
"Life's too short to let [the loss
es] bother you," head coach John
Dunning said. "But I definitely
think it motivates them."
The No. 2 Cardinal begins its
season tomorrow and Dunning
hasn't provided the team with a
schedule full of cupcake opponents
to boost their confidence. The team
will head to Omaha, Neb. to start

the season in the Runza/AVCA
Showcase at the Quest Center.
After Stanford plays No. 7
Nebraska in front of a partisan-
Husker crowd on Friday, the squad
will meet No. 3 Texas in its second
match on Sunday. USC rounds out
the Showcase's field, but the two
Pac-10 Conference powers will not
meet.
The key to Stanford's success
this year will be its group of return
ing All-American hitters: rising
seniors Foluke Akinradewo and
Cynthia Barboza and rising sopho

more Alix Klineman. Akinradewo
won Ihe AVCA National Player of
the Year last season and has been
selected as a captain by the coaches
heading into the 2008 campaign.
Klineman, standing at 6-foot-4, was
the Pac-10 Freshman of the year
and led the team with an average of
4.12 kills per game.
All three All-American hitters
spent the offseason training with
the world's best players as part of
the U.S. National Training Team.
