## Dictionary of Olympic proportions 
### 
Alter two weeks of the
Olympics, it's time to let the
glamour and spectacle die
down and move on to more impor
tant things: what actually happened
in Beijing. So take a seat and break
open the 2008 Abridged Olympic
Dictionary: a comprehensive guide
to (almost) everything Olympic.
Heartbreak: Lolo Jones. It only
took a few centimeters for the gold
medal to slip out of her hands as she
hit the ninth hurdle. Visibly dis
traught as she crumbled after the
finish line, Jones showed a lot of
integrity in accepting her disappoint
ing seventh-place finish.
Flop: The United States 4xloom
relay teams. Maybe they should go
back to the old Superglue trick to
help them hold onto the baton.
Success: Michael Phelps. He
dominated the Games in winning a
record eight gold medals. He is an
unquestionably deserving champion.
Memorable: The guy who "ran"
around the Bird's Nest at the
Opening Ceremonies before he lit
the torch. Now that was something
special.
Boring: The men's and women's
marathons. Did NBC have nothing
better to show so that we had to
watch almost the entire two-hour
race?
Questionable: Usain Bolt. Come
on, you know this question is going
to be asked for years to come. I
would love for the man to be clean,
but his performances may have been
too good.
Sick: Looks sickening, that is. I'm
talking about those fried scorpions
they kept showing at the Chinese
markets. Fried scorpions? Really?
Too Long: The eight years
between USA men's basketball's
gold medals. How is it possible that
those guys ever lost a game?
Short: Shawn Johnson.
Enough: I can't be the only one
who is sick of Michael Phelps' moth
er. Enough with the human interest
stories and back to the events,
please.
Inspiring: Dara Torres. She is 41
and she was beating 16- and 17-year
olds.
Surprising: The Chinese women's
gymnastics team. Not surprising that
they were so successful, but shock
ing that some people actually
believe all of them were at least 16
years old.
Ironic: The fact that medalist
Kim Jong-Su was disqualified for
using performance enhancing sub
stances — in the 50-mcter pistol
shooting event. Maybe he just want
ed to look buff when he was stand
ing on the medalists' platform.
Weird: Rhythmic gymnastics.
Maybe I'm the weird one for watch
ing more than 30 seconds of it. But
really, this is an Olympic sport? 1
guess the intricacies of the baton
twirl still elude me.
Wacky: Kerri Walsh's wedding
ring goes flying over the net and into
the sand, prompting a delay to look
for it. If the ring were the ball, she
would have had a beautiful kill.
Fast: Jason Lezak closing in on
France in the final leg of the 4xl (X)m
freestyle relay. That race is going to
be You Tubed for years to come.
Phelps should be giving Lezak some
of his endorsement money for
pulling that one out for him and
keeping the quest for eight alive.
Slow: Everyone not from
Jamaica, the United Slates or
Kenya.
Close: The Chinese tried every
thing to win the medal count, but
they still couldn't quite do it. The
U.S. will have its hands full in the
future.
Fun: Don't you think it would be
really fun to be an athlete at the
Olympics? Who cares what sport it
is? Let's see ... underwater trap
shooting while holding a chicken in
2012, anyone?
Aina/.ing: Phelps' .01 second vic
tory in the 100-meter butterfly over
Miiorad Cavic. I got tingles every
time I watched a replay. There's

another guy who should get a cut of
Phelps' endorsement contract.
Cool: The Water Cube and the
Bird's Nest. I've got to give it up to
the Chinese — the venues were
pretty awesome.
Unbelievable: The random
attack on the family of men's volley
ball coach Hugh McCutcheon.
Unexplainable violence and a tragic
outcome.
Triumph: The men's volleyball
gold medal. McCutcheon put
together a true story of overcoming
the worst possible tragedy. It is one
of the feel-good stories of this
Olympics.
Dull: Breaking a world record in
swimming. What used to be revered,
hallowed and rare became a some
times twice-daily occurrence. It's
got to be the new swimsuits.
Defeat: As good as the U.S. soft
ball team is. they only came home
with silver and I have never seen a
team look so devastated. Rightfully
so. as Softball is now out of the
Olympics.
Athlete: Bryan Clay. The
decathlon gold medalist represents
the spirit of the Olympic Games bet
ter than just about anyone else. Clay
is the epitome of athletic prowess.
End: No matter what I have said
so far, I still enjoyed watching the
Olympics, as I do every four years.
The flame luts now burned out in
Beijing, and it's now up to London
in 2012. For once, this phrase isn't a
cliche: The entire world waits.

is? Let's see ... underwater trap
shooting while holding a chicken in
2012, anyone?
Aina/.ing: Phelps' .01 second vic
tory in the 100-meter butterfly over
Miiorad Cavic. I got tingles every
time I watched a replay. There's

another guy who should get a cut of
Phelps' endorsement contract.
Cool: The Water Cube and the
Bird's Nest. I've got to give it up to
the Chinese — the venues were
pretty awesome.
Unbelievable: The random
attack on the family of men's volley
ball coach Hugh McCutcheon.
Unexplainable violence and a tragic
outcome.
Triumph: The men's volleyball
gold medal. McCutcheon put
together a true story of overcoming
the worst possible tragedy. It is one
of the feel-good stories of this
Olympics.
Dull: Breaking a world record in
swimming. What used to be revered,
hallowed and rare became a some
times twice-daily occurrence. It's
got to be the new swimsuits.
Defeat: As good as the U.S. soft
ball team is. they only came home
with silver and I have never seen a
team look so devastated. Rightfully
so. as Softball is now out of the
Olympics.
Athlete: Bryan Clay. The
decathlon gold medalist represents
the spirit of the Olympic Games bet
ter than just about anyone else. Clay
is the epitome of athletic prowess.
End: No matter what I have said
so far, I still enjoyed watching the
Olympics, as I do every four years.
The flame luts now burned out in
Beijing, and it's now up to London
in 2012. For once, this phrase isn't a
cliche: The entire world waits.

Danny Belch and the rest of the
nation is going to have to get back to
watching events that don't involve
batons... or twirling. Email him at
