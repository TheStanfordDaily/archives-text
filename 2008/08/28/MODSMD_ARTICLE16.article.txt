## Dictionary of Olympic proportions 
### 
Alter two weeks of the
Olympics, it's time to let the
glamour and spectacle die
down and move on to more impor
tant things: what actually happened
in Beijing. So take a seat and break
open the 2008 Abridged Olympic
Dictionary: a comprehensive guide
to (almost) everything Olympic.
Heartbreak: Lolo Jones. It only
took a few centimeters for the gold
medal to slip out of her hands as she
hit the ninth hurdle. Visibly dis
traught as she crumbled after the
finish line, Jones showed a lot of
integrity in accepting her disappoint
ing seventh-place finish.
Flop: The United States 4xloom
relay teams. Maybe they should go
back to the old Superglue trick to
help them hold onto the baton.
Success: Michael Phelps. He
dominated the Games in winning a
record eight gold medals. He is an
unquestionably deserving champion.
Memorable: The guy who "ran"
around the Bird's Nest at the
Opening Ceremonies before he lit
the torch. Now that was something
special.
Boring: The men's and women's
marathons. Did NBC have nothing
better to show so that we had to
watch almost the entire two-hour
race?
Questionable: Usain Bolt. Come
on, you know this question is going
to be asked for years to come. I
would love for the man to be clean,
but his performances may have been
too good.
Sick: Looks sickening, that is. I'm
talking about those fried scorpions
they kept showing at the Chinese
markets. Fried scorpions? Really?
Too Long: The eight years
between USA men's basketball's
gold medals. How is it possible that
those guys ever lost a game?
Short: Shawn Johnson.
Enough: I can't be the only one
who is sick of Michael Phelps' moth
er. Enough with the human interest
stories and back to the events,
please.
Inspiring: Dara Torres. She is 41
and she was beating 16- and 17-year
olds.
Surprising: The Chinese women's
gymnastics team. Not surprising that
they were so successful, but shock
ing that some people actually
believe all of them were at least 16
years old.
Ironic: The fact that medalist
Kim Jong-Su was disqualified for
using performance enhancing sub
