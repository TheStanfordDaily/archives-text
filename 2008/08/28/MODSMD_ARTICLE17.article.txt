## Kirk keeps her poise despite exclusion from Beijing Games 
### KENAN JIANG STAFF WRITER 
With the Olympics over, swimmer Tara Kirk
'04 continues to vie for a spot on the US
Olympic Swim Team roster, if only for the pride
that would accompany being named among the
nation's swimming elite.
Kirk, a 2(X)4 Athens Olympic silver medal

ist in the 4(X)-meter medley relay, finished third
last June at the U.S. Olympie Trials, losing to
second-place finisher Megan Jendrick by .01
seconds. First-place finisher and former Cal
swimmer Jessica Hardy was the only swimmer
under a 1:07 in the 100-meter women's breast
stroke. Hardy, who now trains with Coach Dave
Salo at USC looked to be an integral part of the
U.S. women's swimming contingent in Beijing

when she qualified for the 4xloo free relay and
also the 50m freestyle, where she was second
only to 41-year-old swimmer Dara Torres.
I ler tremendous showing at the Olympic
Trials had Hardy set to swim in three events in
Beijing before she officially tested positive for a
banned substance on July 24, nearly a month
after the trials, as her samples came back posi
tive-negative-positive in the three-sequence

procedure used by U.S. Doping Agency. Yet,
rather than replacing Hardy with Kirk or anoth
er swimmer, as would seem the logical solution
to the dilemma, USA Swimming elected instead
to replace Hardy in her events with swimmers
already on the Olympic squad.
Kirk was unwilling to comment to The
Weekly on the matter but wrote on
her blog at wcsnblogs.com that she
felt snubbed by the decision to leave
her off the team.
"USA swimming, citing trials cri
teria, has declined to add anyone to
the team," she posted on Aug. 2.
"However, 1 think that if you were to
ask anyone at Trials what should hap
pen if the first-place finisher were to
test positive for a banned substance,
they would tell you that 3rd place
would move up. Such is the culture of
our sport. Not so today."
"I'm frustrated and disillusioned,"
Kirk continued. "But most of all, I am
saddened that the people and organi
zations that I gave a huge part of my
life to couldn't bring themselves to do
the right thing. To make this situation
right. I do not believe that the will to
act could not have changed this situa
tion."
The swimming community was in
uproar over the issue of whether
Hardy's voluntary withdrawal from
the team would mean Kirk, Lara
Jackson (50-meter freestyle), and
Amanda Weir (4xloo free relay)
would be put onto the relay. USA

Swimming's governing body officially
put the cutoff date at July 21 and
Hardy's results came three days 100
late to put the three girls onto the
team. Kirk filed a case against USA
Swimming to overrule the case, but
an arbitrator determined that the
organization had not violated any
rightful procedure in handling the
issue.
In a statement on their website,
USA Swimming's Chuck Wielgus
defended the organization's decision
to keep Kirk off the team, citing poli
cies already in place.
"The procedures clearly state that
we were to submit our entries to the
USOC by July 21 and that after July
21 no new swimmers could be added
to the team," Wielgus wrote.
"Furthermore, the procedures are
very clear about what happens if an
athlete withdraws from the team after
July 21."
Still, Kirk has decided to continue
her fight to be formally named to the
team, despite having already missed
the games, as she wrote in a blog
entry dated Aug. 19.
"I am still working on this and still
fighting [...], if only for the honor,"
she wrote. "I will also continue in
hopes that the right decisions will be
made in similar situations in the
future. Though this experience has

been terrible, it could only be made
worse if I had to watch someone else
go through it four years from now and
think that if 1 had only tried harder I
could have saved them this sorrow."
Kirk, a former world record-hold
er in the 1()0 short course meter
breaststroke, is also an American
record-holder in the I (X) long course
meter breaststroke, and also the 100-
yard breast. Her NCAA career with
Stanford included 11 career NCAA
titles including four in the 1(X) individ
ual breast and three in the 2(X) breast.
