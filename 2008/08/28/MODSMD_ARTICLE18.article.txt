# WOMEN'S SOCCER
## Cardinal offense built to score big 
### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
By all accounts, the 2007 season
was hugely successful for the
Stanford women's soccer team. The
Cardinal lost just three games the
entire season, made the Sweet
Sixteen at the NCAA tournament
for the second year in a row and
even held the nation's number one
ranking for a three week span. So
after graduating six seniors —
including US national team defend
er Rachel Buehler — it might seem
that Stanford would do very well
just to repeat the previous season's
achievements.
Yet this year's squad is deter
mined to do even better, with their

sights set on lifting the College Cup.
And lofty though it is, the Cardinal
has the talent to make it a serious
threat to make a run at its goal.
The NSCAA/Adidas preseason
poll has Stanford ranked No. 10 in
the country while the coaches poll
has the Cardinal sitting atop the
Pacific 10 Conference. The primary
reason for the preseason optimism
is that, even with the loss of last
year's seniors, the team still returns
most of their key players from last
year. Rising junior forward Kelley
O'Hara and senior fullback Marissa
Abegg, both of whom are on this
year's player of the year watch list,
headline a squad full of talented

returning players that also boasts a
senior international player (New
Zealand's Ali Riley) and the reign
ing Pac-10 freshman of the year
(Christen Press).
Another reason for excitement
is an outstanding group of incoming
freshman. Stanford's top-10 ranked
recruiting class is led by midfielder
Teresa Noyola, the 2008 Gatorade
High School Player of the Year.
Cardinal coach Paul Ratcliffe
expects his first year players to con
tribute right away.
"1 think the freshmen are going
to make a huge impact this year,"
Ratcliffe told GoStanford.com.
"They're technically really gifted
players with some attacking flair, so
they should really help us up front
and overall as a team."
The attacking flair that Ratcliffe
mentions applies not only to the
freshmen but to the team as a
whole, as the Cardinal should boast
one of the best attacks in the nation.
Last season's striking trio of
O'Hara, Press and Riley all return
(although Riley will also be playing
in defense this season), and includ
ing rising sophomore Morgan
Redman the group of returning for
wards scored a combined 23 goals
last year. Throw in freshman
Lindsay Taylor and Stanford's
frontline looks like it could be a
problem for any defense.
The Cardinal forwards will be
supported by a talented midfield
that will add creativity to the
offense and ball-winning ability to
the defense. Rising junior Kristin
Stannard was the top-scoring mid
fielder on the 2007 team, scoring
four goals and notching two assists
even though injuries limited her
minutes. She will be joined in the
team's "engine room" by Allison
McCann, who started all but one
game last year in a holding midfield
role, and Noyola, who will be
expected to be a key player in her
first season. Senior Kelley Birch
and redshirt junior Hillary Heath
will also add experience in the mid
dle of the park.
Yet for all the attacking talent
the team has, it may well be the

backline that determines the fate of
the Cardinal. Defense carried the
squad last year as the team let up
only 18 goals in 23 games. Departed
seniors Rachel Buehler and April
Wall were regular starters and
defensive stalwarts on that team, so
returning starters Abegg and
Allison "Kirby" Falk — both
seniors in 2008 — will be counted
on to provide leadership from the
back. The duo is also capable of
helping offensively, as Falk is a dan
gerous header of the ball from set
pieces and Abegg is known for her
charges down the outside of the
pitch.
Abegg and Falk will get help in
the back from junior Alicia Jenkins,
a key reserve last year, and fresh
man Cami Levin, who could very
well be a starting fullback in her
first year on the Farm. The backline
will be playing in front of rising
sophomore Kira Maker, who looks
to have won the job of starting
keeper. Although not a regular
starter. Maker received some expe
rience last year, starting 10 games
and notching two shutouts.
Maker is already halfway to her
shutout total from last year after
blanking Pacific in Stanford's first
match last week. The Cardinal
thrashed the Tigers 5-0 behind two
goals from Christen Press, one
apiece from Kelley O'Hara and
Lindsay Taylor, and a Pacific own
goal.
But it's unlikely that all of the
Cardinal's matches this season will
be quite so easy. The Pac-10
promises to be one of the toughest
conferences in the country, with
USC and UCLA ranked first and
second, respectively, in the national
in the Adidas poll. The Cardinal's
non-conference schedule also
includes No. 3 North Carolina and
No. 14 Boston College.
Despite the hurdles ahead, it's
clear that the time is now for this
Cardinal team to take the next step.
"I'm very excited [for the sea
son] because I think we can go real
ly far," Stannard said. "Even
though we did lose some great
seniors, we have a lot of talented
freshmen who will hopefully help us
win the national title."
