# WOMEN'S SOCCER
## Cardinal offense built to score big 
### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
By all accounts, the 2007 season
was hugely successful for the
Stanford women's soccer team. The
Cardinal lost just three games the
entire season, made the Sweet
Sixteen at the NCAA tournament
for the second year in a row and
even held the nation's number one
ranking for a three week span. So
after graduating six seniors —
including US national team defend
er Rachel Buehler — it might seem
that Stanford would do very well
just to repeat the previous season's
achievements.
Yet this year's squad is deter
mined to do even better, with their

sights set on lifting the College Cup.
And lofty though it is, the Cardinal
has the talent to make it a serious
threat to make a run at its goal.
The NSCAA/Adidas preseason
poll has Stanford ranked No. 10 in
the country while the coaches poll
has the Cardinal sitting atop the
Pacific 10 Conference. The primary
reason for the preseason optimism
is that, even with the loss of last
year's seniors, the team still returns
most of their key players from last
year. Rising junior forward Kelley
O'Hara and senior fullback Marissa
Abegg, both of whom are on this
year's player of the year watch list,
headline a squad full of talented
