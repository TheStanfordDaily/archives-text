## Record haul for Stanford Olympians 
### Denis Griffin 
With the Olympics concluded, it is
now safe to say that the Cardinal had
quite a time at the Beijing Games,
racking up medals left and right in an
effort that left all previous Stanford
Olympic contingents in the dust.
Athletes currently or formerly
associated with Stanford brought
home 25 medals total from the 2(X)8
Olympics — eight gold, 13 silver and
lour bronze — breaking the school's
previous mark of 21 total medals, set
at the 1924 Paris Games. Were
Stanford's athletes a country, the
Cardinal would have finished in 11th
place for total medals, tied with
Japan and better than such other

nations as Jamaica (11 total medals),
Canada (18 total medals) and Spain
(18 total medals).
Perhaps the highest profile
Stanford athlete at the Olympics was
beach volleyball star Kerri Walsh '00,
who, along with teammate Misty
May-Treanor, earned a gold medal
for the U.S.
The Cardinal had 48 athletes
make the trip to China to compete in
the Games, the most since the 19%
Games in Atlanta; 24 of those ath
letes earned medals. Rising junior
swimmer Julia Smit was the lone
Cardinal to medal in multiple events,
winning silver in the 4xloo-meter
freestyle relay and bronze in the
4x2(X) meter relay.
