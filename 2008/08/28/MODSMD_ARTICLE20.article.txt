## BEYOND THE BUBBLE A 						WEEKEND OF CHAOS, GREAT MUSIC Radiohead delivers memorable opening night to San Francisco's Outside Lands festival in Golden Gate Park 
### 
The highly anticipated San Francisco summer
music festival Outside Lands was a mixed suc
cess and was very much a production of its host
city. With eco-friendly info booths; vendors serv
ing up raw vegan burgers and flatbread cheese
less pizza; recycling and compost bins; hippies
and hipsters (there were more hipsters in line for
food than at all of Stanford), people passing
joints and plenty of fog, the Golden Gate Park
event was precisely what it should have been —
despite a few bumps in operation.
The bumps mostly came early on. Before
Radiohead took the stage on Friday night, festi
val-goers — who, according to the San Francisco
Chronicle, numbered more than 15().(XX) over
the three-day weekend — had already trampled
barrier gates. The attendees without tickets
(which cost SO bucks a pop) were jumping fences
behind Port-a-Potties and dissolving into the
massive crowds.
"This is a zoo," exclaimed one woman as she
surveyed the mass collective listening to Beck at
the Sutra stage. Though many attendees agreed
Friday was slightly more hectic than projected,
by Saturday afternoon, Outside Lands had sim
mered down to a manageable festival atmos
phere. Crowds trickled to the grounds and
meandered between the six stages, stopping at
clothing and food booths run by local businesses,
many with a "green" focus. Besides slight orga
nizational missteps, the major problems of the
untried festival were technical. Twice during
Radiohead's performance and several times
more during Tom Petty's act on Saturday, the
amps cut out completely.
By Sunday, the California sunshine broke
through the mist, warming healthy audiences
who watched bands like Stars, Broken Social
Scene and Wilco before setting romantically as
headliner Jack Johnson took the stage. Though
concert promoters touted Radiohead as the first
band to ever play in Golden Gate Park at night,
Johnson had the pleasure of being the first to
play under clear skies, a welcome, laid-back end
to a very tiring, but well spent, weekend. -Kelsey

RADIOHEAD
Radiohead, without a doubt, was the main
draw to Outside Lands on Friday night. During
Beck's pre-Radiohead set, throngs of concertgo
ers made for the exits — they wanted to get good
seats for the headlining act.
The early birds weren't disappointed: As
usual. Thorn Yorke and company met even the
loftiest of expectations. The quintet — seven
years and seven albums into their career —
brought a fiercely creative arid energetic show to
Outside Lands. Radiohead played the main
"Land's End" stage to what looked like the
largest crowd of the entire festival. The huge
grass clearing in front of the main stage was
packed with onlookers, all huddled together
between spidery park trees and under a foggy
night sky. An estimated SXXX) gatecrashers also
added to the fray.
Visually, Radiohead was the best experience
of the concert. The band adorned the cavernous
main stage with a series of hanging columns that
reflected LED colors and light, a large panel of
colored bulbs above and two large video screens
on either side of the stage. The band's generous

use of colors echoed the songs' musical moods: a
soft red for "All I Need," midnight blue for
"There, There" and angry scarlet for "Paranoid
Android." The clear columns also refracted
streams of white LED light, chopping up bits of
color to create sparkles. Meanwhile, the large
video screens were broken into four panels, each
broadcasting off-center video feeds of the band
members as they played. Lead singer Yorke
came off as twisted and passionate, while the
Greenw(x)d brothers came off as cool and cere
bral. Two Tibetan Hags adorned the stage as a
part of the band's decades-long advocacy for
Tibetan independence.
Musically. Radiohead's set drew heavily from
their most recent LP, "In Rainbows," but also
dabbled in their earlier albums, particularly "OK
Computer." The band began their set with the

breakneck clicking intro of "15 Steps," as they
sauntered onstage to look out at the waiting Cans.
Soon they moved on to "Reckoner" and the sin
ister echo of "There, There." Their only selec
tion from "Hail to the Thief 1 was both haunting
and beautiful, particularly when paired with a
light show that resembled the claustrophobic for
est of their music video. The next song, "All I
Need" was a fragile highlight until it exploded
with fat piano chords and sparkling noise.
The band only grew better as the set went on.
Another outstanding new tune — they played
virtually the entirety of "In Rainbows" — was
"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi." Lyrically the song is a
tense tale of dying and finding bliss at the ocean
floor. Sonically the guitars were repetitive and
light, and visually the set was a stunning ocean
blue. Next was "Idioteque" and Yorke's best

moment of the night: dancing like an insane
raver during the song's final twitch-pop break
down. Later. Johnny Greenwood channeled
Jimmy Page hy used a violin bow on his electric
guitar to create the ghostly atmospherics that
underpin the simple piano chords of "Pyramid
Song." "Karma Police." meanwhile, was a bit
disappointing, but still enjoyable. Instead of a
textured, bass-heavy sound like in the recording,
the acoustic guitar and organ were flimsy sound
ing. Even so. the band built up momentum and
delivered a memorable final minute to the song.
Throughout all the set. Radiohead had three
secret weapons working for it. First, there was
Yorke's voice. Chords and beats would swirl
chaotically underneath while Yorke's voice
remained flawlessly in key. Also, Johnny
Greenwood added his signature electronic
soundscapes. As his bandmates worked away at
traditional instruments, Greendwood used com
puters, ondes martenots and synthesizers to add
ambient noises and programmed beats. Finally,
to my surprise, Radiohead relied heavily on its
drummer. Phil Selway played with a clean profi
ciency that created an exactness of timing that
the wildness of their melodies lacked.
The only real problem with Radiohead's set
was technical. Midway through "Airbag," the
unthinkable happened: Radiohead went totally
silent. The band kept playing but nothing was
amplified. Thousands of enraptured fans began
to murmur in confusion. ("Was this intention
al?" we all asked) But as the seconds of painful
silence slipped by, the confusion turned to anger.
Finally — after what must have seemed like a
lifetime to the festival promoters, but was in fact
only a half-minute — the sound returned. Yorke
would later quip, "Somebody spilled beer on the
plug!" But the joke wasn't quite over. The music
went out again during "All I Need." According
to Rolling Stone Magazine, Radiohead's
advanced gear was just too much for the PA sys
tem. Fortunately, the music returned again after
another half-minute. But if it hadn't —and if
Radiohead had not handled it like such profes
sionals—it could have tarnished an otherwise
outstanding set.
The first ever Outside Lands Festival was a
definite success — and there was nothing better
to start it off than Radiohead's wildly original
and entertaining live act, glitches or no glitches. -

BECK
Beck's most recent album, "Modern Guilt"
loomed large in his somewhat disappointing set
on Friday. Sequestered to a side stage just an
hour before Radiohead took the main stage,
Beck tried his best to tame the overcrowded and
unruly audience but to little avail. After launch
ing into "E-Pro" and then "Sun Eyed Girl," he
veered toward tracks like "Gamma Ray" and
"Chemtrails." — PC
BLACK MOUNTAIN

day festival. Though the amps cut out twice during the band's performance, the muscians han
dled the crisis gracefully, and fans weren't disappointed by the show in the least.
beat. Then space-age synths created some mood
and the band found a groove. Sonically, this was
a highlight for (he band, which finds itself lodged
somewhere between The Secret Machines and
Black Sabbath. Black Mountain's riffs were
talkative and trippy, while the female back
ground singer had a serious, stoic gaze. The larg
er result was a mid-tempo, stoner-friendly crawl
sound that won over Friday night's restless
crowd. —PC
LUPE FIASCO
One of the only hip-hop acts at the festival —
and certainly its best-known — Lupe Fiasco and
Bishop G put on a high-energy show, appealing
to a crowd that gave little back. Dressed in all
black with a gold medallion necklace. Lupe
dominated the stage, giving a much more lea
lured performance than when he opened for
Kanye West on the Glow in the Dark Tour.
Though Lupe gave stellar performances of fan
favorites like "Hip-Hop Saved My Life" and
"Go Go Gadget Flow," the crowd warmed up
when he finally unloaded the song they all came
for, "Superstar." Though Lupe was out of his
element with the crowd, he was in his element
on stage. — KM
REGINA SPEKTOR
Regina Spektor charmed fans with a simple,
clean performance of mostly songs from her
third album, Soviet Kitsch. Alone on the stage in
a green tent dress and popping red lipstick.
Spektor managed to make a large, festival-style
venue seem extremely intimate. A large, dedi
cated following mouthed the words to her signa
ture quirky lyrics, and shouted out many "I love
you Regina"s, to which she whispered throatily
into the microphone "1 love you. too." — KM
RODERIGO AND GABRIELA
While many of the bands at the Outside
Lands Festival are easily classified as "world
music," Roderigo and Gabriela truly live up to
this broad label. Born in Mexico City and cur
rently living in Dublin, the duo plays percussive,
quick-lingered acoustic jams. They even impres
sively managed to cover "Stairway to Heaven"

and a hit of "Seven Nation Army" by slapping
out beats and picking forcefully at their strings.

ANDREW BIRD
Dressed in a very dapper tie/blazer/jeans
combination. Andrew Bird came off like a mad
scientist tinkering in his musical laboratory on
Sunday afternoon. The New York Times blog
ger and former lead singer of Squirrel Nut
Zippers played small bits off several instru
ments, looped them and gradually layered the
parts to create an eccentric, shape-shifting
sound. Songs like "Fiery Crash" and
"Plasticities" were much more muscular live
than on Bird's latest record, "Armchair
Apocrypha." While the studio versions are dri
ven by delicate silences and clear over-dubbing,
Bird's Outside Lands approach was much more
aggressive. — PC
BROKEN SOCIAL SCENE
To end Broken Social Scene's fun, rollicking
set. bandleader Kevin Drew asked the audience
to let out a collective, cathartic scream. "For
every love you've ever lost, for every love you've
ever had, for everything you've ever wanted to
do, for all the fear pressed down 0n... scream!"
The resulting roar was an exciting ending to an
excellent set. Broken Social Scene's strength is
its socially extroverted attitude, an ability to
bring people — including their own disparate
roster — together with music. For the Outside
Lands Festival, the supergroup's rotating lineup
was at more than eight.
On a sunny Sunday afternoon, the band trot
ted out their unique blend of horns, melody and
shoe-gaze guitars. Broken Social Scene truly
constructs a wall of sound, layering instrument
after instrument — three or four guitars, a syn
thesizer, drums, bass and three horns — to cre
ate a single, enormous melody. The band, con
strained to a 50-minute set, played just the high
lights of their three studio albums. "7/4
(Shoreline)" was propelled by dueling female
vocals and a tricky 7/4 drumbeat. The crescendo
"Anthems for a 17-Year-Old Girl" (dedicated

FREE FALUN': Veteran musician Tom Petty took the Outside Lands main stage as the headlin
er for Saturday. He opened his show by cheerfully annoucing to the audience that he would try
to cram in as much music as possible before the festival's 10 p.m. curfew. His "greatest hits" set
list included "Free Fallin'/' "Mary Jane's Last Dance," "Breakdown," "Learning to Fly" and
"Refugee." Sporting the usual haircut and singing the same songs, Petty gave audiences exactly
the show they came to see. He ended the night with an enthusiastic "American Girl," which
echoed, to the annoyance of surrounding neighbors, for miles across the city.
"to all the ladies") was a sentimental
fan favorite. The set's highlights, how
ever, were two new songs off band
member Brendan Canning's recent
collaboration, entitled "Something for
All of Us." "Churches Under the
Stairs" was a spacey ode to New Wave
with a beautiful, restrained hook.
Meanwhile, "Love Is New" — played
by the band live for the first time —
was a disco-inflected dance groove
with a wicked saxophone solo.
In the end, you could tell that
Broken Social Scene was just happy to
be playing music together — and the
crowd was just happy to be listening.
—PC

STEEL PULSE
This band, which originally formed
in England in 1975, played classic —
"roots" — reggae early Friday
evening. After almost 12 albums of
channeling Jamaica, the band is good
at what they do: The guitars were
buoyant, the band dynamic was loose
and the mood was laid-back. "Not
King James Version" evoked a partic
ularly positive reaction from the
crowd.
— PC
ROGUE WAVE
Rogue Wave's musical palette is
not unlike its "Descend Like
Vultures" album cover: It consists of
light grays, marine blues, beiges and a
flourish of fiery red. The Sub Pop
band's indie pop is, at its best, deeply
personal and musically creative but, at
its worst, bland. On Sunday after
noon, the band openly fought this ten
dency with great songs like "Love's
Lost Guarantee" and "Bird on A
Wire." Zach Rogue's voice is nasal,
indeed, a nasally, perfectly pitched
treat that carried a score of otherwise
plodding tunes.
— PC
WILCO
Kevin Drew introduced Wilco as
"America's best rock band." While

they didn't necessarily live up to this
high-praise, they may have been the
best American band at Outside Lands.
As always, Wilco proved that noise
rock, country and classic rock can mix
perfectly. Playing on Sunday evening,
Jeff Tweedy and company ripped
through their recent catalogue.
"Spiders (Kidsmoke)" was a repetitive
crowd-pleaser, while "I Am Trying to
Break Your Heart" was balanced with
a perfect level of noise, and the new
"Hate It Here" was fun roots-rock.
- PC
VIENNA TENG
Lesser-known act and Stanford
alum Vienna Teng '(X) drew a healthy
crowd to her Sunday-afternoon per
formance. Introducing songs
"Antebellum" and "Grandmother's
Song" off her upcoming album, Teng
delivered the same soulful, richly
toned melodies her fans have listened
to since her debut of "Waking Hour"
in 2002. The singer-songwriter gave
many thanks to the audience, even
joking that she would have left her
own performance to head over to see
Andrew Bird.
— KM
JACKJOHNSON
Those who could stand to watch a
(gasp) mainstream act headed over to
Jack Johnson after Wilco on Sunday
night to see the last performer of the

weekend. Johnson took the stage
under blue skies as the sun began to
set beyond the edge of the park.
While the artist could have plugged
his latest album, "Sleep Through the

Static," Johnson kept the crowd inter
ested by playing old favorites like
"Taylor," "Bubble Toes" and
"Banana Pancakes."
Johnson kept the audience on their
toes, bringing up many guest perform
ers including Hawaiian singer Paula
Fuga, Clover City Dove Collective,
members of Animal Liberation
Orchestra and Zach Rogue of Rogue
Wave. Bassist Merlo Podlewski
rapped during "Staple it Together,"
and pianist Zach Gill rocked out on
his own featured song "Family." The
variety of musicians onstage propelled
the show forward, making Johnson's
loved, but sometimes underwhelming
performance, multi-dimensional.
Despite the large, mainstage
crowd, Johnson maintained his
Hawaiian surfer dude-like calm,
except when a small green spider
landed on his microphone. The band
continued to jam as Johnson nearly
dropped his guitar trying to blow the
spider away, and then switched out for
a freshly tuned instrument.
By far the most family-friendly
headliner of the weekend, Johnson
drew a less rowdy, more eclectic
group of listeners. Older children sat
on their parents' shoulders and moth
ers swayed babies asleep to Johnson's
lullaby-like singing and quiet guitar.
He ended his encore with a solo per
formance of "Better Together,"
putting a slightly mushy, but nonethe
less satisfying end to the weekend.

HELL YES: Beck performed to a
packed crowd on the Sutra stage of
the festival. Though eager fans near
the front stayed through the end of
Beck's show, others headed out
early to secure seats for Radiohead.
The highly anticipated San Francisco summer
music festival Outside Lands was a mixed suc
cess and was very much a production of its host

Kevin Drew introduced Wilco as
"America's best rock band." While

they didn't necessarily live up to this
high-praise, they may have been the
best American band at Outside Lands.
As always, Wilco proved that noise
rock, country and classic rock can mix
perfectly. Playing on Sunday evening,
Jeff Tweedy and company ripped
through their recent catalogue.
"Spiders (Kidsmoke)" was a repetitive
crowd-pleaser, while "I Am Trying to
Break Your Heart" was balanced with
a perfect level of noise, and the new
"Hate It Here" was fun roots-rock.

VIENNA TENG
Lesser-known act and Stanford
alum Vienna Teng '(X) drew a healthy
crowd to her Sunday-afternoon per
formance. Introducing songs
"Antebellum" and "Grandmother's
Song" off her upcoming album, Teng
delivered the same soulful, richly
toned melodies her fans have listened
to since her debut of "Waking Hour"
in 2002. The singer-songwriter gave
many thanks to the audience, even
joking that she would have left her
own performance to head over to see
Andrew Bird.

JACKJOHNSON
Those who could stand to watch a
(gasp) mainstream act headed over to
Jack Johnson after Wilco on Sunday
night to see the last performer of the

weekend. Johnson took the stage
under blue skies as the sun began to
set beyond the edge of the park.
While the artist could have plugged
his latest album, "Sleep Through the

Static," Johnson kept the crowd inter
ested by playing old favorites like
"Taylor," "Bubble Toes" and
"Banana Pancakes."
Johnson kept the audience on their
toes, bringing up many guest perform
ers including Hawaiian singer Paula
Fuga, Clover City Dove Collective,
members of Animal Liberation
Orchestra and Zach Rogue of Rogue
Wave. Bassist Merlo Podlewski
rapped during "Staple it Together,"
and pianist Zach Gill rocked out on
his own featured song "Family." The
variety of musicians onstage propelled
the show forward, making Johnson's
loved, but sometimes underwhelming
performance, multi-dimensional.
Despite the large, mainstage
crowd, Johnson maintained his
Hawaiian surfer dude-like calm,
except when a small green spider
landed on his microphone. The band
continued to jam as Johnson nearly
dropped his guitar trying to blow the
spider away, and then switched out for
a freshly tuned instrument.
By far the most family-friendly
headliner of the weekend, Johnson
drew a less rowdy, more eclectic
group of listeners. Older children sat
on their parents' shoulders and moth
ers swayed babies asleep to Johnson's
lullaby-like singing and quiet guitar.
He ended his encore with a solo per
formance of "Better Together,"
putting a slightly mushy, but nonethe
less satisfying end to the weekend.

HELL YES: Beck performed to a
packed crowd on the Sutra stage of
the festival. Though eager fans near
the front stayed through the end of
Beck's show, others headed out
early to secure seats for Radiohead.
The highly anticipated San Francisco summer
music festival Outside Lands was a mixed suc
cess and was very much a production of its host
city. With eco-friendly info booths; vendors serv
ing up raw vegan burgers and flatbread cheese
less pizza; recycling and compost bins; hippies
and hipsters (there were more hipsters in line for
food than at all of Stanford), people passing
joints and plenty of fog, the Golden Gate Park
event was precisely what it should have been —
despite a few bumps in operation.
The bumps mostly came early on. Before
Radiohead took the stage on Friday night, festi
val-goers — who, according to the San Francisco
Chronicle, numbered more than 15().(XX) over
the three-day weekend — had already trampled
barrier gates. The attendees without tickets
(which cost SO bucks a pop) were jumping fences
behind Port-a-Potties and dissolving into the
massive crowds.
"This is a zoo," exclaimed one woman as she
surveyed the mass collective listening to Beck at
the Sutra stage. Though many attendees agreed
Friday was slightly more hectic than projected,
by Saturday afternoon, Outside Lands had sim
mered down to a manageable festival atmos
phere. Crowds trickled to the grounds and
meandered between the six stages, stopping at
clothing and food booths run by local businesses,
many with a "green" focus. Besides slight orga
nizational missteps, the major problems of the
untried festival were technical. Twice during
Radiohead's performance and several times
more during Tom Petty's act on Saturday, the
amps cut out completely.
By Sunday, the California sunshine broke
through the mist, warming healthy audiences
who watched bands like Stars, Broken Social
Scene and Wilco before setting romantically as
headliner Jack Johnson took the stage. Though
concert promoters touted Radiohead as the first
band to ever play in Golden Gate Park at night,
Johnson had the pleasure of being the first to
play under clear skies, a welcome, laid-back end
to a very tiring, but well spent, weekend. -Kelsey

RADIOHEAD
Radiohead, without a doubt, was the main
draw to Outside Lands on Friday night. During
Beck's pre-Radiohead set, throngs of concertgo
ers made for the exits — they wanted to get good
seats for the headlining act.
The early birds weren't disappointed: As
usual. Thorn Yorke and company met even the
loftiest of expectations. The quintet — seven
years and seven albums into their career —
brought a fiercely creative arid energetic show to
Outside Lands. Radiohead played the main
"Land's End" stage to what looked like the
largest crowd of the entire festival. The huge
grass clearing in front of the main stage was
packed with onlookers, all huddled together
between spidery park trees and under a foggy
night sky. An estimated SXXX) gatecrashers also
added to the fray.
Visually, Radiohead was the best experience
of the concert. The band adorned the cavernous
main stage with a series of hanging columns that
reflected LED colors and light, a large panel of
colored bulbs above and two large video screens
on either side of the stage. The band's generous

use of colors echoed the songs' musical moods: a
soft red for "All I Need," midnight blue for
"There, There" and angry scarlet for "Paranoid
Android." The clear columns also refracted
streams of white LED light, chopping up bits of
color to create sparkles. Meanwhile, the large
video screens were broken into four panels, each
broadcasting off-center video feeds of the band
members as they played. Lead singer Yorke
came off as twisted and passionate, while the
Greenw(x)d brothers came off as cool and cere
bral. Two Tibetan Hags adorned the stage as a
part of the band's decades-long advocacy for
Tibetan independence.
Musically. Radiohead's set drew heavily from
their most recent LP, "In Rainbows," but also
dabbled in their earlier albums, particularly "OK
Computer." The band began their set with the

breakneck clicking intro of "15 Steps," as they
sauntered onstage to look out at the waiting Cans.
Soon they moved on to "Reckoner" and the sin
ister echo of "There, There." Their only selec
tion from "Hail to the Thief 1 was both haunting
and beautiful, particularly when paired with a
light show that resembled the claustrophobic for
est of their music video. The next song, "All I
Need" was a fragile highlight until it exploded
with fat piano chords and sparkling noise.
The band only grew better as the set went on.
Another outstanding new tune — they played
virtually the entirety of "In Rainbows" — was
"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi." Lyrically the song is a
tense tale of dying and finding bliss at the ocean
floor. Sonically the guitars were repetitive and
light, and visually the set was a stunning ocean
blue. Next was "Idioteque" and Yorke's best

moment of the night: dancing like an insane
raver during the song's final twitch-pop break
down. Later. Johnny Greenwood channeled
Jimmy Page hy used a violin bow on his electric
guitar to create the ghostly atmospherics that
underpin the simple piano chords of "Pyramid
Song." "Karma Police." meanwhile, was a bit
disappointing, but still enjoyable. Instead of a
textured, bass-heavy sound like in the recording,
the acoustic guitar and organ were flimsy sound
ing. Even so. the band built up momentum and
delivered a memorable final minute to the song.
Throughout all the set. Radiohead had three
secret weapons working for it. First, there was
Yorke's voice. Chords and beats would swirl
chaotically underneath while Yorke's voice
remained flawlessly in key. Also, Johnny
Greenwood added his signature electronic
soundscapes. As his bandmates worked away at
traditional instruments, Greendwood used com
puters, ondes martenots and synthesizers to add
ambient noises and programmed beats. Finally,
to my surprise, Radiohead relied heavily on its
drummer. Phil Selway played with a clean profi
ciency that created an exactness of timing that
the wildness of their melodies lacked.
The only real problem with Radiohead's set
was technical. Midway through "Airbag," the
unthinkable happened: Radiohead went totally
silent. The band kept playing but nothing was
amplified. Thousands of enraptured fans began
to murmur in confusion. ("Was this intention
al?" we all asked) But as the seconds of painful
silence slipped by, the confusion turned to anger.
Finally — after what must have seemed like a
lifetime to the festival promoters, but was in fact
only a half-minute — the sound returned. Yorke
would later quip, "Somebody spilled beer on the
plug!" But the joke wasn't quite over. The music
went out again during "All I Need." According
to Rolling Stone Magazine, Radiohead's
advanced gear was just too much for the PA sys
tem. Fortunately, the music returned again after
another half-minute. But if it hadn't —and if
Radiohead had not handled it like such profes
sionals—it could have tarnished an otherwise
outstanding set.
The first ever Outside Lands Festival was a
definite success — and there was nothing better
to start it off than Radiohead's wildly original
and entertaining live act, glitches or no glitches. -

BROKEN SOCIAL SCENE
To end Broken Social Scene's fun, rollicking
set. bandleader Kevin Drew asked the audience
to let out a collective, cathartic scream. "For
every love you've ever lost, for every love you've
ever had, for everything you've ever wanted to
do, for all the fear pressed down 0n... scream!"
The resulting roar was an exciting ending to an
excellent set. Broken Social Scene's strength is
its socially extroverted attitude, an ability to
bring people — including their own disparate
roster — together with music. For the Outside
Lands Festival, the supergroup's rotating lineup
was at more than eight.
On a sunny Sunday afternoon, the band trot
ted out their unique blend of horns, melody and
shoe-gaze guitars. Broken Social Scene truly

FREE FALUN': Veteran musician Tom Petty took the Outside Lands main stage as the headlin
er for Saturday. He opened his show by cheerfully annoucing to the audience that he would try
to cram in as much music as possible before the festival's 10 p.m. curfew. His "greatest hits" set
list included "Free Fallin'/' "Mary Jane's Last Dance," "Breakdown," "Learning to Fly" and
"Refugee." Sporting the usual haircut and singing the same songs, Petty gave audiences exactly
the show they came to see. He ended the night with an enthusiastic "American Girl," which
echoed, to the annoyance of surrounding neighbors, for miles across the city.
"to all the ladies") was a sentimental
fan favorite. The set's highlights, how
ever, were two new songs off band
member Brendan Canning's recent
collaboration, entitled "Something for
All of Us." "Churches Under the
Stairs" was a spacey ode to New Wave
with a beautiful, restrained hook.
Meanwhile, "Love Is New" — played
by the band live for the first time —
was a disco-inflected dance groove
with a wicked saxophone solo.
In the end, you could tell that
Broken Social Scene was just happy to
be playing music together — and the
crowd was just happy to be listening.

STEEL PULSE
This band, which originally formed
in England in 1975, played classic —
"roots" — reggae early Friday
evening. After almost 12 albums of
channeling Jamaica, the band is good
at what they do: The guitars were
buoyant, the band dynamic was loose
and the mood was laid-back. "Not
King James Version" evoked a partic

crowd.

ROGUE WAVE
Rogue Wave's musical palette is
not unlike its "Descend Like
Vultures" album cover: It consists of
light grays, marine blues, beiges and a
flourish of fiery red. The Sub Pop
band's indie pop is, at its best, deeply
personal and musically creative but, at
its worst, bland. On Sunday after
noon, the band openly fought this ten
dency with great songs like "Love's
Lost Guarantee" and "Bird on A
Wire." Zach Rogue's voice is nasal,
indeed, a nasally, perfectly pitched
treat that carried a score of otherwise
plodding tunes.

FREE FALUN': Veteran musician Tom Petty took the Outside Lands main stage as the headlin
er for Saturday. He opened his show by cheerfully annoucing to the audience that he would try
to cram in as much music as possible before the festival's 10 p.m. curfew. His "greatest hits" set
list included "Free Fallin'/' "Mary Jane's Last Dance," "Breakdown," "Learning to Fly" and
"Refugee." Sporting the usual haircut and singing the same songs, Petty gave audiences exactly
the show they came to see. He ended the night with an enthusiastic "American Girl," which
echoed, to the annoyance of surrounding neighbors, for miles across the city.
"to all the ladies") was a sentimental
fan favorite. The set's highlights, how
ever, were two new songs off band
member Brendan Canning's recent
collaboration, entitled "Something for
All of Us." "Churches Under the
Stairs" was a spacey ode to New Wave
with a beautiful, restrained hook.
Meanwhile, "Love Is New" — played
by the band live for the first time —
was a disco-inflected dance groove
with a wicked saxophone solo.
In the end, you could tell that
Broken Social Scene was just happy to
be playing music together — and the
crowd was just happy to be listening.

STEEL PULSE
This band, which originally formed
in England in 1975, played classic —
"roots" — reggae early Friday
evening. After almost 12 albums of
channeling Jamaica, the band is good
at what they do: The guitars were

and the mood was laid-back. "Not
King James Version" evoked a partic

ROGUE WAVE
Rogue Wave's musical palette is
not unlike its "Descend Like
Vultures" album cover: It consists of
light grays, marine blues, beiges and a
flourish of fiery red. The Sub Pop
band's indie pop is, at its best, deeply
personal and musically creative but, at
its worst, bland. On Sunday after
noon, the band openly fought this ten
dency with great songs like "Love's
Lost Guarantee" and "Bird on A
Wire." Zach Rogue's voice is nasal,
indeed, a nasally, perfectly pitched
treat that carried a score of otherwise
plodding tunes.

WILCO
Kevin Drew introduced Wilco as
"America's best rock band." While

they didn't necessarily live up to this

best American band at Outside Lands.
As always, Wilco proved that noise
rock, country and classic rock can mix
perfectly. Playing on Sunday evening,
Jeff Tweedy and company ripped
through their recent catalogue.
"Spiders (Kidsmoke)" was a repetitive
crowd-pleaser, while "I Am Trying to
Break Your Heart" was balanced with
a perfect level of noise, and the new
"Hate It Here" was fun roots-rock.

VIENNA TENG
Lesser-known act and Stanford

toned melodies her fans have listened
to since her debut of "Waking Hour"
in 2002. The singer-songwriter gave
many thanks to the audience, even
joking that she would have left her
own performance to head over to see
Andrew Bird.

JACKJOHNSON
Those who could stand to watch a
(gasp) mainstream act headed over to
Jack Johnson after Wilco on Sunday
night to see the last performer of the

weekend. Johnson took the stage
under blue skies as the sun began to
set beyond the edge of the park.
While the artist could have plugged
his latest album, "Sleep Through the

Static," Johnson kept the crowd inter
ested by playing old favorites like
"Taylor," "Bubble Toes" and
"Banana Pancakes."
Johnson kept the audience on their
toes, bringing up many guest perform
ers including Hawaiian singer Paula
Fuga, Clover City Dove Collective,
members of Animal Liberation
Orchestra and Zach Rogue of Rogue
Wave. Bassist Merlo Podlewski
rapped during "Staple it Together,"
and pianist Zach Gill rocked out on
his own featured song "Family." The
variety of musicians onstage propelled
the show forward, making Johnson's
loved, but sometimes underwhelming
performance, multi-dimensional.
Despite the large, mainstage
crowd, Johnson maintained his
Hawaiian surfer dude-like calm,
except when a small green spider
landed on his microphone. The band
continued to jam as Johnson nearly
dropped his guitar trying to blow the
spider away, and then switched out for
a freshly tuned instrument.
By far the most family-friendly
headliner of the weekend, Johnson
drew a less rowdy, more eclectic
group of listeners. Older children sat
on their parents' shoulders and moth
ers swayed babies asleep to Johnson's
lullaby-like singing and quiet guitar.
He ended his encore with a solo per
formance of "Better Together,"
putting a slightly mushy, but nonethe
less satisfying end to the weekend.

HELL YES: Beck performed to a
packed crowd on the Sutra stage of
the festival. Though eager fans near
the front stayed through the end of
Beck's show, others headed out
early to secure seats for Radiohead.
The highly anticipated San Francisco summer
music festival Outside Lands was a mixed suc
cess and was very much a production of its host
city. With eco-friendly info booths; vendors serv
ing up raw vegan burgers and flatbread cheese
less pizza; recycling and compost bins; hippies
and hipsters (there were more hipsters in line for
food than at all of Stanford), people passing
joints and plenty of fog, the Golden Gate Park
event was precisely what it should have been —
despite a few bumps in operation.
The bumps mostly came early on. Before
Radiohead took the stage on Friday night, festi
val-goers — who, according to the San Francisco
Chronicle, numbered more than 15().(XX) over
the three-day weekend — had already trampled
barrier gates. The attendees without tickets
(which cost SO bucks a pop) were jumping fences
behind Port-a-Potties and dissolving into the
massive crowds.
"This is a zoo," exclaimed one woman as she
surveyed the mass collective listening to Beck at
the Sutra stage. Though many attendees agreed
Friday was slightly more hectic than projected,
by Saturday afternoon, Outside Lands had sim
mered down to a manageable festival atmos
phere. Crowds trickled to the grounds and
meandered between the six stages, stopping at
clothing and food booths run by local businesses,
many with a "green" focus. Besides slight orga
nizational missteps, the major problems of the
untried festival were technical. Twice during
Radiohead's performance and several times
more during Tom Petty's act on Saturday, the
amps cut out completely.
By Sunday, the California sunshine broke
through the mist, warming healthy audiences
who watched bands like Stars, Broken Social
Scene and Wilco before setting romantically as
headliner Jack Johnson took the stage. Though
concert promoters touted Radiohead as the first
band to ever play in Golden Gate Park at night,
Johnson had the pleasure of being the first to
play under clear skies, a welcome, laid-back end

RADIOHEAD
Radiohead, without a doubt, was the main
draw to Outside Lands on Friday night. During
Beck's pre-Radiohead set, throngs of concertgo
ers made for the exits — they wanted to get good
seats for the headlining act.
The early birds weren't disappointed: As
usual. Thorn Yorke and company met even the
loftiest of expectations. The quintet — seven
years and seven albums into their career —
brought a fiercely creative arid energetic show to
Outside Lands. Radiohead played the main
"Land's End" stage to what looked like the
largest crowd of the entire festival. The huge
grass clearing in front of the main stage was
packed with onlookers, all huddled together
between spidery park trees and under a foggy
night sky. An estimated SXXX) gatecrashers also
added to the fray.
Visually, Radiohead was the best experience
of the concert. The band adorned the cavernous
main stage with a series of hanging columns that
reflected LED colors and light, a large panel of
colored bulbs above and two large video screens
on either side of the stage. The band's generous

use of colors echoed the songs' musical moods: a
soft red for "All I Need," midnight blue for
"There, There" and angry scarlet for "Paranoid
Android." The clear columns also refracted
streams of white LED light, chopping up bits of
color to create sparkles. Meanwhile, the large
video screens were broken into four panels, each
broadcasting off-center video feeds of the band
members as they played. Lead singer Yorke
came off as twisted and passionate, while the
Greenw(x)d brothers came off as cool and cere
bral. Two Tibetan Hags adorned the stage as a
part of the band's decades-long advocacy for
Tibetan independence.
Musically. Radiohead's set drew heavily from
their most recent LP, "In Rainbows," but also
dabbled in their earlier albums, particularly "OK
Computer." The band began their set with the

breakneck clicking intro of "15 Steps," as they
sauntered onstage to look out at the waiting Cans.
Soon they moved on to "Reckoner" and the sin
ister echo of "There, There." Their only selec
tion from "Hail to the Thief 1 was both haunting
and beautiful, particularly when paired with a
light show that resembled the claustrophobic for
est of their music video. The next song, "All I
Need" was a fragile highlight until it exploded
with fat piano chords and sparkling noise.
The band only grew better as the set went on.
Another outstanding new tune — they played
virtually the entirety of "In Rainbows" — was
"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi." Lyrically the song is a
tense tale of dying and finding bliss at the ocean
floor. Sonically the guitars were repetitive and
light, and visually the set was a stunning ocean
blue. Next was "Idioteque" and Yorke's best

moment of the night: dancing like an insane
raver during the song's final twitch-pop break
down. Later. Johnny Greenwood channeled
Jimmy Page hy used a violin bow on his electric
guitar to create the ghostly atmospherics that
underpin the simple piano chords of "Pyramid
Song." "Karma Police." meanwhile, was a bit
disappointing, but still enjoyable. Instead of a
textured, bass-heavy sound like in the recording,
the acoustic guitar and organ were flimsy sound
ing. Even so. the band built up momentum and
delivered a memorable final minute to the song.
Throughout all the set. Radiohead had three
secret weapons working for it. First, there was
Yorke's voice. Chords and beats would swirl
chaotically underneath while Yorke's voice
remained flawlessly in key. Also, Johnny
Greenwood added his signature electronic
soundscapes. As his bandmates worked away at
traditional instruments, Greendwood used com
puters, ondes martenots and synthesizers to add
ambient noises and programmed beats. Finally,
to my surprise, Radiohead relied heavily on its
drummer. Phil Selway played with a clean profi
ciency that created an exactness of timing that
the wildness of their melodies lacked.
The only real problem with Radiohead's set
was technical. Midway through "Airbag," the
unthinkable happened: Radiohead went totally
silent. The band kept playing but nothing was
amplified. Thousands of enraptured fans began
to murmur in confusion. ("Was this intention
al?" we all asked) But as the seconds of painful
silence slipped by, the confusion turned to anger.
Finally — after what must have seemed like a
lifetime to the festival promoters, but was in fact
only a half-minute — the sound returned. Yorke
would later quip, "Somebody spilled beer on the
plug!" But the joke wasn't quite over. The music
went out again during "All I Need." According
to Rolling Stone Magazine, Radiohead's
advanced gear was just too much for the PA sys
tem. Fortunately, the music returned again after
another half-minute. But if it hadn't —and if
Radiohead had not handled it like such profes
sionals—it could have tarnished an otherwise
outstanding set.
The first ever Outside Lands Festival was a
definite success — and there was nothing better
to start it off than Radiohead's wildly original
and entertaining live act, glitches or no glitches. -

dominated the stage, giving a much more lea

Kanye West on the Glow in the Dark Tour.
Though Lupe gave stellar performances of fan
favorites like "Hip-Hop Saved My Life" and

for, "Superstar." Though Lupe was out of his

Regina Spektor charmed fans with a simple,

RODERIGO AND GABRIELA
While many of the bands at the Outside
Lands Festival are easily classified as "world

quick-lingered acoustic jams. They even impres

parts to create an eccentric, shape-shifting
sound. Songs like "Fiery Crash" and
"Plasticities" were much more muscular live

do, for all the fear pressed down 0n... scream!"
The resulting roar was an exciting ending to an

One of the only hip-hop acts at the festival —
and certainly its best-known — Lupe Fiasco and
Bishop G put on a high-energy show, appealing
to a crowd that gave little back. Dressed in all
black with a gold medallion necklace. Lupe
dominated the stage, giving a much more lea
lured performance than when he opened for
Kanye West on the Glow in the Dark Tour.
Though Lupe gave stellar performances of fan
favorites like "Hip-Hop Saved My Life" and
"Go Go Gadget Flow," the crowd warmed up
when he finally unloaded the song they all came
for, "Superstar." Though Lupe was out of his
element with the crowd, he was in his element
on stage. — KM
REGINA SPEKTOR
Regina Spektor charmed fans with a simple,
clean performance of mostly songs from her
third album, Soviet Kitsch. Alone on the stage in
a green tent dress and popping red lipstick.
Spektor managed to make a large, festival-style
venue seem extremely intimate. A large, dedi
cated following mouthed the words to her signa
ture quirky lyrics, and shouted out many "I love
you Regina"s, to which she whispered throatily
into the microphone "1 love you. too." — KM
RODERIGO AND GABRIELA
While many of the bands at the Outside
Lands Festival are easily classified as "world
music," Roderigo and Gabriela truly live up to
this broad label. Born in Mexico City and cur
rently living in Dublin, the duo plays percussive,
quick-lingered acoustic jams. They even impres
sively managed to cover "Stairway to Heaven"

and a hit of "Seven Nation Army" by slapping
out beats and picking forcefully at their strings.

ANDREW BIRD
Dressed in a very dapper tie/blazer/jeans
combination. Andrew Bird came off like a mad
scientist tinkering in his musical laboratory on
Sunday afternoon. The New York Times blog
ger and former lead singer of Squirrel Nut
Zippers played small bits off several instru
ments, looped them and gradually layered the
parts to create an eccentric, shape-shifting
sound. Songs like "Fiery Crash" and
"Plasticities" were much more muscular live
than on Bird's latest record, "Armchair
Apocrypha." While the studio versions are dri
ven by delicate silences and clear over-dubbing,
Bird's Outside Lands approach was much more
aggressive. — PC
BROKEN SOCIAL SCENE
To end Broken Social Scene's fun, rollicking
set. bandleader Kevin Drew asked the audience
to let out a collective, cathartic scream. "For
every love you've ever lost, for every love you've
ever had, for everything you've ever wanted to
do, for all the fear pressed down 0n... scream!"
The resulting roar was an exciting ending to an
excellent set. Broken Social Scene's strength is
its socially extroverted attitude, an ability to
bring people — including their own disparate
roster — together with music. For the Outside
Lands Festival, the supergroup's rotating lineup
was at more than eight.
On a sunny Sunday afternoon, the band trot
ted out their unique blend of horns, melody and
shoe-gaze guitars. Broken Social Scene truly
constructs a wall of sound, layering instrument
after instrument — three or four guitars, a syn
thesizer, drums, bass and three horns — to cre
ate a single, enormous melody. The band, con
strained to a 50-minute set, played just the high
lights of their three studio albums. "7/4

vocals and a tricky 7/4 drumbeat. The crescendo

FREE FALUN': Veteran musician Tom Petty took the Outside Lands main stage as the headlin
er for Saturday. He opened his show by cheerfully annoucing to the audience that he would try
to cram in as much music as possible before the festival's 10 p.m. curfew. His "greatest hits" set
list included "Free Fallin'/' "Mary Jane's Last Dance," "Breakdown," "Learning to Fly" and
"Refugee." Sporting the usual haircut and singing the same songs, Petty gave audiences exactly
the show they came to see. He ended the night with an enthusiastic "American Girl," which
echoed, to the annoyance of surrounding neighbors, for miles across the city.
"to all the ladies") was a sentimental
fan favorite. The set's highlights, how
ever, were two new songs off band
member Brendan Canning's recent
collaboration, entitled "Something for
All of Us." "Churches Under the
Stairs" was a spacey ode to New Wave
with a beautiful, restrained hook.
Meanwhile, "Love Is New" — played
by the band live for the first time —
was a disco-inflected dance groove
with a wicked saxophone solo.
In the end, you could tell that
Broken Social Scene was just happy to
be playing music together — and the
crowd was just happy to be listening.

STEEL PULSE
This band, which originally formed
in England in 1975, played classic —
"roots" — reggae early Friday
evening. After almost 12 albums of
channeling Jamaica, the band is good
at what they do: The guitars were
buoyant, the band dynamic was loose
and the mood was laid-back. "Not
King James Version" evoked a partic
ularly positive reaction from the
crowd.

ROGUE WAVE
Rogue Wave's musical palette is
not unlike its "Descend Like
Vultures" album cover: It consists of
light grays, marine blues, beiges and a
flourish of fiery red. The Sub Pop
band's indie pop is, at its best, deeply
personal and musically creative but, at
its worst, bland. On Sunday after
noon, the band openly fought this ten
dency with great songs like "Love's
Lost Guarantee" and "Bird on A
Wire." Zach Rogue's voice is nasal,
indeed, a nasally, perfectly pitched
treat that carried a score of otherwise
plodding tunes.

WILCO
Kevin Drew introduced Wilco as
"America's best rock band." While

they didn't necessarily live up to this
high-praise, they may have been the
best American band at Outside Lands.
As always, Wilco proved that noise
rock, country and classic rock can mix
perfectly. Playing on Sunday evening,
Jeff Tweedy and company ripped
through their recent catalogue.
"Spiders (Kidsmoke)" was a repetitive
crowd-pleaser, while "I Am Trying to
Break Your Heart" was balanced with
a perfect level of noise, and the new
"Hate It Here" was fun roots-rock.

VIENNA TENG
Lesser-known act and Stanford
alum Vienna Teng '(X) drew a healthy
crowd to her Sunday-afternoon per
formance. Introducing songs
"Antebellum" and "Grandmother's
Song" off her upcoming album, Teng
delivered the same soulful, richly
toned melodies her fans have listened
to since her debut of "Waking Hour"
in 2002. The singer-songwriter gave
many thanks to the audience, even
joking that she would have left her
own performance to head over to see
Andrew Bird.

JACKJOHNSON
Those who could stand to watch a
(gasp) mainstream act headed over to
Jack Johnson after Wilco on Sunday
night to see the last performer of the

weekend. Johnson took the stage
under blue skies as the sun began to
set beyond the edge of the park.
While the artist could have plugged
his latest album, "Sleep Through the

Static," Johnson kept the crowd inter
ested by playing old favorites like
"Taylor," "Bubble Toes" and
"Banana Pancakes."
Johnson kept the audience on their
toes, bringing up many guest perform
ers including Hawaiian singer Paula
Fuga, Clover City Dove Collective,
members of Animal Liberation
Orchestra and Zach Rogue of Rogue
Wave. Bassist Merlo Podlewski
rapped during "Staple it Together,"
and pianist Zach Gill rocked out on
his own featured song "Family." The
variety of musicians onstage propelled
the show forward, making Johnson's
loved, but sometimes underwhelming
performance, multi-dimensional.
Despite the large, mainstage
crowd, Johnson maintained his
Hawaiian surfer dude-like calm,
except when a small green spider
landed on his microphone. The band
continued to jam as Johnson nearly
dropped his guitar trying to blow the
spider away, and then switched out for
a freshly tuned instrument.
By far the most family-friendly
headliner of the weekend, Johnson
drew a less rowdy, more eclectic
group of listeners. Older children sat
on their parents' shoulders and moth
ers swayed babies asleep to Johnson's
lullaby-like singing and quiet guitar.
He ended his encore with a solo per
formance of "Better Together,"
putting a slightly mushy, but nonethe
less satisfying end to the weekend.

HELL YES: Beck performed to a
packed crowd on the Sutra stage of
the festival. Though eager fans near
the front stayed through the end of
Beck's show, others headed out
early to secure seats for Radiohead.
