## BEYOND THE BUBBLE A WEEKEND OF CHAOS, GREAT MUSIC Radiohead delivers memorable opening night to San Francisco's Outside Lands festival in Golden Gate Park
### 
The highly anticipated San Francisco summer
music festival Outside Lands was a mixed suc
cess and was very much a production of its host
city. With eco-friendly info booths; vendors serv
ing up raw vegan burgers and flatbread cheese
less pizza; recycling and compost bins; hippies
and hipsters (there were more hipsters in line for
food than at all of Stanford), people passing
joints and plenty of fog, the Golden Gate Park
event was precisely what it should have been —
despite a few bumps in operation.
The bumps mostly came early on. Before
Radiohead took the stage on Friday night, festi
val-goers — who, according to the San Francisco
Chronicle, numbered more than 15().(XX) over
the three-day weekend — had already trampled
barrier gates. The attendees without tickets
(which cost SO bucks a pop) were jumping fences
behind Port-a-Potties and dissolving into the
massive crowds.
"This is a zoo," exclaimed one woman as she
surveyed the mass collective listening to Beck at
the Sutra stage. Though many attendees agreed
Friday was slightly more hectic than projected,
by Saturday afternoon, Outside Lands had sim
mered down to a manageable festival atmos
phere. Crowds trickled to the grounds and
meandered between the six stages, stopping at
clothing and food booths run by local businesses,
many with a "green" focus. Besides slight orga
nizational missteps, the major problems of the
untried festival were technical. Twice during
Radiohead's performance and several times
more during Tom Petty's act on Saturday, the
amps cut out completely.
By Sunday, the California sunshine broke
through the mist, warming healthy audiences
who watched bands like Stars, Broken Social
Scene and Wilco before setting romantically as
headliner Jack Johnson took the stage. Though
concert promoters touted Radiohead as the first
band to ever play in Golden Gate Park at night,
Johnson had the pleasure of being the first to
play under clear skies, a welcome, laid-back end
to a very tiring, but well spent, weekend. -Kelsey

RADIOHEAD
Radiohead, without a doubt, was the main
draw to Outside Lands on Friday night. During
Beck's pre-Radiohead set, throngs of concertgo
ers made for the exits — they wanted to get good
seats for the headlining act.
The early birds weren't disappointed: As
usual. Thorn Yorke and company met even the
loftiest of expectations. The quintet — seven
years and seven albums into their career —
brought a fiercely creative arid energetic show to
Outside Lands. Radiohead played the main
"Land's End" stage to what looked like the
largest crowd of the entire festival. The huge
grass clearing in front of the main stage was
packed with onlookers, all huddled together
between spidery park trees and under a foggy
night sky. An estimated SXXX) gatecrashers also
added to the fray.
Visually, Radiohead was the best experience
of the concert. The band adorned the cavernous
main stage with a series of hanging columns that
reflected LED colors and light, a large panel of
colored bulbs above and two large video screens
on either side of the stage. The band's generous

use of colors echoed the songs' musical moods: a
soft red for "All I Need," midnight blue for
"There, There" and angry scarlet for "Paranoid
Android." The clear columns also refracted
streams of white LED light, chopping up bits of
color to create sparkles. Meanwhile, the large
video screens were broken into four panels, each
broadcasting off-center video feeds of the band
members as they played. Lead singer Yorke
came off as twisted and passionate, while the
Greenw(x)d brothers came off as cool and cere
bral. Two Tibetan Hags adorned the stage as a
part of the band's decades-long advocacy for
Tibetan independence.
Musically. Radiohead's set drew heavily from
their most recent LP, "In Rainbows," but also
dabbled in their earlier albums, particularly "OK
Computer." The band began their set with the

breakneck clicking intro of "15 Steps," as they
sauntered onstage to look out at the waiting Cans.
Soon they moved on to "Reckoner" and the sin
ister echo of "There, There." Their only selec
tion from "Hail to the Thief 1 was both haunting
and beautiful, particularly when paired with a
light show that resembled the claustrophobic for
est of their music video. The next song, "All I
Need" was a fragile highlight until it exploded
with fat piano chords and sparkling noise.
The band only grew better as the set went on.
Another outstanding new tune — they played
virtually the entirety of "In Rainbows" — was
"Weird Fishes/Arpeggi." Lyrically the song is a
tense tale of dying and finding bliss at the ocean
floor. Sonically the guitars were repetitive and
light, and visually the set was a stunning ocean
blue. Next was "Idioteque" and Yorke's best

moment of the night: dancing like an insane
raver during the song's final twitch-pop break
down. Later. Johnny Greenwood channeled
Jimmy Page hy used a violin bow on his electric
guitar to create the ghostly atmospherics that
underpin the simple piano chords of "Pyramid
Song." "Karma Police." meanwhile, was a bit
disappointing, but still enjoyable. Instead of a
textured, bass-heavy sound like in the recording,
the acoustic guitar and organ were flimsy sound
ing. Even so. the band built up momentum and
delivered a memorable final minute to the song.
Throughout all the set. Radiohead had three
secret weapons working for it. First, there was
Yorke's voice. Chords and beats would swirl
chaotically underneath while Yorke's voice
remained flawlessly in key. Also, Johnny
Greenwood added his signature electronic
soundscapes. As his bandmates worked away at
traditional instruments, Greendwood used com
puters, ondes martenots and synthesizers to add
ambient noises and programmed beats. Finally,
to my surprise, Radiohead relied heavily on its
drummer. Phil Selway played with a clean profi
ciency that created an exactness of timing that
the wildness of their melodies lacked.
The only real problem with Radiohead's set
was technical. Midway through "Airbag," the
unthinkable happened: Radiohead went totally
silent. The band kept playing but nothing was
amplified. Thousands of enraptured fans began
to murmur in confusion. ("Was this intention
al?" we all asked) But as the seconds of painful
silence slipped by, the confusion turned to anger.
Finally — after what must have seemed like a
lifetime to the festival promoters, but was in fact
only a half-minute — the sound returned. Yorke
would later quip, "Somebody spilled beer on the
plug!" But the joke wasn't quite over. The music
went out again during "All I Need." According
to Rolling Stone Magazine, Radiohead's
advanced gear was just too much for the PA sys
tem. Fortunately, the music returned again after
another half-minute. But if it hadn't —and if
Radiohead had not handled it like such profes
sionals—it could have tarnished an otherwise
outstanding set.
The first ever Outside Lands Festival was a
definite success — and there was nothing better
to start it off than Radiohead's wildly original
and entertaining live act, glitches or no glitches. -

BECK
Beck's most recent album, "Modern Guilt"
loomed large in his somewhat disappointing set
on Friday. Sequestered to a side stage just an
hour before Radiohead took the main stage,
Beck tried his best to tame the overcrowded and
unruly audience but to little avail. After launch
ing into "E-Pro" and then "Sun Eyed Girl," he
veered toward tracks like "Gamma Ray" and
"Chemtrails." — PC
BLACK MOUNTAIN

Mountain's entertaining set, the audience was
left with just a booming bass and massive drum

FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHT: Thorn Yorke led Radiohead in a crowd pleasing opener to the three
day festival. Though the amps cut out twice during the band's performance, the muscians han
dled the crisis gracefully, and fans weren't disappointed by the show in the least.
