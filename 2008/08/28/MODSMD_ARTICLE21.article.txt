## Don Cheadle adds depth and legitimacy to spy film "Traitor" 
### JEFF GILLILAND 
We've come to expect a lot from Don
Cheadle. The star of "Hotel Rwanda" and
"Talk to Me" has become one of America's
favorite "serious actors," a true professional

who takes his
craft seriously
and consis
tently delivers
a high-quality
product.
Cheadle's star
power has
become such
that any movie

with his name attached is expected to be a sig
nificant work — something special that either
redefines its genre (think "Ocean's Eleven") or
teaches us something about ourselves and our
world.
Thus, when Cheadle signed up to play a possi
bly-rogue CIA agent in "Traitor," the new
movie from writer-director Jeffrey
Nachmanoff, he sent the message that this was
not going to be your everyday spy thriller.
For the most part, "Traitor" delivers that
message. The film follows Samir Horn
(Cheadle), a Muslim born in Sudan but raised
in Chicago, as he infiltrates the cell of the ter
rorist Nathir. Samir has to deal with all the run
of-the-mill dangers of pretending to be a jihad,
as well as fend off two pesky FBI agents (Guy
Pearce and Neal McDonough) who think he's
a real terrorist and thus will not leave him
alone.
What sets "Traitor" apart from most spy
movies, and makes it worth the Cheadle name,
is the attention it pays to the terrorists them
selves. The majority of the two-hour film is
spent on the terrorists, and the movie portrays
them not as crazed fundamentalists but as
intelligent, thoughtful men who believe firmly
in the goodness of their cause. Samir himself is
a devout Muslim, though far from a jihadist,
and his conversations with terrorist leaders
Nathir (Raad Rawi) and Omar (Said
Taghmaoui), are among the best in the film.
Which is not to say that "Traitor" in any
way celebrates terrorism — it merely refrains
from vilifying it. In addition, while the movie
succeeds in presenting a balanced view of the
"terrorist" mentality, it does not fall into the
trap of doing so at the expense of the Western

"anti-terrorist" actions. Often, spy movies pre
sent the establishment forces as little more
than a bunch of bumbling idiots, who talk
tough but can't get the job done when it counts.
The "Bourne" series is a great example of this;
the CIA has 30 guys working on one case, using
the best technology in the world, yet Jason
Bourne outsmarts them all. "Traitor," for the
most part, stays away from this. Though
FBI agents Clayton (Pearce) and Archer
(McDonough) do have to wade through a fair
amount of red tape, and though their actions
are inherently reactionary — it seems the curse
of the big guy to forever play catch-up — their
efforts are efficient and more than competent.
What's more, Clayton and Archer are real,
three-dimensional characters, not just bulldogs

whose only goal is to catch the bad guys and
shoot their guns. Special commendation
should go to Guy Pearce for his portrayal of
the Southern Baptist, Ph. D.-wielding Agent
Clayton. Pearce, who hasn't done much since
"Memento," plays Clayton with a mixture of
aptitude and gentleness that's sure to earn him
a few extra looks in Hollywood.
Cheadle, as expected, crafts Samir into a
subtle and conflicted character, though at times
he allows Samir to get a little too comfortable
in his job as a professional killer. Third-time
director Jeffrey Nachmanoff shows a solid
grasp of the basics of filmmaking, emphasizing
the chiaroscuro effect of the harsher lighting of
his Middle Eastern locations and focusing
more on color and background detail in more

subdued areas such as Chicago and Canada.
Nachinanoff does have the tendency to use
visual effects such as blurs and hand-held cam
eras at inappropriate moments, but overall he
gives a solid and effective effort.
Perhaps "Traitor"s biggest surprise, though, is
that the story was written by Steve Martin, the
former "Saturday Night Live" star who previ
ously constrained his efforts to comedy.
Perhaps this film will mark the beginning of
Martin's transition into films more dramatic
than "Cheaper by the Dozen 2." And it's an
auspicious beginning, one that certainly
deserves to be called "a spy movie — but a
Don Cheadle spy movie."
