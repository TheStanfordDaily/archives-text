# LOCAL EATS
## What's for dinner? Helpful dining Web sites, guides have the answer 
### TOMMY TOBIN 
Before board bills tie us down to dining
hall food come fall, students living on or off
campus can take advantage of dining out
guilt-free. With a plethora of culinary
options up and down the Peninsula, readers
of The Weekly may find themselves lost for
advice. Although The Weekly — and thus,
Weekly food reviews — will take a short
hiatus until the start of the school year,
there are many helpful tools for navigating
the many cafes and restaurants in the Bay
Area and beyond.
Yelp.com
Yelp.com is a very helpful site, rating busi
nesses over time and doing great distribution
of data. The site, whose COO is Stanford
alum Geoff Donaker '95, actually has some
really great reviews of restaurants in the Bay
Area. For example, Cafe Del Sol in Menlo
Park has 32 reviews, with the average rating
of all reviews shown up top, along with pho

tos of the eatery. The site also boasts a set of
additional information, such as price range,
whether alcohol is available, outdoor seating
options, parking information, types of pay
ments accepted and whether it is good for
groups. If you know you like an eatery, you'll
find the sidebar very interesting — it shows
places where other viewers of the same
restaurant have dined.
Urban Spoon
Readers with iPhones may already be
familiar with the application version of
Urban Spoon. On its Web site, you can pick a
particular neighborhood and search for what
the site claims to be the "best" in the neigh
borhood. Browsers can find newly rated
restaurants and also search restaurants by
name, type of food, popularity or price.
Upon selection, usual information such as
user reviews, contact information and even
suggestions for nearby restaurants appear.
What helps set this site apart, however, is its
Like it/Don't Like it vote system and its com

pilation of reviews by professional food crit
ics. You can also add restaurants to your wish
list or mark favorites after setting up an
account.
For i Phone or iPod touch users, once you
select a city, a restaurant "slot machine" pops
up, with three slots: neighborhood, type of
food and price. Simply shake your device and
out pops a recommendation. One limitation
is that the Bay Area is grouped as two
"cities" within the application, namely San
Francisco and San Jose. You can get around
this by selecting the neighborhood you want
and locking that slot by touching the lock
icon.
Chowhound
Chowhound.chow.com offers a way for
foodies from around the world to connect
and share stories. This site provides recipes
for dishes and drinks to prepare at home. It
also offers some neat stories, such as those in
The Grinder, Chowhound's Food Media
blog. The site, however, pales in comparison

with its competitors regarding actual food
reviews.
Unofficial Guide
For reviews that cater to the Stanford stu
dent audience, be sure to check out past and
current issues of The Daily as well as the
Unofficial Guide to Stanford. The Unofficial
Guide, distributed every fall to incoming stu
dents, is great for finding a place to eat. The
Guide easily outlines nearby neighborhoods,
illustrates the price range, and provides a
quick and dirty paragraph describing the
eatery and its offerings — and it holds valu
able coupons in the back.
While this list certainly isn't comprehen
sive, it provides a good introduction as you
begin your culinary expeditions through the
local area. Like Alton Brown in his popular
Food Network show, I'll wish you "Good
Eats!"
