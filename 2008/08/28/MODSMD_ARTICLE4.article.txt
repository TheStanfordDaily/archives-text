## OFF-CAMPUS Cardinal goes blue: Stanford's ties at the Dems' National Convention 
### KALVIN WANG 
This week, Denver is hosting the
2008 Democratic National
Convention. It's just like NSO, only

While in Denver, she said she
planned to help make the convention
a "true lovefest" and share her expe

MOMocrats and the CD-14 blog
(www.obamal4.com).
"As Americans, it's easy to take
our right to vote for granted,"
Lythcott-Haims said, "and historical
