## OFF-CAMPUS Cardinal goes blue: Stanford's ties at the Dems' National Convention 
### KALVIN WANG 
This week, Denver is hosting the
2008 Democratic National
Convention. It's just like NSO, only
with more riot gear and Secret
Service agents. The sidewalks are
filled with happy, excited freshmen
("delegates," "journalists," "Finance
Guests"), their laminated passes on
neck lanyards. Many do, in fact, have
Stanford connections.
In one sense, the convention is a
reward for long months of hard work.
Like, NSO, the streets are freshly
"swept. There are separate trash, recy
cling and compost bins on every cor

ner, and nobody can figure them out.
Google is a sponsor. At night, the del
egates file into MemAud ("Pepsi
Center") to be convinced that the
next four years of their lives — if they
make the right choices — will be so
much better than the last four. Or
eight.
There's also the presence of
Stanford Dean of Freshmen and
Democratic delegate (CD-14) Julie
Lythcott-Haims '89, who led a crowd
in cheers against an anti-gay-protes
tor outside the Denver Sheraton on
Tuesday.
No, she hasn't been yelling
"OHH, EIGHT! OHH, BAMA!,"

but before the convention Lythcott-
Haims called the upcoming week
"crazy, exciting, overwhelming ...
truly historic."
While in Denver, she said she
planned to help make the convention
a "true lovefest" and share her expe
riences by blogging for the
MOMocrats and the CD-14 blog
(www.obamal4.com).
"As Americans, it's easy to take
our right to vote for granted,"
Lythcott-Haims said, "and historical
ly the percentage of people who vote
is quite 10w... [national politics play

out at a local level], and I want to
make civic engagement a priority for
all of us."
Still, Lythcott-Haims wanted to
"draw appropriate lines" between her
work for Stanford and the Obama
campaign, and she noted that Stanford
will take precedence during election
week in November. Lythcott-Haims,
who was born in Nigeria, will be trav
eling in Africa that week with a con
sortium of universities, to make sure
"talented kids on the continent of
Africa know about schools like
Stanford."
The week after, she will be in
Kenya, where Obama still has family.
"I think the Kenyans think of him
as one of theirs, and have such pride,"
she said. "I think they'll be as ecstatic
as we are."
Obama supporters here are
beyond ecstatic, and not just because
Obama became the first African-
American major party nominee yes
terday evening. There are over 350
official parties being thrown by
Democratic supporters (and, since this
is 2008 and transparency is the buzz
word, you can find them all at the
Sunlight Foundation's "Party Time"
Web site at www.political
partytime.com).
One of those supporters, Meena
Harris '06, is here with her aunt
Kamala Harris, San Francisco district
attorney and an Obama delegate.
Meena is passionate about voting
rights ("the process itself is just dis
couraging," as contrasted with
Europe's universal registration sys
tem, Harris said) and social justice
issues. She said that her work with the
Obama campaign, however, restored
her faith in the process.
"For the first time, people were just
as enthusiastic as I was, instead of 'Oh,
Meena, going to these political events'
... you meet all these people who've
spent countless money and time"
working for Obama, Harris said. "You
form these incredible bonds."
As an employee at Facebook since
2006, Harris watched Facebook co
founder Chris Hughes leave in

February 2(X)7 to help lead Obama's
Internet strategy. And Facebook
founder Mark Zuckerberg, though
"very careful" to keep Facebook non
partisan, is a "big fan" of Obama,
Harris said.
While Obama appears to have a
lock on the under-29 demographic, he
has older Silicon Valley fans here in
Denver as well. John Roos '77, is stay
ing at the same hotel as Obama and
vice presidential nominee Joe Biden,
the downtown Westin. As California
finance co-chair and CEO of the pow
erhouse law firm Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich & Rosati, Roos has gath
ered over $500,000 for the Obama
campaign, according to
opensecrets.org.
Roos compared Obama to "a lot of
the young CEOs I work with," with
"the vision, incredible intelligence and
judgment." He believes Obama has
already made the transition to success
ful CEO in the course of managing
what is now a $4(X) million campaign.
"I've never seen a campaign that
has put together such a thoughtful
plan, sticking to a game plan, making
adjustments," Roos said.
Aside from its well-managed
finances, Roos said he supports
Obama's foreign policy in light of
America's status internationally.
"I do some travel overseas, and I've
never seen our reputation poorer," he
said. "I believe the day [Obama] is elect
ed president, America's back... people
want to believe in America, in its lead
ership, and we haven't had that."
There aren't many people in Denver
right now who would disagree with
Roos; as Lythcott-Haims predicted,
it's mostly one big lovefest.
Perhaps Tamra Del Molle '90, a con
vention volunteer who said she was
"robbed of [her| mind when Bush won
a second term," made an even better
comparison when she called the con
vention"the most enormous wedding
you could imagine."
And watching the speeches each night,
one could certainly conclude that the
Democratic Party — having fought its
way down the primary aisle — is des
perately hoping to live happily ever
after. At least until the Class of 2016
comes along.

2008 Democratic National
Convention. It's just like NSO, only
with more riot gear and Secret
Service agents. The sidewalks are
filled with happy, excited freshmen
("delegates," "journalists," "Finance
Guests"), their laminated passes on
neck lanyards. Many do, in fact, have
Stanford connections.
In one sense, the convention is a
reward for long months of hard work.
Like, NSO, the streets are freshly
"swept. There are separate trash, recy
cling and compost bins on every cor

ner, and nobody can figure them out.
Google is a sponsor. At night, the del
egates file into MemAud ("Pepsi
Center") to be convinced that the
next four years of their lives — if they
make the right choices — will be so
much better than the last four. Or
eight.
There's also the presence of
Stanford Dean of Freshmen and
Democratic delegate (CD-14) Julie
Lythcott-Haims '89, who led a crowd
in cheers against an anti-gay-protes
tor outside the Denver Sheraton on
Tuesday.
No, she hasn't been yelling
"OHH, EIGHT! OHH, BAMA!,"

but before the convention Lythcott-
Haims called the upcoming week
"crazy, exciting, overwhelming ...
truly historic."
While in Denver, she said she
planned to help make the convention
a "true lovefest" and share her expe
riences by blogging for the
MOMocrats and the CD-14 blog
(www.obamal4.com).
"As Americans, it's easy to take
our right to vote for granted,"
Lythcott-Haims said, "and historical
ly the percentage of people who vote
is quite 10w... [national politics play

out at a local level], and I want to
make civic engagement a priority for
all of us."
Still, Lythcott-Haims wanted to
"draw appropriate lines" between her
work for Stanford and the Obama
campaign, and she noted that Stanford
will take precedence during election
week in November. Lythcott-Haims,
who was born in Nigeria, will be trav
eling in Africa that week with a con
sortium of universities, to make sure
"talented kids on the continent of
Africa know about schools like
Stanford."
The week after, she will be in
Kenya, where Obama still has family.
"I think the Kenyans think of him
as one of theirs, and have such pride,"
she said. "I think they'll be as ecstatic
as we are."
Obama supporters here are
beyond ecstatic, and not just because
Obama became the first African-
American major party nominee yes
terday evening. There are over 350
official parties being thrown by
Democratic supporters (and, since this
is 2008 and transparency is the buzz
word, you can find them all at the
Sunlight Foundation's "Party Time"
Web site at www.political
partytime.com).
One of those supporters, Meena
Harris '06, is here with her aunt
Kamala Harris, San Francisco district
attorney and an Obama delegate.
Meena is passionate about voting
rights ("the process itself is just dis
couraging," as contrasted with
Europe's universal registration sys
tem, Harris said) and social justice
issues. She said that her work with the
Obama campaign, however, restored
her faith in the process.
"For the first time, people were just
as enthusiastic as I was, instead of 'Oh,
Meena, going to these political events'
... you meet all these people who've
spent countless money and time"
working for Obama, Harris said. "You
form these incredible bonds."
As an employee at Facebook since
2006, Harris watched Facebook co
founder Chris Hughes leave in

February 2(X)7 to help lead Obama's
Internet strategy. And Facebook
founder Mark Zuckerberg, though
"very careful" to keep Facebook non
partisan, is a "big fan" of Obama,
Harris said.
While Obama appears to have a
lock on the under-29 demographic, he
has older Silicon Valley fans here in
Denver as well. John Roos '77, is stay
ing at the same hotel as Obama and
vice presidential nominee Joe Biden,
the downtown Westin. As California
finance co-chair and CEO of the pow
erhouse law firm Wilson Sonsini
Goodrich & Rosati, Roos has gath
ered over $500,000 for the Obama
campaign, according to
opensecrets.org.
Roos compared Obama to "a lot of
the young CEOs I work with," with
"the vision, incredible intelligence and
judgment." He believes Obama has
already made the transition to success
ful CEO in the course of managing
what is now a $4(X) million campaign.
"I've never seen a campaign that
has put together such a thoughtful
plan, sticking to a game plan, making
adjustments," Roos said.
Aside from its well-managed
finances, Roos said he supports
Obama's foreign policy in light of
America's status internationally.
"I do some travel overseas, and I've
never seen our reputation poorer," he
said. "I believe the day [Obama] is elect
ed president, America's back... people
want to believe in America, in its lead
ership, and we haven't had that."
There aren't many people in Denver
right now who would disagree with
Roos; as Lythcott-Haims predicted,
it's mostly one big lovefest.
Perhaps Tamra Del Molle '90, a con
vention volunteer who said she was
"robbed of [her| mind when Bush won
a second term," made an even better
comparison when she called the con
vention"the most enormous wedding
you could imagine."
And watching the speeches each night,
one could certainly conclude that the
Democratic Party — having fought its
way down the primary aisle — is des
perately hoping to live happily ever
after. At least until the Class of 2016
comes along.
