## Med school restricts use of industry funds Stanford limits outside money for CME classes 
### NIKHIL JOSHI NEWS EDITOR 
Stanford School of Medicine
announced Tuesday that it would place
severe limitations on industry funding
of its continuing medical education
(CME) classes. Drug and device com
panies will no longer be allowed to
fund specific courses, but will instead
be asked to donate to a pool that will be
used for all classes.
Stanford is now part of a very small
group of medical schools that have
restricted companies to "pool funding"
for medical education. The New York
Times reported that five other schools
have taken a similar approach, but
Stanford officials suggested that the
group is even smaller.
The new policy is the latest move by
the medical school to mitigate conflicts
of interest.
"The decision about CME is really
part of a series of policy decisions on
the broad topic of conflict of interest
that have been ongoing since 2004-
2005," said Medical School Dean Philip
Pizzo in an email to The Weekly. "We
began with our decision to ban gifts
from industry in 2006. This was fol
lowed by other revisions in our conflict
of interest policies for clinical practice."
Last year, Pizzo appointed a task
force to look into CME funding,
chaired by Dr. Harry Greenberg,
senior associate dean for research.
"There were lots of concerns
appearing at the same time —
Congress and various other groups had
expressed concern," Greenberg said.
"We thought it would be reasonable
for Stanford to have a committee and
evaluate the story for industry support

for CME at Stanford, and then to servo
that up to the dean, willi our options."
Concerns about industry funding
were indeed brewing in the public: Sen.
Charles Grassley (R-IA) published a
report in April 2(X)7 detailing how com
panies sponsored CME courses to
increase sales of medical products.
But Pizzo insisted that this week's
decision is the culmination of a long,
thoughtful evaluation of conflicts of
interest, and not a reaction to recent
concerns.
"The decision to develop the new
policies is in response to the options
developed by the CME Task Force,"
Pizzo said. "So this has really been a
continuing and evolving assessment
about industry relations and not a
response to some new or precipitous
event."
Pizzo said that it is his belief that the
new policy will improve continuing
medical education at Stanford.
"1 do not think that the quality of
CME will be harmed," Pizzo said, "but
I do believe that the integrity of our
educational programs and their free
dom from any bias will be better
achieved with these new policies."
The new policy is, in fact, just a part
of a host of measures that Stanford is
planning to improve its CME courses.
"Current CME is traditionally lec
ture-based— what's the newest and
greatest, as opposed to how do we
improve the health of this group of
patients," Greenberg said. "I think
Rob [Jackler, associate dean for CME]
has plans that we will shift content, irre
spective of funding, to better education
of improving outcomes and quality,
and less emphasis on medical facts."
Still, the threat of losing funding due
to the new policies has a few officials
worried about CME's future.
"Many of the clinical chairs were
