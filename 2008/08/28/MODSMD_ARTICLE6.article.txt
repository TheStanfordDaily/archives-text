## University leaders call for discussion of drinking age 
### SCOTT SAYARE 
The Amethyst Initiative, a statement calling for open
public discourse on the federally mandated drinking age
of 21, has been signed by presidents from more than 130
American colleges and universities over the past lour
months, receiving significant attention from the media.
But Stanford won't be signing onto the initiative.
President John L. Hennessy said in a phone interview
with The Weekly that he is "sympathetic" to the goals of
the initiative and would welcome debate on the subject ol
the drinking age, but will not be signing on.
"1 think it is extremely unfortunate that they moved
forward without making a strong statement about DUI
laws," Hennessy said. "It doesn't make sense to move
forward without that lie."

Ralph Castro, manager of the University's Substance
Abuse Prevention Program, agrees that the initiative
lacks some necessary provisions.
"If they lowered it arbitrarily it wouldn't necessarily
be effective in reducing high-risk drinking," he said of the
drinking age. "There would have to be a lot of work on
the front end to get it down."
"The problem now," Castro continued, "is we don't
necessarily have standardized education for alcohol." He
suggested that a hypothetical lowering of the drinking
age be accompanied by a permit system akin to that
which exists for driving, including mandatory education
and a gradual increase in privileges.
Despite the problems pointed out by Hennessy and
Castro, the initiative does seem to be succeeding in its
mission to increase public debate over the drinking age.

"We're trying to get peo
pie to support the general
idea of debate," said Grace
Kronenberg. assistant to
the director of Choose
Responsibility, the advoca
cy group behind the state
ment. "It's an issue that
most Americans have seen
as settled over the past 25
years." she said, referencing
the drinking age.

launched countless editorials
regarding the drinking age, and has
sparked a frenzy of media coverage.
While the initiative may be far from
creating any actual changes in the
law, it is getting a lot of attention.
"Twenty-one is not working,"
reads the statement. It calls for "an
informed and dispassionate public
debate over the effects of the 21-
year-old drinking age."
In 1984, Congress passed the
National Minimum Drinking Age
Act, mandating that 10 percent of
allotted federal highway aid be with
held from states setting a legal
drinking age of less than 21. In 1982,
only 14 states maintained a drinking
age of 21, but by 1988, every state in
the union had adopted that limit.
California is slated to receive $3.3
billion in federal highway aid for fis
cal year 2009.
Experts argue over the impact
the increased drinking age has had
on drinking behavior among 18- to
20-year-olds. But proponents of the
21-year limit point to significant
decreases in alcohol-related deaths
for that age group since 1984.
According to Mothers Against
Drunk Driving (MADD) and the
National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA), the law
has saved 25,000 lives, including an

estimated 900 in 2006.
MADD has lambasted the peti
tion and its signatories, calling it a
"misguided initiative that uses delib
erately misleading information to
confuse the public on the effective
ness of the 21 law."
"It is deeply disappointing to
me," said MADD National
President Laura Dean-Mooney in a
press release, "that many of our edu
cational leaders would support an
initiative without doing their home
work on the underlying research and
science."
MADD, in conjunction with the
Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety (IIHS), the American
Medical Association (AMA), the
National Transportation Safety
Board (NTSB), and the Governors
Highway Safety Association
(GHSA), has called on the presi
dents to remove their names from
the statement, encouraging MADD
supporters to pressure them.
Signatories report being inundated
by hundreds of identical emails from
MADD supporters.
At least two presidents have
removed their names from the list in
the past week, though about 30
added their signatures over that
period. The 129 current signatories
include the presidents of
Dartmouth, Duke, Johns Hopkins,
Ohio State, Pomona, Santa Clara
University and Tufts.
"This is not a simple question,"
wrote Duke President Richard H.
Brodhead in a statement on the

Amethyst Initiative website. "But
the current answer is also not an
effective solution to the problem."
Pomona President David Oxtoby
wrote, "I support this initiative
because it will allow our colleges to
engage in real education of our stu
dents about responsible use of alco
hol, as well as model moderate
behavior.
"Treating college students as
adults will help them to make more
responsible decisions," he conclud
ed.
Castro noted that drinking-relat
ed problems on campus have
declined significantly in recent
years, a shift he attributes to an
increase in the University's alcohol
education efforts.
For the past three years, incom
ing freshmen have been required to
complete a two-hour online alcohol
education course called
AlcoholEdu. Castro said Stanford
has also stepped up alcohol training
for residential staff.
"We've seen some very dramatic
changes over the past four years," he
said, citing a 67-percent drop in on
campus medical transports for alco
hol-related reasons.
Asked about the potential effects
of a lowered drinking age on
University policy, Castro said,
"There might be stricter rules in
place."
"As an institution of higher edu
cation, our first responsibility is to
educate students," he explained. But
with a lower drinking age, and an

accompanying expectation that legal
drinkers abide by laws governing
public behavior, he suggested that
Stanford might shift its focus away
from tolerant instruction toward
enforcement and punishment.
Though pleased with the national
media attention, Choose
Responsibility has been frustrated
by what it characterizes as a misun
derstanding of the initiative's goals,
and the "staunch, knee-jerk

response that it's received."
"It's not calling for a lower drink
ing age, not calling for an 18-year
old drinking age," Kronenberg said.
"It needs to be objective and
fair," she said of public discourse on
the drinking age. "And I don't think
those adjectives are at play right
now."

changes over the past four years," he
said, citing a 67-percent drop in on
campus medical transports for alco
hol-related reasons.
Asked about the potential effects
of a lowered drinking age on
University policy, Castro said,
"There might be stricter rules in
place."
"As an institution of higher edu
cation, our first responsibility is to
educate students," he explained. But
with a lower drinking age, and an

accompanying expectation that legal
drinkers abide by laws governing
public behavior, he suggested that
Stanford might shift its focus away
from tolerant instruction toward
enforcement and punishment.
Though pleased with the national
media attention, Choose
Responsibility has been frustrated
by what it characterizes as a misun
derstanding of the initiative's goals,
and the "staunch, knee-jerk

response that it's received."
"It's not calling for a lower drink
ing age, not calling for an 18-year
old drinking age," Kronenberg said.
"It needs to be objective and
fair," she said of public discourse on
the drinking age. "And I don't think
those adjectives are at play right
now."

The Amethyst Initiative, a statement calling for open
public discourse on the federally mandated drinking age
of 21, has been signed by presidents from more than 130
American colleges and universities over the past lour
months, receiving significant attention from the media.
But Stanford won't be signing onto the initiative.
President John L. Hennessy said in a phone interview
with The Weekly that he is "sympathetic" to the goals of
the initiative and would welcome debate on the subject ol
the drinking age, but will not be signing on.
"1 think it is extremely unfortunate that they moved
forward without making a strong statement about DUI
laws," Hennessy said. "It doesn't make sense to move
forward without that lie."

Ralph Castro, manager of the University's Substance
Abuse Prevention Program, agrees that the initiative
lacks some necessary provisions.
"If they lowered it arbitrarily it wouldn't necessarily
be effective in reducing high-risk drinking," he said of the
drinking age. "There would have to be a lot of work on
the front end to get it down."
"The problem now," Castro continued, "is we don't
necessarily have standardized education for alcohol." He
suggested that a hypothetical lowering of the drinking
age be accompanied by a permit system akin to that
which exists for driving, including mandatory education
and a gradual increase in privileges.
Despite the problems pointed out by Hennessy and
Castro, the initiative does seem to be succeeding in its
mission to increase public debate over the drinking age.

"We're trying to get peo
pie to support the general
idea of debate," said Grace
Kronenberg. assistant to
the director of Choose
Responsibility, the advoca
cy group behind the state
ment. "It's an issue that
most Americans have seen
as settled over the past 25
years." she said, referencing
the drinking age.
The support of a number
of college presidents


CRISTINA BAUTISTA/The Stanford Daily
launched countless editorials
regarding the drinking age, and has
sparked a frenzy of media coverage.
While the initiative may be far from
creating any actual changes in the
law, it is getting a lot of attention.
"Twenty-one is not working,"
reads the statement. It calls for "an
informed and dispassionate public
debate over the effects of the 21-
year-old drinking age."
In 1984, Congress passed the
National Minimum Drinking Age
Act, mandating that 10 percent of
allotted federal highway aid be with
held from states setting a legal
drinking age of less than 21. In 1982,
only 14 states maintained a drinking
age of 21, but by 1988, every state in
the union had adopted that limit.
California is slated to receive $3.3
billion in federal highway aid for fis
cal year 2009.
Experts argue over the impact
the increased drinking age has had
on drinking behavior among 18- to
20-year-olds. But proponents of the
21-year limit point to significant
decreases in alcohol-related deaths
for that age group since 1984.
According to Mothers Against
Drunk Driving (MADD) and the
National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration (NHTSA), the law
has saved 25,000 lives, including an

estimated 900 in 2006.
MADD has lambasted the peti
tion and its signatories, calling it a
"misguided initiative that uses delib
erately misleading information to
confuse the public on the effective
ness of the 21 law."
"It is deeply disappointing to
me," said MADD National
President Laura Dean-Mooney in a
press release, "that many of our edu
cational leaders would support an
initiative without doing their home
work on the underlying research and
science."
MADD, in conjunction with the
Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety (IIHS), the American
Medical Association (AMA), the
National Transportation Safety
Board (NTSB), and the Governors
Highway Safety Association
(GHSA), has called on the presi
dents to remove their names from
the statement, encouraging MADD
supporters to pressure them.
Signatories report being inundated
by hundreds of identical emails from
MADD supporters.
At least two presidents have
removed their names from the list in
the past week, though about 30
added their signatures over that
period. The 129 current signatories
include the presidents of
Dartmouth, Duke, Johns Hopkins,
Ohio State, Pomona, Santa Clara
University and Tufts.
"This is not a simple question,"
wrote Duke President Richard H.
Brodhead in a statement on the

Amethyst Initiative website. "But
the current answer is also not an
effective solution to the problem."
Pomona President David Oxtoby
wrote, "I support this initiative
because it will allow our colleges to
engage in real education of our stu
dents about responsible use of alco
hol, as well as model moderate
behavior.
"Treating college students as
adults will help them to make more
responsible decisions," he conclud
ed.
Castro noted that drinking-relat
ed problems on campus have
declined significantly in recent
years, a shift he attributes to an
increase in the University's alcohol
education efforts.
For the past three years, incom
ing freshmen have been required to
complete a two-hour online alcohol
education course called
AlcoholEdu. Castro said Stanford
has also stepped up alcohol training
for residential staff.
"We've seen some very dramatic
changes over the past four years," he
said, citing a 67-percent drop in on
campus medical transports for alco
hol-related reasons.
