## University leaders call for discussion of drinking age 
### SCOTT SAYARE 
The Amethyst Initiative, a statement calling for open
public discourse on the federally mandated drinking age
of 21, has been signed by presidents from more than 130
American colleges and universities over the past lour
months, receiving significant attention from the media.
But Stanford won't be signing onto the initiative.
President John L. Hennessy said in a phone interview
with The Weekly that he is "sympathetic" to the goals of
the initiative and would welcome debate on the subject ol
the drinking age, but will not be signing on.
"1 think it is extremely unfortunate that they moved
forward without making a strong statement about DUI
laws," Hennessy said. "It doesn't make sense to move
forward without that lie."

Ralph Castro, manager of the University's Substance
Abuse Prevention Program, agrees that the initiative
lacks some necessary provisions.
"If they lowered it arbitrarily it wouldn't necessarily
be effective in reducing high-risk drinking," he said of the
drinking age. "There would have to be a lot of work on
the front end to get it down."
"The problem now," Castro continued, "is we don't
necessarily have standardized education for alcohol." He
suggested that a hypothetical lowering of the drinking
age be accompanied by a permit system akin to that
which exists for driving, including mandatory education
and a gradual increase in privileges.
Despite the problems pointed out by Hennessy and
Castro, the initiative does seem to be succeeding in its
mission to increase public debate over the drinking age.

"We're trying to get peo
pie to support the general
idea of debate," said Grace
Kronenberg. assistant to
the director of Choose
Responsibility, the advoca
cy group behind the state
ment. "It's an issue that
most Americans have seen
as settled over the past 25
years." she said, referencing
the drinking age.
