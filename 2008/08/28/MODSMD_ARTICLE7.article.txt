## Admissions looks to add interviews Alumni interview pilot program will launch for the 08-09 applicant pool 
### JOANNA XU SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Office of Undergraduate Admissions is taking
steps to add an element to its admissions process that
has heretofore been conspicuously absent — the alumni
interview.
Dean of Admissions Richard Shaw recently
announced a pilot alumni interview program that will
offer optional alumni interviews to 2(X)8-2(XW under
graduate applicants from Atlanta, Denver, London.
New York City. Philadelphia and Portland.
The six cities were chosen because they offered an
appropriate cross section of the applicant pool, geo
graphical area and alumni network.
The admissions office cites three main reasons for the
introduction of the pilot alumni interview program: to
personalize the admission process for Stanford appli
cants, to add additional information on applicants for
the admissions office and to further engage alumni in
the admissions process.
"We want to take every opportunity to put a face on
Stanford so that the students we really want have a hard
er time saying no to us," Director of Admissions Shawn
Abbott said in an email to The Weekly. "And we also
want to make sure that the students we are saying yes to
are really the right students for Stanford."
Alumni across the six pilot cities are eager to partici
pate in the new alumni interview program. Portland res
ident Steve Jewell '74, whose wife is also a Stanford
alumna, is enthusiastic and said the alumni interview
program will be beneficial for both the applicants and
Stanford.
"I have gone to numerous send-off parties for newly
admitted Stanford undergraduates, and I often hear stu
dents trying to decide between Stanford and other uni

versities saying that they have had more personal con
tact with other universities that offered interviews,"
Jewell said.
"Also, for students from the East Coast who may
have concerns about the move, an alumni interviewer
can answer questions about the West Coast and assuage
the fears of students and their parents," he added. "The
alumni can be a goodwill ambassador of sorts for the
University."
Abbott too sees the pilot alumni interview program
as a perfect extension of his ongoing goal to engage
alumni in the work of the admissions office.
"Alumni interviews are just one part of our OVAL
[Outreach Volunteer Alumni Link] efforts," Abbott
said. "We recognize alumni as a great, largely untapped
resource for our office — especially in places far from
California, where we often don't have as many local
resources as our peers."
Abbott, however, emphasizes that the admissions
office, not the alumni, will still be making the admission
decisions.
"Alumni will be able to play an important role in cor
roborating the other information we have in the admis
sions file, as well as bringing to light information that
might not otherwise be apparent in a written applica
tion," Abbott said. "[But] every final admission decision
rests with the admission committee."
The admissions office also emphasizes that applicants
not offered an interview will not be at a disadvantage.
Because the alumni interview is still a pilot program, less
than four percent of the applicants will be interviewed.
Furthermore, applicants from the six cities can
choose to not be interviewed, though the admissions
office encourages them to opt for an interview.
"The small size of the pilot allows us to implement a
rigorous, systematic evaluation of each interview
report," Abbott added. "In the spring of 2009, we will
analyze the hard data and also survey the participants in
the interview process."
Logistically, admissions will match eligible students
place for the interview. Subsequently,
the alumni interviewer will write up
and submit an interview report via the
Internet to admissions. Each alumnus
will interview anywhere from three to
five applicants between October and
March.
"We'd like alumni to approach
their meetings with applicants as less

of a formal interview and more of a
conversation — a back-and-forth
exchange in which the alumna/us
shares his/her experience of Stanford
and in turn discovers what is out
standing about the applicant,"
Abbott said.
As of late August, approximately
9(X) alumni had registered to partici
pate in the six-city pilot interview pro
gram. The admissions office will hold
interview program workshops during
the fall in each pilot city to train the
volunteer alumni interviewers.
Currently, over 2,(XK) alumni are

registered as admissions volunteers,
representing Stanford at various col
lege fairs and information sessions
across the globe. The Office of
Undergraduate Admissions will
announce future directions for the
alumni interview program in the
spring or early summer of 2009.
"For the applicants, the admissions
office and the alumni, we think [the
pilot alumni interview program] will
be a win-win-win," Abbott said.
