## Alum earns nod at Teen Choice Awards Kjerstin Erikson '08 awarded $10,000 for her non-profit aimed at helping African refugees 
### STAGE CHAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Based on the eight combined surf
board trophies that Miley Cyrus and
the Jonas Brothers walked away with
at this month's Teen Choice Awards,
it might seem like pop sensations are the
only thing on teenage minds. Still, more seri
ous and worldly issues — like transforming
the lives of African refugees through educa
tion, empowerment and economic self-suffi
ciency — seem to have a place as well.
Kjerstin Erickson '08, 25-year-old
founder and executive director of FORGE
(Facilitating Opportunities for Refugee
Growth and Empowerment)was one of nine
nominees for the "Do Something Award."
the only non-celebrity award presented at
the Aug. 4 Teen Choice Awards. Though she
didn't win, the show's producers were
impressed with the unbridled passion and
selfless dedication that she and the seven
other runners-up had shown, and each was
presented with $10,000 for their respective
organizations and efforts. Chad Bullock, an
anti-smoking activist, won the $100,000
grand prize.
"It was still really great. Such a cool
thing," Erickson said. "Any time the organi
zation makes money, it's just a huge sigh of
relief."
Finances are among the many things that
Erickson manages at FORGE, which she
founded during her junior year at Stanford.
Many events brought her to that point,
including traveling to Kenya as a high
schooler, majoring in public policy and inter
national education, traveling to a refugee
camp in Botswana with a Stanford student
group and leading a voyage to Tanzania dur
ing her Semester at Sea.
"The Tanzania visit was just supposed to

be a one-time project, but during my
Semester at Sea, I met people and talked to
them and started thinking about what was
larger than just myself," Erickson said. "The
seeds started to germinate in terms of what I
was passionate about."
When Erickson saw that the international
system was not taking care of refugees, she
decided that something needed to be done.
"We got a group of 25 students to return
the next summer, and in 2004, we hit the
ground," she said. "I thought, 'This has to go
somewhere.'"
And to Africa it went. What started out as
a Stanford trip evolved into an organization
with a permanent, Oakland-based office, 12

full-time international field staff and three
camps of 150 refugee staff members.
Erickson took three years off from college,
earning a degree in 2008 instead of 2(X)5.
"In the first few years, a lot of my family
thought 'Oh. she's just doing her thing,"
Erickson said. "But then they realized, 'I
guess this is kind of serious!"'
To support FORGE, Erickson was grant
ed a $S,(XK) Haas Public Fellowship, $10,(XK)
from the Facebook Causes Challenge, an
extra $17,000 in donations and an official
partnership with the United Nations
Refugee Agency (IJNHCR).
Yet, while Erickson pours her heart and
tireless devotion into the organization, it's

easy to forgot that she's just a few years out
of college and that she was once the typical
driven, intellectual, well-rounded Stanford
student. In the years before FORGE,
Erickson was a Miss Sonoma County, as well
as heavily involved in volunteering — some
thing her family, particularly her mom, had
instilled in her since she was young. Creating
a Montessori-based math tutoring program
for homeless children, volunteering with a
mentally and physically disabled baseball
league and chairing a Youth Volunteer
Corps are just a few of Erickson's many mag
nanimous efforts.
Though she had already started and man
aged a successful non-profit organization,
returning to Stanford was something
Erickson had to do.
"1 just loved all the extra resources more
than everything else," she said. "Going back
to school makes you realize how much is at
your fingertips. Stanford makes it really easy.
Not every student gets that from their col
lege."
"School forces you to question your place
in the world," she added. "It makes you real
ly skeptical of how much you can do and how
you're going to do it. It can feel frustrating
and just inhibiting, but ultimately the profes
sors and general academic environment and
international development pushed FORGE
to be as solid as it could be."
Building on this foundation, FORGE is
beginning to transfer responsibility to the
refugees and let them collaborate in and
start projects where, according to Erickson,
they see a need for the organization's most
exciting future projects. Erickson and
FORGE are also looking to expand into
Congo, where refugees are currently
returning.
This constant foresight is characteristic of

FORGE: Facilitating Opportunities for Refugee Growth and Empowerment was founded by
Erickson in her Junior year at Stanford. After traveling multiple times to countries in Africa and
seeing the need for support first hand, she knew it was time to take action.
Erickson's dedication to FORGE.
"Kjerstin is tirelessly devoted to
what she does," said FORGE
Programming Director Abby
Speight '08. "Even as a 25-year-old,
she works all the time. You don't
find thai in many people, especially if
they don't make that much money.
She also stopped out of college and
finished her degree while working
full-time. Hers was just such a unique
situation."
A unique situation for a unique
person. Like the many other
Stanford graduates before her,
Erickson has continued to follow
her passion, helping the world one
selfless effort at a time. And now,
maybe the millions of teens who
saw her nominated at the Teen
Choice Awards will follow, too.
