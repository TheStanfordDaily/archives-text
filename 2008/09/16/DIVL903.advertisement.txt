AAAS£
The Program in African and African American Studies
WELCOMES
the Class of 2012!
Established in 1969, AAAS was the first ethnic studies program developed at Stanford
University, and the first African & African American Studies program at a private
institution in the U.S. We provide an interdisciplinary approach to the study of peoples of
African descent as a central component of various societies and cultures, offering courses
that promote research across departmental boundaries.
We also have an extensive network of Stanford scholars who work in race studies, in concert
with the Center for Comparative Studies in Race and Ethnicity (CCSRE). AAAS
encourages students to use interdisciplinary methods drawn from anthropology, art, art
history, economics, languages, linguistics and literature, music, philosophy, political science,
psychology, and religion, among others.
To learn more about how you can explore your passion through AAAS, come to our Open
House! Hear about our exciting Race Forward initiative, beginning this year with Race and
Faith !
