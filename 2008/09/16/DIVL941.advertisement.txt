DEAR DR. PAUL,
I'm a freshman here on the Farm and I'm
really excited to meet some new people,
I've heard some
scary statistics about STDs though. What's
your advice?
Dear Safc-or-Sorry,
I often hear students voice such concerns about Stanford students, like all
sexually active populations, being in less-than-perfect health. You ought to
know DP's first rule on protection: two condoms will not be twice as
effective because they will cause each other to break. Use one. You can pick
up 12 free per quarter at the SHPRC in Vaden. Hopefully, this secret will
enable you to avoid the terrible prices that, Lord knows, Doctor Paul has
paid in his encounters with just about every Sexually Transmitted
Infection—including some previously only
seen in animals. On a more serious note,
your partner may not know whether they ™
have an STL Simply stated: Without a test, g
you can't be sure. Be smart and wear a love / \
glove. Remember, a one-night stand only | I ■ | 3 I
lasts 'til the morning, but herpes lasts forev- 1"^
Doctor Paul
GOT A BURNING QUESTION YOU'RE TOO EMBARRASSED TO
