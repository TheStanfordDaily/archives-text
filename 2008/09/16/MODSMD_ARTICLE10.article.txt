## New diversion program gives bikers a second chance Bike ticket can be dismissed by participation in program 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
The Department of Public Safety is giving
Stanford bicyclists a second chance.This fall, the
department will introduce a program allowing
bicyclists who receive a moving violation ticket
to attend a one-hour diversion program instead
of having to pay a fine or appear in court.
"This new program was motivated, more
than anything. by a desire to promote the educa
tional aspect of bicycling safety here on cam
pus," said Deputy Allen James, who spearhead
ed the development and implementation of the
program. "If you just give someone a ticket,
that's not necessarilv the most effective means

of teaching them the rules of the road."
Examples of bicycling transgressions that
could be vacated by participation in the hour
long diversion program include not stopping at
stop signs, biking too fast and biking with head
phones in both ears — in short, violating any
rule to which automobile drivers must adhere.
Currently, the plan allows for one program to
be held on the third Monday of every month,
between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. in the Parking and
Transportation Services building. However.
James is optimistic that a second meeting will
soon be added.
The meetings are co-taught by James and
Ariadne Scott, the bicycle program coordinator
on campus.The duo presents a PowerPoint pres
entation about the rules of the road and proper
biking etiquette, show brief video clips and open
the floor for a question-and-answer session at
the end.
"I~he sessions are very hands-on. practical

and easy to understand," Scott said. " The main
point we try to stress is that we all share the road
and we all need to be concerned with riding
properly and respecting others, be it yielding to
pedestrians, riding on the right side of the road,
using a headlight — it all matters."
Two pilot courses of the program were held
over the summer as "test runs," one in July and
one in August, involving a total of roughly two
dozen participants. James and Scott collected
feedback at the end of each course and said re
sponses were unequivocally positive.
"One hundred percent of our participants
said they learned something new." Scott said,
"and one hundred percent said they would rec
ommend the course to friends."
James added that one professor who attend
ed the presentation went so far as to say it was
worth getting the bicycling ticket because the in
formation received during the presentation was
so valuable.

The program — made possible through a
negotiated agreement with the local courts and
district attorney's office — allows a violator to
attend only one safety presentation course as a
means of vacating a fine. A second offense must
be dealt with through the traditional legal sys
tem.
"We see this program as an investment in the
level of safety on campus." Scott said. "The im
plementation of this program is really nothing
more than the fulfillment of our mandate to in
crease safety and well-being in whatever way we
can."
Attendance at the meetings is free and open
to everyone.Those who wish to vacate fines for
tickets they receive must bring their citations
with them.The Parking and Transportation Ser
vices building is located at 340 Bonair Siding
Road.
