# STUDENT LIFE
## New Web site provides valuable mental, sexual health resources Site also lists professional, peer support contacts 
### LAURA RUMPF SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
"Asking for help is the first, and most
powerful step." reads the new ASSU mental
and sexual health survival guide. "You can
do it, you will succeed."
The site, http://mentalhealth.stanford.edu/.
was designed last spring by ASSU Senator
Patrick Cordova '09 and Alex Bandza "OS as
a CSIOS final project. It has now morphed
into a permanent, comprehensive resource

for students seeking support for all mental
and sexual health concerns.
According to Cordova,"The ASSU [site]
is part of a larger project of reshaping stu
dent mental and sexual health on campus,"
with goals including "continued resource de
velopment, de-stigmatization of mental
health care, and a spirit of peer support for
friends in need."
The site contains resources and defini
tions of common mental and sexual health
concerns, lists professional and peer support
contacts, and lists opportunities for involve
ment in a number of student health organi
zations on campus. Such organizations in
clude Men against Violence. The Bridge
Peer Counseling Center and Safe and Open

Spaces.
"As a senior, 1 hadn't heard of half the re
sources we compiled." said Bandza, who has
since graduated and lives in D.C. "There are
so many [mental health J resources out there,
but it can be daunting if you're not connect
ed with the groups available."
"Our ultimate goal." he continued, "was
to make the site as digestible as possible, so
that in a few clicks, you could find what you
wanted."
Cordova emphasized the openness of the
Web site.
"We expect that incoming frosh. deluged
by the honeymoon of Stanford's fall quarter,
will not be our biggest customers," he said.
"Yet at the same time, new frosh should be

aware that individuals are ready to be of
help to them as soon as they arrive on cam
pus."
In addition to those seeking direct sup
port, Cordova and Bandza noted that peers
looking to help a friend could find the site
useful as well.
"A referral to care by a friend offers a
powerful message of support and confi
dence," Cordova said. "Iliis Web site will
provide individuals with the information
they need to make a difference in the lives of
others."
One student who informally reviewed the
site agreed with Bandza and Cordova that a
comprehensive mental health site was
much-needed, but offered some criticism of

the site's design as it stands.
"I'm totally glad that someone created
this site," said the senior, who requested
anonymity. "But if I wanted to go to the site
because I was depressed or whatever, I feel
like 1 would have to weave through the site
to find the info that I need."
"I wish there was something that was like
"Feeling depressed? Click here!' or some
thing to that effect," he added.
Comments and feedback about the new
site can be submitted directly to the Web
masters online at http://mentalhealth.stan
ford.edu/.
