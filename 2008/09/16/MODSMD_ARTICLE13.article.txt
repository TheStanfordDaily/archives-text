## Univ. billed for carbon offset Maryland professor charges for carbon footprint of travel 
### AN LE NGUYEN 
In a novel example of initiating
big change through small actions,
guest lecturer Ben Shneiderman
provoked a lively debate in the ac
ademic world bv charging Stan
ford University a small fee for the
carbon footprint of his travels.
Shneiderman, a professor of
computer science at the University
of Maryland at College Park, said
he was pleased to serve as the 2(X)8
Symbolic Systems Distinguished
Speaker this past spring. Troubled
by the environmental impact of his
cross-country flight to the Farm,
however. Shneiderman included an
$11.33 donation to the Carbon
fund.org Foundation in his reim
bursement receipts to Stanford's
Symbolic Systems Lab.
"I did pay the money upfront
and then I submitted the bill with
my travel expenses, making the
point that the full cost of my travel
should include the carbon offset."
Shneiderman said.
He said he chose the Carbon
fund.org Foundation because it
strives to lower carbon emissions
and reduce the cost of clean ener
gy through a variety of carbon off
set projects. The Maryland-based
non-profit provides detailed de
scriptions of its investments in re
newable energy, energy efficiency

and reforestation.
Shar m i I a
Mani, Linguistics
Department fi
nancial manage
ment analyst, said
that while the car
bon offset receipt
was not officially
included in the re
i m burse men ts,
the University did
credit Shneider
man with enough
money to cover
the cost of the car
bon donation.

The action suggests then that
honoring the carbon offset ex
penses of professors and guest lec
turers may not become a custom
ary University policy.
"1 realize that this is a contro
versial issue and some people may
disagree with the idea, and there
are still those who don't believe
that there are carbon emissions
problems or that there is global
warming," Shneiderman said."But
I would say that the evidence is
overwhelming and that it is impor
tant for everyone to take whatever
action they can to reduce their car
bon emissions and reduce energy
consumption."
Shneiderman hopes to set two
precedents with his donation to

the Carbonfund.org Foundation.
First, he hopes other professors
will submit similar carbon offset
requests for their travels, and sec
ond. he would like to see universi
ties and corporations willingly pay
for these expenses as part of the
transition to higher sustainability
levels.
"There is going to be not just
one solution to this energy prob
lem. but it's going to be a thousand
adjustments that will change the
way every one of our processes,
from education and healthcare,
and from entertainment and
tourism," Shneiderman said. "All
of them are going to be changed."
