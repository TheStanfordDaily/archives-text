## City food pantries busier than ever Rising food prices plague low-income citizens

SAN FRANCISCO, Calif. —
Food pantry operators don't com
plain of lack of food or donations to
give out. Rather, with more working
class people in their lines and food
prices on the rise, "We anticipate a
disaster." said Chaplain Earl Rogers,
head of S.F. Rescue Mission food
pantry in San Francisco.
The elderly and disabled living on
Social Security, veterans and those
with low-income jobs are the usual
attendees to the San Francisco Food
Bank's network of 188 food pantries.
Now workers are swelling those lines.
Reverend Nina Pickerell. who op
erates the Bayview Hunters Point
food pantry out of her home, calcu
lates that three weeks ago she served
about 290 families. This week, it will
be close to 366.
"Almost all the new people have
jobs." said Bayview-Hunters Point
volunteer Rick Cornelius, who
checks the ID of every person in line.
"There were about five people from
the Fire Department in line, and two
police officers."
Every Friday, 65-year old Estelle.a
retired postal service employee, col
lects the groceries she will use to feed
her two young granddaughters at the
Korean American Senior Communi
ty Center in Western Addition.
"Still, in spite of the retirement, as
high as [the price of] food is, it just
isn't enough," she said. "As much as
you try to do it, it's just not enough."
Estelle says that food pantries
help her most for bread, since her
kids take bread to school.
Even in the San Francisco Bay
Area, in the heart of agricultural val
leys. working people are relying on
charity institutions to keep fed. Ac
cording to Ross Fraser, spokesperson
at Second Harvest, the nation's na

tional network of food banks, the
problem is increased demand.
"The real problem is not that do
nations are down, but that demand is
up — precipitously," Fraser said. "We
hear again and again that food
pantries are seeing people they've
never seen before, especially a lot
more working people."
But donations are down. Accord
ing to Marguerite Nowak of the San
Francisco Food Bank. "Donations
from the Federal Government
through the Department of Agricul
ture, such as beans, rice, and other ba
sics and commodity foods, have
dropped off five to six percent in re
cent years."
At the Korean American Senior
Community Center, the line for pro
duce includes senior citizens, veter
ans. immigrant families and disabled,
and extends down the block and
around the corner. Six months ago,
the center fed 230 people at most,and
now feeds over 300.
Just down the street, at the First
Friendship Institutional Baptist
Church.people file in line, waiting for
bananas, oranges, vegetables, juices
and other foods. Four months ago,the
church saw MO people coming for
food per week, and now sees over
100.
Chaplain Earl Rogers, who runs
the S.F. Rescue Mission pantry in
the downtown Tenderloin district,
used to see 10-15 people per week,
hut now sees 45. including more
working people. He knows this be
cause they have to tell someone to
get food in their name while they
are at work.
The people who come to the food
pantries are not homeless. Many
pantries require ID so that they can
be sure they are serving those within
their zip code. Most people have dri
ver's licenses with proof of residence.
As food prices soar, the margin of
security for many becomes more pre
carious. According to Nowak. food
costs for the Food Bank have risen
overall by 25 to 30 percent over the
last year.
"We can no longer purchase pow

dered milk,"she said."A case cost $32
last year; this year the cost is $63."
Even those that are on govern
mental welfare programs depend on
free food at food pantries. Monica
Visini signed up for her monthly gro
ceries at S.F Rescue Mission in the
Tenderloin. She is 35 years old and
has received Social Security disability
income since 2002, when she had to
stop working as a 911 dispatcher be
cause of her chronic migraines. Her
rent, even in the cheapest single-oc
cupant housing project in the cheap
est neighborhood in town, is more
than half or her income.
William Walker has the same
need. TTie 45-year-old HIV patient
gets $200 per month through the dis
abled general assistance of Social Se
curity. and he has come to the food
pantry occasionally for the last six
years.
"After rent, there's not much
cash." said Walker, who also lives in
economical quarters.
A veteran named Ben is 55 years
old and says his pension of $357 per
month for disability is not enough to
cover his food.
At the Hay view-Hunters Point
food pantry, foster parent Alexis
Alexander bounces an infant on her
lap
"Today, we have no food," she
uiid. "And if it weren't for the food
pantry, we would not be eating."
Foster parents receive $750 per
child per month, according to Pick
erel!.
'['racy Hill has worked across the
bay as a part-time construction work
er for seven years and is looking for
full time work. 1 le waits in line for his
food and shrugs, noting that "the
economy is rough."
Cornelius worried about his own
future.
"I'm a volunteer here," he said,
"but I'm stocking up on corn in my
own freezer, with the prices going up
and up. You wonder soon enough
when I'll have to be in that line."
