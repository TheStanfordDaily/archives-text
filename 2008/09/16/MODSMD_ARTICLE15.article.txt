## Training equips RAs for year's challenges Staff members GET EXCITED 
### EMMA TROTTER MANAGING EDITOR 
For Resident Assistants (RAs) in freshman dorms, today is
the big day. After two weeks of intense training, touching
on scenarios dealing with everything from body image
and mental health to violence and intolerance, RAs will fi
nally welcome freshmen into their dorms.They're excited
— but also a little scared.
"We've been training so long for the freshmen to get here!"said
James Barton '09, a first-year RA in Roble Hall."l'm excited to get
to know them beyond these faceless residents we've been talking
about for the past few weeks. I'm excited to help them start Stan
ford."
Tempering his excitement, however, is nervousness about the
challenges of the year to come.
"My worst nightmare would be that somebody commits suicide
or dies from alcohol poisoning that could have been prevented,
and it was my fault that it wasn't [prevented]," Barton said. "The
hardest thing will be separating myself from my residents' success
es and failures. You have to not get bogged down in it."
Barton is also worried about residents not seeking him out for
advice or simple conversation.
"What if Em just not welcoming, for whatever reason, and they
just don't come to me?" he said.
But Barton and all other RAs have the full confidence of Josh
Schiller, associate director of Residential Education, who is re
sponsible for RA training sessions. According to him. the overall
goal of RA training is to provide RAs with specific skills and re
sources to deal with any emergency situation that may arise.
"Most of the time. RAs need to know who to contact in case of
an emergency — it is important that emergencies get referred to
trained professionals as soon as possible," he wrote in an email to
The Daily. "The majority of the RA work is done through educa
tion and responding to low risk situations directly. Our combina
tion of skills building and awareness building make it possible for
RAs to know what to look for and how to respond at different risk
levels."
Schiller described four main goals of training.
" The first is to teach RAs the interpersonal skills they will need
when working with their residents throughout the year [such as]
listening skills [and] conflict mediation," he wrote. "The second is
to build awareness on specific topics such as body image [and]
identity development. Hie third goal is to teach RAs how to re
spond to emergencies of any type. And finally, the fourth main goal
is to familiarize RAs with the resources that are available to them
on campus."
Schiller doesn't just stand at a podium and lecture RAs about
these topics — RAs participate in hours of scenarios designed to
prepare them to handle just about anything.
"We will use common situations as training tools while giving
