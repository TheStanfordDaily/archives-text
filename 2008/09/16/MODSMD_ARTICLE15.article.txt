## Training equips RAs for year's challenges Staff members GET EXCITED 
### EMMA TROTTER MANAGING EDITOR 
For Resident Assistants (RAs) in freshman dorms, today is
the big day. After two weeks of intense training, touching
on scenarios dealing with everything from body image
and mental health to violence and intolerance, RAs will fi
nally welcome freshmen into their dorms.They're excited
— but also a little scared.
"We've been training so long for the freshmen to get here!"said
James Barton '09, a first-year RA in Roble Hall."l'm excited to get
to know them beyond these faceless residents we've been talking
about for the past few weeks. I'm excited to help them start Stan
ford."
Tempering his excitement, however, is nervousness about the
challenges of the year to come.
"My worst nightmare would be that somebody commits suicide
or dies from alcohol poisoning that could have been prevented,
and it was my fault that it wasn't [prevented]," Barton said. "The
hardest thing will be separating myself from my residents' success
es and failures. You have to not get bogged down in it."
Barton is also worried about residents not seeking him out for
advice or simple conversation.
"What if Em just not welcoming, for whatever reason, and they
just don't come to me?" he said.
But Barton and all other RAs have the full confidence of Josh
Schiller, associate director of Residential Education, who is re
sponsible for RA training sessions. According to him. the overall
goal of RA training is to provide RAs with specific skills and re
sources to deal with any emergency situation that may arise.
"Most of the time. RAs need to know who to contact in case of
an emergency — it is important that emergencies get referred to
trained professionals as soon as possible," he wrote in an email to
The Daily. "The majority of the RA work is done through educa
tion and responding to low risk situations directly. Our combina
tion of skills building and awareness building make it possible for
RAs to know what to look for and how to respond at different risk
levels."
Schiller described four main goals of training.
" The first is to teach RAs the interpersonal skills they will need
when working with their residents throughout the year [such as]
listening skills [and] conflict mediation," he wrote. "The second is
to build awareness on specific topics such as body image [and]
identity development. Hie third goal is to teach RAs how to re
spond to emergencies of any type. And finally, the fourth main goal
is to familiarize RAs with the resources that are available to them
on campus."
Schiller doesn't just stand at a podium and lecture RAs about
these topics — RAs participate in hours of scenarios designed to
prepare them to handle just about anything.
"We will use common situations as training tools while giving

skills in an environment where there
are no ramifications for making mis

she did going in.
"I feel really good and really pre

nitely lots of parts that are very
scary," she said. "It won't all he pup

One of Childs' biggest tears stems
from what she sees as a common
strength in RAs.
"A lot of the people that become
RAs like helping people and solving
problems, so being there in an emer

calm, do what you're supposed to do.

helping people don't like the idea of
problems that don't get solved."
Childs lived in Cardenal her fresh
man year and is looking forward to
providing freshmen with the same
welcoming atmosphere that existed
then.
"I knew that I wanted to RA here
basically from the first couple days I
got here," she said. "This dorm hasal

ways had a great sense of community
[and) I'm excit6ed about seeing the
freshmen build a community togeth
er and seeing how different they be
come from the beginning of the year
till the end."
Barton did not live in Roble his
freshman year, but instead chose the
dorm because he "really clicked with
the RFs [Resident Fellows]."
"I liked that it has a huge amount
of freshmen — Branner has 161 and
we have 160 — but still has the calm

ing presence of upperclassmen." he
added. "It's the best of both worlds."
Barton called the scenario train
ing "the most helpful."
"RA training prepares you for the
worst, but leads you to hope for the
best." he said. "There's some pretty
heavy stuff, [but] even as you didn't
think that you learned it.it sank in."
"Do I know what I'm going to do
in every situation?" he added. "No. I
guess you can't really train for that.
But the University offers a lot of sup

port and a huge amount of resources.
We're just like traffic cops — people
come in. and we redirect them to the
proper place."
This role allows Barton to show
people what the University has to
offer.
"I love Stanford so much." he said,
"and anything I can do to help other
people feel the same way as I do is
worth it to me."
