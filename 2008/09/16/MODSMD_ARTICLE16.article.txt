This is just one of the many games that the 162 Stanford
Pre-Orientation Trip (SPOT) participants — commonly
referred to as "spotletts" — play while on Roble Field the
day before they embark.The game serves as a mass intro
duction for the members of the incoming freshman class.
The rules for the spotletts are simple: Remember the
name, place of residence and favorite smell of the person
they last shook hands with, and relay that information to
the next hand shaker.
SPOT wasco founded by Sarah Rubinfeld. a graduate
student in civil and environmental engineering, and Sarah
Shulman '05 in 2(X)3.
"We wanted to design a program that would help new
students feel more comfortable with life on campus," Ru
binfeld said, "and to create an opportunity for those stu
dents to meet fellow classmates as well as upperclassmen
in a small, intimate setting without other distractions."
The first year SPOT was implemented, there were 30
participants — as the program was only open to transfer
students — and nine wilderness leaders. Over the last five
years, the program has grown dramatically and now boasts
162 participants and 57 wilderness leaders.This once-small
program, originally open only to transfer students, is now
available to every incoming Stanford freshman in the
United States.
The spotletts arrive one day before their departure into
the wilderness, and are divided into small groups. This year
there were IK groups, each with a distinct personality Each
spotlett spends a portion of that day meeting their future
classmates through games that are able to accommodate
every participant, but the majority of their pre-departure
time is dedicated to group bonding.
Each SPOT trip consists of no more than 12 individu
als, including the wilderness leaders, and every group has a

leader who has either been a spotlett himself or a leader
before.This intimacy provides a chance for the spotletts to
really get to know the group, to share their hopes and fears
with classmates, to verbalize what they wish to achieve
while at Stanford.They are given the opportunity to build
relationships that will last a lifetime.
Once the spotletts are placed into these groups, the real
adventure begins. Over the next five days, the spotletts,
along with the trained wilderness leaders, backpack
through the California mountains, building friendships,
trust and probably some muscle.
Andy Fields, the overseer of the SPOT program and
coordinator of outdoor education, is one of SPOT's most
enthusiastic advocates, and for good reason. I le has been
an integral part of SPOT's success, but he will be the first
to tell you that SPOT could not be what it is today without
dedicated volunteers.
"SPOT is based on students caring about their fellow
students." he said. "From leader training to the trips them
selves, SPOT is about passing on knowledge and helping
others grow and learn. It's amazing, it's phenomenal.This
whole infrastructure is students:The ideas come from stu

dents, which are executed by students."
"And the people win) benefit?" he added. "Those, of
course, are the students as well."
Relative to past years, there have been some key differ
ences in the way that SPOT was conducted in 2(H)«S. Ad
ministratively, there has been the addition of two full-time
summer coordinators who spend their year planning the
SPOT trips down to the last bag of trail mix. Iliey are able
to troubleshoot any foreseeable problems to ensure the
program runs smoothly. In addition, there were also dou
ble the amount of Orientation Volunteers — support staff
who spend the week before the spotletts arrive cleaning,
testing and packing gear for every participant and wilder
ness leader.
Finally, the Student Leader Training Program has been
greatly expanded, with three times as many leaders as last
year. This program provides an opportunity for students
with advanced medical training who have led SPOT trips
before to train and teach the new wilderness leaders.
"These seasoned wilderness leaders want to pass on
their experiences and help to develop leadership in other
students." Fields said. "'lTiis program has so many far

reaching effects. SPC) I happens year round, leader train
ing happens year round and these SP()T trips are where
everything culminates."
SPOT was also granted the use of Roble Field for the
pre-trip training of the wilderness leaders, instead of using
the dorms, which would effectively separate the leaders.
The leaders arrived several days before their spotletts and
all slept in tents on the field. ITiey lived together, ate to
gether and reviewed together, all before even tying the
laces of a single hiking boot.
According to past participants. SPOT can provide
more than just a pre-Orientation adventure. The spotletts
are challenged, both mentally and physically. They are
placed outside their comfort /.ones, with people they have
never met, in an environment that requires them to be
come reliant on those in their group.

"SPOI is conducive to team building, decision making
is heightened, you receive immediate feedback and those
same decisions affect more than just you." said Peter
Wright "OS. "It becomes necessary to constantly think of
the group."
"You goon the SPC) I trip to make some great friends,"
Wright added.
Hut the spotletts also gain the support of the trip lead
ers, who take on the role of a mentor. These leaders are
huge resources, both academic and social. While many
freshmen make most of their friends only in their dorms,
the spotletts have the opportunity to really expand their
social circle.
SPC)T has self-efficacy benefits as well.
"The freshmen are expected to hike at least five miles
a day, live in close quarters and work together as a team to
overcome whatever difficulties may arise, and this is em
powering for a lot of students," Wright said.
SPC) Fis more than just a clever acronym. It is a chance
for the incoming class of 2012 to become both individuals
and a part of something greater than themselves. And if
that bright-eyed boy happens to come across Sarah from
Pasadena, well, now at least he knows her favorite smell.
