# FTCs prep for frosh
## 
### MAGGIE SACHS 
Each year, the arrival of freshmen on campus is
marked by a ritualistic,perhaps over-the-top wel
come ceremony. Residences are ornamented
with balloons and signs. Staff members stand out
front, welcoming each person by name over a
loudspeaker. Eager welcomers also thrust a large packet of
compiled reference materials,a room key,an ID card.a P.O.
box key and a dorm T-shirt on each new student.
In all the hustle and bustle, it's easy to forget just how
much time and effort was involved to put on such a show.
Yesterday, this campus was almost bare.Today, it's as if lit
tle elves have built a paradise overnight — thanks to the
hard work and dedication of a core group of people.
Ibis year, eight students were given the task of smooth
ing the transition of the incoming Stanford students. Last
year, the students were called by several different names.
This year, they're Freshmen Transition Coordinators
(FTC s).
ITie change comes from Koren Bakkegard, Assistant
Dean of Freshmen and Director of New Student Programs.
Bakkegard oversaw Orientation in autumn of 2(X)7. and
she has since played a role in redesigning and redistributing
the job responsibilities surrounding NSC).
Last year, there was a core group of five "orientation co
ordinators" who dealt solely with the logistics of orienta
tion. with a student in charge of Approaching Stanford
forms and a student in charge of peer mentors and HPACs.
Now, the job description is a little less specific, and has been
revamped for added efficiency. All of the responsibilities
listed above, plus the added job of helping to determine ad
visor matches for new students, now fall under one title
FTC
Iliough Bakkegard adamantly points out that what
takes place during New Student CJrientation (NSO) is the
result of a campus-wide collaborative effort, she is quick to
acknowledge that she and the FTC's make-up what she
refers to as "the nerve center" for these activities, or "the
hub of the wheel."
"We are like air-traffic control." she added.
Tliis planning and organizing begins much earlier than
manv realize. In winter.administrators review the vear be

fore, assessing what went well and what didn't. ITiis
process of reflection and planning continues through the
spring, and at this point the FTCs become involved in the
process.
Throughout the summer,each FTC takes on an individ
ual project, ranging from designing T-shirts to working out
the logistical aspects of NSO. such as the number of bal
loons needed to decorate the entire campus.
Ben Lauing' 11 used the bulk of his summer as an FTC
to design the Stanford Facebook, the wall calendar and T
shirts specific to each NSO job. Because he has completed
these projects, he is now involved in the organization and
logistics of NSO.
To Lauing.when it comes to a smooth transition. NSO is
the proverbial icing on the cake.The Approaching Stanford
forms that are mailed to each incoming student throughout
the summer are an integral part of this transition and strive
to make those students feel prepared to manage the year
ahead.
Lauing took the job because he wanted to ease the com
mon "anxiety and nerves surrounding what was going to
happen upon arriving at Stanford." he said. Failing's recent
personal experience as a freshman in this transitional peri
od showed him that it is "important [for new students] to
have a hand to help them through the difficulties of this psy
chological shift."
About a week before NSO. a day in the life of an FI'C
starts around eight in the morning, and goes until around
midnight. Though they have the extra help of a volunteer
core comprised of about 350 students, including HPACs
and I !OVs,the FTCs don't seem to ever stop working.
When we get to September, it's crunch time — all hands
on deck, all the time, everyone is [working] at full tilt."
Bakkegard said.
In this final push to NSC), the volunteers work alongside
the FTCs, stuffing red bookstore bags with the materials
each student will acquire upon check-in. The next link in
this chain is collating materials such as buttons and calen
dars, and distributing these, along with the red bags, all over
campus.The FTCs and volunteers zip around campus, mak
ing sure the necessary supplies reach their final destina

tions. I"heir "licet of golf-carts," as Bakkegard calls it. can
create quite a whirling dervish.
Bakkegard attempted to explain the seemingly magical
transformation that occurs on campus the day before NSO.
"Tuesday we start at six in the morning, getting all the
balloons and welcome tables set up," she said. But it seems
that the rest of the NSO experience has been slowly pre
pared in the prior months, like an arrow drawn back slowly
and surely by a bow, ready to burst outward with energy:or
a passionate performer, waiting to break out from the

wings. It's not magic at all — it's the result of very meticu
lous planning and a lot of heart.
From the initial TUesday morning of NSO. to the follow
ing Monday night, the idea is that the various NSO events
will ease students into their new lifestyles. It is not until the
final curtain has gone down at the O-Show on Monday
Night that Bakkegard and the FTC's can breathe a sigh of
relief.
