# Senator eases pressure on endowment spending
## Grassley compliments Stanford on recent aid increase, but does not rule out writing legislation 
### DEVIN BANERJEE MANAGING EDITOR 
At $17.2 billion, Stanford's endowment has been in
the limelight since a powerful duo of U.S. senators
began unearthing financial details of wealthy universi
ties earlier this year. Of recent interest to Congress has
been whether or not colleges should be forced to
spend more of their endowments, but a roundtable dis
cussion on Capitol Hill last week appears to have
turned down the heat on the universities, shifting the
topic away from legislation.
Sen. Chuck Grassley (RTA), along with Sen. Max

Baucus '63, J.D. '67 (D-MT) began the investigation in
January with a letter to 136 institutions — each with an
endowment of at least $500 million — requesting de
tails of endowment spending, financial aid policies and
tuition changes over the past decade.
But Grassley, who has repeatedly indicated he
would like to write legislation mandating that the
wealthiest universities spend at least five percent of
their endowments each year — as is the case for pri

week's roundtable, instead pressing college leaders to
"self correct" the disparities between endowment in
come and payout.

"We'd like to encourage you folks to look inward
and correct what can be corrected," Grassley told the
two dozen college presidents and representatives at
the discussion, according to The New York Times. The
Capitol Hill discussion was convened by Grassley and
Rep. Peter Welch (D-VT).
In a phone interview with The Daily last week.
Grassley, who serves as the ranking member of the
Senate Finance Committee, said his comment was a
compliment to university leaders.
"By saying that. I was really saying a compliment,"
said the lowa senator, who said many non-profit or
ganizations "self corrected" after he planned to

rewrite mandatory payout legislation a few years back.
Grassley also specifically noted the large steps
Stanford has taken to increase financial aid to students
of lower- and middle-income families.
"My perception is that Stanford has gone further
than any other universities," the senator said, mention
ing he may be biased because he recently met with
University President John Hennessy.
Stanford's Office of Financial Aid announced in
February that families earning under $100,000 each
year will not be expected to pay tuition, and families
