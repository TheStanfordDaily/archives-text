# Senator eases pressure on endowment spending
## Grassley compliments Stanford on recent aid increase, but does not rule out writing legislation 
### DEVIN BANERJEE MANAGING EDITOR 
At $17.2 billion, Stanford's endowment has been in
the limelight since a powerful duo of U.S. senators
began unearthing financial details of wealthy universi
ties earlier this year. Of recent interest to Congress has
been whether or not colleges should be forced to
spend more of their endowments, but a roundtable dis
cussion on Capitol Hill last week appears to have
turned down the heat on the universities, shifting the
topic away from legislation.
Sen. Chuck Grassley (RTA), along with Sen. Max

Baucus '63, J.D. '67 (D-MT) began the investigation in
January with a letter to 136 institutions — each with an
endowment of at least $500 million — requesting de
tails of endowment spending, financial aid policies and
tuition changes over the past decade.
But Grassley, who has repeatedly indicated he
would like to write legislation mandating that the
wealthiest universities spend at least five percent of
their endowments each year — as is the case for pri
vate foundations — backed away slightly at last
week's roundtable, instead pressing college leaders to
"self correct" the disparities between endowment in
come and payout.

"We'd like to encourage you folks to look inward
and correct what can be corrected," Grassley told the
two dozen college presidents and representatives at
the discussion, according to The New York Times. The
Capitol Hill discussion was convened by Grassley and
Rep. Peter Welch (D-VT).
In a phone interview with The Daily last week.
Grassley, who serves as the ranking member of the
Senate Finance Committee, said his comment was a
compliment to university leaders.
"By saying that. I was really saying a compliment,"
said the lowa senator, who said many non-profit or
ganizations "self corrected" after he planned to

rewrite mandatory payout legislation a few years back.
Grassley also specifically noted the large steps
Stanford has taken to increase financial aid to students
of lower- and middle-income families.
"My perception is that Stanford has gone further
than any other universities," the senator said, mention
ing he may be biased because he recently met with
University President John Hennessy.
Stanford's Office of Financial Aid announced in
February that families earning under $100,000 each
year will not be expected to pay tuition, and families
earning under $60,000 each year
will not be expected to pay tuition,
room, board or fees.
Still. Grassley has also emphat
ically said he will not preclude the
possibility of legislation, especially
since only a handful of institutions
— Stanford, Harvard, Princeton
and Yale among them — have
channeled more money toward
student aid.
"Universities are moving in this
direction," he said, "but don't for
get there are 13ft universities with
[endowments of] more than $500
million.There's really only a dozen
or so that have taken big steps."
"I don't promise anyone that
we won't legislate," Grassley
added."l'm not the only person on
Capitol Hill [involved in the dis
cussion), so we may consider it."
On the topic of possible legisla
tion. many university leaders have
defended the rising costs of tuition
and spoken out against mandatory
endowment payouts.
In her remarks at last week's
discussion. Princeton University
President Shirley Tilghman
stressed the differences in finan
cial structure between private
foundations and higher-education
institutions.
"Private foundations for the
most part make grants, and if nec
essary they can scale back their
grant making in lean years." Tilgh
man said. "Colleges and universi
ties do not have the same flexibili
ty to respond to market volatility
because we need to make long
term commitments in hiring facul
ty, creating programs and con
structing facilities."
Michael klausner. Stanford
professor of both business and law,
attended last week's roundtable
and told The Daily that Congres
sional regulation of payout rates
would not only encounter many
difficulties, but would also be inef
fective. Some complexities Klaus
ner raised include gifts to the Uni
versity that are restricted to specif
ic purposes, heterogeneity across
universities and the likeliness that
mandatory payouts would con
tribute more to faculty and re
search than to tuition relief.
Stanford Chief Financial Offi
cer and Vice President for Busi
ness Affairs Randy Livingston em
phasized in an email to The Daily
the vulnerability of the Universi
ty's endowment to market fluctua-"
tions. According to Livingston, be
cause the endowment supports
close to one quarter of Stanford's
operating budget, "we are quite
vulnerable to market fluctua
tions."
"If we have a sustained period
of poor returns, it could have neg
ative implications for our fi
nances," the CFO said.
Referencing the bear market in
investments between 1966 and
19N2, Livingston said high infla
tion and sluggish markets can cut
endowment payout by as much as
50 percent, and thus leads to "nat
ural and appropriate conser
vatism" from University leader
ship and trustees.
"When we commit to new levels
of financial aid or hire a new facul
ty member," he said, "we do so
with the intention of sustaining
this commitment irrespective of
fluctuations in endowment value
of payout."
Still. Grassley said returns on
investments at the nation's wealth
iest colleges are outpacing payouts
at too high a rate.
"When you consider a five-year
average of maybe 15-percent re
turns. and they're paying out small
returns, there's a great deal of in
come that they have," the senator
said generally of many universi
ties.
Grassley also said that although
many endowments are composed
mainly of restricted donations,
wiggle room still exists. Although
less than 25 percent of the Stan
ford endowment is unrestricted,
Grassley said he still wonders why
the University cannot spend one
more percent —or $172 million
— on student aid.
But college leaders continue to
push back.
"The policies that American in
stitutions of higher education have
adopted over many years have
made our system of higher educa
tion the envy of the world." Tilgh
man said in her statement at last
week's discussion. "I do not be
lieve that government-mandated
spending policies would serve
these institutions, their students or
the country well, especially at a
time when our country is more de
pendent than ever on its colleges
and universities to provide the
ideas and prepare the leaders who
will sustain our global competi
tiveness."
Harvard's endowment of $36.9
billion is currently the nation's
largest, followed by Yale's ol $22.5
billion. Stanford's of $17.2 billion
and Princeton's of $15.K billion.

mandatory payouts would con
tribute more to faculty and re
search than to tuition relief.
Stanford Chief Financial Offi
cer and Vice President for Busi
ness Affairs Randy Livingston em
phasized in an email to The Daily
the vulnerability of the Universi
ty's endowment to market fluctua-"
tions. According to Livingston, be
cause the endowment supports
close to one quarter of Stanford's
operating budget, "we are quite
vulnerable to market fluctua
tions."
"If we have a sustained period
of poor returns, it could have neg
ative implications for our fi
nances," the CFO said.
Referencing the bear market in
investments between 1966 and
19N2, Livingston said high infla
tion and sluggish markets can cut
endowment payout by as much as
50 percent, and thus leads to "nat
ural and appropriate conser
vatism" from University leader
ship and trustees.
"When we commit to new levels
of financial aid or hire a new facul
ty member," he said, "we do so
with the intention of sustaining
this commitment irrespective of
fluctuations in endowment value
of payout."
Still. Grassley said returns on
investments at the nation's wealth
iest colleges are outpacing payouts
at too high a rate.
"When you consider a five-year
average of maybe 15-percent re
turns. and they're paying out small
returns, there's a great deal of in
come that they have," the senator
said generally of many universi
ties.
Grassley also said that although
many endowments are composed
mainly of restricted donations,
wiggle room still exists. Although
less than 25 percent of the Stan
ford endowment is unrestricted,
Grassley said he still wonders why
the University cannot spend one
more percent —or $172 million
— on student aid.
But college leaders continue to
push back.
"The policies that American in
stitutions of higher education have
adopted over many years have
made our system of higher educa
tion the envy of the world." Tilgh
man said in her statement at last
week's discussion. "I do not be
lieve that government-mandated
spending policies would serve
these institutions, their students or
the country well, especially at a
time when our country is more de
pendent than ever on its colleges
and universities to provide the
ideas and prepare the leaders who
will sustain our global competi
tiveness."
Harvard's endowment of $36.9
billion is currently the nation's
largest, followed by Yale's ol $22.5
billion. Stanford's of $17.2 billion
and Princeton's of $15.K billion.
