# TCU TOPPLES CARDINAL
## Horned Frogs triumph, 31-14, in wake of Hurricane Ike 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
Stanford kept pace with TCU for three quarters on
Saturday, but despite excellent scoring chances could not
complete its comeback against the Horned Frogs. The
Cardinal was downed 31-14 in a rainy game in the wake
of Hurricane Ike at Anion G. Carter Stadium in Fort
Worth. Tex.
The game was closer than the score would make it
seem:The two teams were tied at the half, and TCU only
led 21-14 at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
Less than two minutes into the final quarter, the
Horned Frogs were forced to punt from their own three
yard line. Sophomore punt returner Doug Baldwin field
ed the kick at the TCU 48, and sprinted up the sideline for
what appeared to be the game-tying touchdown. Howev
er. upon review, the officials ruled that Baldwin had
stepped out of bounds at the 13-yard line, negating the
touchdown.
Still. Stanford was set up in the red /one with a chance
to tie the game. But on third-and-nine from the 12-yard
line, junior quarterback Tavita Pritchard was intercepted
by TCU safety Steven Coleman on a pass to the end zone
intended for sophomore receiver Ryan Whalen.
Following the game. Pritchard harped back on one of
his priorities for 20()8: red zone production.
"We have to get in the end zone,"he told the San Fran
cisco Chronicle. "You get the ball that far down, you've
definitely got to get points. I can't throw that pick."
"The overturned call, saying he stepped out, and then
the interception in the end zone, gave us momentum."
TCU quarterback Andy Dalton told Scout.com. "1
thought that was the big turning point in the game."
It was a wasted scoring opportunity, and may have
kept the contest in TCU's favor, but it was by no means a
fatal blow. The Horned Frogs were forced to punt just
two-and-a-half minutes later, giving Stanford the ball
back with 12 minutes to play.
But junior running back Toby Gerhart was stopped
for no gain on fourth-and-one at the Cardinal 42-yard
line. The stop led to a TCU field goal to make it a two
score game, and Stanford never threatened after that. A
late fumble by Pritchard deep in Cardinal territory al
lowed the Horned Frogs to ice the game with a final
touchdown.
For Stanford, it was a display of offensive ineptitude
— the Cardinal finished with only 193 total yards. Ger
hart. who had a career day against Oregon State in the
season opener and had a decent outing against Arizona
State last week, averaged just three yards a carry. Howev
er. at 42 yards, he was Stanford's leading receiver, as
Pritchard amassed only 122 yards through the air.
"Not enough offense, that's for sure," coach Jim Har
baugh told the Chronicle. "1 didn't think our plan was
good."
""We didn't play Stanford offense," Baldwin told the
San Jose Mercury News. "Offense just couldn't come
through."
It was a game of catch up for the Cardinal, as TCU
jumped out to an early 14-0 lead on a pair of short touch
down runs. But Stanford did not relent and scored twice
in the second quarter to tie the game before halftime.
The Cardinal's lone offensive touchdown came on an
end-around to Baldwin, who had a nifty 38-yard run to
the end zone rife with jukes and spins that made defend
er after defender miss. On the I lorned Frogs' next posses
sion. Stanford junior cornerback Mark Mueller blocked
a punt that was in turn scooped up by junior receiver
Richard Sherman and taken to the house for six.The sub
sequent extra point tied the game.
But midway through the third quarter. TCU scored

again on a short touchdown run. giving them a lead they
would not relinquish.
Despite the final score, the Stanford defense played
well. The Horned Frogs' longest play of the day went for
just 19 yards, and only two of the fiveTCU scoring drives
started in Horned Frog territory The other three began
on the Cardinal's 42,34 and 13-yard lines,givingTCU ex
cellent field position.
Linebacker Nick Macaluso made his 2008 debut with
nine tackles, two of which were for a loss. Safety Sean
Wiser, playing in his first collegiate game, had 11 tackles.
Along with senior linebacker Pat Maynor. he led the
team in that category.
The defensive unit was. for the most part,able to stifle

the TCU attack, forcing nine punts on the day.
"Defense played a hell of a game." Baldwin told the
Mercury News. "They gave us many chances. [The] spe
cial teams [also] played awesome — they gave us so
many chances [too]."
Stanford, and particularly its offensive unit, must now
regroup before hosting San Jose State on Saturday. The
Cardinal is favored in the matchup and needs a win to
even out its record.
"We're only three games in on this thing." Ilarbaugh
told the Mercury News. "We've got to find ways to get
better."

JEFF KEACHER/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore Sione Fuo's sack against Oregon State is just the kind of play the Cardinal needs to vault itself into a hunt
for its first bowl game since 2001.. The Stanford defense has recorded just four sacks and four turnovers through the
first three games of the '08 season, statistics that will have to multiply greatly for Stanford to succeed in a tough Pac-10.
