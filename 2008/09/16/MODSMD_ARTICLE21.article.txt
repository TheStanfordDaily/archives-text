# Big plays key to Cardinal hopes in '08
## 
### JACK SALISBURY DESK EDITOR 
On paper,TCU crushed Stanford this past week
end.
Ilie Horned Frogs literally doubled Stanford's
production on offense. They had twice as many total
yards as the Cardinal (378 to 193), had possession for
nearly twice as long (39:29 to 20:31) and didn't turn
the ball over once (Stanford had three turnovers).
TCU's sophomore quarterback Andrew Dalton
looked efficient running the option, and the Horned
Frogs dominated the trenches up front, as Stanford
had little success in short-yardage situations. Even
TCU's Justin Watts, a 5-foot-10, 185-pound running
back bulldozed Stanford senior linebacker Pay
Maynor, symbolic of the Horned Frogs' dominance
on the day.
The final score of 31-14 belied the actual How of
the game, though: The Cardinal hung with TCU until
a few late scores. The game was tied throughout the
third quarter and even seemed to be tied for a split
second in the fourth, when sophomore Doug Bald
win's punt return for a touchdown was overturned
after it was ruled that he stepped out of bounds. How
did the game remain so close?
Simply put. the Cardinal was opportunistic. Both
of its scores came on big plays as opposed to long, sus
tained drives; junior receiver Richard Sherman's
touchdown on a blocked punt by Mark Mueller and
Baldwin's touchdown on a reverse were indicative of
the kind of team that had the speed and wherewithal
to make the big plays, but perhaps not the stamina to
sustain their impact.
They didn't buy Stanford a win against a solid TCTJ
team, but big plays kept the team in the game. And if
Stanford is going to see any improvement from Jim
Harbaugh's first season, it'll need to make the same
kind of plays throughout future contests, and make
them more often.
Whether it's blocking a punt, calling a reverse at
just the right time or forcing a fumble, it's become
clear that Stanford will need big. momentum turning,
game-changing plays to succeed this year. Of course,
that could be said for most teams, but the Cardinal is
only going to beat a few teams on its schedule straight
up. That's not to say that this team is bad, but it has
more road games than home games, and it's going to
be an uphill battle no matter what in the very tough
Pac-10.
The opening victory over Oregon State, 36-28. was
prototypical of how Stanford is going to win games
this season. It featured a 46-yard touchdown from jun
ior running back Toby Gerhart, a pick-six from junior
safety Bo McNally and a goal-line fumble from the
opposing Beavers in the final minute. Even though
the Beavers outgained Stanford and came into the
game as the clear favorite, it was the Cardinal who
came out on top.
"You don't necessarily like winning that way" Mc-
Nally told the Associated Press after the game."But,a
win's a win."
McNally is right. And if the 1-2 Cardinal is going to
stay afloat in a highly competitive conference, it just
might be necessary for them to win "that way." like it
or not.
