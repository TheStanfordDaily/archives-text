# Surviving the Spartans
## Stanford looks to climb bock to .500 in second annual Bill Walsh Legacy Game 
### DENIS GRIFFIN MANAGING EDITOR 
A year ago. the Cardinal's 37-0 romp
over San Jose State was the team's first
home victory at the new Stanford Stadium
ending a six-game streak of futility at the
rebuilt venue that spanned two years. Iliis
year. Stanford will be looking for another
streak-snapping victory over the Spartans,
as the Cardinal looks to even its record at 2-
2 and win for the first time in three weeks
this Saturday.
After opening the season with a down
to-the-wire 36-28 Pac-1() Conference victo
ry at home over Oregon State, Stanford fell
upon hard times on Ihe road, falling 41-17 in
Tempe against Arizona State and 31-14 in
Fort Worth against TCU. And so.a year after
last season's highlight-reel win.Stanford will
look toget back on track at home against the
Spai urns once again.
The key to the Cardinal's victory over
San Jose State last season also proved to be
its undoing for much of the rest of the sea
son. Then-sophomore running back Toby
Gerhart rushed 12 times for a stunning 140
yards, utilizing his typically bruising, north
south style to gain plenty of yards after con
tact.
But a knee injury suffered late in the
game ultimately sidelined Gerhart for the
remainder of the season.lhe loss of Gerhart
was the first of several to Cardinal backs that
left the squad's ground game on life-support
for the remainder of the 2007 season.
In 2008. Gerhart has picked up where he
left off. emerging as a cornerstone player in
Stanford's offense.Through ihe team's first
three games, Gerhart has carried the ball 50
times for 259 yards — nearly two-thirds of
the Cardinal's total rushing yards — and
four of Stanford's five touchdowns on the
ground.
The Spartans' defense has been stingy on
the ground so far this season, allowing just

NOTES: The Cardinal will look to win its second
straight Bill Walsh Legacy game as it takes on the
Spartans this Saturday. Last year's victory featured
the emergence of Toby Gerhart and the Stanford of
fense, but also proved to be the star running back's
downfall as he was lost for the remainder of the
season with a knee injury in the Cardinal's 37-0 vic
tory. A win would even Stanford's record at 2-2.

166 net yards rushing and three touchdowns
through ihe first three weeks of the season.
Indeed, in starting out the season 2-1. the
Spartans have yet to allow an opponent to
reach the century mark on the ground,
though Nebraska did come close with 99
rushing yards in its 35-12 drubbing of San
Jose State. On the flip side, though, the Spar
tans allowed San Diego State just six net
rushing yards on Saturday in a 35-10 home
victory.
And San Jose State hasn't exactly been
easy to pass against, either, having allowed
just oneTD through the air thus far.Taking
San Jose State's lone loss against Nebraska
as a blueprint, the Cardinal may need lo be
opportunistic on defense and special teams
in order to secure its second victory of the
season — the Huskers returned an inter
ception and a kickoff for touchdowns.
Offensively, San Jose State has been

beset by turnovers thus far this season, hav
ing thrown five picks and lost a fumble
through the first three weeks, an area where
the Cardinal defense will look to be oppor
tunistic having notched five turnovers on
the year thus far.
Through the air. the Cardinal has yet to
find its rhythm, as starting junior quarter
back Tavita Pritchard has improved his com
pletion percentage so far this year by over
seven percent from last year's 50 percent
rate, but has thrown three picks and just one
touchdown.
Moreover, a consistent receiving threat
has yet to step up to replace last season's
graduated seniors Evan Moore and Mark
Bradford. Junior Richard Sherman, whose
speed has made him perhaps the offense's
greatest deep threat out wide in recent
years, has amassed just 75 yards through the
tirst three games, with his only touchdown
coming on a blocked punt on Saturday
against the Horned Frogs.
A win Saturday could be crucial to Stan
ford's hopes for 2(X)X as the Cardinal faces a
daunting schedule down the stretch. With
the Cardinal facing a daunting final three
games in November —at Oregon, versus
IJSC and at Cal — it needs to start winning
now if it hopes to reach the six victories that
could make the squad eligible for its first
post-season bowl berth since 2001.
And with a pair of road games at Wash
ington and Notre Dame following this
weekend's contest, there is clearly no time
like the present for the Cardinal to spark a
winning streak.
Saturday's game against San Jose State is
slated to kick off at 6 p.m. and has been des
ignated the second annual Hill Walsh Lega
cy (iame. to honor the legendary coach who
graduated from San Jose State before begin
ning to lorge his historic career at Stanford.

Junior running back Toby Gerhart has helped carry the Cardinal offense through the first three games
of the season, but could face a tough challenge against San Jose State on Saturday. The Spartans have
not allowed an opposing back to rush for 100 yards or more so far this season.
