# Welcome to Stanford Sports 101
## 
### 
Well, you're here now. so
there's no denying it any
more: You're a Stanford
fan.
Sure, some of you will he decided
ly more ardent than others. It hap
pens every year, the freshmen
streaming in for their first home foot
hall game, faces painted, keys jan
gling at kickofl. jumping in unison as
the band plays that song you'll all
soon know all too well.
And then, a week or two later,
you'll reali/e there sure is an awful
lot to do here, and maybe you won't
see an athletic field again until Big
Game. Or maybe you'll hold off alto
gether until basketball season. Or
maybe you'll just hold off altogether
forever.
Don't take it personally. It hap
pens every year to every class as the
slightly interested masses are weed
ed out until only the true believers
and fanatics remain. It's a significant
part of the reason why our gorgeous
new football stadium has yet to he
full for even a single game and why
your average Stanford student prob
ably doesn't know what teams Stan
ford twin basketball stars Brook and
Robin Lopez will now play for in the
NBA (New Jersey and Phoenix, for
those interested).
It's not even really such a horrible
thing. Personal experience tells me
that it isn't that Stanford students
lack enthusiasm for their classmates'
endeavors on the athletic field, but
rather that they have enthusiasm for
so many other things across such a
broad and diverse range of subjects
that sometimes the mundanities of
the football team's record or the bas
ketball team's bracket or the loca
tion of the baseball diamond escape
them.
But you know what? It's a new
school year, and maybe the problem
in the past is that the new fans and
their new teams were just never
properly introduced. So here we go
all you need to know about the
Stanford sports scene in 700 words or
less:
First, football. By now. you've
probably realized that things are far
from perfect on this front â€” anytime
your average fan is hoping for a .500
record and a chance to go to a bowl
game for the lirst time since 2001.
you know there's work still to be
done.
And yet. the air surrounding this
team is far more optimistic than any
thing else.The reason? Perspective.
It might be hard to explain, but let
me try anyway: lliis team was bad.
Not mediocre bad or awful bad
no, we're talking historic levels of fu
tility as recently as two seasons ago.
And that was with the talented Trent
Edwards under center for much of
the season. Edwards was good
enough to turn around the Buffalo
Bills offense in the NFL, but he was
n't good enough to save Stanford's
offense in the Pac-10.That should tell
you something. The team won one
game in 2006, but frankly they prob
ably weren't even that good.
Enter Jim I larbaugh. Enter stun
ning wins over then-No 1 USC (in
the Coliseum, no less) and archrival
Cal. Suddenly, even a 4-8 record is
enough to leave you feeling all warm
and fuzzy on the inside.
In truth, the program still has a
long way to go. But there's a swagger
there that had previously been miss
ing for too long. A sense that on any
given Saturday, anything can hap
pen. A sense that the team has noth
ing to lose and everything to gain.
In short, the Cardinal is back to
being a potential giant-killer. The
kind of team that the other guys can't
sleep on because they're just good
enough and they know it. ITiat kind
of attitude and ability is a big part of
the history of Stanford football,
which is actually much more storied
than the last 10 years or so would
lead you to believe.
Next, basketball. I lere. there's ac
tually a truly passionate network of
Stanford fans on campus. Okay, so
they're not tlwi numerous, but in the
smaller venue ol Maples Pavilion
that can escape your notice.
But there could be dark days
ahead for the Cardinal basketball
program as the men's squad lost twin
big men Brook and Robin Lopez to
the NBA and coach Trent Johnson to
LSU in one fell swoop, so sudden
that it led some to sniff conspiracy.
Former Duke assistant coach Johnny
Dawkins will look to take over what
could be a lengthy rebuilding process
