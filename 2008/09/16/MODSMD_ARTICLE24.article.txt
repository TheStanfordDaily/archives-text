## 
### DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's volleyball team had
an uncharacteristic start to its 2008 season.but
now seems to have returned back to its old
self.
Coming off a five-set loss in the national
title game last year to Penn State, Stanford had
high hopes entering the 2008 season with sev
eral Ail-Americans and key players returning.
The opening of the 2008 campaign did not go
as planned, however, as the Cardinal suffered
two tough defeats but also posted some big
wins.
To begin the year. Stanford traveled to
Omaha, Neb. for the AVCA Showcase. The
tournament featured four of the top-10 teams
in the nation in Stanford,Nebraska.Texas and
USC. On opening night and Stanford's first
match of the season, they were swept by then-
No. 7 Nebraska, 3-0. It marked the first time
since November 2006 that the Cardinal was
swept in a match.

Stanford struggled to get its offense going
against the tough home crowd, as senior out
side hitter Cynthia Barboza led the team with
just 10 kills. Returning national player of the
year, senior Foluke Akinradewo and sopho
more sensation Alix Klineman were held to a
combined nine kills.
The next day. Stanford rebounded with a
gritty victory over then-No.3Texas.The Cardi
nal dominated out of the gate to take a two-set
lead, only to let Texas back into the match to
tie it at two sets apiece. Stanford prevailed in
the decisive fifth set. 15-10.
Stanford's offense looked much better
against the Longhorns: Klineman had 21 kills
en route to a double-double, while senior Erin
Waller notched 11 and sophomore Cassidy
Lichtman added 10.
Stanford then hit the road once more, trav
eling to Florida and St. Louis. Mo., where the
squad fared much better. The Cardinal swept
through Central Florida, William & Mary and
Illinois, seemingly having returned back to its
national title contender form of old. Akin

radewo, who seemed just a bit off in Omaha,
returned to her old self against Central Flori
da. where she pounded eight kills at a .636 hit
ting percentage. She showed why she was the
best player in the country last year against
William & Mary: 20 kills. .833 hitting percent
age and four blocks.
But playing a doubleheader on the last day
of the St. Louis Invitational. Stanfo.d was
stunned by the University of St. Louis 27-25.
20-25.25-22.25-22. It was the first time in eight
years that a Stanford team had lost to an oppo
nent ranked outside the top 10. Barboza led
the offense on the night with 12 kills and 13
digs, but it was not enough.The Cardinal com
pleted its season opening road trip with a 4-2
record and fell from No. 2 in the rankings to
No. 7.
Stanford returned home this past weekend
to play the Stanford Invitational, hosting New
Mexico State. UC-Santa Barbara and Santa
Clara. Klineman stole the show and was the
MVP of the tournament, posting 40 kills in the
three matches at a tournament best .481 hit

ting percentage.
The first night against New Mexico State
featured a former Stanford athlete and two
time Olympic gold medalist in attendance,
Kerri Walsh '00. Walsh was honored on the
court after the second set. Sophomore Janet
Okogbaa had a career night, tallying seven
kills, hitting a career-best .583 and recording a
season-high five blocks.
Against UC-Santa Barbara. Akinradewo
hit .421 with niiK 1 kills and also had a season
best six blocks. Barbo/a recorded another
double-double with 10 kills and 14 digs.
In the final game of the tournament, the
Cardinal outhit Santa Clara .42 l ) to .058. led by
Klineman's 16 kills at a career-best .615 clip.
With tough games and a few tough losses
behind them. No. 7 Stanford will travel to San
l.uis Obispo.Calif. this weekend to end its pre
season schedule. They will take on St. Mary's
on Friday at 7 p.m. and No. 16 Cal Poly on Sat
urdav ninht at 7 p.m.
