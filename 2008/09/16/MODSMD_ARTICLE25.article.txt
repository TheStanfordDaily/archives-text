## Team unity, ability on display as Stonford rolls 
### JACOB JOHNSON STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's soccer team beat
the University of San Francisco on Sunday
night, with Cardinal sophomore Bobby
Warshaw scoring the game's onlv goal in
the 54th minute. Stanford improved to 2-1
1 on the season and left USF (0-4) still
searching for its first win.
Despite their ugly record, the Dons
proved to be a tough challenge for the ( ar
dinal. as three of USF 's best players re
turned to action on Sunday after missing
the team's first three contests.
"USI is a really good team." s;iid senior
co-captain T.J. Novak. "Some of the guvs
were saying that this was the best 0-3 team
they had ever seen. They will contend for
their conference title."
The Dons' height was also a concern
going into the game — their starting de
fenders averaged over six feet tall - but
the Stanford forwards kept the ball on the
ground in an effort to neutralize that ad
vantage.
Novak started at forward on Sunday in
an effort to give the offense an extra spark.
Although he has not played forward since
his freshman campaign. Novak was origi
nally recruited as an offensive player and
had little trouble with the transition.
"It was different playing with my back
to the goal," he said.
The move paid off handsomely. Novak's

perfect cross early in the second hall leu to
the game's only goal and his first assist of
the season.
Warshaw's goal was his second of the
season, the most on the team. When asked
about his early success, the sophomore
credited the support of his teammates.
"Guys are giving me halls where 1 can't
miss." he said.
Sunday was nodifferent.as Novak found
a streaking Warshaw onl\ a few feet in front
ofanempu net.setting up an easy shot that
he "would have had to try to miss."
Despite its recent success, the season
started oft slowh for the Cardinal. After
dropping both of its preseason tune-ups,
Stanford tied San Jose State on Aug. 31 and
lust badly to SMI I on Sept. s.The Stanford
men scored onl\ two goals in their first four
games including one in the preseason —
while allowing their opponents six.
The squad appears to have turned a cor
ner in its last two contests. In the home
opener on Sept 7. Stanford shut out Cor
nell and scored twice. The win over USF
gave the Stanford men back-to-back wins
a feat they only accomplished twice last
year.
Hie ( ardinal has not won three or more
games in a row since the 2004 season, a
streak it hopes to break when the team
takes on Drake and No. 3 Creighton at the
Stanford Nike Classic this weekend.
The team's attitude has made the differ
ence in 2008. according to the players.
Novak, one ol the team's captains, has no
ticed a positive change in the team atmos
phere.
"Marly in the season, guvs were doing
just enough to make sure thev looked good
