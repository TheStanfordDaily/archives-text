# Card women set to face daunting UNC
## 
### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
A record of 6-0-1 in its first seven matches.
19 goals scored, compared to just two goals
conceded. A No. 3 national ranking. Yes, it's
safe to say that the early season has been kind
to the Stanford women's soccer team.
"I think we've had a strong start to the sea
son; the entire team is playing good soccer."
head coach Paul Ratcliffe said. "The work
ethic of the team is fantastic and we have a
very talented group of players — we have a
very positive team chemistry as well."
That chemistry has often been showcased
in the box scores of its matches. The Cardinal
opened the season in style with a 5-0 home
thrashing of Pacific on Aug. 24. The next week
end. the team proceeded to defeat Navy 3-1
and then-No. 15 Boston College 3-0. Fresh
man Teresa Noyola scored three of the Cardi
nal's six goals in those two games, both of
which were played in front of a home crowd at
Cagan Stadium.
The team then flew down to Georgia for
the Georgia/Nike Invitational, and the domi
nance demonstrated at home continued on
the road. In the first game of the Invitational.
Stanford swept aside Auburn. 3-0, with goals
coming from forwards Christen Press. I .indsay
Taylor and Morgan Redman.
Two days later, the Cardinal battled No. 22
Georgia. But even though the Bulldogs had
home-field advantage. Stanford still proved to
be too strong for its opponents as it won 2-0.
courtesy of a pair of Taylor goals. The fresh
man showed some breathtaking skills in the
game, with her first goal coming off a beautiful
trap-and-shoot and the second on a quick
burst that showed off her speed as she rocket
ed past a defender for an open shot on goal.
Ilie team returned to California high in
confidence and with a perfect record of 5-0,
but they faced a stiff test this past weekend as
they hosted the Stanford Invitational. In the
team's first match, it was paired against peren
nial powerhouse No. 5 North Carolina.
In the 26 years of the College Cup's exis
tence. the Tar Heels have won the title 19
times. Add that to the fact that Stanford's all
time record against UNC was 0-7-1 entering
the game, and history certainly did not appear
to on the Cardinal's side.
Unfortunately for the home fans, the game

seemed to he following that history in the first
half as North Carolina took a 1-0 lead into the
break after a goal from U.S. Olympian Tohin
Heath. Although Lindsay Taylor was unlucky
to have a goal-bound shot cleared off the line,
the Tar Heels definitively outplayed the Car
dinal in the opening 45 minutes.
The second half started with more of the
same, as UNC seemed to have an extra player
on the pitch, dominating play and winning
most of the 50-50 balls. However, with time
running out and their undefeated start to the
season in jeopardy, the Stanford players
flipped the switch.
The team threw everything they had at the
North Carolina goal, and they were rewarded
with the equalizer just three minutes from full
time as Kelley O'Hara ran onto an Alicia
Jenkins through ball and beat the UNC keep
er Ashlyn Harris one-on-one. Suddenly,all the
momentum was in Stanford's favor as the two
teams headed for overtime.
The Cardinal offense did not let up in the
first overtime period, as the women fired six
shots at the UNC net: but 11 arris came up big
for the Tar Heels, stopping all of them includ
ing two close-range Christen Press attempts in
rapid succession.The excitement died down a
bit in the second overtime as neither team reg
istered a shot on goal, and the match ended in
a draw.
The North Carolina game might have been
the first blemish on Stanford's record this
year, but it also might have been the game that
revealed the most about the team. Ratcliffe
was very pleased with the way his squad
fought back after being outplayed early.
"We're still a pretty young team [so] the
first half we looked a little inexperienced," he
said. "But as the game went on. we showed a
lot of strength and heart. It was a good experi
ence for the team and it showed we can play
with the best in the country"
The Cardinal finished up the Stanford Invi
tational on Sunday against another North
Carolina team. UNC-Greensboro. The Card
did not wait to get on the score sheet this time,
as Press notched her fifth goal of the year just
10 minutes in. Junior Kristin Stannard scored
her first of the season towards the end of the
first half as she hit a one-timer through traffic
to give Stanford an insurance goal and that
was all they would need as they cruised to a 2-
0 victory.

"Hiis weekend the team hits the road again
as it takes on Yale and Cal Poly in the Santa
Clara Classic. With the way the team has been
playing. Stanford will he expected to maintain
its undefeated record, hut Ratcliffe knows that

the Card can't get too carried away this early.
"It has been a great start to the season," he
said,"but we still have a lot to prove."
