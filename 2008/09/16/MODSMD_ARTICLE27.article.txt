# Polo sweeps Princeton tourney
## No. 3 Cardinal rolls to 5-0 start on East Coast 
### KENAN JIANG STAFF WRITER 
With the school year just getting underway,
the No. 3 Stanford men's water polo team has
already played its first tournament of the year,
in which they traveled east to Princeton and
annihilated their opposition in an auspicious
start to the 200.S season.

Stanford ended last night with a 5-0 run to
dispatch Bucknell 18-5, having previously de
feated Brown 13-4. Stanford also routed
Princeton 12-2 and the U.S. Naval Academy
13-4 en route to handily defeating both Brown
and Bucknell last Sunday and earning the
tournament title. In the first round. Stanford
also beat Johns I lopkins 18-5 to start the tour
nament perfect — the same way the squad fin
ished it.
In the Bucknell game. Stanford star junior
Sage Wright and fellow junior Janson Wigo
were the Cardinal's leading goal scorers,
notching six apiece. Sophomore utility Jeffrey
Schwimmer chipped in three goals along with
sophomore Alex Pulido, freshman Peter

Sefton nnd sophomore Will Smith.
With the graduation of last season's start
ing goalkeeper Sandy 11oehner,junior Jimmie
Sandman and sophomore Brian Pingree
shared the action against Bucknell in the
morning. In the afternoon win against Brown.
Pingree played the entire game contributing
seven saves to the Cardinal victory.
"Jimmie will he the key to our success."sev
enth-year head coach John Vargas told
CioStanford.com. "I believe he is one of the
hest.il not the best,goalies in the country."
"You win championships with defense,and
he'll be the catalyst for our great defense." the
coach continued. "Jimmie is a very athletic
goalie and he is the reason we will have a shot

at being one of the top teams in the country."
, Last year, the men's team dueled all season
long against conference rivals USC and Cal.
and finished third after losing to the Trojans in
the semifinals and the Bears in the third-place
match at the Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion Tournament.
The Cardinal made very substantial
progress over the course of the year, though,
finishing a respectable 17-S overall, and will
again be considered one of the favorites for
the championship this year.
"This year will be a real fun year as far as
how we're going to play offensively," Vargas
told GoStanford.com. "It's going to be a fast
paced game, a very dynamic offense. With
those returning players and the experience
and chemistry that they have, we'll have a
great product and it will be a lot of fun to
watch us play."
Stanford, despite its 17-S record and third
place finish in the MPSF last season, did not
qualify for the four-team NCAA champi
onship field, which will be once again hosted at
Avery Aquatic Center in early December.
Last year's team scored 263 goals, and 12
players who scored 221 of the team's goals be
tween them in 2007 return this season. It's no
wonder then that the Cardinal anticipates a
potent offense to pair with a shutdown de
fense.
Now a junior, All-American first-team
member Sage Wright is arguably the best play
er in the nation and co-led the Cardinal last
year with 33 goals along with two-meter man
Will Hindle-Katel, a veteran senior on this
year's team.
Janson Wigo and brother Drac Wigo both
scored 32 goals last season and will be on the
wings, with both responsible for a bulk of the
attack as well as the first line of defense
against opponents.
Seniors Andrew Drake, Chris Jacobson
and Steven Wright will also be options for a
very deep Stanford team which has added
freshmen Alex Avery. Ryan Brown, Eric ( tap
per, Porter Kalbus, redshirt Ryan Kent, An
drew Lai orge,Travis Noll.Tim Norton. Peter
Sefton and Jacob Smith. Together they will
seek to dethrone defending MPSF champion
Cal in 2008.The Bears won the championship
K-6 in a thriller last year against USC, despite
losing to Stanford in a double-overtime nail
biter 10-9 at Avery Aquatic Center along the
way.
Stanford next hits the pool on Friday
against Air Force at Averv Aquatic Center.
The match is scheduled to begin at ft p.m.
