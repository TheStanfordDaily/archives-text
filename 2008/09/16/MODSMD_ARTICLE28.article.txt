## Strength of schedule favors Pac 
### 
To be perfectly honest. I told
my brother early Saturday
morning that I thought Ohio
State was going to beat LJSC. For one,
Ohio State had lost the past two big
time games (national championship
games) and I thought they were due
for a victory in this one. Secondly,
everyone at Stanford knows that
even though USC might look unbeat
able on paper, anything can happen.
By the second quarter, however. I
was eating my words, as the Trojans
utterly dominated the Buckeyes. It
led me to think why I might have
thought Ohio State could beat USC.
After some conversation and re
search I realized there might be a
somewhat plausible answer to my
question: that old devil plaguing BCS
prognosticators for years, the non
conference schedule.
Ohio State's nonconference
games this year are IJSC. Ohio,
Youngstown State and Troy. Last
year it was Youngstown State. Kent
State, Washington and Akron. In
2006. it was Northern Illinois, Texas,
Cincinnati and Bowling Green.
Of those 12 nonconference games,
I'll give them credit for scheduling
four tough matchups.The other eight
might be more accurately termed
"easy wins," "powder puffs" or "cup
cakes." That's eight fairly easy victo
-ijs over the last three years, and for
the Buckeyes it was four per season
until last weekend (don't forget, all
you need to do is win six games to
earn a spot in a postseason bowl).
But it's not just Ohio State. I went
online and looked at nonconference
opponents for the past few years of
another perennial power out of the
Big 10. Penn State; I also looked at
Tennessee, LSU and Georgia out of
the SEC. the often-named best teams
out of the often-named best confer
ence in the nation.
In no particular order of any year,
here is what I found for some non
con fere nce op p() nen t s:
Tennessee faced UCLA, UAB,
Northern Illinois, Wyoming. Califor-
