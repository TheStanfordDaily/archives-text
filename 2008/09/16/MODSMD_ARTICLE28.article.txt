## Strength of schedule favors Pac 
### 
To be perfectly honest. I told
my brother early Saturday
morning that I thought Ohio
State was going to beat LJSC. For one,
Ohio State had lost the past two big
time games (national championship
games) and I thought they were due
for a victory in this one. Secondly,
everyone at Stanford knows that
even though USC might look unbeat
able on paper, anything can happen.
By the second quarter, however. I
was eating my words, as the Trojans
utterly dominated the Buckeyes. It
led me to think why I might have
thought Ohio State could beat USC.
After some conversation and re
search I realized there might be a
somewhat plausible answer to my
question: that old devil plaguing BCS
prognosticators for years, the non
conference schedule.
Ohio State's nonconference
games this year are IJSC. Ohio,
Youngstown State and Troy. Last
year it was Youngstown State. Kent
State, Washington and Akron. In
2006. it was Northern Illinois, Texas,
Cincinnati and Bowling Green.
Of those 12 nonconference games,
I'll give them credit for scheduling
four tough matchups.The other eight
might be more accurately termed
"easy wins," "powder puffs" or "cup
cakes." That's eight fairly easy victo
-ijs over the last three years, and for
the Buckeyes it was four per season
until last weekend (don't forget, all
you need to do is win six games to
earn a spot in a postseason bowl).
But it's not just Ohio State. I went
online and looked at nonconference
opponents for the past few years of
another perennial power out of the
Big 10. Penn State; I also looked at
Tennessee, LSU and Georgia out of
the SEC. the often-named best teams
out of the often-named best confer
ence in the nation.
In no particular order of any year,
here is what I found for some non
con fere nce op p() nen t s:
Tennessee faced UCLA, UAB,
Northern Illinois, Wyoming. Califor-
nia, Southern Miss, Arkansas State and
Louisiana-Lafayette.
LSU scheduled Appalachian State, North
Texas.Tulane.Troy. Virginia lech. Middle Ten
nessee State and Louisiana Tech.
Georgia took on Georgia Southern, Geor
gia Tech. Central Michigan, Arizona State,
Western Carolina. Troy, Western Kentucky
and UAB.
Penn State matched itself against Coastal
Carolina, Oregon State. Syracuse, Temple.
Youngstown State. Buffalo. Florida Interna
tional and Notre Dame.
So what do you see? Yes. there are a few
nonconference games that are either tradition
al rivalries or tough matchups. But it's clear
that the majority of these teams' nonconfer
ence games are against traditionally weak op

ponents. Some of these games were won by 30,
40 or even 50 points.
No wonder these teams almost always fin
ish with winning records and make it to upper
echelon bowl games. II they get three or four
nonconference wins, they only have to go
about .500 in conference games to gel to eight
wins.The pollsters and BCS formula don't give
a huge emphasis to quality of opponent, so
these teams can be ranked high and have good
records when really sometimes half their wins
are against weak opponents.
How about some of the Pac-10 nonconfer
ence opponents this year and in years past?
LISC scheduled Virginia. Ohio State. Notre
Dame, Nebraska and Arkansas. Other Pac-10
squads scheduled the likes ol Tennessee. BYIJ,
Fresno State. Notre Dame, Utah, Michigan
State, Okahoma, Purdue, Michigan. Georgia,
LSU and Colorado. And they scheduled them
with frequency.
You don't see any Western Carolinas. Troys,
or Temples here, do you? Yes, some Pac-10
teams play easy opponents like Eastern Wash

ington, Northern Arizona,and Utah State. But
as a whole, the Pac-10 does not play near the
number of "cupcakes" the Big 10 or SEC plays.
Furthermore.the Big lOandSEConly play
eight conference games a year, when there are
11 and 12 teams in the conference, respective
ly. That leaves four games for nonconference
opponents. Each Pac-10 team plays a full
schedule against its conference — nine
games, leaving room for three nonconference
opponents. That one game difference might
not seem like a lot. but in fact it is.There have
been countless times in past seasons that one
game has been the make-or-break difference
for teams' bowl game or even national title
hopes.
But wait, this isn't entirely a one-sided
issue. Those small schools actually do want to
play the big schools. The schools receive
money, national TV exposure and get to play in
virtually no-lose situations, where an upset can
make their season while losses do little to hurt
their standing.
And as any fan of Appalachian State or

Michigan will tell you, there have indeed been
upsets. It is those upsets that keep quieting
people like me, because it shows that even
those supposed easy wins do sometimes end
up as shocking losses.
Make no mistake, LSU has won the nation
al championship two out of the last five years
and they have deserved it. And many of the
teams from the SEC and Big 10 and other con
ferences are very good year in and year out —
the SEC' does have four of the ten BCS nation
al championships.
But isn't playing for the national champi
onship a byproduct of a good record? And
couldn't a good record be a byproduct of play
ing three or four games against "cream puffs"
each year? 'ITie answer might seem obvious,
yet to football fans it is in fact very complex.
So let the debates rage. After all. that's half
the fun of college football season, isn't it?
