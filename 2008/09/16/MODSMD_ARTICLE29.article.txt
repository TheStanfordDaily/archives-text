tion to start 2008 regular season
The Cardinal got off to a 1-5 start to begin
its lirst season under sixth-year head coach

part. Stanford has struggled in close games,
aside from its lone win on the year thus far —
a 3-2 road victory over Central Michigan.
The Cardinal has been outscored 17-9 and
outshot 87-55. Irue freshman forward
Stephanie Byrne leads the squad with four

home loss against Drexel.The Dragons scored
three first-half goals in their victory over Stan
ford, outshooting the Cardinal 18-9 in its first
loss in its regular season opener since 2005.
The Stanford women next traveled to
Michigan, where they took on a pair of the
sports' heavyweights in No. 10 Michigan State
in East Lansing and No. 9 Michigan in Ann
Arbor. While it took overtime for the Spartans
to down the Cardinal at Michigan State, 3-2.
on Jeamie Deacon's game-winner three min
utes into the sudden death period, the Wolver
ines followed that inspired effort by handing
Stanford a 5-1 drubbing two days later.
But on Sept. 7. the Cardinal rallied for its
first win of the season against Central Michi
gan. downing the Chippewas 3-2. Gandhi,
sophomore XantheTravlos and junior Rachel

Mo/.enter each scored her first goal of the sea
son in the second half of Stanford's come
from-behind win.
After recording its first regular-season vic
tory of 2008,the Cardinal next returned home,
where it took on another pair of nationally
ranked powers. No. 4 Iowa on Saturday and
No. 19 Albany on Sunday.
After taking an early 2-1 lead over the
1 lawkeyes, Stanford was overcome by a flurry
of second-half shots. Iowa scored two goals in
the second half to down Stanford 3-2. with the
go-ahead goal coming in the 60th minute of
play
The next day against Albany, Stanford out
shot the Great Danes 14-6. but still fell 1-0.
Goalkeeper Ashley Ross made seven saves to
preserve the win for Albany, after Michele
Polizois scored the decisive goal at the 5:27
mark in the first period.
Next up, the Cardinal is scheduled to travel
to North Carolina, where it will take on Ap
palachian State, Radford and Longwood in a
trio of matches on Wednesday. Friday and
Sunday, respectively. The three games repre
sent just the second, third and fourth matches
the Cardinal will have the opportunity to
prove itself against unranked opponents.
Pair of Stanford right-handers awarded
summer top prospect honors
Junior Jeffrey Innian and sophomore Alex
Pracher were awarded top prospect honors in
their respective summer leagues last week by
Baseball America. The pair of right-handed
pitchers dominated the prestigious Cape Cod

League and the Atlantic Collegiate League,
respectively.
Inman. pitching for the Yarmouth-Dennis
Red Sox in the Cape went 1-1 with a 3.73 ERA
in six starts en route to a ninth-place individ
ual ranking for the summer by Baseball Amer
ica. while Pracher went 2-0 with a 2.42 ERA
through six games with the Quakertown Blaz
ers to earn a filth place ranking in his league.
Pracher and Inman will each look to be a
big part of the Cardinal staff in 2009, as Inman
could be primed to be the Cardinal's Friday
night starter following the departures of lefty
Jeremy Bleich and graduated senior Erik
Davis. Inman went 7-2 with a 4.27 F1RA last
season, while Pracher was 1-1 with a 7.42 ERA
