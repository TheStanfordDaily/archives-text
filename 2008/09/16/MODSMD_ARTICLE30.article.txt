## Fans betray dignity of U.S.Open 
### 
In case you missed it. Roger Feder
er recently claimed his fifth
straight U.S. Open title, as he con
tinues to inch towards Pete Sampras'
Grand Slam record.
I am one of Federer's biggest fans,
but a part of me wanted Novak
Djokovic to be crowned champion.
Just imagine that scene and the chaos
that would ensue. Had Djokovic been
on the podium in front of the crowd. I
have no doubt that the boos would
have rained down on him. and 1 am
ashamed to even think that it could
happen.
Tennis is a gentlemen's sport. It is
an unwritten rule that fans should
never cheer errors or heckle players,
especially during a Grand Slam
event, the pinnacle of the game. But
for two nights at the Arthur Ashe Sta
dium, the New York crowd broke this
hallowed tradition, to their own
shame.
When Djokovic faced off against
New York's poster boy. Andy Rod
dick, the crowd let him have it, veiling
during his serves and in the middle of
points.
After staring down the disruptive
— if not disrespectful — crowd
twice. Djokovic shouted. "Shut up!"
into the stands as Roddick took the
lead in the set.
It made no difference to the final
result, as Djokovic finished off Rod
dick 6-2, 6-3, 3-6. 7-6 (5). But in the
traditional postgame interview.
Djokovic addressed Roddick's com
ments. which further irked the New
York crowd and earned him some
more boos after a masterful decon
struction of Roddick's game.
And against Federer. without the
crowd behind him. Djokovic floun
dered and flopped. The merciless
boos seemed to have finally gotten to
Nole.
What does this all mean in the
grand scheme of things? Federer
seemed destined to win this year, re
gardless of the crowd, and surely
Djokovic has plenty of time left to
win a U.S. Open in his career.
But in all fairness. Nole deserved
better.
The same New York crowd that
booed him in 2(X)8 loved him last year
for his impersonations of Rafael
Nadal and Maria Sharapova. In fact,
Nole was what the sport needed — a
player with charisma anu charm will
ing to play to the crowd.
How could New York turn on him
so quickly'.'
In the previous rounds, Djokovic
had called his trainei numerous times
to treat on-court injuries from his hip
to his ankles.
Certainly, it was within his rights
to do so, but Roddick decided to
jump on his opponent's weakness
and make a mockery of his injuries.
Questioning his opponent's honesty
by suggesting that every injury and
plague known to mankind may have
been the culprit behind his oppo
nent's frequent injury timeouts.
Really. Andv Roddick? SARS
and anthrax?
Sure. Andy's a funny gu\ especial
ly with his self-deprecating humor
after every loss to Federer. but this
time, he stepped over the line.
Roddick's comments questioned
the validity and honestly of his oppo
nent. He called out Djokovic. who
had done nothing wrong by the book,
trying to get some kind of edge over
the 2()()7 finalist.
In fact, far from the disingenuous
gamesmanship Roddick seemed to
suggest Djokovic was perpetrating,
after watching all of Nole's four- and
five-set matches, it's a wonder he
could even still stand up. He had a
right to be banged up after all the
punishment he'd endured to that
point. And Djokovk played above
Roddick's comments.
After the game. Roddick cited
Djokovic's impressions and said that
if he could dish out jokes, he should
be able to take them as well. Alas, that
argument doesn't hold. Djokovic's
impressions were in good humor, not
an attack at his opponents. The only
reason he had done them was be
cause others had jested at his 15-
bounce ritual before serving.
Roddick's jokes were different
and in bad taste — he was attacking
Djovokic.calling him a fake, trying to
rally the crowd behind him.
Apparently, the scheme worked.
After the match. Djokovic real
ized the monster that he had created
and profusely apologized. But really,
it was the crowd that should have
apologized to him.
When you get into the business of
booing and jeering players, you are
no longer a true fan of the game. The
game and all of its history demands
the respect of the players by the
crowd, and that demand was not met.
Nole played an amazing tourna
ment. winning so many grueling
matches and giving the crowd what
they paid for. I le entertained them
for two years in a row now and has
firmly entrenched himself as one of
the top-3 men's players in the world.
He simply did not deserve the
fate that befell upon him. Nole was
entitled to his comments after heat
ing Roddick, and maybe even more.
When Federer was crowned. New
York was called the sports capital of
the U.S.. if not the world.
Not this year.
'ITie crowd proved to be a fan of
media and fame, not of the sanctity
of the sport, of the game itself.
For shame.
