W lien it comes to Oriental foods around
campus, there are literally dozens of choices. For
those looking for good Thai that won't break the
bank, Siam Royal is the right spot. In the heart
of downtown Palo Alto, an easy bike ride from
campus, the restaurant features excellent Thai
cuisine that maintains a balance of flavor with
out overwhelming the palate. Siam Royal has
been open for fifteen years and was recommend
by the SF Chronicle, SF Magazine for the Best
and Cheap Thai food, and was the winner of the
Palo Alto Daily, and Palo Alto Weekly's for the
Best Thai Food Awards.
The appetizers and soups are great ways to
start your meal. The Mint Rolls are one of the
favorite appetizers. Also, the Satay is quite pop
ular among long time customers. For the main

course, one should try their Curries as they are
the house specialty. The Panang Salmon is high
ly recommended. Anything with the house
peanut curry sauce is good too. For a change of
pace, one should try the Mango Chicken or
Tamarind Shrimps as a lighter option. If you
want to play it safe, the noodles are always a hit.
The traditional Pad Thai Noodle has been a
favorite ever since we opened. The Pad See Ew
or Drunken Noodle have been great alternatives
to the Pad Thai. If there is still some room left,
our Mango Sticky Rice is an excellent choice to
finish a meal.
A popular eatery among students, the the
restaurant offers sit-down dining in comfortable
seats with a cozy fireplace for the winter chill. If
you crave delicious Thai cuisine, Siam Royal is
your restaurant. ■
