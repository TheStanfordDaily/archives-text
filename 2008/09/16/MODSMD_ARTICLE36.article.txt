T he new year marks the 38"' anniversary of Chef Chu's in Los Altos - 38 years of
outstanding Chinese food that has kept the restaurant thriving, and 38 years of
boundless energy that has made owner/chef Lawrence Chu one of the Peninsula's
celebrity chefs.
With the success of the restaurant so intertwined with the popularity of its owner,
it is hard to say which drives the other more. But spend a few minutes watching
Lawrence Chu in action, gaze at the steady stream of people entering his restaurant
or better yet, savor a delicious meal, and you'll realize you're experiencing some
thing special.
Specializing in Hunan and Szechuan cuisine, Chu's extensive menu brims with
delectable dishes that are infused with a diversity of flavors. Favorites include the
potstickers (freshly-made in-house daily), Candied Pecans with Prawns, Wok-seared
Salmon with Spicy Black Bean Sauce, Pan-seared Black Pepper Steak, and Steamed
Sea Bass with Ginger and Green Onion. The restaurant's delectable culinary cre
ations have kept it a perennial favorite for everyone from residents to visiting pro ath
letes and even heads of state.
In addition to his demanding role as restaurant proprietor and chef de cuisine,
Chu has somehow found the time to earn an abundance of other credits that include
writing a best-selling cookbook ("Quick, Healthy, Simple, Delicious"), teaching a
regular series of cooking classes, and supporting a long list of community-oriented

projects, including the YMCA and local hospital fund-raisers. Chu is also a co
founder of the Asian Chefs Association and, venturing further out, has also begun
leading annual culinary tours of China.
The restaurant's story continues to unfold with the next generation. Lawrence's
son and daughter, Larry and Jennifer, are now also adding their energy to the oper
ation of the restaurant. Charming, talented and dedicated, they are clearly contin
uing the Chu tradition of excellence in hospitality. â–
