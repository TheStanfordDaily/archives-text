## Stanford community donates generously to Obama Faculty and staff contribute record numbers to Democratic candidate 
### SCOTT SAYARE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As an historic and historically lengthy
election season reaches its frenzied final
stages, activism, excitement and outrage
have spiked on both sides of the political
spectrum. And while Stanford scrupulously
avoids any hint of partisan perspective, its
employees decidedly do not.

Stanford employees have contributed
over $50,000 since June to the presidential
campaign of Sen. Barack Obama (D-III.),
according to the non-partisan Center for
Responsive Politics (CRP).'lTiat makes the
University, as an employer, the seventh
largest contributor to the Obama campaign
this summer. And with almost $300,000 in
contributions since the start of the cam
paign season, Stanford ranks 20th in overall
donations to Obama this election cycle.
"My whole life, I've had to vote for can
didates by saying,' Which is the least of the
worst?'" said law professor Larry Marshall.
"The first candidate in my life where I've
ever really felt like I'm in the presence of

greatness has been Barack Obama."
Marshall, an Obama donor and longtime
supporter who worked on Obama's U.S.
Senate campaign in Illinois, said a great
number of his colleagues share his excite
ment, calling Obama "a candidate who in
spires people, and those people include aca
demics."
University employees have given more
to the Obama campaign than to any other
presidential candidate in recent history.
Stanford's giving to Sen. John McCain (R-
Ariz.) pales in comparison. Stanford em
ployees have given just under $20,000 to
McCain since the start of the campaign sea
son.

These numbers match a longtime nation
al trend in campaign contributions by aca
demia, an industry whose giving is dominat
ed by university professors and administra
tors. who tend to favor Democrats. This
year, that Democratic bent appears particu
larly strong.
1 ITiey are the most Democratic in their
giving that they've been as long as we've
been collecting data," said CRP spokesman
Massie Ritsch.
In 1 WO. when the CRP began collecting
data on contributions to federal politics, 57
percent of donations by the education in-
dustry went to Democrats. This
year, that number is 79 percent.
Even more striking,9o percent of
the $11.5 million contributed by ed
ucation to this year's major party
presidential nominees has gone to
Obama, the Democratic candidate.
Long a major player in Democratic
giving, education is the third
ranked industry in overall contribu
tions to the Obama campaign. Edu
cation ranks 15th in giving to Mc-
Cain.
Stanford's numbers are even
more skewed. Of money given to
the McCain and Obama campaigns.
Obama has received over 93 per
cent.
And this comes during an all
time record year for contributions
by University employees to presi
dential campaigns. Stanford em
ployees have given a combined
$442,000 this year, almost $180,000
more than they gave in 2004.
Experts suggest that opposition
to the Bush administration galva
nized support for Democratic can
didates four years ago. In 2004, ac
ademic contributions to federal
politics doubled from 2000 levels,
and education shot from 26th to
eighth in industry rankings for
overall donations. At the moment,
it seems unlikely that academia in
general will contribute as heavily in
2008.
"It may be that George Bush was
a bigger motivator, and that now
that he's not on the ballot, they're
pulling back," Ritsch said.
Evidently, this is not that case at
Stanford.
In both 2004 and 2008. the Uni
versity outstripped national trends
in giving to presidential campaigns.
Four years ago, Stanford ranked
13th nationwide in contributions to
Democratic candidate Sen. John
Kerry (D-Mass.). And while acade
mia doubled its contributions from
2000, Stanford's 2004 giving more
than tripled, due almost wholly to a
massive increase in donations to
Democrats, according to Federal
Elections Commission (FEC) data
compiled by politicalbase.com.
American colleges and universi
ties have long been regarded as
strongholds of Democratic politics,
and Stanford appears to be no ex
ception. But Republican and De
mocratic faculty members alike
maintain that the political land
scape on campus is not as lopsided
as this year's contributions might
suggest.
"I don't think that in any way

represents the ideological diversity
of the institution," Marshall said. "If
you're telling me that we think
that's somehow a proxy for identify
ing political leanings, it isn't."
Marshall said Stanford faculty
include "a tremendous number of
people who traditionally have sup
ported the Republican agenda,"
and suggested Republicans on cam
pus may simply donate less to poli
tics than Democrats.
"One of the questions is, 'Why
are those significant number of peo
ple on this campus who are support
ing the Republican ticket not giv
ing?'" he said.
According to CRF documents,
only 11 Stanford employees have
donated to the McCain campaign.
Those same documents show about
200 Stanford donors to Obama's
campaign.
"I think there is a general lack of
enthusiasm for what we've seen the
modern Republican party do in the
last eight years," said Morris Fiori
na, professor of political science and
Hoover Institution senior fellow,re
ferring to his Stanford colleagues.
But John Taylor, Hoover senior
fellow and professor of economics,
called Republican faculty members
"very positive" toward McCain.
Like Marshall,Taylor said contribu
tion statistics might be misleading,
especially this year.
"This was a very hotly contested
primary," he said of the race for the
Republican presidential nomina
tion. McCain emerged only in the
final moments as a come-from-be
hind victor, leaving contributions to
Republicans dispersed across a
number of candidates.
McCain received less than half
the $43,000 contributed by Stanford
employees to Republican candi
dates this year. And because the
Arizona senator has accepted pub
lic financing for his general election
campaign, he has been obliged to
cease accepting direct donations
since becoming his party's nominee
on Sept. 4.
By contrast, 70 percent of Stan
ford donations to Democrats have
gone to Obama, reflecting what
Taylor deemed a "tremendous pref
erence for Obama over Hillary
Clinton" amongst the faculty. And
the Obama campaign, which opted
out of public financing, continues to
raise money.
Despite his misgivings about the
contribution statistics, Taylor, an
avowed Republican and McCain
supporter, acknowledged that Uni
versity employees are largely De
mocratic-leaning.
"It's never been a problem for
me, in terms of the makeup of the
faculty," he said. "I don't think
there's anything permanent about

it. I think it could go hack in other
directions.
"I've just been used to it for so
many years," he added. "I guess it's
sort of just the way it is."
Institutionally, though. Stanford
remains non-partisan.
"Let me make it very, very, very
clear," said Larry Morton,senior as
sociate vice president for public af
fairs and director of government
and community relations."Stanford
University absolutely takes no posi
tion about candidates in any politi
cal issue."
Despite the administration's pol
icy of non-partisanship, Stanford
faculty interviewed for this article
universally called for an increase in
political involvement by faculty and
students.
"The disgrace is why our level of
giving generally, to either candidate,
is so pathetically low," Marshall
said. "That here we are. people who
are deeply educated and deeply fol
low these issues and have acute
senses of how much this matters,
anJ yet it appears that only a tiny
fraction of us have actually dipped
into our pockets to give."
Stanford currently employs
1,829 faculty members, along with
thousands of administrators and
staff. The School of Medicine and
Stanford Hospital and Clinics,
whose employees are counted as
University employees, add thou
sands more to the list of potential
Stanford-based donors.
Only a small proportion of Stan
ford employees have contributed to
this year's presidential campaigns.
But some call any political involve
ment by educators inappropriate
and dangerous, suggesting that par
tisan perspectives might find their
way into the classroom.
Stanford faculty members dis
agree.
"There's a difference between
advocating in the classroom and ad
vocating somewhere else," Fiorina
said.
Taylor said he would like to see
more political involvement by his
colleagues. He said he often wears a
tie that reads, "Democracy is not a
spectator sport."
Marshall sees academia as a crit
ical force in the democratic process,
a group particularly well-equipped
to offer reasoned perspectives on
politics and political candidates.
"This is a group that is very, very
driven by issues, and by vision and
by depth," he said."The idea that we
ought to be silenced in our speaking
or our giving, I think, would be a
great detriment to the community
at large."
