As an historic and historically lengthy
election season reaches its frenzied final
stages, activism, excitement and outrage
have spiked on both sides of the political
spectrum. And while Stanford scrupulously
avoids any hint of partisan perspective, its
employees decidedly do not.

Stanford employees have contributed

ployees have given just under $20,000 to
McCain since the start of the campaign sea

These numbers match a longtime nation
