Food is the national passion of Singapore
and "Shiok!" is the phrase most often heard
uttered by a Singaporean when he or she
has enjoyed a meal. Singapore is a multi
ethnic society made up of Chinese, Malay,
and Indian, whose immigrant forefathers
brought with them rich food traditions from
across Asia. Typical Singapore food is thus
an exciting blend of culinary heritage
based on some of Asia's greatest cuisine.
This combination creates a unique and
dynamic flavor livelier and far richer than
the traditions from which they stem.

Menu highlights include:

Roti Prata with Curry Sauce: The Roti Prata, a
delicious Indian style multi-layered bread,
is a special favorite of Shiok diners that
keeps people going back for more. This
dish is renown for its soft, flaky warm tex-

ture that is truly authentic of Singaporean Rotis.
Laksa: Enjoy a zesty noodle dish of prawns, chicken, bean sprouts, eggs, and cucumber that
is cooked in a spicy dried shrimp and coconut-curry broth.
Singapore Chicken Rice: This juicy, freshly-poached chicken is served with three different dipping
sauces and aromatic chicken flavored rice and soup.
V
Fragrant Chicken: Chicken marinated in fragrant shrimp paste sauce and deliciously fried
till crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Served with refreshing side of pineap
ple cucumber chutney and sweet chili sauce.
Singapore Chili Crab: A favorite seafood dish of Singaporeans, this fresh whole crab
Dungeness dish is flavored with a tantalizing spicy, sweet chili sauce.
SHIOK! Singapore Kitchen offers a selection of authentic Singaporean food in a casual and
friendly environment. We hope you will enjoy the flavors and find it a Shiok! experience too! â–
