Hours:
Lunch: Monday-Saturday: 11 a.m. - 3 p.m.
Dinner: Friday & Saturday: 5 p.m. - 10 p.m.
Sunday - Thursday: 5 p.m. - 9:30 p.m.
Recently opened in 2005, Thaiphoon is conveniently located
just off of University Avenue (on Emerson Street) and is a
uniquely-decorated, casual place to go with friends or even a
date. Since opening, Thaiphoon has won Palo Alto Weekly's
Best Thai Restaurant award three years in a row. The cozy
restaurant has seating both inside and outside. When the tem
perature dips into the 40s, heat lamps provide comfortable
warmth. You will definitely want to sit outdoors on a warmer
day if you want a quieter, more serene experience.
For an appetizer, you might try the traditional route and
order vegetable fried egg rolls (cabbage, onions, carrots and
celery). Including about ten egg rolls, the appetizer is perfect
for a large group of people. If you are willing to step out of
your comfort zone for an appetizer, try the torn kha kai, a
coconut based soup with lemon grass, mushrooms, chicken
and cilantro, which is presented in a circular pot heated by a

flame in the middle.
When it comes to the main course, the pad thai is always
a hit. Customers also enjoy the spicy, flavorful rib-eyed steak,
and its smaller portion is good if you want a lighter option. For
the vegetarians, the panang tofu curry is a very tasty dish that
includes crispy tofu covered in a delicious red pepper, coconut
sauce.
Lastly, there is the fried banana with coconut ice cream
dessert at the Pan-Asian restaurant, Thaiphoon, is amazing.
Consisting of two banana halves surrounded by a crispy egg
roll-like wrapping and two scoops of coconut ice cream, it is
perfect for sharing. Think of it as a Thai version of warm apple
pie and golden vanilla ice cream.
If you are craving Thai food and looking for a nice,
relaxed place at which to eat, Thaiphoon is your restaurant. If
you come with a hungry stomach and an open mind, you are
guaranteed to have a successful dining experience. ■
