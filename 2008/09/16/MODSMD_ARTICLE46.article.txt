This issue is clearly dedicated to you, Class
of 2012 (and transfers, all 20 of you). We want to
say what's up, and, like everyone else around
here, welcome you to your new home on the
Farm. It is inexplicably strange that three years
ago we arrived on move-in day, just the same as
you. We were the tender class of '09 (Oooh
nine!), eager to go to frat parties, stay up all
night every night and—obviously—study our
hearts out.
Like you, Intermission is new too. Well,
sort of. Though you probably don't know it, this

is the soft opening of our newly re-vamped and
re-designed Intermission (thank you, Ashling
Loh-Doyle!). Our goal is to delve into the A&E
scene on campus and put the faces of our many
talented and artistic students on these pages for
their peers to see. We've started by featuring four
incoming student artists on our centerspread
(pages 6-7).
We hope you'll find the articles within
issue 01 both entertaining and useful. While
some upperclassmen attempt to impart their
hard-earned wisdom (Zumbro's Top 10, page 3;

Dr. Paul, page 11), others have worked hard to
put together comprehensive dining and enter
tainment guides that will get you through this
week and beyond.
Again, welcome to Stanford. We can't tell
you where the next few years will take you, but if
you're as lucky as us, you'll end up working in a
small, stuffy, windowless room: the Intermission
office at The Stanford Daily.
Xoxo,
Mac & Kelsey
