# Just because it feels like "magic" (a.k.a burn-y) does not mean it's good.
## (and other things learned along the way) 
### 
Hello, new freshman! You
probably don't know me
because you just got here —
but I sure know you! That's
because right now you're just
an archetype in my head.
And if you're anything like the generalizations
I'm making about you right now, you proba
bly have a bunch of questions you want
answered. Questions like, "What is the num
ber of things I ought to know upon embark
ing on my career as a Stanford student?" Well,
the answer is "10." There are 10 things you
should know. And here they are:
1 Water is essential for life — You may
have noticed that people who do not
drink water eventually die. This obser
vation is actually a biological fact, and it will
probably remain true throughout your life
time. So while your Stanford acceptance letter
does render you invulnerable to werewolves,
you are still going to have to drink some water
sometimes. This can be unexpectedly tricky,
however, especially if your dorm does not
have any water fountains. On late nights dur
ing my freshman year, I wound up cupping
my hands under bathroom faucets just to sip
their sweet, sweet, metallic-flavored nectar.
My friend had a Brita filter, and I was
extremely jealous. I recommend finding your
self a similarly re-useable water receptacle.
Like a cup.
2 Alcohol is not magic — Very few things
are actually magical. Alcohol is no
exception to this trend. While it may
taste like magic (aka burn-y), it endows you
with no spectacular abilities. Having conduct

ed many personal experiments, I can defini
tively say that alcohol does not make you a
better dancer, nor a better lover, nor does it
grant one the power of flight. That's not to say
that alcohol isn't a fun thing, because often
times it is. It makes you feel warm and comfy,
not unlike a sweater. But more alcohol does
not equal more sweater. In fact, imbibing too
much alcohol often results in a ruined
sweater. Because you vomit on it. In case that
was unclear.
3 Your supply of underwear is finite — I
know it seems like you've got skivvies
packed to last you from here to infinity,
but when you really get down to it, infinity
comes out to be more like next Tuesday. The
same goes for socks. Or bras. Or whatever
your "limiting factor" is when it comes to
laundry. Wash them. If you wait long enough
that you have to go commando in order to
take your hamper downstairs, you have wait
ed too long.
4 Sex is not inherently good — There is
an adage that compares sex to pizza,
stating that even when the pizza/sex is
bad, it's still good. I have multiple problems
with this adage, first and foremost being that
sex does not come with a free side of cheesy
breadsticks, although if it did I would totally
tip the delivery guy way more. Second and
secondmost, bad pizza reminds me of birth
day parties, while bad sex reminds me of why
I feel insecure in my manhood. Sex for sex's
sake is really kind of a squelchy mess, if you
think about it. And while it may sometimes
feel like magic (aka burn-y), the real magic is
in your connection with the other person. I'm

not saying you shouldn't go out there and
have fun, but just know that sex doesn't have
to be the focus simply because you're in col
lege.
5 The law — Sure, Johnny Law gets a bad
rap. He's kind of a square, and his arms
are so obnoxiously long that 1 can
understand why no one wants to hang out
with him. But he's really not that bad of a guy
once you get to know him. And once you get
to know him, he sort of stops bothering you.
So to all you freshmen out there, don't do
something illegal, like carrying a red cup full
of alcohol around campus, and you shouldn't
have a problem.
6 Biking is harder than you remember
— Some people rode their bikes in high
school. Oftentimes these are people
who got regular "exercise" and are now gener
ally "healthier" than those of us that stopped
riding bikes at age 11. So if you're a big bike
rider, 1 guess you won't have a problem. But
for all of us "normal" kids, biking can be
tricky. It also turns out that you can, in fact,
forget how to ride completely, which is yet
another adage debunked. My advice is to go
slowly and wear a helmet. And watch out for
fences. They sneak up on you.
7 The Internet is not people — The
Internet is one of those things that is
actually magic. However, it is not a per
son. Or people. People often reinvent them
selves on the Internet, which is wonderful if
that's what they want to do, but people also
reinvent themselves in college. I'm of the
opinion that the non-digital kind of reinven
tion is much more interesting. My basic point

is that I think you should stop poking some
one on Facebook and start poking them in
real life. They make much more interesting
facial expressions.
8 Earthquakes are almost always not a
big deal — Sometimes earthquakes
knock things down and sometimes
someone dies because of one. If it's a really big
one, part of a bridge might collapse, but hav
ing realized this is a possibility, people are try
ing to build better bridges. Other than that,
my experience as a California native has been
that earthquakes are typically "fun shaky
time." But if the earthquake lasts long enough
that you have time to realize it's happening
and get under a door frame, you should prob
ably get under a door frame.
9 College is you-time — Focus on your
self. Do things that you want to do. I
know that sometimes people define
themselves by what they're good at or who
they're dating or what their family thinks of
them. But this is possibly the first time in your
life when you can break some of those con
nections and form new ones. I'm not saying
you have to break up with your high school
sweetheart in order to have a good college
experience, but don't let that kind of thing be
the crutch that prevents you from standing on
your own. Be a little selfish and take every
thing you can from this university.

know that sometimes people define
themselves by what they're good at or who
they're dating or what their family thinks of
them. But this is possibly the first time in your
life when you can break some of those con
nections and form new ones. I'm not saying
you have to break up with your high school
sweetheart in order to have a good college
experience, but don't let that kind of thing be
the crutch that prevents you from standing on
your own. Be a little selfish and take every
thing you can from this university.
