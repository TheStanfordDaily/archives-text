# You heard it here: A sophomore's reflection on round one
## 
### 
High school is
excruciating — for
everyone, even for
the prom kings and
queen bees. Acne.
The sucking out of
one's life force to

succeed in classes one cares about. Fitting in. Standing out.
Curfews.
The entire institution of high school is designed to make
the most awkward time of a person's development even more
awkward. While 1 am busy trying to figure out if that thing that
happened the other night makes me bisexual or just a
Republican, I also have to determine if my resume is well
rounded enough.
We can't be who wc are. Instead, we cultivate an image of
ourselves that is not unlike a Facebook profile. We spend hours
composing the right interests, activities and groups in order to
present a version of ourselves that is a lot more interesting nnd
witty than our real selves. High school is just a grand perform
ance. And it's nonsense incarnate.
Well, college is a rejection of all that nonsense. We've
gotten some pretty sweet validation by gaining admittance to a

competitive school. This means we can cool off a bit on trying
to impress admissions officers. College is everything that high
school is not — sweet freedom.
But unfortunately, the journey is not all rainbows and
butterflies, and that's an important lesson to be learned fresh
man year. If you don't see it coming, the harsh realities can
break you down.
At first, everything is new and exciting, and you'll fall in
love with school. The University has so many wonderful peo
ple, parties and classes. Unlike high school, you have complete
freedom to experience those things fully. The beginning of
freshman year is your first taste of adulthood — but you still
don't have to worry about rent and careers just yet.
Inevitably, though, winter quarter arrives. The weather
gets cold, both figuratively and literally. The novelty of college
wanes, and you begin to realize that this whole experience is
actually quite challenging. While everything was so easy in the
fall, the volume seems to get turned up in the winter. The
friendships that before seemed flawless will undoubtedly
become bumpier. The pressure that everyone around you
seems to be doing bigger and better things begins to eat at your
soul. And you have an essay due tomorrow that you haven't
begun. You think to yourself,"! never had to work this hard to

do well in high school. And everything about my life seemed
so much less intense back then."
It turns out that freedom isn't the end-all be-all of exis
tence, and just because high school is over doesn't mean you
won't have plenty of challenges. You will find out that fresh
man year is the first time in your life you kind of get to be who
you are, and that's not always easy.
The good news is college brings a lot of good times.
Much of college is the fantasy we all imagine — pizza and con
versations until dawn. Behind every fantasy is the reality,
though. And college can supply a nice, healthy dose of reality.
At the end of the day, I'm not sure if 1 would've rather
have had only the fantasy. Maybe I learned something from the
challenging realities. That has yet to be determined, though. If
sophomore year is even a little bit better than freshman year
(which don't get me wrong, was excellent), I'll know that the
difficult times of my first year were all worth it. It life as a sec
ond-year isn't any easier, well, that means life probably doesn't
get any easier. Check back with me June '09.
