try it out for breakfast and/or lunch for their sandwiches.

424 Santa Teresa Street (Parked outside
Humanities Center on Santa Teresa Street)
Mon.-Fri. 12 p.m.-I:30 p.m.
While it may just look like a normal truck parked
on Santa Teresa, don't be fooled. At this pay-by
weight eatery, you fill your plate with noodles,
egg rolls or other Asian dishes inside and pay
outside. The food can be on the greasy side and
isn't particularly good for you, but the taste
keeps people coming back. NetAppetit is also a
non-profit set up to raise monies for Asian
refugee children.

Thai Cafe $

Mon.-Fri. 11:30 a.m.-2 p.m.
■ Those of you in Psych I will probably stare down ■
I this eatery multiple times per week. Located right 1
I outside of Building 420's main auditorium, the Thai
Cafe's long lunch lines should tell you a bit about the
I food. Make up your mind about what you're going J
& to try before you get to the counted as the place M
seems to make a point of efficiency. For the
popular noodle salads, only the sauce is
warm and the noodles are usually
served cold. Many dishes contain
peanuts.

Nexus is a gathering place, bringing in people from all over campus to taste the entrees being served up witli
alacrity and deliciousness. When dining here, expect to see some professors, doctors (from the med school) and
expert researchers eating alongside undergraduates. What brings all these people is the fine atmosphere, presen
tation, commitment to fresh ingredients and taste. Pizza, coffee and tacos are good bets here at this great lunch
location. Please note that their dinner offerings are paltry when compared with the roaring lunchtime selection.

advice: Go with friends, especially if you're a
frosh, when exploring the campus' many
dining adventures. Stations include a
taqueria, salads and sandwiches.
