## University leaders discuss drinking age Hernnessy refuses to partake in public discourse on subject 
### SCOTT SAYARE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A version of this article originally ran Thurs
day, Aug. 28,2008.
The Amethyst Initiative, a statement call
ing for open public discourse on the federal
ly mandated drinking age of 21, has been
signed by presidents from more than 130
American colleges and universities over the
past four months.
But Stanford won't be signing on.
President John L. Hennessy said in a
phone interview with The Daily that he is
"sympathetic" to the goals of the initiative
and would welcome debate on the subject of
the drinking age, but will not add himself to
the petition.
"1 think it is extremely unfortunate that
they moved forward without making a strong
statement about DUI laws," Hennessy said,
'it doesn't make sense to move forward
without that tie."
Ralph Castro, manager of the University's
Substance Abuse Prevention Program,
agreed that the initiative lacks necessary pro
visions.
"If they lowered it arbitrarily, it wouldn't
necessarily be effective in reducing high-risk
drinking," he said of the drinking age. "There
would have to be a lot of work on the front
end to get it down."
"The problem now," Castro continued, "is
we don't necessarily have standardized edu
cation for alcohol." I le suggested that a hypo
thetical lowering of the drinking age be ac
companied by a permit system akin to that
which exists for driving, including mandatory
education and a gradual increase in privi
leges.
Despite the problems pointed out by Hen
nessy and Castro, the initiative does seem to
be succeeding in its mission to foster public
debate on the drinking age.
"We're trying to get people to support the
general idea of debate." said Grace Kronen
berg. assistant to the director of Choose Re
sponsibility. the advocacy group behind the
statement."lt's an issue that most Americans
have seen as settled over the past 25 years."
she added, referencing the drinking age.
"Twenty-one is not working." reads the
statement. It calls for "an informed and dis
passionate public debate over the effects of
the 21-year-old drinking age."
In 1984, Congress passed the National
Minimum Drinking Age Act, mandating that
10 percent of allotted federal highway aid be
withheld from states setting a legal drinking
age of less than 21. In 1482. only 14 states
maintained a drinking age of 21. but by 1488,
every state had adopted that limit.
California is slated to receive $3.3 billion
in federal highway aid for fiscal year 2(KW.
Experts argue over the impact the in
creased drinking age has had on drinking be
havior among 18- to 20-year-olds. But propo
nents of the 21-year limit point to significant
decreases in alcohol-related deaths for that
age group since 1984. According to Mothers
Against Drunk Driving (MAI)D) and the Na
tional I lighway Traffic Safety Administration
(NHTSA), the law has saved 25,000 lives, in
cluding an estimated 1 >(K) in 2006.
MADD has lambasted the petition and its
signatories, calling it a "misguided initiative
that uses deliberately misleading information
to confuse the public on the effectiveness of
the 21 law."
"It is deeply disappointing to me that many
of our educational leaders would support an
initiative without doing their homework on
the underlying research and science," said
MADD National President Laura Dean-
Mooney in a press release
MADD, in conjunction with the Insurance
Institute for Highway Safety (IIUS), the
American Medical Association (AMA), the
National Transportation Safety Board
(NTSB) and the Governors Highway Safety
Association (CiHSA), has called on the presi
dents to remove their names from the state
ment, encouraging MADD supporters to

pressure them. Signatories report being inun
dated hy hundreds of identical emails from
MADD supporters.
At least two presidents have removed their
names from the list in the past week, though
about 30 added their signatures over the same
period.The 129 current signatories include the
presidents of Dartmouth. Duke, Johns Hop
kins. Ohio State, Pomona. Santa Clara I Inivet
sity and Tufts.
"This is not a simple question," wrote I )uke
President Richard I i. Brodhead in a statement
on the Amethyst Initiative Web site. "Hut the
current answer is also not an effective solution
to the problem."
Pomona President David Oxtoby wrote."l
support this initiative because it will allow our
colleges to engage in real education of our stu
dents about responsible use of alcohol, as well
as model moderate behavior.
"Treating college students as adults will
help them to make more responsible deci
sions," he concluded.
Castro noted that drinking-related prob
lems on campus have declined significantly in

recent years.a shift he attributes to an increase
in the University's alcohol education efforts.
For the past three years, incoming fresh
men have been required to complete a two
hour online alcohol education course called
AlcoholEdu. Castro said Stanford has also
stepped up alcohol training for residential
"We've seen some very dramatic changes
over the past four years," he said, citing a 67-
percent drop in on-campus medical transports
for alcohol-related reasons.
Asked about the potential effects of a low
ered drinking age on University policy. Castro
said,"There might be stricter rules in place."
"As an institution of higher education, our
first responsibility is to educate students." he
explained. Hut with a lower drinking age, and
an accompanying expectation that legal
drinkers abide by laws governing public be
havior. he suggested that Stanford might shift
its focus away from tolerant instruction to
ward enforcement and punishment.
Iliough pleased with the national media at
tention. Choose Responsibility has been frus

trated hv what it characterizes as a misunder
standing of the initiative's goals, and the
"staunch, knee-jerk response that it's re
ceived."
"It's not calling for a lower drinking age,
not calling for an 18-year-old drinking age."
Kronenberg said.
"It needs to be objective and fair." she said
of public discourse on the drinking age. "And I
don't think those adjectives are at plav right
now."
As of Sept. 15, chancellors anil presidents
from 130 universities and colleges remain sig
natories of the Amethyst Initiative. On Sept. 5,
the Women's Christian Temperance Union
(WCTU). which opposes lowering the drink
ing age, presented the Initiative with its Mill
stone Award, a dishonor intended to "bring
public awareness to a person, organization or
governmental body that creates or uses their
position of influence to promote unhealthy, il
legal, or immoral behavior that we believe
places children at risk."
