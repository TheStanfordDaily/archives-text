The Amethyst Initiative, a statement call
ing for open public discourse on the federal
ly mandated drinking age of 21, has been
signed by presidents from more than 130
American colleges and universities over the
past four months.
But Stanford won't be signing on.
President John L. Hennessy said in a
phone interview with The Daily that he is
"sympathetic" to the goals of the initiative
and would welcome debate on the subject of
the drinking age, but will not add himself to
the petition.
"1 think it is extremely unfortunate that
they moved forward without making a strong
statement about DUI laws," Hennessy said,
'it doesn't make sense to move forward
without that tie."
Ralph Castro, manager of the University's
Substance Abuse Prevention Program,
agreed that the initiative lacks necessary pro
visions.
"If they lowered it arbitrarily, it wouldn't
necessarily be effective in reducing high-risk
drinking," he said of the drinking age. "There
would have to be a lot of work on the front
end to get it down."
"The problem now," Castro continued, "is
we don't necessarily have standardized edu
cation for alcohol." I le suggested that a hypo
thetical lowering of the drinking age be ac
companied by a permit system akin to that
which exists for driving, including mandatory
education and a gradual increase in privi
leges.
Despite the problems pointed out by Hen
nessy and Castro, the initiative does seem to
be succeeding in its mission to foster public
debate on the drinking age.
"We're trying to get people to support the
general idea of debate." said Grace Kronen

sponsibility. the advocacy group behind the
statement."lt's an issue that most Americans
have seen as settled over the past 25 years."
she added, referencing the drinking age.
"Twenty-one is not working." reads the
statement. It calls for "an informed and dis
passionate public debate over the effects of
the 21-year-old drinking age."
In 1984, Congress passed the National
Minimum Drinking Age Act, mandating that
10 percent of allotted federal highway aid be
withheld from states setting a legal drinking
age of less than 21. In 1482. only 14 states
maintained a drinking age of 21. but by 1488,
every state had adopted that limit.
California is slated to receive $3.3 billion
in federal highway aid for fiscal year 2(KW.
Experts argue over the impact the in
creased drinking age has had on drinking be
havior among 18- to 20-year-olds. But propo
nents of the 21-year limit point to significant
