I A great lunch place/ A wine bistro that serves wines 1
made A cafe with a lot of California flair.
I Yes, the Alumni Cafe is all of the above and even has I
ft BBQ Fridays! Definitely a place to try once or twice, I
A but as the Cafe'S'a bit far from most of the dorms, M
it's not necessarily a hotbed of undergraduate
activity. Try a salad "or sandwich out on the
patio with a good friend at least
once this year.
