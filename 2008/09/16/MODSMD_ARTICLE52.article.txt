I had viewed some of Ruthie Arbeiter's amazing artwork just before our
interview, and as I asked about the central motif of her work, I anticipated her
reply: "Pugs. I adore anything related to them!"
Arbeiter '12 is an incoming freshman from Southern California, near San
Diego. She loves scuba diving, world cultures and, of course, art. Her road to art
started in pre-school with finger painting. As she recollected, "I just couldn t stop
doing it!"
Her realistic artwork centers on her trademark pugs. Arbeiter is drawn to the
strange juxtaposition of their awkwardness and their eyes, which are extremely
expressive and "shiny, as she said with a laugh. Its a sense ol humor that surfaces
in much of her artwork, a common theme that ties together a range of subjects she
explores. She said she enjoys incorporating ideas from her scuba-diving experi
ences, nature and Jewish heritage.
When asked what she looks forward to most at Stanford, Arbeiter didn t
even skip a beat.
"I'm most excited for meeting all these brilliant, exciting people," she said.
"I've been looking forward to Stanford ... it's hard to describe my excitement. 1
also want to share my writing and art with as much of the Stanford student body
as possible."
Arbeiter hopes to share her talents with as many people as possible. Her
greatest artistic achievement to date, after all, is a 60-foot mural painted tor her
former elementary school.
"It was so much work, but it was so rewarding," she said of the experience.
"If I ever got a chance to do something like that it d be a dream.

TWO QUESTIONS
What's your favorite place and why?
Stanford, with all the people there. I feel at home when
ever I visit. A lot of my family lives near San Francisco,
and my brother, my favorite person in the world, just
graduated from Stanford.
Think of yourself ten years from now in the most idealis
tic situation possible.
I'd like to be alive and preferably not starving!
Idealistically, I'd love to have art and writing as a career,
like a best-selling author, illustrator in children's books
or comedy. Or a screenwriter! I guess having successfully
made art and writing into a career somehow.

"So should I tell you more about myself?" Kevin's voice buzzed over my
speakers.
Thank goodness for technology. Through the computer, I managed to
interview Kevin 1 iardekopf, an incoming freshman who s been living in l - ranklurt,
Germany since the age of seven. Through the computer, he's also able to toggle
around with digital photography, one of his greatest interests.
"I love to travel. My hobby of taking pictures on vacation eventually
became my passion," said Hardekopf, who's been all over the U.S., Europe and
Dubai. "A picture's worth a thousand words,and you can express so much through
a photo. Only subtle changes in lighting and focus can influence the whole
impression of a photograph. 1 here are so many possibilities.
And so it would seem, as 1 lardekopl draws his inspiration from the myr
iad outdoors. Of the natural environments he's been in, he loves Maui the most.
Hardekopf deems it to be a photographer's paradise, and focuses a lot on taking
pictures of sunsets and tropical scenery. He also loves taking photographs of
weather.
"I storm chase," he said.
Though interested in geological and environmental sciences,
Hardekopf's interests also have a wider lens. He loves to cook, especially Asian
food.
"All the different spices," he said. "It's also an idea of being creative and
looking at stuff from different angles. And I never use any recipes."
Hardekopf also wants to participate in a range of activities at Stanford,
from polo to Students for Sustainable Stanford.

TWO QUESTIONS
What's your favorite and least favorite food?
Orange chicken — it's my favorite, yes ... I love
Asian food. Chinese, Thai ... sometimes Indian.
My least favorite is lamb. I don't like the taste of
lamb.
What are you most anxious or excited for at
Stanford?
Avoiding the Freshman Fifteen! And also, getting to
know all the people and the intellectual environ
ment.
