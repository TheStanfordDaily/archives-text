# "I gave it all I had so for what it's worth, I went from rags to riches which is a drag but now I'm first." — Ahmad Ali Lewis, "Back in the Day"

Ahmad Ali Lewis, 2010, Rap Artist
It was a little strange waiting for transfer student Ahmad Ali Lewis'lo to pick
up the phone. Chart-smashing rappers, after all, aren't really your everyday fare,
much less chart-smashing rappers about to enter one of the greatest universities in
the world. i
So it was a surprise to hear Ahmad's buttery lilt, sounding casual like he was/
just any other person. Even more surprising, however, was hearing Ahmad talk about
his roots.
"Probably one of the toughest neighborhoods in America," Lewis said of his
L.A. hometown. "A couple of drug houses on my street and gang members every
where."
Despite this — or maybe because of this — Ahmad grew up always trying to
take a different route: He was an honors student in high school. And unlike most
honors students, he didn't go to college. Instead, enamoured by hiphop as a teenag
er, he chose to work on his passion — rapping — and pursue a career in music.
"I love the fact that I'm able to directly communicate," Lewis said. "A lot of
other artforms are subjective, but with rap music I can say exactly what I want to say.
And people can understand the message and groove to it at the same time!"
The easygoing idea of grooving belies the drive beneath his music. At every
level, Lewis is pushed by a love for love he said. He's passionate about loving people,
seeing people love one another and watching people improve their lives through
love. Love is, after all, the subject of much of his rapping.
The theme also extends to his future Stanford career in his love for learning.
"I'm excited for the information, the knowledge and the wisdom that will be
imparted to me," Lewis crackled through the phone, the static unable to mask his
enthusiasm. "And I look forward to imparting my knowledge. I've had an interesting
road thus far. I'm older than the typical undergraduate, and I can maybe provide a
bit of insight about my life experience as a non-traditional student."
Lewis also wants to join a Barack Obama organization at Stanford, together
with other socially progressive movements. In his words, he is "a bit ot humanitari
an and a closet philosopher." After all, if he hadn't continued rapping, he would
probably have become a civil rights attorney.
"1 always wanted to get behind the veil," Lewis said, "and be a conduit for
change, empowering people by being empowered myself."

TWO QUESTIONS
What's your favorite place and why?
I guess anywhere my son is. Maybe at Long Beach City
College. We see wild rabbits all over the campus and
he feeds carrots to the rabbits.
What's your favorite and least favorite food?
1 love Mexican food. I don't know which dish. Maybe
fajitas [arc my favorite]. I don't eat beef, pork or
shellfish, so it probably would have to be chicken faji
tas. My least favorite has to be okra. I hate okra and
vegetables. It's so funny ... I used to be a vegetarian!

Mia Shaw, 2012, Cartoonist

Mia Shaw's blithcness was infectious over the telephone

"If I wasn't drawing or anything related, I'd probably be dead!" said the incoming
frosh, laughing. "Or I'd be stuck in my room doing jigsaw puzzles or something completely
unrelated."
Cartooning, after all, has been ingrained in Shaw's life since she was two. Shaw hails
from a small agriculture town in California. An only child, cartooning continues to be one of
her favorite "companions," perhaps because it too involves people.
"People-watching really gives me inspiration for the kind of characters I draw," she
said. "I'm also inspired by my environment, such as my city and landscape. Santa Cruz is def
initely a place that inspires me. I can sit at any cafe, really... there are lots of colorful and
interesting people! I'll make little sketches of them when they don't notice."
Shaw is, of course, a people person. At Stanford, she looks forward to meeting new
people with similar interests. One avenue, certainly, is the wide array of student groups.
"At Admit Weekend, I swear I signed up for like, 15 activities," she said,"so I'm gonna
have to limit myself!"
In particular, Shaw is excited about the Spoken Word Collective, whose Open Mic ses
sion she attended during Admit Weekend. She's also considering Amnesty International, which
she took part in during high school, and being an active member of the Black Student Union.
More than that, however, Shaw wants to discover herself. College, as she poignantly
concluded, "is a time for you to learn more about yourself and who you're gonna be in the
future."

TWO QUESTIONS
What's your favorite place and why?
People play a big part in the places I like. I'm a people person and I'm
really sociable. 1 can be anywhere and be in my own Utopia ... I can
spend hours in a friend's car and have the time of my life!
Think of yourself ten years from now in the most idealistic situation
possible.
I have no idea, so obviouslv I have to make this up! If I could have my
own way. I d be out of med school and residency. I d be a full fledged
adolescent psychiatrist on the East Coast and hopefully married, if I'm
not tied down to mv job. My husband would be a tortured artistic soul
with impeccable writing abilities!
