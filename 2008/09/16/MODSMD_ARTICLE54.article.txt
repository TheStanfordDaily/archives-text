Counterpoint — Stanford's only all-female a cappella
group, Counterpoint has been singing its pop/alt-rock
tunes and winning hearts with its casual playfulness and
black-white-and-pink outfits since 1979. Counterpoint
is soon to be celebrating 30 years of lovely ladies singing
killer songs.
Talisman — Talisman is the Stanford a cappella group
most focused on community service and enacting social
change through its music. Singing a vast repertoire of
African folk songs and African-American spirituals,
Talisman has performed for such visionaries as Nelson
Mandela, and has toured in countries as far away as
South Africa.
Testimony — One of only a handful of Christian a cap
pella groups on the West Coast, Testimony blends its
Christian rock and a cappella arrangements of tradi
tional hymns with skits and even testimonies of faith
from its members. The group is devoted not only to
musicianship and fun, but also to helping its communi
ty and spreading the Christian word to its fans.
Raagapella — Raagapella was founded a mere six years
ago to bring the sweet sounds of Southeast Asia to
Stanford. An all-male group, Raagapella (or Raag, for
short) has in those six short years performed all over
campus and on tours to the East Coast and India, has
released one album and in 2005 won the National South
Asian A Cappella Competition.
Fleet Street — In their snazzy tuxedos and signature red
bow ties the Stanford Fleet Street Singers (Named after
the infamous "Demon Barber of Fleet Street" from the
musical Sweeney Todd) have been bringing their mix
ture of barbershop classics and a cappella comedy to the
dorm lounges and auditoriums of Stanford since 1981.
Mendicants — Stanford's oldest a cappella group, the
Mendicants are the ones who started it all. In their long
and storied history, one thing has remained constant for
the Mendicants — their "boyish charm" and oldies pop
tunes have kept the ladies swooning.
Mixed Company— Back in the days when single-sex a
cappella reigned supreme, Mixed Company started the

Andrew Plan and Ampersand
I SATURDAY . 10 PM - 1 AM
Vice opens for The Ringers

AMPERSAND, a band of mixed interests,
specializes in the sounds of funk. They
came together in 2006 to keep the
Stanford campus upbeat and relaxed.
Ampersand is comprised of Andrew
Hung' 10 on guitar, applied physics grad
uate student jason Pelc on the keys, Peter
Berg *10 as the drum master and Jon
Merola '09 on the bass.
ANDREW PLAN '10 uses his lyrical skills
and acoustic guitar finesse to keep any
low-key crowd entertained and amused.
Plan is a clever wordsmith who often will
ask the crowd for a subject with which he
will compose an exceptional yet cheeky
song.

VICE is one of the best bands on campus.
Though they will be playing a bare bones
acoustic set this Saturday, when Grahame
Lesh '09 and Brodie Jenkins '09 come
together, they stimulate the mind and the
heart with an amazing combination of
acoustic riffs and Brodie's Grammy-wor
thy voice.
THE RINGERS' catchy beats are a combi
nation of the Beatles, the Killers and
Aerosmith. The music scene is buzzing
about this new L.A. rock band that will
keep your spirits up, your toes tapping
and your body dancing to fun and upbeat
rock.

co-ed revolution. Founded by a girl who auditioned for
Stanford's all-male groups and was told that her voice
was great but her equipment somewhat lacking,
MixedCo has gone on to develop a sexy and sassy per
sona, built on a repertoire of'Bos,'9os, and modern rock
and pop songs.
Harmonics — When the Harmonics were deciding on
their sound in 1987, they chose to go where no Stanford
group had gone before: into the world of hard rock.
Since then, the Harmonics have been head-banging
their way across the country, wowing audiences with
their vocal percussion and intricate arrangements of
such hits as "Bring Me to Life" and Metallica's "The
Memory Remains."
Everyday People — "I (hi hi-hi-hi!) am everyday peo
ple," is the refrain from Sly and the Family Stone's hit
song of racial harmony that inspired the founders of
Everyday People to start their a cappella group in 1987.
Bringing its message of diversity and integration to
campus through a blend of R&B, hip-hop and pop
music, Everyday People has delivered soulful sounds for
over 20 years.
Alliance Streetdance — Celebrating its l()th anniversary
this year, Alliance Streetdance is Stanford's hip-hop
dance troupe. An entirely student-led group that chore
ographs and performs its own dances, Alliance mixes
hip-hop traditions from all its members, combining
modern "pop-lock" dance with old-school styles and
much more.
Bent Spoon — A dance form based on precise yet free
flowing body movements, modern dance was epito
mized by the work of Martha Graham and Alvin Ailcy;
its rich tradition of narrative, expressive performance
lives on at Stanford through dance group Bent Spoon.
Stanford Wushu — Though Wushu literally means
"martial arts" in Chinese, in its performance form it
resembles more a killer tumbling routine than a fight to
the death — performers cross the stage doing jump
kicks and mind-boggling manipulations of spears and
staffs.

heels, while chugging a beer."
