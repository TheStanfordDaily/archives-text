The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao
lunot Diaz
Even at 355 pages, The Brief Wondrous
Life of Oscar Wao is a fairly quick read. Junot
Diaz keeps the narrative moving with snappy
dialogue and a suspenseful plot structure. At
the beginning of the novel, the reader witness
es the events that occur chronologically just
before the story's conclusion. Then, Diaz
transports the reader backwards through
time, sometimes describing events more than
once from the perspectives of different char
acters.
The novel isn't quite impossible to put
down, but comes close. Unfortunately, this
carefully crafted narrative does not reach a
satisfying resolution. Instead, Diaz inserts a
character who, in the words of another char
acter, may one day "take all we've done and all
we've learned and add her own insights and
[...] put an end to it." Perhaps this inconclu
sive resolution is more true-to-life, but it can
also come across as a simple cop-out by Diaz.
Also, despite the considerable appeal of its
poignancy and originality, the novel at times
degenerates into a rant on obscure politics
and becomes a largely inaccessible hodge
podge of different languages. The prevalence
of swearing, however, is recognizable in any
language, which some readers may find offen
sive.

One! Hundred! Demons!
Lynda harry
This graphic novel promises to be
unlike any other book you've ever read. Not
quite autobiography — because "parts of it
arc not true" — but not quite fiction —
because "parts of it are" — the story leaves
readers guessing at which parts are made-up,
which parts are true for Barry and which parts
are universal truths about the demons that
haunt us all. In the introduction, Barry relates
how she discovered the exercise of painting
demons in "a hand-scroll painted by a Zen
monk named Hakuin Ekaku, in 16th century
Japan." From there, the story becomes a scries
of short stories in graphic form, with the
young and old Barry reflecting on what
demons haunt her — anything from head lice
and dogs to girlness, dancing and her worst
boyfriend.
The 17 episodes arc entertainingly writ
ten and illustrated, though they occasionally
end on the strange note of Barry addressing
her readers with questions about the events
taking place within the narrative. For
instance, a story about children's comfort
objects, such as blankets or stuffed animals,
ends with Barry taking home a stuffed bear
from an airport after leaving her name and
phone number at the lost-and-found. She
writes, "I still have that panda. Is it yours?"
Also, like Diaz's novel, some dialogue takes
place in another language, which can make

parts of the story inaccessible to some readers.
Drinking Coffee Elsewhere
ZZ Packer
Novelist Zadie Smith captures what
makes these short stories truly great — "ZZ
Packer writes a short story with more com
plexity and kindness than most people can
muster in their creaking 500-page novels. It is
the kind of brilliance for narrative that should
make her peers envious and her readers very,
very grateful." The eight stories in "Drinking
Coffee Elsewhere, "mostly about the coming
of-age of young people, hit readers hard.
Though we're not bludgeoned to death upon
impact, we do walk away feeling a bit dazed
and wondering exactly what hit us. Packer's
dialogue is so natural and her narrative so
seemingly effortless as to lure readers into a
false sense of security.
Many of the stories are quite funny, a
sort of comic relief which acts as a counter
point to the seriousness of many of her char
acters, subjects and themes. But she doesn't
hold back in making her points about race,
religion, identity and human nature. Readers
will find it nearly impossible to shrink away
from at least a few of the various emotions
experienced by the characters in the stories —
loyalty, compassion, love, guilt, fear, responsi
bility and more. It is a testament to the power
of her writing that to experience these emo
tions alongside Packer's characters is to be
