# OFF CAMPUS REVIEW
## Spring Awakening tells haunting tales of teen angst 
### 
Set in late 19th century Germany,
Spring Awakening tells the story of young teen
Melchior Gabor and his peers and the univer
sal battle of adolescents against the authority.
The musical explores classic coming-of-age
themes like sexuality, death and general teen
angst in a very untraditional way. Though
dressed in traditional costume, the characters
project their innermost curiosities and fears
to the audience through songs — all of which
are inner monologues — modern choreogra
phy and rock concert-like lighting. The
dichotomy of a 19th century setting with 21st
century music and dance highlights the time
lessness of the show's subject: growing up is
never easy.
The set is minimal with faded framed
pictures and knick-knacks adorning the bare
brick backdrop. Several dozen chairs are set
up on either side of the stage, facing center,
like rows in a schoolhouse. Audience mem
bers arc seated among the actors in the chairs
on stage —an effort that creates a seamless
feeling, like viewers and players arc one and
alike. A chalkboard hangs with the musical
numbers written in chalk, and the band is up
on stage instead of in the pit. Bare light bulbs
hang from the ceiling, casting a cold, hollow
feeling about the stage.

From the First
number, it is clear that
Spring Awakening is by
no means a traditional
musical. Young,
impressionable Wendla
Bcrgmann (Christy
Altomare) opens the
show with "Mamma
Who Bore Me," while
performing odd, body
oriented choreography

that will be repeated throughout the show.
Four other school-age girls, all of varying eth
nicities, accompany the female lead for a
reprise of the song.
The scene quickly transitions to a
schoolroom at an all-boys institution where
the uniformed students arc reciting lines in
Latin. Despite the conservative dress, the boys
sport crazy hairstyles. Each player sings with a
hand-held microphone, head-banging and
jumping wildly under electric blue lighting as
they sing about the "Bitch of Living."
The protagonist, Melchior Gabor (Kyle
Kiabko) leads the audience and his friend, the
slightly deranged though harmless Moritz
Stielel (Blake Bashoff) in an exploration of
sexuality in the song "Touch Me." Though

the vital stats.
Spring Awakening V
Broadway Musical
CURRAN THEATRE, SF
through 10.12.2008

Riabko plays a slight
ly less studly
Melchior than
Jonathan Groban of
the original
Broadway cast, he
nonetheless adds his
own personality to
the role and is suc
cessful. Bashoff
shines in the troubled
shoes of Moritz,

making awkward faces and projecting intense
confusion and pain to the sympathetic audi
ence.
Supporting characters such as the
"Adult Women" (Angela Reed) and "Adult
Men" (Henry Stram) are integral minor roles.
Rotating between the position of a school
administrator, Wendla's mother, Melchior's
mother and a well-endowed piano teacher,
Reed injects small bits of comedy and at
times, moments of motherly sincerity into the
show.
Spring Awakening, though covering
many heavy topics, transitions perfectly from
sorrowful scenes to light, very comical scenes.
"Why am I haunted by the legs of a woman?"
Moritz asks Melchior. "My destiny may lie

between them!" The funny side softens the
overall darkness of the production, and adds a
comedic irony to the serious issues touched
upon throughout.
Writer and lyricist Steven Sater was
seen in the audience of the San Francisco
showing the reviewer attended. The show
received a very loud, very long standing ova
tion — one of the longest applauses the
reviewer has ever witnessed—and well
deserved, at that.
