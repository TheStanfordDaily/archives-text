## Bishil steps up as torn protagonist in "Towelhead" 
### 
It's the early 19905, and the first Gulf War is about to begin.
Jasira (Summer Bishil), a beautiful Lebanese girl, unwitting
ly catches the eye of her divorced mother's boyfriend. Gail
(Maria Bello) decides that Jasira should go to live with her
father Rifat (Peter Macdissi) in a Houston suburb.
Entering a new environment, Jasira finds both chal
lenges and temptations. Rifat is strict and violent, anxious for
acceptance by a white status quo but hostile towards it in his
interactions. No one at her school knows what to make of her,
and the racial acceptance of her community is lacking. When
her beauty and manner begin to attract attention, more prob
lems emerge. Her classmate Thomas (Eugene Jones) sees an
opportunity for love. Her neighbor Mr. Vuoso (Aaron
Eckhart) finds her exciting and dangerously irresistible. And
another neighbor, Melina (Toni Collette), has justified reason
for concern when the constellation of forces and pressures
around Jasira converge in some very bad ways.
In "Towelhead," Jasira grows up in unflinching detail.
The film's foremost concern is with the body, and watching
the film is appropriately a physical experience, full of squirms,
shocks and occasional mute terror. It is an uncomfortable
movie to watch. Bishil's portrayal enhances this, as she invests
Jasira with sympathy and exudes reasons to root for her.
Despite her efforts, with the difficult material, it's a tough role
to pull off. Jasira continually confounds expectations, includ
ing staying unnervingly calm during great upheaval. At times,
the movie runs the risk of an excessively passive lead, and it's
not helped in the least by the ambiguity of Jasira's moods,
thoughts and motivations. Jasira stays at a distance through
out, but it's an intentional one, and she never slips too far out
of reach to feel a connection.
Bishil's portrayal gives Jasira an endearing quality,
though elusive, and the film can rest on her shoulders. The
other characters orbit around her, and the group of veteran
actors around Bishil put in excellent supporting work. Eckhart
has a challenge in avoiding pure villainy, and he meets it.
Vuoso wears a facade of confidence as he veers between des
peration and something darker, and Eckhart realizes it expert
ly. Macdissi realizes Rifat with pitch-perfect consistency,

though he benefits the least from the film's hit-or-miss
comedic moments. Collette, meanwhile, provides a fierce
moral counterweight, sticking her neck out for Jasira where no
one else is willing.
With the territory "Towelhead" navigates, the mostly
sympathetic cast establishes a challenging moral situation. In
keeping Jasira at an unpredictable distance, it forces the view
er to empathize with those around her, for better or worse. As
a result, there are never easy answers. While Jasira never loses
our allegiance, her choices aren't unimpeachable, and the same
process of imposing upon and objectifying her might go on in
both the characters' minds and those watching. In keeping its
heart mostly with Jasira but ceding some of it to its rich cast of
characters, the film provides a mix of clear and murky bound
aries that is both enlivening and treacherous. Yet the story itself
never loses hope, nor a sense of right and wrong. By its close,
"Towelhead" hands this touching clarity to its embattled lead
for safekeeping — hard-earned and all the more treasured.
Having a heart might not seem remarkable, except for
the trail of failed projects that have attempted similar courses
and lost sight of any moral center. "Thirteen" spiraled into sen-

American cinema can't handle about young sexuality, this film
overcomes, and that's a real achievement. It unsettles without
exploiting, while remaining both honest and heartening. The
film has its intentions so much in the right place that a botched
execution would have been forgivable. Yet there is none to
speak of. It's a great film, and more importantly, it doesn't for
get to be good.
