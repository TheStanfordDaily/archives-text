ivith Alan Ball, director of "Towelhead "
The Daily sat down with director Alan Hall
in San Francisco earlier this month to talk
about his new movie. Read on for his
thoughts about making a low-budget
movie, what it's like to be a kid in an empty
house and political deja vu.
Intermission: I was extraordinarily
impressed at how [the film] dealt with
material that's incredibly difficult and made
a film that wasn't bleak at the same time.
I'm wondering if you had any thoughts

about how you tried to achievc something
that could still be in a way affirming and
uplifting while still dealing with a lot of
really terrible things.
AB: Well I have to tip my hat to Alicia Erian,
who wrote the novel, because she did all
that. All of that is in the novel, and one of
the things that I responded to [ in | the novel
was the fact that when it ended, it ended on
such a positive note — I didn't feel like
lasira had been destroyed, she wasn't
scarred for life. I felt like because she went
through this trauma with Mr. Vuoso she
was able to extricate herself from a violent
living situation with her father and sort of
take control of her body and her destiny for
the first time, and it was a real moment; it
ended on a real moment of strength and
hope, and it felt very organic — it didn't

feel like a cheesy, tacked-on Hollywood
happy ending.
Reading the book is like watching the
movie; you're so, like, uncomfortable, and
you're laughing at this thing but horrified at
this other thing; and then, when I, you
know, got to that very last page and 1 closed
it, and I felt this relief, and this hope, and
this optimism, and 1 thought, "How unusu
al for a story about an inappropriate sexual
interaction between an older man and a
younger girl." Because usually those stories
end with, "Well, she's destroyed."
i: This was your first film, and obviously
you had prior directing experience from
"Six Feet Under" [Ball's recently concluded
HBO series. | Were there any difficult
aspects to manage in the transition? "Six
Feet Under" is an HBO series, so it isn't

closed-set television in the way that many
people are used to, but in moving to a film
shoot were there any unexpected difficul
ties?
AB: Frankly, no. "Six Feet Under" was a
high-budget show in terms of television,
and "Towelhead" was an extremely low
budget film in terms of features, so it was
pretty similar terrain. There's always the
difficulties of "Can you get everything you
need in the amount of days that you've
been given?," but I really enjoyed working
with my producer Ted Hope, and the peo
ple at Indian Paintbrush really believed in
the project and they gave me a few extra
days when I went and groveled and said
"We're goirg to need a couple of extra
days, and everyone's been very supportive.
It was a struggle to get this movie made,
because every step along the way it seemed
like people were saying no. I mean, of course,
of course. Look at the material. I wrote the
script, I sent it out, all the studios said no, so
we had to find an independent financer. We
made the movie, we were trying to get into a
bunch of festivals, everybody said no. And
then Toronto said yes. We went to Toronto, we
were going to try to sell the movie and every
body said no. And then Warner Independent
said yes. It's been probably three and a half
years since I read that book. We started shoot
ing in September of 2006 — so it's been a bit
of a struggle. And then the release date kept
getting pushed back, and pushed back, and
pushed back. You know, everything happens
for a reason.
i: In terms of connecting with a lot of contem
porary issues, I mean, obviously, racism is
near the forefront, and America's still-emerg
ing attitude towards teen sexuality in general.
One of the most interesting threads through
the film was the presence of the first Gulf War,
especially when so many people are concerned
with the current war in Iraq. I've been myself

seeing a lot of films that have been attempting
to tackle that and are finding kind of mixed
success. Were you attempting at all to make
that a comment upon current events, with
that thread of that war, or was it something
where you were trying to avoid making that
too overt a connection?
AB: Well again, that was in the book. 1 appre
ciated it, and I love the fact that here we were,
17 years ago, 18 years ago, and America's at
war in the Middle East and people named
Bush and Cheney are calling the shots. It
seemed kind of surreal, and kind of tragic,
and if I think about it — because I don't think
about these things when I'm working, 1 don't
think about "Oh, this is symbolic of this" or
"This makes a comment on that" because my
process is way less calculated. But I think it is
calculated on a subconscious level. I just don't
think of those things, you know what I mean?
But I look at it now and I think it's definitely a
comment on this world where Jasira lives,
where these things happen, where men molest
young girls, where there is racism — even on
the part of people who themselves are victims
of racism — where there's a war in another
part of the world where really nobody in

America is being called upon to make a sacri
fice for, and it's just television entertainment.
That's all in the past. That should be in the
past. Of course I'm influenced by Obama's
speech last night, but I do feel that it's a silly
world that we should have grown beyond, and
I think in the course of the movie Jasira does
grow beyond it.
going to become unbearable.
i: Another thing I wanted to mention was the
suburban setting. Obviously this is something
that you've touched upon in prior work, and
very well. But, with this film in particular, and
this might have been a result of the budget,
there was a real sense of almost claustropho
bia among the confined spaces. Within a
house, for instance, you wouldn't get a long,
flourishing tracking shot that would show you
every room — it would be this room, and that
room, and no space between. What were you
aiming for with that, and what do you think
that added to the film?
AB: I was aiming for that feeling of empty
houses, that latch-key kids come home to.
When I was in junior high school, my mom
went back to work, and I would come home to

that empty house. And it was kind of great,
coming home to it, and it was also kind of
weirdly lonely. And the notion of children
alone in these houses felt really, I guess, you
know, I felt "I got it."
Certainly it was part of the budget,
too. We didn't really have a lot of budget for a
lot; we had so many pages we needed to shoot
each day. Actually the set, of Rifat's house, we
shot all the scenes that take place in Rifat's
house. And then we went to all our exterior
locations, while the art department took
Rifat's house and Hipped it and turned it into
Melina's house. It's the same set. And that
works great because all those track houses
kind of have the same floor plan anyway, but
they'll be inverted, or they'll have a different
thing. So that worked well for us. I think at
one point, lames Chinlund, the production
designer, came up to me and said, "Is it ok if
we put Melina's kitchen in the front of the big
room, instead of in the back, the way it is at
Rifat's?" I said, "That's weird. Why?," and he
said, "It'll save us all the money," and I said,
"OK, let's do it," because we made the movie
for about $14.
