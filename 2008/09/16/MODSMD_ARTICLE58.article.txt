ivith Alan Ball, director of "Towelhead "
The Daily sat down with director Alan Hall
in San Francisco earlier this month to talk
about his new movie. Read on for his
thoughts about making a low-budget
movie, what it's like to be a kid in an empty
house and political deja vu.
Intermission: I was extraordinarily
impressed at how [the film] dealt with
material that's incredibly difficult and made
a film that wasn't bleak at the same time.
I'm wondering if you had any thoughts

about how you tried to achievc something
that could still be in a way affirming and
uplifting while still dealing with a lot of
really terrible things.
AB: Well I have to tip my hat to Alicia Erian,
who wrote the novel, because she did all
that. All of that is in the novel, and one of
the things that I responded to [ in | the novel
was the fact that when it ended, it ended on
such a positive note — I didn't feel like
lasira had been destroyed, she wasn't
scarred for life. I felt like because she went
through this trauma with Mr. Vuoso she
was able to extricate herself from a violent
living situation with her father and sort of
take control of her body and her destiny for
the first time, and it was a real moment; it
ended on a real moment of strength and
hope, and it felt very organic — it didn't

feel like a cheesy, tacked-on Hollywood
happy ending.
Reading the book is like watching the
movie; you're so, like, uncomfortable, and
you're laughing at this thing but horrified at
this other thing; and then, when I, you
know, got to that very last page and 1 closed
it, and I felt this relief, and this hope, and
this optimism, and 1 thought, "How unusu
al for a story about an inappropriate sexual
interaction between an older man and a
younger girl." Because usually those stories
end with, "Well, she's destroyed."
i: This was your first film, and obviously
you had prior directing experience from
"Six Feet Under" [Ball's recently concluded
HBO series. | Were there any difficult
aspects to manage in the transition? "Six
Feet Under" is an HBO series, so it isn't

closed-set television in the way that many
people are used to, but in moving to a film
shoot were there any unexpected difficul
ties?
AB: Frankly, no. "Six Feet Under" was a
high-budget show in terms of television,
and "Towelhead" was an extremely low
budget film in terms of features, so it was
pretty similar terrain. There's always the
difficulties of "Can you get everything you
need in the amount of days that you've
been given?," but I really enjoyed working
with my producer Ted Hope, and the peo
ple at Indian Paintbrush really believed in
the project and they gave me a few extra
days when I went and groveled and said
"We're goirg to need a couple of extra
days, and everyone's been very supportive.
It was a struggle to get this movie made,
