The Office of Undergraduate Admission
is taking steps to add an element to its admis
sion process that has heretofore been con
spicuously absent — the alumni interview.
Dean of Admission Richard Shaw recent
ly announced a pilot alumni interview pro
gram that will offer optional alumni inter
views to 2008-2009 undergraduate appli
cants from Atlanta, Denver. London, New
York City. Philadelphia and Portland.
The six cities were chosen because they
offered an appropriate cross section of the
applicant pool, geographical area and alum
ni network.
The admission office cites three main rea
sons for the introduction of the pilot alumni
interview program: to personalize the admis
sion process for Stanford applicants, to add
additional information on applicants for the
admission office and to further engage alum
ni in the admission process.
"We want to take every opportunity to
put a face on Stanford so that the students we
really want have a harder time saying no to
us," Director of Admission Shawn Abbott
said in an email to The Daily. "And we also
want to make sure that the students we are
saying yes to are really the right students for
Stanford."
Alumni across the six pilot cities are
eager to participate in the new alumni inter
view program. Portland resident Steve Jew
ell '74, whose wife is also a Stanford alumna,
is enthusiastic and said the alumni interview
program will be beneficial for both the appli
cants and Stanford.
"I have gone to numerous send-off par
ties for newly admitted Stanford undergrad
uates, and I often hear students trying to de
cide between Stanford and other universities
saying that they have had more personal
contact with other universities that offered
interviews." Jewell said.
"Also, for students from the East Coast
who may have concerns about the move, an
alumni interviewer can answer questions

about the West Coast and assuage the fears
of students and their parents," he added.
"The alumni can be a goodwill ambassador
of sorts for the University."
Abbott too sees the pilot alumni inter
view program as a perfect extension of his
ongoing goal to engage alumni in the work of
the admission office.
"Alumni interviews are just one part of
our OVAL |Outreach Volunteer Alumni
Link] efforts." Abbott said. "We recognize
alumni as a great, largely untapped resource
for our office — especially in places far from
California, where we often don't have as
many local resources as our peers."
Abbott, however.emphasizes that the ad
mission office, not the alumni, will still be
making the admission decisions.
"Alumni will be able to play an important
role in corroborating the other information
we have in the admission file, as well as
bringing to light information that might not
otherwise be apparent in a written applica
tion." Abbott said. "[But] every final admis
sion decision rests with the admission com
mittee."
The admission office also emphasizes that
applicants not offered an interview will not
be at a disadvantage. Because the alumni in
terview is still a pilot program, less than four
percent of the applicants will be interviewed.
Furthermore, applicants from the six
cities can choose to not be interviewed,
though the admission office encourages
them to opt for an interview.
"The small size of the pilot allows us to
implement a rigorous, systematic evaluation
of each interview report," Abbott added. "In
the spring of 2009, we will analyze the hard
data and also survey the participants in the
interview process."
Logistically,admission will match eligible
students from one of the six pilot cities with
alumni volunteers, who will then contact the
student to arrange a time and meeting place
for the interview. Subsequently, the alumni
interviewer will write up and submit an in
terview report via the Internet to admission.
Each alumnus will interview anywhere from
three to five applicants between October
and March.
"We'd like alumni to approach their
meetings with applicants as less of a formal
interview and more of a conversation — a
back-and-forth exchange in which the alum-
