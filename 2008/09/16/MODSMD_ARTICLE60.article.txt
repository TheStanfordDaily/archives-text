# Roxy says drop your hometown honey and share the goods, girl

cc But I miss him soo much!" Ashley blubbers, smear
ing a new set of mascara-maturated tear trails across
her palid checks. "It's just so harcfi"
"I know, I know," I say, patting her quivering knee,

but you have to let yourself have fun sometimes.

It's your freshman year!"
"How can I have fun? I can't have fun.
Not without him!" Ashley throws herself

face down upon the bed. Sigh ...
Before she came to Stanford,
Ashley should have taken this wise piece i
of advice: Ditch the dreaded "hometown \

honey" (aka HTH). This romantic attach-

ment is so well known to college administrators
that they warn parents of freshmen to beware of

something they call the "turkey drop," where the son

or daughter heads off to the halls of higher learning still
locally besotted. When that relationship expires by
November 1, the ensuing breakup casts a pall over the
Thanksgiving holiday.
Who wants to be this predictable?
Sob, sob, sob ...
Ashley whines that she's madly in love, they've
been together for years, and he was her first...
Whatever. Believe me, Ashley, no reason is good
enough to stay attached. Why? Because you're smart,
you're talented, you're all the things that got you here. In
short, you've got the goods. Why keep them locked away
for nobody (not even your sweetie miles away) to enjoy?
For your sake as well as your peers' sake, don't let your

self go to waste!
Aaaaahuhhhhahuuhhhh!!!!
Flattery's not working. Hmmm .. . let's try
another approach.

Ashley, darling, you may want to believe
that you can still "browse" while in that long
distance relationship. You might not realize
\ that an enormous invisible sign saying

"Taken!" is dangling around your neck.
You just don't know when and where it's
going to go off.
Hhnhhh??
Okay, my last gasp effort... Ashley, you

nincompoop, look around you. Here you are

amid some of the most interesting people you'll meet
in your whole life. You may end up with your first love,

sure, but in the meantime, give yourself the opportuni
ty to grow. Shared experience is an amazing bond — it's
probably the basis of your HTH relationship. Well, guess
what? There are more and better shared experiences to
be had, if you only make yourself available.
So liberate yourself already! Severing the tie hurts,
but you will get over it. Way over it, 1 promise.
Hiccup, sniff...
Ashley dear, take a deep breath, and sing along
with me and Janis:
It's gonna feel too heavy, It's gonna weigh on you,
It's gonna feel just like a ball, ball, ball, oh daddy,
And a chain.
