## Univ. houses all guaranteed undergrads Housing director now focuses attention on winter quarter 
### RYAN MAC STAFF WRITER 
Fears that Stanford Housing would be
short on rooms for the year's start have been
appeased. Despite concerns following the
Draw that some students would be left with
out space on campus. Housing announced it
has accommodated all undergraduates who
qualified for guaranteed housing.
"There are still approximately 40 under
graduate students who are waiting for hous
ing compared with last year at this time when
we had 87 students waiting," said Sue Nunan,
director of housing assignments, in an email
to The Daily. "All but a few of these students
either applied late for housing or are out of
guaranteed years."
With guaranteed undergraduates having
been assigned campus housing, the housing
office now turns its attention to finding space
for those students who submitted late appli
cations or have exceeded their four years.
Housing reiterated its plans for using
Crothers Hall and Crothers Memorial in the
fall, and Xanadu in winter and spring.
For Rodger Whitney, executive director
and chief housing officer, a large concern will
be accommodating students during winter

quarter. He said off-campus housing will be
part of a contingency plan for these returning
students.
"We are developing a contingency plan to
possibly provide some off-campus housing as
an option to returning students." Whitney
said in an email to The Dailv.'if this addition
al housing is needed, students will be housed
close to campus in furnished apartments with
similar amenities and rates to what they re
ceive on campus."
Whitney also said these students will be
given "plenty of advance notice" if this option
is a choice for the winter waiting list.
In 2002 and 2003, some students were
moved to off-campus housing due to renova
tions in Branner Hall.
As for future developments, Whitney ex
plained the various proposals for undergrad
uate housing and uncrowding, summarized in
the University's Housing Master Plan
(HMP).The plan aims to simplify the Draw,
create additional all-freshman housing and
build or restructure residences for student
needs.
"The opening of Munger Graduate Resi
dences with 600 new graduate beds is the cat
alyst for the HMP," Whitney said. "This allows
us to renovate and convert the Crothers resi
dence halls to undergraduate use, gaining
nearly 400 spaces for the uncrowding initia
tive in the HMP for fall 2009."
Whitney also noted a Green Row I louse
of 50 beds is planned to help with the initia

tive, and will ideally be open and oceupied bv
2010.
Improvements for the Coming Quarter
Aside from making sure students have
been accommodated. Housing has imple
mented various renovation projects on exist
ing buildings.
"Over the summer, Student Housing has
been busy working to refresh, paint and make
major repairs to several residences," Whitney
said. "We believe returning students will no
tice how these projects have uplifted and
brightened many of the student residences."
Among these projects are the remodeling
of various kitchenson the Row, the repainting
of over one million square feet of housing and
the re-carpeting of various residences. He
also mentioned reproofing projects as a
means of decreasing energy costs, as well the
remodeling ot several bathrooms in Stern
Hall.
Whitney also detailed the new key card
pilot at Stern Hall, a program that could re
place all old keys and locks on undergraduate
housing within the next 18 months.
"Beginning Sept. 16, students in Stern will
use their regular SUID card to open the exte
rior doors of their house and other shared
common areas," he said. "We are glad to par
ticipate in this pilot program and believe that
this will increase our security in resi
dences."
Furthermore, Stanford has made
an initiative to move toward more
environmentally friendly practices.
According to Whitney, the upcoming
quarter will see a marked change to
ward a greener, more sustainable
campus.
"We will be providing bottles of
Method phosphate-free and

biodegradable laundry detergent
that is triple concentrated," the exec
utive director said. "We are using the
most efficient washers and dryers
available as part of our "Just I.ike
Home' free laundry program, 112 resh
men students will also be given CFL
light bulbs to use in their study lamps
when they arrive on campus."
"These are only three of the many
initiatives we have undertaken to as
sist students in incorporating sustain
ability into their daily lives," he
added.
