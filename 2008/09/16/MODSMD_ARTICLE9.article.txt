# STUDENT LIFE
## Academic Directors to be in every residence with freshmen 
### MEKE DING STAFF WRITER 
Starting this year.every freshman will have an Aca
demic Director (AD) in addition to academic advi
sors. peer mentors and student advising resources in
Sweet Hall.
Although this will not be the first year that the Uni
versity has implemented ADs. it will be the first year
that ADs have offices in every residence with fresh
men — Branner, Florence Moore, FroSoCo. Laguni
ta. Roble. Muwekma. Stern and Wilbur. ADs will also
be stationed in the South Row and Athletic Academ
ic Resource Center, in addition to a part-time AD in
Toyon.
"An Academic Director is a staff member within
the VPUE [Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion], in either the Office of Undergraduate Advising
and Research or the Freshman Dean's Office, and is a
full-time academic advisor with an advanced graduate
degree," said Vice Provost for Undergraduate Educa
tion Carol Porter in an email to The Daily. "Academic
Directors are an accessible resource with a compre
hensive understanding of the University, knowledge
of the curriculum across undergraduate degree-grant
ing schools (humanities and science, engineering, and
earth sciences), familiarity with faculty and staff
across campus, and an understanding of academic
rules and regulations."
One specific role of ADs will be to aid students
who have missed academic deadlines or who are peti
tioning for exceptions to University regulations. ADs
can work with colleagues in Residential Education
(Resident Fellows. Resident Deans. Resident Student
Affairs Specialists), the office of Accessible Educa
tion, the Registrar, Vaden, Financial Aid and others in
order to advise students.
However, the AD will not be a replacement for ad
vising resources already in place. Rather, University
administrators hope ADs will complement those re
sources.
"The AD role complements the intellectual men
toring role of the student's primary academic advi
sor," Porter said. "We understand that faculty and ac
ademic staff cannot be expected to know many of the
'nuts and bolts' that are a necessary component of ac
ademic advice, nor should they have an exhaustive
knowledge of courses across the curriculum."
Still, ADs will participate in weekly VPUE meet
ings with faculty across the entire University in order
to maintain familiarity with the curriculum.
The expansion of student access to ADs was moti
vated by a number of factors. Porter said that in Stan
ford's last re-accreditation review in 2(X)2,the Western
Association of Schools and Colleges Accreditation
Committee recommended that the University intro
duce more full-time academic advisors who are famil
iar with the ever-expanding curricular offerings for
undergraduates. In addition. Porter said another rea
son for the expansion was dissatisfaction — much of

which came from parents — with academic advising.
Porter said she hopes the expansion of the AD pro
gram will create long-term advising relationships with
students based on familiarity and trust. Specifically,
she believes this will be possible through more infor
mal interactions between students and ADs within a
residential setting.

"ADs provide a
particularly wide range of
information and guidance
to students."

CAROL PORTER, VPUE

"While informal collaboration between residential
staff and advising has existed at Stanford for a long
time, our advising center, now UAR [Undergraduate
Advising and Research),didn't have an ongoing pres
ence within the residences to provide guidance to and
engagement with students,and to provide a channel to
the vice provost with direct information about the un
dergraduate experience," she said.
Porter said the preliminary survey data from last
year's students about the effectiveness of ADs has
been promising.
"We learned from this research that ADs 'provide
a particularly wide range of information and guidance
to students,'" she said.
According to Porter, topics students discussed with
their ADs included University policies and proce
dures, selecting courses, choosing a major, short- and
long-term academic planning, short- and long-term
career planning, research opportunities, overseas
study opportunities, pre-med, fellowships and grants,
graduate school, academic difficulties, personal goals,
personal problems and "life plans."
"Overall, students' descriptions indicated that
ADs are 'highly accessible, approachable, and espe
cially proactive in establishing and maintaining con
tact with students," she said.
Porter said the changes in the AD program will
hopefully continue after this year. For upperclassmen
who may feel left out. Porter noted that ADs are avail
able to help any student seeking advice.
