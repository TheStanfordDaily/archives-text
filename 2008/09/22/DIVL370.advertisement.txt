English literature abounds with references to the Bible that register not only the cultural and religious
significance of the text, but also its power and beauty as literature. This course will focus on its literary
qualities, reading selections from the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament with attention to form, style,
structure, themes, and the historical circumstances of the text's composition. (MW 1:15-3:05)

The affective investments of medieval texts have been widely acknowledged, but little studied. Students in
this class will discuss the status and function of emotion, as well as imagination, its common companion, in
medieval religious literature (The Book of Margery Kempe, Julian's Revelations, Pearl), non-religious literature
(Chaucer's Book of the Duchess, Clerk's Tale), and philosophy (Aristotle, Aquinas). (T 3:15-6:05)
