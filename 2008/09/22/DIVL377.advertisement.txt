Across global cultures, magic, science and religion constitute predominant modes of human thought. Such §jj?
modes have long fascinated scholars as they produce rituals and technologies that distinctively mediate jj|g
g® between human, natural and/or spiritual worlds, and sustain complex tensions between belief and 5S|
g-jg observation, and tradition and change. This course critically examines the ways in which we think, and |j|B
gg presents an archaeological approach to the study of magic, science and religion by debating how dominant jsdjj
Ss modes of thinking arise and change, and exploring how human thought has a particular taste for the jg|
concrete —that is, how it requires and engages the material worlds of objects, bodies, and assemblages. gx

pi UNDESIRED BODIES: LABOR MIGRATION, THE NATION STATE, AND GLOBALIZATION g|
£& Who picked the tomatoes you bought in the supermarket? Who ground the meat in your hamburger? Who
SiS built the neighbors' new house? In the U.S. and many other countries, jobs like these - jobs that are dirty,
gg difficult, and dangerous - are performed by transnational migrant workers, many of whom are
gg undocumented or "illegal." In this seminar we will learn who are these people, where do they come from,
Sg what part do they play in national and international economies and politics, and why their presence is so
contested. Together we will explore the ethical, political, and economic dilemmas that labor migrants gg
JB|> pose to nation states. j£%

30 percent of the population in the Middle East is between ages 15 and 29, the largest proportion of youth Igii
gg in the region's history. What do we know of their world? This course investigates the experiences,
gjg aspirations, and politics of youth in the Middle East. From heavy metal to masculinity, coffee shops to im
Rg conscription, we will consider the cultural forms and social practices that configure their everyday lives.

0 ECOLOGY, NATURE, AND SOCIETY: PRINCIPLE IN HUMAN ECOLOGY
As human populations continue to increase and natural resources become increasingly scarce, it will be
I® crucial to construct wise and effective management plans. The best way to become well-informed is to &&
g|a understand both past and present ecology and human behavior. This course is designed to guide students ei&
Sjg with at least some social science background through the field of human ecology using a combination of wdk
lecture, group projects, discussion and activities. If you are interested in the history of human
fig relationships with their environment, want to shape public policy, or be an informed world citizen you
o£j will not want to miss out on this course! ||g
