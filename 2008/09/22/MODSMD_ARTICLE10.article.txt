## EDITOR'S WELCOME 
### 
r J Ihis is an accident seven years going.
It's been that many years since I was sit
ting in my high school counselor's office, try
ing to figure out my freshman-year schedule.
World Geography and Journalism 1 were
the only options I had left to fill my random
fourth-period slot.
"Geography? 1 did that all of middle
school. I won every single game of Around
the World in seventh grade. I don't need that.
"And journalism? I read the paper — I
don't need to write it."
But what I really needed was a class. So. I
took the one that seemed less boring. And
yes, it was Journalism 1.
Yet as I write this editor's welcome just
over seven years later, it seems like it could
n't have been that simple. Whatever I
thought during those 60 seconds in my coun
selor's office defined the rest of my high
school career, Stanford career and — dare I
say it — maybe even my actual career.
And whatever you want to call it — an
accident, fate,serendipity, but hopefully not
a mistake — it's changed me. Despite my
three-year Key Club presidency, I don't
think I would have got into Stanford with
out being editor in chief of The Nexus. De
spite my talkative demeanor, I don't think I
would have the great friends 1 do now if it
weren't for late nights at The Daily office
and talking about The Daily (and what it
covers) almost nonstop (yes, it annoys my
non-Daily friends, but we are still friends).
And I sure wouldn't be sitting in this chair,
preparing for a long night and a long haul as
editor in chief, if it weren't for that hole in
my schedule.
An accident seven years going, and it all
seems to have led up to this, my volume as
editor in chief.
This,however,isn't something I'd be will
ing to call an accident. While I may have
thought just a year ago that being editor in
chief was too much work for me and journal
ism wasn't really my thing (yep. the accident
had its moments of doubt), I'm here in the
office, resolved to having a great volume, a

great paper and a great time making it.
How am I going to do that? I'm going to
make sure that every issue gets the attention
it deserves — from every comma and hy
phen to every big-picture news story. I'm
going to ask for the best work from our staff
— as far as Treehouse food and coffee will
drive them. And I'm going to reach out to
the rest of campus to truly make this paper
The Stanford Daily, an independent publica
tion that serves, writes about and speaks for
the Stanford community.
At the same time. I'm going to ask you to
reach for that copy ofThe Daily each day —
or check us out at stanforddaily.com — and
get a sense of what's happening on campus,
who has a story to tell and, of course, what
happened in the football game. I'm going to
ask you to let me know what you think: email
eic@daily.stanford.edu. call (650) 725-2100,
ext. 501 or stop by our office in Storke Pub
lications Building (soon to change, I should
note, when we move to a new building next
to Old Union in the coming months). And
lastly, I'm going to ask for you to get in
volved. to respond, to react and to take ac
tion.
Basically, I'm looking to make these next
few months seem like no accident at all for
you and I — like what happens and gets re
ported each day is all a part of something
bigger, a part of our lives and a part of histo
ry-
After seven years, I think I've learned
that the best accidents are the ones you take
control of — the ones that you don't just let
pass without working on or getting the most
out of. After all, seven years —or four
months as editor in chief — is a long time to
be lookine back on as an accident.
