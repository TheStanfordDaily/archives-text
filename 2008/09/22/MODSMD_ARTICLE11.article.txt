## An ode to transfers 
### 
Transfer students deserve some fucking
respect. Everyone is excited about the
freshmen,and as an RA in an incredible
all-frosh dorm (woo. Burbank!). I'm no excep
tion. But it seems like not enough people give
a shit about transfers. I usually don't cuss this
much, especially in writing that could be on
the Internet forever. But at the NSO Three
Books talk. I was deeply impressed with
Pulitzer Prize winner Junot Diaz's ability to
swear frequently and emphatically in front of
thousands of people. When he did. the audi
ence seemed to think he was cool, and more
importantly, they listened. So I m swearing for
emphasis — because transfers do matter —
but I also hope you'll think I'm cool.
Does transfer students seem like a random
subject? After all. there are 1,700-plus amaz
ing new freshmen and only 22 transfers start
ing classes here this year. Are they really that
important to the Stanford community? Hell
fucking-yes.
Getting into Stanford is hard. The normal
undergraduate acceptance rate is hovering
around single digits and high-school students
everywhere are panicking. In some ways
we're united by that common bond: one way
or another, we all did it. It's normal to be in
awe of all the ridiculously impressive things
our peers here have done and continue to do.
Olympians, scientific prizewinners, published
authors, whatever. You know these people ...
the ones that make you intensely proud and
insecure at the same time.
Transfer students face an even more in
tense process and face equally, if not more,
scarily talented classmates. According to the
admissions office, the acceptance rate for
transfers is between one and two percent, and
it has been for the last several years. The ad
mitted transfer students have to be beyond
ridiculous. Not only do they need good high
school credentials to back them up. but while
lots of students were slacking off and going
crazy freshman year, they had to be kicking
ass in the classroom and be active outside of it.
I'm not a transfer student, but it isn't hard
to see why they deserve recognition, and not
just for surviving an insane pool of transfer
competition. Imagine showing up at NSO in
the midst of 1.7(X) super-hyper 18-year-olds.
While they are drunk (figuratively, of course)
on sudden unfettered personal freedom,
transfers might feel old. awkward, out of place
or even jealous that these kids are getting
their freshman year at Stanford in a way that
they never can. no matter what your degree
sayk Does Kimball even have a dorm cheer?
To make matters worse, introducing your
self as a transfer student is hard. Simply saying
it out loud to someone you just met, a few of
mv transfer friends have explained, some

times gets a similar reaction to "Hi. I'm in
SLE." There's that moment before the re
spondent can control his facial reaction that
says, "Oh. why didn't you make it the first
time? Something must be wrong with you."
SLE kids, by the way, don't deserve that eye
brow twitch either. For those of you who al
ready treat transfers and SLE kids like the
normal people they are, I salute you.
Again. I'm not a transfer student.but I love
them. They had to want to be here so badly
that they faced up to odds that would make
most sane people turn and run.That burning
desire to be a part of Stanford is a large part of
what makes them awesome. Trust me, these
are students you want to know. All that ass
kicking they had to do to get here? They bring
it.and it shows. Two of Stanford's three
Rhodes Scholars last year were transfer stu
dents,and I seriously doubt it was coincidence.
One transfer friend of mine made such an
impression at Stanford that the University
paid for his (light back from Santiago, where
we were studying last spring, to receive an
award for academic excellence. Another spent
years trying to learn English well enough to
succeed in college, and after several rough
starts eventually headed to Foothill Commu
nity College just because he heard there was a
slight chance you might be able to transfer to
Stanford. He made it.and he's now one of the
oldest and happiest seniors I know.
Transfer students love Stanford as much
and probably more than the average under
grad.Thev cheer loudly and set an example of
how to take advantage of everything this uni
versity has to offer. And at least compared to
me, they are more organized, motivated and
mature.
Many of us will be successful in some way
after college, but if you want to meet incredi
ble students, have a great discussion or just
shallowlv hedge your bets that you'll someday
have a famous friend, get to know a transfer or
two. They deserve a genuine welcome.

Michael will be writing a yet-to-be-titled column
with Sugar DoshL They encourage you to con
tact them with titles at
sagarandmichael@gmail.com, especially if
you re one of the transfers to whom the above
ode was written. And swear a lot in your e-mail.
Shit.
