## CARDINAL CONQUERS Swarming defense and powerful running from Toby Gerhart are key in 23-10 victory over Spartans 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
We're only four games into the 2008 sea
son, hut it's already becoming clear who the
go-to guy is on this Stanford football team:
lucky No. seven.
Wearing John Elway's old number on
his chest, sophomore running back Toby
Gerhart pounded away at the San Jose
State defense, while Stanford defenders ha
rassed the Spartans offense, recording eight
sacks and applying constant pressure on
Saturday. The Cardinal scored 23 unan
swered points in a 23-10 home victory.
Gerhart wore away the Spartan defense,
rushing for I4K yards on 22 carries. His
touchdown in the game's final minute
sealed the deal for Stanford, which moved
to 2-2(1-1 Pac-10) on the season.
For Gerhart, it was only a matter of time
before the Stanford offense got the upper
hand in the game.
"We just kept pounding it."he said. "We
knew something would eventually break
open."
The Cardinal defense, collectively, was
the other star of the game.
Though Spartan quarterback Kyle Reed
finished the game with 165 yards on 23-for
-26 passing, the San Jose State offense was
stifled in the second half. The Spartans did
not score a single point in the game's last 3<S
minutes and finished with only 2l l ) total
yards to Stanford's 363.
"I feel our defense coming," coach Jim
Harbaugh said. "So many players played
really well. I feel 'em."
"You can definitely see the confidence
building," he continued. "[We had] eight
sacks, [forced] two turnovers. Iliat's big.
Iliat's what we want to see from the de
fense. We did a great job of mixing it up."

GAME NOTES: Stanford (2-2,1-1 Pac-10) finished
with the game's last 23 points, shutting out the Spar
tans in the second half. Though Spartan quarterback
Kyle Reed completed 23 of 26 passes, San Jose
State was held to a mere 219 yards for the game.
Kicker Aaron Zagory had a career game, going 3-
for-3 and converting from 52 yards out to give Stan
ford the lead in the third quarter.

It was a tale of two halves for the Cardi
nal. who did not take the lead until a 52-
yard field goal by senior placekicker Aaron
Zagory made the score 13-10 with two min
utes remaining in the third quarter. Zagory
finished the day 3-for-3. also converting on
37 and 24-yard tries.
The Spartans jumped out to a 10-0 lead
in the first half, as Reed was nearly flawless
against the Cardinal defense. Hie San Jose
State junior started the game off with 15
straight completions and finished the half
with yards on 16-for-17 passing.

The athletic quarterback ran the Spar
tans' spread option attack with running
back Yonus Davis, who ended the hall with
42 yards on six carries.
Stanford couldn't get much going on of
fense, as even the team's biggest play of the
hall counted for nothing. Sophomore wide
out Doug Baldwin broke a tackle and made
his way to the end /one for a 38-yard touch
down reception — or so he thought.
Officials reviewed the play and deter
mined that a Spartan defender had
knocked the ball out of Baldwin's hands

into the end zone, just moments before the
Cardinal receiver crossed the goal line.The
play was ruled a touchback and San Jose
State took over at the 20. its 10-0 lead intact.
It was the second time in two weeks that
Baldwin had a touchdown called back by
instant replay.
Stanford was able to get back in the
game in the half's final minute, however,
when Pritchard scored on a one-yard boot
leg after leading the Cardinal on a 10-play.

64-yard drive.
That score was all Ihe momen
tum that the team would need, as
Stanford dominated the second half
on both sides of the ball.
"We didn't need to change any
thing," redshirt junior quarterback
Tavita Pritchard said. "We knew we
needed to come out and just execute
better."
Pritchard had his biggest passing
game of the young season, throwing
for 159 yards on 13-for-28 passing.
He also rushed for 40 yards, 25 of
them coming on a broken play
where he recovered a pass deflected
by a San Jose State lineman before
scurrying down the sideline for a
chunk of yards.
"It wasn't intentional. 1 promise."
Pritchard later joked.
Pritchard's main targets were
Baldwin, who finished the game
with 49 yards receiving, and junior
receiver Richard Sherman, who
caught three balls for 33 yards.
"He did a heck of a job." Har
baugh said of the quarterback. "I'm
pleased with Tavita and his perform
ance. He came up big in a big game.
Make no mistake about it — this
was a big game."
The victory was important in
deed. as the 2-2 Cardinal looks to
stay afloat with a slew of road games
and tough opponents left on its
schedule. Stanford will next be in ac
tion this Saturday, when it travels to
Washington to face the winless
Huskies.
NotesrSaturday's game drew
33,293, with a couple thousand of
the San Jose State contingent mak
ing their presence felt after big plays
from the Spartans.
Pritchard's rushing touchdown in
the first half was the first of his ca
reer. "It feels great," he said. "I did
n't know what to do when I scored
it."
Though the Cardinal got off to a
slow start, not getting a first down
until there was a minute left in the
first quarter, it took care of business
when it mattered. Stanford was 6-
for-13 on third downs for the day,
while the Spartans were a mere 3-
for-13.

64-yard drive.
That score was all Ihe momen
tum that the team would need, as
Stanford dominated the second half
on both sides of the ball.
"We didn't need to change any
thing," redshirt junior quarterback
Tavita Pritchard said. "We knew we
needed to come out and just execute
better."
Pritchard had his biggest passing
game of the young season, throwing
for 159 yards on 13-for-28 passing.
He also rushed for 40 yards, 25 of
them coming on a broken play
where he recovered a pass deflected
by a San Jose State lineman before
scurrying down the sideline for a
chunk of yards.
"It wasn't intentional. 1 promise."
Pritchard later joked.
Pritchard's main targets were
Baldwin, who finished the game
with 49 yards receiving, and junior
receiver Richard Sherman, who
caught three balls for 33 yards.
"He did a heck of a job." Har
baugh said of the quarterback. "I'm
pleased with Tavita and his perform
ance. He came up big in a big game.
Make no mistake about it — this
was a big game."
The victory was important in
deed. as the 2-2 Cardinal looks to
stay afloat with a slew of road games
and tough opponents left on its
schedule. Stanford will next be in ac
tion this Saturday, when it travels to
Washington to face the winless
Huskies.

the San Jose State contingent mak
ing their presence felt after big plays
from the Spartans.
Pritchard's rushing touchdown in
the first half was the first of his ca
reer. "It feels great," he said. "I did
n't know what to do when I scored
it."
Though the Cardinal got off to a
slow start, not getting a first down
until there was a minute left in the
first quarter, it took care of business
when it mattered. Stanford was 6-
for-13 on third downs for the day,
while the Spartans were a mere 3-
for-13.
