# Card does dirty work in victory
## Stanford wins battle up front over Spartans with Gerhart, Zagory 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
There is an age-old,great football adage that
goes something like: "Games are won and lost
in the trenches."
Toby Gerhart's back and Aaron Zagory's
right leg may beg to differ, but once the Cardi
nal was able to assert itself on the defensive
line, the San Jose State attack ceased to exist.
In the first half of Saturday's 23-10 win over
the Spartans. Stanford had trouble containing
San Jose State's spread offense. Quarterback
Kvle Reed completed all but one of his passes,
and both Brandon Rutley and Yonus Davis
were able to create plays on the ground. By uti
lizing the entire field, the Spartans were able to
keep the Cardinal pass rush at bay — theoreti
cally, over-eagerness by the defensive front
could have left one of its opponent's weapons
open; at times in the victory, over-pursuit hurt
the Cardinal against both the pass and the rush.
And so, for the first half, the Spartans large
ly controlled the tempo of the game and were
able to put the first 10 points of the contest on
the board, going into the locker room at the
halfway mark with an improbable three-point
lead.
But when the Cardinal trotted out for the
final two quarters, the game plan seemed to
shift. Adjustments were made to the pressure
schemes that allowed the Cardinal to be ag
gressive without opening itself up to the big
play. Instead of just the front four rushing the
quarterback, Stanford utilized a zone blitz that
had linebackers and defensive backs sent up to
the line.
"They manned up and blitzed," Reed said.
"They did a lot of things— I feel their defen
sive coordinator did a hell of a job with the
game plan. I tip my hat off to them."
The Spartans' offensive line had no answer
for the new pressure schemes. Stanford's de
fenders began finding their way into rifts along
the line, and Reed barely had enough time to
set his feet, much less find his targets.
"Our pass protection completely broke
down," said San Jose State head coach Dick
Tomey.
Likewise, SJSU's rushing attack vanished as
more Cardinal stacked the box. Redshirt fresh
man defensive end Tom Keiser. who sacked
Reed on consecutive plays in the fourth quarter,
credited better tactics against the run for the
Cardinal's overall defensive success.
"We really did have a good thing
going stopping the run."he said. "We
made a few little adjustments at half
time and were able to make stops.
We just wanted to stop the run and
put them in position where they had
to try longer passes."
Reed never had the luxury of
looking more than a few yards down

field for very long — a horde of Car
dinal defenders was routinely in his
face. Six of Stanford's eight sacks
came in the second half.
The Cardinal defense wasted no
time getting to work. Senior defen
sive ends Tom McAndrew and Pan
nel Egboh sacked Reed on the Spar
tans' first drive of the third quarter.
Eghoh's takedown was an emphatic
hit that sounded across Stanford Sta
dium. The tone was set.
Keiser's two takedowns forced a
three-and-out more than halfway
through the fourth quarter, and
though San Jose State only trailed by

three points at the time, they were ef
fectively knocked out of the game.
The Spartans lost 10 offensive yards
in the fourth quarter and only man
aged 38 total yards in the second half.
The smash-mouth style was a suc
cess and certainly a blueprint for the
future play of this defense.
"We made it our goal to not only
run to the ball, but make a hit when
we got there," Keiser said. "That was
a point of emphasis. We really went
out there looking to hit people."
