17. It was an easy and comfortable win for
the Cardinal, with no single player posting
hugely impressive numbers.
Sophomore Alix Klineman led the team
with eight kills, hitting at a .300 clip. Seniors
Cynthia Barboza and Foluke Akinradewo
each added seven kills apiece and sopho

added 12 digs for her fourth double-double

how we responded, how tough we were
when we had to be."

.092. the fifth match in a row and seventh

a row heading into the conference season.The
Pac-10 again looks to be a tough challenge for
Stanford this year, with five of the confer
ence's teams ranked among the top 10 in the
nation. Perennial powerhouses USC, UCLA.
Cal and Washington have reloaded and are
ready to make a run at denying Stanford its
third Pac-10 title in a row. Still, the Cardinal is
confident in its chances to defend its crown.

es that we play," Lichtman said. "We are get
ting in more of a rhythm on the court.

ning said. "We need to get better and we
are."
