## Dolphins' Brown has five TDs in surprise win over Patriots 
### HOWARD ULMAN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — Ronnie Brown
and the lowly Miami Dolphins ended the Pa
triots' record winning streak and made New
England's defense look as shaky as its Tom
Brady-less offense Sunday. Brown scored a
team record four touchdowns rushing and
threw for another — with four of the scores
coming on direct snaps to the running hack
— as Miami stunned New England 3K-I3
Sunday.
Flic loss ended the Patriots' NFL mark of
21 straight regular-season wins that began
after a 21-0 loss to the Dolphins on Dec. 10,
2006 in which Brady was sacked four times.
It also ended New England's chance for a
second straight unbeaten regular season.
The Dolphins, who lost their first 13

games last year and finished 1-15, won for
just the second time in 22 games. It was the
first victory for first-year coach Tony Spara
no, and it was a stunner.
The Patriots kept getting fooled by the
same trickery: six direct snaps resulting in
four touchdowns after the Dolphins didn't
use the play in their other two games.
And New England didn't have Brady to
lead a winning comeback as he's done 28
times in the fourth quarter. They had to rely
on Matt Cassel and an offense missing run
ning back Laurence Maroney with a shoul
der injury, and that was far from enough.
Brown gained 113 yards on 17 carries and
the Dolphins outgained the Patriots 461
yards to 216.
Cassel completed ICJ1 C J of 31 passes for 131
yards with one touchdown, one interception
and a lost fumble. Miami's ( had Pennington

went 17-for-20 for 226 yards.
Both New England (2-1) and Miami (1 -2)
have changed dramatically sinee last season.
Brady was lost for the year with a knee in
jury in the first quarter of the opener, and
Cassel made his first start since high school
in a 19-10 win at the New York Jets. P en -
nington is one of 27 Dolphins who were not
on the team at the end of last season.
After the Dolphins punted on their first
series, the former Jets quarterback led them
on drives of 74, 79 and 77 yards, ending in
Brown's touchdowns of 2, 15 and 5 yards.
The Patriots managed just two field goals by
Stephen Gostkowski, covering 37 and 44
yards, and trailed 21-6 at halftime.
The Patriots got tricked again when
Brown took another snap, rolled out and
threw a left-handed pass to Anthony Fasano
for a 19-yard touchdown as Miami opened a

28-6 bulge in the third quarter.
Cassel then threw his first touchdown
pass of the year in 11 quarters of play when
he connected with Jabar Gaffney for 4 yards.
The Dolphins got that back with a big,
and familiar, play: a direct snap that Brown
carried 62 yards to the final touchdown.
Miami even had the edge on pregame
trash talk.
On Wednesday, linebacker Joey Porter
said beating the Patriots without Brady
"shouldn't be that hard."Then Porter made
the play that would set the tone for the game
when he sacked Cassel for a 5-yard loss on a
first-and-goal play at the 7.The crowd booed
Porter.
On the next two plays, Cassel was sacked
by Phillip Merling and threw an interception
to defensive end Randy Starks that set up
the first touchdown drive.
