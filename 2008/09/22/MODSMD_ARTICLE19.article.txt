## K-Rod for MVP: Why not? 
### 
Francisco "K-Rod" Rodriguez recently
broke Bobby Thigpen's 18-year single
season save mark. But, he may not be
done breaking records yet.
By the end of the season, K-Rod could be
the first closer to win the Most Valuable Play
er Award since Dennis Eckersley in 1992.
An MVP relief pitcher? For three outs in
a game? Blasphemous, no?
For the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.
Frankie is more than three outs. He's more
than just a relief pitcher. And the numbers
tell the story.
Despite owning the best record in the
league at 96-59, the Angels have a meager
+75 run differential. In contrast, the NL-lead
ing Cubs have a +184 run differential, more
than twice that of the Angels.
Simply put, the Angels are an offensively
challenged squad. Even with the likes of
Vladimir Guerrero, Mark Teixeira and Torii
Hunter, the Angels simply do not have a run
churning offense, which leads to close string
ing games.
According to the Pythagorean Theorem
of baseball, which translates run differential
into expected wins and losses, the Angels
should only have an 86-69 record, meaning
something has gone very right for them. And.
that something is K-Rod.
Despite their relatively anemic offense,
the Angels have gone an amazing 58-28 in
one- or two-run games for a 0.674 winning
percentage. Of these 58 wins, Frankie has
saved 48 of them, accounting for 80 percent
of his saves — he certainly hasn't been cheat
ed on his saves.
Right now. K-Rod has 60 saves and count
ing. which means of the 96 Angel victories,
Frankie has had his say in two out of every
three wins. Though his job is to get the final
three outs of the game, the season has been
much more difficult for K-Rod. K-Rod has
saved three consecutive games five times this
season, and has averaged 13 appearances in a
month, which is pretty much pitching every
other day. Moreover, he has yet to blow con
secutive saves this season.
But what makes K-Rod the most valuable
player on his squad, and perhaps in the
American League, is that no other pitcher on
the Angels staff can come even close to his
numbers to finish a game.
The Angels have had 82 save opportuni
ties on the season. While Frankie has con
verted 60 of his 67 chances (89.5 percent). the
rest of the bullpen has only saved three out of
15 tries (20 percent).
Sure, the Angels bullpen is one of the best
in the American League, but it is Frankie who
holds it together.
Scott Shields, their eighth-inning setup
man, has blown five of his eight save oppor
tunities. With a majority of his earned runs
coming with two outs, his closing abilities are
questionable.
The heir apparent to Frankie, if and when
he leaves, is Jose Arredondo, who leads all re
lievers with nine victories. However,
Arredondo has blown all six of his save op
portunities.
Looking at the rest of the bullpen, Justin
Speier has given up 15 homeruns on the sea
son. many of them game-winners. And his
5.18 ERA is definitely not closer material.
And the left-handed Darren Oliver is a de
pendable pitcher, but clearly no Rodriguez.
K-Rod is the reason why the Angels have
the best record in baseball. By closing out
close game after close game, Frankie has
given the Angels homefield advantage in the
first round of the playoffs, which is crucial
considering their horrible play at Fenway
andTropicana Field.
Compared to other American League
closers, Frankie is second to none. K-Rod has
a higher save percentage than Jonathan Pa
pelbon and Joe Nathan. And compared to
Joakim Soria and Mariano Rivera. Frankie's
saves have actually meant something more to
the playoff-bound Angels over the Yankees
and cellar-dwelling Royals.
Sure, it takes a team to give Frankie all of
these save opportunities, but K-Rod has cap
italized on every appearance, churning out
save after save.
I was able to watch Rodriguez save his
58th game and break Thigpen's record, and
the atmosphere of the stadium was electric,
with over 40,000 fans standing and cheering
Frankie on. When K-Rod struck out Raul
Ibanez and dropped to his knees, an MVP
was born.
There are many other players who have
had great seasons this year. But none of them
have had such meaning and importance to a
playoff squad the K-Rod's has. People can
throw out other names for the AL MVP like
Josh Hamilton or Justin Morneau, but nei
ther the Rangers nor Twins are playoff
bound, neither has had to perform in the
clutch like Rodriguez.
Carlos Ouentin has also had a great sea
son, but he has missed a considerable amount
of time, and the White Sox lineup is infused
with immense power that takes away from
Ouentin's importance in the lineup.
And unfortunately for Dustin Pedroia.
the Red Sox are too deep and strong — they
could easily replace their diminutive second
baseman's production.
Ladies and gentlemen of the Baseball
Writers' Association of America, Frankie
needs and deserves your votes. He not only
has been the most important player on base
ball's best team, but he has shattered the
standard for all relief pitchers.
