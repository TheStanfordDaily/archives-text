# Ike impacts 281 students
## University accommodates financial, housing requests of affected students 
### CARLEE BROWN DESK EDITOR 
For nearly 300 Stanford students, the
stress of readjusting to life on the Farm was
exacerbated by the onslaught of Hurricane
Ike.The storm hit Galveston,Tex. on Sept. 13,
just as Stanford freshmen prepared for their
trip to campus and New Student Orientation.
The hurricane was both destructive and
deadly, costing at least $6 billion and 56 lives,
according to the Associated Press, liul before
Ike could unleash its devastating power,
Stanford officials offered assistance to stu
dents in the projected path of the storm.
By using zip codes listed in student
accounts, University staff determined which
students lived in Ike's path. Employees of the

Vice Provost for Student

Affairs, Student Housing

ate students and 155 under

graduates â€”44 were fresh

the Freshman Dean's
Office and the Graduate

Life Office worked
together to offer assis
tance to the students

who were identified as
possible victims of the
storm.

"Wc sent out an email to
all of the students and put a

notice on our Web site." said
Sally Dickson, associate vice
provost for student affairs.

"Then we started receiving calls. Most were
from freshmen, and there weren't a lot."
A total of 281 students resided in the zone

of impact, including 126 gradu

men. Dickson said that she
received between 15 and

20 requests from under

graduates. Christine
Griffith, associate vice

provost for student

affairs, received ten
calls from graduate

students.
Most calls per

tained to moving in
early or holding

assignments for later, said Griffith and
Dickson. All students who requested an early
move-in date were accommodated.

Nick Mclntyre '11, a native of Galveston.
Tex., was one of the students who moved into
his dorm room early as a result of Ike.
"I didn't know [Stanford] was paving that
close of attention to us." Mclntyre said, 'it
was a very welcome surprise to hear from
them."
Mclntyre said that he did not ask for
financial assistance to cover the cost of the
plane ticket he had to change after Ike hit.
"I'm going to go visit the Financial Aid
Office tomorrow though." Mclntyre said of
his tuition hill. "Our house sustained quite a
bit of damage."
Dickson said that no undergraduates
requested immediate financial assistance due
