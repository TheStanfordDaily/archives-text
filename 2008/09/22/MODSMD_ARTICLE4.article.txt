Psychiatry Prof, and Department Chair
Alan Schat/berg has stepped down from his
position as principal investigator on a federal
research grant, following what has now been
six months of Congressional scrutiny regard
ing the professor's financial ties to the drug
industry.

The move - deemed "temporary" by
Stanford officials - comes after half a year of
communications between the t Jniversity and
Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), who has been
unearthing details of Schatzberg's financial
relationship with Corcept Therapeutics, a pub
lic company specializing in depression treat
ment. Schat/berg co-founded Corcept in 1998
and now owns more than $6 million in the
company's stock.
Schat/berg, who is also the president-elect
of the American Psychiatric Association,
served as principal investigator of research
that was being funded by a grant from the
National Institutes of Health (NilI). The
research - centered on the biology ol psychot

which has been used since 1988 to induce
abortions but has recently been tested by
Corcept as an anti-depressant.
In a July 31 letter from Grassley to
University President John Hennessy,
Grassley noted a potential conflict of interest
between the professor's research on mifepris
tone and his equity in Corcept.
"This equity could grow dramatically if the
results of Dr. Schatzberg's government-spon
sored research find that mifepristone could be
used to treat psychotic major depression," the
lowa senator wrote.
In a July 31 letter from the University to
the National Institute of Mental Health
(NIMH), Stanford General Counsel Debra
Zuniwalt stressed that "appropriate steps

were taken to prevent bias or actual conflict of
interest." Zumwalt noted that other faculty
members, who had no financial interest in the
results of the research, assumed responsibility
for the mifepristone trials.
Michelle Brandt, senior media relations
manager of the School of Medicine, said in an
email to The Weekly that Medical School Prof.
Charles De√üattista oversaw the initial
mifepristone trials in place of Schat/berg. fol

"Dr. Schat/berg did not select or screen the
participants, treat the participants or consult
on the treatment they received, collect the
data from the participants' visits or analyze
