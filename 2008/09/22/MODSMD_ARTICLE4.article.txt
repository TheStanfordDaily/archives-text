A version of this article originally ran

Psychiatry Prof, and Department Chair
Alan Schat/berg has stepped down from his
position as principal investigator on a federal
research grant, following what has now been
six months of Congressional scrutiny regard
ing the professor's financial ties to the drug
industry.

The move - deemed "temporary" by
Stanford officials - comes after half a year of
communications between the t Jniversity and
Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), who has been
unearthing details of Schatzberg's financial
relationship with Corcept Therapeutics, a pub
lic company specializing in depression treat
ment. Schat/berg co-founded Corcept in 1998
and now owns more than $6 million in the
company's stock.
Schat/berg, who is also the president-elect
of the American Psychiatric Association,
served as principal investigator of research
that was being funded by a grant from the
National Institutes of Health (NilI). The
research - centered on the biology ol psychot
ic depression - involved the drug mifepristone.

which has been used since 1988 to induce
abortions but has recently been tested by
Corcept as an anti-depressant.
In a July 31 letter from Grassley to
University President John Hennessy,
Grassley noted a potential conflict of interest
between the professor's research on mifepris
tone and his equity in Corcept.
"This equity could grow dramatically if the
results of Dr. Schatzberg's government-spon
sored research find that mifepristone could be
used to treat psychotic major depression," the
lowa senator wrote.
In a July 31 letter from the University to
the National Institute of Mental Health
(NIMH), Stanford General Counsel Debra
Zuniwalt stressed that "appropriate steps

were taken to prevent bias or actual conflict of
interest." Zumwalt noted that other faculty
members, who had no financial interest in the
results of the research, assumed responsibility
for the mifepristone trials.
Michelle Brandt, senior media relations
manager of the School of Medicine, said in an
email to The Weekly that Medical School Prof.
Charles De√üattista oversaw the initial
mifepristone trials in place of Schat/berg. fol
lowed by several other doctors.
"Dr. Schat/berg did not select or screen the
participants, treat the participants or consult
on the treatment they received, collect the
data from the participants' visits or analyze
the data" Brandt said."lt would not
have been appropriate for him to do
so."
Still. Grassley noted in his letter
to Hennessy that, according to NIH
grant policy, the primary investigator
of an NIH grant is responsible for
scientific or technical aspects, as well
as day-to-day management of the
project.
"So. the question arises: How
could Dr. Schatzberg monitor the
research funded with his NIH grants
if he was not involved closely in the
study?" Grassley asked.
Grassley also pointed to several
other NIH-funded mifepristone tri
als listed on Stanford's Web site and
ClinicalTrials.gov next to
Schatzberg's name. In response,
Stanford Vice Provost and Dean of
Research Ann Arvin explained in a

July 31 letter, toTC
gression of doctors who assumeo
responsibility for the mifepristone
trials, and she told the senator that
Schatzberg will step down from his
role as principal investigator.
"Despite our belief that Stanford.
NIMH and Dr. Schatzberg have han
dled this grant in accordance with
the regulations and applicable poli
cies and with due regard for the
integrity of the research." Arvin
wrote, "we can see how having Dr.
Schatzberg continue as the principal
investigator on the grant can create
an appearance of conflict of inter
est."
"And we want to eliminate that
concern." Zumwalt added to the
same statement in her letter to the
NIMH.
According to Brandt. School of
Medicine Prof. Fredric Kraemer will
temporarily replace Schatzberg as
principal investigator on the grant.
