## Blood bus cruises campus New Bloodmobile to allow for mobile donations 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford University Blood
Center has purchased a new mobile
blood donation bus which officials
estimate will expand the center's total
donation intake by roughly 20 percent.
It is hoped that the Bloodmobile will
make blood donations more conven
ient for both individuals and business
es without a blood center nearby.
"The Bloodmobile was something
we desperately needed for several
years," said Ed Engleman. medical
director of the Blood Center, during
the Bloodmobile's christening party
on Saturday night. "Half of the total
blood donated to the bank is donated
outside of the fixed centers located in
Mountain View and on Welch Road.
In addition, a number of donor groups
don't have enough space in their facil
ities for us to come in and set up.
That's why this bus is so valuable."
Community members and business
es played a vital role in purchasing the
Bloodmobile. contributing a total of
$275,000 for the five beds and
machines necessary for withdrawing
blood from donors.
The Blood Center aims to attract
more donors through the
Bloodmobile on the Stanford campus
itself.
"We're definitely trying to find
more ways to engage the student pop
ulation." said Recruiting Manager
Susan Morris. "Some of the strategies
we are implementing include ongoing
drives at the hospital and at the donor
center at 780 Welch. We want to
engage students, to find out what's
important to them."
This fall, the center will launch a
blood drive competition with
Berkeley during Big Game. Berkeley
students will donate blood to the Red
Cross in Berkeley and Stanford stu
dents will donate to the blood center
stations on campus. The school that
donates the most blood will be
announced during halftime on the day
of Big Game.
"This will be a huge campus-wide
drive," Morris said. "It will probably
be the hugest drive ever, with poten
tially 300 people donating. We're coor
dinating this drive closely with the
Stanford Health and Wellness Center,
which is giving us three gyms to con
duct it in."
Morris said that blood from a single
student donor could save as many as
three lives and he believes that the
Bloodmobile will generate more stu
dent donations by making opportuni
ties to give blood more accessible to
students where they live.
"At Stanford, we're a non-profit
institution." said Director of Donor
Services Harpreet Sandhu.'We have a
limited budget and so we often rely on
generosity from industry and the com
munity."
Founded in the 19705, the Blood
Center began with only three employ
ees and today has more than 350 peo
ple on staff.
"The Blood Center was created by
the University inside the Medical
School," Engelman said. "It started
with the dual purpose of providing
blood services and products to
Stanford clinics and supporting aca
demic research and teaching efforts.
It's unique and I'm not aware of
another operational blood hank or
research enterprise anywhere else in
the country, or the world for that mat
ter."
