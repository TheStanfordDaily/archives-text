## PROFESSOR CREATES TINY TREE REPLICA IN LAB 
### ANDREASY 
am <i 1 Palo Alto," the
I . 110-foot tall red
■ wood tree repre
sented on Stan
m J ford's official seal
and the municipal seal of the city, is a
landmark and rallying point for Stan
ford fans. The Stanford Band even
uses the tree as its mascot. But Assis
tant Professor of Materials Science Yi
Cui has taken this devotion to another
level.
Not quite the level one might ex
pect though — Cui has actually creat
ed a model of the tree that stands at
approximately one millionth of its ac
tual size.
Actually, he said, it was kind of an

accident.
"We didn't design our experiment
to replicate El Palo Alto," Cui said of
his research in nanowires. "After we
obtained these tree-like nano-struc
tures. we thought of El Palo Alto."
The replica, constructed of lead se
lenide nanowires, can only be seen
through an electron microscope. Cui
explained the objectives of his re
search as being to test "the mechani
cal, electrical and optical properties of
these nanotrees."
Entitled "Formation of chiral
branched nanowires by the Eshelby
Twist," the project was mainly con
ducted by Jia Zhu, a third-year gradu
ate student, with collaborations by fac
ulty members from the electrical engi
neering department and the materials

science and engineering department
— Dr. Hailin Peng, Dr. Ann Marshall.
Professor M. Barnett and Professor
Nix, along with Cui.
"It is also a new mechanism for
nanowires growth," Zhu said of the
tree replica. "There is a screw disloca
tion in the center of every nanowire
(the main branch). And it is this screw
dislocation which acts as an active
growth step to incorporate atoms that
promote nanowire growth."
It is the Eshelby Twist that causes
the "branches" to spiral around the
"trunk," creating the tree-like
nanowire structure. The formation of
the replica required the use of the
vapor transport process and took sev
eral hours to complete.
Cui identified some goals and fu
ture projects of the research group.
"We've already obtained unex
pected results in our CulnSe2
nanowire solar cell materials which is
already published and in our phase
change memory nanowires, which is
currently in review," he said.
"For our research projects, we usu
ally have goals well set-up," he added.
"But we are prepared to see many sur
prising discoveries. Our area of study,
which is materials at nanoscale, is def
initely full of surprises."
Perhaps like making tree replicas
when the goal was simply to study
nanowire properties.
