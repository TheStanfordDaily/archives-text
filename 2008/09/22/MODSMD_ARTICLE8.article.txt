# STUDENT LIFE
## Congress passes act to reduce college, textbook costs 
### ERIC MESSINGER DESK EDITOR 
A version of this article originally

Following governmental action,
students at Stanford and across the
country should soon have access to
more choices and information so
they can reduce the costs of attend
ing college.
The Fligher Education
Opportunity Act of 2008, signed into
law by President Bush on Aug. 14,
targets student loans and textbook
prices. In addition, the law simplifies
financial aid applications and
extends grants for low-income stu
dents. The bill had made its way
through Congress as an update to
prior legislation.

While the full implications of the
1,100-page legislation will take time
to be assessed, its impact on some
students' cost of living could come
as soon as this fall, when students
old and new shop for their autumn
quarter books. The law forces text
book publishers to make "unbun
dled" versions of main course text
books available. These textbooks
often had been packaged with addi
tional course materials, such as
workbooks and supplementary CDs.
The law also aims to make informa
tion about pricing more transparent
for both students and faculty.
Director of Financial Aid Karen
Cooper noted that the legislation
could have broad implications, not
limited to a potential impact on
book costs.

"It does a lot of tweaking of the
federal financial aid program,"
Cooper said. "The transparency of
book costs is just a small part of that
bill."
The law could play a role in the
Financial Aid Office's assessments
of expected student costs. Stanford
compiles data for its "textbook
allowance" for financial aid based
largely on student surveys.
Currently, students are expected to
incur $1,455 in yearly book costs for
the 2008-09 academic year. Results
from the upcoming year's surveys,
sent out during spring quarter, will
provide an indication as to whether
the law has checked growing costs.
"We try to get a picture of the full
costs, not just what we bill," Cooper
said.

In addition to assessing the effects
of the act, Stanford is taking some
steps of its own to address student
book costs. University Registrar
Thomas Black, in an email to The
Weekly, discussed an upcoming effort
to make course textbook information
available through Axess, drawing
upon information from the Stanford
Bookstore's vendor.
"One of the projects we have
scheduled this year is writing an
interface between Axess and
eFollett.com." Black said. eFollett is
the vendor for the Stanford
Bookstore.
"Such an interface will make it
easier for students to identify the
materials they should secure for the
courses they have selected," he
added.

This measure would be in keep
ing with the legislation's aim to pro
mote greater transparency. Black
noted that the interface, ideally,
would allow students to have a list
ing of the course materials they
need and find the option that works
for them. He also said the system
could provide students more time to
compare options.
"We haven't worked out the
details - and student input is wel
come - but we hope that the infor
mation will be complete, including
ISBN so students may shop
with other vendors as desired for
price, service, vendor loyalty, etc.,"
Black noted. "We hope to encourage
our faculty to select and designate
their materials before Axess opens
each quarter so students will have
ample time to shop for their course
materials."
While the law will affect the
broader picture of higher education,
few changes are expected at the
Stanford Bookstore, according to
Director of Stores Ken Bowers.
"We don't see radical changes
coming as a result of the bill."
Bowers said. He emphasized that
the decision to stock lower- or high
er-priced books comes down to fac
ulty decisions.
"As far as we're concerned, we
will sell what the faculty asks us to
sell." Bowers said. "We don't act as
an independent adjudicator of what
the faculty assigns their students."
He added that faculty, particular
ly at higher-level universities, often
have to balance a concern for stu
dents' pockets with ensuring the
best possible materials.
"[With] Stanford being a level
one research university, there's a lot
of thought from professors about
what students really need to learn,"
Bowers said. "It's a real dilemma for
faculty."
While textbook prices will likely
continue to be a concern for most
students, "The more we can do to
keep those book prices down, the
better it is for students." Cooper
said.
