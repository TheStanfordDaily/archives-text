THE DAILY NEWS STAFF
David Hahn, a dedicated
Stanford sporting events fan, died
on Tuesday afternoon near his home
at Page Mill Court Apartments, an
assisted living facility in Palo Alto.
Hahn was 35 years old.
While the Santa Clara County
Medical Examiner's Office is inves
tigating the cause of death, police
believe he died of natural causes
and do not suspect foul play. An
individual driving by on Ash Street
saw Hahn collapsed in a parking lot
at around 1 p.m. and called 911.
Police and paramedics arrived short
ly after and pronounced Hahn dead
on the scene.
Hahn, endearingly known as
Super Dave, was a dedicated fan of
the University. He rarely missed a
football game and could often be
seen after games, either celebrating
the win or dealing with the loss. He
graduated from Palo Alto High
School in 1991.
Many members of the LSJUMB
also felt Hahn's loss. The band per
sonally thanked Hahn on their last
three recorded albums and played
for him on his 30th birthday.
