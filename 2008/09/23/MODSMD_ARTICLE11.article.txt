## Editorial Board What is the edit board? 
### 
Vol. 234 Editorial Board
Working at The Daily, I have realized that
many students do not know how the editori
al board works. When I was managing editor
of news, some people told me they thought
that the editor-in-chief and I wrote the edi
torials. (In reality, the board has traditional
ly been made up of six students who applied
and the two opinions editors.)
We're doing things a little differently this
year. After working more hours than the av
erage investment banker as The Daily's
managing editor of news last volume, I de
cided to take a non-traditional step and
move to opinions. I saw an opportunity to
utilize my news background and shape well
researched editorial content.
I will be the board's chair, and three for
mer Daily writers and editors will serve on
the board. The editor in chief and I also se
lected three at-large students following the
solicitation of applications.
Each week, the board will meet and agree
on the content of upcoming editorials. We
each come to the board with our biases on
some issues, but we will try to have a mem
ber without strong preconceptions do the
writing in such cases. We're also open to your
suggestions, and you can email us at editori
al@daily.stanford.edu with an issue on
which you'd like us to take a stand.
Similarly, if you have any questions or
would like to submit an op-ed. please email
editorial@daily.stanford.edu. Letters to the
editor to should be sent to eic@daily.stan
ford.edu. What's the difference? Letters to
the editor address concerns or thoughts
about previously published Daily articles or
content. Op-eds may do that too. but these
can express an opinion about other issues as
well. Op-eds are generally written by people
with relevant background to a particular
subject and are full-length editorial pieces.
(See today's op-ed on alcohol.) They should
be submitted by 5 p.m. the day before de
sired publication. We have limited space and
cannot promise to publish your piece.
Below are short biographies of the new
board members. We are very excited to share
our views about campus issues and other
matters relevant to students.

chosen American Studies.) Andrea followed
