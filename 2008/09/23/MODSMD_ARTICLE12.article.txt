# Op-Ed
## The 						Social Zone 
### Jack Cackler, Ali Fox Will Young 
As you read this, we are entering the first
week of another wonderful year at Stanford
University. New Student Orientation is over
and the Stanford social scene will open in
full force. This op-ed is intended partly for
freshmen as a helpful guide to navigating the
party scene at Stanford. But it should also
serve as a helpful refresher to upperclass
men who don't get inundated with the ad
vice freshmen get at NSO. We encourage
you to read this, and whether you choose to
drink or not, we wish you the best as you
enter what will surely be an excellent year.
To begin. California (as well as every
other state) mandates that alcohol con
sumption and possession is illegal for people
under the age of 21. While this law is en
forced at Stanford, we pride ourselves on
being responsible individuals who will make
the right choice when it comes to alcohol.
The Greek system often shoulders much
of the blame related to alcohol abuse on
campus. In the past, some of the blame has
been deserved. But we are committed to en
suring that people who choose to drink do so
in a manner that is safest (and most fun) for
you and the rest of the community.
While most people know that many peo
ple choose not to drink at Stanford.some are
surprised by how many. Roughly one in
three of the undergraduate population
elects not to drink alcohol. Even within the
Greek system, many people make the deci
sion not to drink. TTiis decision is made for
health-related, academic, religious and
other personal reasons. We encourage
everyone then to make the decision to drink
alcohol, or not, on their own terms.
There are many resources on campus re
lated to alcohol that are often underused.
The Substance Abuse Prevention Program
(650-723-3429) through Health Promotion
Services at Vaden offers information about

alcohol and assistance to any student. The
manager. Ralph Castro, gives talks to many
students about responsible alcohol use. in
cluding choosing not to drink and avoiding
hard liquor. Find out when and where he is
speaking this quarter and show up.
Check out alcohol.stanford.edu to get all
of the information on the Stanford alcohol
scene. This website is filled with great infor
mation for all students. Furthermore, look
into 5-SURE, (650-725-7873) which is a stu
dent-run program that provides golf cart
rides to people at night (generally from 9
p.m. to 2 a.m.) The program specifically aims
to prevent potential sexual assault. RAs and
PHEs are also trained to help advise stu
dents on various alcohol-related topics.
The best resources, however, for making
sure that you are safe (and certainly to ensure
you have fun) are your friends. If you choose
to drink, please do so in the company of close
friends that will look out for you. What makes
Stanford unique is that people step up and
help each other without hesitation. Make
sure that you have fun, but also that you're
safe and don't ever exceed your limits.
To summarize:
Choose to drink (or not) on your own terms,
Try to avoid hard liquor.
Know about the resources that are available
to you,
If you drink, stay with close friends and
watch out for them.
Be safe, and above all.
Have fun!
