# The
						economics of the financial crisis

### 
As newspaper headlines and television
commentators proclaim a financial
apocalypse, an event even more cata
strophic than the recent construction in
White Plaza, perhaps we should stop and ask
ourselves how this all began. How did we get
into this terrible mess?
There are a host of buzzword answers —
subprime mortgages, excessive leverage, a
housing bubble — and an alphabet soup of
acronyms — ABX, CDO, CDS. HMO (actu
ally, that one might not be relevant) — but
none of them identify the underlying cause.
What really made things get this bad?
The answer is actually quite simple: in
centives. It is almost always the right answer
to any economic problem. Freshmen, you
now have no excuse for doing poorly in Econ
IA. Not since they decided to play King's
Cup as an icebreaker at the August meeting
of Palo Alto Alcoholics Anonymous has
there been such a gross misalignment of in
centives.
The economic system was set up for fail
ure; the rules of the game were such that
calamity could be the only outcome.
Let's start with that most beautiful of Ayn
Rand disciples, the best looking man in
Washington since James Carville: Alan
Greenspan. After the dot-com bubble burst
and 9/11 occurred. Greenspan cut interest
rates drastically. When the economy began
to improve, Greenspan held rates at low lev
els.
These sustained low interest rates cut into
banks' profitability. In order to boost profits,
banks began making ioans they typically
would not make; they began searching for
methods to extend credit to consumers with
low income, without stable jobs and without
any savings.
Low interest rates created an incentive
for banks to restructure their lending busi
ness. There was a "race to the bottom" as
banks sought to make loans to consumers

that previously did not have access to debt.
Everything else grew from there.
Financial engineers were rewarded for
creating obscure mortgages such as option
ARMs, where interest rates on the mort
gage are low initially but then rise over time.
Loan officers were paid commission based
on the volume of loans they originated and
not the quality of the loans. Consumer debt
grew at an unprecedented rate and com
mercial banks became saturated with mort
gages.
Enter the ever-opportunistic investment
banker. Here, again, the incentives are per
verse. Investment bankers are paid fees
based on their ability to sell an asset — the
more they sell, the more fees they are paid;
the quality of the asset is irrelevant.
So investment bankers went to commer
cial banks and told them to package their
loans together and sell them to investors —
securitization, they called it. Investors would
be "secured" by the houses underlying these
mortgages. But why would the investors buy
these securities?
The answer, my friend, is not blowing in
the wind but is the same answer of a few
paragraphs ago: incentives.
Financial securities receive ratings from
firms called rating agencies. The role of the
rating agency is to simplify the life of the in
vestor by doing all the work. Rating agencies
analyze a financial security and then give it a
rating that is supposed to represent its credit
worthiness.

The highest rating is AAA — equivalent
to the credit-worthiness of the almighty US
government.The lowest is "junk bond" status
— equivalent to the creditworthiness of a
Central African country whose government
was overthrown, twice, in the time it took me
to write this column.
Naturally,Triple-A securities are the most
accessible and investors buy these securities
without too much persuasion.
The funny thing is that investment banks,
not investors, pay rating agencies to rate se
curities. It's like doing a test and then having
yourself grade it afterwards to see how
you've done; everyone gives themselves a
few extra points.
So investment banks packaged these
loans, got rating agencies to give them AAA
ratings and then sold them, in hordes, to in
vestors.
An extremely vicious cycle was set up.
Commercial banks could go out and make
more loans, investment banks would create
more securities and investors would suck it
up. On and on it went, piling up like one of
those precarious Jenga towers that only
needs the slightest of shocks to send it crash
ing.
And then the shock came — house prices
began declining. And it sent everything
crashing.
The securities investors had been buying
started falling in value, so they stopped buy
ing. This meant that commercial banks were
stuck with souring mortgages and investment
banks held unsold securities that were quick
ly losing value.
The system began imploding, collapsing
on itself and leaving us where we are at the
moment. But the incentives, the incentives fi
nally started aligning themselves correctly.
