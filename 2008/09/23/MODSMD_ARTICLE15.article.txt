## CARD STILL PERFECT No. 6 Stanford women take first at SCU Invite 
### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
It's only about 15 miles away, but
the Stanford women's soccer team
will probably be missing Santa
Clara's Buck Shaw Stadium as they
head home for the week. The No. 6
Cardinal cruised to the SCU Invita
tional title this weekend with con
vincing three-goal victories over
Yale on Friday and Cal Poly on Sun
day.
"I thought the team played very
well [over the weekend]," coach Paul
Ratcliffe said. "We scored a lot of
goals and the goals came from a lot of
different players, so we're sharing
the responsibility and getting good
results."
The team began the tournament
on Friday evening against Yale. The
Cardinal was a heavy favorite going
into the game, but it was the under
dog that took a surprise lead. Less
than 20 minutes in, Stanford gave
away a free kick just outside the
goalie box. Yale's Maggie Westfal
blasted a shot that deflected off the
Cardinal wall and slipped into the
lower right corner of the goal, put
ting the Bulldogs in front 1-0.
Stanford responded to the early
deficit by dominating play for the
rest of the half, and was rewarded
with the equalizer in the 29th minute.
Junior Kelley O'Hara made a run
down the right wing and sent a cross
to sophomore midfielder Allison
McCann. who hit a perfect header
into the far corner for her first career
goal.
It looked like Yale might weather
the storm and go into halftime tied,
but O'Hara — who wreaked havoc
on the Bulldog backline all game —
put the Cardinal in front with just 30
seconds remaining in the half. Junior
Ali Riley sent a beautiful ball over
the top of the defense and O'Hara
was there to half-volley past the
keeper."Hie goal sent Stanford to the
locker room with a lead and all the
momentum.
The second period began much
the way the first ended — with Yale's
goal under siege. Freshmen Teresa

GAME NOTES: The No. 6 Cardinal trounced
Yale and Cal Poly to take first place at the
SCU/Adidas Classic in Santa Clara, Calif.
Sophomore Allison McCann notched the
first goal of her collegiate career Friday
against Yale in a 4-1 victory over the Bull
dogs. Stanford similarly demolished Cal Poly
on Sunday, winning 3-0.

Noyola and Lindsay Taylor both got
off good shots on goal before fellow
frosh Cami Levin scored a well-de
served goal. Levin lifted the ball
from the edge of the penalty area,
sending it just over Yale's leaping
goalkeeper and into the top of the
net to give Stanford a 3-1 lead.
Sophomore Christen Press would
seal the deal for the Cardinal one
minute later when she knocked in a
rebound to put the game out of
reach.
Two days later. Stanford met a Cal
Poly team that had stunned tourna
ment host Santa Clara 2-1 on Friday.
But Stanford was determined to
avoid the same fate and took the lead
just seven minutes in. Levin charged
into the penalty area and was taken
down by a Mustang defender, and
Noyola converted the penalty kick.
The teams played evenly for the
rest of the period, and Cal Poly had a
good chance to tie the match with a
few minutes left in the half. A loose
ball in the box resulted in a chaotic
scramble, but the Stanford defense
managed not only to clear the ball,
but even to start a counterattack.
