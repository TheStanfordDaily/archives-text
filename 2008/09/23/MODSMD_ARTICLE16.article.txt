# Water polo tops Cal in OT thriller
## Men take third in NorCal Tournament 
### KENAN JIANG STAFF WRITER 
Stanford water polo's weekend
was highlighted by an 11-10 triple
overtime win over top-ranked Cali
fornia at the NorCal Tournament.
After a 10-3 loss to USC in the tour
nament semifinals, the Cardinal men
rebounded to take third overall in
the tournament.
The weekend started at the Avery
Aquatic Center as the water polo
team won a 14-2 victory against No.
20 Air Force last Friday night. Junior
Sage Wright had three goals, while
juniors Drac Wigo and Janson Wigo
had two goals apiece. Senior Andrew
Drake, freshman Peter Sefton, senior
Will Hindle-Katel, sophomore Jef
frey Schwimer and freshman Jacob
Smith all contributed to the goal tally.
The Cardinal's offensive prowess
was accompanied by a defensive
shutdown as Stanford held Air Force
scoreless until the end of the third
period, at which point the squad was
already up 11-0. Hindle-Katel domi
nated the inside with physical play as
Stanford's main two-meter player. In
water polo, the two-meter position is
where all the physical, dirty work
plays out while the wings look for op
portunities to score on offense or
deny opportunities on defense.
Over the weekend, the team also
traveled to Stockton, Calif, for the
NorCal Tournament. Stanford was
undefeated through the first two
games of the tourney, collecting an
easy 15-2 victory over Santa Clara
and a 10-5 win over Loyola Mary
mount to secure a spot in the semifi
nals. Drac Wigo notched an incredi
ble six goals in the two games, while
junior Jinimie Sandman and sopho
more Brian Pingree took turns de
fending the goal.
Sunday morning, the Cardinal

lost its rhythm and suffered its first
loss of the season to perennial pow
erhouse No. 2 USC in a 10-3 defeat.
The Trojans' defense stifled Stan
ford's efforts as the Cardinal trailed
4-2 after the first period and was
never able to recover from a slow
start.
"I think we match up really well
with the rest of the teams in the
MPSF," Stanford head coach John
Vargas told GoStanford.com. "Our
schedule is tough, with a lot of away
games this year, but with this group
of guys, we have great experience, so
we'll be prepared. But I feel opti
mistic about our season and our
chances. We've got the guys to do
well now."
"The guys know how important
every single game is," he continued,
"and the experience from last year
will definitely carry over this year."
Stanford then went on to play the
third-place game against Cal in the
afternoon. The Cardinal fell behind
3-0, as it appeared the defending na
tional champions would take advan
tage of a Stanford offense that stalled
once again.
At halftime.the Bears led 6-2. But
Stanford found its offensive touch
again in the second half as the Cardi
nal pulled ahead of Cal before its ri
vals forced overtime. After triple
overtime, Schwimer scored his third
goal of the game and won the sud
den-death match.
Drac Wigo scored three goals on
Sunday and led all Stanford players
with nine goals over four tourna
ment games. Janson Wigo was not far
behind with a seven-goal tally.
The Cardinal will resume action
on Oct. 5, when they travel back to
Stockton, Calif to take on Pacific.
