## Goodbye, Yankee Stadium 
### 
With the New York Yankees
all hut eliminated from
playoff contention. Yan
kee Stadium has hosted its final
game. Starting next fall, the Bronx
Bombers will play across the street
in a new (and improved) ballpark of
the same name.
Sunday night was the old field's
grand finale. Yankees past and pres
ent took the field in a wonderful cel
ebration of the franchise, the build
ing and baseball. ESPN went all-out
with its coverage, and rightfully so:
If Yankee Stadium isn't the most
revered sporting ground in Ameri
ca, it's definitely in the conversa
tion.
It was odd. watching it all from
3.000 miles away. At each Yankees
game I went to this summer, a
celebrity of some sort would pull a
lever that counted down the stadi
um's final games. Europe's power
ballad blared from the speakers, and
we'd all share a somber moment.
The Cathedral of Baseball was near
ing its final days.
Not everyone was affected by
this veneration of the stadium, but
the coming move was certainly on
the minds of all New York sports
fans. Until I returned to California
last week, every sports conversation
I had came back to the impending
demise of the stadium. So watching
Sunday's festivities unfold through
a bootleg feed on my computer, not
in person or even at a sports bar in
the city, was almost surreal. I almost
felt like an outsider to the process.
Except, of course, I wasn't.
At first, the entire affair seemed
strange to me — like any teenage
male, my cynicism- knows no
bounds. After all, this wasn't actual
ly The House that Ruth Built; that
was. for the most part, knocked
down in 1975 when the structure un
derwent massive renovations. The
stadium I knew was not the one that
Ruth. Gehrig, Mantle and DiMag
gio played in. or where the "Great
est Game Ever Played" was contest
ed or where Joe Louis knocked out
Max Schmeling. The modern ball
park. though it was host to some
great moments, never inspired the
same kind of adulation from fans
across the country.
I felt — and still feel — that the
reverence for 85 years of history was
a bit overdone. The weeks became
days, and on Sunday the Stadium
opened its doors for the final time.
But with each passing game, my own
nostalgia grew. It wasn't for the
Babe or Whitey or Yogi — I was
never fortunate enough to see those
men play. Instead it was for the Yan
kees I grew up with: Bernie, Paulie,
Scott and Tino.This was their stomp
ing ground.
They were all on hand on Sun
day. As the Yanks introduced each
player, the crowd roared. And when
Bernie Williams, the last man. was
finally announced, it erupted. He
trotted out onto the diamond. No.
51 on his back. The ovation lasted
for more than two minutes.
After the most disappointing
season in nearly 15 years,all seemed
right again in Yankeeland.
Fans of other teams and older
Yankees fans will focus on the New
York greats, and that's finw. If I am
going to reflect on the teams of the
'90s, then who am I to roll my eyes at
older fans who choose to remember
Yankee Stadium as the home of the
Iron Horse and the Yankee Clipper?
But the historv that touches me is

all recent, so when Bernie took the
field for the first time in two years,
all the memories came hack: my first
trip to the Stadium; my aunt's insis
tence on seeing Donnie Baseball
play before he retired and I moved
to Hong Kong: witnessing the Rock
et's 300 th win firsthand in 2003;
tracking Aaron Boone's ALCS
clinching homerun from the leftfield
nosebleeds later that year. Even the
moments that I was not present for,
likeTino Martinez's 1998 World Se
ries grand slam. Chad Curtis's walk
off homerun a year later nnd Cone
and Boomer's perfect games, all
came flooding back to me.
Those are the types of moments
that cement your fandom. And that
crop of Yankees players, who em
bodied the team aspect of the game
in every sense of the word, are worth
the starry-eyed reflection they have
received in the stadium's final days.
It was only fitting that Andy Pet
titte, one of the last ties to the teams
of the "90s. started on Sunday. And
even though it wasn't a save situa
tion, it was inevitable that Mariano
Rivera would close the game out.
He threw only 11 pitches, eight for
strikes, and sent the Orioles down in
order. Just like he did in 19%, or
1999. when modern-day Yankee leg
ends — my heroes — roamed the
same field.

of its memories, 2008 season excepted.
