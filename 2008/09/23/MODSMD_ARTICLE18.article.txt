## Sailing opens season at Harry Anderson Regatta 
### 
The Cardinal sailing team opened its
season at the Harry Anderson Regatta in
New Haven, Conn., Sept. 13-14. Stanford
had a boat in both the A and B divisions of
the race, producing mixed results for the
squad in its first action of the year.
In the A division, the Cardinal — co
captained by seniors T.J. Tullo and Kelly
McKenna — finished lKth. In the B divi
sion. however, sophomore skipper Cole
Hatton and freshman Hannah Burroughs
raced to a third-place finish overall, pro
pelled by a third-place finish in their third
race of the event.
The Regatta is traditionally a light wind
event and 2008 was no different,as only five
total races sailed in each division over the
weekend: the lack of wind forced frequent
event postponements.
Roger Williams won the Harry Ander
son Trophy at the regatta, tallying 55 total
points to edge out Boston College. The Sea
hawks were led to victory by former Stan
ford assistant coach Amanda Callahan.
Next up for Stanford is the Single-hand
ed Pacific Coast Championships, where the
Cardinal will look to qualify for the Single
handed Nationals later this year at Cornell.
The Pacific Coast Championships open on
the women's side this Friday, while the men
begin racing on Saturday in Mission Bay,
Calif.
