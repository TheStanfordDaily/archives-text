# Alum gives to engineering center
## Social, academic center in new quad to open by early 2010 
### CARLEE BROWN DESK EDITOR 
Construction of the second building in the new
Science and Engineering Quad (SEQ) will be aided by a
recent $30 million donation to the School of Engineering.
The donation comes from Jen-Hsun Huang, who
received his master's degree in Electrical Engineering
from Stanford in 1992. The new building, named the Jen-
Hsun 1 luang School of Engineering Center, is designed to
incorporate sustainable technology with the need for
both social and academic space. Features include machine
shops, visualization and video conferencing labs, as well as
collaborative work areas.
"We'll also have a major new conference space and
auditorium to bring together people from around all over
the world, and a new cafe to bring people together from
around campus," said David Orenstein, communications
and PR manager for the School of Engineering, in an
email to The Daily. "We believe the Huang Center will be
the social focus of the new Science and Engineering
Quad."
Huang made his donation on Sept. 10 at the Jerry
Yang and Akiko Yamazaki Environment and Energy
Building, more commonly known as Y2E2. The
announcement of Huang's gift was made on a balcony
overlooking the site of the Huang Center, which is
already under construction.
"It is a great privilege to play a role in the future of
Stanford," Huang said at the event. "There is no question
in my mind that the most important and greatest engi
neering school on the planet will continue to invent amaz
ing things — surprising things — that will change our
lives and change the world ahead of us."
The Huang Center itself signals a change for the
School of Engineering. As part of a transition from the
agingTerman Engineering building to the new SEQ, the
Huang Center will serve as a model of sustainable
design. All four buildings are designed to include effi
cient systems for heating and cooling, reuse of non
potable water and large open spaces for air circulation.
I"he most unique feature of the Huang Center will be
the digital library. Orenstein said the library will be
designed with "the flexibility to evolve."
"At first there will still be stacks for books," Qrenstein
said. "But as the collection becomes increasingly digital,
those spaces will be easy to change over to more meeting
space and quiet study space."
Electrical Engineering student Kyle Knutson '09 wel
comed the addition of study space.

"Finally, west campus people will have a place lo
study," Knutson said. "I only wish it were fully completed
before I graduate."
The 130,000 square-foot Huang Center is scheduled
for completion in early 2010. Hie Center for Nanoscale
Science and Technology is also under construction and is

slated for completion in the same year, after which the
Bioengineering and Chemical Engineering Building will
begin construction.
Huang co-founded NVIDIA, a company specializing
in visual computing technologies. At the reception,
Huang said Stanford "has played an important role in the

creation of our company."
"It's a great privilege to be associated with Stanford,
an institution very close to my heart, and particularly a
building very close to my heart." Huang said.
