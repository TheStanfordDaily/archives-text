## SLAC disputes with DOE over name

A recent struggle between University
officials and the U.S. Department of Energy
over the famed Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center (SLAC) will likely result in SLAC's
renaming, so that 'Stanford' is no longer part
of the name.

According to SLAC insiders, the contro
versy may indicate tension between the
physicists who work at SLAC and the
Department of Energy (DOE), which pays
the center's $300 million annual bill. At the
very least, the naming spat could damage the
center's sterling reputation.
Problems began when the DOE tried to
trademark "SLAC" as part of a nationwide
campaign to secure government laborato
ries. Stanford objected, laying claim to its

own name, and instead offered a royalty-free
perpetual license, which the DOE refused.
In the interests of both administrative par
ties. "Stanford" will likely not be in the final
name at all. Hundreds of petition-signees
disapprove.
One leading physics professor, who asked
to remain anonymous to avoid personally
antagonizing the DOE. suggested that the
Department of Energy's refusal to
accept Stanford's offer of a royalty
free perpetual license may indicate
that it is seeking to tighten its con
trol of the lab, something that physi
cists are not happy about.
The name change may also be
part of an effort to open competitive
bidding for the contract to operate
the center, which is up for renewal
every five years.
"In principal, somebody else
could come in and do a better job
than Stanford University," said
Keith Hodgson, deputy director of
SI,AC. "The Department of Energy
could choose to compete that con
tract. to put out a call for proposals."
But Hodgson downplayed the
idea.
"That's not. in my view, coupled
to this name change business," he
said.
While Hodgson admits that with
DOE funding comes restrictions, he
doesn't feel that control issues are
ruining the Stanford-DOE relation
ship.
"As I moved more toward SLAC,
I made a conscious decision that I
was going to work on things that
were, in fact, mission-oriented," he

said. "On the other hand. I gained
the opportunity to work in a multi
disciplinary environment that
allowed me to study problems that I
simply couldn't attack [on Stanford
campus.]"
Bill Madia, Stanford's vice presi
dent for SLAC, was blunt about the
dispute.
"The issue as I understand it is
not about who controls the facility."
he said. "That's unambiguous: It's
their lab."
Officials were quick to dismiss
allegations that the name change is
anything more than recognition of
the center's changing mission.
"I don't think it's about control
at all," Madia said. "It's about how
the name reflects a different kind of
laboratory."
For decades, the linear accelera
tor defined SLAC. and it was the
main focus of research at the center.
Now. attention is being focused on
projects like the Linac Coherent
Light Source, a half-mile extension
of the main accelerator that har
nesses hard X-rays. The $500 million
project — which will enable
researchers to image molecular,
atomic and subatomic particles at an
unprecedented rate and precision
— opens in one year.
"What's happened in the last 10
years is that the centricity of the lin
ear accelerator has changed."
Hodgson said. "The U.S. chose not

" The concern is how a
name change could
not reflect the
wonderful history of
the laboratory."
BILL MADIA, SLAC vice
president

to fund the next generations of par
ticle accelerators required to keep
up in this field."
Regardless of the reason for the
change, many of SLAC's physicists
are unhappy with the possibility of
dropping "Stanford* from the cen
ter's name because they see it as an
insult to the center's illustrious his
tory and are concerned that it may
make it more difficult to attract top
tier researchers.
"It appears, particularly among
engineering staff, that there is great
value, literally, in being associated
with Stanford University." said
Particle Physics and Astrophysics
Prof. Martin Breidenbach. "A
change in the name will break the
manifest link."

According to those involved in the
petition to keep SLAC's name
intact, the primary reason to save
the current name is its historical
reputation.
"The concern is how a name
change could not reflect the won
derful history of the laboratory,"
Madia said.
SLAC, after all. has housed four
Nobel Prize winners, neutralized
arsenic in Indian rivers, discovered
three quarks and imaged DNA tran
scription. Until the Beijing Airport
opened last year, the accelerator
was the longest building in the
world. Only four weeks ago, physi
cists detected the lowest-energy par
ticle of the bottomonium family.
"We're all pretty proud of the
laboratory — not only its past, but
also its present and future," said
DOE site manager Paul Golan.
Despite the recent controversy,
most Stanford and DOE scientists
are hopeful for SLAC's technologi
cal future — regardless of what its
name will be.
"The really remarkable thing is
that we're talking about a laborato
ry that started in 1962, and we're
now looking at the future," Hodgson
said. "We can predict that SLAC is
still going to be here and doing dis
covery-level science."
