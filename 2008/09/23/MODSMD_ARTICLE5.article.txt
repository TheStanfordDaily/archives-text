Stanford School of Medicine announced
on Aug. 26 that it would place severe limita
tions on industry funding of its continuing
medical education (CME) classes. Daig and
device companies will no longer be allowed to
fund specific courses, but will instead be asked
to donate to a pool that will be used for all
classes.
Stanford is now part of a very small group
of medical schools that have restricted compa
nies to "pool funding" for medical education.
The New York Times reported that five other
schools have taken a similar approach, but
Stanford officials suggested that the group is
even smaller.
The new policy is the latest move by the
medical school to mitigate conflicts of interest.
"The decision about CME is really part of
a series of policy decisions on the broad topic
of conflict of interest that have been ongoing
since 2(K)4-2(H)5." said Medical School Dean
Philip Pizzo in an email to The Daily. "We
began with our decision to ban gifts from
industry in 2(X)6. ITiis was followed by other
revisions in our conflict of interest policies for
clinical practice."
year. Pizzo appointed a task force to
look into CME funding, chaired by Dr. Harry
Greenberg,senior associate dean for research.
"There were lots of concerns appearing at
the same time — Congress and various other
groups had expressed concern." Greenberg

said. "We thought it would be reasonable for
Stanford to have a committee and evaluate
the story for industry support for CME at
Stanford, and then to serve that up to the
dean, with our options."
Concerns about industry funding were
indeed brewing in the public: Sen. Chuck
Grassley (R-IA) published a report in April
2007 detailing how companies sponsored
CME courses to increase sales of medical
products.
But Pizzo insisted that this week s decision
is the culmination of a long, thoughtful evalu
ation of conflicts of interest, and not a reaction
to recent concerns.
"The decision to develop the new policies
is in response to the options developed by the
CME Task Force," Pizzo said. "So this has
really been a continuing and evolving assess
ment about industry relations and not a
response to some new or precipitous event."
Pizzo said that it is his belief that the new
policy will improve continuing medical educa
tion at Stanford.
"I do not think that the quality of CME
will be harmed," Pizzo said, "but I do believe
that the integrity of our educational programs
and their freedom from any bias will be better
achieved with these new policies."
The new policy is, in fact, just a part of a
host of measures that Stanford is planning to
improve its ("ME courses.
"Current CME is traditionally lecture
based — what's the newest and greatest, as
opposed to how do we improve the health of
this group of patients," Greenbcrg said. "1
think Rob |Jackler, associate dean for
CME] has plans that we will shift con
tent. irrespective of funding, to better
education of improving outcomes and
quality, and less emphasis on medical
facts."
Still, the threat of losing funding
due to the new policies has a few offi
cials worried about ('ME's future.
"Many of the clinical chairs were
very concerned about that [losing
funding], and I imagine they remain
concerned." Greenberg said. "Most
people would say that it's a likelihood
that funding would go down."
But Pizzo maintained that the goal
of preventing conflicts of interest is
more valuable than the funding dol
lars that the new policy may lose.
"We fully recognize that funding
will decline, but I do not believe that
the concern about funding should
cause us to compromise on the value
of the programs we seek to provide,"
Pizzo said. "They need to be based on
the best science and strongest evi
dence. and not on whether or not
there will be funding to support
them."
