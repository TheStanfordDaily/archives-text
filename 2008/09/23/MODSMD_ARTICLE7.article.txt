## Just how political is this place? Humanitarian service: the new face of political action 
### JONATHAN ANDERSON 
a~"wr~ t's always a bit surprising to find people
who are political," Evan Purcell '09 said
while trying to characterize political life
I on campus. "Politics isn't a big social pres-
M„ ence here — maybe on an email list, but
not at dinner."
Although he may not see it much, when he does wit
ness activism on campus, Purcell has been impressed.
"There's something very 'Stanford' about it."he
said. "When people do get involved, they really get
things done. You know?" He pauses and sticks his
hands into the pockets of his zip-up. "But it's rare that
it comes up at dinner."
Still. Purcell has tried to stay informed. He has also
chosen to take action in the community by teaching
fifth-grade math in East Palo Alto because he"realized
that you have to be involved for your sentiments to
mean anything."
Yet he is not involved with the campus' political cul
ture — at least not directly.
But why not?
Primary colors
During the February presidential primary, the cam
pus galvanized around Barack Obama — student sup
porters registered 650 California voters in a single day
as the official Stanford Facebook Group swelled to 900
members.
At least from one political camp, the political con
sciousness on campus appeared to mushroom.
"We started from the viewpoint that most people
were already for Obama and we got them to reach out
to their own network," said Mark Haney J.D. '09, the
Chapter Coordinator for Students for Barack Obama.
"The campaign really energized them and many of
them are still engaged with the election."
Haney. who attended UC-Berkeley as an under
graduate, said he felt that the group was the only one
organizing politically at Stanford.
"My sense was that people weren't involved with
political things in any way. so they latched on — they

didn't have any other outlet for it."he said.
The group soon had "more [people] making more
phone calls and knocking on more doors" than any of
the surrounding chapters. All at once, Stanford stu
dents had shown that campus could be a nexus for po
litical activity.
The hubbub died down, however, as soon as the na
tional election moved off-campus and out of Califor
nia.
"Since then, it's been a struggle to keep people in
volved." Haney said. "It's easier to sustain involvement
when it's right in front of you."
Without a cause to work on. the students seemed to
move on. As Purcell noted, they had problem sets.
Informed, hut active?
Scott Keyes '09 grew up outside Ohio's Antioch

College, a hotbed of political radicalism. Since coming
to Stanford. Keyes still reads about what's going on
and wrote for a popular political blog, Taegan
Widdard's "Political Wire," last year.

Keyes says he would probably be more in
volved with campus issues and less with na
tional politics if Stanford's environment had
been more engaging.
"Any time you're in a situation where peo
ple are politically active, you have more in-

centive to accomplish things with your own
objectives," he said. Stanford clubs didn't
offer him that incentive. >

Keyes hits on a common perception j
of Stanford's political culture. As Ash
win Mudaliar '09, political director for
the Stanford Democrats, put it, "stu-

dents are knowledgeable about the
world as a whole and make the effort to

stay informed, but the deficiency is that they don't
take the step beyond to affect the process."
Mudaliar sees this lack of participation as a result of
the campus environment.
"1 think Stanford does a very good job at educating
elite people who become leaders: I don't think we do a
very good job nurturing activism on campus," he said.
"Stanford could do more in that regard — a little more
passion."
The presidential primary gave Stanford students
the momentum they needed to get involved. It demon
strated that students were not only informed about

the issues; they could quickly rally around one.
So why is it that the campus has a rep
utation for political dormancy? Mu
daliar hypothesizes that Stanford's
politics are too self-contained: that
without an impetus like the nomi
nation fight, the "talent [is] not
being utilized." Alternatively, the
school's perceived "inactivity"
could actually be the result of a shift


LAURA CHANG/The Stanford Daily
in college activism on the national
level.
Traditional activism meets a
Stanford tradition
Amanda Gelender '09 is some
thing of a traditional college activist.
She's involved with organizations on
queer rights, animal rights and racial
justice, among other things. For like
minded students she has also created
an email list — it's not a forum for
party politics, but rather for activist
causes.
Stanford has come to embody ac
tivism independent of party position.
College students today are more
likely to be involved in local policy
initiatives than civic activism, ac
cording to a 2008 report by the CIR
CLE, a nonpartisan research center
studying youth activism based at
Tufts.The study found that although
"Millennials," people born between

19K4 and 2(K)4. find confrontational
politics "distasteful," they're more
likely to he involved than the previ
ous generation. Today's college stu
dents are tired of partisan politics,
not politics in general.
Keyes doesn't necessarily consid
er the morphing political attitude a
bad thing, as he sees college activism
as impractical and out-of-tune with
Stanford's environment.
He remembers an unsuccessful im
promptu march on President John
1 lennessy's office by the Sweat-Free
Coalition.The 30 protesters, who had
marched from White Plaza, were
told by the receptionist that their
concerns would be evaluated and re
sponded to in the next few months.
ITie coalition had planned on a more
immediate response and abandoned
their sit-in.
Keyes was unimpressed.
"1 think [the march gave] a bad
public image to a good cause," he
said. "Classes had their windows
open while they were walking by
screaming and yelling. It's activism,
but where do you draw the line?"
Perhaps somewhat predictably.

college students were overwhelm
ingly disparaging of traditional ac
tivism. The Millennial Report con
cluded, "Only 12 percent of students
believe that politics is a route
through which people can effect
change."
The report found that far from
being disenfranchised, college youth
had found a new avenue for social
change: humanitarian action. Nearly
SO percent of the high school seniors
had been involved with volunteer
work, a new precedent. Students
were willing to devote their time, lots
of it, to change the status quo, but to
change it through service work.
On campus, the Service for All
(svc4all) email list deluges its recipi
ents with a potpourri of service op
portunities and "volunteers needed"
emails, while emails that advocate
political positions or candidates are
prohibited.
Humanitarian action an
emerging trend
Haney had a problem. He was try
ing to enlist a political base for the

Obama campaign at Stanford, and
he wasn't sure where to look — he
hadn't found a traditional source of
political manpower to tap into. In
stead, what he found was an over
abundance of humanitarians.
"A lot of the people that we
brought into the Obama campaign
were there working on specific is
sues: AIDS or poverty, Dance
Marathon or fraternities," he said.
"They were all established leaders
on campus, with broad networks, but
not people who were very involved
with the Stanford Democrats."
It surprised him that he could get
at "more groups at more angles"
without drawing from established
political groups. Even the feel of
White Plaza, so different from that of
Berkeley's Sproul Plaza, was a testa
ment to the shift.
"At Berkeley, you have a lot more
people involved with political ac
tivism," he said. "At Stanford, we
drew less from people who had expe
rience and more from people who
had leadership in charity and causes."
He laughed,"lt made it easier and
harder; there were so many people
we could bring in."
Haney found that Stanford stu
dents, who had previously been in
volved with such campus issues as
environmental sustainability and
workers' rights, were adding csbama
to their list of causes. His appeal ap
peared to stem from his ability to
blur the line between a "candidate"
and a "cause."
From Haney's perspective, stu
dents embraced Obama the same
way they had embraced the union of
volunteer work and activism. Stu
dents who cooked food for a home
less snelter with SPOON in the
morning an J demonstrated for a liv
ing wage with SLAC in the afternoon
now fit in time for the campaign.
Haney hadn't expected the mar
riage of community service and po

litical action to work out so well. The
students who tutor in East Palo Alto
appeared to be of a different mold
from those who register voters for an
upcoming primary. However, as the
campaign demonstrated, service
groups and political groups at Stan
ford had pulled from the same stu
dent demographic.
But the fusion of social service
and social action wasn't an isolated
incident. New clubs — such as
FACE AIDS, STAN D (Darfur geno
cide) and SEED (environmental
protection) — whose primary focus
is to raise awareness, advocate for so
cial causes by working more as social
lobbyists than service centers. As a
result, club members are less likely
to distinguish between community
service and social action. For college
students,"volunteering" has become
synonymous with "advocacy."
Despite this, the baby boomers
continue to make a point of differen
tiating between political activism
and humanitarian action, leading
those born between 1984 and 2(X)4 to
pick up a label — the "Quiet Gener
ation."
But as author Adam Waxman al
luded to in Explosion of Youth Ac
tivism Around the Iraq War, college
students' previous involvement in
public service hasn't come at a cost
to college activism. Rather, advocacy
clubs have been learning to harness
students' service habits.
The pragmatic approach
Keyes never did get involved with
the single-service issues on campus.
Though he found his niche writing
for a political blog, he feels that the
campus offered him ample opportu
nities to get involved. The activism
approach just didn't suit him.
"[Campus] is a fairly active place,
but it's sensibly active," he said. "We
change policy on campus. In the
grand scheme of things, these aren't

humongous undertakings, but we're
doing what we can."
For Gelender, "sensible" action,
such as organizing talks, just doesn't
do enough. She has found that stu
dents are content to plan speaker
events and raise money but unwilling
to go further.
That, to her, is the problem: stu
dents aren't looking to change the
status quo.
"Students on this campus are
very resistant to engaging in social
justice work that involves challeng
ing authority," she said. "How many
organizations do service work in
EPA? Many. How many advocate
for policy reform that actually ad
dresses education inequity? I can
not think of any."
"Students tend to be drawn to
work that is not systemic — they'd
rather do work that adults applaud
and sidestep root issues of injustice,"
Gelender continued. "They do not
want to challenge those norms. They
have benefited from systems of priv
ilege."
However, during Admit Weekend
2007, the norms were challenged
when student activists lined the steps
of Memorial Auditorium to publicize
the demonstrators fasting in White
Plaza in response to Stanford's living
wage policy.The students distributed
fliers and encouraged the ProFros to
bring up the increased cost of living
during Hennessy's address.
Stanford Labor Action Coalition
(SLAC) activists were combining an
individual service issue, an inconven
ient protest and a sensible new poli
cy initiative, and they claimed suc
cess that Friday. The administration
adopted their policy, which broad
ened the number of contracted
workers and increased minimum
wage.
Lessons learned
Ultimately, Stanford students
don't need to re-invent political ac
tivism to transform the campus —
they already have the tools to do so.
Armed with both service-oriented
and more conventional approaches
to activism, student groups have a
variety of models to engage students.
Mudaliar may have had it right all
along. There's a lot of talent on this
campus, and who better to move
things along than a group of passion
ate Stanford students?
