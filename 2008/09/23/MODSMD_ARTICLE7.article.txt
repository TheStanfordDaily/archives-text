## Just how political is this place? Humanitarian service: the new face of political action 
### JONATHAN ANDERSON 
a~"wr~ t's always a bit surprising to find people
who are political," Evan Purcell '09 said
while trying to characterize political life
I on campus. "Politics isn't a big social pres-
M„ ence here — maybe on an email list, but
not at dinner."
Although he may not see it much, when he does wit
ness activism on campus, Purcell has been impressed.
"There's something very 'Stanford' about it."he
said. "When people do get involved, they really get
things done. You know?" He pauses and sticks his
hands into the pockets of his zip-up. "But it's rare that
it comes up at dinner."
Still. Purcell has tried to stay informed. He has also
chosen to take action in the community by teaching
fifth-grade math in East Palo Alto because he"realized
that you have to be involved for your sentiments to
mean anything."
Yet he is not involved with the campus' political cul
ture — at least not directly.
But why not?
Primary colors
During the February presidential primary, the cam
pus galvanized around Barack Obama — student sup
porters registered 650 California voters in a single day
as the official Stanford Facebook Group swelled to 900
members.
At least from one political camp, the political con
sciousness on campus appeared to mushroom.
"We started from the viewpoint that most people
were already for Obama and we got them to reach out
to their own network," said Mark Haney J.D. '09, the
Chapter Coordinator for Students for Barack Obama.
"The campaign really energized them and many of
them are still engaged with the election."
Haney. who attended UC-Berkeley as an under
graduate, said he felt that the group was the only one
organizing politically at Stanford.
"My sense was that people weren't involved with
political things in any way. so they latched on — they

didn't have any other outlet for it."he said.
The group soon had "more [people] making more
phone calls and knocking on more doors" than any of
the surrounding chapters. All at once, Stanford stu
dents had shown that campus could be a nexus for po
litical activity.
The hubbub died down, however, as soon as the na
tional election moved off-campus and out of Califor
nia.
"Since then, it's been a struggle to keep people in
volved." Haney said. "It's easier to sustain involvement
when it's right in front of you."
Without a cause to work on. the students seemed to
move on. As Purcell noted, they had problem sets.
Informed, hut active?
Scott Keyes '09 grew up outside Ohio's Antioch

College, a hotbed of political radicalism. Since coming
to Stanford. Keyes still reads about what's going on
and wrote for a popular political blog, Taegan
Widdard's "Political Wire," last year.

Keyes says he would probably be more in
volved with campus issues and less with na
tional politics if Stanford's environment had
been more engaging.
"Any time you're in a situation where peo
ple are politically active, you have more in-

centive to accomplish things with your own
objectives," he said. Stanford clubs didn't
offer him that incentive. >

Keyes hits on a common perception j
of Stanford's political culture. As Ash
win Mudaliar '09, political director for
the Stanford Democrats, put it, "stu-

dents are knowledgeable about the
world as a whole and make the effort to

stay informed, but the deficiency is that they don't
take the step beyond to affect the process."
Mudaliar sees this lack of participation as a result of
the campus environment.
"1 think Stanford does a very good job at educating
elite people who become leaders: I don't think we do a
very good job nurturing activism on campus," he said.
"Stanford could do more in that regard — a little more
passion."
The presidential primary gave Stanford students
the momentum they needed to get involved. It demon
strated that students were not only informed about

the issues; they could quickly rally around one.
So why is it that the campus has a rep
utation for political dormancy? Mu
daliar hypothesizes that Stanford's
politics are too self-contained: that
without an impetus like the nomi
nation fight, the "talent [is] not
being utilized." Alternatively, the
school's perceived "inactivity"
could actually be the result of a shift
