NEW YORK (AP) — President
Bush sought to assure anxious world
leaders on Monday that the United
States is taking "hold, aggressive,
decisive action" to rescue the crisis
ridden economy with a $700 billion
bailout package. "The whole world
is watching to see if we can act
quickly," Bush said, prodding law
makers in Washington to approve
his plan.
Bush balanced the economic
meltdown with foreign policy prob
lems from Pakistan and North Korea
to Russia and Iran as he opened
three days of diplomacy with presi
dents and prime ministers assembled

for the annual ministerial meeting of
the I J.N. General Assembly.
ITie activities were opening with
a reception Monday night for for
eign delegations hosted by Bush and
his wife, Laura, at the Waldorf-
Astoria Hotel.
After seven years of criticizing
the U.N. for its huge, costly bureau
cracy and indecisiveness in the face
of grave problems. Bush will make
his final address to the General
Assembly on Tuesday. His speech,
scheduled to last 15 minutes, was to
stress the need for multinational
diplomacy .
"Hie nation's burgeoning financial
crisis, anchored on Wall Street not
far from Bush's hotel, overshadowed
his U.N. visit. Bush is in the awkward

position of advocating capitalism,
free-trade and deregulation through
out this presidency but then oversee
ing a costly government takeover of
failing financial institutions.
White House press secretary
Dana Perino,explaining Bush's turn
about, said "this was not the presi
dent's first instinct; that he would not
have wanted to take this action to
help these companies if he wasn't
convinced by the considered judg
ment of his senior economic team
that it was critical in order to protect
the American taxpayers and the
American economy as a whole."
With the U.S. economy inextrica
bly intertwined with the finances of
other countries, the turmoil from
Wall Street to Main Street will natu

rally be a topic of Bush's discussions
in New York. Perino said.
Before leaving Washington. Bush
said differences over details of the
administration's bailout plan were
understandable. But he warned law
makers not to bog down.
"Americans are watching to see if
Democrats and Republicans, the
Congress and the White House, can
come together to solve this problem
with the urgency it warrants," Bush
said. "Indeed, the whole world is
watching to see if we can act quickly."
In the diplomatic world, it is a
time of usual turmoil.
North Korea is backing away
from pledges to abandon nuclear
weapons, and Iran is pursuing a
nuclear program in defiance of U.S.

and international demands. Russia
has drawn condemnation from the
West for its invasion of U.S.-backed
Georgia. Violence is mounting in
Afghanistan, and Pakistan is reeling
from a weekend truck bombing at
the Marriott hotel that killed 53 peo
ple. including the Czech ambassador
and two U.S. Defense Department
employees.
Hush, on his way to New York,
stopped in New Jersey to raise
money for two GOP congressional
candidates. About 200 people
attended the event in an affluent
area of Colts Neck. N.J.. that benefit
ed Chris Myers and state Sen.
Leonard Lance. Tickets ranged from
$1,000 to $10,000 for a photo with
the president.
