*i/ | ' go-betweens and secret trysts - Medieval Courtly Love was long
bought to be a typically and wholly European literary phenome
n°n' l ' r r some t * me now sc^°^ars bave realized that the lan-
of European Courtly love shares many motifs and images
* ' * 4 wlt ' l r ' ie Arabic poetry of al-Andalus, and more recently strong
parallels have been pointed out with the plots, conventions, and
rhetoric of another Islamic literature, that of medieval Persia. The
xa princesses, knights, minstrels, chivalry, adultery, go-betweens and
" t \.l "y* secret trysts are all central elements in medieval Persian narrative
•*% \ verse, much of which was written before the appearance of these
' same motifs in Europe.
£ The course will examine some short lyric Persian poems that
v* incorporate these themes, as well as three Persian narratives, two
of which will be read in part and one entirely. The one that will
I,' * be given most emphasis is the 11th century romance Vis and
f\\ Iff? Ramin, which many scholars, including the instructor (who is also
/ MMMMt the romance's translator) believe is a major source for the greatest
cgMB European courtly love narrative of all, Tristan and Isolde.
jTT. A- All texts will be read in English and no knowledge of Persian is
required for the course.
