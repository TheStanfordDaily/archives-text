## Editorial Applause for new aid program 
### 
As the school year begins, many stu
dents paying their fall-quarter tu
ition bills are shelling out far fewer
dollars — all thanks to the University's new
financial aid initiative. The editorial board
applauds the aid program announced last
February and considers it a vital step to help
ing students attend Stanford because of per
sonal preference, not price.
The new aid exempts students whose par
ents earn under $100,000 from paying tu
ition and those whose parents earn under
$60,000 from contributing to the costs of
their child's education. Students will no
longer take out loans as part of their finan
cial aid packages, and the University has
made its method of calculating family con
tributions more generous.
The policy is a big change for Stanford —
Director of Financial Aid Karen Cooper
told The Daily last February that it saves
many families thousands of dollars. With the
economy reeling, there is no better time for
this initiative, as it's one less thing to worry
about when many families are concerned
about their finances.
Improvements in financial aid are critical
to helping students choose Stanford because
it is the right fit for them. For many students
affected by the policy change, attending
Stanford is cheaper than attending a UC. We
hope that this policy will draw the best stu
dents to Stanford in the coming years, not
simply those who can afford it.
Stanford, however, should not sit idly by
praising its new financial aid policy this year.
Much progress can still be made, and the
University will only fall behind if it rides on
its past achievements. Though administra
tors insist that the policy change was not an
attempt to copy rival private colleges' ef
forts, Stanford fell behind other schools in
boosting its financial aid offerings. Harvard
announced changes to its policy in Decem
ber, and Yale did so soon after.
There is still much to be done. The Uni
versity could, for instance, better reach out
to higher-income students. While changes to
the calculation of the expected family con
tribution calculation and the elimination of
loans as part of the aid package help parents
earning well over $ 100,000. the changes best
target the lower-income brackets.
Harvard, however, announced sweeping
changes for families earning up to $180,000,
allowing them to pay up to 10 percent of
their income. When it comes to public rela
tions, $180,000 is a much better sounding
number than $100,000. Indeed, Cooper told
The Daily last February that Stanford is
reaching out to "lowest income families
first." But those in the upper-income brack
ets are just as likely to face the struggle of
choosing Stanford over a less expensive
school. Though Stanford's endowment re
sources do not match Harvard's, the Univer
sity should work toward devoting more re
sources to this income group.

Similarly, Stanford lags behind Harvard
in other respects. The East Coast school has
eliminated home equity in financial aid cal
culations. Though Stanford's new program
decreases how much home equity will affect
aid offerings, eliminating it would show a
commitment to providing as much aid as
possible.Though owning a home does reflect
financial stability, houses are not liquid as
sets that can be easily used to contribute to
education costs.
7"he editorial board believes that this year
is the time for Stanford to take the lead. Our
effort should not simply be to match Har
vard and Yale's initiatives, but to make
changes that other schools have not. There
are many areas where Stanford could forge
ahead. For instance, when students receive
merit scholarships totaling more than the
student self-help expectations, the Universi
ty replaces would-be Stanford financial aid
with these funds. Allowing merit scholar
ships to go toward the parent contribution
would reward students who worked hard to
receive merit awards, and it is one step Har
vard hasn't taken.
While many schools ask students to work
to contribute to their cost of their education,
Stanford could take the lead in eliminating
those expectations. Requiring a summer
earnings contribution penalizes students
who want to pursue non-profit work, and re
quiring students to work during the school
year hurts those who are heavily involved in
extracurricular activities. We hope that
someday students on financial aid will be
able to choose the same extracurricular of
ferings as their peers and not worry about
meeting their student contribution.
Perhaps the most significant gap in Stan
ford's aid program is its assistance to inter
national students. Stanford has yet to be
come need-blind for international appli
cants, meaning that applying for financial aid
can hurt their chances of admission. The
University still has only a limited amount of
aid devoted to this population. Though ad
ministrators have said that increasing finan
cial aid for international students is a long
term goal for the University (and part of the
Stanford Challenge), we hope that Stanford
will take the lead on this effort and not sim
ply rush to catch up when other schools
begin pursuing the initiative. A handful of
schools, including Harvard, already are
need-blind for international students. We
hope Stanford is next.
Stanford's changes to the financial aid
program for 2008-2009 are truly a remark
able achievement.The editorial board hopes
that these are signs of things to come. We
know that changes cannot be made
overnight, but leading the pack in making
those reforms is a critical step for the Uni
versity. Showing its commitment to afford
ability is one way Stanford can outshine its
peer institutions instead of simply working
to prove that it is equal.
