# STUDENT LIFE
## New Student Orientation ends 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
After a week packed with dorm
cheers and introductory events. New
Student Orientation, or NSO as it is
known around campus, formally con
cluded on Monday night.
NSO kicked off with Freshman
Convocation, during which President
John Hennessy addressed the new
class in the Inner Quad. A number of
programs designed to give freshmen
a sense of future challenges and
opportunities followed in the ensuing
days, including Discover Stanford,
Five Keys for Academic Success and
Three Books.
Freshmen were also exposed to a
more entertaining side of Stanford.
"The Real World: Stanford," written
and performed by students, cleverly
explored meaningful issues related
to the beginning of college, including
health, wellness and safety issues.
"Faces of Community" exposed the
new students to the multifaceted cul
tural component of Stanford's cam
pus through reflections, narrative,
dance and music.
NSO culminated with the "O-
Show" on Monday night, featuring
Stanford's dance, martial arts and a
cappella groups.
"In planning NSO, we want to
achieve three things," explained
Dean of Freshmen and Transfer
Students Julie Lythcott-Haims '89.
"First, to introduce students to our
community of scholars and the aca
demic opportunities and offerings

available; second, to begin building a
sense of belonging to this place; and
finally, to answer nuts-and-bolts
questions."
A few new programs were added
to NSO this year. "Demystifying
Faculty-Student Interactions" was
designed to take the popular "talk to
faculty" mantra and give students
practical advice about how (and how
not) to go about doing so, Lythcott-
Haims said. Stanford 101 was a pro
gram centered on giving the fresh
men a brief look at Stanford's histo
ry, legacy and traditions.
Organizers viewed NSO as a suc
cess, which Lythcott-Haims attrib
uted in large part to an ever
strengthening partnership with
Residential & Dining Enterprises,
Residential Education,
Undergraduate Advising &
Research, Facilities Operations and
Event and Labor Services.
"Strong relationships with these
offices means everything runs more
smoothly," she said.
In large part, freshmen agreed.
"I found President Hennessy's
speech [at convocation] to be
extremely inspiring," said Bronwyn
Reed '12. "It really drove home to
me how many doors really were
opening up for me, just being here
and being surrounded by this caliber
of students and faculty."
Social events received mixed
reviews. Justin Krumm '12 said he
enjoyed dorm bonding events as well
as the NSGlow party, while Reed
added that some of the dances, such

as NSGlow and BROC Party, "felt a
little forced and were sort of boring."
Shahryar Malik 12 said he would
have liked more events in which
freshmen could get to know each
other, adding that Band Run was one
of the highlights of his NSO experi
ence.
"I think they should have more
stuff that pumps you up about the
school and its traditions," he said.
Malik contrasted NSO to what he
said was an intimate, close-knit
International Student Orientation.
"[At NSO] a lot of things were
optional, so people would go to some
and not others," he said. "It was
strange that it was divided — sort of
like make-your-own NSO. I didn't
really get to know people. There was
so much going on that there wasn't
anything to bond you together."
Reed said the program could have
been a few days shorter.
"At some point it started feeling a
little bit too long," she said, "almost
like they were just trying to fill the
time before classes."
But Reed and her classmates cer
tainly won't be bored for long. With
the start of classes, clubs, intramural
sports and more, the Class of 2012
will soon be looking back at the
activity-crammed days of NSO like it
was a vacation.
