## CARDINAL DOWNED TWICE Men come up short in Nike Invite, look to rebound vs. Broncos 
### JACOB JOHNSON DESK EDITOR 
Brant Bishop is an optimistic guy. But when
asked the about the disappointment of losing
two close games at the Stanford Nike Invitation
al last weekend. Bishop, a junior midfielder and
consummate team player, gave a half-smile and
shrugged his shoulders.
"It's hard to put words to it,"he said.
Redshirt senior Ryan Imamura needed only
one word to describe Stanford's weekend:
"Frustrating."
In front of a lively crowd of more than 1,400
fans. Stanford squared off against the No. 12
Creighton Bluejays on Friday night. Many fresh
man dorms were in attendance and gave the
Cardinal great fan support throughout the
game.
Stanford's defense was stout throughout the
first half, but the offense was unable to muster
many opportunities. Junior midfielder Michael
Strickland was critical of himself and his fellow
midfielders for their "hectic" play and inability
to control the ball in the early minutes of the
game. The Creighton defense played tough, and
both sides were scoreless at the half.
Imamura sustained a cut lip when he collided
with senior Tom Montgomery and had to leave
the game just before the end of the first period.
He was treated during the break — the medical
staff quickly stitched up the tear in his lip — and
returned to action in the second half.
Stanford seemed to take command of the
game to start the second period, but the men
were unable to break through the Jays' backline.
"We had opportunities to put the ball in the
back of the net,"said senior defender Tim Jones,
one of the team's leaders and most experienced
players.
Creighton finally broke through in the 83rd
minute. Imamura collided with junior goalkeep
er John Moore as he ran out to block a shot.The
ball "squirted out to one of [Creighton's] play
ers," Strickland said. Sophomore defender Ryan
Thomas hustled across the box to intercept the
ball, but he was unable to stop Creighton mid
fielder Ethan Finlay from finding the back of the
net.
Moore ran to the back of the goal, picked up
the ball and hurled it back onto the field in frus
tration.
The Stanford men played with a sense of ur-

Despite the tough loss, the Stanford men
were upbeat going into Sunday's showdown ver

team's performance, if not the result.
"I don't think there's a team out there who
can play us out of the park." he said.
"We played well... [we] definitely weren't
overmatched," Strickland added.
When Stanford plays Friday and Sunday
games over a weekend, the starters often have
only a light workout in between games. The
players who didn't see much action in the Friday
game participate in a tougher workout Saturday,
usually an intense scrimmage.
" The guvs who played a lot on Friday went
for a light jog." said Jones, one of five Stanford
players to go the full 90 minutes. "The whole
time we were basically cheering on the guys who
didn't play as much to help keep spirits up."
Bishop also noticed the team's positive atti

But the Cardinal suffered anoth

deflected off the cross or sidebars,

"We have a lot to work on,"
Strickland said Monday, adding that
the team needs to develop a "mean

fense, confidence, creativity and ball
control are other areas of the game
that the Cardinal will need to im
