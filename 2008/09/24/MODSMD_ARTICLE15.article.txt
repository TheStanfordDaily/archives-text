## After rough opening schedule, Stanford off to a 3-9 start 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA STAFF WRITER 
Fresh off of its first NCAA tournament ap
pearanee since 2000 — and first winning sea
son in six years — Stanford field hockey en
ters the 2008 season looking to continue last
year's success.
The Cardinal women had a breakthrough
season in 2007. notching the second-highest
win total (13) in program history and a Nor-
Pac Conference Championship. They return
nine starters and blend experience with fresh
talent from several underclassmen. However,
a rough start to the season has the Cardinal
facing an uphill climb to repeat last season's
achievements.
Two freshmen followed their impressive
Stanford seasons with an invitation to repre
sent their countries in international competi
tion. Camille Gandhi was selected to the Unit
ed States Under-21 Field Hockey National
Team, as well as the Junior Pan American
Games in Mexico City. Gandhi had an incred
ible season and was named 2(X)7 NorPac
Rookie of the Year. She ranks fourth on the
team thus far with six goals and five assists.
Xanthe Travlos was chosen for the Eng
land Under-21 team to compete at the Euro-
Hockey Junior Nations Championship. Trav
los finished the 2007 season with a team-best
71 shots, nine goals, five assists and 23 points
and was an NFHCA First Team West Region
al All-American.
To open the season, the Stanford women
hosted Drexel University on Aug. 25. losing 3-
1. Sophomore Katherine Donner had the only
goal for the Cardinal, assisted by teammate
Gandhi. Senior Hillary Braun led .Stanford
with three shot attempts, followed by Gandhi
with two. Freshman goalkeeper Beth Ridley
made her collegiate debut with a game-high
nine saves.
On Sept. 2, the Cardinal began its most
grueling road stretch of the year, playing three
games in five days, including No. 10 Michigan
State and No. 9 Michigan. Beginning the game
strong, the Stanford women took an early 2-1

lead into halftime against the Spartans. Bat
tling through the second half, and eventually
forcing an overtime, Michigan State barely
survived when Jeamie Deacon scored three
minutes into the extra period for a 3-2 victory.
The Stanford goals were scored by freshman
Stephanie Byrne — her first career goal
and sophomore Jaimee Erickson.
Michigan then handled the Cardinal with
ease, winning 5-1. Playing two top-10 teams in
a row. Stanford was once again thwarted, as
the Stanford's only goal was scored by Byrne.
However, the Stanford women ended their
trip on a high note. Their final match was
against Central Michigan, and they dominat
ed in the second half to secure a 3-2 victory.
Travlos scored the first goal, unassisted, for
her first goal of the year. She was quickly fol
lowed by another goal from Gandhi, assisted
by Braun and junior Jen Luther.The final goal
was scored by junior Rachel Mo/enter as the
Cardinal picked up its first win of the season.
The next match for the Cardinal was
against No. 4 lowa, which was once again a
close but disappointing game for Stanford.
Byrne led the team with two goals, and Stan
ford had a 2-1 lead early in the second half.
Unfortunately.it wasn't enough for a C ardinal
victory.

Stanford suffered yet another loss at the
hands of No. I 1 ) Albany, losing 1-0. The game
marked the end of the Cardinal's brutal early
season schedule, in which four out of the six
teams it played were nationally ranked.
Later, in the NorPac Opener against Ap
palachian State, four different players scored
for the Cardinal, leading to a much-needed 4-
I victory, as the Cardinal looked to rebuild its
confidence and grab some momentum. Stan
ford easily dominated the Mountaineers, es
tablishing season highs in shot attempts and
penalty corners. Senior Bailey Richardson
had the first goal, followed by goals from Mi
dori Uehara, Erickson and Donner.
Ilie success, though, was followed by two
overtime losses to Radford and then Long
wood. The Radford game ended with a score
of 1-o,and the Longwood game had a score of
2-1. Hie two tough overtime losses marked
the end of the three-game trip, and the Cardi
nal returned to the Farm with a season record
of 3-9.
Next up for Stanford is a Saturday home
match against Pacific. The game is scheduled
to start at I p.m.

Stanford, which went to the NCAA tournament just a year ago, hasn't been able to replicate that
success yet this season, as the team has faced four ranked opponents over its first 12 games.
