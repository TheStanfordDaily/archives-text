# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Stanford seeks first national title since 2002 
### KENAN JIANG STAFF WRITER 
After finishing fourth in the nation last
year, the No. 3 Stanford men's water polo
team will look to supplant reigning national
champion California and No. 2 USC in its
hunt for the national crown in the 2008 sea
son.
The Cardinal was relatively young last
year, as three of the top four goal scorers
were underclassmen. Hut the team has ma
tured quickly this season and is a strong fa
vorite to win its first national title since 2002.
ITie Golden Bears have won the past two
national titles, while the Trojans won in 2003
and 2005.
Stanford will rely primarily on its upper
classmen this year. I"he Cardinal landed a
top recruiting class, however, led by fresh
man Jacob Smith. A 6-foot-2 driver, Smith
was the top recruit in the nation after lead
ing his San Diego Coronado High School
squad to the OF San Diego Section Divi
sion II title last year. Smith shot an incredi
ble 53 percent his senior season, while scor
ing S3 goals and gaining a spot on the U.S.
Youth National Team.
"I am very excited to have signed Jacob
Smith," coach John Vargas said to
NCAA.com."Jacob's athletic ability and ac
ademic record is incredible. I le is a funda
mentally sound player with dynamic offen
sive skills. 1 believe Jacob will make an im
mediate impact on our team."
The freshman class also includes Alex
Avery of the Menlo School, a local product
who led the Stanford high school water polo
club team to third-place finishes at the Ju
nior Olympics in each of the past three years
and Ryan Brown of Archbishop Mitty, a
three-time team MVP and an All-American
for the West Valley Water Polo Club in
Monte Sereno, Calif.
The sophomore class includes goalkeep
er Brian Pingree, who will share duties in the
goal with junior Jimmie Sandman. Sopho
more driver Alex Pulido scored 14 goals last
year as a freshman and looks to be a serious
offensive threat. Utility Jeffrey
Schwimer, who scored the game win
ner in a triple-overtime, sudden
death, 10-9 win against Cal last
weekend at the NorCal tournament,
has the potential to break out as well.
"Our success on offense will not
be measured by who scores, but in
terms of working together," Vargas
told GoStanford.com. "Our team

work will depend on unselfishness
— everyone understanding their
roles and playing their role at a con
sistently high level every time we
enter the water."
Juniors, who arguably make up
the backbone of the team, include
redshirt two-meter offensive player
Ryan McCarthy and Jimmie Sand
man, the Cardinal's main goalkeep
er. Brothers Drac and Janson Wigo
have not disappointed since their
All-American debut season as fresh
men. Success in the sport seems to
run in the Wigo blood, as their broth
er Wolf Wigo was a four-time All-

American at Stanford and played on
three Olympic teams. The Cardinal
will continue to rely on their contri
bution as well as one of college water
polo's best players, junior Sage
Wright. Wright co-led as the team's
leading scorer last year at 33 goals
and was named to AWCPC All-
America First Team as well as the
All-MPSF First Team.
"We have had a great off-season
training program," Vargas told
GoStanford.com. "The guys under
stand that striving for excellence is
the gradual result of them always
working to be better, always improv

ing, never being satisfied and doing
everything to the best of their abili
ties.
The veteran leadership on
team will include Will Hindle-Katel.
