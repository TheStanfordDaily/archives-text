# Searching for that playmaker
## 
### 
It was a big win for the Cardinal,
no doubt. In front of a screaming
home crowd, filled with newly ar
rived freshmen and freshly returned
upperclassmen. Stanford football
sputtered at the start before demol
ishing San Jose State in the second
half. Including redshirt junior QB
Tavita Pritchard's one-yard touch
down run with just 38 seconds re
maining in the second quarter, the
Cardinal scored 23 unanswered
points from roughly the halfway
mark tin.
That kind of dominance is good.
Granted, against San Jose State,
that's the kind of dominance one
would expect Jim Harbaugh's squad
to have exhibited all night long, but
better late than never.
No, the real problem isn't what
happened on the field Saturday
against the Spartans. The real prob
lem is rather what didn't happen.The
Cardinal didn't really change its
M.O. in defeating San Jose State with
a game plan that featured plenty of
junior running back Toby Gerhart
(22 carries for 148 yards and a touch
down) and little else to get excited
about.
ITiere is still no consistent receiv
ing threat out wide, as sophomore re
ceiver Doug Baldwin and junior
speedster Richard Sherman led the
team with a pair of catches for 49
yards and three catches for 33 yards,
respectively. It speaks volumes that
the third-best receiver on the stat
sheet was quarterback Tavita
Pritchard, who caught one pass from
himself on a ball that was batted back
into his hands. Pritchard gained 25
yards on the play. No other Stanford
receiver had more than 15 receiving
yards on the game.
One way to look at it is that the
Cardinal has featured a balanced
passing attack. That's certainly the
way to spin it if you want to praise
Harbaugh's offense thus far on the
year. Against the Spartans, Pritchard
threw for 159 yards, spreading 13
completions out to eight different re
ceivers (including himself).
But on the flip side, one could also
clearly make the argument that
progress needs to be made if Stan
ford is to stand any chance at com
peting within the Pac-lOover the rest
of the season. I will.
Toby Gerhart's emergence has
been an absolute godsend for the
Cardinal in 2008. You could actually
argue that he emerged in '07 against
San Jose State before being sidelined
for the remainder of the season with
a knee injury. But either way. a sud
denly steady - and sometimes spec
tacular â€” running game has been
missing for a long time on the Farm
and its appearance means there's a
stable foundation on which the rest
of the offense should be able to
build.
Hie simple rule of offensive foot
ball that is evident when you're
watching either the college or pro
game is that playmakers win games.
Yes. it's incredibly important to have
an offensive line that can protect the
passer and open up holes in the run
game. Yes, it's absolutely crucial to
have a QB who avoids mistakes and
keeps his team in games.
But the teams that truly dominate
on offense are the ones that have too
much star-power for the defense to
account for. A defense can load the
box with eight or more men to stop
or slow even the most tremendous of
ground games. It can double cover a
great receiver to ensure that he
rarely, if ever, breaks loose for a big
play. It can harass a great OB with
constant blitzing (hello, Trent Fid
wards' Stanford career!) and keep
him on his back by bringing the
house.
But a defense can't do all these
things at once.
Iliis is why following a team's of
fense from year to year can be mad
dening, because it's hard to pinpoint
exactly where the tipping point lies.
In the NF L., the Dallas Cowboys look
to boast one of the league's most ex
plosive offenses in 2008 because they
can throw it deep to T. 0., or short
over the middle to Jason Witten.
Ibey can pound the ball with Marion
Barber or show flash on the ground
with rookie Felix Jones. And direct
ing it all, they have one of the best
