## 84 use Web to cheat on GMAT Ten GSB applicants and one graduate implicated 
### RYAN MAC STAFF WRITER 
Ten applicants to the Stanford
Graduate School of Business and one
recent graduate saw their GMAT scores
cancelled early this month by the
Graduate Management Admission
Council (GMAC) due to their involve
ment with an illegal test preparation Web
site.
In a recently released statement, the
GSB announced that it would not take any
action against the graduate. All 10 appli
cants for admission were rejected.
On Sept. 9. GMAC concluded its inves
tigation against Scoretop.com. which was
found guilty of posting live test questions
copyrighted by the GMAT. The investiga
tion turned up 11 students who were found
guilty of posting live questions onto the
site and 73 others who acknowledged
viewing such questions. Those who posted
questions have been banned from taking
the test for three years.
While it is unknown which group the
unnamed graduate falls into, Stanford has
decided not to charge the test taker of any
wrongdoing.
"The graduate whose score was can
celled recently met with [Dean Robert
Joss] to discuss this situation." said MBA
Admission Director Derrick Bolton in a
statement to The Daily. "We determined
there were no grounds for any penalty."
But for the 10 applicants involved in
the scandal, there will be consequences.
Not only were all 10 rejected from
Stanford, but Bolton went on to mention
that they would need to explain their
actions if they were ever to apply again.
"If any test taker whose score was can
celled reapplies, we will require, at mini
mum. an explanation from the test taker of
what he/she did, what he/she knew at the
time of that action, why he/she pursued
that action, what the results of her/his
actions were and whether he/she felt this
action was ethical," he wrote.
Furthermore, GMAC has mentioned
that of the business schools around the
world that were affected by the investiga
tion. Stanford was by far one of the hard
est hit. While business schools at
Columbia, Harvard, MIT and Yale were
unaffected by the investigation, Stanford,
with 11 cancelled test scores, tops the list
of impacted institutions.
As for the investigation itself, GMAC
was awarded $2.35 million dollars in dam
ages from New Oriental Educational
Group for trademark and copyright
infringement. Scoretop. guilty of selling
test services for about $30 a month, was
also forced to relinquish its domain name
and a hard drive of student names that was
later used to track down the K4 test takers.
Scoretop.com. now owned by GMAC,
provides a serious warning to those stu
dents hoping to gain an unfair advantage.
"WARNING! If you are looking for
'real' GMAT exam questions, THINK
AGAIN." the site now reads. "GMAC
takes cheating very seriously, especially


BECCA DEL MONTE/
The Stanford Daily
attempts to obtain access to live test
questions in advance of an exam.
We also take very seriously any
unauthorized distribution of our
copyrighted GMAT preparation
materials."
GMAC went on to sav that the

only appropriate materials for
preparation were those offered by
the company itself, and not outside
sources. Stanford echoed this idea in
cautioning other potential appli
cants to the GSB.
"We hope that they also might
learn from the experience by
reflecting on their actions and tak
ing ownership for their errors, then
sharing those explanations and
insights with us," Bolton said. "This
is a cautionary tale about the pitfalls

of test prep, especially on the
Internet. Even good intent can lead
to bad outcomes if you're not very
careful."
According to Forbes.com, about
200,000 MBA hopefuls take the
GMAT test each year, and over
4,000 graduate management pro
grams use this test in their admis
sion processes.
