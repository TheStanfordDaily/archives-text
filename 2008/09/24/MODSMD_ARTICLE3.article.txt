# Investments grow slightly
## Stanford Management Company gets 6.2 percent return in down market 
### JAMES HOHMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Anticipation of the credit crunch and
spike in oil prices positioned Stanford to
report a robust 6.2 percent return on the
investments in its endowment fund for last
year.
Tuesday's announcement — for the fiscal
year that ended June 30 — exceeded the
expectations of those who worried market
turmoil would lead to losses, but the per
formance still paled in comparison to the 23
percent growth posted for the prior year.
That could mean "some modest reduc
tions in spending" for the next academic
year, according to Stanford Chief Financial
Officer Randy Livingston '75 GSB '79. He
called the lower returns "terrific given the
challenging market conditions" but warned
that more might be spent from the endow
ment this year than is taken in. That could
mean a tighter budget for next year.
And the endowment fund's chief execu
tive. John Powers GSB '83, warned of a
"pretty slow recovery" ahead for the econo

my.
"Every day I think. 'That has to be the
ultimate event,' and I'm surprised by the
events of the next day," Powers said. "The
credit disruptions are so pervasive that
there will continue to be landmines for a
long time. I'm cautiously feeling that we're
approaching the end of the major spate of
negative news."
Accounting for money spent, the total size
of the official University endowment
remained at $17.2 billion on Aug. 31, nearly
the same size as a year earlier.
Powers has long warned that "if it seems
like a bubble, it probably is." and advised
last year that 20-plus-percent annual returns
were unsustainable. He called the 6.2 per
cent gain "hard-fought."
The University's returns were relatively
strong. Of the 20 largest college endowment
funds that have announced their results,
only two others — Harvard and Duke —
have announced gains greater than six per
cent. In the same period, the S&P's 500
Index was down 13.1 percent and the
Lehman Aggregate Bond Index, which

tracks the U.S. bond
market, was up 7.1
percent.
Around April
2007, Powers said
managers at
Stanford's endow
ment decided there
was something of a
bubble in the credit
markets and began
to ramp up invest
ments that would
become profitable

as loans and credit became harder to obtain.
Even with this foresight. Powers said, they
didn't anticipate the extent to which the col
lapse of the credit market would reverber
ate into other parts of the investment port
folio, creating fear in equity markets and
bringing down real estate prices.
"The unwind has been swifter and more
painful than we would have anticipated." he
said. "Credit lubricates the economy, and
there's very little available."
A bet on natural resources, the portfolio

bulked up on oil and gas beyond its long
term targets, helped Stanford outpace Yale,
which only reported a 4.5 percent gain.
Powers believes some parts of the market
have overcorrected. and he's moved some
money into investments he thinks will bene
fit from recovery. He didn't elaborate on
those, and he said he could not give specifics
about how the endowment has performed
since the end of the fiscal year in June.
"We don't know where the bottom is. so
we don't want to put all the money out at
once," he said. "But we think we've seen
[places] where there's fundamental value
not reflected in the current asset price. The
rebound will not be as quick as the unwind
ing was."
Still, he said, the endowment fund is not
rethinking its fundamental commitment to
investments in private equity, private real
estate and emerging markets. Unlike some
mutual funds, the endowment benefits from
a longer-term outlook and a commitment to
diversification, which is intended to limit the

overall damage of riskier invest
ments.
The Stanford Merged Pool,
which includes the University's
endowment and capital reserves
from Stanford's hospitals and clin
ics, grew to $20.4 billion as of Jun.
30. Over the last 10 years, the over
all portfolio has grown from $4.8
billion as returns have averaged 14.2
percent per year, according to the
University.
In February, based on the value
of the endowment, the Board of
Trustees agreed that the University
should aim to spend 5.5 percent of
the endowment for the year. The
budget for this year has already
been set so any cutbacks or belt
tightening would not take effect
until next school year, according to
Livingston.
"TTie reason payout will increase
less than inflation is that the invest
ment return, although excellent rel

alive to market indices, is less than
the combination of our target pay
out rate of 5.5 percent plus inflation
of about three percent to four per
cent," he said in an email.
Burgeoning university endow
ments have come under pressure
from some members of Congress,
who complain that schools are not
transparent enough about how
money is being invested and fret
that universities have not shared
enough of their expanding endow
ments with students struggling to
pay rising tuition. Partially in
response, schools like Stanford have
made financial aid programs more
generous.
Stanford officials have lobbied
against proposals that would
require a minimum amount of uni
versity endowments be spent each
year, a rule long applied to certain
nonprofits and charities. President
John Hennessy has said that, unlike
these foundations, universities
never plan to exhaust their endow
ments so they must prepare for mar
ket downturns and periods of
underperformance.
Livingston pointed to the 19705, a

period during which Stanford's
investment returns failed to exceed
the level of endowment payout plus
inflation, and, as a result, the value
of the University's endowment
declined.
On the heels of more than a
week of news that roiled markets,
the Stanford endowment results
were a bright spot. In Washington,
lawmakers held a hearing Tuesday
on a proposal spearheaded by
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson
and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke for what might amount to
a nearly $700 billion government
bailout of the country's financial
institutions.
Powers called it a strong and
appropriate plan.
"It's both necessary and proba
bly sufficient," he said. "It needs to
be both. I realize it's going to get
kicked around a bit and modified
before it's enacted."
