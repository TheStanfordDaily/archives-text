# Investments grow slightly
## Stanford Management Company gets 6.2 percent return in down market 
### JAMES HOHMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Anticipation of the credit crunch and
spike in oil prices positioned Stanford to
report a robust 6.2 percent return on the
investments in its endowment fund for last
year.
Tuesday's announcement — for the fiscal
year that ended June 30 — exceeded the
expectations of those who worried market
turmoil would lead to losses, but the per
formance still paled in comparison to the 23
percent growth posted for the prior year.
That could mean "some modest reduc
tions in spending" for the next academic
year, according to Stanford Chief Financial
Officer Randy Livingston '75 GSB '79. He
called the lower returns "terrific given the
challenging market conditions" but warned
that more might be spent from the endow
ment this year than is taken in. That could
mean a tighter budget for next year.
And the endowment fund's chief execu
tive. John Powers GSB '83, warned of a
"pretty slow recovery" ahead for the econo

my.
"Every day I think. 'That has to be the
ultimate event,' and I'm surprised by the
events of the next day," Powers said. "The
credit disruptions are so pervasive that
there will continue to be landmines for a
long time. I'm cautiously feeling that we're
approaching the end of the major spate of
negative news."
Accounting for money spent, the total size
of the official University endowment
remained at $17.2 billion on Aug. 31, nearly
the same size as a year earlier.
Powers has long warned that "if it seems
like a bubble, it probably is." and advised
last year that 20-plus-percent annual returns
were unsustainable. He called the 6.2 per
cent gain "hard-fought."
The University's returns were relatively
strong. Of the 20 largest college endowment
funds that have announced their results,
only two others — Harvard and Duke —
have announced gains greater than six per
cent. In the same period, the S&P's 500
Index was down 13.1 percent and the
Lehman Aggregate Bond Index, which

tracks the U.S. bond
market, was up 7.1
percent.
Around April
2007, Powers said
managers at
Stanford's endow
ment decided there
was something of a
bubble in the credit
markets and began
to ramp up invest
ments that would
become profitable

as loans and credit became harder to obtain.
Even with this foresight. Powers said, they
didn't anticipate the extent to which the col
lapse of the credit market would reverber
ate into other parts of the investment port
folio, creating fear in equity markets and
bringing down real estate prices.
"The unwind has been swifter and more
painful than we would have anticipated." he
said. "Credit lubricates the economy, and
there's very little available."
A bet on natural resources, the portfolio

bulked up on oil and gas beyond its long
term targets, helped Stanford outpace Yale,
which only reported a 4.5 percent gain.
Powers believes some parts of the market
have overcorrected. and he's moved some
money into investments he thinks will bene
fit from recovery. He didn't elaborate on
those, and he said he could not give specifics
about how the endowment has performed
since the end of the fiscal year in June.
"We don't know where the bottom is. so
we don't want to put all the money out at
once," he said. "But we think we've seen
[places] where there's fundamental value
not reflected in the current asset price. The
rebound will not be as quick as the unwind
ing was."
Still, he said, the endowment fund is not
rethinking its fundamental commitment to
investments in private equity, private real
estate and emerging markets. Unlike some
mutual funds, the endowment benefits from
a longer-term outlook and a commitment to
diversification, which is intended to limit the
