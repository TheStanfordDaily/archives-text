## GSB begins building new campus $350 million Knight Management Center to be built by 2011 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
Stanford Graduate School of Business
(GSB) broke ground early this month on the
Knight Management Center, its spacious future
campus. The 360,000-square-foot campus, locat
ed near Serra St.. will cost over $350 million
and will include eight new buildings around
three quadrangles. Included will be a 600-seat
lecture hall, to replace the soon-to-be-demol
ished Kresge Auditorium, and a parking struc
ture for 9(X) vehicles.
The Knight Management Center is named
after founder of NIKE. Inc. Phil Knight. GSB
'62. who donated an initial $ 1 (X) million towards
the campus and another $5 million towards fac
ulty support.
Currently, the GSB consists of one main
building located next to Memorial Auditorium,
where most of the courses are taught, along
with two buildings for faculty offices. All are
located apart from each other.
Plans for the new campus formally began in
2(K)5, when administrators at the GSB became
acutely aware that they were running out of
space. Rather than constructing a fourth dis
parate building, the GSB Advisory Council sug
gested to Dean Robert Joss that thev construct


MASARU OKA/The Stanford Daily
Construction on the Knight Management Center, which will be located on Serra Street across from the Schwab Residential Center, began
on Sept. 10. The 360,000-square-foot campus has received a Platinum LEED certification and will feature eight new buildings.
a new campus altogether.
The GSB received approval from
the Stanford Board of Trustees in
June 2006 and immediately began
reviewing potential campus designs
and taking suggestions from alumni,
students and faculty.
However, the new campus is not
solely for the GSB student body,
which consists of 750 MBA candi
dates. The campus is also designed
to promote a more modern multi
and cross-disciplinary teaching
approach across all seven of the
University's graduate schools.
"We are expanding the number
of classes that students from outside
the CiSB can take." said Kathleen
Cavanaugh, the center's program
director. "For example, over time,
law students might be able to take
courses at the GSB. and vice versa."
Such courses would be difficult
to teach in the current GSB build
ing. which consists mostly of tiered
classrooms designed for 60 to «S0
people. However, the new campus
buildings have a multitude of semi
nar-format classrooms to accommo
date class sizes of 15 to 40 students.
"We needed a new space where,
in the future, a business and medical
professor might jointly teach a
course," Cavanaugh said. "We are
looking at more cross disciplinary
courses and greater collaboration.
Last fall, the (JSB also reformed
its MBA program bv launching a
new curriculum that focuses more

on seminar classes, private team
work. personalization, global con
tent and leadership development.
" Hie selection of the architects
and the construction of the new cur
riculum occurred almost simultane
ously. so we were able to dovetail
the two. and factor the curriculum's
needs into construction plans,"
Cavanaugh said.

"We needed a new
space where, in the

medical professor might

program director

The campus designers also
placed an emphasis on sustainabili
ty. The new campus meets the
University's Guidelines for
Sustainable Buildings and achieved
Platinum Certification, the highest
rating level, in the U.S. Green
Building Council's LEED rating
certification system.
We decided early on to capital
ize on sustainability issues when
constructing the new campus."
Cavanaugh said. "This decision will
not cost us more than two to four
percent of the overall construction
cost."

The Knight Management
Center's photovoltaic roof installa
tions will generate 12.5 percent of
the energy used on the campus, and
the campus will use rainwater or re
circulate gray water to reduce
potable water use for sewage con
veyance by 80 percent.
President John Hennessy lauded
the GSB's commitment to environ
mental sustainability.
"In the long term, it is the cre
ation of economic incentives and
alignments between business and
society that will have the greatest
impact in addressing our environ
mental challenges," Hennessy said
in a GSB press release.
Stanford undergraduates will
also benefit from the new campus.
Many economics courses previously
taught at Kresge will probably move
into the new large auditorium.
"There is also a small amphithe
ater in the plans that undergradu
ates might find to be a great
rehearsal or performance space,"
Cavanaugh said.
In terms of funding, the GSB will
be paying for the new campus inde
pendently of the Provost's budget.
"Most of the funding has come
from our alumni donations, hut the
GSB may also take on some long
term debt if we cannot get the full
funding via donations," Cavanaugh
said. "The GSB has an endowment,
so taking on some long-term debt is
very feasible."
The Knight Management Center
is expected to be completed in 2010-
2011.
