## Senate must overcome divisions, work together 
### NIKHIL JOSHI DESK EDITOR 
ITie 10th ASSU Undergraduate Senate
certainly had an explosive beginning in the
spring — a controversy over committee
assignments degenerated into 36 roll call
votes in the body's first meeting under
Senate Chair Tiq Chapa '10 — but the
leaders of the senate are now looking to
move past partisanship and on to helping
students.
Avoiding conflict and concentrating on

the student body won't be easy. In the com
ing months, the Senate must overcome
divisions caused by disagreements between
senators endorsed by the Students of Color
Coalition (SOCC) and those who are not
a division that caused much controversy
following the spring elections. Senate lead
ers have said this year's senate must take
steps to increase its visibility amongst stu
dents by increasing transparency and out
reach. Closely coordinating with the execu
tive team, led by Jonny Dorsey '09 and
Fagan Harris '09. has also been identified

as a priority.
Chapa. who was SOCC-endorsed. told
The Daily that he hopes to move senators
away from partisanship that he sees as
unwarranted.
"This year, the Senate and the ASSU
will understand that we are all working
largely toward the same goals," he said.
Senator Luukas lives *09, who emerged
as the voice of the non-SOCC endorsed
senators and clashed with Chapa several
times during the spring meetings, is hopeful
that the Senate will avoid partisan squab

biing in favor of more relevant matters, but
isn't ready to jump past the divisions that
highlighted this Senate's first meetings.
"I think it's too early to come to any
conclusions." lives said when asked about
partisanship in the Senate. "As long as we
are talking about substantive matters, we
can focus on the technicalities of the issue.
When the Senate strays, that's when we get
bogged down with issues that don't affect
the student body.".
Last year's debate over the
appointment of Donald Rumsfeld
to the Hoover Institution is a prime
example of an unnecessarily
bogged-down senate, according to
lives.
Aside from dealing with grid
lock within the senate, this year's
senators face the daunting task of
clearly defining their goals and
showing the student bodv that thev

are making meaningful progress.
Chapa was not able to provide
The Daily with a detailed agenda
for the senate this year, instead
saying the senate will hammer out
policy goals at its retreat this week
end. But the senate chair did
emphasize that in addition to
working on its own variety of ini
tiatives, the senate hopes to use its
unique position to bring out the
best in Stanford's myriad student
organizations.
"We have the resources, the
quality people and the chance to
interact directly with the adminis
tration," Chapa said, "so we can

help a lot of people to do a lot of
things: to advocate and legislate,
and be a medium to connect peo
ple on campus."
lives added that he hopes to pri
oritize work on changing technical
details of the way the senate and
ASSU work, setting precedents
that will ensure the body's success
years down the line.
Setting a clear list of priorities is
particularly difficult for the senate,
which must deal with 15 different
personalities, all with their own pri
orities. Unlike the executives, who
draft detailed platforms during
campaign season, senators arrive in

office with just a few specialized
proposals.
Both Chapa and lives said that
working with the executive team
will be a top priority this year.
Syncing the two groups has histori
cally been difficult, as the agenda
setting process is different for the
executives than it is for the Senate,
and coordinating between two
groups with different aims can be
tough.
"We'd like to make sure that
every senator and executive cabi
net member who [is] working on
the same issues [has] the chance to
share strategies and interact,"

Chapa said.
Chapa hopes to use the commit
tee structure of the senate to
involve executive cabinet members
in initiatives that relate to their
expertise.
For the senate, the coming year
will be a difficult one. As senate
chair, Chapa is responsible for
keeping the body unified and on
task — no easy task for a group of
15 ambitious future politicians. But
Chapa appears to be ready for the
challenge, and he hopes to keep the
senate at a high energy level
throughout the year.
"I want to continue to make

sure that the enthusiasm that peo
ple showed during elections, they
continue through their terms,"
Chapa said. "We have a strong
group. We will just make sure that
the work that they are doing aligns
with their passions so they can
bring energy to the things that they
are doing."
The 10th Undergraduate Senate will
resume meetings next Tuesday. The
Daily publishes a weekly report on
Wednesdays detailing each meeting.
