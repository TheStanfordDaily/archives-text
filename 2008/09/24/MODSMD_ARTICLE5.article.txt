## Senate must overcome divisions, work together 
### NIKHIL JOSHI DESK EDITOR 
ITie 10th ASSU Undergraduate Senate
certainly had an explosive beginning in the
spring — a controversy over committee
assignments degenerated into 36 roll call
votes in the body's first meeting under
Senate Chair Tiq Chapa '10 — but the
leaders of the senate are now looking to
move past partisanship and on to helping
students.
Avoiding conflict and concentrating on

the student body won't be easy. In the com
ing months, the Senate must overcome
divisions caused by disagreements between
senators endorsed by the Students of Color
Coalition (SOCC) and those who are not
a division that caused much controversy
following the spring elections. Senate lead
ers have said this year's senate must take
steps to increase its visibility amongst stu
dents by increasing transparency and out
reach. Closely coordinating with the execu
tive team, led by Jonny Dorsey '09 and
Fagan Harris '09. has also been identified

as a priority.
Chapa. who was SOCC-endorsed. told
The Daily that he hopes to move senators
away from partisanship that he sees as
unwarranted.
"This year, the Senate and the ASSU
will understand that we are all working
largely toward the same goals," he said.
Senator Luukas lives *09, who emerged
as the voice of the non-SOCC endorsed
senators and clashed with Chapa several
times during the spring meetings, is hopeful
that the Senate will avoid partisan squab

biing in favor of more relevant matters, but
isn't ready to jump past the divisions that
highlighted this Senate's first meetings.
"I think it's too early to come to any
conclusions." lives said when asked about
partisanship in the Senate. "As long as we
are talking about substantive matters, we
can focus on the technicalities of the issue.
When the Senate strays, that's when we get
bogged down with issues that don't affect
the student body.".
