Palin meets her first world leaders
Sarah Palin met her first world leaders Tuesday.
It was a tightly controlled crash course on foreign
policy for the Republican vice presidential candidate,
the mayor-turned-governor who has been outside North
America just once.
Palin sat down with Afghan President Hamid Karzai
and Colombian President Alvaro Uribe. The conversa
tions were private, the pictures public, meant to build her
resume for voters concerned about her lack of experi
ence in world affairs.
"I found her quite a capable woman," Karzai said
later. "She asked the right questions on Afghanistan."
The self-described "hockey mom" also asked former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger for insights on Geor
gia. Russia, China and Iran, and she'll see more leaders
Wednesday on the sidelines of the United Nations Gen
eral Assembly meetings.
Democrats to let offshore drilling ban expire
Democrats have decided to allow a quarter-century
ban on drilling for oil off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts
to expire next week, conceding defeat in a months-long
battle with the White House and Republicans set off by
$4 a gallon gasoline prices this summer.
House Appropriations Committee Chairman David
Obey. D-Wis., told reporters Tuesday that a provision
continuing the moratorium will be dropped this year
from a stopgap spending bill to keep the government
running after Congress recesses for the election.
Republicans have made lifting the ban a key cam
paign issue after oil prices spiked this summer and pub
lic opinion turned in favor of more drilling. President
Bush lifted an executive ban on offshore drilling in July.
"If true, this capitulation by Democrats following
months of Republican pressure is a big victory for
Americans struggling with record gasoline prices," said
House GOP leader John Boehner of Ohio.
Democrats had clung to the hope of only a partial re
peal of the drilling moratorium, but the White House
had promised a veto. Obey said.
