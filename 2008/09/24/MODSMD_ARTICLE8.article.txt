# Economic officials push for emergency financial plan
## Bush, Congress battle over bailout 
### JEANNINE AVERSA THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Refusing to be pushed. Republicans
and Democrats alike rebuffed dire warn
ings Tuesday from the government's top
economic officials of recession, layoffs
and foreclosed homes if Congress doesn't
quickly approve the administration's
emergency $700 billion financial bailout
plan.
Congressional leaders still predicted
passage — with significant changes —
but Wall Street's nerves were hardly
soothed. The Dow Jones industrials sank
161 points and now are off more than 500
this week after initially surging on the
bailout announcement last week.
Deepening market trouble was just
one piece of the economic havoc that Fed
eral Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson
told senators would ensue if Congress lags
in acting on the administration's proposal
to rescue tottering financial institutions.
"1 share the outrage that people have,"
Paulson said. "It's embarrassing to look at
this. I think it's embarrassing to the Unit
ed States of America. There is a lot of
blame to go around."
But without the bailout plan, Paulson
and Bernanke sketched out a dire sce
nario for senators at a contentious day
long hearing: Neither businesses nor con
sumers would be able to borrow money,
and the world's largest economy would
grind to a virtual halt.
In public and in private meetings, both
Democrats and Republicans said big
changes are needed, presaging a difficult
road ahead for the measure.
The legislation the administration is
promoting would allow the government
to buy bad mortgages and other rotten as
sets held by troubled banks and financial
institutions. Getting those debts off their
books should bolster those companies'
balance sheets, making them more in
clined to lend and easing one of the

biggest chokc points in the credit crisis. If
the plan works, it should help lift a major
weight off the national economy that is al
ready sputtering.
One Wall Street firm got a boost Tues
day with word that Warren Buffett's
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is investing at
least $5 billion in Goldman Sachs. It was a
huge vote of confidence for one of the sur
vivors of the credit crisis that felled two of
its investment banking peers.
The news sent shares of Goldman
Sachs and stock index futures soaring in
electronic trading, after the Dow Jones
suffered declines.
Democrats were determined to wrest
concessions from the administration on
domestic spending and middle-class eco
nomic aid. And they said Republicans had
to share in the politically tricky task of

pushing through a financial bailout six
weeks before the elections at a time when
millions of everyday Americans are eco
nomically strapped.
"It's their problem. It's their bill. And
they're going to have to figure out if they
can support it," House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi, D-Calif.,said of Republicans.
"Nobody wants to have to do this,"
agreed Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, the
Republican leader. He said he was hope
ful of a quick agreement, despite wither
ing criticism from conservative GOP law
makers who recoiled at the prospect of
federal intervention.
Sen. Jim Bunning. R-Ky., said. "This
massive bailout is not a solution. It is fi
nancial socialism and it's un-American."
Separately, law enforcement officials
said the FBI had begun investigating four

institutions whose collapse helped trigger
the financial crisis.
The FBI is looking at potential fraud
by mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Fred
die Mac, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
and insurer American International
Group Inc., said two officials, speaking on
condition of anonymity because of the
sensitivity of the investigations. The in
quiries, still in preliminary stages, will
focus on the financial institutions and the
people who ran them, one senior law en
forcement official said.
As for the bailout plan, both parties'
presidential candidates joined fellow sen
ators in insisting on alterations in the ad
ministration s drastic prescription.
Democrats and Republicans alike de
manded that the bailout limit pay pack
ages for executives of companies helped
by the rescue.
Democrats also were pushing propos
als to let the government take some type
of stake in the companies that it helps. I"he
administration has balked at that, fearing
it would discourage financial companies
from getting the help they need through
the bailout, thereby blunting the plan's ef
fectiveness.
Democrats also want to let judges
rewrite mortgages to lower bankrupt
homeowners' monthly payments, another
demand the administration is resisting.
Both Sens. Chris Dodd, D-Conn..
chairman of the Banking Committee, and
the panel's top-ranking Republican,
Richard Shelby of Alabama, said signifi
cant changes are needed before the res
cue plan can be passed. "We have got to
look at some alternatives," Shelby said.
Getting the action right is key. Dodd
said: "There is no second act to this." He
later spoke disparagingly of the adminis
tration's proposal. "What they have sent
us is not acceptable," he told reporters.
