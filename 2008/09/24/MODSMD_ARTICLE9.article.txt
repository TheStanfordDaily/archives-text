## Hennessy home goes solar 252 solar panels to power Hoover House 
### DAN HIRSCH 
The Hoover House, home of
University President John
Hennessy, was outfitted with 252
solar panels earlier this month, mak
ing it the single largest photovoltaic
energy system on campus.
ITie monocrystalline solar panels
that now power the president's
house are expected to reduce car
bon dioxide emissions by roughly
14.5 metric tons a year and produce
approximately 64,000 kilowatt
hours a year. According to Stanford
Energy Engineer and Project
Manager Scott Gould, the energy
produced by the system is enough to
power about nine regular-sized
homes in Palo Alto for a year.
The decision to pursue the instal
lation of the system was both envi
ronmental and economic, according
to Jeff Wachtel, senior assistant to
the President. After receiving an
$84,000 rebate from the California
Solar Initiative, the University paid
an additional $278,000 for the instal
lation. The excess energy produced
by the panels will be sold back to
Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E),
which will continue to provide sup
plemental power to the house. With
these bonuses, the system will work
to pay back its original costs.
Joe Stagner, executive director of

sustainahility and energy, said that
— relative to other renewable ener
gy sourees — photovoltaic power is
not necessarily the cheapest option,
though the cost is coming down.
However, given the large energy
expenditures of the Hoover House
and the high rates paid to PG&E,
solar power should prove to be very
cost effective.
The Hoover House serves not
only as a residence for the President,
bet also functions as a location for
many University events and celebra
tions. Regarding the symbolic signif
icance of the Hoover House solar
panels, Wachtel said the President's
aims were mostly practical.
But Wachtel also noted that
Hennessy would be pleased if the
move set an example for the entire
campus.
"If this motivates others to take
action to make their homes more
energy-efficient, that would be
great," Wachtel said.
Sparked by interest from the
president, engineers began assessing
the possible installation about a year
ago. When the estimates returned
with reasonable costs and rates, the
project went ahead.
"Once the numbers came in. it
was a go," Gould said.
Due to the nature of the build
ing's roofs and its status as a regis
tered historic site — originally built
by President Herbert Hoover, an
1895 graduate of the University and
Lou Henry Hoover, an 1898 gradu
ate, in 1920 — the panels could not

be installed on the house itself.
Instead, they are located on the
adjacent San Juan Reservoir, which
receives ample sunlight for many
hours of the day.
"The fact that the house is a his
toric site really makes attaching
things like photovoltaic modules
really difficult," Gould said. "It's not
a traditional house. Most people
would just slap them on the roof, but
they don't have a roof."
Gould hopes the house will also
begin a campaign to reduce energy
use.
"It's not just about adding pro
duction capability, but also about
reducing the amount of consump
tion in the house." he said. "The sys
tem isn't designed for a KM) percent
load."
The President's home has also
recently undergone a full energy
audit and now features more effi
cient appliances.
"It is a personal interest of the
president to reduce energy con
sumption." Wachtel said. "He tries to
drive his car as little as possible, and
does what he can around the house."
ITie Hoover House efforts, now
the largest solar initiative on cam
pus, will be eclipsed soon enough.
Hie Knight Management Center,
slated to open in 2010 or 2011. will
include enough photovoltaic power
to generate 12.5 percent of the ener
gy used on campus.
