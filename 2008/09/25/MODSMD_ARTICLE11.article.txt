## Letter to the Class of 2012 
### 
Dear Class of 2012,
I'd like to extend a warm welcome to you
from everyone here at Stu's Views. Your
first week of classes is almost over, and
you've been through the glorified summer
camp for 12-year-olds that we all know as
"New Student Orientation." You might even
have your first big frat party this weekend.
For many of you, it will be your last.
While your numerous oversubscribed
souls crowd our hallways and bike lanes, I
will not indulge in the freshman bashing that
is common to many upperclassmen, especial
ly sophomores.
This week, I've decided to use my column
to share some of the collected knowledge —
or lies.dependingon where you stand — that
I've observed about life at Stanford.
Your academic advisors, peer mentors, ac
ademic directors and assorted other academ
ic personnel will tell you to explore your in
terests and take a wide range of classes. They
are right, but one key distinction needs to be
made. As a two-time peer mentor, I've
watched many freshmen fill their schedules
with Psych l.Econ lAandPoliSci I.These in
troductory classes tend — though this is not
always the case — to be demoralizing and
alienating. There's no reason to take them
unless they are required for your major.
Instead, if possible, freshmen should try
taking 100-level classes, which offer a far bet
ter indicator of life in that major. While I can
not speak for the sciences, the vast majority
of 100-level classes in the humanities and so
cial sciences are taught at a level that many
freshmen can handle. Introductory seminars
are also a good way to get around the large
introductory lecture classes.

The two best classes I've found at Stan
ford— Polisci 114 D: Democracy. Develop
ment and the Rule of Law, and History 198:
Modern Chinese History — are open to
freshmen. I suggest everyone enroll in those
two classes immediately. If you do, you might
turn out like me, a senior using his precious
column space to give advice to freshmen in
stead of opining on his favorite topic. Gover
nor Sarah Palin.That would be something.
If you think you've got a handle on your
academics for the quarter, what about the so
cial scene? What amazes me most about
Stanford is the diversity of people's residen
tial and social experiences. Being in an all
lreshmen dorm or a four-class dorm — the
former is preferable, in my view — really
does make a difference in one's social expe
rience. Having 80 freshmen in your dorm or
35 significantly impacts your opportunities to
make friends with other freshmen. Some
times dorms have great chemistry, and some
times it's a chemical explosion. Either way,
you should hedge your bets and make at least
a few friends outside your dorm.
While Stanford is set up in a way to maxi
mize "dorm isolationism" due to the strong
role of RAs and the constant "dorm bond
ing," I think it is important to make friends
outside of one's dorm. All freshmen will ex
perience a massive dislocation when every

one they know is spewed around campus for
sophomore year.and it's good to have friends
in many places if, say, you get placed in Lagu
nita and all your friends are in Toyon.
The "dorm isolationism" also places pres
sure on students to associate themselves with
their dormmates in massive collectives. Peo
ple who move in packs of more than five im
mediately distinguish themselves as fresh
men. While large group activities are enjoy
able, do not underestimate the appeal of
breaking off into small groups early in au
tumn quarter and getting to know your col
leagues a little better.
Finally, do not think you are above Stan
ford's cheesy traditions. Full Moon on the
Quad may be a thoroughly awkward affair,
and our football team may be terrible, but
there is value in just being there, if only for
the spectacle. Vou don't have to kiss anyone
and you don't even have to cheer, but these
are some of the (very few) Stanford-wide
events you will have as a student. The best
event of freshman year is one that students
rarely think of or appreciate: the Cantor
Art Center's "First Thursday," which takes
place a week from today. It shouldn't be
missed.
Stanford is an expansive and impressive
place, and you will only be able to take a
small bite of it as a freshman. But it is a bite
worth taking, and most likely a scrumptious
one.
With love and affection,
Stuart
