## Researchers find way to treat Leukemia 
### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Researchers at the School of
Medicine have discovered a new
method to treat a lethal form of
leukemia based on a molecular sig
nal that regulates cell growth.
In the past, the molecular signal
"glycogen synthase kinase 3" (CiSK
3) had been shown to limit certain
types of cellular growth, which
could prevent a variety of manifes
tations of cancer. However,
research by Dr. Michael Cleary and
his team found that GK3 also
affects white blood cells, and actu
ally encourages a type of white
blood cell cancer.
Most leukemia cases begin with
bad cells in the lymph nodes or the
bone marrow, which are the pro
duction sites of white blood cells.
Such cancers account for five to 10

percent of leukemia cases.
Cleary's findings indicate GSK3
may be an effective target for
future leukemia drugs, and the
team is starting to search for high
potency GSK3 inhibitors that can
safely be given to humans. Since
GSK3 normally slows the growth of
healthy bone marrow stem cells, it
is possible that giving GSK3
inhibitors can have the benefit of
killing both the cancerous white
blood cells and promoting growth
of healthy stem cells, such as those
given in a bone marrow transplant.
