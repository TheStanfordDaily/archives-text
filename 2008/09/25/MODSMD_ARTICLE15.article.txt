## Stanford doctor takes skills on the road 
### JACOB JOHNSON DESK EDITOR 
At the end of Dr. Daniel Garza's
Sports Medicine class on Friday, he
and his two teaching assistants, Brice
Rolston and Tyler Johnston, will not
be headed back to the office; in
stead, they will board a plane to New
Orleans with the San Francisco
49er&
Garza, a Stanford undergraduate
*91 and medical school '(X) alumnus,
is a fabulous teacher and an enter
taining lecturer in Human Physiolo
gy, as well as an assistant professor in
surgery and orthopedic surgery. But
more importantly, for sports fans
that is, he also serves as the medical
director for the 49ers — one of the
NFL's most storied franchises.
Garza began working with the
team in 2006 when 49ers co-owner
Dr. John York decided to transfer
the team's medical care to Stanford
Hospital. Dr. William Maloney,chair
of the Department of Orthopedic
Surgery at Stanford, helped develop
a relationship with 49ers manage
ment, and soon afterward Stanford
became the primary provider for all
of the team's medical care. It was the
first such partnership between an
NFL organization and a major re
search university.
"I happened into it almost by
chance," Garza said of his position
with the 49ers. "Dr. York wanted to
find a non-surgeon [from Stanford]
to work with the team, and 1 was
available."
After working with Stanford stu
dent-athletes. Garza was initially re
luctant to expand beyond the Farm.
"Stanford students are great —
they're smart, helpful and funny," he
said. "I wasn't sure what to expect
from an NFL population."

But what he found was a group of hard
working men — professionals in every sense
of the word.
"The level of professionalism within the
organization was impressive," Garza said.
Although he enjoyed his role as medical
provider to the team. Garza immediately
began thinking of ways to maximize the op
portunity to better serve some of the world's
most elite athletes.
"There are many benefits of the relation
ship with [the 49ers|," Garza said, speaking
from his office at the Sports Medicine Center
in the Arrillaga Family Sports and Recreation
Center. "It allows us to work with a unique

population. It also gives the University and
hospital great exposure."
Recognizing the opportunity to do
groundbreaking work in the field of sports
medicine with the NFL,Garza turned to Stan
ford students to help develop and carry out
new research projects.
There are currently two research assistants
(RAs) working with him and the 49ers. John
ston graduated from Stanford in 2006 with a
bachelor's degree in human biology and
stayed on the Farm to get his MS in mechani
cal engineering in "08, and he will enter Stan
ford's School of Medicine next fall. As a mas
ter's student. Johnston even designed a cus
tom pad for a 49ers player after an injury in

terrupted his season.
Rolston. a 2007 Stanford grad who also
majored in human biology, has been working
with Garza for three years. Last year he was a
full-time RA in the Sports Medicine Center,
and he began doing research with the 49crs
last fall. Rolston was also a four-year member
of the Stanford men's gymnastics team and a
four-time Academic Ail-American.
Johnston and Rolston have been working
on two main research projects with the team.
The first aims to study heat dissipation in elite
athletes via infrared (IR) thermography.

lab in collaboration with the Stan
ford football team, Garza and his as
sistants have been using IR cameras
to measure how professional foot
ball players release heat after in
tense physical activity.
"Heat-related illnesses result in
lost practice time and can even led
to more serious complications," Rol
ston said. "This is why we believe
that tracking and characterizing
heat dissipation and illness is very
important."
The death of Vikings offensive
tackle Korey Stringer in August of
2001 highlights the importance of
this research. Stringer weighed
about 335 pounds — a hefty, but not
unusual, size for an NFL lineman.
On the first day of training camp, he
had trouble keeping his body tem
perature down. Determined to get
back to work with his teammates, he
suited up for practice the next day,
where he collapsed. When Stringer
reached the hospital, his tempera
ture was an astounding 108 degrees
— the budding star at left tackle
died less than 24 hours later.
A number of other heat-related
illnesses have occurred among NFL
and collegiate players over the
years, including the hospitalization
of Philadelphia Eagles defensive
end Chris Clemons this summer.The
tragic losses and dangerous hospi
talizations highlight the importance
of the preventative power of sports
medicine.
"The most important thing is a
human life," said Jeff Ferguson, the
49ers" head athletic trainer. Current
ly in his third vear with the team.

Ferguson joined the San Francisco
franchise after spending almost a
decade as the director of sports
medicine at Kansas State.
"The players are very savvy," he
said. "They are able to read pretty
quickly if you're in it as a fan or if
you're trustworthy."
According to Ferguson, Garza
and his researchers have gained a
high level of trust by acting profes
sionally and making an effort to "get
to know the players." Stanford's rep
utation as an elite academic institu
tion has helped as well.
"The Stanford name gains a level
of trust [from the players] right
away," Ferguson added.
Garza further stressed the impor
tance of trust in the locker room. In
the NFL, players are often sur
rounded by people trying to get
something from them — monetary
benefits or increases in social status,
for example — so it is of the utmost
importance for outsiders to quickly
establish their credibility.
"The lack of secondary gain on
the RAs' part gives them credit and
trust with the players — and [Rol
ston and Johnston] are good at what
they do," he said.
Rolston has been working on the
IR thermography project for the
past two seasons, and the research
team has presented the results at
conferences in Las Vegas and
Hawaii.They will also be presenting
at an upcoming academic meeting in
Chicago.
Rolston takes measurements
during practices and games, roaming
the sidelines with an IR camera that
looks like a flashlight with a rain
bow-tinted lens. The device is accu
rate from a considerable distance, so
he can give the players their person
al space and still get accurate data.
NFL players spend a lot of time
in the spotlight, and they don't want
another camera shoved in their
faces — especially when they are
trying to catch a breather in the mid
dle of a game.

"Portability and a low profile are
key for collecting game-time data,"
Rolston said just before kickoff of
the 49ers' 31-13 victory over the De
troit Lions last Sunday. "We wanted
something that was small and didn't
look like a camera, so the new [IR
camera] is awesome."
The other main project underway
involves impact sensors and is still in
the developmental stage. Garza and
his RAs are using technology devel
oped by Zephyr, a New Zealand
based company, to design an "impact
vest" that will measure the force of
impacts to the body during games.
The sensors are thin, soft pads
that are placed over important parts
of the torso, including the kidneys
and liver.To keep them in place, they
are sewn into pockets in the players'
compression garments. A wireless
transmitter is clipped into the shoul
der pads and instantly relays data to
a computer on the sidelines.
"The system provides immediate
feedback on the severity of impacts
and the potential for injuries," John
ston said. "There is a need for this
technology because MRIs and other
imaging modalities are hard to do
quickly and can't be done on the
field."
The impact sensors and IR cam
era can also help protect players
from themselves. The NFL is a
"tough guy" league, and rarely will a
player take himself out of action —
even when he is in pain. Therefore,
technologies that provide doctors
and trainers with accurate, quantita
tive information about a player's
health can be very useful.
A recent incident involving
Green Bay Packers defensive back
A 1 Harris highlights the need for ob
jective technologies. This past Sun
day, Harris collided with teammate
A.J. Hawk in the first quarter. He
came out of the game on the next
play and told team trainers that he
felt pain in his stomach, but he re
fused to stay on the sidelines.
It wasn't until he later discovered

blood in his urine and went to the
hospital that doctors discovered that
his spleen had ruptured. Surgery will
likely be necessary, and Harris
should make a full recovery — but
one more hit could have resulted in
massive internal bleeding and a seri
ous threat to his life.
Right now, the "impact vest" is
merely a prototype. It only gives ap
proximate forces, and Johnston and
Rolston are working on ways to bet
ter process their data in order to give
real-time force measurements.
"This is clinical, real life-oriented
research," Johnston said. "Eventual
ly, [the 'impact vest'] will be able to
monitor more physiological param
eters such as heart and breathing
rates, contributing to an overall un
derstanding of the stresses encoun
tered during intense exertion."
Both Johnston and Rolston can
barely contain their excitement
when talking about their work. Not
only are they doing original re
search. but they have worked with
everyone from NFL players and
equipment staff to medical person
nel and team owners. It is an oppor
tunity of a lifetime, one that is only
possible at a place like Stanford. But
it is an opportunity they have earned
through skill and hard work.
"I'm happy to provide this op
portunity to Brice and Tyler," Fergu
son said. "They are contributing to
sport science knowledge and are
providing a direct service to the
team ... Their research will one day
allow medical professionals at all
levels to make better informed deci
sions."
Students interested in learning
about sports injuries from the med
ical director of an NFL team should
take Garza's Humßio 139: Sports
Medicine. Lectures are Wednesday
and Friday. 11 a.m. to 12:15 p m.
There are frequent guest lecturers,
all experts in their fields.

"This is clinical, real life-oriented
research," Johnston said. "Eventual
ly, [the 'impact vest'] will be able to
monitor more physiological param
eters such as heart and breathing
rates, contributing to an overall un
derstanding of the stresses encoun
tered during intense exertion."
Both Johnston and Rolston can
barely contain their excitement
when talking about their work. Not
only are they doing original re
search. but they have worked with
everyone from NFL players and
equipment staff to medical person
nel and team owners. It is an oppor
tunity of a lifetime, one that is only
possible at a place like Stanford. But
it is an opportunity they have earned
through skill and hard work.
"I'm happy to provide this op
portunity to Brice and Tyler," Fergu
son said. "They are contributing to
sport science knowledge and are
providing a direct service to the
team ... Their research will one day
allow medical professionals at all
levels to make better informed deci
sions."

Garza, a Stanford undergraduate
*91 and medical school '(X) alumnus,
is a fabulous teacher and an enter
taining lecturer in Human Physiolo
gy, as well as an assistant professor in
surgery and orthopedic surgery. But
more importantly, for sports fans
that is, he also serves as the medical
director for the 49ers — one of the
NFL's most storied franchises.
Garza began working with the
team in 2006 when 49ers co-owner
Dr. John York decided to transfer
the team's medical care to Stanford
Hospital. Dr. William Maloney,chair
of the Department of Orthopedic
Surgery at Stanford, helped develop
a relationship with 49ers manage
ment, and soon afterward Stanford
became the primary provider for all
of the team's medical care. It was the
first such partnership between an
NFL organization and a major re
search university.
"I happened into it almost by
chance," Garza said of his position
with the 49ers. "Dr. York wanted to
find a non-surgeon [from Stanford]
to work with the team, and 1 was
available."
After working with Stanford stu
dent-athletes. Garza was initially re
luctant to expand beyond the Farm.
"Stanford students are great —
they're smart, helpful and funny," he
said. "I wasn't sure what to expect
from an NFL population."

But what he found was a group of hard
working men — professionals in every sense
of the word.
"The level of professionalism within the
organization was impressive," Garza said.
Although he enjoyed his role as medical
provider to the team. Garza immediately
began thinking of ways to maximize the op
portunity to better serve some of the world's
most elite athletes.
"There are many benefits of the relation
ship with [the 49ers|," Garza said, speaking
from his office at the Sports Medicine Center
in the Arrillaga Family Sports and Recreation
Center. "It allows us to work with a unique

population. It also gives the University and
hospital great exposure."
Recognizing the opportunity to do
groundbreaking work in the field of sports
medicine with the NFL,Garza turned to Stan
ford students to help develop and carry out
new research projects.
There are currently two research assistants
(RAs) working with him and the 49ers. John
ston graduated from Stanford in 2006 with a
bachelor's degree in human biology and
stayed on the Farm to get his MS in mechani
cal engineering in "08, and he will enter Stan
ford's School of Medicine next fall. As a mas
ter's student. Johnston even designed a cus
tom pad for a 49ers player after an injury in

terrupted his season.
Rolston. a 2007 Stanford grad who also
majored in human biology, has been working
with Garza for three years. Last year he was a
full-time RA in the Sports Medicine Center,
and he began doing research with the 49crs
last fall. Rolston was also a four-year member
of the Stanford men's gymnastics team and a
four-time Academic Ail-American.
Johnston and Rolston have been working
on two main research projects with the team.
The first aims to study heat dissipation in elite
athletes via infrared (IR) thermography.

lab in collaboration with the Stan
ford football team, Garza and his as
sistants have been using IR cameras
to measure how professional foot
ball players release heat after in
tense physical activity.
"Heat-related illnesses result in
lost practice time and can even led
to more serious complications," Rol
ston said. "This is why we believe
that tracking and characterizing
heat dissipation and illness is very
important."
The death of Vikings offensive
tackle Korey Stringer in August of
2001 highlights the importance of
this research. Stringer weighed
about 335 pounds — a hefty, but not
unusual, size for an NFL lineman.
On the first day of training camp, he
had trouble keeping his body tem
perature down. Determined to get
back to work with his teammates, he
suited up for practice the next day,
where he collapsed. When Stringer
reached the hospital, his tempera
ture was an astounding 108 degrees
— the budding star at left tackle
died less than 24 hours later.
A number of other heat-related
illnesses have occurred among NFL
and collegiate players over the
years, including the hospitalization
of Philadelphia Eagles defensive
end Chris Clemons this summer.The
tragic losses and dangerous hospi
talizations highlight the importance
of the preventative power of sports
medicine.
"The most important thing is a
human life," said Jeff Ferguson, the
49ers" head athletic trainer. Current
ly in his third vear with the team.

Ferguson joined the San Francisco
franchise after spending almost a
decade as the director of sports
medicine at Kansas State.
"The players are very savvy," he
said. "They are able to read pretty
quickly if you're in it as a fan or if
you're trustworthy."
According to Ferguson, Garza
and his researchers have gained a
high level of trust by acting profes
sionally and making an effort to "get
to know the players." Stanford's rep
utation as an elite academic institu
tion has helped as well.
"The Stanford name gains a level
of trust [from the players] right
away," Ferguson added.
Garza further stressed the impor
tance of trust in the locker room. In
the NFL, players are often sur
rounded by people trying to get
something from them — monetary
benefits or increases in social status,
for example — so it is of the utmost
importance for outsiders to quickly
establish their credibility.
"The lack of secondary gain on
the RAs' part gives them credit and
trust with the players — and [Rol
ston and Johnston] are good at what
they do," he said.
Rolston has been working on the
IR thermography project for the
past two seasons, and the research
team has presented the results at
conferences in Las Vegas and
Hawaii.They will also be presenting
at an upcoming academic meeting in
Chicago.
Rolston takes measurements
during practices and games, roaming
the sidelines with an IR camera that
looks like a flashlight with a rain
bow-tinted lens. The device is accu
rate from a considerable distance, so
he can give the players their person
al space and still get accurate data.
NFL players spend a lot of time
in the spotlight, and they don't want
another camera shoved in their
faces — especially when they are
trying to catch a breather in the mid
dle of a game.

"Portability and a low profile are
key for collecting game-time data,"
Rolston said just before kickoff of
the 49ers' 31-13 victory over the De
troit Lions last Sunday. "We wanted
something that was small and didn't
look like a camera, so the new [IR
camera] is awesome."
The other main project underway
involves impact sensors and is still in
the developmental stage. Garza and
his RAs are using technology devel
oped by Zephyr, a New Zealand
based company, to design an "impact
vest" that will measure the force of
impacts to the body during games.
The sensors are thin, soft pads
that are placed over important parts
of the torso, including the kidneys
and liver.To keep them in place, they
are sewn into pockets in the players'
compression garments. A wireless
transmitter is clipped into the shoul
der pads and instantly relays data to
a computer on the sidelines.
"The system provides immediate
feedback on the severity of impacts
and the potential for injuries," John
ston said. "There is a need for this
technology because MRIs and other
imaging modalities are hard to do
quickly and can't be done on the
field."
The impact sensors and IR cam
era can also help protect players
from themselves. The NFL is a
"tough guy" league, and rarely will a
player take himself out of action —
even when he is in pain. Therefore,
technologies that provide doctors
and trainers with accurate, quantita
tive information about a player's
health can be very useful.
A recent incident involving
Green Bay Packers defensive back
A 1 Harris highlights the need for ob
jective technologies. This past Sun
day, Harris collided with teammate
A.J. Hawk in the first quarter. He
came out of the game on the next
play and told team trainers that he
felt pain in his stomach, but he re
fused to stay on the sidelines.
It wasn't until he later discovered

blood in his urine and went to the
hospital that doctors discovered that
his spleen had ruptured. Surgery will
likely be necessary, and Harris
should make a full recovery — but
one more hit could have resulted in
massive internal bleeding and a seri
ous threat to his life.
Right now, the "impact vest" is
merely a prototype. It only gives ap
proximate forces, and Johnston and
Rolston are working on ways to bet
ter process their data in order to give
real-time force measurements.
"This is clinical, real life-oriented
research," Johnston said. "Eventual
ly, [the 'impact vest'] will be able to
monitor more physiological param
eters such as heart and breathing
