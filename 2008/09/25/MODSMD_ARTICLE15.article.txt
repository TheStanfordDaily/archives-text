## Stanford doctor takes skills on the road 
### JACOB JOHNSON DESK EDITOR 
At the end of Dr. Daniel Garza's
Sports Medicine class on Friday, he
and his two teaching assistants, Brice
Rolston and Tyler Johnston, will not
be headed back to the office; in
stead, they will board a plane to New
Orleans with the San Francisco
49er&
Garza, a Stanford undergraduate
*91 and medical school '(X) alumnus,
is a fabulous teacher and an enter
taining lecturer in Human Physiolo
gy, as well as an assistant professor in
surgery and orthopedic surgery. But
more importantly, for sports fans
that is, he also serves as the medical
director for the 49ers — one of the
NFL's most storied franchises.
Garza began working with the
team in 2006 when 49ers co-owner
Dr. John York decided to transfer
the team's medical care to Stanford
Hospital. Dr. William Maloney,chair
of the Department of Orthopedic
Surgery at Stanford, helped develop
a relationship with 49ers manage
ment, and soon afterward Stanford
became the primary provider for all
of the team's medical care. It was the
first such partnership between an
NFL organization and a major re
search university.
"I happened into it almost by
chance," Garza said of his position
with the 49ers. "Dr. York wanted to
find a non-surgeon [from Stanford]
to work with the team, and 1 was
available."
After working with Stanford stu
dent-athletes. Garza was initially re
luctant to expand beyond the Farm.
"Stanford students are great —
they're smart, helpful and funny," he
said. "I wasn't sure what to expect
from an NFL population."

But what he found was a group of hard
working men — professionals in every sense
of the word.
"The level of professionalism within the
organization was impressive," Garza said.
Although he enjoyed his role as medical
provider to the team. Garza immediately
began thinking of ways to maximize the op
portunity to better serve some of the world's
most elite athletes.
"There are many benefits of the relation
ship with [the 49ers|," Garza said, speaking
from his office at the Sports Medicine Center
in the Arrillaga Family Sports and Recreation
Center. "It allows us to work with a unique

population. It also gives the University and
hospital great exposure."
Recognizing the opportunity to do
groundbreaking work in the field of sports
medicine with the NFL,Garza turned to Stan
ford students to help develop and carry out
new research projects.
There are currently two research assistants
(RAs) working with him and the 49ers. John
ston graduated from Stanford in 2006 with a
bachelor's degree in human biology and
stayed on the Farm to get his MS in mechani
cal engineering in "08, and he will enter Stan
ford's School of Medicine next fall. As a mas
ter's student. Johnston even designed a cus
tom pad for a 49ers player after an injury in

terrupted his season.
Rolston. a 2007 Stanford grad who also
majored in human biology, has been working
with Garza for three years. Last year he was a
full-time RA in the Sports Medicine Center,
and he began doing research with the 49crs
last fall. Rolston was also a four-year member
of the Stanford men's gymnastics team and a
four-time Academic Ail-American.
Johnston and Rolston have been working
on two main research projects with the team.
The first aims to study heat dissipation in elite
athletes via infrared (IR) thermography.
Based on previous work done by the Heller

"I wasn't sure what
to expect from an
NFL population."
