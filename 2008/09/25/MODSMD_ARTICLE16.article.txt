# Women look to remain unbeaten
## No. 6 Stanford carries 8-0-1 record into weekend 
### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
After playing three tournaments over the
past three weekends, the Stanford women's
soccer team now finds itself at an awkward
point in its schedule. All of the early season
tournaments are now finished, yet the start of
the Pac-10 conference schedule is still a few
weeks away.
That leaves the team with a couple of one

match weekends against non-conference op
ponents; the women play St. Mary's College at
home this Friday and then take on Santa Clara
next weekend.
With the season already a month old, one
could forgive the Stanford women if they were
already looking ahead to the excitement of
Pac-1() play. The Cardinal is maintaining its
focus, however, and is determined not to let up
in the next few weeks. In fact, head coach Paul
Ratcliffe recognizes that these games are es
pecially important to prepare the team for its
future matches against conference foes.
"We have to keep getting better as a team."
Ratcliffe said."As much as we've been playing
well, we can continue to get better as we move
towards the Pac-10 season."

"The important thing is that we are not look
ing too far ahead," senior defender and team
captain Marisa Abegg said. "[We] are taking
each game as it comes and just trying to enjoy
the ride. Already the season has been wonder
ful, and the team is doing a great job of working
hard at practice each and every day, and then
translating that onto the field for games."
And it certainly has been translating beau
tifully for the Cardinal so far. Abegg has mar
shaled a backline that has allowed only three
goals in nine games.
The team's offensive output has not been
too shabby either, with 26 goals to the Cardi
nal's credit to start the year.
Combined, those numbers have helped
Stanford to an 8-0-1 start and a No. 6 national

ranking. Most recently, the Cardinal is coming
off of an impressive showing in last weekend's
Santa Clara Invitational where it breezed to
the title, winning its two games by a combined
score of 7-1.
Stanford's opponent this weekend has not
enjoyed the same kind of start to the season.
But the Gaels certainly cannot be too disap
pointed either. With a record of 5-3-1, St.
Mary's has almost matched its previous sea
son's total of six wins, so the team has im
proved substantially. In the two teams' match
last year, the Cardinal completely dominated
the Gaels, out-shooting them 22-4 en route to
a 4-1 victory.
However, St. Mary's has shown a lot of
tenacity this year, collecting three of their five
victories in overtime battles.Their most recent
came last weekend, as they beat UC-Irvine 2-
I to become co-champions of the Irvine Invi
tational. Midfielder Ashley Nied scored both
goals in that game and currently leads the
team with four goals on the season.
St. Mary's,though, has not met an opponent
of the Cardinal's caliber yet this year — in fact,
they have yet to play a ranked opponent —
making this a true test for the Gaels. Stanford
will aim to take advantage of its opponent's in
experience, and it will be important for the
Cardinal to impose its game early on and pre
vent the Gaels from getting into a rhythm.
7Tie Cardinal will also look to take full ad
vantage of playing on its home field, as this is
the team's first home game since students
have returned from summer vacation.
"This weekend should be another great
game against a quality team," Abegg said.
"Hopefully we can get some rowdy fans to
come out and support us on Friday."
The match is scheduled for a 7 p.m. start at
Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
