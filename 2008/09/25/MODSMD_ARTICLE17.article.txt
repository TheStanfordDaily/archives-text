## Lincecum shines in dull season 
### 
For baseball fans living on the
west coast (and in particular
the Bay Area),2ooß has been a
largely disappointing season. The
Angels ran away with tliei? division
and stand a real chance of doing
damage in the postseason, but out
side of Anaheim there hadn't been
much to celebrate.
The Dodgers are still holding on
to a playoff spot in a weak division,
but would need to greatly outper
form expectations to reach the
World Series. And the remaining
teams have never been in serious
contention. With just a handful of
games remaining the Giants. Athlet
ics, Padres and Mariners all have los
ing records and a combined 264 wins
and 365 losses.
So the Bay's hometown teams
won't be heading to the postseason,
but that doesn't mean there is noth
ing to look forward to in the final
days of the year. In fact, the Giants'
final game will easily be the most im
portant and anticipated of the sea
son.
But, before I tell you why, do you
really need a reason to get excited
for the last bit of summer in the
sporting world? Can't the game of
baseball sell itself? This weekend at
AT&T Park will be your final chance
to sit outside and watch professional
baseball until next spring. And I'm
sure, just one week into the quarter,
homework can't be a problem.
Most people, though, aren't as
hopelessly sentimental as me about
watching another baseball season
recede into autumn, so I will give
you that one big, tangible reason
why you should care about the Gi
ants this weekend:'fim I Jncecum.
The 34,000 people present at
Lincecum's previous start on Tues
day got to witness the young right
hander set the Giants single-season
strikeout record with his 252 nd K,
passing Jason Schmidt's previous
mark of 251. Unfortunately, they
also got see the Rockies light him up
for six runs in 4 1/3 innings — tied
for his shortest outing this year and
the most runs he has allowed this
season.
But despite the poor outing (in
which he still did strike out nine),
Lincecum is still a front-runner for
the National League Cy Young
award and his final start in the Gi
ants' season finale against the
Dodgers on Sunday afternoon could
make all the difference in that race.
The favorites still look to be
Lincecum and Arizona's Brandon
Webb. Lincecum currently trails
Webb 22 to 17 in wins, but has huge
leads in strikeouts (252 to 176) and
ERA (2.66 to 3.24, only Johan San
tana of the New York Mets current
ly has a better ERA in the NL, at
2.64). Both pitchers have one more
scheduled start remaining —
Webb's likely on Saturday — and
the Cy Young could come down to
simply who has the better game.
No matter how disappointing the
Giants were as a team this year,
Lincecum has been nearly flawless.
He is pitching one of the best sea
sons in Giants history, and the 24
year-old is only going to get better.
Watching him try to wrap up a Cy
Young season on Sunday afternoon
will be a real treat for any sports fan.
Giants fans, especially, should r Jish
the opportunity to support him in
that endeavor and thank him for
what he has given them this year.
And, if you still need one more
reason to hop on Cal Train and grab
some bleacher seats on Sunday, con
sider this: as a thank you from the
Giants, every fan in attendance will
be entered to win a brand new Toy
ota Rav4.That's right, you can enjoy
one final day that truly feels like
summer, possibly see the Cy Young
award won, and then throw away
your return ticket as you drive home
in a brand new car.
Seriously though, baseball fans
don't want to go to the ballpark just
to be outside, or to get free stuff (al
though every one 1 know would
gladly take that free car). We want to
cheer for our team and our heroes,
we want them to win and we want
them to be the best, even if just for a
day.
Tim Lincecum was and is the
biggest hero on the Giants this year.
Whether the Giants win or lose on
Sunday it will be their final game,but
with Lincecum on the hill they have
a chance to play like and. for a day,
be champions.
So I encourage you all to head to
the game on Sunday to bid adieu to
the 2008 regular season. Support
Tim Lincecum for what he has done
this year and cheer him on to one
more Cy Young caliber perform
ance.
Enjoy spending one final after
noon at the ballpark, get one last
hot dog, cheer for the hometown
team one more time, maybe win a
car. and get up for the 7th Inning
Stretch one more time before we
turn our attention fully to the Cardi
nal, 49ers, Raiders, Warriors and
Sharks. That is. until the boys of
summer return to the Bay.
And if you do happen to win that
car, maybe you could give me a lift
back.

Erik Adams would really, really like
to win that sweet, sweet Rav4. Email
