## New White Plaza faces mixed reactions 
### NIKHIL JOSHI DESK EDITOR 
White Plaza is fresh from a renovation costing
over $4 million, now boasting repaved pathways, a
brand new stage and newly installed landscaping,
among many other features.
But the project's high sticker price, along with
the way it has changed bicycle traffic, has resulted
in a lukewarm to negative reception amongst stu
dents.
"I don't really mind [the renovations] any
more," said Siddhartha Oza 'll. "I do think they've
done a fantastic job renovating the area, but given
concerns about bicycle congestion, and all the
other issues that exist in the community, there may
have been better ways to use the $4 million."

According to Cathy Blake, assistant director of
the University's planning office, the White Plaza
project's cost was driven by maintenance work
that does not necessarily catch the public's eye.
"A lot of [the renovation work] was under
ground," Blake said. "A lot of it was utility work
that you don't see. There are things that need rou
tine maintenance."
The renovations are the product of several
years of planning, and the University was careful
to meet with a variety of White Plaza users and
stakeholders. Different features requested by var
ious groups during the planning stages also con
tributed to the high cost of the project.
"We didn't just invent a project out of the blue,
but we started with workshops four years ago with
students, faculty and users of White Plaza," Blake

said. "Then we went through a couple years to get
the improvements that people wanted. It wasn't all
about aesthetics; it was about safety and function
al things. I think the plans meet all the criteria peo
ple gave us."
Some students disagree. Upperclassmen famil
iar with White Plaza before the renovation were
particularly dissatisfied with the change, which
many cite as unattractive and uninviting for large
gatherings.
"I think there's too much concrete," said Peter
Zaffaroni 'O9. "It's harder to bike through White
Plaza now, especially if you're coming from the
Row houses. And what are those cement blocks?
Are they seats? They are definitely an impediment
to traffic."
Funding for the project came
mostly from a $4 million gift from the
President's Fund, although other gift
funds were used for certain parts of
the construction.
Students may come to appreciate
the new White Plaza once construc
tion has completely finished.
According to Blake, getting approval
from the Board of Trustees pushed
the start date of the project into late
spring, making it difficult for manu
facturers to provide necessary parts.
While actual construction has been
completed, the University is still wait
ing on contract manufacturers to
deliver a number of items.
"Everything is not finished, and
there are a few things we are aware
of that are going to change," Blake
said. "All the trash bins, the benches

and the light fixtures are not quite
there. There are some eables for stu
dent banners that are not up yet."
Soon, a canopy for the newly con
structed stage will be built as part of
the project's second phase.
University officials are currently
working with prospective users of the
stage to make sure the canopy meets
student demands.
Blake said the White Plaza reno
vations have actually gone more
smoothly than other recent projects,
such as the Serra Mall renovations.
Most of the construction was com
pleted in two and a half months.
The class of 2012 seems not to be
bothered by the plaza changes.
"When I stood out there last week
with the frosh, HO percent of the peo
ple were going as they were supposed
to do," Blake said. "As long as the
majority of people are following the
travel routes, that's all we really hope
for."
