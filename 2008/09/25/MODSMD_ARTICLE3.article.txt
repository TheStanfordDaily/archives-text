## New White Plaza faces mixed reactions 
### NIKHIL JOSHI DESK EDITOR 
White Plaza is fresh from a renovation costing
over $4 million, now boasting repaved pathways, a
brand new stage and newly installed landscaping,
among many other features.
But the project's high sticker price, along with
the way it has changed bicycle traffic, has resulted
in a lukewarm to negative reception amongst stu
dents.
"I don't really mind [the renovations] any
more," said Siddhartha Oza 'll. "I do think they've
done a fantastic job renovating the area, but given
concerns about bicycle congestion, and all the
other issues that exist in the community, there may
have been better ways to use the $4 million."

According to Cathy Blake, assistant director of
the University's planning office, the White Plaza
project's cost was driven by maintenance work
that does not necessarily catch the public's eye.
"A lot of [the renovation work] was under
ground," Blake said. "A lot of it was utility work
that you don't see. There are things that need rou
tine maintenance."
The renovations are the product of several
years of planning, and the University was careful
to meet with a variety of White Plaza users and
stakeholders. Different features requested by var
ious groups during the planning stages also con
tributed to the high cost of the project.
"We didn't just invent a project out of the blue,
but we started with workshops four years ago with
students, faculty and users of White Plaza," Blake

said. "Then we went through a couple years to get
the improvements that people wanted. It wasn't all
about aesthetics; it was about safety and function
al things. I think the plans meet all the criteria peo
ple gave us."
Some students disagree. Upperclassmen famil
iar with White Plaza before the renovation were
particularly dissatisfied with the change, which
many cite as unattractive and uninviting for large
gatherings.
"I think there's too much concrete," said Peter
Zaffaroni 'O9. "It's harder to bike through White
Plaza now, especially if you're coming from the
Row houses. And what are those cement blocks?
Are they seats? They are definitely an impediment
