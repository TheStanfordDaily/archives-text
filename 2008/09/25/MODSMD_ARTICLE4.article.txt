# Prof.looks at poor economy
## Wall Street, Capitol Hill, Stanford all affected by financial downturn 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
Financial turmoil bodes badly for
everyone Wall Street, the global
economy, American workers and
Stanford students included. As word
of financial collapses, volatile stock
markets and the government's
bailouts of major companies bom
bard the headlines, the landscape of
the financial world has changed
irrevocably.
But questions remain: How much
longer will the financial crisis last?
Will the downturn transform into an
economic recession? What are the
consequences for finance-minded
Stanford students?
Economic Woes and Concerns
In March of this year, the invest
ment bank Bear Stearns became the
first major victim of the subprime
mortgage crisis, avoiding sudden col
lapse by selling itself to JPMorgan
Chase. Three weeks ago, the federal
government bailed out Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac, the leading mort
gage lenders to U.S. homeowners, in
the largest government bailout of a
private company in the nation's his
tory.
And last week, 158-year-old
investment bank Lehman Brothers
filed for bankruptcy, and the U.S.
government lent $B5 billion to
American International Group, Inc.
(AIG), the world's largest insurer.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson
then proposed that the government
purchase $7OO billion worth of mort
gage-backed assets the bad debt
that has been weighing down the
balance sheets of commercial and
investment banks from those
banks.
"A few months ago, there were
five investment banks; yesterday,
there were two," said Darrell Duffie,
professor of finance at the Graduate
School of Business (GSB), on
Monday. "Today, there are zero pure
investment banks. The financial
world has changed."
What are the root causes of the
financial crisis? For a financial crisis
of this magnitude, there is plenty of
blame to go around. Analysts dis
agree over specifics, but a few parties
are commonly faulted.
"Mortgage lending practices had

become poor, banks did not make
prudent decisions about their trades
or their leverage and regulators did
not focus sufficient attention on the
stability of certain financial institu
tions," Duffie said. "I hope we'll be
doing all of these things better going
forward."
Credit rating agencies, which
assign credit ratings to issuers of
debt obligations and debt instru
ments themselves, have been blamed
for underrating the risk of certain
companies.
Similarly, government regulators
of the financial industry have been
lax. A recent study by Stanford law
and business faculty members ques
tioned the validity of indexes that
evaluate the competence of publicly
traded corporations' governance.
All of these factors combined to
create an "economic Pearl Harbor,"
as high-profile investor Warren
Buffett has labeled it. Duffie com
pares this financial crisis to the mar
ket crash in 1929, which led to the
Great Depression.
"It's hard to find another finan
cial crisis of this magnitude in terms
of the threat level of the existence of
major financial firms, the volume of
the write-downs and the immediacy
of the government's response," he
said.
The speed of the government's
actions to curb further decline has
increased with the worsening of the
financial crisis. Though financial ana
lysts disagree regarding the level and
manner of the government's
response, Duffie gave Paulson and
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke good marks.
"I would give Paulson and
Bernanke an A- for their efforts thus
far," Duffie said.
Americans, however, disagree
with Duffie. A margin of 55 percent
to 31 percent polled in a
Bloomberg/Los Angeles Times poll
said the government should not bail
out private companies with taxpay
ers' money, even if the companies'
collapse could damage the economy.
To dissipate widespread criticism
of the proposed $7OO billion bailout
of Wall Street, U.S. President George
Bush addressed the nation yester
day, explaining the current economic
downturn and promoting the impor
tance of the financial rescue plan.
"I propose that the federal gov
ernment reduce the risk posed by
these troubled assets and supply
urgently needed money so banks and
other financial institutions can avoid
collapse and resume lending," Bush
said. "This rescue effort is not aimed
at preserving any individual company
or industry. It is aimed at preserving
America's overall economy."
Similarly, Paulson, Bernanke and
presidential candidates Sen. Barack
Obama (D-lll.) and Sen. John
McCain (R-Ariz.) have also made
similar statements urging swift gov
ernment action.
"We don't know if Congress will
pass the bill [proposed by Paulson]
in an unencumbered manner,"
Duffie said. "Even if the bill passes
quickly, there are still questions of
whether it will be effective in stop
ping the credit crisis. We are still in
an extremely fragile period."
Prospects for Wall Street Hopefuls
As Wall Street contemplates its
rapid decline and brainstorms meth
ods to salvage the banking model,
Stanford's Wall Street hopefuls
speculate about the job security of
the financial field. Last spring, when
investment bank Bear Stearns was
bought out by JPMorgan Chase, job
offers for new hires were withdrawn.
"The recruiting activity by invest
ment banks has dropped," said
Lance Choy, director of the Stanford
Career Development Center
(CDC). "There are concerns about
further mergers, many banks don't
exist and others have cut back quite
a bit."
While Bank of America bought
out Merrill Lynch, and Barclays
bought (subject to regulatory
approval) the North America invest
ment banking and trading divisions
of Lehman Brothers, large mergers
require a substantial period of tran
sition. which means these firms will
not be hiring anytime soon either.
Choy encouraged students to
think broadly and have backup
plans for jobs or summer intern
ships.
"How many people are truly

interested in finance, rather than
interested just because their friends
are doing it?" Choy asked. "There
are many pathways to doing great
and interesting things, and Wall
Street is merely one career path.
Students need to spend more time
looking at different options."
"Recruiting will be down for the
financial side of the market, but
there are many other sectors of the
job market that are doing well,"
Choy added. "Our recruiting sched
ule is full."
Emily Hsi '09, who interned at an
investment bank over the summer,
differentiated between the hiring
prospects of different jobs in
finance.
"Stanford students who go into
the banking industry usually work in
sales and trading or investment
banking," Hsi said. "Sales and trad
ing has probably been hit harder
than investment banking."
' It's definitely not a good time to
become a trader, but investment
banking will definitely pick up in the
future," the senior added.
Traditionally during difficult
market conditions, those employed
in the financial sector choose to
return to school, typically to pursue
either MBAs or law degrees. The
increased application volume usual
ly causes the admission rate of grad
uate schools to decrease during eco
nomic downturns.
"I suspect that with the invest
ment banking sector down, there
might also be increased interest in
consulting. Teach for America and
the Peace Corps," Choy said.
Nedu Ottih '10, who interned at
Lehman Brothers over the summer,
said he remains interested in finance
and business, but may explore jobs
outside of investment banking, such
as consulting or corporate finance, in
light of the financial uncertainty.
"I'm re-evaluating the situation,"
Ottih said. "The industry is changing
really fast. At the moment, there
aren't that many deals being done
due to the credit crisis and how
expensive it is to borrow money. The
excitement of working on live proj
ects has fizzled out for now."
"I'm just watching closely to see
what happens over the next few
months," he added.
As will the rest of the world.

Financial turmoil bodes badly for
everyone Wall Street, the global
economy, American workers and
Stanford students included. As word
of financial collapses, volatile stock
markets and the government's
bailouts of major companies bom
bard the headlines, the landscape of
the financial world has changed
irrevocably.
But questions remain: How much
longer will the financial crisis last?
Will the downturn transform into an
economic recession? What are the
consequences for finance-minded
Stanford students?
Economic Woes and Concerns
In March of this year, the invest
ment bank Bear Stearns became the
first major victim of the subprime
mortgage crisis, avoiding sudden col
lapse by selling itself to JPMorgan
Chase. Three weeks ago, the federal
government bailed out Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac, the leading mort
gage lenders to U.S. homeowners, in
the largest government bailout of a
private company in the nation's his
tory.
And last week, 158-year-old
investment bank Lehman Brothers
filed for bankruptcy, and the U.S.
government lent $B5 billion to
American International Group, Inc.
(AIG), the world's largest insurer.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson
then proposed that the government
purchase $7OO billion worth of mort
gage-backed assets the bad debt
that has been weighing down the
balance sheets of commercial and
investment banks from those
banks.
"A few months ago, there were
five investment banks; yesterday,
there were two," said Darrell Duffie,
professor of finance at the Graduate
School of Business (GSB), on
Monday. "Today, there are zero pure
investment banks. The financial
world has changed."
What are the root causes of the
financial crisis? For a financial crisis
of this magnitude, there is plenty of
blame to go around. Analysts dis
agree over specifics, but a few parties
are commonly faulted.
"Mortgage lending practices had

become poor, banks did not make
prudent decisions about their trades
or their leverage and regulators did
not focus sufficient attention on the
stability of certain financial institu
tions," Duffie said. "I hope we'll be
doing all of these things better going
forward."
Credit rating agencies, which
assign credit ratings to issuers of
debt obligations and debt instru
ments themselves, have been blamed
for underrating the risk of certain
companies.
Similarly, government regulators
of the financial industry have been
lax. A recent study by Stanford law
and business faculty members ques
tioned the validity of indexes that
evaluate the competence of publicly
traded corporations' governance.
All of these factors combined to
create an "economic Pearl Harbor,"
as high-profile investor Warren
Buffett has labeled it. Duffie com
pares this financial crisis to the mar
ket crash in 1929, which led to the
Great Depression.
"It's hard to find another finan
cial crisis of this magnitude in terms
of the threat level of the existence of
major financial firms, the volume of
the write-downs and the immediacy
of the government's response," he
said.
The speed of the government's
actions to curb further decline has
increased with the worsening of the
financial crisis. Though financial ana
lysts disagree regarding the level and
manner of the government's
response, Duffie gave Paulson and
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke good marks.
"I would give Paulson and
Bernanke an A- for their efforts thus
far," Duffie said.
Americans, however, disagree
with Duffie. A margin of 55 percent
to 31 percent polled in a
Bloomberg/Los Angeles Times poll
said the government should not bail
out private companies with taxpay
ers' money, even if the companies'
collapse could damage the economy.
To dissipate widespread criticism
of the proposed $7OO billion bailout
of Wall Street, U.S. President George
Bush addressed the nation yester
day, explaining the current economic
downturn and promoting the impor
tance of the financial rescue plan.
"I propose that the federal gov
ernment reduce the risk posed by
these troubled assets and supply
urgently needed money so banks and
other financial institutions can avoid
collapse and resume lending," Bush
said. "This rescue effort is not aimed
at preserving any individual company
or industry. It is aimed at preserving
America's overall economy."
Similarly, Paulson, Bernanke and
presidential candidates Sen. Barack
Obama (D-lll.) and Sen. John
McCain (R-Ariz.) have also made
similar statements urging swift gov
ernment action.
"We don't know if Congress will
pass the bill [proposed by Paulson]
in an unencumbered manner,"
Duffie said. "Even if the bill passes
quickly, there are still questions of
whether it will be effective in stop
ping the credit crisis. We are still in
an extremely fragile period."
Prospects for Wall Street Hopefuls
As Wall Street contemplates its
rapid decline and brainstorms meth
ods to salvage the banking model,
Stanford's Wall Street hopefuls
speculate about the job security of
the financial field. Last spring, when
investment bank Bear Stearns was
bought out by JPMorgan Chase, job
offers for new hires were withdrawn.
"The recruiting activity by invest
ment banks has dropped," said
Lance Choy, director of the Stanford
Career Development Center
(CDC). "There are concerns about
further mergers, many banks don't
exist and others have cut back quite
a bit."
While Bank of America bought
out Merrill Lynch, and Barclays
bought (subject to regulatory
approval) the North America invest
ment banking and trading divisions
of Lehman Brothers, large mergers
require a substantial period of tran
sition. which means these firms will
not be hiring anytime soon either.
Choy encouraged students to
think broadly and have backup
plans for jobs or summer intern
ships.
"How many people are truly

interested in finance, rather than
interested just because their friends
are doing it?" Choy asked. "There
are many pathways to doing great
and interesting things, and Wall
Street is merely one career path.
Students need to spend more time
looking at different options."
"Recruiting will be down for the
financial side of the market, but
there are many other sectors of the
job market that are doing well,"
Choy added. "Our recruiting sched
ule is full."
Emily Hsi '09, who interned at an
investment bank over the summer,
differentiated between the hiring
prospects of different jobs in
finance.
"Stanford students who go into
the banking industry usually work in
sales and trading or investment
banking," Hsi said. "Sales and trad
ing has probably been hit harder
than investment banking."
' It's definitely not a good time to
become a trader, but investment
banking will definitely pick up in the
future," the senior added.
Traditionally during difficult
market conditions, those employed
in the financial sector choose to
return to school, typically to pursue
either MBAs or law degrees. The
increased application volume usual
ly causes the admission rate of grad
uate schools to decrease during eco
nomic downturns.
"I suspect that with the invest
ment banking sector down, there
might also be increased interest in
consulting. Teach for America and
the Peace Corps," Choy said.
Nedu Ottih '10, who interned at
Lehman Brothers over the summer,
said he remains interested in finance
and business, but may explore jobs
outside of investment banking, such
as consulting or corporate finance, in
light of the financial uncertainty.
"I'm re-evaluating the situation,"
Ottih said. "The industry is changing
really fast. At the moment, there
aren't that many deals being done
due to the credit crisis and how
expensive it is to borrow money. The
excitement of working on live proj
ects has fizzled out for now."
"I'm just watching closely to see
what happens over the next few
months," he added.
As will the rest of the world.
