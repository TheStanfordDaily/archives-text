# Prof.looks at poor economy
## Wall Street, Capitol Hill, Stanford all affected by financial downturn 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
Financial turmoil bodes badly for
everyone Wall Street, the global
economy, American workers and
Stanford students included. As word
of financial collapses, volatile stock
markets and the government's
bailouts of major companies bom
bard the headlines, the landscape of
the financial world has changed
irrevocably.
But questions remain: How much
longer will the financial crisis last?
Will the downturn transform into an
economic recession? What are the
consequences for finance-minded
Stanford students?
Economic Woes and Concerns
In March of this year, the invest
ment bank Bear Stearns became the
first major victim of the subprime
mortgage crisis, avoiding sudden col
lapse by selling itself to JPMorgan
Chase. Three weeks ago, the federal
government bailed out Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac, the leading mort
gage lenders to U.S. homeowners, in
the largest government bailout of a
private company in the nation's his
tory.
And last week, 158-year-old
investment bank Lehman Brothers
filed for bankruptcy, and the U.S.
government lent $B5 billion to
American International Group, Inc.
(AIG), the world's largest insurer.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson
then proposed that the government
purchase $7OO billion worth of mort
gage-backed assets the bad debt
that has been weighing down the
balance sheets of commercial and
investment banks from those
banks.
"A few months ago, there were
five investment banks; yesterday,
there were two," said Darrell Duffie,
professor of finance at the Graduate
School of Business (GSB), on
Monday. "Today, there are zero pure
investment banks. The financial
world has changed."
What are the root causes of the
financial crisis? For a financial crisis
of this magnitude, there is plenty of
blame to go around. Analysts dis
agree over specifics, but a few parties
are commonly faulted.
"Mortgage lending practices had

become poor, banks did not make
prudent decisions about their trades
or their leverage and regulators did
not focus sufficient attention on the
stability of certain financial institu
tions," Duffie said. "I hope we'll be
doing all of these things better going
forward."
Credit rating agencies, which
assign credit ratings to issuers of
debt obligations and debt instru
ments themselves, have been blamed
for underrating the risk of certain
companies.
Similarly, government regulators
of the financial industry have been
lax. A recent study by Stanford law
and business faculty members ques
tioned the validity of indexes that
evaluate the competence of publicly
traded corporations' governance.
All of these factors combined to
create an "economic Pearl Harbor,"
as high-profile investor Warren
Buffett has labeled it. Duffie com
pares this financial crisis to the mar
ket crash in 1929, which led to the
Great Depression.
"It's hard to find another finan
cial crisis of this magnitude in terms
of the threat level of the existence of
major financial firms, the volume of
the write-downs and the immediacy
of the government's response," he
said.
The speed of the government's
actions to curb further decline has
increased with the worsening of the
financial crisis. Though financial ana
lysts disagree regarding the level and
manner of the government's
response, Duffie gave Paulson and
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben
Bernanke good marks.
"I would give Paulson and
Bernanke an A- for their efforts thus
far," Duffie said.
Americans, however, disagree
with Duffie. A margin of 55 percent
to 31 percent polled in a
Bloomberg/Los Angeles Times poll
said the government should not bail
out private companies with taxpay
ers' money, even if the companies'
collapse could damage the economy.
To dissipate widespread criticism
of the proposed $7OO billion bailout
of Wall Street, U.S. President George
Bush addressed the nation yester
day, explaining the current economic
