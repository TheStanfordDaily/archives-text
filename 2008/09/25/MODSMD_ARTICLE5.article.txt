## Beloved Stanford athletics fan passes away 
### AMANDA ZHANG 
David Hahn, sports fanatic and a beloved
member of the Stanford community, was
found dead last Tuesday. He was 35 years old.
Around 1 p.m. on Sept. 16, Hahn was
found collapsed in a parking lot along Ash
Street near his home in Palo Alto. Hahn lived
at the Page Mill Court Apartments, an assist
ed living facility that serves 26 adults.
Hahn, known more often by Stanford stu
dents as "Super Dave," was often sighted
around campus, dressed head to toe in
Stanford gear. He worked for the Florence
Moore dining hall but was more widely rec
ognized for his presence at Stanford sporting
events. He was such a big fan of the school
that he named his cat Stanford.
Hahn was especially loved by the
Stanford Band. He frequently attended the
Band's practice sessions, occasionally even
joining in with the drum section.
"Every sporting event we played at, he
was there," said Kalena Masching 'OB, a Band
member who had known Super Dave since

she was ten years old, when she was intro
duced to him by her father. "He came to
every Monday rehearsal. It was so weird to
not have him there this Monday, greeting all
the new freshmen."
"[Dave] had a knack for remembering
faces," she added. "One day, he ran up to me

at Baskin Robbins, picked me up and hugged
me. I didn't even recall meeting him!"
Hahn, a graduate of Palo Alto High
School and a well-known and beloved resi
dent of Palo Alto, suffered from Williams
syndrome, a neurodevelopmental disorder
that caused a heart murmur and several
other disabilities.
"To me he was just an inspiration," said
Jack Cackler 'O9. "He made so much with
what he had, all with a smile on his face."
ABC News Correspondent Jake Tapper,
whose brother married Hahn's sister in 2005,
wrote in his blog,"[Hahn] loved everyone, he
judged no one, he was not on the lookout for
ulterior motives."
A private funeral for family and close
friends was held on Sept. 19, and a public
memorial took place at Kol Emeth
Synagogue on Sunday, Sept. 21. Hundreds of
locals attended the service, including mem
bers of the Stanford Band.
Brian Schell, conductor for the Band, rec

"He made so much
with what he had, all
with a smile on his
face."
