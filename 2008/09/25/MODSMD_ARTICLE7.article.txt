## The 						Humble Professor A 						spotlight on Psychology Prof. Albert Bandura 
### TOMMYTOBIN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
If you walk into the unassuming office of Prof. Al
bert Bandura, you'll be Hooded with rows upon
rows of books, and high stacks of papers. You'll be
greeted with large amounts of whiteout, and a load
of writing utensils. You might even be struck by
what you don't find — a computer.
Amazingly, visitors to Bandura's office tend not to no
tice a large plaque denoting his Lifetime Achievement
Award from the American Psychological Association or
the plaque from the Mac Arthur Foundation. His office
demonstrates one fact that rings true about Bandura —
despite the fact that his peers consider him the world's
greatest living psychologist: 1 le is one of the gentlest, most
humble and most sincere individuals you will ever en
counter.
I nless you've been introduced to the discipline of psy
chology, you may have missed the professor and his work.
Here's a brief sketch: Bandura was born in the small
Canadian hamlet of Mundare, Alberta, in the early 19205.
Hew ent on to develop the theory of observational learn
ing with his Bobo Doll experiment in the 19505. Since
1953, he has been an active faculty member in the psychol
ogy department here at Stanford, where he is the David
Starr Jordan Professor of Social Sciences.
The Daily's Tommy Tobin '10, a research assistant for
Bandura. spoke with him about his life and his work in
psychology.
Stanford Daily: Prof. Bandura, let's discuss your hum
ble beginnings. Growing up in Mundare, what was life like
in rural Alberta?
Albert Bandura: It was a small hamlet, population 400;
it w as essentially a community of immigrants from Poland
and Ukraine. Life w as very difficult. My father worked on
laying track tor the Trans-Canada Railroad,and my moth
er worked in a local store. When they garnered enough
money, they [got] a homestead cheap. But the land was
dense with boulders and was heavily forested. There was
little mechanization then and it was a tough battle against
the elements.
We often have academic debates about construction
ism. Life in Alberta, in that time, was not an academic sub
ject for debate with arcane language — it was a lived real
ity. They had to construct their whole environment and

their own lifestyle.
But they also knew how to party: they had a lot of
saints, which provided many opportunities for celebra
tions. They also brewed their own spirits — 1 was struck
by their remarkable creativity. Hi ere was one farmer
there who sectioned off part of his steam engine for grind
ing his wheat, and in the other part distilled his alcoholic
spirits. This is an early example of multi-tasking!
The transition from this small hamlet in Northern Al
berta to the balmy palms of Stanford was a remarkable
transformation, to say the least.
SD: Throughout your work, there is a ringing tone of op
timism and ingenuity of the human spirit. Do you think that
your time in Northern Alberta had a part to play in that?
AB: Oh ves. It really placed a heavy emphasis on the
exercise of human agency, in that one had to create envi
ronments and the opportunities because of the limited re
sources. For example, in education we had one school
house that housed first grade through high school. There
were only two teachers teaching the entire high school
curriculum, which meant that they were poorly equipped
in many of the subject matters.
We pilfered the trigonometry answer book and
brought the class to a screeching halt,so we had to educate
ourselves. The self-regulatory skills have served me well
as I moved on through the higher levels of education sys
tems.
SI): Could you talk a little about your transition from
the one-room schoolhouse to the University of British
Columbia, onto the University of lowa and finally to the
balmy palms of Stanford in the early 19505?
AB: My parents encouraged me to expand niv experi
ences during my summer breaks. They essentially pre
sented me with two options: I could either remain in
Mundare.till the farmland, play pool and drink myself to
oblivion in the beer parlor, or 1 might try to get a higher
education. The latter option seemed more appealing to
me. During summer breaks I worked in a door company
in Edmonton.
In my final summer break before mv senior year in
high school. I explained to my parents that there was a job
in the Yukon with an attractive monthly stipend. This was
a base camp for maintaining the Alaska Highway from
sinking into the muskeg.
This wasn't "Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood." It was an in
teresting bunch of characters who were escaping draft
boards, probation officers, irate ex-wives and creditors. As

part of my job, I drove into Whitehorse to retrieve sup
plies. I soon realized that the supplies consisted mainly of
booze.That turned out to be the camp's main nutrient.
When it came time to pack for college, I looked for a
more benign climate. The University of British Columbia
seemed to fit that bill very well.
ITiere were a couple of elements that highlighted the
fortuitous character of life. Psychologists are interested in
explaining, p'edicting and modifying behavior. But some
of the most important determinants of life paths can occur
through the most trivial of circumstances.
I got into psychology through a fortuitous event. I was
commuting with a group of pre-meds and engineering stu
dents: they had classes in the early morning — I didn't
think life existed that early! One morning, I was wasting
time in the library. Someone had forgotten to return a
course catalog and I thumbed through it attempting to
find a filler course to occupy the early time slot. I noticed
a course in psychology that would serve as excellent filler.
It sparked my interest and 1 found my career.
In another fortuitous element, [the university] re
quired two physical education courses for graduation.
[After trying indoor PE.outdoor PE and archery], I made
a hasty downward descent and decided to register for a
golf course. One Sunday during graduate school, mv
friend and I decided to play a round of golf. There were
two women ahead of us.They were slowing down, we were
speeding up. Before long, we became a jovial couple. I met
my wife-to-be in the sand trap!
When 1 was the president of the Western Psychological
Association. 1 decided to select a topic that was unpre
dictable. on the grounds that being predictable is boring. I
addressed the psychology of chance encounters, marital
partnerships and occupational life paths. I decided to
bring some science on the fortuitous character of life.
I received my doctoral degree in 1952 at the Universi
ty of lowa and joined the faculty at Stanford in 1953.1 [re
cently completed my] 56th year at Stanford. That's more
than half a century. As the saying goes, it's not the amount
of miles traveled but the amount of tread you have left
that makes a difference. I'm saddled up for the next half
century.
1 recently received an email from a high school student
in advanced psychology. He explained that they were hav
ing a heated debate.The email read."Dear Professor Ban
dura. are you still living?" I replied, "This email is being
written from the other side."

SI): When you came to Stanford in the early 19505, the
Department of Psychology was housed in Cubberley. It
has since moved to Jordan Hall in the Main Quad. What
are some of the other major changes on campus that
you've witnessed throughout your many years on the
Farm?
AB: When I arrived at Stanford, our psychology de
partment only had only about 10 faculty members. The
University was a much smaller place.centered around the
Quadrangle.
Stanford underwent a major transformational change
in the late 1950s and early l%()s. For every faculty position
a committee was formed to identify the top scholar in that
field. Departments received additional billets. The deci
sion was made to relocate the Medical School from San
Francisco to the main campus to integrate the sciences
with the social sciences.
That was an extraordinary time to be at Stanford, as
the University was undergoing the transformation into
one of the top universities in the world.


JEFF KEACHER/The Stanford Daily
SI): In your storied career, you
have won several awards, including
the Grawemeyer Award and the
American Psychological
Association's Lifetime Achievement
Award, and authored numerous
books, advanced theories of social
cognitive theory, self-efficacy and
agency. What do you consider to be
your crowning achievement, and
what are you most proud of in your
professional life?
AB: The crowning achievement
is what you do next. That is the chal
lenge that assures continual self
renewal. To hang around a place for
over half a century requires a high
capacity for self-renewal.
My work has centered on the the
ory of human agency and the mecha
nisms by which it is exercised. Most
of our psychological and philosophi
cal analyses are concerned only with
individual-level agency. I expanded
the notion of agency into three forms:
direct personal agency, which is one's
ability to exercise control over events
on which you have some influence;
proxy agency, in which we exercise
influence over others to act on our
behalf; and collective agency, in
which we work together to shape our
future.
The theory of self-efficacy gar
ners many citations because it lends
itself readily to social applications.
The work on self-regulation plays a
very influential role in the field of
education. Self-efficacy also played a
role in the field of health, transform
ing the discipline from essentially a
disease model to a health model.
Perhaps the most ambitious appli
cations of the theory are the global

applications to address some of the
most pressing global issues. There are
long-running serial dramas that have
been shown throughout the develop
ing world, in Africa. India, China and
Latin America. These global produc
tions are increasing national literacy,
promoting family planning, raising
the status of women and stemming
the tide of HIV/AIDS.
For example, in Sudan, women
are subjected to a brutal genital
mutilation procedure. In our serial
drama, a series of plotlines were
included that involved a young girl
to whom the viewers are deeply
bonded undergoing this brutal pro
cedure and Muslim clerics explain
ing that this practice is not sanc
tioned by their religion. Before our
serial drama, approximately 57 per
cent of the population supported the
practice; afterwards, 60 percent
favored abolishing the gruesome
practice.
These are widespread global
applications of the theory that
address issues of ecological sustain
ability. I recently wrote a paper on
impeding ecological sustainability
through selective moral disengage
ment. We are rapidly destroying our
planet, while adopting token ges
tures that make us feel like environ
mentalists. Much of my current
research is focused on large-scale
applications designed to provide a
habitable planet for future genera
tions.
