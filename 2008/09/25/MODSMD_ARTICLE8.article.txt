## Editorial Board Disappointment, with a hefty price tag 
### Vol. 234 Editorial Board 
After several months of construction,
the "new" White Plaza opened at
the start of the school year, only to
be met with disappointment and frustration
from many of those who have navigated La
suen Mall in the past. Coming in at over $4
million, the renovations have severely al
tered the basic makeup of an important Uni
versity location and done little to rectify the
ills the construction was meant to address.
By adding concrete blocks and trees to
the once open space of White Plaza, the Uni
versity has taken away one of the very few
central spots where large groups of students
could effectively gather. The Soviet-era
stones reduce the amount of available space
in what remains both a sizeable hub of traf
fic and the main area for student groups to
effectively table. In a few years, the newly
planted trees will render White Plaza no
longer a plaza.
The effect of the renovations on bike traf
fic is perhaps the most problematic aspect of
the changes. Stanford students now must
make sure they do not run into prospective a
cappella singers in the Fleet Street booth,
while simultaneously maneuvering around
stone squares that have orange cones pinned
on to cover the electrical wiring. The stones
are needless hazards for bikers, who could
incur serious injuries from run-ins.
Additionally, the installment of the traffic
cops is an unnecessarily punitive measure on
the part of the University. Streamlining the
flow of traffic on campus is an honorable
aim. But having officers standing in White
Plaza for the sole purpose of blocking off a
few yards of cement borders on the absurd,
particularly at an institution that prides itself
on not fettering the lives of its students.
While it may be convenient to lambaste
what initially appears to be a "Plaza to
Nowhere," we must admit that the rather

daunting sum was not totally misspent. Uni
versity landscape architect Cathy Blake also
told The Daily that necessary underground
modifications were made to the plaza (see
today's news article). Furthermore, the
stone walkway surrounding the Claw and
leading from Old Union to the Bookstore is
an aesthetically pleasing addition to the
area. (Unfortunately, there appears to be no
consistent vision in the renovations, with
stone walkways leading into the middle of
trees and stone circles arbitrarily surround
ing, for example, trashcans.)
Our greatest concern is the seeming lack
of student input on the changes. True, the
University reached out to students and staff
several years ago for feedback on ways to
improve White Plaza. But such outreach is
insufficient.The unpopular White Plaza ren
ovations do little to improve the Universi
ty's track record on integrating the sugges
tions of students. As Stanford takes on proj
ects in the future, we ask that the University
not simply solicit feedback through easily
disregarded surveys and committees with
token student representatives. Rather, Stan
ford must allow for more widespread stu
dent knowledge of and involvement in the
planning of projects. We hope that the Uni
versity can find a way to do so.
Particularly in an era when both presi
dential candidates are targeting the excesses
of the federal government, we call on the
University to bring a greater level of trans
parency to its actions. We ask that it be re
sponsive in answering questions about the
prudence of sizeable renovation, and effec
tively engage students on both projects that
have long-term ramifications and develop
ments that will immediately affect their
everyday lives. While well-intentioned, and
in a few respects an improvement on the
past, the new White Plaza fails to inspire ad
miration, only succeeding in creating pain in
the pocketbook.
