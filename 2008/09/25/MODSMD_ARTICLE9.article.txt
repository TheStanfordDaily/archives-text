### SPENCER PORTER BOB BOWLSBY 
"Whassup, Dawg"
I did not know Super Dave. I never met
him. I never shook his hand. I never told him
my name.
And yet he was my friend.
He introduced himself to me with a high
five, and he did it with such reckless aban
don that I assumed we were old friends sud
denly reunited. I thought we had met before
— that I must have just forgotten our first
encounter — but I knew that could not be
the case. How could you forget this man?
How could you see the backwards Stanford
hat, the Stanford jacket and the beaming
smile and not recognize him? Walking
through White Plaza during my freshman
year, I high-fived Super Dave — and I felt
great.
For four years, I walked, rode, ran and oc
casionally danced through the paths of
Stanford University. As a soccer player, I
spent a good amount of time in Arrillaga. As
a senior class president. I spent a good
amount of time in Tresidder Union. As a
Stanford student, I spent a larger amount of
time wasting time — stopping to talk along
the arcades, the lawns and the classrooms.
And always, with what seemed to be an end
less supply of red clothes and high-fives,
there walked Dave. Super Dave.
I consider myself an extrovert, but Tom
Cruise atop a couch would seem shy next to
this man. Everyone was his "dawg," a slight
ly elongated form of the canine nickname,
emphasizing the "aw" as if to lend a little
masculinity to his call — a little strength, a
little sense of empowerment. What every
one seemed to get from Dave — whether
through chance encounters, drum sessions
or longer talks — was empowerment.
For three years of my Stanford career, I
was a sports columnist for The Daily. For
many of those columns, I bemoaned Stan
ford Athletics. I railed on Ted Leland for
having a mediocre club and intramural
sports program. I decried the yell leaders. I
even said that I was metaphorically dating
the entire women's field hockey team, and
that they broke my heart.
But I never wrote about Dave. I never
wrote about the consummate Stanford fan
— the man who looked forward to every
home game with more fervor than a me
chanical engineering graduate student looks
forward to a date (my brother is a Stanford
ME grad student, so I know that it's true).
I constantly bemoaned the fans — the
lack of tailgating. the uninspired cheering,
the yell leaders' off-tempo chants. But I
never celebrated Dave.
He was our best yell leader. He was our
best fan. He was our best home-field advan
tage, a man who made himself a part of the
game in a 90,000-seat stadium.
He stood out from the crowd.
I should have written about Dave. I
should have talked about his high-fives. I
should have found all the stories that have
come pouring in over the last few days. I wish

I hadn't waited until now to finally reflect on
what it means to be the perfect fan. I wish I
had his enthusiasm for life.
If yell leaders ever do come back to Stan
ford, if they can find a way to find their place
among the milieu courtside, I do hope they
take a cue from Super Dave. I hope they find
that optimism, that endearing quality that
empowered all the dawgs out there. I hope
they name their captain neither some pun.
nor "czar" nor anything that rhymes with
"CoHo." 1 hope they give their captain the
title of "Super Dave."
It would be a fitting tribute, making it cer
tain that Stanford's biggest fan will always
be Super Dave.
I live in Los Angeles now. and my Stan
ford Athletics contact is limited. I have the
Internet, I have Fox Sports West and I have
the recollection that I'm still owed a letter
man's jacket.
But I also have my memories of my time
at Stanford and everything I truly miss about
the school that gave me so much. And now
I've found I have one more thing to miss.
I did not "know" Super Dave, and that's
my loss. But now he's gone, and that's our
loss.
David "Super Dave" Hahn passed away on Sept. 16.

On behalf of the athletic department and
our football program. I wanted to acknowl
edge all the students who were on hand on
Saturday night, Sept. 20, to watch the Cardi
nal defeat San Jose State.
Over 4,000 students made their way to
Stanford Stadium to enthusiastically sup
port their football team against a local rival.
Your presence and energy enlivened the en
tire stadium and was greatly appreciated by
every member of the football program.
A strong student turnout at our athletic
events does not go unnoticed by any of our
student-athletes, coaches or administrators.
You play an integral role in the success of
our teams.and it is my hope Stanford Athlet
ics continues to be a source of enjoyment
and camaraderie during your years at Stan
ford.
We also want to thank Dean Julie Lyth
cott-Haims and all of the New Student Ori
entation staff for their support in creating a
great environment in the stadium.
We look forward to seeing you again at
the Stanford Stadium when the Cardinal
meets Arizona on Oct. 11 in the annual
Homecoming game.
