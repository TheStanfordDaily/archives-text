# DEAR DR. PAUL,

I heard that once you get to college
you're supposed to use sandals in the
shower. I'm really used to
If I am the only one in my
dorm to go without shower slippers, will I
be safe?
Dear Fungus Phobic,
Shower Sandals arc a must. Not only arc they a fashionable bath-time
option, but they also help to prevent athlete's foot and plantar warts.
Sandals that dry quickly are better than "spongy" ones since athlete's
foot likes to grow in the warm damp skin in between your toes.
Alternatively, DP prescribes that you start peeing on your feet. Though
pee isn't antibacterial, it is in fact, sterile. I myself am a stubborn fellow
and, against my own advice, refuse to wear sandals in the shower. I've
been peeing on my own feet since I was a freshman and, so far, I've been
foot fungus free. Do the people in the shower next to you a favor and

pee on their feet too. If they get upset,
just tell them that you are trying to
eradicate all the fungus in the shower.
Regardless, wear a pair before you have
to explain to your girlfriend why your
feet are gross and smelly.
Everyone pees in the shower,

I*DR. PAUL IS NOT A REAL DOCTOR. HE IS IN
FACT, A REAL PRE-MED, THOUGH. HIS ADVICE
IS MEANT FOR ENTERTAINMENT PURPOSES
0 ONLY; FOLLOW IT AT YOUR OWN RISK.
