# Roxy's guide to Facebook flirting and more
## 
### 
a Oooh, look, he's cute! And he speaks French!" says
my roommate during another round of deliciously
sketchy Facebook stalking. But what happens next?
Poke him? Send a droll message? Post a picture of one
self in a scandalously itsy bikini?
Facebook has become a place where users can
indulgently browse the ranks of hotties in their

networks and, if done correctly, arrange for a

little face-to-face (or person on person)
action. Behold Roxy's mini guide to uti
lizing Facebook's sexy potential.
Applications: Roxy's new favorite appli
cation is a clever little invention called (
"Have Sex!" A glorious alternative to

the ambiguity of the poke, the "Have Sex!"
application allows lusty Facebookers to get

straight to the point, no beating around the prover-

bial bush. Choices of different positions and locations
keep things consistently kinky, not to mention free
from sexiling woes or emotional baggage. Imagine
encountering a cute "Have Sex!" playmate at a party
and saying, "Doggy style? Kitchen counter?" without
even a twinge of embarrassment. Don't be surprised if
he or she is inspired to try the real thing.
Poke: Not into virtual philandering? Never fear! For the
more chaste and refined, a subtle poke can be the per
fect amount of coy. But Facebook veterans know pok
ing is not as simple as it seems. Ranging from a friendly
nudge of acknowledgement to a sexy, potentially creepy,
gesture of interest, the poke can be difficult to interpret.

Hick a fetching new victim and let them enjoy the tease
of translation. Once a poke has been executed, prepare
for battle. Poking is like tennis — once poked, the ball
is in your court. Poke back, and the power is out of
your hands. Your poke is now on somebody else's com
puter screen, so easily removed, so easily ignored. Poke
back too quickly, and you seem overly eager; poke too

slowly and your friend is insulted. And always

remember to poke responsibly

I Status: Your status can be a wonderful place to
send out a sexy message to the world — just

keep it classy. "Jane Doe wants to get freaky
tonight!" could, for example, be replaced with

"Jane Doe is looking for an excuse to misbe-

have" or "Jane Doe is wondering what to do with all
of this champagne and bubble bath ..." Just post

and wait for interested parties to offer themselves up
like sacrificial lambs for your prurient pleasures.
Message: Unlike the wall, the message is personal and
private. Sending one instead of wall posting says that
you're interested in being intimate. Moving away from
the public realm also allows for naughtier conversa
tions, safe from the prying eyes of curious wall-stalkers.
Secrecy is so much sexier, don't you think?
