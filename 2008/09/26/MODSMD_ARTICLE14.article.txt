a We just wanted to make a Ben Braddock for 2008," said Danny Jacobs '01, co
writer/director of "Humboldt County," citing Dustin Hoffman's infamous character in
"The Graduate."
"Except that while Ben Braddock was just kind of a regular guy that laid out by the
pool all day and let life pass him by," Braddock continued, "it seems like today's kinds of regu
lar guys are making to-do lists that outline the next ten years of their lives, getting three grad
uate degrees before they have a clue what they the hell really like to do and sprinting on the
hamster wheel just to keep it from stopping."
Jacobs' Braddock is Peter (Jeremy Strong), a medical student whose intense under
standing of his textbooks but severe lack of feeling, compassion and empathy lead his profes
sor (who also happens to be his father) to fail him on the eve of his acceptance into an
unnamed dream medical residency.
Disenchanted, Peter acts on a whim and has a one night stand with a mysterious
actress/musician named Bogart (Fairuza Balk), and before he knows it he's swept away from
hazy Los Angeles to the enchanting world of Humboldt County, where he quickly learns what
it's like to live "off the grid" when he falls in with an eclectic clan of self-sustaining pot farm
ers.
"Humboldt County" is a film of moments, filled with wonderful dialogue and set
pieces that take us in a great many directions but never quite come together the way we want
them to. In spite of its imperfections, the film announces the debut of two major new writ
ing/directing talents: Jacobs and his co-writer/director Darren Grodsky, who graduated from
Northwestern in 2001. In discussing the film on Wednesday night in Cubberley Auditorium,
both men spoke extensively about hunger — the kind of raw desire that one could only
expect from two kids with social science (yes, not film) degrees from dorky schools that all of
a sudden found themselves with a fresh, inventive script at their fingertips and around a mil
lion dollars of other people's money to shoot it with.
The film, set against the gorgeous backdrop of Humboldt County and the Lost Coast
of Northern California, positively radiates this hunger — it is shot to impress (and almost
constantly does), both with the built-in arresting beauty of the location and with several
superbly-delivered supporting performances.
Francis Conroy and Brad Dourif are stellar as Jack and Rosie, the grandparents of
not only their own family but, metaphorically, virtually the entire world we're introduced to
at the Lost Coast. Jack, a UCLA physicist who left his professorship and moved to Humboldt

"so I wouldn't lose my soul," speaks often
of the county as an alternate universe, or
even more specifically as a black hole,
with a clearly defined event horizon, a
"point of no return."
This theme is particularly reso
nant with Peter, whose strong adherence
to the rules and conventions of pursuing a
medical degree despite his obvious lack of
desire bears more than a passing resem
blance to any number of people Jacobs
and Grodsky came across at Stanford and
Northwestern. He slowly finds himself
pulled into this world of people who seem
to live without rules — any of the rules
that have governed his own life yet seem

much closer to self actualization than he ever has.
Even after the film has taken great pains to derail this Utopian vision and presents
the true difficulties of the pot farmers, these naked emotional moments centered on charac
ters hell-bent on living against the grain of society continue to ring true even as their plausi
bility (and at times even their continuity) becomes questionable.
"Humboldt County" is not a film without its flaws, but it radiates such youth, pas
sion and freshness that these problems often are easy to overlook. The film's mistakes — the
melodrama of certain scenes, as well as the darting narratives that take the time to surprise,
innovating in certain places while operating all too briefly and counting on the audience's
knowledge of filmic and narrative conventions at others — are mistakes made aggressively,
faux pas committed almost entirely out of a desire to move the audience deeply, even if some
of these attempts are out of the film's (and perhaps still the filmmakers') reach.
lacobs left Stanford in 2001 with a degree in International Relations and a transcript
packed haphazardly with drama courses. He returned seven years later with an imperfect fea
ture film that is nonetheless a feature film — no small feat for someone who'd never shot a
picture before. He and his writing partner Grodsky have certainly logged an impressive debut
here, and one can only hope that "Humboldt County" will only mark the beginning of their
