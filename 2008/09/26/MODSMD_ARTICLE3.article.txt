Ashling Loh Doyle

cc have always liked paper," said Ashling Loh-
Doyle '10, the founder of Lotus & Ash, a sta
tionery and design firm, who is also the cre-

ative mind behind Intermission's updated style.
"It's a designer's dream to take an application and completely redesign it," Loh-Doyle
said of her work with The Daily's arts and style magazine. "We created a look for Intermission."
The new design concept, based on circular elements, is "much cooler," according to the
graphic designer who has a specialty in print design. "It is a more simple design than it was
before," she added.
Redesigning Intermission is only one of many projects for Loh-Doyle, who started
Lotus & Ash last summer, the company she described as "custom, classic and contemporary."
"I am interested in preserving traditional forms of stationery and communication
while also realizing that the Internet is the future," Loh-Doyle said of her work. "My heart,"
however, "will always be in paper and stationary."
"I would rather play with paper than go to sleep," she responded when asked how she
balances paper design with school and fun. "Paper is something that I love so much that I just
naturally stay up" when designing late into the night.
Loh-Doyle's love of paper dates back to her first Christmas, when she was more inter
ested in the wrapping paper than the gifts they covered.
"I've been naturally gravitating toward it since then," she said.

While in high school, Loh-
Doylc shifted gears from writing for the
newspaper to working on layout and
design for many school publications.
During those years, she also created
Shlingbees, her first stationery compa
ny. Paper and design were such impor
tant elements of her life that Loh-Doyle
even wrote her Stanford admission
essay on stationery.
At Stanford, Loh-Doyle's work
can be found across campus. She
designs for various student groups and
academic departments and has hopes
of acquiring a letter press in the future
to further develop her business.

"I only hope that this is something I can do for the rest of my life," she said.
