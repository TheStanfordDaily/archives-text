# Fall's must-sees from film buff Leonard Maltin
## 
### 
Summers are all about blockbusters. For students, this is
a time when we can kick back and watch films filled
with eye-popping explosions and nonsensical jokes —
intellectual consequences be damned. However, with the
advent of fall upon us, it's time to look for a new slate of
visual stimulations. Of course, this is easier said than done,
and very few have the time and energy to follow all things
Hollywood, especially when you are taking 20 units.
To aid in this endeavor, Intermission enlisted the
help of famed film critic Leonard Maltin to get the inside
scoop. Leonard is most known for his Leonard's Movie Guid<
books, a compendium of movie synopses, and has held such
positions as the president of the Los Angeles Film Critics
Association and an advisory board member of the
Hollywood Entertainment Museum.
Leonard's Picks
1 asked Leonard what he thought were some good films to
look out for this season, and in no particular order, here are
some of the movies that he has given his nod of approval.
Miracle at St. Anna
Director: Spike Lee
Release Date: 9/26/08
From critically acclaimed director Spike Lee, "Miracle at St.
Anna" tells the story of four black soldiers trapped in a tiny,
hilltop Tuscan town that is massacred during World War 11.
With Spike Lee behind the helm, you can expect plenty of
dramatic tension mixed with thought-provoking racial
themes in this heavy war flick.
Burn After Reading
Directors: Ethan and loel Coen
Release Date: 9/12/08

After making big splashes at both the Venice and Toronto
film festivals, the Oscar-winning Coen Brothers land another
hit with their latest outing — a spy/thriller/comedy about
two gym members that stumble upon a CIA agent's secret
memoirs. Did we mention that its cast includes the likes of
Brad Pitt, George Clooney and John Malkovich?
Vicky Christina Barcelona
Director: Woody Allen
Release Date: 8/15/08
Although released over a month ago, this indie film has prob
ably gone unnoticed by your typical college student, especial
ly when eclipsed by the likes of "Tropic Thunder" and "Dark
Knight." Here, two girlfriends go on a vacation to Barcelona
and enter a love triangle with a painter, played by lavier
Bardcm. Then, in true Woody Allen fashion, things become
complicated when Bardem's ex-wife, played by Penelope
Cruz, enters the picture. Expect intricate yet devious relation
ships to develop in this romantic drama.
Happy-Go-Lucky
Director: Mike Leigh
Release Date: 10/8/08
If you're looking for the feel-good movie of the season, then
"Happy-Go-Lucky" is a sure bet. Filled with delightful British
wit and charm, this story revolves around a ridiculously
cheerful and optimistic schoolteacher, and how her outlook
on life affects those around her. This film has already blown
up on the film festival circuit. Be sure to check your local art
house theaters for this one!
Towclhead
Director: Alan Ball
Release Date: 9/12/08

Based off of the popular novel of the same name,
"Towelhead" offers a smart and mature look into the life of a
teenaged Arab-American girl as she comes to grips with her
adolescence and sexuality. This is family drama and teenage
"angst" at its best.
A Movie for Everyone
Looking at the above-mentioned list of movies, it is
pretty easy to see why Maltin would recommend these
films to us college kids. There is something for every
one in this list: action, drama, romance, comedy and feel
good feelings. To add that cherry on top, these films are also
deeply intricate, original and thought provoking. Movies are
always better when you can discuss them with your dorm
mates at the end of the day.
Of course everyone has different tastes in movies,
and after reading Maltin's list 1 am sure that there are some
out there saying, "Well 1 don't want to just see artsy, indie
films. What about my blockbusters?" Thankfully there are
still plenty of big names coming to theaters this fall: "The
Spirit," based off of Frank Miller's graphic novel; "Twilight," a
teenage vampire movie based off of the popular books; the
much-anticipated James Bond sequel "Quantum of Solace";
and even "High School Musical 3" (Who can ever get tired of
Zac Efron?).
A new school year means a new wave of movies.
Whether you choose to watch a film in a multiplex or an art
house theatre, there are definitely plenty of options.
Hopefully this guide will make it easier for you to choose
what movie to watch next, unlike having to choose which
classes you'll need to take this quarter ...
