# Stock your closet with muted tones, florals and leather for fall
## 
### 
September — a great month for fashion. On runways and showrooms in New York,
London, Milan and Paris, designers are revealing their new looks for this season. And
whilst the price tags on those clothes might be steep and not fit for the average college
student, Intermission will show you how you can still come back to school in style, without
blowing a year's worth of Stanford tuition.
Before you start your shopping quest, first become acquainted with this season's
trends. If you have no idea where to start, that's okay — we have a breakdown.
Katie Fogelsong'o7, a shopping aficionado and representative ofWearlt.com, an
online startup dedicated to fashion, recommends these fall colors: berry, burnt orange, mus
tard yellow, neutrals and of course the color that's always in season: black.
In addition to fall colors, stores are stocked for autumn with a large volume of floral
print tops and dresses. This is not a coincidence: Fall florals and fluttery silks are two com
mon themes this season. Also omnipresent are feathers, fringe, faux, lace and a variety of tex
tures and overlays on a variety of pieces, especially dresses.
And, if you think you can pull off the grunge biker-chick look, leather jackets and
latex leggings/leather pants are very sexy. Be ready to invest, though: a high-quality leather
jacket, such as one designed by Rick Owens or Mike & Chris, can range from $800 to over
$1000.
As for shoes, expect to sec trendy boots in a wide color palette. If you found the san
dal boot or the peep-toe ankle boot a little odd, get used to them — they'll be around at least
for a little while more. Then there's the classic pump, reinvented again and again by Christian
Louboutin. Manolo Blahnik and Jimmy Choo are also re-defining the pump by adding detail
such as studs, ribbons, crystals and buckles. Louboutin in particular can make a pair of bor
ing pumps look fresh, exciting and sexy.
But of course, knowing what's in fashion doesn't necessarily make shopping any eas
ier, especially if those trends don't ring true with your personal style. Regardless of what's
"in," you should define your own look: Pick the trends that you like, and interpret those
trends in your own way — whether you're chic, artsy, vintage, sporty, trendy or classic.
To seek out clothes that arc off-the-rack, personal and unique, shoppers are looking
more and more to online outlets. Shopping online has been on the increase; many retail web
sites now offer free shipping and returns, which saves time and money spent on gas going to
the mall. Many online retailers have year-round sales. Many Stanford students, especially
those that don't have cars, are already fans of online shopping.
To serve such an online shopping public, Fogelsong, along with a troupe of female
Stanford alumni, launched in true entrepreneurial spirit the shopping website Wearlt.com,
which helps women locate clothes and accessories — along with related coupons or discounts
— on a variety of retail websites. Wearlt.com lets women search for items from merchants
such as Bloomingdale's, Gap, Liz Claiborne, Silks Fifth Avenue, Net-A-Porter.com and
numerous others.
From her start-up experience and through her work with college shoppers,

IFogclsong has advice of her own to impart to shoppers this season:
"Because of the subprime mortgage crisis, we've found that shoppers are buying
more accessories rather than brand new wardrobes," Fogclsong said. "It's a more lrugal way to
spice up last year's clothes."
But for those who can afford to splurge, Fogelsong said Net-A-Porter.com is a great
place to find fresh runway looks. Fashion-forward shoppers will find their favorite clothes,
bags and shoes separated by designer. Net-A-Porter also has a section devoted to "style fix,"
where shoppers will find clothing recommendations for events such as weddings and black-tie
Fogelsong also recommends Shopbop.com, a trendy and youthful shopping website
which is more geared toward college students. Shopbop carries a wide range of designers,
from New York-based Alice + Olivia to Sienna Miller's TwentySTwelve line.
"If you're on a tight budget, invest in pieces deriving from multiple styles that can
meet multiple scenes," she said. "Classic and transition pieces should serve you all day, from
daytime work to the nighttime social scene."
