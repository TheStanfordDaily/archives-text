# PARTY ON THE EDGE
## 
### 
Next Thursday from 9 p.m. until midnight, the Cantor
Arts Center will host its annual Party on the Edge, a
kickoff for arts events at Stanford and a showcase of
student artwork made possible by Associated Students of
Stanford University (ASSU) Arts Grants.
"I've had the party described to me as not your typi
cal museum night," said Kristen Olson, Cantor's educational
services coordinator. "You have all the art on the walls, but
also a lot of student involvement in making the party happen
from an entertainment standpoint."
Suspended in 2006 due to lack of funding, the Arts
Grants encouraged student involvement this year by funding
the projects of 17 students from a pool of 52 applicants.
"This year we're proud to bring back the Arts Grants
artists," Olson said. "The students received grants through the
ASSU to create art over the summer, and it's debuting at the
museum that night. We're going to be displaying that in the
inner courtyard."
Partygoers can see their peers' artwork and watch student

films and performances by student dance and musical
groups — not to mention chow down on food provided
by the museum.
"The churros are back!" Olson said.
Throughout the night, students can sign up for
a free membership at the museum and browse the muse
um's regular exhibits — all of which will be open except
for the Rodin and Ancient Mediterranean galleries,
which are closed for reinstallation.
According to Olson, the party serves as a fall
arts kickoff for the Stanford community.

"I think Stanford's going through something of
an arts renaissance right now," she said. "It's energizing
the arts, getting us excited about creating art and looking
at art, not just focusing on things that aren't art related."
"We don't show student artwork traditionally in the
museum — we don't want to favor one student artist over the
other," she continued. "ASSU Arts Grants are a wonderful
thing. We're happy to be a part of that."
"I've heard a lot about the projects, and they just
sound really fun and great," she added, mentioning in partic
ular a fountain, a mobile and a dance piece designed by stu
dents. "I'm really excited to see the finished product."
Jimmy Chion '10 was among those selected — his project will
be on display at Party on the Edge.
"I'm building a large mobile of individually hanging objects
that make up a human brain," he wrote in an email to
Intermission. "So for example, where the hippocampus is
located — the part of the brain central to memory formation
— there are suspended forms of data storage such as cds, cas
settes, photographs, journal, etc."
"My objective is to make it as least abstract as possible, and
for it to be a learning experience for everyone who sees it,"he
added. "This project is aimed to provide a 3D, visually
appealing, simplified functional mapping of the human brain
using mundane objects."
Chion said that his inspiration "came from mobile installa
tion artists Ralph Helmick and Stuart Schecter, particularly
their commissioned piece called Rara Avis in Chicago's
Midway airport. The piece is a very large bird made up of
tiny cast-iron sculptures of different forms of man-made

* flight,
such as

fighter jets,

747 sand hot air balloons."
"The project has pretty much

112 engrossed my entire summer, which is
great," he added. "It's one thing to have

W ideas, but to actually get funding to make
one idea into a huge 14' x 9' installation is a

once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for people like me, who don't
plan to be a professional artist, but want to create art never
theless. If I knew I could get funding like this for life, I'd
spend every summer on similar art projects."
Olson named three organizations that have been
central in this development — the Arts Initiative, the
Institute for Creativity in the Arts (SICA), and the Student
Organizing Committee for the Arts (SOCA).
"With the museum, this is creating such a strong arts com
munity on campus," she said.
This year's party represents the tenth anniversary of
the museum's reopening after 1989's Loma Prieta
Earthquake.
"We reopened in January 1999"0150n explained.
"We threw lots of parties that year — Party on the Edge was
to thank students for coming back."
"It's edgy because we are on the edge of campus,
and that's where the name came from," she added. "We're a
little bit outside the normal footpath. But come over and
we'll throw a party for you!"
