# OUR FAMILY TREE
## putting your dysfunctional family to shame... 
### 
The Tree has long been a notorious symbol of Stanford, prominently dis
played on the sidelines of games, in halftime shows at various athletic
events and occasionally making national news for its funky antics.
Although for many the Tree has always symbolized Stanford and repre
sented the fighting Cardinal, the Tree isn't actually (he University mascot at all.
From 1930 to 1972, the official mascot was the Indian. In 1972, however, after
discussions with the Native American community at Stanford, the University
decided it was time for a new mascot.
Multiple other options were suggested by the student body, including
the Robber Barons, the Thunder Chickens, the Sequoias, the Trees, the
Cardinals, the Railroaders, the Spikes, the Huns and the Griffins — but none
were accepted by the University.
In the meantime, the Band was testing out a few ideas of its own, such
as the Steaming Manhole, the French Fry and the Tree. While the University ulti
mately decided to return to its nickname since its founding in 1891, the
Cardinal, the Tree had received such popular support that the band decided to
keep it around. And thus the Tree was born, as the unofficial Band mascot, in
1975.
For several years, the position of Tree was taken lightly. But in the mid
1980s the Band decided to make the position more official, creating Tree
Tryouts. Today, over 20 years later, Tree Tryouts still exist, lasting a little more
than a week and taking place during winter/sping quarter. They involve various
stunts, both dangerous and ridiculous, petty bribery and interviews with the
Tree Selection Committee.
The new Tree is named shortly after tryouts and begins his tenure in
spring quarter, under the guidance of the previous Tree. Each Tree then creates
his own tree costume during the summer and reveals it during NSO the follow
ing fall.
The Tree is usually a redwood, representative of El Palo Alto, but there
have been a few palm trees over the years as well. In the last two decades, the
costume has generally covered all but the lower legs, and featured eyes and a big
grin — though that is where the similarities have ended.
Each Tree has brought something unique to their costume. There have
been a few with red and white hats, the occasional goofy tongue and even one
Tree tongue ring. There has even been a tree costume that was "female," with
blue eyes and long eyelashes.
In recent years, the Tree has most commonly been constructed on a
backpack frame with horizontal hula-hoops attached to provide the structure —
also allowing for lots of free movement. The hoops are covered in solid fabric,
decorated with faces and leaves.

Tommy Leep '06 was the
Tree in 06-07. He created one of the
few palm trees, following what he
called a "proud history of palm
trees."
"Everywhere I lived, there
has always been a palm tree right
outside my window," Leep said. "The
palm tree followed me around and
inspired me, from Stanford to
Canada, Tanzania and Milwaukee.
There has always been a palm tree,
kind of like fate."
Leep liked the idea of creat
ing a palm tree because it allowed
his costume to have a different
mechanical feel.
"The palm design is slim
down the middle but crazy up top,
which in many ways describes me as
well," he said.
Former Tree for the 04-05
year, Isaac Salier-Hellendag'os had a
different approach. His tree was the
more traditional redwood, but he
created reversible leaves, allowing his

tree to be either green or red.
"1 made my costume
reversible because it had never been
done, and because it would be some
thing that people would immediately
notice and remember," Salier-
Hellendag said. "I reversed it at the
halftime of three football games,
including Big Game in Berkeley."
While Leep went for a
loose, funky feel, Salier-Hellendag
preferred a more solid structure.
"You design with convic
tion and build with one central phi
losophy," he said. His tree was con
structed from steel, aluminum, plas
tic, foam, fabric and velcro.
Another former Tree, Alex
Smith *02, who served as Tree from
in 00-01, had a slightly different
concern when designing her tree.
"The design needed to be take
apartable as I made it in England
then shipped it over," Smith said.
Smith also created a unique tree in
that she used bright green tutu net
ting to cover her tree, because
she "wanted it to look girlie."
The latest Tree, Patrick
"Patches" Fortune '09, unveiled
his tree at the San Jose State

football game. It is constructed from
fiberglass hoops, aluminum, steel,
nylon fibers, glass fibers and spit —
with a little glitter thrown in.
"The frame was created
using aluminum tubing," Fortune
said. "1 bribed a company who
designs tanks to help with the weld
ing . . . yielding a strong and light
weight frame."

ABOVE: Alex Newell '02 was the Tree in 00-
01. She created a female tree, with blue
eyes, long lashes and pink lips. Her tree is
also distinctive for its fluffy, downy appear
ance created with tutu fabric.

by hand on a sewing machine and
Fortune now considers himself a
professional, with two sewing
machines on hand for repairs. He
plans for his tree to be continually
varying with different heights, styles,
moods, and rally gear.
"The tree costume will be constantly
changing and evolving throughout
the year, never a completed project,"
said Fortune.
Fortune does plan to keep his tree as
a Cyclops for a while after being crit

icized for this stylistic decision at the
game, even though it was originally
an accident.
"I had two eyes, but it was too heavy
for the aerodynamics so 1 could only
used one," said Fortune.
When asked about his recent experi
ences with the Mascot Flail of Fame,
Fortune is quick to differentiate
between himself and the other mas
cots he spent time with, although he
enjoyed the experience.
"I found out what a real mascot was,
and whatever they are, 1 am not,"
said Fortune. "They put on these
costumes and they stop talking, they
become these actors, these charac
ters. I am not an actor, 1 am just a
real person who puts on this cos
tume."

spring quarter, under the guidance of the previous Tree. Each Tree then creates
his own tree costume during the summer and reveals it during NSO the follow
ing fall.
The Tree is usually a redwood, representative of El Palo Alto, but there
have been a few palm trees over the years as well. In the last two decades, the
costume has generally covered all but the lower legs, and featured eyes and a big
grin — though that is where the similarities have ended.
Each Tree has brought something unique to their costume. There have
been a few with red and white hats, the occasional goofy tongue and even one
Tree tongue ring. There has even been a tree costume that was "female," with
blue eyes and long eyelashes.
In recent years, the Tree has most commonly been constructed on a
backpack frame with horizontal hula-hoops attached to provide the structure —
also allowing for lots of free movement. The hoops are covered in solid fabric,
decorated with faces and leaves.

Tommy Leep '06 was the
Tree in 06-07. He created one of the
few palm trees, following what he
called a "proud history of palm
trees."
"Everywhere I lived, there
has always been a palm tree right
outside my window," Leep said. "The
palm tree followed me around and
inspired me, from Stanford to
Canada, Tanzania and Milwaukee.
There has always been a palm tree,
kind of like fate."
Leep liked the idea of creat
ing a palm tree because it allowed
his costume to have a different
mechanical feel.
"The palm design is slim
down the middle but crazy up top,
which in many ways describes me as
well," he said.
Former Tree for the 04-05
year, Isaac Salier-Hellendag'os had a
different approach. His tree was the
more traditional redwood, but he
created reversible leaves, allowing his

tree to be either green or red.
"1 made my costume
reversible because it had never been
done, and because it would be some
thing that people would immediately
notice and remember," Salier-
Hellendag said. "I reversed it at the
halftime of three football games,
including Big Game in Berkeley."
While Leep went for a
loose, funky feel, Salier-Hellendag
preferred a more solid structure.
"You design with convic
tion and build with one central phi
losophy," he said. His tree was con
structed from steel, aluminum, plas
tic, foam, fabric and velcro.
Another former Tree, Alex
Smith *02, who served as Tree from
in 00-01, had a slightly different
concern when designing her tree.
"The design needed to be take
apartable as I made it in England
then shipped it over," Smith said.
Smith also created a unique tree in
that she used bright green tutu net
ting to cover her tree, because
she "wanted it to look girlie."
The latest Tree, Patrick
"Patches" Fortune '09, unveiled
his tree at the San Jose State

football game. It is constructed from
fiberglass hoops, aluminum, steel,
nylon fibers, glass fibers and spit —
with a little glitter thrown in.
"The frame was created
using aluminum tubing," Fortune
said. "1 bribed a company who
designs tanks to help with the weld
ing . . . yielding a strong and light
weight frame."

THE LEAVES
ABOVE: Alex Newell '02 was the Tree in 00-
01. She created a female tree, with blue
eyes, long lashes and pink lips. Her tree is
also distinctive for its fluffy, downy appear
ance created with tutu fabric.

All of the decorative work was done
by hand on a sewing machine and
Fortune now considers himself a
professional, with two sewing
machines on hand for repairs. He
plans for his tree to be continually
varying with different heights, styles,
moods, and rally gear.
"The tree costume will be constantly
changing and evolving throughout
the year, never a completed project,"
said Fortune.
Fortune does plan to keep his tree as
a Cyclops for a while after being crit

icized for this stylistic decision at the
game, even though it was originally
an accident.
"I had two eyes, but it was too heavy
for the aerodynamics so 1 could only
used one," said Fortune.
When asked about his recent experi
ences with the Mascot Flail of Fame,
Fortune is quick to differentiate
between himself and the other mas
cots he spent time with, although he
enjoyed the experience.
"I found out what a real mascot was,
and whatever they are, 1 am not,"
said Fortune. "They put on these
costumes and they stop talking, they
become these actors, these charac
ters. I am not an actor, 1 am just a
real person who puts on this cos
tume."

THE FACE
ABOVE Greg Siegel was the Tree in 92-93. His redwood was
constructed from one flat bolt of fabric and had boggle eyes
and a giant grin, complete with jagged, crooked teeth to
give it a crazy appearance.




ABOVE RIGHT: Tommy Leep '06 was the Tree in 06-07. He diverted from the
redwood tradition to create a tan palm tree with crazy fronds and a huge grin that stands out
when seen next to other trees.
