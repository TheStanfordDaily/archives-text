## Back from Iraq: "The Lucky Ones" tells the story of soldiers at home 
### 
CC The Lucky Ones" opens with heavily outfitted American
soldiers jammed into a Humvee, traveling down a desert
road. It's a part of the visual vocabulary of dramatizing
war; there were young soldiers packed into troop ships dur
ing World War II and hanging on to helicopters during
Vietnam. Unlike the nervous anticipation and manic confi
dence of its predecessors, however, this image evokes only
dread. You can expect to see it as a staple of Iraq War films
for years to come.
That's all we get of the war itself in Neil Burger's
"The Lucky Ones." However, we're thrown from the
inevitable explosion into the logistics of international travel
when three injured soldiers get acquainted on their plane
flight home. Arriving in New York, they're greeted with the
news that a blackout has scrambled their connecting flights.
Older reservist Fred Cheaver (Tim Robbins) wants
no part of an extended stay at the airport, and he rents a car
to drive the rest of the way home to St. Louis. Private Colee
Dunn (Rachel McAdams) and Sergeant T.K. Poole (Michael
Pena), both headed even further west, decide to tag along.
Poole, injured in the groin in the opening scene,
plans to visit Las Vegas, ensuring that he can perform up to
standards before re-connecting with his fiance. Dunn, injured
in her leg, wants to bring a guitar back to the family of a sol
dier she served with, who died saving her life. Both of them
are only on a month's leave, but Cheaver's tour is over, and he
only wants to get home to his family. Their combined efforts
meet with varied results as they head off into a classic road
movie premise.
Burger previously worked on 2006's "The
Illusionist," and he continues to display a fine visual eye. Less
fortunately, he also continues to show a deep inconsistency in
concern and attention, realizing some aspects of the movie
with eminent good sense while showing a great lack of care
in other regards. Annoyingly, "The Lucky Ones" abounds in

Intermission film critic Eric Messinger
caught up by phone with the director, Neil
Burger — while he was trapped, appropri
ately, in a New York bus station — to talk
about what he describes as "not a war
movie, but an American movie."
Intermission: Why make a movie about
soldiers at home instead of soldiers at war?
Neil Burger: Because to me, I think what
ever war is going on is just a symptom of
whatever is going in our culture. I was
interested in taking the temperature of the
times. What better way to look at what's
going on in America then to take some
people who have been overseas, and to

details that confound
immersion into a
believable world.
Characters' plans meet
with success on an
arbitrary basis, and the
connections are lazy;
too many numbers line
up near or at $20,000,
for one. The film has

send them across the country?
i: How much did the project appeal to you
coming off of "The Illusionist?" [Burger's
last, Oscar-nominated film, a period piece
about a magician in pre-World War 1
Vienna.]
NB: Well, I like "The Illusionist," and even
though 1 really like these gothic mysteries,
as a filmmaker you do want to speak to
your times. And while this film couldn't be
more different from"The Illusionist,"
there are a lot of shared ideas — topics
about truth, lies and faith, and powerless
people looking to make their way.
i: The war itself isn't mentioned all that
much. There's a scene at a party, and some
recollections of the soldiers' experiences,
and that's about it. Were you trying to
keep that restrained?
NB: There are two reasons. We talked to a
lot of soldiers, and (when they're on leave,
as the characters are] they're not interested

more allegiance to convenience than to plausibility.
Thankfully, nothing in the storytelling proves fatal to his
efforts, a pleasant change from "Stop-Loss," the last film to
send Iraq veterans on car trips across America. Burger errs by
realizing serviceable ideas in lazy ways, rather than in careful
ly executing horrible concepts.
Much more problematic is his use of Pena's talents.
Burger wants T.K. to be a quietly confident character, but the
writing plays into Pena's tendency to keep emotions too
much in reserve. It's never clear if the character's wooden
portrayal is a deliberate but overdone attempt at expressing
his troubles and a resulting aloofness, or if it's simply an
oversight in matching actor to character in stimulating ways.
That we get only one scene with T.K. prior to his injury does
n't help with the ambiguity. It's a particular shame because
Peria is a legitimate force when directors know how to use
him (sec his stand-out performance in "Crash"). It's also baf
fling because Burger deftly plays to the strengths of McAdams
and Robbins in creating their more compelling characters.
After his time at war, Cheaver's re-entry into the
world provides for both wry amusement and lumbering awk
wardness, and Robbins brings both to life. Burger uses
Robbins' natural height to loom over the other actors, confi
dent in his own skin but making his very surroundings
uncomfortable.

Colee is even more inter
esting. Her demeanor
appears naive at first, but
she is never helpless or
wilting. She comes off as
genuinely good-hearted,
and admiration for the
way she handles complex
situations and difficult
people only grows as the
film progresses. It's a
charming role and the

in talking about their experiences. They're
trying to have a good time. They're trying
to find a woman, or if they're a woman
they're trying to find a man, or they're
looking for a party.
The second reason is that, this film is
much more about America now, and I
wanted to keep the focus on that.
i: The film is within the very classic "road
movie" genre. Yet it is also touching on a
lot of contemporary concerns. Was that
difficult to make that work, working in a
very traditional form but with a lot of
immediate material?
NB: Yeah, it's a classic road movie. But in a
way, most citizens in this country are in
their own little movie every day, just on
their morning commute. And these char
acters are going from New York to St.
Louis and on to Las Vegas, and trying to
get there very quickly, so they're taking the
interstates. And that's somewhat where a

film makes you root for her throughout. These two perform
ances carry the film.
"The Lucky Ones" is a promising effort rather than a
full success. Nonetheless, it provides an empathetic and
understated take on soldiers returning stateside. "The Lucky
Ones" does not transcend flaw or formula, but it contributes
two or three great memorable characters to the year's roster,
and tells their stories in a winning manner. It's not all it could
have been, but it's enough.

lot of the country is, and we're taking that
journey with them. They're stopping to eat
at the same McDonald's.
i: On to a geeky issue. I heard you guys
had a really cool camera rig to shoot the
driving scenes?
NB: Oh yeah. We had four minivans, and
one of them we built ourselves. We put a
precision driver on the roof, actually
mounted on the roof, and the driver could
drive the car. So we could really be on the
highway, and take the trip, and film it that
way. Otherwise, it's a really dangerous
proposition, with the actors trying to talk
and have conversations, and throw things
in the car, all at 65 miles per hour. But
with this, we were fine. The driver could
parallel park the car if he needed.
i: Was it difficult to shoot like that, on a
real highway?
NB: Oh my God, yes, it was a pain in the
ass. It it's a real take, and you're getting off
