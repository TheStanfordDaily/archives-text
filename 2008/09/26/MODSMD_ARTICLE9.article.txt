# treasure island festival in review
## 
### 
The Treasure Island Music Festival (TIMF) took place
last weekend, hoping to build on the expectations cre
ated by last year's highly successful inaugural event.
Situated on the man-made Treasure Island in the middle of
San Francisco Bay, this year's festival did not disappoint, pro
viding an eclectic mix of bands to satisfy any music taste. The
event promised two days of very different proportions.
Proving to be two very distinct musical experiences, Saturday
amounted to an event for the electronic lover while Sunday
was more for the indie rocker.
Die-hard music fans find festivals like these at times
unbearable, but Treasure Island provided various intangibles
that would have pleased the most difficult of concert-goers.
Indeed, while there were the masses of stoners, drunk frat
bros and elbowing scene girls (hoping to fight their way to
Tegan and Sara), TIMF delivered where it counted: music and
atmosphere. With a few exceptions, each act performed
admirably with as good of a sound you're going to get out
doors.
The festival's organizers, Noise Pop and Another
Planet, seemed to do all the little things right, from coordi
nating efficient transportation between the mainland and the
island to developing eco-friendly waste management policies.
Aside from the music, the message of the day was sustainabil
ity. With a solar-powered side stage, hundreds of compost
bins, prizes for those who recycled the most and volunteer
recyclers, TIMF organizers did everything in their power to
minimize the festival's ecological impact. The grounds were
kept relatively clean, and the sight of indie rockers digging
through trash and recycle bins was priceless.
The festival also featured an array of booths and
boutiques, offering a wide variety of entertaining activities
and comfortable lounging areas for those taking a break from
the music. Lines quickly formed in front of any booth offer
ing free merchandise, as well as the food stalls that charged
exorbitant amounts for small servings. Of course, the iconic
Ferris wheel also towered over the grounds, the San Francisco
skyline peeping from behind under a sunny autumn sky.
However, perhaps the best thing about TIMF was its
ability to stagger performances, allowing crowd members the
ability to travel between stages and see every act. Unlike
many festivals which force concert-goers into choices of who
to see and when to see them, TIMF organizers cleverly
arranged set times between the Tunnel (side) stage and
Bridge (main) stage to prevent the overlapping of sets.
Indeed, TIMF's smart set times was a commitment to music,
something every attendee could appreciate.
Saturday
Electronic was the label of the day on Saturday. With people
dancing for acts from Hot Chip to DJ Mike Relm, it was fit-

ting that the day ended with a performance of epic propor
tions by Justice.

Hot Chip
The sharply-dressed English quintet Hot Chip took the stage
in the late afternoon to an eager crowd ready to dance. In
spite of the wind, which at times affected their sound as well
as the occasional technical hiccup, Hot Chip made most of
their time on stage. The crowd seemed simply ready to dance
after being mostly quiet for Antibalas, who had come before
on the main stage. Perhaps what was most impressive about
Hot Chip was the relative ease by which they interchanged
instruments to reproduce and remix their songs. Each mem
ber managed to use a variety of instruments ranging from
guitars to keyboards to tomtoms, providing a unique sound
in songs like "Ready for the Floor" and "Over and Over."
Most impressively, lead singer Alexis Taylor's voice rarely fal
tered, providing a consistent, energetic sound throughout the
50-minute set.
TV On the Radio
While TV On the Radio was arguably the second major draw
in Saturday's line up, it must be said that they failed to live up
to expectation. Playing songs mainly off albums "Return to
Cookie Mountain" and "Dear Science," to be released
Tuesday, TV simply failed to spark the crowd, which was
more intent on keeping warm than paying attention. Lead
singer Tunde Adebimpe's constant questions of whether
"everyone was still ok" and if "they were enjoying the festival"
summed up the set, as he attempted to gauge the pulse of the
quiet crowd. As for the music itself, one could not help but
say it was below par. Known for impressive recordings and
shows, their sound simply was not made for an outdoor
stage, as a brass quartet (with members of Antibalas) clashed
with guitars, synths and anything else the band threw out.
Perhaps it was just an attempt of providing too much or the
adverse conditions. Whatever the reason, TV on the Radio
had a festival to forget.
Justice
What more could be said of Justice? This French duo is sim
ply made to perform at events like Treasure Island with its
attractive beats and high-energy sets. Armed with two sets of
stacked Marshall speakers and their familiar Cross platform,
Justice supplied a relentless attack on the ears of listeners who
gleefully moved for "Waters of Nazareth" and "Genesis."
Justice was by far the biggest attraction of the Saturday line
up, with many concertgoers foregoing the chance to see the
energetic CSS to camp for a spot in front of the Bridge Stage.
Many waited on their feet for upwards of an hour hoping to
protect their spots for what was to come. When the duo final

ly took the stage at 9:15 p.m., the boisterous crowd was treat
ed to a light spectacular with ever-present strobe lights, flash
ing speakers and glow sticks.
Visually, Justice was unmatched, as all eyes were
fixed on the bobbing, shaggy-haired DJs behind their glowing
crucifix. And while it is arguable if Christianity has had an
influence on electronic music, the crowd had no problem
holding up crossed arms to show their appreciation for
Gaspard Auge and Xavier de Rosnay. The crowd did every
thing to oblige their French hosts, jumping, clapping and
throwing their hands in the air with every electronic com
mand. Moreover, in spite of their reputation for being distant
and self-important, the two managed to celebrate with the
crowd, coming out from behind their cigarette smoke and
stereo stronghold to massive cheers.
It's not hard to see why Justice has transcended the
electronic barrier between clubs to large-scale concerts. By
providing the exact energy and chaos by mixing and mashing
samples and mainstream songs, Justice has become a main
stay in the electronic world. As the crowd went through the
unmistakable chant of "We are your friends, you'll never be
alone again," one could not help but notice the power and
influence of the French pair.
Sunday
Sunday's headliners, The Raconteurs, were preceded by a
handful of rock bands that gradually and continually
enlivened the audience toward the epic weekend's end.
Tokyo Police Club
The four Canadians comprising Tokyo Police Club (TPC)
gave life to Sunday's audience, despite the blistering sun that
shone down upon the main stage during the 1:55 p.m. set.
The boys were visibly excited in front of the first large crowd
of the day, kicking off the 40-minute set with "Graves," from
their most recent album, Elephant Shell. The set list also
straddled TPC's two LP's — A Lesson in Crime and Smith —
and the crowd took in every song as it leaped up and down to
the beat of Greg Alsop's drums. TPC kept the energy alive
with songs such as "In a Cave" and "Juno," and invoked audi
ence participation with songs such as "Citizens of
Tomorrow," "Nursery, Acadcmy" and "Nature of the
Experiment." Behind Dave Monks' vocals, keyboardist
Graham Wright pulled out a second tambourine for "Your
English is Good," rousing the audience to clap and shout
along. Only three years old (but no stranger to festivals), TPC
shared the crowd's enthusiasm for the weekend, evidenced by
Monks' bubbly comment, "We'll be back." The band ended its
set with their riff-infused "Be Good," pouring out enough
energy for Wright to knock his keyboard right off its stand as
the Canadian boys left the stage to a screaming crowd.
