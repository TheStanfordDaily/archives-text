Ihe Bard Graduate Center is a graduate research institute focused on studying the cultural jPiyfat,.. .f<'

history, economic and cultural history, history of technology, philosophy, anthropology
Our central project lias been to establish a coherent field of historical study that sees in the LJf\
material remains of the life of the past—from works of the greatest virtuosity to the eveiy-
day and ephemeral—a significant torm of social-, cultural-, and art-historical enquiry.
Students enrolled in the M.A. and Ph.D. programs work closely with a distinguished per
manent faculty of active scholars in exploring the interrelationships between works of art
and craft, design, places, ideas, and social and cultural practice in courses ranging from the \
Areas of Special Strength: Renaissance and Early Modern Studies; New York &
American Material Culture; Modern Design History; History and Theory of Museums;
Arts of Antiquity, Asia, and Islam.
Application deadline for full-time and part-time students is January 15, 2009. For more information:
