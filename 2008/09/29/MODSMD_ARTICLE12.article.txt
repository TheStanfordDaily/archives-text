## EDITOR'S WELCOME Alumni interviews a step in the right direction 
### 
The editorial board applauds the deci
sion of the Office of Undergraduate
Admission to begin a program pilot
ing the use of alumni interviews in the un
dergraduate admission process. As the num
ber of qualified applicants continues to rise,
personal interviews will be a valuable tool in
distinguishing the best candidates for admis
sion.
Last year, out of the 25,298 high school
seniors who applied to Stanford, only 9.5
percent were admitted. More than half of
the applicants had CPAs of 4.0 or above, and
similar percentages had phenomenal stan
dardized test scores. Although more subjec
tive factors such as letters of recommenda
tion and essays can help to find exceptional
candidates, at some point the paper applica
tion is a limited tool for comparison.
Personal interviews can assist the admis
sion process in several ways. First, interview
ers can evaluate the emotional intelligence
and interpersonal skills of the candidate, and
see him or her as a whole person beyond the
paper application. Second, the interviewer
can get a better sense of why the candidate
wants to attend Stanford: is there a specific
reason that the Farm would be a good fit, or
does the applicant just see it as another high
ranked school? Finally, when an interviewer
spots an especially desirable candidate, he or
she is in a better position to make a case for
why the student should choose Stanford. A
brochure can never be an adequate substi
tute for a personal story about the unique
benefits of a Stanford education.
The editorial board also supports the
structure of the pilot program. The cities
chosen to participate in the program — At
lanta, Denver. London, New York City,
Philadelphia and Portland — should pro
vide a diverse cross-section of applicants. We
look forward to the program's expansion
throughout the country, and hope that it will
someday serve applicants in regions from
which Stanford does not typically attract
large numbers of students.
As the pilot interviews begin, the admis

sions office should evaluate not only the
program as a whole, hut also its impact on
particular demographics. Perhaps the inter
views can be a way to attract exceptional ap
plicants from less privileged backgrounds
who might not always stand out on paper.

Personal interviews
will be a valuable tool
in distinguishing
the best candidates
for admission.

Using alumni as interviewers is not mere
ly the only feasible way to conduct such a
large interview process, hut it also allows
alumni to contribute to Stanford in a more
meaningful way than donating money. Lim
iting the role of the interviewer's report,
however, ensures that alumni do not become
"gatekeepers." Finally, having each alumni
volunteer conduct only three to five inter
views allows for truly personal evaluations.
There will continue to be talented and de
serving candidates that might not perform
well in an interview, and they should not be
disadvantaged. But with the right balance
and feedback, the editorial board believes
that the alumni interviews program can be a
major improvement to the admission
process. m
