# THIS STANFORD LIFE
## The 						Stanford Brand 
### 
This column originally ran on 14,2008.
For the better part of this summer. I've
worked at the Stanford Bookstore.
More specifically. I've worked in the
[Bookstore's official apparel section. You
know, that area on the second floor covered
with red and white sweatshirts as far as the
eye can see. (Seriously, if you want a red T
shirt, there is no better place in the Bay
Area.)
Most people would say that I am just a
"folder" or, at best, a "clerk." But I look at
myself as something much more: a "retail
ambassador." I sell not only fine cotton ap
parel manufactured in exotic places like
Honduras and Hong Kong. I also sell this
university.
The Stanford Bookstore, perhaps more
than anywhere else on campus, demon
strates that that our university sells itself as a
brand. This is not necessarily a bad thing—
we have a lot to sell to prospective students,
faculty and staff. But sometimes, after a few
hours of folding, deprived of natural light
and hydration, I imagine that I'm actually at
Abercrombie and Fitch. For a moment, all I
can see is the same logo in dozens of minor
variations, each piece of clothing supposedly
representing a lifestyle, promising to make
each owner more special and elite.
The majority of our summer status-seek
ers are tourists, summer camp kids and con
ference participants. The customers come in
looking to buy a little piece of Stanford's
enormously positive reputation. The cloth
ing itself sometimes get a mixed reaction—
"Do you have this in XXX-Large?,""ls this
fleece pull-over really worth $%?" or "Do
you have this particular logo, but on a dark
green, spandex jumpsuit?" On the other
hand, Stanford University itself is inevitably
treated with respect and enthusiasm.
Summer camp kids are the most eager to
buy into our brand. They shuttle in and out
of the store, Jamba Juices in hand, cliques in
chase. Sometimes they debate the finer
points between schools. ("USC is better at
film,"said one kid. while another kid skillful
ly replied "Yeah, but Stanford is Stanford.")
Sometimes they dream out loud about ap-

Pnul Craft

plying here. I've fielded dozens of detailed
questions about the admissions process. (I
think one camp attendee wanted me to write
him a recommendation.) All in all. Stan
ford's prospects look bright with the tween
and teen crowd.
Foreign tourists are also surprisingly
eager to buy into our brand. (Economically
speaking. with the weakness of the dollar, it
makes sense.) European visitors are more
frequent than expected, but they also man
age to restrain their enthusiasm. Most of
them shuffle in as a family or couple, poke
around and then leave. Chinese and Korean
tour groups, however, make a scene. They
tend to stream in as huge groups. First, they
thoroughly inspect the clothing, asking ques
tions about quality and size and maybe even
try to barter for a lower price. They often
seem to have not just a respect, but a rever
ence for our university.
Occasionally, this brand-reverence gets a
bit out of control. Once, a family was dis
cussing what to buy. Their little girl, who
looked about five, was playing nearby. ITie
father leaned down and said, "Do you want
this Stanford shirt, honey?" Suddenly look
ing up with elation the girl said, "Stanford!
Wow! Stanford!" When our brand resonates
with the preschool set. maybe we've gone
too far.
Even so, I am proud to be an apparel am
bassador. Watching all this, 1 can't help but
swell up with pride for our brand. I love
Stanford and the shoppers love Stanford—
we are both on the same page. (If anything, it
makes me want to start my own huge re
search university. Imagine all the "Paul
Craft"sweatshirts.Glorious.) Indeed. I often
picture Leland Stanford, Jr. standing in the
apparel section, looking out at all the cloth
ing in his honor. Somehow. I think he'd be
proud of our brand, too.

Paul is filled with so much Stan ford pride that
he might even begin selling knock-off versions
of official Stanford apparel. To offer funds for
his new business, or to cornijtent on this col
umn. please email Paul at pcraft@stanford. edu.
