The editorial "Applause for New Aid Pro
gram" (Sept. 24,2(X)8) rightly called on Stan
ford to continue taking steps to increase its fi
nancial aid expenditures. Such aid is necessary
because it makes Stanford more accessible to
students from lower income families.
In light of the University's $20.4 billion en
dowment (which thanks to John Powers' fi
nancial acumen appears capable of growth
even in down markets), providing additional
financial aid is also a moral obligation. Simply
put, Stanford — which does not pay taxes on
its endowment earnings — is sitting on too
much money to ask low- and middle-class
families to shell out tens of thousands of dol
lars each year for tuition. It is embarrassing
that the University finally decided to ease the
burden on needy students only after Congress
put pressure on wealthy universities to stop
hoarding money and start putting it to use or
risk losing their tax exempt status.
That said. I disagree with The Stanford
Daily's insistence that the University make fi
nancial aid need-blind for international stu

dents. Ultimately, the source of Stanford's fi
nancial aid is the I Jniversity's massive endow
ment. and this endowment is not taxed. What
this means is that American taxpayers allow
Stanford to forgo paying taxes on its endow
ment earnings — which for the past several
years have run into the billions of dollars —
because they believe the University provides a
service to the country. One need only look at
the life-saving medicines and computer tech
nologies developed in University labs to con
clude that Stanford does provide a service to
taxpayers.
While I applaud Stanford's commitment to
educating people from all over the world. I
wonder if the University is under obligation to
give the same amount of aid to a middle class
student from, say. Germany, as a middle class
student from say, Detroit, Michigan, when the
financial aid benefits the University doles out
are paid for, at least in part, by American tax
payers? Stanford — due to its tax-exempt sta
tus — has a responsibility to provide a service
to the country, and I'm not sure how

bankrolling the education of a student from
France with the intention of returning to
France after graduation helps the United
States.
An international student who intends to
stay in the country and/or provide a service
with the potential to assist American tax
payers may very well deserve the same fi
nancial aid as an American student, but sim
ply tossing international students under the
same financial aid blanket as American stu
dents — as The Stanford Daily's recent edi
torial suggested — ignores this important
distinction.
ITiere is no shortage of American students
who would jump at an opportunity to attend
Stanford with an appropriate financial aid
package. When such packages are made possi
ble. in part, by US. taxpayers, I think the Uni
versity has an obligation to show at least some
preference to Americans when it comes to
handing out financial aid.
