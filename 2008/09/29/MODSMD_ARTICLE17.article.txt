## Close is not enough for Cardinal Stanford can't convert in 1-0 loss to Broncos 
### JACOB JOHNSON DESK EDITOR 
Third time's (he charm.
At least that's what the Stanford
men's soccer team was hoping for
when it took on Santa Clara at home
last Saturday. Instead, they got
strike three. After dictating the pace
of the game against an aggressive
and talented Santa Clara squad, the
Cardinal lost 1-0 in overtime. The
win moved the Broncos to 2-4-2 on
the season and dropped Stanford to
2-4-1.
The game's only goal came in the
95th minute. After a scramble near
the left side of the Stanford goal, the
ball deflected out to Santa Clara's
Connor Mitchell, who fired a shot
from just outside the goalie box.The
ball sailed into the upper right cor
ner of the net to give the Broncos
the much-needed win.
"When he was about to shoot, a
player stepped in front of me, so I
was late to react." junior goalkeeper
John Moore said. "But it was a nice
shot to the far corner, give him cred
it for that."
Moore is allowing less than a goal
per game — including two shutouts
— and has played every minute of
the regular season thus far. He gives
much of the credit for his impressive
stats to the defense in front of him.
"I'm really proud of our de
fense," he said, after the Cardinal
held the Broncos to just three shots

on goal. "But if you leave the door
open long enough, they will step
through it."
Santa Clara was on its heels for
much of the game as Stanford was
able to dictate the pace and style of
play. Both teams had scoring oppor
tunities, but the Broncos converted
while Stanford could not.
"We hit the post a couple of times
and we missed open shots," Moore
said.
Late in the second half, junior
midfielder Thiago Sa Friere found
sophomore forward Bobby War
shaw on the Broncos' right post.
Warshaw double-clutched to elude
a defender and fired a shot with his
left foot, but the ball ricocheted off
the post. It was the last of many scor
ing threats from the Cardinal of
fense.
Senior co-captain T.J. Novak,cur
rently out of action with a hamstring
injury, had to watch from the side
lines as his team outplayed its oppo
nent but lost — again.
"We played well enough to win."
he said. "We created more danger
ous chances ... This was one of the
few times we've actually dominated
Santa Clara."
After three last-minute losses in
the same week, Saturday's game
could have been a back-breaker for
Stanford. But the players don't see it
that way — the team's confidence is
still high.
"It hurts no matter what," senior

midfielder Michael Alexander said.
"But a loss is a loss. We're taking it
one game at a time."
Stanford's 2-4-1 out-of-confer
ence record will not earn it a hid in
the NCAA Tournament. Now. the
only way in is to win the Pac-10 Con
ference championship. The added
pressure doesn't seem to be affect
ing the team's attitude, though.
"Yeah, we have to do well in the
Pac-10," Alexander said. "But there
are many games left to play."
The Cardinal did get some good
news this weekend, however:
Novak's hamstring injury is less se
vere than originally thought. If all
goes well, he could be back in two to

three weeks. After he suffered the
injury against Drake on Sept. 21,
doctors had said his season might be
over.
Novak admitted that sitting out is
"frustrating" for him. but he ex
pressed great confidence in his
team's ability to fill the void created
by his absence.
"Obviously you want to be out
there trying to help," he said. "But
we have a lot of very good players."
On Saturday, senior midfielder
Tom Montgomery took Novak's
spot at forward, while sophomore
Cameron Lamming filled in at mid
field.
"Cam played really well last

night," Novak said, adding that al
though Montgomery is "more com
fortable" at center-mid, he was an
effective replacement at forward.
The Stanford seniors are starting
to feel an extra sense of urgency for
next weekend's road trip to Wash
ington and Oregon State.
"Senior year, it's now or never,"
Alexander said.
When asked what the team needs
to do to start winning, his answer
was simple: "We've got to
score more."
