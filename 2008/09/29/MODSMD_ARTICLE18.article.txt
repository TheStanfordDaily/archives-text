# Volleyball takes care of business vs. Oregon schools
## 
### DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
This past weekend, the Stanford women's
volleyball team looked like the team that
made it to the last two national championship
games. The women opened their Pac-10 sea
son with two sweeps of the Oregon schools,
helped by a great offensive effort on both
nights.
On Friday night, the Cardinal dominated
Oregon State 25-16. 25-16. 25-23 in front of

over 2,200 fans. Senior Cynthia Barboza con
tinued her outstanding play with 15 kills and
a .462 hitting percentage. She also moved into
the top 10 on the all-time aces list when she
smacked her 104 th career ace in the second
set.
Sophomore Alix Klineman had 11 kills
and senior Foluke Akinradewo put down
eight kills at a .43K hitting percentage. Senior
Erin Waller also hit .444. helping the Cardinal
to its fifth straight match where it hit over .300
as a team.

In addition to its great offense, the defense
by Stanford (11-2, 2-0 Pac-10) was solid all
night, holding Oregon State's best hitter,
Rachel Rourke, to just three kills and a .235
hitting percentage. The women held the
Beavers to a futile .133 hitting percentage,
thanks to five team blocks.With the win, Sta
nford moved to 47-0 all-time against Oregon
State.
"We played very well in the first two
games," head coach John Dunning said.
"They upped their level in game three, but of
fensively we did a good job."
On Saturday night, the Cardinal faced the
nation's llth-ranked team. Oregon. The
Ducks had the best non-conference record in
the Pac-10, but were coming off a loss to Cal
ifornia the night before. Stanford contributed
to maintaining that trend, as the Cardinal eas
ily handled them in a 25-21,25-22,25-20 victo
ry-
Stanford was led by Klineman on the
night, who turned in 15 kills (seven of which
came in the third set) and seven digs. Barboza
continued her hot hand, knocking down 13
kills on 22 attempts for a season-best .545 hit
ting percentage.
Akinradewo chipped in seven kills and
three blocks. After a solo block in the first set.
she moved into sixth place on the Stanford
career blocks list, with 462 for her career.
The sets were all tight, with Oregon (11-3,
0-2 Pac-10) jumping out to early leads in the
first and the third. But Stanford would hold
strong, pounding kill after kill and taking ad
vantage of mistakes by the Ducks. Oregon hit
just .228 as a team on the night.
"The games were a little closer [than ver
sus Oregon State]," Dunning said. "[Kline
man and Barboza] are doing a really good
job. Our setters were getting them the ball."
The Ducks were led on the night by
Gorana Maricic and Heather Meyers, who
had 13 and 11 kills, respectively. TTie setter,
Nevena Djordjevic, had 35 assists.
Stanford hit nearly .400 on the night, ex
tending its streak of hitting above .300 to six
matches.
According to Dunning, both Oregon and
Oregon State have close to, if not the best
teams they have had in the history of their re
spective programs, so to go out and beat them
both was an impressive performance for the
Cardinal. But there are always improvements
to be made.
"We are going to focus on [our] defense
this week," Dunning said. "We need to keep
getting better in that area."
ITie Cardinal will need all the defense and
offense it has for this weekend's road trip.The
Stanford women will travel to Washington to
take on Washington State on Friday night and
No. 9 Washington on Saturday. Again, it is a
crucial road trip for the Cardinal, especially
the Saturday match against the always-talent
ed Huskies.
