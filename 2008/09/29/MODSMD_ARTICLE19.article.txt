## Red October for baseball 
### 
The final weekend of the 2008
MLB season did not disappoint.
Coming down to the last day,
two playoff spots were still up for
grabs — including the AL Central
title. But with most of the division
champs and wild cards already en
trenched, the playoffs are upon us, yes,
without the Yankees.
Granted, predictions are tough. If
we had gone with the preseason calls,
the Detroit Tigers and Seattle
Mariners would be jostling for the AL
pennant — instead the two are
dwelling at the bottom of the AL cel
lar, in for a long, cold winter.
At this point, numbers don't carry
as much meaning as team chemistry or
being in the midst of a hot streak at the
right time. Every team has endured a
grinding 162-game season, and it will
be something else that pushes them
over the top — be it the pressure of a
99-year title drought or a pesky Rally
Monkey.
That said, here are my predictions
for the upcoming playoffs.
AL Division Series #1 — Los Angeles
Angels of Anaheim vs. Boston Red
Sox
To put it simply, the Angels have
had the Sox's number all season, but
the Sox have crushed them in their last
two playoff meetings.
But this year looks to be quite dif
ferent. Ilie Angels enter the postsea
son with a healthy, well-rested roster,
including a rejuvenated Vladimir
Guerrero and newly acquired Mark
Teixeira.The Sox come in limping with
an ailing Mike Lowell and J.D. Drew.
And did I mention, no Manny
Ramirez?The Angels are too good this
year, especially with'home-field ad
vantage, and will finally exorcize thoir
playoff demons.
Angels advance 3-1.
AL Division Series #2 — Tampa Hay
Rays vs. Minnesota Twins/Chicago;
White Sox
In the AL Central, I expect the*
Twins to come out on top. especially]
with the White Sox needing two more)
wins to stay alive. However, if the Raysj
could hold off the defending champion-
Red Sox,they can pretty much hold ofn
anybody. The Rays have shown that'
despite their inexperience, they are)
ready to win now.
Rays advance 3-1.
INI. Division Series #I—Chicago.
Cubs vs. Los Angeles Dodgers
The Dodgers have yet to make it;
out of the first round in 20 years, and I>
expect it to stay that way. LA unfortu-'
nately draws the NL-best Cubs, and!
Chicago is too strong of a team to fal-J
ter now. ITiey possess one of the best'
starting rotations and a nearly un-'
touchable bullpen. ITirow in a consis--
tent lineup, and the Dodgers are in big!
danger of being swept once again. So|
much for a Freeway Series.
Cubs advance 3-0.
NL Division Series #2 — Philadelphia;
Phillies vs. Milwaukee Brewers
Both teams fought neck and neck!
for a playoff spot and unfortunately
have to face each other in the first*
round. I still can't believe the Brewers}
fired Ned Yost with 12 games left in the l
season and that definitely has to be!
bad karma points against Milwaukee.;
But with CC Sabathia and Ben Sheets!
pitching back-to-back in a short series,!
the Phillies don't stand a chance —'
that is unless karma comes back to!
beat the Brewers.
Brewers advance 3-1.
AL Championship Series — Los An-!
geles Angels of Anaheim vs. Tampa'
Bay Rays ,
What a match-up — the two best!
teams in the American League, pitting'
teacher against pupil, Mike Scioscia!
versus Joe Maddon. ITie two squads!
are built on the same principles of'
pitching and aggressive hitting. Mad-!
don learned the tricks of the trade
working under Scioscia, and the Rays)
have given the Angels fits the entire
season, leading the season series 6-3. 1
However, the Angels have home-field
advantage and with so much momen
tum and team chemistry (most since
2002), it'll be a Red October once
again in Anaheim.
Angels advance 4-3.
NL Championship Series — Chicago
Cubs vs. Milwaukee Brewers
Game 1: Sabathia vs. Zambrano.
Game 2: Sheets vs. Harden.These divi
sion rivals know each other well and
there's not much separating these two
teams. Who wins here? To tell you the
truth, just flip a coin. One thing,
though: The Cubs swing a better bat.
and they handed Sabathia one of his
only two losses in the National
League earlier this season. I'll have
to go with the Cubs — they're due,
and I think that karma will finally
get to the Brewers.
Cubs advance 4-3.
World Series — Los Angeles An
gels of Anaheim vs. Chicugo Cubs
Right now, the Angels are enter
ing the postseason hot. Their tan
dem of Guerrero and Teixeira is the
second coming of Manny and Big
Papi, and the front of their rotation
boasts three All-Star caliber pitch
ers. Throw in the new all-time saves
leader and the Angels have their
first World Series title since 2002.
Well, at least the Cubs made it that
far I suppose.
Angels win 4-2.
Who knows what will happen?
Any team can get hot and take
home the bacon. But if there's any
thing for sure, it'll be one heck of an
October even without the Yankees.
