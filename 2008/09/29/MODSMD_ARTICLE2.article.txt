Earlier this month, the U.S. House
of Representatives passed a hill envi
sioned by Stanford Law School Dean
Larry Kramer that would establish the
Daniel Webster Congressional
Clerkship Program. The program
would institute two-year clerkship posi
tions for 12 law school graduates to
serve members in the House and the
Senate.
Dean Kramer first considered the
idea to create a congressional clerkship
with legislative emphasis in 2005, mod
eling the structure after the existing
federal judicial clerkship program.
ITie program is named after Daniel
Webster, a leading American states
man, secretary of state and senator who
established a number of constitutional
precedents that strengthened the
authority of the federal government.
Under the proposed bill, clerks would
be chosen primarily from a pool of top
law graduates who have demonstrated
a commitment to public service and
interest in public policy.
"At present, our profession is heavi
ly court-centered." Kramer said in a
press release. "It would be enormously
beneficial for the profession and for the
public if young lawyers developed an
equal sense of the national legislature."
Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and
his co-sponsor Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-
N.Y.) were instrumental in the intro
duction of the bill. Rep. Dan Lungren
(R-Calif.) and Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-
Calif.). among others, championed the
hill and its successful passage
through the House on Sept. 9.
"I worked throughout on it with
members of Congress," Kramer said
in an email to The Daily. "I am espe
cially grateful for the help we
received from the Stanford Public
Affairs Office and Ryan Adesnik.
[director of federal relations], who
knew how to navigate this through
Congress."
Applicants will most likely
consist of third-year law students,
but Kramer anticipates that "all
individuals with a J.D. degree or
other degree that permits them to
practice law would be allowed to
apply.
This new clerkship program is
expected to attract similar candi
dates to those who have applied to
the existing federal judicial clerk
ship. The objective of the program is
to infuse the legislative system with
top law school graduates and also

increase law students' understand
ing and appreciation of the legisla
tive process.
"ITiere is no difference in princi
ple," Kramer said. "In practice it
may be that the candidates who
most appeal to Congress differ from
those who appeal to judges. If so.
that will emerge over time and is
not intended."
Kramer said the idea was to cre
ate something similar to the federal
judicial clerkship for the legislative
branch and to tap the strongest
recent law graduates.
"Hence the pay is similar, the
amount of time is similar and the
qualifications sought are similar."
he said.
The bill was introduced to the
Senate on Sept. 22, and "Once the
bill passes," Kramer said,"the Rules
Committees are charged with devel
oping the implementation plan."
Kramer expects that the first
round of clerkships will begin at the
end of Congress' summer recess in
early fall.
