serve members in the House and the
Senate.
Dean Kramer first considered the

federal judicial clerkship program.
ITie program is named after Daniel
Webster, a leading American states
man, secretary of state and senator who
established a number of constitutional
precedents that strengthened the
authority of the federal government.
Under the proposed bill, clerks would
be chosen primarily from a pool of top
law graduates who have demonstrated

Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and
