# All-out effort on offense leads Cardinal to road victory over the Huskies
## 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal lost its star, but in
his absence, new ones may have
emerged.
After running back Toby Gerhart,
who averaged over 100 yards on the
ground over the first four games of
the season, was knocked out of Sat
urday's contest in the first quarter by
a concussion, quarterback Tavita
Pritchard shouldered the offensive
load and led Stanford to a 35-28 win
over Washington.
In the process, the redshirt junior
may have silenced the last of his
doubters: Pritchard's performance
was the best of his career. He com
pleted two-thirds of his passes for
222 yards, three touchdowns and no
interceptions — he hooked up with
eight different receivers and present
ed a calmness and poise that had
been absent in some of his earlier
performances.
"This was his best night as a quar
terback here at Stanford," coach Jim
Harbaugh said. "He had a heck of a
game."
Pritchard led an attack against
Washington that featured contribu
tions from a variety of players, from
former starters to rising stars.
Seven of Pritchard's 16 comple
tions went to sophomore Ryan
Whalen, a former walk-on. Whalen
saw limited action last year (he only
had one catch), but he battled all
throughout camp with junior
Richard Sherman for a starting job
this summer and now, even as a re
serve, he has emerged as Pritchard's
favorite target.
Whalen leads the Cardinal with
14 receptions on the year and has
proven to be Stanford's most sure

handed receiver. While fellow soph
omore Doug Baldwin — whose lone
catch came on a 61-yard touchdown
pass from Pritchard — has become
the offense's big play threat. Whalen
has been most effective in the short
game, as the majority of his catches
have been for 10 yards or less. That's
not to say he can't go long, though:
His touchdown catch on Saturday
came on an 18-yard strike to the left
corner of the end zone.
"He's a tremendous worker,"
Pritchard said. "He came in here not
on scholarship and earned a spot in
his first fall camp. He's a great route
runner and he catches everything.
We're on the same page on a lot of
stuff, and I got a lot of trust in that
guy"
"Whalen just gets better and bet
ter and better," Harbaugh said. "He
made some big plays out there and
made some tough catches, some of
which were about six inches off the
turf. I just can't say enough about
him."
But it wasn't just Pritchard and
Whalen who stepped up in Gerhart's
absence. Senior running back Antho
ny Kimble, who lost his starting job
to Gerhart earlier this year, remind
ed the Cardinal faithful why he sat
atop the depth chart for three sea
sons. He, too, put together arguably
his best performance yet. Kimble
carried the ball 15 times for a career
high 157 yards and two scores. One
run was an 83-yard burst down the
right sideline, where Kimble outran
every single Husky defender en
route to the end zone.
"It felt great, I hadn't gotten a lot
of carries this year," Kimble said.
"Toby got hurt today, and he's a big
part of our offense, but it felt great to
get in there."

Kimble was complemented by
sophomore running back Jeremy
Stewart, who came into Saturday's
game with only two carries on the
year. Stewart saw significant playing
time toward the end of last season as
injuries to the running back corps
piled up, but, like Kimble, was rele
gated to an infrequently used reserve
in the wake of Gerhart's success.
Stewart took advantage of his play
ing time: He averaged over six yards
per carry on 11 touches.
"Jeremy Stewart has been
chomping at the bit and wanting
touches," Harbaugh said. "Every
week I can see it in his eyes that he
the wants ball. It was good to get
more guys involved. It's good for
morale and obviously for produc
tion."
Of course, no discussion of offen
sive success is complete without a
mention of the linemen. Anchored
by star senior center Alex Fletcher,
the Cardinal offensive line didn't
allow a sack on Saturday — they
gave Pritchard plenty of time to
throw, and the running backs plenty
of lanes to choose from.
"The line played well," Harbaugh
said. "We talked a couple weeks ago
about getting our quarterback com
fortable and smooth in the pocket,
and we were able to do that, thanks
to the line."
"That game was won up front in
the trenches — our offensive line
played tremendously," Pritchard
added. "They gave me time back
there and opened up the running
game. That game was won up front."
Pritchard and company formed
an offense that amassed a total of 466
yards and completely overwhelmed
the Huskies' defense. Every touch
down was needed, as the Cardinal

defense had trouble slowing down
the Husky attack,even after quarter
back Jake Locker suffered a game
ending injury.
"As a whole offense, we stepped it
up this game," Baldwin said.

AROUND THE PAC-10
1. USC (2-1, 0-1) L 27-21 at Oregon State
The loss to the Beavers is sore to resound in all the nalional rankings. But it's
going to take more than one loss to knock the Trojans from their spot atop the
Pac-10.
2. Oregon (4-1, 2-0) W 63-14 at Washington State
Oregon walloped the Cougars on the road, cementing their status as the No.
jflt 2 team out west.
S* 3. California (3-1, 1-0) W 42-7 v. Colorado State
If it weren't for the loss at Maryland the previous week, the Bears could very
well be challenging the Ducks for second place on the list
JX? 4. Arizona (3-1, 1-0) BYE
JjTiSm The Wildcats host the Huskies this weekend, and in some ways face a no-win sit
uation. A victory is merely expected, while a loss could be catastrophic
5. Arizona State (2-2, 1-0) BYE
ASU will have two weeks to recover from their crushing defeat against Georgia
last week before facing Cal this weekend.
S6. Stanford (3-2, 2-1) W 35-28 at Washington
The Cardinal has won two in a row, toppling Washington on the road despite
losing Toby Gerhart to a concussion early on.
jtßyjiJ* 7. Oregon State (2-2, l-l) W 27-21 v. USC
If the Beavers do nothing else of note this season, fans in Corvallis will still be
able to remember this one for a long time.
8. Washington (0-4, 0-2) L 35-28 v. Stanford
Ty Willingham's job really could be on the line this weekend against Arizona. The
Huskies have been competitive this season, which keeps them from sinking...for
now.
9. UCLA (1-3, 0-1) L 36-31 v. Fresno State
The Bruins continued to slide, losing their third in a row against Fresno State. It'll
get ugly if the "Fighting Neuheisels" can'l get a win against Wazzu this weekend.
10. Washington State (l -4, 0-2) L 63-14 v. Oregon
The Cougars have given up more than 60 points on two occasions this season

"Things were clicking tonight,"
Kimble said. "We've got some guys
that can make plays on this team."
