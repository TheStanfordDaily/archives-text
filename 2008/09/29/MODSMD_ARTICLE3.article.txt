## Offense comes alive in 35-28 victory 
### JACK SALISBURY DESK EDITOR 
Stanford averaged 272 yards
of total offense in its first four
games of the season. On
Saturday, it went for 466.
Saturday night's game at
Washington featured an offen
sive outpouring for the
Cardinal (3-2,2-1 Pac-10), who
took down the winless Huskies
35-28. Though the victory was
n't sealed until an onside kick
by Washington sailed out of
bounds with a minute and a half
left, Stanford led by two touch
downs for much of the second
half and outplayed the Huskies
overall on Saturday.
"Our guys played their tails

off tonight," head coach Jim
Harbaugh said during the
postgame conference.
The outburst came from all
fronts, with the Cardinal
offense putting together its
most complete game in a long
time.
Quarterback Tavita
Pritchard had arguably the best
game of his career, going 16-for
-24 for 222 yards, three touch
downs and no interceptions.
Senior running back Anthony
Kimble, relegated to second
string after Toby Gerhart's per
formance this year, had a career
game, rushing for 157 yards on
15 carries.
