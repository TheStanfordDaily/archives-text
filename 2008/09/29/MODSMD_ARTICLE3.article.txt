## Offense comes alive in 35-28 victory 
### JACK SALISBURY DESK EDITOR 
Stanford averaged 272 yards
of total offense in its first four
games of the season. On
Saturday, it went for 466.
Saturday night's game at
Washington featured an offen
sive outpouring for the
Cardinal (3-2,2-1 Pac-10), who
took down the winless Huskies
35-28. Though the victory was
n't sealed until an onside kick
by Washington sailed out of
bounds with a minute and a half
left, Stanford led by two touch
downs for much of the second
half and outplayed the Huskies
overall on Saturday.
"Our guys played their tails

off tonight," head coach Jim
Harbaugh said during the
postgame conference.
The outburst came from all
fronts, with the Cardinal
offense putting together its
most complete game in a long
time.
Quarterback Tavita
Pritchard had arguably the best
game of his career, going 16-for
-24 for 222 yards, three touch
downs and no interceptions.
Senior running back Anthony
Kimble, relegated to second
string after Toby Gerhart's per
formance this year, had a career
game, rushing for 157 yards on
15 carries.

GAME NOTES: Stanford is now 3-2 on the year,
making it only three wins away from achieving
bowl eligibility. The Cardinal offense awoke
on Saturday against the Huskies, amassing
466 yards on the game.


Senior running back Anthony Kimble scores on an 83-yard run in the second half of the Cardinal's 35-28
win at Washington on Saturday night. Kimble had a career game, rushing for 1 57 yards.
Even the wide receiving corps made a state
ment: Sophomore Ryan Whalen caught seven
passes for 76 yards and a touchdown, while
sophomore Doug Baldwin scored on a 61-yard
crossing route, a play which gave the Cardinal a
seven-point lead and heaps of momentum
going into halftime.
The play of the game, though, might have
been Kimble's 83-yard touchdown with nine
minutes remaining in the third quarter. Kim
ble's run down the right sideline put the Cardi
nal up two touchdowns, and the team essential
ly coasted to victory from there.The three-year
starter only got the opportunity to carry the ball
so much after Gerhart left the game in the first
half due to a concussion.
"It's hard — I started for three years, but
Toby's doing a great job," Kimble said. "We're
3-2 now; it was frustrating to a point, but we're
winning and Toby's been doing a great job, so
it's understandable."
"Everyone on this team trusts and knows
Kimble is a heck of a player," Harbaugh said.
Sophomore running back Jeremy Stewart
also had his best game of the season, running
hard for 67 yards on 11 carries.
"Jeremy Stewart has been chomping at the
bit and wanting touches," Harbaugh said.
"Every week I can see it in his eyes that he
wants the ball.
"It was good to get more guys involved. It's
good for morale and obviously for production."
Hie other big story for Stanford was the
play of Pritchard. It was a warm homecoming
for the Cardinal quarterback, a native of Taco
ma. Wash.
"It's great to come back to Washington,"
Pritchard said. "It's clean air up here — I love it
up here. When I flew in here and saw all the
green. I was telling these guys it's God's country
up here."
Probably more wondrous, though, was
Pritchard's performance against the I luskies.
"This was his best night as a quarterback here
at Stanford," I larbaugh said of the redshirt jun
ior. "He had a heck of a game. Some of the
throws he's been making in practice and a cou
ple he made against San Jose State last week are
as good as you can make them."
In postgame interviews, Pritchard was quick
to talk about the play of his offensive line.
"That game was won up front in the trenches
— our offensive line played tremendously,"
Pritchard said. "They gave me time back there
and opened up the running game. That game
was won up front."
The Cardinal also wasn't hurt by the fact that
Husky quarterback Jake Locker left the game
in the second quarter after breaking the thumb
on his throwing arm. His replacement, Ronnie
Pouch, threw for 186 yards and a touchdown,
but he wasn't able to keep up with Pritchard
and the rest of the Stanford offense.
The victory moved Stanford to 3-2 on the
year, with winnable games against Notre Dame
and Arizona up next on its schedule. The
Huskies, led by former Stanford coach 'tyrone
Willingham, are now 0-4.
