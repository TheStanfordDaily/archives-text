# GSB dean steps down
## A 						Q&A with Robert Joss, who leaves his 10-year post as dean of the GSB 
### NIKHIL JOSHI DESK EDITOR 
Robert Joss, a Stanford Graduate
School of Business (GSB) Ph.D.,
leader in global banking and dean of
the business school since 1999. will be
stepping down from his helm in the
GSB at the end of the current aca
demic year.
For much of his professional
career. Joss has been heavily involved
in management and organization
leadership. Before becoming dean, he
served as CEO of Westpac Banking
Corporation, one of Australia's
largest banks. He also has experience
in the Treasury Department and at
Wells Fargo, where he is currently a
member of the board of directors.
The Daily sat down with Joss to
discuss his accomplishments as dean,
his legacy and his views on the past
and future of the GSB.
The Stanford Daily: A decade ago in
1999. you came to the GSB deanship
straight from industry, which is rather
unusual. How did your industry back
ground color your decade here?
Robert Joss: Uniquely, at Stanford
Business School we have a tradition
of sometimes industry and sometimes
academia. Of eight deans, four of
them have been from industry and
four from academia. It is unusual for

a school at a top university, but at the
Stanford Business School it's not
been unusual. We had 20 years with
academic deans, so how did that
shape us? I don't know that we're all
that different because a dean came
from industry rather than a dean
coming from academia.
1999 was a very interesting time,
right at the peak of the Internet bub
ble. Nasdaq at 5000, we had CNBC
right on the lawn here. Students all
wanted to start companies and Web
sites. It was a pretty interesting and
heady time, and then it all kind of
punctured.
SI): As you leave the business
school, it's now a different set of cir
cumstances. How do you think the
meltdown in the financial sector is
going to affect the business school?
R.I: It's hard to know. Finance has
changed so much in the last 10 or 20
years; there are lots of different finan
cial careers. A number of years ago. a
big fraction of the class went to
investment banking, but now it's less
than five percent of the class. We are
so diversified in where our students
go: they go to different parts of the
financial industry — investment
banking, commercial banking, hedge
funds, private equity, venture capital.
money management firms. It's very
fragmented and diverse. I just don't
know how that will work out. Clearly
the finance industry will be somewhat
depressed as will the U.S. market.
SI): Do you see this as a long-term
shift away from finance?
K.I: 'ITiere has been a long-term
secular growth in finance and its
importance in the advanced
economies. Finance has been growing
faster than the U.S. economy in gen
eral— that's not sustainable, that's
not going to go on and on. To some
extent that's a shift, because this
trend we've had going on of rapid
finance growth. I think is at an end.
We'll see a more normal growth in
finance equal to the growth in the
economy. To that extent it is a funda
mental shift.
SI): Career-wise, do you think you
are going to see more GSB grads
move away from finance?
R.I: We've always had a lot of non
finance. Right now it's about a third
of our students going into financial
careers and paths; so there's always
been this two-thirds that go other
places. It's very hard for us to predict
this. The challenge for students is not
to look backwards and try to look for
• wards, and make your own assess
• ment of future opportunities.
Oftentimes it's very counterintuitive.
, Where people aren't going,you ought

to go, and people that aren't hiring
MM As are people that need Mli As.
It's a very dynamic career market
place. We never quite know, and it's a
great thing; it's up to the students.
SI): To go hack to 1999, what were
your expectations coming into the
deanship?
K.I: My expectation was that this
was the greatest business school in
the world, and our job was to make it
better. We have tried hard to do that
by continuing to attract great stu
dents, great faculty and making sure
we've had a great program here. The
most significant thing that has hap
pened in the last nine years is having
our faculty taking on the curriculum
and thinking about the 21st century
and how to prepare the next genera
tion of leaders, and deciding we could
do a better job by doing things a little
bit differently. My expectation was
that we would be that kind of place,
and I'm really glad that we've been
that kind of place.
SI): Th e concept of business
school is constantly evolving. Have
you seen the role of business school
change in the last 10 years?
R.I: Management education has
continually been a more and more
important part of the business com
munity. Hie impact that graduates of
schools like ours have on the business
community has just grown regularly
over the last 50 years.
I think that the other big impact
that is often not seen or appreciated
is the changing role of the business
school inside a great university.That's
something that's been verv significant

in our school's evolution over the last
10 years. The schools have always
been very independent and
autonomous; we even refer to the
business school as being across the

"Management is such a critical
resource and solution."

dean of the Graduate School of Business

street, Serra Street. That was proba
bly appropriate — for a long time in
our history we were just trying to be
build a great business school and not
worry too much about the rest of the
university.
Increasingly in the last decade,
with President Hennessy, the seven
school deans have come to see the
tremendous opportunity that
Stanford has, because we have seven
great schools and we cover all the
breadth of academia here. We can
walk to each other's schools. There is
just great opportunity to seek solu
tions where you bring tJ " best think
ing and problem approach from dif
ferent disciplines to bear on very dif
ferent challenges — the environ
ment. K-12 education, human health.
All of these involve science, law, engi
neering. and they particularly involve
business, because the business school
is about organizational performance.
All of these big problems that face us

are going to need a managed organi
zation as part of the solution. We're
the school that knows about organi
zation performance, so we bring a lot
to those initiatives, but they bring a

lot to us too. They bring a much
greater sense of purpose and mean
ing to our school.
Why do we have a business school
at Stanford? Because management is
such a critical resource and solution
to big challenges and problems.
TI): The concept of business
school is clearly evolving. What about
the typical business school student?
How has that changed since you've
been here?
K.l: It certainly changed since I
first came as a student. 1 came in the
mid '60s. Big change in gender, big
change in international students.
Neither of those populations existed
very much. It's a much more diverse
and global student body [now].
There are also a little bit older stu
dents. Now the median student has
four or five years of experience.
Actually in some ways a lot more
experienced, when you consider what
our students are doing even in high

school or undergraduate. They are
very engaged and learning about
business and organizations, which
wasn't common fifty years ago. The
combination of their full-time work
experience after undergrad, and all
those pre-undergrad and within
undergrad learning [experiences],
they just know a lot more about busi
ness and economics.
SI): If you were to be remembered
here for just one thing that you've
done as dean, what would that be?
RJ: For me personally, my biggest
source of satisfaction is to see the role
that our leadership activities are play
ing within the school, bringing the
issues and challenges of leadership
more into the student curriculum.
We've always been a very strong
school at preparing students analyti
cally, but the human side, where we
work in groups or teams, and you get
people to accomplish great things, this
is very hard to deal with — it's hard to
teach, and mostly students will learn
about this after, when they leave here
and actually occupy management
roles. I feel the best about how we've
moved in our curriculum and our stu
dent life and preparation and helping
them along this dimension of the
management challenge.
I'm sure in some ways we'll be
remembered for the new campus,
because that's a very physical, tangi
ble thing that people can see. but per
sonally. the thing that gives me the
most satisfaction is bringing leader
ship much more strongly into the cur
riculum and into the culture.
SI): What will vou miss most after

this school year?
RJ: The people, the interaction, of
course I hope to keep up with a lot of
that. I will miss that intense engage
ment with all these constituents —
student, faculty and alumni. It's a
wonderful community. I'm at the cen
ter of all that as the dean; I'll be part
of that community, but I just won't be
at the hub anymore.
SI): What advice would you give to
your successor?
RJ: My advice would be to try to
make the place better. Great institu
tions don't stand still and can't be
complacent. In our case, it's creating
ideas that deepen and enhance our
understanding of management, and
then using those ideas to educate
leaders who can go change the world.
It's a never-ending mission, and you
can always do it better.
SI): You have many times referred
to management as a "noble calling."
How has the decade you've spent as
dean here affected that thought?
RJ: A lot. because in some ways my
whole 10 years I've been teaching
management, and for much of my life
1 practiced it. When you're in the midst
of practicing, you often don't reflect
enough on what it means to be good at
leadership. By having the opportunity
to do more teaching and reflecting, it
really has clarified a lot of my thinking.
That's the great thing about a school.
I've learned more in the last 10 years
about management than I did in the
last 30 years practicing it.

make the place better. Great institu
tions don't stand still and can't be
complacent. In our case, it's creating
ideas that deepen and enhance our
understanding of management, and
then using those ideas to educate
leaders who can go change the world.
It's a never-ending mission, and you
can always do it better.
SI): You have many times referred
to management as a "noble calling."
How has the decade you've spent as
dean here affected that thought?
RJ: A lot. because in some ways my
whole 10 years I've been teaching
management, and for much of my life
1 practiced it. When you're in the midst
of practicing, you often don't reflect
enough on what it means to be good at
leadership. By having the opportunity
to do more teaching and reflecting, it
really has clarified a lot of my thinking.
That's the great thing about a school.
I've learned more in the last 10 years
about management than I did in the
last 30 years practicing it.

Robert Joss, a Stanford Graduate
School of Business (GSB) Ph.D.,
leader in global banking and dean of
the business school since 1999. will be
stepping down from his helm in the
GSB at the end of the current aca
demic year.
For much of his professional
career. Joss has been heavily involved
in management and organization
leadership. Before becoming dean, he
served as CEO of Westpac Banking
Corporation, one of Australia's
largest banks. He also has experience
in the Treasury Department and at
Wells Fargo, where he is currently a
member of the board of directors.
The Daily sat down with Joss to
discuss his accomplishments as dean,
his legacy and his views on the past
and future of the GSB.
The Stanford Daily: A decade ago in
1999. you came to the GSB deanship
straight from industry, which is rather
unusual. How did your industry back
ground color your decade here?
Robert Joss: Uniquely, at Stanford
Business School we have a tradition
of sometimes industry and sometimes
academia. Of eight deans, four of
them have been from industry and
four from academia. It is unusual for

a school at a top university, but at the
Stanford Business School it's not
been unusual. We had 20 years with
academic deans, so how did that
shape us? I don't know that we're all
that different because a dean came
from industry rather than a dean
coming from academia.
1999 was a very interesting time,
right at the peak of the Internet bub
ble. Nasdaq at 5000, we had CNBC
right on the lawn here. Students all
wanted to start companies and Web
sites. It was a pretty interesting and
heady time, and then it all kind of
punctured.
SI): As you leave the business
school, it's now a different set of cir
cumstances. How do you think the
meltdown in the financial sector is
going to affect the business school?
R.I: It's hard to know. Finance has
changed so much in the last 10 or 20
years; there are lots of different finan
cial careers. A number of years ago. a
big fraction of the class went to
investment banking, but now it's less
than five percent of the class. We are
so diversified in where our students
go: they go to different parts of the
financial industry — investment
banking, commercial banking, hedge
funds, private equity, venture capital.
money management firms. It's very
fragmented and diverse. I just don't
know how that will work out. Clearly
the finance industry will be somewhat
depressed as will the U.S. market.
SI): Do you see this as a long-term
shift away from finance?
K.I: 'ITiere has been a long-term
secular growth in finance and its
importance in the advanced
economies. Finance has been growing
faster than the U.S. economy in gen
eral— that's not sustainable, that's
not going to go on and on. To some
extent that's a shift, because this
trend we've had going on of rapid
finance growth. I think is at an end.
We'll see a more normal growth in
finance equal to the growth in the
economy. To that extent it is a funda
mental shift.
SI): Career-wise, do you think you
are going to see more GSB grads
move away from finance?
R.I: We've always had a lot of non
finance. Right now it's about a third
of our students going into financial
careers and paths; so there's always
been this two-thirds that go other
places. It's very hard for us to predict
this. The challenge for students is not
to look backwards and try to look for
• wards, and make your own assess
• ment of future opportunities.
Oftentimes it's very counterintuitive.
, Where people aren't going,you ought

to go, and people that aren't hiring
MM As are people that need Mli As.
It's a very dynamic career market
place. We never quite know, and it's a
great thing; it's up to the students.
SI): To go hack to 1999, what were
your expectations coming into the
deanship?
K.I: My expectation was that this
was the greatest business school in
the world, and our job was to make it
better. We have tried hard to do that
by continuing to attract great stu
dents, great faculty and making sure
we've had a great program here. The
most significant thing that has hap
pened in the last nine years is having
our faculty taking on the curriculum
and thinking about the 21st century
and how to prepare the next genera
tion of leaders, and deciding we could
do a better job by doing things a little
bit differently. My expectation was
that we would be that kind of place,
and I'm really glad that we've been
that kind of place.
SI): Th e concept of business
school is constantly evolving. Have
you seen the role of business school
change in the last 10 years?
R.I: Management education has
continually been a more and more
important part of the business com
munity. Hie impact that graduates of
schools like ours have on the business
community has just grown regularly
over the last 50 years.
I think that the other big impact
that is often not seen or appreciated
is the changing role of the business
school inside a great university.That's
something that's been verv significant

in our school's evolution over the last
10 years. The schools have always
been very independent and
autonomous; we even refer to the
business school as being across the

"Management is such a critical
resource and solution."

dean of the Graduate School of Business

street, Serra Street. That was proba
bly appropriate — for a long time in
our history we were just trying to be
build a great business school and not
worry too much about the rest of the
university.
Increasingly in the last decade,
with President Hennessy, the seven
school deans have come to see the
tremendous opportunity that
Stanford has, because we have seven
great schools and we cover all the
breadth of academia here. We can
walk to each other's schools. There is
just great opportunity to seek solu
tions where you bring tJ " best think
ing and problem approach from dif
ferent disciplines to bear on very dif
ferent challenges — the environ
ment. K-12 education, human health.
All of these involve science, law, engi
neering. and they particularly involve
business, because the business school
is about organizational performance.
All of these big problems that face us

are going to need a managed organi
zation as part of the solution. We're
the school that knows about organi
zation performance, so we bring a lot
to those initiatives, but they bring a

lot to us too. They bring a much
greater sense of purpose and mean
ing to our school.
Why do we have a business school
at Stanford? Because management is
such a critical resource and solution
to big challenges and problems.
TI): The concept of business
school is clearly evolving. What about
the typical business school student?
How has that changed since you've
been here?
K.l: It certainly changed since I
first came as a student. 1 came in the
mid '60s. Big change in gender, big
change in international students.
Neither of those populations existed
very much. It's a much more diverse
and global student body [now].
There are also a little bit older stu
dents. Now the median student has
four or five years of experience.
Actually in some ways a lot more
experienced, when you consider what
our students are doing even in high

school or undergraduate. They are
very engaged and learning about
business and organizations, which
wasn't common fifty years ago. The
combination of their full-time work
experience after undergrad, and all
those pre-undergrad and within
undergrad learning [experiences],
they just know a lot more about busi
ness and economics.
SI): If you were to be remembered
here for just one thing that you've
done as dean, what would that be?
RJ: For me personally, my biggest
source of satisfaction is to see the role
that our leadership activities are play
ing within the school, bringing the
issues and challenges of leadership
more into the student curriculum.
We've always been a very strong
school at preparing students analyti
cally, but the human side, where we
work in groups or teams, and you get
people to accomplish great things, this
is very hard to deal with — it's hard to
teach, and mostly students will learn
about this after, when they leave here
and actually occupy management
roles. I feel the best about how we've
moved in our curriculum and our stu
dent life and preparation and helping
them along this dimension of the
management challenge.
I'm sure in some ways we'll be
remembered for the new campus,
because that's a very physical, tangi
ble thing that people can see. but per
sonally. the thing that gives me the
most satisfaction is bringing leader
ship much more strongly into the cur
riculum and into the culture.
SI): What will vou miss most after

this school year?
RJ: The people, the interaction, of
course I hope to keep up with a lot of
that. I will miss that intense engage
ment with all these constituents —
student, faculty and alumni. It's a
wonderful community. I'm at the cen
ter of all that as the dean; I'll be part
of that community, but I just won't be
at the hub anymore.
SI): What advice would you give to
your successor?
RJ: My advice would be to try to
make the place better. Great institu
tions don't stand still and can't be
complacent. In our case, it's creating
ideas that deepen and enhance our
