# GSB dean steps down
## A
						Q&A with Robert Joss, who leaves his 10-year post as dean of the GSB 
### NIKHIL JOSHI DESK EDITOR 
Robert Joss, a Stanford Graduate
School of Business (GSB) Ph.D.,
leader in global banking and dean of
the business school since 1999. will be
stepping down from his helm in the
GSB at the end of the current aca
demic year.
For much of his professional
career. Joss has been heavily involved
in management and organization
leadership. Before becoming dean, he
served as CEO of Westpac Banking
Corporation, one of Australia's
largest banks. He also has experience
in the Treasury Department and at
Wells Fargo, where he is currently a
member of the board of directors.
The Daily sat down with Joss to
discuss his accomplishments as dean,
his legacy and his views on the past
and future of the GSB.
The Stanford Daily: A decade ago in
1999. you came to the GSB deanship
straight from industry, which is rather
unusual. How did your industry back
ground color your decade here?
Robert Joss: Uniquely, at Stanford
Business School we have a tradition
of sometimes industry and sometimes
academia. Of eight deans, four of
them have been from industry and
four from academia. It is unusual for

a school at a top university, but at the
Stanford Business School it's not
been unusual. We had 20 years with
academic deans, so how did that
shape us? I don't know that we're all
that different because a dean came
from industry rather than a dean
coming from academia.
1999 was a very interesting time,
right at the peak of the Internet bub
ble. Nasdaq at 5000, we had CNBC
right on the lawn here. Students all
wanted to start companies and Web
sites. It was a pretty interesting and
heady time, and then it all kind of
punctured.
SI): As you leave the business
school, it's now a different set of cir
cumstances. How do you think the
meltdown in the financial sector is
going to affect the business school?
R.I: It's hard to know. Finance has
changed so much in the last 10 or 20
years; there are lots of different finan
cial careers. A number of years ago. a
big fraction of the class went to
investment banking, but now it's less
than five percent of the class. We are
so diversified in where our students
go: they go to different parts of the
financial industry â€” investment
banking, commercial banking, hedge
funds, private equity, venture capital.
