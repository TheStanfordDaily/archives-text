## Stanford ranked as sustainable leader Univ. is only one of 15 sustainability leaders 
### KAMIL DADA DESK EDITOR 
Colleges around the world have
increasingly made steps toward sus
tainabilitv initiatives, with a growing
number adopting green building
policies, sourcing locally grown pro
duce and vowing to reduce carbon
dioxide emissions. The latest
College Sustainabilitv Report Card,
released last Wednesday by the
Sustainable Endowments Institute
(SEI), named Stanford as one of 15
"overall sustainabilitv leaders" in
Canada and the United States for
its recycling and environmental
efforts."
Schools that achieve an average
grade of A- or better across all cate
gories in both campus facilities and
endowment management are recog
nized as "Overall College
Sustainabilitv Leaders," schools that
achieve an average grade of A- or
better across the campus facilities
categories are recognized as
"Campus Sustainabilitv Leaders"
and schools that achieve an average
grade of A- or better across the
endowment management cate
gories are recognized as
"Endowment Sustainability
Leaders." Stanford was rated as
both an Overall College
Sustainability Leader and a Campus
Sustainability Leader.
Joseph Stagner, executive direc
tor of the Sustainability and Energy
Management Executive Office,
explained that the report card was a

good measure of campus sustain
ability.
"The SEI report card is a meas
ure of how a university is doing in
advancing sustainability in the
design, construction and operation
of its campus." he said. "[lt is also a
measure of] how well a university's
endowment management policies
support sustainability on a larger
scale."
The Ivy League Institutions of
Harvard. Columbia. Dartmouth.
UPenn and Brown, as well as
Colorado and Washington, were
also named in the top group, each
receiving overall grades of A-.
Stanford has 13 full-time
employees dedicated to "sustain
able development." a term coined in
1987 by the World Commission on
Environment and Development
and defined as "improving people's
life-enabling habits to meet our
needs in the present without com
promising the ability of future gen
erations to meet their needs." The
sustainability team tackles issues
from sustainable buildings and
energy management to sustainable
dining and alternative transporta
tion programs.
The SEI report card is based
upon independent research and sur
veys sent to college officials about
campus sustainability activities, din
ing services policies and endow
ment practices. The universities
were then graded on nine categories
— administration, climate change
and energy, food and recycling,
green building, student involve
ment, transportation, endowment
transparency, investment priorities
and shareholder engagement. They
were also given an overall grade;
the average was a C+.
Stagner said there are many
plans to further improve sustain
ability on campus, including
expanding sustainability programs
to the school and department level
where they do not currently exist,
enhancing student involvement in
sustainability through additional
outreach and support from admin
istration and installing additional
building energy and water conser
vation retrofits.
He also said the team is working
hard to achieve an A rating next
year.
"We believe our transportation
program already warrants an A, but
we will be working on that." he
explained. "[We will also be] work
ing toward an A in climate change
by setting a greenhouse gas reduc

tion commitment and climate
action plan."
