House approves nuclear pact with India
The House has voted overwhelmingly to approve a
landmark pact that would allow the U.S. to provide nu
clear materials to India.
The deal still faces major obstacles in the Senate.The
prospects for passage before President Bush leaves of
fice in January are uncertain.
The House approved the measure by a 298-117 vote
in an unusual Saturday session. The accord reverses
three decades of U.S. policy by shipping atomic fuel to
India in return for international inspections of India's
civilian reactors.
Supporters say it would bring India 's atomic program
under closer scrutiny. Critics say it would boost India's
nuclear arsenal and lead to an arms race in South Asia.

male police officers.

the eastern province of Kunar, said airstrikes hit a com
pound in the province's Asmar district, killing three
civilians.

Qaida cell network responsible for a number of bomb
attacks in Kunar province.
Wilson: Fight Schwarzenegger recall
Former Gov. Pete Wilson on Saturday urged his fel
low Republicans not to make light of a recall drive
against Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger.
He told delegates at the California Republican
Party's fall convention that they should take the threat
from the state prison guards union seriously, even if it
isn't likely to succeed.
"I hope that I don't have to tell you what an ill-con
sidered idea that is.," he said. "We did it once: we did not
do it lightly."
