# Obama, McCain meet in Missouri for first presidential faceoff
## War, taxes divide candidates in debate 
### CHRISTOPHER WILLS THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
In a faceoff that returned again and
again to judgment, John McCain por
trayed himself as a battle-tested elder
running against a naive rookie, while
Barack Obama suggested the Republican
is a hothead who made the wrong choices
on the Iraq war, corporate taxes and

more.
Now they take the themes from an in
tense first debate back to the campaign
trail, looking for some edge in a tight pres
idential race. With 38 days left, McCain is
headed for Washington and the dispute
over a Wall Street bailout, while Obama
plans to visit Republican-leaning states
where the Democrat thinks he can make
inroads.

The debate presented a huge opportu
nity for the candidates to deliver their
message to millions of Americans — or
make an embarrassing blunder.
Interest in Friday's debate was ampli
fied by suspense about whether it would
even take place. McCain had said he
wouldn't take part unless the financial cri
sis was resolved, then reversed course and
decided at the last minute to participate
without a deal.
McCain, 72, frequently referred to his age
and experience.
Sometimes he joked — at one point he
waggled his eyebrows and quipped that
the moderator didn't think he could hear
the question — and other times he went
out of his way to mention the foreign
countries he has visited and the years he
has spent on Capitol Hill.
"I have a long record and the Ameri
can people know me very well," he said.
But Obama, a 47-year-old serving his
first term in the Senate, challenged Mc-
Cain frequently and offered himself as
someone who can be trusted to make
sound choices.
Obama noted that he opposed invad
ing Iraq, while McCain supported it. He
said McCain has voted with the unpopu
lar President Bush 90 percent of the time.
He argued McCain backs corporate tax
breaks and lax regulation that have con
tributed to the Wall Street economic cri
sis.
"We have to recognize that this is a
final verdict on eight years of failed eco
nomic policies promoted by George
Bush, supported by Senator McCain,"
Obama said.
Obama sought to connect with voters
who might have doubts about a relative
newcomer to national politics, a black
man with an exotic name and back
ground. He talked often about the strug
gles of ordinary Americans — "the nurse,
the teacher, the police officer who,
frankly, at the end of each month they've
got a little financial crisis going on."
l"he Obama campaign tried to back up

that point in its newest ad. a spot released
Saturday that notes McCain never men-i
tioned the middle class during the debate;
"McCain doesn't get it,"the announcer
says."Barack Obania does."
In a long exchange with McCain over
the Iraq war. Obama tried to avoid being
seen as soft or reluctant to use force when
necessary. ;
An early opponent of invading Iraq, he
stressed that his position was prompted
partly by worries that it would distract
from hunting down Osama bin Laden,
and he said withdrawing from Iraq now
would free up resources to re-energize
that hunt.
Obama suggested McCain might over
react to national emergencies, noting that
the Arizona senator has talked about "ex*
Unction" for North Korea and joked
about bombing Iran.
McCain accused Obama of seeking to
"snatch defeat from the jaws of victory" in
Iraq. He said the "surge" of U.S. troops has
reduced violence there and withdrawing
would destabilize the country and the en
tire region.
Asked what lessons he had learned
from the long war. McCain said."that you
cannot have a failed strategy that will then
cause you to nearly lose a conflict."
On Iraq and many other issues, Mc-
Cain said Obama was naive, experienced,
confused. He criticized Obama for saying
he would meet with Iranian President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad without precon
dition. "This is dangerous. It isn't just
naive; it's dangerous," McCain said.
The two bickered at times, talking
over one another and throwing accusa
tions of twisted words and false state
ments. But Obama sometimes acknowl
edged agreements with McCain — con
cessions that might reinforce Obama's
claim to be a politician who can find com
mon ground and reduce confrontation in
Washington.
