## Growing Up McCain 
### 
This column originally ran on Aug. 28,2008.
I grew up with John McCain. His Arizona
senate offices — and now, "Southwest
ern Campaign Headquarters" — are
just blocks from my childhood home in
Phoenix, Ariz. Located on the unassuming
16th St. in a short glass building across
from an auto repair place. I passed these
offices every day for nine years on the way
to school. Further along this same route
was John McCain's church. North Phoenix
Baptist Church. Then, just a few blocks
north of my destination was one of his half
dozen houses. Finally, a few blocks south
was the Catholic high school attended by
some of my neighborhood friends and
John McCain's son. who is now serving in
Iraq.
So as a native Arizonan. I have long
lived with John McCain's admirable ideals
and frustrating contradictions. Growing up
in a staunchly Republican family, we, like
many others in Arizona, traced our politi
cal attitudes back to the days of Barry
Goldwater. He held an iconoclastic liber
tarian outlook that likely grew out of Ari
zona's hot and lonely frontier lifestyle.
Nowadays, Goldwater is the political pa
tron saint of the "leave-me-alone" philoso
phy. But McCain, much to Arizona Repub
licans' chagrin, never subscribed to this phi
losophy. He does adhere selectively, most
notably on economic issues. But while
Goldwater's primary unit of political think
ing was the individual. McCain's primary
unit of political thinking is the nation.
This was always apparent in McCain's
relationship to Arizona. While he was phys
ically a part of my life in Arizona, in most
respects. McCain never really belonged to
our state. It is not because he is not a native
Arizonan — very few people of his genera
tion are natives. Rather, McCain has always
deliberately represented the United States
of America above and beyond the state of
Arizona.
Indeed, McCain is, as columnist David
Brooks said, a "romantic nationalist" — a
devotee of America and "a cause larger
than one's self." Just look at this year's Re

publican National Convention theme:
"Country First." The people of Arizona, in
his thinking, are essentially another special
interest looking out for its own narrow in
terests and not the interest of the nation-at
large. Of course, of anybody. John McCain
has credibility to talk about national serv
ice — he has spent his life at the Naval
Academy, in the Navy, in a POW camp and
in Congress. Let's just say that he is an au
thority on serving America. It is this overar
ching theme that binds together what is an
otherwise erratic political outlook.
Indeed, McCain uses larger, romantic
ideas like national duty, greater good and
personal integrity to guide his decisions on
smaller individual issues. His political
thinking defies easy placement on the usual
political spectrum and certainly party la
bels. Moreover, this outlook means he is far
from a policy wonk. While policy wonks
look at the painstaking details of individual
bills and plans. McCain assumes that his
sound ideals will guide the minutia. He
finds romantic crusades, like fighting feder
al corruption or fighting terror, and then
legislates accordingly. He is a man of princi
pled ends, not detailed means.
While growing up in Arizona and still
today, I appreciate and respect McCain's
romantic outlook. I think his heart is in the
right place. (The national media, most of
America and a vast majority of Arizona
have, according to polls, long shared my af
fection for him.) But I'm not sure that this
is McCain's moment in history. I think the
problems that we face today are more com
plex than he makes them out to be. While
lie wants to reduce our age to sweeping and
stark battles, it seems to me that we're real
ly in an age of complexity. I just hope that
he will begin to address these complexities
— to channel his bigger ideas through good
policy, particularly more reasonable for
eign policy.Then I'd be proud to see his Ari
zona senate offices move from 16th St. to
16(H) Pennsylvania Ave.
