Another game, another three-goal
victory.
The Stanford women's soccer team
won by a three-goal margin for the
third consecutive game, shutting out
St. Mary's 3-0 at Laird Q.Cagan Stadi
um on Friday night. And as impressive
as that sounds, the stat line probably
flattered the Gaels more than the Car
dinal.
Stanford ripped 30 shots at the St.
Mary's net and dominated all aspects
of the match, controlling possession
and not letting its opponent generate
any sort of attack. In fact, sophomore
keeper Kira Maker didn't even have
to make a save the entire night as the
Cardinal defense held the Gaels to
just one (off-target) shot.
Stanford got off to a fast start as
junior Kelley O'Hara almost scored
twice in the first 10 minutes of the
match, forcing Gaels keeper Tara Lar
son to make a save in the first minute
and shooting just over the bar in the
eighth minute. Freshman Lindsay Tay
lor blasted a shot that sailed high off
freshman Cami Levin's cross and
sophomore Christen Press just missed
a header. It quickly became clear that
it would not be a matter of if the Car
dinal would find the net. but when.
Taylor almost broke the deadlock
with 19 minutes remaining in the half,
but her fine solo effort was saved by
Larson. She would get her goal, how
ever. just a minute later. Senior de
fender and co-captain Marisa Abegg
found O'Hara on the left side, and the
junior advanced down the wing and
sent a low cross that Taylor buried in
the back of the net. The goal was Tay
lor's sixth of the year, momentarily
tying her with Christen Press for the
team lead.
The Cardinal was not satisfied
though.and continued pushing for an
other score before halftime. O'Hara
connected with a Levin free kick only
to see her header saved, and Teresa
Noyola half-volleved wide right just a
minute later. The chances were there,
but it looked as if Stanford might go
into the half up by only one goal.
But with just 44 seconds left.
O'Hara received the ball in the box
and blasted it through traffic into the
corner of the goal. The end of the first
half is quickly becoming O'Hara's sig
nature time — the junior forward has
now scored in the final few minutes of
the first half in three consecutive
games.
The Cardinal out-shot the Gaels
16-1 in the first half, and St. Mary's had
a tough time just moving the ball into
Stanford's half of the field.The second
half started with more of the same, and

GAME NOTES: The No. 6 Cardinal women
romped to yet another three-goal victory, de
feating the Gaels by shutout after having
topped Yale and Cal Poly by the same mar
gin last week. Sophomore Christen Press
currently leads the team with seven goals on
the year, but is closely followed by |unior Kel
ley O'Hara and freshman Lindsay Tayior,
with six apiece. All three of Stanford's top
scorers added a goal to their season tallies
in the win over St. Mary's.

"I thought we
played very good
soccer. [W]e created
a lot of good
chances."

head coach

Stanford was threatening again just a
few minutes after the restart.
Junior fullback Alicia Jenkins
pushed forward down the right wing
and sent a ball into the middle, but no
one was there to meet the cross and
the Cardinal failed to convert on a
good scoring chance. Press then saw a
strong individual effort saved by Lar
son in the 54th minute.
The game slowed down a bit for the
next 10 minutes, but the Cardinal soon
continued its barrage on the St. Mat)'f,
goal. Levin hit the crossbar on an au
dacious lob from outside the box. and
senior defender Allison Falk just
missed on two headers from set pieces.
Stanford seemed to be closing in on a
third goal, although it looked like the
women would not need any more in
surance due to their dominant de
fense.
