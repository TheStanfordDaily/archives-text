themselves this past weekend.They hosted Pa
cific on Saturday, shutting out the Tigers en

route to an easy victory.

the team's conference record.exhibiting domi
nance in any game adds a confidence boost to
the team. Saturday's win was also a testament
to the team's ability to pull together and over
come their recent struggles.
Stanford had been struggling offensively, so
head coach Lesley Irvine came up with a simple

solution to put more points on the board: "Just
shoot it," she told her players.
And shoot they did. Junior Midori Uehara
took charge and scored a career-high four
goals, leading Stanford to a 7-0 victory. Sopho
more Camille Gandhi assisted on three of the
goals and added her second goal of the season.

with an unassisted i>oal in the 15th minute,and

sophomore Katherine Donner sealed the game
with a goal in the 59th minute. (ioalie Alessan
dra Moss, playing in her ninth collegiate com
petition after red-shirting as a freshman, had
seven saves.
"We've been working on shooting and in
creasing our offensive output." senior Hillary
Braun said. "Midori did a really good job of
being in the right place at the right time, all the
time."
"I felt a little guilty [after the game]," Ue
hara said. "I was able to put the ball in the net
but so many people did so much work to make
it happen."
Stanford had the upper hand from the start,
leaping to a 3-0 halftime lead. The win improves
its overall record to 3-7. and the women are I -2
in NorPac play. The Cardinal heads to Massa
chusetts for a two-game road trip this weekend,
taking on Northeastern and I loly Cross.
Cardinal cross country sweeps Stanford Invite
line Stanford men's cross-country team ran
well at the Stanford Invite last weekend. The
Cardinal finished first overall, more than two
minutes and 4<X points ahead of second-place

winning the 6k race. UC-Davis finished a dis
tant second, more than 2 1/2 minutes and 79
points behind the Cardinal.
