# Back to the Pac-10, Mr. Kiffin
## 
### 
J t's practically inevitable.
It could happen this week, next
week or even as late as January, hut it
will happen.
Before the 2009 football season
commences, Lane Kiffin will be out
as coach of the Oakland Raiders and
Tyrone Willingham will no longer
lead the Washington Huskies.
The Kiffin saga has gone on for
months now and it continues to take
one odd turn after the other. Over
the past three weeks, news outlets
have twice reported that Kiffin has
been fired.Twice. And both times, he
showed up to work the next day. job
in hand.
Not that he wants it; it's no secret
that he wants out of Oakland. The
stalemate between Kiffin and owner
Al Davis is bound to end soon leav
ing Kiffin. all of 33 years old. on the
job market. But neither man wants to
lose face, so Kiffin won't leave until
Davis fires him. Davis, on the other
hand, wants Kiffin to resign so he can
save money on the remainder of Kif
fin's contract.
Willingham's situation doesn't
have the same intrigue that Kiffin's
does, but the end result is bound to
be the same. 1 le has compiled an 11-
29 record since heading to Seattle to
take over the Washington program at
the end of the 2004 season.This year,
the Huskies are 0-4 after losing at
home to Stanford on Saturday.
Ihey are the only team in a HCS
conference without a win this season.
It's not entirely Willingham's fault
in the past two years. Washington has
had tremendously difficult sched
ules. But there has been almost no
hope in Seattle during Willingham's
tenure, and he has shown little ability
to get the program back on track. I lis
evident frustration after Saturday's
game shows that he knows his leash
is getting ever shorter.
The I luskies need to start winning
now if Willingham has any chance at
retaining his job, but with much of
the Pac-10 Conference schedule still
to play and star quarterback Jake
Locker out for six to eight weeks
with a broken thumb. Washington's
prospects for 200K look dim. So do
Willingham's hopes of keeping his
job.
Both coaches should land on their
feet after their current tenures con
clude. whether as head coaches or as
sistants. I lere's where their two paths
collide: Kiffin would be an excellent
choice to replace Willingham.
Kiffin may be considered for up
coming NI'L head coaching vacan
cies, but after working in the football
abyss that is Oakland for two sea
sons,there is little incentive for Kiffin
to take over teams like St. Louis
(who fired Scott Linehan on Mon
day) and Detroit that would be. at
best, massive rebuilding projects.
Instead, Kiffin could return to his
Pac-10 roots and take over a pro
gram that already has an emerging
star behind center (Locker, a red
shirt sophomore) and young talent at
the offensive skill positions and on
defense. Kiffin, who spent six seasons
at USC, knows the conference well
and has experience recruiting on the
West Coast.
The latter point would be of par
ticular interest to Washington Presi
dent Mark Emmert and Athletic Di
rector Scott Woodward. Willingham
has never been known as a premier
recruiter — it was one of the chief
reasons for his firing at Notre Dame.
At Washington, many of Willing
ham's recruits didn't qualify academ
ically, and he failed to land in-state
talent such as Jonathan Stewart (who
went to Oregon and was a first round
pick of the Carolina Panthers this
year) and Taylor Mays (now at USC.
and arguably the best safety in the
country).
Enter Kiffin. who was USC "s re
cruiting coordinator for three sea
sons. Each year, the Trojans had the
No. 1 class in the country. He knows
the West Coast and California in par
ticular, which is a high school football
hotbed. And he has proven that he
can handle the Washington state re
cruiting scene — he was persuasive
enough to convince Mays, who had
legacy at Washington, to leave the
