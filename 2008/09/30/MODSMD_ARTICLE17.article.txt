## Another trial, another day in the life of O.J. Simpson 
### HARRIET RYAN ASHLEY POWERS THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
When he's not on trial, O.J. Simp
son wakes up at 5 a.m. and is driving
to a golf course in Miami by 6:30. He
takes an afternoon nap and goes to
bed early. In between, the football
great is beset by requests.
Strangers want to take his picture.
Fans want to buy him a drink. And.
according to recordings played in his
robbery-kidnapping trial, men who
call themselves his friends try to cash
in on his infamy.
The hours of recordings — made
surreptitiously by a Simpson busi
ness partner on Sept. 13, 2007 —
provide an unfiltered look at the
Hall of Famer's life since his 1995
acquittal in the killings of his ex
wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her
friend Ronald Goldman. Though
Simpson once juggled dating mod
els and posed on Hollywood red
carpets, the tapes portray an aging
but still charismatic man, who
draws crowds of adoring strangers
in bars but counts few trustworthy
friends.
His $400,000 annual pension and
$1 million house seem at odds with
the low-rent tactics of those who sur
round him. In the recordings.he com
plains about one confidant who tried
to persuade him to film a sex tape
and to pose for the National Enquir
er with a mound of cocaine. Another
associate is heard hitting him up for
autographs only to call him a killer as
soon as he's out of earshot.
"I know my friends." Simpson says

on one tape, just hours before he and
five cohorts allegedly robbed a pair
of memorabilia dealers. "I know bet
ter than anybody."
The prosecution's witness list be
lies his assessment. All but one of the
eight other men at the Palace Station
Hotel & Casino confrontation are
testifying against Simpson. Several
said he was the scheme's ringleader
and that at least one of his associates
was armed. ITie 61-year-old faces a
dozen counts, including kidnapping,
which carries a potential life sen
tence.
Grayer and more weary-looking
than at his Los Angeles trials. Simp
son nonetheless arrives at Court
room 15A each day smiling. His
hearty laugh rumbles down the hall
as he signs autographs and backslaps
well-wishers.
His private life is fraught with
schemes and betrayals, according to
the recordings, interviews and court
testimony.
Consider Mike Gilbert,his former
agent. Once the closest of friends —
the Gilbert children knew Simpson
as "Uncle 0.J." — the men collabo
rated on a number of business ven
tures, including a planned auction of
the suit Simpson wore the day of his
acquittal.
In 1997. after a civil jury found
Simpson liable for the pair of mur
ders. Gilbert helped Simpson hide
his assets, associates say on the
recordings.
But a decade ago, the men had a
bitter falling out and no longer
speak. Prosecutors say Simpson's
aneer toward his old friend — he

maintains Gilbert stole valuable me
mentos from him — led the NFL
standout to mastermind the robbery.
On the recordings, Simpson rants
about the agent's purported deceit to
anyone who will listen.
In May, Gilbert published a mem
oir — "How I Helped O.J. Get Away
With Murder," in which he claimed a
drug-addled Simpson confessed to
killing his ex-wife and Goldman
years after the crimes.
Gilbert was called as a prosecu
tion witness last week, but the judge
prohibited lawyers from asking him
much. Outside the courtroom, his
lawyer waved off other questions but
said Gilbert was always available to
talk about his book.
In conversation, those who deal in
Simpson memorabilia bounce be
tween obsessive devotion and deri
sion. boasting of their close relation
ship with him in one breath and ridi
culing him the next.
"How was he when you were
around him? Wasn't it a blast?"
Beardsley gushes at one point.
Minutes later, he jokes that Simp
son is so broke he would sell his own
underwear and suggests that the re
tired athlete has a drinking problem.
"You know, he's drunk everyday,"
Beardsley says.
The man who made the record
ings, Thomas Riccio, is called a
"hero" by Simpson for alerting him
that Beardsley was trying to sell his
merchandise. But after leaving a
meeting where Simpson agreed to
sign 200 copies of "If I Did It,"the
"hypothetical confessional" book
about the murders, Riccio tells a

friend that Simpson began dating
Prody "not long after he killed
Nicole."
Days later, after Simpson's arrest,
Riccio made more than $200.(KX) by
selling copies of the recordings and
snagging a book deal.
Simpson, however, is not always
the opportunists' victim. Beardsley
recounts how Simpson walloped
Gilbert on the head — reducing the
agent to tears — as they watched
coverage of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s
plane crash. It was to demonstrate
that, for a change, the media glare
was not focused on Simpson.
"I can do whatever I want this
week," Beardsley quoted Simpson as
saying.
He seems to have time for every
one who recognizes him — even
Riccio's friend, a limo driver who
boasts to an uninterested Simpson
about getting into strip clubs for free.
When another man can't remember
Simpson's movie roles, he gamely
lists the "Naked Gun" movies.
After the televised saga of his
murder trial. Simpson said recently,
he was bitter. But his mother urged
him not to let the experience darken
his lighthearted personality. Since he
arrived in Las Vegas for this trial,
Simpson said, strangers have repeat
edly treated him to dinner. He
spends Sunday afternoons in a sports
bar where people buy him drinks.
The experience mirrors a story
Simpson told in one recording about
a wealthy nightclub patron treating
him to a $75 shot.
"Hey," he says,"they might as well
spend it on me."
