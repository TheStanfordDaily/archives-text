# Drinking problematic during NSO
## Four alcohol-related transports reported during NSO; Bob residents notified of possible alcohol probation 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A handful of alcohol-related emergency
transports — including one from a freshman
dorm — occurred during New Student
Orientation (NSO), violating the
University's NSO alcohol policy and
prompting administrators to put one Row
house under review for alcohol probation.
Four incidents of alcohol over-consump
tion requiring emergency service trans

portation to the hospital occurred between
Sept. 15 and 21, according to statistics pro
vided by the Stanford Department of Public
Safety (SDPS). Three of these transports
"were from areas around (associated with) a
student residence," while one transport took
place from inside a freshman dorm.
"The Freshmen Dean's Office, in con
junction with Residential Education, takes
seriously any reports that new students have
engaged in high-risk drinking," said
Assistant Dean of Freshmen Koren

Bakkegard in an email to The Daily.
Residential Education staff sent an email
on Sept. 18 to all student residents on the
Row saying it had received reports of unau
thorized gatherings with alcohol being held
in a few houses during NSO.
"We have already received reports of a
handful of alcohol-related hospital trans
ports and unsanctioned events with alcohol
hosted in Row houses," the email stated.
"These events ... are jeopardizing the Row
privilege outlined in the NSO policy. If you.

as residents of the Row, do not take this pol
icy seriously, listen to your staff and behave
responsibly, the University will revoke the
privilege for which the Row residents before
you have worked so hard."
The email, which had the text of the NSO
alcohol policy attached, was sent to all stu
dent residents on the Row two days after
NSO began.
Ralph Castro, manager of the Substance
Abuse Prevention Program at Vaden Health
Center and co-chair of the Stanford Alcohol

Advisory Board, said in an email to The
Daily that high-risk, alcohol-related inci
dents tend to cluster around the first few
weeks after students return to campus.
"There were some incidents that origi
nated from the Row this year that were
higher [in number] than in past years,"
Castro said.
The NSO alcohol policy prohibits any
Stanford student from providing, serving or
in any way making alcohol available
to any new undergraduate student.
The policy allows students of legal
drinking age to privately consume
alcohol in moderation during
Orientation and permits Row hous
es without freshmen or transfer stu
dents to host up to two closed, resi
dent-only gatherings where alcohol
may be served.
Under this exception, only beer,
wine and malt liquor may be served
to residents who are at least 21 years
of age, and only designated resi
dence staff can register such a social
gathering directly with the Row
Office.
"As upperclassmen, you know
that NSO is a dry week." said a Row
resident who spoke on the condition
of anonymity because of the sensi
tivity of the issue. But. the resident
said, upperclassmen sometimes do

not think about the policy because it
more directly impacts freshman and
four-class dorms.
Administrators with Residential
Education and the Freshman
Dean's Office said they were unable
to comment on specific houses or
incidents. But several students, who
spoke to The Daily on the condition
of anonymity given the sensitive
nature of these incidents, reported
that some Row house gatherings
took place in violation of the NSO
alcohol policy.
On Thursday, Sept. IS, an individ
ual was found unresponsive in front
of Bob. according to one student.
Emergency services responded to
the scene, and the individual was
transported to the hospital likely
due to over-consumption of alcohol,
the student said.
Several students confirmed that
an incident had taken place.
Hie students also said Bob resi
dents had received an e-mail
informing them that the house was
under review for alcohol probation.
Castro said that, based on past

experiences, houses placed on
alcohol probation would he per
mitted to have limited parties with
alcohol and be subject to great
scrutiny. If a house is then placed
under alcohol suspension, it can
not host any events with alcohol
for the remainder of its suspension
period.
Students interviewed by The
Daily said unsanctioned parties
took place at other Row houses and
that many students consumed alco
hol before Band Run on the night of
Sept. 16.
Castro said the Alcohol Advisory
Board (AAB) reviews the NSC)
alcohol policy annually during fall
quarter to assess its effectiveness.
"The Row exemption is reviewed
each fall, and it is revocable at any
time," Castro said.
He added that the AAB created
the Row exemption about three to
four years ago, when student staff
members of Row houses were
included on the board and brought
the issue before it.
Bakkeeard. the other current co

chair of the AAB, said students
allegedly involved in high-risk alco-

hol incidents usually
meet with administra
tors who would review
the situation and could

recommend further
action. She said such
actions may include a

year deferral before
the start of classes,
referral to alcohol

assessment and educa
tion at Vaden. a referral
to the Office of Judicial
Affairs or a residence
reassignment.

"I think it's important
to remind upper-class stu-

dents to continue to make respon
sihle decisions regarding alcohol.
Castro said, "and to intervene
they see a friend putting him c
herself at risk."
