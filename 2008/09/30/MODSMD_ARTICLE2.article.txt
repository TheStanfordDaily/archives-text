# Drinking problematic during NSO
## Four alcohol-related transports reported during NSO; Bob residents notified of possible alcohol probation 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A handful of alcohol-related emergency
transports — including one from a freshman
dorm — occurred during New Student
Orientation (NSO), violating the
University's NSO alcohol policy and
prompting administrators to put one Row
house under review for alcohol probation.
Four incidents of alcohol over-consump
tion requiring emergency service trans

portation to the hospital occurred between
Sept. 15 and 21, according to statistics pro
vided by the Stanford Department of Public
Safety (SDPS). Three of these transports
"were from areas around (associated with) a
student residence," while one transport took
place from inside a freshman dorm.
"The Freshmen Dean's Office, in con
junction with Residential Education, takes
seriously any reports that new students have
engaged in high-risk drinking," said
Assistant Dean of Freshmen Koren

Bakkegard in an email to The Daily.
Residential Education staff sent an email
on Sept. 18 to all student residents on the
Row saying it had received reports of unau
thorized gatherings with alcohol being held
in a few houses during NSO.
"We have already received reports of a
handful of alcohol-related hospital trans
ports and unsanctioned events with alcohol
hosted in Row houses," the email stated.
"These events ... are jeopardizing the Row
privilege outlined in the NSO policy. If you.

as residents of the Row, do not take this pol
icy seriously, listen to your staff and behave
responsibly, the University will revoke the
privilege for which the Row residents before
you have worked so hard."
The email, which had the text of the NSO
alcohol policy attached, was sent to all stu
dent residents on the Row two days after
NSO began.
Ralph Castro, manager of the Substance
Abuse Prevention Program at Vaden Health
Center and co-chair of the Stanford Alcohol

Advisory Board, said in an email to The
Daily that high-risk, alcohol-related inci
dents tend to cluster around the first few
weeks after students return to campus.
"There were some incidents that origi
nated from the Row this year that were
higher [in number] than in past years,"
Castro said.
The NSO alcohol policy prohibits any
Stanford student from providing, serving or
