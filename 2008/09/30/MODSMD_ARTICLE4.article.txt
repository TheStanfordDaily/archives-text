# SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING
## Engineering courses offered online for public 
### ALAN GUO 
Following the trend of MlT's Open
Courseware and other top schools' trend
toward universal education, Stanford now
offers some of its most popular classes in
the School of Engineering through a free
online program called Stanford
Engineering Everywhere (SEE).
The pilot program currently offers ten
classes from the computer science and elec
trical engineering departments â€” among

them CS 1()6A and 1068, Introduction to
Robotics and two classes on optimization.
Along with other research universities,
Stanford is making the work of its engineer
ing faculty more accessible to the public.
And unlike past efforts, such as You lube
recordings of events and lectures on iTunes.
SEE provides full course content.
"One key distinction about our program
is that we provide the complete package,"
said Andy DiPaolo, SEE program director.
"It has everything you need, the lecture

notes and videos."
DiPaolo pointed out that MlT's and
other schools' shared coursework initiatives
often involve only syllabi and lecture notes
or segmented videos, which largely hinder
the experience of distant learners.
Stanford's motivations for undertaking
SEE began with a desire to reach out to the
global community.
"['lbis is] part of our public service mis
sion," DiPaolo said."We want to share intel
lectual works to people who might other-

wise not be able to come
to Stanford."
While SEE could
give students a sense I
of what Stanford
classrooms are like, <
the online video
streams are not equiva-

lent to a real-time class
room setting.
