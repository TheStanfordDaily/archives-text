# SCHOOL OF ENGINEERING
## Engineering courses offered online for public 
### ALAN GUO 
Following the trend of MlT's Open
Courseware and other top schools' trend
toward universal education, Stanford now
offers some of its most popular classes in
the School of Engineering through a free
online program called Stanford
Engineering Everywhere (SEE).
The pilot program currently offers ten
classes from the computer science and elec
trical engineering departments — among

them CS 1()6A and 1068, Introduction to
Robotics and two classes on optimization.
Along with other research universities,
Stanford is making the work of its engineer
ing faculty more accessible to the public.
And unlike past efforts, such as You lube
recordings of events and lectures on iTunes.
SEE provides full course content.
"One key distinction about our program
is that we provide the complete package,"
said Andy DiPaolo, SEE program director.
"It has everything you need, the lecture

notes and videos."
DiPaolo pointed out that MlT's and
other schools' shared coursework initiatives
often involve only syllabi and lecture notes
or segmented videos, which largely hinder
the experience of distant learners.
Stanford's motivations for undertaking
SEE began with a desire to reach out to the
global community.
"['lbis is] part of our public service mis
sion," DiPaolo said."We want to share intel
lectual works to people who might other-

wise not be able to come
to Stanford."
While SEE could
give students a sense I
of what Stanford
classrooms are like, <
the online video
streams are not equiva-

lent to a real-time class
room setting.

"Fundamentally, it's like if you
bought a textbook by the faculty, but
you are not interacting with the fac
ulty." Di Paolo said.
He suggested that this key dis
tinction would attract people who
took the SEE courses to come to
Stanford.
According to Di Paolo, an addi
tional benefit of the program is that
it provides other universities a
model of an established, well-taught
curriculum.
"So say a small, less-resourceful
university in India needs to offer an
introductory class in programming,"
he said. "The professor can just take
everything on the SEE Web site and
make it his own curriculum."
The School of Engineering hopes
to expand the program, depending
upon initial reactions and feedback.
In the meantime, copyright issues
pose hurdles to further growth,
because although Stanford students
can view video lectures of many
classes in the department, "[the pro

gram] needs to have copyright clear
ances from publishers before the
videos become public," DiPaolo
explained.
Still, SEE has received a positive
response from its wider public audi
ence. Yoftahe Fisseha. an Ethiopian
student who discovered SEE on
Digg. a shared-interest community
Web site, applauded SEE in a
Facebook message.
" The lecture videos are awe
some," he wrote, "particularly the
different formats (the You Tube and
(BitTorrentj). Transcripts help if you
can't hear what the lecturer is saying
... the course materials are well
organized. and we can download the
whole material on file, which is
great."
Di Paolo also suggested using
online communities like Facebook
as a way to get feedback from stu
dents like Fisseha.
The SEE program marks a new
beginning in the long history of
Stanford's distant-learning efforts.
The University began offering tel
evised lectures to industries in
1969.
