## Stanford expands to Redwood City Satellite campus to house admin offices 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
A version of this article originally
ran Thursday, Aug. 7. Updates have
been appended for this issue.
At 8,180 acres, Stanford has the
largest contiguous university cam
pus in America — and a planned
off-campus expansion means that
it's only about to get bigger. With
usable space on campus running
out, a 1.5 million-square foot
Redwood City expansion is in the
works.
The University has already
purchased and submitted plans for
a 33-acre satellite campus
between Broadway and Highway
101 in Redwood City. These 33
acres, in addition to the 11-acre
outpatient medical facility that is
currently being constructed in the
same plot, will become part of a
larger, 46-acre "Stanford in
Redwood City" campus, located at
Midpoint Technology Park.
Larry Horton. the University's
director of government and com
munity relations, explained that
the establishment of a satellite
campus comes from the
University's desire to prioritize
on-campus space.
"The on-campus core space is
limited and extremely precious."
Horton said. "The priority for
core, on-campus space should be
teaching and research. Thus, some
important University activities
that can be performed off-campus
will be relocated to the Redwood
City campus."
Stanford has submitted a
design plan to the Redwood City
Planning Commission calling for
the existing buildings on the pur
chased 33 acres to be replaced
with 13 new buildings for adminis
trative offices, research and devel
opment and medical clinic uses.
Though plans for con-

struction on the North Campus
are still being discussed between
the University and the Redwood
City Council, some administrative
functions are already being moved
away from campus.
University offices located in
655 and 656 Serra Street on the
Stanford campus have already
been relocated to the Stanford
Research Park, west of El Camino
Real. The spaces cleared by 655
and 656 Serra Street will be used
for the construction of new build
ings for the Graduate School of
Business.
Horton emphasized University
personnel relocated to Redwood
City are not being shunned to off
campus locations.
"Stanford wants to construct
good quarters in Redwood City
and make it highly desirable for
staff to be there," Horton said.
"We want the satellite campus to
be a true extension to the core
campus. The office buildings con
structed there will have many
amenities, including child care, a
gym. et cetera."
Furthermore, Stanford hopes
to become a contributing member
of the Redwood City community
once that campus is established.
Stanford's project proposal was
submitted to Redwood City in late
May. In August, the Redwood Cit\
council approved moving forward
with the planning process.
With residential and light
industrial areas bordering the
North Campus plot, however, a
number of concerns will still have
to be addressed before any con
struction can begin.
"Of course we will confront
different issues, such as environ
mental impact reports and con
cerns about traffic." Horton said.
" But we are confident that we will
be able to determine these
impacts, re-examine the project
and correctly address them.
Stanford's presence in Redwood
City will be a positive one."
