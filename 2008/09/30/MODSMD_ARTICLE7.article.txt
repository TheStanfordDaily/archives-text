No, radio isn't just about news and sports broad
casts â€” particularly when it comes to KZSU, Stan
ford's own public radio station (90.1 FM).
Run by about a dozen student volunteers and var
ious community members, KZSU is a freeform sta
tion, which means that it has no overarching sched
ule. This, naturally, encourages the deejays to have
some fun.
"KZSU is by far the most out-there community
on campus," said general manager Sammy Franco
'09. "There are a lot of community members in
volved, some fulfilling their community service, and
others whose favorite music is the sound of their own
voice."
For example, one man regularly went on air to
protest the British tariffs in the pre-revolutionary
war days. Another, known as Ragnar of Ravensfjord,
had a regular history of metal show called "Blood
stains Across Atherton."
On a recent night at the station, Franco and some
friends read plays written by robots in 1984 over the
air,and Franco then promptly went on to host a show
filled with aquatic dolphin noises.
KZSU hosts a few regularly scheduled shows,
such as Wednesday Night Live, which features local
Bay Area bands who broadcast from the station.
Each deejay also has a regular weekly show, during
which he can play any type of music that he likes.
Franco hosts two shows, one on Wednesdays from
9 a.m. to 2 p.m., called "The Orangeasm," and anoth
er late-night show called 'The Dronegasm." his in
somniac show.
"KZSU has had a host of great insomniacs." Fran
co said."lt also has hands-down the best collection of
experimental music on the West Coast."
In particular. KZSU recently received music from
a Croatian music label. Slusajnaglasine. which fea
tures Croatian punk, experimental and hip-hop.
While deejays are essentially free to play anything
that strikes their fancy, they are required to play
some music from their current collection of new CDs.
Franco has three recent favorites: a Johnny Cash-
Jay-Z collaboration.an Italian accordion quartet and
a Smithsonian collection of ancient and classic mar
itime songs.
"I have developed a lexicon in sea shanties." Fran
co said.
For students interested in deejaying for the sta
tion, KZSU has an informational meeting and broad
casting class tonight at K p.m. at its home in the base
ment of MemAud. KZSU's broadcasts can be heard
in San Francisco and San Jose, and they reach most of
the Bay Area. Fans can also listen to live music
streaming off of KZSU.stanford.edu.
"We will be broadcasting that there is still human
life through our emergency transmitter after the
nuke attack." Franco said."This is some totally gonzo
shit."
Oh, and by the way. Franco added, "everyone
should listen to more Prince."
