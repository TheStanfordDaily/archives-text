## Editorial Alcohol policy poorly communicated 
### 
The New Student Orientation drinking
policy at Stanford is simple: NSO is a
dry week on campus.The only excep
tions are Row houses, which may hold "up to
two sanctioned, resident-only gatherings
where alcohol is served — beer or wine only,
no hard liquor," according to an email sent
to Row residents on Thursday. Sept. 18.
Stanford employs alcohol policies —
such as that for NSO — that are oftentimes
much more forgiving and understanding
than those of peer universities. Most Stan
ford students are overwhelmingly in favor of
the way that Stanford handles the issue of al
cohol consumption, and the editorial board
shares that view.
While we would like to applaud the fore
sight on the part of the University to allow
upperclassmen over 21 living on the Row a
few alcohol privileges during an otherwise
entirely dry week, we must also point out the
shortcomings of the policy's implementa
tion. Despite such a straightforward policy,
there were a number of alcohol-related inci
dents during NSO. and many Row residents
were left feeling blindsided by the NSO al
cohol policy.
The implementation of the NSO policy
earlier this month had some fatal tlaws. For
instance, the policy was distributed to all res
idential staff during their training, but the
staff in many houses, for one reason or an
other. did not make this policy and conse
quences of violating it explicitly clear to res
idents before the start of NSO.
The NSO alcohol policy was distributed
to all Row residents with a subject reading
"NSO: IMPORTANT" on Thursday of that
week. NSO activities, however, had started
on Tuesday. Band Run — the hallmark
event of the first night of NSO and the event
at which there were purportedly a number
of students drinking (see today's Daily story
"Drinking problematic during NSO") —
occurred two days before housing directly

contacted Row residents about the NSO al
cohol policy.
The email sent to Row residents on Sept.
18 insists that "the privilege for which the
Row residents before you have worked so
hard." that is, the privilege of being able to
host two staff-organized gatherings, came
about on the part of previous Row residents
and staff. If this is the case, why did staff not
further strive to make sure that each and
every one of their residents was well-versed
in the policy?
Furthermore, given that the University
plans to thoroughly uphold this policy, refer
all violations to relatively high authorities
and "follow ... up with individual students
who cause problems on a case by case basis,"
why did Residential Education staff wait to
send the text of the NSO policy until two
days into orientation, two days after a hand
ful of students had already landed in emer
gency medical situations related to alcohol?
Residential Education should have contact
ed Row students — many of whom are
sophomores living there for the first time —
about the policy prior to NSO, rather than
depending on staff to convey the second
hand message.
Clearly, there is much progress to be
made. If the University intends to thorough
ly uphold alcohol policies such as the NSO
policy and penalize those who violate said
policies, the University also has a responsi
bility to ensure that the students who could
perpetrate such violations and then be pe
nalized for them are well-versed in the poli
cies themselves.
Stanford University should have made
sure to very, very clearly email each return
ing student living on campus the explicit text
of the NSO policy. Though we applaud the
alcohol policies of the University, there is
much room for improvement regarding the
distribution and subsequent implementa
tion of these policies.
