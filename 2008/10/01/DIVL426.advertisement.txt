"How I Write" is a series of conversations with faculty and other advanced writers to explore the nuts and
bolts, pleasures and pains, of all types of writing While content is always an issue, the conversation will
primarily focus on work styles, such as where, when, and how a writer composes allowing us to examine
habits, idiosyncrasies, techniques, trade secrets, hidden anxieties, and delights. We will discuss how a writer
generates ideas, sustains large-scale projects, combines research with composition overcomes various
impediments and blocks, and cultivates stylistic innovations.
