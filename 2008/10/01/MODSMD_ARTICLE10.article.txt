In general, crime was up from the
previous year, with increases in the
number of aggravated assault cases,
burglary, arson, bike theft and
forcible sexual offenses.
Liquor law violations were

noticeably up as well, with 61 cam
pus citations compared to 50 in
2006. Drug violations also increased,
but remained low compared to alco

just three drug violations last year,
up from zero in the prior year.

represent students, but any offense,
citation or arrest on campus.
