## Calorie counts required Chain restaurants in California affected by bill 
### ASHLEY SURDIN ASSOCIATED PRESS 
LOS ANGELES â€” Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger signed a bill
Tuesday requiring chain restaurants
to put calorie counts on their menus
and indoor menu boards, making
California the first state to enact
such a law in the battle against
America's expanding waist line.
The law requires restaurant
chains with 20 or more locations -
more than 17,000 statewide - to
post the information by the year
2011. Starting in July of next year,
restaurants and drive-throughs will
have to offer customers brochures
listing each menu item's calories,
saturated fat, carbohydrates and
sodium.
Restaurants that violate the

rules can be fined between $50 and
$500 by county health department
officials.
Schwarzenegger said the legis
lation was part of the state's push
to set a national model for nutri
tion policy and to fight obesity,
which costs the state $28.6 billion
in health care, lost productivity
and workers' compensation.
"When I was in the Austrian
Army. I drove a tank that weighed
50 tons. Now multiple that by 3.500
that's as many pounds as
California has gained" in the last
decade. Schwarzenegger said at a
news conference outside a Chili's
restaurant. "This legislation will
help Californians make more
informed, healthier choices by
making calorie information easily
accessible at thousands of restau
rants throughout the state."
Much of the state's focus on fos
tering a healthier California has
been directed toward schools,
where junk food, soda and trans fat

have been removed or are being
phased out and replaced by fruits
and vegetables.
Legislation similar to the
California law has been green
lighted in cities across the country,
including New York. Seattle and
San Francisco. Proposals are pend
ing several others, including
Chicago, Washington D.C. and
Philadelphia.
All are part of a movement to
educate consumers and allow them
make healthier choices, said Margo
Wootan. nutrition policy director at
the i.onprofit Center for Science in
the Public Interest, which has advo
cated for menu labeling nation
wide. The effort has gathered steam
in the last two years, she said.
Nationwide, about 78 percent of
Americans believe fast-food and
other chain restaurants should list
nutritional information, according
to a 2008 poll by the Caravan
Opinion Research Corp.. a market
research firm.
