## Editorial Mental health report needs more specifics 
### 
The editorial board is pleased to see the
release of the Student Mental Health
and Weil-Being Task Force Report,
which we hope will draw attention to cam
pus mental health. Though we are glad that
the University is giving much-deserved at
tention to this issue, much remains to be
done. Nearly two years have passed since the
task force convened, but the report provides
few specifics on the next steps Stanford
should take. We were expecting more.
The task force devotes much of the re
port to exploring the mental health issues
that students face, discussing issues like
pressure to appear happy ("the duck syn
drome") and addressing the importance of
friends, family and advisors. While we agree
that outlining such issues is a necessary first
step for this kind of report, we worry that the
University devoted more time to observa
tions and less time to results. The report
notes,"ln arguably its most surprising obser
vation. the Task Force discovered that aca
demic success is not a reliable indicator of
emotional well-being." We are concerned
that it took the University two years to real
ize what the average Stanford student could
explain in two minutes.
Our greatest concern is that there are few
tangible initiatives discussed in the report.
The authors make only a few direct propos
als, such as incorporating depression screen
ing in primary care medicine and creating a
Website to address mental health initiatives.
We presumed that the task force took all
these months to come up with concrete
changes, hut the report is vague in its recom
mendations for how mental health resources
can be improved. The study makes many
suggestions without discussing a means of
implementation. It notes that we should re
duce the stigma of mental health on campus,
but offers few methods to do so. Simply say
ing that we need further educational initia
tives isn't enough.
Rather, the report focuses on the creation
of even more committees — an oversight
committee to oversee mental health initia

tives, a working group related to academic
initiatives aimed at reducing stress, a com
mittee to evaluate information sharing poli
cies among offices, a committee to study
mental health leaves of absences, a review of
New Student Orientation, etc. We had
hoped that this report would outline the
changes it expects these committees to sug
gest. We are concerned how much more time
will pass, how many students will lack re
sources. before we start to see concrete re
sults.
We were in particular hoping to see
sweeping changes regarding broad reform
of CAPS and detailed plans for Residential
Education resources, perhaps the two most
important resources for students with
mental health concerns. But Residential
Education has little mention in the study,
and discussions of CAPS reform did not
meet our expectations. We are glad that the
University realized CAPS is experiencing
an unprecedented demand for services, but
we expected real solutions for students
hoping to receive long-term care through
CAPS or find shorter waiting lines when
trying to make an appointment.The report
suggests that CAPS provide one profes
sional staff member to every 1.000 to 1,500
students, a goal recommended by the In
ternational Association of Counseling Ser
vices. We are glad that the report notes ad
ditional CAPS counselors will be hired
soon to curb issues related to staff avail
ability. but we are concerned that these ef
forts are not enough. Stanford should not
be working toward a baseline standard, but
exceeding it instead.
We are glad that the University released
this report, even if we are unsatisfied with
current progress. Any step relating to im
proving mental health and acknowledging
campus problems is an important step. Hut
we hope the University does not simply
revel in the positive press it's likely to re
ceive for forming the task force and giving
this report. Admitting that work needs to be
done is not enough. We need solutions.
