## The politics of Palin
### 
We've seen a remarkable
shift in this year's race for
president since Governor
Sarah Palin joined in as John Mc-
Cain's running mate, a pick that was
cynically announced after Obama's
acceptance speech at the Democrat
ic National Convention. Her selec
tion resulted in an immediate in
crease in enthusiasm for McCain's
campaign, which took the lead in
opinion polls surrounding the Re
publican National Convention the
following week. Obama's subse
quent decline in the polls triggered a
great deal of panic and fear among
supporters and members of the De
mocratic Party.
In the past two weeks, however,
public opinion of Palin. and the Mc-
Cain-Palin ticket, has swung the
other direction. It is rare to see such
a large change in public opinion this
late in an election season. Admitted
ly. much of the McCain campaign's
decline in polls, from a 2-3 point lead
to a 5-7 point deficit, has been due to
the financial crisis, which the Ameri
can people have mostly blamed —
albeit wrongly — on the Republi
cans. Barack Obama is now in the
strongest position to win since Sena
tor Hillary Clinton dropped out of
the Democratic primary.
It's hard to imagine that the elec
tion is in the position that it current
ly is. Ibere was once an identifiable
"Palin bounce" in the polls, and she
initially had very strong approval rat
ings that injected new life into a flag
ging McCain campaign. Americans
viewed her as fresh and sassy, but
that initial charm began to wear off
quickly as she interacted with the
press. Her speech at the Republican
National Convention was blistering
ly partisan, and while it thrilled the
base, it did not go over well with in
dependents.
Her recent multi-part interview
with Katie Couric. who is not nor
mally viewed as a tough interviewer,
was filled with awkward, canned an
swers. In the final part of the inter
view. which will air later this week,

Palin was not able to name a single
Supreme Court case when asked.
Although she has continued to
energize the "base," moderate voters
in swing states have a particularly
low opinion of her. In Colorado, a
PPP poll reported the number of
people saying Palin's selection
makes them less likely to vote for
McCain is 47 percent; only 38 per
cent say it makes them more likely.
For independent Colorado vot
ers. 56 percent say Palin makes them
less likely to vote for McCain. Be
cause of Palin's strikingly weak ap
peal to independent voters,some Re
publicans have even talked of re
moving her from the ticket. It has
now become clear that Palin is drag
ging McCain down, something that
few could have predicted several
weeks ago.
Such a removal, however, seems
both unlikely and unwise. McCain's
campaign is already something of a
circus; the recent suspension of his
campaign to "work" on the financial
crisis was widely looked down upon
in polls. His campaign would release
"advertisements" upon which the
media would comment, only later re
alizing that they had been duped
with fake clips never scheduled to
run.
McCain's debate performance, al
though strong, was also remarkably
condescending. McCain told Barack
Obama that he did not "understand"
nine times during the 92-minute de
bate. Removing Palin from the ticket
would only make the campaign look
less serious than it already is.
So McCain is stuck with Palin. for
better or worse. As the world has re
vealed itself to be startlingly complex
this fall, even moreso than we imag

ined. the simplistic Palin has proven
to be a tone-deaf pick from someone
who prides herself on making the
"right decisions." Among voters
highly concerned with the economy
and the financial crisis, McCain has
been losing badly, and one can't help
to wonder whether an articulate
business-savvy pick like Mitt Rom
ney would have helped McCain reas
sure voters about his ability to han
dle the economy.
11l is has been one of the fastest
changing campaigns in recent mem
ory. with significant swings in public
opinion. On the weekend of Palin's
announcement, a few Republican
dissidents said that the pick doomed
the McCain campaign. They were
ridiculed then, but they may very
well be right.
As her unfavorable ratings con
tinue to rise and interview gaffes ac
cumulate, McCain's angst must only
increase. He knew he took a gamble,
picking someone risky instead of
playing it safe with Tim Pawlenty or
Mitt Romney, and it does not seem
like the gamble is paying off. Admit
tedly, "media fatigue" probably had
something to do with it — the
media's coverage of Palin has been
exhaustive and wall-to-wall, which
probably turned some voters away
from McCain-Palin.
Considering how much he trails in
tracking polls, McCain needs to
make another bold move to have a
chance at winning the White House.
His boldest move thus far, that of
picking Palin, has clearly not yet paid
off, and the opportunities to make
another eye-catching decision are
declining by the day. Knocking Palin
off the ticket would certainly be a
bold move, but it would most likely
do more harm than good. On the
other hand, he could always pick me
— I've been waiting for his phone
call since May.
