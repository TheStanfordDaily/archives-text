## How I (re)learned to ride a bike

Whoever made up that asi
nine cliche, "It's like riding
a bicycle." to connote a skill
that we could never forget clearly
didn't do their research. Lies, I say.
All lies. I once knew how to ride a
hike. I used to glide around my giant
backyard on my hot pink wheels with
my white streamers blowing in the
wind and my pet snail Timmy resting
snugly in my pink and white cross
hatched basket. Eventually, the
training wheels were removed as
they are in every young child's form
ative years, and I glided onwards
with Timmy in tow.
Sometime in between Timmy's
death and the onset of puberty, I
just lost interest in riding. I think I
was first turned off after I saw my
cousin careen off a bike and break
both of her arms. And then I never
even considered biking after I
moved to Florida, where there's a
high chance you'll get run over by
an elderly person in a 1992 Cadillac
DeVille if you cycle too far from
your driveway.
The summer before I came to
college, a few of my friends tried to
re-teach me to ride a bike so that I
could be a "real" Stanford student.
Because they were so confident
that I would remember how to ride
the moment I got on a bicycle again,
they didn't listen to my complaints
that a) I was wearing flimsy flip
flops, b) we were on a sidewalk near
a busy street, c) it was pitch dark
out. Needless to say. when we gave
up an hour later, all I had learned
was that my muscle memory sucks
and that I bruise really easily if I fall
on pavement repeatedly.
Contrary to my friends' con
cerns. my inability to ride a bike has
never caused me problems at Stan
ford. I naturally walk way too fast. I
like to interact with people. Plus, I
don't have to spend time locking
and unlocking a bike, and I don't
get yelled at by that overzealous

traffic dude who shouts at people
when they go the wrong way around
the intersection of death.
Although I don't plan on chang
ing my walking lifestyle, I recently
realized that biking is an important
skill to have under my belt, much
like swimming, driving and reading
chapter books — all of which I have
mastered.
So I called on my friend Susan,
whom I've known since kinder
garten. If you have to embarrass
yourself with someone, it's best to
choose an individual who has seen
you eat paste. And pick your nose.
Preferably at the same time. Any
way. Susan teaches small children io
play the violin, so I knew she'd have
the proper amount of patience to
educate a not-so-small child in the
art of bicycle riding.
On Saturday morning, we met up
on the residential road on the far
side of Mayfield Play field, the
smallish patch of grass across from
Haus Mitt. We started at 9:30 — too
early for sloshballers to gawk at me
or bowl me over.
It took me awhile just to get used
to sitting on the hike. Those seats
really aren't that comfortable.Then
I learned the basics. Brakes, steer
ing, etc. We went back and forth
along the street for almost an hour,
with Susan in front, facing me and
holding on to the handles and hack
ing up slowly as I got used to ped
dling.
My biggest problem was balancing.
Despite my political inclinations, I
kept veering right, taking poor
Susan along with me. I low humiliat
ing.
A man passed by, laughed and
offered some strange advice about

pulling me from the back with a
towel? That's how he had taught his
kids, he said. Yeah. sir. unfortunate
ly I don't weigh 40 pounds anymore.
Thanks, though.
I le actually turned out to be sort
of right. I did a lot better when
Susan started to lightly hold on to
the back of the bike, because there
was that illusion that she wasn't
there and I was, you know, actually
biking. It felt like I was in that clas
sic episode of "Full Mouse" where
Joey teaches Michelle how to ride a
bike at the park. I tried to channel
my inner Olson twin, but I still
couldn't quite get it the way she
could.
As I grunted away, an elderly
lady gracefully hiked by. "You can
do it, you can do it," I whispered
under my breath as I wiped my
sweaty hands on my jeans and
glared at her enviously.
An hour and a half had passed,
and it was getting reaily hot. .Susan
decided that the only thing keeping
me from getting it on my own was
my lear of falling. It's high up there
on that seat! So I convinced her to
let me try on the grass even though
it'd be harder to pedal there. She
pushed me off and I was soaring.
Sort of."l'm biking!" I shouted until
I fell live yards later. Susan beamed
at me like a proud parent, and then
we did it one more time, without me
falling. Hello, Tour de France.
I here is something wonderfully
humbling about sucking so badly at
something and then finally getting
it. How's that for an eloquent
proverb? As we get older, we are
sadly deprived of that exhilarating
sense ol primitive accomplishment
that we constantly have when we
are younger. I have to say, I'm glad
that I forgot how to ride a bike...al
though my buttocks now ache every
time I sit down.

Natalie Jabbar wants to thank Sttsan
for not giving up on Iter. Email njabbar
"at Stanford.edit if yon want to sign
up to teach her how to pop a wheelie.
