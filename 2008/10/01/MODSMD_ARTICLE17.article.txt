## Versatile Lichtman embraces variety of roles 
### BY DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
Her name might not be Barboza, Kline
man or Akinradewo. She might not
have the All-American and na
tional status that some elite

players have. But she does

have an excellent sense for everything

volleyball — and she is a vital part of

the Stanford team.

Her name is Cassidy Lichtman,a

sophomore from just outside San

Diego, Calif. Lichtman has been

around the volleyball court since

she could walk, traveling with

her mom. a volleyball coach.

She has been playing club vol-

leyball since she was 10 years

old. and her play and feel

for the game certainly
shows it.

Lichtman was recruited"

out of high school as an out-

side hitter and defensive spe- 1

cialist. Last year in her fresh-

man campaign, she played back

row and on the left and right side'

as a hitter. Unlike many freshmen.

she was virtually unfazed as she en-

tered her first collegiate match.

"Stepping on the court for my firs!

collegiate match was actually less nerve

wracking than I thought it would be." Licht-*

man said."The returning players made it easy !

for me to step in and play with them."

Although Lichtman saw some action immedi-

ately at the beginning of last season, she saw signif-

icantly more playing time as the year went on. ancf
was an integral part of Stanford's NCAA run.

"By the time we reached the more intense matched

at the end of the year. 1 felt comfortable on the court, no
matter the situation." she said.

Lichtman points to the NCAA semifinals againstl
Southern California last year as her most memorable

match thus far. The showdown with USC was extremelylS
close as Stanford won in five sets: the way the Cardinal stayed!

in the game with all the tight plays was special for her.
Though Licht man already possessed a wide array of volley

ball skills and knowledge before coming to Stanford, playing i
with senior All-Americans Cynthia Barboza and Foluke Akin
radewo has helped her own game even more.

"Cynthia and Foluke have influenced my game extensively,"
she said. "I have learned so much from both of them, and 1 have
really benefited from playing alongside them every day becaus*

they elevate the level of play so much.
"Just watching them teaches me so much about the game,

Lichtman added.
No position was specified in her introduction because, wel

Lichtman goes from hitter to setter to back
row throughout the match, and is nearly
flawless in the transitions

she doesn't play just one. She might not put up head
line stats but she is all over the court and is relied on

to contribute in many different ways.

"Cassidy really understands a lot about

volleyball" head coach John Dunning said.
"She has a good feel for everything that hap-

pens around the court."

Perhaps her great knowledge and
feel for the game was a reason why after

the season Lichtman began learning a
new position: setter. With the departure of

Ail-American Bryn Kehoe '08. Lichtman

and junior Joanna Evans were faced with

assuming her role. Evans' main position is

setter, but Lichtman would join her in Stan

ford's new 6-2 offense (where the team uti-

Lizes two setters instead of one).

Dunning was confident that Lichtman could

catch on: he knew she had good coaching in high

school and on her club team, even in the back-

ground of being a setter.

Evans and Lichtman worked extensively starting

in January, practicing and working on the new of-

fense. They were very focused, doing everything from

drills and repetitions to just talking about setting and of-

fense.

' Lichtman goes from hitter to setter to back row
throughout the match.and she is nearly flawless in the tran
sitions.

"I am really enjoying being able to hit and set," Lichtman

said. "I did not set at all in high school.so we have been work-

ing on it [intensely]."

"She has always been needed to do those things [individual

lv] on her [club and high school] team," Dunning said of his
multi-faceted player. "Now she's doing all three."

I .ichtman has adapted to her new role nicely,and she and the
team is reaping the benefits. Up to this weekend, she is averaging
over five kills and 14 assists per match. Compare that to the entire
season last year, when Lichtman averaged just one kill per match
and had just 11 assists the entire season. She also leads the team
with five double-doubles on the year (having 10 or more in two
categories of assists, kills or digs in a single match). That produc
tion is contributing to Stanford's offensive proficiency thus far.
I .ichtman was pursued in high school by the likes of Stanford,
Washington and Minnesota — all perennial powerhouses in

women's volleyball. She wanted to come to Stanford, just like

many other student-athletes, because of its unique combination

of great academics and elite athletics. Her favorite part of being

with the Cardinal lies within the athletic realm

"My favorite part of Stanford has to be my teammates," she
said."! love them more than anything."
