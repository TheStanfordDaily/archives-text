## Women's golf falters at Mason Rudolph Championship to start 2008 season 
### 
The Stanford women's golf team started its sea
son off on a disappointing note as the Cardinal fin
ished 15th at the Mason Rudolph Championship
last weekend.
It was a step down from last year, when the
Stanford women placed 12th at the same tourna
ment with a 30-over-par.This season, the team fin
ished at plus-43, 57 shots behind the leader and
only seven shots ahead of last-place University of
Central Florida.
But the weekend was not completely lost for
the Cardinal, as two freshmen proved their mettle
against some of the country's top competition.
Sydney Burlison and Lila Barton were Stan
ford's top two golfers, placing 23rd and 39th. re
spectively. Burlison was the only Cardinal golfer to
finish a round below par — she led the team with a
one-under in Saturday's second round.
Senior Mari Chun, who has been Stanford's top
golfer for the past two seasons, finished the tourna
ment at plus-13, good for 56th place. The five
woman Cardinal squad was rounded out by soph
omore Rebecca Durham's plus-17 and senior Ki-
Shui Liao's plus-36.
It was a tough beginning to the year for Stan
ford, but the tournament pitted the team against
some of the best competition in the country, includ
ing No. 1 UCLA, No. 2 USC, No. 3 Arizona State
and No. 6 Vanderbilt. The Cardinal is currently
ranked No. 37.
But Stanford will have a chance to redeem itself
in two weeks when the squad heads to Washington
for its next tournament: the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invi
tational, where the team placed seventh last year.
The Cardinal won the Invitational in 2(X)6.
While no event could be classified as "must
win" at this point in the year, the team will need a
good showing in Washington and then at home at
the Stanford Intercollegiate to put itself in good
standing before the three-month winter break in
the middle of the season.
Overall, Stanford must work toward regaining
its 2006-2007 form, when it placed fifth at the
NCAA championships. Last season, the Cardinal
was eliminated in the West Regional after it lost a
playoff for the eighth and final championship spot.
Barton and Burlison should help the Stanford in
this endeavor, as they join a team nucleus that is
largely unchanged from last season. But it is also
the last hurrah for Chun and Liao.and the question
remains: Can they regain the success of the past?
Or are they destined for another early NCAA
exit?
Those questions and more will begin to be an
swered in the coming weeks.
