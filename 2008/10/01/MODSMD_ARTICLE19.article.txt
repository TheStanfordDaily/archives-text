## Deep Stanford team begins a season of redemption today 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis team begins
its 2008-09 campaign today at the
Riviera/ITA Women's All-American Cham
pionships. Though two years removed from
their last national title, the Cardinal women
are yearning for redemption.
After a rough 2007-08 season. Stanford
knows that it can no longer coast through its
opponents as in the past.
"I feel really good about our chances,"
sophomore Hilary Barte said. "I think we're
definitely working hard and making the most
out of everyday. In the end. it'll pay off. and if
it doesn't, we know we did everything we
could."
And the Cardinal certainly has a fighting
chance in every match with Barte at the top
of the lineup. In her freshman year. Barte
earned ITA National Rookie of the Year
honors with a 30-8 overall record and a 22-4
record in dual match play.
The hard-swinging lefty comes in at No. 4
in the ITA preseason singles rankings and
with a full year of experience under her belt.
"I feel good, definitely feel a little bit
older, a little more mature," Barte said. "I
know what to expect and I feel more com
fortable with college tennis."
Despite her strong play at the No. 1 spot,
Barte suffered through inopportune injuries
that may have hurt her preseason ranking,
high though it still is.
"No matter what my ranking is, I'd always
like to get better every day," Barte said.
"Ranking is just a number."
Rounding off the strong top half of the
lineup are two-time All-Americans senior
Jessica Nguyen and junior Lindsay Burdette.
As one of the veterans on the squad.
Nguyen comes in at No. 13 in the rankings
after compiling a 28-10 record last season, in
cluding 17-5 in dual match play. Burdette is
ranked No. 48 after an up-and-down year fol
lowing a strong freshman campaign.
Also ranked on the squad are sophomore
Carolyn McVeigh at No. 77 and sophomore
Jennifer Yen at No. 122. McVeigh finished 28-
10 with a 19-6 dual match record, while Yen
finished 17-9 overall.
Both Barte and Nguyen were selected to
play in this year's main singles draw.

And Stanford is no slouch in doubles play
either.
The Cardinal has two ranked duos. The
duo of Barte and Burdette holds down the
No. 5 spot as the Cardinal's top doubles team.
Meanwhile. Nguyen and incoming freshman
Logan Hansen are ranked No. 42 despite

having yet to play a match together.
Stanford has a solid squad that can cer
tainly contend for the national title with little
turnover from last year's squad.
However, a little help never hurt. This
