## Deep Stanford team begins a season of redemption today 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis team begins
its 2008-09 campaign today at the
Riviera/ITA Women's All-American Cham
pionships. Though two years removed from
their last national title, the Cardinal women
are yearning for redemption.
After a rough 2007-08 season. Stanford
knows that it can no longer coast through its
opponents as in the past.
"I feel really good about our chances,"
sophomore Hilary Barte said. "I think we're
definitely working hard and making the most
out of everyday. In the end. it'll pay off. and if
it doesn't, we know we did everything we
could."
And the Cardinal certainly has a fighting
chance in every match with Barte at the top
of the lineup. In her freshman year. Barte
earned ITA National Rookie of the Year
honors with a 30-8 overall record and a 22-4
record in dual match play.
The hard-swinging lefty comes in at No. 4
in the ITA preseason singles rankings and
with a full year of experience under her belt.
"I feel good, definitely feel a little bit
older, a little more mature," Barte said. "I
know what to expect and I feel more com
fortable with college tennis."
Despite her strong play at the No. 1 spot,
Barte suffered through inopportune injuries
that may have hurt her preseason ranking,
high though it still is.
"No matter what my ranking is, I'd always
like to get better every day," Barte said.
"Ranking is just a number."
Rounding off the strong top half of the
lineup are two-time All-Americans senior
Jessica Nguyen and junior Lindsay Burdette.
As one of the veterans on the squad.
Nguyen comes in at No. 13 in the rankings
after compiling a 28-10 record last season, in
cluding 17-5 in dual match play. Burdette is
ranked No. 48 after an up-and-down year fol
lowing a strong freshman campaign.
Also ranked on the squad are sophomore
Carolyn McVeigh at No. 77 and sophomore
Jennifer Yen at No. 122. McVeigh finished 28-
10 with a 19-6 dual match record, while Yen
finished 17-9 overall.
Both Barte and Nguyen were selected to
play in this year's main singles draw.

And Stanford is no slouch in doubles play
either.
The Cardinal has two ranked duos. The
duo of Barte and Burdette holds down the
No. 5 spot as the Cardinal's top doubles team.
Meanwhile. Nguyen and incoming freshman
Logan Hansen are ranked No. 42 despite

having yet to play a match together.
Stanford has a solid squad that can cer
tainly contend for the national title with little
turnover from last year's squad.
However, a little help never hurt. This

year, the Cardinal lineup will fea
ture three new freshmen, highlight
ing a new youth movement in the
squad. Hansen, Courtney Clayton
and Veronica Li represent a talented
incoming class that looks to bring
Stanford back to the top.
Both Hansen and Li come from
Southern California and grew up
with Barte.
"They're really good players,"
Barte said. "Logan was unbeliev
able, winning all sorts of nationals as
a junior."
Clayton should also be a familiar

name to Cardinal tennis fans. She is
the younger sister of sophomore
Alex Clayton of the men's team,
who led the Cardinal at the No. 1
spot all of last season.
"Courtney won clay courts last
year, so she's capable of high accom
plishments," Barte said.
Certainly, Stanford looks to be in
good shape as it heads into the first
major tournament of the season.
The All-American Championships
is one of four main tournaments in
the fall season, and it may be the
toughest challenge yet for a rebuild
ing squad.
If the two-year national title
drought seems long, the Cardinal
women have not had a singles title at
the championships since 1990.
Moreover, their last doubles title

came in 2()(M).
More had luck struck yesterday,
as Burdette retired from her qualify
ing round match against Danielle
Steinberg of Arizona. Burdette was
trailing 3-6. 6-4, 4-3, though the in
jury is not expected to be major.
"I hope she's okay," Barte said of
her doubles partner.
The two are slated to play in the
main doubles draw.
This season, the Cardinal com
bines a potent mix of young talent
and veteran leadership that can cer
tainly make some noise in the tennis
world.
"I think we're looking really
good," Barte finished.
