# Mental health task force releases awaited report
## 
### JULIE KLEIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
One and a half years after Provost John
Etehemendy convened the Student
Mental Health and Well-Being Task Force,
the committee's findings on student men
tal health needs were made public today.
In the 88-page report available online, the
task force makes 18 recommendations to
help the University and community tackle
mental health issues on campus.
"This is really just the beginning of the
next phase of our work," said Vice Provost
for Student Affairs Greg Boardman. who
served as chair of the 48-member task
force. "We hope for a transparent, open
process."
In order to maintain transparency.
Boardman said that there will soon be a
comment section on the task force Web

site (www.stanford.edu/group/mhwh),
allowing community members to post
reactions to the report itself and to the
progress made in the coming months. An
oversight committee, comprised of six to
eight faculty, staff and students members,
will also follow up on the recommenda
tions. and quarterly updates will be avail
able on the site.
"This is part of the ongoing process to
engage the community fully." Boardman
added.
According to the report, the most sur
prising observation for the task force was
the apparent disconnect between academ
ic success and mental well-being.
"Simply because students are perform
ing well academically doesn't mean that all
is well for them," said Alejandro Martinez,
co-chair of the Campus Climate Study
Group and senior associate director of

Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS). "That is significant for us to real
ize."
Increased academic support — for all
students, regardless of academic success —
is one of the recommendations made in
response to the nine tasks outlined by
Etchemendy in fall 2006. The task force,
comprised of the Campus Climate Study
Group and the Policy and Practice Review
Committee, also recommended establish
ing an emergency fund to bolster the
resources available at CAPS.
Boardman said a number of new CAPS
staff members, including a physician, psy
chologist, case manager, social worker and
additional counselors, have already been
hired.
When asked if students will have a bet
ter chance of repeatedly meeting with the
same counselor — a concern raised by stu

dents in the past — Martinez said obsta
cles may still exist.
"Often a student's schedule may not
match up with [a particular counselor's]
availability." Martinez said. "That will con
tinue to be a challenge."
Still. Boardman acknowledged that the
increase in staff allows CAPS to fulfill the
student-to-staff ratio recommended by the
International Association of Counseling
Services. Martinez added that students can
now speak with a counselor within one day
of their initial call, at which time a coun
selor will assess the severity of a student's
situation and schedule appointments
accordingly.
The task force report comes at a time
when stress levels are high — both on
campus and nationwide — among stu-

Stats from the Student Mental Health
and Weil-Being Task Force Report
Based on a telephone survey of 2,196 Stanford students in
2007-08:
23.4% experienced depressed mood, often
transiently, in the previous month
3.2% met the diagnostic criteria for Major
Depressive Disorder in the post month
32.9% experienced High levels of stress
In their lifetime...
11.7% of students had thought of suicide,
usually transiently _____
1.6% had thought of a plan
1 1 .7% had attempted to end their own lives
dents of the "Millenial Generation."
Iliese students, born between the
early 1980s and late 19905, live in "a
highly pressured, overly scheduled
and high-achieving environment
where much is expected." according
to the report.
Stanford students are no excep
tion to this nationwide trend. A tele
phone survey conducted in 2(X)7 and
2008 of 2,196 Stanford students
found that 32.9 percent experience
high levels of stress, and 11.7 percent
had thought of suicide in their life
time. usually transiently.

Stanford's report follows reports
issued by other universities in recent
years. MIT, Harvard. Princeton and
Cornell all published reports
between 2001 and 2004. and the
University of California published a
report in Sept. 2006.
In response to questions about
Stanford's timing — the task force
convened when the University of
California published its report —
Martinez emphasized that the study
of mental health is an evolving
process.
"We used [previous] reports to

guide some of our efforts," he said.
"We also reviewed what hasn't been
done. It's hard to say who is first and
who is last."
"This is not a race," Boardman
added.
Policy and Practice Review
Committee Co-Chair Sally Dickson,
who serves as associate vice provost
for student affairs and dean of edu
cational resources, emphasized that
the task force is focused not only on
specific issues, but also on making
long-term improvements for the
Stanford community.

"One of the things we are talking
about is making a cultural change "
Dickson said.
Despite such long-term goals,
however, Boardman expects some
improvements to be made quickly.
'i certainly would be very disap
pointed if within the next year we
haven't made significant progress on
some of these," Boardman said of
the task force's recommendations.
"Let's make something happen."
