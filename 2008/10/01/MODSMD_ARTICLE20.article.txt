# Raiders' Davis hits a new low
## 
### 
It's official — they're done. For now.
for 2(X)9. for however long Al Davis
continues to run the Oakland
Raiders. Let Sept. 3(),2(X)8 forever stand
as the day when there was no longer
even the tiniest shred of hope for the
storied franchise of old.
More than any of the other greatest
laughingstock franchises around the
American sports scene — the Arizona
Cardinals, the Detroit Lions, the Pitts
burgh Pirates, the Kansas City Royals
or the Los Angeles Clippers — the
Raiders have descended to a new low.
Firing Lane Kiffin truly was the last
straw.
Consider first that they have done
this before — from the famed firing of
future Super Bowl-winning head
coach Mike Shanahan in to the
trade of Jon Ciruden. the Oakland
Raiders have been a coach's worst
nightmare for years. The mercurial
Davis is known to want things run his
way, and the coach who doesn't com
ply.even when it seems like it should be
well within his rights to do so. is soon
gone.
It's not that all these coaches are
good — far from it. in fact.The Raiders
have had their fair share of Bill Calla
hans and Art Shells. More, even. But
that's the problem; when your owner is
certifiablv crazy, he fires good and bad
coaches alike, before they have the
chance to prove which category
they're really in.
And yes. I said certifiably insane.
I'm no psychology major, but if you've
been following this whole Raiders
saga, and you still have any doubts,
check out the video feed of the press
conference yesterday, where Davis ex
plained why he fired Kiffin. I dare you
to find a more embarrassing sports
press conference in recent years.
Herm Edwards' "You play to win
the game" tirade? Not even close.
Denny Green's "They are who we
thought they were" rant? Ha. Mike
Gundy's "Come after me. I'm a man.
I'm 40"speech? Well,yeah.those were
also pretty bad.
But they don't have anything on
good ol' Al.
If there's a thimble's worth of ra
tional. coherent thought in the whole
of Davis' tirade yesterday. I guess I
missed it. So did Kiffin. who appeared
visibly upset when he spoke with
ESPN later that day. No coach de
serves to have his name dragged
through the mud in front of a nation
the way Kiffin's was. No one deserves
to be slandered so, in such a forum,
where friends, family and loved ones
can see.
Al Davis was, by most accounts,
never a very nice man. The stories of
his vindictiveness and paranoia date
back decades. But this is a new low. It
has to be. I've honestly never seen any
thing like it.
Believe it or not. it's pretty rare for
there to be this clear of a divide be
tween hero and villain in sports. But
after Al Davis ranted and railed, prac
tically foaming at the mouth as he de
cried every perceived injustice and
slight that the young head coach had
levied at his precious organization and
pride, Kiffin himself had his say. You
wouldn't have blamed him if he'd de
cided to fire back, get a little angry, or
just generally let the world know what
he really thought of his time with the
Raiders.
Instead, he was gracious in defeat
and public humiliation. He said he was
sorry that the Raiders weren't able to
get over the hump in his time with the
team, but lauded the progress his play
ers had made, predicting a big turn
around soon. In short, he was all class.
There was something to be admired in
that.That despite the fact he was never
really given a chance in only one year
on the job, despite the fact that his
team was improving, despite the fact
that his owner seemed more rabid than
end-of-the-movie Old Yeller (a name
that seems to thoroughly suit Davis
now), he was willing to just move on.
No need for retaliation. Kiffin carried
himself like a man who knew what he
was and didn't feel the need to explain
himself to anyone. Davis carried him
self like a lunatic, ranting to the world
that he was right and all of us were just
too blind to see it.
I think you, too, can probably al
ready see where this ends.
If Kiffin wasn't good enough for the
job, no one ever will be in A Is eyes. Kif
fin took the Raiders job only after so

many other, more qualified coaehes
turned it down (ineluding fellow USC
assistant Steve Sarkisian), began to
turn around the worst team in the
league to the point where it was com
petitive again just a year later and han
dled himself with the utmost dignity
through an ugly firing process.
None of that was enough to prove
his worth to an owner who is so far
past his prime, he couldn't see it from
the top of Al's Alps (a clever nick
name for the nosebleed seats in one of
the nation's worst venues, the Oak
land Coliseum).
Who. now, would take this job?
Who, now, would want it? What play
er with even a shred of desire to win a
championship would ever consider
signing with this franchise? Kiffin may
have been the one who was fired on
Monday, but it was Al Davis and his
Raiders who, for all intents and pur
poses, bit the dust.
So much for a commitment to ex
cellence. Even for the Raiders, this is a
new low. And that's what's really de
pressing.
And as for Kiffin? I somehow
doubt he'll have any trouble at all
finding work. I do know one thing:
Given the way he handled Al's mad
house, I'd be proud to have him run
ning my team anv day of the week.

Denis Griffin has just ensured that he
will never be employed by the Oakland
Raiders. Not that that's a bad thing.
