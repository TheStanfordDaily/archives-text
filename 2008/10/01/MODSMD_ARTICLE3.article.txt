## Role of SAT, ACT under scrutiny Yearlong study finds flaws in the two admissions tests 
### DAN HIRSCH 
High school seniors and their parents
have long griped about having to sit through
multiple hours of high-stakes standardized
admissions testing. Now they may have
found an unlikely ally in their battle against
the SAT and ACT — college admission
counselors.
A new report from the National
Association for College Admission
Counseling (NACAC). completed earlier
this month, recommends that colleges and
universities significantly de-emphasize stan
dardized test scores in admission decisions.
Stanford's Office of Undergraduate
Admission has been receptive to the report,
but will not be taking action any time soon.
William Fitzsimmons, Harvard's dean of
admission, led the yearlong study and pre
sented its findings last weekend in Seattle to
an overflowing room of guidance counselors
and admission officers at the annual
NACAC conference.
Stanford's Office of Undergraduate
Admission responded with interest in much
of the commission's findings. In an email to
Hie Daily. Dean of Admission Richard Shaw
called the study "an interesting and well
thought out commission effort."
One of the commission's findings was a
correlation between SAT and ACT scores
and socio-economic class. Students from

privileged backgrounds generally score bet
ter because thev are more likely to pay for
expensive classes and coaching, and thus the
scores fail to accurately represent real
knowledge or potential to succeed in col
lege.
According to a 2007 College Board Score
report included in the NACAC study, stu
dents from families with an income of over
$100,000 receive an average score of 544 out
of 800 in critical reading. 556 in math and
537 in writing. Students from families with
an income of less than $10,000 receive aver
age scores of 427.451 and 423, respectively.
Currently, Stanford requires either the
ACT with writing or the SAT reasoning test.
However, over 280 four-vear educational

institutions currently require neither test.
"We are not prepared at Stanford to elim
inate the consideration of tests in the evalu
ation process," Shaw said. "1 hnvever. testing
outcomes are considered among many other
criteria, and no decision is made on testing
alone."
The NACAC commission study found
that many college and university admission
offices do place a large amount of weight on
SAT or ACT scores in their decisions. When
asked in a 2006 survey what factors had
"considerable importance" in admission
decisions, 60 percent of the universities and
colleges polled included standardized test
scores. In 1993, only 46 percent gave the
same significance to those scores.

At Stanford. Shaw said the admission
office places the most weight on classroom
performance and the degree to which appli
cants have challenged themselves at their
high schools, emphasizing that tests scores
are "a factor among many." The dean also
stressed the importance of evaluating
prospective students' backgrounds in con
junction with their applications.
"Great care should be taken in evaluating
candidates comprehensively and holistical
ly." Shaw said, "taking into account all
aspects of the students' secondary school
experience, as well as the context of their life
circumstances."


JERRY LEE/The Stanford Daily
Stanford Dean of Admission Rick Shaw was receptive to a NACAC study, which draws attention to the biases of standardized admissions test
ing, but has no plans at this time to eliminate standardized te ci: ng as a required element of the Stanford undergraduate admission application.
For one high school senior, news
that the SAT and ACT's domi
nance over the college process
might be fading came as a welcome
relief. Rvan Mayfield. a senior at a
magnet school in Vancouver and
intern at The Daily this summer, is
currently working on his early
action application to Stanford.
Mayfield said he would prefer
attending schools that look beyond
applicants' "numbers."
"I don't want to go to a univer
sity just because I did well on the
SAT." he said. "I'd like to think I'm
a diversified picture. I'm active in

church groups and do National
Honors Society. I'm not just a GPA
and an SAT score. I am Ryan from
Vancouver."
While Stanford will continue to
use test scores as part of the admis
sion decision process this year,
things could change. The admission
office, along with the Academic
Standing Committee on
Undergraduate Education and
Financial Aid, reconsiders admis
sion policies every year. Recently,
Shaw's office launched a pilot pro
gram of optional alumni interviews.
"I assume there may well be
some discussion about the
[NACAC] report in the year to
come," Shaw said.
