## Senate stalls over barbeque Meeting breaks down over $2,800 NSO event 
### ALAN GUO 
The 10th Undergraduate Senate's
first meeting of the academic year was
stalled last night over funding for a
$2,800 ASSU welcome barbeque.
The senators squabbled over a
breakdown of internal protocol in
organizing the barbeque and had fric
tion with ASSU President Jonny
Dorsev '09 and Vice President Fagan
Harris "09, as they sought executive
funding for the event.
The event that caused all of the
hoopla, the ASSU barbeque. was host
ed during New Student Orientation to
recruit frosh. The event was a senate
initiative in collaboration with the
executive branch.
Senator Jonathan McMaster il.
who was in charge of the barbeque.
told the senate the barbeque cost over
$2,800, a significant portion of the sen
ate's annual budget.
"I was disappointed in the bar
beque." McMaster said, "We could
have had more communication and
participation. And we spent more than
we wanted."
Other senators were shocked by
the price tag of the event. Luukas lives
'09 immediatelv voiced concerns
about who should be held account
able.
"Where is this money coming
from?" lives demanded. "Who
decides we have $2.8(X) to spend on
this?"
Citing miscommunication among
senators. McMaster admitted the deci
sion was made between Senate Chair
Tlq Chapa ' 10, Prachi Priyam ' 11 and
himself. The decision was only made
known to the whole senate at the
meeting.
Patrick Cordova '09 shared Ilves's
view while acknowledging
McMaster's effort.
"The protocol that was followed
was definitely not appropriate,"
Cordova said.
Senator Yvorn Aswad-Thomas '11
attempted to ease the tension and also
conceded the fault of other senators.
"It's fair to say that Jonathan took
the lead and Tiq and Prachi worked
out the details on this deal," Aswad-
Thomas said. "We want to set a prece
dent for responsibility. We should
check the e-mails and take it upon
ourselves to have had oversight."
Debate over how much the execu
tive branch should contribute to the
cost of the barbeque caused further
tension at the meeting.
Senators felt the executives should
be responsible for paying part of the
bill because they also garner publicity
from the barbeque. Vice President
Harris, however, rejected that notion.
"We made our commitment very
clear up front of what we could and

could not do," Harris answered, refer
ring to the initial $250 funding support
from the executive branch.
Harris further criticized the Senate
for the organizational failure of the
barbeque, pinpointing a lack of sup
port and communication from the
Senate side.
"We need peer accountability."
Harris declared, "If we want to do
things together, we need to work
together."
Fhe debate clearly highlighted
structural problems within the Senate,
which caused miscommunication and
hindered accountability. Senators
voiced the possibility of clarifying pro
tocols to prevent similar problems in
the future.
The contentious meeting also dis
played tension between the executive
branch and the senate, which has his
torically been a problem for the
ASSU.
Harris, however, was not discour
aged by the meeting's happenings.
"I don't think things are strained,"
Harris told The Daily several hours
after the meeting. "We are still a stu
dent government that is learning and
growing together, there are going to
be bumps in the road, but everyone is
on the same page of making Stanford
a better place."
A bill on recyclable cups to replace
the übiquitous red cup at social scenes
on campus was tabled at the meeting.
The senate saw this as a first step for
an ASSU-led initiative to make sus
tainability a real part of student life.
