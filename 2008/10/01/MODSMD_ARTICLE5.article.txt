## Students debate Palin's readiness Stanford Political Union sponsors student discussion 
### MARISA LANDICHO 
When Alaska Governor Sarah Palin
burst onto the scene in September as John
McCain's running mate, she inspired one
of two emotions, largely depending on
your party affiliation: adoration or disbe
lief. At a Stanford Political Union (SPU)
debate about Palin's qualifications last
night, the reactions were similar.
The "town hall-style debate" got off to
a raucous start; within the first 20 minutes,
one audience member called the potential
future vice president a hot blooded reli
gious maniac, while student panelist Grant
Everett Starrett '09 rushed to the gover
nor's defense, shouting down the audience

member in disbelieving protest.
Over HO students gathered in the base
ment of the psychology building to bait
and listen to six politically charged student
panelists discuss the question of the night:
Is Palin qualified to be VP? The panel was
evenly divided with three for and three
against: members were chosen specifically
for their uncommon opinions and special
involvement in the issue, according to
debate mediator Andrew Hillis '10.
ITie defenders of the Vice Presidential
nominee included Starrett, Greg
Hirshman '11 and Kelly F ; ee '09. They
faced off against Palin-bashers Ashwin
Mudaliar'o9, Clare Bennett'll and Daily
columnist Stuart Baimel '09.
The panelists represented the extremes
of their respective parties â€” all six pan
elists were quite far from the political cen
ter.
"[Palin's] reform agenda demonstrates

not only her confidence but also her guts
and determination," said Hirshman, editor
of the politically focused newspaper The
Cardinal Principle. "She has fought cor
ruption and brought members to account,
most importantly those in her own party."
Bennett, who formerly worked for
Alaska Senator Ted Stevens and is a native
of Anchorage, Alaska, was less enchanted
with Palin's performance as governor.
"Her transportation and education
reforms have not worked for us," Bennett
said. "A lot of the schools back home have
actually lost money. The national view has
been battling as to how our experience
with her has been so misrepresented."
Each issue was given no more than
four minutes of arguments, and audience
members were allowed to pose questions
varying from comparing Palin's experi-

Palin at the event's start, and by the end of the night, were further convinced of their own positions.
ence with that of Obama to her neg
lect of rural villages in Alaska.
Surprisingly, barbs against Obama
drew equal cheers and boos, and
from the reception of the opening
statements it was clear that the
usual Stanford liberal majority was
not in attendance.
Fee, a self-proclaimed "Palin
superfan," defended Palin's energy
background and "girl-next-door"
appeal. Only once did the debate
focus on the nominee's character,
and Fee readily refuted the media
stigma that Palin was too average to
intelligently run the nation.
Rather than Palin's personality or
political views, the bulk of the
debate centered on the titular ques
tion of whether Palin was qualified
for her own nominated position and
also, if need be. the presidency itself.
Starrett. president of the Stanford
Conservative Society, set the terms
of the debate with his opening state
ments.

"There is a job description avail
able in the Constitution," Starrett
said. "It is a worthless backwater job
that anyone can be qualified for. You
just have to be over 35 years old and
a citizen."
TTie anti-Palin side maintained
that more qualifications were neces
sary to rightly hold office, especially
because Palin would become first in
line for the presidency.
"The one thing that caught my
mind, especially during the Gibson
interview, was her similarities to
George W. Bush."' said Mudaliar,
president of the Stanford
Democrats.
Baimel and Starrett dominated
the conversation, often talking over
other panelists and audience mem
bers. Although Starrett's harsh
rebuttals outraged some of the
opposition, his strict adherence to
his constitutional interpretation of
vice presidential qualifications kept
the debate from straying into policy
disagreements. Panelists, however,
could not refrain from direct attacks
towards the other side.
"Palin is a joke," Baimel said.
"McCain picked her for the cynical
reason of gaining the presidency. She

"She was picked in
spite of her bad
qualifications. Is she
qualified? The answer is
definitely no."
- Stuart Raimel,
ASSU senator
was picked in spite of her bad quali
fications. Is she qualified? The
answer is definitely no."
Starrett retorted."lf you consider
Obama qualified for president of the
United States, then certainly Palin is
qualified to be vice president."
No consensus was reached at the
end of the debate, and reactions
were varied.
"I feel like the debate was too
open-shut from the beginning." said

Joseph Masri '1 l.'They defined that
the debate was only on qualifica
tions, and it should have included
more of her political views."
Holly Stebing '09. a particularly
passionate audience member from
Anchorage who joined Barack
Obama backstage before he accept
ed the Democratic nomination in
August, was put off by the vitriol of
the panelists.
"In terms of fairness," she said. "I
think people, especially those on the
panel, should have been more
respectful and let others finish their
points."
Overall, though many professed
learning new facts, the event seemed
to merely reinforce set opinions.
"Debating and looking at the
opposition really strengthened my
beliefs, but. you know, debate is so
fun," Fee said afterwards.
Hillis was optimistic for future
debates. SPU will host four more
debates before the general election
in November, and Hillis hopes the
events will grow to include the entire
campus.
