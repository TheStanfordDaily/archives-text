## Students debate Palin's readiness Stanford Political Union sponsors student discussion 
### MARISA LANDICHO 
When Alaska Governor Sarah Palin
burst onto the scene in September as John
McCain's running mate, she inspired one
of two emotions, largely depending on
your party affiliation: adoration or disbe
lief. At a Stanford Political Union (SPU)
debate about Palin's qualifications last
night, the reactions were similar.
The "town hall-style debate" got off to
a raucous start; within the first 20 minutes,
one audience member called the potential
future vice president a hot blooded reli
gious maniac, while student panelist Grant
Everett Starrett '09 rushed to the gover
nor's defense, shouting down the audience

member in disbelieving protest.
Over HO students gathered in the base
ment of the psychology building to bait
and listen to six politically charged student
panelists discuss the question of the night:
Is Palin qualified to be VP? The panel was
evenly divided with three for and three
against: members were chosen specifically
for their uncommon opinions and special
involvement in the issue, according to
debate mediator Andrew Hillis '10.
ITie defenders of the Vice Presidential
nominee included Starrett, Greg
Hirshman '11 and Kelly F ; ee '09. They
faced off against Palin-bashers Ashwin
Mudaliar'o9, Clare Bennett'll and Daily
columnist Stuart Baimel '09.
The panelists represented the extremes
of their respective parties â€” all six pan
elists were quite far from the political cen
ter.
"[Palin's] reform agenda demonstrates

not only her confidence but also her guts
and determination," said Hirshman, editor
of the politically focused newspaper The
Cardinal Principle. "She has fought cor
ruption and brought members to account,
most importantly those in her own party."
Bennett, who formerly worked for
Alaska Senator Ted Stevens and is a native
of Anchorage, Alaska, was less enchanted
with Palin's performance as governor.
"Her transportation and education
reforms have not worked for us," Bennett
said. "A lot of the schools back home have
actually lost money. The national view has
been battling as to how our experience
with her has been so misrepresented."
Each issue was given no more than
four minutes of arguments, and audience
members were allowed to pose questions
varying from comparing Palin's experi-

Most of the participants in the Stanford Political Union-sponsored debate were solidly for or against
Palin at the event's start, and by the end of the night, were further convinced of their own positions.
