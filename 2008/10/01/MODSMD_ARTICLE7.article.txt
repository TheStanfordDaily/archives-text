## Biden vs. Palin Candidates ready for major debate 
### BETH FOUHY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
For an audition to be second fiddle,
Thursday's debate between often ill-in
formed newcomer Sarah Palin and often
gaffe-prone veteran Joe Biden offers un
usually large pitfalls — and promise.
For once, the whole world may be
watching. Already.3,loo media credentials
have been issued, the most the Commis
sion on Presidential Debates ever needed
in seven vice presidential debates it's host
ed.
The attention is driven by the public's
fascination with Palin. the first-term Alas
ka governor that Republican presidential
candidate John McCain plucked from rel
ative political obscurity to be his running
mate.
Initially. Palin was praised as a superb
political communicator for the delivery of
her acceptance speech at the Republican
National Convention four weeks ago. She
energized the party's conservative base,
which had reservations about McCain,
and quickly showed she could outdraw
McCain on the stump — a likely factor in
their decision to appear together more
often than running mates usually do.
But a series of shaky Palin television in
terviews have left even some conserva
tives questioning whether she is ready to
be vice president. She couldn't describe
the Bush doctrine in foreign affairs,
seemed to have little grasp of the pro
posed financial industry bailout and even
appeared to endorse Democratic presi
dential candidate Barack Obama's posi
tion on chasing al-Qaida terrorists in Pak
istan.
Palin's performance against Biden, the
Delaware Democrat with 35 vears in the

Senate, could restore her initial luster or
seriously weaken the GOP ticket.
Last week's Obama-McCain debate
appeared to give the Illinois Democrat a
small boost in the polls but produced no
knock-out blows. So the vice-presidential
debate at Washington University in St.
Louis could be a pivotal moment in a race
already filled with surprising twists.
Palin herself outlined the contest in an
interview broadcast Tuesday night on the
"CBS Evening News."
"He's got a tremendous amount of ex
perience and, you know. I'm the new ener
gy, the new face, the new ideas and he's got
the experience based on many many years
in the Senate and voters are gonna have a
choice there of what it is that they want in
these next four years." Palin said.
Palin left the campaign trail Monday to
prepare at McCain's ranch in Sedona.
Ariz. She is being coached by McCain's
top campaign strategist. Steve Schmidt, as
well as advisers Tucker Eskew. Nicolle
Wallace and Mark Wallace, all veterans of
President Bush's political operation.
McCain strategists are well aware
Palin's glowing image has been badly
bruised since the convention.
She's been kept from nearly all contact
with reporters except for a handful of
high-profile TV interviews that revealed
her relatively thin grasp of foreign policy
and domestic issues. Palin's answers have
become punch lines for comedians, and a
mocking Palin impersonation by Tina Fey
on "Saturday Night Live" has become a
television and You Tube sensation.
So Palin is under heavy pressure to
show a passing command of issues facing
the next president.
"I don't think she can gei away with
comments on foreign policy like she

knows about Russia because it's near
Alaska." Minnesota-based Republican
strategist Tom 1 lomer said. Palin needs to
"show ability to think on her feet and to
engage with someone on the level of Sen.
Biden without a TelePrompTer in front of
her." Homer added.
In the CBS interview. Palin said she:
— Wouldn't "solely blame all of man's ac
tivities" for climate change, noting that
world weather patterns are cyclical and
have changed over time. "But it kind of
doesn't matter at this point, as we debate
what caused it," she said."The point is: It's
real. We need to do something about it."
— Supports safe and legal contraception,
except the morning-after pill because of
her belief that life begins at conception."!
am all for contraception. And I am all for
preventative measures that are legal and
safe,and should be taken but ....again. 1 am
one to believe that life starts at the mo
ment of conception." Pressed on the point,
Palin said: "Personally. I would not choose
to participate in that kind of contracep
tion."
Biden. for his part, was prepping at
home in Wilmington, Del. On hand to help
were top Obama campaign strategists
David Axelrod. Anita Dunn and Ron
Klain. who helped coach Vice President Al
Gore in 2000.
A veteran debater after his Senate ex
perience and his own two short-lived pres
idential campaigns. Biden has his own set
of challenges.
His first presidential bid in 1987 ended
after he appropriated the life story of
British politician Neil kinnock during a
Democratic primary debate in lowa. Even
now, his off-the-cuff speaking style still
produces verbal blunders, like when he
mused aloud recently that Hillary Rod

ham Clinton might have made a better
running mate for Obama.
And his reputation as a windy orator
will he tested by the tight debate format,
which allows 90-second answers and two
minute follow-ups.
In addition. Biden will be debating a fe
male candidate who has excited many
women and elicited sympathy for some at
tacks perceived as sexist. If Biden comes
on too strong or is condescending, he
could be viewed as bullying or disrespect
ful.
Biden spokesman David Wade ex
pressed confidence.
"Joe Biden debated Sen. Clinton 12
times in the presidential race and those de
bates were substantive and hard hitting,
and he debates strong women in the Unit
ed States Senate," Wade said.
Biden has spoken to Clinton and Cali
fornia Sen. Barbara Boxer for advice on
how best to debate a woman. And Michi
gan Gov. Jennifer Granholm was portray
ing Palin in his practice debates.
"Biden's advisers have to keep beating
into his head that his normal style... can be
offensive," GOP strategist F:d Rollins said.
"He has a tendency, like a lot of senators,
to talk down to people. And that's a danger
for him because there are an awful lot of
women out there who relate to Palin."
And he might consider the example of
Kick I.azio. Clinton's Republican oppo
nent in the 2000 New York Senate contest.
ITie race was tight until the first tele
vised debate, during which Lazio strode
over to the former first lady insisting she
sign a vow to eliminate large, unregulated
contributions from the race. The gesture
made Lazio seem menacing and generated
sympathy for Clinton, particularly among
women. She defeated Lazio by 10 points.
