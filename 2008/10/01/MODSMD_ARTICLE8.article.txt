# US nuclear envoy brings proposal to N. Korea
## 
### JEAN H. LEE THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
The chief U.S. nuclear negotiator with North Korea
will propose a face-saving compromise during a trip
Wednesday to the isolated communist nation to try to sal
vage the derailed disarmament pact. U.S. officials said.
Envoy Christopher Hill said his goal was to persuade
North Korea's Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Gwan to
agree to Washington's demand for a verification system to
account for the North's nuclear arsenal. But he acknowl
edged it would he a difficult task.
The North has rejected U.S. requests on verification
and accused Washington of not living up to its end of the
deal and removing North Korea from a list of state spon
sors of terrorism. It recently reversed the process of dis
mantling its nuclear facilities.
"We are in a very difficult, very tough phase of negoti
ations." Hill told reporters Tuesday night after meeting
with his South Korean counterpart. Kim Sook.to discuss
ways to persuade the North to return to the disarmament
process.
In Washington, a senior U.S. official said Hill is bring
ing a new face-saving proposal that would have North
Korea agree to a verification program and submit it first
to its Chinese allies. The official spoke on condition of
anonymity because Hill has not presented the proposal.
The U.S. would then provisionally remove North
Korea from the terrorism sponsors list. That would edge
around the current impasse, in which the U.S. says it won't
remove North Korea from the list until it signs up to the
verification measures.
U.S. officials said they were not sure North Korea will

agree to the idea and if they do. whether what they pres
ent to the Chinese will be acceptable to Washington.
Hill's trip to the capital. Pyongyang, comes amid re
ports that autocratic North Korean leader Kim Jong 11
suffered a stroke in August, prompting concern that his
prolonged illness could destabilize the Korean peninsula.
North Korea denies that Kim, 66. is ill.
Kim's disappearance from the public eye coincided
with an about-face on the 2007 nuclear deal painstaking
ly negotiated among six countries — the two Koreas, the
U.S.. China. Russia and Japan.
North Korea alarmed the world in 2006 by testing a nu
clear device and a series of missiles, including one capable
of reaching as far as Alaska. It then agreed to dismantle its
nuclear program in exchange for energy aid and other
concessions.
The regime began disabling its nuclear processing
plant in Yongbyon in November, and blew up a cooling
tower in June in a dramatic display of its determination to
carry out the process.
Just steps away from completing the second phase of
the three-part process. Pyongyang abruptly reversed
course in mid-August and stopped disabling the plant.
After confirming it had begun restoring the nuclear re
processing plant and testing an engine ignition, the regime
last week ordered U.N. nuclear inspectors to leave the
country and said it planned to restart the plant. Experts
say it could be up and running within months.
"What they have been doing obviously goes counter to
the spirits of what we've trying to accomplish because all
of the disablement — shutdown and disablement — was
for the purpose of abandonment" of its nuclear program.
Hill said.

Al issue is Washington's request that the North agree
to a verification system to account for its nuclear arsenal
as a condition for removing North Korea from the list of
terrorism sponsors.
ITie detailed, four-page outline of the verification
process that Washington seeks calls for a thorough inspec
tion, soil samples, interviews with scientists and possible
involvement of the United Nations' nuclear agency.
Notoriously reclusive North Korea objects to having to
prove its declaration of nuclear facilities, saying verifica
tion was never part of the disarmament-for-aid deal and is
a unilateral move to disarm them.
U.S. officials say the proposed verification is standard
and has been used by other countries to account for their
nuclear programs.
The U.S. official in Washington said Hill plans to go
word-by-word through the proposed verification proto
col to try to address the North's concerns although previ
ous such efforts did not work.
"I know they are reluctant.... Let's sit down and have
a conversation and see if we can resolve this matter." Hill
said earlier Tuesday, before his meeting with the South
Korean negotiator.
Hie trip to Pyongyang will be Hill's third to North
Korea since December. He is scheduled to drive into the
North from the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone on
Wednesday, officials said.
Pyongyang, about 60 miles from the border that di
vides the two countries still technically at war. is several
hours' drive from the DMZ.
