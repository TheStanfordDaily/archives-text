## Editorial ASSU must end bickering, produce results 
### 
The editorial board had shaky expecta
tions going into Tuesday's Under
graduate Senate meeting. We
nonetheless hoped that the dust had finally
settled on the bickering and partisan ten
sions that sparked controversy in the 10th
Undergraduate Senate last spring. After
seemingly never-ending meetings and some
hard-fought compromises, there seemed to
be light at the end of the tunnel. The events
of Tuesday's meeting leave us skeptical as to
how bright that light truly is.
Tensions were high during a heated de
bate over an atrocious amount of overspend
ing for the ASSU barbecue.There is no doubt
that the claws and fangs did come out in the
discussion — along with rolled eyes and side
glares that didn't go unnoticed — but there
also was quite a bit of cross-table discussion
that caused the claws to quickly be retracted.
Though we are pleased that concerns about
transparency were brought to the table, we
are frustrated that some senators had a clear
vision on moving forward and taking in the
lessons learned from the experience, while
others were concentrating on making sure
the blame was correctly placed.
We do applaud both the Senate and the
executives for putting on an event that at
least tried to put a face on the ASSU for the
general student body and incoming fresh
men. The 'KSSU. however, needs to take this
episode as hard lesson about proper com
munication and clear oversight in adminis
trative processes. No matter at whom the fin
ger should be pointed, a failure on behalf of
the Senate or the executive is still a failure

that reflects poorly not only on a particular
individual, but also on the body as a whole.
Discuss, deliberate, find where the internal
errors were made, determine which im
provements will be made and then move on.
Some pood things did come out of the
slow-moving meeting. The Undergraduate
Senate has a lot of potential to make some
serious change this school year. Senator Ana
Diaz-Hernandez *11 raised issues like ensur
ing that ASSU-sponsored events utilize sus
tainable options and have proper dietary ac
commodations. and the executives pushed
forward efforts to replace red cups with a re
cyclable option at parties. We were also
pleased to hear about a wide range of action
able initiatives, including issues like cam
paign finance reform, a financial plan to deal
with the recession and plans to help con
stituents understand and appreciate the
value the ASSU brings to this campus. Also
discussed were the efforts of Senator Patrick
Cordova '09 on the mental health initiative,
an area in which the editorial board would
like to see more progress.
The student body is looking for tangible
strides in the right direction for the ASSU
this school year. But in order to do that, egos
need to be left at the door, and partisan beef,
to whatever extent it exists, needs to be left
at the cookout. Power trips and finger point
ing get us nowhere and are not the things
constituents care about. Senators, you were
elected because undergraduates saw poten
tial in you to impact the student body in a
meaningful way.The editorial board charges
you to actually start doing it.
