# The 						economics of the herd
## 
### 
While new explanations for the cur
rent financial crisis crop up every
where from the hallowed pages of
the American Economic Review to the in
fomercial-laden pages of Sky Mall magazine,
one of the most discerning was proposed
many, many years ago by one John Maynard
Keynes.
Keynes, with his "animal spirits." was not a
mathematician disguised as an economist,
like so many great thinkers today. He took a
much more intuitive approach to the subject,
deriving results that were more often rooted
in human behavior and psychology than in
utility functions and budget constraints.
With regards to financial crises. Keynes
had this pearl of wisdom: 'it is much easier
for a man to fail conventionally than to stand
against the crowds and speak the truth."
Economic shocks will always occur. They
are inherent to any efficient, market-based
system. Keynes' observation explains why
these shocks are often so violent, to the point
that the financial system descends into a cri
sis before remerging.
People find comfort in numbers. They are
reassured when they know that if they fail,
they are not alone in their failures.There are
few places where this is truer than on Wall
Street.
Afraid of missing the next big thing and
possibly their next earnings estimates, invest
ment banks commit significant amounts of
capital and labor to the latest financial
trends. Like a herd of sheep, they follow each
other, committing greater and greater
amounts until a shock occurs and the entire
system is forced to purge itself.
A survey of recent financial history vali
dates this point of view.
The 1980s witnessed the leveraged buy
out boom, where investors would buy cor
porations with money raised from issuing
debt at attractive interest rates. Investment
banks piled into the market, earning fees by
advising so-called corporate raiders, selling
the issued debt to investors and holding
some of the debt themselves. The "Ra-Ra
'80s" was one of the most profitable eras in
finance until the market became saturated
with debt and the economy began faltering.
Credit markets stalled, much like today, and
Drexel Burnham Lambert, at the time the
fifth largest investment bank, went under.
The same thing happened 10 years later
with the "dot com" boom.This time around,
technology companies took the place of in

vestment firms. Afraid of missing out on the
profits of the "new economy," investment
banks hyped up technology stocks like they
could simultaneously cure cancer, stop
global warming and bring peace to the Mid
dle East.
The equity markets soared, with the
tech-heavy NASDAQ index breaking 5000
points for the first time ever (it is at 2000
today). Amidst the irrational exuberance,
nobody questioned the fundamentals of
these technology companies.
The bubble grew bigger and bigger and
the pop was louder than ever when it even
tually burst. The equity markets crashed
and investment banks were forced to pay
enormous fines for misrepresenting re
search and inflating stock prices. The crisis
saw the creation of the "Chinese Wall."
where investment banks were forced to
separate their research and trading arms.
The present financial crisis is no differ
ent. Investment banks herded into the
world of financial innovation, creating,
marketing and selling a host of new securi
ties that were linked to mortgages, credit
cards, auto loans and much more.The com
petitive pressure to enter these markets
and to make super-sized profits forced in
vestment banks to take larger positions and
finance these bets with greater borrowing.
The Big Five investment banks made
record profits, and there was unprecedent
ed wealth and job creation in the financial
services industry. The attraction of the herd
grew stronger, and more firms, including
commercial banks and insurance compa
nies, entered the mix, afraid that they were
missing out.
When things fell apart, everyone crashed
together,exacerbating the financial crisis and
causing a market-wide purging of financial
institutions.
But alas, the situation is not entirely bleak.
There are those who stand up against the
crowds and speak the truth. ITiey become
legends to some, and merely extremely rich

to others.
In the 1980s, Goldman Sachs rose to the
top of the investment baking pile by refusing
to engage in the buyout boom. Instead. Gold
man decided to play the role of White
Knight, advising corporations on how to
avoid leveraged buyouts. During the tech
bubble it was the Oracle of Omaha. Warren
Buffet, who famously claimed that he didn't
understand technology,so he wouldn't invest
in it — the companies were grossly overval
ued in his opinion.
And in the present financial crisis, it is
Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan Chase,
chastised by shareholders for not taking the
same risks as his competitors, who now
stands as a reincarnation of his company's
namesake, sweeping up faltering institutions
at bargain basement prices.
