Hie barbecue was a success.The point was
to have people come out and meet the under
graduate representatives,and that happened.
I believe that this point did not get across in
yesterday's article ("Senate stalls over barbe
cue '). We are all thankful for the people who
took time out of their day to come meet the
ASSU. both senate and executive branches.
But the point of yesterday's senate meet
ing was to communicate that it could have
been an even better success. Wc could have
made it more cost-ellective, we should have
shared responsibilities and we could have
demonstrated a better ability to communi
cate with each other.To say that it was a total
bust is an insult to those who actually worked
on it. as well as to those who attended.
At the end of the day. we are a young sen
ate here for the sole purpose of serving you,
the undergraduate students. Never forget
that, and please contact us if there is anything
we can do to help.
