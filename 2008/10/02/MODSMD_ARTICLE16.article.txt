## Panel discusses future transportation Sustainable, efficient technology envisioned 
### AMANDA ZHANG 
Stanford students, faculty and
outside representatives gathered
last night at the Faculty Club to cel
ebrate the expanded partnership
between Stanford University and
Robert Bosch LLC.
The event, co-hosted by the
University and the company, fea
tured a series of preliminary speech
es and a panel entitled "Sustainable
Transportation for the Future."
Bosch granted $3 million to
Stanford to establish the Robert
Bosch Chairmanship of the
Department of Mechanical
Engineering. The chair is currently
occupied by Engineering Prof. Fritz
Prinz, who is researching micro- and
nano-scale devices for energy and
biology.
Robert Bosch GmbH is a diversi
fied technology corporation that is
also the world's largest supplier of

automotives. The Research
Technology Center of Robert Bosch
LLC, the U.S.-based subsidiary of
the company, is located in Palo Alto.
Professor Prinz opened the event
by describing Stanford and Bosch's
aim to develop technology for envi
ronmentally sound and economical
ly viable transportation.
Dean of Engineering James
Plummer commented on Stanford's
long history of partnerships with
industry and thanked Bosch for its
dedication to making "a huge differ
ence in mechanical engineering, a
huge difference at Stanford, and
mostly importantly, a huge differ
ence in the lives of students and fac
ulty, our most important product."
Siegfried Dais, the deputy chair
man of the Board of Management of
Robert Bosch GmbH, discussed
Bosch's projects developing the
solar-powered car and the self-suffi
cient home. Meanwhile, Klaus
Dieterich. president of Corporate
Research at Robert Bosch GmbH,
described Bosch's research into
photovoltaic efficiency and lithium
ion batterv.

"The age of oil is no more than a
brief episode in the history of
mankind," Dais said. Bosch, as an
energy conversion company, is com
mitted to researching renewable
energy sources and preparing for
the time after oil.
Several members of the panel
discussed the future of automobiles
as well. Dr. Lawrence Burns, vice
president of General Motors, envi
sioned a future car powered by elec
tricity and hydrogen and
autonomously driven. Future cars
will be connected to one another
and electronically controlled. He
predicted the onset of autonomous
driving, resulting in cars that never
crash.
Elon Musk, the product architect
and chairman of the board of Tesla
Motors, talked about plans for their
Model 2 car. a $60,000 energy-effi
cient sedan. For his final remarks, he
joked,"l think it's about time we fig
ured out how to do fusion,"
Stanford professors Christopher
Edwards of the department of
Mechanical Engineering and
Stephen Schneider of the

Department of Biological Sciences
also participated in the panel.
Edwards emphasized the impor
tance of personalizing transporta
tion and the government's role in
modifying infrastructure. Fie sug
gested electrifying at least one lane
on the highway.
Alternatively. Schneider provid
ed an environmental perspective,
underlining that transportation is
accountable for over 40 percent of
the climate change in California,
and that developed nations do not
have the moral authority to attack
India or China for their energy
inefficiency.
"We have to walk the walk first,"
Schneider said. "We must foster
leadership, cooperation and "a
change in mindset from what we've
seen in the last twenty years."
The panelists agreed: changes in
energy technology must come soon.
Perhaps it is up for the future engi
neers at Stanford, funded by Bosch,
to find a solution.
