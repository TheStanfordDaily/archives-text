## Angels, but not miracles 
### 
Normally, when we sports writ
ers at The Daily are putting
together our columns, we try
to avoid writing multiple columns on
a single subject.This keeps the sports
page fresh and interesting — at least
we think so — for all of our readers.
But this week I am going to have to
break that unwritten rule because 1
believe there is still more to be said
on the subject of the Major League
Baseball playoffs.
Don't worry. I don't intend to
walk through every series as Antho
ny Nguyen already did in his "Red
October for Baseball" column on
Monday. But I do want to offer an
other take on which team will be
crowned champion come the end of
October.
Anthony backed the chances of
his hometown Angels — who did
have the best regular-season record
in baseball —topping the Cubs in six
to win their second title in seven
years. Apologies Anthony, and all
other supporters of the Halos, but I
have to disagree.
You see, while the Angels certain
ly have all the pieces to put a first
rate ball club on the field. I just don't
see that aura that some call "intangi
bles" surrounding them. TTiey have
halos over their heads, but there's a
distinct lack of any heavenly glow
around the edges. And a team simply
cannot win in the postseason without
some magic, or destiny, on its side.
Why do I think the ability to pro
duce miracles is so important to post
season success? When you get down
to the final eight teams, each is so
good that no one is going to be able
to dominate the others on talent
alone. There has to be something
more to push the winners over the
edge, and that something is difficult
to understand beyond a gut feeling,
although 1 have tried to do so below.
Yes, the Angels controlled the divi
sion from end-to-end and never
slumped for long, but that might just
be why the magic feeling is lacking.
Iliey didn't need many late-inning
miracles to breeze through the easiest
schedule in the AI. and, as a result,
may not be able to pull them out when
the time comes. Perhaps they were
too dominant for their own good.
The Angels have just three wins in
extra innings and only nine when
trailing after six. Sure, if they take the
lead early in every game and hand it
to K-Rod, I love their chances; but
the teams they will be facing are far
too good for that to happen. Come
backs. walk offs and other late-in
ning magic rule October baseball,
and I don't think the Angels have
enough rabbits to pull from the
proverbial hat.
In fact, I don't think that they can
find their way past Tampa Bay. The
Rays have seemed like a "team of
destiny" all season, and the numbers
(whicli, admittedly,can only show in
tangibles so well) support that
image: 11 walk-off wins, 10 in extra
innings and 12 when trailing after six.
The Cubs as well have 10 wins in
extra innings and a whopping 18
wins when trailing after six, although
just six walk-offs. And to prove the
Cubs really do buy into the miracle
theory, the home dugout at Wrigley
Field was blessed by a priest and
bathed in holy water before last
night's game.
Every other team in the playoffs
has shown more late-game magic
than the I lalos (feel free to check the
stats yourself at baseball
reference.com). The Angels don't
have that special edge, and they
won't get out of the ALCS.
So who, then, will be in the World
Series? The most likely pair, and
most desirable as far as storylines go,
are the Cubs and Rays. Both teams
have that magical quality to go with
excellent talent, and championships
for either would be particularly spe
cial. with the Cubs looking for their
first in 1(H) years and Rays for their
first ever.
Whichever team gets to play for
that fourth win at home first is going
to take it,and I don't see the Cubbies
taking three of the first four games to
wrap it up in Wrigley. This one is
going to the Rays in seven.
It is nearly impossible, and would
be horribly boring, for a team to win

the World Series without displaying
some magic on its journey through
October. But if you still think I am
putting too much stock in the intan
gibles, consider the conventional in
dicators as well.

Essentially the only thing going
for the Angels is their record, and the
edge there is slight and easily attrib
utable to the weakness of their oppo
nents in the AL West. Of the eight
postseason teams, the Halos rank
fourth in batting average, seventh in
home runs, and sixth in runs scored
and ERA. Hie Cubs, by contrast, are
second, fourth, first and fourth in
those categories, while the Rays are
fifth in the first three and second in

ERA.
But, as Anthony said, numbers
don't carry that much weight in the
postseason. But something else
does: Magic ;ind miracles reign on
October nights. The Angels' Rally
Monkey has run out of both.

Did Erik Adams think the 2006 World
Series Champion St. Louis Cardinals
were particularly magical? Ask him at
