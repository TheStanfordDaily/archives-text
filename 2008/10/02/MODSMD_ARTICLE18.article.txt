## No. 6 Stanford takes on cross-town rival Santa Clara 
### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
I"he Stanford women's soccer team will look
to end the non-conference portion of its season
undefeated as it makes the short trip down El
Camino Real to play its annual game against
rival Santa Clara this Friday night at 7 p.m.

The No. 6 Cardinal has been in fine form
throughout the beginning of the season; tne
team's record now stands at 9-0-1, with its one
draw coming against No. 2 North Carotiaa. This
past weekend. Stanford breezed by St. Mary's 3-
0, a result that could have been even more em
phatic had Stanford finished a few more of its 30
shots.
The match against the Gaels saw the Cardinal
dominate in all facets of the game â€” from all
three of its starting forwards scoring to the mid
field demonstrating its ability to win and retain
possession to the defense making sure sopho
more goalkeeper Kira Maker didn't even have to

make a single save. The team will hope for more
of the same as it takes on another Bay Area rival
this weekend, but Santa Clara will provide a very
different test from the Gaels.
Unlike St. Mary's, the Broncos have faced
some of the best
competition in the country, including North Car
olina. No. 1 Notre Dame, No. 4 UCLA and No. 5
USC. While they were blown out by UNC, they
hung close in losses to Notre Dame and USC and
played a hard-fought scoreless draw against
