## No. 6 Stanford takes on cross-town rival Santa Clara 
### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
I"he Stanford women's soccer team will look
to end the non-conference portion of its season
undefeated as it makes the short trip down El
Camino Real to play its annual game against
rival Santa Clara this Friday night at 7 p.m.

The No. 6 Cardinal has been in fine form
throughout the beginning of the season; tne
team's record now stands at 9-0-1, with its one
draw coming against No. 2 North Carotiaa. This
past weekend. Stanford breezed by St. Mary's 3-
0, a result that could have been even more em
phatic had Stanford finished a few more of its 30
shots.
The match against the Gaels saw the Cardinal
dominate in all facets of the game — from all
three of its starting forwards scoring to the mid
field demonstrating its ability to win and retain
possession to the defense making sure sopho
more goalkeeper Kira Maker didn't even have to

make a single save. The team will hope for more
of the same as it takes on another Bay Area rival
this weekend, but Santa Clara will provide a very
different test from the Gaels.
Unlike St. Mary's, the Broncos have faced
some of the best
competition in the country, including North Car
olina. No. 1 Notre Dame, No. 4 UCLA and No. 5
USC. While they were blown out by UNC, they
hung close in losses to Notre Dame and USC and
played a hard-fought scoreless draw against

GAME NOTES: No. 6 Stanford heads down El
Camino Real to play local rival Santa Clara
on Friday night. The Cardinal is 9-0-1 on the
season. Santa Clara leads the all-time series
between the two teams, 18-7-5. This is the last
nonconference game for the Cardinal before
it starts the Pac-10 season on Oct. 10.

UCLA.
So although Santa Clara's record
of 3-6-2 is not immediately eye
catching, the team has proven it can
play with any team in the nation and
is no doubt capable of hanging with
Stanford.
If the Broncos do indeed swing
an upset on Friday, it will most likely
be because of their defense. While
Santa Clara's offense has struggled
throughout the year, its backline has
turned it up a notch recently, allow
ing just one goal in its last three
games, including the matchup with
UCLA's high-powered offense.
Senior goalkeeper Meagan Mc-
Cray has come up big in the Bronco
net. and also showed a lot of tough
ness this year when she played the
full match against the Bruins after

getting kicked in the face early in the
second half.
McCray also starred in the Stan
ford-Santa Clara battle last
year, when she made 12 saves and
kept a clean sheet as the match
ended in a scoreless draw. It was a
game that the Cardinal dominated,
as shown by its 26-5 advantage in
total shots, but the Broncos were
able to keep them from scoring.
The game was one of the most
frustrating matches of the 2007 sea
son for the Cardinal, but Stanford
head coach Paul Ratcliffe insists
that his team is not even thinking
about it ahead of this year's en
counter.
"We've kind of put last year's
game behind us," Ratcliffe said. "We
just have to think about what we can
do this year.
"Santa Clara is a very good
team," he continued. "We just have
to focus on creating chances and fin
ishing chances, and 1 think it will be
a great game."

Stanford will also take comfort in
the fact that although this will tech
nically be an away match, many Car
dinal fans always make the short trip
to Santa Clara. Considering the sea
son the team is having this year,
there should be a very big group of
Stanford supporters there.
The Cardinal also shouldn't take
too long to get used to the pitch at
Santa Clara's Buck Shaw Stadium,
as it was only two weeks ago that it
played two matches in the Santa
Clara Invitational Tournament. In
fact. Stanford won the tournament
in style, beating Yale 4-1 and Cal
Poly 3-0 over the course of that
weekend.
Given how important it is for the
team to head into its Pac-10 Confer
ence schedule with confidence, the
Cardinal will be hoping its last game
in Santa Clara's stadium this year
will be as successful as the first two.
