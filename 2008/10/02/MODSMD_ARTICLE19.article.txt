# Field hockey prepares for East Coast trip
## 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA STAFF WRITER 
Several close games, a pair of overtime loss
es and a 7-0 victory — and that's just this past
weekend. ITiese are a few things that have
marked the season for the Stanford women's
field hockey team thus far. And that's not to
mention a four-goal game for junior Midori

Uehara.
After a pre-season with several ups and
downs, the Cardinal women have already
been faced with a myriad of challenges and
now hope to only improve from here on as
they attempt to follow in the footsteps of their
2007-08 season. Last year saw the team's first
NCAA tournament appearance since 2000. as
well as the team's second-highest win total

(l3) in program history.
With nine returning starters from last year,
the Stanford women will look to surpass that
performance after facing a rough pre-season
schedule; out of the six teams the Cardinal
played, four were nationally ranked.
Regardless, the team heads out to the East
Coast this weekend with fresh energy and de
termination, looking to leave its mark in a re

gion known for its strong field hockey culture.
The Cardinal faces the Northeastern Huskies
on Saturday and then the Holy Cross Cru
saders on Monday. Currently 3-7 overall and
1-2 in the Northern Pacific Conference, the
women depart for their third East Coast road
trip of the year.
Northeastern has a 5-4 record overall,
boasting a four-game winning streak last
month. Holy Cross stands at 3-5 overall, hav
ing scored only 11 goals so far this year.
The Stanford women feature a variety of tal
ent, marked by the recent success of Uehara.
In fact.only seven other players in NCAA Di
vision I competition have scored four goals in
a game so far this year. Uehara joined the
ranks of those elite few. also becoming the first
Stanford player to score four goals in a match
since 1998.
Other highlights of the Cardinal line-up in
clude four different players who have earned
the honor of being recognized as NorPac Play
er of the Week: freshmen Stephanie Byrne and
Beth Ridley, Uehara, and sophomore
Alessandra Moss, who earned the title twice.
Indeed. Stanford currently displays the most
NorPac Player of the Week honors of any
team in the conference.
"We've had a challenging first half of our
season, although I think our record doesn't
fully reflect how we've been playing," Uehara
said. "There have been several games in which
we have played some of the best hockey 1 have
seen Stanford play.ending in a loss in overtime
or by one goal.
"Unfortunately, there have been other
games in which we've struggled with consis
tency and working as a unit." Uehara contin
ued. "Leading up to this trip, we have been
working really hard in practice, and 1 think we
are well-prepared to take on Holy Cross and
Northeastern. If we play to our potential and
put together a full 70 minutes of team play, we
can step on the field and beat anyone."
The Cardinal women have been focusing
on communication and shooting, as junior
Nora Soza has written in her online blog.
