## iStanford app for iPhone fans Students develop iPhone app for Stanford community 
### RYAN MAC STAFF WRITER 
Stanford students who braved long
Apple store lines this summer waiting to
purchase iPhones will soon have one more
reason to be excited about their high-tfech
device. Student-run software solutions com
pany Terriblyclever Design recently
announced that a new suite of applications
called iStanford will soon be available for
University-affiliated iPhone users.
iStanford will be the first iPhone tool
specially designed to assist Stanford stu
dents and faculty, further wiring an already
tech-savvy campus.
By mid-October, the student-run soft
ware company hopes to have five applica
tions available for download from the
online i'Tunes app store. From apps that can
access campus maps to those that can
retrieve professors' email addresses, the
company's products may prove to be very
practical for the iPhone-wielding student.
Company founder Kayvon Beykpour'lo
explained the thought process behind these
various applications.
"We talked to Stanford because we real
ized that today, lots of people have iPhones
and iPods," Beykpour said. "We wanted to
make powerful utilities for students to use
on campus on a daily basis. Our company
sat down with Stanford and presented a
vision for something that could be very

The Stanford Daily
powerful."
The end product of these talks is
iStanford. which includes an
iPhone equivalent of Stanford Who,
an interactive GPS-coordinated
map, a course browser, a Stanford
sports tracker and a bill-paying
application. These apps will be
available at no cost to students.
"The goal is not only the devel
opment of each individual app but
also the integration of tools,"
Beykpour said. "We hope that soon
you'll be able to find a class with
the courses app, then use one click
to find out how to get there with
the interactive map and with a sec
ond quick click find out the profes
sor's email."
Working with a team that
includes co-founder Joe Bernstein,
Ben Cunningham *10, Felipe
Pinientel '10 and Aaron
Wasserman ' 10, Beykpour is the TA
for an iPhone application develop
ment class in the Computer Science
department,
CS 193 P. a new course being
offered this quarter, is taught by
Apple-affiliated instructors Paul
Marcos and Paul Doll, who are
teaching students the programming
and management of various appli
cations associated with the iPhone.
Computer Science Prof. Julie
Zelenski noted the practicality of
such a class in an email to The
Daily.
"The CS department has a histo
ry of offering practical, hands-on
courses for emerging
platforms/tech nologies/languages
in the CS 193 series," Zelenski
wrote. "Where possible, we try to
offer interesting opportunities for
our students to exercise their soft
ware engineering skills, and work
ing in the context of intriguing new
technologies has been a popular
draw."
With over 100 students express
ing interest in a course capped at 50
students, the class has been quite
the attraction for those hoping to
get a head start on iPhone pro
gramming. The CS department also
mentioned that there are no plans

for a follow-up course, though a
similar course may be offered in
the spring.
And while space for CS 193P
has been capped, this fact certainly
has not discouraged students from
dabbling in the application devel
opment field. Various independent
groups across campus have invest
ed time into turning ideas into
functional apps. Lucas Manfield '11
explained the reasons behind this
experimentation.
"The i Phone app store allows
small development teams such as
ours to focus on design rather than
distribution." he said. "Essentially,
if we make something people want,
we can rely on it being initially
profitable without having to invest
too heavily in infrastructure and
marketing."
Whatever the venture, the possi
bilities for the iPhone seem end
less. Bevkpour echoed this senti
ment.
"1 think with every new plat
form there's going be a lot of
experimentation, but even more so
with the iPhone." he said. "There is
a different set of opportunities for
the iPhone — a certain ability to
impact in more of a profound way.
This is just the beginning."
