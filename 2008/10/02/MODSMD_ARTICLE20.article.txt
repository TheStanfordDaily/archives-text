# Card faces tough schedule
## Offensive power will help No. 3 Stanford in MPSF 
### KENAN JIANG STAFF WRITER 
As the Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation (MPSF) competition
gets underway, the No. 3 Stanford
men's water polo team is in heavy
training for next week's showdown
with Pacific in Stockton, Calif.

No. 1 USC, No. 2 UCLA and No.
4 California look to be the top oppo
nents for the Cardinal this year with
all three in the MPSF. So, the Stan
ford men's water polo team will take
nothing for granted when seeking its
first NCAA championship since
2002.
"This season looks very promis
ing," sophomore All-American Sage
Wright said. "We have incredible
freshman players who will definitely
positively impact the team this
year."
Along with arguably the best

player in the nation in Wright, the
Cardinal will beast a top recruiting
class that is highlighted by freshmen
Jacob Smith and Peter Sefton, who
are already regular rotation players
on the squad.
Other freshmen include Califor
nians Alex Avery from local Ather
ton, Ryan Brown from Monte
Sereno, Porter Kalbus from
Danville. Andrew LaForge from San
Juan Capistrano, Eric Clapper from
Coronado, Ryan Kent from Corona
del Mar.Travis Noll from Tustin and
Tim Norton from local Menlo Park.
The first-year players on the team
have given the Cardinal good depth
after the departure of two-meter of
fensive player Michael Bury and
three two-meter defenders Peter
Finlayson, Ryan Fortune and For
rest Schwartz. Graduated Goal
keeper Sandy Hohener '08, who was
outstanding in front of the net last
year, will be replaced by team cap
tain Jimmie Sandman, a junior goal
keeper who has split duties so far
with sophomore Brian Pingree.
"Jacob Smith and Peter Sefton.
two of the freshmen, have already
shown they can compete with the
best." Wright said. "They will help us
accomplish our goals this year, the
predominant one being winning
NCAAs. To do that we want to play
smart but intense water polo. We
command the game when we are
out-thinking and out-hustling the
opposition."
In water polo, the two-meter
player often does most of the "dirty
work" inside and around the area in
front of the goal. Despite the loss of
a highly important defensive posi
tion. the team's defensive duty will
be shouldered on Brown and
LaForge, as senior captain Will Hin
dle-Katel has stepped in the middle
to hold down the Cardinal's defense
with his 6-foot-6 frame.
