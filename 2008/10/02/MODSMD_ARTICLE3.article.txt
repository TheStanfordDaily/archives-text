# Professors explain economy
## Finance and economics professors trace economic downfall 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
Last night, the economics department,
the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy
Research (SIEPR) and the Graduate
School of Business jointly sponsored a dis
cussion on the current financial crisis in
the Bechtel Conference Center in Encina
Hall.
The event, entitled "The Crisis in the
Financial Markets and the Economy: A
Conversation with Michael Boskin and
Darrell Duffie," was moderated by
Economics Prof. John Shoven, who is also
a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution.
The discussion jumped directly into
pinpointing the root cause of the current
financial crisis. The three professors dis
cussed the 2000 technology bubble, the
federal interest rate in the past few years
and, most importantly, the housing bubble
and its progression into a widespread
financial crisis.
Boskin. professor of economics and
senior fellow at the Hoover Institution,
was blunt about current economic condi
tions.
"Our economy is probably in a reces
sion." he said. "Japan. Germany and other
European countries are also probably
entering into recession, and China and
India are likely to see slowed growth."
"But while we are probably in a reces
sion. it doesn't have to be a deep or a long
one," Boskin added.
Duffie, a professor ot finance at the
GSB who has conducted research on cred
it risk, defaulted securities and derivative
securities, defined for the audience credit
default swaps (CDS) and collateralized
debt obligations (CDOs), both of which
have played major roles in fueling or sus
taining the financial crisis.
Duffie repeatedly quoted Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke's
use of the word "gridlock" to describe the

current liquidity crisis resulting from ques
tionable asset pricing and financial uncer
tainty.
"Typically, we take the financial sector
for granted," Duffie said. "It's like a tap:
you go to the ATM machine, and out
comes your cash. But under the hood, the
financial system is a very complex piece of

machinery."
'Right now. that machinery is clogged."
he added. "It must he treed up before the
economy can begin to recover."
Both Duffie and Boskin emphasized
the importance of greater future regula
tion of the financial industry, transparency
in accounting methods and the balance

sheets of financial institutions, and recon
figured incentives for rating agencies to
prevent a similar financial collapse in the
future.
The professors also discussed the
defeat of the first bailout plan proposed

by Treasury Secretary Henry
Paulson in the House of
Representatives last Friday, and the
subsequent slide in stock markets
around the world.
"Once it was apparent that the
bailout bill wasn't going to pass the
House, the macro-economic per
formance of the U.S. was in doubt."
Duffie said.
The second revised version of the
bailout plan passed in the Senate
yesterday and is now being debated
in the House. House leaders have
expressed cautious and indefinite
optimism about the passage of the
bill.

"The people on Main Street
underestimate the effects of a col
lapse of Wall Street," Boskin said.
Boskin also recounted the after
math of the 1987 financial crisis,
when inflation peaked at 13.5 per
cent and unemployment jumped to
eight to nine percent.
Both professors agreed that
some form of the bailout plan will
pass Congress. While there are
strong competing alternatives, and
versions of the bailout plan have
been proposed around the country,
most versions can be combined in
some forms.
Concerning recent failures and
government bailouts of financial
institutions. Boskin said, the concept
has gone from "too big to fail" to
"too inter-connected to fail."
"We only get to run this experi
ment once, unfortunately â€” or for

tunately." Duffie said.
While the first half of the event
was held in discussion format with
Shoven. Boskin and Duffie all offer
ing their opinions and explanations
of recent market and economic
events, the second hour of the panel
consisted of students' Q&A.
Students wrote their inquiries on
note cards that event coordinators
gave to Shoven. who in turn fired
the questions at Boskin and Duffie.
Questions ranged from discus
sion of moral hazard to the federal
takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac, the two largest mortgage
lenders in the United States, to
quantitative modeling of various
credit derivatives and CDOs.
The Bechtel Conference Center
was overflowing with students for
the duration of the event, and most
students had a positive impression

of the discussion.
"I think it was a great overview
of the financial crisis" said Wilson
Maina '10. 'it was very educational
in the sense that the professors
explained really well why we are
economically where we are."
James Hsi i 1 agreed.
"I had no idea that this financial
crisis was so intricately linked to
previous economic events, such as
Greenspan's reactions to the tech
nology bubble by keeping interest
rates so low." Hsi said.
"This is a great time to be study
ing economics." he added. "1 feel
like I'm watching economic historic
in the making, and to not keep an
eye on what's going on would be a
shame."
