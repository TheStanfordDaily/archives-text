# Professors explain economy
## Finance and economics professors trace economic downfall 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
Last night, the economics department,
the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy
Research (SIEPR) and the Graduate
School of Business jointly sponsored a dis
cussion on the current financial crisis in
the Bechtel Conference Center in Encina
Hall.
The event, entitled "The Crisis in the
Financial Markets and the Economy: A
Conversation with Michael Boskin and
Darrell Duffie," was moderated by
Economics Prof. John Shoven, who is also
a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution.
The discussion jumped directly into
pinpointing the root cause of the current
financial crisis. The three professors dis
cussed the 2000 technology bubble, the
federal interest rate in the past few years
and, most importantly, the housing bubble
and its progression into a widespread
financial crisis.
Boskin. professor of economics and
senior fellow at the Hoover Institution,
was blunt about current economic condi
tions.
"Our economy is probably in a reces
sion." he said. "Japan. Germany and other
European countries are also probably
entering into recession, and China and
India are likely to see slowed growth."
"But while we are probably in a reces
sion. it doesn't have to be a deep or a long
one," Boskin added.
Duffie, a professor ot finance at the
GSB who has conducted research on cred
it risk, defaulted securities and derivative
securities, defined for the audience credit
default swaps (CDS) and collateralized
debt obligations (CDOs), both of which
have played major roles in fueling or sus
taining the financial crisis.
Duffie repeatedly quoted Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke's
use of the word "gridlock" to describe the

current liquidity crisis resulting from ques
tionable asset pricing and financial uncer
tainty.
"Typically, we take the financial sector
for granted," Duffie said. "It's like a tap:
you go to the ATM machine, and out
comes your cash. But under the hood, the
financial system is a very complex piece of

machinery."
'Right now. that machinery is clogged."
he added. "It must he treed up before the
economy can begin to recover."
Both Duffie and Boskin emphasized
the importance of greater future regula
tion of the financial industry, transparency
in accounting methods and the balance

sheets of financial institutions, and recon
figured incentives for rating agencies to
prevent a similar financial collapse in the
future.
The professors also discussed the
defeat of the first bailout plan proposed
