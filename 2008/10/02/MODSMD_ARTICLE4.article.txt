## Univ. sets plan for sustainable buildings, Green Dorm New and old structures alike aim to be green 
### CARLEE BROWN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford has long been a leader in sustain
able building technologies, dating back to the
early 1990s when the University installed
energy meters in campus buildings in order

to monitor and adjust electricity use. Today,
Stanford is continuing its history of environ
mental consciousness by implementing sus
tainable features in new buildings and retro
fitting existing structures.
One new building under construction
with an eco-friendly design is the Graduate
School of Business's new Knight
Management Center.The center will employ
a number of sustainable techniques, such as
capturing rainwater for non-potable uses like
toilet water. Using captured water will help

the new GSB reduce its use of potable water
by SO percent, according to Knight
Management Center Program Director
Kathleen Kavanaugh.
"We feel that it's very important to
demonstrate leadership in business and the
environment," Kavanaugh said, referencing
the business school's motto. "Change lives.
Change organizations. Change the world."
"And we just think it's the right thing to
do," she added.
In addition to water-saving technology.

the Knight Center will also feature more effi
cient heating and cooling technology, with
under-floor air distribution instead of the
more-common overhead distribution. Also,
the center will feature seven narrow build
ings with large windows suited to bring in
more natural light and ventilation than one
large building could do alone.
With green techniques such as these, the
GSB hopes to receive one of the most presti-
