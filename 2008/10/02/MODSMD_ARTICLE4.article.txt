## Univ. sets plan for sustainable buildings, Green Dorm New and old structures alike aim to be green 
### CARLEE BROWN DESK EDITOR 
Stanford has long been a leader in sustain
able building technologies, dating back to the
early 1990s when the University installed
energy meters in campus buildings in order

to monitor and adjust electricity use. Today,
Stanford is continuing its history of environ
mental consciousness by implementing sus
tainable features in new buildings and retro
fitting existing structures.
One new building under construction
with an eco-friendly design is the Graduate
School of Business's new Knight
Management Center.The center will employ
a number of sustainable techniques, such as
capturing rainwater for non-potable uses like
toilet water. Using captured water will help

the new GSB reduce its use of potable water
by SO percent, according to Knight
Management Center Program Director
Kathleen Kavanaugh.
"We feel that it's very important to
demonstrate leadership in business and the
environment," Kavanaugh said, referencing
the business school's motto. "Change lives.
Change organizations. Change the world."
"And we just think it's the right thing to
do," she added.
In addition to water-saving technology.

the Knight Center will also feature more effi
cient heating and cooling technology, with
under-floor air distribution instead of the
more-common overhead distribution. Also,
the center will feature seven narrow build
ings with large windows suited to bring in
more natural light and ventilation than one
large building could do alone.
With green techniques such as these, the
GSB hopes to receive one of the most presti-
gious credentials available to sustain
able buildings — the Leadership in
Energy and Environmental Design
(LEED) Platinum Certification from
the U.S. Green Building Council.
LEED Platinum is the highest certi
fication available.
The Knight Center must also
meet Stanford's requirements for
energy efficiency. The University
mandates that energy use in new
buildings be 30 percent under state
and national code requirements.
Water use, which is not governed by
state or national standards, must be
25 percent lower in new buildings
than in comparable existing struc
tures.
According to Joe Stagner, execu
tive director of Stanford's
Sustainability and Energy
Management Executive Office, the
focus does not solely lie on new sus
tainable buildings.
"Stanford is looking at overall
sustainability for the campus with a
balanced approach," Stagner said.
"There are three legs to the
approach: looking at new green
buildings, renovating existing build
ings and using an efficient utility sup
ply."
Part of the effort to reduce over
all energy use is the $15 million
Nature Capital Retrofit Program,
which aims to reduce the needs of

large energy users on campus.
Already, the Stauffer Chemistry
Building, completed in June 2(H)7,
has within 12 months cut its energy
costs by 46 percent.
Just as Stanford's administration
is taking large steps toward sustain
able buildings, students are taking
similar measures with the long-antic
ipated Green Dorm. The Green
Dorm Project, which was first con
ceived hy a group of faculty, students
and professionals, began in 2003.
Today, after a two-year period of
fundraising that netted $12 million,
the future Row house is finally
approaching the design process.
"We absolutely think it will set a
precedent for dorms on Stanford
campus," said Jonas Ketterle, a grad
uate student in mechanical engineer
ing and student leader for the Green
Dorm Project.
Ketterle added that the Green
Dorm might serve as a model for
other dorm buildings, much like the
Yang and Yamazaki Environment
and Energy Building (Y2E2) has

done for the new wave of sustainable
buildings on campus.
"What we're doing this fall is
starting to enter the design process,
with the goal of capturing all the
decisions that were made," Ketterle
said. "That way, other people can
look at the process and learn from
our successes and mistakes."
"That goes beyond the universi
ty," she added.
Indeed, the Green Dorm, along
with the rest of Stanford's energy ini
tiatives, helps to maintain Stanford's
position as a leader in sustainable
technology.
"A green dorm is a way of push
ing ahead and being a leader in the
field," Ketterle said. "I'd be surprised
if Stanford wasn't doing it —it
makes a lot of economic sense and
it's something the whole country is
moving toward."
In an effort to find even more
innovative sustainable options for
the campus, Stagner confirmed that
the University is reviewing alterna
tive energy sources like windmills for
its power supply.Though no windmill
plans are in the works — the Dish
area does not receive enough wind
— Stagner indicated that wind ener
gy might be imported from off-cam
pus.
"It's a serious consideration," he
said."We are looking very intently at
on- and off- campus renewable ener
gy supplies, like wind power and
solar power."
