## Dining works to limit food wastage Compost bins and smaller plates lessen waste 
### AN LE NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Returning Stanford students will
have noticed a peculiar change in
their dining halls this school year.
Rather than simply loading their
trays onto return conveyors after
meals, students are now required to
scrape their excess food into com
post bins.
Ibis recent change is one facet of
Stanford Dining's "Love Food, Hate
Waste" program, a new approach to
sustainable dining that aims to
reduce food waste.
In addition to composting left
overs. dining halls are providing
smaller, nine-inch plates and smaller

portion sizes to limit the amount of
discarded food. Students can find
signs posted throughout dining halls
that explain the cycle of food waste
and the University's efforts to reme
dy its problems. Hashers and student
helpers will also stand by tray
returns to remind diners about the ill
effects of food waste.
I"he underlying assumption is that
these measures will encourage stu
dents to take only what they can con
sume.
In the push to limit food waste.
Stanford Dining also aims to lessen
the environmental impact of human
carelessness. When excess food is
thrown out. it accumulates in land
fills and releases methane, a harmful
greenhouse gas. into the environ
ment.
Under the "Love Food, Hate
Waste" program, food scraps are
delivered to a composting facility,
where they are converted into fertil
izer used to grow food. To a similar
effect, oil from the dining halls will
be turned into hio-diesel fuel.
For Tommy Tobin ' 10. Co-director
of the Stanford Project On Hunger
(SPOON), one of the most critical
components of the "Love Food.
Hate Waste" program is raising
awareness. By using dining halls,
Stanford Dining makes an impres
sion on freshmen who are required

to live on a meal plan but are unac
customed to dining buffet-style
everyday.
"In the beginning of the quarter,
when people don't know how much
they can eat. waste will go very
high." Tobin said. "What the goal of
the program is. in my view, is that at
the very beginning, [dining halls
should | bring that high level down to
a moderate range and then it will
lower throughout the quarter and
the year."
Dining Executive Director Eric
Montell emphasized in an email to
The Daily the educational aspect of
Dining's program.
"We place students and employ
ees in front of tray returns to raise
awareness about food waste and

scrape food waste into bins before
the student's eyes," Montell said.
"Students will see facts about the
impact of food waste nationally and
globally around the dining hJI and
on table-top newsletters. More infor
mation about the cycle of food waste
and Stanford Dining's efforts to
reduce our impact will be provided
on signs next to the tray returns."
Montell also noted that students
with clean plates will receive a "Love
Food. 1 late Waste" pin.
According to Elaine Albertson
'11, chair of Sustainability Initiatives
for the ASSU. it is crucial to demon
strate that "the culture here is one of
sustainability. one of not producing
excess waste, one of being cost-con
scious because food is expensive."

While Stanford Dining has done
much to be environmentally friend
ly, other universities, including UC-
Berkeley. have gone a step further in
their sustainability efforts by intro
ducing tray-less dining. These institu
tions argue that removing trays will
encourage students to take less food
and hence create less waste.
A 2008 study by ARAMARK
Higher Education found that tray
less dining reduces food waste by 1.2
to 1.8 ounces per person per meal.
This translates to a 25 to 30 percent
decrease in wasted leftovers. As an
added benefit, dining halls reduce
water and energy consumption oth
erwise used to wash trays.
"I don't think students are going
to make an intense change in their

behavior unless it's something that is
immediate and affects their lives in a
very pressing way," Albertson said.
The removal of trays, however,
presents inconveniences, said
Montell.
"Most every article or interview
of the trayless program has generat
ed complaints from students and
customers as well," Montell said in
an email to The Daily. "The trays
serve a purpose of providing the
ability for students to be able to get
their food from the servery. meet
with their fellow students and not
need to constantly get up to go back
for an item they were unable to
carry."
Montell also emphasized the din
ing staff continuing to foster a close

relationship with students. Tray-less
dining, he suggested, takes some
thing away from this experience.
"The Stanford dining halls create
a community similar to your home,"
he said, "except with many, many
more food selections."
Nevertheless, advocates and
opponents of tray-less dining agree
on one point when it comes to sus
tainability â€” the key goal is to get
the message across to students.
"By breeding a generation of
Stanford kids with a mindset that
sustainability is important, you'll
have a greater effect on the world."
Albertson said.
