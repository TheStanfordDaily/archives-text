## Can't make office hours? Check Facebook! 
### E. BLAIR LAING STAFF WRITER 
Have you ever considered the
possibility that your Teaching
Assistants (TAs). professors.
Resident Fellows (RFs) or
even the deans could be stalk
ing you on Facebook?
Well, you can rest assured — they're
probably not. But that doesn't mean that
they don't have, and use, Facebook.
Many younger TAs and faculty members,
who are or were still in school when Face
book was created, have Facebook pages.
Peter Mann, a history grad student, doesn't
actively add his students, but he will accept
friend requests.
"I feel like whatever builds a sense of ca
maraderie in the classroom is beneficial for
my teaching style," he said.
What seems a little stranger to students is
that some older faculty and staff members
use Facebook as well.
Branner RF and Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR) Professor Nancy Buffing
ton is one member of the Stanford faculty
who has a Facebook page. Like Mann — and
all other faculty and staff interviewed — she
does not friend her students, but will accept
their friend requests.
"I first got a Facebook account to have an
other, less formal, way to connect with my
students," Buffington said. "It's fun to find
out who we know in common, who has the
same favorite books or music."
While sharing this information can be fun.
it can also cause some problems. Many stu
dents post information that they would
rather not let anyone outside of their peer
groups see.

"There are things on my Facebook page
that [faculty] don't need to know and that are
not affecting my performance in class." said
Crystal Kyaw '10. "It makes the relationship
in the classroom a little bit more complex."
Mann had a simple suggestion for han
dling this issue — if you don't want your
teachers to see your Facebook profile, don't
add them.
"As with student Facebook pages, it
comes down to common sense." Buffington
agreed, "thinking about how different audi
ences would react to any content you post."
In contrast with the many students who
confess to be Facebook addicts, some faculty
who have Facebook don't find it particularly
entertaining.
Clyde Moneyhun. Branner RF and direc
tor of the Hume Writing Center, first got
Facebook about four years ago.
"I was interested in exploring what it was
about." Moneyhun said. "It's huge, it's fun
and it's brilliant. It invites you in."
Despite the fun. Moneyhun hasn't found
Facebook very valuable.
"It's not super useful to me." he said."l ba
sically never check it."
Other professors, however, do find Face
book to be somewhat useful.
Professor Donna Hunter of the PWR de
partment originally signed up for Facebook
to explore it in relation to one of her classes.
Now. she occasionally logs on.
"Sometimes I'll check Facebook if I can't
remember a student's name." Hunter said.
"Sometimes I will post on it — articles and
things."
Professors Greg and Susan Watkins. the
RFs in East Florence Moore, both have Face
book pages. Neither of them logs on very
often, but they have found some features to
be convenient.

"I think Facebook is
the best way to get c
hold of students."
- Dean Julie

"Keeping in touch with people who have
graduated has been great," Greg Watkins
said. "And we do post pictures from events at
the dorm. But there are no real benefits with
current students."
"Our primary motivation was getting in
touch with people who weren't getting in
touch with us via email," Susan Watkins
added.
And while neither RF uses Facebook fre
quently, they have noticed a slow evolution in
their friend base.
"It felt a little weird at first, but now it is a
mix of RF relationships and friends," Greg
Watkins said.
Perhaps the most commonly friended
member of the faculty and staff at Stanford is
Dean of Freshmen Julie Lythcott-Haims. She
originally went on Facebook to check for
copyright infringement of the Stanford Face
book, and had to make an account to try it out.
"I started getting these friend requests
and 1 didn't know what they were," Lythcott-
Haims said.
Now she uses her Facebook account senii
regularly. updating her status and accepting

friend requests from students. She has also
found Facebook to be extremely useful on
occasion.
"1 think Facebook is the best way to get a
hold of students," she said.
For example, she will message students
who are not responding to emails, something
other professors have found effective as well.
She also organized the rally following last
October's football upset over USC by start
ing a Facebook event and inviting all of her
friends.
"Within minutes it was spreading like
wildfire," Lythcott-Haims said.
In her speech at Discover Stanford, an
event at New Student Orientation last month.
Lythcott-Haims made several references to
information she'd learned from reading dis
cussion threads in the Facebook group "The
Official Stanford Class of 2012." She also oc
casionally posted in the group, where some
students responded enthusiastically.
Still, other students admit to being sur
prised when they're contacted on Facebook

wr by professors or ad
ministrators.
"I would be like
'woah,'" said Janelle
Leatherwood "10. "Facehook is

one place where I'm not ready to have all
types of communication available. Not that I
would mind stalking professors — that
would be fun."
The potential of students to stalk their
professors. RFs or even deans raises another
issue — is there any regulation of the content
of these Face book pages? Technically, there's
none that anyone knows of. The University,
however, does have expectations for its fac
ulty and staff.
"The Umversity expects staff and profes
sors to maintain appropriate relationships,"
Lythcott-Haims said.
Hunter agrees that students and faculty
should maintain a certain distance.
"I think that Facebook should be used
sparingly by professors — at least in their in
teractions with students," he said. "There
should he an unspoken boundary. We should
be using common sense rules about how to
use that space."
