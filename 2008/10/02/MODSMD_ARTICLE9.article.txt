At the Graduate Student Council (GSC)
meeting last night, members of the GSC voted
unanimously to grant funding requests for vari
ous graduate student groups, with only one
request facing opposition.
In the last action of the meeting. Fen Zhao, a
graduate student in applied physics, proposed a
budget of about $1,500 for her and fellow coun
cilmember George Bloom to attend a conference
at the University of Minnesota.
Zhao felt that attending the conference would
be an excellent way to learn from, contribute to
and communicate with other student councils.
"Basically, we want to send two people to this
meeting to make sure our voice is heard and to
hear what other universities have to say," said
Polina Segalova, council co-chair and graduate
student in mechanical engineering.
Two council members opposed the $1,500
funding and three abstained, but ultimately the

motion passed and funding was granted.
Addy Satija, a graduate student in electrical
engineering, led the funding section of the meet
ing which included requests from Spicmacay, a
South Asian music and arts organization, which
was granted $280 to hold a welcome event and
$325 for an October concert.
Maryam Liaqat '09 was present for Pakistanis
at Stanford, an organization that was granted
$700 to hold an Eid celebration dinner marking
the end of Ramadan, the Islamic month of fast
ing.
The Chinese Women Collective, which focuses
on addressing the issues of female students with
Chinese background or interest in Chinese cul
ture, received $900 to hold an annual dinner and
recruiting event.
Members of the GSC also granted $1,100 to
the Stanford India Association to hold a welcome
party for incoming Indian graduate students, and
$720 to the Asian American Graduate Student
Association to hold two bubble tea socials and a
pumpkin carving event.
A few groups seeking funding were not pres
ent at the meeting, and the diversity committee
presentation was postponed.
