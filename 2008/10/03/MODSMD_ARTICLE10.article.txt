# RESTAURANT REVIEW
## Sprout serves up sleek salads and sandwiches 
### 
When you're hungry, but can't figure out exactly
what to eat, sandwiches and salads are usually a
safe bet. For years Pluto's has been the go-to place
on University Ave. for such nourishment, but now there's a
new player in the salad and sandwich scene: Sprout Cafe.
Located in the space previously occupied by Windy's (next to
American Apparel), Sprout offers what it bills as healthy food
made from fresh ingredients at reasonable prices.
Entering Sprout, you will be faced with a somewhat cav
ernous space and what appears to be consciously minimalist
decor. In fact, the minimalism begins with the sign outside
which is so subtle that my dining partner and 1 nearly walked
right past the restaurant, despite the fact that we were specifi
cally seeking it out. While still both casual and modern, the
interior provides a refined simplicity fit for the sophisticated
professional as opposed to the Disneyland-style spaceport
theme at Pluto's that seems more appropriate for a five-year
old boy.
Ordering can be as easy or difficult as you like, with the
option of picking a pre-designed sandwich or salad or build
ing your own. A few of the options on the menu include tra
ditional choices like Caesar to more original combinations
like a "fruity salad" with various berries, apples and walnuts.
Of course, if none of the salads on the menu are appealing,

you can design your own, picking from
your choice of seven greens and a wide
variety of fruits, vegetables and other
common salad ingredients. For some
more substance in your salad, options
include chicken, steak and seared tuna.
Salad prices vary, but they start around
six dollars and can run to around $12
depending on the contents. Though it is

good to know that you can get 10 percent off everything by
showing your student ID.
While salads are the main attraction at Sprout, there is
also a small menu of sandwiches that vary in their sophistica
tion from something as mundane as turkey breast to more
interesting temptations, like shrimp or grilled eggplant sand
wiches. All of the sandwiches go for around eight dollars.
Somewhat surprisingly, there is no explicit choice to build
your sandwich.
My dining partner and I ordered at the counter, where
the woman working the register was friendly but seemed to
have been hired no more than three hours prior to our
arrival. Numbers were provided to put on the table so the

food could be brought to us when it was
ready, though unfortunately, that didn't
actually happen for quite some time. The
wait for the salads was inexplicably long

considering nothing needed to be cooked, and the place was
virtually empty. It makes you wonder how long it would take
to get a salad during a busy lunch hour. The salads were all
elegantly presented and were quite large.
Quality, however, was mixed. The greens were fresh, as
were things like onion and corn. The chili lime vinaigrette
was excellent. Avocado, on the other hand, showed far more
than a spec of brown, and the seared Ahi tuna was just not
good. It appeared to have been cooked appropriately, but
either wasn't fresh or was not a high-quality cut of fish.
The eggplant sandwich was somewhat skimpy in size com
pared to the salads, but aside from that, there was no basis to
complain about the tasty combo with cheese, tomato and pesto

on a ciabatta-esque bun. Perhaps the low point of the meal was
the side of pork potstickers, which took so long to come that we
had forgotten we had ordered them to begin with. The server
apologized by saying the first batch had been burned and, "we
wouldn't want to serve you burnt pot stickers." But looking at
how well done the potstickers on the plate were, one could only
wonder if there was anytliing left of the first batch aside from ash.
Sprout wasn't quite a disaster, but it was disappointing.
For a place that makes a point of its fresh, high-quality ingre
dients, a lot was left to be desired, and the service was flat-out
weak. And pulling off bad service really takes skill at a place
where orders are taken at the counter. Granted, the eatery is
fairly new and might just need time to work out the kinks,
but they do have a lot of work to do.
