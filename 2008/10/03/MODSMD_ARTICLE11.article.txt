# FILM REVIEW
## "Duchess" brings the booze, sex and period costumes but leaves everything else behind 
### 
A skeletal synopsis of "The
/\ Duchess" makes it sound a lot
L A»more interesting than it actual
ly is: sex, wine, sex, wine, breakfast,
token bi-curious scene for all the
poor guys that got dragged to this
movie, more wine, more breakfast.
Seems hard to screw up, right? But
rather than fulfilling the role of
"guilty pleasure period movie" along
the lines of "The Other Boleyn Girl,"
or serious and insightful English
biopic like "The Queen," "The
Duchess" unsuccessfully straddles
the line between the two as a dreary
snapshot of the life of Georgiana

Cavendish, the Duchess of
Devonshire. While it seems eager to be
taken seriously as a work of film, the
script provides very little intellectual
backbone to hold it up.
We meet Georgiana (Keira
Knightley) at the tender age of 16,
when she first finds out about her
optimistic engagement to the Duke of
Devonshire. She's elated, but the
moment she asks, "Does he love me,
Mama?" you just know it's going to be
another one of those period movies.
The kind of period movie revolving
around a loveless (and occasionally
abusive) relationship, where all the

audience can do is marvel at the cos
tumes and lament the horrible situa
tion of women in Those Days.
Indeed, the duke, played by an
impressively cold Ralph Fiennes,
shows more affection to his dogs than
his new wife. Tensions rise (and his
eyes begin to wander) when
Georgiana gives birth to two baby girls
but fails to provide him with an heir.
The plotline continues familiarly,
plodding along in the footsteps of
more innovative period movies, and
proves underwhelming at the finish.
Freedom and sacrifice emerge as
the two central themes of the moviy\

though neither is fully explored or challenged. Georgiana discovers a pas
sion for politics while attending a Whig Party banquet, and while she
wonders aloud why the right to vote cannot be extended to all men, she
seems satisfied to support the party's wishy-washy stance of "more free
dom for more people, soonish." As one Whig orator rallies the crowd with
a roar of "Change! Change is upon us!' the reviewer couldn't help but
wonder if the film was explicitly referencing the Obama campaign or if
her mind has iust gone into political overload.
Sacrifice, or as the duke phrases it, "common decency over personal
gratification," is revisited again and again through Georgiana's relation
ship with her children. While motherhood is a duty that she never seems
enthusiastic about, maintaining an active presence in her children's lives
becomes more important than Georgiana's own happiness.
"The Duchess" does succeed in addressing the dangers of our celebri
ty-crazed culture, showing how the importance of maintaining a facade
for the public can be devastating to an individual's personal life.
Georgiana must make several heart-wrenching decisions for the sake of
her image — and though she sacrifices love in order to "save face," it does
n't seem like she had much of a choice in the matter. While Princess
Diana (Georgiana's direct descendent) is never explicitly referenced, her
difficult life and tragic death overshadow the film and give it much-need -
ed relevance to today's world.
"The Duchess" is neither a pleasurable movie-going experience nor a
satisfyingly cathartic one, and doesn't give us anything we didn't see in
"Marie Antoinette" (minus the '80s punk soundtrack) or read in "The
Diana Chronicles" (plus period costume). While it flirts with social com
mentary, it never takes enough of a stance to be thought-provoking, and
though there may be a certain amount of bodice-ripping, it isn't fun
enough to justify seeing in theaters.
