# FILM REVIEW
## "Duchess" brings the booze, sex and period costumes but leaves everything else behind 
### 
A skeletal synopsis of "The
/\ Duchess" makes it sound a lot
L AÂ»more interesting than it actual
ly is: sex, wine, sex, wine, breakfast,
token bi-curious scene for all the
poor guys that got dragged to this
movie, more wine, more breakfast.
Seems hard to screw up, right? But
rather than fulfilling the role of
"guilty pleasure period movie" along
the lines of "The Other Boleyn Girl,"
or serious and insightful English
biopic like "The Queen," "The
Duchess" unsuccessfully straddles
the line between the two as a dreary
snapshot of the life of Georgiana

Cavendish, the Duchess of
Devonshire. While it seems eager to be
taken seriously as a work of film, the
script provides very little intellectual
backbone to hold it up.
We meet Georgiana (Keira
Knightley) at the tender age of 16,
when she first finds out about her
optimistic engagement to the Duke of
Devonshire. She's elated, but the
moment she asks, "Does he love me,
Mama?" you just know it's going to be
another one of those period movies.
The kind of period movie revolving
around a loveless (and occasionally
abusive) relationship, where all the

audience can do is marvel at the cos
tumes and lament the horrible situa
tion of women in Those Days.
Indeed, the duke, played by an
impressively cold Ralph Fiennes,
shows more affection to his dogs than
his new wife. Tensions rise (and his
eyes begin to wander) when
Georgiana gives birth to two baby girls
but fails to provide him with an heir.
The plotline continues familiarly,
plodding along in the footsteps of
more innovative period movies, and
proves underwhelming at the finish.
Freedom and sacrifice emerge as
the two central themes of the moviy\
