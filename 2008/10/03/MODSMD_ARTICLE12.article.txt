# MUSIC REVIEW
## Weezer produces a more sophisticated sound on "The Red Album" 
### 
2005 was a year to forget. Bush began his second presiden
tial term, the New England Patriots won their third Super
Bowl in four years and the alternative rock band Weezer
released "Make Believe," a complete dud of an album. As the
adage goes: Time heals all wounds. Dubya is preparing to clean
out his desk in the Oval Office, the New York Giants are the
reigning Super Bowl champions (having beaten none else but
the Patriots) and in June, Weezer released "Weezer" (common
ly referred to as "The Red Album"), their sixth studio album,
which is anything but a dud.
"The Red Album" is unlike any of the band's previous
work. Some similarities are merely surface-level; for example,
the album's 10 songs are over in just 40 minutes, giving it a
pace similar to the band's first album, 1994's "Weezer" aka

"The Blue Album." However, there are an additional

five bonus tracks on the deluxe edition of
"Red," adding another 20 minutes to its run

time.
Like many Weezer fans, I felt that
"Make Believe" was a tremendous disap
pointment. The songs lacked the humor,
passion and attitude that made earlier
albums so memorable. Worried that "The

Red Album" would be a repeat performance, 1
gritted my teeth, wincing as the album's open-

ing track, "Troublemaker," started. I was, to say the

least, pleasantly surprised. It was funny. It was passionate. And,
if there was one image that popped into my mind as the song
played through its super-catchy chorus, it was of lead singer

Rivers Cuomo flipping the bird to all of the
listeners who thought he might have lost his
edge.
From there on out, "The Red Album"
is alternately beautiful, intricate, haunting
and fun. One thing it is not, however, is
raw. This is where most fans will attack the
band for losing its original sound. Weezer's
first two albums, the aforementioned "Blue
Album" and "Pinkerton," were coarse, vis
ceral and in-your-face. Cuomo doesn't sing

through those so much as scream, and the effect is
truly memorable. "The Red Album" shows us a much more
subtle group of songwriters, more mature than before, with a

lot more to say.
The band's earlier albums are great because
they keep the intensity high throughout. The

songs on "Red" arc more diverse and thoughtful
ly composed. "The Greatest Man That F.ver
Lived," the album's second track, goes through
about 10 style changes in half as many minutes.
It feels more like a rock opera than a Weezer
song, but it is still familiar in an undeniably, well

weird kind of way.
Another unique aspect of "Red" is the

amount of contribution from other band members.

Unlike previous albums, where Cuomo writes and sings nearly
every song, "Red" has at least one song sung by each member
of the band. While I appreciate the effort, it ends up being

more distracting than anything.
"Thought I Knew," the album's
seventh track, is written and
sung by guitarist Brian Bell. This
song is noticeably different from
the rest of the album, not to
mention the rest of the Weezer
catalog. But this, 1 think, is the
point. This is not "The Blue
Album," this is not the same
group of kids screaming their

lungs out on every song; they're saying, "This is who we are,
and if you don't like it, fuck off."
"Pork and Beans," the album's first single, further empha
sizes this point. Cuomo sings the song's catchy hook bluntly,
yet politely: "I don't give a hoot about what you think." The
song's lyrics speak very honestly about the lousy state of affairs
for career musicians: changing your image to look cool and be
hip, compromising musical integrity to placate the idiocy and
goldfish attention span of the modern youth. The whole point
of loving Weezer is that you understand that they actually
don't care about glamour and being cool — that being origi
nal, if slightly strange, is far more valuable.
"The Red Album" is proof that Weezer understands this as
well. Finally.
