# Don't fall off the courtship! Roxy says you should stay onboard

Licking ketchup off my lips during a ham
burger nosh fest witli some guy friends, I wit
nessed the slow death of courtship in action.
"See, I could take a girl out to a nice
dinner or take her out for a romantic ride on
my boat," said blonde hipster friend through a
particularly juicy mouthful, "but I just never
get around to it. 1 mean, what's the point real
ly?"
How sad to see a man so accustomed
to random poontang that he no longer deigns
to make an effort with the opposite sex.
The days of book-carrying and Coke
float-sharing are gone forever. Why should we
care? In a time when a woman came this close
to earning a presidential nomination, the old

traditions of courtship can seem antiquated
and even regressive. Women no longer have to
be housewives and secretaries—they are
CEOs and breadwinners, and they can cer
tainly be the aggressors in relationships.
I, for one, love to get what I want. But
I'm not about to leap into just anyone's bed. I
have some standards. 1 like to establish emo
tional commitment before romping. Random
impersonal sex can be fun at the time, but get
ting close to a person makes space for all kinds
of kinky bedroom action—bust out the whip
and the furry handcuffs. What's the fun in
exploring your wildest fantasies with someone
you don't even know you like, or likes you for
that matter?

These are the days of
instant gratification and

impersonal communica
tion—text messaging, I Ms,

Facebook, MySpace,
Twitter, YouPorn...Human

connection requires so little
effort on our part that we have to

work extra hard not to be lazy with one

another. Knowing someone deeply is one
of the best feelings in the world; sex with
someone you love is tough to beat. And don't
call me old-fashioned.
Courtship isn't about cheesy rituals
or going through some silly motions, it's
about sharing and caring for another person.

Historically, men have been the
ones brandishing roses on
doorsteps, pulling out chairs
and footing the bill. Gender

0 equality shouldn't mean that men
can relax. Women just get to initiate

romance too, and perhaps pay for dinner
every now and then. Problems arise

when both sexes get lazy. Instead of experi-

encing something fabulous together, every
body gets shafted.
Go ahead, be naughty. But make oth
ers work before they get a piece of your hot
ass. Putting your wiles to work is half the fun,
and you get to find someone special in the
process.
