hairs squeaked audibly and over 150
I I pairs of lungs held their breath in
as acclaimed director and
i». visual artist Robert Wilson stood to deliver
)an unforgettable theatrical speech this past
Wednesday in a packed Kresge Auditorium.
Throughout a provocative telling of the artis
tic inspiration he'd found in his life, Wilson
kept his audience alert with both long-held
eerie silences and outbursts of animalistic
shrieking, emphasizing an element of theatre
that has been unique to his work: hearing
with the whole body.

Wilson, age 66, is most known for his
first theatre performance, "Deafman Glance"
a seven-hour silent production that debuted
in 1971. He has since produced a great num
ber of celebrated original performances,
operas and visual art displays for interna
tional audiences. He has been described by
the New York Times as "a towering figure in
the world of experimental theatre" and hon
ored with several lifetime achievement
awards for his work on and off the stage.
Wilson illuminated for the audience at
Kresge some of the most important influ
ences for his art, using slides, movement and,
most effectively, sound. While New York
operas like "M.Butterfly" and Balanchine's
abstract ballet shaped the aesthetic of his
work, perhaps Wilson's most significant
inspiration was his adoption of a deaf mute
boy, Raymond Andrews, in his late twenties.
His interactions with Raymond would
prompt Wilson to direct his signature piece,
"Deafman Glance," and to further explore the
unconventional ways in which sound can be
felt by the body.

On adopting the boy, Wilson said, "My
life was changed forever."
"1 was preoccupied with what I was
hearing," he added. "| Raymond] saw things I
couldn't see, his whole body was hearing."
With this unique sensibility, Wilson
looked for more ways to defy space and time
in his work. In doing so, he has had a pro
found effect on the performing arts world,
including the many drama majors and com
munity members who came out to Kresge on
Wednesday.
The audience appeared enthralled with
Wilson's speech and the abstract images he
used to describe his concepts of sound and
art.
"1 feel like the core of myself has been
shaken out of its plastic wrapper," remarked
drama major Michelle Sutherland '09.
"[Wilson] is an amazing director... he has a
visual language that is really beautiful and a
persona on stage that is tangible and com
pelling."
Logan Hehn '12, who came with several
friends, noted, "Each of us took something

different away from his lecture.
"I identified with his deaf son — my sis
ter is autistic — so seeing that in his creative
process was so cool," Hehn continued. "There
was so much [in the speech] to take in, I'm
still confused. It was totally clear, and yet I
really have to think about it all a second
time."
Wilson is the first speaker featured in the
2008-09 Presidential Lecture Series, co-spon
sored by the Humanities Center, the drama
department and Stanford Lively Arts. He will
be working with the drama department's
Michael Ramsaur and the dance division's
Aleta Hayes on designing a part of her
upcoming production, "The Waste Land in
Black and White."
