# A 						visit by Cynthia Gregory, ballerina extraordinaire
## 
### 
Being quite the opposite of a ballet
connoisseur, I wasn't sure what to
expect of world renowned ballerina
and choreographer Cynthia Gregory's wild
ly anticipated master class. Thankfully, this

ignorant spectator was eased in quite like how

the students were: The class began with thirty minutes

of warm-up, led by Kristine Elliott, lecturer in the Dance
Division.
I was given a brief glimpse into the technicalities of bal
let as 23 bodies stretched and twisted muscles I didn't even
know existed. The athleticism and aestheticism were infused
into their movements from the very beginning.
Accompanied by a live pianist, the Stanford students in this
quarter's Advanced Ballet section gave me a stirring sense of
what was to come.
A flutter of students stashing away their warm-up bars
signaled Gregory's arrival.
"Hello everyone," she greeted us, a pleasant smile on her
face.
Dressed in neutral colors and a closely cropped hair
style, Gregory looked surprisingly unassuming for an inter
national ballet virtuoso. She began her career in San
Francisco, catapulting to fame shortly after in New York,
where she dazzled audiences and fellow dancers alike.

Gregory played lead roles in both classical and con
temporary works, including "Sleeping Beauty," "Don
Quixote" and "At Midnight," but found her defini
tive moment in her New York debut as Odette-
Odile in "Swan Lake."
It was hard not to be at least a little awestruck in the
face of her accomplishments. The entire class listened

as Gregory introduced herself, then gave us insight
into the motivations behind her dancing.
"I dance first for the music," she said, "and then for the
audience." The audience, she emphasized, was with her each
time she danced.
As for the hardest thing she ever did?
"Probably ... the full-length version of Raymonda," a
ballet choreographed by Marius Petipa in the late 1800s.
It was precisely a segment from this ballet, painting an
exuberant celebration at a wedding, which Gregory taught
the master class. She concentrated, in addition, on her top
three favorite talking points for dance: music, style and
focus.
As the class began, Gregory gave simple comments, such
as "exaggerate the chin movement," "more energy in the feet"
and "arms above the shoulders!" all combined to draw out
the dancers' expressiveness. She managed to pinpoint specific
flaws in their movements with a hawk-like accuracy, but

taught, still, with grace.
It was this combination of precision and beauty that
characterized, even more so, her dancing. The moment I saw
her demonstrate an eight-beat count of dance, it was hard
not to be impressed. The sense of purpose woven into her
movements was profoundly moving; I couldn't help but
think that she danced like the air itself, light but perceptibly
there, present in every way. It exhibited a real attempt to con
nect to the class' intimate audience.
The students, of course, were thrilled to have her there.
Colette Posse '12 had highly anticipated the special class.
"The best part is being able to learn from someone so
famous, with all that experience," she said.
Kimberly Souza '11, agreed.
"She's one of those dancers you've watched videos of
since you were little and always aspired to be like . . . her
enthusiasm was great," she said. "It was a laid-back atmos
phere where the main goal was to have fun and share your
love for ballet."
