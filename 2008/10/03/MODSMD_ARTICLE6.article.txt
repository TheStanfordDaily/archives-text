# ANIMATION DOMINATION

### 
The Simpsons
Entering into their unprecedented 20th
season, "The Simpsons" have officially
been on the airwaves longer than some
members of the freshmen class have been
alive. Titled "Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes" the
421st episode follows Homer as he pursues
the life of a bounty hunter after a run-in with
the law, while Marge unknowingly finds her
self working for an erotic bakery.
Yes, the plot does sound funny and even
seems to have potential — but unfortunately,
as has been fairly standard the last couple
seasons, the episode left me with a resound
ing "meh." Don't get me wrong, I love "The
Simpsons," but I don't think anyone can deny
that the series is well past its prime. One can
only have so many novel ideas and milk them
for jokes, and after 421 plots, it's not too sur
prising that the jokes and cliches are starting
to run a little stale.
The episode provides a few smiles but
hardly any laughs, and that doesn't bode well
for the rest of the season. "The Simpsons" are
an American institution and will continue to
get viewers. Are the jokes new? No. But it's
still a comfortable feeling to turn on the TV
and hear the resounding "D'oh!" come from
the speakers. lust don't expect a particularly
rewarding or fresh experience.

The brisk mornings, browning leaves and first few weeks of class signify a
major annual shift as the campus heads into the fall. Along with the tem
perature changes and the increased prevalence of pants around campus
comes potentially one of the most important developments of the fall: TV pre
mieres!
As the networks head into the fall season, a whole plethora of new shows and
old shows with new gimmicks are rolling out to draw our coveted 18-26 market ir
for another season of procrastination via the likes of Grey's Anatomy and 90210.
Fox's "Animation Domination" is unique in that it has the market completely
cornered on prime-time cartoon sitcoms. Aside from the awkwardly timed and
often schizophrenic programming found on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, Fox
is really the only other channel with a set of adult-oriented cartoon shows with
new content.
Premiering last Sunday , the "Animation Domination" consists of four well
established shows: veteran classic "The Simpsons," hillbilly comedy "King of the
Hill," college-kid powerhouse "Family Guy" and the youngest member of the Seth
McFarlane franchise, "American Dad." For those that missed it, below are reviews
of the first episodes presented and what to expect of the season to come.

King of the Hill
Heading into its 13th season, "King of
the Hill" retains its coveted spot fol
lowing "The Simpsons," as it has for
over a decade. The spiritual successor to Mike
Judge's famed "Beavis & Butt-head" series,
"King" is still following everyone's favorite
Methodist Texas family, The Hills.
Unlike other shows which primarily fea
ture outlandish situations or ridiculous flash
back sequences, "King of the Hill" focuses on
finding humor in your everyday, mundane
small-town life. The problem with its
approach is that there isn't much funny about
a small town in the first place, and after 10
years you can bet it gets nearly impossible to
find entertaining material.
The opening episode, titled "Dia-BILL-ic
Shock," focuses on Hank's balding, beer-gut
ted, war veteran friend, Bill Dauterive. As
Bill's poor, sugar-eating habits get the best of
him, he finds himself at risk of diabetes and
in a wheel chair. The episode follows his pro
gression through esteem issues and focuses on
his recovery, which is aided by a wheelchair
rugby player named "Thunder." Sound
strange? It is. Sound unfunny? It is.
While I'm sure many shows could make a
solid joke or two about a diabetic struggling
to regain his self-esteem, it doesn't quite
scratch the funny bone as one would expect
in the Arlen, Tex. setting. In fact, 1 didn't find
myself cracking a single smile throughout the
episode and rather wondering what on earth
had happened to the supposed "comedy."
If the rest of the season is shaping up to
be like this, then it seems "King of the Hill"
doesn't have long for the air. The attitude is
somber and depressing rather than funny and
uplifting. 1 would recommend breaking out
the homework for a 30-minute study break
between "The Simpsons" and "Family Guy."

Family Guy
Returned from the grave in 2000 and
then again in 2002, "Family Guy" is
far and away the ratings darling and
viewer favorite of Fox's lineup as it enters
into its seventh season on the air. Our
favorite semi-functional Quahog family is
back and better than ever as the writers in the
McFarlane studios hone their jokes, flashback
vignettes and random references to a fine
point.
The premiere episode, titled "Love
Blactually" follows Brian as he meets
Carolyn, the girl of his dreams. After being
told to take it slow by Stewie, Brian unex
pectedly loses Carolyn to one of Peter's
neighbors and spends the rest of the episode
trying to win her back.
Of the four shows, "Family Guy" shines
far and away as the best. While some people
may be sick of the "random reference" style
of story-telling, be heartened to know that
the plots themselves resemble actual stories
now rather than setups for more flashbacks.
The story flows very smoothly, much more so
than in any of the last few seasons.
The flashbacks themselves are, as always,
hit or miss. I am happy to report that the hit
percentage seems to be substantially higher
this season than the last few. The jokes are
still fresh and more often than not, jaw-drop
pingly inappropriate and offensive. The writ
ers also seem to have become even fonder of
jokes centered on timing rather than content,
which provides a nice little break from "just
like that time..." clips.
Overall the episode feels a lot more bal
anced, polished and professional than the last
few seasons. It doesn't quite match the magic
of the first episodes but the show has defi
nitely made a great set of positive strides after
a fairly lackluster season or two. If season
seven continues in the fashion it kicked off,
expect a wonderfully entertaining fall.

American Dad
The most recent of Seth McFarlane's
money-printing machines, "American
Dad" hit the Fox airwaves in later 2005
and is now entering into its fourth season.
The culmination of the Animation
Domination lineup, "American Dad" pre
mieres with the episode "1600 Candles" as it
follows our ail-American family, The Smiths,
as they set to busily planning Roger's 1600 th
birthday. They quickly become sidetracked by
Steve's announcement that he has officially
entered puberty. Horrified by their experi
ences with Hayley, Stan and Francine use
experimental medicine to try and bypass the
aging process and, as expected, hilarity
ensues.
In seasons past, ' American Dad" has been
somewhat of a disappointment. It tried to be
too much like "Family Guy" and too different
all at the same time. The first few seasons
shared the same lack of plot and plethora of
flashbacks as McFarlane's original show but
somehow it just didn't work in the D.C. set
ting of the Smith family.
Luckily, "American Dad" started shaping
up and re-inventing itself towards the end of
its last season and I'm happy to report that it
continues its very positive progress. Much like
"Family Guy" before it, "American Dad" feels
like it carries a lot more polish. The plot is
consistent, the flashbacks are more or less
gone and the jokes are relevant and funny
again. Characters like Roger still provide
absolute comic gold and Stan is a lot less jin
goistic and a lot more funny.
As the ending credits rolled 1 found
myself happy and satisfied, a welcome sur
prise as 1 had been dreading the possibility of
ruining my "Family Guy" experience with a
lackluster clone attempt. I am happy to say
that "American Dad" has definitely shaped up
into its own independent, well-written and
funny show and stands to carve a much big
ger niche for itself if it continues down this
path this season.
