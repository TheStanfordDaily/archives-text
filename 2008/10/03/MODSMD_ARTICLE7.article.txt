In the middle of splitting with his girlfriend, Jonathan Lipps '04 experienced an unantici
pated complication.
"She was Facebooking the breakup while it has happening, in real time," Lipps said.
She quickly updated their relationship status, among other details, broadcasting the
information to Lipps' network of peers and family members.
"Within an hour or so, about five or so people had commented or left a note on my wall,
asking me what had happened."
After receiving the sometimes awkward messages from his grandfather, the mother of his
friend, and others, Lipps had a new realization of the importance of the popular social net
working platform.
"It was a picture of how involved Facebook is, when 1 wasn't really aware of that," he
explained.
While Lipps took the incident with good humor, it speaks to a more and more common
reality among people in their late teens and twenties: the evolving role of Facebook in their
lives, and the innovative — and sometimes unexpected — ways in which it can be used.
Many students first start using Facebook when they know where they're attending col
lege. One of the first uses is to learn more about the people they'll be meeting, studying and
living with when their freshman year begins. The phenomenon of finding and friending stu
dents before arriving at campus has been growing, and the Class of 2012 has made an enthu
siastic start.
Mike Sanchez '12 might have more friends on Facebook than almost any other incoming
freshman. But while his hundreds of friends might be a touch excessive, Sanchez's use of
Facebook is also startlingly practical. After being admitted, Sanchez used Facebook to connect
with other admitted students, and even met up with many of them during Admit Weekend.
Almost five months before attending orientation, Sanchez was meeting with his new class
mates, who he had previously messaged or spoken to on the phone. The sole student attend
ing Stanford from his high school, Sanchez has managed to make close friends even before his
real college career has begun.
"Facebook has helped me gain a strong hold on Stanford before I got there," Sanchez
said.
Sanchez credited the platform for helping him to meet and connect with new people
amongst the confusing collection of initial strangers that makes up a college year.
"It takes the anonymity out of the process, and helps with those embarrassing first
moments," Sanchez said.
Ben Jensen '12 employed Facebook in a similar manner.
"I used it as a tool to get to know the people I would be going to school with," Jensen
said.
Jensen also quickly learned that Facebook activities (and prominence) don't go unno
ticed, after creating the Justice League, a group The Daily has covered previously. While at the
gym, he received a voicemail from the Freshmen Dean's office, asking him to re-schedule an
event that it had learned about through Facebook.
Jensen noted that the use of the platform has continued to earn a surprising amount of
attention.
"I get random e-mails from people who want the Justice League to get involved with
what they're doing," Jensen added. "I never expected Facebook to be important."
While incoming freshmen had minor complaints about the amount of time they spent
on Facebook, all of those I spoke to said they expected to use Facebook less when they actual
ly arrived at campus.
"I will probably cut back a lot," Jensen said. "I use it to connect to people. But why sit on
the computer when I can go and knock on their dorm room door?"
Speaking to older students, the practical applications of Facebook often seem lost. For

busy Stanford students in particular, Facebook soon begs the question of whether it's helping
or hurting with being productive.
Liberty Reforma '08 has used the network since around its debut in 2004. She noted that
it had advantages, but she remains careful to avoid spending too many minutes on the net
work.
"Nothing beats actually calling up or meeting up with friends, but it's a useful venue for
knowing what's going on in peoples' lives," Reforma said. "I try not to use it too much because
it can eat up your time."
Similar negative perceptions aren't hard to find. Talking about Facebook use can take on
the tone and terminology of a drug addiction: "1 was 'on' Facebook all day.""l started using
Facebook the summer after high school." "I tried to quit, but 1 couldn't stop." The shady con
notation fits with the idea that Facebook is the ultimate time-sink in an Internet already clut
tered with them.
Nat Hilliard '10 noted, however, that even if one wanted to stop using Facebook, it's
increasingly less of an option.
"It's gotten to the point where 1 can't even pass judgment on it," Hilliard said. "It's like a
fork; it's gotten to the point where you can't not use it."
He shared that when he tried to not use the service, he felt disconnected with what his
friends were doing and saying.
"I would not hear of things that were happening, and the good times that come out of
those events," Hilliard said. "I felt out of the loop."
Putting your face out there
The prevalence of Facebook among college students has caught the attention of
researchers, such as Professors Nicole Ellison and Cliff Lampe at the department of
Telecommunication, Information Studies and Media at Michigan State University.
Within a report to be presented this November, they noted that student Facebook use tended
to increase to a stable equilibrium after the first period of use, and that it remained a part of
peoples' activities afterwards.
The report, which followed Michigan State students, states that "Facebook appears to
have become integrated into participants' daily routines between 2006 and 2007, but then
once participants were integrated into the site these gains were not replicated the following
year."
From rookies to power users, the profile page for a user continues to be the focus of a
great deal of attention. Students' pages are their public face in a network that most of their
classmates are using, and the idea that they are socially significant seems firmly established. In
an email, Ellison speculated that this was one of the distinguishing factors for students' behav
ior on Facebook, as opposed to non-college users.
"College students seem to spend more time on their self-presentation (updating their
profile, for instance) and viewing/uploading/commenting on photos," she said.
Students noted that they kept public perceptions in mind when they created their per
sonal pages.
"I spent a lot of time making my profile as badass as it can be," Lipps said. "Sort of mak
ing it the least like real life."
Justin Smith '04 agreed.
"Your basic profile will always remain an important part of the experience," he said.
Smith's opinion comes from the forefront of an important new trend at Facebook. The
platform has tools to spread a lot of information quickly, and demographics that advertisers
would kill for in other mediums, centered mostly upon the coveted late teens and twenties.
Facebook came to the attention of Smith just before he graduated, and since then he has kept
a sharp eye on its fortunes. In 2006, he opened the blog "Inside Facebook," which has covered
the site's commercial prospects, writing for an audience of advertisers and application devel
opers.
"One of the challenges of advertising these days is reaching people in the 18- to 29-year
old demographic," Smith said. "They're not watching television as much, and they're spending
more time with non-traditional media."
"Facebook is a powerful way to reach a lot of people," he added.
Smith believes that the addition of new features, like the news feed and the possibility for
applications, has changed the nature of the site over time.
"1 think the core traditional use of Facebook was as a directory and a place to find out
more about people," Smith said. "That's still a core use, but it's become more of a communi
cation network. Whenever you come back to the site, there is new content."
"An application is a way to make communication between [users) be a little more rich,"
he added.
Beyond social networking
As Facebook has changed over time, and modified its users habits, some new features
have had more of an impact than others. The power and implications of the social
networking platform have also grown, sometimes beyond its users' expectations.
My own realization that Facebook might have a significant impact came in the summer
of 2006. At a party — not, to my knowledge, ever immortalized on Facebook — a friend told
me that Facebook would mean we would all still be connected to each others' lives well into
the future, more than any previous generation. This was notable not just because I don't usu
ally hear very perceptive things at parties, but because it was prophetic. The News Feed,
Facebook's most controversial feature, debuted a few months later in September 2006.
Suddenly, keeping tabs on a great deal of people took a whole lot less effort, and a brief com
pilation of the activities of a community greeted any visitor to the site. People's lives reduced
themselves to easily digestible nuggets of information. As Ellison and Lampe note in their
report, the News Feed "encouraged short sessions with the site that enabled users to quickly
see the recent activities of their friends on the site."
For researchers, the News Feed marked another crucial moment. While the News Feed
had the virtue of making it easy to check up on everyone, it also brought home to users the
idea that their actions were being watched. Suddenly, every action would pop up on a whole
lot of screens, rather than the closer friends who checked your profile more diligently. Ellison
and Lampe note in their report that "This window into peers' activities may have made users

more aware of the visibility of their own online activities, thus prompting changes in percep
tions of audience (and, perhaps, privacy settings)."
Privacy concerns have since become a part of the Facebook landscape, from de-tagging
photographs, blocking searches and generally making people more closely monitor the way
their online presence reflected upon them.
"It's frightening to think that all of this information is out there, and much more than we
know," Hilliard said.
While Facebook is collecting more and more information, and making itself more and
more indispensable, it has been following the cues of other major Internet institutions. What
Google is to the Internet, Wikipedia is to knowledge, and You Tube is to video, Facebook is to
people: an easy to understand, immensely powerful way to bring everything together.
If this comparison holds, it implies that on Facebook, people become content. And it's
hard to see how this isn't the case. Living, breathing people get shrunk down to two-dimen
sional photographs, with the appropriate hovering box that identifies them. A lifetime of
tastes, the indefinable qualities of what makes someone who they are condense themselves
into lists, quotes and a tasteful assortment of personal quirks. Like everything else on the
Internet, and in the current time, people find themselves driven to chip in their two cents, if
only to earn the right to learn what everyone else is doing. It's all more than a bit unsettling.
Yet in flattening people, and chipping them down to discrete pieces of content, it's also
provided Internet-attuned brains with a chance to see and make connections between people
in ways that never before would have been possible. If Facebook has become a minor but
increasingly universal part of the college experience, then it for the most part it reflects the
world the site's users are sitting in as they update their statuses and tag their photographs.
Ellison underscored that the way people use Facebook reflects greatly upon who they are.
"A 50-year-old and a 15-year-old will use Facebook for different reasons and in different
ways," Ellison said in an email. "But that's because 15-year-olds and 50-year-olds are very dif
ferent offline (in the "real world" as some say) as well."
Even if Facebook remains a part of the college landscape, students are realizing that it is
an acceptable state of affairs.
"In the end, Facebook is an all-powerful dictator, but benevolent," Hilliard said. "Maybe
in the end it's an enlightened dictator."

Privacy concerns have since become a part of the Facebook landscape, from de-tagging
photographs, blocking searches and generally making people more closely monitor the way
their online presence reflected upon them.
"It's frightening to think that all of this information is out there, and much more than we
know," Hilliard said.
While Facebook is collecting more and more information, and making itself more and
more indispensable, it has been following the cues of other major Internet institutions. What
Google is to the Internet, Wikipedia is to knowledge, and You Tube is to video, Facebook is to
people: an easy to understand, immensely powerful way to bring everything together.
If this comparison holds, it implies that on Facebook, people become content. And it's
hard to see how this isn't the case. Living, breathing people get shrunk down to two-dimen
sional photographs, with the appropriate hovering box that identifies them. A lifetime of
tastes, the indefinable qualities of what makes someone who they are condense themselves
into lists, quotes and a tasteful assortment of personal quirks. Like everything else on the
Internet, and in the current time, people find themselves driven to chip in their two cents, if
only to earn the right to learn what everyone else is doing. It's all more than a bit unsettling.
Yet in flattening people, and chipping them down to discrete pieces of content, it's also
provided Internet-attuned brains with a chance to see and make connections between people
in ways that never before would have been possible. If Facebook has become a minor but
increasingly universal part of the college experience, then it for the most part it reflects the
world the site's users are sitting in as they update their statuses and tag their photographs.
Ellison underscored that the way people use Facebook reflects greatly upon who they are.
"A 50-year-old and a 15-year-old will use Facebook for different reasons and in different
ways," Ellison said in an email. "But that's because 15-year-olds and 50-year-olds are very dif
ferent offline (in the "real world" as some say) as well."
Even if Facebook remains a part of the college landscape, students are realizing that it is
an acceptable state of affairs.

In the middle of splitting with his girlfriend, Jonathan Lipps '04 experienced an unantici
pated complication.
"She was Facebooking the breakup while it has happening, in real time," Lipps said.
She quickly updated their relationship status, among other details, broadcasting the
information to Lipps' network of peers and family members.
"Within an hour or so, about five or so people had commented or left a note on my wall,
asking me what had happened."
After receiving the sometimes awkward messages from his grandfather, the mother of his
friend, and others, Lipps had a new realization of the importance of the popular social net
working platform.
"It was a picture of how involved Facebook is, when 1 wasn't really aware of that," he
explained.
While Lipps took the incident with good humor, it speaks to a more and more common
reality among people in their late teens and twenties: the evolving role of Facebook in their
lives, and the innovative — and sometimes unexpected — ways in which it can be used.
Many students first start using Facebook when they know where they're attending col

Mike Sanchez '12 might have more friends on Facebook than almost any other incoming
freshman. But while his hundreds of friends might be a touch excessive, Sanchez's use of
Facebook is also startlingly practical. After being admitted, Sanchez used Facebook to connect
with other admitted students, and even met up with many of them during Admit Weekend.
Almost five months before attending orientation, Sanchez was meeting with his new class
mates, who he had previously messaged or spoken to on the phone. The sole student attend
ing Stanford from his high school, Sanchez has managed to make close friends even before his
real college career has begun.
"Facebook has helped me gain a strong hold on Stanford before I got there," Sanchez
said.
Sanchez credited the platform for helping him to meet and connect with new people
amongst the confusing collection of initial strangers that makes up a college year.
"It takes the anonymity out of the process, and helps with those embarrassing first
moments," Sanchez said.
Ben Jensen '12 employed Facebook in a similar manner.

said.
Jensen also quickly learned that Facebook activities (and prominence) don't go unno

gym, he received a voicemail from the Freshmen Dean's office, asking him to re-schedule an
event that it had learned about through Facebook.
Jensen noted that the use of the platform has continued to earn a surprising amount of
attention.
"I get random e-mails from people who want the Justice League to get involved with
what they're doing," Jensen added. "I never expected Facebook to be important."
While incoming freshmen had minor complaints about the amount of time they spent
on Facebook, all of those I spoke to said they expected to use Facebook less when they actual

Putting your face out there
The prevalence of Facebook among college students has caught the attention of
researchers, such as Professors Nicole Ellison and Cliff Lampe at the department of
Telecommunication, Information Studies and Media at Michigan State University.
Within a report to be presented this November, they noted that student Facebook use tended
to increase to a stable equilibrium after the first period of use, and that it remained a part of
peoples' activities afterwards.
The report, which followed Michigan State students, states that "Facebook appears to
have become integrated into participants' daily routines between 2006 and 2007, but then
once participants were integrated into the site these gains were not replicated the following
year."
From rookies to power users, the profile page for a user continues to be the focus of a
great deal of attention. Students' pages are their public face in a network that most of their
classmates are using, and the idea that they are socially significant seems firmly established. In
an email, Ellison speculated that this was one of the distinguishing factors for students' behav
ior on Facebook, as opposed to non-college users.
"College students seem to spend more time on their self-presentation (updating their
profile, for instance) and viewing/uploading/commenting on photos," she said.
Students noted that they kept public perceptions in mind when they created their per
sonal pages.
"I spent a lot of time making my profile as badass as it can be," Lipps said. "Sort of mak
ing it the least like real life."
Justin Smith '04 agreed.
"Your basic profile will always remain an important part of the experience," he said.
Smith's opinion comes from the forefront of an important new trend at Facebook. The
platform has tools to spread a lot of information quickly, and demographics that advertisers
would kill for in other mediums, centered mostly upon the coveted late teens and twenties.
Facebook came to the attention of Smith just before he graduated, and since then he has kept
a sharp eye on its fortunes. In 2006, he opened the blog "Inside Facebook," which has covered
the site's commercial prospects, writing for an audience of advertisers and application devel
opers.
"One of the challenges of advertising these days is reaching people in the 18- to 29-year
old demographic," Smith said. "They're not watching television as much, and they're spending
more time with non-traditional media."
"Facebook is a powerful way to reach a lot of people," he added.
Smith believes that the addition of new features, like the news feed and the possibility for
applications, has changed the nature of the site over time.
"1 think the core traditional use of Facebook was as a directory and a place to find out
more about people," Smith said. "That's still a core use, but it's become more of a communi
cation network. Whenever you come back to the site, there is new content."
"An application is a way to make communication between [users) be a little more rich,"
he added.
Beyond social networking
As Facebook has changed over time, and modified its users habits, some new features
have had more of an impact than others. The power and implications of the social
networking platform have also grown, sometimes beyond its users' expectations.
My own realization that Facebook might have a significant impact came in the summer
of 2006. At a party — not, to my knowledge, ever immortalized on Facebook — a friend told
me that Facebook would mean we would all still be connected to each others' lives well into
the future, more than any previous generation. This was notable not just because I don't usu
ally hear very perceptive things at parties, but because it was prophetic. The News Feed,
Facebook's most controversial feature, debuted a few months later in September 2006.
Suddenly, keeping tabs on a great deal of people took a whole lot less effort, and a brief com
pilation of the activities of a community greeted any visitor to the site. People's lives reduced
themselves to easily digestible nuggets of information. As Ellison and Lampe note in their

have become integrated into participants' daily routines between 2006 and 2007, but then
once participants were integrated into the site these gains were not replicated the following
year."
From rookies to power users, the profile page for a user continues to be the focus of a
great deal of attention. Students' pages are their public face in a network that most of their
classmates are using, and the idea that they are socially significant seems firmly established. In
an email, Ellison speculated that this was one of the distinguishing factors for students' behav
ior on Facebook, as opposed to non-college users.
"College students seem to spend more time on their self-presentation (updating their
profile, for instance) and viewing/uploading/commenting on photos," she said.
Students noted that they kept public perceptions in mind when they created their per
sonal pages.
"I spent a lot of time making my profile as badass as it can be," Lipps said. "Sort of mak
ing it the least like real life."
Justin Smith '04 agreed.
"Your basic profile will always remain an important part of the experience," he said.
Smith's opinion comes from the forefront of an important new trend at Facebook. The
platform has tools to spread a lot of information quickly, and demographics that advertisers
would kill for in other mediums, centered mostly upon the coveted late teens and twenties.
Facebook came to the attention of Smith just before he graduated, and since then he has kept
a sharp eye on its fortunes. In 2006, he opened the blog "Inside Facebook," which has covered
the site's commercial prospects, writing for an audience of advertisers and application devel
opers.
"One of the challenges of advertising these days is reaching people in the 18- to 29-year
old demographic," Smith said. "They're not watching television as much, and they're spending
more time with non-traditional media."
"Facebook is a powerful way to reach a lot of people," he added.
Smith believes that the addition of new features, like the news feed and the possibility for
applications, has changed the nature of the site over time.
"1 think the core traditional use of Facebook was as a directory and a place to find out
more about people," Smith said. "That's still a core use, but it's become more of a communi
cation network. Whenever you come back to the site, there is new content."
"An application is a way to make communication between [users) be a little more rich,"
he added.
Beyond social networking
As Facebook has changed over time, and modified its users habits, some new features
have had more of an impact than others. The power and implications of the social
networking platform have also grown, sometimes beyond its users' expectations.
My own realization that Facebook might have a significant impact came in the summer
of 2006. At a party — not, to my knowledge, ever immortalized on Facebook — a friend told
me that Facebook would mean we would all still be connected to each others' lives well into
the future, more than any previous generation. This was notable not just because I don't usu
ally hear very perceptive things at parties, but because it was prophetic. The News Feed,
Facebook's most controversial feature, debuted a few months later in September 2006.
Suddenly, keeping tabs on a great deal of people took a whole lot less effort, and a brief com
pilation of the activities of a community greeted any visitor to the site. People's lives reduced
themselves to easily digestible nuggets of information. As Ellison and Lampe note in their
report, the News Feed "encouraged short sessions with the site that enabled users to quickly
see the recent activities of their friends on the site."
For researchers, the News Feed marked another crucial moment. While the News Feed
had the virtue of making it easy to check up on everyone, it also brought home to users the
idea that their actions were being watched. Suddenly, every action would pop up on a whole
lot of screens, rather than the closer friends who checked your profile more diligently. Ellison
and Lampe note in their report that "This window into peers' activities may have made users

more aware of the visibility of their own online activities, thus prompting changes in percep
tions of audience (and, perhaps, privacy settings)."
Privacy concerns have since become a part of the Facebook landscape, from de-tagging
photographs, blocking searches and generally making people more closely monitor the way
their online presence reflected upon them.
"It's frightening to think that all of this information is out there, and much more than we
know," Hilliard said.
While Facebook is collecting more and more information, and making itself more and
more indispensable, it has been following the cues of other major Internet institutions. What
Google is to the Internet, Wikipedia is to knowledge, and You Tube is to video, Facebook is to
people: an easy to understand, immensely powerful way to bring everything together.
If this comparison holds, it implies that on Facebook, people become content. And it's
hard to see how this isn't the case. Living, breathing people get shrunk down to two-dimen
sional photographs, with the appropriate hovering box that identifies them. A lifetime of
tastes, the indefinable qualities of what makes someone who they are condense themselves
into lists, quotes and a tasteful assortment of personal quirks. Like everything else on the
Internet, and in the current time, people find themselves driven to chip in their two cents, if
only to earn the right to learn what everyone else is doing. It's all more than a bit unsettling.
Yet in flattening people, and chipping them down to discrete pieces of content, it's also
provided Internet-attuned brains with a chance to see and make connections between people
in ways that never before would have been possible. If Facebook has become a minor but
increasingly universal part of the college experience, then it for the most part it reflects the
world the site's users are sitting in as they update their statuses and tag their photographs.
Ellison underscored that the way people use Facebook reflects greatly upon who they are.
"A 50-year-old and a 15-year-old will use Facebook for different reasons and in different
ways," Ellison said in an email. "But that's because 15-year-olds and 50-year-olds are very dif
ferent offline (in the "real world" as some say) as well."
Even if Facebook remains a part of the college landscape, students are realizing that it is
an acceptable state of affairs.
"In the end, Facebook is an all-powerful dictator, but benevolent," Hilliard said. "Maybe
in the end it's an enlightened dictator."
