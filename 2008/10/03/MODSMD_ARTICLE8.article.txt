# FiLM REVIEW
## Cera and Dennings light up an otherwise careless film 
### 
After the massive success of "Juno" and "Superbad,"
Michael Cera returns to the teen comedy-drama once
more with "Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," which
opens nationwide today. Cera plays Nick, the only straight
member of an underground queercore band named The Jerk
Offs.
Nick is trying desperately to get over his recent breakup
with Tris, (Alexis Dziena, wearing enough lip gloss that we
know she's the villain the moment we meet her) but still con
stantly sends her mix CDs, complete with his own cover art
and liner notes. Though Tris is predictably unappreciative,
the CDs completely infatuate her classmate Norah (Kat
Dennings), who becomes convinced that this Nick must be
her musical soulmate. On a night when every hipster in New
York City is racing to find the secret concert location of a
band named Where's Fluffy, luck and chance force Nick and
Norah together as they navigate the neon landscape in search
of the band, as well as Norah's best friend Caroline (Ari
Graynor), who gets hopelessly drunk at the first club they go
to and spends the remainder of the movie comically stum
bling around the city.
While Cera's "Nick and Norah" role is similar to those
that have made him a star,

there's an emotional
rawness to

Nick here
k that we've

yet to
l see
b;
I on in a

I charac
ter. He

112 largely
succeeds in

imbuing Nick
with a subtle, shy

vulnerability while
maintaining the deft

comic timing you'd expect from any character he
plays. Dennings is similarly strong as Norah, a high
school senior with a megastar music producer
father and more than her own fair share of issues
and insecurities. They're a great pair onscreen —
their chemistry, along with a wonderful indie rock
soundtrack and an impressive run through the
major underground rock geography of New York
— is what carries the film along.
These are teens that lead lives far more inter
esting than any actual teenager ever could — they
walk into at least seven nightclubs, never even
glanced at for looking underage. This combined
with the aural dreaminess of several of the film's
best set pieces (the final shot of Cera and Dennings
on an escalator at dawn is a true bit of movie
magic) make "Nick and Norah" a reasonably cre
ative and watchable entry into an oftentimes over
produced, prepackaged genre.
Though the film succeeds in creating dynamic
dual protagonists who often behave in unexpected
ways, it largely fails in delivering a supporting cast
to match them. Graynor is great as Caroline, who is
likely the only character in the film that resonates
with normal teens (not everyone has a straight
bass-playing friend in a gay band, but everyone has
got that friend who always gets obliterated within

10 minutes of getting to the party), but the remainder of the
supporting cast is stiff, stilted and very one-dimensional.
Both Nick and Norah have exes that are blatantly using them,
and it's hard to believe cither of the two, particularly the
more self-assured and perceptive Norah, would put up with
all their crap.
The film itself is also incredibly jumpy, trying to pack
too many narratives into too small a story, and these incon
sistencies can be extremely distracting, particularly in light of
the strong performances from Cera and Dennings. They both
deserve better support than they're getting here, and the film
will likely serve as a stepping-stone to bigger projects, partic
ularly for Dennings, who is starring in her first feature. It's an

imperfect film filled
with a handful of ntar
perfect moments, but
you are certainly made
to believe by the end of
it that its two young
magnetic stars are
both destined to go on
to great things.
