As part of a student interview panel, Intermission recendy
got a chance to sit down with Michael Cera and Kat
Dennings, the co-stars of "Nick and Norah's Infinite
Playlist," which opens nationwide today.
You'd be hard pressed to find an actor under 25 who's had a
better run of it in the last twelve months than Cera. So it only
seems fitting that our interview with him and Dennings take
place in a setting fit for a star — a cavernous board room (apdy
and pretentiously dubbed The Ambassador's Room) at the Ritz
Carlton hotel in San Francisco.
Cera, who would appear extremely slight in any setting, is
swallowed by his oversized leather chair, and neither star seems
even close to fully alert when we greet them. This is their final
interview after a weeklong press tour, Dennings tells us, and
they're going straight from the hotel to catch flights home for a
few days' rest before the press tour starts up again. They still only
look half awake as we all take our chairs. No one speaks, and just
when it seemed that our time with them would be 20 minutes of
awkward silence and uncertainty, Cera looks over and says
(maybe to us, maybe just to himself — he's constantly tossing out
one liners so quickly that it requires your rapt attention if you
want to catch them) "Wow, well, sorry about the room ... there
must be a lot of anger in here most of the time." The line is every

bit as sharp, deadpan and well timed as anything you've seen him do
onscreen, and just like that the interview is rescued.
Cera is, of course, a hugely recognizable star these days
given the success last year of "Juno" and "Superbad," but sitting
around this table of kids his own age, he is possibly the last per
son in the whole room you'd guess is a movie star. The same
can't be said of Dennings, who is probably the only person in
the room you would guess is a movie star. She is radiant in per
son, and like Cera she carries herself with much the same
demeanor she's imbued into her characters: the downward gaz
ing eyes, the quirky personality, the slowed down cadence of her
voice.
Much of the beginning of the interview is spent with jour
nalists from various other Bay Area student papers asking con
ventional questions about the new movie — some yield interest
ing answers: "My body just shut completely down, but at least
you don't have to wear sunscreen," Cera said with a smile when
asked what it was like to work on a two-month schedule of only
night shoots. But, many also do not — it was obvious that
they've answered questions like this all week, and you begin to
get the sense that promoting this movie has to be every bit as
exhausting as even the most daunting finals week.
We ask them what they think they may have done if they'd

not pursued acting (both left home in their early teens for
Hollywood) — Cera responded that he's never really considered
anything else and tells us that he wasn't ever scared to leave
home, but makes the observation that "it must be terrifying for
parents."
Dennings, however, has obviously spent much more time
thinking about this.
"A geologist," she said. "1 think I'd have been a geologist. I
have a huge rock collection at home, and I spend more money
on rocks than clothes."
Dennings' answers to most of our questions follow in this
same vein of quirkiness, and at times it's hard to tell whether this
is an image she's cultivating for herself or if she really does just
have incredibly eclectic tastes and interests (her You Tube blog
would certainly indicate the latter, if it's all for real).
We asked if she'd think about geology if she doesn't remain
an actress her whole life.
"Yeah, I think so, I mean ... acting is scary," she said. "We've
[she and Cera] both dealt with rejection a lot of times and it's
scary to not know what your next job is going to be."
Cera laughed (the same wonderfully awkward laugh you'd
hope he'd have in real life) and agreed with her, although he's in
the slightly different position of having four massively anticipat-
