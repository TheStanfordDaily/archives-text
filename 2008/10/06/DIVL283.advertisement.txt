fjr Bears QB Nate Longshore was back in a big way against the Sun Devils, throw
jng for 198 yards and three touchdowns.
4. Oregon (4-2, 2-1 Pac-10) L 44-10 v. USC
P The Ducks' defense allowed 598 yards of total offense against the Trojans — the
V -Z- result on the scoreboard was predictable.
45. Arizona State (2-3,1-1 Pac-10) L 24-10 v. California
There's a big drop-off between the Pac-10's contenders and possible pretenders
this year, and it lies right above the Sun Devils in the rankings.
liPp 6. Stanford (3-3, 2-1 Pac-10) L 28-21 v. Notre Dame
WiMfc It's tempting to rank Stanford ahead of ASU, until you consider the drubbing the
HUH Sun Devils handed the Card earlier this season.
i7. Oregon State (2-3,1-1 Pac-10) L 31-28 v. Utah
CjwmcVsl i-yle Moevao's 313 yards passing and two touchdown throws weren't quite

fIHJSfc The Bruins finally won their second game of the season following their opening

Without Jake Locker, the Huskies failed yet again to capture their first victory of
v.4. the season.
10- Washington State (1-5,0-3 Pac-10) L 28-3 v. UCLA
When you make UCLA look that good, you've got serious issues.
