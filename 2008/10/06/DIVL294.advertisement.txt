The D. E. Shaw group is a highly successful investment and
technology development firm with a team that comes from a wide
range of backgrounds. A robotics guru. A pro snowboarder. An
operatic mezzo-soprano. And a lot of people who excel in subjects
ranging from art history and literature to math and CS.
We're looking for similarly creative but pragmatic people: articulate,
curious, and driven. Our work environment is challenging but
surprisingly flexible —from the clothes you wear, to the time you
get to the office, it's pretty much up to you. And we compensate our
extraordinary people extraordinarily well.
