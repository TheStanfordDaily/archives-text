## Stanford students are not bred for comfort 
### 
More than 500 of you were lucky
enough to see Cory Booker speak
last Thursday about his efforts to re
form the city of Newark, NJ. It was a powerful
experience for us, and hopefully for many of
you. Mayor Booker shared his story of going
from Stanford — where he was a football
star, a counselor at t he Bridge and senior class
president — to Oxford on a Rhodes, to Yale
Law School, to one of the most dangerous
cities in America.
Since he's taken office, he's improved edu
cation. reduced violence and rid his office of
corruption.There is a lot more to be done, but
the leaps forward Newark has made under his
leadership are truly remarkable, and it's
largely thanks to a combination of Mayor
Booker's deep love and respect for the peo
ple of Newark and his incredible dedication
to do whatever it takes — including roaming
the streets with police officers past 3 a.m.
His work is simply stunning, and so is the
spirit behind it. lie believes everyone de
serves the same right to a happy life, and that
we should all choose our paths based on "pur
pose rather than position." And in reference
to the hard work and sacrifice, he dispatched
any sense of pity with a simple line; "Ameri
cans are not bred for comfort"
Ihis message is extremely important to all
of us. As Stanford students, we are all blessed
with incredible agency in affecting real change.
In remembering Jane and Leland Stanford's
call to "use what you take from this place to be
of greater service to others," we are reminded
that there is an urgent need tied to this calling.
We are sitting at the beginning of one of the
most important months in our nation's history.
This coming month will see decisions made
about same-sex marriage and abortion, and
the nation will elect its next leader.
Mayor Booker's call to action transcends
party lines, and we could never hope to match
his eloquence. However, we can charge our
selves with answering the call. Do not be
afraid to speak up and to be heard. This is a
time for action.This is a time to champion the
causes or candidates you believe in. So, get
out there: Work on a campaign. Knock on
doors. Share your vision for how this country
should change. We promise, this is not mun
dane work.This is life-changing.
We're not writing this just to ask you to get

involved. We're writing to apprise you of a few
of the resources and opportunities available if
you don't know where to begin, aren't sure
how to move forward or have any concerns at
all.The ASSU is working with campus VSOs
to do a massive voter registration drive. So
join us. Please make sure you and your friends
are registered. Throughout the election sea
son, we will be out in White Plaza encouraging
people to embrace their civic privilege. And if
you're not registered — get it done! Today is
the last day to register absentee for many
states. Swing by the table in White Plaza today,
and make sure you get to vote!
Want to get really engaged? Travel to a
swing state. Both major campaigns are ac
cepting volunteers in Nevada and New Mex
ico. This is the best way to help the candidate
you want to see become the next president of
the United States. Huge trips are being organ
ized right on campus. Contact the Stanford
Republicans or the Stanford Democrats/Stu
dents for Barack Obama.
An important aspect of this election sea
son will be collective dialogue and the chron
icling of our experiences. In that spirit, CSRE
is hosting a class called "Presidential Politics:
Race, Class, Gender and Faith in the 2008
Presidential Election." The first class is at 7
p.m. today in Hewlett 200. This is a fantastic
forum for discussion; you'll hear from your
peers, faculty and guests who have been in the
arena advocating for a cause. Come. Listen
and be inspired; share your thoughts and ex
periences.
We can't lose sight of our ability to affect
change in this electoral process or the person
al growth we all can derive from participa
tion. In this unique time of collective dis
course, let's engage with the process and with
one another to help achieve meaningful so
cial progress. It doesn't matter how much
you're doing, or for whom you're doing it.
What matters is that you're doing. We're here
to help however we can.
