## Sarah Palin: Overqualified? You betcha 
### 
Let's be honest: If a guy tells you that the
first thing he noticed about you was
your attractive brain, do you know
what that would make him? If you answered
either "a liar" or "not smooth." you would be
correct.
The same can be said of men — and
women — all across America with regard to
our views on Sarah Palin. Just because we
have not yet noticed Sarah Palin's brain does
not necessarily mean that she doesn't have
one. I would venture to say that the fact is all
of us (except for most of us) know that Sarah
Palin is going to be one of the super-awe
somest vice presidents ever.
How do all of us (except for the vast ma
jority of us) know she'll be so great? Her po
litical views? Of course not. Her readiness?
Don't be ridiculous. Her appeal to Joe Six-
Pack? Uhh. no.
(Trust me on this last one. 1 know a lot of
people named Joe Six-Pack. Some of my
best friends are named Joe Six-Pack. My
brother's name is Joe Six-Pack. So you can
believe me when I say Joe Six-Pack is too
busy drinking beer while working his rock
hard abs to pay attention to petty matters
like who the presidential candidates' run
ning mates are. Besides — and don't tell
Palin this — Joe Six-Pack is actually an
Obama supporter.)
No, the signs of Sarah Palin's imminent
jump toward all-around magnificence run
far beyond whether she does or does not be
lieve that dinosaurs still roam the land —
which, to her credit, she does not. Rather
than run through the same tired arguments
like so-called "experience" or "knowledge of
Supreme Court cases" or "which candidate
would win ex-most attractive person?" I
want to focus on what really separates Mrs.
Palin from the pack. Let the list begin:
1. Sarah Palin wears glasses, thus giving

her two more eyes than anyone else running
for vice president.
I"his is key. Do you wear glasses? Are you
l'our-eyed? No? Well just imagine all the
things you could see if you had four eyes.
Just close your eyes for a moment and
imagine all that extra information that you
would he able to pick up on if you had an
extra set of eyes. With our regular, human
pair of eyes, we can only see in three dimen
sions. But if you had four eyes (or wore glass
es). could you see in five dimensions? Ask
yourself that question. I won't answer it for
you. but if you said no, you're wrong.
2. Mrs. Palin's arms are fully mobile.
Although I have not really done the ex
tensive research necessary to prove this, the
fact that I believe it gives me the inalienable
right as an American to express this belief as
a proven fact.
Mrs. Palin's arm mobility — not to men
tion her opposable thumbs — will prove a
huge complement to John McCain, who has
a rather limited range of motion as a result of
injuries he incurred during his heroic tour in
the armed forces.
Say. one day, McCain is in the White
House kitchen, cooking up a recipe for sav
ing our country's economy. He has all the in
gredients, he starts mixing them together,
puts it all in the oven,and then he realizes —
gasp — that the plate he wanted to serve it
on is way up on the top shelf. What to do? No

problem. Just call Palin over to grab the
plate. With her full range of motion, the tan
dem will be serving the American public a
hearty helping of consumerism in no time.
You want a team? There's your team.
3. Mrs. Palin is fully literate in a foreign
language.
You want to claim that America invented
English? Umm.no sir. Try England.
Yet with her sharp command of a foreign
language, Mrs. Palin also has the empathy
for her fellow countrymen to understand
that here in America, we don't speak Eng
lish. like those old chaps across the Atlantic.
We don't speak Canadian, either, like our
friendly neighbors in the north. And we sure
don't speak Mexican (well, OK, some Cali
fornians speak Mexican, but you know what
I mean).
No. here in America, we speak American.
And so does Sarah Palin. You know what
that makes her? Bilingual. You know what
else? Awesome.
I'm sick and tired of pundits and spinsters
and party-line hacks trying to portray Sarah
Palin as something we ought to be afraid of,
rather than turning her into someone that
mainstream America would more readily
embrace (i.e., a dude).
Thus must I proclaim: Hear ye. fellow
Americans. Fear the woman no longer.
Sarah Palin eats, breathes and sweats the
United States of America.
Literally.
So before you vote, use your brain — be
cause. I know, somewhere between those at
tractive ears that I first noticed when I saw
you, you've not one.
