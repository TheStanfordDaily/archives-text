## Obama: Machiavelli's Prince 
### 
The right wing is desperately trying to
paint Obama as a lefty radical, and I'm
getting a little tired of it."I le's the most
liberal member of the Senate ""he's got social
ist ties," "he has no pride in America." My fa
vorite anti-Obamaism is from a friend who says
he's evil. But I don't believe Obama is socialist,
unpatriotic or evil. 1 le's just sleazy, two-faced
and mistaken.
Obama's relationships with his "Goddamn
America" pastor Jeremiah Wright.communist
community organizer Saul Alinsky, former
Fannie Mae CEO and chief campaign adviser
James Johnson. Weatherman terrorist William
Ayres and early communist mentor Frank
Marshall Davis don't bother me. He may have
used them as inspiration for his books and as a
means to advance his career, but I doubt
Obama ever considered them friends.
These figures enjoyed the pretense of a
good rapport, but Obama discarded them
once it became politically expedient. I le used
convicted real estate slumlord Tony Re/ko to
get a cheap price on his Chicago mansion and
to raise money for his campaign early on, but
he hasn't associated with him much since. I le
has a half brother living in a hut in Kenya, but
Obama hasn't given him any aid thus far,so I
don't foresee him sending troops into Kenya
to quell the violence anytime soon.
As the election looms ever closer, the right
wing will continue to dig up dirt on Obama's
questionable connections (Investor's Busi
ness Daily comes up with a new one almost
every day) but these "connections" mean
nothing, especially to Obama.
Contrary to what some conservatives
claim, these relationships don't show that
Obama at his core is a socialist, unpatriotic
black supremacist. They show that he has no
core.
These connections shed light on Obama's
lack of discernment, his willingness to com
mingle with absolutely anyone. These shady
connections fit right in with his willingness to
meet with dictators under no preconditions

He's just sleazy,
two-faced
and mistaken.

(but with "preparations"... whatever that
means).
Obama reminds me of a particular high
school stock character. He's the guy who's
liked by everyone. All of his instructors love
him for his insightful comments and folksy
charm. I le makes everyone feel good and at
ease when shooting the breeze with him. He
can talk both deeply and superficially,and he
tells people just what they want to hear.
I knew a guy like Obama in high school.
When I criticized an instructor to him, he
agreed despite "kissing up" to the instructor
in class. This two-facedness gave me pause.
When I criticized an acquaintance, he again
agreed with me. I later discovered that the
two often hung out and partied together. I re
alized that someone who is everyone's friend
must not be anyone's friend. Someone who
can be everything to everyone is really noth
ing to anyone.
No one likes to be played the fool, and
that's exactly what Obama has successfully
been doing with the media and much of the
public. McCain, too. has tried to dupe the
American people, but he's crashed and burned
so badly in recent weeks that it's questionable
whether he can rev up his engine again.
Both McCain and Obama are politicians.
They tell their audiences whatever they think
their audiences want to hear, though Obama's

clearly got a better ear and voice than McCain.
Obama is the consummate politician since
he can convince people that he's not a politi
cian. I les got most of Stanford and the media
falling head over heels for him. He could
probably even convince the media that the
sky is orange with some drawn-out philo
sophical explanation.
In this campaign, he's Machiavelli's
Prince. I le's got the intelligence and charisma
— what Machiavelli called virtu — to manip
ulate people in order to advance his own am
bitions. 'ITiat's something to admire — if you
believe in real politik. The end justifies the
means, but Obama's end is still unclear.
"("hange" is too nebulous to be considered an
end.
It's Obama's whorishness rather than his
hollowness that really gives me pause, lie's
ready to hop into bed with anyone. He even
took in Hillary and Bill after their bitter pri
mary light. I le'll blame the economy on Wall
Street and then go begging to wealthy donors
and stockholders for money. After all. he had
employed the former Fannie Mae CEO, who
made over $7 million on subprime loans, as
one of his chief campaign advisers and as one
of the three members of his vice-presidential
search team.
()bama champions the middle class in all of
his speeches while complaining to his elitist
audiences that the middle class bitterly clings
to guns and religion. ITiough there may not be
two Americas, there are at least two ()bamas.
If Barack Obama loses this election, it
won't be because of his liberal policy posi
tions. his shady connections or his elitist atti
tude. It will be because American independ
ents have woken and wised up to the fact that
he's trying to pull the wool over their eyes.
And they don't like it.
