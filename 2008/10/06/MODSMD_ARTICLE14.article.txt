GAME NOTES: Arizona is first in the Pac-10 in scoring
offense and second in the conference in scoring de
fense. The Cardinal beat the Wildcats in Tucson last
year, 21 -20. Stanford is coming off its seventh con
secutive loss to Notre Dame, as the Cardinal was not
able to complete its fourth-quarter comeback.

SOUTH BEND, Ind. — Churning out
consistent yardage before 80,(XX) fans in
side college football's grandest arena. Stan
ford junior running back Toby Gerhart did
all that he could for the Cardinal on Satur
day. but it was not enough for Stanford (3-
3) to avoid a 28-21 defeat at the hands of a
resurgent Notre Dame squad.
Gerhart bruised his way to 104 yards on
13 carries. Together with teammate Antho
ny Kimble, who rushed 10 times for 61
yards, Gerhart led a Cardinal rushing attack
that dominated the Fighting Irish (4-1) on
the ground. That performance, however,
was not enough for Stanford to overcome
four turnovers, including three first-half in
terceptions by junior quarterback Tavita
Pritchard. and a career passing day from
Notre Dame quarterback Jimmy Clausen
in South Bend.
The true sophomore completed 29 of 40
passes for 347 yards and three touchdowns
— all career highs — for the Irish as he
carved up Stanford's struggling secondary
and led his team to a 28-7 fourth-quarter
lead.
Pritchard, who was sacked five times and
harassed all afternoon by the Notre Dame
defense, struggled for the first three quar
ters but was able to engineer a fourth-quar
ter comeback highlighted by a 10-yard
touchdown pass to sophomore Doug Bald
win with six minutes left to play. That score
closed the margin to 28-21, hut Stanford
was unable to pull any closer as its final

threat was extinguished when sophomore
receiver Ryan Whalen was stopped five
yards short on a fourth down, with just over
two minutes to play.
Pritchard finished 18-28 for 182 yards
and two touchdowns. His three first-half in
terceptions, however, neutralized Stan
ford's punishing running attack and opened
the door for Clausen to lead the Irish to a
21-7 lead at intermission.
"I let my team down in that regard,"

Pritchard said. "I've got to come out and
play better early on."
Notre Dame's solid pressure netted five
sacks for the Irish, including two by defen
sive end Pat Kuntz. who also intercepted a
pass and recovered a fumble bv Baldwin to
seal the victory as time expired.
"I saw some extra motivation from the
defense as far as pass rush was concerned
today," Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis
said. "We got big push inside from our de

fensive linemen to keep the pressure up all
day."
Clausen, meanwhile, was sharp through
out. TTie southern California-native thrived
behind good protection from Notre Dame's
vastly improved offensive line. Although
Stanford brought numerous blitz packages
to try to disrupt the Notre Dame quarter
back. Clausen was only sacked once on a

the gap to only one score, but the Cardinal was not able to complete the comeback, and lost to the Irish for the seventh consecutive time.
day that saw him connect with three
different receivers in the end zone.
"[Stanfordl was really dialing [the
blitzes] out there at the end, and I'm
proud of our guys," Weis said. "They
really stood tall."
In the first quarter,Clausen found
running back Armando Allen under
neath the Cardinal defense for a 21-
yard score as Notre Dame drew first
blood. After a methodical 14-play.
95-yard grind of a drive that saw 12
running plays and ended with a one
yard touchdown plunge by Gerhart,
Stanford knotted the score at 7-7
with 10:51 to play in the first half.
That's when Clausen got rolling.
A three-yard touchdown run by
Allen capped a nine-play, 73-yard
drive and gave the Irish a 14-7 lead
with 6:12 to go in the second quarter.
The Irish never looked back from
that point.
"(Notre Dame] hit their routes,"
Stanford head coach Jim Harbaugh
said. "They had a lot of big plays
downfield. I think they felt they
could do what they wanted to do
throwing the ball today."
After Notre Dame safety Kyle
McCarthy intercepted another
Pritchard pass, Clausen hooked up
with wideout Michael Floyd on a 48-
yard touchdown pass, 3:40 before
halftime.The Irish exploited Floyd's
matchup with senior defensive back
Wopamo Osaisai all day long, as the
freshman finished with five catches
for 115 yards.
"Clausen did a nice job," Har
baugh said of the Notre Dame signal
caller, who struggled mightily as a
freshman during Notre Dame's mis
erable 3-9 2007 campaign but has
now put up career highs for the sec
ond straight week. "He put the ball
up and let Floyd make a play."
Clausen connected with tight end
Kyle Rudolph over the middle for a
16-yard touchdown pass with 4:30
left in the third quarter to give Notre
Dame its biggest lead of the game at
28-7. With his massive 6-foot-6 height
and receiver's speed. Rudolph was a
nightmare for the Stanford defense
all afternoon. 7Tie freshman's five
catches for 70 yards effectively com
plemented Notre Dame's talented
wide-receiving corps, which hauled
in 16 passes on the day.
Stanford's resurgence started
with a one-yard touchdown catch bv

Jim Dray that capped a seven-play,
72-yard drive and cut Notre Dame's
lead to 28-14 with 10:06 to play. Dray,
who tore his anterior cruciate liga
ment in a devastating injury on Oct.
13 of last year, punctuated his re
markable comeback with the score
that set up Baldwin's touchdown just
over four minutes later.
Defensively, junior safety Bo Mc-
Nally led the Cardinal with nine
tackles, including one sack and an
other stop in the backfield.
