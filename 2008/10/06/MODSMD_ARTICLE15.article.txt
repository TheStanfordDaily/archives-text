## Postseason woes start with Scioscia 
### 
As a transplanted Angel fan at
Stanford, I don't have many
options for catching a game
on TV. Whenever I can. I track the
game pitch-by-pitch on my computer
from the first pitch to the final out.
When I'm home, I do my best to
catch a game live and soak in the
aura of the Big A until I head back up
to the center of baseball mediocrity
that is the Bay Area — though I'll
save that topic for another day. And
when baseball experts write off the
Angels for being in a weak division
or having no character. I stand up for
my hometown team again and again.
Though it's a bit odd to call a 100-
win team an underdog, that's what
the Angels have been the entire sea
son. and I've stuck by them for as
long as I can remember — postsea
son sweeps included. Just last night,
the Angels eluded yet another
Boston sweep in a five-hour
marathon,and I realized that enough
was enough.
The win was their first postseason
victory in three years. Some teams
haven't seen the postseason in near
ly three decades, but the Angels are
different. With a $120 million roster,
the Angels have the talent to go deep
in the postseason and are expected to
they had the best record in the
league for crying out loud. Yet. they
have seemingly floundered every
chance they get at redemption
against the Red Sox and are on the
verge of elimination once again.
No. the problem isn't the players,
nor a century-long curse. It goes
much deeper than that. The Angels
play the game the right way. empha
sizing pitching and timely hitting. So.
why the problems in the postseason?
I hate to sav it. but Mike Scioscia
