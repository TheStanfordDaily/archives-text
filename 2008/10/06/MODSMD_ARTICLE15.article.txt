## Postseason woes start with Scioscia 
### 
As a transplanted Angel fan at
Stanford, I don't have many
options for catching a game
on TV. Whenever I can. I track the
game pitch-by-pitch on my computer
from the first pitch to the final out.
When I'm home, I do my best to
catch a game live and soak in the
aura of the Big A until I head back up
to the center of baseball mediocrity
that is the Bay Area — though I'll
save that topic for another day. And
when baseball experts write off the
Angels for being in a weak division
or having no character. I stand up for
my hometown team again and again.
Though it's a bit odd to call a 100-
win team an underdog, that's what
the Angels have been the entire sea
son. and I've stuck by them for as
long as I can remember — postsea
son sweeps included. Just last night,
the Angels eluded yet another
Boston sweep in a five-hour
marathon,and I realized that enough
was enough.
The win was their first postseason
victory in three years. Some teams
haven't seen the postseason in near
ly three decades, but the Angels are
different. With a $120 million roster,
the Angels have the talent to go deep
in the postseason and are expected to
they had the best record in the
league for crying out loud. Yet. they
have seemingly floundered every
chance they get at redemption
against the Red Sox and are on the
verge of elimination once again.
No. the problem isn't the players,
nor a century-long curse. It goes
much deeper than that. The Angels
play the game the right way. empha
sizing pitching and timely hitting. So.
why the problems in the postseason?
I hate to sav it. but Mike Scioscia
and the coaching staff are clearly
among the problems at the root of
the Angels' postseason anguish.
Don't get me wrong, Scioscia is an
amazing manager — the cream of
the crop, even — but no one's per
fect. To start off, the players are
hacking at pitches and fouling off
perfect ones in their wheelhouse.
The Red Sox, meanwhile, pummel
every offering even close to the
zone. Jason Varitek may be an ane
mic hitter, but when finally pitched
inside last night, he smacked the ball
into left for a base hit. With the addi
tion of Teixeira. the Angels have
learned some patience, but it's noth
ing compared to the Red Sox's plate
discipline.
And while Scioscia has finely
crafted his organization into peren
nial contenders, some of his moves
have left me scratching my head.
Game one: Scioscia kept in Scot
Shields in for the ninth and bam —
two runs in for an insurmountable
three-run lead. The Red Sox have
feasted on Shields over the years —

why keep him in another inning?
Why not bring in the new single-sea
son saves record-holder? Because it
might hurt Shields's confidence?
And in games two and three, why
leave in Howie Kendrick. who has
struck out five times in nine at-bats?
Kendrick would later misplay an
Ellsbury routine fly ball for three
Red Sox runs in game three. Why
make him suffer like that?
And for the entire season, why
bench the power-hitting Mike
Napoli for the offensively chal
lenged Jeff Mathis? Sure, Mathis is
Ervin Santana's personal catcher,
but look at how much difference that
made in game two. Napoli would go
on to hit two huge bombs in game
three, perhaps single-handedly sav
ing the Angels from elimination.
I understand what Sci scia is
thinking: show faith in your players,
and they'll come through. But
enough is enough. On the flipside,
take Lou Piniella of the Cubs. Piniel
la certainly had no regrets in bench
ing a struggling Kosuke Fukudome
in game three of the NLDS — even
if it didn't save his club, it was still the
right move to make.
As for emotion, Scioscia has
drained it out of his players and you
can see it in their faces. The whole

year, they've played with a robotic
mentality of one game at a time. No
highs, no lows, no nothing. On the
other hand. Joe Torre has infused his
emotions into the Dodger club
house, almost crying after their game
one victory over the Cubs.
However, not all is lost for the
Angels.
Before game three, when asked
about elimination, Scioscia adamant
ly responded, "Well, first of all, we're
not getting eliminated tonight.so I'm
not going to answer that question."
When prodded again, Scioscia
firmly replied, "We're not getting
eliminated tonight, and we'll talk
about it at some point."
Finally, a little fire in Scioscia's
belly. Finally, some emotion out of
the stoic skipper.
And frankly, it doesn't surprise
me that the Angels held on for a 5-4
win a few hours later.
The tone of every squad begins
with its manager. From the outspo
ken Ozzie Guillen to Torre to Piniel
la. Scioscia knows what's at stake,and
1 sure hope he's willing to change for
the sake of his organization.

1 sure hope he's willing to change for
the sake of his organization.
