# Cardinal dominates Broncos for 10th win
## Lindsay Taylor's hat trick powers Stanford past Santa Clara 
### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
With its Pac-10 Conference schedule
looming just around the bend, the Stanford
women's soccer team continues to roll over its
opponents.
The No. 6 Cardinal pushed its record to 10-
0-1 as it demolished Santa Clara at the Bron
cos' Buck Shaw Stadium on Friday night, win
ning 5-0. And this was no cupcake that Stan
ford rolled over — it was only one week ago
on the very same field that Santa Clara fought
No. 2 UCLA to a 0-0 draw.
"We've been playing really well this sea
son. and being undefeated has definitely
helped our confidence," junior midfielder
Kristin Stannard said. "Santa Clara has al
ways been a huge rival of ours, and we didn't
want our undefeated streak to end last night."
The Broncos, however, started the match
like they were determined to give the Cardi
nal its first loss. In the first minute, Santa
Clara's Kiki Bosio launched a flip throw-in
into Stanford's penalty box and the ball
bounced to the Broncos' Courtney Lewis.The
Cardinal defense blocked Lewis' shot but
couldn't get in the way of a second attempt by
Lindsey Johnson. Luckily for them, sopho
more keeper Kira Maker was there to make
the save.
Maker was called into action again just two
minutes later, pushing a shot by Katherine
Reynolds out for a corner kick, in just three
minutes, Maker had made two more saves
than she had to make in the entire game
against St. Mary's last week.
Stanford's play remained sloppy for the
next few minutes, but gradually the Cardinal
midfield was getting the team back into the
game. Stannard began spreading the ball
around the field from her holding midfield
role, and freshmen Teresa Noyola and Cami
Levin started pushing forward when they got
possession, making the Cardinal finally begin
to look dangerous.The team's efforts paid off
in the 17th minute as sophomore Christen
Press crossed to Noyola on the right, who
waited on the ball before finding fellow fresh
man Lindsay Taylor running into the box.Tay
lor finished emphatically from close range to
put Stanford ahead.
ITie Cardinal kept up the pressure and

nearly added a second goal when junior Kel
ley O'Hara beat the Broncos' offsides trap on
a free kick, only to see her half-volley pushed
past the post by SCU keeper Meagan Mc-
C'ray. Stanford, though, would get its goal as
Taylor headed in Noyola's service from the
ensuing corner kick, giving the team a two
goal lead to take into the half.
"I"he first shot of the second half pushed
Stanford's advantage to three.Taylor released
O'Hara on the right, and the junior forward
took it to the endline before cutting it back for
Press, who placed the ball in the upper-left
corner of the goal.
The rout was on at this point, and it took
just four more minutes for the fourth goal to
arrive. O'Hara strode forward from midfield
and slid a through ball behind the defense to
Taylor. The freshman calmly slotted past the
keeper to earn her first career hat trick. The
goal also moved her past Press to the top of
the team's scoring charts with her ninth of the
year.
With the result beyond doubt. Stanford
coach Paul Ratcliffe subbed out most of his
starters, but the Cardinal was still pushing for
ward. Sophomore forward Morgan Redman
almost headed in a cross from junior fullback
Ali Riley,and junior forward Lea MacKinnon
forced a fine save after working a short corner
with Novola. Stannard also saw a long-range
effort tipped over the crossbar.
Finally, the fifth and final goal crossed the
line in the Xsth minute. Stannard passed to
senior Kate Mannino near the top of the box.
who then touched the ball out lo fellow senior
Kelley Birch on the right. Birch delivered a
beautiful cross into the box and Stannard.
who had continued her run. was there to
pounce for her third goal of the season.
It wasajust reward for the midfielder, who
pulled the strings in the midfield in her first
start of the season.
"It was a really exciting night for me,"
Stannard said. "I've been working really hard,
coming in off the bench and trying to make
the most of the time I had out on the field. I
feel like my hard work has finally been re
warded, and I just need to keep proving that I
deserve to be out there."
Ratcliffe — who also praised Stannard's
recent performances off the bench — said he
may continue to switch up the midfield de
pending on the team's opponent, but admit
ted that "recent form" is the biggest factor in
determining who starts.
But with the form that the entire team dis
played on Friday, he may have some tough de-
