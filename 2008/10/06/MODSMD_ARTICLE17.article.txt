# Even in defeat, Card shows grit
## 
### JACK SALISBURY DESK EDITOR 
Down 28-7 in the fourth quarter at Notre
Dame, it's safe to say that Stanford had trouble
getting things started on Saturday. The Fighting
Irish didn't dominate the game as much as the 21 -
point lead might have suggested, hut a slew of
mistakes by the Cardinal and opportunism on
the part of the Irish accounted for the sizeable
lead.
The Cardinal showed some fight on Saturday,
though, which can only be a good thing — even if
it was a little too late.
Despite throwing three interceptions over the
course of the game, quarterback Tavita Pritchard
seemed to come alive in the last 10 minutes, reg
istering a 72-yard touchdown drive with 13 min
utes left and then leading the Cardinal 36 yards
to pay-dirt after a big return by none other than
quickly emerging sophomore Doug Baldwin —
though he would later set the team back by field
ing the ball inside the Stanford five-yard line on
the next punt.
Stanford nearly gave the Fighting Irish a scare
to remember, with a chance to drive for a game
tying touchdown with three and a half minutes
on the clock. And while Baldwin's mental error
may have been the deciding factor on the drive.it
couldn't hide the effort and attitude the Cardinal
showed at the end of the game.
As Notre Dame defensive end Pat Kunt/ said,
a ruckus between the Irish and Cardinal seemed
to have been brewing throughout the game.
"I feel like I sent my message." Kuntz told the
Associated Press. "I just felt all the trash talking
that went on before the game fired us up. I felt
like somebody was trying to step into our house
and push us around. We weren't letting that hap
pen."
kuntz is right that Notre Dame didn't let
Stanford push them around. But at the same
time, it seemed pretty clear that, playing across
the country on national television, the Cardinal
certainly didn't get pushed around either.
You could see it in the way the team rallied to
at least give the Irish a scare in the fourth quar
ter. Or maybe it was when senior linebacker Pat
Maynor lifted Notre Dame quarterback Jimmy
Clausen off the ground, pulling him by the shoul
ders for a bit before leaving the scene of the play.
Adding even more fuel to the fire, the game
ended with a mini-skirmish of sorts
between the two teams.That's not to
defend bad sportsmanship or penal
ty-inducing plays, but hey, anything's
better than the rampant apathy we
saw just two years ago under Walt
Harris, right?
As a coach, it's obvious that Jim
Harbaugh couldn't have been
thrilled with what he saw at the end
of the game.
"My main objective was getting
our players off the field," he said
after the game.
In any case, though, it still said
something about this team. There
was a concerted difference in Stan
ford's demeanor last year after Har
baugh took the reins. This year? It
feels like things have only been
building from the starting point he
laid down in 2(X)7.
Saturday's game wasn't one to re
member by any means. But if there's
one positive thing to take away from
it. it's that — with Coach Harbaugh
progressively establishing his pro
gram on the Farm — the Cardinal
won't go down without a fight.
