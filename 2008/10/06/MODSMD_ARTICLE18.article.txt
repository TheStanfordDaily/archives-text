of her career. Already over 1,000 kills
in her career, she is now the seventh
Stanford player since 1986 to record
both 1.0(H) digs and 1,000 kills in her
career. Barboza joins the likes of
Kristin Richards '07, Kerri Walsh '00
and Logan Tom '03.

Stanford pushed its record to 13-2 and 4-0 in the Pac-10 with away wins over
No. 9 Washington and Washington State. All-Americans Cynthia Barboza,
Alix Klineman and Foluke Akinradewo led the Cardinal attack on the road trip.
ting percentage.
On Sunday, the volleyball wasn't
nearly as different as some thought it
would he. Washington was coming
off a Fridav-night loss to No. S Cali
fornia. and proved unable to re
bound against a tough Stanford de
fensive effort.
The Cardinal swept the Huskies
25-17. 25-15, 27-25 behind 10 kills
from Barboza and nine from Kline
man. Klineman hit .471. while Akin
radewo was very efficient, knocking
down seven kills at a .636 clip. Licht
man again was all over the court with
20 assists, five kills and six digs.
The Stanford defense held Wash
ington (11-3. 2-2) to a .101 hitting
percentage, the eighth time in the
last nine matches that the Cardinal's

opponent has hit under .200. The
Huskies were swept for the second
consecutive match, marking the first
time that has happened to them in
six years.
As good as the weekend was for
Stanford, it became a little sweeter
with a few other Pac-10 results that
shook things up in the conference.
Oregon State, whom Stanford beat
last weekend, scored a huge upset
over No. 4 USC on Friday night and
took No. 5 UCLA to five sets before
losing. No. 11 Oregon — whom the
Card dominated a week ago — won
both of their weekend matches over
the Trojans and the Bruins.
Stanford now sits atop the Pac-10
Conference standings with No. 8 Cal,
which also swept its way through
Washington this weekend. If any
thing, those results are a testament to
the strength of the conference and
perhaps give a little more weight to
Stanford's record so far.
But there is a lot of vollevball to

be played, beginning with this week
end's matches against the Arizona
schools. Stanford will have to keep
up its strong play for Arizona on Fri
day night and Arizona State on Sun
day afternoon.
