# Mass protests outside Palin event
## Governor Palin arrives in bay area for brunch 
### KAMIL DADA DEVIN BANERJEE 
BURLINGAME, Calif. â€” Hundreds of
Democrats and Republicans clashed yesterday
morning outside the Hyatt Regency hotel in
Burlingame, where GOP vice presidential pick
Sarah Palin attended a fundraising brunch
with Bay Area Republicans.
To prevent demonstrators from flooding
the street, local police set up metal barriers
along the sidewalk opposite the hotel, but this
did not prevent the hundreds of political
activists from becoming mobile and vocal.
Shelley Kessler. executive secretary treasury
of the San Mateo County central labor council,
arrived early at a parking lot across from the
hotel to prevent Palin supporters from parking
their cars there.
"Our purpose here is to inform the public
that there are many people who do not feel
that Sarah Palin is either experienced or
knowledgeable enough to be in leadership of
this nation." Kessler said. "We don't want the
Palin people coming in our [parking] lot."
Steve Preminger, chair of the Santa Clara
Country Democratic Party, said he wanted to
raise the public's awareness on a number of
issues related to the Alaska governor.
"We want to make sure that the news of the
day isn't that Sarah Palin came, made a great

impression and that people weren't concerned
about what she stands for," Preminger said.
When asked about last Thursday's vice
presidential debate, Preminger said he was
pleased with the result.
"I think most Americans came away from
there feeling that she is not vice presidential or
presidential material." he said.
While Republicans were slightly out
weighed by Democrats outside the Hyatt,
there was no shortage of Palin supporters.
Barbara Dougherty was one such supporter,
who said Californian Republicans wanted to
have their voice heard.
"[Palin] is welcome here, regardless of what
people think about California," she said.
"There are some conservatives here."
Dougherty also said she believed the recent
CBS and ABC interviews with Palin had been
edited to adversely affect the Alaska governor.
"I do believe they were clipped and put
together in a way that really was negative," she
said. "I believe that the media's in the tank for
Obama."
Greg Conlon. who is running for Congress
in California's 12th district, believed Palin out
performed expectations in last week's debate.
"I thought it was outstanding," he said of

While Palin intended to raise money for the Republicans, demonstrators saw the event as an opportunity to chastise the leaders
of each other's parties. Please see page 3 for more photographs.
