# Mass protests outside Palin event
## Governor Palin arrives in bay area for brunch 
### KAMIL DADA DEVIN BANERJEE 
BURLINGAME, Calif. — Hundreds of
Democrats and Republicans clashed yesterday
morning outside the Hyatt Regency hotel in
Burlingame, where GOP vice presidential pick
Sarah Palin attended a fundraising brunch
with Bay Area Republicans.
To prevent demonstrators from flooding
the street, local police set up metal barriers
along the sidewalk opposite the hotel, but this
did not prevent the hundreds of political
activists from becoming mobile and vocal.
Shelley Kessler. executive secretary treasury
of the San Mateo County central labor council,
arrived early at a parking lot across from the
hotel to prevent Palin supporters from parking
their cars there.
"Our purpose here is to inform the public
that there are many people who do not feel
that Sarah Palin is either experienced or
knowledgeable enough to be in leadership of
this nation." Kessler said. "We don't want the
Palin people coming in our [parking] lot."
Steve Preminger, chair of the Santa Clara
Country Democratic Party, said he wanted to
raise the public's awareness on a number of
issues related to the Alaska governor.
"We want to make sure that the news of the
day isn't that Sarah Palin came, made a great

impression and that people weren't concerned
about what she stands for," Preminger said.
When asked about last Thursday's vice
presidential debate, Preminger said he was
pleased with the result.
"I think most Americans came away from
there feeling that she is not vice presidential or
presidential material." he said.
While Republicans were slightly out
weighed by Democrats outside the Hyatt,
there was no shortage of Palin supporters.
Barbara Dougherty was one such supporter,
who said Californian Republicans wanted to
have their voice heard.
"[Palin] is welcome here, regardless of what
people think about California," she said.
"There are some conservatives here."
Dougherty also said she believed the recent
CBS and ABC interviews with Palin had been
edited to adversely affect the Alaska governor.
"I do believe they were clipped and put
together in a way that really was negative," she
said. "I believe that the media's in the tank for
Obama."
Greg Conlon. who is running for Congress
in California's 12th district, believed Palin out
performed expectations in last week's debate.
"I thought it was outstanding," he said of

While Palin intended to raise money for the Republicans, demonstrators saw the event as an opportunity to chastise the leaders

the governor's performance."! real
ly think she carried the day and
showed that she's got something
besides good looks."
George Johnson, a U.S. Navy
and Vietnam War veteran from
Redwood City, stood strong against
the Republican Party's choice of
candidates, and said he does not
believe McCain can be termed a
hero.
"I think John McCain is a loose
cannon." the veteran said. "I don't
trust him. I think he's incompetent."
"1 remember that on the fifth
time he took an airplane off a carri
er deck in Vietnam, he got shot
down," Johnson added. "A lot of
guys will fly 100 or 150 missions and
not get shot down. Just because
you're in the military, that doesn't
make you a hero."
Johnson also questioned
McCain's academic credentials,
noting that the Arizona senator fin
ished fifth from the bottom in his
class at the U.S. Naval Academy.
In order to reserve a seat at the
Sunday brunch, which was closed to
the press, members of the public
were asked to contribute a mini
mum of $1,000 for individual tick
ets. But to nab a seat at the head
table with Palin, attendees were
required to donate a minimum of
$50,000.
Also outside the hotel was a
group of elderly women known as
the Raging Grannies, singing to the
tune of the nursery rhyme Three
Blind Mice. Granny Gail
Sredanovic, who holds an MA from
Stanford in French, said the group
of elderly women protested to raise
public awareness and to educate
those who attend.
Carla Bagneschi from
Burlingame wielded a "Women
Against Palin" sign on the street
outside the Hyatt. She claimed
Palin does not represent the vast
majority of women and actually
undermines women's strength.
"I think the only reason she was
chosen was because she was a
woman," Bagneschi said. "I don't
think that qualifies somebody to be
vice president and possibly presi
dent. She just does not have the
knowledge or the wherewithal to
understand the global economy."

Bagneschi also said she dis
agreed with the governors policies
regarding a woman's right to
choose.
"Palin believes that if a girl is
raped by her father, then that girl
has to have the baby [if] she gets
pregnant," Bagneschi said. "I think
that is morally, ethically and dis
gustingly wrong."
On the other hand, Janet Lin, a
resident of Burlingame and
Chinese American, strongly stood
behind the vice presidential candi
date and her "character."
"I believe she will do what she
says she's going to do," Lin said.
"She's not the people who are
Washington-polluted."
Lin also believed her community
supported Palin for financial rea
sons.
"As Asians, fiscal management is
very important," Lin said. "We
don't live on the edge, we pay our
bills. For someone who can come
out and clean house — that's what
I'm voting for."
Brunch attendees were cheered
on by Republican supporters as
they made their way to the Hyatt
entrance. One such attendee was
Deborah Dennis, a realtor from Los
Gatos. who explained why she was
attending the event.
"We've always voted
Republican, but this election means
more to us than in the past, because
of the economy and the war,"
Dennis said. "[But] the state of
Washington really concerns us most
of all — politics as usual is not
acceptable anymore."
David Papazian, a Hyatt resi
dent, said he was unaware Palin
would be at the hotel and was sur
prised when he woke up in the
morning to protestors outside his
window.
"I asked at the reception if I was
allowed to go in to see Governor
Palin, but they told me that it was a
closed fundraising event," Papazian
said, visibly disappointed.
As Palin dined with Bay Area
supporters inside the hotel, the
back and forth between the left and
right did not cease.
"Hey, hey, ho, ho, Bush-McCain
has got to go," chanted the crowd of
Democratic supporters, to which
their right-wing counterparts
replied,"Hell no, we won't go."
