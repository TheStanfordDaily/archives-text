## Researchers find gene for sleep disorder Possible gene for narcolepsy with cataplexy discovered 
### KAIREN WONG 
Stanford researchers recently reported in
the Nature Genetics journal that they have
found a genetic variant that increases suscep
tibility to narcolepsy.
In conjunction with researchers in Japan,
Center of Narcolepsy Director Emmanuel
Mignot and two members of his lab. Ling Lin
and Juliette Faraco studied the relationship
between narcolepsy with cataplexy and the
genomes of Japanese narcoleptics and non
narcoleptics. The team discovered that a cer
tain mutation found between two genes was
more common in narcoleptics. They then
expanded the study to look at possible asso
ciations in people of other descent —
Korean. European and African American.
Korean populations showed a genome
wide significant association, but the study was
inconclusive for the other two descents, as the
genetic variant's frequency was much lower.
Narcolepsy is a neurological condition
that is characterized by excessive daytime
sleepiness, while cataplexy consists of sudden
episodes of muscle weakness. Narcolepsy
with cataplexy, which is a common sleeping
disorder diagnosed by sleeping centers, is
found in one out of every 2,(M)() people. Many
go undiagnosed because they attribute their
sleepiness to other problems.
According to the Center for Narcolepsy
Web site, in many cases, "diagnosis is not
made until many years after the onset of
symptoms. This is often due to the fact that
patients consult a physician after many years
of excessive sleepiness, assuming that sleepi
ness is not indicative of a disease."
There is currently no cure for narcolepsy
with cataplexy. Instead, treatment involves
one of two FDA-approved antidepressants
and behavioral strategies, such as taking
short naps throughout the day when patients
are most likely to be sleepy.
The study's results add to an already com-
plicated list of questions to be
answered about narcolepsy.
"The problem with narcolepsy
|with cataplexy] is that it appears to
be caused by the death of a specific
cell group in the hypothalamus that
makes hypocretin," Faraco said. "90
percent of them are dead or silent by
the time narcolepsy is diagnosed.
Once gone, how do you replace
those cells?"
Seiji Nishino, director of the
Sleep and Orcadian Neurobiology
Laboratory, also questioned what
other genes could be involved.
"The major problem of human
narcolepsy [with cataplexy] is
recently revealed to be a loss of
hypothalamic hypocretin neurons,"

Nishino said. "However, the cause of
the hypocretin cell death is
unknown, and both genetic and
environmental factors are involved.
Genetic involvement in narcolepsy
is. however, not simple, and multiple
genes are likely involved."
Though the discovery of this
mutation between the two genes
does not directly contribute to clini
cal methods and treatments of nar
colepsy. it may develop new perspec
tives on narcolepsy with cataplexy.
"What you do when you get a
positive result is find novel genes
which are complete surprises,"
Faraco said. "It's not likely to lead to
clinical results yet. but it opens new
areas of research that will. There's a
lot of hot competition regarding the
narcolepsy genome-wide search
right now."
