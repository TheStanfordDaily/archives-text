A young mother standing in the audience took a
moment to collect herself, choking hack tears as she
recounted the hardships her daughter had faced due
to the substandard quality of today's language
immersion programs.
"She internalized that she was stupid." the moth
er said in tears. "She internalized it to the point where
she was throwing up in the classroom every day."
The emotionally charged atmosphere in the
Tresidder Oak Lounge last Friday emphasized the
gravity of the racial equity issues being discussed at
"Education and Opportunity: A forum on the Kerner
Commission Forty Year Report," the first public
forum co-sponsored by the newly established
Stanford Center for Opportunity Policy in Education
(SCOPE).
Structured into panels geared toward promoting
open dialogue, the inaugural forum hosted some of
the nation's leading education and civil rights

Eisenhower Foundation, co-sponsor of Friday's
forum, indicates that circumstances in today's society
are better, but not by nearly enough. Issues regarding
biased standardized testing and disparate funding in
school districts still abound.
Panelist and co-director of the Warren Institute
on Race, Ethnicity and Diversity Prof. Goodwin Liu
said advances have been made in terms of racial
inequality, but there is still room for more improve
ment.
"We have made progress on racial inequality since
1%8, and it is important that we account for that
progress," Liu said, "if for no other reason than the
clarity it provides as to where we have not."
Still, the general tone that permeated the day-long
forum was one of burgeoning hope and optimism.
