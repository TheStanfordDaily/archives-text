## Univ. hosts forum on education Speakers look at Kerner Commission Forty Year Report 
### THOMAS YEH 
A young mother standing in the audience took a
moment to collect herself, choking hack tears as she
recounted the hardships her daughter had faced due
to the substandard quality of today's language
immersion programs.
"She internalized that she was stupid." the moth
er said in tears. "She internalized it to the point where
she was throwing up in the classroom every day."
The emotionally charged atmosphere in the
Tresidder Oak Lounge last Friday emphasized the
gravity of the racial equity issues being discussed at
"Education and Opportunity: A forum on the Kerner
Commission Forty Year Report," the first public
forum co-sponsored by the newly established
Stanford Center for Opportunity Policy in Education
(SCOPE).
Structured into panels geared toward promoting
open dialogue, the inaugural forum hosted some of
the nation's leading education and civil rights
experts, all of whom spoke extensively on the myriad
factors plaguing the country's education system/ITie
forum's purpose was twofold: to serve as a discussion
on racial disparities in education and to commemo
rate the 40th anniversary of the Kerner Report that

first raised these issues.
"What we have are breathtaking opportunities
disguised as insoluble problems." said President John
Hennessy in his opening remarks, quoting John
Gardner, former Secretary of Health, Education and
Welfare under Lyndon Johnson.
Convened by President Lyndon B. Johnson in
response to the race riots of the l%os, the Kerner
Commission issued its report in 1%8 detailing the
grave existence in our nation of "two societies, one
white, one black, separate and unequal."
An updated report commissioned by the
Eisenhower Foundation, co-sponsor of Friday's
forum, indicates that circumstances in today's society
are better, but not by nearly enough. Issues regarding
biased standardized testing and disparate funding in
school districts still abound.
Panelist and co-director of the Warren Institute
on Race, Ethnicity and Diversity Prof. Goodwin Liu
said advances have been made in terms of racial
inequality, but there is still room for more improve
ment.
"We have made progress on racial inequality since
1%8, and it is important that we account for that
progress," Liu said, "if for no other reason than the
clarity it provides as to where we have not."
Still, the general tone that permeated the day-long
forum was one of burgeoning hope and optimism.
Amid the discussions about restructuring educa-

tion arose a consensus that widening
gaps between races in educational
standards and opportunities are due
to a lack of renewed will, coupled
with the illusion of greater progress
caused by policies like the No Child
Left Behind Act. SCOPE co-direc
tor and Education Prof. Linda
Darling-Hammond delivered the
keynote of the day, emphasizing the
need to alter our mindsets in order
to address the gap in opportunity
that is tied to racial inequality.
"1 would suggest that what's
really needed in order to leave no
child behind is a new theory of
action," Darling-Hammond said.
"We need to look toward a theory
of action that recognizes our inter
dependence, helping people to
understand that we are all in this
together — that discourse has to be
changed."
The attendees themselves ran
the gamut, ranging from students,
concerned parents and teachers to
legislative staff, school board mem
bers and representatives of varying
advocacy groups.
"We wanted to get people who
can take this knowledge and really
make a difference where it mat
ters." said Barbara McKenna, pub

lic relations officer for the School of
Education and program coordina
tor for the event. "We can research
things forever, but if it doesn't get
in the hands of the people who are
making decisions, it doesn't do any
good."
Dale Russell, director of the
Santa Clara County Office of
Education, agreed.
"I'm looking for the kinds of rec
ommendations that we can build
directly into the conversations that
we have with local school districts,"
he said. "How do you close the
racial achievement gap? How do
you create more educational equity
between all kinds of students?"
Friday's forum came at an
opportune time. In light of the
upcoming election, many partici
pants were eager to talk about the
realistic steps they hope to see
taken in the new administration,
especially as education is pushed to
the back burner in the face of the
economic crisis at hand.
The process will take time, as well
as marked efforts to reassess atti
tudes and policy-making priorities.
Ouoting Langston Hughes's
"Freedom's Plow" in her address,
Darling-Hammond offered some
inspiring words:
"Keep your hand on the plow!
Hold on!"
