# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## Housing installs HiddenBeds for Lag Mini-double receives a collapsable desk 
### KAMIL DADA DESK EDITOR 
Think your dorm room is
small? According to Stanford
Magazine, Vice Provost John
Bravman '79 cringes at the
thought of the size of "mini-dou
ble" rooms when he drives
around with the president and
stops at Lagunita on move-in
day.
Until Bravman's "Housing
Master Plan," which aims to pro
vide an increased quality of living
for Stanford students, is com
plete, Residential Education
(ResEd) has attempted to
increase the space for undergrad
uates in a number of ways. At the
start of this academic year, hous
ing ran a trial experiment of
using "Hiddenßeds" in one of
the mini-doubles in Ujamaa. The
Hiddenßed design is essentially a
desk that converts into a bed
when required.
Brittany Bennett '12, one of
the students living in the one
room mini-double, explained
how the Hiddenßed design
increased space in the room.
"We do not need to clean up
our desks in order to lower the
bed. which is a plus," Bennett
said. "Items up to 15 inches high,
such as a desk lamp, can remain
on the desk, and we also have a
lot of desk space."
Imogen Hinds, regional hous
ing manager for Student
Housing, said ResEd chose one
of the smaller rooms on campus
to try out the furniture, since it
wanted to see whether the beds
would meet the needs of students
living in the rooms.
"In Student Housing we fre
quently try out new types of fur
niture and finishes as styles, as

[students'] needs change." Hinds
said. "The Hiddenßed design
that we are currently trying out
was seen at a national housing
association conference, and was
felt to be a style of furniture that
offered a large desk space, flexi
bility and efficiency."
Jan Barker, associate dean of
students and dean for the black
community services center, said
she supported the move to have
an experimental room.
"Housing approached me
about using one of our rooms as
a pilot to test whether this prod
uct was efficient in saving space,"
she said. "I supported their
efforts to explore options of cre
ating a more comfortable space

The Hiddenßed, installed in a lone
Ujamaa freshman double as a
pilot project, allows a bed and
desk to occupy the same space.
The desk has a mechanism for the
bed to pull down on top of it.
