# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## Housing installs HiddenBeds for Lag Mini-double receives a collapsable desk 
### KAMIL DADA DESK EDITOR 
Think your dorm room is
small? According to Stanford
Magazine, Vice Provost John
Bravman '79 cringes at the
thought of the size of "mini-dou
ble" rooms when he drives
around with the president and
stops at Lagunita on move-in
day.
Until Bravman's "Housing
Master Plan," which aims to pro
vide an increased quality of living
for Stanford students, is com
plete, Residential Education
(ResEd) has attempted to
increase the space for undergrad
uates in a number of ways. At the
start of this academic year, hous
ing ran a trial experiment of
using "Hiddenßeds" in one of
the mini-doubles in Ujamaa. The
Hiddenßed design is essentially a
desk that converts into a bed
when required.
Brittany Bennett '12, one of
the students living in the one
room mini-double, explained
how the Hiddenßed design
increased space in the room.
"We do not need to clean up
our desks in order to lower the
bed. which is a plus," Bennett
said. "Items up to 15 inches high,
such as a desk lamp, can remain
on the desk, and we also have a
lot of desk space."
Imogen Hinds, regional hous
ing manager for Student
Housing, said ResEd chose one
of the smaller rooms on campus
to try out the furniture, since it
wanted to see whether the beds
would meet the needs of students
living in the rooms.
"In Student Housing we fre
quently try out new types of fur
niture and finishes as styles, as

[students'] needs change." Hinds
said. "The Hiddenßed design
that we are currently trying out
was seen at a national housing
association conference, and was
felt to be a style of furniture that
offered a large desk space, flexi
bility and efficiency."
Jan Barker, associate dean of
students and dean for the black
community services center, said
she supported the move to have
an experimental room.
"Housing approached me
about using one of our rooms as
a pilot to test whether this prod
uct was efficient in saving space,"
she said. "I supported their
efforts to explore options of cre
ating a more comfortable space

for students."
Bennett, however, had mixed
feelings about the model furniture.
"The biggest problem is that
when both of our desks are up.
then we can't offer guests a place
to sit in our room," the Ujamaa
resident said, "112 riends can't sit on
our beds when we are working at
our desks. I don't know how to
alleviate that."
Bennett added that a lot of stu
dents visit her room as they pass by
to catch a glimpse of the furniture.
"A lot of freshmen seem to
think that it saves space and that it
would be helpful," she said.
"However, a lot of upperclassmen
seem to think that it is more hassle
than it is worth. I can't say as I
haven't had the chance to live in
another room yet."
Bennett added that she has the
inconvenience of tucking in the
blankets before folding the bed
away, although she does not neces
sarily have to completely make her
bed every day.
Hinds said that when the stu
dents who were assigned to the
dorm moved in. ResEd had staff
on hand to help explain the func
tionality of the furniture and to
help the residents with questions
or concerns.
"We let the students know that
we were very interested in hearing
from them to find out what they
liked and what recommendations
they might have for the furniture
design," she said. "Toward the end
of the quarter, we will be soliciting
some more formal feedback from
them."
According to Hinds, the furni
ture will remain in the room all
year and possibly longer, if it fits
the needs of residents. It will be
removed if it is determined not to
be effective.
"Residential Education told me
that, if at any time throughout the
year we hated our furniture, we
could ask to have it changed back
to a regular bed and desks,"
Bennett said. "They just want us to
be comfortable."
