## Obama "pals around with terrorists" V.P. candidate says Palin defends terrorist comment 
### JIM KUHNHENN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Sarah Palin defended her claim
that Barack Obama "pals around
with terrorists," saying the Democra
tic presidential nominees associa
tion with a l%os radical is an issue
that is "fair to talk about."
Obama has denounced the radi
cal views and actions of Bill Avers, a
founder of the violent Weather Un
derground group during the Viet
nam era. On Sunday, Obama dis
missed the criticism from the Mc-
Cain campaign, leveled by Palin, as
"smears" meant to distract voters
from real problems such as the trou
bled economy.
Palin, the Republican vice presi
dential candidate, launched the at
tack Saturday and repeated it Sun
day, signaling a new strategy by John
McCain's presidential campaign to
go after Obama's character.
"The comments are about an as
sociation that has been known but
hasn't been talked about," Palin said
as she boarded her plane in Long
Beach, Calif. "1 think it's fair to talk
about where Barack Obama kicked
off his political career, in the guy's
living room."
Later, at a fundraiser, Palin elabo
rated on her attack, claiming one of
Obama's advisers had described
Obama and Ayers as "friendly."
"In fact, Obama held one of his
first meetings hoping to kick off his
political career in Bill Ayers' living
room," she told the crowd, which had
just raised $2.5 million for the Re
publican party's McCain-Palin Vic
tory 2008 fund.
At issue is Obama's association
with Ayers. Both have served on the
same Chicago charity and live near
each other in Chicago. Ayers also
held a meet-the-candidate event at
his home for Obama when Obama
first ran for office in the mid-19905,
the event cited by Palin.
In February. Obama strategist
David Axelrod told the Politico Web
site: "Bill Ayers lives in his neighbor
hood. Their kids attend the same

school. They're certainly friendly,
they know each other, as anyone
whose kids go to school together."
But while Ayers and Obama are
acquainted, the charge that they "pal
around" is a stretch of any reading of
the public record. And it's simply
wrong to suggest that they were asso
ciated while Ayers was committing
terrorist acts. Obama was 8 years old
at the time the Weather Under
ground claimed credit for numerous
bombings and was blamed for a pipe
bomb that killed a San Francisco po
liceman.
At a rally in North Carolina,
Obama countered that McCain and
his campaign "are gambling that he

can distract you with smears rather
than talk to you about substance."
The Democrat described the criti
cism as "Swiftboat-style attacks on
me." a reference to the unsubstanti
ated allegations about 2004 Democ
ratic nominee John Kerry's decorat
ed military record in Vietnam.
During her stop in California.
Palin was asked about an Associated
Press analysis that said her charge
about Ayers was unsubstantiated, a
point made by other news organiza
tions, and the criticism carried a
"racially tinged subtext that McCain
may come to regret."
"The Associated Press is wrong."
Palin said, before arguing that the

issue had not been adequately dis
cussed.
In fact, Obama was questioned
about Ayers during a prime-time De
mocratic debate against Sen. Hillary
Rodham Clinton prior to April's
Pennsylvania primary.
Palin, recharged after last week's de
bate against Democratic vice presi
dential nominee Joe Biden, is ani
mating the party's conservative wing
with harsh attacks against Obama.
She's courting high-dollar donors for
campaign cash. And she is looking to
wrestle away women and independ
ent voters from the Democrats.
"The heels are on, the gloves are
off," she declares, a threat delivered
with a smile.
With that message, the campaign
is sending her on a whirlwind tour of
political trouble spots.
On Sunday, she was headed for a
rally in Omaha, Neb., a defensive
move in one of the two states in the
nation that can split their electoral
votes. Her visit illustrated the depth
of worry within the McCain camp.
Since 1964, all five of the state's elec
toral votes have gone to the Republi
can presidential candidate.
On Monday, she begins a two-day,
event-packed tour of Florida that
stretches from Naples in the South to
Pensacola in the panhandle. North
Carolina and Pennsylvania are next.
After a hold-your-ground debate
performance last week, Palin is back
to where she was after her show
stopping speech at the Republican
convention a month ago — the top
draw in the McCain-Palin ticket.
About 10.000 people came to her
rally Saturday in the Los Angeles
suburb of Carson. She raised $2 mil
lion in one California fundraiser for
the McCain-Palin Victory 2008 fund.
She's getting the star treatment from
the likes of Grammy winner Vikki
Carr and actor Robert Duvall.
