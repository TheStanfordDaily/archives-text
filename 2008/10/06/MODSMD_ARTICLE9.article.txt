## Editorial HiddenBed the wrong way to address housing crunch 
### 
With the first buildings in the new
Munger Graduate Residences com
plex nearing completion, the edito
rial board applauds the University for its at
tempts to alleviate the housing crunch and
move both graduate students and undergrads
into more spacious, functional and up-to-date
accommodations. Despite this progress, how
ever. many undergraduates across campus
are still living in small one-room doubles or
triples and are still very much feeling the
"crunch."
The variability in student housing quality,
especially for freshmen, has long been an
issue that the University has tried to address
seriously. But the latest measure to salvage
cramped living conditions in the infamously
small Lagunita Court "mini-doubles" (a term
used bv the University to describe the former
singles in Ujamaa, Naranja and West Lag)
seems to fall short of that standard. Instead,
the new Hiddenßed installations, described
by the manufacturer as "a revolutionary bed
and desk system," are a stop-gap solution for
a problem with no easy fixes.
The Hiddenßed device — two of which
are currently installed in a lone Ujamaa fresh
man double as a pilot project — allows a bed
and desk to occupy the same functional
space. A student simply pulls downward on
the desk and the hidden bed folds out from
against the wall, while the desk swings under
the bed. onto the floor and out of sight.
There is no question that this device saves
room, but it also presents challenges that ren
der it unacceptable as a real resolution to the
cramped housing situation in Lag. The Hid
denßed Web site disclaims that "a maximum
of 45 lbs. is recommended on the desktop,"
making it useless for holding heavy storage
boxes and likely unable to bear someone's
weight — leaning on the desk without think
ing could cause it to break or engage the bed
swinging mechanism.
The Hiddenßed Web site makes the point
that, with Hiddenßed, "no space is wasted"
because the bed "is not useful during the day"

and is stowed away during that time. But any
college student living in cramped conditions
is likely to disagree with that statement — the
fact that residents cannot use the bed and ac
cess the desk simultaneously is a serious dis
advantage of the system. Though many stu
dents use their beds as seating, students using
their Hiddenßed desks are unable to offer
visitors any place to sit down.
The set-up also limits the residents' op
tions in terms of moving desks, bunking beds
or other customizations that other freshmen
are able to make when they move in. Indeed,
bunking provides many of the same benefits
as Hiddenßed without the added inconven
iences or cost. And though the same could be
said of bunk beds, the swinging-bed contrap
tion might present difficulty — even danger
— for students returning late at night, partic
ularly after partying.
Though a few students may prefer the
Hiddenßeds in cramped quarters, no Stan
ford student should be forced to combine his
or her desk into a Hiddenßed system — or
even bunk his or her bed — simply because
of inadequate room space. Freshmen at many
of our peer institutions do not face problems
with cramped "mini-doubles" and do not
have to resort to innovative, if inconvenient,
bed and desk systems to free up living space
in their dorms.
Fortunately, the administration officials
involved seem to be welcoming of sugges
tions; Regional Housing Manager Imogen
Hinds told The Daily that Student Housing is
soliciting feedback on the beds and will re
place them with regular beds and desks if the
residents want. The editorial board takes this
opportunity to provide its verdict: The Uni
versity should focus its financial resources on
construction instead of spending thousands
of dollars on expanding a short-term solution
with limited tangible benefits. Rather than
expand this initiative, the University should
fold up the Hiddenßed forever and roll out a
new plan that uncrowds the small rooms in
Lag and elsewhere.
