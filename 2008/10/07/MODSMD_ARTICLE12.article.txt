# Executive Experiences
## OMG I is so matur. Poke! 
### 
I spent my freshman year of college at
Northwestern University breaking stuff.
Technically I was a film major, but two
camera lenses, a tripod and a light kit later,
my soft-spoken Canadian T.A. politely de
clared that I was "technologically inept in a
big way."
So, as one does, I became a theatre major,
where my inability to mime being trapped in
an elevator shaft eventually forced me to
question whether or not I should invest in a
viable college education.
When I transferred to Stanford, I ran into
the warm embrace of the comparative litera
ture department, where clicking a picture of
a printer on my now-defunct ißook is the
closest I've had to get to technology.
Of course, I naively assumed that by ig
noring the practical side of technology, I
could lead a social life independent of my
computer. But this being 2(X)8, no one is com
pletely safe. I, my friends, have unwittingly
been maligned and degraded by my own
Facebook settings — in a big way.
There's been a lot of hoopla about old vs.
new Facebook these days.The fact that most
of the new applications and features are to
tally lost on me is actually the least of my
problems. If you don't send me a virtual zom
bie or an egg that hatches into a Furbie, I
promise not to cry myself to sleep tonight.
What does get my goat, though, are those
apps that have wormed their way into my
Facebook persona without my consent.
The other day, I got an email from Face
book announcing that two different people
had written in my Honesty Box. This was a
nice surprise, considering that I: a) did not
know I had an I lonesty Box to begin with
and b) had very little idea of what an Honesty
Box was. Something like a chastity ring,
maybe?
I logged on to my account only to discov
er that my virtual self had automatically

posed a question to all of my virtual compa
triots: "What do you honestly think of me?"
For shame, application fiends, for shame!
Have some pity on those of us who cannot
defend ourselves!
You know darn well that there are two di
rections in which a question like that can go
when the responses are guaranteed to be
anonymous: "Gurl ur fine in spandex" or "U
dumb b*#&s im gonna fight u tonite."
In my situation, the comments tended to
wards the latter, only because I haven't worn
much spandex lately. I'm sure.
The first entry was whimsically cryptic:"U
were really rude and I wondered whether it
was because of pressure." Pressure. Not peer
pressure, not air pressure, not David Bowie
and-Freddy Mercury-collaborate-in-the-mu
sical-opus-that-is-"Under Pressure." Just
pressure.
Isn't the point of an Honesty Box that it
gives opportunity to flesh out interpersonal
grievances in excruciating detail? Further
more, anonymous scribe, tell me how it is that
you took the time to report the injury I ap
parently committed against you, yet you
could not type the two other letters, "y" and
"o," to form a complete three-letter word
that I have already written 3.66 times in this
sentence alone?
This bold declaration was followed by a
second entry that read simply: "Aloof."
At this point, I began to wonder if perhaps
these writers had been directing their hon

esty towards the wrong box. Usually, when
people have a complaint about me, it's that
they wish I were more aloof. Hut I guess
that's the whole point of the exercise.
Facebook has since told me that for 10
points (of what?), I can find out the respec
tive authors of these statements, but I have
no desire to do so. After all, if you took the
time to find my Honesty Box and write non
descriptive sentence fragments on it at 3:10
a.m. on a Sunday,you're obviously a lot lamer
than I am. Plus, isn't that antithetical to the
whole point of an Honesty Box?
As a society, we've long gotten over the
fantasy that technology will make us more ef
ficient. Instead, we're now happy to revel in
the reality that it panders to our basest in
stincts. Those instincts being, in this case, a
seventh-grader-esque desire for approval
and/or an equally juvenile desire to write
punctuation-devoid insults.
And Honesty Box isn't the only culprit. It
is not a coincidence that "Juicy" now repre
sents both matching human and dog terry
cloth sweaters and a cyberforum for anony
mously slamming people.
Along the continuum of "I got screwed by
Facebook" stories, mine is pretty innocuous.
I'm sure you could name five more severe ex
amples off the top of your head. But in a way,
that's not the point. I certainly don't pretend
to be better than my perpetrators; as long as
Facebook exists, we're going to use it to judge
each other.
Nonetheless, my technological incompe
tence should by no means force me to get
signed up for Clandestine Bitchfest 2008.
Read my lame profile if you must, but then,
for goodness sake, just smirk and move on.

If you want to have a bitchfest with Jenna about
the unfairness of Facebook apps that sign you
up themselves, email her at
