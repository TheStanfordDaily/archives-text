## Huskies bite Stanford Stanford opens Pac-10 play with mixed results 
### WILL DOOLEY 
Stanford men's soccer managed
to end the slump that has character
ized its season with a hard-fought
double overtime draw with Oregon
State on Sunday afternoon. The
game, the second of a pair of confer
ence road matches played by the
Cardinal over the weekend, snapped
a four-game losing streak that includ
ed Friday's conference opener, a 1-0
loss to Washington.
Sunday's positive result for the
Cardinal (2-5-2. 0-1-1) marked the
end of Stanford's longest losing
streak since 2005, a streak made par
ticularly painful by the nature of
Stanford's losses. All those losses
came by just one goal given up in the
second half. It was the Cardinal's
longest series of one-goal losses since
1988.
However. Stanford finally man
aged to buck the trend with a strong
finish in Sunday's 1-1 tie with Ore
gon State (3-5-3,0-1-I).The Cardinal
came from behind to tie the game on
sophomore Bobby Warshaw's penal
ty kick in the 34th minute, and junior
John Moore made an incredible save
in overtime to prevent what would
have been another heartbreaking
loss. Despite almost scoring on a
scramble late in OT. the team
seemed content to walk away with
any sort of positive result.
"I never thought I'd be happy
with a 1-1 tie," Stanford head coach
Bret Simon told GoStanford.com

following the game. "I thought both
teams fought very hard, which is es
pecially difficult after a game on Fri
day. So, to play with that effort and
heart, especially with the bad things
that have happened, was encourag
ing."
Oregon State took the lead when
Danny Mwanga's 18-yard shot found
the back of the net in the 20th
minute.The goal was offset just a few
minutes later when sophomore Ryan
Thomas drew a foul in the penalty
box. Warshaw made the effort count,
finally converting on his second
penalty try of the season. It was his
third goal of the year, a team high.
The "bad things" Coach Simon al
luded to were prominently on dis
play Friday night as the Cardinal's
determination to turn around the
season was not enough to counter a
fine effort from Washington (6-3, 1-
0). Maybe the persistent rain was a
sign that Stanford's outlook wasn't
bright that night, as the team once
again suffered a close defeat on a
last-second goal.
The problem, as it has been all
season for the team, was goal pro
duction. Stanford managed to con
vert just once during its four-game
cold-spell, and has managed to score

two goals in a game only once this
year, a solid 2-0 performance against
Cornell early in the season.
Despite running through extra
shooting and finishing drills in the
week leading up to the road trip,
Stanford failed to capitalize on its
opportunities, coming up empty on
two promising second-half scrums in
front of the Washington net.
"We're just having trouble scor
ing goals," Simon accurately summed
up to GoStanford.com. "We're show
ing confidence in our play; we're
playing hard and we're creating good
chances. We're almost unlucky to not
get an unlucky goal."
But Simon and his coaching staff
prefer not to focus on had luck and
results, trying to avoid the mental
negativity that can spell doom for a
team in the defining moments of a
game. Instead he prefers to empha
size the work ethic of his players.
"The players are really fighting
hard for each other," he said on
GoStaford.com. "And that's all you
can ask for. You fight together and let
the chips fall where they may."
The chips fell in favor of Washing
ton's Casey McCool, who scored his
first collegiate goal in the 77th
minute with a 12-yard shot that
found the top corner. Washington
looked dangerous throughout, get
ting a bad break on a Brent Richards
header that hit the crossbar.
In the first half. Stanford dodged
another bullet, getting a penalty shot
call reversed. Center referee Alex
Gorin initially pointed to the penalty
spot, but later brought the ball just
outside the box after it became clear
that the linesman was in a better po
sition to see the spot of the foul.
Die weekend road trip ended on

somewhat of a high note and may
have signaled a turning point in the
season for men's soccer. The Cardi
nal went into the weekend knowing
that it would take a gutsy perform
ance and a pair of tough victories to
keep its hopes of making the NCAA
Tournament alive, and unfortunately
they failed to deliver. With fading
dreams of a post-season berth, the
team's focus will most likelv shift to

wards a breakout performance next
year.
Stanford continues Pac-10 play
this weekend, hosting San Diego
State and UCLA. Both games will
have early starts, beginning at 4:30
p.m. on Friday and 2:30 p.m. on Sun
day.

chances. We're almost unlucky to not
get an unlucky goal."
But Simon and his coaching staff
prefer not to focus on had luck and
results, trying to avoid the mental
negativity that can spell doom for a
team in the defining moments of a
game. Instead he prefers to empha
size the work ethic of his players.
"The players are really fighting
hard for each other," he said on
GoStaford.com. "And that's all you
can ask for. You fight together and let
the chips fall where they may."
The chips fell in favor of Washing
ton's Casey McCool, who scored his
first collegiate goal in the 77th
minute with a 12-yard shot that
found the top corner. Washington
looked dangerous throughout, get
ting a bad break on a Brent Richards
header that hit the crossbar.
In the first half. Stanford dodged
another bullet, getting a penalty shot
call reversed. Center referee Alex
Gorin initially pointed to the penalty
spot, but later brought the ball just
outside the box after it became clear
that the linesman was in a better po
sition to see the spot of the foul.
Die weekend road trip ended on

somewhat of a high note and may
have signaled a turning point in the
season for men's soccer. The Cardi
nal went into the weekend knowing
that it would take a gutsy perform
ance and a pair of tough victories to
keep its hopes of making the NCAA
Tournament alive, and unfortunately
they failed to deliver. With fading
dreams of a post-season berth, the
team's focus will most likelv shift to

wards a breakout performance next
year.
Stanford continues Pac-10 play
this weekend, hosting San Diego
State and UCLA. Both games will
have early starts, beginning at 4:30
p.m. on Friday and 2:30 p.m. on Sun
day.

Junior goalkeeper John Moore and the rest of the Stanford defense played well
this weekend, allowing just one goal a piece against Washington and OSU.
The Cardinal offense was stymied and it finished the weekend 0-1 -1.
