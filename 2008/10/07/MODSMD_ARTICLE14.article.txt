# Stanford polo routs Pacific in MPSF play
## 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO KENAN JIANG 
The No. 3 Stanford men's water
polo team is now 10-1 on the season as
it continues to improve in the early part
of the year. The Cardinal trounced No.
11 Pacific on Sunday, winning by a
score of 10-2, thanks to a shutdown per
formance on defense. Pacific is now 8-7
on the year and faces an uphill battle
within the ultra-competitive Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF).
The Stanford men have been equal
ly dominant on offense this season,
scoring 10 or more goals in every game
except their lone loss to No. 1 USC on
Sept. 21. But the Cardinal has piled up
ridiculous stats against lesser oppo
nents, and has only played three games
within theMPSF.The Stanford men are
now 2-1 in those games, including a
triple-overtime win against California
and the loss to USC.The MPSF boasts
the five top teams in the nation with
USC, UCLA, Stanford, Pepperdine
and UC-Berkeley filling out the rank
ings.
The Cardinal returned to action
after two weeks of heavy training, and
the team reaped the benefits of their
hard work against Pacific. Junior Drac
Wigo had a season-high six goals, while
redshirt junior and captain Jimrnie
Sandman stopped nine shot attempts
to lead the Cardinal to victory. Sand
man did not allow a single goal in the
closing period, even as the Cardinal

was running awav with the contest. Se
nior Chris Jacobson, sophomore Jef
frey Schwimer, freshman Peter Sefton
and junior Sage Wright each added
goals.
Wright enjoyed a breakout season
last year, and was selected as a first
team All American. He was twice
named MPSF Player of the Week and
led the team with 33 goals scored.
Stanford started off Sunday's game
with five goals in the opening eight
minutes. Pacific tried to respond but
could only come up with one score in
the first period. Stanford's suffocating
defense allowed the offense to be more
aggressive as the first half continued,
and the Cardinal was ahead 8-1 at half
time. While Pacific came out with a goal
in the third period, Stanford continued
to clamp down on defense and finished
the match with confidence.
"Pacific didn't really have an an
swer for our defense," Schwimer said.
"Our solid defense allowed us to create
many counter-attack opportunities,
which was definitely a strong point in
our game today."
Stanford has one of the most potent
offenses in the country this season, al
though in recent years the team has
been known more for its defensive
prowess. Stanford currently leads all
nine MPSF schools with 12.7 goals per
game, and has scored an amazing 18
goals in two contests so far. ITie team
has won its games by an average mar
gin of more than nine goals.

Head coach John Vargas, now in his
seventh year, has always preached a de
fense-first mindset. He has led Stanford
to a 132-40 record over his tenure, and
29 of Vargas's players have been cho
sen as All-Americans. Three Stanford
water polo alums represented the USA
in the 2(X)K Beijing Olympics, including
Tony Azevedo '05, Peter Hudnut '03,
and Peter Varellas '06, which mayserve
as a further indicator of the kind of tal
ent Vargas has attracted to and fostered
at Stanford.
"Our team has been focusing more
and more on the defensive side of the

game." Wright said. "We want to com
pletely shut down the other team and
then counter their offensive attack to
flow into our own attack. I think that is
what we did today â€” it's never perfect,
but we did very well."
"Plus, Drac Wigo scored six goals,"
he added."That never hurts."
Drac overtook his twin brother Jan
son to become Stanford's top goal scor
er with 26 on the season. Janson has
scored 25 times, and the brothers have
combined for more than a third of the
