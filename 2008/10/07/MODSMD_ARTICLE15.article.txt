## Card comes close, loses twice out East 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's field hockey
team faced Northeastern this Saturday
without one of its most dominating of
fensive threats, sophomore Camille
Gandhi.The short-handed Cardinal fell
to the I luskies by a score of 3-2, despite
goals from junior Jen Luther and junior
Midori Uehara. Luther's goal was her
first of the season and Uehara scored in
the second half to keep the game close,
but it was not enough to secure a win.
Stanford was out-shot 13-8, attempting
only four shots in each period.
Gandhi was absent from the team
after being selected to represent the
United Slates at the Pan American Ju
nior Championships in Mexico City
from Oct. 6-12. Eight nations will field
teams in the prestigious tournament,
offering players like Gandhi a chance
to play with and against some of the
best field hockey talents from around
the world.
Although a London native, Gandhi
has dual citizenship in the United
States. She first displayed an interest in
field hockey during a P.E. session at age
10. A natural athlete, she soon excelled
in the sport.
By the time she was in high school.
Gandhi had captained the silver medal
winning under-16 team at the Euro
pean Championships. Her aspirations
include a trip to London — not to visit
her family, but to play in the 2012
Olympic Games. She admits that it
would be strange to represent the U.S.

in the country where her family has its
roots.
Gandhi had an incredibly success
ful season as a freshman and was hon
ored as the Northern Pacific Athletic
Conference R<x>kie of the Year, in ad
dition to being named First Team All-
NorPac. She started all 21 games last
year and ranked fourth on the squad
with six goals and five assists.
The national team coaching staff
was impressed with Gandhi's ability to
distribute the ball on defense, keep
possession in tight situations, and pass
the ball wisely. Her biggest challenge
was her quiet nature on the field, but
she quickly learned to be more vocal
and communicative during games. By
interacting constantly with her team
mates, Gandhi has figured out how to
help bring out the best in her team
mates.
"It's not enough to be the best play
er you can be," she told
GoStanford.com. "You have to bring

out the best in the players around you.
Otherwise, what's the point?"
After the loss on Saturday, the Car
dinal looked to bounce back against
Holy Cross on Monday. But the Cardi
nal fell 2-1 in overtime, leaving them
winless on the weekend.
Both teams got on the board early,
Stanford's goal coming from a fine ef
fort by sophomore Xanthe Travlos in
the 15th minute. The Cardinal women
dominated in the second half, especial
ly on defense. Holy Cross was unable
to muster a single shot, while Stanford
shot eight times but could not score.
But the game went to overtime, and
Holy Cross' Kristin Schulz sealed the
deal with her second goal of the match.
Stanford has gone to overtime on four
occasions this season and has lost all
four, contributing to a record of 3-9 on
the season.
