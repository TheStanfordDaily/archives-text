# Pac-10 power, where did you go?
## 
### 
Last season, the Pac-10 was near
the top of the football world.
The SEC continued its reign as the
top conference in the country, hut the
Pac-10 was a clear second. It was
strong from top to bottom. Stanford
was arguably the worst of the 10
teams, and even the 4-K Cardinal had
some impressive performances.
The Pac-10 sent six teams to bowl
games. The Associated Press ranked
USC as high as No. 1. and Cal surged
as high as No. 2 in the same poll. At
one point, Oregon and Arizona
State placed at No. 2 and No. 6 in the
BCS, respectively; and by the year's
end, Oregon State had moved into
the top 25.
It was the continuation of a nice
200 ft. when eight of the 10 teams had
records of .500 or better and six squads
were rewarded with bowl appear
ances. The Pac-10. better known for its
basketball prowess, was beginning to
establish itself as one of the elite BCS
football conferences.
And then the 2008 season began.
Now.the Pac-10 has five teams with
losing records. Washington is the only
BCS conference team that is still win
less. Washington State's lone victory
came over Portland State, a team that
competes in the Football Champi
onship Subdivision (formerly known
as Division l-AA). Arizona State
began the year ranked No. 15. and it
now sits at 2-3.'llie biggest out-of-con
ference win was a USC victory over
then-No. 5 Ohio State that was quick
ly forgotten when the Trojans lost to a
mediocre Oregon State team the fol
lowing week. And. to top it all off, the
Pac-10 is 1-6 against the Mountain
West Conference (MWC). which is a
non-BCS league.
The SEC. ACC, Big 10 and Big 12
are all clearly better than the Pac-10
this year, and the MWC has a case as
well. Look at it this way: Stanford has
improved thisyear.but at 3-3,it is in no
way a powerhouse and hasn't yet
made much of an impact on the na
tional stage. But the Cardinal's 2-1
conference record puts it in a tie for
third in the Pac-10 standings. At this
point last year. No. *•) Oregon and No.
10 USC were tied for third in the same
rankings.
So what happened to the Pac-10?
For starters, many teams lost a sig
nificant number of important person
nel. Take Washington State, for in
stance:The Cougars lost Alex Brink, a
three-year starter at quarterback who
left the school as its all-time leader in
touchdowns and passing yards. One of
his major targets. Michael Bumpus,
graduated as well.Thev also lost their


Wyndatn

Between the lines
defensive leader, safety Husain Ab
dullah, who started for three years and
was named to the All-Pac-10 team as
a senior.
Cal lost three of its leading re
ceivers (Lavelle Hawkins, DeSean
Jackson and Robert Jordan). Ore
gon's starting quarterback Dennis
Dixon, a Heisman candidate early in
the season, and its running back
Jonathan Stewart — a first-round
pick — both moved on. Ten players
from USC were drafted.
Certainly, the changeover in play
ers has hurt the conference. There
have also been a number of unfortu
nate injuries, particularly at quarter
back. The Ducks lost their starter,
Nate Costa, for the season, and Justin
Roper has been sidelined with an in
jured knee. Jeremiah Masoli, the
third stringer, has been forced to
carry the load.
But that's not as bad as the

Cougars, who lost their top two QBs
to injuries and, after watching Mar
shall Lohbestael play poorly against
Oregon and UCLA, have begun try
ing out any student who wants a
crack at quarterback.
Still, every conference experi
ences personnel turnover and in
juries. Some teams, like Washington,
are just unlucky.The Huskies had an
incredibly difficult opening sched
ule; were victims of a horrific call
that all but gave an early season
game to B YU; and lost their starting
08. Jake Locker, for at least a
month due to a thumb injury. Other
squads, like UCLA, are simply re
building. The resident powerhouse,
USC, was caught napping in Corval
lis; and Cal, another top team, did
not manage its travel schedule well
and was visibly lagging against
Maryland in College Park.
Whatever the reasons, the Pac-10
is now in a desperate fight to save its
reputation this year. The silver lining
for Stanford fans is that it gives the
Cardinal, one of the teams that is
clearly on an upswing, a better
chance at success this season. But if

the conference as a whole is disre
garded as weak nationwide, who's
going to notice?
