## Senator Boxer tours Y2E2, speaks to students Boxer applauds student research, sustainable design in Y2E2 
### JULIA BROWNELL 
The students waiting in the Blue Atrium of the
Jerry Yang and Akiko Yama/aki Environment
and Engineering (Y2E2) Building yesterday
afternoon were not waiting for class to start.
Instead, they were waiting for the arrival of
Senator Barbara Boxer (I) ( alii ).
Boxer came to Y2I 2 for a question-and
answer session with students and faculty, followed
by a brief tour of the building. What struck her
first and foremost was its design.
"It's beautiful." raved Boxer when she first
arrived at Y2E2. "This is spectacular."
Boxer is the chairman of the Energy and
Public Works (I.PW) Committee in the Senate,
which handles issues related to climate change,
deals with legislation on sustainability and over

sees the Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA).
"This is the committee that will start dealing
with climate-change solutions," said James
Sweeney, director of the Precourt Institute tor
Energy Efficiency (PIEE), in his introduction of
the senator.
Once Boxer began the question-and-answer
session, she quickly turned her attention to the
economy.
"This is a house of cards," Boxer said, referring
to the nation's current financial instability.
She remained optimistic, however, about the
power of the new green economy.
"There's a connection between the economic
crisis, getting out of it and fighting global warm
ing." Boxer said. "There's an answer right here [in
Y2E2]. and in all of you who are here."
The California senator focused on the innova
tion in green industries that she believes can help
turn the economy around.
"My friends in Silicon Valley say that they are
readv to invest more in this green economy than

they were in their communications economy,"
Boxer said in reference to the late-'9os explosion
of technology companies.
Ilie senator expressed hope that the construc
tion of more green buildings like Y2E2 could help
create jobs in the U.S. Job loss, always a hot polit
ical issue, has recently been highlighted by the
media and politicians facing the national econom
ic crisis.
"You can't have someone in India or China
put a solar panel on the roof of a house in Palo
Alto." Boxer said. "Unless they have very long
arms, it has to be done by Americans."
On issues of global warming, Boxer continued
voicing her strong opinions, stressing that "we
need to make science a priority."
Once out from behind the podium. Boxer took
a walking tour of Y2E2, during which she heard a
brief presentation on polychlorinated biphenyls
from l.illi Janssen. graduate student in Civil and
Environmental Engineering. Boxer also heard
