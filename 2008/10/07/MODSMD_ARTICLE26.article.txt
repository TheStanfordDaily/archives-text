# Future Faculty Seminar
## 
### 
Future Faculty Seminar is a new, weekly seminar for all Stanford University
students who are considering academic career options. It is a cross-discipline
effort designed to provide all graduate students, trainees and post docs at
Stanford with the tools they need to prepare for, and be successful in, their
individual careers. Content will range from general academic job search
preparation information to academic job training.
Tuesday class content encompasses general topics relevant to all fields of
study, such as: job application overviews, public speaking instruction, and
teaching strategies for new professors.
Thursday classes are split into 3 different field-specific groups: Engineering,
Life Sciences, and Humanities/Social Sciences/Education. Content within
these areas includes: giving job/chalk talks, copyright/IP issues, grant writing/
publishing, and navigating the tenure process.
Speakers include:
Donald Kennedy
Phil Pizzo
Richard Reiss
Terry Root
Jody Puglisi
Registration for this class is done in the same manner as registration for any
class at Stanford University. Grading will be on a C/NC basis. Attendees do
not have to register for the class to attend. For more information, visit the class
