## MULTIPLE POLAR BEARS DISCOVERED SWIMMING MANY MILES FROM ALASKA COAST

WWF Press Release
ANCHORAGE, Alaska, August 21, 2008 - An aerial sur
vey by government scientists in Alaska's Chukchi Sea this
week found at least nine polar bears swimming in open
water - with one at least 60 miles from shore - raising
concern among wildlife experts about their survival. A
World Wildlife Fund (WWF) polar bear expert said the
bears could have difficulty making it safely to shore and
risk drowning, particularly if a storm arises.
"To find so many polar bears at sea at one time is
extremely worrisome because it could be an indication that
as the sea ice on which they live and hunt continues to
melt, many more bears may be out there facing similar
risk," said Geoff York, a polar bear biologist with WWF.
"As climate change continues to dramatically disrupt the
Arctic, polar bears and their cubs are being forced to
swim longer distances to find food and habitat."
the companies scheduled to be at the fair include Aera
Energy LLC, Chevron Energy Solutions, Cogent Energy,
Inc., Ecos Consulting, Genencor International Inc., HDR

Inc., Itron Inc., OptiSolar, Rumsey Engineers, Sun Edison,
Trinity Consultants, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,
Ultra Cell Corporation, and more.
Scientists say the Arctic is changing more rapidly and
acutely than anywhere on the planet, noting that 2007
witnessed the lowest sea ice coverage in recorded history.
Satellite images indicate that ice was absent in most of the
region where the bears were found on August 16, 2008
and some experts predict this year's sea ice loss could
meet or exceed the record set last year.
The discovery of the nine bears at sea came as the U.S.
Minerals Management Service was conducting marine sur
veys in the Beaufort and Chukchi Seas in advance of
potential offshore oil development.
WWF polar bear experts on the ground in Alaska are
assessing the situation and will provide updates to the
media as more details unfold.
In May, the U.S. Department of Interior listed polar bears
as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. Interior

Secretary Dirk Kempthorne cited the strong body of sci
ence pointing to the significant loss of Arctic sea ice habi
tat as the primary reason for protecting the bear with fed
eral legislation. The State of Alaska has opposed the list
ing and has sued the federal government over its decision
to list the bear.
Professor Richard Steiner of the University of Alaska's
Marine Advisory Program said, "While these bears are
swimming around in an ice-free coastal Arctic Ocean, the
only thing the State of Alaska is doing is suing the federal
government trying to overturn the listing of polar bears.
The bottom line here is that polar bears need sea ice, sea
ice is decaying, and the bears are in very serious trouble.
For any people who are still non-believers in global warm
ing and the impacts it is having in the Arctic, this should
answer their doubts once and for all." â–
