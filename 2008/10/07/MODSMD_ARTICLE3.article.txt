# Admit offices check Facebook
## Stanford Admissions does not routinely search 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
Bv now. most students are aware
of the potential impact that their
Facebook or MySpace profiles can
have on their job searches. The fact
that select employers have begun to
screen the social networking sites of
potential employees is no secret.
However, a recent study conducted
by educational company Kaplan
appears to indicate that this industry
trend is making its move into acade
mia.
The study indicates that 10 percent
of admission officers surveyed at S(X)
of the top colleges around the nation
looked at social-networking sites to
evaluate applicants. Thirty-eight per
cent of respondents said their views
were "negatively affected" by what
they saw in the applicants' social net
working Web sites, and only about 25
percent reported that their evaluation
of a potential applicant improved
after visiting the applicant's social
networking site.The 320 colleges that
responded remain anonymous,
although Kaplan did state that it sur
veyed the schools with the most selec
tive admission processes.
Stanford Director of Admission
Shawn Abbott wrote in an email to
I"he Daily that Stanford does not do
routine searches of all applicants'
social networking sites as a matter of
procedure in the evaluation and
selection process. In addition, he said
the University has no formal policies
about approaching the personal Web
sites of applicants.
"In general, for the most part
(admitted students excluded) we're
reluctant to utilize networking sites
like Facebook for our recruitment
and outreach purposes." Abbott
wrote, "as we do believe that such
sites are somewhat personal and for
social networking purposes â€” and

not necessarily the most appropriate
vehicle for us to be promoting
Stanford's academic enterprise."
This does not mean, however, that
students applying to Stanford should
throw all discretion to the wind in
terms of managing their social net
working sites.
"I can't think of any particular
case where we have denied admission
to an applicant based on what we
viewed on a social networking site."
Abbott said. "Though it's not out of
the question. Obviously, any time we
learn of inappropriate behavior
(especially if it involves illegal activi
ty). we're reluctant to offer admis
sion. so of course we will investigate
accordingly."
Underage drinking, for example, is
an illegal activity that might merit
special attention if it is seen in a
Facebook profile picture.
Kaplan's survey indicated that
upper-level schools were likely to
screen with social networking sites as
well. Admission officers at nine per
cent of business schools. 15 percent of
law schools and 14 percent of medical
schools surveyed admitted to viewing
the online profiles of applicants.
Despite the relatively high rate of
visits to Facebook and MySpace
among law schools. Stanford Law
School said it did not weigh an appli
cant's social networking site in admis
sion evaluations. Upon The Daily's
request for an interview regarding the
use of social networking sites in
admissions, the Law School respond
ed with the following statement:
"The law school does not take into
account applicants' information
found on social networking sites
when determining their qualifications
for admission. In selecting students
for the J D program, two criteria dom
inate the decision-making process:
