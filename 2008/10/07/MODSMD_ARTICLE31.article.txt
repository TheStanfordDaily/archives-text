## FIRMS SURVIVE BY RECOGNIZING FUNDAMENTAL INDUSTRY CHANGES

STANFORD GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS—
Enduring companies survive because employees through
out the firm, not just those in the executive suite, learn to
keep an eye on how related industries are evolving.
Longevity comes not just from matching the competition
but also from recognizing fundamental changes in how the
game is played and moving strategically to stay ahead.
"The main capability you really have to deal with these
dynamics is the strategy-making process," said Robert A.
Burgelman, the Edmund W. Littlefield Professor of
Management at the Stanford Graduate School of
Business, who coauthored with Andrew S. Grove, Stanford
lecturer, a recent study in the Strategic Management
Journal. "If the entrepreneurial activity has to be driven
from the top, then the middle and senior executives are
not doing their jobs."
Business competition is generally highly dynamic but plays
out in a linear fashion, says Burgelman. For instance, in
some industries companies compete by giving rebates.
Once a rebate is offered, rival firms quickly match it—but
"the fundamental equilibrium remains."
Grove and Burgelman focus on nonlinear strategic
dynamics that change the normative, economic, techno
logical, and/or cognitive "rules" that govern how an indus
try functions. In the rebate example, a firm may come up
with a novel manufacturing strategy that offers high quality
at lower costs, while the rest of the industry continues to
compete by giving higher and higher rebates, a tactic that
weakens their capacity to match the new strategy. These
firms fall farther and farther behind, and eventually will be
ground down, said Burgelman. "The player with the new
strategy is going to get stronger and stronger."
Middle managers and senior executives need two crucial
sets of skills —conceptual and political—to help their com
panies handle nonlinear dynamics, Burgelman said. They
must recognize the strategic changes in their industry,
develop proposals to overcome the competition, and edu
cate upper management about why the changes are cru
cial. That requires middle managers and senior executives
to get support of at least some of their peers to be reason
ably sure of having enough support to see the strategic
change through.
The authors use their framework of nonlinear strategic
dynamics to examine 37 years at Intel, where Grove
served as president, chairman, and chief executive officer,
and today is senior advisor to executive management. It
focuses primarily on four events:
An industry shift turned dynamic random access memory
(DRAM) products, Intel's core business during the 19705,
into a commodity, making large-scale precision manu
facturing competence the key to winning. Intel lacked

that competence.
In four successive generations of product, Intel tried to use
its competencies in integrated circuit design and process
technology to innovate products and compete against the
Japanese. The efforts increasingly failed, and Intel fell far
ther and farther behind—a nonlinear strategic dynamic. In
late 1984 Intel top management decided to exit the DRAM
business.
By this time frontline leaders at Intel had developed the first
microprocessor, which found application in several high
margin market niches, while the DRAM had become a
low-margin product. Although top management remained
unclear for some time about which strategic direction to
pursue, microprocessors won out in the intemcl Intel com
petition for scarce manufacturing resources. In the early
1980s IBM's personal computers —a major application for
microprocessors—rapidly grew into prominence during
and Intel top management became ready to shift its core
business from DRAMs into PC microprocessors.
Top management's decision to make this shift was facilitat
ed by another nonlinear strategic dynamic that played to
Intel's (and Microsoft's) advantage. While IBM had not
insisted on exclusivity when adopting Intel's microprocessor
for the PC, it had insisted on Intel cross-licensing its tech
nology to other suppliers. This required Intel to essentially
give away its microprocessor designs to competitors.
Because of the broad access to the Intel microprocessors,
independent software vendors increasingly wrote their
applications based on the Intel architecture, increasing its
value. PC users wanted to continue to use their old soft
ware on their new machines, fueling a virtuous circle for
backward and forward compatibility. As Intel (and
Microsoft) ultimately controlled compatibility, the company
was able to radically change the game by insisting that it
become the sole source provider of Intel microprocessors.
Intel's market share and profitability grew dramatically.
Strategic change does not always have such a positive
effect on an industry. In the late 1980s the workstation
market settled on using machines based on reduced
instruction set computing (RISC) architecture that looked
like it might migrate into the PC market segment. Even
some within Intel were convinced that the RISC would
eventually wipe out the complex instruction set computing
system (CISC) that Intel used for its microprocessors.
Through an autonomous strategic initiative of one young
engineering manager, Intel also developed a RISC micro
processor. However, it became clear that new architecture
would not be able to deliver on a 1 OX advantage over
Intel's CISC architecture. Intel's leadership eventually
decided that unless Intel itself pushed the new RISC it didn't
represent a paradigm shift after all and went back to what
Grove called "vectoring everybody at Intel" behind the
CISC architecture.
"Many times, these initiatives will not pan out," Burgelman

said, but it was still crucial for Intel to develop a RISC processor. If Intel
had ignored it and RISC had won, Intel would have been at a huge com
petitive disadvantage.
Geographic diversity sometimes encourages autonomous strategic initia
tives that may have nonlinear strategic effects. An Intel team in Israel
designed and developed a new microprocessor—called Banias at the
time —that demanded less energy and had easier-to-use wireless capabili
ty rather than emphasizing ever more "speed"—lntel's typical performance
focus. The Banias processor became a core building block of an innova
tive "mobility platform" called Centrino, now used in most laptop comput
ers to allow users to be almost continuously connected to the Internet.
Through Centrino, Intel was again able to set in motion a nonlinear
strategic dynamic that gave it stronger and stronger market share and
profitability in the fast-growing mobility market segment.
Having the team in Israel placed it far away from the faster-faster-faster
mantra of Silicon Valley. "If the idea of trading off clock speed for die area
had come up at headquarters," Burgelman said, "it probably would have
been killed right away."
Another element crucial to maintain a company's capacity to cope with
and/or capitalize on potential nonlinear strategic change is often cold,
hard cash. The authors point out that in spite of sharply declining revenue
and profit during the technology slump of the early 2000s, Intel's board of
directors let top management keep enough cash reserves for one year of
research and development and one generation of capital investments.
That offered enough resources to fully pursue existing opportunities
through heavy capital and technology investments, and a time buffer to
decide on strategic direction.
