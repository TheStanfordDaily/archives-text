## Careers in Biotechnology 
### Laura Dominguez Chan Career Development Center 
Biotechnology includes the areas of Discovery Research,
Preclinical Research, Project Management, Clinical
Development, Medical Affairs, Regulatory Affairs, Quality,
Operations, Bio/Pharmaceutical Product Development, Life
Science Information Management, Business and Corporate
Development, Marketing, Sales, Technical Applications and
Support, Corporate Communications, Law, Health Care
Finance, Management Consulting, and Recruiting. If you are
interested in finding out more about these Biotech career
opportunities, a new book entitled, "Career Opportunities in
Biotechnology and Drug Development" by Toby Freedman is
a must read. Toby met with more than 200 biotechnology
and pharmaceutical executives and learned about their
career paths and fields. The wide variety of careers in
biotechnology and drug development listed above are pre
sented along with insights into to the pros and cons of the
job. For another vantage point to the field of biotechnology,
you may find Yali Friedman's book, "Building Biotechnology"
helpful in understanding how biotechnology companies work
from legal and regulatory issues to business and science
aspects. Both of these books are available to review in the
CDC Resource Library.
If you are looking for current up-to-date input on what's
going on in the field of Biotech, Fierceßiotech.com is an
excellent resource which you can subscribe to and receive
daily updates on the current happenings within the field. In
fact, Fiercebiotech also lists other specialty areas like
FiercePharma, Fierceßioßesearcher, Fierce Vaccines, and
FiercePharma. You will find information like events, whitepa
pers, webinars, research, and special reports on Biotech and
other related fields. These resources can be found at
www.fiercebiotech.com and can provide a valuable inbox
email that will keep you in touch with the latest and greatest
happenings in the field of Biotech.
Talking with alumni who work in the field of Biotech is the
best way for you to find out about the field and also establish
your professional network. An invaluable resource that you
will hear about again and again (because networking works!)
is the Stanford Career Network that is found at
http://www.stanfordalumni.org/career/home.html. This is a
database of alumni, who have volunteered to conduct infor
mational interviews with students and other alumni. They are
willing to discuss a variety of subjects including job search
strategies, industry/company information, career options and
other related areas.

Other resources listed below may be of help to you in your
understanding/research of the field, search for a full-time job
or search for a summer internship within the field of Biotech.
Also, keep in mind that temporary firms like On Assignment
and Kelly Scientific often have temporary roles to fill and
would allow the job seeker to gain insight and experience into
the field of biotech as well as make contacts within the field.
