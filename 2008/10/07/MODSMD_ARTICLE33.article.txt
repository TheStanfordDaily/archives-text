## BANDING TOGETHER Minds of All Kinds Join to Hasten Discoveries of New Medical Treatments

A large federal grant recognizing the medical school's
potential to translate laboratory discoveries into
advances in health care has placed Stanford among
a core group of academic medical centers funded to
crack this surprisingly hard problem.
The grant is a Clinical and Translational Science Award of
$30 million over five years. The award, announced in May
by the National Institutes of Health, links Stanford to the
CTSA consortium of 38 academic health centers working to
speed medical progress, each according to its own strategy.
Stanford's approach will focus on interdisciplinary connec
tions between the medical school, the rest of the campus
and innovators from businesses in Silicon Valley. The crux
of the effort will be the Stanford Center for Clinical and
Translational Education and Research, an independent
institute that will operate outside traditional school bound
aries.

Includes information on bioscience careers including phar
maceuticals, biotech, government, public service, and pri
vate sector careers.
"Translating discoveries is more than the School of
Medicine," says the program's leader, Harry Greenberg,
MD, the medical school's senior associate dean for
research. "You need lawyers, psychologists, anthropolo
gists, economists, environmental scientists — all of these
to figure how best to move scientific discoveries into
improvements in human health and well-being. What's
unique about Stanford is we can harness the best in those
areas."
The NIH launched the award program in 2006 with 12
centers, adding 12 more the following year and 14 this
year. Ultimately it aims to fund approximately 60 centers
with an annual budget of $500 million.
Most of the grantees so far are traditional academic health
centers, with allied health schools such as public health,
nursing, pharmacy and dentistry.
"Stanford has none of these," says Greenberg. "What we
have are highly integrated experts working outside of tradi-

tional medicine."
The NIH established the grant program in 2006 to solve a
problem that seems inexplicable to many outside of the
medical profession: Despite an explosion in discoveries
about human biology, only a small fraction of these insights
lead to advances in health care. Part of the problem is that
medical school programs tend to be very specialized, with
faculty and students focusing either on understanding the
basic functions of
Opportunities in Biological Science Careers by Kathleen
Belikoff organisms, or treating patients. There's little incen
tive to launch risky, time-consuming projects that bridge
these two worlds.
'The NIH is trying to take the nation's largely unorganized
way of conducting clinical research and bring innovative
strategies together in one program, with more centralized
direction and management," says Greenberg.
As a result of the grant, the new Stanford center, known as
SCCTER (pronounced "skeeter"), will roll out new pro
grams and services designed to break researchers out of
their siloed communities. The center will be based in a new
building, the Jill and John Freidenrich Center for
Translational Research, to be located just a few minutes'
walk from the medical school — and from Stanford
Hospital and Lucile Packard Children's Hospital — at 800
Welch Road in Palo Alto. The building is slated for comple
tion by the end of 2011 and is funded by a gift from the
Freidenrichs.
The grant will allow Stanford researchers to make great
advances for health care, says the medical school's dean,
Philip Pizzo, MD. "Stanford's spectrum of medical, social,
engineering, business and related disciplines should propel
the CTSA to new vistas that are simply not possible at other
medical centers, medical schools or universities," he says. ■
