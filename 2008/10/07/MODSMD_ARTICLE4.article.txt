## Stanford on top of sexual health Trojan ranks Stanford as national leader in sexual health resources 
### LIZ STARK 
Trojan brand condoms recently named Stanford as
the most sexually healthy school in the nation, rank
ing it first out of 139 colleges in sexual health
resources.
In the third annual Trojan Sexual Health Report
Card. Stanford earned ;i 3.50 GPA, based on results
compiled by independent researcher Best Places. out
pacing No. 2 Columbia and No. 3 Cornell.
Rankings were determined by data from 13 cate
gories, including cost and accessibility of contraceptives,
availability of HIV/AIDS tests and presence of out
reach. Hie addition of a student online poll and the con
sideration of student anecdotes shook up this year's
rankings; last year's first-place school. University of
Minnesota, placed 23rd while Stanford ricocheted from
41st in last year's report to the top spot.
"I think [the rankings change] was related not so
much to our improvements so much as to the fact
that the survey changed" said Jillian Campbell, pub
lieitv manager for the Sexual Health Peer Resource
Center (SHPRC). According to Campbell, Trojan
increased the number ol schools surveyed by 50 per
cent this year.
Though a part ol Vaden Health Center's Health
Protective Services (HPS), SHPRC is entirely stu
dent-run and financed through the ASSIJ. SHPRC's
office on the second floor of Vaden — provides
students with 12 free condoms per quarter and two
dollars-worth of free supplies (such as lubricant,
vibrators and the recently added pregnancy tests) per
month. Additional amounts of these supplies are also
for sale at the center, with no item exceeding $10.
SHPRC employs student counselors, who are
available to answer questions during open office

hours and lead outreach programs about sexual
health in residences.
HIV Peer Anonymous Counseling and Testing
(PACT) also offers a student-run health resource on
campus.
"We've changed our approach to getting the pro
gram out there [with the addition of counseling].'
said Amanda Romero, one of PACT'S peer coun
selors. "Initially, it was just an HIV testing service,
which we didn't feel people at Stanford had a great
need for. Most of the people who come to PACT for
testing are having sex outside the Stanford commu
nity."
While many other schools, such as UC-Berkeley.
IJSC and Harvard, offer unlimited free condoms.
Stanford is unique in its free STD testing available
at Vaden.
Sexual health resources are also offered in-resi
dence by Peer Health Educators (PHEs) across
campus.
"By making a walk to the SHPRC to get con
doms— not something you hide out of fear or
shame — PHEs are not only reminding students to
have safe sex but also making the act of taking
responsibility fun and accessible." said Elizabeth

"By organizing events such as a workshop on sexu

to the center of residential life."
Despite receiving the top grade in sexual health
services, the need to publicize Stanford's sexual
health resources remains.
"In a population that has a high percentage of
turnover every year, there is always more work to be
done," said Donnovan Yisrael '89, M.A. '90, manager
of Relationship and Sexual Health Programs for
HPS.

Storch said. "People don't want to
talk about sexual health. They don't
seem to think it's important."
Andee Nos PHE for
Murray, said she believes an
expansion in the PHE program

would help reach out to those too
embarrassed or too lazy to go to
the SHPRC.
"I think it would be awesome if
every dorm did have a PHE," Nos
said. "Just because there aren't
freshmen in a dorm doesn't mean
there's not need for a PHE."
Do said additional PHEs would
also be useful in West Flo, where
she serves as the sole PHE.
"1 think in big dorm complexes
such as West Flo, where you're try
ing to look out for residents across

four dorms, having a PHE partner
would be very beneficial," she said.
Romero said she would also like
to see Stanford's sexual health
groups work together to promote
awareness on campus.
"People are confused about
where they should go to at what
times," she said. "We could work
together more to know who we're
targeting."
