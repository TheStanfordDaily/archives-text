# STUDENT GROUPS
## Online satire site debuts at Stanford The 						Flipside, modeled after The Onion, also planned for print 
### JENNY REMPEL 
A new, weekly humor newsletter. The Flipside
— which aims to poke fun at University officials,
campus life and world affairs held its inaugural
meeting on Sunday.
Headlines in the first issue ranged from
"Freshman Student Struggles To Find TBA
Building" to "Stanford Accepts More Morons To
Increase Diversity." Written under pseudonyms,
these stories model the tongue-in-cheek style of
the widely popular online and print publication,
Fhe Onion.
According to founder Jeremy keeshin '12. The
Flipside's goal is to create a two-page print edition
of the newsletter and a longer online version,
available at stanfordflipside.com.
"We want people to read it quickly in the bath
room," Keeshin said. "We don't want to invest too
much in one issue, and we want to make sure it's
always current."
ITiis goal resonates with Sarrah Nomanbhoy Tl.
who enjoys The Chaparral, Stanford's humor mag
azine, bui sometimes wishes that she could find
something more succinct. She considers The
Chappie's limited availability to be problematic as
well.
"It doesn't come out that much
and I don't go out of my way to find
it," Nomanbhoy said.
The Flipside's Financial Officer,
Agnes Omega '12, hopes the publica
tion's format and humor will do just
that.
"I like funny people and funny
things," Omega said, "so that was my
inspiration for The Flipside."
Keeshin published an under
ground newsletter in high school and
enjoyed the opportunity to entertain
his fellow students. Now seeking to
replicate that experience, Keeshin
says a "good" issue would include an
article about Stanford and an article
about politics. As the publication

grows, he hopes to expand the online
edition to include short video and
radio spoofs, much like The Onion
has done.
As for comedic inspiration, most
members expressed a love of The
Onion, including John Sanderson
'12, who also enjoys The Chappie.
Regarding The Chappie, Keeshin
and The Flipside have sought to
carve out their own niche in the
world of humor at Stanford, and
Sanderson is confident the two pub
lications will each present a unique
kind of humor to their readers.
When asked for their opinions
on The Flipside, editors at The

Chappie declined an interview
request.
Still, Sanderson says he sees
great things coming from The
Flipside.
"If students actually give this
thing a chance, then this could
expand to be something that's asso
ciated with Stanford in the long
run, much like Harvard is known
for the Harvard Lampoon," he
said. "If not, then I am confident
that it will at least be well-loved on
campus."
