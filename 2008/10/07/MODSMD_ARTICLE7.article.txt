## Students are tutors, not commuters 
### MELANIE SCHEIBLE 
a ttention Stanford students:
You are a hot commodity.
At the heart of Silicon Valley, with
scores of accomplished professionals
seeking to get their children on cam
puses such as ours, Stanford students
are in high demand in the tutoring in
dustry. After all, who better to help
high schoolers boost those SAT scores
than the folks who did it themselves a
year or two ago?
Just as president and founder of
F4Ed — a relatively popular, locally
based off-campus tutoring organiza
tion — Mike Rauta '04 said, parents
are often willing to offer higher rates to
Stanford students for their Stanford af
filiation.
Yet although the wallet-fattening
element ought to make private high
school tutoring an attractive option for
Stanford students, more and more are
actually taking on-campus jobs, de
spite the lower pay.
Indeed, the resident writing tutor
program, for example, has "grown a
lot" and gotten "a good reputation"
over the years, according to Peer Writ
ing Tutor Coordinator Erin Schwabe-
Fry *09.
"I would say it has a reputation as
being an honor because you're being
selected to help other Stanford stu
dents, and most Stanford students are
pretty good writers already," Sch wabe-
Fry said.
Plus, finding a lucrative private tu
toring gig off campus that does not go
through a major test prep organization
is not easy, and few students have an
idea of how to go about doing so.
For instance. Elizabeth Kao '10,
who was an appointment tutor for
Stanford's Center for Teaching and
Learning (CTL) last year and is a

FroSoCo Resident Tutor (RT) this
year, said that she never considered tu
toring off campus because of the in
convenience.
Furthermore, classified ads are
passe and ineffective against big-name
tutoring companies, and personal ad
vertising on Craigslist and Facebook
seems a little bit dubious.
As a result, some students do turn
to large off-campus tutoring organiza
tions such as Kaplan. Cardinal Educa
tion and Sylvan. These companies
heavily recruit Stanford students, en
ticing them with regular hours and pay
that is higher than what Stanford offers
its student employees.
There is also Rauta's F4Ed. which
started as a Stanford Graduate School
of Business class project. Although it is
no longer officially Stanford-affiliated,
its K-8 program includes 120 Stanford
undergraduate instructors. The $12-
$20 per teaching hour rates are compa

rable to those of Score and Kaplan,
and in addition to offering Stanford
students experience working with dif
ferent kinds of people off campus, the
tutees are well-heeled.
"Many of their parents are venture
capitalists and software company ex
ecutives, and a couple of the kids have
Palm Pilots " Rauta said.
Amy Steinberg '09, who has been
teaching elementary school students
through F4Ed since her sophomore
year, actually chose to work for F4Ed
over CTL for different reasons.
"1 liked working with younger
kids." she said. "They're always so ex
cited to see you, and you get to play
kickball during break."
"There's also a community aspect
of it — meeting these kids and their
parents," Steinberg added. "It's valu
able being connected with profession
als in the area who do want to get to
know a Stanford student."

Nonetheless, the majority of Stan
ford students still continue to opt for
more convenient, albeit lower-paying,
on-campus peer tutoring jobs through
CTL and the Hume Writing Center
(HWC) at a variety of locations at
Stanford, such as dorms. The Axe &
Palm, Bechtel and the Athletic Acade
mic Resource Center (AARC). At
CTL, wages start at $13 per hour, with
an increasing pay scale. Student tutors
enjoy the benefits of flexible hours, tu
toring space in lounges and classrooms
and free training.
Student tutors are listed on the
CTL website, and according to HWC
Administrative Assistant Eileen Eu
staquio, the HWC alone employs more
than 30 student tutors through a fairly
"competitive application process" that
indicates the program's popularity
among student tutors and the level of
commitment required of them.
Kao and Adeline Wong '10, anoth
er FroSoCo RT, say that part of the ap
peal of the job is the intellectual chal
lenge it provides.
While tutoring high schoolers
might pay better, Wong says,"the job
might become boring" due to the con
tent's differing difficulty levels.
"I like the idea of tutoring people
who are going through what 1 went
through already," Kao said. "And I can
still remember the struggle with the
material."
In fact, Kao, who decided that she
wanted to become a peer tutor after
utilizing RT office hours her freshman
year, isn't even sure about her RT
salary rate. Upon being asked if she
would mind sharing how much she
gets paid, she responded, "No — but
the thing is, I'd have to look it up."
While being a peer tutor may be a
healthy option for a college student's
wallet, it may just be about helping
others.
