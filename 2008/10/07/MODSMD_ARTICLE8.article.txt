## Editorial ID card system a step toward better security 
### 
The editorial board supports the imple
mentation of the ID card pilot pro
gram in Stern Hall, which allows stu
dents to access dorms via their cards, rather
than with traditional keys.The system is con
venient and will reduce costs associated with
changing the locks when keys are lost. We
hack the expansion of the pilot program,
which is an easy, non-intrusive way to in
crease security in student residences.
Stanford is generally a safe campus, and
the editorial board does not wish to see
heightened concerns over security change
the open and relaxed atmosphere of the
University. At the same time, however, the
episodes of violence that have occurred on
other campuses make increased security at
Stanford an unfortunate necessity.
The most important security feature of
the new dorm access system is the piercing
alarm that sounds when a door is propped or
held open for an extended period of time.
When the alarm sounds, housing officials are
notified and can monitor the system remote
ly. This feature will undoubtedly help to
solve the problem of propped doors.
What it cannot do, however, is solve the
problem of "tailgating"â€” when students
allow others to follow them into a residence
without knowing whether or not the follow
ers are authorized to be there. Housing offi
cials emphasize that it is the responsibility of
students to end the practice of tailgating and
ensure security in their dorms. But no stu

dent wants to be a security guard. Anyone
who has ever lived in a dorm knows that
leaving a fellow student standing outside of
a locked door would be incredibly awkward,
especially when the student says they are
there for a legitimate purpose, like a student
group meeting.
The current response to the tailgating
problem, the Door King system, is a step in
the right direction, though not ideal. Al
though Housing officials say that Door King
is heavily used, it has not eliminated tailgat
ing. The editorial board also recognizes that
there are often problems with the system:
phone numbers in Door King need to be up
dated more frequently: students often do
not bother to request repair of malfunction
ing phones, and sometimes do not set them
up; and the Door King box is not always lo
cated at the most convenient and heavily
used entry to the dorm.
We hope that the University will explore
ways to update the Door King system and
further encourage its use. We would like to
see this or a similar system available at all
entrances to residences. Along with imple
menting the new ID access system, the Uni
versity should research innovative methods
to curb tailgating. The ID access system
being piloted at Stern is definitely a step in
the right direction. More should be done to
find innovative ways to increase security
without relying on students to act as police
men.
