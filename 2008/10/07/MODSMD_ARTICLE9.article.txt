## The 						follies of Stanford admission 
### 
This column originally ran on May 20,2008.
The Daily reported last week that Stan
ford's current yield rate, the percent
age of students admitted who will like
ly attend, is 72 percent.The number may sur
prise many admission-watchers, since it was
above Stanford's past rates of 70.8 and 69
percent.
For the second consecutive year, it ap
pears Stanford has accepted too many stu
dents. Some feel it was done intentionally,
"to force the issue" on the proposal to ex
pand Stanford's class size. "Summer melt,"
however, will likely pull the yield rate down
to last year's — Harvard announced it will
be pulling 200 or so students from its waitlist
and Yale and Princeton each will accept
more than 50 students from theirs.
College admission consists of two sepa
rate pools of applicants. One group is those
students who clearly want to come to Stan
ford — those students tend to apply early
under the "Single-Choice Early Admission"
process. The second pool is made up of those
students who don't know where they want to
attend and need to be persuaded. It is this
group that Admit Weekend sorely under
serves. a topic I've discussed previously. It is
with this second type of students that Stan
ford fails to compete with Harvard. Yale and
MIT according to statistics published by the
"Revealed Preference Ranking" in Decem
ber, 2005.
The college admission battlefield has
shifted in recent years. Harvard has re
mained the de facto leader, dropping its
early admission program — Princeton fol
lowed. though Stanford and Yale did not.
Harvard was also the first college to an
nounce a massive new financial aid program
for middle-class students — Stanford an
nounced a new, less generous program a few
months later. And. overall, according to The
New York Times. I larvard is Stanford's main
competitor. On September 16. 2006. the
paper reported that 73 percent of students
choosing between Harvard and Stanford
would choose Harvard.
Stanford's admission process seems to re
veal a dangerous exceptionalism relative to
other schools. Rather than competing for
students on the same level as our peer
schools Harvard, Yale. Princeton and MIT,
we assume that students will come here even
though other schools offer better financial
aid packages and a more comprehensive
publicity campaign.
Attracting a diverse student body is im
portant. We shouldn't only want students
who are gung-ho to come here since junior
high — students who take a long time to
make up their mind are just as valuable. And

Stanford should be
competing for every
student it admits.

Stanford misses opportunities to attract stu
dents who might not have considered us ini
tially. Unlike all of those other schools, Stan
ford does not do alumni interviews, thereby
missing a crucial opportunity to engage
alumni, sell the Stanford experience and put
a personal, human face on the admission
process. Furthermore, we still engage in
early admission despite the inherent unfair
ness of the process and its abolition by Har
vard and Princeton.
What must be questioned is Stanford's
commitment to attracting the very best stu
dent. We assume that students will want to
come here no matter what. And while many
students have wanted to attend Stanford
since the day they took that tour sophomore
year of high school, many others don't feel
that way, and Stanford isn't doing enough to
compete for those students.
Does competing with the Ivy League for
cross-admits even matter? Most professors
probably wouldn't be able to notice a differ
ence if Stanford attracted 20 percent of
cross-admits with Harvard or 80 percent.
Hut the fact of the matter is. Stanford should
be competing for every student it admits.
Why bother to admit students unless we
want them to enroll? As of now, we are writ
ing off too many talented students.

Smart managed to write an essay that got him
in to Stanford, hut he failed to write a new col
umn this week. If you are curious about what
he would have written, contact him at
