## Editorial Applicants should be evaluated holistically 
### 
In the wake of the recent report from the
National Association for College Admis
sion Counseling (NACAC). which recom
mends a shift away from the use of standard
ized test scores, the editorial board encour
ages the Office of Undergraduate Admission
to undertake its own comprehensive evalua
tion of how these scores impact admission de
cisions. In contrast to the report, however, we
support the University's recent decision not
to abandon the tests.
The NACAC report contained some trou
bling yet unsurprising findings, most notably
that SAT or ACT test scores are correlated
with socioeconomic status, and that the enor
mous "test prep" industry has only increased
this divide.
Although acknowledging this disparity is
important, it is unclear to what degree this
finding affects the actual admission process at
Stanford. Many schools, especially large state
universities, continue to rely on "index"
scores that automatically admit students who
have certain grades and standardized test
scores. Because Stanford's admission process
attempts to be more holistic, an internal study
could provide a more accurate assessment of
the effect the standardized tests have on ap
plicants from less advantageous back
grounds.
Even if an internal report found that the
SAT and ACT disproportionately give ad
vantage to wealthy Stanford applicants, we
are skeptical as to whether or not making the
tests "optional" would solve the problem. It
seems likely that students from privileged
backgrounds would continue to undergo ex
tensive test preparation and submit their high
scores, and it would be difficult for admissions
officers to simply ignore those numbers. At
the same time, an applicant whose above-av
erage score might have been remarkable in
the context of his or her disadvantaged back
ground choose not to take the test at

all, leaving the admission office with a less
complete picture of his or her accomplish
ments.
Furthermore, the test provides at least one
measure of evaluation consistent across the
country. Grades can he inflated and recom
mendations can be exaggerated, hut the ACT
and SAT provide standardized measures of
evaluation.Test scores should by no means be
the central factor in admission, as many qual
ified applicants may test poorly. The Univer
sity clearly needs to demonstrate to students
that paying $ 1.0(H) for a prep course that in
creases their scores from 7(H)s to 750s should
not make a difference in their admission to
Stanford. Low test scores, though, may set off
a necessary alarm when other parts of an ap
plication seem in place.
Instead of no longer requiring standard
ized tests, we encourage Stanford and other
universities to think about more creative
ways to prepare high school students from
less privileged backgrounds for the college
admission process and college itself. For ex
ample, perhaps universities could begin spon
soring free test-preparation classes for low
income students in their areas. Programs that
encourage students to start planning for col
lege early in life would also be more helpful.
Finally, if a major concern is the impact of the
standardized testing industry, schools could
ask students to report on their applications
whether or not they took a test preparation
class.
For many privileged children, the college
admission race is a marathon that begins as
early as kindergarten — merely eliminating
one test that is taken near the end of high
school is not an easy solution to those en
trenched differences. For that reason, the ed
itorial board appreciates Stanford's holistic
admission process, which — while still requir
ing the SAT or ACT — evaluates candidates
within the context of their backgrounds.
