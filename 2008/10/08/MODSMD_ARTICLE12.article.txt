# "Like a Rock"
## "Welcome to Alcatraz" 
### 
Before I get into this.my first article of
my first Stanford Daily column. I want
to introduce myself. Hello! As you
probably guessed from the byline, my name
is Kevin, and yes, I do look somewhat like
the picture above this column. I'm a senior, a
former Resident Assistant, a head writer, an
American, a pretty good kisser (just saying),
a grilled-cheese aficionado and 1 have very
little idea what I'm going to do with my life.
I'm friendly, and I like to think that I dress
okay, but 1 rarely shave, I stay up late and I
really, really like dinosaurs. If that's a prob
lem for you, there are probably some hard
hitting pieces on the election by serious, in
formed people somewhere else on this page.
Still reading? That's great.The next ques
tion that you should be wondering is, "Why
did he name this column 'Like a Rock'?"
You always have asked good questions,
Reader. Well. I've come up with two primary
reasons for you.
The first is that, like my column will be,
rocks are unobtrusive but heavy, they're
often the color gray and they're fun to talk to
when you're lonely. I don't really know why
you would talk to an article, but that's the
kind of thing you should feel free to do with
my column.
The other reason for my column's name
is that I hope an ailing Chevrolet will see my
column, realize I am reaching lots of hip,
young people such as yourself and give me a
million bazillion dollars for my implied
sponsorship of its automobiles.
Feel free to knock me if you want — here
I am, a member of "the media" for barely a
day and I already am trying to sell out. What
you don't realize is that that's how you know
I am unbiased; a biased person would al
ready be paid to believe in something.
Speaking of beliefs, I — and therefore
my column — happen to hold several of
them, though with sufficient incentive these
could definitely be more like guidelines than
rules for me. Hint. I believe in:
I. Reform. I love Stanford. I truly believe
we have some of the most talented, promis
ing young people on the planet, and our
school deserves ample credit for hiring
many passionate professors and staff, for
fostering our growth as students and as citi
zens and for getting us here in the first place.
That said, between our forced dining
plans, our overly sedated changes to Old
Union, our programs and employees who
are difficult to praise or criticize and our sel
dom-unified student body, I know there is
room for improvement. This year, I will be
serving on the Old Union Advisory Board,
so please feel free to email me with your

complaints, suggestions and offers to go out
with me.
Although I will use this column to ad
dress my qualms, I will always try to provide
straightforward suggestions on how to fix
them. While our administrators may make
decisions I disagree with or that are, from
time to time, wrong, most people I have met
here are passionate about what they do, and
they deserve to be treated as adults capable
of making good decisions, as do we.
2. Journalistic standards. As your dedicat
ed columnist for this quarter, I promise that
I will not plagiarize others' works, promote a
forged — though inspirational — book,em
phasize that Barack Obama's middle name
is "Hussein." open up a deceased mob boss'
glove compartment or reveal undercover
CIA agents' names to you.
I can't promise I won't make up stuff, but
at least I am being honest about that. In my
column. I hope to combine the intelligence of
The New York Times with the everyman ap
peal of The Washington Post — with a dash
of the homegrown, spunky Silicon Valley
vibe of the San Jose Mercury News during its
Knight-Ridder days thrown in for good
measure. And if I make a joke that you don't
understand, pretend that I am the New York
er and that you are everyone else. If you're
smart, you should laugh anyway so that your
friends will know that you are cultured.
3. A Thing Called Love. It is on repeat as
I write. The notes lead singer Justin Hawkins
hits are inspiringly high, but this is the 20th
time I have heard the song tonight, and, by
now, the song's high-energy riffs and deeply
reflective lyrics are not motivating me to fin
ish this column nearly as much as the
thought of changing the song.
So here we are, at the finish of this, my
first Stanford Daily column. It has been a
journey, the first of many I hope we will
enjoy together, as though we are on some
kind of booze cruise of news. That rhymed,
which makes it just about as good a conclu
sion as I can imagine, l ime for some Funky
Town.
