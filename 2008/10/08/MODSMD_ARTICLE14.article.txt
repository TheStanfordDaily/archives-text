## Gettin' some discipline 
### 
Now. I love the Internet as much as the
next guy. On the Internet, after all. I
can do things I can't do in real life, like
laugh at videos of Sarah Palin playing the
flute, coo over pictures of cats in various
adorable positions and communicate with
girls. For that much, at least. I owe A 1 Gore a
profound debt of gratitude.
But I also hate the Internet. Kittens, gos
sip blogs and online punditry can divert in
credible amounts of time away from more
important activities, like homework, sleep
and digestion. It's an undeniable fact that
most people would rather delete another
email from moveon.org than do anything
productive.
That, of course, makes it hard to be pro
ductive.
I'm sure many of you oh-so-busy Stanford
students are familiar with the experience of a
ticking clock, impending deadline and des
perate search for one more interesting Web
site to visit before beginning your paper
about Renaissance conceptions of the
human male forefinger. I sure am. It's not a
pleasant one.
When I realized that I was wasting as
much as an hour each day reading blogs
about how to increase my productivity — a
wonderfully symbolic low — I decided I'd
had enough. My life would no longer be con
trolled by a sea of tabs.each crying out for my
attention. I would steel myself and take
charge, dropkick my Internet addiction out
the window. Great expanses of time would
unfold before me. and I could give my aca
demics, activities and friendships (once I got
some!) the attention they deserved.
It was a great idea. A fantastic idea, really.
In fact, it was a fantastic idea every single
time I tried it. But. of course, it never worked.
I am a sick, wretched person. I have no
strength of will. I have no self-control. Each
individual click has a negligibly negative con
sequence, so I click and click and click, furi

ously aggravating my future carpal tunnel.
The Internet is bright and colorful and flashy
and informative and accessible on the same
machine I use to do my homework.
For people like me, attempts to avoid it
are a no-go. Painfully so.
I tried a whole array of tricks, strategies
and 12-step plans in an attempt to beat my
Internet addiction.
First, I just decided I would simply stop
using the Internet too much. That didn't
work. Then I tried to set designated times
each day for Internet leisure, which didn't
work either. After that. I tried keeping the
wireless on only at certain times, and then I
tried keeping my computer on only at certain
times.
The latter two approaches didn't work be
cause I needed the wireless and computer for
legitimate tasks throughout the day,and once
I had turned them on, it was impossible to es
cape the allure of election news.
The former two approaches didn't work
because, while it is easy for me to avoid
watching a two-hour movie, it is very difficult
to resist the inarguable claim that one single
Web site visit has no significant impact on my
life. 'ITie problem is that each of these in
significant impacts adds up to great signifi
cance. but there is no way for me to deny just
one.
So,clearly. I lack self-control — in the tra
ditional sense, at least. Many others and I.
however, have realized that we do possess a
sort of second-order self-control. This second
kind of self-control is one that requires step

ping hack from the moment and making one
decision that increases the negative conse
quences of each of those other, individual,
formerly insignificant decisions.
For example, I have trouble not eating
candy, hut if there's no candy in my room, I
obviously have few problems refraining. I
can't resist eating one single, not-significant
ly harmful piece of candy, but it's easy for me
to resist the decision to buy an entire bag
when I am in the store.
A philosophy professor of mine once
talked about how he would sit down and
watch the TV whenever he passed it, so he
simply moved the TV into a room he didn't
walk through very often. To watch TV, he
would have to walk to another room, an ex
pense of effort that made him quickly move
on to another activity.
To my great fortune, I found a tool that en
abled a similar kind of second-order self-con
trol for the Internet. All Firefox users should,
this very second, download and install an ex
tension called Leechblock, which effectively
limits or restricts your access to certain Web
sites. It's configurable by day of week, time of
day and total minutes per day.
My time on fivethirtyeight.com is limited
to five minutes a day,and some sites, like red
dit.com, will never be seen again. Leechblock
even has a clever setting that makes it impos
sible to change the settings for a particular
site while it's blocked. Voila! My life is fixed.
Leechblock has made me 50 pounds lighter,
four years younger and the envy of my
friends and neighbors. Second-order self
control has worked for me — you should try
it too!

Now that he possesses vast reserves of free lime
and self-discipline, Alex can he found practic
ing Qigong on the Quad at 5 a.m. every week
day morning. If however, you and Leechhlock
are still working on your Internet addiction,
send your thoughts to aproman@stanford.edu.
