## Ailes and libero: a perfect fit 
### BY DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
Her position wasn't even recognized
in volleyball until 2002. Before
coming to Stanford, she had only
played five games at the position.
But she is there now, and libero
Gabi Ailes is the rock of the Stanford defense.
The sophomore from Bellevue, Neb. can
dig any ball that comes her way with great ex
ecution. She has terrific defensive instincts and
an incredible passion for the game.
Ailes grew up in Nebraska City, Neb. before
moving to Bellevue at the age of nine to pur
sue a higher level of volleyball. At 5-foot-7.she
played outside hitter nearly her entire volley
ball career, and was named the 2006 Nebraska
Gatorade State Player of the Year. But, be
cause of her height and defensive instincts,
Ailes knew collegiate programs would pursue
her for her potential to play libero.
The libero position was added to the
women's volleyball game six years ago, and
head coach John Dunning says of all the
changes to the sport in recent history, the addi
tion of the libero has been the most significant.
"Every team with a good libero is a
stronger team," Dunning said. "[With Gabi],
we definitely have that."
The libero is a position unlike any other po
sition on the court. Ailes is able to substitute
freely in and out without using up one of the
team's allotted substitutions each game. She is
a defensive specialist but cannot block or at
tack the ball when it is above the net. When the
rotation moves a tall outside hitter to the back
row. Ailes can come in and replace her, and her
addition in the back row — rather than an out
side hitter who is not as skilled defensively —
is huge.
"[The libero] allows us to have our best dig
ger and passer on the court the entire match,"
Dunning said. "The better [Gabi] is passing,
the better our offense is."
Her main job is to dig the ball when the op
ponent fires a hit. When playing against such
high-quality opponents, the balls can come
very fast.
"If you are not in the right place at the right
time, then good luck digging the ball." she said.
She could not put much else about the art of
digging into words except that "it's harder
than it looks."
Ailes, besides having the best defensive
skills on the court, has perhaps the toughest in
stincts and biggest competitive spirit on the

team. The libero is a naturally outgoing, ag
gressive and competitive position that brings a
lot of energy and determination to the lineup.
Ailes without a doubt embodies all those qual
ities.
"She plays with a big heart," Dunning said.
"She loves to get alter it. She sacrifices whatev
er it takes and wants to help her team win in

whatever way she can."
Ailes has started every Stanford game from
the moment she put on a Cardinal uniform;
though not rare for a freshman with her talent,
it was still somewhat nerve-wracking.
"After my first three games, the nerves went
away," Ailes said. "It took a while for it to soak
in that I was actually playing with an amazing

team that would soon make it to the [NCAA]
Championship."
"She's a very good athlete with all the in
tangibles," Duning said of her winning the
libero job from day one. "She has worked very
hard and played at a very high level."

"She sacrifices whatever
it takes and wants to help
her team win in whatever
way she can."

Volleyball runs in Ailes' hlood. She has
played organized volleyball since she was six.
but also played with her parents in the gym
and with her sister in her Nebraska home. She
was a decorated tennis player and basketball
player in high school, but those just became ac
tivities to help keep Ailes in shape for volley
ball.
The two-time high school Ail-American
was recruited by the likes of Stanford. Nebras
ka and Missouri.Though the other two schools
have great volleyball programs — Nebraska
won the NCAA title over Stanford the year
before Ailes arrived on the Farm — for Ailes it
was a no-brainer.
"it was not a tough decision to choose Stan
ford," she said. "Missouri and Nebraska are
also great schools, but I wanted to move away
and experience something new."
Ailes regards the NCAA Final Four last
year as her fondest memory in her young Stan
ford career, especially the thrilling semi-final
victory over USC.
"1 have never been more excited to play
volleyball than in the semis and National
Championship" she said. "I will always re
member how USC served the ball out-of
bounds when they had [match] point in the
fifth game."
In her first year. Ailes made a big splash in
the Stanford program. Dunning dubbed her
first year "an amazing freshman season" —
she was the only player on the roster to play in
all 125 games. Furthermore, she set a school
record for single-season dies with 533, shatlc;« -
