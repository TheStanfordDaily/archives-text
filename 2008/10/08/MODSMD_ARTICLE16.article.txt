## Riley lives out Olympic dream in Beijing 
### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
Like many Stanford students, junior Ali
Riley did a fair hit of traveling over her sum
mer vacation. She even spent some time in a
small village in China. Only this wasn't your
typical Chinese village in the countryside —
t his was the Olympic Village in Beijing.
Riley — a fullback for the Stanford
women's soccer team — fulfilled her child
hood dream by participating in the Olympics
this summer with the New Zealand national
team.
"It's hard to put the (Olympic) experience
into words: it was so amazing," Riley said. "I
still can't believe it really happened.
"It just felt so surrcai to be a part of some
thing I had been dreaming about since 1 was a
little girl." she continued."! was about five or
six when I announced to my parents that I
would be in the Olympics one day. I think at
that time I sat in the goal and picked the (low
ers [during games]."
Obviously. Riley has made great strides
since her flower-picking days. She played all
90 minutes in each of the Football Ferns' three
Olympic matches and picked up an assist in
their opening 2-2 draw against Japan. While
the team lost its next two games to Norway
and eventual gold medalists USA to fall out of
the tournament, Riley — who was born in the
U.S. but has dual citizenship through her fa
ther — was still proud of her adoptive coun
try.
"Being on the same field with the best of
the best is first of all terrifying, but it also
drives you to run faster and work harder," she
said. "Playing with the New Zealand team
taught me that [having] heart and desire real
ly does pay off. Nobody believed in us,and no
body expected anything from us. |but| we
fought hard to prove that we deserve to be
playing on the world stage."
Riley also enjoyed the rest of the Olympic
experience outside of the competition. Al
though her team was unable to participate in
the Opening Ceremony due to its match
schedule, she was able to spend time in the
Olympic Village, which she called the high
light of the trip.
"There are incredible resources
there for the athletes, from Internet
cafes and arcades to a beautiful pool
and gigantic gym," Riley said. "I have
no idea if there were thousands of
condoms there — that is usually the
first question I get asked. 1 did hang
out with Ronaldinho, though, which
was nuts."
Of course, college soccer isn't near
ly on the same stage as the Olympics
— the players do homework in be
tween games instead of chilling with
Ronaldinho — but Riley says the con
stant transition between international
and college levels isn't as difficult as it
may seem.
"Honestly, the high level of the col
lege game has made switching back
and forth a breeze," she said, although
she admitted that the traveling part
can be difficult sometimes.
"There are so many talented play
ers on the team here, and almost
everyone has played for a national
team [at a youth level] at some time,"

she added. "'Hie fitness, the skill and
the belief required are the same at
both levels."
Riley also had another transition
to make this year: switching from the
forward position that she played last
year to fullback.
"Ali is a great defender and a great
attacker," Stanford head coach Paul
Ratcliffe said."This year, we had some
great attacking freshmen come in,so I
thought it would be a good fit to move
her back. And she still helps us attack
on the flank, so it's a good fit for her
and the team."
Riley also played outside midfield
er for the national team, and she ad
mits that that made it much easier for
her to move to the outside of the de
fense with Stanford. The move has
worked out beautifully for both play
er and team, as Riley has been a rock
on a backline that has allowed only
three goals in its first 11 games. She has
been effective, using her speed in
going forward on the flank as well.

with three assists on the season.
Ratcliffe can tell that her Olympic
experience has been a key part of her
stellar start to the season.
"I think she's made great strides,"
he said. "All of the experience that
she's had has helped her become a re
ally polished player, and a great leader
as well."
In fact, those leadership skills led
Ratcliffe to name the junior a co-cap
tain, along with seniors Marisa Abegg
and Allison Falk. Riley agrees that the
Olympic experience helped her grow
a lot, but it hasn't diminished her love
for college soccer.
"It was such an honor to partici
pate in this world event, and I will
treasure the memories," she said. "I
met some amazing people who have
made huge impacts on my life. But I
am glad to be back and playing for this
awesome Stanford team!"
