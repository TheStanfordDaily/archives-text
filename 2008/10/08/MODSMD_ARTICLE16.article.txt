## Riley lives out Olympic dream in Beijing 
### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
Like many Stanford students, junior Ali
Riley did a fair hit of traveling over her sum
mer vacation. She even spent some time in a
small village in China. Only this wasn't your
typical Chinese village in the countryside —
t his was the Olympic Village in Beijing.
Riley — a fullback for the Stanford
women's soccer team — fulfilled her child
hood dream by participating in the Olympics
this summer with the New Zealand national
team.
"It's hard to put the (Olympic) experience
into words: it was so amazing," Riley said. "I
still can't believe it really happened.
"It just felt so surrcai to be a part of some
thing I had been dreaming about since 1 was a
little girl." she continued."! was about five or
six when I announced to my parents that I
would be in the Olympics one day. I think at
that time I sat in the goal and picked the (low
ers [during games]."
Obviously. Riley has made great strides
since her flower-picking days. She played all
90 minutes in each of the Football Ferns' three
Olympic matches and picked up an assist in
their opening 2-2 draw against Japan. While
the team lost its next two games to Norway
and eventual gold medalists USA to fall out of
the tournament, Riley — who was born in the
U.S. but has dual citizenship through her fa
ther — was still proud of her adoptive coun
try.
"Being on the same field with the best of
the best is first of all terrifying, but it also
drives you to run faster and work harder," she
said. "Playing with the New Zealand team
taught me that [having] heart and desire real
ly does pay off. Nobody believed in us,and no
body expected anything from us. |but| we
fought hard to prove that we deserve to be
playing on the world stage."
Riley also enjoyed the rest of the Olympic
experience outside of the competition. Al
though her team was unable to participate in
the Opening Ceremony due to its match
schedule, she was able to spend time in the
Olympic Village, which she called the high
light of the trip.
