GAME NOTES: The ITAs have been problematic for the Card
ovor the last several years. That didn't change this year as
Stanford managed just a single victory, from sophomore
Hilary Barte, before being eliminated from the tournament.
Stanford will now have a break before play resumes with
the ITA Regional Championships here on Friday, Oct.
17th. Regular season play doesn't begin until January.

As strong as the Stanford women's tennis
program has been, it simply cannot break
through at the ITA Ail-American Champi
onships.
The Cardinal women fell short once again
in search of their first singles title since 1990
and first doubles title since 2000 at the Cham
pionships this week. Last year Stanford was
shut out. failing to record any victories in the
main draw. This year, the Cardinal managed
just a single win.
Though it may seem like bad luck, sopho
more Hilary Barte isn't ready to lay the blame
there.
"Personally 1 don't believe in luck," Barte
said.
In her first All-American Championships,
the hard-hitting lefty — who solidified the
Cardinal lineup at No. I last season — escaped
the opening round of play with a 5-7. 6-4. 6-2
victory against Duke's Reka Zsilinszka. Down
a set and 4-1. Barte stormed back after a time
out with head coach Lele Forood. Unfortu
nately, after the draining victory. Barte fell to
hometown friend Georgia Rose of Northwest
ern 7-6 (2), 6-3 in the second round.
"I think we were all tired going into the
tournament," Barte said. "The next day, I just
had nothing left. I started cramping towards
the end of the second set against Reka."
"But no excuses with it," Barte added.
"They were playing well, and we just have to
work harder and that's all."

Also representing the Cardinal in the main
draw was returning All-American senior Jessi
ca Nguyen. Nguyen fell to Amanda McDowell
of Georgia Tech 6-3. 6-1 in the first round. In
the consolation draw, Nguyen dropped out
with a lingering wrist injury.
In doubles. Barte and Ail-American junior
Lindsay Burdette fell in the first round <8-2
against Duke's Melissa Mang and Amanda
Granson. Hncouraged by their play. Barte
and Burdette defeated the team of Ashley
Joelson and Yasmin Schnack of I K I A 8-0 in
the consolation bracket, but eventually lost 8-
3 to Lenka Broosova and Csilla Borsanyi of
Baylor.

"I thought we played well in doubles."
Barte s;iid. "We didn't practice much, so I ind
sav and 1 are just getting reacquainted. 1 was
really happy with the way we played and the
other teams just played better."
The issue of a lack of practice seems to be a
recurring theme with each passing All-Ameri
can Championship. With Stanford starting
classes just a week before the Championships,
the Cardinal women had little time to readjust
to college life in addition to collegiate-level
tennis.

Junior Lindsay Burdette (pictured) paired with sophomore Hilary Barte in doubles. The duo lost in
the first round and won a single match in the consolation bracket before being eliminated.
"I think it's always a tough tour
nament for us because we start a
week after school starts," Barte said.
"Other schools have been in for a
month, so they're a little more set
tled into the routine of college life. I
felt a little hectic after just moving in
and leaving to play a tournament."
Then again. Barte isn't one to use
excuses for her game.
"I mean, we're not the only girls
doing that," Barte added. "The fact
is that it shouldn't affect us that
much."
As they fine-tune their games in
the fall season, the Stanford women
cannot help but notice the growing
parity throughout collegiate tennis.
The last two national champi
onships have gone to Georgia Tech
and UCLA. Moreover, Stanford suf
fered an embarrassing loss to Cali
fornia early last season, a testament
to the increasing difficulty of the Pa
cific-10 Conference.
"Even though we're working
hard, the other teams are working
hard," Barte conceded. "I think the
level has gone up and everyone
looks good. We need to stay focused
on what we can do and what we can
control to make the best of it."
Fortunately for the Cardinal,
there is much time left before its first
dual match against UC-Davis in late
January. In less than two weeks,
Stanford will host the ITA North
west Regional Championships.
Rounding off Stanford's fall season
are the ITA National Indoor Cham
pionships and the Freeman Invita
tional.
As for now, the Cardinal must
continue the hard work on the court
and stay healthy if it has any chance

of claiming its first national title
since 2006.
"I'm definitely excited about this
season," Barte said. "I wasn't really
sure what to expect coming back for
my second year. I'm excited for the
season to start and excited to work
hard in the fall and get things going.
We're all working really hard and
that's definitely a positive."
