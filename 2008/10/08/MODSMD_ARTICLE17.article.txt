GAME NOTES: The ITAs have been problematic for the Card
ovor the last several years. That didn't change this year as
Stanford managed just a single victory, from sophomore
Hilary Barte, before being eliminated from the tournament.
Stanford will now have a break before play resumes with
the ITA Regional Championships here on Friday, Oct.
17th. Regular season play doesn't begin until January.

As strong as the Stanford women's tennis
program has been, it simply cannot break
through at the ITA Ail-American Champi
onships.
The Cardinal women fell short once again
in search of their first singles title since 1990
and first doubles title since 2000 at the Cham
pionships this week. Last year Stanford was
shut out. failing to record any victories in the
main draw. This year, the Cardinal managed
just a single win.
Though it may seem like bad luck, sopho
more Hilary Barte isn't ready to lay the blame
there.
"Personally 1 don't believe in luck," Barte
said.
In her first All-American Championships,
the hard-hitting lefty — who solidified the
Cardinal lineup at No. I last season — escaped
the opening round of play with a 5-7. 6-4. 6-2
victory against Duke's Reka Zsilinszka. Down
a set and 4-1. Barte stormed back after a time
out with head coach Lele Forood. Unfortu
nately, after the draining victory. Barte fell to
hometown friend Georgia Rose of Northwest
ern 7-6 (2), 6-3 in the second round.
"I think we were all tired going into the
tournament," Barte said. "The next day, I just
had nothing left. I started cramping towards
the end of the second set against Reka."
"But no excuses with it," Barte added.
"They were playing well, and we just have to
work harder and that's all."

Also representing the Cardinal in the main
draw was returning All-American senior Jessi
ca Nguyen. Nguyen fell to Amanda McDowell
of Georgia Tech 6-3. 6-1 in the first round. In
the consolation draw, Nguyen dropped out
with a lingering wrist injury.
In doubles. Barte and Ail-American junior
Lindsay Burdette fell in the first round <8-2
against Duke's Melissa Mang and Amanda
Granson. Hncouraged by their play. Barte
and Burdette defeated the team of Ashley
Joelson and Yasmin Schnack of I K I A 8-0 in
the consolation bracket, but eventually lost 8-
3 to Lenka Broosova and Csilla Borsanyi of
Baylor.

"I thought we played well in doubles."
Barte s;iid. "We didn't practice much, so I ind
sav and 1 are just getting reacquainted. 1 was
really happy with the way we played and the
other teams just played better."
The issue of a lack of practice seems to be a
recurring theme with each passing All-Ameri
can Championship. With Stanford starting
classes just a week before the Championships,
the Cardinal women had little time to readjust
to college life in addition to collegiate-level
tennis.
