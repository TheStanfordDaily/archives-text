# Cubs good, despite early exit
## 
### 
For Chicago Cubs fans, the
dream is over. Turns out that
this isn't going to be the year
after all.
Frankly, that is surprising, in a
number of ways. The Cubs were
clearly the most talented all
around team in the National
League, featuring a balanced of
fense with some real star power
(Derrek Lee, Alfonso Soriano and
Aramis Ramirez) and a pitching
staff that seemed built for postsea
son domination.
They also had a century-long
history of failure heading into the
2008 postseason, making the sweep
suffered at the hands of the Los
Angeles Dodgers in the National
League Division Series all the
more painful for Cubbies' fans
everywhere.
Given all this, a sweep would've
been bad enough in the opening
round of the playoffs. But a sweep
in which the Cubs looked com
pletely lifeless, hopeless and care
less? Well, that's a downright
Chicago catastrophe.
If they couldn't win it this year,
when will they ever be able to? If
they couldn't even put up a fight,
when everything seemed to be so
lined up for October to bleed Cub
bie blue, when will they ever be
able to make it over that century
long hump, enforced by the curse of
the Billy Goat and the half-drunk
but-still-lovable ramblings of
Harry Caray?
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
The line of thinking following the
Cubs' disheartening meltdown was
as wrong as it was predictable.
You see, the thing is. the Cubs
are no worse as a team now than
they were a week ago when the sky
was the limit and the national
media was singing their praises.
They've still got that three-headed
monster of Carlos Zambrano, Rich
Harden ar.H Ryan Dempster lead
ing their rotation — or at least they
will once they expectedly re-sign
Dempster. They've still got the bal
anced and deadly offense that
helped them lead the NL in runs
scored.
Sure, it's okay, and even expect
ed that Chicagoans are currently
mourning another lost season and
another dead opportunity. Every
year, that happens to 29 of the 30
major-league teams. If Cubs fans
are feeling that loss a little more
than most because they've experi
enced it quite a bit lately, well, that
makes sense too.
But to talk like the team isn't
worth following anymore — like
the whole sport is pointless because
not only is it not happening this
year, but it never will happen ever .
. . well, that's just ridiculous.
The thing is. the playoffs are im
portant in baseball, or any sport for
that matter. But they aren't neces
sarily a good indicator of how good
a team actually is — especially in
baseball. In a sport based on preci
sion more than prowess, based on
one's ability to hit a round ball with
a round bat squarely (oh. by the
way. the ball is moving at 9(i-plus
miles per hour), a hefty 162-game
schedule is almost a necessity. It
takes that many games and that
large of a sample size to figure out
who is actually good and who just
got lucky for a few weeks or
months.
Then, all of a sudden, six months
after the start of the marathon sea
son. the whole nature of the game
changes. Suddenly, victory and de
feat is summed up in a best-of-five
or best-of-seven series. Anything
literally can. and does, happen.
Great teams can on occasion look
awful, and mediocre teams can
look great.
It is. in fact, little more than a
proverbial crapshoot. Ask the 2006
St. Louis Cardinals, the 2003 Flori
da Marlins or the 2001 Arizona Di
amondbacks. Because of the play
off format, the best team doesn't al
ways win, and we like it that way, on
the whole. It leaves room for drama
and the unexpected. It leaves room
for epic rises and catastrophic col
lapses. It leaves room for what hap
pened to the Cubs.
But doubt the merits of this

team at your own peril. 162 games
say they're pretty darn good.Three
games say they're not. I'll bet on
the former, personally, and be
happy with the odds.
In short, other than that pesky
curse, there's no need to panic.

long-term. This is a team that will
be back in 2009, as strong as ever.
So be afraid, Cubs fans. I'm here
to give you hope. And as you all
now know, that's the deadliest
thing about being a fan. Because
once you have hope, it can be
crushed.
