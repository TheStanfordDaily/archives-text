# Career prospects strong despite slow economy
## Career fair draws 318 firms, hundreds of job seekers 
### KATE BARBER 
Yesterday was another lousy day for the
American economy â€” the Dow Jones
Industrial Average dipped under 10,000
points and the Fed flirted with cutting inter
est rates. But don't tell that to the 318 com
panies and hundreds of students who crowd
ed White Plaza on Tuesday afternoon for the
annual fall career fair.
According to Lance Choy, director of the
Career Development Center, there was a
healthy turnout of companies at the event,
which was actually bigger than last year's ver
sion.
"There will be fewer investment banks
and banks in general; tech is still going
strong," Choy said.
Still, some students were so worried that
the economic downturn would hurt job
prospects that they are now considering grad
uate schools and public service opportunities.
"Yesterday I woke up and saw the global
economy crashing," fretted economics major
Stephanie Alessi '09."N0w I'm simultaneous
ly looking at jobs and graduate schools."
Choy expects to see fewer students turn
ing to jobs immediately following Stanford.
"During a downturn in the economy we
expect to see an increase in grad school appli
cations: that's traditionally what's happened."
Choy said. "We usually see an increase in
applications for non-profits like Teach for
America. People start looking at alternatives,
which sometimes is a good thing."
Hie hardest hit will probably be econom
ics majors going into finance and related

fields.
"I was planning on working in investment
banking, hut due to the financial crisis, most
of these institutions either declared bank
ruptcy, laid-off employees or restructured
their whole business plan," said economics
major Tom Vacek '10. "As a result, the compe
tition for alternative jobs such as consulting,
and sales and trading is greater than ever,
while the positions available are more limit
ed."
Logan Ardis, an analyst tabling for invest
ment banking firm Barrington Associates,
agreed that investment banking jobs will be
tougher to find.
"We will hire just as many as last year,
though many banks will not," Ardis said.
Allison kirsch, of The Brattle Group, a
consulting firm, expects to see some spillover
of students previously interested in banking
who are now turning towards consulting.
"Our pool of candidates will be different,
but we won't be affected." Kirsch said.
Uncertainty is a common theme in the cal
culus of today's job market. Many seniors
and students in pre-business organizations
feel that it's hard to know exactly what the
economic situation will do for their job and
internship prospects, and are keeping options
open and thinking outside of the box.
"Options in the finance sector are now
more limited and therefore more competi
tive. but students who are determined and
passionate about their career choice will be
able to stand out from the crowd." said
AKPsi member Ricky Yean '10. "1 think this
is the best time for people to jump into the
startup world and try to create something of
value."
Regardless of the uncertain job market,
students were split about the value of attend
ing a career fair.

"The career fair is a perfect opportunity to
meet your future prospective employers and
prove that you really are a personable and
talented person whom they will want to hire,"
said Vacek.
Others were more critical of the process.

"I'm personally unconvinced that the
information sessions at the career fair actual
ly have an impact," said James Vaughan '09. "I
honestly think that if a company saw a
resume or transcript that genuinely
impressed them, they wouldn't pick person X

who'd gone to the information session over
that person."
Choy emphasized that the career fair only
represents companies that chose to come to


PHUONG NGUYEN/The Stanford Daily
According to CDC Director Lance Choy, this year's career fair drew more companies than last year's. Although, finance jobs were
affected by the economic downturn, most other jobs remained unaffected. Students are now turning to other options, such as graduate school.
campus to recruit, and that students
should keep in mind the Cardinal
Careers Database in researching
potential jobs.
Despite uncertainties about the
job market and the value of career
fairs, morale among students was

relatively high. Students were quick
to point out that Stanford remains
Stanford. And if Tuesday's career
fair is evidence, companies are
recruiting on campus as fervently as
ever.
"We're all at Stanford and maybe
we'll have to be more flexible."
Alessi said, "but we're probably not
going to lose our jobs."
