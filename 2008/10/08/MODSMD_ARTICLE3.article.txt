## Students rate Farm on Unigo New college-review site relies on student content 
### ALAN GUO 
A new, user-generated college
review site, lJnigo.com. is trying to
involve current college students in
helping high school seniors decide
between colleges.
Launched on Sept. IS, linigo has
collected more than 35,000 pieces
of content, including reviews, pic
tures and videos, from students at
250 colleges, including Stanford.
"We want to provide students
the insider experience of the col
leges," said Jordan Goldman. 26,
founder of the site.
Goldman cited his experience
working at a paper-copy, Princeton
Review-style college-review hook
as the origin of his idea.
"[There are] so many schools

with thousands of students and fac
ulties," he said. "You cannot just
sum them up in two or three
pages."
Unigo seeks opinions from cur
rent students or alumni of the col
leges and asks them to share their
experience online.
"It's important to represent a
campus from all different student
perspectives, different political

views, different sexual orientations,
different socioeconomic back
grounds and different parts of the
country," Goldman said.
Stanford currently has 35
reviews and 22 videos on the site,
voicing diverse academic and social
experiences. In contrast, at
Davidson, a small liberal arts col
lege in North Carolina, about 10
percent of students provided their
own views of the college.
Goldman said the site aims to dif
ferentiate itself from other college
review sites like College
Confidential.com.
"Unlike a message board, users

can upload multimedia content on
our site." he said.
Several students saw both posi
tives and negatives in the site.
"I really like the idea," said
Claudia Chern '11. "The only poten
tial flaw is accuracy of information,
since it is a wiki."
"I think the most important part
of the Web site is the videos and the
student reviews." added Astastia
Myers '11 upon exploring the site.
"The editorial commentary is just a
blanket statement."
