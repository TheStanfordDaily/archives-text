# STUDENT GOV'T
## ASSU executives place special focus on public service 
### NIKHIL JOSHI DESK EDITOR 
Jonny Dorsey '09 and Fagan Harris '09.
ASSU president and vice president, will not he
running the typical student government. In an
interview with The Daily, the duo made it clear
that it would be an administration focused on
the larger, deeper issues — things like campus
mental health, sustain ability, diversity and
public service — and not the standard ASSU
fare of bike lights and barbecues.
"If we leave office and next year's platform

is foosball tables, then we will be very disap
pointed." Harris said.
Armed with compelling public service
backgrounds — Dorsey founded FACE AIDS
and I larris was president of Stanford Students
for Relief — the two new executives are deter
mined to make a difference in the big-picture

issues that they think resonate on campus and
are supremely confident they will be able to do
so.
Dorsey and Harris won this spring's execu
tive election largely on the strength of their
infectious enthusiasm and desire to take on
issues that student government does not often
tackle. Unlike traditional campaigns, the pair
assembled their agenda using broad brush
strokes. avoiding details because they planned
to work with legions of stakeholders and
experts to put together the specifics once in
office.

Now, after spending much of the summer
on campus, consulting with administrators and
student-group leaders, the executives are
bursting with specific initiatives that they are
excited about.
An initiative that will make the übiquitous
red party cups recyclable passed the Senate
last night. Voter registration efforts are taking
advantage of a wide variety of student groups,
which will make the drive more successful
than if the ASSU tried to eo it alone. A mental

health resource center will open by
the end of the quarter, and the ASSU
is working on graduate student and
residential assistant (RA) outreach
to make mental health a priority.
But even concrete initiatives that
will address some of Stanford's most
difficult issues are not enough to sat
isfy Dorsey and Harris. The pair's
ambition goes beyond just improv
ing the campus.
"One thing that is exciting for
me, in a nerdy way, about scale, is
that once we have [things like the
cup initiative] running here, we can
pick up the phone and call the stu
dent body president at Santa Clara,
and say, 'Hey guys, here's how we
attacked the situation about cups,
you should think about this,'"
Dorsey said.
The new executives have particu
larly ambitious proposals relating to
diversity and attracting seniors to
public service careers —an issue
Dorsey described as his "gnarliest
challenge."
Faced with daunting tasks,
Dorsey and Harris are turning to
out-of-the-box solutions for the
toughest challenges.
"For diversity, we are excited to
work with the student body and
administration to move to a more
interactive form of diversity," I larris
said. "We pursue diversity so strin
gently that I think we forget that the
reason we do that is so we can inter
act with people who are different,
and we want to encourage that."
Dorsey thought big when asked
about how he would make public
service a more attractive career
choice for Stanford students.
"We set a tone in the student body

when we ran by saying we are public
service guys, and we spent a lot of this
summer talking to trustees and
administrators about these issues, and
a lot of them are excited about this
too," he said. "I would like to see a
summit on this at Stanford, discussing
openly the fact that it's a sad thing
that many students come here want
ing to go into service and leave feeling
pigeonholed into other paths."
Rallying student support for the
duo's lofty initiatives will be difficult
if students are either unsure of what
the ASSU is or are not able to con
nect successful initiatives with the
student government.
To that end, Dorsey and Harris
are in the midst of creating a cam
pus-wide network of "dorm cap
tains," and are overhauling the
ASSIJ Web site to improve trans
parency and communication with
the student body.
Also difficult will be working
with the other branches of the
ASSU — the Graduate Student
Council and the Undergraduate
Senate. The Senate, in particular, has
been off to a rough start, clashing
with the executives last week over
funding for the ASSU welcome bar
becue during New Student
Orientation.
Working within the ASSU frame
work may present serious problems,
but based on the pair's early actions
and proposals, Dorsey and Harris
certainly will not be hindered by a
lack of enthusiasm.
When asked about how difficult
the job of vice president was. Harris
said he was running on four hours of
sleep. Dorsey considered himself
lucky to get two.
