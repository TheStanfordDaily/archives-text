# STUDENT GOV'T
## Senate visited by VPSA Greg Boardman 
### JENNY REMPEL 
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman addressed the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate last night about the need for transparency
and communication, among other topics.
Four of the five associate vice provosts from
the VPSA joined Boardman in sharing their
objectives for the year with the Senate. Along
with a focus on internal assessment and data uti
lization. the VPSA is working to prioritize mental
health and residential education.
TTiese goals were largely supported by the 14
Senators present at the meeting.
"It was fantastic to hear VPSA give us a gen
eral overview of their projects, because so much
of what the Senate does is to collaborate " said
Deputy Chair Shelley Gao '11. "They made it
very clear that they are here for the students, and
we really want to help in this process of commu
nicating."
Sally Dickson, associate VPSA and dean of
Educational Resource Centers, also seeks to
increase the interactions between students, sena-
tors and campus administrators.
"I'm hoping that this year there
will be more opportunities for us to
interact," Dickson said, "because
student affairs is about students."
Several senators questioned how
the VPSA is communicating with
and involving students.
Senator Luukas lives '09 was con
cerned that administrators often

obtain skewed views of student
opinion because they fail to survey
the entire campus when making
decisions. According to lives, this can
cause problems because decisions
are based off of a small group of stu
dents who often hold different opin
ions from the overall student body.
"One of our big goals this year is
to make sure that the administration
interacts and deliberates with the
student body as a whole instead of
individual students who don't
always agree with their classmates,"
lives said.
One of the areas in which the
VPSA is looking for more student
opinions is mental health. Vaden
Health Center and the ASSU are
both working to make mental health

one of their main priorities for the
school year.
"It is a continuous effort to main
tain access and quality," said Vaden
Director Ira Friedman. "We're get
ting busier and busier."
Chris Griffith, associate VPSA
and dean of students, spoke about
plans to build a "mellow room" in
Old Union. This room will feature
beanbag chairs, massage therapy,
health posters and student discus
sions in order to create a sense of
tranquility.
Griffith praised ASSU execu
tives Jonny Dorsey '09 and Fagan
Harris '09 for their enthusiasm on
the topic of mental health.
Harris was present at the meet
ing and brought up the topic of

financial aid on the Row as it per
tains to board bills. The ASSU is
working to reverse a current
University policy that does not
extend financial aid to cover board
for students without a Stanford
Dining plan.
Several senators were taken
aback that University officials had
not yet addressed this policy.
"If we do a full-court press on the
issue this year, it's something that
we should be able to accomplish,"
said lives, who is also student chair
of the Undergraduate Housing
Committee. "It certainly carries the
risk of stratifying the campus."
