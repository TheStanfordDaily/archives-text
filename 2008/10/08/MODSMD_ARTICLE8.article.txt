that helped doctors fight the deadly diseases.
French researchers Francoise Barre-Sinoussi and Luc

munodeficiency virus,or HlV.in 1983.
They shared the award with Germany's Harald zur
Hausen. who was honored for finding human papilloma

that he was disappointed at not being included in the

Pakistan to deport all Afghans from
tribal region
Pakistan ordered the deportation of about 50,000
Afghan refugees in an insurgency-wracked tribal region
amid a major military offensive against al-Qaida and Tal
iban fighters.
The government said it was expelling all Afghan
refugees in the Bajur tribal region, alleging many of them
have links to militant groups. Police in the town of Khar in
Bajur arrested 25 Afghans and said they would soon be
deported.
"The orders have been issued to the tribal police to
push all of them (refugees) out." said local government of
ficial Abdul Haseeb, adding that their homes would be
bulldozed to keep them from returning.
A government offensive in Bajur that began in early
August has claimed some 1,000 lives. It comes amid in
creased U.S. pressure on the government of President Asif
Ali Zardari to crackdown on militants in the restive bor
der region where al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden is be
lieved to be hiding.
Washington has long complained Pakistan is unwilling
or unable to take strong action against the extremists.
