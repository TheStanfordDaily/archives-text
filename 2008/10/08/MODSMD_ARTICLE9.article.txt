# Candidates spar over causes, cures for worst economic crisis in 80 years
## McCain, Obama debate economy 
### CHARLES BABINGTON THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Barack Obama and John McCain
clashed repeatedly over the causes and
cures for the worst economic crisis in 80
years Tuesday night in a debate in which
Republican McCain called for a sweeping
$3(X) billion program to shield homeown
ers from mortgage foreclosure.
"It's my proposal. It's not Sen.
Obama's proposal, it's not President
Bush's proposal." McCain said in the de
bate that he hoped could revive his for
tunes in a presidential race trending to
ward his rival.
In one pointed confrontation on for
eign policy, Obama bluntly challenged
McCain's steadiness. "This is a guy who
sang bomb, bomb, bomb Iran, who called
for the annihilation of North Korea —
that I don't think is an example of speak
ing softly."
That came after McCain accused him
of foolishly threatening to invade Pak
istan and said,"l'm not going to telegraph
my punches, which is what Sen. Obama
did."
The debate was the second of three be
tween the two major party rivals, and the
only one to feature a format in which vot
ers seated a few feet away posed ques
tions to the candidates.
They were polite, but the strain of the
campaign showed. At one point. McCain
referred to Obama as "that one," rather
than speaking his name.
"It's good to be with you at a town hall
meeting," McCain also jabbed at his rival,
who has spurned the Republican's calls
for numerous such joint appearances
across the fall campaign.
They debated on a stage at Belmont
University four weeks before Election
Day in a race that has lately favored
Obama, both in national polls and in sur
veys in pivotal battleground states.
Not surprisingly, many of the questions

dealt with an economy in trouble.
Obama said the current crisis was the
"final verdict on the failed economic poli
cies of the last eight years" that President
Bush pursued and were "supported by
Sen. McCain."
I le contended that Bush. McCain and

others had favored deregulation of the fi
nancial industry, predicting that would
"let markets run wild and prosperity
would rain down on all of us. It didn't hap
pen."
McCain's pledge to have the govern
ment help individual homeowners avoid

foreclosure went beyond the details of the
bailout that recently cleared Congress.
The legislation allows hut does not re
quire Treasury to purchase mortgages di
rectly. Obama has said previously that
idea should be studied, and his campaign
contended McCain's proposal was not a
new one.
McCain's campaign issued a written
statement that said the $300 billion cost of
his initiative would be paid out of the $700
billion approved late last week.
"I would order the secretary of the
Treasury to immediately buy up the bad
home loan mortgages in America and
renegotiate at the new value of those
homes, at the diminished value of those
homes, and let people be able to make
those payments and stay in their homes."
he said.
"Is it expensive? Yes. But we all know,
my friends, until we stabilize home values
in America, we're never going to start turn
ing around and creating jobs and fixing our
economy, and we've got to get some trust
and confidence back to America."
McCain also said it was important to
reform the giant benefit programs such as
Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.
"My friends, we are not going to be
able to provide the same benefit for pres
ent day workers that present-day retirees
have today." he said, although he did not
elaborate.
The two men also competed to demon
strate their qualifications as reformers at
a time voters are clamoring for change.
McCain accused Obama of being the
Senate's second-highest recipient of do
nations from individuals at Fannie Mae
and Freddie Mac, the two now-disgraced
mortgage industry giants.
"There were some of us who stood up
against it." McCain said of the lead-up to
the financial crisis. "There were others
who took a hike."
