## Defining our generation 
### 
During Tuesday night's presidential
debate, moderator Tom Brokaw
asked a question sent in by a 78-
year-old woman named Fiora — a mem
ber of what Brokaw famously labeled the
"Greatest Generation." Appropriately,
Fiora's question reflected Brokaw's reoc
curring theme that our grandparents' lives
were defined by sacrifice, duty and honor.
"Since World War 11, we have never
been asked to sacrifice anything to help
our country, except the blood of our hero
ic men and women," Fiora wrote. "As pres
ident, what sacrifices . . . will you ask
every American to make to help restore
the American dream and to get out of the
economic morass that we're now in?"
The question, though crotchety and
pessimistic, touches on something true
about my generation: We're unmoored by
any larger sense of duty and sacrifice. So
far. our most earnest pursuits have been
resume building and finding the next big
commercial idea. (In a 2007 Pew Research
Poll, 81 percent of 18- to 25-year-olds said
their goal in life "was to get rich.") But we
have never seriously been called on to do
anything for the common good, unless you
count President Bush's plea to go shop
ping back in 2006. In that case, mission ac
complished.
Historically, this makes sense. For
Americans born since 1980, we grew up in
a breathtakingly affluent and powerful
America — the richest and arguably most
powerful nation ever. In 1980 the U.S.
GDP was $2,784 trillion; in 2007. the U.S.
GDP was $13,543 trillion. In 1980, the
Dow Jones Industrial Average was just
under the 1.000 mark; by 2007. it was over
10,000.
Is it any surprise, then, we grew up fo
cused on new technology, success and our
selves?
Lacking our own larger purpose, older
generations have projected purposes onto
us. Some conservatives, for example, des
perately want our generation to be de
fined by conflict. They believe that the War
on Terror is both an epic struggle like

World War II and a generational or multi
generational conflict like the Cold War. In
deed, as late as 2007. conservatives like
William Kristol and Dean Barnett have la
belled us the "9/11 Generation."
And the "9/11 Generation" idea is not
just popular among some conservatives,
though it has been fading recently.
Newsweek wrote in November 2001 that
"the generation that once had it all —
peace, prosperity, even the dot-com dream
of retiring at 30 — faces its defining mo
ment."
More recently, USA Today reported on
researcn investigating whether we view
9/11 as a defining moment in the same way
as our grandparents viewed Pearl Harbor.
Certainly our world was shaped by 9/11 —
but our generation was not.
We are, therefore, not the "9/11 Gener
ation."The War on Terror is too broad, too
vague and seemingly too distant to define
us. Moreover, the waging of the War on
Terror is confined to too small a segment
of society.
As Fiora's question pointed out, our
"heroic military men and women" have
been the only ones shouldering any seri
ous sacrifice recently. This uneven distri
bution of sacrifice is an important factor in
the Republican Party's hardline desire to
"support the troops."
These days, the military forms a very
narrow segment of society — too narrow
to use its sacrifices to define the entire gen
eration of young Americans. As History
Prof. David Kennedy once pointed out to
me, our modern military is only about four
percent of the GDP compared to a stagger-


Paul
Craft
ing 40 percent during World War 11.
Combine that with the lack of a
draft, and the War on Terror is a
recipe for generational apathy. In
short, for a struggle that is touted
as fundamental to the very survival
of our nation, very little of our na
tion is actually involved in it.
This, of course, is not to deny the
immediacy and importance of the

threat of terrorism that my genera
tion faces in the long-term. An un
friendly non-state actor with
weapons of mass destruction is
America's greatest long-term
threat. But the nature of this threat
defies comparison to World War 11,
where clear sides were drawn, mil
itary battles carried the day and
domestic economic strength un
derpinned everything. We cannot
he asked to make the same sacri
fices as our grandparents — ra
tioning. mass military enlistment
and more — because we are facing
a different world.
Hopefully our generation will
find a way to live out the "Greatest
Generation's" values of duty, honor
and sacrifice. To be sure, many al
ready live out these values every
day, on and off campus. But Fiora is
right: Only a few heroes amongst us
have answered the call to sacrifice.
Rest assured, though, our genera
tion will be ready when we all final
ly have a reason to do so.
