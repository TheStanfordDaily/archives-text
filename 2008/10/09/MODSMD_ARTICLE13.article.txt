If John Lennon were around today, he
would have a solution for the financial cri
sis. "Abandon your bailout plan." he
would plead to Treasury Secretary Paulson.
"Forget emergency interest rate cuts" he
would beseech of Federal Reserve Chairman
Bernanke. "All you need is love," he would
proclaim. "Love, love, love."
As complex and confounded as the Trea
sury bailout plan appears to be. it pales in
comparison to love. Who really understands
love? Philosophers have propounded theo
ries. Poets have composed verse. Biologists
have identified hormones and pheromones.
Yet they all remain far from the answer.
The economist, on the other hand, has all
the answers. When faced with unanswerable
questions, it takes an economist's incentive
driven mind to come up with an acceptable
solution. So how would an economist ap
proach the incomprehensible matter of love?
Well, for starters, love can be put into
terms an economist can understand. The
American love market, that of dating, is char
acterized by anxiety and horror stories, but
also by reservation prices and search costs.
Finding a partner bears a striking resem
blance to shopping for a plane ticket.
First, an individual sets their reservation
price. ITiis is the absolute minimum they
would be willing to accept in their potential
partner. The reservation price is set based on
an individual's preferences, their "standards"
so to speak.
Those with so-called "high standards"
have high reservation prices and typically
have to search more than those with "low
standards." That is why your friends with
"high standards" are often not dating anyone
while your friends with "low standards" arc
dating three people at the same time.
Once the reservation price is established.

"Forget emergency
interest cuts...
all you need is love."

participants in the market for love have to
incur search costs. The idea is that dating is
the process by which you eventually find love
and live happily ever after.
As you search for love.you incur the costs
associated with dating and. more important
ly. failed dates. There are the obvious mone
tary costs, like that all-too-fancy dinner for a
girl who wasn't worth it.that limo you rented
when the subway would have sufficed or that
lavish gift you gave her that you're now not
getting back — economists call that one a
sunk cost.
Then there are non-monetary costs. Get
ting over the heartache of a break up. the

memories you shared, the plans you made to
gether— how can you put a price on that?
Think of the hours of productivity that the
global economy has lost to men and women
lying in hed, claiming they will never love
again. Forget interest rate cuts — we should
he handing out copies of "Blood on the
Tracks" to boost the economy.
The search for love is not just about costs,
though.There are many, many benefits — far
too many to discuss, so they are left to the
reader's hopefully vivid imagination (see
your PHE if you are unsure).
The economic formula for love is quite
simple. People set their reservation price and
then enter the market,searching for that spe
cial someone, incurring costs and accruing
benefits all the while. Depending on the level
of the reservation price, and the respective
costs and benefits, an equilibrium is estab
lished.
That equilibrium is reached at 27 years of
age and three partners,on average, according
to the Michigan Institute for Social Re
search. Now. if you have a high reservation
price because you are picky, high search costs
because you are demanding and low benefits
because you never have time, then your equi
librium will be reached at ;i later age and w nli
fewer partners. Think over-achieving Stan
ford students.
If John Lennon were around today, he
would not approve of this capitalistic por
trayal of love. "Reservation prices, search
costs, equilibrium," he would exclaim in a
panic. "Love is all you need," he would de
clare. And maybe a girl with kaleidoscope
eyes.
