## Three U.S.-based scientists share Nobel Chemistry Prize 
### THOMAS H. MAUGH II LOS ANGELES TIMES 
A pharmacologist from the Uni
versity of California, San Diego, and
two other U.S.-based scientists won
the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry
on Wednesday for their develop
ment of a green fluorescent protein
from jellyfish that has provided re
searchers their first new window
into the workings of the cell since
the development of the microscope.
Roger Y. Tsien, 56, of UC San
Diego, Martin Chalfie, 61, of Colum
bia University, and Osamu Shimo
mura, 80, a Japanese-born re
searcher who works at the Marine
Biological Laboratory in Woods
Hole, Mass., will share the $1.4 mil
lion prize for developing the protein
that the Nobel committee called "a
guiding star for biochemists, biolo
gists, medical scientists and other re
searchers."
The protein can be attached to
any of the 10,000 individual mole
cules within a living cell, allowing re
searchers for the first time to trace
their paths as they wind through the
complex pathways of life.
It is "an essential piece of the sci
entific toolbox," said Jeremy M.
Berg, director of the National Insti
tute of General Medical Sciences,
which has funded work by all three of
the prize winners. "It is impossible to
overstate the impact of these investi
gators' work on scientific progress."
In a hastily arranged news con
ference Wednesday morning, Chal
lie said he had slept through early
morning phone calls from Sweden
and did not know about the prize
until he woke up and checked his
laptop.
"It's not something out of the
blue, but you never know when it's
going to come or if it's going to
come, so it's always a big surprise
when it actually happens," he said.
Shimomura told the Japanese
broadcaster NHK that he was sur
prised to receive the chemistry

Nobel "because I was rumored as a
potential candidate for the Nobel
Prize in physiology or medicine."
In a telephone news conference.
Tsien said he felt "a bit like a deer
caught in the headlights. ... Funda
mentally. I'm no smarter today than
I was yesterday."
The story of the fluorescent pro
tein starts with Shimomura. In 1953,
he was hired as an assistant in the
Nagoya University laboratory of bi
ologist Yashimasa Hirata, who as
signed him to discover what made
the remains of a crushed mollusk
glow when moistened with sea water.
Hirata had considered the proj
ect so difficult that he would not as
sign it to a graduate student for fear
that its failure would prevent the
student from receiving his degree.
But within three years. Shimomura
had isolated the protein.
When Shimomura was later re
cruited to join Frank Johnson at
Princeton University. Hirata
arranged for Nagoya to award him
his doctorate, even though he was
not enrolled as a student.
In summer 1961. Shimomura and
Johnson began collecting biolumi
nescent jellyfish in Friday Harbor in
the San Juan Islands of Washington
state,returning to Princeton with ex
tracts from 10,000 of them.
From this material, they isolated
a blue luminescent protein called ae
quorin and a green fluorescent pro
tein. commonly called GFP In sub
sequent studies. Shimomura found
that GFP absorbed ultraviolet light
and emitted a green glow. What was
revolutionary about the protein was
that — unlike, for example, the light
envtting chemicals in the firefly — it
did not require the addition of any
chemical additives.
In 1988.Chalfie heard about GFP
and thought it would be useful for
tracing the fate of proteins in the
roundworm. Caenorhabditis ele
gans. which is widely used in biologi
cal studies because it is transparent,
allowing researchers to studv its or

gans under a microscope.
When Douglas Prasher of the
Woods Hole Oceanographic Institu
tion isolated the gene for GFP.Chal
fie assigned graduate student Ghia
Euskirchen to insert the gene into
the bacterium Escherichia coli.
Within a month, she had produced a
bacterium that glowed green.
Next. Chalfie attached the gene
to receptors in C. elegans that are in
volved in the sensation of touch. The
cover of the journal Science in Feb
ruary 1994 showed a picture of the
organism with the touch neurons
glowing bright green.
Tsien, who won the prestigious
Westinghouse Science Talent Search
at age 16 for a project that examined
how metals bind to organic com
pounds. also received a copy of the
gene from Prasher. He intended to
use it as a marker as well, he said, but
Chalfie beat him into print.
His work with colleague Susan
Taylor required markers with two
different colors, so he studied the
color-producing part of GFP and de
vised ways to alter its gene to pro
duce variants that glowed cyan, blue
and yellow. Eventually, he and other
researchers produced a family of
proteins that glowed in a whole
spectrum of colors, allowing re
searchers to follow the path of sever
al different proteins simultaneously.
Tsien is careful to note that he did
not discover GFP or use it to make
any groundbreaking biological dis
coveries. "I'm the guy who makes
the tools." he said.
One memorable experiment with
the new technology tagged mouse
brain proteins yellow, cyan and red.
producing a mouse whose brain
glowed in the colors of a rainbow —
a "brainbow." as it was tagged.
Researchers subsequently have
adapted the technology so that mi
croorganisms will glow in the pres
ence of heavy metals, explosives
such as TNT and other chemicals, al
lowing the microorganisms to be
used as sensors.
