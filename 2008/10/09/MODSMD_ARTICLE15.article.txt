## Golf starts off season Women's team competes in first tournament at Mason Rudolph 
### STEPHEN ADAMSON 
The Stanford women's golf team
came into the highly competitive
Mason Rudolph Women's Champi
onship (Sept. 26-28) expecting a
challenge, and they certainly got one.
The field, hosted by Vanderbilt Uni
versity. included 14 top 25-ranked
programs, including No. 1 USC, No. 2
UCLA. No. 3 Duke and No. 4 Ari
zona State.
The No. 20 Cardinal finished in
15th place with a three-day total of
43 over par (907). UCLA put togeth
er a three-day total of 14 under par
(850). which was enough to give
them the tournament title. Junior
Sydnee Michaels led the Bruins with
a five-under-par 67 on Sunday for a
three-day total of 11 under par (205)
on her way to winning first place in
dividually.
"Obviously we were disappoint
ed with our finish relative to the
field." Stanford head coach Caroline
O'Connor said. "However, our final
two rounds were pretty solid."
The team certainly made up for a
rough first round in which they com
bined for a score of 25 over par (313)
by finishing strong with two rounds
in which they scored nine over par
(297).
Freshman sensation Sydney
Burlison was the Cardinal's overall
leader, tying for 21 st overall. Burlison
shot a one-over-par final round on
Sunday to finish with a score of 221.
O'Connor has been impressed with
the team's two freshmen thus far.
"Sydney [Burlison] and Lila
[Barton] have competed all over the
world, seen all the different types of
golf courses." O'Connor said.
"They'll be able to draw from their
national and international experi-

ences to help us succeed at this
level."
All this talk about freshmen
bodes well for the future of the Car
dinal women, with one of the team's
strengths being the experience it
brings to the table.
Co-captain senior Mari Chun's
three-day total was 13 over par
(229). which tied her for 56th, indi
vidually. She picked her play up over
time, though, sinking five birdies in
the final round on Sunday.
"Mari and [senior] KiShui [Liaoj
were elected team captains by their
teammates," O'Connor said. "They
obviously bring a lot to the table in
terms of experience on and off the
golf course."
Also competing for the team was
sophomore Rebecca Durham, who
contributed a 17-over-par score of
233 to tie for 70th overall.
'The team was able to take a trip
to Scotland over the summer, which

gave them the opportunity to come
together as a unit and exposed them
to different conditions and terrain
than they were used to.The Cardinal
men's basketball team took a similar
trip to Spain before their previous
season and that international expe
rience seemed to be beneficial as the
team advanced to the Sweet 16.
Coach O'Connor is looking for sim
ilar positive results after the summer
in Scotland.
"It was a wonderful team bond
ing experience for everyone," she
said. "More importantly, it was a
great learning experience. We
played in some adverse conditions
and they had to really learn how to
manage the strong winds and driving
rain, hitting shots that we wouldn't
typically hit in the States. We've al
ready noticed that they're incorpo
rating some of the new shots into
their games."
It is still early in the season and
there is certainly time to improve.
Consistency seems to be the team's
main concern at this juncture, espe
cially throughout the entirety of the
team's line-up.
"There is absolutely more com
petition for spots in the line-up,"
O'Connor said. "That healthy com
petition will only make us stronger.
"Our short game needs to im
prove," she added."Ball striking was
pretty good at Vanderbilt. but we
didn't capitalize by converting many
birdie putts or getting up and down
for par a majority of the time."
Next up for the team is a trip to
the Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational in
Sammamish. Wash., where they will
hope for a better result.
