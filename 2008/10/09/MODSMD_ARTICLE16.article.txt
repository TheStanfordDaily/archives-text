# John Moore: Shot stopper
## 
### BY JACOB JOHNSON DESK EDITOR 
Junior John Moore has been hon
ing his goalkeeper skills from a
young age — a very, very young
age. "Mv older brother Jack used
to kick balls at me in the back
yard." Moore said. "He was probably just
trying to hit me. I used to put my hands up
to stop from getting hit in the face."
Whether he meant to or not. Jack was
actually doing his little brother a favor.
John Moore has perfected the art of
knocking down balls — even though his
opponents no longer try to kick them
right at him. Now in his second year as the
starting keeper for the Stanford men's
soccer team, he has quickly become one
of the best goalies in the nation.
Moore grew up in Chino Hills, Calif., a
town he describes as a "kind of cliche sub
urb" just outside of Los Angeles. He was
a very active kid. and began channeling
his energy into sports from an early age.
Youth soccer games, little league base

ball, playground basketball and even
football — the American kind — took
up most of Moore's time. A few years
later, he began to focus on soccer.
"When I was 11 or 12,1 started playing
competitively." Moore said. He joined a
local club team and played with the same
squad until he entered Stanford in the fall
of 2006. Though it is unusual for players
to be on the same team for so long. Moore
stuck around through the good times and
the bad. However, it was one particularly
"bad time" that helped make him the
standout he is today.
"[My club team] had a number of dif
ferent coaches over the years," he said.
"One of them said to my face.'As long as
you're on this team, you'll never play'...
I wasn't a good enough goalie."
It was the kind of demoralizing state
ment that would have sent most 12-year
olds running home to mom,asking to quit
the team.
Moore reacted differently. It lit a fire
in him.
"He brought in [another] goalie and I
beat him out," he said.

Moore worked harder than his com
petition, and his natural talent started to
emerge. But the coach wasn't convinced,
so he brought in yet another keeper to be
the starter. Moore worked harder and
beat him out too. Still convinced that he
wasn't starting material, the coach
brought in still another boy to take over
the job. You can guess what happened
next.
Yet when he got to high school, Moore
didn't even play goalie.
"I played the field in high school be
cause my team wasn't competitive and
we needed our best athletes out there,"
he said. Moore played sweeper, although
he admits he was a little lost at times.
"I didn't know what I was doing, but it
was I'un running around," he said.smiling.
Although he got good grades, school
was never Moore's top priority.
"You could never find me with a book
if there was something to do outside," he
said.
Moore's family was very supportive in
his athletic endeavors. His parents

see the team

more than 20 years and now spend their
time traveling the country in a small RV
trusted him to get his schoolwork
done.
"I did the whole AP, honors thing,"
Moore said. "School came pretty easy, it
seemed to all click."
And it was in one of those AP classes
that he first thought about coming to
Stanford. When his freshman English
teacher asked him what he wanted to do
in college,he replied that he would like to
play soccer for Stanford. The teacher
then asked him if he thought he could re
ally play for the Cardinal, and Moore
started questioning himself. Put after
some thought, he came up with an an
swer: "Yes."
University classes were a challenge for
Moore at first, but he quickly adjusted to
Stanford's high academic standards. His
troubles were perhaps exacerbated by
some questionable advice from one of his
teammates.
"One of the seniors told me 'Yeah,
take Math 51 in the fall, it's easy,"' said
Moore, who took the advice and soon
found out that Stanford math classes take
a little more work than high school calcu
lus.
"I wanted to shoot myself," he said.
After developing the "proper study
habits and time management skills" he
lacked in high school, Moore found it
easy to stay up on his work. He has also
discovered how rewarding school can be
at Stanford.
"You get out what you put in." he said.
"I spend a lot of time on my schoolwork,
and I get a lot out."
Moore's transition onto the college
soccer field came much easier than his
transition to the classroom. Much of his
success is due to the work ethic he devel
oped as a young goalie trying to prove his
coach wrong.
"I knew the college game was going to
