# Winter is coming, so is hockey
## 
### 
This is my favorite time of year.
Major League Baseball is in
the midst of its playoffs, the
wind is becoming cool and crisp, and
the trees are turning red. yellow and
gold. The first frost, snowfall and ice
on the lakes isn't that far away Be
fore we know it. it'll be time to break
out the toboggan (California transla
tion: a sled), build a snow fort and go
for a sleigh ride behind a pair of rein
deer.
Oh, wait. That was the Min
nesotan in me talking. None of these
things — except for playoff baseball
happen in the bi-seasonal (wet or
wildfires) land that is Stanford. I will
have to wait until 1 go back to the
North Star State for Christmas to ex
perience the joy of winter, where
they really do give reindeer sleigh
rides on the street in my neighbor
hood.
But there is one touch of the ap
proaching winter — which you are
probably completely unaware of as
you walk through the Quad, under a
blue sky, in 80-degree weather —
that is present even here on the Farm.
And what is that?
You betcha, it's hockey.
Yes. the Boys of Winter are back.
The Stanford club hockey team
began its season a few weeks ago and
the National Hockey League got un
derway in Europe with a handful of
games last weekend. Division I colle
giate ice hockey started practice a
few days ago and the San Jose Sharks
return to the lank to open their reg
ular season tomorrow.
Uff-da! There is almost more
puck than I know what to do with.
I'm not going to talk about the
Sharks. But don't worry California
hockey fans: I 'm not going to go on a
Minnesota-hockey elitist rant either.
No, I'm going to resist my urges to
talk up the Golden Gophers' su
premacy over those despicable l ight
ing Sioux from North Dakota.
Instead I am going to look nt the
new coach of the rebuilt Tampa Bay
Lightning, Barry Melrose, who you
may remember as ESPN's hockey


Erik
Adams
analyst the last several seasons. You
may remember he was the only guy
on Sports Center with a mullet.
Tampa Bay is under new owner
ship and spent loads trying to return
the team to its Stanley Cup glory
from before the 2004-05 NHL lock
out. Melrose was one of the more
high-profile signings, as he left the
TV studio to return to a spot behind
the bench as a coach for the first time
in 13 years.
Last weekend.after the Lightning
lost their first two games of the regu
lar season, both to the New York
Rangers, Melrose absolutely tore
into his team, sounding remarkably
like he was still in the ESPN studio
breaking down the team's effort.
"We don't compete, we're too
easy to play against," he told re
porters following the second loss.
"We have a lot of skill on our team,
but that means nothing if you don't
work hard."

He went on to single out many
players and openly criticize their
performance. The only good things
he had to say were about the fourth
line, which he called "the lowest-paid
line we've got on the ice, but by far
the best."
Dividing the team and calling out
most of his players in front of the
media is probably not the best way to
coach a winning team in any sport.
His return to the bench may be
short-lived if he continues to throw
his players under the bus. But. as a
fan, isn't it nice to see a sports figure
completely abandoning the stan
dard, cliched comments?
Tirades happen from time to time
and coaches don't always protect
their players — not that long ago we
saw Ozzie Guillen refer to Javier
Vazquez as "not a big-game pitcher"
before a huge game. But to see a
coach calmly listing the faults of each
player as if it was everyday, press
conference protocol is something
rare.
Melrose is publicly holding a
group of athletes — most of whom
make over one million dollars a year
— to the expectation that they give

110 percent at all times. Sure it is only
two games into an 82 game season,
hut isn't it satisfying to see people
who make more money than most of
us can dream of criticized for lack
luster effort? Imagine how this base
ball season would have been differ
ent if Manny Ramirez were forced to
respect his contract.
Considering the reality of how
modern sports function and the
power athletes have, this is not a
good way to run a professional
sports team. If you are a Lightning
fan, you should be very concerned.
For everyone else, enjoy Mel
rose's style and willingness to pub
licly demand dedication from his
athletes while you can. If it doesn't
work, he may not be coaching much
longer.
And, if you want to know what a
real Minnesota winter is like, come
visit me during the holiday break. I'll
save vou a reindeer.

Erik Adams is fearlessly freezing new
ground in his column, paving the way
for hockey fever in the California sun.
