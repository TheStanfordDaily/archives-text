# Winter is coming, so is hockey
## 
### 
This is my favorite time of year.
Major League Baseball is in
the midst of its playoffs, the
wind is becoming cool and crisp, and
the trees are turning red. yellow and
gold. The first frost, snowfall and ice
on the lakes isn't that far away Be
fore we know it. it'll be time to break
out the toboggan (California transla
tion: a sled), build a snow fort and go
for a sleigh ride behind a pair of rein
deer.
Oh, wait. That was the Min
nesotan in me talking. None of these
things — except for playoff baseball
happen in the bi-seasonal (wet or
wildfires) land that is Stanford. I will
have to wait until 1 go back to the
North Star State for Christmas to ex
perience the joy of winter, where
they really do give reindeer sleigh
rides on the street in my neighbor
hood.
But there is one touch of the ap
proaching winter — which you are
probably completely unaware of as
you walk through the Quad, under a
blue sky, in 80-degree weather —
that is present even here on the Farm.
And what is that?
You betcha, it's hockey.
Yes. the Boys of Winter are back.
The Stanford club hockey team
began its season a few weeks ago and
the National Hockey League got un
derway in Europe with a handful of
games last weekend. Division I colle
giate ice hockey started practice a
few days ago and the San Jose Sharks
return to the lank to open their reg
ular season tomorrow.
Uff-da! There is almost more
puck than I know what to do with.
I'm not going to talk about the
Sharks. But don't worry California
hockey fans: I 'm not going to go on a
Minnesota-hockey elitist rant either.
No, I'm going to resist my urges to
talk up the Golden Gophers' su
premacy over those despicable l ight
ing Sioux from North Dakota.
Instead I am going to look nt the
new coach of the rebuilt Tampa Bay
Lightning, Barry Melrose, who you
may remember as ESPN's hockey
