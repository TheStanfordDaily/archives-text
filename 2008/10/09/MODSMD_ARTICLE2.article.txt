### DEVIN BANERJEE MANAGING EDITOR 
ITiis past weekend, at least IK stu
dents were victims of theft of personal
property totaling almost $30,000.
according to a joint email sent to stu
dents by Vice Provost for Student
Affairs Greg Boardman and Chief of
Police Laura Wilson. Police believe three
male students are responsible.
"In virtually every case, unknown
persons entered students' rooms
through unlocked doors," the email
read. "The incidents occurred during
parties, house meetings and while many
students were in and around the resi
dence."
The weekend thefts are only the lat
est in a string of burglaries that have
struck residences on East Campus and
the Row since students arrived on cam
pus last month. According to Bill
Larson, crime prevention and risk man
agement coordinator for the
Department of Public Safety, 13 inci
dences were reported between Sept. 15
and Oct. 1. eight of which occurred on
the Row.
Deputy Sheriff Ken Bates said the
public safety department will not be

increasing the size of its force due to
statewide staffing delays, but did note
that an additional sheriff vehicle now
patrols campus on Friday and Saturday
nights.
"The additional vehicle assists the
community with issues that could arise,
from overcrowding at a party to local
juveniles who are trying to get into par
ties." Bates said. "It also just serves as a
presence."
Public Safety officials have also
ramped up their community outreach
efforts, both to educate students about
theft protection and to eliminate what
Bates calls a perceived "us versus them"
mentality. Upon request, sheriffs will
attend a meal at a house or dorm to dis
cuss safety issues with residences.
"We're getting a more personal one
on-one with the students." Bates said.
"We've always tried to show to the com
munity that we're a member to this com
munity and the community means some
thing to us."
1 lousing staff are also taking steps to
protect themselves and their residences.
Nick Streets '09. a Kappa Sig residential
assistant (RA).said his fraternity tried to
implement door security but faced too
large a volume of partygoers.

"We have security guards and con
struction tape, but at one point we had
like 15 people rush in past security," he
said. "What can you do in a situation like
that?"
Still. Streets emphasized the impor
tance of reporting suspicious activity
quickly.
"A thief can be in and out of a dorm
and off campus in about five minutes."
he said. "And if it takes that long for
someone to report a theft, the criminal's
gone."
According to the email from
Boardman and Wilson, "in virtually
every case, unknown persons entered
students' rooms through unlocked
doors." Bates warned students about
their door locks and gave one simple line
of advice: lock your doors. He also
advised students to write down the serial
numbers of their electronic property.
Teresa Molina "09, Phi Sig's kitchen
manager, filed a police report after her
laptop was stolen from her unlocked
room on the night of Sept. 26. Since then.
Molina has taken steps to prevent a
repeat theft.
"I keep my door locked now." she
said, "and I'm going to get a laptop lock
as soon as I get a laptop."

In addition to campus thefts, police
are investigating a case of repeated tres
passing by Ryan Cook, a supposed 2008
graduate. According to Cook's
Facebook profile, he is 28 years old.
"The Stanford Police has had previ
ous contacts with Mr. Cook for [trespass
ing] incidents," said Sergeant Rick
Rondeau in an email that has circulated
Row house email lists. "Please call the
Stanford Police ASAP in the future if
you need to have Mr. Cook removed
from the building."
Regarding both potential thieves and
trespassers. Bates said much of the
responsibility lies with students.
"The onus is actually on the students
to make sure that we get called immedi
ately when someone is traveling through
a hallway or trying doorknobs." he said.
"Or carrying laptops out of a room."
Last week, the Department of Public
Safety released its annual Safety and
Security Report. According to the
report. 2007 saw 63 non-vehicle burgla
ries in dorms, up from 48 in 2(K)6.
