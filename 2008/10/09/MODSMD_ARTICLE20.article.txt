# Sage Wright:
## Pool shark 
### BY CLAUDIA PRECIADO 
Junior Sage Wright is your man when it comes to
titles. Wright was more than just Stanford water
polo's breakout athlete last season, when he
notched 33 goals in his first year of action with
the Cardinal. His sensational efforts also landed
him a spot on the Association of Collegiate Water Polo
Coaches (ACWPC) All-America First Team. All
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) First
Team. ACWPC Academic All-American team and
MPSF All-Academic Team.
Yet, Wright's emergence was different. Most ath
letes with stellar careers such as Wright's gradually
make a splash onto the scene or immediately stake a
claim to being one of the nation's elite athletes.
Wright, though, battled it out in the practice pool his
entire freshmen year, never making an impact on the
intercollegiate competitive level until last year.
"The transition to my sophomore year was not as
rocky as one might think because we get to play water
polo in the summer," Wright said of his transition
from the sidelines to the pool. "It was during this time
that I got to feel comfortable in the position 1 am
[in]."
Never having to claim redshirt status as a fresh
man. Wright treaded his way to the top spot on the
team through the course of the year. Rather than feel
ing discouraged from riding the bench, Wright trans
ferred this energy into an astonishing vitality to perfect
his game.
"One of my traits is my competitiveness," he said.
"It's a blessing and a curse. But. I think that it has driv
en me to work as hard as I have to get to the places I
have."
For athletes, that quality is often referred to as a
strong desire to succeed.
If the measure of Wright's success includes being
among the nation's best, if it includes hard work, if it in
cludes being the go-to guy when his team is in a jam.
then he clearly embodies that persona.
But what thrusts Wright into the compelling cycle of
water polo?
"The ball and cage that comes with it."he answered,
simply.
To jump in the pool every day and exert the same
amount of energy and effort requires a particular
mindset.
"My thought process is usually the same no matter
my position on the team: play hard, play smart." he
said.
Wright works hard to maintain a familial brother
hood with his fellow teammates, describing the Cardi
nal as "great, not good."

"Coach [Vargas] likes to use the expression 'good,
not great' like 'That practice was good, not great/" he
continued. "[But] I think we have a great team all
around. We all play supportive roles in each other's
lives. If anyone is having a good game or great practice,
we tell him. If someone is not having the game of [his]
life, we still support him. This carries over outside the

"I want to be remembered as a guy someboy could
always count on — both in and out of the pool."

pool where we all are friends."
Being the rock of the team is just one of Wright's
many roles. When the team is in a frenzy. Wright looks
to be the calm center of the storm. His status as a cap
tain among his fellow teammates makes it his respon
sibility to help lead them toward their goals.
"It's great that we have so many different personal

ities on the team," he said. "You might think this would
lead to conflict, but when we get together everyone
seems to enjoy each other. We all find our spots both in
and out of the pool to have a good time and to be suc
cessful."
Wright's calm demeanor and ability to block the
outside world may be the reason his friends called him
"no fun" in high school. But this "no fun" aspect ot
Wright keeps him focused on the task at hand.
"The most important goal right now is winning a na
tional championship," he said. "After that... well,
that's a ways off."
Because the NCAA Championships are held in
Stanford's Avery Aquatic Center this year, a champi
onship berth would be an even sweeter accomplish
ment for 2008.
"I'm looking forward to the [MPSF] tournament
for two reasons," Wright said. "One: It will decide who
goes on to NCAAs — which would then be the thing
I look forward to most.Two: the tournament is hosted
the weekend after Thanksgiving Thursday, on which
the team has the most delicious dinner."
And, of course, a repeat win over No. 5 Cal would
definitely make the season's list of highlights.
Aiding the Cardinal men in their pursuit are the
talents that make them unique, including their speed,
which is a skill Wright is particularly familiar with.
"Because I'm not the biggest guy in the pool. I
have to be quick," he said. "I try to anticipate the
movement of the ball and beat the other players to the
spot."
Improvement is essential in Wright's game, as in any
other athlete's game. But. what makes Wright stand
out is his dedication toward these skills. Every time he
comes out of practice, one of the facets of his game is
that much better.
"As in most things, the more you do something, the
more you learn about it,"he said. "Over the past cou
ple of years, I have learned little tricks and helpful
knowledge that [allow] me [to] play at this level."
"If I had to be specific about my areas to improve. I
would say that I need to work on my shooting." he con
tinued. "But, I think that every level of my game still
needs improvement. It'll take practice, practice, prac
tice."
With two more seasons ahead of him. Wright has
the opportunity to become one of Stanford's legendary
athletes. But instead of leaving behind titles or gold
medals, his idea of legacy differs from others.
"I want to be remembered as a guy somebody could
always count on — both in and out of the pool," he
said.
Is Sage just an average player? Wright? Wrong.
