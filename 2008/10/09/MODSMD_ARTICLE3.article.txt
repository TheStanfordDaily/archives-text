# STUDENT LIFE
## IHUM course list changed, enlarged again Faculty availability affects IHUM courses 
### HAI-Y LE 
The Introduction to the Humanities
(IHUM) course sequence for most
Stanford freshmen has undergone changes
almost every year, and this year is no
exception.
Two courses in total from last year's
curriculum were dropped and five new
courses have been introduced, upping the
nine combined autumn and winter/spring

IHUM course options from last year to 12
this year. The Art of Living was dropped
from last year's autumn-quarter sequence
while Philosophy: Fate of Reason was
dropped from the winter-quarter
sequence.
IHUM Director Russell Berman sees
the importance of innovating IHUM
through the years.
"The IHUM curriculum undergoes
constant renewal." Berman said in an
email to The Daily. "Because faculty have
many commitments, they may teach in
IHUM for a few years before going on to
other teaching projects, and new faculty
come on board with innovative approach

es and topics."
Berman himself is co-teaching a new
course, "Laws and Orders," with Prof.
Helen Stacey from the Stanford Law
School. The course will examine the con
flict between the normative universality of
laws and cultural differences.
Prof. Chris Bobinich, who taught
Visions of Mortality last year, is returning
to IHUM hut teaching a new course enti
tled Truth and Morality: One, Many or
None. Prof. Gabriella Safran, who also
taught Visions of Mortality last year, is on
leave this school year. It is not vet certain
whether the course will return.
"It is normal for a course to be discon

tinued because faculty have other obliga
tions or go iin research leave," Berman
said. "New courses are introduced that will
offer first-year students exciting avenues
into the complexities of interpretation."
ITie three new winter/spring IHUM
courses will be Asian Languages:
Rebellious Daughters and Filial Sons.
History: Making of the Modern World,
and Philosophy: Humanistic Perspectives
on Science.
A popular IHUM last year that has dis
appeared for the time being is Sex: Its
Pleasures and Cultures, taught by Prof.
Charlotte Fonrobert of the religious
studies department and Prof. Hans
Gumbrecht of the comparative liter
ature department. Gumbrecht is on
sabbatical this school year, and
Fonrobert said Gumbrecht's absence
made it too difficult to continue the
course.

For now. Fonrobert will be joining
the faculty in the winter/spring
course Religious Studies: Performing
Religion, which has undergone a few
faculty and curricular changes since
last year.
"This rotation is very healthy,"
Berman said. "The vibrancy of the
I HUM curriculum reflects the cre
ativity of Stanford faculty in our
dynamic intellectual times."
