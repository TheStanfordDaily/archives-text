## Stanford alum donates to medical school Multimillionaire Lorry I. Lokey funds stem cell research site 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
On Monday, the Stanford School of Medicine
announced that alumnus and multimillionaire entre
preneur Lorry Lokey will donate $75 million for a new
stem cell research facility, called the Lorry I. Lokey
Stem Cell Research Building.
Lokey, who lives in Atherton and is the founder of
the international media corporation Business Wire, is
the lead contributor to the project, which in total will
cost $200 million. The remainder of the costs will be
covered by private contributors and the University.
Construction will begin on Oct. 27 and will be com
pleted in summer 2010. Once done, the 200.000-square
foot building will be the stem cell research laboratory
for over 250 scientists.
Lokey's donation pledge is the largest in the med
ical school's history.
"Over the years that 1 have had the pleasure of get
ting to know Lorry Lokey, I have been deeply
impressed by his intelligence and personal commit
ment to using his personal financial resources to truly
impact the world and make it better," said Philip Pizzo.
dean of the School of Medicine, in his newsletter.
In February 2007. Lokey had initially pledged $33
million to the project, which in itself would have been
the largest in the medical school's history. Ultimately,
however. Lokey chose to more than double his dona
tion because of his belief in the supreme importance of
stem cell research.
Lokey was spurred to fund stem cell research when
President Bush forbade the use of federal funds for
stem cell research beginning in 2006. The donor com
pared the advancement of stem cell research to the
development of vaccines during
World War 11, referencing the thou
sands of lives that were saved on the
battlefield as a result. He also
expressed his belief that stem cell
research holds even more promise
for the improvement of healthcare.
"Stem cell research is going to be
an enormous life-saver down the
road, and not too far down," Lokey
said to The Daily. "I mean, we're
talking five or 10 years. For people
with tumors, heart problems, cancer,
this is a field in which research and
development will yield very tangi
ble, very meaningful benefits."
Lokey's connection to the school
contributed to his decision to make
Stanford the recipient of his gift.
"I am an alumnus, so of course
that is one great reason right there
to donate to Stanford." Lokey said.
"But beyond that, the main thing is
that Stanford has the wherewithal
to carry all this out. Stanford is well
equipped to attract the best talent,
engage in the most innovative
research and make sure that as
much progress as possible is being
made on this goal."
Lokey named Irving Weissman.
director of the Stanford Institute of
Stem Cell Biology and
Regenerative Medicine, as a partic
ularly valuable member of the
future research team, going so far as
to suggest that Weissman could
potentially be a Nobel Laureate in
the future.
"The need for research will
always be there." Lokey said. "Even

if one disease gets cured, another
one pops up — people of your age
watched it happen with HIV in the
1980s."
Lokey said his generosity was
driven by a deep commitment to
philanthropy.
"As you go through life, you real
ize that the values you learned dur
ing childhood still apply," he said.
"Growing up during the
Depression, I learned the value of
money. Now that I have a lot of
money myself. I am not interested in
spending it all on yachts when I
have a chance to legitimately help
people."
In 2006, Lokey, having con
tributed $163 million to various
efforts, was ranked 11th among
donors by the Chronicle of
Philanthropy.
During his time here as an
undergraduate in the 19405, Lokey
was editor in chief of The Daily. In
addition to his gift to the .School of
Medicine, he donated over $2 mil
lion to help construct a new office
building for The Daily.
"I attribute a lot of my success,
and where I ultimately ended up. to
my time at Stanford, definitely
including my experiences with The
Daily," he said. "It really sent me in
the right direction."
Lokey's Business Wire dissemi
nates full-text news releases from
thousands of companies and organ
izations to news media and financial
markets worldwide. He founded the
company in 1%1 and sold it in 2006
for approximately $50() million to
Warren Buffett's Berkshire
Hathaway.
