## "Oh tell me, why do we build castles in the [sand]?" 
### CHELSEA MA DESK EDITOR 
The following story is reconstructed from interviews with partici
pants to allow for its narrative style, as the author did not attend
the event.
At this point, they'd rather bike. Highway 92 is suffering
from congestion this Sunday afternoon. $3.81-a-gallon
gas is burning. Perhaps some impatience is bubbling.
For the group of 18 or so Freshman Sophomore Col
lege (FroSoCo) residents — including sophomores, a
Residential Assistant (RA) and his two kids — Pescadero Beach
is inching frustratingly closer at what seems like five miles per
hour.
They're thinking, really now, we just want to build sand castles.

About an hour and a half later, the group arrives at Pescadero
State Beach — a picturesque site 15 miles south of Half Moon
Bay. The water's too cold for splashing about. But the weather is
beautiful. toasty.The white foam hugs the shore, and the sand is
warm and silky between their toes.
"I guess the directions might've been confusing, sorry about
that," someone says.
It's Kirk Rademaker. a kind-looking, middle-aged man with
Anderson Cooper-white hair.
A former carpenter, Rademaker calls himself the "sand guy,"
but professionally, he's a sand sculptor. He has competed in nu
merous international sand sculpting competitions, placing high in
15 and winning two. He also does teambuilding activities with or
ganizations and corporations, with a clientele that includes Yahoo.
Roche and now, Stanford's FroSoCo.
"He's just such an easygoing guy," says Bill Rowan'll after the
trip. "What he likes about sand is not anything particular about
the medium. It's that when he's building a sand castle, he's out on
the beach with other people, and they'll come up to him and be cu
rious. It's a very public art form, and because of that it's accessible
to people.That's how he's been able to make a business out of it."
The nuisances of the morning are certainly gone.

"Alright, let's get going!" Rademaker calls out.
The students help him unload his tools out of his truck. It's an
interesting parade — giant shovels and buckets, large black plas
tic sheets, trowels, something called a "ruskie."
"I was expecting plastic pails and shovels." says Ellie Titus i E
Then Rademaker gets to work. Choosing his spot carefully, he
takes a plastic sheet and bends it into a cylindrical wall about one
and a half feet tall. Next, he fills the form about six inches high
with sand, grabs a pail filled with sea water and sloshes the water
onto the six-inch layer. Once the water is drained, he compacts it
and adds another six inches of sand. Rinse and repeat.
The form is filled, the cylinder removed, and sitting there is a
sand slab. The students control the urge to jump on it.
"And you take your trowel and you just start sculpting away!"
proclaims Rademaker. casually slicing away a giant chunk. Yep.
that simple. "Alright, we're going to start with the top-most ele
ments first."
He picks up the tool he dubbed "the ruskie" — a metal strap
bent into a loop and duct-taped in the middle.
"I saw the Russians use this when I was at international sand
sculpting competitions," he explains.
And with his ruskie. he becomes a contemporary Michelange
lo, deftly creating a castle rich in architectural detail with a quick
flick of his wrist. He crafts rooftops, overhangs and windows. He
carves turrets and a spiral staircase.
Then he turns the group loose to build castles of their own.
There's an eager scramble to and from the ocean as salt water
sloshes in buckets, muddying the bucket carriers' sandy feet.
"Sorry about the sand, it's not very high quality," apologizes
Rademaker."At competitions, they actually quarry sand from the
mountains, so it has more clay and silt.That makes it finer, and it
holds in water more than beach sand."
No worries.They compact the sand expertly, for the most part
removing the plastic cylinders without crumbling the structure
into a giant pile. They cut away here and chisel away there, likely
sculpting the best sand castles they've made in their lives.
Someone proposes that they make roads to connect one sand
castle to the next. Pretty soon this section of the shoreline is a town
under construction.
They concentrate, but really, it's just sheer fun.

more College. Sophomores worked with Kirk Rademakerto learn his sand sculpting craft.
