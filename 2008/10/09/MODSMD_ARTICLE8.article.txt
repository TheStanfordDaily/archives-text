## Bank rate reductions may not cut it 
### MAURA REYNOLDS JAMES PUZZANGHER LOS ANGELES TIMES 
WASHINGTON — Emergency interest-rate cuts
Wednesday by the Federal Reserve and five other
central banks left in doubt whether government
efforts to cure the financial crisis would show results
fast enough to avert fresh panic and serious econom
ic damage.
The synchronized actions failed to inspire stock
investors. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 189
points, or 2 percent, its sixth consecutive daily
decline. European markets fared much worse, with
most stock indexes plunging 5 percent to 7 percent.
There were only hints of improvement in the credit
markets.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson
acknowledged that the financial system's problems
could last for some time.
"I think it's too early to look for encouraging signs
in the credit markets,"he told reporters. "It's going to
take awhile to work through this problem."
Hie reduction in the Fed's benchmark rate by half
a percentage point to 1.5 percent was just the latest in
a series of extraordinary steps by the central bank
and the Treasury Department to restore confidence
to investors and banks.
The move came five days after the enactment of a
$700 billion program to buy up toxic mortgage secu
rities, and just one day after the Fed said it would sup
ply vital credit directly to businesses by purchasing
potentially hundreds of billions of dollars in short
term corporate debt.
But both of those efforts are still in the implemen
tation stage, and it will be weeks at best, officials say,
before the wheels actually begin to turn.
Meanwhile, a housing rescue program enacted
over the summer to refinance the loans of troubled
homeowners with safer mortgages took effect just
this month. A major proponent of that program.
Rep. Barney Frank. D-Mass.. demanded Wednesday
that major mortgage lenders and servicers voluntar
ily refinance more of the bad mortgages on their
books.
And although rate cuts normally cheer markets
instantaneously and spur lending quickly,
Wednesday's actions might not have the desired
result if banks remain afraid to lend. And even if
lower rates do in fact boost the availability of credit,
it can take many months for the effects to work their
way through the economy.
Nonetheless, the central banks "have to try every
thing they can at this point in the crisis." said Nigel
Gault,chief U.S. economist at forecasting firm Global

Insight in Lexington, Mass. "Rate cuts are not a cure
all, but you have to do it. And it's important that this
is done globally because this is a global crisis."
But investors are in no mood to wait for the finan
cial medicine to do its job, said David M. Jones, a for
mer Fed economist and president of DMJ Advisors, a
Denver-based consulting firm.
"What you need in this situation is patience
because it takes at least a year for markets like this to
recover. But the last thing a stock market gripped by
fear has is patience," said Jones, a former Fed econo
mist and president of DMJ Advisors, a Denver-based
consulting firm.
The result is that fearful investors are devaluing
stocks even of healthy, solvent companies. That raises
the risk that consumers, facing steep declines in their
stock portfolios, will cut back on spending, slowing
the economy further.
In essence, the global economy is dealing with two
financial contagions, said David Moss, who teaches
economic history at Harvard University. "If you look
at the Depression, it started with a stock crisis, and it
took a while for the credit crisis to begin." Moss said.
"We're having them simultaneously, which I think is
a bad twist.
"But the good news is that we have an extraordi
narily aggressive Treasury and set of central banks
and they are working very hard," he said. In a fresh
sign of economic weakness, major retailers that
reported preliminary sales data for September
showed declines that foreshadow a dismal holiday
shopping season.
"This entire financial crisis has really spooked a
lot of consumers," said Ken Perkins, president of
research company Retail Metrics Inc. "They're feel
ing it on virtually every front that they can feel it on:
job security, food-price inflation, gas prices."
Meanwhile, extending further the government's
intervention in the financial system, the Fed
announced late Wednesday that it would pump as
much as $37.8 billion more into American
International Group Inc.. the insurance giant that
was saved from bankruptcy proceedings last month
by an $85 billion government bailout.
In the stock market, the expiration of another
unprecedented government action could lead to
more instability Thursday: A temporary ban on
"short selling" of financial stocks was to expire
overnight.
"Things could get a whole lot worse before they
could get better." Schlossberg said."Right now. I'd say
the markets have overreacted, but they always do."

and Andrea Chang in Los Angeles contributed to this
