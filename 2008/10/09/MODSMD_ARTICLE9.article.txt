## Editorial An end to political intolerance 
### 
October of an election year — particu
larly an election year as important as
this one — is a dramatic month. Pun
dits turn it up a notch and heated debates
take center stage on broadcast television.
Stanford, too, has gotten caught up in the fer
vor that comes hand-in-hand with one of the
most exciting and pivotal elections in history.
The editorial board is pleased to see political
apathy replaced with invigorated voter regis
tration drives and campaigning for both can
didates and propositions. We are proud to
see students taking on these initiatives,
whether by sporting T-shirts or campaigning
in nearby states.
As we encourage our peers to take on pol
itics, we also must caution them to find the
line between debate and disrespect. Most of
Stanford heavily champions a single candi
date: Barack Obama. But even at a Universi
ty as liberal as Stanford, many students hold
differing political views. And this fall, those
with disparate views are not getting the re
spect they deserve.
The editorial board would like to remind
Stanford students, faculty, staff and commu
nity members that, regardless of your per
sonal political views, it is imperative that you
take care to express yourself in such a way as
to not give outstanding offense to your peers.
Free speech is both a right and responsibility,
and we by no means encourage students to
fear engaging debate. But that debate should
reflect the intellect that Stanford students
possess and not resort to base name-calling
and insults. We would like to remind you that
you are in the midst of spending four or more
years as a part of a very intimate community,
and we caution you to express your views in
a way that will not burn bridges to your peers.
litis election cycle. Hillary supporters. Re
publicans and conservatives have gone into
hiding when confronted with the onslaught of
vocal Barack support. While we at the edito
rial board respect our fellow students for tak
ing up the banner of a particular candidate,
the way in which they have done so has clear
ly made others of our community uncomfort
able. and it is cause for ample concern.
For example, in a Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity class, "Presidential Poli
tics: Race. Class, Faith and Gender in the
2008 Election," earlier this week. Pra Chan

drasoma '09 told audience members in
Hewlett auditorium that conservative voices
at Stanford were often looked down upon or
silenced. Students tabling for the Stanford
Conservative Society at the fall activities fair
were even spat upon. Others signed up for the
organization but told the students working
the table that they were unwilling to attend
an event because they didn't think they could
fess up to having gone.
Such actions, which are clearly taken not
in support of one candidate but in disrespect
of another candidate and his supporters, con
tribute nothing positive to Stanford. We are
ashamed that fellow Stanford students
would conduct themselves in this way.There
is a line between protest and intolerance, and
some students have clearly crossed that line.
We are thankful to the CSRE class for illu
minating current political issues, including
concerns about intolerance, and we hope this
forum will prove valuable in the future. The
editorial board is pleased that the professors
in this class are attempting to discuss the pres
idential election as academics, not pundits.
Though many right-wing commentators
label university professors as leftist activists,
we are proud of our many professors who
do not use the classroom to preach. Hoover
Fellow and Political Science Prof. Michael
McFaul stated his position as an Obama
supporter and campaign adviser as a matter
of disclosure in Democracy, Development
and the Rule of Law, but he and many other
Obama advisors and supporters have re
mained respectful toward diverse views.
We encourage students to learn from
how professors conduct themselves in the
classroom. Televised presidential debates,
for instance, provide all of us with another
opportunity to respectfully express our sup
port for a candidate. Draw on what was said
during the debates for productive discus
sions afterward, but please try to refrain
from blurting potentially offensive com
ments in the midst of a debate-watching
event. You never know who else may be in
the audience with you and therefore made
uncomfortable by your careless exuberance.
Additionally, the editorial board urges
students to use email chat lists appropriately.

With the partial anonymity granted
by the Internet, students are less
careful to use respectful language.
Students have encouraged only De
mocrats to register in swing states, or
engaged in name-calling directed at
other students who have differing
political views. Students should re
frain from saying something on a
chat list that they would not say to a
friend's face.
Hie editorial board cannot stress
more strongly the need for respect.
For a university that prides itself on
being progressive and tolerant of
any and all views and ideologies,
Stanford community members have
shown a surprising lack of respect for
differing perspectives this election
season. We at Stanford are smart.
We're intellectuals. We claim to pride
ourselves on diversity, but many
have felt an acute lack of tolerance
for political diversity this fall. Stan
ford University is better than this.
