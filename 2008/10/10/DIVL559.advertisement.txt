The Stanford Teacher Education Program (STEP) is a nationally renowned,
innovative program leading to a Master of Arts in Education and a preliminary
California teaching credential. STEP's goal is to prepare program graduates to meet
both the practical and intellectual challenges of the teaching profession, to serve the
needs of the diverse population of today's students, and to revitalize the profession
and the field by preparing educational leaders for tomorrow's schools.
