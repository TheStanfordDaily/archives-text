DEAR DR. PAUL,
It's the much anticipated "Full Moon on the
Quad" on Tuesday and I couldn't be more
enthused. I heard that if you drink hard alco
hol between making out,
and are less likely to spread germs. Is
this true?
Dear Dental Hygienist in Training,
No, drinking alcohol in between tonsil hockey sessions will not disinfect
your mouth. However, it will get you drunk. And if you plan on voracious
ly attacking Full Moon on the Quad the way I am, drinking in between kiss
es will probably have you waist deep in a fifth of Jack. To my chagrin, they
haven't invented tongue condoms yet so be aware that when you kiss peo
ple you share germs, but in most cases they are the normal, harmless bacte
ria that live in everyone's mouth. The only thing you need to
worry about is your friends who are beating you in a
make-out competition. So kiss some people and â– 
leave your germ concern at the gates. Believe 112
me, one of the people you made out with will if \
thank you in the morning;). I | I 1
Got a burning question you can't ask anyone else?
