## Obesity campaign sends wrong message 
### MELANIE REYNARD 
SAN FRANCISCO — Dani. a full-figured 36 year-old woman,
totes a gym bag and a heart monitor on her bicep. She is in a rush
to head home and get to work, but she has stopped, waiting for the
light on the corner of McAllister and Divisadero. She sees an ad
across the street — an ad she's seen on bus shelters all across the
city — and notes, "It's nice to see curvier women in ads."
But if she got close enough to read the text, she would see that
the ad is not intended to glorify curvier women at all. On the con
trary, the text that runs along the woman's thigh reads with instruc
tions on how that thigh should slim down: "Started going for short
walks during lunch hour. Stops ordering take-out and starts cook
ing healthy meals. Just bought bikini that challenges some obscen
ity laws."
Being overweight is considered an epidemic, and this ad is a
failed attempt to address the national problem. According to dieti
cian Susan Levin, "66 percent or two-thirds of American adults are
overweight or obese, with preventable diseases — such as cardio
vascular disease — and these numbers are climbing."
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in partner
ship with the Ad Council, launched this ad campaign in 2004 as part
of a series of radio, magazine, television and billboard public serv
ice announcements. According to Ad Council's Senior Vice
President Heidi Arthur, her campaign intends to plant a seed of
awareness in the public that "small steps can add up," like buying
vegetables instead of chips, or going for a walk in the evening.
Some, however, question whether the ad campaign is really pro
moting good health so much as portraying overweight people as
social outcasts.
"This is a body that I see as normal, put up there as a lightning

rod for freak out," said Marilyn Wann. author of the book Fat!So?
"I wish the government could instead say,' Here's a whole woman
about to go have fun in the pool. "
In March 2008, numerous community members signed a peti
tion to have the ad removed from the bus shelter at McAllister and
Baker. The ad is no longer at that location. In its place, a sign was
briefly posted over the ad baring the notice that "THIS AD IS
OFFENSIVE."
According to Wann, discrimination against overweight people is
a real problem that the ad sanctions. Except in specific locations
such as Michigan. Wisconsin, Washington, D.C. and Santa Cruz, it is
legal to reject a qualified applicant just based on their height and
weight alone.
Dr. Anthony Mascola, a specialist in behavioral medicine at
Stanford, sees stereotypes of overweight people as demeaning
rather than empowering, propagating the "real shame and blame
game going on in our society, despite the fact that we know being
overweight is very heavily genetically and environmentally influ
enced."
Other critics of the ad campaign see its message as misleading,
promising that obesity can be dramatically diminished with only a
couple of small changes to a person's lifestyle.
"You can do the first two points, but it does not mean you will
ever get that body," said Vivian Crisman, a dietician with Health
Promotion Services.
Crisman also warned that the three lines of text "set up a false
expectation instead of promoting size-acceptance."
"A lot of people will feel that they 'failed' because they did not
fit into that bikini," she said.
