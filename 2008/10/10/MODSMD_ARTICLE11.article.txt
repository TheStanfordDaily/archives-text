## Shaw gets hall of fame spot Former volleyball coach receives AVCA honor 
### AMER HANDAN 
Don Shaw, former head coach
of the Stanford women and men's
volleyball team, has been recog
nized by the American Volleyball
Coaches Association (AVCA) and
will be inducted into their Hall of
Fame.
"It made my day," Shaw said. "It
is wonderful for people to remem
ber your hard work and recognize
you for it."
Hard work was something Shaw
and his players knew a lot about.
Brought on board as an assistant
coach by former head volleyball
coach Fred Sturm in 1980, Shaw
faced a multitude of obstacles in
expanding the scope of the
Stanford volleyball program.
"We had no place to practice
except for Maples and Roble
gym." Shaw said. "Our recruiting
budget was minimal. 1 spent a lot
of time driving around in my
Volkswagen van and recruiting
because we had to save money on
hotel rooms."
He coached the women's team
for 16 years and the men's team for
seven. By 1999, he had accumulat
ed a winning record of 440-70 and
won six national titles and ten
Pacific 10 conference titles, all
while maintaining a winning aver
age of .863 — the highest ever
attained by a collegiate volleyball
coach.
"The remarkable thing about
Don Shaw's tenure at Stanford is
the length of time his teams played
at the highest level," said Kathleen
Deßoer, executive director of
AVCA. in an email to The Daily.
"He made winning Pac-10
Championships seem almost rou
tine and the NCAA Championship
weekend just part of the regular
schedule."
John Kosty, the current men's
volleyball head coach, applauded
Shaw's exceptional coaching abili
ties.
"His teams throughout the '90s
exemplified the way he coached,"
Kosty said. "Every time his teams
took the field it was not only fun to
watch, but it was almost perfec
tion."
During his career at Stanford,
Shaw's guidance not only helped
develop some of the best players
that the sport has seen — includ
ing two-time Olympic Gold
Medalist Kerri Walsh — but also
elevated Stanford women's volley
ball to national prominence as a
consistent Top 10 program in the
AVCA poll.
"He put the team on a
pedestal," Kosty said. "It's going to
be hard to knock us down. It's an
impressive legacy that other pro
grams and coaches continue to
aspire to attain."
Although Shaw officially
retired in 2006, he can still be
found regularly watching Stanford
volleyball games and coaching
Intermediate Sand Volleyball as
part of the Stanford athletic cur
riculum. He also continues to run a
private volleyball training camp
unaffiliated with Stanford.
"I love teaching," Shaw said.
"I'm still running my camp and
teaching volleyball. I'm also really
proud of the way John has taken
over the program, and I love to
watch Stanford play."
Millions will watch in
December as Shaw is inducted
into the Hall of Fame as part of the
festivities for the Final Four.
"I want to be known as a win
ner," Shaw said. "But that wasn't
the ultimate goal. The ultimate
goal was to get better everyday."
