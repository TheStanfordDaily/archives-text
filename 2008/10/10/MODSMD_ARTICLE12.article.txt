## Mass-selling panic sends Wall Street deeper into crisis 
### TIM PARADIS MARTIN CRUTSINGER THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
NEW YORK (AP) â€” A stampede of sell
ing that began in the waning minutes of trad
ing on Wall Street spread to Asia on Friday,
deepening a financial crisis that has defied all
efforts to stop it.
Thursday's anniversary of the stock mar
ket peak turned into one of the worst days in
Wall Street history, with the Dow Jones
industrials loosing a breathtaking 679 points.
U.S. stocks lost more than 7 percent, $872
billion of investments evaporated, and the
Dow fell to 8,579. When the average crashed
through the 9,000 level for the first time in
five years in the final hour of trading, sellers
had only begun to hit the gas pedal.
As bad as the day was, even worse was the
cumulative effect of a historic run of declines:
The Dow suffered a triple-digit loss for the
sixth day in a row, a first, and the average

dropped for the seventh day in a row, a losing
streak not seen since 2002.
"Right now the market is just panicked,"
said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard
& Poor's in New York. "Nobody wants to
take on any risk. Everybody just wants to get
their money and put it under the mattress."
The panic quickly spread overseas, where
Asian stock markets plummeted Friday.
Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index shed
more than 10 percent, Hong Kong's Hang
Seng index lost more than 8 percent, South
Korea's Kospi fell 7.4 percent, Shanghai's
benchmark gave up 4.1 percent, and
Singapore's Straits Times index was down 7.0
percent. In Syndey, Australia's S&P/ASX2OO
was down 6.8 percent.
Thursday's sell-off on Wall Street took
place one year to the day after the Dow
closed at its record high of 14,164. Since that
day, frozen credit, record foreclosures, cas
cading job losses and outright fear have
seized the market and sapped 39 percent of

its value.
Paper losses for the year add up to an stag
gering $8.3 trillion, according to preliminary
figures measured by the Dow Jones Wilshire
5000 Composite Index, which tracks 5,000
U.S.-based companies representing almost all
stocks traded in America.
It was the second straight day that Wall
Street was rocked by a final-hour sell-off, but
this one was particularly shocking.
Most of the day was relatively calm, and
the trading floor was quieter than usual
because of the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur.
Wall Street awoke to news the federal govern
ment was brandishing a new weapon against
the financial crisis - considering seeking an
equity stake in major U.S. banks in order to
stabilize them.
But that step appeared to be as ineffectual
as the others Washington has rolled out in
recent weeks, including a $700 billion bailout
of the financial industry, a coordinated interest
rate cut by central banks around the world

and direct lending by the Federal Reserve to
private companies to provide them with short
term cash.
Acquiring a stake in the banks would be
yet another startling intervention by the gov
ernment in the free market, but economists
said President Bush was left with little choice
because of the credit markets, where tight
lending has choked off the everyday cash that
is the lifeblood of the economy.
"In normal times, this would be out of the
question, but in the present dire situation. I
think the government should be employing all
the powers that it can," said Sung Won Sohn,
an economics professor at California State
University, Channel Islands.
Wall Street has been teetering on the brink
of panic for a month now. vulnerable to any
bad news. Thursday's sell-off was triggered
when a major credit rating agency put General
Motors Corp. and its finance affiliate under
review to determine whether it should be
downgraded.
