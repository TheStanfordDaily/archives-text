# THE 						RIGHTS OF THE LIVING
## 
### 
Wednesday afternoon in White Plaza, Stanford students hoisted banners and shouted slogans to oppose the pas
sage of California Propositions 4 & 8. These two propositions, on the ballot for next month's election, would
require parental notification for minors seeking an abortion (Prop. 4) and effectively ban same-sex marriage in
the state (Prop. 8). Student pro-choice and gay rights groups were both on the scene to distribute information
and get their message out to the campus. Candace Gingrich, half-sister of former House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, joined the student activists.
