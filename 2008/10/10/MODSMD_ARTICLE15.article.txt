## Volleyball faces Arizona schools 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN 
The Stanford women's volleyball
team, fresh off of an impressive sweep
of No. 9 Washington and Washington
State that catapulted them to the top
of the conference standings, hopes to
continue its dominating play heading
into a three-game home stand. How
ever, the road to the top is not an easy
one, especially playing in the highly
competitive Pacific 10 Conference.
The No. 4 Cardinal begins its stint
in Maples Pavilion tonight against
No. 25 Arizona. The team will then
take on a potentially underrated Ari
zona State squad on Sunday.
After dismantling a strong Wash
ington team, the Cardinal is expected
to take care of its guests this weekend,
but neither conference rival should be
ignored. Arizona is still nationally
ranked and comes into town with an

impressive record (12-3, 3-1 Pac-10).
In addition, the Wildcats are playing
with a chip on their shoulder after a
tough Oct. 4 loss to No. 12 Colorado
State.
Whitney Dosty leads Arizona on
offense with 160 kills. Stephanie Snow
and Jacy Norton both have over 50
blocks on the season and could pose
an obstacle for Stanford hitters. Stan
ford Coach John Dunning recognizes
the intensity that the Cardinal must
play with.
"[The Wildcats] are a well coached,
very good team," Dunning said. "Ari
zona is in the category of a big, physical,
net team. A lot of their strength lies in
how big they play at the net."
The Cardinal (13-2,4-0) has been
fantastic at the net as well, hitting .332
for the season compared to Arizona's
.244. Stanford has been just as solid
defensively, too, holding Washington

last weekend to a meager hitting per
centage of .101 .The Huskies were one
of many teams to feel pressure from
the Cardinal front line.
Dunning feels that this success is
largely due to the experience of the
team." When you look at our team, it's
easy to say that the reason we're
doing well is because we have very ex
perienced, very good attackers," he
said. "We have 11 people back from
last year, and seven back from two
years ago when we made it to the final
match."
Sophomore Alix Klineman, an
outside hitter with 155 kills and .338
hitting percentage on the season, has
been one of the main contributors to
an improved offense.
"Our passing game has been get
ting better," Klineman said.
When asked if there was one play
er who stood out in this area, Kline
man immediately spoke of sopho
more Cassidy Lichtman.
"Cass looks really experienced on
the court," she said. "A lot of people
take for granted how good she really
is."
With the team riding a nine-match
winning streak while simultaneously
improving in all areas of the game, the
Cardinal seems as powerful as ever.
But from the team's perspective,
there is no cakewalk, even when it
comes to currently unrankcd Arizona
State (10-6,1-2).
The Sun Devils have two key of
fensive weapons in Sarah Reaves and
Margie Giordano. The hitters have
253 and 212 kills, respectively. Howev
er, ASU is struggling on offense with a
.230 hitting percentage. The Cardinal
is focusing on other aspects of the Sun
Devils' game in preparation for the
match.
"[Arizona State's] strength is in
how they control the ball," Dunning
said."lt is frustrating because they dig
everything in sight."
The Sun Devils come to the Bay
Area in search of Pac-10 redemption
after being swept by Arizona on Oct.
1 .ASU is expected to bring ferocity to
the court, which, according to Kline
man, the Cardinal will need to work to
match.

the intensity," she said. "We are not as
focused as we need to be."

USC and UCLA later this month, the
Cardinal looks to boost its confi

Maples Pavilion is the perfect
place for this boost.

Maples, and it is a lot of fun," Kline
man said.

fortable here than on the road."
