## Cardinal kicks off conference play Stanford to face Oregon, Oregon State in opening-weekend games 
### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's soccer team
begins its conference campaign this
weekend as it hosts the Oregon
schools at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
Going on recent form, now seems
like the perfect time for the No. 6 Car
dinal (10-0-1) to enter the Pacific-10
Conference portion of its season. The
team has kept three consecutive clean
sheets and has outscored its oppo
nents 17-1 in its last five games. The
Cardinal's most recent match was a 5-
0 thumping of local rival Santa Clara
last Friday.a result confirming that the
team is playing the type of soccer nec
essary in a conference that is sure to be
one of the toughest in the country this
year.
"It was a good win leading into
Pac-10 [play]," said Stanford head
coach Paul Ratcliffe. "We've had a
good non-conference season,so hope
fully it will help us with confidence
going into [the conference season]."
The Cardinal will kick off the
weekend at 7 p.m. on Friday night
against Oregon. Hie Ducks are off to a
solid season start, compiling a record
of 7-3-1 in their first 11 games. They
have played some good competition
as well, with two of those losses com
ing against top-15 teams (No. 3 Port
land and No. 13 Oklahoma State), and
the other coming against Purdue,
which was in the top-25 at the time.
Oregon is led by sophomore Jen
Stoltenberg. who has collected seven
goals and five assists over the course of

GAME NOTES: Stanford comes into this week
end's game sporting an undefeated record.
That said, the team still has a long way to go
in capturing the Pac-10 - Friday night's
match-up with the Ducks marks the Cardi
nal's first game of the Pac-10 schedule.

the season.
Last years fixture between the
Ducks and the Cardinal could provide
the latter with some extra motivation
for this year's match. It was a game
that Stanford thoroughly dominated
—it took 24 shots while Cardinal
goalkeeper Erica Holland wasn't
forced to make a single save — yet the
team left Eugene with a 0-0 draw. With
a more lethal attack this year and a
backline that is just as sturdy, the Car
dinal will be expected to finish more of
those chances this time around and
send Oregon home with a loss.
After taking on the Ducks. Stan
ford will play host to Oregon State
on Sunday. Looking at the non-con
ference records, the two teams sit on
opposite ends of the Pac-10 — Stan
ford's overall winning percentage is
slightly above UCLA's (9-0-2) for
the top spot, while Oregon State's
record of 5-4-1 puts them at last in

the conference.
The Beavers have played just one
match against a ranked team this
year, a 3-0 loss to No. 14 Boston Col
lege hack on Aug. 29. Stanford heat
Boston College by that exact same
score two days later. While that by no
means suggests that the Card should
win by six goals on Sunday, it would
clearly be an upset if the Beavers
could get a result.
Last year's match between the two

schools was certainly much closer
than expected, when Stanford came in
at No. 5 in the nation and the Beavers
were winless in the conference. Al
though the Cardinal would win 2-0
after a Christen Press double, it took
until the 61st minute for the team to
really put the game out of reach with
the second goal.
While the Card will not overlook
either of the Oregon schools, both of
the matches this weekend are games
that it will need to win if the team ex
pects to win the Pac-10 title,as the pre
season coaches' poll predicted it
would. With No. 4 UCLA and No. 5
USC also sure to be in the mix for the
conference championship. Stanford

cannot afford too many slip-ups.and a
good start to the Pac-10 season can re
ally set the tone for the rest of the cam
paign.
Luckily, the team seems to he hit
ting its stride at the right time.
"Hie 5-0 victory definitely gives us a
lot of momentum and confidence
going into the Pac-10 [season]." said
junior midfielder Kristin Stannard.
"We know there are some great teams
in our conference, and it will take lots
of hard work, but we are all willing to
do whatever we can to get that Pac-10
title this year."
