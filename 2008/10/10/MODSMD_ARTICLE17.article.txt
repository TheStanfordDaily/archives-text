## Editorial End complacent about Stanford security 
### 
Stanford often prides itself on being a
safe campus. Indeed, we face few of the
difficulties our peer institutions on the
East Coast experience. We do not live in a
city with a high crime rate, and the number
of major incidents on campus has been rela
tively low. But this illusion of safety has
lured us into a sense of complacency.
Ibis past weekend. 18 thefts occurred
across campus, with up to $30,000 in proper
ty stolen. The editorial hoard cautions the
student body to think more seriously about
campus safety and to change the perception
that Stanford is always safe.
When crimes occur, the community goes
on high alert, but the drama is remembered
for a few weeks at best. Long forgotten are
the armed robberies from several years ago,
or even last year's spate of dorm break-ins
via crow bars. According to the 2008 Stan
ford Safety and Security Report, 238 burgla
ries occurred on campus in 2007, yet stu
dents act as if they will not be the ones who
fall victim to those acts. Criminals are well
aware of Stanford students' lax attitude, and
this makes us even more vulnerable.
Instead of forgetting about last week
end's crimes and assuming that we couldn't
possibly be the next victim, we as students
need to change their attitudes.The onus now
falls on us. Lock your doors, even when
jumping in the shower. Buy laptop locks. A
few seconds of your time could save you a
few thousand dollars. Just because you're on
a high floor does not mean you are safe from
a break-in.
There is a good chance criminals have
learned our patterns of behavior and know
who the easiest targets are.
Even though we are responsible for pro
tecting our own belongings, campus police
are busy beefing up their security and
demonstrating their protection of us as well.
In particular, we applaud the police officers
who have chatted with students one-on-one
in dining halls. This kind of personal out
reach shows officers' willingness to support
the campus community.
We are also glad to see that police have
put out an additional vehicle on Friday and
Saturday nights,even though that may mean

transferring resources from another area or
having sheriffs work hours they usually
don't. While this will by no means put a com
plete stop to the burglaries, we hope an in
creased emphasis on campus security on
part of the police will demonstrate to both
students and burglars that Stanford takes se
curity seriously.
The University has also responded to the
recent thefts commendably by providing in
formation to the student body We hope that
students recognize that an issue that merits
an email from Vice Provost for Student Af
fairs Greg Boardman is an issue that ought
to be taken seriously.
In the future, we hope the University will
continue to contact students as promptly as
possible. Students are sometimes left in the
lurch for days or weeks when a major theft
occurs on campus, such as the left of a laptop
that contained personal data of thousands of
individuals in the final days of the 2007-2008
school year. Hopefully, this lack of notifica
tion will not occur again.
We as students are grateful that the Uni
versity has implemented the emergency no
tification program, and we also hope that ad
ministrators will remember to contact stu
dents quickly when a non-threatening crime,
such as burglary, occurs.
Another commendable effort at security
on the part of the University has been the ID
card pilot program. This new program,
which allows students to enter their dorms
using their ID cards instead of a key, is a
large step toward ensuring that inappropri
ate persons cannot gain access to student
residences.
As we emphasized earlier in the week,
however, efforts on behalf of the University
and the police can only go so far. More than
anything, students need to step up. Have the
courage to ask strangers in your house who
they're coming to visit. A few moments of
awkwardness could save a friend a lot of
money.
Living within the Stanford bubble does
not exempt you from the problems of the
outside world, including petty theft. So wake
up, Stanford, and keep an eye out for the
safety of yourself and your peers.
