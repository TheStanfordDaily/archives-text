# Leaner, Meaner Seniors
## TSF: Staying the Course 
### 
Avery important event is
scheduled to occur on the
first Tuesday in November —
an event that's going to affect stu
dents all across campus. Many people
are excited, but some just can't wait
for it to be over.
The election, you say? Nah, who
cares about the election? Be real.
It's the deadline for The Stanford
Fund! That's right, folks. If your stu
dent group wants money from the
University, you have to apply for
funding from The Stanford Fund —
or TSF — bv Tuesday, November 4.
The Stanford Fund, as many stu
dents can attest, funds student organ
izations in exchange for a set number
of volunteer labor hours or thank you
letters written on behalf of the group
to unwitting alumni donors.
One of the cardinal rules for writ
ing the letters — seriously — is that
the "T" in "The Stanford Fund" must
always be capitalized. Letters are re
jected all the time for errors in capital
ization, misspellings and, of course,
getting the donor's name wrong.
With such fastidiousness, you'd
think TSF would write its own letters
perfectly, but it turns out that's not
true.
A good friend of mine, Mukie
Ramkumar '07, received an email
from a TSF representative asking for
a donation in November of last year.
It seemed normal at first... except
that the TSF representative had for
gotten to capitalize the "T" in "The
Stanford Fund!"
Can you imagine Mukie's shock?
Can you imagine his horror? Can you
imagine the black, black terror that
drove straight into his heart?
Fearing for the soul of TSF, he im
mediately emailed back noting the
mistake.Thankfully, another TSF rep
resentative — presumably the origi
nal rep was fired on the spot — wrote
back expressing her "sincerest apolo
gies for this terrible oversight," agree
ing that "this was a huge error."
Thank God there are voices of rea

son and dignity among the TSF popu
lace. Without the discipline and rigid
ity ot writing countless TSF letters, the
Stanford student experience just
wouldn't be the same.
But wait —this year is different!
TSF is expanding the set of options
one can pursue to earn funding. Now,
alternatively, you can make short
movies to show your thanks.
The TSF Web site (and 1 know it
doesn't make much sense to say "The
TSF" anything, but I'm doing it any
way) explains,"Videos will be posted
online and sent to donors via email to
demonstrate the impact of their gifts
on campus life."
Can you believe the blasphemy?
TSF is going to allow us to be more
creative? When writing letters, the
guidelines were so stringent we never
needed to worry about going astray.
But the TSF has not yet released
specific, public guidelines on par with
those that accompany letter-writing
campaigns, and this worries me. Like
most Stanford students, I need to be
told exactly what to do in excruciating
detail or I will screw up.'lTius, to help
student groups and protect the legacy
of TSF, I propose a new set of instruc
tions for the movie option that I be
lieve most accurately adheres to TSF
culture:
I.'The Stanford Fund," with a capital
"T," must Hash at the bottom of the
screen whenever the term is men
tioned.
2.The TSF emblem must take up resi
dence in the top right corner at all
times.
3. Any imperfections in the movie (i.e.
bikers in the background) can be cov
ered by one simple, black
strikethrough.
4. At some point during the movie, the
following line must be spoken: "The
Stanford Fund has led to my Stanford
experience being fulfilled. Were it not
to have been there, I would have in
stead spent all my out-of-class time in
Meyer Library staring at the wall."
5. The donor's name must be pro-

Letters are
rejected all the
time for errors in
capitalization...

nounced perfectly.
6. ITie movie may be no longer than
six minutes and 12 seconds.
NOTE: Failure to meet any of
these guidelines will result in your
movie being immediately disqualified
and your group being barred from
using the movie option henceforth.
These guidelines better reflect the
needs of both the alumni donor com
munity and the student body. I hope
my proposal is accepted immediately
so that we can now and forevermore
save the soul of The Stanford Fund.
