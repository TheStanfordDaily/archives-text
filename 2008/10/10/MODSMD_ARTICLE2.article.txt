## Tavita takes center stage for Card

Four short weeks into the season last year, the
Cardinal, 1-3, had lost nearly all of its games
and had the worst record in the Pac-10 confer
ence. A series of players had gone down with
injuries — against Oregon, sophomore run
ning hack Toby Gerhart suffered a torn PCL. and little
more than a week later senior quarterback T.C Ostran
der was hospitalized as the result of a seizure.
"If things weren't bleak enough." an ESPN broad

caster said leading into the game, "the Cardinal will
have a new quarterback — Tavita Pritchard — who has
thrown only three college passes."
Pritchard had only appeared in five games in his col
lege career, as reserve quarterback, on special teams
and as a wide receiver. His first career start was to take
place against USC.
No. 2 USC was fired up and looking for a dominant win.
A closer-than-anticipated 27-24 win over Washington
had caused the Trojans, normally a fixture atop the AP
Poll, to slip behind LSU.

But Pritchard was determined to not
be counted out. In what will assuredly
remain one of the most memorable
plays in Stanford history, he engineered
a win over USC with a 10-yard touch
down pass to senior wide receiver Mark
Bradford. The win ended the Trojan's
home win streak at 35.
"I knew he'd come through," Har
baugh said of Pritchard, "From the be
ginning of the week, he had a bounce in
his step. He had a gleam in his eye from
Sunday on. We have found a true war
rior."
You'd probably expect big things
from Pritchard, who grew up around
the game. His father, David, played
football at Clover Park High School be
fore playing in the Army and then at
Washington State University. He was a
coach throughout Pritchard's child
hood and is still Clover Park's offensive
coordinator.
But it was possibly from a different
family member that Pritchard gleaned
the desire to play quarterback. His
uncle. Jack "The Throwin' Samoan"
Thompson, played for Washington
State where, by the end of his collegiate
career, he had set the Pac-10 record for
pass attempts, completions and touch
down passes, and the NCAA record for
pass yardage. He was the third overall
pick in the NFL draft and played for
both the Cincinnati Bengals and the
Tampa Bay Buccaneers.
Pritchard excelled at the quarter
back position in high school and
brought his experience with him to
Stanford. When word of his commit
ment to Stanford got out, locals had
only good things to say about him.
"I like Tavita for a lot of reasons,"
said Chris Fetters, a Northwest recruit
ing analyst, at the time. "He's a prolific
prep quarterback, so he's used to put
ting up big numbers. His mechanics are
top-notch because he's been working
with Jack Thompson forever. He's got
size, good speed, very good arm
strength and is very coachable ... Stan
ford will love him."

"We're set. It's
all about the
next six."

Senior running back

Though it was chance that pushed
him into the starting quarterback posi
tion. it was Pritchard's mind for the
game and exceptional arm strength that
kept him in that position. Even after
Stanford recruited a pair of stellar quar
terbacks to contend for the position, he
came out on top. And he's not stopping
there — Tavita is working every day to
improve his game.
"[My accuracy] was a big point of
emphasis for me," Pritchard told
ESPN's Ted Miller. "More than just
throwing the ball accurately — it's get
ting us into the right plays, getting us
into the right protections and making it
so we can run the ball well. It's obvious
ly a team thing. But I knew I needed to
get better in that area. I spent a lot of
time this summer throwing the ball — I
threw the ball almost every day."
His work seems to be paying off —
the Cardinal (3-3, 2-1 Pac-10) is off to
one of its better starts in recent years.
It's on a two-home-game win streak,
and if this Saturday results in a win, the
Cardinal will have had its best seven
game start since 2004.
"We're set," said senior running back
Anthony Kimble. "We're in solid con
tention for a bowl game. It's all about
the next six."

recent home game against San Jose State. Pritchard has fended off
competition and criticism to lead the Cardinal to a 3-3 record so far.
