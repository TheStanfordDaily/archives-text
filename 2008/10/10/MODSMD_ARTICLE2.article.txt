## Tavita takes center stage for Card

Four short weeks into the season last year, the
Cardinal, 1-3, had lost nearly all of its games
and had the worst record in the Pac-10 confer
ence. A series of players had gone down with
injuries — against Oregon, sophomore run
ning hack Toby Gerhart suffered a torn PCL. and little
more than a week later senior quarterback T.C Ostran
der was hospitalized as the result of a seizure.
"If things weren't bleak enough." an ESPN broad

caster said leading into the game, "the Cardinal will
have a new quarterback — Tavita Pritchard — who has
thrown only three college passes."
Pritchard had only appeared in five games in his col
lege career, as reserve quarterback, on special teams
and as a wide receiver. His first career start was to take
place against USC.
No. 2 USC was fired up and looking for a dominant win.
A closer-than-anticipated 27-24 win over Washington
had caused the Trojans, normally a fixture atop the AP
Poll, to slip behind LSU.
