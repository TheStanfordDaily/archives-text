## Obama, terrorist 
### 
I wasn't surprised that it hap
pened: I was surprised at the lack
of subtlety. Sarah Palin declared
on Monday that Senator Barack
Obama had spent time "palling
around with terrorists."
Of course. Falin was referring to
Bill Ayers. a 1960s radical who com
mitted an act of domestic terrorism
when Senator Obama was the ripe
old age of 12. In the intervening
years. Ayers recovered his reputa
tion in his native Illinois and served
on a few public service boards
aimed at reducing poverty along
with Barack Obama. The two once
lived in the same neighborhood.
According to the Washington
Post Fact Checker, the two moved in
the same progressive political cir
cles in Chicago and likely held a few
conversations at meetings both hap
pened to attend. More substantive
ly, Ayers cut Senator Obama a $200
check for his re-election campaign
to the Senate. But by no stretch of
the imagination could the two be
called pals.
Should Senator Obama have
been wary of being associated with
Ayers? Should Barack Obama have
shunned Ayers whenever the two
met by chance, and should he have
returned Ayer's paltry $200? From a
strictly political standpoint, perhaps
yes. Whether a politician should re
fuse to come into contact with any
one who might make him or her
look remotely guilty by exaggerated
association is a debate for another
time.
ITie question that lingers today is
why the McCain campaign wants to
link Obama to Ayers. One logical
explanation is that both currently
support traditionally progressive
policies for the country. While true,
it seems hardly necessary to evoke
Ayers for this purpose.
Another logical explanation
might be that the McCain campaign
is concerned that Senator Obama is
a recent convert to domestic terror-

Anish Mitra

ism. Obviously, this is not the case.
In fact, the connection between
Senator Obama and Bill Ayers serves
a logic all its own — a logic that has
sadly defined much of American pol
itics. A hint is seen in Palin's defense
of her comment. When Senator
Obama pointed out that he was not
aware of Ayer's past when the two
first met, Palin responded, "Surely
the Senator knew that he was launch
ing his political career in the living
room of a terrorist?"
Let us disregard the blatant mis
truths in Palin's statement and focus
on the operative word: terrorist.
Herein lays the true intent of the
McCain strategy. It isn't a secret that
despite the Obama Campaign's at
tempts to rebut the rumors, many
Americans believe Senator Obama
is a Muslim. (Senator Obama is, in
fact,a Christian.)
That fact, coupled with the Sena
tor's middle name. Hussein, has led
many to distrust Senator Obama on
the farcical grounds that he may be
a terrorist. Of course, this level of
prejudice exists in addition to the
fact that many Americans are too
racist to contemplate a black presi
dent.
Running out of time, ideas and
money, the McCain campaign is
hoping to build the Obama terrorist
fiction and damage his reputation in
any way they can. In the current cli
mate of economic calamity, foreign
policy disaster and the culmination
of eight years of GOP policy, even
some of the most prejudiced voters
are considering voting for the De
mocrat for President.
The sad truth is that McCain re
alizes he needs these voters, and the
only way he can get them is by ma
nipulating their fears.
As long as the malicious untruths
about Obama are relegated to the

dustbins of discredited bloggers,
and the focus is on the economy,
prejudiced voters may spring for
Senator Obama. Polls show McCain
behind in every swing state that
matters, including reliably red states
such as Virginia.
But if the McCain campaign can
inject credibility into slanders about
Senator Obama and raise them as
even a marginally important issue.
McCain knows there are votes in
Virginia, Ohio, Nevada and several
other swing states that will move his
way.
Perhaps it was inevitable that the
first African American to have a
real chance to win the Presidency
would face such slander, especially
if his name happened to be Barack
Hussein Obama. But to see Senator
McCain indulge in such behavior is
appalling.
In 2000,1 was outraged on behalf
of Senator McCain when George W.
Bush operatives spread lies that Mc-
Cain's adopted Bangladeshi daugh
ter was in fact his illegitimate black
child. Senator McCain himself was
disgusted that the Republicans
would resort to such tactics for vic
tory and lamented the dishonor of
the Bush political team.
Today, by hoping to link the
words"Obama" and "terrorist," Mc-
Cain is engaging in the same racial
game he once criticized.
In a week when our reputation
abroad is in tatters and the Dow
Jones slipped below the 10,000
mark. McCain is trying to win an
election by misleading voters into
believing Senator Obama is a ter
rorist. For the sake of the nation. I
can only hope that the electorate's
definition of honor is more cansis
tent than Senator McCain's.
