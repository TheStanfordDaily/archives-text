# Hardly Strictly Bluegrass 8
## 
### 
The Flardly Strictly Bluegrass Festival is
a uniquely Northern Californian phe
nomenon. Paid for by eccentric mil
lionaire banjo player Warren Hellman, this
all-free, three-day hootenanny sprawled
across five stages in San Francisco's scenic
but-hobo-ridden Golden Gate Park. Every
year it's a throwback to the days of massive
outdoor love-ins — in fact, looking across
the teeming hordes packed into the verdant
former polo grounds, the average onlooker
might have mistaken this year's festival for a
Summer of' 67 reunion.
Instead of a southern, old time-shindig
crowd of wizened men alternately shooting
whiskey and pickin' classics such as "Nail that
Catfish to the Tree" or "Shove that Pig's Foot
a Little Further in the Fire," Hardly Strictly
featured E-addled gutterpunks gyrating wild
ly in paisley harem pants and hypercolor
fanny packs.
This is not the only distinction between
the Hardly Strictly and the Smithville
Fiddlers' Jamboree and Crafts Festival
("Wholesome fun for the entire family!").
The average Smithville attendee would be
quite bemused by the vegan stand offering
"Mediterranean platters" with brown rice
dolmas. The drug of choice was marijuana,
not meth, and the crowd loudly booed a man
who attempted to praise Sarah Palin as the
"articulate governor of Alaska."
The festival lacked the only thing Warren
Hellman couldn't buy with his millions of
banjo-bucks: an authentic, local bluegrass
culture. Even the music was, as the name
suggests, hardly traditional. Yes, Earl Scruggs
and Ralph Stanley waved their hillbilly flag
high, but city gypsies Gogol Bordello twirled
their vaguely ethnic mustaches at a packed
audience of tight-pantsed hipsters; indie dar
ling Iron & Wine held sway over the Rooster
Stage; and MC Hammer apparently played at
some point, although neither of us bothered
to go and see him.
Friday
It turns out that Friday's highlight was a
hybrid of these two divergent strains. Alison
Krauss, perhaps the most talented of
Nashville's new generation of fiddlers, and
legendary Led Zeppelin lead singer Robert
Plant captivated the Banjo Stage with a
strange yet alluring crossbreed of bluegrass
and roots rock. The classic Zep hit "Black

Dog" opened with a slow banjo twang in lieu
of the Jimmy Page guitar riff, and other old
timey boom-chuck tunes like "Gone Gone
Gone (Done Moved On)" gained an epic air
with the superimposition of the Plant wail. A
particularly moving portion saw Krauss per
forming her classic "1 Went Down to the
River to Pray," featured on the "O Brother
Where Art Thou" soundtrack. Beginning the
song alone, she was slowly joined by Robert
Plant and alt-country icon T-Bone Burnett.
The rising male voices behind Krauss' lilting
tones provided a bittersweet, sacred moment
in the midst of a largely heavy set.
Saturday
Saturday's lineup featured bands likely
unknown by the unwashed, patchouli-scent
ed San Francisco masses. We parked in front
of the main Banjo Stage, starting the day
with the Peter Rowan Bluegrass Band.
Rowan, who exercised influence over the nas
cent hippie-fled "newgrass" movement of the
'70s through bands like Old and In the Way
and Muleskinner, paved the road for musical
collaborations like the Krauss and Plant set
of the previous day. His set on Saturday,
however, was conservatively traditional, espe
cially compared with Friday's music. His trio
of musicians was solid as an ensemble, and it
featured standout banjo.
Three Girls and their Buddy, a collabora
tion between Emmylou Harris, Patty Griffin,
Shawn Colvin and Buddy Miller, slowed
down the pace with lyrical Southern ballads
such as "The Eyes of a Woman Who Loves
You." The four performers sat casually in
chairs, chatting and telling stories through
out the songs. Harris' sultry voice dripped
with southern comfort, and she powered the
band through a contemplative, soothing set.
They were followed by Hot Rize; a Tim
O'Brien, Pete Wernick, Nick Forster and
Bryan Sutton collaboration. Their music
brought back the upbeat, whoopin'-it-up
style started that day by Peter Rowan. Tearing
up their strings with amphetaminic abandon,
they whined nasally in perfect bluegrass style
about the women who'd loved them — and
left them.
For a complete change of pace, the next
performer was Odetta, a single elderly
woman most famous for her work as the
voice of the civil rights movement and her
influence on rockers like Bob Dylan. Now

confined to a wheelchair, Odetta sat in front
of the microphone for an hour, singing folk
songs and dispensing her wisdom. To thun
derous applause, she strictly told the crowd,
"When you go out and have a good time,
don't forget your condoms!" then sang a
charming song about unplanned pregnancy.
The appreciative crowd gave her a roaring
standing ovation at the end of her set, won
over by her old-timey performance.
Sunday
Sunday brought unclassifiable freak folk
favorites Bonnie "Prince" Billy and Iron &
Wine to a Rooster Stage designed by the pro
moters to be an intimate venue — nestled in
a narrow dell off the main string of stages.
The enormous popularity of warbling men
with beards among the city's youth, however,
meant the audience was crawling up the sides
of the valley, even spilling over the lip into
the concessions areas.
The size of the crowd proved no prob
lem for the Prince, who brought his own
overalls, a six-piece band, and a rollicking
songbook tailor-made for the hoedown spirit
of the occasion. The often-understated artist
even dedicated a song to the many dogs in
the audience, howling and yapping into the
microphone before returning to an extended
kazoo solo.
Iron & Wine's unflappable Samuel
Beam, on the other hand, found himself in
simply the wrong venue. His brand of bony,
murmured folk-poem was swallowed up in
the sheer enormity of the audience that
came. His subdued solo act, not helped by
brief sound failures, seemed a slightly jarring
departure from the generally festive nature of
the concert.
Picking up the party-hearty slack with
the Chuck Taylor set was New York's Gogol
Bordello, who spiced up their jackboot
Klezmer with a peripatetic stage show com
plete with backup dancers and heavy but
unidentifiable Eastern European accents.
Sounding much like The Clash discovering
accordions, frontman Eugene Hutz growled
his way through one Oil-inspired stomper
after another, barely pausing to let his band
mates re-wax their handlebars.
The real draws, however, not only for the
day, but for the length of the concert, were
bluegrass legends Ralph Stanley and Earl
Scruggs. Stanley, arguably the most iconic

voice in the history of country and bluegrass,
has provided the fast-rolling tenor banjo and
high, lonesome vocals behind the Clinch
Mountain Boys since 1946, and, though his
hands can no longer bum-ditty the clawham
mer in the way they once did, the haunting,
rough keen of his voice maintains its power.
Cognizant of his own frailty, Dr. Stanley
often stepped back to let his younger all-star
backing band shine on its own, and he occa
sionally seemed unsure on stage, though he
still introduced each number with that trade
mark down-home stage patter:
"This here is Steve Sparkman — the boy
what won a banjo competition," he said.
"Hundred twenty-five players."
"Hundred and twenty-six, Ralph."
"Hundred and twenty-six banjo players,
and this boy took the prize," Stanley paused.
"'Course, they made him give it back."
And, naturally, to see the legend himself
perform his a cappella "O Death" (another
cut from the"o Brother" soundtrack) was
nothing short of a revelation.
Earl Scruggs is up in years as well — he's
only recently turned 86 — but he's still pick
ing the five-string in the style named after
him; the style that not only makes him quite
possibly the most important banjo player of
all time, but one of the fathers of modern
bluegrass music. Scruggs now plays with an
electrified rock-type ensemble, including an
electric guitar and bass as well as a drum kit,
of the type he's utilized since his 1973
"Dueling Banjos." And while he now leaves
the singing to his sons, who lived up to their
names with some red-hot flatpicking, the
classic instrumentals ("Foggy Mountain
Breakdown," "Clinch Mountain Backstep,"
"Foggy Mountain Rock") were as tight as
ever.
Finally, acting as the festival's closer was
the incomparable Emmylou Harris, who,
with her sweet voice and tight songwriting,
proved a fitting end to the festivities. Or
maybe it was good — we don't know. We
skipped her to catch the Caltrain. We hear
she was great.
