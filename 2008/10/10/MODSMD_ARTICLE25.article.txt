# Navigating Full Moon on the Quad: Etiquette for Stanford's favorite holiday
## "...don't assume tongue. But react quickly if tongue is offered." 
### 
The term "Full Moon on the Quad" is
an enigma to the average incoming
Stanford student. Many have never
heard this combination of words before. And
because asking after its deeper meaning will
invariably give rise to giggles on the part of a
mentoring upperclassman, the uninitiated
freshman may be under the tragic misappre
hension that it is some kind of "laughter
party" or "chuckle fest," or perhaps a sort of
debilitating facial tic.
In fact, Full Moon on the Quad is a
long-standing Stanford tradition. In the late
19th century, bored with the World's Fair,
students first organized the event as a means
of welcoming the freshman class. Drawing
from pagan rituals surrounding the lunar
cycle and desperately seeking yet another
occasion to don their formal evening wear,

the senior class gathered at the Quad during
the first full moon of the academic year and
awaited the arrival of the freshmen. The
freshman class arrived, carrying roses. Each
freshman then handed a rose to a senior, who
in turn gave them a gentle kiss and welcomed
them to the University.
There were many benefits to this initial
approach. Research shows that over 75 per
cent of the kissing pairs were married within
the following year, and only 40 percent
forcibly. Many poor but perky frosh, played
by Audrey Tautou, dreamt of FMOTQ as the
night that they might lock lips with a
haughty but well-meaning oilman's son,
played by Javier Bardem. However, there were
enough negative effects (syphilis, jazz) that
the University has decided to exercise more
oversight in recent years.

What this means to the student on the
ground is that the etiquette surrounding the
tradition, once so simple (bring rose, get
kissed) has ballooned into a complex social
apparatus of dos and don'ts.
Naturally, navigating these tricky situa
tions is more difficult if you are overly intox
icated. We concede that it's natural to get a
little liquid courage in you, particularly given
the prospect of getting kissed. However,
being severely impaired can make even kiss
ing unpleasant, as the inability to operate
your lips severely hinders your Frenching
technique. Plus, no one will want to get near
you if your breath smells like vomit and
you're being escorted out by the police. There

is staff on hand to take care of people that

make this mistake, but public drunk
enness is a surefire way of limiting i

your make-out partners to whatever fun peo
ple you find in the San Jose Police
Department's drunk tank. I'm actually still
with Jeremiah, but it doesn't work out so well
) for everyone.
i Speaking of staff on hand, there is a
SWAT team of student personnel whose job
it is to "take care of you." There arc two alco
hol-related cases in which this becomes nec
essary. The first of these is at that point on
the blood alcohol scale where your orneri
ness peaks — when the mere presence of a
libertarian causes you to lash out with both
fists. The second is way, way past that point,
where the physical ability to be ornery is
e superseded by the constant and bewildering
desire to vomit into the lap of the freshman
class dean.
If your coordination is under control,

there are a few ground rules to abide by: First
of all, kissing is not dry humping. The simple
fact that you have kissed someone does not
mean that you may grind your clothed pelvis
against their tensed buttocks, no matter how
much their skimpy or alternative manner of
dress may imply that they are way into public
frottage. On the other hand, don't worry
about the message you're sending out by situ
ating yourself in the center of a knot of over
sexed students — you are in no sense giving
anyone any invitation to do anything other
than kiss, and that's final. People are not
allowed to squeeze you in fun or exciting
places, for instance. They are also not allowed

to sell you self-sharpening knives or

supplies, no matter
1 how outrageous the discount.
Still, it is worth noting that

there is the possibility that someone with an
agenda will show up. Grad students, perhaps.
Even high schoolers. There has been at least
one sighting of a North American brown
bear.
Second, don't assume tongue. But react
quickly if tongue is offered. If, for instance,
you are interested in that particular method,
parry the other person's tongue with your
own, as if sword fighting. If uninterested,
vigorously bring your teeth down on your
partner's tongue and stare confidently into
his or her eyes as if to say, "Stop screaming."
Third, bring a buddy. FMOTQ gets real
crowded, and it's easy to get lost in a sea of
sweaty strangers. A buddy can provide won
derful support in such arenas as handholding
and advice. That doesn't mean that you
should cling to that person. Go out and meet

new people! And then kiss them. But having
a friend nearby is always a good idea in case
you need rapid-fire judgment on the adequa
cy of your future snog-mate.
Fourth, if you know or even think you
have something infectious, don't spread
your liquid. This is a very simple rule of
thumb, but people still manage to justify
their symptoms as "character." That rash on
your skin? Just a rugburn. That open wound?
It'll close up. If you are exhibiting symptoms
of an acute, infectious illness, wait until next
year. Also — and this is counterintuitive —
don't brush your teeth. The resultant
microabrasions on your gums facilitate dis
ease transfer. And that's not funny. We sat
here and tried to think of a joke, but all we
came up with were sad stories from high
school.

Firth, not everyone is kissable. Some
people don't have lips.
Hut the most important thing is to
remember that this is supposed to tie fun.
What with the stress of classes and all the
radiation, it's easy to lose sight of the simple
pleasure of meeting a stranger in the middle
of one of this country's finest universities
and placing your mouth on theirs. Also, free
hats!

the senior class gathered at the Quad during
the first full moon of the academic year and
awaited the arrival of the freshmen. The
freshman class arrived, carrying roses. Each
freshman then handed a rose to a senior, who
in turn gave them a gentle kiss and welcomed
them to the University.
There were many benefits to this initial
approach. Research shows that over 75 per
cent of the kissing pairs were married within
the following year, and only 40 percent
forcibly. Many poor but perky frosh, played
by Audrey Tautou, dreamt of FMOTQ as the
night that they might lock lips with a
haughty but well-meaning oilman's son,
played by Javier Bardem. However, there were
enough negative effects (syphilis, jazz) that
the University has decided to exercise more
oversight in recent years.

What this means to the student on the
ground is that the etiquette surrounding the
tradition, once so simple (bring rose, get
kissed) has ballooned into a complex social
apparatus of dos and don'ts.
Naturally, navigating these tricky situa
tions is more difficult if you are overly intox
icated. We concede that it's natural to get a
little liquid courage in you, particularly given
the prospect of getting kissed. However,
being severely impaired can make even kiss
ing unpleasant, as the inability to operate
your lips severely hinders your Frenching
technique. Plus, no one will want to get near
you if your breath smells like vomit and
you're being escorted out by the police. There

is staff on hand to take care of people that

make this mistake, but public drunk
enness is a surefire way of limiting i

your make-out partners to whatever fun peo
ple you find in the San Jose Police
Department's drunk tank. I'm actually still
with Jeremiah, but it doesn't work out so well
) for everyone.
i Speaking of staff on hand, there is a
SWAT team of student personnel whose job
it is to "take care of you." There arc two alco
hol-related cases in which this becomes nec
essary. The first of these is at that point on
the blood alcohol scale where your orneri
ness peaks — when the mere presence of a
libertarian causes you to lash out with both
fists. The second is way, way past that point,
where the physical ability to be ornery is
e superseded by the constant and bewildering
desire to vomit into the lap of the freshman
class dean.
If your coordination is under control,

there are a few ground rules to abide by: First
of all, kissing is not dry humping. The simple
fact that you have kissed someone does not
mean that you may grind your clothed pelvis
against their tensed buttocks, no matter how
much their skimpy or alternative manner of
dress may imply that they are way into public
frottage. On the other hand, don't worry
about the message you're sending out by situ
ating yourself in the center of a knot of over
sexed students — you are in no sense giving
anyone any invitation to do anything other
than kiss, and that's final. People are not
allowed to squeeze you in fun or exciting
places, for instance. They are also not allowed

to sell you self-sharpening knives or

supplies, no matter
1 how outrageous the discount.
Still, it is worth noting that

there is the possibility that someone with an
agenda will show up. Grad students, perhaps.
Even high schoolers. There has been at least
one sighting of a North American brown
bear.
Second, don't assume tongue. But react
quickly if tongue is offered. If, for instance,
you are interested in that particular method,
parry the other person's tongue with your
own, as if sword fighting. If uninterested,
vigorously bring your teeth down on your
partner's tongue and stare confidently into
his or her eyes as if to say, "Stop screaming."
Third, bring a buddy. FMOTQ gets real
crowded, and it's easy to get lost in a sea of
sweaty strangers. A buddy can provide won
derful support in such arenas as handholding
and advice. That doesn't mean that you
should cling to that person. Go out and meet

new people! And then kiss them. But having
a friend nearby is always a good idea in case
you need rapid-fire judgment on the adequa
cy of your future snog-mate.
Fourth, if you know or even think you
have something infectious, don't spread
your liquid. This is a very simple rule of
thumb, but people still manage to justify
their symptoms as "character." That rash on
your skin? Just a rugburn. That open wound?
It'll close up. If you are exhibiting symptoms
of an acute, infectious illness, wait until next
year. Also — and this is counterintuitive —
don't brush your teeth. The resultant
microabrasions on your gums facilitate dis
ease transfer. And that's not funny. We sat
here and tried to think of a joke, but all we
came up with were sad stories from high
school.

Firth, not everyone is kissable. Some
people don't have lips.
Hut the most important thing is to
remember that this is supposed to tie fun.
What with the stress of classes and all the
radiation, it's easy to lose sight of the simple
pleasure of meeting a stranger in the middle
of one of this country's finest universities
and placing your mouth on theirs. Also, free
hats!
