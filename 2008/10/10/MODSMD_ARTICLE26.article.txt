# FMOTQ: What's a senior girl to do?
## 
### 
The signs of fall are everywhere you look.
Undergrads are back on campus, fresh
men are causing chaos while haltingly
biking through the obstacle course that is the
new White Plaza and on Friday night it rained
for the first time since April. The air is abuzz
with an energy that causes even the most cyni-

cal of upperclassmen to grow wistful. These
first few weeks of fall quarter teem with Stanford tradition, but they all pale in compari
son to the quintessential event of a Stanford autumn: Full Moon on the Quad.
Every year I watch the waxing moon with growing anticipation until finally the night
of the bacchanalia arrives. I remember my freshman year, nervously expecting the stroke
of midnight that would turn the Quad into a frenzy of saliva and Scope. 1 remember shyly
approaching that first mark of the night, feeling a little rebellious, a little scared. In the
back of my mind, there was the lingering fear of contracting mono, but the innocent car
nal fun and the mild titillation were far too thrilling.
Before my first Full Moon, I could've counted all the boys I'd ever kissed on one
hand. Suddenly, in one debauched night, the number increased by several hundred per
cent. While recklessness generally doesn't correlate with great outcomes in the real world,
participating in Full Moon reinforces the carefree eccentricity that sets Stanford apart
from other institutions. That evening in the Quad was one of my first forays out of the
shell I'd built up around myself in high school and a first step towards becoming the far
more balanced person that 1 am today.
Now don't get me wrong, freshman year I made out with lots of people and may or
may not have carried around a personal bottle of mouthwash, kissed the Tree and com
mitted several counts of dormcest, but since then I've been relatively tame. Sophomore
year, not coincidentally the first time that organized fun was added into the Full Moon
mix, I stuck close to my pals, and last year I well undershot the bets of two friends who
speculated on my Full Moon tally, securing some pretty nasty consequences for the loser
of the wager.
That's why this year is it for me. This is my last chance to participate (legitimately, at
least) in the silly, frivolous magic of Full Moon on the Quad as, I'm sorry to say, my days
of frivolity are quickly coming to an end. 1 have to finish a thesis this year. I have to get a
job. I have to move out of the bubble. People with real jobs, that is, jobs they can tell their
grandmothers about, don't get one night a year to freely make out with coworkers sans
consequence.
When I celebrate Full Moon this year, I'm not going to just be making out with
strangers or ogling cuties in body paint — I'm going to be celebrating college itself. This
is my swan song to a university that I love and to the culture of spontaneity and accept
ance that has helped me become the person I am today. So watch out for me in the Quad,
froshies — I'll be the one with the T-shirt that says "Freshman Dorm Bingo."

The similarities are striking. You front
load on booze with all your best friends,
hoping that everyone is just as nervous
as you are and praying you get through the first
time unscathed. You arrive most definitely out
side of the "social zone," thinking maybe it will
wear off just in time for your first midnight

kiss, whereupon the second wave finally hits you, and you make decisions your mother
would most definitely not be proud of. You leave feeling simultaneously exhilarated and
like you've lost a part of yourself you may never find again; and the next day you wake up
wondering just what exactly happened and rely on your friends to fill in all the blank
spots.
It's like four years of college all thrown into one very special night: Full Moon on the
Quad. As I am about to embark on my fourth and final year as a willing participant in
FMOTQ, I'm worried. The unsettling fact is — who haven't I made out with? Being a sen
ior girl poses a whole new set of problems that took me completely unawares.
If you were anything like I was freshman year, you took the whole "college is for
experimenting" mantra as far as it would let you. Now, now, don't get carried away with
your own set of unfulfilled fantasies: There were no ladies, leather or leashes involved in
my experiments, just boys from many different demographics, to say the least. I do not
regret any of my freshman-year or sophomore-year (I was abroad for six months junior
year, it doesn't count) antics; I just worry for the future. If I have already tried my luck on
the selection of eligible men my year and older, what are my choices for senior year? Do I
even have choices senior year? The way I see it, there are three options, and only one of
them sounds like fun.
Option No. 1: enter senior year just like any other year and pray that the competition
has not gotten that much hotter, and if they have, hope to destroy them with my expe
rience and vast collection of witticisms. The possible downside: they are that much
hotter and younger than every other giri and, like I was, much. more, willing.
Option No. 2: enter senior year with your eye on the prize, hoping to seek out a hid
den gem of a man who was easily passed over freshman year but has surprisingly blos
somed into most eligible bachelor numero uno. The possible downside: Mister Hidden
Gem has been in a serious relationship since sophomore year and future plans most defi
nitely include the precious wife-to-be.
Option No. 3: Go primal. Cougars are the most underestimated demographic on col
lege campuses, and by that I mean the hunt for freshmen boys will be about as easy as
walking into the Graduate School of Business with no clothes on. The possible downside:
I might walk into the GSB with no clothes on.
Ah, college. You're innocent, independent and more than anything, incredibly horny.
You have dorm rooms and frat parties galore to make terrible decisions, or great ones,
that ultimately help to discover who you are. Just keep in mind that there is no right or
wrong way to approach college or FMOTQ, just as long as you leave feeling fulfilled and
happy.

The signs of fall are everywhere you look.
Undergrads are back on campus, fresh
men are causing chaos while haltingly
biking through the obstacle course that is the
new White Plaza and on Friday night it rained
for the first time since April. The air is abuzz
with an energy that causes even the most cyni-

cal of upperclassmen to grow wistful. These
first few weeks of fall quarter teem with Stanford tradition, but they all pale in compari
son to the quintessential event of a Stanford autumn: Full Moon on the Quad.
Every year I watch the waxing moon with growing anticipation until finally the night
of the bacchanalia arrives. I remember my freshman year, nervously expecting the stroke
of midnight that would turn the Quad into a frenzy of saliva and Scope. 1 remember shyly
approaching that first mark of the night, feeling a little rebellious, a little scared. In the
back of my mind, there was the lingering fear of contracting mono, but the innocent car
nal fun and the mild titillation were far too thrilling.
Before my first Full Moon, I could've counted all the boys I'd ever kissed on one
hand. Suddenly, in one debauched night, the number increased by several hundred per
cent. While recklessness generally doesn't correlate with great outcomes in the real world,
participating in Full Moon reinforces the carefree eccentricity that sets Stanford apart
from other institutions. That evening in the Quad was one of my first forays out of the
shell I'd built up around myself in high school and a first step towards becoming the far
more balanced person that 1 am today.
Now don't get me wrong, freshman year I made out with lots of people and may or
may not have carried around a personal bottle of mouthwash, kissed the Tree and com
mitted several counts of dormcest, but since then I've been relatively tame. Sophomore
year, not coincidentally the first time that organized fun was added into the Full Moon
mix, I stuck close to my pals, and last year I well undershot the bets of two friends who
speculated on my Full Moon tally, securing some pretty nasty consequences for the loser
of the wager.
That's why this year is it for me. This is my last chance to participate (legitimately, at
least) in the silly, frivolous magic of Full Moon on the Quad as, I'm sorry to say, my days
of frivolity are quickly coming to an end. 1 have to finish a thesis this year. I have to get a
job. I have to move out of the bubble. People with real jobs, that is, jobs they can tell their
grandmothers about, don't get one night a year to freely make out with coworkers sans
consequence.
When I celebrate Full Moon this year, I'm not going to just be making out with
strangers or ogling cuties in body paint — I'm going to be celebrating college itself. This
is my swan song to a university that I love and to the culture of spontaneity and accept
ance that has helped me become the person I am today. So watch out for me in the Quad,
froshies — I'll be the one with the T-shirt that says "Freshman Dorm Bingo."

The similarities are striking. You front
load on booze with all your best friends,
hoping that everyone is just as nervous
as you are and praying you get through the first
time unscathed. You arrive most definitely out
side of the "social zone," thinking maybe it will
wear off just in time for your first midnight

kiss, whereupon the second wave finally hits you, and you make decisions your mother
would most definitely not be proud of. You leave feeling simultaneously exhilarated and
like you've lost a part of yourself you may never find again; and the next day you wake up
wondering just what exactly happened and rely on your friends to fill in all the blank
spots.
It's like four years of college all thrown into one very special night: Full Moon on the
Quad. As I am about to embark on my fourth and final year as a willing participant in
FMOTQ, I'm worried. The unsettling fact is — who haven't I made out with? Being a sen
ior girl poses a whole new set of problems that took me completely unawares.
If you were anything like I was freshman year, you took the whole "college is for
experimenting" mantra as far as it would let you. Now, now, don't get carried away with
your own set of unfulfilled fantasies: There were no ladies, leather or leashes involved in
my experiments, just boys from many different demographics, to say the least. I do not
regret any of my freshman-year or sophomore-year (I was abroad for six months junior
year, it doesn't count) antics; I just worry for the future. If I have already tried my luck on
the selection of eligible men my year and older, what are my choices for senior year? Do I
even have choices senior year? The way I see it, there are three options, and only one of
them sounds like fun.
Option No. 1: enter senior year just like any other year and pray that the competition
has not gotten that much hotter, and if they have, hope to destroy them with my expe
rience and vast collection of witticisms. The possible downside: they are that much
hotter and younger than every other giri and, like I was, much. more, willing.
Option No. 2: enter senior year with your eye on the prize, hoping to seek out a hid
den gem of a man who was easily passed over freshman year but has surprisingly blos
somed into most eligible bachelor numero uno. The possible downside: Mister Hidden
Gem has been in a serious relationship since sophomore year and future plans most defi
nitely include the precious wife-to-be.
Option No. 3: Go primal. Cougars are the most underestimated demographic on col
lege campuses, and by that I mean the hunt for freshmen boys will be about as easy as
walking into the Graduate School of Business with no clothes on. The possible downside:
I might walk into the GSB with no clothes on.
Ah, college. You're innocent, independent and more than anything, incredibly horny.
You have dorm rooms and frat parties galore to make terrible decisions, or great ones,
that ultimately help to discover who you are. Just keep in mind that there is no right or
wrong way to approach college or FMOTQ, just as long as you leave feeling fulfilled and
happy.
