# MUSiC PREVIEW
## The
						Roots, Estelle and Gym Class Heroes come to town 
### 
On the face of it, The Roots, Gym Class Heroes and Estelle
seem like an odd trio. But look past the labels and it's
clear what they have in common: all three artists meld
genres to create their own eclectic funkiness. Both The Roots and
Estelle draw on pre-hip-hop influences like soul, rock and jazz to
shape their unique visions of hip-hop. Gym Class Heroes, mean
while, uses '70s and '80s pop hooks as the centerpiece of their rap
rock-disco approach. Moreover, all three acts are fun — upbeat,
stylish and catchy — and will be performing together in at the
Event Center at San Jose State on Oct. 18.
The Roots, of course, deal lyrically with some thoughtful
themes but filter this weightiness through maximum groove factor

Much of their groove
appeal is their live band
approach; instead of just
standing around rapping
with their samples boom
ing, The Roots have a full
lineup of rapper (Black
Thought), drums (?uest
love), bassist (Hub) a sec
ond rapper (Malik B) and

a even a human beat box
(Rahzel the Godfather of
Noise). They'll likely play
songs from their new
album "Rising Down,"
tunes that they didn't play
