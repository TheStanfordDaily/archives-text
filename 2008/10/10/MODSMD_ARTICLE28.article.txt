# MUSiC PREVIEW
## The 						Roots, Estelle and Gym Class Heroes come to town 
### 
On the face of it, The Roots, Gym Class Heroes and Estelle
seem like an odd trio. But look past the labels and it's
clear what they have in common: all three artists meld
genres to create their own eclectic funkiness. Both The Roots and
Estelle draw on pre-hip-hop influences like soul, rock and jazz to
shape their unique visions of hip-hop. Gym Class Heroes, mean
while, uses '70s and '80s pop hooks as the centerpiece of their rap
rock-disco approach. Moreover, all three acts are fun — upbeat,
stylish and catchy — and will be performing together in at the
Event Center at San Jose State on Oct. 18.
The Roots, of course, deal lyrically with some thoughtful
themes but filter this weightiness through maximum groove factor

Much of their groove
appeal is their live band
approach; instead of just
standing around rapping
with their samples boom
ing, The Roots have a full
lineup of rapper (Black
Thought), drums (?uest
love), bassist (Hub) a sec
ond rapper (Malik B) and

a even a human beat box
(Rahzel the Godfather of
Noise). They'll likely play
songs from their new
album "Rising Down,"
tunes that they didn't play

Event Center

last year at their concert on campus.
Estelle is an up-and-coming female
singer from the U.K. Her spring 2008 album
"Shine" is a wildly varied affair, featuring
reggae-tinged pop, more traditional
American hip-hop and even jazzy funk.
"American Boy," her stateside hit prominent
ly featuring Kanye West and produced by
will.i.am, is a bright, slithering ode to
America and its men (and also a clever
attempt to get a hit song in America).
Strummed chords ring out over dance beats
as Estelle begs, "Take me on trip, I'd like to
go someday/Take me to New York, I'd love to
see L.A."
Other than her unfortunate choice of
going to L.A., Estelle's music makes some
great choices: "Wait a Minute Just a Touch" is
built around big band-style horns, Estelle's
sexually teasing rap and a Beyonce-like hook.
"No Substitute Love" references the melody
of George Michael's hit "Faith" while crafting
its own raspy Motown vocals. Overall, the
British singer takes a range of styles, unleash
es them with her silky voice and creates
something fresh.

Gym Class Heroes, on the other hand,
straddle the line between retro fun and bla
tant rip-off. Gym Class Heroes elude catego
rization. They combine emo, hip-hop and
pop, but mostly with other people's hooks.
The biggest hits by Gym Class Heroes,
"Cupid's Chokehold" and "Clothes Off)" are
slickly produced rehashes of the hooks from
1979's hit "Breakfast in America" by
Supertramp and Jermaine Stewart's 1986 hit
"We Don't Have to Take Our Clothes Off."
(Though, in defense of the Heroes, they
changed the premise to "We (do) have to take
our clothes off.. . " Kanye West at least
avoids stealing his samples from songs' cho
ruses.)
The more interesting dimension to Gym
Class Heroes is their multi-racial blend of
emo and rap. The lead singer of Fallout Boy
makes regular singing appearances, and the
band has a skater-meets-rapper style to
them. In the end, the band is catchy but
frothy — they lack the substance of The
Roots or Estelle.
