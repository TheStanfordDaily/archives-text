# MUSiC REVIEW
## Kings of Leon ditch garage rocker sound 
### 
The Kings of Leon are the new Kings of
England. The Tennessee indie rock
band's new album "Only By the
Night" has sat atop the English pop charts for
several weeks, bringing in the year's second
highest debut sales for the country. (It was
the band's second No. 1 album over there.)
Simultaneously, the Kings' lead single, "Sex
on Fire" has ruled the UK's singles charts.
The influential "NME" Magazine devotes
weekly space to promote the group, and now
British music fans can even name individual
members of the group. The scruffy band has
successfully tapped into the UK's thriving
market for fashionable young bands clad in
skinny jeans.
In the U.S., however, the Kings of Leon
remain a trendy niche band. They debuted at
a respectable but unimpressive No. 25 on the
charts. (Unimpressive, that is, compared to
their fellow indie bands like The Shins,
Modest Mouse and Arcade Fire, who all have
scored top-two albums since 2006.) True, the
band has appeared on "Saturday Night Live"
and"The Late Show," and has been featured
in car commercials and movies, but their
underground U.S. coolness is in sharp con-

trast to their English übiquity.
Part of the Kings' appeal to the Brits is
new British influences: In "Only By the
Night," Kings of Leon complete their transi
tion from a country-influenced garage band
to a slickly produced composer of' Bos
anthems. Far from coincidentally, the Kings
opened in 2004 for The Strokes — the proto
type for the current "garage" trend — and
then transitioned in 2005 for U2 — the long
standing prototype for arena rock. Now,
instead of loose and twangy post-punk tunes,
Kings of Leon bang out textured, soaring
songs filled with effects. "Closer," the album
opener, is built around a spacey, delayed gui
tar riff that is like U2's "Mysterious Ways"
stripped of its pep and slowed to a plod.
Later in the album, "Notion" hits more of a
"Joshua Tree" vibe: a heavy, stuttered drum
beat paired with shimmering guitars. On the
whole, the Kings of Leon's transition is not
necessarily a bad change, just a comparatively
boring change. Their songs mostly lack the
spit-shined, post-punk thrills of earlier
efforts. With one exception, that is.
The lead single "Sex on Fire" single
handedly redeems the album; it is the Kings'

best pop song yet. The tune builds tension
with the insistent repetition of high guitar
notes and ska-inflected chords. Caleb
Followill's lead vocals then add a rattled ten
sion that interplays perfectly with the guitar.
Gradually, Kings of Leon quicken the pace,
building the song's urgency, until they
explode into a sexual panic: "Yooouuuu /
Your sex is on fii-rre." The extended "you" is
the song's emotional core and memorable
pop hook. It is part plea, part catharsis and
part celebratory howl. The band's music
video visualizes these animalistic emotions
well: it depicts Caleb and the others in a
feverish, tortured state of waiting, alone in a
room, eating food, screaming and showing
off their toned arms. At least for this track,
the Kings of Leon are indie rock's tortured
lovers. The other standout tracks arc a bit
more straightforward.
In two songs, Kings of Leon's addition of
atmospherics add new depth to their song
catalogue. "Use Somebody" has an epic,
melodic female vocal line reminiscent of
MB3's "Don't Save Us From the Flames," and
a catchy breakdown. Also, its more ponder
ous plea for the human touch ("I could use

somebody") is a nicc thcmatic contrast to the
more visceral "Sex on Fire" (which could be
summarized as "I want you bad, now").
Finally, the next track, "Manhattan," is driven
by a buoyant but restrained bass line that
adds to the track's bittersweet mood. Indeed,
at both these songs' cores is an appealingly
confused melancholy. It is an emotion much
better articulated by their new sound.
Kings of Leon have successfully made
the leap across the pond, in both popularity
and musical style. Gone are the rebellious
Southern garage rockers. Certainly at times
on "Only By the Night," the listener will miss
their pluck. At other times, however, the lis
tener will be delighted by their newly con
templative style.
