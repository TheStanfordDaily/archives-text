# Debating the Director's Cup
## 
### 
Tomorrow during halftime at
Stanford's homecoming game
against Arizona, the Cardinal
will be honored for winning its 14th
consecutive National Association of
Collegiate Directors of Athletics
(NACDA) Director's Cup trophy.
For those who do not know what
the Director's Cup is, it's an award
given annually to the best overall
athletic program in the country.
Points are awarded based on order of
finish at the end of the season — KM)
points to the National Champion in a
sport, 90 points to the national run
ner-up, etc. Though there are modifi
cations of scoring for some sports,
the general gist is the same: the bet
ter you do, the more points you get.
Both men's and women's sports
contribute to the competition.The 10
highest-scoring men's sports and the
10 highest-scoring women's sports
from each school are used to compile
the total number of points the school
receives.
For the past 14 years, the combi
nation of Stanford men's and
women's sports has been the best in
the nation. Stanford did come in sec
ond to North Carolina the very first
year the award was given (1994). But
since then. Cardinal sports have
dominated the NCAA Division I
sports scene.

gant or brag, but I do enjoy winning

these Cups. They're representative
of us as a university.
Schools like USC, Texas, UCLA.
Michigan and North Carolina are
usually among the rest of the names
behind Stanford in the final stand
ings. These schools are also high
level athletic and academic institu
tions, competing with Stanford on
the field and in recruiting. They win
just as many NCAA Championships
as we do year-in and year-out and
have very good and historic athletic
programs.
But unlike them, Stanford has
more depth. The Cardinal has the
hardware and they don't. Our con

secutive years of winning emphasize
the University's and Department of
Athletics' constant commitment to
excellence.
So should we start calling Stan
ford a college sports dynasty? The
recent years' performance of the
football team has painted a false pic
ture of Stanford athletics to the rest
of the world. What others fail to real
ize is that football is just one sport,
however hard that may be for them
to believe.The underachievement of
some "big time" sports is masking
the achievement and accomplish
ments of the rest of the program.
But as much as it seems Stanford
should revel in this feat once again,
there are many contrasting opinions
out there about the true worth of the
Cup now that the 14th trophy will
enter Stanford's Hall of Fame. Is it
possible that the prestige of this

award has been tarnished because
we win it too much?
Some arguments focus on the
numbers: because Stanford has
many more varsity sports than other
schools, they have a better chance of
gaining top finishes and accumulat
ing a lot of points. This claim does
have validity when you compare the
Cardinal's 34 Varsity sports to (JSC's
19, Michigan's 27 and UCLA's 22.
But have the people posing this
question looked at who is actually
scoring the points for Stanford every
year? The majority of the points are
coming from sports that most every
other competing school has: volley
ball, cross-country, track and field,
basketball, tennis, baseball, softball
and golf.
Others argue that Stanford has a
huge scholarship endowment, so the
school is able to make great offers to

high-profile athletes. But don't get
trapped into this one — don't forget,
on the flip side, how many great ath
letes have been denied admission to
Stanford because of the school's high
academic standards and the rigorous
and challenging admission process.
As you can see, there are many dif
fering opinions on this matter.
On Saturday, we should honor the
Director's Cup with pride and satis
faction, knowing that it's the entire
Stanford atmosphere that con
tributes to our winning ways. We are
headed for No. 15 this year, and I
don't think any of these questionable
opinions will stop the athletes from
continuing to succeed.
