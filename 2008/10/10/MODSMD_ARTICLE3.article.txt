# Debating the Director's Cup
## 
### 
Tomorrow during halftime at
Stanford's homecoming game
against Arizona, the Cardinal
will be honored for winning its 14th
consecutive National Association of
Collegiate Directors of Athletics
(NACDA) Director's Cup trophy.
For those who do not know what
the Director's Cup is, it's an award
given annually to the best overall
athletic program in the country.
Points are awarded based on order of
finish at the end of the season â€” KM)
points to the National Champion in a
sport, 90 points to the national run
ner-up, etc. Though there are modifi
cations of scoring for some sports,
the general gist is the same: the bet
ter you do, the more points you get.
Both men's and women's sports
contribute to the competition.The 10
highest-scoring men's sports and the
10 highest-scoring women's sports
from each school are used to compile
the total number of points the school
receives.
For the past 14 years, the combi
nation of Stanford men's and
women's sports has been the best in
the nation. Stanford did come in sec
ond to North Carolina the very first
year the award was given (1994). But
since then. Cardinal sports have
dominated the NCAA Division I
sports scene.
I am usually not one to be arro
gant or brag, but I do enjoy winning
