# Among Strange Notes, Branford Marsalis and the Philarmonia Brasileira
## 
### 
The Philarmonia Brasileira — a legion of 32 musicians
in black suits — took their seats in a semi-circle on the
stage of Memorial Auditorium. This was their third
stop between Seattle and Modesto, Calif, on a 40-day tour —
the longest tour ever done in the United States by a Brazilian
orchestra. Most of these musicians divide their time between
quartets, sextets, duos and other bands back home in Brazil;
they meet with the Philarmonia by commission. Their con
ductor, Gil Jardim, had changed the order of the program 15

minutes before they took the stage. Nevertheless, they walked
on stage Sunday afternoon with a dedicated, stern focus.
The Philarmonia Brasileira brought scores by Brazilian
composer Heitor Villa-Lobos (1887-1959) and French com
poser Darius Milhaud (1892-1974) to campus for last week
end's performance, sponsored by Lively Arts. Villa-Lobos'
scores are reminiscent of Stravinsky — peppy and anxious,
with a smattering of percussive notes at different tones —
though, at times, they can open up to a Bach-like melody.
When he created "Bachianas Brasileiras," Villa-Lobos used
techniques inspired by Milhaud and Paris, but for his
rhythms, he had in mind the birds of Brazilian neighbor
hoods, making the music markedly Brazilian. There is no
consistent rhythm, just a skipping syncopation, and pauses
are rare.
To accentuate the rhythms, Jardim jabbed at the air, elic
iting the contrapuntal sounds. The string section interjected
over the brass section; it challenged the thread of melody
because there was no consistent beat. Their notes, mostly
quarter notes, were never longer than a few seconds. The
notes faded out with a vibrato. The breathing space slipped
between notes like a ball through a pinball machine.
The star of the show was Branford Marsalis. The
acclaimed New Orleans jazz musician came out in a charcoal
suit and took the spotlight. Marsalis is a versatile showman,
having completed a two-year stint as the musical director of
The Tonight Show with lay Leno. It wasn't until late in the
show, however, that Marsalis broke the ice when he asked the
conductor, "Want me to go over there?" He walked right
through the violinists and broke their formal stiffness. The
audience chuckled. "Yeah, I like it better over here," he
remarked.
Thus Marsalis and pianist Heloisa Pinto were intimately
set for "Scaramouche for Saxophone (alto) and piano," com
posed by Milhaud. Marsalis' golden saxophone glowed below

the sheen of his bald
brown head and
puffed cheeks. I le was
the one musician on
stage with no sheet
music — his eyes were
closed and his eye-

brows were furled with the look of calm consternation. Pinto
plucked the keys to echo Marsalis, his tune reminiscent of a
nursery rhyme. Then, Marsalis reclaimed center-stage. His
melody carried on a love affair with the flute, as they vacillated
between two adjacent notes.
Boris, the German sitting next to me, had his chin on his
fist and his eyes closed in meditation. During the intermis
sion, Boris told me that this music reminded him of the late
Romanian composer, Sergiu Celibidache's ichi-go ichi-e phi
losophy; that the conditions of a live concert can create an
optimal milieu for a transcendental experience. The pianissi
mo quality of the music created that magic for him. The
strange notes remained contained at a soft volume. They
were neither harsh nor sweet, and they skipped about to give
us constantly changing melodies.
For the last piece, when Marsalis came out with a clar
inet and led the orchestra in a Broadway-like tune with the
tambourine of a snake charmer, Boris and other audience
members had eyes wide open. They couldn't help but shim
my their shoulders and bounce their heads. This wasn't not
exactly jazz music — there were no scats or improvised
melodies, and with the exception of the sparing use of
bongo drums, it didn't exactly transport the Palo Alto crowd
to rural Brazil. The light contrapuntal notes kept us on edge.
When they mellowed out, they gave us rare moments of
rhapsody.
