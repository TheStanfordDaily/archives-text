# LiT REVIEW
## Gaiman channels Kipling in his latest novel "The Graveyard Book" 
### 
CCt' takes a graveyard to raise a child," fellow author
I Audrey Niffenegger aptly remarks on the back
A cover. "The Graveyard Book" is the tale of a little
hoy "who is adopted by dead people and taught all the
things that dead people know," author Neil Gaiman said at
a reading for the book in Palo Alto last Saturday. The latest
of his many widely acclaimed novels, "The Graveyard
Book" is marketed as young adult fiction, but as with his
previous works, it holds great appeal for readers of all ages.
One cannot help falling in love with the endearing pro
tagonist, bod (short for Nobody) Owens. The book's eight
chapters, more a collection of short stories than a traditional
novel, chronicle his very unique childhood, from his adop
tive parents, the late Owenses, his undead guardian Silas and
the werewolf Miss Lupescu, to encounters with ghouls,
policemen and the bullies at the local school he attempts to
attend. He learns to read (tombstone inscriptions) and do
sums (birth and death years), but also to Haunt and Fade
and Dreamwalk. It is a delightful talc; 1 found myself rooting
for Bod with every page, cheering his triumphs.
The single blemish in this otherwise outstanding novel
(besides that the tale came to an end, of course) is that the
antagonists are more cardboard cut-outs than fleshed out

characters. The man lack and the larger organization
responsible for the murder of Bod's biological parents are
not really characters at all, despite a thrilling confrontation
at the end that would suggest otherwise, but this does not
detract terribly from the story; a tcrrifyingly vague evil, the
specter of bloody murder and Silas's well-meaning reti
cence seem for the most part a consequence of Bod's shel
tered life in the graveyard and the overall tone of the book.

Palo Alto marked
Caiman's fifth stop on
an ambitious book tour
across the U.S. to pro
mote "The Graveyard
Book," reading a chap
ter and answering ques
tions at each destina
tion. Gaiman is as capa
ble a speaker as he is a
writer — and he is a
brilliant writer. His
accent, a quaint amalga
mation of England and
Minnesota, exuded the

enthusiasm, charm and gentle — if
not peculiar — humor that char
acterizes his prose. That he records
the majority of his own audio
books should not come as a sur
prise.
According to Gaiman, "The

Graveyard Book" has waited to be
written for more than 20 years; it borrows heavily from
Kipling's masterpiece, "The Jungle Book," but was inspired
by his now-adult son, who as a toddler rode a tricycle
between the gravestones at a cemetery near their home.
Gaiman said that "The Graveyard Book" had been simmer
ing on his back burner for over two decades, waiting until
he became a better writer. Meanwhile, of course, he pro
duced the bcstselling "American Gods,""Anansi Boys,"
"Stardust" and "Coraline," among other works, as well as
the "Sandman" comics — one of the best-known, most
influential graphic novels of all time. But "The Graveyard
Book," born at last, may be Gaiman's greatest work yet.
