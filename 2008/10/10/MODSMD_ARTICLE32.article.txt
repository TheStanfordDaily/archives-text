# Shut up and kiss me

### 
Seal was kissed by a rose on the grey. Prince just
wants your kiss. Katy Perry kissed a girl, and you'll
never believe this, but {gasp!) she liked it. And on
October 14, all of you gorgeous Stanford students better
throw down your pencils and problem sets for some
lusty lip lockage by the light of the full moon, because
you might be on Roxy's kissing agenda.
We've been pent up in our rooms for the first few
weeks of school, hunched over laptops, stressed, sup
pressed, untouched, untasted! Oh, the waste! Now it's
time to unleash that caged sexual beast and explore the
great kissable unknown of Stanford's wild ter-

rain. Full Moon on the Quad, here we
come!
But a gigantic kissing orgy comes
with complications. Not everybody is
worthy of your sumptuous smooch.
Getting tangled up in a bad kiss can
ruin a great night in the flick of a /
tongue, so here are a couple of tips
for avoiding the thorns in the mostly
flower-filled Stanford jungle.

Avoiding the bad-un's

Dazed and elated, you emerge from yet another
fabulous kiss when suddenly, out of the corner of your
eye, you see a thorn approaching. Danger! Rapid action
must be taken before the offender dives upon your face!
What do you do? It's simple: run away. Unlike a rat
tlesnake, which attacks running prey, FMOTQ offenders
tend to have terrible reflexes. Chances are he or she is
mildly to extremely intoxicated and will not be able to
process your sudden disappearance. Sprint, leap, dive

into the human void, and keep your eyes peeled for a
safe, attractive face to attach yourself to.
Extrication
Oooh, this person looks cute! He or she goes in for
a kiss, your lips touch, they part. Then something goes
terribly wrong. Terribly, terribly wrong. A helicopter
tongue? A limp noodle? A mouth eater? If any or all of
these things, you've encountered a thorn in disguise and
must escape before your face is permanently violated!
Extrication Tactic #1: Flan in advance. Bad kiss

entrapment is a likely possibility, so it's a good idea

to have a plan and a friend nearby to act quickly if

necessary. Practice secret gestures that can be
made in the throes of a thorn-attack so that

I your friend is immediately notified of your
>, predicament. What your friend says and does to
save you is open to creativity. Just try not to be

too mean.
Extrication Tactic #2: Be vocal. Some people just

need education. This person has probably had very
little kissing experience and could use your guidance. Be
brave, but be delicate — instead of focusing on the neg
ative, explain what your companion could do to
improve. If he or she gets angry, just scram. It's not your
loss, but chances are that person will learn a few things
and be utterly grateful. And you won't just be helping
one person — think of the potentially hundreds of peo
ple your companion will kiss in his or her lifetime who
won't have to suffer like you did. Now that's charity.
