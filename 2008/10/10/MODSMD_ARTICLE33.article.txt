# FiNE ART REVIEW
## Goltzius on display 
### 
As a prelude to the Cantor
Center's planned exhibit,
"Hendrick Goltzius: Promised
Gifts from the Kirk Long Collection,"
which opens in December, the muse
um has displayed in the center of its
European painting gallery a modest
but rich sampling of prints produced
by the group of artists that collaborat
ed with and were influenced by the
Dutch master Hendrik Goltzius
(1558-1617).
Organized from Cantor's own
holdings with several pieces on loan,
this exhibit of nineteen prints called
"Goltzius and His Circle" skillfully sit
uates the Mannerist printmaker with
in the artistic milieu of the late six
teenth century and early seventeenth
century Netherlands. The exhibit,
whether unknowingly or knowingly,
also shows the trajectory of Goltzius's
career as we are introduced to the
work of both Goltzius's teachers and
pupils.
Represented here are artists within
Goltzius's immediate circle, many of
whom were responsible for jumpstart
ing his career as a printmaker. The
Haarlemer Philips Galle, for example,
gave Goltzius his first ever commis
sion. Here we have the opportunity to
see Galle's fanciful allegorical series
"The Four Elements" (1564), which

depicts earth, air, fire and water as per
sonified by Greek gods. Also present
are prints by Jan Muller, Goltzius's
son-in-law who was charged with
managing his printing studio after the
master turned to painting in the
15905.
Indeed, one of the standout pieces
of this exhibit is Muller's extraordi
nary "Belshazzar's Feast" (1598).
Inspired by Tintoretto's "Last Supper"
in Venice (1594), Muller's print evi
dences the remarkable range of tonali
ty and chiaroscuro made possible by
contemporary engraving techniques.
Muller's virtuosity with the burin, the
implement used to incise lines into
copperplate, allowed him to explore
the shifting effects of light. In
"Belshazzar's Feast," a fleeting,
ephemeral light radiates from a ceiling
lamp onto the animated faces of the
feasters. Muller's success, it seems, is in
creating a light so real that, at any
moment, it seems it could disappear.
To this exhibit, Muller also con
tributes the series "Rape of the Sabine
Women" (1598), which reveals the
extent of the mannerist style passed
down from his father-in-law. Like
Goltzius's famous print of the
"Farnese Hercules" (1592) in which
we are put in the position of spectator,
Muller's three prints allow the viewer

to understand the kinesthetic experi
ence of mannerist sculpture. The three
varying profiles suggest the impor
tance of unimpeded movement
around sculpture so that no single
view goes unseen. Significant too is
the mannerist representation of
human anatomy that Muller learned
from Goltzius — the bulging, knobby
musculature and severely dispropor
tionate limbs of both figures con
tribute toward a heightened sense of
theatricality.
Of the four works by Goltzius
included in this exhibit, "The
Adoration of the Shepherds," an unfin
ished work from 1598, is particularly
stunning. In its unfinished state we
glimpse the intricate technical process
es that Goltzius mastered. Joseph's
foreshortened hand, which clasps a
candle, seems to extend out of the pic
ture plane, nearly touching us. The
light from the candle delicately flickers
on the faces of the Holy Family, an
effect of chiaroscuro that Goltzius
mastered in many other works.
The circle of artists that taught
Goltzius many of these techniques and
the subsequent generation of followers
is well represented in this exhibit. That
the exhibit is located in the gallery of
European painting makes for interest
ing visual comparisons between, for
instance, Goltzius's Italianate "Holy
Family with John the Baptist as a
Child" (1593) and a painting by
Domenico di Bartolomeo Übaldini,
"Madonna and Child with St. John the

Baptist as an Angel," from earlier in
the century (1520).
The Cantor Center is fortunate to
have been promised the collection of
Kirk Edward Long, and the forthcom
ing exhibit in December will hopefully
more fully illuminate the extent of this
master's genius.
"Goltzius and His Circle" is at the
Cantor Center for the Arts, 328 Lomita
Drive (650-723-4177) through March
15, 2009."Hendrick Goltzius: Promised
Gifts from the Kirk Long Collection"
opens at the Cantor Center Dec. 17,
2008 and runs through March 29, 2009.
