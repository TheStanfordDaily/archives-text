# FiLM REVIEW
## A 						predictable story with heart 
### 
cc 112 | Express" tells the true life story of Ernie
Davis, the first African American in history to
JL win the Heisman Trophy. Like all biography
movies, the film starts off by showing Ernie's early life. As a
child he has an amazing knack for running and, when he is
old enough, joins his town's local football team, where —
surprise surprise — he's amazing. Ernie's love for football
grows, and in his high school years he gets approached and
recruited by head coach Ben Schwartzwalder (Dennis Quaid)
of Syracuse University.
From here on out, the film progresses in a not-so-sur
prisingly predictable manner. After being recruited to
Syracuse, Ernie immediately begins to make his mark on the
team. Of course, the term "mark" here is probably an under
statement because the film portrays Ernie as a football god
who is practically unstoppable on the field and scores touch
downs like they were second nature to him. With Ernie,
played by small time actor Rob Brown, on their team,

Syracuse has an undefeated season that culminates in a final
championship showdown against the University of Texas.
Up to this point in the film, everything is as one would
expect. Ernie eventually earns the respect of his racist school
and teammates, all the while leading his team from victory to
victory. Thankfully, the overall ordinariness of the movie is
rescued by the third act, which consists primarily of the
showdown against Texas. This game is refreshingly intense,
throwing in heart-wrenching elements of racism. Even
though I am sure you can guess who wins, the fact that so
much more than a trophy was riding on this game makes
Ernie's win all the more satisfying. These mushy, heartwarm
ing feelings continue after the game when Ernie finally claims
his rightful place in history when he accepts the Heisman
Trophy award — a scene that I will admit even got me a little
choked up.

I will not spoil what ultimately
happens at the conclusion of the
movie, but 1 will say that every
thing comes full circle and ties up
quite nicely. I personally did not
know what to expect from the end

ing (not having known anything
about Ernie Davis to begin with), which greatly enhanced the
experience for me.
"The Express" relies on a tried and true formula of sto
rytelling, focusing on the life of a great person. However,
even though Ernie's life was indeed interesting, it did not
necessarily translate as such on film. The story ends up
focusing too much on Ernie's winning streak (which gets
boring fast), instead of playing up the other elements going
on during this time period, i.e. issues of racism and segrega
tion. Since the focus of the film was clearly just on football,
the characters also came off as one-dimensional for a good
majority of the film. Ernie was sweet and kind-hearted, but
we barely got to see his off-the-field personality.
Critiques aside, one cannot argue that this film means
well. Ernie Davis' story is truly inspiring and touching —
captured quite well in the film's final act, where all of the pre
viously mentioned problems seem to get rectified. At least for
"The Express," the end certainly justifies the means, making
this movie a ride ultimately worth taking.
