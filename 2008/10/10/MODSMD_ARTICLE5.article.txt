## Searching for clearer skies Cardinal looks to get back on track against SDSU and UCLA this weekend 
### JACOB JOHNSON DESK EDITOR 
Last weekend rained on Stanford's parade — lit
erally and figuratively.
The Stanford men's soccer team opened Pac-10
play last weekend with optimism and great energy.
After losing three games in a row. the men knew they
needed at least one win — and they were confident
they were going to get it.They took on Washington in
Seattle on Friday before traveling to Corvallis. Ore.
on Sunday.
Hie overcast skies and constant rain that greeted
Stanford on Friday night created an ominous hack
drop for the beginning of an important stretch for the
team. Yet it was depressingly appropriate for the sea
son thus far, one that began with so many sunny ex
pectations and has resulted in so much disappoint
ment and frustration.
Friday was more of the same,a 1 -0 loss. The 1 luskies
didn't score until the 77th minute, and the Stanford
men were unable to find the net. Although the loss all
hut ended their post-season hopes, Stanford knew a
win at OSU would keep their chances alive.
But the rain followed the Cardinal to Corvallis,
and they could only manage a tie against the feisty
Beavers.
Stanford's poor record has doomed them to rela
tive obscurity this year,especially with the phenome

nal success of their counterparts — the women's soc
cer team remains undefeated this season, the only
blemish on their record being a 1-1 tie with No. 3
North Carolina on Sept. 12.
The men try not to pay attention to what others are
saying.They don't look for attention around campus
— and they certainly don't read what is written about
them in print.
When asked about The Daily's story, published
Monday, that summarized Stanford's Pac-10 opener,
junior midfielder Thiago Sa Freire shook his head.
"I didn't even look at it."he said. "Soccer isn't
going too well right now."
Although its postseason dreams may be gone, the
Cardinal can partially salvage the season with a good
showing in the Pac-10.Tliey can start building positive
momentum this weekend,as they take on San Diego
State on Friday and UCLA on Sunday. Both will be
home games for the Cardinal, although Laird Q.
Cagan Stadium has not been friendly to the home
team — Stanford is 1-3 at home this year. The con
tests will begin at 4:30 p.m. and 2:30 p.m., respectively.
Admission is free to students.
San Diego State has also struggled this season, and
enters Friday's contest with an overall record of 2-5-1.
In their only Pac-10 action so far. they tied UCLA.
A perennial Pac-10 power, the Bruins have had an
up-and-down season.They will play Cal on Friday be
fore coming to Palo Alto to take on the Cardinal Sun
day.The Bruins record stands at 2-3-s,and their match
against the Aztecs has been their only action in the
Pac-10 thus far.
