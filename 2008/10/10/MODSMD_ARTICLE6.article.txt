## 
### JACK SALISBURY DESK EDITOR 
Homecoming games are typically
scheduled against weaker oppo
nents— what's the point of alumni
coming back if the football team is
going to lose?
Stanford (3-3, 2-1 Pac-10) might
have had that in mind when it sched
uled Arizona, a traditional Pac-10
doormat, for this Saturday's home
coming game. The Wildcats missed
the memo somewhere along the
way. though.
Arizona comes into tomorrow's 2
p.m. game at Stanford Stadium rid
ing its best start in years — the Wild
cats are 4-1 and are averaging 43
points a game behind the arm of sen
ior quarterback Willie Tuitama.
"As an offense we have to be pre
pared to outscore them, so whatever
that takes," said sophomore running
back Toby Gerhart.
"It's a big challenge," said senior
safety Bo McNally. "TUitama is an
experienced OB and he does a lot of
good things. All we need to do is
focus on us."
The Wildcats' defense also pres
ents a challenge, as both players and
coaches cited Arizona's speed.
"[They've got] speed."said senior
center Alex Fletcher. "Arizona al
ways has a top three defense [in the
Pac-10]. The reason I say that is just
the overall speed. Coach Stoops has
a really good defense, a fast defense
and a physical defense. It's going to
be a challenge, and they play hard."
"Team speed." said offensive co
ordinator David Shaw, who filled in
for coach Jim Harbaugh at this
week's press conference (Harbaugh
missed the conference after his wife
gave birth to a baby girl at 3 a.m. on
Tuesday). "They're very active. It's
not just one player, it's an entire
team."
Though Arizona has certainly
been impressive in its first five
games of the season, its schedule has

from reaching a bowl game, Saturday's
match-up with the Wildcats is as close to a
must-win as it gets if the team is to become
bowl eligible. Arizona comes into the game

cats haven't played a team over .500
yet. The Wildcats' only loss of the
season came to New Mexico, which
is 3-3 on the year.
Stanford comes into the game as
a slight underdog, hut hopes to get a
morale boost from the energy of
Homecoming Weekend.
"I'd love some home cooking in
any way, shape or form that we can
find," Shaw said. "We've got stu
