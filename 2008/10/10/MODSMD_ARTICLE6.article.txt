# Cardinal ready to take on 4-1 Arizona for Homecoming
## 
### JACK SALISBURY DESK EDITOR 
Homecoming games are typically
scheduled against weaker oppo
nents— what's the point of alumni
coming back if the football team is
going to lose?
Stanford (3-3, 2-1 Pac-10) might
have had that in mind when it sched
uled Arizona, a traditional Pac-10
doormat, for this Saturday's home
coming game. The Wildcats missed
the memo somewhere along the
way. though.
Arizona comes into tomorrow's 2
p.m. game at Stanford Stadium rid
ing its best start in years — the Wild
cats are 4-1 and are averaging 43
points a game behind the arm of sen
ior quarterback Willie Tuitama.
"As an offense we have to be pre
pared to outscore them, so whatever
that takes," said sophomore running
back Toby Gerhart.
"It's a big challenge," said senior
safety Bo McNally. "TUitama is an
experienced OB and he does a lot of
good things. All we need to do is
focus on us."
The Wildcats' defense also pres
ents a challenge, as both players and
coaches cited Arizona's speed.
"[They've got] speed."said senior
center Alex Fletcher. "Arizona al
ways has a top three defense [in the
Pac-10]. The reason I say that is just
the overall speed. Coach Stoops has
a really good defense, a fast defense
and a physical defense. It's going to
be a challenge, and they play hard."
"Team speed." said offensive co
ordinator David Shaw, who filled in
for coach Jim Harbaugh at this
week's press conference (Harbaugh
missed the conference after his wife
gave birth to a baby girl at 3 a.m. on
Tuesday). "They're very active. It's
not just one player, it's an entire
team."
Though Arizona has certainly
been impressive in its first five
games of the season, its schedule has

MOTES'. With the Cardinal three wins away
from reaching a bowl game, Saturday's
match-up with the Wildcats is as close to a
must-win as it gets if the team is to become
bowl eligible. Arizona comes into the game
4-1, though they have not faced a team with
a winning record yet. The Wildcats are led
by senior quarterback Willie Tuitama, who
has 13 touchdowns and only two intercep
tions on the season.

been less than daunting — the Wild
cats haven't played a team over .500
yet. The Wildcats' only loss of the
season came to New Mexico, which
is 3-3 on the year.
Stanford comes into the game as
a slight underdog, hut hopes to get a
morale boost from the energy of
Homecoming Weekend.
"I'd love some home cooking in
any way, shape or form that we can
find," Shaw said. "We've got stu
dents coming back, alumni coming
back. I've got a bunch of calls from
former teammates who are fired up

to come back because they know
we're playing a little better football
now."
In slowing down the Wildcat of
fense, it will be integral for the Cardi
nal to control possession of the foot
ball. There's no better way to do that
than run the football, which Stanford
hasn't had any trouble doing recent
ly — the team is averaging 204 rush
ing in its last three games.
"A lot of it is that we've had Toby
Gerhart and Anthony Kimble
healthy," Fletcher said of the team's
success running the football. "We've
been able to give them a cushion —

no one's getting pushed back on the
O-line. That's the big difference.
We're getting movement."
"A lot of things contribute to [our
running game]," Gerhart said. "The
offensive line is blocking great.
Everybody's getting bigger,
stronger. They're excited. It's an
overall mentality kind of thing."
Players and coaches alike also
made sure to point out the impor
tance of sophomore fullback Owen
Marecic.
"How wide can I open my arms?"
Shaw said when asked to describe
Marecic's impact. "Owen Marecic is
a tone-setter for us. He made some
blocks in the Notre Dame game that
I could hear in the press box. He is
an outstanding fullback."
With the Cardinal's record at 3-3,
Saturday's bout with Arizona marks

the start of the second half of the
season. Stanford's next three games
— against Arizona, UCLA and
Washington — are all winnable.
Three more wins on the year will
make Stanford bowl-eligible, some
thing it hasn't been since the Tyrone
Willingham era. Tomorrow's game
might be the biggest of the season up
to this point; it will either be a big
boost or a significant setback toward
reaching that magical number of six
wins.
"We're in the process of turning
this thing around in both recruiting
and how we are playing on the field,"
Shaw said."We're getting close, we're
on the verge. It's on us to make that
next step and play consistently."

Players and coaches alike also
made sure to point out the impor
tance of sophomore fullback Owen
Marecic.
"How wide can I open my arms?"
Shaw said when asked to describe
Marecic's impact. "Owen Marecic is
a tone-setter for us. He made some
blocks in the Notre Dame game that
I could hear in the press box. He is
an outstanding fullback."
With the Cardinal's record at 3-3,
Saturday's bout with Arizona marks

the start of the second half of the
season. Stanford's next three games
— against Arizona, UCLA and
Washington — are all winnable.
Three more wins on the year will
make Stanford bowl-eligible, some
thing it hasn't been since the Tyrone
Willingham era. Tomorrow's game
might be the biggest of the season up
to this point; it will either be a big
boost or a significant setback toward
reaching that magical number of six
wins.
"We're in the process of turning
this thing around in both recruiting
and how we are playing on the field,"
Shaw said."We're getting close, we're
on the verge. It's on us to make that
next step and play consistently."
