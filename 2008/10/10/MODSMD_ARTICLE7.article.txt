## Pro-choice and same-sex marriage advocates unite in White Plaza Students rally against Propositions 4 & 8 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO 
Students strolled toward White Plaza at
noon yesterday, donning bold and colorful
paraphernalia in the name of equality. As
their fellow peers sped along on their bikes,
they dispersed across the plaza, waving signs
and yelling a rallying chant of, "Vote no on
four and eight!"
The Student Coalition for Marriage
Equality (SCME) — an unofficial campus
club centered on the upcoming election and
an offshoot of the Queer-Straight Alliance
— organized yesterday's rally with help from
Stanford Students for Choice (SSC) in hopes
of promoting awareness about California
Propositions 4 and 8. These state measures, if

approved by voters, would require minors to
notify their parents prior to obtaining an
abortion (Proposition 4) and would elimi
nate the rights of same-sex couples to marry
(Proposition 8).
Students who attended the rally were
joined by LGBT activist Candace Gingrich,
half-sister of former House Speaker Newt
Gingrich. Attendees received free buttons
and white placards, and some also sported
uniforms illustrating their support of same
sex and reproductive rights. The graphic of
the free t-shirts provided by SCME, for
example, showed a heterosexual couple jux
taposed against gay and lesbian couples —
with the lesbian couple holding a "Just
Married" balloon — and each couple sepa

rated by equal signs.
The primary objective of these campaign
ing efforts against Propositions 4 and 8 is
education. Student organizers believed that
very few people knew about the proposi
tions, and for them, the information in the
general election packet alone does riot serve
as a sufficient source on which voters should
base their decisions.
"Because the rhetoric involved is decep
tive and is not necessarily straight-forward,
the main effort that we're doing for this cam
paign is clarifying the proposition and its
practical application," said SSC Co-President
Emily Gasner '09.
While the gathering was small, those who
showed up were eager to fight for what they

believe is a crucial human rights issue, and to
display their support for peers directly affect
ed by the propositions. It was their sense of
urgency to alert the Stanford campus and the
public about Propositions 4 and 8 that fueled
the energy in the rallying cheers.
"What brought me out here was reading
through the general election packet, and the
very first line for (Proposition) eight says 'a
constitutional amendment to deny the right,'
and 1 stopped there," said Yvorn Aswad '11.
"I couldn't go any further because how can
anyone phrase this in any good light if the
first sentence is 'to deny the right'? That
brought me out to come and support."
Temo Peranda TO hoped to "put faces
onto the proposition."

"This is a humanistic thing and you have
to realize yourself that these people are
you." he said. "What if your rights are taken
away?"
Most of the attendees were concerned
about the chances of defeating these propo
sitions, especially after the San Jose Mercury
News recently reported that both proposi
tions are currently holding more public favor
in opinion polls. Though the difference is
minimal — about five percent — the rally
organizers believe the Stanford student vote
could play a large role in blocking the two
propositions.
