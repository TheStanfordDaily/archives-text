## Stanford not targeted for IRS survey Revenue Service has yet to inquire about Stanford's finances 
### MIKE DING SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The IRS recently released a 42-page survey
aimed at investigating the executive compensa
tion, endowments and outside business income of
400 tax-exempt universities across the country.
Colleges of varying sizes will be asked to disclose
information about how they report income and
losses on taxable business activities, how they
manage their endowments and how they calculate
and distribute compensation and perks to presi-

dents and other top administra-

tors.
While select schools
around the country have

already begun to receive
the survey, Vice President {
for Business Affairs

Randy Livingston said
Stanford has not received

the IRS questionnaire.

"We may yet receive it in the next few days,"
Livingston said in an email to The Daily. "Or we
may not be one of the schools selected. In its
announcement, the IRS did not describe how it
chose the 400 colleges and universities that will
receive the questionnaire, nor did it announce the
recipients. I believe the IRS said they were draw
ing a sample across all segments of higher educa
tion."
Currently, there are more than 4,(XX) higher
education institutions in the United States, includ
ing more than 900 private research universities
and liberal arts colleges, and almost 400 major
public universities.
Livingston, who also serves as Stanford's CFO,
said the University currently files two forms with
the IRS annually.
"Stanford files Form 990 and Form 990-T with
the IRS each year," he said, "Form 990 is an infor
mational return and it is a public document. The
990-T is truly a tax return â€” Stanford is required
to report any 'unrelated business income' that is
subject to Federal income taxes."
This "unrelated business income" is one area
the IRS questionnaire is designed to examine
since it as a segment of the University finances
that can be taxed.
In an email to The Daily, Stanford Tax
Compliance Director Christopher Canellos said
"unrelated business income" includes a portion of
the income from the University's investments,
advertising income from Stanford Magazine,
income from the University's golf practice range
and Stanford's 10 percent share of net income
from the Chancellor Hotel in San Francisco.
"The IRS has stated that the primary purpose
of the questionnaire is to help it better understand
the areas it is probing across all institutions,"
Livingston said. "They have also stated that the
response could trigger an audit depending on the
information provided."
