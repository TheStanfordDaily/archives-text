# Report stings Palin over trooper firing
## Legislative investigator finds V.P. candidate violated Alaska ethics laws 
### MATT APUZZO THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
The politically charged investigation into Alaska Gov.
Sarah Palin is over, and its conclusions are stinging. But the
fallout, if any. might not come until Election Day.
A legislative investigator found that Palin violated state
ethics laws and abused her power hv trying to have her former
brother-in-law fired as a state trooper.
The next move may be at the ballot box. The legislative
committee that released the report Friday recommends no
criminal investigation and has no authority to sanction the
governor, the Republican vice presidential nominee.
"It is out of the Legislative Council's hands. It goes to any
one's hands who got a copy or clicks the link on the Web." said
Democratic state Sen. Kim Elton, the chairman of the commit
tee that released the report. "I can't tell you how the process
ends."
If voters believe the report's finding and it tarnishes Palin's
reputation as a reformer and a champion for good govern
ment, that could hurt Republican presidential nominee John
McCain in the final weeks of the race.
The McCain campaign quickly rejected that notion.
"I think the American people can tell the difference be
tween the results of a politically motivated investigation and a
legitimate finding of fact." campaign spokesman Taylor Grif
fin said.
The inquiry looked into Palin's dismissal of Public Safety
Commissioner Walter Monegan. who said he lost his job be
cause he resisted pressure to fire a state trooper involved in a
bitter divorce and custody battle with the governor's sister.
Palin says Monegan was fired as part of a legitimate budget
dispute.
Stephen Branchflower. a retired prosecutor hired to con
duct the investigation, said Monegan's firing was lawful. But
the pressure Palin and her husband put on him. he said, was
not.
Under Alaska law. it is up to the state's Personnel Board,
not the Legislature,to decide whether Palin violated the ethics
laws. If so, it must refer the matter to the Senate president for
disciplinarv action. Violations also carry a possible fine of up
to $5,000. '
By the time that investigation is over, however, the election
will be over. If Palin is the vice president-elect, the results will
hardly matter. If she loses, she'll have to address the board's
findings at home.The national media will be long gone.
Barack Obama's presidential campaign did not comment
on the report amid persistent accusations by Republicans that
rival operatives were manipulating the investigation to help
the Democratic presidential nominee.
Democratic Sen. Mollis French, who oversaw the investiga
tion, contributed to that perception when he said the report
could provide an "October surprise" for the McCain cam
paign. Elton said partisanship played no role in the report.
"When we began investigating this, we had no idea that
Sarah Palin would be a part of the national ticket," said Elton,
an Obama supporter.
Branchflower said Palin violated a statute of the Alaska
Executive Branch Ethics Act. Lawmakers don't have the au
thority to sanction her for such a violation and they gave no in
dication they would take any action against her.
