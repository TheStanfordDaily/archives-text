Reunion Homecoming 2008
kicked off with brilliant sunshine and
without a cloud in the sky. The week
end was filled with parties, faculty lec
tures and open houses for the approx
imately 9 .(XX) alumni that stormed the
Farm to celebrate their memories.
Every class that graduated from
Stanford in an interval of five years,
from the Class of 1948 to the Class of
2003, along with all the recent gradu
ates from 2004 to 2(X)8, had their
reunion over the weekend.
Organization and administration
While organizers were concerned
that the poor state of the economy
would hurt alumni turnout, such fears
were ultimately unfounded.
"This year, with the economic tur
moil in the U.S. reaching a fevered
pitch, we weren't sure if alumni would
come back â€” but they did by the
thousands," said Leslie Winick, the
director of alumni and class outreach
at the Alumni Association. "[lt was
almost as] if alumni felt like being
together in this incredibly uncertain
time gave them a sense of comfort
and optimism."
"We are fortunate to have the help
of over 1,500 dedicated alumni volun
teers who spend over a year in the
planning effort for the big weekend."
Winick continued. "We could not do
this without them. They are truly the
'soul' of the effort."
Howard Wolf, the president of the
Alumni Association told The Daily
that alumni attendance rates vary by
class, but that approximately 35 per
cent of all undergraduate alumni in
their reunion year were expected to
come back to campus for the
Reunion I iomecoming weekend.
"The Class of 2(X)3 has produced
stunning results already, with nearly
46 percent of the class registered [one
week before the homecoming]." he
said. "And the fifth reunion is usually
the reunion class with the largest
number of on-site registrations."

Winick added that large numbers
of recent graduates also attended
homecoming.
"One of the most exciting trends
in the past few years [is the] "Recent
Grad Reunion' program for gradu
ates from zero to four years out," she
said. "The first year we piloted the
Recent Grad Reunion, only about 50
recent grads came. This year it was
wall to wall recent grads with over
S(H) attending."
Wolf was enthusiastic about all the
events that were going on simultane
ously over the weekend.
"As crazy as it may seem, there are
nearly 450 events being held over the
course of the weekend." he said. "In
addition to the pro forma things we
all think of when the term 'reunion' is
used [such as) class parties, tailgates,
football game, etc., we have much
more to offer."
Wolf pointed to the large number
of Classes Without Quizzes, taught by
many of Stanford's foremost faculty
members, a panel entitled
"Understanding the Financial Crisis"

moderated by John Shoven of the
Stanford Institute for Economic
Policy Research (SIEPR) and the
roundtable, hosted by John Hennessy
and moderated by Tom Brokaw,
which offered a stunning line-up of
distinguished panelists who spoke
about leadership in the world today.

"And we have all kinds of other
offerings from a Dinner on the Ouad.
to a Singles Mingle for those unat
tached, to a Multicultural Alumni
Hall of Fame Ceremony, a student a
capella concert to mini-reunions
galore based on dorms, teams, greek
affiliation. overseas studies groups,
clubs, etc.," he said. "It is action
packed!"
Winick explained that even
though Stanford was facing a space
crunch, homecoming planners were
able to handle the pressures of the
increased visitors to campus without
problems.
"We actually had been a bit con
cerned about how we would handle
over 8,5(X) attendees because the
campus is experiencing so much con
struction," he said. "We had great
help from our campus partners who
worked really hard to help us find
creative places to put up tents, park
cars and make room for Reunion
Homecoming, which doubles the size
of the undergraduate population for
four days."

Wolf finally pointed out that
Reunion Homecoming is a wonderful
way for the Stanford Alumni
Association to reach, serve and
engage all Stanford alumni and stu
dents so as to foster lifelong intellec
tual and emotional connections
between the University and its gradu

ates that promote goodwill and sup
port for Stanford.
"Stanford's alumni love not only
re-living and reminiscing about the
nostalgic Stanford of days gone by,
but they also enjoy seeing where
Stanford is headed," he said. "They
are justifiably proud of their alma
mater, and feel a genuine stake in
where it is headed."
New (iSli construction
Approximately I.(XX) alumni, stu
dents, and faculty attended a celebra
tion at the construction site of the
new Graduate School of Business
campus, to be called the Knight
Management Center. Dean Robert
Joss began the celebration with his
opening remarks, followed by a party.
Joss described the event to The
Daily as a culmination of years of
hard work and planning, and took
time to reminisce about the decade
he has spent as dean. He will step
down after this academic year.
"It is the start of something fantas
tic," he said. "While I have mixed feel
ings about stepping down, after 10
years I feel good about the future and
am confident in new leadership."
When asked about the new dean,
he remarked that he did not have any
update about possible choices.
"There will be a senate committee
to choose the new dean," he said. "I
have no power or influence whatso
ever."

Alumni impressions
Many older alumni saw striking
changes on campus since they attend
ed. Joe Regan '58 felt that Stanford
was much less developed than it is
today.
"Back then it really was a farm."
he said. "There were nothing but
fields, and they had horses and cows.
Palo Alto was a much smaller town
and the population was totally differ
ent from what it is now. Foreign stu
dents were definitely the minority."
"We used to call the inner quad
the big playground." he added. "It
used to be dirt while it is now paved."
Reagan also pointed out that the
Vietnam War was a preoccupation of
all students on campus, particularly
due to the draft.
"There were many anti-war move
ments," he said. "The ROTC building
on campus was burned down in
protest. The student body president
was also an anti-war protestor and
tried to stop the draft."
Regan explained that the student
government organized groups to go
into Oakland to try and stop the
draft.
"Berkeley and Stanford students
even put their differences apart and
joined together to stop the draft," he
said.
Other alumni felt that not all
changes were necessarily positive.
Bob Wilcox '53 used to be in the
Stanford Band but felt that the trans

formation was not necessarily for the
better
"They used to he a real band and
played real music back then," he said.
He also pointed out that that the
large number of bikes on campus is a
big change.
"Back then, not too many kids had
cars or even bikes," Wilcox said.
"People used to walk everywhere."
His sister. Janis Wilcox '58, pointed
out that there were also large bonfires
by Lake Lagunita.
"There used to be huge bonfires
by the lake that you could see from
Highway 101," she said. "Back then,
there were fewer people and more
woods. So, it was probably not the
safest thing to do."
Bob Wilcox added that it was great
to catch up will fellow students, even
though sometimes it took a while to
remember who they were.
"Earlier I met someone that I had
n't seen in 50 years," he said. "Most of
the time I recognize the people, but
when I don't, I read the nametag and
then make the connection."
The 1953 graduate had some part
ing advice for current students.
"I love this place; it really is a spe
cial place," he said. "Four years
seemed like a long time back then,
but it really wasn't. Enjoy every
minute of it."
