## Editorial Take advantage of Stanford's sexual-health resources 
### 
In a recently released survey, Trojan Con
doms ranked Stanford University as the
No. 1 school in the nation for providing ac
cess to sexual health resources, as reported in
The Daily last week ("Stanford on top of sex
ual health").The Farm also managed to jump
up 40 places from last year's rankings, which
are based on a variety of criteria, including re
source hours of operation, accessibility of
contraceptives and STD testing and outreach
programs, among other factors.
The editorial board would like to echo the
praises of the Trojan survey. Stanford demon
strates a commitment to keeping its explo
rative constituents both healthy and safe, and
there are a variety of services at the disposal
of Stanford students. On college campuses
where young adults are exploring the bound
aries of their sexual identities, it is incumbent
on the university community to make safety
and wellness a priority. And as reflected by
the Trojan rankings, Stanford has demon
strated a great commitment to this.
The student-run Sexual Health Peer Re
source Center (SHPRC), located on the sec
ond floor of Vaden Health Center, provides
free STD Testing and two dollars-worth of
sexual health items each quarter.The center's
Web site is also rife with important informa
tion about how to lead a sexually healthy
lifestyle, and the organization puts on a host
of programs about sexual wellness through
out the year. We would like to applaud the
SHPRC's hard work and commend the or
ganization for providing openness about sex
ual health, which many students were denied
in high school.
While the SHPRC is the centerpiece of
Stanford's sexual health resources and the
main basis for Stanford's high ranking on the
Trojan Health Report Card, it is comple
mented by a variety of other resources on
campus. Peer Health Educators, or PHEs,
serve as an in-dorm resource to residents.
PHEs also design awareness programming
and plan dorm trips to the SHPRC to intro
duce freshmen to its existence and work to
soothe what could otherwise be an issue of
embarrassment for some students. As many
students mav feel more comfortable talking

about sexual health with someone they know
well, we commend Residential Education for
developing the PHE program.
Counseling and Psychological Services, or
CAPS, also provides a 24-hour-a-day phone
line (650-723-3785) and employs professional
counselors to deal with issues of sexuality and
sexual health. Evaluations for medication
and workshops are also a mainstay of CAPS.
CAPS is an excellent resource for students
who want to talk to mental health profession
als. and we continue to call for the expansion
of this service and the rectification of staffing
shortages.
Though not factored into Trojan's rank
ings, another critical resource that promotes
sexual safety is 5-SURE. the free shuttle serv
ice (650-725-7873). The organization reports
that 100-200 students are shuttled over the
weekend, and twice as many women use the
service as men.'lTiough many 5-SURE users
are simply looking for a quick commute, the
program undoubtedly protects some of our
inebriated classmates from potentially dan
gerous situations. If the program stops even
one sexual assault a year, it is doing its job.
Our only concern about Stanford's sexual
health programming is that the Stanford
community does not take full advantage of it.
While topping the nation in the type of sexu
al health services we provide is undoubtedly
an accomplishment, resource availability
needs to be matched by resource use if Stan
ford truly wants to be the best. It is the re
sponsibility of all Stanford students, whether
sexually active or not. to be informed about
what it takes to lead a healthy lifestyle.
Just as we must end stigmas about mental
health on campus, so must we end stigmas
about sexual health. Most students are proba
bly too embarrassed to stroll up to the
SHPRC and ask for their free condoms. Oth
ers may be in denial that pregnancy or sexual
ly transmitted disease scares happen at Stan
ford.lTie University does a great deal of good
providing us ample sexual health resources,
but it's up to us to make sure we use them to
their fullest. We call on Stanford students to
admit their own vulnerability and take advan
tage of Stanford's sexual health resources.
