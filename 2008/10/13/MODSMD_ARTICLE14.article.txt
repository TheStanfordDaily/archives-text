## The
						conservative minority 
### 
I'm a minority, but you couldn't tell by
looking at me. I'm not Hispanic, African
American. Native American or gay. In
fact, I'm a conservative — one of the very
few at this school. I'm not a Rush Lim
baugh/Ann Coulter-doting conservative.
Very few of us are. I am more of a conserva
tive-libertarian mix — a mestiza. I don't like
the label Republican for the same reasons
most blacks don't like the label Negro: it has
come to carry a stigma.
I disagree with Democrats on principles
and issues, but I consider Republican politi
cians sellouts. I cringe at the prospect of vot
ing in this election since I don't like either
candidate. Like many conservatives on cam
pus, I feel disenfranchised. There isn't any
politician who really represents my interests
and values. I am for free trade, smaller gov
ernment, the voucher system, more open im
migration laws and gay rights. I am against
abortion, any kind of taxes and government
run social security. Some campus conserva
tives agree with me on these issues,but many
also disagree. You see,conservatives should
n't be stereotyped or pigeonholed.
Although this is my third year at Stan
ford. it still surprises me when 1 hear some
one vilify conservatives. I expected Stanford
to be diverse and open-minded, but I am sad
to say, it's not. On paper, we have the kind of
student body that admissions representa
tives like to tout. We're 11.4 percent Hispan
ic, 9.4 percent African American, 24 percent
Asian and 6.3 percent international. Based
on February's primary election and the
Stanford Conservative Society membership,
we're about 9-12 percent conservative.
Despite our minority status, there is no
special conservative theme house. We're al
ways out in the open, braving verbal attacks
and sneers. We've seen the "snarky" way
some students look at us — kind of like how
John Kerry looked at George W. Bush in the
2(M)4 debates — and have heard the dis
paraging way some talk about us.
I watched the past two debates with my
dorm, sitting quietly as people smirked
smugly at John McCain and Sarah Palin. I
listened to students cheer when Obama ac
cused McCain of saying something that was
n't true, and I listened to them snicker when
Sarah Palin said "maverick" or "nucular."
When I noted that Palin had made a good
point, someone behind me hollered, "Shut
up, you're stupid." But this wasn't the first
time I had been ridiculed as a conservative.
During my freshman year, I had admitted

AlSysia Finley
in "Crossing the Line" to holding certain
conservative positions. Afterward, several
peers called me out for my views. Though a
vaunted freshman residential education
program, "Crossing the Line" seemed to in
timidate students into liberal conformity, to
make students accept and tolerate all differ
ences — race, gender, class, sexuality — ex
cept those which arc ideological.
Later that year. I wrote an article in the
Stanford Review criticizing ethnic theme
dorms. The weekend it was published, my
email box became inundated with messages
calling me a racist and an ignorant, white lib
ertarian. But I'm not the only one who has
experienced such smears.
Last Monday, McCain fundraiser Pradip
Chandrasoma spoke on a student panel
sponsored by the Center for Comparative
Studies of Race and Ethnicity. In condemn
ing the lack of ideological diversity on cam
pus, he referred to his experience working
the Stanford Conservative Society booth at
the activities fair, where he was spit on and
called a warmonger and fascist.
Even alumni are distraught by Stanford's
lack of ideological diversity.
Karen Tenney '75 commented in the last
issue of Stanford magazine: "Where is the di
versity of ideas on campus? I wonder what
these students have been hearing in their
classes for four years that helped lead them all
to the same political conclusions. I know that
Stanford works hard to attract an ethnically
diverse student body and faculty. Perhaps it's
time to focus on building a community rich in
diversity of ideas, opinions and thinking."
Richard G. Cummings, '70 wrote "I
thought Stanford prided itself on diversity ..
. Sounds more like the school has a predom
inantly'diverse' liberal student body."
I'm not proposing any kind of affirmative
action program for conservative students sim
ilar to what the University of Colorado has
proposed for conservative professors. But stu
dents and faculty should be more open to con
servatives' ideas, not just discounting them as
bigoted or ignorant. Just like minority ethnic
groups, conservatives offer the University
new and different perspectives. It's ideas, not
skin color, that make a university diverse.

If yon also feel disenfranchised and jaded by
our political system, email Allysia at amfin
