## The 						law of love 
### 
lam the Presbyterian Campus Minister for
the United Campus Christian Ministry at
Stanford University. I am opposed to
Proposition 8, which will eliminate the right
to marry for same-sex couples, for two rea
sons.
The first reason is entirely secular but
nonetheless important. Prop. 8 is unjust be
cause it will make gay and lesbian members
of our community second-class citizens who
have most of the rights, but not all the rights
that the rest of us enjoy. It allows the rights of
a minority to be taken away by the vote of the
majority Those of us who may be in the ma
jority today may find ourselves in the minor
ity tomorrow or the next day. Would we want
our rights eliminated by a vote of the majori
ty, however well rationalized? I dare say we
would not.
Second, as a Christian. 1 believe that Prop.
8 violates the law of love. This may require
some explanation. Jesus' ministry was direct
ed towards those who were the outcasts of
society whether they were the poor, the sick
and lame, non-Jews (such as Greeks and
Samaritans) or sinners — in other words, all
those who were considered to be ritualisuical
ly "unclean." Jesus' ministry was a ministry of
inclusion, not exclusion. Jesus broke down
the walls of division and proclaimed that the
reign of God is without borders.The Apostle
Paul goes so far as to proclaim: "There is nei
ther Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor
free, there is neither male nor female: for you
are all one in Christ Jesus." (Galatians 3:28,
New Revised Standard Version)
Why does the reign of God have no
fences or borders? Because the love of God
knows no limit — it is boundless. Contrary
to what you may have heard, there is no "in"
group or "out" group. So what does this
have to do with the law of love? It means
that we are guided not by the religious
checklist of "do's" and "don'ts," but by a
higher and truer law of love. Does that mean
that anything goes or that there are no
guidelines? Quite the contrary, we are com
pelled to speak and act for those things in
life that expand, enlarge and spread the
message and actions of love. It means that
we must surrender to the mystery of love
and to the realization that our attempts to
fence it in and define it are at best feeble and
perhaps even arrogant.
I have been fortunate enough to know
many same-sex couples, and they have never
failed to deepen my understanding of love
and commitment. Just as we once thought
that the definition of family was Ozzie and
Harriet and 2.4 children, so now we know
that families come in all shapes and sizes, col
ors and genders.The law of love, like the laws
of nature, will not be controlled or confined.
Such is the law of love, always breaking
boundaries. It's time to get out of the way and
let love have its way. Our world will be the
better for it.
