# Subprime politics

### 
Who's to blame for the financial cri
sis? Certainly not the American
people. I know because Sarah Palin
told me so during the vice presidential de
bate on Oct. 2, when asked who she thought
was at fault for the subprime mortgage crisis.
"Darn right it was the predator lenders,
who tried to talk Americans into thinking
that it was smart to buy a $300,000 house if
we could only afford a $ I (K).(KK) house," she
said. "There was deception there." And
maybe I could have believed her, if the story
wasn't so darn familiar. It seems like, more
often that not, the American consumer is pi
geonholed into the role of easy prey.
Why has the American consumer become
synonymous with the American victim?
Consumerism has become so deeply embed
ded in our cultural identity that, today, buy
ing is the most direct way for us to embody
what it means to be truly American. If you

don't think that's true, then just think back to
right after Sept. 11, when we were told that
spending more money was the best way to
show our patriotism.
This was nothing new — after all. con
sumerism and patriotism were linked
throughout most of the 20th century. Hut be
cause the Federal Reserve cut interest rates
to free up the money supply and make it eas
ier to get loans, the mandate to patriotically
spend now came hand-in-hand with the man
date to compulsively borrow. We caught onto
the idea that instant gain and the avoidance
of immediate sacrifice was the best route to
success. Because we no longer needed work
ethic to get cash right away, we became a cul
ture of borrowers.
While this mentality has certainly affected
our decisions as individuals, it has also affect
ed the way we as Americans have made deci
sions about what is best for our country
That's why. when support for the war in Iraq
was proposed as our next patriotic mandate
in 2003. it didn't seem like such a far stretch.
We believed we could orchestrate the war
without having to pay for it in higher taxes —
it was just another thing for which we could
borrow in order to be able to afford.
I'm sure that when Sarah Palin said during
the debate."lt's a toxic mess, really, on Main
Street that's affecting Wall Street," her words
were a slip of the tongue rather than a refer
ence to the irresponsibility of the American
consumer. But what is even more worrisome
is that I'm sure she meant what she said when
she attacked Joe Biden for calling the pay
ment of higher taxes a patriotic duty. She did
it in the cutest, friendliest way possible, but
she nonetheless told the American people
that they should expect something for noth
ing.
When she claimed afterward that Ameri
ca could still win the war, she was essentially
telling the American people that America
could still win while being three trillion dol
lars in debt — with no increase in the rev
enue from taxpayer money.
And it sounded really good. She spoke di
rectly to the part of us that has become accus
tomed to hearing that we can gain without
giving anything up in return. It is no wonder
that many American consumers responded
favorably to her cheerful truisms — this is
exactly what has come out of the White
House for the past eight years.
We all know about subprime mortgages,
the ones that were haphazardly granted to
people with less-than-stellar credit reports.
Sarah Palin is playing that same game with
the fate of the United States — she is playing
subprime politics. She expects us to lend her
our trust without any apparent means to
make good on her promises for the United
States. Can we trust her not to default?
We've experienced first-hand that com
pulsively borrowing for momentary gain can
lead to a deep, terrifying abyss of economic
downturn. If we realize this in the economic
sector, then why should the political sector be
any different?
It's time to end the cycle of victimization.
We, the consumers of America, must assert
ourselves. We must declare that we will no
longer choose what seems to be beneficial
right now over what we know will be benefi
cial in the long run. Our politicians tend to
pander to our bad habits —if we don't
change, they never will.

And we also must accept a part of the re
sponsibility for what has happened to our
country. Because it it is true that no national
crisis can begin without the participation of
the American consumer, then it is also true
that no crisis can end without the participa
tion of the American consumer. Let's prove
to John McCain that we,as the economic and
political fundamentals of this country, are in
deed strong. Let the American consumer end
his career as a victim and be heard.
