# Well, look who showed up

### 
This past weekend I was hack in Stan
ford Stadium for the first time since its
inaugural game, when the schedule
planners unwittingly invited a thought-to-be
"cupcake" Navy team (my undergraduate
alma mater) to commemorate the affair with
a victory. Unfortunately,on that occasion, the
Blue & Gold ruined the affair with a 35-0
drubbing which featured an overall effort so
embarrassing (by everyone save the football
team) that I was compelled to write an op-ed
inThe Dailv.the publication of which made it
all the way back to Annapolis. After that
piece, no one was more surprised that I was
invited back than 1. But even more surpris
ing, for the first time in the two years I spent
in the seats, and the one year I spent on the
sidelines, I actually felt like there was a big
time college football game being held on the
Stanford campus.
To be clear. I'm not a Stanford apologist.
In the previous pieces I've written. 1 wasn't
kind. And I brought all of those expectations
with me as I walked back onto the field for
the first time in four years. Barring an earth
quake, stadium fire or other act of Clod, I ex
pected Stanford fans to be about as excitable
as a Russian gymnastics judge, and The Band
to be the abortive disaster I remembered it to
be, whose musicianship would be the only
thing more disappointing than its compo
sure. I expected the team would put up a
good fight, but ultimately fall short, with fans
failing to be any more supportive than your
average drugstore condolences card.
I was wrong.
The Band impressed immediately. Of
course, up close, they still looked a mess (I'm
not quite certain why grooming standards
are always the first casualty of rebellion). But
despite their appearance, I hey sounded ...
well, great. In particular, the bass drummer
was so good and fun to watch, I was nearly
ready to forgive The Band on his perform
ance alone. But they didn't stop there. They
had an amazing variety of songs, which I'm
pretty sure included some Ozzy Osbourne
and Dave Matthews, and all of which they
played loudly and well. As they took the field
for the pre-game, their formations were tight,
and their national anthem was fantastic.The
Band appeared once again to be a group of
talented (if not slightly misguided) musi-
eians, and not just a bunch of direc
tionless idiots with instruments.
Sure, I'd like to see more of them
wearing actual shoes — but one step
at a time, right?

The fans were not great in num
ber, but they were heard. Through
out the game, they rose up vocifer
ously for third-down stands. There
was key jingling for kickoffs, chants
for first downs and group expletives
for egregiously bad calls. You could
finally be in the stadium bathroom
and realize that you had missed a
great play. The student section was
the crown jewel of this new breed of

Stanford fan. They were pleasingly
rowdy, and being stationed in front
of them was my extraordinary good
fortune.
The stadium looked fantastic.The
security and staff were courteous
and professional. The place was
cleaner than the nightly washed law
school bathrooms, and looked just as
new as it did two years ago. The team
support groups were fun to watch.

and the alumni cheerleaders were
just plain awesome.
The game was amazing, and built
to a late crescendo, which produced
the most memorable moment I've
had in Stanford Stadium to date. I
previously lamented the failure of
the fans to stick around for the play
ing of the alma mater as a nearly un
forgivable embarrassment for the
University. But this weekend, it was
different. The victorious team ap
proached the southeast corner of
the stadium to audible delight of
nearly all the students. The Band
had made their way onto the field,
having just completed an excited
version of their famous fight song.
The cheerleaders, Dollies and Tree
were all packed into the same cor
ner and everyone joined arm-in
arm, as The Band cued up '"Hail,
Stanford. Hail." To my delight and
surprise, over the sound of the Band
I actually heard the sound of collec
tive voices. As the song finished and
a final cheer went up, my heart
swelled with pride for the first time
since I have been associated with
Stanford, and I knew I had to write
this piece.
Now don't get me wrong, the
newly minted stadium and its Cardi
nal-clad inhabitants are far from
Michigan's Big House, Florida's
Swamp or USC's Coliseum. The
Band's halftime show is still impossi
bly un-funny. the now-smaller seat
ing capacity still woefully un-filled
and the crowd still mostly un-intimi
dating for visiting teams, but what's
finally in Stanford Stadium is good
— a good start, a harbinger of good
things to come, and that's "All Right
Now."
