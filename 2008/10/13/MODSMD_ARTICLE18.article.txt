# Well, look who showed up

This past weekend I was hack in Stan
ford Stadium for the first time since its
inaugural game, when the schedule
planners unwittingly invited a thought-to-be
"cupcake" Navy team (my undergraduate
alma mater) to commemorate the affair with
a victory. Unfortunately,on that occasion, the
Blue & Gold ruined the affair with a 35-0
drubbing which featured an overall effort so
embarrassing (by everyone save the football
team) that I was compelled to write an op-ed
inThe Dailv.the publication of which made it
all the way back to Annapolis. After that
piece, no one was more surprised that I was
invited back than 1. But even more surpris
ing, for the first time in the two years I spent
in the seats, and the one year I spent on the
sidelines, I actually felt like there was a big
time college football game being held on the
Stanford campus.
To be clear. I'm not a Stanford apologist.
In the previous pieces I've written. 1 wasn't
kind. And I brought all of those expectations
with me as I walked back onto the field for
the first time in four years. Barring an earth
quake, stadium fire or other act of Clod, I ex
pected Stanford fans to be about as excitable
as a Russian gymnastics judge, and The Band
to be the abortive disaster I remembered it to
be, whose musicianship would be the only
thing more disappointing than its compo
sure. I expected the team would put up a
good fight, but ultimately fall short, with fans
failing to be any more supportive than your
average drugstore condolences card.
I was wrong.
The Band impressed immediately. Of
course, up close, they still looked a mess (I'm
not quite certain why grooming standards
are always the first casualty of rebellion). But
despite their appearance, I hey sounded ...
well, great. In particular, the bass drummer
was so good and fun to watch, I was nearly
ready to forgive The Band on his perform
ance alone. But they didn't stop there. They
had an amazing variety of songs, which I'm
pretty sure included some Ozzy Osbourne
and Dave Matthews, and all of which they
played loudly and well. As they took the field
for the pre-game, their formations were tight,
and their national anthem was fantastic.The
Band appeared once again to be a group of
talented (if not slightly misguided) musi-
