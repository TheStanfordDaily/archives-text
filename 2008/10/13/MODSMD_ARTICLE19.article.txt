## New Down test discovered 
### THOMAS YEH 
Stanford researchers have devel
oped a breakthrough, non-invasive
method of testing for Down syndrome
in its prenatal stages, using nothing
more than a simple blood test.
Bioengineering Prof. Stephen
Quake led the study, which was pub
lished last Monday in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences
and garnered international media
attention upon its release.
The study consisted of 18 pregnant
women, nine of whom were correctly
diagnosed with carrying a fetus having
the chromosomai disorder that
accounts for Down syndrome.
"The holy grail of prenatal diagno
sis is: 'Can we find a way to diagnose
Down syndrome and other genetic
abnormalities in the fetus just by test
ing mom's blood?"' said Dr. Yair
Blumenfeld, a current fellow in high
risk pregnancy who joined Quake's
team in fall 2(X)6.
It turns out that we can.
After taking blood samples from
pregnant women who had high risks of
carrying fetuses with chromosomal
abnormalities, the study discovered a
new way to identify critical evidence of
Down syndrome by locating and
sequencing cell-free DNA — free
floating segments of DNA in a preg
nant woman's blood that contain frag
mentary information about the fetus
itself — in the samples.
Christina Fan. a fourth -year bio
engineering graduate student, collabo
rated closely with Quake on this
method of "shotgun sequencing," a
rapid process of extrapolating compre
hensive genetic information from
DNA segments
"We thought sequencing might
solve the problem since it provides

millions of counts," Fan said. "The
breakthrough came when we thought
of using next-generation sequencing
technology to sequence the cell-free
DNA sample. For a Down-syndrome
fetus, there would be an overrepresen
tation of chromosome 21 sequences in
the mother's blood. And thats exactly
what we saw."
Down syndrome is a chromosomal
disorder caused by an additional 21st
chromosome in the individual's genet
ic makeup, usually resulting in a num
ber of developmental and cognitive
disabilities. The mother's age. her
genetic history and problematic ultra
sounds are three major indicators that
may warrant testing during pregnancy.
By discovering genetic abnormalities
early on. mothers-to-be can make bet
ter-informed decisions on whether or
not to terminate the pregnancy.
Blumenfeld explained that current
ly, the existing tests for Down syn
drome are invasive and inherently
risky. Mothers primarily have a choice
between amniocentesis and chorionic
villus sampling (CVS) — two proce
dures that require the insertion of a
needle either into the placenta or the
amniotic cavity in order to directly
obtain fetal samples for testing. These
tests carry a one in 1(K) to one in 3(X)
chance of causing serious complica
tions in labor, a risk that the new study
hopes to circumvent.
The National Down Syndrome
Society (NDSS) acknowledged the
merits of a safer and more definitive
test, but also cautioned scientists and
laypeople alike about the implications
of this knowledge if delivered incor
rectly.
"Before these new prenatal tests
arc made commercially available, the
NDSS urges medical schools, residen
cy programs and fellowship trainings

to educate their healthcare profession
als on how best to deliver a prenatal
diagnosis of Down syndrome to
expectant families," the organization
said in a statement issued in response
to the Stanford study.
Dr. Brian Skotko, physician at
Children's Hospital Boston and board
member of the NDSS, emphasized the
importance of accurate guidance.
"I've surveyed mothers around the
country who have children with Down
syndrome and have asked them how
they got the news from their doctors,"
Skotko said. "Mothers are often pro
vided with incomplete and sometimes
even offensive descriptions of Down
syndrome which actively urges them
to terminate."
Before the new screening method
can become widely used, further stud
ies must take place. The new method
needs to be tested on a much larger
scale before its accuracy can be con
firmed.
"This is just a pilot study and it has
to be validated with a much larger
cohort before it can be applied com
mercially," Blumenfeld said.
"Nevertheless, it is a groundbreaking
study. Something like this has never
been done before."
