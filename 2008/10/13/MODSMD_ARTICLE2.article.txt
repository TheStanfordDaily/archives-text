## ARIZONA 23 HOME RUN DRIVE STANFORD WINS HOMECOMING GAME WITH LAST-SECOND TD 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
Tavita Pritchard was sidelined with a concus
sion, Jason Forcier was unsuccessful in relief
and Jim Harbaugh did not want to burn
Andrew Luck's red shirt. So. down by six with
just under six minutes left in Saturday's home
coming game against Arizona, third-string quar
terback Alex Loukas was tabbed to lead the
Cardinal offense.
He did not disappoint.
The redshirt sophomore led Stanford to the
game-winning score on a beautifully orchestrat
ed 11 -play drive that put the Cardinal up 24-23
and drained all but 25 seconds off of the clock.

Redshirt sophomore Alex Loukas was the unlikely hero on Saturday against Arizona, driving the Cardinal down the
field for a score with just 25 seconds left in the game. Stanford moved to 4-3 on the year with the victory.
Loukas relied on his legs more than his
arm — he only threw once on the drive,
but ran the hall four times for 32 yards. His
effective use of play action and the option
left the Wildcats flatfooted, and I.oukas
was able to pick up yards in bunches.
•'They were trying to play kind of soft,
and I just think they didn't realize how fast
Alex was," said senior center Alex Fletch
er, who led an offensive line that dominat
ed the line throughout the game."Then we
started running the read option and they
realized a little too late how fast he was."
Perhaps I.oukas' biggest run was on
third-and-six at the Arizona nine-yard
line. On a designed option, Loukas kept
the ball himself and picked up seven yards
for a first down.
"I went out to the side, and decided to
keep the ball," he said. "I saw the defend
ers closing to my right,so I looked left real
quick and just tried to run as fast as I could
to the end zone and got stopped a little
short."
No matter, though—junior running
back Ibby Gerhart tied the game two
plays later, and senior Aaron Zagory's
subsequent kick gave Stanford the lead
with under 30 seconds left.
In the process. Stanford pushed its
record to 4-3 and3-1 in the Pacific-10 Con
ference by defeating a vaunted but untest
ed Arizona team. The Wildcats entered
the contest with a 4-1 record, the nation's
No. 2 defense and a top-10 scoring offense,
but had played no one of note; their lone
defeat, an eight-point loss to New Mexico,
was a result of five Arizona turnovers.
As much as the Cardinal needed the
win to maintain its bowl hopes and further
establish itself as an up-and-coming team
in the conference, the Wildcats needed a
victory to prove to both themselves and
the rest of the college footbaJJ_world that
tlieir record and statistics weren't just a
ritoduct of their weak schedule.
But Arizona had no answer for the
Stanford rushing attack, and the Cardinal
defense shut down senior quarterback
Willie Tuitama's main receiving threats.
Toby Gerhart rushed for 1 16 yards, and
senior Anthony Kimble added an addi
tional 110. Throw in Loukas' 39 rushing
yards, and Stanford ran wild all afternoon.
On defense, the Cardinal contained the
Wildcats' two main weapons: wide receiv
er Mike Thomas and tight end Rob
Gronkowski. Tuitama instead looked to
reserve receiver Terrell Turner, who had

arguably the best game of his career with
10 catches for 175 yards. Hut missing from
his line was the most important statistic of
all: touchdowns.
Stanford only allowed one offensive
TD. and otherwise played stellar red-zone
defense.The Cardinal forced the Wildcats
to settle for three field goals of under 25
yards.
"Earlier in the season we struggled in
the red zone, so after the first couple of
games we emphasized red-zone stops and
how important it is to leave allowing just
three points," said junior strong safety Bo
McNally. "Our coaches put together a re
ally good scheme for what their tenden
cies were in the red zone this week,and we
just executed the calls really well."
The biggest of these stops came just be
fore Stanford's game-winning score. The
Wildcats led 20-17 and faced first and goal
from the Cardinal's six-yard line. But Nic
Grigsby was stuffed twice, and on third

down. Stanford freshman Michael
Thomas deflected a ball in front of Ari
zona's Mike Thomas to force fourth down.
It was nice redemption for Stanford's
Thomas, as his fumble on a run in the sec
ond quarter led to the first of two Arizona
touchdowns on Cardinal turnovers. The
second came just minutes later, when
Pritchard was picked off bv Nate Ness,
who took the ball 75 yards to the end zone.
Down 17-7 and facing an Arizona team
that was able to score practically on cue all
season long, the Cardinal's situation ap
peared dire, even after it ws able to add a
field goal just before the quarter ended.
Pritchard. who had played well before the
interception, did not see a snap in the sec
ond half due to concussion-like symptoms.
I lis replacement Forcier could do little
with the ball — the Cardinal's touchdown
with him under center was largely due to

GAME NOTES: Stanford is now 4-3 on the season and only two wins
away from qualifying for a bowl game. Coach Jim Harbaugh said
that quarterback Tavita Pritchard would be the likely starter for
Saturday's game against the Bruins, despite the concussion-like
symptoms Pritchard experienced after leaving the game Saturday.

Senior running back Anthony Kimble breaks away from the Arizona defense on a 70-yard run that rejuvenated the Cardinal offense in
the third quarter of Saturday's game. Kimble, who had 110 yards on 10 carries, finished the drive with a touchdown two plays later.
Kimble's 70-yard run that set Stan
ford up with first and goal from the
two-yard line.
But the Cardinal defense held the
Arizona attack in check throughout
the half, and Loukas — a top-15
quarterback recruit just three years
ago. but now a little-used backup —
was able to finish off the Wildcats.
NOTES — Highly touted freshman
receiver C hris Owusu saw his first
action of the year on Saturday,
pulling in three catches for 22 yards
and returning one kick for 26 yards.
.. Sophomore Ryan Whalen led the
Cardinal with 62 yards on five catch
es, and leads the team in both recep
tions and receiving yards... Sopho
more Doug Baldwin scored Stan
ford's first touchdown: he leads all
Cardinal receivers with three TDs
through the air... Gerhart went to
the locker room with 3:31 left in the
second quarter, and was diagnosed
with a right shoulder contusion; he
returned to play in the second half..

"I just think they didn't
realize how fast Alex
was. They realized a
little too late."
—ALEX FLETCHER,
senior center

. Stanford also beat Arizona by just
one point last year, when they
downed the Wildcats 21-20 in Tuc
son, Ariz.
