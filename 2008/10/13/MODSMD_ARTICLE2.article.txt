# STANFORD 24
## ARIZONA 23 HOME RUN DRIVE STANFORD WINS HOMECOMING GAME WITH LAST-SECOND TD 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
Tavita Pritchard was sidelined with a concus
sion, Jason Forcier was unsuccessful in relief
and Jim Harbaugh did not want to burn
Andrew Luck's red shirt. So. down by six with
just under six minutes left in Saturday's home
coming game against Arizona, third-string quar
terback Alex Loukas was tabbed to lead the
Cardinal offense.
He did not disappoint.
The redshirt sophomore led Stanford to the
game-winning score on a beautifully orchestrat
ed 11 -play drive that put the Cardinal up 24-23
and drained all but 25 seconds off of the clock.
