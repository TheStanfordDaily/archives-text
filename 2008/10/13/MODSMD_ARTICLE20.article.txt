# Someone new keeps stepping up
## 
### JACK SALISBURY DESK EDITOR 
Coming into this season, Stan
ford's most established playmaker
was junior wide receiver Richard
Sherman. He's currently nowhere to
be found now. with a possibly season
ending knee injury, but the Cardinal
has found a different playmaker
each and every week to lead the team
to its 4-3 record on the season.
It's often been junior Toby Ger
hart. But the next week it might be
senior Tavita Pritchard or sopho
more Doug Baldwin and freshman
Ryan Whalen at wide receiver. Don't
forget senior Anthony Kimble, a
starter for three years who is capable
of breaking a long run at any time,
despite finding himself stuck behind
the team's new workhorse. Gerhart.
And on Saturday? It was, of all
people, third-string sophomore
quarterback Alex Loukas.
"There's something special about
this ball club." coach Jim Harbaugh
said after the game. "That's when it's
most fun. when it's a different guy
every week. A lot of our wins have
been a different set of guys that
stepped up. Today was Alex Loukas
and many others, but I can't say
enough about the way Alex per
formed in crunch time."
Despite getting hardly any reps
during practice this past week.
Loukas came in essentially cold to
lead the Cardinal to one of its most
memorable drives in a long time.
"1 just warmed up, got my mind
right, didn't really think too much â€”
just played and reacted." Loukas
said.
He also ended up getting a little
help from his friends.
"All my teammates came up to
me and said I trust you. 1 believe in
you," Loukas explained. "[Senior
center Alex Fletcher] just said "Do
your thing, I believe in you.'"
Saturday's 24-23 win over Ari
