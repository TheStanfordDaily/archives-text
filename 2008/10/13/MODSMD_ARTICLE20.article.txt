# Someone new keeps stepping up
## 
### JACK SALISBURY DESK EDITOR 
Coming into this season, Stan
ford's most established playmaker
was junior wide receiver Richard
Sherman. He's currently nowhere to
be found now. with a possibly season
ending knee injury, but the Cardinal
has found a different playmaker
each and every week to lead the team
to its 4-3 record on the season.
It's often been junior Toby Ger
hart. But the next week it might be
senior Tavita Pritchard or sopho
more Doug Baldwin and freshman
Ryan Whalen at wide receiver. Don't
forget senior Anthony Kimble, a
starter for three years who is capable
of breaking a long run at any time,
despite finding himself stuck behind
the team's new workhorse. Gerhart.
And on Saturday? It was, of all
people, third-string sophomore
quarterback Alex Loukas.
"There's something special about
this ball club." coach Jim Harbaugh
said after the game. "That's when it's
most fun. when it's a different guy
every week. A lot of our wins have
been a different set of guys that
stepped up. Today was Alex Loukas
and many others, but I can't say
enough about the way Alex per
formed in crunch time."
Despite getting hardly any reps
during practice this past week.
Loukas came in essentially cold to
lead the Cardinal to one of its most
memorable drives in a long time.
"1 just warmed up, got my mind
right, didn't really think too much —
just played and reacted." Loukas
said.
He also ended up getting a little
help from his friends.
"All my teammates came up to
me and said I trust you. 1 believe in
you," Loukas explained. "[Senior
center Alex Fletcher] just said "Do
your thing, I believe in you.'"
Saturday's 24-23 win over Ari
zona might have been the most
team-oriented victory the Cardinal
has had this season. While it was
Loukas who led the team on the
game-winning drive, it was Gerhart
and Kimble who pounded at the
Wildcat defense, both experiencing
the same amount of success: Gerhart
rushed for 116 yards on 24 carries,
while Kimble had 110 yards on 10
carries.
And don't forget the defense.The
Cardinal defense had a solid day
against Arizona quarterback Willie
Tuitama, but more importantly, they
came up big when it mattered. I"he
Wildcats were able to move the ball,
but they were forced to kick field
goals three times after reaching the
red zone.
"That's huge." Harbaugh said of
the red-zone stops. "We made them
settle for three field goals. That's
huge. We made great adjustments.
Guys just kept coming, got some hits
on the 08. Our guys did a great job
of tackling in space, except for when

the one tight end got loose. I thought
our guys did a really great job tack
ling."
With the win, the Cardinal is 4-3
and now only two wins away from a
bowl game. Credit has to go to the
coaches, as the team hasn't relied on
the superb play of a few stars, bur
rather the concerted effort of a team
that is hungry for its first winning
season in years.
"The difference is coach Har
baugh." Fletcher said. "He believes
in us. He's a real positive guy. Every
one has this belief — we really
worked hard to push ourselves to the
limit and that shows in the last.game
winning drive.
"We've obviously been through
ups and downs — mostly downs,"
continued Fletcher, who played on
the 2006 Stanford team, one of the
worst in program history. "It's really
nice to be able to smile."
