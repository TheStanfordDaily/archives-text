Remember coming two hours
early to the game when the
Red Zone was on the other
side of the stadium in the baking
sun? Remember when you had to
actually pay to get into the game?
1 low about 1-11. when losing to Cal
by nine as 4((-point underdogs was a
"moral victory"?
And who can forget Walt Harris?
Chances are, half of the current
students don't remember, but two
years ago, Stanford football had
reached an all-time low and no signs
of change were in sight.
Unfortunately, the flaws of the
program were seemingly inherent.
Stanford had no chance of compet
ing with big-time programs such as
Southern California or Ohio State,
who have much less stringent stan
dards of admission for their players.
Adding insult to injury. Stanford
could not win a single game that sea
son in the newly christened Stanford
Stadium, a jewel of a venue fit for
champions.
I'nduring 2006. I had learned to
lower my expectations considerably
for Stanford football. One win? At
least we weren't shut out.Two wins?
Okay, now we're talking. But four or
more? I must be dreaming.
So take it with a grain of salt when
I say Stanford has made progress by
leaps and bounds since 1-11 in 2006.
Before anything else, let's get it
straight â€” we're no USC. Cal or
even IJCLA (despite their poor play
this season), limes have changed
considerably, recruitment especially.
