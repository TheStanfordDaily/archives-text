## Hop on the Harbaugh train

Remember coming two hours
early to the game when the
Red Zone was on the other
side of the stadium in the baking
sun? Remember when you had to
actually pay to get into the game?
1 low about 1-11. when losing to Cal
by nine as 4((-point underdogs was a
"moral victory"?
And who can forget Walt Harris?
Chances are, half of the current
students don't remember, but two
years ago, Stanford football had
reached an all-time low and no signs
of change were in sight.
Unfortunately, the flaws of the
program were seemingly inherent.
Stanford had no chance of compet
ing with big-time programs such as
Southern California or Ohio State,
who have much less stringent stan
dards of admission for their players.
Adding insult to injury. Stanford
could not win a single game that sea
son in the newly christened Stanford
Stadium, a jewel of a venue fit for
champions.
I'nduring 2006. I had learned to
lower my expectations considerably
for Stanford football. One win? At
least we weren't shut out.Two wins?
Okay, now we're talking. But four or
more? I must be dreaming.
So take it with a grain of salt when
I say Stanford has made progress by
leaps and bounds since 1-11 in 2006.
Before anything else, let's get it
straight — we're no USC. Cal or
even IJCLA (despite their poor play
this season), limes have changed
considerably, recruitment especially.
and once you accept that, you can fi
nally appreciate what Stanford has
done in the last two years of turning
around the program.
No more Tyrone Willingham?
Let's bring in the young Palo Alto
native Jim Harbaugh.
Poor attendance at games? Let's
give free tickets to students to boost
home-field advantage. While we're
at it, let's guarantee season tickets to
our regular fans.
While Stanford has done its
share to help the team rebound, the
rest of the burden fell on Harbaugh
and his players.
Last year, Stanford quadrupled
its 2006 win total. With the incredi
ble upset of USC and winning its
first Big Game since 2001, Stanford
showed that it was headed in the
right direction. A good team?
Probably not. A lucky one? Defi
nitely.
Entering this season. Stanford
still had much to prove, especially
at Stanford Stadium, where they
were 1-11. It's one thing to lose
away, but to lose at home is a slap
in the face. And to lose your home
coming game in front of thousands
of alumni? Inexcusable.
I'll be honest: I didn't expect the
2008 incarnation of Cardinal foot
ball to win yesterday's game. Ari
zona boasted a gaudy 4-1 record
and seemed poised for the victory
after Stanford's sloppy play at
South Bend. Ind.
Stanford seemed doomed to
lose its third-straight reunion
weekend match up.
Even during the game. Stanford
continued the sloppy play and
trailed despite having more total
yardage — a rarity for Stanford
football games. But with a minute
left. Stanford finally showed some
backbone and stormed back for
the win behind quarterback
turned-running-back Alex Loukas.
24-23.
Sound familiar? Okay,so maybe
it wasn't exactly as big as the USC
upset last season, but it was impor
tant in its own way.
With the win. Stanford equaled
its win total of last year just halfway
through the season. The Cardinal is
3-1 in the Pac-10 (as weak as it may

Bowl Game? Let's

be this season), and more impor
tantly. it's 3-0 at home.
Stanford has shown pure grit to
hold on to close games or come back
as it did on Saturday. It has shown
that it can win games it's supposed
to. relying less on luck and more on
ability.
On lop of that, there were some
odd reversals in comparison to the
team's 2006 homecoming loss to
Arizona.
Two years ago. Stanford returned
an interception for a touchdown.
This year, you guessed it.the Wild
cats returned the favor.
Back then. Arizona had 220
yards rushing compared to Stan
ford's -6 — yes. minus six yards. Sat
urday, it was Stanford who dominat
ed the running game 286-77.
In that game, Arizona dominated
the ball for almost two thirds of the
game.This year. Stanford edged out
the Wildcats 35-25 in possession
time.
Finally, the Wildcats' third-string
quarterback led them to victory that
year. This year, Stanford's third
stringer did the same.
Coincidence? Maybe. A sign of a
reversal in Stanford's fortune? One
can only hope.
So again with a grain of salt,
kudos to you, Stanford football.
Kudos for defending our house.
Kudos for showing some backbone.
And kudos for exceeding my expec
tations.
Beat USC? Check.
Win Big Game? Check.
Win I lomecoming? Check.
Play in and maybe win a Bowl
(iame? Let's talk in a few weeks.
