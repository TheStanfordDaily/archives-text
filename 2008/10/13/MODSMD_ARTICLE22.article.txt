presses it swept both matches in its homecoming weekend se
ries at Maples Pavilion.The Cardinal's victories over Arizona
and Arizona State kept it undefeated in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence and atop the conference standings.
Stanford's (15-2.6-0 Pac-10) three-set victory over No. 25
Arizona on Friday night came in very easy fashion as they eas
ily put away the Wildcats 25-18, 25-18,25-16. The Cardinal's
front line just proved to be too much for Arizona, scoring

nearly at will, while put
ting up a brick wall for the
Wildcat hitters.
Senior Cynthia Bar
ho/a. fresh off of a historic
weekend in Washington,
looked equally remark
able in the match Friday
night at Maples. The out
side hitter recorded 12
kills and 11 digs for her
sixth double-double of the
year to help the Cardinal
extend its winning streak.
Her play was outstanding,
as she essentially picked
her spots on the floor.
Stanford also received a
boost from sophomore
Alix Klineman, who
joined Barboza in double
digit kills by notching 11
on the night. The team
continued its season-long
offensive outpouring, hit

GAME NOTES: Stanford is now 15-2 on
the year and undefeated in Pac-10
play. The team has been dominant, as
it hasn't lost a single game in any of its
last seven matches. The Cardinal's
next three matches â€¢ against Cal, USC
and UCLA - should definitely provide
a test, though.
