and Arizona State kept it undefeated in the Pacific-10 Confer
ence and atop the conference standings.
Stanford's (15-2.6-0 Pac-10) three-set victory over No. 25
Arizona on Friday night came in very easy fashion as they eas
ily put away the Wildcats 25-18, 25-18,25-16. The Cardinal's
front line just proved to be too much for Arizona, scoring

nearly at will, while put
ting up a brick wall for the
Wildcat hitters.
Senior Cynthia Bar
ho/a. fresh off of a historic
weekend in Washington,
looked equally remark
able in the match Friday
night at Maples. The out
side hitter recorded 12
kills and 11 digs for her
sixth double-double of the
year to help the Cardinal
extend its winning streak.
Her play was outstanding,
as she essentially picked
her spots on the floor.
Stanford also received a
boost from sophomore
Alix Klineman, who
joined Barboza in double
digit kills by notching 11
on the night. The team
continued its season-long
offensive outpouring, hit

GAME NOTES: Stanford is now 15-2 on
the year and undefeated in Pac-10
play. The team has been dominant, as
it hasn't lost a single game in any of its
last seven matches. The Cardinal's
next three matches â€¢ against Cal, USC
and UCLA - should definitely provide
a test, though.

coming out in the third set with just
as much ferocity as in the first.
There was also concern that the
team might sleep on an opponent
like Arizona State, especially after
disposing of a ranked team like Ari
zona. The Cardinal remained as
strong as ever, though, breezing by
the Sun Devils on Sunday afternoon
25-18,25-13,2546.
Senior Foluke Akinradewo, who
was rather quiet in Friday night's vic
tory, turned this homecoming week
end into one she would never forget.
The middle blocker recorded 12
blocks, her most in a single game
since 2005. Her performance was the
ninth best in Stanford history. Akin
radewo vaulted herself among the

top-five blockers in Cardinal history,
joining players like Olympic champi
on Kerri Walsh.
Akinradewo added 12 kills for
her second career double-double.
She was joined by Klineman as the
only two members of the Cardinal
with double-digit kills. Klineman im
pressed once again with 12 kills on
357 hitting. Hitting over .300 lias he
come customary for the Cardinal, as
the team exited Maples on Sunday
with a .323 hitting percentage, its
10th game in a row over .300.
The attention, however, remained
fixed on Akinradewo and her defen
sive counterparts, whose prowess al
lowed Stanford to set a team record
for blocks in a game at 15. Lichtman
joined the block party, recording a
career high with four stuffs. The Sun

Devils were held to a miserable .009
hitting percentage on the night as
they felt the effects of the Stanford
pressure.
After the weekend sweep, the
Cardinal has not lost since a Sept. 6
upset by Saint Louis and has only
lost one set since the upset by the
Billikens. The team's 11-match win
ning streak has allowed them to
keep pace with California atop the
Pac-10.
No. 4 Stanford next takes on No. 5
Cal (16-1,6-0) this Sunday in a show
case of the only two undefeated
teams in the Pac-10. The game is set
lor 12:30 p.m. at Maples Pavilion and
will be televised by Fox Sports Net.
