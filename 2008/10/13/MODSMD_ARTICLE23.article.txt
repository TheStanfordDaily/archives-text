this weekend, remaining undefeated after an impressive

pair of shutout victo

foes Oregon and Ore

The opening of Fri

for the C Cardinal (12-

last five games.

fense with impressive footwork and twice came close to
drawing penalty kicks. Senior captain Allison Falk con
tributed to the attack as well, heading freshman Teresa
Noyola's corner kick into the crossbar in the 14th minute.
At 23:13.junior Kristin Stannard gave the Cardinal the
lead on a heads-up play off a Cardinal corner kick, tapping
in a rebound after a quick peppering of Stanford shots.
The Cardinal offense continued to press hard in the
first half, holding the Ducks to just two shots on goal. Ju
nior forward Kelley O'Hara had several impressive
chances, including a soaring shot
from the corner and an all-alone
drive from the midfield to deep into
Duck territory, juking past several
players in the process. Oregon did a
nice job just to not allow a bigger
deficit develop in the first half.
Just 13 minutes into the second
half, though. Stannard notched her
second goal of the contest, kicking in
an aerial pass from fellow midfielder
Camille Levin.The goal came after a
very long Stanford possession in
Oregon's zone, indicative of the
dominating offensive control that
the Cardinal was able to impose on
the Ducks.
The goal left Stannard with near
ly 30 minutes remaining in which to
go for her third, but despite a strong
performance to finish up the game,
the final goal never came. Following
her second goal. Stannard said she
definitely had "thoughts of a hat
trick." Ultimately, though, "it just
wasn't in the cards for me." she said.
"Friday marked the first two-goal
game of my college career, so I was
n't in the least bit disappointed."
Stannard said. "It was quite an excit
ing night, to say the least."
Stannard finished the game with
five shots.
A last-minute goal bv substitute
sophomore Morgan Redman would
prove more than enough to seal the
deal for the Cardinal in Friday
night's match-up.
The story was the same in Sun
day's game against Oregon State: an
other 3-0 shutout, another defensive
showcase that held the Beavers to
only a few shots and even another
two-goal game for a Cardinal mid
fielder.
It was freshman forward Lindsay

Taylor — the Cardinal's leading goal
scorer — however, who opened up
the offense on Sunday, with an im
pressive, spiraling shot on a free kick.
The goal came just 10 minutes into
the game, and was Taylor's 10th of
the season.
Only a couple of minutes later.

freshman Camille Levin put the Car
dinal up 2-0 with a quick reaction to
a rebounded shot from junior for
ward Kelley OTlara.
O'llara would be awarded with
her team-leading eighth assist on the
season, and she had several nice
scoring opportunities throughout

the game.
The game slowed down for a time
after Levin's goal, but Cardinal goal
keeper Kira Maker didn't lose any
focus. In the 63rd minute she made a
spectacular fingertip save, diving to
her right to force a powerful shot out
of bounds. It was her onlv save of the

contest, a testament to Stanford's ex
perienced. controlling defense.
Levin would add another goal in
the 71st minute, sending a long, curl
ing shot from the right corner of the
box to the left side of the net. Junior
Hillary Heath was credited with an
assist for setting up the play. Levin's

"Our midfielders are developing

that the team's success was largely

The Cardinal coach was pleased

drawing penalty kicks. Senior captain Allison Falk con
tributed to the attack as well, heading freshman Teresa
Noyola's corner kick into the crossbar in the 14th minute.
At 23:13.junior Kristin Stannard gave the Cardinal the
lead on a heads-up play off a Cardinal corner kick, tapping
in a rebound after a quick peppering of Stanford shots.
The Cardinal offense continued to press hard in the
first half, holding the Ducks to just two shots on goal. Ju
nior forward Kelley O'Hara had several impressive
chances, including a soaring shot
from the corner and an all-alone
drive from the midfield to deep into
Duck territory, juking past several
players in the process. Oregon did a
nice job just to not allow a bigger
deficit develop in the first half.
Just 13 minutes into the second
half, though. Stannard notched her
second goal of the contest, kicking in
an aerial pass from fellow midfielder
Camille Levin.The goal came after a
very long Stanford possession in
Oregon's zone, indicative of the
dominating offensive control that
the Cardinal was able to impose on
the Ducks.
The goal left Stannard with near
ly 30 minutes remaining in which to
go for her third, but despite a strong
performance to finish up the game,
the final goal never came. Following
her second goal. Stannard said she
definitely had "thoughts of a hat
trick." Ultimately, though, "it just
wasn't in the cards for me." she said.
"Friday marked the first two-goal
game of my college career, so I was
n't in the least bit disappointed."
Stannard said. "It was quite an excit
ing night, to say the least."
Stannard finished the game with
five shots.
A last-minute goal bv substitute
sophomore Morgan Redman would
prove more than enough to seal the
deal for the Cardinal in Friday
night's match-up.
The story was the same in Sun
day's game against Oregon State: an
other 3-0 shutout, another defensive
showcase that held the Beavers to
only a few shots and even another
two-goal game for a Cardinal mid
fielder.
It was freshman forward Lindsay

Taylor — the Cardinal's leading goal
scorer — however, who opened up
the offense on Sunday, with an im
pressive, spiraling shot on a free kick.
The goal came just 10 minutes into
the game, and was Taylor's 10th of
the season.
Only a couple of minutes later.

freshman Camille Levin put the Car
dinal up 2-0 with a quick reaction to
a rebounded shot from junior for
ward Kelley OTlara.
O'llara would be awarded with
her team-leading eighth assist on the
season, and she had several nice
scoring opportunities throughout

the game.
The game slowed down for a time
after Levin's goal, but Cardinal goal
keeper Kira Maker didn't lose any
focus. In the 63rd minute she made a
spectacular fingertip save, diving to
her right to force a powerful shot out
of bounds. It was her onlv save of the

contest, a testament to Stanford's ex
perienced. controlling defense.
Levin would add another goal in
the 71st minute, sending a long, curl
ing shot from the right corner of the
box to the left side of the net. Junior
Hillary Heath was credited with an
assist for setting up the play. Levin's

head coach
two-goal performance matched
Stannard's on Friday. Both are mid
fielders. and half of their combined
goals — a total of eight on the season
— came this weekend.
Stanford coach Paul Ratcliffe was
impressed with the play of his mid
field. but was quick to point out that
important contributions were com
ing from players across the field.
"Our midfielders are developing
well," Ratcliffe said, before adding
that the team's success was largely
"thanks to the forwards pressing
hard and creating opportunities."
The Cardinal coach was pleased
with his team's performance, noting
that it was "nice to get the added con
fidence" from continuing to perform
well as Pac-1() play begins.
"It's a tough conference," he said,
"and it's always good to start off
strong."
Every team in the Pac-10 had a
winning record coming into play on
Friday, and it should indeed prove to
be a tough road ahead. This coming
weekend, the Stanford women will
head north to face Washington and
Washington State.
