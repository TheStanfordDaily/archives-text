# Brokaw sits down with The Daily
## Q & A TOM BROKAW 
### DEVIN BANERJEE MANAGING EDITOR 
Veteran news anchor Tom Brokaw arrived in Palo
Alto on Friday afternoon in preparation for
Stanford's third annual Reunion Homecoming
Roundtable. Brokaw. who moderated the Saturday
morning discussion, served 21 years as anchor and
managing editor of NBC Nightly News and currently
serves as interim moderator of Meet the Press. Last
week, he moderated the second of three presidential
debates between Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and
Sen. Barack Obama (D-I1I.).
In the late '90s, Brokaw carried NBC to the top of
the evening news ratings, becoming America's most
watched anchor until his retirement from Nightly
News in 2004. He has collected a dozen Emmy awards,
two Peabody and duPont awards, the Edward R.
Murrow Lifetime Achievement Award and the Emmy
Award for Lifetime Achievement.
Brokaw agreed to sit down with The Daily's Devin
Banerjee Ml to discuss last week's debate, next

month's election and the future of journalism.
Brokaw also touched upon his daughters, one of
whom graduated from Stanford in "We had a
daughter at Stanford and a daughter at Berkeley
simultaneously," he said. "It was like having one as a
member of the Grateful Dead and the other as a
member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir."
The Stanford Daily: Let's talk a little bit about
Tuesday's debate. How does a moderator, or you
specifically, prepare for such a night?
Tom Brokaw: In that case, I wanted to he on top of the
news because there had been so much change since
they had last met in Oxford, Mississippi, with the eco
nomic situation. Ilien I looked at their earlier debates
and appearances on a number of other important sub

jects— Afghanistan, social security reform, health
care — and tried to think of questions that would
advance our understanding of their positions on those
issues. I was in an unusual situation because it was a
town-hall format, so I had questions from people in
the hall and from online. My role was to both direct
those questions and then follow up so they could have
some discussion of the areas that were raised by the
people in the town hall. If you saw. they didn't play by
the rules very well.
SI): In your opinion, how much of a journalist does a
moderator need to be?
IB: It's tricky. I am not entirely happy with the
process. Jim 1 .ehrer is a really good friend of mine, and
we've talked about this over the years. He feels very
strongly that somebody has to be there, and so he has
volunteered a lot in the past. I wasn't asked a lot in the
past, in part because I had a role as an anchorman for
NBC News.and it they picked me they'd have to pick
Dan [Rather] or they'd have to pick Peter [Jennings].
So it was always good to go to Jim
because he was excellent at it, and he
was eager to have it done so that the
country would have a chance to hear
these candidates. I think [the topic] is
probably worth revisiting. 1 think
you need to have better ground
rules. I think you should always have
a journalist who can follow up with
questions and has enough leeway to
pursue them a little bit. The candi
dates and the campaigns come in
with pretty strict rules about time
limits, but you can't turn the whole
process over to the campaigns — I
just think that's inappropriate.
SD: You asked [the candidates] if
they think the economy will get
worse before it gets better. You've
probably talked to very prominent
and knowledgeable people about
this.
TB: I don't know why they couldn't
step up and say, "It's going to get
worse before it gets better." I think
the country wants to hear honesty. I
don't know of anyone I've been
talking to at very senior levels —
everyone form Warren Buffet down
— who doesn't believe it's going to
get worse before it gets better. Does
that mean we won't ever get out?
No. Three months ago I was told by
a very sophisticated guy on Wall
Street, who was a survivor and has
done well and all, that he thought
the worst was over for Wall Street.
And now he says, "1 just don't know
where it goes." because conditions
have changed so dramatically —
everything happens at warp speed.
It's much more complex than it
used to be. Derivatives and mort
gage backed securities — nobody
has their hands on them. They just
move around out there in that kind
of electronic ether, and when they
hit, they hit hard. There are 12 mil
lion homes in America that are
worth less than their mortgages right
now. That's an unsettling, disquieting
number. And then the ripple effect
— they don't pay their property
taxes, then their communities can't
fund fire and police and don't pay
their fair share into the state budget.
So right down the line, it has a big
effect.
SD: John McCain — you've known
the senator a long time. You've cov
ered him in the past, when some

journalists say he was very open and
straight talking. Obviously, an elec
tion changes this. How much do you
feel he's been straight-jacketed by
his aides, himself and this election?
TB: One of the things that hap
pened with McCain is that to get the
nomination, he had to recalibrate a
little bit; because you get the nomi
nation within the party, and the base
of the party — which is an overused
phrase — is more conservative than
he is, by and large, even though he's
quite conservative, and they had
real suspicions about him.
Suspicions about global warming
and his embrace of that, campaign
finance reform and immigration. So
politics is always the art of compro
mise, and he had to make some
compromises in pursuit of the nom
ination and then to hold the party
together. So he is a different person
now than he was.
SI): The media is obviously
omnipresent in an election. You've
covered every election since 1%8. Is
the candidate "recalibration" you
just mentioned something you've
always seen?
TB: Yeah. I have. Every candidate is
fine-tuning themselves constantly.
Look. Barack Obama said last
spring that he'd be willing to meet
John McCain in a series of town
halls around the country and then
said no. He said he'd take public
financing, and then when he realized
what an advantage he would have
because of his capacity for raising
money, especially online, he said no.
So yeah, every candidate fine-tunes
their position as they go along.
SI): Sarah Palin — why do you think
McCain picked her? What role does
she play in this campaign?
TB: For one thing, because she was
such a new figure, so wholly unex
pected. And because of her style —
she has a very winning style and is
charismatic in her own way. She lit
up the convention hall in St. Paul.
They were kind of dragging them
selves into their chairs every night,
and then they realized that they had
Sarah Palin on the ticket. Anil she
was this younger, attractive woman
— the motto in Alaska is. "coldest
state, hottest governor" — as she
made that very winning speech that
night. Even Joe Biden — we were
replaying part of it for him on Meet
the Press, and he laughed out loud
when she said being a mayor and
being a community organizer are a
lot alike, except a mayor has actual
responsibilities.That was a good line.

"Every candidate fine-tunes their positions as they
go along."
— TOM BROKAW

She had several good lines.
SI): The fact that she's a woman —
what impact does that have?
TB: 1 think it's not just that she's a
woman, but that she does have these
unusual characteristics. She can kill
grouse and moose, she comes from
Alaska, nobody had heard of her a
month ago, then suddenly she's the
hottest ceiebritv in the country. Tina
Fey helped make her famous on
primetime specials and on Saturday
Night Live. Her very appearance, the
choice of glasses frames, and how
she wears her hair and what her
whole background is up there. All
these other candidates had become
very familiar, and then suddenly
there was this kind of fresh new wind
blowing through the campaigns, so
people responded to that. And I
think Republicans especially felt
that thev had a new enerev in their

campaign, and that she was one to go
out there and play hardball.
SI): With a woman, an African
American, no incumbents —
TB: — a POW
SI): ... do the dynamics in this elec
tion parallel those of any you've cov
ered in the past?
TB: No.The last one that came close
was 1%8, when Lyndon Johnson
announced he would not run for re
election. Bobby Kennedy came out
after Gene McCarthy, who was kind
of a poetic and scholarly man and
had effectively challenged Johnson
unsuccessfully in New Hampshire;
although he didn't win. he demon
strated there was so much anti-war
vote that Johnson would have a hard
time winning. So he had the new
"Young Turks" challenging the old
party establishment. Humphrey gels
the nomination, George Wallace eets

in as a third-party candidate and
Richard Nixon rises from his politi
cal ashes to run as the Republican
candidate. The dynamics that year
were pretty spectacular as well.
SI): Journalism is a morphing pro
fession. Print journalism is strug
gling. Technology is being imple
mented more and more every day.
How do you see people getting their
news in. say 50 years?
TB: I'd like to know what's going to
happen in 50 days, much less 50
years. Look, here's what 1 think.
There will always be a need for skill
ful journalists — men and women
who can go out and get at the essen
tial truth of what's going on in socie
ty, and in the government, and in the
economy, and in the academy, and
get it pulled together in a form that
is useful to their fellow citizens.
ITiat's the role of journalists, so that

people have a place they can turn to.
What is that place going to be in 50
years? It's very hard to know.
Obviously, 50 years from now, the
role of movable print on paper will
be a whole lot less than it is now. Will
it disappear entirely? I don't know.
50 years from now, I'll be gone. My
granddaughter, who is now 12, will
be 62. She loves reading books, she
likes the tactile experience, but at
the same time she's very electronic.
So I don't know.
SI): Another kind of "journalism,"
you might call it, could be found in
political humor — The Daily Show,
Saturday Night Live.
TB: Yeah, that's not journalism. It's
humor. But it's good.
SI): It's influencing a lot of people. A
lot of people see it as a comedic
break, especially from an election
that's been carrying on for almost
two years now. Do you see it as
something appropriate, maybe even
necessary?
TB: Yeah, 1 do. I think humor has
always been a part of politics. Listen,
Abraham Lincoln was a very funny
man —he used his humor as a
wicked tool against his opponents
very often. Winston Churchill had
this very, very rapier wit that he used
in his speeches as a politician. And
now we have just so many more out
lets for it, with Jon Stewart, Stephen
Colbert and Saturday Night Live.
And if it brings people to the arena,
I think it's a good thing. I don't know
of anyone who says, "Listen, I'm
going to vote based on what Jon
Stewart tells me," but I do think that
there are a lot of young people who
would not be paying attention to
politics as closely as they are if it
were not for Jon or for Stephen or
for Saturday Night Live, or for
David Letterman for that matter.
SI): Just curious: Last night
[Thursday night], SNL taped a skit
with Chris Parnell playing you as
moderator of Tuesday's debate.
Have you seen it?
TB: I haven't seen the last one —
the Thursday-night tape. [SNL
Producer] Lome Michaels said.
"Come back and play yourself," but
I was going to be out here so I said 1
couldn't do it. I just don't go on. But
1 hear it was prettv lunnv.
SI): I lave you ever considered host
ing. like Brian Williams has?
TB: [Laughs) Brian and I talk about
it. It's not for me.

TB: One of the things that hap
pened with McCain is that to get the
nomination, he had to recalibrate a
little bit; because you get the nomi
nation within the party, and the base
of the party — which is an overused
phrase — is more conservative than
he is, by and large, even though he's
quite conservative, and they had
real suspicions about him.
Suspicions about global warming
and his embrace of that, campaign
finance reform and immigration. So
politics is always the art of compro
mise, and he had to make some
compromises in pursuit of the nom
ination and then to hold the party
together. So he is a different person
now than he was.
SI): The media is obviously
omnipresent in an election. You've
covered every election since 1%8. Is
the candidate "recalibration" you
just mentioned something you've
always seen?
TB: Yeah. I have. Every candidate is
fine-tuning themselves constantly.
Look. Barack Obama said last
spring that he'd be willing to meet
John McCain in a series of town
halls around the country and then
said no. He said he'd take public
financing, and then when he realized
what an advantage he would have
because of his capacity for raising
money, especially online, he said no.
So yeah, every candidate fine-tunes
their position as they go along.
SI): Sarah Palin — why do you think
McCain picked her? What role does
she play in this campaign?
TB: For one thing, because she was
such a new figure, so wholly unex
pected. And because of her style —
she has a very winning style and is
charismatic in her own way. She lit
up the convention hall in St. Paul.
They were kind of dragging them
selves into their chairs every night,
and then they realized that they had
Sarah Palin on the ticket. Anil she
was this younger, attractive woman
— the motto in Alaska is. "coldest
state, hottest governor" — as she
made that very winning speech that
night. Even Joe Biden — we were
replaying part of it for him on Meet
the Press, and he laughed out loud
when she said being a mayor and
being a community organizer are a
lot alike, except a mayor has actual
responsibilities.That was a good line.

"Every candidate fine-tunes their positions as they
go along."
— TOM BROKAW

She had several good lines.
SI): The fact that she's a woman —
what impact does that have?
TB: 1 think it's not just that she's a
woman, but that she does have these
unusual characteristics. She can kill
grouse and moose, she comes from
Alaska, nobody had heard of her a
month ago, then suddenly she's the
hottest ceiebritv in the country. Tina
Fey helped make her famous on
primetime specials and on Saturday
Night Live. Her very appearance, the
choice of glasses frames, and how
she wears her hair and what her
whole background is up there. All
these other candidates had become
very familiar, and then suddenly
there was this kind of fresh new wind
blowing through the campaigns, so
people responded to that. And I
think Republicans especially felt
that thev had a new enerev in their

campaign, and that she was one to go
out there and play hardball.
SI): With a woman, an African
American, no incumbents —
TB: — a POW
SI): ... do the dynamics in this elec
tion parallel those of any you've cov
ered in the past?
TB: No.The last one that came close
was 1%8, when Lyndon Johnson
announced he would not run for re
election. Bobby Kennedy came out
after Gene McCarthy, who was kind
of a poetic and scholarly man and
had effectively challenged Johnson
unsuccessfully in New Hampshire;
although he didn't win. he demon
strated there was so much anti-war
vote that Johnson would have a hard
time winning. So he had the new
"Young Turks" challenging the old
party establishment. Humphrey gels
the nomination, George Wallace eets

in as a third-party candidate and
Richard Nixon rises from his politi
cal ashes to run as the Republican
candidate. The dynamics that year
were pretty spectacular as well.
SI): Journalism is a morphing pro
fession. Print journalism is strug
gling. Technology is being imple
mented more and more every day.
How do you see people getting their
news in. say 50 years?
TB: I'd like to know what's going to
happen in 50 days, much less 50
years. Look, here's what 1 think.
There will always be a need for skill
ful journalists — men and women
who can go out and get at the essen
tial truth of what's going on in socie
ty, and in the government, and in the
economy, and in the academy, and
get it pulled together in a form that
is useful to their fellow citizens.
ITiat's the role of journalists, so that

people have a place they can turn to.
What is that place going to be in 50
years? It's very hard to know.
Obviously, 50 years from now, the
role of movable print on paper will
be a whole lot less than it is now. Will
it disappear entirely? I don't know.
50 years from now, I'll be gone. My
granddaughter, who is now 12, will
be 62. She loves reading books, she
likes the tactile experience, but at
the same time she's very electronic.
So I don't know.
SI): Another kind of "journalism,"
you might call it, could be found in
political humor — The Daily Show,
Saturday Night Live.
TB: Yeah, that's not journalism. It's
humor. But it's good.
SI): It's influencing a lot of people. A
lot of people see it as a comedic
break, especially from an election
that's been carrying on for almost
two years now. Do you see it as
something appropriate, maybe even
necessary?
TB: Yeah, 1 do. I think humor has
always been a part of politics. Listen,
Abraham Lincoln was a very funny
man —he used his humor as a
wicked tool against his opponents
very often. Winston Churchill had
this very, very rapier wit that he used
in his speeches as a politician. And
now we have just so many more out
lets for it, with Jon Stewart, Stephen
Colbert and Saturday Night Live.
And if it brings people to the arena,
I think it's a good thing. I don't know
of anyone who says, "Listen, I'm
going to vote based on what Jon
Stewart tells me," but I do think that
there are a lot of young people who
would not be paying attention to
politics as closely as they are if it
were not for Jon or for Stephen or
for Saturday Night Live, or for
David Letterman for that matter.
SI): Just curious: Last night
[Thursday night], SNL taped a skit
with Chris Parnell playing you as
moderator of Tuesday's debate.
Have you seen it?
TB: I haven't seen the last one —
the Thursday-night tape. [SNL
Producer] Lome Michaels said.
"Come back and play yourself," but
I was going to be out here so I said 1
couldn't do it. I just don't go on. But
1 hear it was prettv lunnv.
SI): I lave you ever considered host
ing. like Brian Williams has?
TB: [Laughs) Brian and I talk about
it. It's not for me.

MASARU OKA/The Stanford Daily
Veteran news anchor Tom Brokaw sat down on Friday with Managing Editor of News Devin Banerjee '1 1 at the Westin
Hotel in Palo Alto, one day before moderating the Reunion Homecoming Roundtable. Brokaw served 21 years as
anchor and managing editor of NBC Nightly News, and currently serves as interim moderator of Meet the Press.
Veteran news anchor Tom Brokaw arrived in Palo
Alto on Friday afternoon in preparation for
Stanford's third annual Reunion Homecoming
Roundtable. Brokaw. who moderated the Saturday
morning discussion, served 21 years as anchor and
managing editor of NBC Nightly News and currently
serves as interim moderator of Meet the Press. Last
week, he moderated the second of three presidential
debates between Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and
Sen. Barack Obama (D-I1I.).
In the late '90s, Brokaw carried NBC to the top of
the evening news ratings, becoming America's most
watched anchor until his retirement from Nightly
News in 2004. He has collected a dozen Emmy awards,
two Peabody and duPont awards, the Edward R.
Murrow Lifetime Achievement Award and the Emmy
Award for Lifetime Achievement.
Brokaw agreed to sit down with The Daily's Devin
Banerjee Ml to discuss last week's debate, next

month's election and the future of journalism.
Brokaw also touched upon his daughters, one of
whom graduated from Stanford in "We had a
daughter at Stanford and a daughter at Berkeley
simultaneously," he said. "It was like having one as a
member of the Grateful Dead and the other as a
member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir."
The Stanford Daily: Let's talk a little bit about
Tuesday's debate. How does a moderator, or you
specifically, prepare for such a night?
Tom Brokaw: In that case, I wanted to he on top of the
news because there had been so much change since
they had last met in Oxford, Mississippi, with the eco
nomic situation. Ilien I looked at their earlier debates
and appearances on a number of other important sub

jects— Afghanistan, social security reform, health
care — and tried to think of questions that would
advance our understanding of their positions on those
issues. I was in an unusual situation because it was a
town-hall format, so I had questions from people in
the hall and from online. My role was to both direct
those questions and then follow up so they could have
some discussion of the areas that were raised by the
people in the town hall. If you saw. they didn't play by
the rules very well.
SI): In your opinion, how much of a journalist does a
moderator need to be?
IB: It's tricky. I am not entirely happy with the
process. Jim 1 .ehrer is a really good friend of mine, and
we've talked about this over the years. He feels very
strongly that somebody has to be there, and so he has
volunteered a lot in the past. I wasn't asked a lot in the
past, in part because I had a role as an anchorman for
NBC News.and it they picked me they'd have to pick
Dan [Rather] or they'd have to pick Peter [Jennings].
So it was always good to go to Jim
because he was excellent at it, and he
was eager to have it done so that the
country would have a chance to hear
these candidates. I think [the topic] is
probably worth revisiting. 1 think
you need to have better ground
rules. I think you should always have
a journalist who can follow up with
questions and has enough leeway to
pursue them a little bit. The candi
dates and the campaigns come in
with pretty strict rules about time
limits, but you can't turn the whole
process over to the campaigns — I
just think that's inappropriate.
SD: You asked [the candidates] if
they think the economy will get
worse before it gets better. You've
probably talked to very prominent
and knowledgeable people about
this.
TB: I don't know why they couldn't
step up and say, "It's going to get
worse before it gets better." I think
the country wants to hear honesty. I
don't know of anyone I've been
talking to at very senior levels —
everyone form Warren Buffet down
— who doesn't believe it's going to
get worse before it gets better. Does
that mean we won't ever get out?
No. Three months ago I was told by
a very sophisticated guy on Wall
Street, who was a survivor and has
done well and all, that he thought
the worst was over for Wall Street.
And now he says, "1 just don't know
where it goes." because conditions
have changed so dramatically —
everything happens at warp speed.
It's much more complex than it
used to be. Derivatives and mort
gage backed securities — nobody
has their hands on them. They just
move around out there in that kind
of electronic ether, and when they
hit, they hit hard. There are 12 mil
lion homes in America that are
worth less than their mortgages right
now. That's an unsettling, disquieting
number. And then the ripple effect
— they don't pay their property
taxes, then their communities can't
fund fire and police and don't pay
their fair share into the state budget.
So right down the line, it has a big
effect.
SD: John McCain — you've known
the senator a long time. You've cov
ered him in the past, when some

journalists say he was very open and
straight talking. Obviously, an elec
tion changes this. How much do you
feel he's been straight-jacketed by
his aides, himself and this election?
TB: One of the things that hap
pened with McCain is that to get the
nomination, he had to recalibrate a
little bit; because you get the nomi
nation within the party, and the base
of the party — which is an overused
phrase — is more conservative than

it disappear entirely? I don't know.
50 years from now, I'll be gone. My
granddaughter, who is now 12, will
be 62. She loves reading books, she
likes the tactile experience, but at
the same time she's very electronic.
So I don't know.
SI): Another kind of "journalism,"
you might call it, could be found in
political humor — The Daily Show,
Saturday Night Live.
TB: Yeah, that's not journalism. It's
humor. But it's good.
SI): It's influencing a lot of people. A
lot of people see it as a comedic
break, especially from an election
that's been carrying on for almost
two years now. Do you see it as
something appropriate, maybe even
necessary?
TB: Yeah, 1 do. I think humor has
always been a part of politics. Listen,
Abraham Lincoln was a very funny
man —he used his humor as a
wicked tool against his opponents
very often. Winston Churchill had
this very, very rapier wit that he used
in his speeches as a politician. And
now we have just so many more out
lets for it, with Jon Stewart, Stephen
Colbert and Saturday Night Live.
And if it brings people to the arena,
I think it's a good thing. I don't know
of anyone who says, "Listen, I'm
going to vote based on what Jon
Stewart tells me," but I do think that
there are a lot of young people who
would not be paying attention to
politics as closely as they are if it
were not for Jon or for Stephen or
for Saturday Night Live, or for
David Letterman for that matter.
SI): Just curious: Last night
[Thursday night], SNL taped a skit
with Chris Parnell playing you as
moderator of Tuesday's debate.
Have you seen it?
TB: I haven't seen the last one —
the Thursday-night tape. [SNL
Producer] Lome Michaels said.
"Come back and play yourself," but
I was going to be out here so I said 1
couldn't do it. I just don't go on. But
1 hear it was prettv lunnv.
SI): I lave you ever considered host
ing. like Brian Williams has?
TB: [Laughs) Brian and I talk about
it. It's not for me.

MASARU OKA/The Stanford Daily
Veteran news anchor Tom Brokaw sat down on Friday with Managing Editor of News Devin Banerjee '1 1 at the Westin
Hotel in Palo Alto, one day before moderating the Reunion Homecoming Roundtable. Brokaw served 21 years as
anchor and managing editor of NBC Nightly News, and currently serves as interim moderator of Meet the Press.
Veteran news anchor Tom Brokaw arrived in Palo
Alto on Friday afternoon in preparation for
Stanford's third annual Reunion Homecoming
Roundtable. Brokaw. who moderated the Saturday
morning discussion, served 21 years as anchor and
managing editor of NBC Nightly News and currently
serves as interim moderator of Meet the Press. Last
week, he moderated the second of three presidential
debates between Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and
Sen. Barack Obama (D-I1I.).
In the late '90s, Brokaw carried NBC to the top of
the evening news ratings, becoming America's most
watched anchor until his retirement from Nightly
News in 2004. He has collected a dozen Emmy awards,
two Peabody and duPont awards, the Edward R.
Murrow Lifetime Achievement Award and the Emmy
Award for Lifetime Achievement.
Brokaw agreed to sit down with The Daily's Devin
Banerjee Ml to discuss last week's debate, next

month's election and the future of journalism.
Brokaw also touched upon his daughters, one of
whom graduated from Stanford in "We had a
daughter at Stanford and a daughter at Berkeley
simultaneously," he said. "It was like having one as a
member of the Grateful Dead and the other as a
member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir."
The Stanford Daily: Let's talk a little bit about
Tuesday's debate. How does a moderator, or you
specifically, prepare for such a night?
Tom Brokaw: In that case, I wanted to he on top of the
news because there had been so much change since
they had last met in Oxford, Mississippi, with the eco
nomic situation. Ilien I looked at their earlier debates
and appearances on a number of other important sub

jects— Afghanistan, social security reform, health
care — and tried to think of questions that would
advance our understanding of their positions on those
issues. I was in an unusual situation because it was a
town-hall format, so I had questions from people in
the hall and from online. My role was to both direct
those questions and then follow up so they could have
some discussion of the areas that were raised by the
people in the town hall. If you saw. they didn't play by
the rules very well.
SI): In your opinion, how much of a journalist does a
moderator need to be?
IB: It's tricky. I am not entirely happy with the
process. Jim 1 .ehrer is a really good friend of mine, and
we've talked about this over the years. He feels very
strongly that somebody has to be there, and so he has
volunteered a lot in the past. I wasn't asked a lot in the
past, in part because I had a role as an anchorman for
NBC News.and it they picked me they'd have to pick
Dan [Rather] or they'd have to pick Peter [Jennings].
So it was always good to go to Jim
because he was excellent at it, and he
was eager to have it done so that the
country would have a chance to hear
these candidates. I think [the topic] is
probably worth revisiting. 1 think
you need to have better ground
rules. I think you should always have
a journalist who can follow up with
questions and has enough leeway to
pursue them a little bit. The candi
dates and the campaigns come in
with pretty strict rules about time
limits, but you can't turn the whole
process over to the campaigns — I
just think that's inappropriate.
SD: You asked [the candidates] if
they think the economy will get
worse before it gets better. You've
probably talked to very prominent
and knowledgeable people about
this.
TB: I don't know why they couldn't
step up and say, "It's going to get
worse before it gets better." I think
the country wants to hear honesty. I
don't know of anyone I've been
talking to at very senior levels —
everyone form Warren Buffet down
— who doesn't believe it's going to
get worse before it gets better. Does
that mean we won't ever get out?
No. Three months ago I was told by
a very sophisticated guy on Wall
Street, who was a survivor and has
done well and all, that he thought
the worst was over for Wall Street.
And now he says, "1 just don't know
where it goes." because conditions
have changed so dramatically —
everything happens at warp speed.
It's much more complex than it
used to be. Derivatives and mort
gage backed securities — nobody
has their hands on them. They just
move around out there in that kind
of electronic ether, and when they
hit, they hit hard. There are 12 mil
lion homes in America that are
worth less than their mortgages right
now. That's an unsettling, disquieting
number. And then the ripple effect
— they don't pay their property
taxes, then their communities can't
fund fire and police and don't pay
their fair share into the state budget.
So right down the line, it has a big
effect.
SD: John McCain — you've known
the senator a long time. You've cov
ered him in the past, when some

journalists say he was very open and
straight talking. Obviously, an elec
tion changes this. How much do you
feel he's been straight-jacketed by
his aides, himself and this election?
TB: One of the things that hap
pened with McCain is that to get the
nomination, he had to recalibrate a
little bit; because you get the nomi
nation within the party, and the base
of the party — which is an overused
phrase — is more conservative than
he is, by and large, even though he's
quite conservative, and they had
real suspicions about him.
Suspicions about global warming
and his embrace of that, campaign
finance reform and immigration. So
politics is always the art of compro
mise, and he had to make some
compromises in pursuit of the nom
ination and then to hold the party
together. So he is a different person
now than he was.
SI): The media is obviously
omnipresent in an election. You've
covered every election since 1%8. Is
the candidate "recalibration" you
just mentioned something you've
always seen?
TB: Yeah. I have. Every candidate is
fine-tuning themselves constantly.
Look. Barack Obama said last
spring that he'd be willing to meet
John McCain in a series of town
halls around the country and then
said no. He said he'd take public
financing, and then when he realized
what an advantage he would have
because of his capacity for raising
money, especially online, he said no.
So yeah, every candidate fine-tunes
their position as they go along.
SI): Sarah Palin — why do you think
McCain picked her? What role does
she play in this campaign?
TB: For one thing, because she was
such a new figure, so wholly unex
pected. And because of her style —
she has a very winning style and is
charismatic in her own way. She lit
up the convention hall in St. Paul.
They were kind of dragging them
selves into their chairs every night,
and then they realized that they had
Sarah Palin on the ticket. Anil she
was this younger, attractive woman
— the motto in Alaska is. "coldest
state, hottest governor" — as she
made that very winning speech that
night. Even Joe Biden — we were
replaying part of it for him on Meet
the Press, and he laughed out loud
when she said being a mayor and
being a community organizer are a
lot alike, except a mayor has actual
responsibilities.That was a good line.

"Every candidate fine-tunes their positions as they
go along."
— TOM BROKAW

She had several good lines.
SI): The fact that she's a woman —
what impact does that have?
TB: 1 think it's not just that she's a
woman, but that she does have these
unusual characteristics. She can kill
grouse and moose, she comes from
Alaska, nobody had heard of her a
month ago, then suddenly she's the
hottest ceiebritv in the country. Tina
Fey helped make her famous on
primetime specials and on Saturday
Night Live. Her very appearance, the
choice of glasses frames, and how
she wears her hair and what her
whole background is up there. All
these other candidates had become
very familiar, and then suddenly
there was this kind of fresh new wind
blowing through the campaigns, so
people responded to that. And I
think Republicans especially felt
that thev had a new enerev in their

campaign, and that she was one to go
out there and play hardball.
SI): With a woman, an African
American, no incumbents —
TB: — a POW
SI): ... do the dynamics in this elec
tion parallel those of any you've cov
ered in the past?
TB: No.The last one that came close
was 1%8, when Lyndon Johnson
announced he would not run for re
election. Bobby Kennedy came out
after Gene McCarthy, who was kind
of a poetic and scholarly man and
had effectively challenged Johnson
unsuccessfully in New Hampshire;
although he didn't win. he demon
strated there was so much anti-war
vote that Johnson would have a hard
time winning. So he had the new
"Young Turks" challenging the old
party establishment. Humphrey gels
the nomination, George Wallace eets

in as a third-party candidate and
Richard Nixon rises from his politi
cal ashes to run as the Republican
candidate. The dynamics that year
were pretty spectacular as well.
SI): Journalism is a morphing pro
fession. Print journalism is strug
gling. Technology is being imple
mented more and more every day.
How do you see people getting their
news in. say 50 years?
TB: I'd like to know what's going to
happen in 50 days, much less 50
years. Look, here's what 1 think.
There will always be a need for skill
ful journalists — men and women
who can go out and get at the essen
tial truth of what's going on in socie
ty, and in the government, and in the
economy, and in the academy, and
get it pulled together in a form that
is useful to their fellow citizens.
ITiat's the role of journalists, so that

people have a place they can turn to.
What is that place going to be in 50
years? It's very hard to know.
Obviously, 50 years from now, the
role of movable print on paper will
be a whole lot less than it is now. Will
it disappear entirely? I don't know.
50 years from now, I'll be gone. My
granddaughter, who is now 12, will
be 62. She loves reading books, she
likes the tactile experience, but at
the same time she's very electronic.
So I don't know.
