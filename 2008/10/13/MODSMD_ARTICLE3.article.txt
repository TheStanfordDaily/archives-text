Brokaw agreed to sit down with The Daily's Devin
Banerjee Ml to discuss last week's debate, next

month's election and the future of journalism.
Brokaw also touched upon his daughters, one of
whom graduated from Stanford in "We had a
daughter at Stanford and a daughter at Berkeley
simultaneously," he said. "It was like having one as a
member of the Grateful Dead and the other as a
member of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir."
The Stanford Daily: Let's talk a little bit about
Tuesday's debate. How does a moderator, or you
specifically, prepare for such a night?
Tom Brokaw: In that case, I wanted to he on top of the
news because there had been so much change since
they had last met in Oxford, Mississippi, with the eco
nomic situation. Ilien I looked at their earlier debates
and appearances on a number of other important sub

jects— Afghanistan, social security reform, health
care — and tried to think of questions that would
advance our understanding of their positions on those
issues. I was in an unusual situation because it was a
town-hall format, so I had questions from people in
the hall and from online. My role was to both direct
those questions and then follow up so they could have
some discussion of the areas that were raised by the
people in the town hall. If you saw. they didn't play by
the rules very well.
SI): In your opinion, how much of a journalist does a
moderator need to be?
IB: It's tricky. I am not entirely happy with the
process. Jim 1 .ehrer is a really good friend of mine, and
we've talked about this over the years. He feels very
strongly that somebody has to be there, and so he has
volunteered a lot in the past. I wasn't asked a lot in the
past, in part because I had a role as an anchorman for
NBC News.and it they picked me they'd have to pick
Dan [Rather] or they'd have to pick Peter [Jennings].
