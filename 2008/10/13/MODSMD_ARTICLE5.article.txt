### DEVIN BANERJEE MANAGING EDITOR 
NBC's Tom Brokaw joined a panel of seven big
name guests Saturday morning at Maples Pavilion
to take part in Stanford's third annual Reunion
Homecoming Ronndtable. Panelists included
University President John Hennessy, Congressman
Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.). businesswoman Carly
Fiorina, Supreme Court associate justice Anthony
Kennedy, History Prof. David Kennedy. Gates
Foundation CEO Jeff Raikes and Global Fund for
Women CEO Kavita Ramdas.
Though the topic of the discussion was a serious
one — "Wanted: Courage. Compassion and
Character; Leadership for the 21st Century" —
Brokaw started the discussion on a light note.
"I know that 1 speak on behalf of this panel
when I say that I am very flattered to see the kind
of turnout we have here this morning," the veteran
news anchor said to the audience of alumni, stu
dents and visitors. "Especially when I realized that
for the price of admission for $10. you could have
bought controlling interest in any Wall Street finan
cial firm or any bank in America."
Brokaw then nodded his head to the University

with ;i question lor I lennessy:"lf you have compas
sion and conviction, can you get into Stanford?"
"That and good grades, I think you're okay." the
president responded to laughs in the pavilion.
On the topic ol leadership, Brokaw asked
Becerra whether the country has seen the kind of
leadership in Congress that is needed at this time.
The congressman's subsequent six-second pause
was a give-away.
Ramdas triggered applause from the pavilion
with her differentiation between individual and col
lective leadership.
"You fail to remember that the profound under
lying success of true leadership is recognizing that
we don't lead by just one person at a time." Ramdas
said, "[but] that we lead in a collective endeavor
and that the best leaders are those who recognize
that there are leaders all around them."
"Instead of looking for someone to sort of ride
in on a white horse and save us." she added,"we can
look to this notion of a collective leadership."
Justice Kennedy touched upon the leadership he
sees in the high court, noting that teaching plays a
major role.
"Teaching is a conscious act," the associate jus
tice said. "And you can't understand what you
haven't learned. You can't transmit to the next gen
eration what you do not revere, and you cannot
