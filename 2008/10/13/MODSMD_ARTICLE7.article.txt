Bill and Hillary Clinton to begin
campaigning for Barack Obama
When Bill and Hillary Clinton take the stage Sun
day at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania, it will be the
launch of an active campaign for their former neme
sis Barack Obama in the home stretch of the 2008
presidential race.
The nation's best known and most powerful De
mocrats for nearly two decades, the former first cou
ple is getting used to a new role: cheerleaders for
Obama, who vanquished Hillary Clinton last spring
in a Democratic primary contest for the ages.
Whatever recriminations the Clintons may still
harbor from that long battle seem to have been
nudged aside as they campaign in earnest for the De
mocratic ticket.
The New York senator and the former president
will appear with Obama's running mate. Joe Biden,
at a rally Sunday in Scranton. a working class town
that has assumed something of an outsize role in the
presidential race.
Biden was born in Scranton and lived there for
several years as a child, while Hillary Clinton's father
grew up in the town and is buried there. Both Biden
and Clinton have emphasized their Scranton roots to
illustrate their connection to blue collar voters.
Economic crisis chills expectations for
controlling global warming
Attempts to tackle global warming are being
made more difficult by the spreading economic crisis
even as Democratic congressional leaders say it's still
a top goal for next year.
At the very least, fear of a prolonged economic
downturn is expected to delay attempts by the Unit
ed States to cap greenhouse gases blamed for global
warming.
Democratic leaders in the House and the Senate
as well as both presidential candidates say addressing
climate change by imposing mandatory restrictions
on heat-trapping pollution — especially carbon diox
ide from burning fossil fuels — remains a priority.
Only months ago. the prospect of climate legisla
tion passing in the next Congress and becoming law
looked promising. Both presidential candidates
Barack Obama and John McCain support mandato
ry emission cuts and a Democratic majority vowed to
act on the problem early in the new year.
But the most popular remedy for slowing global
warming, a mechanism known as cap-and-trade,
could put further stress on a teetering economy by
raising energy prices.
McCain vows to whip Obama's 'you
know what'
Republican John McCain vowed Sunday to
"whip" Democratic rival Barack Obama's "you
know-what" when the two presidential candidates
meet Wednesday in their final televised debate.
McCain made that pledge as top advisers said he
is weighing new economic proposals to help the na
tion weather the financial crisis.The Arizona senator
refused to answer a reporter's question Sunday
about what plans he might be considering.
Addressing several dozen volunteers at his cam
paign headquarters outside Washington. McCain
promised some of his signature "straight talk" about
the state of the race.
"We're a couple points down. OK. nationally, but
we're right in this game," McCain said to cheers. "The
economy has hurt us a little bit in the last week or two,
but in the last few days we've seen it come back up be
cause they want experience, they want knowledge
and they want vision. We'll give that to America."
