North Korea has agreed to all U.S. nuclear in
spection demands and the Bush administration re
sponded Saturday by removing the communist
country from a terrorism blacklist. The break
through is intended to salvage a faltering disarma
ment accord before President Bush leaves office in
January.
"Every single element of verification that we
sought going in is part of this package," State De
partment Sean McCormack said at a a rare week
end briefing.
North Korea will allow atomic experts to take
samples and conduct forensic tests at all of its de
clared nuclear facilities and undeclared sites on
mutual consent. The North will permit experts to
verify that it has told the truth about transfers of
nuclear technology and an alleged uranium pro
gram.
"Verifying North Korea's nuclear proliferation
will be a serious challenge. This is most is the most
secret and opaque regime in the entire world," said
Patricia McNerney, assistant secretary for interna
tional security and nonprofileration.
The move followed days of intense internal de
bate in Washington and consultations with U.S. ne
gotiating partners China, South Korea. Russia and
Japan. Tokyo had balked at the move because
North Korea has not resolved issues related to its
abduction of Japanese citizens.
