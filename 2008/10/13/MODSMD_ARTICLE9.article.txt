# Bush meets with leaders of industrialized nations, but no new plan
## G-7 leaders pledge to resolve crisis 
### MARTIN CRUTSINGER THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
President Bush emerged from a meet
ing with foreign financial officials on Satur
day and pledged a global response to the
credit crisis that will lead toward a "path of
stability and long-term growth."
Bush announced no new strategies to
attack the economic woes circling the
globe, stressing instead, "We will do what it
takes to resolve the crisis and the world's
economy will emerge stronger as a result."
The president spoke in the Rose Gar
den outside the White House,joined there
in a show of solidarity not long after day
break by finance officials from the so
called G-7 — Japan. Germany, Britain,
France, Italy and Canada, in addition to the
United States. Treasury Secretary Henry
Paulson and Secretary of State Condoleez
za Rice also attended.
"The United States has a special role to
play in leading the response to this crisis"
the president said. "That is why I convened
this morning's meeting here at the White
House and it is why our government will
continue using all the tools at our disposal
to resolve this crisis."
He added,"As our nations carry out this
plan, we must ensure that the actions of
one country do not contradict or under
mine the actions of another. In an intercon
nected world, no nation will gain by driving
down the fortunes of another. We are in
this together. We will come through it to
gether."
Bush's comments were aimed at avoid
ing the mistakes that worsened economic
conditions during the Great Depression in
the 1930s.Then, some nations pursued go
it-alone strategies such as erecting protec
tionist trade barriers to shield their domes
tic industries. Those trade barriers ended
up only worsening the global downturn.
In the current crisis. Ireland moved to
guarantee all bank deposits, a decision that
triggered similar actions in Germany and
other nations which were concerned that

nervous depositors would move their bank
accounts to Ireland.
flie White I louse meeting lasted about
a half-hour, less than scheduled.
An even larger Group of 20 countries
— which include the wealthiest and the
world's biggest developing nations such as
China, Brazil and India — arranged a
meeting with Paulson later in the day.
It was the 21st time in 26 days that the
president has spoken publicly about the
credit crisis gripping the financial markets,
a crisis that has now infected the stock mar
kets. Congress heard testimony last week
that the retirement accounts of Americans
have lost $2 trillion in the past 15 months,
and the New York Stock Exchange Dow
Jones industrials average plummeted more
than 1S percent last week alone, the largest
ever in a week.
A wave of selling sent markets lower in
several Asian and European nations on
Friday, while other exchanges were closed

to prevent the same fate.
The stock selloffs stem from fears that
banking systems have essentially frozen up
around the world — a credit crisis that
took hold sharply three weeks ago in the
United States and has led to an escalating
series of interventions by the administra
tion and Federal Reserve. Officials have
also spoken openly of concerns that the
United States may be headed for a poten
tially deep recession.
ft was only eight days ago that Congress
approved a $700 billion bailout for the fi
nancial industry, and the Fed has pumped
billions of dollars into the economic system
hoping to provide greater access to credit
for potential borrowers.
On Friday. Paulson announced the
Treasury would begin buying part owner
ship in American banks, the first time the
government has taken such action since
the Depression of the 19305.
The administration's decision is an ef

fort tt) restore the depleted capital reserves
of banks, which have been forced to cut
back on loans because they have suffered
billions of dollars in losses in the current
mortgage meltdown.
The G-7 officials discussed the global
economic crisis for three hours on Friday
and issued one of the shortest commu
niques in the history of the group. It
pledged to take "all necessary steps to un
freeze credit and money markets" to end
the crisis.
Overseas officials also have injected bil
lions of dollars of reserves into their bank
ing systems with little effect so far. As the
markets plunged this past week, however,
the U.S. and other countries accelerated
their efforts.
The G-7 statement endorsed a program
to prevent the failure of major banks in
each of the countries, unfreeze credit and
money markets, bolster capital and deposit
insurance programs and get the battered
mortgage financing system operating more
normally.
It was the meltdown of the subprime
mortgage market with cascading defaults
that triggered the start of the credit crisis in
the United States in August 20()7.
While the G-7 group did not endorse all
the plans put forward, such as a proposal
from Britain that countries guarantee the
loans that banks make to each other, the fi
nance ministers said they believed they
had agreed on a comprehensive plan that
would show results.
French Finance Minister Christine La
garde called it a "coordinated, synchro
nized and rightly timed approach" while
German Finance Minister Peer Stein
brueck said that quick implementation was
critical because "the downward spiral is
picking up speed."
The question of how countries can deal
with the spreading financial crisis was
dominating discussions at the weekend
meetings of the 185-nation International
Monetary Fund and its sister lending insti
tution, the World Bank.
