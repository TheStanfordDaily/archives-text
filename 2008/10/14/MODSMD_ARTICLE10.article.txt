Defending the SAT from
the Pitchfork-Wielding Mob

You would think it was the Spanish
Inquisition from the tone and con
tent of the rhetoric coming from
those in the college admissions industry. The
National Association for College Admission
Counseling (NACAC) recently put out a
prestigious report, chaired by the Harvard
admissions chief, criticizing the SAT and
arguing for its lessened importance in
admissions decisions. It seems that the SAT
is being blamed for all that is wrong in col
lege admissions. Our own Editorial Board
has joined the pitchfork-wielding masses,
arguing for a "holistic" admissions process.
Everyone is jumping on the bandwagon.
The main criticism of the SAT, pre
dictably, comes along class and racial lines.
It's telling that the dominant talk in college
admissions has been about "access" and
"empowerment" rather than normative dis
cussions over what kind of students top col
leges should admit. Talk about the SAT
comes at the expense of more important
questions about the entire direction of col
lege admissions and the increasing pressure
it has on high school students. Critics argue
that test prep companies like Kaplan and
Princeton Review, which offer expensive
preparation courses, cause success on the
SAT to be heavily slanted to those who can
afford those courses. This is ironic, as the
SAT was once, long ago, an engine of social
mobility. Students from unknown or lower
income schools could ride a top-notch score
all the way to Harvard. Now, critics seem to
argue, it's preserving the existing social hier
archy.
The SAT, for what it's worth, remains one
of the more meritocratic components of the
college admissions process, despite the
recent criticism. College admissions
"experts" love to talk up the importance of
grades, but it's unclear how worthwhile that
is in Stanford's case â€” pretty much every
one applying has excellent grades. The SAT
offers students their only opportunity to
escape a bad school or a mediocre academ
ic record and prove their real worth. It's
telling that test prep companies never guar
antee a score increase, as it's unclear how
much classroom time helps versus just buy
ing a $20 book and going through it.
The test, ironically, is one of the least
stressful parts of a college application.

There's been a rising tide of critics, such as
the Stanford School of Education's Denise
Clark Pope, who argue that high-school stu
dents are over-worked and unhealthily
stressed. Students may stress about the SAT
for three months, but it does not match the
activity- and extracurricular-heavy admis
sions model Stanford and other schools now
espouse, which requires students to busy
themselves for four straight years. It's
unclear how the critics of the SAT somehow
want students to stress less by loading up on
activities throughout their high school years.
Blaming the SAT is the easy way out of a
real discussion of college admissions. The
test prep industry for the SAT only exists
because the SAT is important. If AP tests or
SAT II tests were more important, then
Kaplan would move over to them. And
attacking the test prep industry does not
even begin to address an increasing phe
nomenon: there are now "admissions con
sultants," usually former admissions officers,
who charge high rates for essay writing
assistance and admissions advice. The col
lege admissions process will always have
inequalities and opportunities for students
with the ingenuity and the income to game
the system.
The SAT has become a symbol for larger
debates about college admissions that
everyone is avoiding. We're on an inex
orable path that devalues pure academic
achievement and excellence toward the
"holistic" model of "soft" factors such as
activities, essays and experiences. This
method is contentious because, to many, it's
associated with affirmative action. Public
universities in California are forbidden by
law to practice affirmative action, but a
UCLA professor recently alleged that the
implementation of a new "holistic" process

in the school's admissions policies
resulted in "stealth" affirmative
action.
I don't think everyone is com
fortable with the way in which top
schools are increasingly admitting
their students. I certainly am not.
There needs to be a serious discus
sion about whether the decreasing
value of academic achievement in
the college admissions process ben
efits students entering university.
Many scholars have written about
the declining writing standards at
college and how serious intellectu
al engagement seems nonexistent
at many schools, including
Stanford. Getting rid of the SAT
won't solve those problems, or
even begin to. In many cases, it will
hurt.

Stuart wants every high schooler to
know that many job applications
require disclosure of one's SAT score.
It matters even more than you think!
