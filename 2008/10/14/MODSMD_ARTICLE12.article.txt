# Executive Experiences
## I can see Hoover Tower from my house 
### 
After the publication of my first Daily
column last week, I think I've proven
myself as the voice of the people. It's
time for me to step up my game.
I want power. Lots of power. Not Jonny
Dorsey-level power because he is a commu
nity organizer — and that's elitist. Plus, it's no
coincidence that if you rearrange the letters
in "community organizer" you get "Al-
Queda."
No, friends, I am ready to replace John
Hennessy as president of this University.
Sure, Hennessy's got "credentials," whatever
that means. But me — I'm a maverick. I con
tinuously resist vested party interests from
the Commie intellectuals over at The Daily
office. They want me to do things like not end
sentences with prepositions and write about
shit that actually matters, but I know what the
people really want.
Plus, I've had lots of executive experi
ences, way more than anyone else in the
entire world. Duh. Did you read my title?
I am also ridiculously well-informed.
Every week, I read my own column.
Sometimes I even read it twice. In addition, I

read lots of other prestigious news publica
tions, like the Chappie and emails on the
French House list serve.
Most important, however, is the fact that
you can see Hoover Tower from my house.
Can you see Hoover Tower from John
Hennessy's house? Doubtful. This just goes
to show that he embraces Ivy League values,
like the semester system, and that he secretly
hates Stanford. And the CoHo.
But enough of that. Let's talk more about
me.
Based on this short introduction, you may
not think I'm qualified to run Stanford.That's
just because you hate women. Wait until I tell
you about some of the great ideas I have. In a

few short paragraphs, even the most sexist
bastards out there will realize what a strong
leader I am, and that they hate gay people
way more than they hate women.
As university president. I will have a spe
cial fund set aside explicitly for the purpose
of driving around in a golf cart and pelting
freshmen with Frisbees. Some people might
call this "misappropriation of funds." or
"embezzlement," or one of those other big.
non-maverick words. I simply call it
"thinning the herd to make room for more
transfer students."
In memory of Leland Stanford Junior,
who had his own mini-train to take him
around the Stanford Stock Farm (true story),
I will also build a train that goes around cam
pus. It will operate between French House
and the Coho, and only I can ride it. This will
be a great source of revenue for the
University — especially in today's tough
economy — through the creation of new
jobs, like making me iced soy lattes.
Furthermore, under my leadership, we will
