# Executive Experiences
## I can see Hoover Tower from my house 
### 
After the publication of my first Daily
column last week, I think I've proven
myself as the voice of the people. It's
time for me to step up my game.
I want power. Lots of power. Not Jonny
Dorsey-level power because he is a commu
nity organizer — and that's elitist. Plus, it's no
coincidence that if you rearrange the letters
in "community organizer" you get "Al-
Queda."
No, friends, I am ready to replace John
Hennessy as president of this University.
Sure, Hennessy's got "credentials," whatever
that means. But me — I'm a maverick. I con
tinuously resist vested party interests from
the Commie intellectuals over at The Daily
office. They want me to do things like not end
sentences with prepositions and write about
shit that actually matters, but I know what the
people really want.
Plus, I've had lots of executive experi
ences, way more than anyone else in the
entire world. Duh. Did you read my title?
I am also ridiculously well-informed.
Every week, I read my own column.
Sometimes I even read it twice. In addition, I

read lots of other prestigious news publica
tions, like the Chappie and emails on the
French House list serve.
Most important, however, is the fact that
you can see Hoover Tower from my house.
Can you see Hoover Tower from John
Hennessy's house? Doubtful. This just goes
to show that he embraces Ivy League values,
like the semester system, and that he secretly
hates Stanford. And the CoHo.
But enough of that. Let's talk more about
me.
Based on this short introduction, you may
not think I'm qualified to run Stanford.That's
just because you hate women. Wait until I tell
you about some of the great ideas I have. In a

few short paragraphs, even the most sexist
bastards out there will realize what a strong
leader I am, and that they hate gay people
way more than they hate women.
As university president. I will have a spe
cial fund set aside explicitly for the purpose
of driving around in a golf cart and pelting
freshmen with Frisbees. Some people might
call this "misappropriation of funds." or
"embezzlement," or one of those other big.
non-maverick words. I simply call it
"thinning the herd to make room for more
transfer students."
In memory of Leland Stanford Junior,
who had his own mini-train to take him
around the Stanford Stock Farm (true story),
I will also build a train that goes around cam
pus. It will operate between French House
and the Coho, and only I can ride it. This will
be a great source of revenue for the
University — especially in today's tough
economy — through the creation of new
jobs, like making me iced soy lattes.
Furthermore, under my leadership, we will



Jenna
Reback
declare war on Cal. This will be my
top priority, besides replacing Full
Moon on the Quad with Prayer
Night for Abortion Victims. While
not a mandatory event, those who
choose not to attend will be asked
not to reenroll. Everyone else gets
free t-shirts.
But. to stay on topic, war on Cal is
necessary. I've never been there — I
only got a Caltrain pass last year —
but I'm told that it's full of dirty sub
versives who don't say the Pledge of
Allegiance every morning.
And whereas our university
motto is "The wind of freedom
blows," theirs is'i heart the Taliban."

Or something like that. I'll check that
out and get back to you.
There is no doubt that this war
will be hard. There are lots more of
them, and they are all angry because
they got rejected by Stanford. Yet
there is no doubt in my mind that we
can win, because we have a way big
ger endowment. And because it's
God's will.
In case you didn't get that refer
ence, by the way, I was quoting
Abraham Lincoln — who, inciden
tally, wrote for The Daily before
becoming the Great Emancipator.
Coincidence? I think not.
Doubtless. I will encounter
unforeseen problems as university
president. I'm not worried, though.
Whenever I don't know what to do,
I'll take off my University President
Hat and put on my Maverick Hat.
Then my Maverick Hat will tell me

that I belong in ... FroSoCo! Then I
will purge Green Library of all pagan
literature.
In short. I am going to be the best
president this university has ever
seen, which is why you should vote
for me whenever elections for uni
versity president are held next. I'm
principled, charismatic and I have
ovaries. But watch out for my bad
side — a vote against me will deprive
you of matriculation prospects and
any hopes of future employment.
For those who still doubt why
choose me and not any of those
other Daily columnists, I will admit
that Kevin Webb does have great
despot potential.
Too bad he pals around with Pete
Carroll.
