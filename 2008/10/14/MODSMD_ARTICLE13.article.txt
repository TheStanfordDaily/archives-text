112 irue love is coming your way.
Perhaps you think I jest. Perhaps you have
become convinced it could never happen to
you. Perhaps you are already in a committed
relationship with someone you genuinely
believe you love.
But if you have any of these thoughts, if
you really think that you are not about to
meet the love of your life at tonight's return
of Full Moon On The Quad, then I suggest
you stop drinking Crazy Juice. 1 also suggest
you break up with your significant other
before tonight. It'll be more fun for the rest of
us.
Full Moon On The Ouad is. of course, a
Stanford tradition as old as procreation itself.
Freshman and seniors (read: all four classes,
as well as graduate students and various ran
dom other people from the greater Palo Alto
community who want in on the action) gath
er in the Ouad for student concerts and per
formances until the clock strikes 12, followed
by a post-midnight PG-13 orgy You can
imagine where the night goes from there.
Holy Matrimony, baby.

In no particular order.
Yes, the romance will he in the air. How do
I know? From years of experience. I met and
made out with — for three or four unforget
table seconds — about 10 or 15 loves of my
life during Full Moon on the Quad in
October 2(M)5. And when the full moon rose
again the following fall, so again did I make
out with my 12 new true loves. ITie same
thing would have happened again last year,
but I was still sick from the various viruses I
had contracted during my previous year's
loving.
But this year, I'm back with a romantic
vengeance. And you should be, too. The best
part about FMOTQ, to use the event's
acronymic equivalent, is the fact that there

can be no ambiguity regarding the meaning
that accompanies each lip lock. It is each ine
briated participant's way of saying, "I am
deeply in love with you, and I want to take
care of you until kingdom come, or until the
moment I find another random attractive
person to kiss — whichever comes first."
It brings to mind an old saying that I just
made up for this column: "If the moon is full
at Stanford, never kiss someone if you are not
prepared to marry that person, particularly if
his or her flossing patterns are questionable."
Yet despite all the success, all the acco
lades— including the prestigious "Director's
Twig n' Berries" award for the school with
the most successful mass make-out session
after midnight in the month of October —
FMOTQ still has its detractors. One simply
has to open one's ears to hear the critics
scream in the unified voice of vehement anti
love bias.
Their arguments are manifold. Some
claim that FMOTQ simply increases the
spread of viruses. Indeed, several of Cupid's
arrows last year were found to have con-
