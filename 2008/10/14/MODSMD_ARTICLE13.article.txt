## Full mast on the Quad 
### 
112 irue love is coming your way.
Perhaps you think I jest. Perhaps you have
become convinced it could never happen to
you. Perhaps you are already in a committed
relationship with someone you genuinely
believe you love.
But if you have any of these thoughts, if
you really think that you are not about to
meet the love of your life at tonight's return
of Full Moon On The Quad, then I suggest
you stop drinking Crazy Juice. 1 also suggest
you break up with your significant other
before tonight. It'll be more fun for the rest of
us.
Full Moon On The Ouad is. of course, a
Stanford tradition as old as procreation itself.
Freshman and seniors (read: all four classes,
as well as graduate students and various ran
dom other people from the greater Palo Alto
community who want in on the action) gath
er in the Ouad for student concerts and per
formances until the clock strikes 12, followed
by a post-midnight PG-13 orgy You can
imagine where the night goes from there.
Holy Matrimony, baby.

In no particular order.
Yes, the romance will he in the air. How do
I know? From years of experience. I met and
made out with — for three or four unforget
table seconds — about 10 or 15 loves of my
life during Full Moon on the Quad in
October 2(M)5. And when the full moon rose
again the following fall, so again did I make
out with my 12 new true loves. ITie same
thing would have happened again last year,
but I was still sick from the various viruses I
had contracted during my previous year's
loving.
But this year, I'm back with a romantic
vengeance. And you should be, too. The best
part about FMOTQ, to use the event's
acronymic equivalent, is the fact that there

can be no ambiguity regarding the meaning
that accompanies each lip lock. It is each ine
briated participant's way of saying, "I am
deeply in love with you, and I want to take
care of you until kingdom come, or until the
moment I find another random attractive
person to kiss — whichever comes first."
It brings to mind an old saying that I just
made up for this column: "If the moon is full
at Stanford, never kiss someone if you are not
prepared to marry that person, particularly if
his or her flossing patterns are questionable."
Yet despite all the success, all the acco
lades— including the prestigious "Director's
Twig n' Berries" award for the school with
the most successful mass make-out session
after midnight in the month of October —
FMOTQ still has its detractors. One simply
has to open one's ears to hear the critics
scream in the unified voice of vehement anti
love bias.
Their arguments are manifold. Some
claim that FMOTQ simply increases the
spread of viruses. Indeed, several of Cupid's
arrows last year were found to have con-

tained traces of Mono. The Cupid in
question could not be reached for
comment.
Others argue that true love does
not result from a single alcohol-aided
kiss between people who barely
know each other. Just as a flower
cannot bloom in a single day, they
say, so too can love not bloom with
one kiss.

But how can these metaphor-ists
make this claim in light of over
whelming evidence to the contrary?
One need not look any further for
this evidence than the epitome of
mankind's quest for love: dating
game shows. Last I checked. VHI
had no TV programs called Rock of
Abstinence, Flavor of Acquaintance
or I Enjoy Conversing With New
York. When these programs start air
ing, the critics have my permission to
come back and criticize their collec
tive heads off. Until then, their pas
sionate but misguided concerns can
not. and will not, take away from the

passion of tonight.
Put simply, if the flower has not
yet bloomed, don't wait for Father
Time to run his course; just peel open
the lips of the flower petals yourself.
And then plant a big fat kiss on them.
Finally, there are those that main
tain that a night of drunken revelry
in which people have contests to see
how many kisses they can have in
one night, only to find themselves
puking in the bushes within hours,
and bed-ridden with various illnesses
within days, is the complete opposite
of finding one's soulmate. To which 1
say: name one difference.

By now. you likely think me a
romantic sap. But I assure you that
this evening, in following the great
precedent of Farm boys Wesley '83,
Harry Burns '89 and Aladdin '92. 1
will be falling in love on the Stanford
Quad when the clock strikes 12.
And then again when the clock
strikes 12:01.

Mark Donig would like to thank who
ever called him "flippant" last week.
He has no idea what that means, but he
is grateful for the compliment. Please
