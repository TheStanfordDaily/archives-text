## CARDINAL BEATS BRUINS After a tough loss in Pac-10 home opener, Stanford men beat UCLA 
### WILL DOOLEY 
Stanford men's soccer finally snapped its six-game winless
streak on Sunday afternoon with a hard-fought, 2-1 home victory
over UCLA.The game was the second match of the weekend for
the Cardinal, which opened home conference play on Friday with
a 1-0 loss to San Diego State.
Freshman midfielder Clayton Holz scored the game winner on
Sunday, volleying in a cross from senior Michael Alexander. The
goal was Holz's first in collegiate action and gave Stanford its first
win in nearly a month. During that stretch, the Cardinal (3-6-2,1 -
2-1 Pacific-10) lost five games and managed one tie.
Sunday was just the second time all season Stanford has man
aged to score two goals in a game, and it equaled the total goals
scored during the winless streak. During those six games, Stan
ford was outscored by its opponents 7-2.
The win could not come soon enough for a team that has been
on the receiving end of bad breaks all season. Coming off yet an
other loss decided by a last minute goal,"[t]hey were down" Stan
ford head coach Bret Simon told GoStanford.com in reference to
his team.
"But we have guys with very professional outlooks in how
they play and will work hard for each other," he added.
That professional outlook was exemplified by sophomore
Shaun Culver, who turned around his own personal run of bad
luck and the team's when he opened the scoring in the 20th
minute, giving Stanford its first lead in seven games.
Culver, who plays center back, started the first two games of
the season before being benched for nearly all of the last seven
contests — the result of an own goal in a 2-0 loss to SMU on Sept.
5. But according to Culver, his struggles "were more mental than
anything."
The Cardinal sophomore approached Simon prior to Sunday's
game and told him, "I'm tired of feeling sorry for myself: I'm
ready."
Culver demonstrated his readiness on a long throw in from
sophomore Ryan Thomas and finished the game with two shots.
UCLA (3-4-5.1-1-1) would not go quietly and soon came roaring
back with a strong individual effort by Prince Lapnet. After his
initial attempt was blocked, the Bruin forward hammered home

The Stanford men's soccer team went all black for Friday's game against San Diego State, a 1 -0 loss. The Cardinal bounced back with a 2-1 win over UCLA on Sunday,
and sophomore Ryan Thomas (99) assisted the team's first goal on a long throw-in during the second half. Next up is the Big Match agaist Cal, this Saturday at home.
his own rebound to tie the game in
the 29th minute.
Stanford has been especially
good versus UCLA of late. The Car
dinal is undefeated in the past five
meetings (2-0-3), despite trailing the
Bruins 34-4-7 in the series overall.
UCLA was coming off a 3-2 win on
Friday over No. 6 Cal — a good sign
for Stanford, as the Golden Bears
will be visiting Cagan Stadium next
Friday for the annual Big Match.
Whereas Sunday's win was a wel
come departure from Stanford's re
cent scoring drought, Friday's loss to
San Diego State (3-5-1,1-0-1) char
acterized everything that has gone
wrong for the Cardinal this season.
The Aztecs' Raymundo Reza
scored off the post in the 83rd
minute to hand Stanford it's fifth
one-goal loss of the season, all of
which were decided in the second
half — with most of the decisive
goals scored in the final 10 minutes.

"[W]e have guys with very
professional outlooks in
how they play and will
work hard for each other."
— BRET SIMON,
men's soccer head coach

Stanford got even less luck than
usual, twice having sure goals de
nied by Aztec defenders at the goal
line. In the first half, sophomore
Bobby Warshaw sprang senior Tom
Montgomery with a fine pass to put
him all alone on goal. San Diego's
keeper Brad Byrns deflected the
shot, but Montgomery quickly rec
ollected and had a go at an empty
net. In an impressive display of ath
leticism, 6-foot-5 defender Nick
Cardenas leapt while running back
wards at full speed, heading the ball
away just a few feet from the goal. In
the second half, it was redshirt sen
ior Ryan Imamura who had his
header off a corner kick blocked by
a defender, despite having cleanly
beaten the keeper.
With the final minutes ticking
away, Warshaw launched a spectac
ular bicycle kick into the back of the
net only to have the goal nullified by
an off sides call. It was representa
tive of the frustration that has been
building all season.
The team hardly seems surprised
anymore, and the coaching staff has
stopped trying to tell the team how
unlucky they've been.
"I didn't tell them anything but
what time practice is tomorrow"
Simon told GoStanford.com. "They
tried hard and had their chances.
There isn't much to say."
Stanford hopes to have something
to say this Friday against arch-nemesis
Cal. The team looks to keep its mo
mentum from Sunday and keep their
dreams of a conference title alive with
a decisive victory at home.
