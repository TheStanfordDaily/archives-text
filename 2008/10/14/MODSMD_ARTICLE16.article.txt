## CARDINAL BEATS BRUINS After a tough loss in Pac-10 home opener, Stanford men beat UCLA 
### WILL DOOLEY 
Stanford men's soccer finally snapped its six-game winless
streak on Sunday afternoon with a hard-fought, 2-1 home victory
over UCLA.The game was the second match of the weekend for
the Cardinal, which opened home conference play on Friday with
a 1-0 loss to San Diego State.
Freshman midfielder Clayton Holz scored the game winner on
Sunday, volleying in a cross from senior Michael Alexander. The
goal was Holz's first in collegiate action and gave Stanford its first
win in nearly a month. During that stretch, the Cardinal (3-6-2,1 -
2-1 Pacific-10) lost five games and managed one tie.
Sunday was just the second time all season Stanford has man
aged to score two goals in a game, and it equaled the total goals
scored during the winless streak. During those six games, Stan
ford was outscored by its opponents 7-2.
The win could not come soon enough for a team that has been
on the receiving end of bad breaks all season. Coming off yet an
other loss decided by a last minute goal,"[t]hey were down" Stan
ford head coach Bret Simon told GoStanford.com in reference to
his team.
"But we have guys with very professional outlooks in how
they play and will work hard for each other," he added.
That professional outlook was exemplified by sophomore
Shaun Culver, who turned around his own personal run of bad
luck and the team's when he opened the scoring in the 20th
minute, giving Stanford its first lead in seven games.
Culver, who plays center back, started the first two games of
the season before being benched for nearly all of the last seven
contests â€” the result of an own goal in a 2-0 loss to SMU on Sept.
5. But according to Culver, his struggles "were more mental than
anything."
The Cardinal sophomore approached Simon prior to Sunday's
game and told him, "I'm tired of feeling sorry for myself: I'm
ready."
Culver demonstrated his readiness on a long throw in from
sophomore Ryan Thomas and finished the game with two shots.
UCLA (3-4-5.1-1-1) would not go quietly and soon came roaring
back with a strong individual effort by Prince Lapnet. After his
initial attempt was blocked, the Bruin forward hammered home
