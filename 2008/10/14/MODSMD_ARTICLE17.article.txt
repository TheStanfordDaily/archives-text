# Hey, Stanford football fans, fill the stands
## 
### 
It was the Cardinal's most exciting
and most important win of the
year, and only a few were at Stan
ford Stadium to witness it.
Much has been made of the lag
ging attendance for home games.The
diehards will always show, and the
students will (for the most part) fill
up the Red Zone. But after numer
ous seasons of mediocre to just plain
bad football, the casual fan has been
scared away. Stanford doesn't draw
from a big enough community to rely
on hardcore devotees alone, so atten
dance has suffered. Coach Jim Har
baugh has started to turn the pro
gram around, but winning back fans
is an arduous process.
Despite how true this might be, in
the context of Saturday's contest, it is
irrelevant. The game was played on
Reunion Homecoming weekend,
when 10,000 alumni and their fami
lies flocked to the Farm to partake in
the reunion festivities. One of the
highlights of this yearly gathering (or
at least it should be a highlight) is the
football game — a fair percentage of
the returning alumni would be ex
pected to attend. As a result, for this
one weekend a year, Stanford Stadi
um should be close to full.

But it wasn't.
The announced attendance for
Saturday's contest was 30,689. The
stadium's capacity is 50,000, and
that's not including the seven luxury
suites or the 400 seats on the Direc
tor's Level.
Consider this: Stanford's late-Au
gust match up with Oregon State, a
month before most students arrived
on campus, drew practically the same
crowd.
If there are more Cardinal fans on
campus, and if Stanford is playing a
competitive Pac-10 opponent in
what was expected to be an exciting
game, then why was the football at
tendance practically the same as
usual?
I don't blame the fans. I blame the
reunion planners.
At practically any other school in
the country, the homecoming foot
ball game is the event of the week
end.There may be other things going
on throughout the day, but once
game time comes around, that's it.
Everyone goes to the stadium.
I went to Penn's homecoming a
few years ago. At an Ivy League, aca
demically fantastic school, there was.
nevertheless, a mass exodus of peo

pie from the classrooms and confer
ence halls as game time drew closer
— thev were all heading to Franklin
Field.
But on the Farm, the events kept
on going throughout the game.
"Hie game started at 2 p.m. Most
games go for about three hours, so
lets look at all the different happen
ings around campus that started any
where from 2-5 p.m.
There was a film festival, a set of
talks called "Classes Without
Quizzes," the opening of the new
Black Community Services Center, a
series of seven short lectures on the
"future of human health." open
houses and a number of mini class re
unions.
With so much available. I guess
it's easy to see where football could
become an afterthought. Can you
blame an alumnus for capitalizing on
the opportunity to hear a talk by
someone like Jack Rakove.a Pulitzer
Prize-winning history professor? I
can't, certainly not at Stanford, a
school that stresses academics above
all else.

Between the lines
But homecoming is four days
long, with events starting as early as
7:30 a.m. and going until as late as 2
a.m. There was a lot to fit into that
timeframe, and a number of differ
ent schedules — those of alumni, fa
cilities, professors, etc. — must be
taken into account when coordinat
ing an event of such magnitude.
But would it have been so diffi
cult for organizers to set aside three
hours on Saturday to allow every
one to go to Stanford Stadium and
cheer on the resurgent Cardinal
football team? To block out part of
the afternoon on Saturday's sched
ule and say, "This is where we come
together as a community to cheer on
our boys"?
It shouldn't be. and future home
comings should take greater care
not to overlap with what should be
the main event, especially as the
Cardinal continues to improve.
Harbaugh wasn't pleased with
the half-empty stadium, and I don't
blame him.
"How could you not want to
come watch this team, how could
these seats not be filled?," he asked.
"Especially on homecoming week
end — this is an exciting team that
has a lot of fight. If you care about
Stanford, you should come support
these guys, and if you like football,
too, because they put on a good
show."
Amen, coach.
