Gerhart honored as Pac-10 Offensive Player of the Week
Junior running back Toby Gerhart was a big part of
the Cardinal's 24-23 homecoming win over Arizona on
Saturday, rushing for 116 yards on 24 carries and scoring
the game-winning touchdown with 25 seconds remaining
in regulation. On Monday, the conference rewarded Ger
hart for his efforts by naming him the US. Bank Pacific
-10 Conference Offensive Player of the Week.
Gerhart is the second Cardinal player to earn Player
of the Week honors this season, following senior corner
back Wopamo Osaisai's selection after his opening-week
performance against Oregon State.
Stanford's rushing attack was its most potent weapon
against the Wildcats, as the Cardinal gained 286 yards on
48 attempts, good for an impressive six yards-per-carry
average. Gerhart was supplemented by senior Anthony
Kimble, who compiled 1 lOyards on just 11 attempts.The
duo ran over, through and past the Arizona defense to
propel Stanford to perhaps its biggest win of the season.
The success Gerhart experienced Saturday was part of
a season-long trend for the third-year Cardinal player,
who splits his time between Stanford's football and base
ball teams. Gerhart has been a workhorse for coach Jim
Harbaugh's team in 2008, gaining 641 yards and scoring
seven touchdowns on 1 11 attempts on the year. Perhaps
the junior's most impressive stat, though, is t hat in 229 ca
reer carries for the Cardinal, Gerhart has yet to fumble
the ball even once. It's that kind of reliability and produc
tion that has made him Stanford's go-to guv

Saturday was Gerhart's fourth 1 (K)-yard rushing game
of the season, the most by any Cardinal back since Brian
Allen in 2(M)1. Gerhart needs just 359 more yards in Stan
ford's remaining five games to become the Cardinal's
first 1 ,()(X)-yard rusher in a single season since "Touch
down" Tommy Vardell rushed for a school single-season
record of 1,084 in 1991.

(MPSF) Mikasa Co-Player of the Week honors yester
day, thanks to his tremendous performance at the SoCal
Tournament over the weekend.The No. 3 Cardinal squad
earned a second-place finish behind No. 1 UCLA.

tremendous defense as well to help Stanford to a 7-4 vic
tory over No. 2 UCLA in Los Angeles. Hindle-Katel was

nals, scoring a pair of goals in each of the squad's opening
two matchups against Princeton and Loyola Marymount.

the season, averaging a goal per game, while also playing
