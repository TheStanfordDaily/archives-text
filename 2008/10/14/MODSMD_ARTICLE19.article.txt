## Water polo stomps No. 2 UCLA, loses to No. 1 USC 
### CLAUDIA PRECIADO KENAN JIANG 
The No. 3 Stanford men's water
polo team went into the SoCal Tour
nament this weekend with high con
fidence after trouncing No. 11 Pacific
by a score of 10-2.The Tigers buckled
under the pressure of the Cardinal
defense, and the Stanford men were
looking to continue their early-sea
son hot streak.
The annual SoCal Tournament in
cludes No. 1 USC and No. 2 UCLA,
two of the main contenders for an
NCAA title this December.
At the Raleigh Runnels Aquatic
Center at Pepperdine University, the
Cardinal quickly dispatched its first
opponent. No. 15 Princeton, with a
solid 12-4 victory. In the afternoon.

Stanford beat No. 6 Loyola Mary
mount 10-8, which guaranteed it a
place against UCLA in the semifi
nals.
Senior captain Will Hindle-Katel
had two goals in each victory, and
junior Janson Wigo had four goals
against Princeton to lead the Cardi
nal through the first two contests. Se
nior Andrew Drake, sophomore
Ryan Kent, junior Rvan McCarthy,
sophomore Alex Pulido, junior Drac
Wigo and junior Sage Wright all
scored twice in the preliminary
round.
Junior captain goalkeeper Jimmie
Sandman defended the net against
Loyola Marymount but was given a
game off against Princeton. Sopho
more Brian Pingree was in goal
against Princeton and. though they
put up a tough fight, the Tigers were
no match for Pingree and Stanford's
dominating defense.
"The ultimate goal of the season
is to win an NCAA championship,
but it must be dealt with dav bv day.

game by game," freshman Porter
Kalbus said."[W]e first need to qual
ify for [the NCAA Tournament). To
do so, we need to have either the at
large bid or win the [Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation]. From now to
the end of season, this means win
ning every game."
"The SoCal Tournament affects
the rest of our year because it allows
us to go head to head with our Pac-10
competition," he continued. "It also
plays a role in our overall ranking be
cause we have quite a few big match
es during the SoCal Tournament."
Stanford took on Loyola Mary
mount later on Saturday. Though it
got out to a 7-5 lead in the third quar
ter, Stanford was not able to put
away the Lions, and with the clock
ticking down, there was no room for
mistakes. The Cardinal was able to
avoid mental lapses in the final quar
ter. and behind another strong de
fensive effort, held Loyola scoreless
in the fourth period as Stanford held
on for a 10-8 victory.
The next day. Stanford proved
that it belongs among the nation's
best by beating UCLA. The Cardi
nal's suffocating defense led to a 7-4
victory and created numerous scor
ing opportunities on counter-attacks.
Stanford built a 5-0 lead by the mid
dle of the third period.The Bruins fi

nally got a goal at 4:12 in the third pe
riod and tried to rally, but Janson
Wigo and freshmen Peter Sefton and
Jacob Smith answered back in the
fourth quarter. UCLA could not
overcome the Cardinal's lead â€”
thanks in part to Jimmie Sandman's
12 saves.
Stanford faced No. 1 USC in the
finals, the same Trojan team that
gave the Cardinal its only loss on the
season with a 10-3 beating at the
NorCal Tournament on Sept. 21.
The Card built up a 3-2 lead after
one period of play. However, USC
tied the game at 5-5 in the third peri

od and took the lead with J.W.
Krumpholz' goal at 1:24. Another
USC goal made the game 7-5 with
five minutes to play in regulation.
Stanford was down but not out.
Sophomore driver Cody Wiesen
quickly responded and cut the deficit
to one goal. Then a Trojan defender
was ejected for a foul in the final sec
onds of the match, giving the Cardi
nal a six-to-five advantage. The
power play was fruitful: Sophomore
Jeffrey Schwimer, whose late-game
heroics have been well documented
this season, grabbed a rebound off a
blocked shot and put the ball past the

USC goalkeeper to send the game to
overtime.
In bonus play, USC scored the
only goal with 1:45 left on the score
board. Wright and Hindle-Katel
both attempted shots, but the USC
goalkeeper stood firm in their way.
Wiesen notched two goals on the
game, with the other scores coming
from Pulido. Schwimer, Sefton,
Smith and Janson Wigo.
"This weekend was a great week
end for us." Wright said. "We had a
rough start at the beginning, not
coming out strong right away
against Princeton. But on Sunday

we won a crucial game [against
UCLA] and took USC to overtime,
which is an incredible improvement
from the last time we played them.
Plus, our freshmen and sophomores
were the stars this weekend, getting
some crucial goals against very
good teams."
Stanford will play UCLA next
Saturday at an MPSF contest, and
then UC-Santa Cruz the following
day to wrap up the weekend.
