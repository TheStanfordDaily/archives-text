With the school year well underway, students are
beginning to notice that dirty laundry is piling up as
their supply of free detergent dwindles.
Thanks to Student Housing's "Just Like Home"
laundry program — a program that is just one of
many new and continuing projects tailored for sus
tainability on campus — students were welcomed to
the Farm with a month's worth of environmentally
friendly detergent. Housing, in conjunction with var
ious student groups, has endeavored to reduce ener
gy consumption, save water and eliminate waste.
For Housing, what began as an attempt to combat
the soaring energy costs of the '90s evolved into an
environmentally conscious mission.
Alicia Restrepo. assistant director of Housing for
Planned and Sustainability Projects, stressed the
importance of the latest sustainability programs in
an email to The Daily.
"Over time, we found that energy wasn't the only
area where we could make a difference, and we
focused on a variety of initiatives that are now con
sidered 'sustainable,'" Restrepo said. "We also real
ized that with 1 I.(XX) students in residence, we had
the best opportunity to affect how students live, and
that in turn, they could help us improve our "sustain
able ways' to contain or reduce our energy and
water consumption."
ITiis.in part, necessitates a change in old habits, so
Housing posted sustainable living tips in student
rooms to encourage greener behavior when it comes
to energy, water and waste. All undergraduate hous
ing residents will also receive free, compact fluores
cent lamps (CFLs) and in-room recycling bins.
Housing is also continuing the installation of ultra
low-flow toilets and sink aerators in residences.
