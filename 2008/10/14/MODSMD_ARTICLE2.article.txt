## Housing tries new green initiatives Sustainable programs, features vary from CFLs to solar water heating 
### AN LE NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With the school year well underway, students are
beginning to notice that dirty laundry is piling up as
their supply of free detergent dwindles.
Thanks to Student Housing's "Just Like Home"
laundry program — a program that is just one of
many new and continuing projects tailored for sus
tainability on campus — students were welcomed to
the Farm with a month's worth of environmentally
friendly detergent. Housing, in conjunction with var
ious student groups, has endeavored to reduce ener
gy consumption, save water and eliminate waste.
For Housing, what began as an attempt to combat
the soaring energy costs of the '90s evolved into an
environmentally conscious mission.
Alicia Restrepo. assistant director of Housing for
Planned and Sustainability Projects, stressed the
importance of the latest sustainability programs in
an email to The Daily.
"Over time, we found that energy wasn't the only
area where we could make a difference, and we
focused on a variety of initiatives that are now con
sidered 'sustainable,'" Restrepo said. "We also real
ized that with 1 I.(XX) students in residence, we had
the best opportunity to affect how students live, and
that in turn, they could help us improve our "sustain
able ways' to contain or reduce our energy and
water consumption."
ITiis.in part, necessitates a change in old habits, so
Housing posted sustainable living tips in student
rooms to encourage greener behavior when it comes
to energy, water and waste. All undergraduate hous
ing residents will also receive free, compact fluores
cent lamps (CFLs) and in-room recycling bins.
Housing is also continuing the installation of ultra
low-flow toilets and sink aerators in residences.
In addition. Housing recently installed a
solar water heating system on the roof of
Robinson 1 louse. The new heating system is
expected to provide 50 percent of the
house's hot water.
"The more we began implementing
changes and talking to students about things
we wanted to do. the more students came to
us to offer ideas and explore opportunities,"
Restrepo said.
In fact, many successes have come from
collaboration between Housing and the
Stanford Green Campus Program (SGCP).
which adheres to efficiency and conserva
tion goals.
"There are four interns in the Green
Campus Program and each of them is lead
ing a relatively small pilot project"
explained Noel Crisostomo '10. public rela
tions officer for SGCP.
Branner I lall is home to one of the most
prominent initiatives — freshmen have
been provided with 185 "Smart Strips" to
minimize electricity waste. Ihese so-called
"intelligent power strips" turn off peripheral
devices when students' computers go to
sleep and when televisions are not in use. A

successful pilot in Chi Theta Chi, which
reduced consumption by 15 percent in May
2008, led Housing to continue the distribu
tion of smart strips.
"Housing decided to expand it to
Branner in the hopes of building a better
business case to delivering smart strips to all
freshmen in the next year or so," Crisostomo
said.
Crisostomo's personal project. The Big
Save, aims to reduce electricity consumption
via an intercollegiate competition between
Stanford and UC-Berkeley. The university
that decreases per-capita energy consump
tion by the greatest percentage, relative to a
2003 baseline, will be deemed the winner.

The competition runs for two months, from
October to November, ending with Big
Game on Nov. 22.
"I think it's important for students to
know that their consumption has an envi
ronmental impact and that, while in the past
conservation measures have been deemed
as uncomfortable or inconvenient, efficiency
and sustainability can be achieved easily and
actually add up for a measurable impact,"
Crisostomo said.
Another SGCP initiative involves the
installation of an energy-monitoring dash
board in Storey House. Ihe dashboard will
provide residents with an online measure of
current and aggregate energy consumption
to encourage students to conserve energy.
In general, adopting a sustainable living
mindset has brought many gains to Housing
and the student body — both environmen
tal and economic.
"It helps us keep the cost of managing
the buildings in check," Restrepo said.
"Without all of the improvements and ini
tiatives. utility costs would be considerably
much more and all of this would affect stu
dent rates. So in the end. it's a circle that
benefits the students as well as contributes
to a greener, more sustainable environ
ment."
