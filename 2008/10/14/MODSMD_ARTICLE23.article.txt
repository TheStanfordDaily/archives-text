## LSU's tournament champ beats Stanford ace 
### JOSHUA ALVAREZ 
Stanford sophomore Alex Clay
ton, currently ranked fourth in the
nation, was defeated by No. 20
Michael Venus of LSU in the Round
of 16 at the Intercollegiate Tennis As
sociation All-American Champi
onships in Tulsa, Okla. Venus went on
to win the championship against
Oleksandr Nedovyesov (Oklahoma
State), the nation's top-ranked player
and defending champion of last
year's All-American Championships.
The ITA reported that the most "im
pressive" part of Venus' startling run
to the throne was defeating Clayton
in a 6-7 (3), 7-6 (5). 6-4 "marathon
match."
"He played a difficult match."
Stanford head coach John Whitlinger
said. "Michael [Venus] didn't really
let Alex into the match ... [Clayton]
had just come off two very demand
ing matches."
Clayton, a 2007-08 All-American.
had to earn his Round of 16 spot,
eventually prevailing in a three-hour
match against Jonas Berg from Uni
versity of Mississippi.
"Alex is as good as anybody else in
the country" Whitlinger said. "He
just happens to lose in tournaments
to the guys that end up winning the
whole thing."
"Even before he came to Stanford
he had a knack of doing that," he
chuckled.
Later in the tournament, Berg
went on to win the doubles champi
onship for Mississippi with his part
ner Bram ten Berge.
"The quality of play [in the All-
American Championships] was ex
cellent," Whitlinger said. "Alex is not
losing to losers or mediocre players.
Every time you lose,you learn from it
and move on — one loss is not going
to make or break his season."
Clayton is Stanford's highest
ranked player and the coaching staff
is counting on him to lead the team
this season. And they aren't worried
about putting too much pressure on
him.
"The team expects big things from
Alex — Alex expects big things from
Alex," Whitlinger said. "He's got a
bulls eye on his back, and he knows it.
Guys around the country are gunning
for him. and every game he plays he's
got a guy on the other side of the

court who is going to give his all. Alex
knows this and is ready to take it on."
Junior Richard Wire (No. 66) and
freshman Bradley Klahn also had
strong showings in the All-American
tournament, winning three matches
to make it to the qualifying round.
Wire came back from a disappointing
first-round loss to win his consolation
match. Klahn lost in the second
round.

"He's got a bulls
eye on his back,
and he knows it."

men's tennis head coach

The Cardinal is already looking
ahead to the ITA Northern Cal Re
gional Championships, this Friday
through Tuesday. The winner of the
event will earn a spot in the Individ
ual Indoor Championships. Stanford
has done well at the Berkeley tourna
ment in recent years — Wire is the
defending champion.
"We expect our entire team to
participate in [the ITA Northern Cal
Regional Championships] unless
there are any prevailing injuries that
still need to be rested," Whitlinger
said.
Stanford ended last season ranked
No. 22 and is looking to improve with
a cast of ranked players including
Clayton (No. 4), senior Matt Bruch

Bruch and senior Blake Muller, is
