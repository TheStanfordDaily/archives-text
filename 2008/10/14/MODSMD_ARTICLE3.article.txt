## Wachovia limits access to fund for schools Stanford did not invest in Wachovia's money-market fund 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
In a display of the credit crisis' impact on
American higher education, Wachovia Bank
recently limited the access of 1 .(XX) colleges around
the country to roughly $9.3 billion in the
Common Fund.
A money-market fund used by many colleges
that invests depositors' funds in short-term instru
ments with maturities anywhere from one day to 90
days or sometimes longer, the Common Fund does
not have Stanford University as an investor.
In an email to The Daily, Stanford Chief
Financial Officer Randy Livingston said the
Common Fund and other similar funds generally
tried to keep enough funds in the one-day
overnight maturities to ensure liquidity.
"If they have redemptions, they need enough
liquid funds to support those redemptions," said
Livingston, who also serves as vice president of
Business Affairs. "At the same time, interest-rate
yields on longer maturity instruments are usually
higher. In order to provide a competitive yield, a
money-market fund needs to invest most of its
funds in 60- to 90-day maturities."
Thus, money-market funds must always attempt
to strike a balance between overnight liquid securi
ties to ensure the ability to provide for redemptions
by institutions seeking to withdraw cash from the
fund, as well as longer-term, higher-yielding securi-
ties to attract the fund managers in
the first place.
If there is an unusually large
amount of college fund managers
seeking redemption of their invest
ments, the fund may find itself lack
ing the requisite liquidity to provide
for these redemptions.
•'My understanding of the
Wachovia-CommonFund situation is
that Wachovia feared a run on the
fund and preemptively declared that
they would limit the amount that any
one investor could withdraw,"

Livingston said. "At this point, it does
not appear that the fund investors
have actually lost money. However,
they may not have access to the liq
uid funds they expected."
Concerns about the ability to
retrieve cash from the
Common Fund have led growing
budgeting concerns at universities
across the country.
While Stanford was not an
investor in the Wachovia-
Common Fund money-market fund,
the University does invest the cash in
other money market funds.
"To date, the money market funds
we invest in have not had any diffi
culty meeting redemption requests."
Livingston said. "To avoid situations
similar to Wachovia-CommonFund.

most money-market funds are
increasing their holdings of overnight
securities, and decreasing their hold
ings of 60- to 90-day securities."
The majority of Stanford's cash is
invested in a 2A-7 fund. Livingston
said 2A-7 funds are managed to pri
oritize liquidity and safety of the
principals such as Stanford
University. Rules governing 2A-7
funds limit the duration and credit
risks allowed.
"In addition, the U.S. government
is insuring participating 2A-7 funds
against loss from Sept. 19 through
Dec. 18 (three months)," he said.
"Our balances as of Sept. 19 are fully
protected as our money-market fund
is participating in the insurance pro
gram."

Livingston said Stanford has not
made any budget decisions yet in
response to the recent drop in finan
cial markets. However, as the
University's fiscal year 2009-10 budg
et is developed over the next several
months, it is very likely that depart
ments across the University will be
asked to propose ways to reduce
their expenditures.
"We are likely facing a difficult
economic period." he said. "At the
same time. Stanford enters this diffi
cult period in a stronger financial
position than many other higher
education institutions, and I am con
fident we will weather the storm."
