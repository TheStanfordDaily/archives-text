# University preps for Full Moon
## Officials take steps to ensure student safety, prevent intoxication at Stanford ritual 
### JAMES HOHMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Tongue wrestling. Tonsil hockey. Making
out.
Whatever you want to call it, between
2,500 and 3,500 students are expected to puck
er up when the clock strikes midnight tonight.
And Stanford officials say they're ready to
keep the organized mayhem that is Full Moon
on the Quad both safe and fun.
To do that, they aim to make the osculating
festivities as dry as possible. In the past, liquor
and the event have gone together like the
birds and the bees. But "pre-gaming"— or
consuming alcohol before arriving — causes
problems with the kiss fest, in the view of a
University nervous about liability.
So this year, administrators are making a
concerted effort to discourage drinking in
advance and working with dorm staffs to
inform freshman that they should resist pres
sures to imbibe. And those who appear "obvi
ously intoxicated" will not be allowed inside
either, organizers say.
"This is one of the higher risk nights in the
quarter for alcohol problems," said Ralph
Castro, who as manager of the Substance
Abuse Prevention Program is the University's
point man on alcohol abuse.
A heavy police presence is expected, with
the goal to deter and counter any problems.
Guards will check that everyone entering the
Quad is a student.
Stanford Department of Public Safety
Spokesman Bill Larson said an unspecified
number of deputies and security personnel
will be assigned to work the event. Last year,
he said, there was one arrest for a student
drunk in public and one citation issued for
possession of marijuana (less than an ounce).
Castro said there were multiple alcohol
related incidents that required attention. He
said he couldn't recall the exact number, but
that several students were unable to make it

FIVE THINGS TO WATCH FOR AT
FULL MOON ON THE QUAD THIS YEAR:
| Will dorm staff efforts to discourage pre
gaming and police efforts to prevent the
smuggling in of alcohol work to make the
event less inebriated?
| Will the timing - it's on a Tuesday, instead of
a weekend -dampen turnout and play a
role in decreasing alcohol consumption?
H How widespread will this year's outbreak of
mono and strep throat be? Every year, ill
nesses go around with the swapping of spit.
Some years, it's worse than others.
| Despite being told not to by coaches fearful
that their players will get sick, how many
varsity athletes will show up anyway?
[Maybe just to 'observe'?]
| How many students will come naked? It
varies year by year, and the temperature
can make a difference. The forecast for
Tuesday night is for low clouds and fog,
with lows in the upper 40s and winds
between 5 and 15 miles per hour.

Two students share an embrace, moments after a similar interaction with the Tree. Students will celebrate the annual Full Moon
on the Quad tonight, but not without the presecence of police and safety measures.
from their dorm to the Quad
because they were so drunk and oth
ers couldn't stay on their feet once
they arrived.
This may just be the wackiest
and most bizarre proceedings on a
campus chock full of oddball tradi
tions. CosmoGIRL! Magazine has
called the event Stanford's "Claim
to fame."
It started as a more innocent
activity. Freshman boys and girls
gathered in the Main Quad during
the first full moon of the school year,
and they "officially" became
Stanford students only after getting
kissed by a senior of the opposite sex.
The tradition turned raunchier
over the years, as hook-ups and
nudity became more prevalent
amidst the free-love revelry. It
became so rowdy that the
University began offering mouth
wash and condoms.
Since 2(X)4, the University has
tried to tame the event, aggressively
policing entrances to the Quad to
prevent the smuggling in of alcohol
and threatening students who mis
behave.
The move was provoked by trou
ble during the 2003 festivities, when
four students were hospitalized for
alcohol-related injuries and another
participant was arrested for drunk
driving.
At the time, Director of Student
Activities Nanci Howe said she had
"serious reservations about this
event happening again." But. under
pressure from student groups and
facing the specter of a completely
unsanctioned, underground Full
Moon happening anyway, the
University relented.
The crackdown, which includes a
ban on photography, prompts com
plaints that the tradition has been
sanitized.
Patrick Fortune '09, the Stanford
Tree and band mascot, said that the
event has been "cheapened" as

bureaucrats imposed order on what
had been more chaotic, sponta
neous, unpredictable, and — well —
fun.
When the San Jose Mercury
News covered last year's Full Moon,
infamous Stanford beat reporter
Lisa M. Krieger led her story with
the fact that students wore name
tags to make the point that the
event isn't quite as tawdry as in past
years.
"Anyone hoping for a
Bacchanalian orgy of strangers left
disappointed," she wrote.
Peter Davis '11, co-president of
the sophomore class, which has
been organizing the event with the
University, said there is a balance
between fun and safety.
"For us, it's about preserving the
tradition and making sure everyone
has a good time and stays safe," he
said.
This year, the event officially
opens at 9:30 p.m. and runs until 1
a.m., organizers say. Entertainment,
including seven bands and one
dance group, is scheduled to begin
at 10 p.m. "I hope that limits
some of the intense partying by
bringing people earlier," Davis said.
Dance groups are scheduled to
perform from 10 to 10:30 p.m.
Castro said his main worry is
hard liquor.
"People taking shots are just put
ting themselves in an at-risk posi
tion for getting sick later on," he
said.
The main worry for Fortune is
the decision of whether to use citrus
mint-flavored mouth wash or some
thing else.
This will be Fortune's fourth Full
Moon on the Quad. He can't
remember how many people he
kissed his freshman year, but "it was
definitely in the double digits." One
sub-tradition of Full Moon is to kiss
the Tree, so he's guaranteed hun
dreds of kisses — if he wants them.
"I'm going to be carrying my bot
tle of Listerine or Scope by my side
the whole time," he said.

Tongue wrestling. Tonsil hockey. Making
out.
Whatever you want to call it, between
2,500 and 3,500 students are expected to puck
er up when the clock strikes midnight tonight.
And Stanford officials say they're ready to
keep the organized mayhem that is Full Moon
on the Quad both safe and fun.
To do that, they aim to make the osculating
festivities as dry as possible. In the past, liquor
and the event have gone together like the
birds and the bees. But "pre-gaming"— or
consuming alcohol before arriving — causes
problems with the kiss fest, in the view of a
University nervous about liability.
So this year, administrators are making a
concerted effort to discourage drinking in
advance and working with dorm staffs to
inform freshman that they should resist pres
sures to imbibe. And those who appear "obvi
ously intoxicated" will not be allowed inside
either, organizers say.
"This is one of the higher risk nights in the
quarter for alcohol problems," said Ralph
Castro, who as manager of the Substance
Abuse Prevention Program is the University's
point man on alcohol abuse.
A heavy police presence is expected, with
the goal to deter and counter any problems.
Guards will check that everyone entering the
Quad is a student.
Stanford Department of Public Safety
Spokesman Bill Larson said an unspecified
number of deputies and security personnel
will be assigned to work the event. Last year,
he said, there was one arrest for a student
drunk in public and one citation issued for
possession of marijuana (less than an ounce).
Castro said there were multiple alcohol
related incidents that required attention. He
said he couldn't recall the exact number, but
that several students were unable to make it

FIVE THINGS TO WATCH FOR AT
FULL MOON ON THE QUAD THIS YEAR:
| Will dorm staff efforts to discourage pre
gaming and police efforts to prevent the
smuggling in of alcohol work to make the
event less inebriated?
| Will the timing - it's on a Tuesday, instead of
a weekend -dampen turnout and play a
role in decreasing alcohol consumption?
H How widespread will this year's outbreak of
mono and strep throat be? Every year, ill
nesses go around with the swapping of spit.
Some years, it's worse than others.
| Despite being told not to by coaches fearful
that their players will get sick, how many
varsity athletes will show up anyway?
[Maybe just to 'observe'?]
| How many students will come naked? It
varies year by year, and the temperature
can make a difference. The forecast for
Tuesday night is for low clouds and fog,
with lows in the upper 40s and winds
between 5 and 15 miles per hour.

Two students share an embrace, moments after a similar interaction with the Tree. Students will celebrate the annual Full Moon
on the Quad tonight, but not without the presecence of police and safety measures.
from their dorm to the Quad
because they were so drunk and oth
ers couldn't stay on their feet once
they arrived.
This may just be the wackiest
and most bizarre proceedings on a
campus chock full of oddball tradi
tions. CosmoGIRL! Magazine has
called the event Stanford's "Claim
to fame."
It started as a more innocent
activity. Freshman boys and girls
gathered in the Main Quad during
the first full moon of the school year,
and they "officially" became
Stanford students only after getting
kissed by a senior of the opposite sex.
The tradition turned raunchier
over the years, as hook-ups and
nudity became more prevalent
amidst the free-love revelry. It
became so rowdy that the
University began offering mouth
wash and condoms.
Since 2(X)4, the University has
tried to tame the event, aggressively
policing entrances to the Quad to
prevent the smuggling in of alcohol
and threatening students who mis
behave.
The move was provoked by trou
ble during the 2003 festivities, when
four students were hospitalized for
alcohol-related injuries and another
participant was arrested for drunk
driving.
At the time, Director of Student
Activities Nanci Howe said she had
"serious reservations about this
event happening again." But. under
pressure from student groups and
facing the specter of a completely
unsanctioned, underground Full
Moon happening anyway, the
University relented.
The crackdown, which includes a
ban on photography, prompts com
plaints that the tradition has been
sanitized.
Patrick Fortune '09, the Stanford
Tree and band mascot, said that the
event has been "cheapened" as

bureaucrats imposed order on what
had been more chaotic, sponta
neous, unpredictable, and — well —
fun.
When the San Jose Mercury
News covered last year's Full Moon,
infamous Stanford beat reporter
Lisa M. Krieger led her story with
the fact that students wore name
tags to make the point that the
event isn't quite as tawdry as in past
years.
"Anyone hoping for a
Bacchanalian orgy of strangers left
disappointed," she wrote.
Peter Davis '11, co-president of
the sophomore class, which has
been organizing the event with the
University, said there is a balance
between fun and safety.
"For us, it's about preserving the
tradition and making sure everyone
has a good time and stays safe," he
said.
This year, the event officially
opens at 9:30 p.m. and runs until 1
a.m., organizers say. Entertainment,
including seven bands and one
dance group, is scheduled to begin
at 10 p.m. "I hope that limits
