# University preps for Full Moon
## Officials take steps to ensure student safety, prevent intoxication at Stanford ritual 
### JAMES HOHMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Tongue wrestling. Tonsil hockey. Making
out.
Whatever you want to call it, between
2,500 and 3,500 students are expected to puck
er up when the clock strikes midnight tonight.
And Stanford officials say they're ready to
keep the organized mayhem that is Full Moon
on the Quad both safe and fun.
To do that, they aim to make the osculating
festivities as dry as possible. In the past, liquor
and the event have gone together like the
birds and the bees. But "pre-gaming"— or
consuming alcohol before arriving — causes
problems with the kiss fest, in the view of a
University nervous about liability.
So this year, administrators are making a
concerted effort to discourage drinking in
advance and working with dorm staffs to
inform freshman that they should resist pres
sures to imbibe. And those who appear "obvi
ously intoxicated" will not be allowed inside
either, organizers say.
"This is one of the higher risk nights in the
quarter for alcohol problems," said Ralph
Castro, who as manager of the Substance
Abuse Prevention Program is the University's
point man on alcohol abuse.
A heavy police presence is expected, with
the goal to deter and counter any problems.
Guards will check that everyone entering the
Quad is a student.
Stanford Department of Public Safety
Spokesman Bill Larson said an unspecified
number of deputies and security personnel
will be assigned to work the event. Last year,
he said, there was one arrest for a student
drunk in public and one citation issued for
possession of marijuana (less than an ounce).
Castro said there were multiple alcohol
related incidents that required attention. He
said he couldn't recall the exact number, but
that several students were unable to make it

FIVE THINGS TO WATCH FOR AT
FULL MOON ON THE QUAD THIS YEAR:
| Will dorm staff efforts to discourage pre
gaming and police efforts to prevent the
smuggling in of alcohol work to make the
event less inebriated?
| Will the timing - it's on a Tuesday, instead of
a weekend -dampen turnout and play a
role in decreasing alcohol consumption?
H How widespread will this year's outbreak of
mono and strep throat be? Every year, ill
nesses go around with the swapping of spit.
Some years, it's worse than others.
| Despite being told not to by coaches fearful
that their players will get sick, how many
varsity athletes will show up anyway?
[Maybe just to 'observe'?]
| How many students will come naked? It
varies year by year, and the temperature
can make a difference. The forecast for
Tuesday night is for low clouds and fog,
with lows in the upper 40s and winds
between 5 and 15 miles per hour.

Two students share an embrace, moments after a similar interaction with the Tree. Students will celebrate the annual Full Moon
on the Quad tonight, but not without the presecence of police and safety measures.
