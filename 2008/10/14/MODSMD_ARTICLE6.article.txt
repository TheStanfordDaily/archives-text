## Bike traffic still at issue in renovated White Plaza Bike-friendly design draws both praise and criticism 
### LIZ STARK 
The newly renovated White Plaza, fea
turing added event space and designated
biking lanes, has been met with mixed
reaction from Stanford students.
However, University officials are pleased
with the outcome of the $4 million project.
"It has been successful," said Cathy
Blake, assistant director of the University
Planning Office, of White Plaza's renova
tion. "All the changes came out of what

students wanted."
The design was the result of a four-year
process and was formulated in workshops
that included representatives from stu
dent organizations, adjacent buildings and
the ASSU. The taskforce also sought the
input of the general community by setting
up tables in White Plaza and asking
passersby what they did and did not like
about the space.
The addition of sidewalks and traffic
circles was intended to address student
concerns about bike safety in White Plaza.
"Bike traffic was one of the biggest
focus items at the workshops." said Greg
Boardman, vice provost for Student
Affairs and organizer of the workshops, in
an email to The Daily. "It was determined

we needed to channel bike traffic. All felt
the area was unsafe."
According to Blake, the original pro
posal was to make White Plaza a bike-free
zone.
Bill Larson, public information officer
for the Department of Public Safety, said
in an email that, since the renovation,
"there have been very few bicycle colli
sions in White Plaza reported to us."
Both Larson and Blake were unable to
comment on whether the number of acci
dents in White Plaza has increased or
decreased with the changes. As Blake said,
"it's too early to tell." Citations cannot be
issued to violators in White Plaza because
California law does not define it as a pub
licly maintained highway, according to

Larson.
Blake cited one accident this year in
which someone went around the round
about in the wrong direction at a time of
peak traffic, hut emphasized that these
roundabouts were a positive change from
what was formerly known as "the intersec
tion of death."
"The changes make it safer." said
Danny Neumann '09. "It may seem more
dangerous, because there is a greater pos
sibility of fender benders, but it decreases
the chance for full-speed collisions."
Still, many students disagree.
"There is too much clutter." said
Jeremy Keeshin '12. "It doesn't encourage
people to slow down."
Other students felt that the bike
lanes caused more trouble than the
unregulated travel space in the old
version of White Plaza.
"It's like taking a four-lane
highway, putting an ugly cement
bench in three of the lanes and
expecting two directions of traffic
to travel in that one lane," said Dan
Hurwit '10.
Samora Garling '12, who said he
narrowly avoided an accident at the
turn from Tressider into White
Plaza, added that the large number
of pedestrians traveling in bike lanes
increases the danger of the new
obstructions.
Blake added that the efforts to
slow down bikers would ideally
make White Plaza a friendlier place
for student gatherings and events.
"A lot of feedback in the work
shops said [bikers] go too fast and
groups don't feel comfortable stand
ing there," Blake said, adding, "and
people were uncomfortable watch
ing events."
Neumann echoed this sentiment.
"White Plaza is the closest thing
we have to a campus center," he
said. "The new additions slow it
down and allow for more interac
tions."
Indeed, White Plaza was mod
eled in part after the campus centers
of other universities.
"[White Plaza] now serves as a
destination, not only a thorough
fare," Boardman said.
Some argue that the elements
intended to encourage socialization
not only interfere with bike traffic
but also are unnecessary.
"There doesn't seem like there's

really rhyme or reason to [the
changes in] White Plaza," said
Lauren Meleney '10. "The design of
mulch and paved areas is bizarre,
and the stage is a skate park for local
kids."
For the first two weeks of classes.
Department of Public Safety offi
cers were assigned to White Plaza to

help students adjust to the changes.
Larson said officers will no longer
be assigned to the area, though they
"will continue to monitor the traffic
flow."
According to Boardman, the
final renovations will be completed
in the next few months, as addition
al lights, benches, trash containers

and bike racks are installed. A
canopy will also be added to the
stage area.
"It's not a finished product."
Blake noted. "It's a work in
progress."

Students bike through White Plaza during a busy school day. University officials said the plaza was designed to
improve the flow of bike traffic, but it has drawn both criticism and praise from students.
