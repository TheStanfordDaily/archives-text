## Palo Alto: Whose town is it ANYWAY? 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS

"Palo Alto has distinct demographics
to target" said local bookstore owner
Faith Bell. "The city has definitely
changed from when I grew up here."
Currently caught in a three-way tug
of war as the playground of venture cap
italists. the sleepy city of affluent locals
and the college town of 6,000 restless un
dergrade our neighbor to the north at
tempts to be a Renaissance town while
maintaining its suburban charm.
But Palo Alto fails in the college town
respect, students say.
"I wouldn't say that Palo Alto is a col
lege town as much as it's a CEO town."
said William Vijverberg '10. "Palo Alto
just doesn't have that homey feel of a col
lege town."
Yet despite this absence of collegiate
charm, students still take the Marguerite
or make the eight-minute bike ride
downtown to eat, drink and browse in
what a 2007 Coldwell Banker survey
named America's most expensive col
lege town.
Cafe Crowd and
Gastronomic Gang
Palo Alto boasts almost as many cafes
and restaurants as it does Oriental rug
shops. But choosing one among the bevy
of cafe-studded streets can be a daunting
task.
According to Ayeesha Lalji '11, am
biance is key.
"The Stanford Bubble can be claus
trophobic, so it's nice to get out and have
a complete change of scene," Lalji said." I
enjoy restaurants where you can feel
completely detached from campus. I re
ally like Kan Zeman, for instance, be
cause they have things like authentic
Turkish coffee and belly dancing to cre
ate a totally different scene."
Araceli Flores '11, however, has two
more specific criteria for cafe choice —
coffee and study environment. Coupa

joint, has both, she said.
"Coupa has amazing pastries and mo
chas, and I love to munch while I study.so
that's a plus," Flores commented. Plus,
she added, cafes in Palo Alto are nice in
that you can see a mix of community
members — soccer moms, entrepre
neurs and locals.
Vijverberg likes the Palo Alto cuisine
choices, but tries to limit his Palo Alto
grub-intake because prices are so exorbi
tant.
"Price targeting is way too high," he
said. "There's no way that a college stu
dent is going to blow $35 to $40 a meal.
Half of the restaurants are that expen
sive."
Vijverberg does admit, however, that
when parents come to town, Palo Alto's
culinary quality isn't one to be missed.
"When my parents come to Stanford,
I hit all the amazing Palo Alto restau
rants." he said. "Normally I can't afford
that."
The Townies' Take
A staple of any university town is the
old-fashioned local bookstore, but due to
skyrocketing rent prices, Bell's Books is
the last of the quintessentially collegiate
independent shops in Palo Alto.
Owner Faith Bell remembers a time
when the town had a community of
mom-and-pop bookstores, but notes that
with the introduction of bigger chains,
Palo Alto's independent integrity is be
coming a casualty to multi-branch cor
porations.
Luckily, the bookstore has survived
what Bell calls the "travesty of corporate
take-over."
Bell credits this survival solely to the
store's proximity to Stanford.
"The University is a huge part of our
world — Stanford shapes Palo Alto in
more ways than the townies are familiar
with." she said. "The kind of intellectual
life, the research that's beinc done, all


SARA PIASKOWY/The Stanford Daily
have a huge impact on our world. We
wouldn't exist in this form in a place that
was not a university town."
Gordon Biersch Manager Andrew
Armstrong said that while his sports bar
attracts students for Stanford football and
basketball games, the campus' insular
nature has kept its students from having
much of a presence.
"Due to the high level of academics, I
think you see a lot less student activity as
far as going out — it's so much an on-cam
pus sort of school," Armstrong explained.
"And as a whole, I'd say that Stanford stu
dents are more high-maintenance and
picky than most people in their age group.
Palo Alto reflects that."
Whose College Town?
Vijverberg blames Palo Alto's market
ing demographic as the prime feature that
bars it from being a "typical" college
town.
"It's true that Palo Alto is a byproduct
of Stanford, but it's not really directed
toward undergrads," he said, "the city is

directed more toward the business that
comes out of Stanford than to the current
students themselves. As a result, Palo Alto
is way too expensive to be a college town."
Daniel Philpot '09 thinks that Palo
Alto's lack of appeal to undergrads is more
a fact of being in a time warp.
"The city is not incorporated into the
campus very well," he says. "It's not so
much a place where college kids are going
to hang out and have fun. It's much more a
mid-20s or -30s town for richer business
people."
Coupa Cafe manager Jean Paul Coupal
'07, however, feels that his cafe is a good fit
with the Stanford cafe crowd.
"Palo Alto and Stanford complement
each other very nicely," he said. "The

Stanford community intertwines itself with
the town to create a really special relation
ship."
The Future of Palo Alto
One way or another, Palo Alto is inextri
cably linked to Stanford. But who will win
the town-and-gown tug of war?
Vijverberg believes the city is going to the
yuppies.
"Noah's Bagels was one of the few stu
dent-oriented places in Palo Alto" he
remembered. "But it shut down last year
and turned into a Tibetan goods store. Now
that's great for the Tibetans at Stanford, but
I feel like most students would prefer
cheap bagel sandwiches."
Flores, nonetheless, is optimistic about
the future of Palo Alto as a Mecca for
Stanford students.
"It seems like Stanford students are
invading Palo Alto and sort of actively
remaking it into a college town," she says.
"If the city sponsored more bars, a main
stream theater or more student-related
activities, there would be much more of a
connection between the University and
the town, which I think would be really
nice."

Vijverberg blames Palo Alto's market
ing demographic as the prime feature that
bars it from being a "typical" college
town.
"It's true that Palo Alto is a byproduct
of Stanford, but it's not really directed
toward undergrads," he said, "the city is

directed more toward the business that
comes out of Stanford than to the current
students themselves. As a result, Palo Alto
is way too expensive to be a college town."
Daniel Philpot '09 thinks that Palo
Alto's lack of appeal to undergrads is more
a fact of being in a time warp.
"The city is not incorporated into the
campus very well," he says. "It's not so
much a place where college kids are going
to hang out and have fun. It's much more a
mid-20s or -30s town for richer business
people."
Coupa Cafe manager Jean Paul Coupal
'07, however, feels that his cafe is a good fit
with the Stanford cafe crowd.
"Palo Alto and Stanford complement
each other very nicely," he said. "The

Stanford community intertwines itself with
the town to create a really special relation
ship."
The Future of Palo Alto
One way or another, Palo Alto is inextri
cably linked to Stanford. But who will win
the town-and-gown tug of war?
Vijverberg believes the city is going to the
yuppies.
"Noah's Bagels was one of the few stu
dent-oriented places in Palo Alto" he
remembered. "But it shut down last year
and turned into a Tibetan goods store. Now
that's great for the Tibetans at Stanford, but
I feel like most students would prefer
cheap bagel sandwiches."
Flores, nonetheless, is optimistic about
the future of Palo Alto as a Mecca for
Stanford students.
"It seems like Stanford students are
invading Palo Alto and sort of actively
remaking it into a college town," she says.
"If the city sponsored more bars, a main
stream theater or more student-related
activities, there would be much more of a
connection between the University and
the town, which I think would be really
nice."

"Palo Alto has distinct demographics
to target" said local bookstore owner
Faith Bell. "The city has definitely
changed from when I grew up here."
Currently caught in a three-way tug
of war as the playground of venture cap

and the college town of 6,000 restless un
dergrade our neighbor to the north at
tempts to be a Renaissance town while
maintaining its suburban charm.
But Palo Alto fails in the college town
respect, students say.
"I wouldn't say that Palo Alto is a col
lege town as much as it's a CEO town."
said William Vijverberg '10. "Palo Alto
just doesn't have that homey feel of a col
lege town."
Yet despite this absence of collegiate
charm, students still take the Marguerite
or make the eight-minute bike ride
downtown to eat, drink and browse in
what a 2007 Coldwell Banker survey
named America's most expensive col
lege town.
Cafe Crowd and
Gastronomic Gang
Palo Alto boasts almost as many cafes
and restaurants as it does Oriental rug
shops. But choosing one among the bevy
of cafe-studded streets can be a daunting
task.
According to Ayeesha Lalji '11, am
biance is key.
"The Stanford Bubble can be claus
trophobic, so it's nice to get out and have
a complete change of scene," Lalji said." I
enjoy restaurants where you can feel
completely detached from campus. I re
ally like Kan Zeman, for instance, be
cause they have things like authentic
Turkish coffee and belly dancing to cre
ate a totally different scene."
Araceli Flores '11, however, has two

"Coupa has amazing pastries and mo

that's a plus," Flores commented. Plus,
she added, cafes in Palo Alto are nice in

members — soccer moms, entrepre

Vijverberg likes the Palo Alto cuisine
choices, but tries to limit his Palo Alto
grub-intake because prices are so exorbi
tant.
"Price targeting is way too high," he
said. "There's no way that a college stu
dent is going to blow $35 to $40 a meal.
Half of the restaurants are that expen
sive."
Vijverberg does admit, however, that
when parents come to town, Palo Alto's
culinary quality isn't one to be missed.
"When my parents come to Stanford,
I hit all the amazing Palo Alto restau
rants." he said. "Normally I can't afford
that."
The Townies' Take
A staple of any university town is the
old-fashioned local bookstore, but due to
skyrocketing rent prices, Bell's Books is
the last of the quintessentially collegiate
independent shops in Palo Alto.
Owner Faith Bell remembers a time
when the town had a community of
mom-and-pop bookstores, but notes that
with the introduction of bigger chains,
Palo Alto's independent integrity is be
coming a casualty to multi-branch cor
porations.
Luckily, the bookstore has survived
what Bell calls the "travesty of corporate
take-over."
Bell credits this survival solely to the
store's proximity to Stanford.
"The University is a huge part of our
world — Stanford shapes Palo Alto in
more ways than the townies are familiar
with." she said. "The kind of intellectual
life, the research that's beinc done, all

have a huge impact on our world. We
wouldn't exist in this form in a place that
was not a university town."
Gordon Biersch Manager Andrew
Armstrong said that while his sports bar
attracts students for Stanford football and
basketball games, the campus' insular
nature has kept its students from having
much of a presence.
"Due to the high level of academics, I
think you see a lot less student activity as
far as going out — it's so much an on-cam
pus sort of school," Armstrong explained.
"And as a whole, I'd say that Stanford stu
dents are more high-maintenance and
picky than most people in their age group.
Palo Alto reflects that."
