## Editorial Calling for safety first, not punishment 
### 
As fall quarter gears up once again,
bicyclists are painfully reminded that
a bicycle infraction can pinch the
pocket just as much as a motor vehicle
infraction. While we encourage more stu
dents to follow the law, we are concerned
about Stanford's overly punitive approach
to bicycle laws. The editorial board encour
ages the University administration to work
with campus police to better educate the
community about bike safety laws and regu
lations.
The purpose behind doling out tickets for
bike traffic law infractions is well inten
tioned: to make sure people heed the law,
whether on bike, on foot or in a car.
According to the California Vehicle Code,
bicycle riders have the same rights and
responsibilities as motor vehicle drivers and
are subject to the same citations and fines,
ones that can top a few hundred dollars.The
expensive tickets encourage students who
are caught not to make the same mistake
twice.
But we are concerned that punishment
has taken the place of meaningful education
about bike laws. Setting traps to purposeful
ly catch students biking to 11 a.m. lectures in
notoriously trafficked areas does not fulfill
the main purpose of bicycle traffic laws: pro
moting safety. Most of those ticketed are not
reckless, flagrant disobeyers of the law. They
are unwitting freshmen or jaded seniors
who are not aware that the ramifications of
running a stop sign on a bike are the same as
doing so in a car.
Education is not only a much less puni
tive method of encouraging safe traffic
habits, but it is arguably more effective.
Dorm meetings, campus outreach, informa
tion sessions and traffic safety panels would
reach hundreds, while nabbing a few stu
dents with tickets here and there really only
educates those who receive the tickets.
Certainly, if students were made fully aware
of the cost of biking without a light, that
five-dollar light might look like a good —
and safe — investment. To make matters
worse, most of the ticket money collected
goes to Santa Clara County, depending on

the geographical location of the incident, so
the money does not necessarily directly ben
efit the campus.
We believe that bike registration and
monthly newsletters from Parking and
Transportation Services (P&TS) are good
measures. More comprehensive efforts,
however, would be far more effective and
welcomed by the community in lieu of bear
ing the financial burden of endless ticketing.
Bike safety panels are currently optional
choices of the residential staff, and students
often neglect to get a new bike light if they
lose or break the one they were originally
provided. We call on Stanford to ensure that
all students know the cost of failing to fully
stop at an intersection. And while the ASSU
bike light giveaways have been a step, we
call on the University to do more to ensure
that no student goes without a bike light.
We are most concerned that the
University is ignoring the true bike safety
problem areas on campus: the White Plaza
and Quad zones. Although the $4 million
renovation of White Plaza was meant to
channel bike traffic more efficiently, the
decrease in bike path space has created a
bike traffic quagmire. Bikes and pedestrians
are perilously funneled into narrow paths,
cement block obstacles disrupt bike traffic
and an obsolete roundabout — the one just
above the intersection of death, near The
Claw — confuses the flow of bikes and
pedestrians.
Perhaps P&TS's resources would be
most effectively allocated towards improve
ments of bike traffic within the pedestrian
zones. Sure, the lane markers, arrows and
roundabouts make some difference, but
without accurate space planning or enforce
ment, they are rendered ineffective.
The assistant director of the University
Planning Office, Cathy Blake, admitted to
The Daily that White Plaza is "a work in
progress." So is our campus' bike safety edu
cation. And until we work to hammer out
the major hazards and dangers posed by on
campus cyclists, we should not unduly pun
ish students for infractions they may not
even be aware of.
