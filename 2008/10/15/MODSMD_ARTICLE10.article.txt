## GSC petitions Univ. for increased diversity Petition asks for concrete action, already has 350 signatures 
### DAN HUANG 
A petition written by the Graduate Student
Council's Diversity Advocacy Committee
(GSC-DAC) is circulating throughout campus,
asking University officials to take a number of
concrete steps to enhance campus diversity.
In the petition, which is addressed to Provost
John Etchemendy, the GSC praises the admin
istration's efforts to increase the representation
of minority groups in Stanford's faculty and
graduate student body, but also suggests a num
ber of diversity policies it hopes the University
will implement.
"We came up with this letter as a result of
discussions that students had during Diversity
Week in 2008," said Courtney Bonam, GSC
DAC co-chair and fifth-year graduate student
in social psychology. "'This letter is one of the
things that we thought students could do to
help the University administration with diversi
ty efforts."

The petition includes specific recommenda
tions on how to increase diversity among facul
ty and graduate students. These include having
"diversity advocates" in every department,
who, according to the petition, would be the
"go-to" people for any diversity issues.
"Ideally, [the diversity advocate] would he a
faculty member who would be able to answer
questions about diversity policy," Bonam said.
"Also, if there's a faculty search committee still
forming and they want to be sure that they're
being inclusive in their search, they could go to
this diversity advocate."
Other recommendations mentioned in the
petition include diversity training for faculty
search and graduate admission staff, diversity
updates during Reunion Homecoming week
end every year and "endowed funding for rele
vant faculty hires, staff positions and graduate
student programming."
The petition has been making the campus
rounds, receiving 357 signatures as of yesterday.
"I think it's a good idea to bring in [people
from] different groups," said Patrick Emelife
•09, who signed the petition. "It adds different
ways of thinking."
But both Emelife and Bonam agree there
will be opposition to the ideas put forth in the

petition.
"There's a significant portion of the student
population that's in support," Bonam said. "But
judging from responses posted on The Daily
Web site at the time of Diversity Week, I'm
guessing that there's a significant portion of stu
dents at Stanford that are not in support of
these ideas."
"One of the common [reasons] for disagree
ing is that people should earn their way into
school," Emelife said.
University officials are optimistic about
improvements in the diversity of faculty and
graduate students.
Vice Provost for Faculty Development and
Diversity Pat Jones said the University is work
ing to make progress in the area of diversity,
and that some of the recommendations listed in
the petition with regard to faculty have already
been implemented.
The GSC-DAC is optimistic.
"We haven't talked face to face with the
provost." Bonam said, "but the administration
has been very willing to listen to our recom
mendations. We want to work collaboratively
with the University administration."
