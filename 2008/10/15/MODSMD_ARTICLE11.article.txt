## Gender-neutral pilot finds success Program currently has approx. 50 students 
### JENNY REMPEL 
Approximately 50 students at
Stanford are currently living with
members of the opposite sex, thanks
to a pilot program on gender-neutral
housing that began this quarter. So
far. students are optimistic about their
new. untraditional housing arrange
ments.
"It's worked out perfectly fine,"
said Eillen Cassidy '09, who is living
with her boyfriend in Terra. Cassidy
was a member of the gender-neutral

task force that met this past spring and
designed the pilot program.
The task force was convened to
explore ways of improving housing
support for transgender students and
to allow upperclassmen and graduate
students to live with roommates of the
opposite sex.
Since gender-neutral programs
have now been implemented in
dozens of universities across the coun
try. many students are surprised that
Stanford is just beginning its pilot pro
gram.
"It's just gender-normative preju
dice," said Sam Julian '10 of the fact
that Stanford is adopting gender-neu
tral housing for the first time this year.
Still, Julian believes Stanford is

"pretty progressive in comparison
with other universities.
Cassidy was impressed by the
amount of time and effort that went
into planning the new housing
arrangements.
"I don't think that it's really hurt
ing anyone to have gender-neutral
housing around," she said. "We're
making our own housing decisions.
They're making their own housing
decisions. I don't see what the big deal
is."
The program could result in some
legal tangles for the University,
though, so the task force took certain
precautions. Sue Nunan. director of
