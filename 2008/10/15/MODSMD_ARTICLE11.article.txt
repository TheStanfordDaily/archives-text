# HOUSING
## Gender-neutral pilot finds success Program currently has approx. 50 students 
### JENNY REMPEL 
Approximately 50 students at
Stanford are currently living with
members of the opposite sex, thanks
to a pilot program on gender-neutral
housing that began this quarter. So
far. students are optimistic about their
new. untraditional housing arrange
ments.
"It's worked out perfectly fine,"
said Eillen Cassidy '09, who is living
with her boyfriend in Terra. Cassidy
was a member of the gender-neutral

task force that met this past spring and
designed the pilot program.
The task force was convened to
explore ways of improving housing
support for transgender students and
to allow upperclassmen and graduate
students to live with roommates of the
opposite sex.
Since gender-neutral programs
have now been implemented in
dozens of universities across the coun
try. many students are surprised that
Stanford is just beginning its pilot pro
gram.
"It's just gender-normative preju
dice," said Sam Julian '10 of the fact
that Stanford is adopting gender-neu
tral housing for the first time this year.
Still, Julian believes Stanford is

"pretty progressive in comparison
with other universities.
Cassidy was impressed by the
amount of time and effort that went
into planning the new housing
arrangements.
"I don't think that it's really hurt
ing anyone to have gender-neutral
housing around," she said. "We're
making our own housing decisions.
They're making their own housing
decisions. I don't see what the big deal
is."
The program could result in some
legal tangles for the University,
though, so the task force took certain
precautions. Sue Nunan. director of


BECCA DEL MONTE/The Stanford Daily
housing assignments, explained that upperclass
men and graduate students can request gender
neutral housing, hut they must first draw into a
residence offering the pilot program. Once in the
residence, they can then decide on housing
arrangements during the in-house draw.
"TTie implementation of this program has
been well received by the students and staff in
these buildings," Nunan said in an email to The
Daily.
Currently, the program is only offered to stu
dents in Narnia, Terra, Castano, Mirrielees and
Rains Graduate Housing. Narnia resident Solly
Mirell 10 was critical about the limited options
for students requesting gender-neutral housing.
"1 think Stanford should open it up to all
dorms," Mirell said. "You shouldn't necessarily
be forced to live in certain co-ops or certain
houses simply because you want to live with a
member of the opposite gender."
But Julian thinks enough options exist for stu
dents requesting mixed-sex housing, especially
when including co-ops like Synergy, where he is
living.
"7he only policy that ought to be changed is
that of breaking up mixed-gender draw groups,"
he said.

"I really don't think having to live
with a guy or a girl makes that
big of a difference"
— Solly Mirell '10
Mirell was somewhat surprised that no stu
dents living in Narnia opted for gender-neutral
housing. His roommate is going abroad next
quarter, though, so he might choose to live with
a roommate of the opposite sex.
"I really don't think having to live with a guy
or a girl makes that big of a difference," Mirell
said.
Nick Hartfield '09 agreed, hoping the pro
gram will help optimize housing arrangements.
"It's going to allow people to find more har
monious roommate situations.'' Hartfield said.
"It's going to increase safety for some people
who do feel threatened about issues of gender
identity or gender classification."
Hartfield expressed excitement about the
future of the program.
"I'm really excited that Stanford is moving
forward with gender-neutral housing," he said."l
can't wait for it to be further implemented
throughout the rest of campus."
