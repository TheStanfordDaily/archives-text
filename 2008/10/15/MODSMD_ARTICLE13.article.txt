## Editorial Students need comprehensive events calendar 
### 
Students packed the Quad last night for
yet another Full Moon on the Quad, but
without a standardized method for event
publicizing, many students were left out of
the loop regarding details about the celebra
tion. Those who puckered up most likely
found out about the event and pre-shows
through a variety of channels, from email lists
to dorm staff to word of mouth, and probably
missed out on some information in the
process.
Full Moon is not alone in this respect. A
shroud of mystery still hangs over the details
of the Mausoleum Party, which is just over
two weeks away, and planners of ASSU
events or speakers series often rely on spam
ming chat lists to announce their activities.
For this reason, the editorial board offers
the Office of Student Affairs, ASSU and any
willing party a challenge: create a compre
hensive calendar of student events on cam
pus. While neither helping to battle greater
societal ills nor presenting an attractive cam
paign plank off which to build a political ca
reer, a student events calendar would make a
tangible difference in student life here at
Stanford, streamlining what is often an inun
dation of scattered information.
There are over 600 diverse student groups
on campus, representing a wide swath of in
terests and beliefs. It is not uncommon to feel
swamped or overwhelmed by the possible
events to attend or groups to join. Yet what is
being done to make the flow of information
easier, to allow student groups a sound plat
form by which to reach the entire school?
House meetings — at which the sheer
number of "outside" announcements borders
on the absurd — along with word of mouth,
fliering, tabling and chalking are the main
means by which to "effectively" publicize
programming. Only so much information can
be retained when you bike past the sheets
hung in White Plaza and attempt to avoid
running into a group s table.
Events.stanford.edu does little to help the
average student. The site lists only a smatter
ing of student events, featuring an over

whelming amount of programming targeted
at members of the larger Stanford communi
ty. The forum reads more like a brochure for
Parents Weekend, rather than a representa
tive cross section of student life on the Farm.
Events.stanford.edu unequivocally fails the
student body in providing information perti
nent to our lives.
With such an overload wracking the minds
of already overstretched students, a student
events calendar would be an enormous bene
fit for a variety of reasons. Student groups,
many of which fight tooth and nail often to
gain both visibility on campus and the requi
site signatures for special fees budgets, would
be able to reach all Stanford students and
could be held accountable for how exactly the
student body's money is being spent.
The ASSU, which is often lampooned on
campus for failing to effectively present its
message and agenda, would have the ultimate
buttress to such an argument. By posting up
dates on events and meetings dealing with
certain issues, and providing updates on spe
cific projects, the ASSU could make the
workings of student government more trans
parent to the average student — a marked
improvement over the past.
An online calendar accessible to all Stan
ford students with SUnet IDs, and for char
tered student group/student government
leaders to post information and events, is a
long overdue program. The OSA, which es
pouses its concern for the well being of stu
dent life on campus, should be taking the lead
on such a sound program. We also hope that
the ASSU will give much needed attention to
this potentially vital campus asset.
A student events calendar would be a tan
gible benefit to all of campus, and would re
quire only the savvy of a few tech wizards. If
we as a campus claim to value the role of stu
dent groups in our lives, then it is incumbent
upon us to advocate for such a calendar, a tool
that could spark a revival of the oft-ignored
idea of taking up issues that benefit not just
certain groups, but the entirety of Stanford
University.
