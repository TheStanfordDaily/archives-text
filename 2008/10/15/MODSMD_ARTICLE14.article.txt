## Some traditions need to die 
### 
Some traditions have worn out their wel
come. Every sportscaster who has men
tioned the Play since 1982, every dish
Stanford Dining has made from a week's
worth of leftovers and every group that has
decided to roll out new inductees at god
awful hours since I got here has clearly
crossed the delicate line between idiosyncrat
ic and cruel.
That's right, I am talking about rollouts,
that regrettably sacrosanct tenet of Stanford
extracurricular life. I have no idea when or
how the tradition started (you will soon
learn. Reader, of my disdain for knowledge),
but it seems like today no group can be legit
imate on this campus until it has rolled out its
new members and anyone else in hearing
range at some unholy hour of the morning.
"But Kevin," I hear you saying in my tired,
slightly angry head, "rollouts are a fun way to
bring people into the group. What's the big
deal?"
I am so glad you asked, hypothetical voice
you, and I plan to answer your question with
my favorite rebuttal to questions: answers.
Here goes.
First and foremost, the tradition of roll
outs is one that actually harms innocent peo
ple. Anyone here knows how little sleep the
average Stanfordian receives, and while it
may range in value, it usually boils down to
"not enough." To wake people up only a cou
ple of hours before they plan to do so is un
necessarily mean.
Having been a first-floor RA last year, I
hold a very special grudge in my heart for roll
outs — I was usually the one who had to let
the groups in. One day, I got a call at 6:45 a.m.
— A.M.!!! — from someone I'm not particu
larly close to, telling me to open the door so
she could roll people out, even though plenty
of lounge windows were wide open. I was so
angry I couldn't fall back asleep, and so this
piece was born.
Secondly, rollouts have become com
monplace. to the point where groups seem
less valid when they don't roll their newest
inductees out. Honestly, I don't care about
your juggling Socialist Engineers of Scot
land group, or whatever else it might be. (Ac
tually, I take that back. Someone should def
initely start that group). At the very least, I
don't care enough to be woken up and not
resent the group. Not rolling people out
doesn't make your group sucky — it makes
it merciful.
Finally, rollouts are cowardly. "But how
are they cowardly, Kevin?" hypothetical
voice you asks again. "We get to have fun ad
ventures breaking into dorms and waking up
reluctant RAs!"
Here's why: When you roll someone out at

6 a.m. — or, more often these days, 7 a.m. —
that's just weak. You wake up people who are
too determined to fall back asleep to yell back
at you. And if you must roll people out, please,
please, please make it brief. I have never been
so close to violence as I was at minute 30 of a
certain sports team's rollout of one of my
frosh. Thank you, unnamed sports team, for
proving that I can resent something more
than my alarm clock.
Here's an approach I would have respect
for: Instead of waking defenseless people up
early, find out their classes and schedules. A
little stalkerish? Yes, but whatever. Do it, and
then pinpoint an IHUM section and roll the
poor kid out then. Chances are, the section's
nowhere near as valuable as the kid's sleep is,
and said section might appreciate the enter
tainment only a troop of Scottish, Socialist
jugglers with pocket protectors could pro
vide.
You rollout-ers out there reading this
probably think this suggestion is ridiculous.
And maybe it is. But the point I'm highlight
ing is this: you wouldn't interrupt a class filled
with conscious people to announce your or
ganization. Why would you wake people up
to do it?
For those of you out there who are both
vindictive and go-getters (I know you're out
there!), here's an idea: wait until a group rolls
someone out near you. Find out which group
it was, and then track down its members.
Choose a morning, and bang on the door of
each member until he/she wakes up. Then
leave. Try to do this around finals week for
maximum results!
Don't get me wrong — when one of my
freshmen gets into a club, I'm thrilled for him
or her. Getting involved in activities is a fan
tastic way to meet new people and enrich the
atmosphere at Stanford. But I can promise
you I would be much more excited for said
resident if I didn't have to wake up from my
dreams of beautiful women, absurd wealth,
dinosaurs or some combination of the three
to celebrate.

Kevin wrote this as a sleep-deprived RA in 2(X)7
and has since sinned and rolled people out too.
