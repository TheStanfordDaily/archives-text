## The 						big questions 
### 
£ £ "X TT Tho am I? Why am I here?"
w
Thus spake, notoriously, Vice Admiral
James B. Stockdale, Hoover fellow and vice
presidential running mate to Ross Perot.
If Stockdale had uttered these words in a
Stanford philosophy class, they would have
been seen, appropriately, as those of a daz
zlingly accomplished American veteran and
academic.
Instead, they were uttered in the midst of
the 1992 vice presidential debate. The heroic
admiral with a master's in Marxist theory
came out looking worse than Dan Quayle,all
because he wore a hearing aid and asked
some funny questions.
These funny questions, of course, are The
Big Questions, the ones that have driven
much of human thought for countless gener
ations past.
For some reason, though, answering them
is still a bit difficult. Sure, 1 can give it a whirl:
Q: Who am I?
A: Alex Romanczuk.
Q: Why am I here?
A:The Daily couldn't find any columnists
and started grabbing random, funny-haired
people off the street.
But often, my initial answers to such ques
tions have problems, inconsistencies or
damning shortcomings. For instance, I could
have also said that my purpose here is to pro
vide an entertaining weekly tech column
while simultaneously rooting out evildoing
commies from their lairs. Think Joe Mc-
Carthy crossed with LOLcats.
Really, though, everyone knows we can't
answer these questions with certainty. The
best one can do is arrive at an approximate
answer, roughly triangulated from experi
ences in the physical world, the inclinations
of one's own self and the opinions of others.
Let's leave out the first two elements of
approximation for today and talk about my
discovery of a wonderful, surprising, hereto
fore unknown technological aid for the third:
the Internet!
Specifically, I'd like to direct your atten
tion toward two fascinating sites: Metafilter
and Yahoo Answers. ITie basic premise of
these sites is that users can post questions
and receive answers from other users.
Some discussions, like "How do I achieve

The next time you
have a pressing life
question, seek solace
on the Internet.

toned, six-pack abs with reduction of shoul
der size?" are quite amusing, while others,
like "Recommend a comfortable and stor
able reading chair," are surprisingly helpful.
In an attempt to determine just how help
ful these sites could be, I decided to see how
they handled The Big Questions.
I began with Metafilter, which usually has
higher-quality content than Yahoo Answers.
To my dismay, however, I found that you
have to pay five dollars and wait a week to
post a query. This would explain the higher
quality content — they keep out the riffraff
like me.
You can, however, still see posted re
sponses without a subscription. In the sur
prisingly moving "Meaning in a Meaningless
world?" discussion, someone writes, "The ac
ceptance of suffering is in itself a liberating
act; you conquer your pain by accepting it as
part of you, and that brings with it a transcen
dent form of freedom and happiness ...

You're not alone."
Some users recommend specific literary
works, while others recommend types of help
the original poster should seek. Each one of
the responses is thoughtful and caring, and
they all come together and do their best to
save one young man's life.
In a more somber mood than 1 anticipat
ed, 1 moved onto the relative free-for-all that
is Yahoo Answers. I began by asking some
fundamentals: "What is the point of life?
Who am I? Why am I here?"
One user replied, "There is no point. You
could probably best define who you are. If
you want to know why you exist in the first
place, ask your parents."
Another countered with, "Figure it out by
getting a dictionary, and this is a serious an
swer ... OR — find cristianity [sic)]."
Excited by the eagerness of responders
but disillusioned by the ethereal nature of
philosophy, I decided to move on to an easi
er, more practical question: "I like both
math/science/engineering and the humani
ties, but I'm unsure of which direction to go.
Any advice?"
And, oh, was there advice. Oklahoma
State Alumnus wrote, "Something that will
get you a good job like science or business.
Avoid foo-foo degrees like philosophy and
art history unless you dream of a career at
McDonalds." Van Helsing noted, simply,
"Herb."
Of the seven who made specific recom
mendations (there were 11 replies total), six
told me to become a techie.
What gives, Yahoo, with the fuzzy-hating?
I brooded, disillusioned with my love of
the humanities and my choice to write this
column. All seemed bleak.
But then I remembered Metafilter. Those
online existentialists argued that, while life
was bleak, we had the power to create our
own purpose and meaning. There was free
dom in meaninglessness!
And thus, a column was born.
So the next time you have a pressing life
question, seek solace on the Internet.The an
swers may be hard to find, but they are there.
National TV, on the other hand, doesn't
seem to work that great.

If you have a heavy question of your own, send
it to Alex at aproman@stanford.edu.
