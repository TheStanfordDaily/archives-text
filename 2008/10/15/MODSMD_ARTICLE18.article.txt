## Trustees wrap up two days of meetings Board discussed undergraduate expansion, approves Medical Center design plans 
### NIKHIL JOSHI DESK EDITOR 
At its two-day meeting this week, the University's Board of
Trustees discussed for the first time the topic of expanding the
undergraduate student body, approved the design concept for
the Stanford Medical Center expansion and reviewed the
Stanford Management Company's performance in managing
the endowment.
"Everybody is concerned about and sensitive to the current
economy, and very grateful for the kind of response we've had
to the [fundraising] campaign and the kind of development
results we've had." said Board President Leslie Hume Ph. D.'79
in a press briefing.
Hume and the Board were thrilled that Stanford
Management Company was able to achieve a 6.2-percent
return in the face of a struggling economy.
"Stanford is so fortunate because we have an endowment
that has performed very well; the Management Company

couldn't be in better hands." Hume said. "The Board has
tremendous confidence in [the company's CEO] John Powers
and the Management Company. We all feel that Stanford is
very fortunate that it is as well managed as it is, both in terms
of the endowment and the University itself."
Hume said the Board spent a significant amount of time
reviewing the progress of the task force on undergraduate
expansion and discussing the possibility of admitting more stu
dents, but emphasized that the process remains very much in
the fact-finding stage.
The task force, which is in the process of meeting with stu
dents, department chairs, the ASSU and the Faculty Senate, will
most likely finish its work by December or January, according
to Hume.
While the Board does not have direct fiduciary responsibil
ity for Lucille Packard Children's Hospital and Stanford
Hospital and Clinics (the hospitals both have their own boards)
the Board of Trustees did review and approve the design plan
for the proposed Medical Center expansion.
The Board also approved a number of building projects,
including the School of Engineering Center, to be built across
from Y2E2.
