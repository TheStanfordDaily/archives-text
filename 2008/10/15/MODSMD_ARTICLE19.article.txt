## Senior captains lead dominant Card defense 
### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
You've got to be strong up the mid
dle. The axiom is commonplace
throughout sports, denoting the
importance of a strong, central
foundation to a team's success.
And though the saying is most often used in
baseball, just watch Marisa Abegg and Alli
son "Kirby" Falk and it's easy to see why the
phrase belongs in the soccer lexicon as well.
As center backs for the No. 5 Stanford
women's soccer team, Abegg and Falk have
commanded a Cardinal defense that has al
lowed only three goals in 13 matches, the sec
ond-best ratio in the nation. Also, as captains
— along with junior fullback Ali Riley —
and the only starting seniors on a relatively
young team, they have played an integral
part in leading and organizing the squad as
well.
"They're critical to our success," Stanford
head coach Paul Ratcliffe said. "They're
great leaders on and off field. They've had a
lot of great experience through four years.

and know what it takes to be successful."
The defense's success this season has
certainly come as a surprise to some.

given that the Cardinal lost All-Amer
ican and U.S. Olympic central de

fender Rachel Buehler and fullback
April Wall, a starter for four years,
to graduation last year. The lack of

a center back to replace Buehler led Rat
cliffe to have Abegg partner with Falk in the
center of the Stanford defense — a switch
from her natural left back position. Riley
and fellow junior Alicia Jenkins — a for
ward and a utility player in 2007, respective
ly — were then called upon to man the full
back positions.
Nevertheless, this completely revamped
backline has dominated opposing offenses.
Their scoreless streak now extends back over
five full matches to a 4-1 victory over Yale on
Sept. 19. and even that one Bulldog goal was
more than a bit unlucky, resulting from a
massive deflection off a free kick. In the Car
dinal's most recent match, a 3-0 blanking of
Oregon State, the Beavers couldn't even get
a shot off until the 63rd minute. Abegg and
Falk were the only Cardinal players to go the
full 90 minutes.
So how were they able to develop their
center back partnership so well, so quickly?
"1 think a lot of it is playing next to each
other for so many years," Falk said. "Even
though we haven't been center backs togeth
er, most of the time we have been playing
next to each other, as 1 have been left center

back and Marisa has been left outside."
"There is also something to be said for the
fact that we are good friends off the field as
well," Abegg added. "[That] makes the trust
issue on the field a great deal easier."
Whatever the reason, the pair has made
for an intimidating partnership at the back
end for the Cardinal. The six-foot Falk has
been dominating aerially, stopping countless
long balls and set pieces, while Abegg uses
her speed, positional awareness and plain old
tenacity to cut out most attacks before they
can even get going. Simply put, the two com
plement each other very well.
They have shown endurance too, with
Abegg leading the team in minutes played
and Falk third, just behind sophomore goal
keeper Kira Maker — stats that are even
more key this year, as the team lacks a true
backup at center back. Abegg and Falk have
embraced that dependability and the other
aspects of being captains.
"Before, when I was an underclassman. I
was just trying to get through games and
practices doing the best I could." Abegg said.
"But now it's a little different in that 1 want
to make sure the team as a whole is doing

well and playing to our potential."
"Because we have experienced a great
deal of situations both on and off the field,
hopefully we can instill a sense of confidence
in everyone around us that we can succeed
and overcome any obstacles that may get in
our way," Falk said.
As four-year starters, both have experi
enced a lot and have been on very talented
Stanford teams. But with the dream season
that the 2008 incarnation of the Cardinal is
having so far, both will admit that this squad
is special.
"[The] one thing about the team this year
is that we have so many good players," Falk
said."We don't just have a starting eleven, we
have an entire team of very skillful and tal
ented players ... [and] our team chemistry
and cohesiveness this year is great."
Abegg took it one step further.
"Everyone is willing to put in the work for
the big picture," she said. "[We challenge]
each other each and every training session,
and that is what essentially will make us the
best team that I have ever been on."
Good enough to lift the College Cup in
December? Only time will tell. But there's
another old sports saying that says,"Defense
wins championships." If that one rings true,
don't put it past the senior center back

combo to lead the Cardinal to some
postseason hardware.
