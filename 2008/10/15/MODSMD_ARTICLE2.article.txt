# Full Moon gently rises on Quad
## Tight security, focus on avoiding binge drinking result in tamer kiss-a-thon 
### ALEXA MERZ JAMES HOHMANN 
There were a few PDAs in the Quad
early this morning, but most were
Blackberries and iPhones.
Some freshmen, with little kissing
experience, asked for pecks on the cheek.
A few Frenched. Tables with chocolates,
mints and cups of electric blue mouth
wash were strategically placed for easy
access.
If that wasn't enough, the University's
Peer Health Educators handed out con
doms in six different colors for those who
planned to run for another base.
The global financial crisis, a presiden
tial campaign and midterms didn't deter
the roughly 1,500 students who trickled

(the graduate students stood out).

seemed to keep the larger crowds of pre
vious years away.
Most, however, seemed intent on only
observing the osculation.

Though students came to the Quad

dry and crack down on pre-gaming had
mixed success. Even though organizers
said "obviously intoxicated" students
would be turned away by police, it was
clear that most who made it in had
imbibed at least a little. Some entrances
were left unguarded, and the proceedings
were graced with the unmistakable aroma
of cheap vodka.
Officers and EMTs watched the crowd
from the periphery, assisted by 40 under
graduate sober monitors. One of them
was Peter Davis '11, co-president of the

Couples share kisses after midnight as the full moon shines down upon the Quad, illuminating a scene that is always part revelry, part tradition and sev
