# Full Moon gently rises on Quad
## Tight security, focus on avoiding binge drinking result in tamer kiss-a-thon 
### ALEXA MERZ JAMES HOHMANN 
There were a few PDAs in the Quad
early this morning, but most were
Blackberries and iPhones.
Some freshmen, with little kissing
experience, asked for pecks on the cheek.
A few Frenched. Tables with chocolates,
mints and cups of electric blue mouth
wash were strategically placed for easy
access.
If that wasn't enough, the University's
Peer Health Educators handed out con
doms in six different colors for those who
planned to run for another base.
The global financial crisis, a presiden
tial campaign and midterms didn't deter
the roughly 1,500 students who trickled
into the Quad past security checkpoints
(the graduate students stood out).
Temperatures in the mid-50s and the
event's timing —on a TUesday night —
seemed to keep the larger crowds of pre
vious years away.
Most, however, seemed intent on only
observing the osculation.

Though students came to the Quad
expecting a show of locking lips and twist
ing tongues, many were disappointed
when the clock struck midnight.
It was Full Moon on the Quad. Or
Stanford's Mardi Gras, the annual event
CosmoGIRL! Magazine deems this uni
versity's "claim to fame." Yet some might
liken this year's version to bad sex: unnec
essary build-up, too much waiting around
and a feeble climax.
Organizers' efforts to keep the event
dry and crack down on pre-gaming had
mixed success. Even though organizers
said "obviously intoxicated" students
would be turned away by police, it was
clear that most who made it in had
imbibed at least a little. Some entrances
were left unguarded, and the proceedings
were graced with the unmistakable aroma
of cheap vodka.
Officers and EMTs watched the crowd
from the periphery, assisted by 40 under
graduate sober monitors. One of them
was Peter Davis '11, co-president of the

sophomore class and one of the
event's organizers. Like the other
volunteers, he wore a white T-shirt
with the word "Sober" displayed in
red as he mingled with the crowds.
"Our job is to walk between peo
ple and see maybe what police don't
see," he said, noting that those suf
fering the effects of excessive drink
ing were being taken to a medical
tent set up behind Memorial
Church.
A special section of the red-brick
Quad was reserved for same-sex
smooching.
In Freshmen Bingo, senior boys
and girls — and those impersonat
ing them — carried cards with the
names of freshman dorms. When the
festivities began, they tried to get
the boxes checked off.
Nudes bedecked in body paint
have been a fixture of Full Moons of
the past, and last night's was no
exception. At precisely 11:45 p.m.,
upwards of 80 naked upperclassmen
streaked in from a painting party at
Columbae.
The Band arrived at the Quad
four minutes after midnight for a
finale following the performance of
eight other groups. Over the previ
ous two hours, students had per
formed songs that fit the occasion's
billing, including "I Kissed a Girl"
and "I'm a Nympho."
Pra Chandrasoma '09, of the
band Occam's Razor, said Full
Moon is their best show of the year.
"It's got a different sort of ener
gy," he said. "It really feeds on all the
anticipation ahead of midnight."
But Chandrasoma didn't plan on

"If there's a
guy who's
sick, we're not
kissing him.
Come on.
Midterms!"

kissing anyone.
"I'm really shy and I have a girl
friend," he said. "Those are my two
excuses."
For a few, though, monogamy
wasn't the word of the night. In
seeking to run up their tally of kiss
es, some registered in the double
digits.
A junior, who would only say his
name is Zach for fear of repercus
sions, said he was pretending to be a
senior "for the chicks."
Clarifying, "I'm an urban cow
boy," he predicted he would kiss 300
girls.

The sparkling mosaic tiles on
Memorial Church reflected onto
revelers below. At least two students
came in tuxedos. Others wore stilet
tos, reflective miniskirts and metallic
leggings. Dressing up, however, did
n't translate into kisses when the
time came, as most girls appeared
content to chat with their friends.
Full Moon was one of the busiest
nights of the year for sSure.The stu
dent golf cart rideshare had set up a
table to coordinate rides back for
students to their dorms. The service
reported more than 300 calls for
service as of 1 a.m. — over twice the
average number for a Friday or
Saturday night.
More than in past years, fear of
contracted illness seemed a signifi
cant concern. By Nov. 12, the date of
the lunar calendar's next full moon,
students who got routine colds from
making out with strangers should
recover. But those who contracted
mononucleosis, if any, will still be
recuperating.
All but a dozen of the roughly 90
residents in Otero, an all-frosh
dorm, came to the Quad last night.
But though they appreciated the
sentiment, they seemed hesitant to
carry on the tradition of kissing a
senior.
"There's crazy people, and
there's conservative people," said
Amy Dao' 12. "If there's a guy who's
sick, we're not kissing him. Come
on. Midterms!"

Full Moon was one of the busiest
nights of the year for sSure.The stu
dent golf cart rideshare had set up a
table to coordinate rides back for
students to their dorms. The service

average number for a Friday or
Saturday night.
More than in past years, fear of
contracted illness seemed a signifi
cant concern. By Nov. 12, the date of
the lunar calendar's next full moon,
students who got routine colds from
making out with strangers should
recover. But those who contracted
mononucleosis, if any, will still be
recuperating.
All but a dozen of the roughly 90
residents in Otero, an all-frosh
dorm, came to the Quad last night.
But though they appreciated the
sentiment, they seemed hesitant to
carry on the tradition of kissing a
senior.

The Sexual Health Peer Resource Center hosted a table where students participating in a sexual health quiz were rewarded with free condoms. Also distributed

There were a few PDAs in the Quad
early this morning, but most were

Some freshmen, with little kissing
experience, asked for pecks on the cheek.

The global financial crisis, a presiden

the roughly 1,500 students who trickled

Temperatures in the mid-50s and the
event's timing —on a TUesday night —
seemed to keep the larger crowds of pre

Most, however, seemed intent on only
observing the osculation.

Though students came to the Quad
expecting a show of locking lips and twist

It was Full Moon on the Quad. Or
Stanford's Mardi Gras, the annual event
CosmoGIRL! Magazine deems this uni

liken this year's version to bad sex: unnec

and a feeble climax.
Organizers' efforts to keep the event
dry and crack down on pre-gaming had
mixed success. Even though organizers
said "obviously intoxicated" students
would be turned away by police, it was
clear that most who made it in had
imbibed at least a little. Some entrances
were left unguarded, and the proceedings
were graced with the unmistakable aroma
of cheap vodka.
Officers and EMTs watched the crowd

Nudes bedecked in body paint

upwards of 80 naked upperclassmen

The Band arrived at the Quad
four minutes after midnight for a
finale following the performance of
eight other groups. Over the previ

and "I'm a Nympho."
Pra Chandrasoma '09, of the
