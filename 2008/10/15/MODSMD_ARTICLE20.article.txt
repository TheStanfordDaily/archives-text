## Stanford looks to defend ITA titles 
### JOSH ALVAREZ 
The Cardinal men's tennis team will head to
Berkeley this weekend to defend its titles in the
Wilson ITA Regional Championships. Stan
ford will enter the tournament as defending
champion of both the individual and doubles
competitions.
Last year, the Cardinal swept the doubles
competition by having two of its own doubles
teams advance to the finals. Sophomore Ted
Kelly and senior Blake Muller defeated sopho
more Greg Hirshman and junior Richard Wire
8-2 to take the doubles crown. Earlier that
same day. Wire knocked out Andy Kuharszky
of Washington to claim the individual throne.
When asked about whether there was any
ribbing between the two doubles teams, coach
John Whitlinger chuckled as he described the
friendly tension that still remains.
"They don't really talk about [last year's
final]," he said."We are still a couple days away
from the competition, but I think they may kid

each other when it comes time."
"It's a great thing as a coach to sit back and
watch your own team play each other,"
Whitlinger continued. "I was really pleased
with last year's results."
Stanford's success in last year's Regional
Championship came at the expense of none
other than arch-rival California. Both Cardinal
doubles teams that made it to the final had to
go through a Bears doubles team in their re
spective semifinal matches. Kelly and Muller
shut out Jonathan Dahan and Pierre Mouillon
8-0. while Hirshman and Wire upset Geoff
Chivezer and Pedro Zerbini, who were then
seeded second, 8-4.
ITiis year could be a potential rematch for
Stanford and Cal's doubles teams. However,
Mouillon is no longer playing for Cal, and
Muller is now paired with Matt Bruch. 'I"he
Dahan and Mouillon pair, meanwhile,has been
replaced by Andy Chirita and Zach Gilbert.
Bruch and Muller are currently ranked No.
6 in the ITA West Region.They arc closely fol

lowed by Chivezer and Zerbini at No. 11.
Recently, Cal followed a similar pattern to
Stanford's when both of the Bears' doubles
teams (Chivezer/Zerbini,Chirita/Gilbert) won
their respective brackets at the Fresno State
Bulldog Classic.
Chizever and Zerbini's recent success at the
Classic is a continuation of a streak of success
stretching back to last season. The duo claimed
the 2007 Chandler's C'up Doubles title and
posted a team-high 10-2 record.
"We just have to go out and do the best we
can," Whitlinger said. "The focus is to try to im
prove."
According to Whitlinger, most, if not all, of
the Stanford squad is expected to be in atten
dance. ITicre will be eight Cardinal players tak
ing part in the singles competition, along with
five doubles teams.
"I really doubt that we will have the same
pairing for doubles as we did last year,"
Whitlinger said. "We've been shuffling people
around — we really are a different team from
