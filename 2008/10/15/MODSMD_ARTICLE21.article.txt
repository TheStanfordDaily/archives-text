# Out with Nolan, in with Kiffin

### 
Sometimes it's hard to admit
when you're wrong. It can take a
while to realize that something
isn't what you thought it was; it's a
feeling just about everyone has had in
their personal lives and — unless
they're currently fans of the Boston
Red Sox, Celtics, New York Giants
and LSU college football — proba
bly in their lives as sports fans as well.
It's hard to believe, but just a few
short years ago there were Miami
Dolphins fans who couldn't wait for
Nick Saban to lead them to a new era
of post-Marino glory. There were
Bears fans who knew Rex Grossman
was the answer to their longstanding
QB woes. There were Cardinal fans
who believed in Walt Harris.
Sooner or later, that belief that
better times are just around the cor
ner usually ends. Once the proverbial
honeymoon is over, all that a new
coach or player has to fall back on are
results — and when viewed in a light
that doesn't include the fans' wildest
expectations for the future, that can
be a harsh view indeed.
At this very minute. Mike Nolan
of the San Francisco 49ers is facing
such a spotlight of public scrutiny.
Nolan inherited an absolutely
abysmal 49ers team four years ago
thanks to his reputation as a top
notch defensive coordinator with the
Ravens, as well as his family ties to
the 49ers organization (his father.
Dick Nolan, coached the team in the
late '70s). Early on, his reign was al
most universally applauded by Nin
ers fans.
True, there were some rough
patches, but on the whole the team
seemed to be headed in the right di
rection. After doubling the squad's
win total (to four) from the previous
year in 2005, Nolan led the team back
io the brink of respectability in 2006
as the Niners finished 7-9, with excit
ing young players at key offensive
skill positions and a defense that
made big strides late in the year.
Then the wheels fell off. Partially
due to a strange turn of events by
which offensive coordinator Norv
Turner wound up as the new head
coach of the Chargers in 2007, San
Francisco's offense floundered in
2007. And so far in 2008. the team has
failed to justify Nolan's retention
headed into his fourth season as head
coach.
And now. as an admittedly rabid
49ers fan myself. I am finally forced to
admit that Mike Nolan probably isn't
the guy to fix the mess in San Francis
co that has lingered since the depar
ture of Steve Mariucci in 2002. For all
the good moments, eventually you
just have to realize it's not going to
happen.
7"he hard thing about this particu
lar firing is that there can be absolute
ly no doubt that Nolan, who con
trolled the team's personnel moves
for the vast majority of his tenure, will
leave the roster and front office at
4949 Centennial Blvd in Santa Clara
in much better shape than he found it.
The players remaining from the
final days of Dennis Erickson's
tenure can be counted on your fin
gers, and most are role players, not
stars. What hope the team does have
lies almost entirely with players
Nolan himself brought in: the fabu
lous explosiveness of Frank Gore, the
tremendous defensive leadership of
Patrick Willis, the obscene athleti
cism of Vernon Davis. From top to
bottom, it would be hard to argue that
Nolan failed to improve the team
during his time in San Francisco.
And yet, the results simply aren't
there. The team has gone from being
the least talented team in the NFL to
a team of middling talent that consis
tently seems to fall short against beat
able opponents. Veteran linebacker
Jeff IJlbrich seemed to admit as much
to reporters following the 49ers" 40-
26 loss to the Eagles on Sunday. In
essence, with the 49ers, it's suddenly
clear that the whole has become less
than the sum of the parts.
Usually, that's a good sign that it's
time for a coach to go.
Forgive me. Mike. Really, it's not
you — it's us. We 49er fans (and
local media) have always had a bit of
a predisposition towards the offen
sive guru head coach, and you never
quite fit that bill. Your insistence on
investing heavily in the trenches
