GAME NOTES: Camille Gandhi returned to
the Cardinal after a two-game absence dur
ing which she represented the United States
at the Pan American Junior Championships.
The UC-Davis field hockey team is currently
on the club level, and is not a varsity sport.
The Cardinal rebounded against Davidson
after a disappointing East Coast road trip
during, when Stanford lost two games by a
combined two goals.

Crusaders went on to edge out the
Cardinal in overtime.
These were the first two matches
that Stanford played without sopho

more offensive threat Camille
Gandhi, who is representing the
United States at the Pan American
Junior Championships in Mexico
City.
In addition to Gandhi, the Cardi
nal has had to play without senior
defender Bailey Richardson, who
suffered a concussion during a game
against Redford on Sept. 19, and was
forced to sit out the next two games.
She returned to the team for the
road trip against Northeastern and
Holy Cross. Those two matches —
against Longwood and Pacific —
were the first games she had missed
in her four years at Stanford.
Indeed, the skills and talents of
Richardson had been prominent on
the field for 69 consecutive games.
Richardson claims she experienced
the most difficult moments in her
field hockey career while sitting on
the bench, unable to act, having to
endure the anxiety and stress of
watching the game from a distance.
Having spent four years on the
Farm, Richardson is one of the most
experienced players on the team, having
been through many of the ups and downs of
the program. In an interview with GoStan
ford.com, Richardson was asked about the
team's mindset after a successful season last
year, followed by frustration at the outset of
the 2008 campaign. Richardson responded
with confidence in her team, and their abil
ity to come together to find some wins.
"Last year's early schedule made it com
fortable for us to come in with confidence
and get started on a 6-0 streak," she told
GoStanford.com. "This year, we've faced
off against some really tough teams, and we
all enjoy taking on that challenge. I still be
lieve that when we're playing well this year,
though, it's at a higher level than we were
playing at any point last year. We just have
to figure out how to stay consistent. We will
turn it around."
A very strong advantage the team has
right now is the experience gained from last
year's trip to the conference tournament.
The results were as good as they could be —
the Cardinal won the NorPac Tournament
title.
"It's going to be interesting," Richard
son told GoStanford.com of the team's
chances to repeat. "The way it usually
works out is that we meet Cal in the cham
pionship game, and we are on different
sides of the bracket. So it will be interesting
to see if we have to play them early on in the
tournament."
"I'm positive that our team will come out
with a lot of emotion no matter who we
play," she continued in the interview."For us
seniors, there's nothing left after that. I think
our offense is starting to click and there is no
reason why we can't put together another
run like we did last year. I think we believe
at the end that we're going to be there."
With Richardson and Gandhi back on
their home field yesterday, the Cardinal re
bounded in a big way, trouncing the Wild
cats 3-0 in a NorPac Conference matchup.
Travlos led the Cardinal with five shots,
scoring on her second to give Stanford an
early 1-0 lead at the 10:21 mark.The Cardi
nal wouldn't look back as junior Midori Ue
hara and freshman Stephanie Byrne scored
second-half goals to seal the win for the
Stanford women. The Cardinal outshot
Davidson 17-5 on the day.
Next up for Stanford is a home match
against UC-Davis on Sunday at 1 p.m. fol
lowed by road matchups against Cal and
Pacific next week.
