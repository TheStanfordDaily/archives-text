# STUDENT LIFE
## Seniors consider grad school Economic downtown, slow job market lead students to more school 
### KATE BARBER 
With first-round business school applications
due later this month and law school applications
being reviewed on a rolling basis, it's crunch time
for seniors deciding whether to apply to graduate
and professional schools or to go straight into the
job market. And with the economy in shambles,
this decision is more difficult than it has been in
better times.
"I think the economic situation has definitely
affected my plans a little bit," said Victoria
Harman '09. "Although I'm still going to all the
same recruiting events and info sessions that I
would have before, I'm noticing that students who
would have normally gone [only] to the invest
ment banking route are attending the same
events."
In response to the potential scarcity of invest
ment banking jobs and the subsequent increase in
applicants for jobs in other areas, seniors may
apply in greater numbers to graduate programs
and professional schools, hinted University offi
cials involved in the process.
Pre law advisor Kathy Wright said economic

downturns traditionally result in an increase in law
school applicants. According to Wright, about 330
Stanford students and alumni have applied to law
school each year during the past five years.
She expects to see this number increase in the
coming year.
"When the economy takes a downward turn,
the trend has been for applications to law, business
and other graduate schools to increase," Wright
said in an email to The Daily. "I do expect that
number to increase at least slightly if there is a
recession, as the job market tightens."
Judith Romero, associate director of media
relations at Stanford Law School, echoed Wright.
"We expect to see some increase, although it is
still too early in the process to know for sure,"
Romero said.
Though graduate schools will not know for sev
eral months whether or not their applicant pools
will increase, seniors seem to be living up to these
predictions by applying in greater numbers.
"I am starting to think about applying to co
term or getting a master's in Latin American
Studies as another option, because the chances are
higher than normal that 1 might not be able to find
a job for next year," Harman said. "This would
involve new things to think about â€” taking the
GRE, [getting] funding for an M.A. in addition to
law school."
Jason Richman '09 said prolonging education is

one way seniors are
hoping to avoid the
tighter job market.
"I do think a lot
of people are apply-
ing to graduate
schools and hop-
ing the economy
will turn up by

the time they get out," he said.
Still, not all seniors have been spending the last
month studying for the LSAT and GRE. Whitney
Ping '09 said that a year ago she had wanted to go
to law school, but changed her mind, even despite
the unstable economy.
At least for now, seniors seem to be looking at
the future with cautious interest and optimism,
keeping options open by considering both gradu
ate schools and jobs.
"It's going to be very interesting," Richman
said, "and the outcome of the presidential election
will make the whole situation more interesting."
