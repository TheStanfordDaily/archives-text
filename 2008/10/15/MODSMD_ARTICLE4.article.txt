## Senate rejects paying for Prop. 8 T-shirts Jewish Queers makes $4,000 funding gaffe 
### MARISA LANDICHO 
The Undergraduate Senate spent
the better part of last night's meeting
arguing over the precise definition of
the word "t-shirt" in a two-hour-long
meeting strikingly similar to the
Senate's meeting two weeks ago in
which funding for a $2,800 barbecue
dominated debate.
The impromptu senate debate
over the distinction between a uni
form and a shirt came about as the
Student Coalition for Marriage
Equality (SCME) attempted to justi
fy their $4,000 expenditure on anti-
Proposition 8 shirts to a largely
unmoved Senate — in a roll call vote,
only two senators voted to reimburse
the purchase of the shirts.

The pervasive purple shirts, featur
ing a straight couple in commutative
equality with two same-sex couples,
were purchased by the Jewish Queers
(JQ) using money that was originally
budgeted tor events and food. Passed
out for free among the student body,
the shirts have become a common
sight throughout the campus.
Proposition 8 is a proposal to ban
gay marriage in the state of
California.
While supportive of the sentiment,
the Senate Appropriations
Committee was reluctant to fund the
politicized shirts because the JQ
budget modification request had
never been approved.
"The problem that we're having is
with the idea that the money was
changed from one thing to complete
ly another," said Senator Yvorn
"Doc" Aswad-Thomas 4 11. "It feels to
us that there was something misrep
resented."
While every group has a hard cap
of $7.5(X) for the year, the Senate was
particularly inflamed over the usage
of school funds to spread a political
message, namely because the money
was supposed to he used for food and
operating costs. The difference
sparked one of many referrals back
to the Constitution as the Senate
tried to figure out the interpretation
of its own charter.
Through a misunderstanding with
Senator Luukas lives '09 (who. at the
meeting, denied ever saying any
thing), the JO ordered and paid for
the shirts on the assumption that
while the ASSU wouldn't fund ideo
logical statements, it would pay for
the shirts under the category of cos
tumes and uniforms.
A representative of the SCME,
who only identified herself as Jamie
to keep her sexual orientation pri
vate, argued that the shirts, like uni
forms. were as much a self-identifying
force as the costumes of dancers or
performers.
"When you go around to Stanford
students and you ask any gay person
how it makes them feel to see people
walking around wearing these purple
shirts, they say it makes them feel
safer knowing people are identifying
as allies," Jamie said. "Freshmen say
they feel more comfortable coming
out to their dorm and to the Stanford
community."
Before Jamie even finished her
proposal, the skepticism in the room
was evident — Senator Patrick
Cordova '09 broke into laughter as he
listened to her argument. What fol
lowed was 30 minutes of discussion
on the nature of uniforms.
The Senate defined uniforms as
reusable, restricted to discreet mem -
bership. and tracked so as to be
returned at the end of the year.
"1 don't believe [the shirts are| a
uniform," said Senator Orr Keshet
'09. "If it wasn't general, then maybe
it could be used for only members of
the group. Now you are asking for
$4,000. then won't other groups say,
'We want shirts too'?"
Hie general consensus was that
the shirts were for publicity and that
the $4,000 cost was in no way equiva
lent to other groups' costume alloca
tions.
Ilie line item finally forced the
meeting to a recess, during which the
Appropriations Committee defeated
the original budget modification with
a 5-1 vote. Although Cordova
motioned for a roll call to override
the committee's decision, only one
other senator voted in favor of reim
bursing the JO- The JO will now have
to fundraise to make up for the
deficit.

Proposition 8 was the theme of the
night, as the first item on the agenda
also dealt with whether or not to
endorse the anti-Proposition 8 move
ment. The Senate considered passing
a resolution to formally oppose the
proposition that would ban gay mar
riage.
"I think the real reason for doing
this particular bill is because we're
trying to acknowledge this is on par
with every other civil rights issue that
we've come up against," Ashwad
'lTiomas said. "I mean, the very first
sentence is 'to eliminate the right.'"
Senator Stuart Baimel '09 was
adamant that the Senate not open
itself up to addressing every political
issue on the campus.
"1 do not think it's appropriate for

you to use the language of the funda
mental standard to supporfc-u political
statement," Baimel said. ' I think
many conservative students would
not feel the same way."
Baimel later threatened to intro
duce a resolution against Proposition
4, which restricts abortion rights, if
every political issue became fair
game.
Cautious of becoming partisan,
the Senate tabled the resolution until
the language was revised and specific
actions were clarified. Although the
Senate appeared overwhelmingly
against Proposition 8. most senators
were hesitant to pass a full resolution
without careful review.
The Senate also heard a proposal
by Matt Winterbourne '11 to expand

and improve public swimming hours,
and members offered their full sup
port.
