N. Korea allows UN monitors to main
nuclear site
North Korea allowed United Nations monitors
back into their main nuclear site Tuesday, but it was
unclear whether they had fulfilled a pledge to resume
disabling the facilities in line with a six-nation deal.
A diplomat in Vienna familiar with the Interna
tional Atomic Energy Agency's work at the site said
the agency's 3-member team had resumed monitor
ing the site, including reapplying seals the North had
ordered taken off and remounting lAEA cameras.
He demanded anonymity because he was not author
ized to discuss the issue publicly.
Two months ago. North Korea stopped disabling
the Yongbyon nuclear facility in anger over U.S. de
mands that Pyongyang accept a plan to verify its ac
counting of nuclear programs as a condition for re
moval from a blacklist of countries accused of spon
soring terrorism.
Until late last week, the North had threatened to
reactivate the plutonium reprocessing plant at Yong
byon.
Clinton doesn't see a political role beyond
Senate
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton puts the chances of
her running for president again at near zero — slight
ly higher than the chances she gives for becoming
Senate majority leader or a Supreme Court justice.
In an interview aired Tuesday on "Fox & Friends"
on the Fox News Channel. Clinton, D-N.Y., was asked
the chances, on a scale of 1 to 10, that she would be the
next majority leader in the Senate.
"Oh, probably zero," she said."l'm not seeking any
other position than to be the best senator from New
York that I can be."
Being nominated to the Supreme Court?
"Zero," Clinton said. "I have no interest in doing
that."
Running for president again?
"Probably close to zero." she said. "There's an old
saying: Bloom where you're planted."
Appeals court considers overturning
tobacco case
A federal appeals court appeared skeptical Tiles
day that a landmark tobacco judgment could be sup
ported under racketeering laws, questioning whether
cigarette makers had conspired to hide the dangers of
smoking and would continue deceiving the public.
During the three-hour oral argument, all three
judges on the appeals panel queried whether the
2006 ruling by U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler had
fully laid out the evidence showing a group conspir
acy as required under RICO, a law designed to com
bat mobsters and other organized criminals.
On several occasions,government attorneys seek
ing to convince the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Cir
cuit to sign off on billions in financial penalties
against the industry allowed that Kessler's 1,653-
page ruling might not have spelled out the racketeer
ing violations, or the remedies, as clearly as it should.
"We're asking the judge's order be enforced
based on what the court meant," Justice Department
lawyer Mark Stern said. He spoke after attorneys for
the tobacco industry criticized Kessler's ruling as
"cobbling" together statements by cigarette makers
that failed to "connect the dots" showing fraud.
Bush to help open national parks to
mountain bikes
The Bush administration plans to make it easier
for mountain bikers to gain access to national parks
and other public lands before the president — an
avid cyclist himself — leaves office.
The National Park Service confirmed Tliesday that
it is preparing a rule that will allow decisions about
some mountain bike trails to be made by park man
agers instead of federal regulators in Washington, a
process that can take years.
A park service spokesman said the rule would be
proposed no later than Nov. 15 so it could be final be
fore Bush leaves office.
