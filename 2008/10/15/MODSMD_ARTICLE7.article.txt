# McCain, Obama seek leader's image in final head-to-head showdown
## Candidates set for tonight's debate 
### LIZ SIDOTI THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Barack Obama and John McCain will
both pursue the image of a strong leader in
troublesome economic times as they meet
Wednesday night for their third and final
presidential debate.
Their face-off comes as Obama widens
his lead in typically Democratic states and
campaigns with an air of optimism about
his prospects, while McCain seeks a way to

gain ground and finds himself defending
traditionally Republican states with less
than three weeks left in the race.
"We cannot spend the next four years
as we have spent much of the last eight:
waiting for our luck to change .... As
president I intend to act, quickly and deci
sively," McCain said Tbesday in battle
ground Pennsylvania. There, he unveiled
new economic proposals and previewed a
possible debate strategy: argue that he
would be different from Bush and better

than Obama.
One day earlier in swing state Ohio,
Obama outlined his own economic plan
and showed off his own pitch. He suggest
ed that McCain was more of the same and
that putting a Democrat in charge was the
only way to fix the economy's woes: "It will
take a new direction. It will take new lead
ership in Washington. It will take a real
change in the policies and politics of the
last eight years."
The economic crisis has transformed

the campaign over the past month. Obama
has built leads nationally and in key states
as the turmoil has returned the nation's
focus to the unpopular Bush's policies.
Now, the burden is on McCain to try to re
verse his slide.
Wednesday's debate at Hofstra Uni
versity in Hempstead, N.Y., is slated to
focus entirely on the economy and domes
tic policy. The candidates will be seated at
a table with moderator Bob Schieffer of
CBS.
Both presidential contenders have used
the previous debates to make and remake
their main campaign points, frequently
sidestepping direct questions such as how
they would have to scale back their long
lists of campaign promises in light of the
economic crisis.
Advisers for each candidate say he will
use the final debate to lay out his vision for
the country and promote his economic
policies while drawing differences with his
opponent.
Character attacks — subtle or not —
also could occur.
Obama has increasingly labeled Mc-
Cain "erratic" and "lurching" during the
economic crisis. The words suggest un
steadiness on the part of the 72-year-old
four-term senator.
The Democrat's campaign released a
pre-debate memo Tuesday that argued
McCain was "ill-equipped" to lead during
this crisis, saying his response "has ca
reened, sometimes changing course within
the span of a single day."
McCain has accused Obama of lying
about his association with 1960s radical
William Ayers, a founder of the violent
anti-war group Weather Underground.
Obama was 8 years old when the Weather
Underground claimed responsibility for a
series of bombings. Now a professor in
Chicago. Ayers hosted a meet-the-candi
date session at his home for Obama as he
prepared to run for the state Senate. Later,
the two worked with the same charity and
social-service organizations in Chicago.
