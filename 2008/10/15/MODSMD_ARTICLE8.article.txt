# Flames hit San Fernando Valley
## Fires burn in north Los Angeles 
### THOMAS WATKINS THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Flames whirled dangerously close to homes Tuesday as
gusty Santa Ana winds sent the biggest of southern Cali
fornia's wildfires flaring in hilly brushlands on Los Ange
les' northern edge and along subdivisions to the west.
Firefighters with hoses guarded houses as helicopters
unleashed loads of water on hot spots of the more than 20-
square-mile blaze charring slopes above the San Fernando
Valley communities of Porter Ranch and Granada Hills.
Flames then pushed west to the rolling grasslands of
Ventura County and made runs toward Simi Valley neigh
borhoods.
The fire is one of three major blazes that have burned
more than 34 square miles of Southern California, de
stroyed dozens of homes and forced thousands of people
to evacuate their homes this week. One man died in the
flames, and a motorist was killed in a crash as a fire neared
a freeway.
Fifteen homes and 47 outbuildings were destroyed in
the Porter Ranch area, and another six homes were dam
aged. said Los Angeles County fire Inspector Ron Haral
son.
A 7.5-square-mile blaze in the northeastern San Fer
nando Valley was 80 percent contained and some evacuees
were allowed to go home. But people who lived in an area
where 38 mobile homes were destroyed were not permit
ted to return.
