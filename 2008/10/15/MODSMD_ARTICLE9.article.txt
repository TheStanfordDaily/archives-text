# Stocks pull back as profits set in
## Wall Street calms in light of bailout plan 
### TIM PARADIS THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Wall Street ended a relatively
calm session with a moderate loss
Tliesday as investors, while happy
with the government's plans to
spend up to $250 billion to buy stock
in private banks, decided to cash in
profits from the previous day's mas
sive advance as they refocused their
attention on the economy.
It was the first time in nine ses
sions that the Dow Jones industrial
average didn't close with triple
digit losses or gains although it did
swing in a 700-point range. The
Dow closed down 76 points a day
after its record 936-point jump.
Big advances by many bank
stocks helped offset some of the de
clines in the Dow and the Standard
& Poor's 500 index, giving them a
better showing for the day than the
Nasdaq composite index, which fell
more than 3 percent. The technolo
gy-dominated Nasdaq also lagged
ahead of a profit report from Intel
Corp., as investors were reminded
of the troubled economy and its im
pact on corporate earnings.
Profit-taking set in after the Dow
surged more than 400 points at the
opening. Wall Street is expected to
see jittery trading in the weeks and
perhaps months ahead because of
worries about the economy; stocks

also tend to ratchet up and down
when they're recovering from a
plunge like the one Wall Street has
suffered in the past two weeks.
"We don't know if the bottom is
in," said Lincoln Anderson, chief in
vestment officer and chief econo
mist at LPL Financial, referring to
the market's advance Monday after
huge losses last week. "We certainly
expect heightened volatility for a
fair amount of time while we sort
out just exactly what's going on."
Investors had snapped up stocks
Monday in anticipation of the gov
ernment's plan. President Bush
said Tuesday the government
would use a portion of the $700 bil
lion financial bailout passed at the
start of the month to inject capital
into the nation's major banks,
which have been slammed by sour
ing mortgage investments. The
move follows a similar one an
nounced Monday by European
governments to invest about $2 tril
lion in their own troubled banks.
The revised bailout plan differs
from the original in that it aims to
recapitalize banks, not just buy the
troubled assets off their books at
prices that could leave the banks
with losses.
"This begins to penetrate the
core of the problem," said Peter
Cardillo, chief market economist at
New York-based brokerage house
Avalon Partners Inc.
Robert Dye, senior economist at
PNC Financial Services Group,said
the government's actions likely will
help revive the credit markets, but
now that the plan is place, investors

are shifting back to concerns about
the economy.
"These steps are not going to turn
the real economy on a dime," he said
of the government intervention.
"The two keys to the fundamental
economy right now are the job mar
ket and the housing market and both
of those remain distressed."
"There isn't one bottom here.
We're talking about multiple
events. There will be a bottom in fi
nancial market and another in the
labor market and one in the hous
ing market. And they're not going
to all line up," Dye said.
The Dow fell 76.62, or 0.82 per
cent, to 9,310.99.
Broader stock indicators also
declined. The S&P 500 index fell
5.34, or 0.53 percent, to 998.01, and
the Nasdaq fell 65.24, or 3.54 per
cent, to 1.779.01.
The Russell 20(H) index of small
er companies, including many tech
concerns, fell 16.24, or 2.84 percent,
to 554.65.
Though the major indexes
showed losses, advancing issues
outnumbered decliners by about 9
to 7 on the New York Stock Ex
change, where consolidated vol
ume came to 7.97 billion shares,
compared with 7.1 billion shares
traded Monday.
Ryan Detrick. senior technical
strategist at Schaeffer's Investment
Research, said investors pleased
about the government's plan gravi
tated toward industrial companies,
seeing them as more likely to bene
fit from a revived credit market
than tech companies.
