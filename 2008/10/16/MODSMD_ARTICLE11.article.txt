## McCain, Obama have final debate 
### BETH FOUHY ASSOCIATED PRESS 
HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. â€” John
McCain repeatedly assailed Barack
Obama's character and campaign
positions on taxes, abortion and
more Wednesday night, hoping to
transform their final presidential
debate into a launching pad for a
political comeback. "You didn't tell
the American people the truth."he
charged.
Unruffled, and ahead in the polls,
Obama parried each accusation, and
leveled a few of his own.
One hundred percent. John, of
your ads. 100 percent of them have
been negative," Obama shot back in
an uncommonly personal debate
less than three weeks from Election
Day.
"It's not true," McCain retorted.
"It absolutely is true," said
Obama, seeking the last word.
McCain is currently running all
negative ads, according to a study
by the University of Wisconsin-

Madison. But he has run a number
of positive ads during the campaign.
The W-minute encounter, seated
at a round table at Hofstra
University, was their third debate,
and marked the beginning of a 20-
day sprint to Election Day. Obama
leads in the national polls and in sur
veys in many battleground states, an
advantage built in the weeks since
the nation stumbled into the greatest
economic crisis since the Great
Depression.
With few exceptions, the cam
paign is being waged in states that
voted Republican in 2004 - Virginia.
Colorado. lowa - and in many of
them. Obama holds a lead in the
polls.
McCain played the aggressor
from the opening moments of the
debate, accusing Obama of waging
class warfare by seeking tax increas
es that would "spread the wealth
around."
The Arizona senator also
demanded to know the full extent of
Obama's relationship with William

Ayers, a 19605-era terrorist and the
Democrat's ties with ACORN, a lib
eral group accused of violating fed
eral law as it seeks to register voters.
And he insisted Obama disavow last
week's remarks by Rep. John Lewis,
a Democrat, who accused the
Republican ticket of playing racial
politics along the same lines as segre
gationists of the past.
Struggling to escape the political
drag of an unpopular Republican
incumbent. McCain also said. "Sen.
Obama. I am not President Bush. ...
You wanted to run against President
Bush, you should have run four years
ago."
Obama returned each volley, and
brushed aside McCain's claim to full
political independence.
"If I've occasionally mistaken
your policies for George Bush's poli
cies, it's because on the core eco
nomic issues that matter to the
American people - on tax policy, on
energy policy, on spending priorities
- you have been a vigorous support
er of President Bush." he said.
