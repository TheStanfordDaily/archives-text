## Editorial Commencement speaker selection needs more transparency 
### 
Speculation regarding the identity of the
annual Commencement speaker begins
early each fall, but most students are rel
atively unaware as to how that speaker is cho
sen. In the past, less recognizable speakers
have been chosen to the dismay of members
of the senior class, many of whom felt left out
of the loop.
The editorial board realizes that many stu
dents find the speaker selection process
somewhat opaque, and believes the adminis
tration can better clarify how a speaker is
chosen to appease frustrated students. We
also hope this editorial is a step towards ac
complishing that goal.
Many students believe that the senior
class presidents are responsible for the selec
tion of a commencement speaker. In reality,
the President's Office is largely in control of
the process, with the class presidents serving
simply to relay student attitudes. Though the
class presidents may submit suggestions and
offer feedback, the President's Office may ul
timately suggest and choose a candidate not
on any original short list submitted by the
senior class presidents. The editorial board
believes that knowledge about how the
speaker is selected should be more readily
available to many students.
According to Jeff Wachtel, senior assistant
to the president, the selection process is kept
relatively quiet to avoid disappointing stu
dents and insulting speakers who may be a
lower-ranked choice. We believe this decision
makes sense, but there is no harm in publiciz
ing how a speaker is selected while keeping
quiet who exactly is being asked.The Univer
sity is by no means keeping this aspect a de
liberate secret and openly explained how a
speaker is chosen to The Daily. If more stu
dents knew how the speaker selection
worked, perhaps fewer would be frustrated
with the senior class presidents and the Uni
versity for not selecting their top choice.
Wachtel also told The Daily that the Pres
ident s Office wants to please students and
choose a popular speaker, but the selection
process is long and difficult. Sometimes, it
even begins over the summer, as some pro
posed speakers do turn the opportunity
down. Wachtel pointed out that Stanford
does not offer honorary degrees or pay sums
larger than a few thousand dollars plus trans
portation costs to solicit speakers. The Uni
versity also aims to find a speaker with a Stan
ford connection, so he or she can speak to

graduates in a more meaningful way.
The editorial board supports Stanford's
decision to uphold certain standards in select
ing a speaker, such as refusing to give out hon
orary degrees. This sets us apart from our
peers. Finding a speaker with some kind of
Stanford connection is also admirable. How
ever, the editorial board believes that if the
University is unable to nab a speaker who is
both Stanford-related and exciting to the sen
iors, the University should make the student
body's excitement a priority over the Stan
ford connection.
The concern about student input and pref
erence has become one of the most contro
versial aspects of speaker selection, evi
denced by the outcry from students who had
never heard of Dana Gioia, Stanford's com
mencement speaker in 2007.
Last year, the senior class presidents de
cided not to formally gather input from stu
dents. According to Fareez Giga '08, the
group was worried about putting out a survey
in fear that seniors would react negatively if
their top choice was not selected. They in
stead relied on more informal dialogues. Jor
dan Goldberg '09, currently a senior class
president, said that the President's Office rec
ommended the presidents take the same ap
proach this year in fear of potential disap
pointment.
These decisions make sense in light of the
larger context of the speaker selection
process, in particular the class presidents' rel
ative lack of power, the emphasis on finding
someone with a Stanford connection and the
likelihood of top choices turning Stanford
down. But we do believe student input should
matter. Perhaps if more students were clear
on the speaker selection process, the Univer
sity could worry less about the ramifications
of disappointing students.
Finding a speaker who can excite the sen
ior class and give a meaningful address is a
key goal of both the administration and the
senior class presidents. The editorial board
understands that selecting a speaker can be
challenging, but we hope Stanford can make
use of its vast amount of connections and re
sources to achieve that goal this year. This
should be the University's number one prior
ity in selecting a speaker. Surely, some stu
dents will be disappointed with any choice,
and for that reason we hope the University
will be as communicative as possible about
how the process works.
