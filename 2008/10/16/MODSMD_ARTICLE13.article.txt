# The 						Economics of...
## The 						economics of giving back to your school 
### 
Like the rest of the Class of 20()9,1
recently received a letter from
the Stanford Alumni Association
asking me to start making donations to
the University. After reading the letter,
I decided to calculate the tax benefit I
might receive were I to make a dona
tion. Then I realized that with no in
come. no job prospects and a flounder
ing stock portfolio, I was already doing
more than enough to avoid paying taxes
for a long time.
Taxes aside, there are several eco
nomic arguments for giving some of
your all-too-hard-earned money back to
Stanford.
First off, an education from Stanford
— or any other elite university for that
matter — is highly subsidized. Imagine if
a Stanford education was priced on the
free market like other goods and servic
es in the economy. How much would
families be willing to pay? The answer is
far, far more than the current tuition cost
of $ 12,010 per quarter.
Now I understand that this method
of reasoning doesn't quite make sense.
The quality and diversity of students at
Stanford is the most valuable compo
nent of a Stanford education and a free
market approach mitigates both quality
and diversity by using wealth as the only
criteria for admission. Despite this draw
back, we could set minimum require
ments that must be met to enter the mar
ket, after which admission to Stanford
could be auctioned off to those who
qualified. Such a system would still value
a Stanford degree at significantly more
than the current tuition cost.
Alternatively, we could look at the
subsidy from a cost perspective. In 2(X)7,
Stanford totaled $2.9 billion in operating
expenses, only 79 percent of which was
covered by the University's revenues.
The University had to draw on its en

dowment to pay the remaining 21 per
cent, a situation that could have been
avoided if tuition fees were higher. In re
ality, the subsidy is even greater than 21
percent — tuition fees only make up
part of the University's revenues.
Whichever way you look at it,you are
getting a discount on your education,
and you should pay the University back
when you have the resources. This is true
even if you receive financial aid through
grants and student loans.
Those grants and loans go towards
paying the subsidized tuition costs. The
unsubsidized costs would be substantial
ly higher, so the University is saving you
from taking on more debt or applying
for more grants.
Even if you find this argument con
vincing, it might not compel you to write
a check. Giving money back to your
school would be the honorable thing to
do, but what's honor worth when you
want that gargantuan flat screen TV?
You're going to need something
more than honor to convince you to give
money back to your school.
Consider this incentive: Your earning
power over your working life is greatly
influenced by the quality and prestige of
the institution at which you study. Your
Stanford degree opens doors for you. It
helps you get the highest-paying jobs out
of college, admission to the best gradu
ate schools and connections to a power
ful alumni network.
These benefits are contingent upon

Stanford remaining at the top of the
higher education totem pole. In turn,
Stanford's place in the upper echelons of
academia is contingent on its financial
muscle. It is no coincidence that the best
universities in the world are also the
most heavily endowed.The larger a uni
versity's war chest, the more money it
can invest in research opportunities, top
notch faculty members and unique
classes.
If donations to Stanford lag behind
those given to its peer institutions —
which, unfortunately, is currently the
case — then Stanford's endowment will
not keep pace with that of its peers. Over
time, the University will fall behind, and
the perceived quality and prestige of a
Stanford degree will decline.
A fall in the value attached to a Stan
ford degree translates to a fall in your
earning power. You'll make less money
because you didn't give enough of what
you had back to the University.
This may sound paradoxical, but it's
true. Giving back to Stanford benefits
us by preserving the value of the educa
tion we receive. If we give enough, it
might even raise the value of a Stanford
education. The scores of alumni who
visited campus during Reunion Home
coming this past weekend are evidence
of this. All weekend, they could be seen
walking around campus in disbelief,
saying, "We would never get in here
today."
Lets make sure we're saying the
same thing when we're back for our re
unions, 20 years down the road.

ford Fund found these arguments con
vincing and would he interested in em
