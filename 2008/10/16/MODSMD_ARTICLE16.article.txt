I am concerned hy Ms. Landicho's characterization of my
laughter in response to a presentation hy the Jewish Queers at
the Oct. 14 Senate meeting [see the Oct. 15 Daily story,"Senate
rejects paying for Prop.B T-shirts"]. I very much agree with the
components of the organization's argument for funds. It was
this belief that led to my vote in favor of funding for the organ
ization. While I (not alone among other senators) did laugh at
one aspect of the argument, I feel as if suggesting that my treat
ment of the issues as a mere joke is inappropriate.
