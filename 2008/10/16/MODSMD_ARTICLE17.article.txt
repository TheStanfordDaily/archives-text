## Fear of broad economic fall causes mass stock sell-off 
### JEANNINE AVERSA 
WASHINGTON â€” Fear and
loathing is spreading as signs
mount that the economy is in dan
ger of losing its balance.
And a fresh batch of economic
reports due out Thursday is likely
to show more problems for the
already stumbling economy.
Industrial production is expect
ed to have dropped in September,
underscoring the plight of troubled
auto makers as well as manufactur
ers of furniture, construction mate
rials and other goods that have
been hard hit by the collapse of the
housing market.
The number of new people sign
ing up for unemployment benefits
last week may dip slightly but is

still expected to top 400,000, a level
that usually points to an ailing
labor market.
Consumer prices probably will
nudge up in September, but will be
up sharply over the past year, fur
ther pinching Americans already
smarting from dwindling nest eggs
and sinking home values.
"Given the likely drawn-out
nature of the prospective adjust
ments in housing and financial
markets, I see the most probable
scenario as one in which the per
formance of the economy remains
subpar well into next year and then
gradually improves in late 2009 and
2010," Donald Kohn, vice chairman
of the Federal Reserve, concluded
Wednesday evening.
Worries about the economy sent

the Dow Jones industrials down a
staggering 733 points earlier
Wednesday, erasing any hopes that
the convulsions that have shaken
Wall Street for a month were over.
The selling spree carried over to
Asia, where stocks fell sharply in
early trading Thursday. Japan's key
stock index plummeted more than
10 percent, South Korean shares
shed 7 percent, while in Hong
Kong, the Hang Seng Index was
down 6 percent.
The plunge in stocks put the
nation's economic anxiety front
and-center as the two major presi
dential candidates, Sens. Barack
Obama and John McCain, squared
off in their final debate Wednesday
night in Hempstead, N.Y.
McCain used the debate to

accuse Obama of waging class war
fare by advocating tax increases
designed to "spread the wealth
around." The Democrat denied it,
and countered that he favors tax
reductions for 95 percent of all
Americans.
Wednesday's daylong stock mar
ket sell-off came as retailers report
ed the biggest drop in sales in three
years and as a Federal Reserve
snapshot showed Americans are
spending less and manufacturing is
slowing around the country.
Piling up losses in a rough final
hour of trading, the Dow ended the
day down nearly 8 percent - its
steepest drop since one week after
Black Monday in 1987. The Dow
has wiped out all but about 127
points of its record-shattering 936-

point gain on Monday of this week.
Earlier this week, after govern
ments around the world
announced plans to use trillions of
dollars to prop up banks, including
a U.S. plan to buy about $250 bil
lion in bank stocks, the market had
appeared to be turning around - or
at least calming down.
Instead, relentless selling gave
the Dow its 20th triple-digit swing
in the past 23 trading sessions, an
unprecedented run of volatility.
The Dow has finished higher on
only one day this month. The loss
of 733 points is the second-worst
ever for the average, topped only
by a 778-point decline Sept. 29.
Treasury Secretary Henry
Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben
Bernanke have expressed confi
dence that the government's radical
efforts to stabilize the financial sys
tem and induce banks to lend again
will eventually help the economy.
But Bernanke warned that even
if the financial markets level off.
the nation will not snap back to
economic health quickly.
"Stabilization of the financial
markets is a critical first step, but
even if they stabilize as we hope
they will, broader economic recov
ery will not happen right away,"
Bernanke told the Economic Club
of New York on Wednesday. He
left the door open to further inter
est rate reductions.
President Bush plans to speak
on the financial crisis early Friday -
before the markets open - at the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce head
quarters across from the White
House. Officials said the speech
wasn't intended to put forward
new policy actions, but rather
would be used by the president to
give the nation a more detailed
explanation of what the govern
ment is doing - and why - to com
bat the crisis.
Some analysts believe the econ
omy jolted into reverse in the
recently ended third quarter, while
others predict it will shrink later
this year or early next. The classic
definition of a recession is back-to
back quarters of shrinking eco
nomic activity.
