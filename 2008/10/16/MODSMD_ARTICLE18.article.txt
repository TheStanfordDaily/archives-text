## Stanford and Cal battle for bragging rights, Pac-10 lead BIG SPIKE GETS BIGGER 
### DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's volleyball team has
been nearly unstoppable as of late.The players
have won 11 straight matches and have swept
to victory in 10 of them. They have started the
Pacific-10 Conference schedule a perfect 6-0
and have swept every one of those opponents
for the first time in program history.
But as much as it has been easy-going for
the No. 4 Cardinal, the team is about to meet
its toughest match yet. On Sunday Stanford
will face off against rival California for the first
time this season.
This game is usually big because of the tra
ditional rivalry, dubbed the Big Spike. But this
Sunday's matchup has a little more juice to it:
Stanford and Cal are both undefeated in the
Pac-10 and Cal is ranked just one spot behind
the Cardinal.checking in at N0.5 in the nation.
Needless to say, the match promises to be a
great one, but don't expect Stanford's players
to over-emphasize the rivalry matchup as
something more than just another game.
"When they are
in their system, they
are a very strong
team"
— FOLUKE AKINRADEWO,
senior middle blocker
"We prepare hard for every match," head
coach John Dunning said. "We go through the
same routine. We practice things we need to
practice, things they are good at, things we
could maybe capitalize on."
Stanford's defense has been superb in Pac
-10 play thus far.The Cardinal has held 10 of its
last 11 opponents under .200 hitting, and its
blocking has been great. Senior Foluke Akin
radewo had 12 blocks against Arizona State
last weekend, one of the best single-game
blocking performances ever by a Stanford
player.
"I have been working on blocking all sea
son," Akinradewo said, pointing out that
blocking has been one of the weaker parts of
her game.
Practice must have paid off. with a little
help from the opponent.
"It seemed iike they were always hitting
into me," she said.
Stanford's offense hasn't been too shabby,
either. Sophomore Alix Klineman and senior
Cynthia Barboza have been leading the

charge on the outsides with a combined 39
kills in the past two matches.The team's over
all hitting percentage so far is the highest it has
ever been in school history.
But the No. 5 Golden Bears feature their
own talent-filled squad that is no pushover.
They are 16-1 on the season, their lone loss
coming at the hands of then-No. 11 Minnesota
in Minneapolis.
"They keep improving." Akinradewo said.
"When they are in their svstem. thev are a verv

strong team."
Hie Bears are led by sophomore setter
Carli Lloyd, who sits atop the Pac-lOstat sheet
with nearly 12 assists per set. Junior outside
hitter Mindi Wiley is hitting .486 in Pac-10 play
with over two kills per set. Junior outside hit
ter Hana Cutura is the leader of the offense,
averaging over four kills per set. At 6-foot-4,
Cutura is a returning Ail-American that the
Cardinal cannot afford to take lightly. She has
the ability to pound kills through any defense

GAME NOTES" The Stanford volleyball team will take on
California on Sunday for the first Big Spike of the season.
The No. 4 Cardinal and No. 5 Bears will battle it out for
Pac-10 supremacy. Stanford is led by a trio of All-Ameri
cans in senior Foluke Akinradewo, senior Cynthia Bar
boza and sophomore Alix Klinernan. Cal features their
own All-American in junior outside hitter Hana Cutura.
that comes at her. She also is one of the best
servers in the Pac-10, smacking 23 aces so far
this season.
"[Cutura] hits a heavy ball." Dunning said.
The team has been working on digging very
hard kills this week to prepare for what she
will bring. Stanford will not be able to stop her
every time she gets the ball, but will do its best
to contain her.
"When she hits it. it's coming at you fast."
Dunning said.
The success of the Bears is due in part to
their proficient offense. They are third in the
nation in assists with an average of almost 14
assists per set. They also rank third in the na
tion in kills per set. with 15.They rank fourth
in the nation with a .324 hitting percentage
(Stanford is third in the nation at .331). Cali
fornia has won 29 straight sets (a school
record) and has also won 11 matches in a row.
The only thing holding the Bears back is their
record against Stanford — they have only
won five matches in 64 career tries.
Stanford will without a doubt be working
on strategy to take Cal out of their game, or
"comfort zone," as Dunning put it. 11c pointed
out that when it comes down to it. tough serv
ing and passing will be the keys to playing well
and leaving with a win.
"How well you ball control dictates so
much of what happens," he said.
So not only will the winner of this game
have temporary Bay Area bragging rights,
they will sit atop the Pac-10 standings and be
in the driver's seat for the Pac-10 title. With the
Pac-10 Conference as tight as it has been this
year, a one-game lead could be huge. It also
has potential NCAA seeding implications
when it comes to home-court advantage and
hosting.
"We should have no problem being moti
vated for this one." Dunning said.
The match starts at 12:30 p.m. on Sunday at
Maples Pavilion. If you can't make it to the
game.you can catch the action being televised

Senior Foluke Akinradewo had one of the best blocking performances in team history last week
end. She will need to build on that performance when No. 5 Cal comes to Maples Pavilon on
Sunday for the first edition of the Big Spike. The winner of the match will be leading the Pac-10.
The Stanford women's volleyball team has
been nearly unstoppable as of late.The players
have won 11 straight matches and have swept
to victory in 10 of them. They have started the
Pacific-10 Conference schedule a perfect 6-0
and have swept every one of those opponents
for the first time in program history.
But as much as it has been easy-going for
the No. 4 Cardinal, the team is about to meet
its toughest match yet. On Sunday Stanford
will face off against rival California for the first
time this season.
This game is usually big because of the tra
ditional rivalry, dubbed the Big Spike. But this
Sunday's matchup has a little more juice to it:
Stanford and Cal are both undefeated in the
Pac-10 and Cal is ranked just one spot behind
the Cardinal.checking in at N0.5 in the nation.
Needless to say, the match promises to be a
great one, but don't expect Stanford's players
to over-emphasize the rivalry matchup as
something more than just another game.
"When they are
in their system, they
are a very strong
team"
— FOLUKE AKINRADEWO,
senior middle blocker
"We prepare hard for every match," head
coach John Dunning said. "We go through the
same routine. We practice things we need to
practice, things they are good at, things we
could maybe capitalize on."
Stanford's defense has been superb in Pac
-10 play thus far.The Cardinal has held 10 of its
last 11 opponents under .200 hitting, and its
blocking has been great. Senior Foluke Akin
radewo had 12 blocks against Arizona State
last weekend, one of the best single-game
blocking performances ever by a Stanford
player.
"I have been working on blocking all sea
son," Akinradewo said, pointing out that
blocking has been one of the weaker parts of
her game.
Practice must have paid off. with a little
help from the opponent.
"It seemed iike they were always hitting
into me," she said.
Stanford's offense hasn't been too shabby,
either. Sophomore Alix Klineman and senior
Cynthia Barboza have been leading the

charge on the outsides with a combined 39
kills in the past two matches.The team's over
all hitting percentage so far is the highest it has
ever been in school history.
But the No. 5 Golden Bears feature their
own talent-filled squad that is no pushover.
They are 16-1 on the season, their lone loss
coming at the hands of then-No. 11 Minnesota
in Minneapolis.
"They keep improving." Akinradewo said.
"When they are in their svstem. thev are a verv

strong team."
Hie Bears are led by sophomore setter
Carli Lloyd, who sits atop the Pac-lOstat sheet
with nearly 12 assists per set. Junior outside
hitter Mindi Wiley is hitting .486 in Pac-10 play
with over two kills per set. Junior outside hit
ter Hana Cutura is the leader of the offense,
averaging over four kills per set. At 6-foot-4,
Cutura is a returning Ail-American that the
Cardinal cannot afford to take lightly. She has
the ability to pound kills through any defense

GAME NOTES" The Stanford volleyball team will take on
California on Sunday for the first Big Spike of the season.
The No. 4 Cardinal and No. 5 Bears will battle it out for
Pac-10 supremacy. Stanford is led by a trio of All-Ameri
cans in senior Foluke Akinradewo, senior Cynthia Bar
boza and sophomore Alix Klinernan. Cal features their
own All-American in junior outside hitter Hana Cutura.
that comes at her. She also is one of the best
servers in the Pac-10, smacking 23 aces so far
this season.
"[Cutura] hits a heavy ball." Dunning said.
The team has been working on digging very
hard kills this week to prepare for what she
will bring. Stanford will not be able to stop her
every time she gets the ball, but will do its best
to contain her.
"When she hits it. it's coming at you fast."
Dunning said.
The success of the Bears is due in part to
their proficient offense. They are third in the
nation in assists with an average of almost 14
assists per set. They also rank third in the na
tion in kills per set. with 15.They rank fourth
in the nation with a .324 hitting percentage
(Stanford is third in the nation at .331). Cali
fornia has won 29 straight sets (a school
record) and has also won 11 matches in a row.
The only thing holding the Bears back is their
record against Stanford — they have only
won five matches in 64 career tries.
Stanford will without a doubt be working
on strategy to take Cal out of their game, or
"comfort zone," as Dunning put it. 11c pointed
out that when it comes down to it. tough serv
ing and passing will be the keys to playing well
and leaving with a win.
"How well you ball control dictates so
much of what happens," he said.
So not only will the winner of this game
have temporary Bay Area bragging rights,
they will sit atop the Pac-10 standings and be
in the driver's seat for the Pac-10 title. With the
Pac-10 Conference as tight as it has been this
year, a one-game lead could be huge. It also
has potential NCAA seeding implications
when it comes to home-court advantage and
hosting.
"We should have no problem being moti
vated for this one." Dunning said.
The match starts at 12:30 p.m. on Sunday at
Maples Pavilion. If you can't make it to the
