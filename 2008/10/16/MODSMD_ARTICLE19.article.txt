# Men's golf takes third at PGA West
## Four Stanford golfers finish among top 15 individually 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
After displaying some of its best individ
ual performances this season, the No. 12
Stanford men's golf team finished third at
The Prestige at the PGA West Tournament
in La Quinta, Calif.
The Cardinal finished just eight strokes
behind co-host UC-Davis with an overall
15-over-par 879. TCU was the only school
to finish under par as a team, with a three
under-par 861, and won the tournament.
Four of Stanford's seven participating
golfers posted top-15 finishes, which helped
to boost the Cardinal. Sophomore Sihwan
Kim exhibited another sign of his high po
tential for this year,carding the most consis
tent performance on the team â€” a tie for
eighth with a total score of two-over-par
218.
"Lots of positives have come out of our
performance at The Prestige," said Stanford
head coach Conrad Ray. "We had quite an
impressive showing with four of our five
guys placing in the top 15.1 think the reason
why we didn't win is because TCU had a
fantastic final round, and we just didn't
have that one guy who scored really low to
rally around."
Both junior Joseph Bramlett and sopho
more Steve Ziegler finished in a tie for 11th
with an overall four-over-par score of 220.
In just his second tournament back from a
hiatus due to in jury, Bramlett was on fire for
the first and second round, which landed
him in a tie for fourth. Unfortunately,
Bramlett failed to overcome a double

bogey in the final round, which pushed him
down to the 11th spot in the rankings.
Ziegler had a rough start to the tourna
ment but fired a two-under-par score of 70
for the final round. He carded a grand total
of five birdies in the final round alone,
which was enough to boost him eight spots
up the individual ladder.
In his second collegiate golf tournament,
freshman David Chung concluded the tour
nament only one stroke behind his veteran
teammates, Bramlett and Ziegler. to take a
piece of the 15th spot in the individual com
petition. Chung posted a two-over 74 for
the first and second round and a one-over
73 to finish the tournament.
Rounding out the Cardinal team score
was senior Daniel Lim with a 16-over 232.
Senior Dodge Kemmer and junior Jordan
Cox competed as individuals not associated
with Stanford. Kemmer finished in a tie for
30th with an 11-over 227, while Cox fin
ished with a 20 over 2 56
"Everyone did well this tournament,"
Ray said. "The wind gave us some tough
conditions to work with, which also adds to
the list of reasons why we couldn't quite
pull it out. but all the guys should be com
mended on their work."
The Stanford men's golf team began the
fall season unranked; this didn't last for
long, however, after the Cardinal fired two
top-four finishes: fourth at the Fighting Illi
ni Invitational and now third at The Pres
tige. All returning golfers have at least ex
perienced the pressure of the NCAA Tour
nament with last year's runner-up finish
and the NCAA title two years ago.
Though the bulk of Stanford's talent is
young, many are seasoned and experienced
in high-pressure situations, which sets Stan
ford apart from the rest of the Pac-10. The
