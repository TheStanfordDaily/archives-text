# Univ. contributes $2.1 billion to local economies
## New study shows Stanford spent $3.8 billion in 2006, with $2.1 billion spent in San Mateo, Santa Clara counties 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
A new study released by an independent
consulting firm shows that Stanford, the
largest employer in Silicon Valley, made
$3.8 billion in direct expenditures in 2006,
more than $2.1 billion of which was spent
in the San Mateo and Santa Clara counties.
"Each year, Stanford brings in revenue
from a variety of local, national and inter
national sources, and expends those funds
largely in its local region." the report said.
"In 2006, Stanford received $4.5 billion in
revenue from around the world."

The $2.1 billion was spent primarily on
salaries and wages ($1.4 billion), goods and
services ($447 million) and construction
and capital equipment ($299 million).
Stanford employs more than 20.000 fac
ulty and staff, most of whom live in either
San Mateo County or Santa Clara County.
These figures demonstrate that
Stanford, known primarily as a top-tier
research university, also plays a significant
role as an employer and an economic stim
ulator.
"This study shows the enormous eco
nomic benefits for local communities from
this economic activity." wrote University

President John Hennessy in a letter includ
ed with the study. "In the operation of its
education and research programs — the
vital purpose for which the University
exists — Stanford is a large economic enti
ty involving millions of transactions and
the flow of funds in and out."
The 35-page report was put together by
the Saratoga-based Pacific Partners
Consulting Group and is an update to a
similar economic report released in 1995.
According to the study, one of the most
important aspects of Stanford's contribu
tion is its financial consistency throughout
the years.

"Stanford, with an average annual
growth rate of one percent since 1984.
including the addition of Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital [opened in 1991], has
remained a stable source of jobs for area
residents, even during the turbulent dot
com boom and bust." the report said.
Hie study also indicated that Stanford is
the largest employer in the Silicon Valley
area, well ahead of Cisco Systems and
AT&T.
The new study covers four Stanford
related entities: the University itself,
Stanford Hospital & Clinics, Lucile
Packard Children's Hospital and the SLAC

National Accelerator Laboratory.
Each hospital is an independent non
profit entity with its own board of directors.
In 2006, the hospitals alone spent a total of
$609 million in the San Mateo and Santa
Clara counties.
The report included an aerial view of the
8.180-acre campus, which straddles the two
counties, with 5.178 acres in Santa Clara
County and 3,002 acres in San Mateo
County.
In response to the report, local officials
agreed that Stanford was an extremely
important player in the local econ
omy.
"There's no doubt Stanford is an
important influence on anything
that goes on in the area," said Greg
Schmid. an economist and Palo
Alto City Council member, to the
Oakland Tribune. "There's the gen
eral economic impact, the direct
fiscal impact, environmental
impact, transportation impact. . .
My general notion is that Palo Alto
would not be Palo Alto without
Stanford."
Sandra Lonnquist, president of
the Palo Alto Chamber of
Commerce, emphasized a similar
sentiment to the Tribune.
"The University is a stellar
example of not just bringing busi
ness to town, but good business
practices," she said.
Less directly, Stanford consis
tently provides innovation for
growth in the fields of technology
and medicine. Numerous Silicon
Valley-based companies, including
Google. Yahoo! and Sun
Microsystems, were founded by
Stanford students.
"It's far more than money," said

David Orenstein. public relations
manager for the School of
Engineering. "It's about the culture
of combining great faculty and tal
ented students and giving them a
chance to be creative."
