# It's not all about the big guys

It's mid-October and baseball
fans everywhere are pinching
themselves to make sure that the
fact that the perennially bottom
feeding Tampa Bay Rays are sitting
just one victory away from a World
Series berth isn't a dream.
And if the Rays — who have
outscored Boston 31-15 in the
ALCS thus far —do clinch, who
better to face them in the World Se
ries than the Philadelphia Phillies?
Although most would disagree, the
Phillies are clearly a more "cursed"
team than the Cubs. They have won
just one World Series to the Cubs'
two. They had managed just 22 play
off victories in 125 years coming
into this year, and last season they
became the first sports team to ever
lose 10,000 games in history.
So unless Boston pulls off anoth
er unlikely run like they did last sea
son. this year's champion will be a
team that has had little to no post
season success in the memorable
lives of most Stanford students. And
that would be a good thinu for base
ball.
But while the baseball world
anxiously awaits the winner of this
year's Fall Classic, other leagues
around the country are just getting
into midseason.
Although very few pay attention
to it (because it occurs during the
heart of the playoffs), most baseball
fans are aware that the Arizona Fall
League for high-level prospects re
cently opened play. However, few
have even heard of another league
that had its opening day a few weeks
ago: Hawaiian Winter Baseball.
Hawaiian Winter Baseball, or
HWB. takes a selection of the top
players from the rookie leagues and
C'lass-A baseball in the U.S. and
combines them with some of the top
young talent from the Japanese and
Korean leagues to form four teams,
which run a one-and-a-half-month
season. 'I"he league is designed to
give young professional players a
chance to continue working on their
skills in the off-season.
Most baseball fans could care
less if the Waikiki Beach Boys beat
the West Oahu Canefires. especially
while the MI.B is just days away
from the World Series. But what is
important about HWB is not the
success of the teams, but the individ
ual prospects.
HWB is useful for the players to
continue in their development, but
it also gives MLB teams and fans
one more indicator of how close
these young men are to being ready
for the Majors. And Bay Area sports
fans should be particularly interest
ed in several athletes in HWB this
year.
Buster Posey, the former Florida
State Seminole, fifth overall pick
and "catcher of the future" for the
Giants, is hitting over .400 for the
Waikiki Beach Boys. Posey has put
up monster numbers for much of his
career and led the Seminoles to the
College World Series last year.
As a catcher for the Beach Boys,
Posey has had to catch for none
other than former Stanford ace Je
remy Bleich, who started for the
Cardinal in that CWS game against
FSIJ, pitching five innings and al
lowing one run. Bleich was taken h'y
the Yankees with the 44th overall
pick of last year's draft and, al
though winless in three starts in
Hawaii, has posted a 3.75 ERA.
Another former Stanford star,
slugger Michael Taylor, is in
Hawaii playing for the Honolulu
Sharks. Taylor was drafted by the
Phillies in 2007 and has struggled
for the Sharks, but batted .346 with
19 homeruns in Class-A ball this
season.
But perhaps the highest-profile
former Cardinal in HWB this year is
catcher Jason Castro, who was taken
10th overall by the Astros in last
year's draft. Castro led Stanford last
season in batting average, hits and
RBI and was second in homeruns
and runs scored. He has continued
his offensive production with the
North Shore Honu, leading the
team with a .361 average and second
with an on base percentage of .442.
