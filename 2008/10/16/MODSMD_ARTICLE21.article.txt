## MLB, Fox agree to delay World Series game for Obama 
### MEG JAMES THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Major League Baseball agreed
Wednesday to delay the start of a po
tential World Series game by about
15 minutes to make room for a televi
sion commercial that Democratic
presidential nominee Barack Obama
plans to run Oct. 29.
That would be the date for Game
6 of the best-of-seven series, if a sixth
game is necessary.
Obama's campaign earlier this

month negotiated to buy the same
half-hour of prime time — from 8 to
8:30 p.m. EST that night — on CBS
and NBC
The campaign also approached ABC
and Fox Broadcasting to purchase
that half-hour on those networks, but
Fox already had reserved that time
period for a pre-game show and
Game 6.
Fox asked Major League Baseball
to push the start time to at least 8:35
p.m. Eastern time so that Fox could
accommodate Obama's buy.The first

pitch of a World Series game typical
ly is thrown at 8:22 p.m. Eastern time.
The league agreed to make the
switch, and Fox sold the half hour to
Obama's campaign for just under $1
million.
"This is unprecedented in Ameri
can political and sports history," said
Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M.
Unruh Institute of Politics at the Uni
versity of Southern California. He
said the only thing that he could think
of that came close was an address by
President Bush a few days after the

terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2(X)1, a
nationally televised speech that
brought to a halt a National Hockey
League exhibition game.
"This just speaks to the tremen
dous level of public interest in this
campaign," Schnur said. "Even if
most candidates could afford to buy
this much time on the networks, they
would be afraid that they might not
be able to hold viewers' interest for
that long."
Fox issued a statement, saying:
"Fox will accommodate Senator
Obama's desire to communicate
with voters in this long-form format.
We are pleased that Major League
Baseball has agreed to delay the
first pitch of World Series Game 6
for a few minutes in order for Fox to
carry his program on Oct. 29. If re
quested, the network would be will
ing to make similar time available to
Senator McCain's campaign."
Representatives of the McCain
and Obama campaigns were not
available for comment Wednesday
night. However, the Republican
National Committee decried the
move.
"It's unfortunate that the World
Series' first pitch is being delayed
for Obama's political pitch. Not
only is Obama putting politics be
fore principle, he's putting it before
our national pastime," said Alex
Conant. an RNC spokesman.
Major League Baseball declined
to comment.

Not all viewers will see the
Obama ad before the World Series
game. In the Pacific and Mountain
time zones. Fox plans to run the
Obama program after the baseball
game. It would air before the game
in the Eastern and Central time
zones, which cover about 70 percent
of the nation's population.
Obama is the first presidential
candidate since Ross Perot 16 years
ago to make such a large network
TV buy. According to the Nielsen
Co., Perot ran a series of political
telecasts that year. One half-hour
simulcast, carried by ABC and CBS
on Nov. 2, 1992, drew 26 million
viewers, Nielsen said.
This month, CBS negotiated to
sell Obama its half hour Oct. 29. the
Wednesday before the Nov. 4 elec
tion, for $% 1,000. NBC sold its half
hour that night to the Democratic
nominee for $891,250. Networks
must provide political candidates
time at reduced rates.
Obama is orchestrating what TV
industry executives call a "road
block" by buying the same time peri
od on all the major TV networks so
viewers flipping around would stop
to watch the program because it was
carried on so many stations.
