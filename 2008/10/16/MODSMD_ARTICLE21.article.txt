## MLB, Fox agree to delay World Series game for Obama 
### MEG JAMES THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Major League Baseball agreed
Wednesday to delay the start of a po
tential World Series game by about
15 minutes to make room for a televi
sion commercial that Democratic
presidential nominee Barack Obama
plans to run Oct. 29.
That would be the date for Game
6 of the best-of-seven series, if a sixth
game is necessary.
Obama's campaign earlier this

month negotiated to buy the same
half-hour of prime time — from 8 to
8:30 p.m. EST that night — on CBS
and NBC
The campaign also approached ABC
and Fox Broadcasting to purchase
that half-hour on those networks, but
Fox already had reserved that time
period for a pre-game show and
Game 6.
Fox asked Major League Baseball
to push the start time to at least 8:35
p.m. Eastern time so that Fox could
accommodate Obama's buy.The first

pitch of a World Series game typical
ly is thrown at 8:22 p.m. Eastern time.
The league agreed to make the
switch, and Fox sold the half hour to
Obama's campaign for just under $1
million.
"This is unprecedented in Ameri
can political and sports history," said
Dan Schnur, director of the Jesse M.
Unruh Institute of Politics at the Uni
versity of Southern California. He
said the only thing that he could think
of that came close was an address by
President Bush a few days after the

terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2(X)1, a
nationally televised speech that
brought to a halt a National Hockey
League exhibition game.
"This just speaks to the tremen
dous level of public interest in this
campaign," Schnur said. "Even if
most candidates could afford to buy
this much time on the networks, they
would be afraid that they might not
be able to hold viewers' interest for
that long."
