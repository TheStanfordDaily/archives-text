## Oregon surfing group finds solace in ocean waves 
### LORI TOBIAS THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
NEWPORT, Ore. (AP) — In the
parking lot of Starfish Point, the
surfers tug and pull,squirm and wig
gle their way into tight neoprene wet
suits. Eventually, booties are tight,
gloves snug, hoods in place — except
for one surfer, who has no need for
the head covering.
Hot flashes, says Tina Brush, ex
plaining in two words everything
women of a certain age need to know
and defining this group as anything
but your typical surfers.
Meet the Duchesses, five ladies with
279 birthday candles among them,
the youngest newly turned 50, the
oldest 66, and each determined on a
sunny September morning to catch
some waves, or at least suck up a lot
of salt water trying.

Their quest began with a birthday.
It was the big Five-O for Ruth Meier,
and she wanted it to be one for the
record books, not just the usual cake
and cards and bad over-the-hill
jokes, but an accomplishment, a gift
for the long run.
"My husband has been a longtime
surfer, and I grew up in Southern
California," Ruth says. "Being the
teenagers in the 70s, the girls were on
the beach; we weren't on the water
surfing. It was a taboo kind of thing."
Now, facing five decades on this
planet, Ruth decided she would take
a surfing lesson and she'd stick with
it. She expected people might think
she was crazy. Instead, she found her
self a sort of leader of the pack, with
friends suddenly asking. "Can I
come, too?"
And so it was, the Duchesses — a
fitting name, they decided, because

older male surfers are called dukes
—• were born. Ruth is the baby of the
bunch. Next is Danielle Emerick, 53,
a lifelong diver and underwater pho
tographer. Danielle tried surfing
when she moved to the coast in 2004,
but her instructor really didn't tell
her much, she says."I was getting
nowhere, just kind of riding the
waves. I was about to give up."
Carol Clifford. 54, can claim the
most experience. Her husband. Ron,
heads up the only 4-H surf club in the
country and has been teaching for
years. Last year, Carol, who has
helped Ron teach the 4-H members,
climbed on a board herself and has
been surfing ever since.
Pam Moore. 56, is the only nonlo
cal. A third-grade teacher with the
Oregon City School District, she
makes the drive to join the others as
often as she can.
"I took an unpaid leave to come
today" she says. "But it is surfing;
what can I say?" Today, she brought
along her husband. Bill. "He's my
surf daddy," Pam jokes."He helps me
get dressed and carries my board."
Tina. 66, a widow of three years, is
the group's senior member and a for
mer trick water-skier. Tina is the
most tentative of the bunch and has
surfed only once, when the women
gathered in August for their first les
son.
"I'm afraid of the water," she ad
mits. "Well, not the water, but the
waves. If you take me out. I can swim
and all; it's just getting past the
waves."
Now the women grab boards and
head for the beach. Husbands Ron
Clifford and Ralph Meier are along
for support, instruction and general
cheerleading.
On the beach. Ralph points to the
headlands above and relates the con
versation he has with each new surfer
he teaches.
First, he asks them to look out
over the ocean, then close their eyes
and remember what they see. Later,
after the lesson, they return to the
spot and repeat the exercise. Invari
ably. Ralph says, new surfers look out
at the sea that second time and they
all think about the same thing: riding

those waves.
"1 tell them, you've changed your
life," he says. "For the rest of your life,
you can't look at a wave without
thinking about riding it."
On the beach, the surfers survey
the waves, they stretch and practice
rising on their boards from lying
prone, to knees, to standing. Finally,
leashes attached from board to
ankle, they walk across the sand into
the water.
The waves close to shore today
curl about 4 to 5 feet high. They are
strong, clean waves, with solid force
behind them. The women stick close
to shore and try to stay out of the
way of other, more experienced
surfers riding the bigger waves far
ther out. A strong current pulls south
toward an area where riptides are
active, and the Duchesses must fight
to hold their ground. Fifteen min
utes after wading in, Tina is back on
shore, short of breath and red-faced.
"I am still afraid of the water,"
she says, worry and regret shadow
ing her eyes. "Danielle, she's deter
mined to make it. I'm not sure I'm
going to. Fm not sure my heart is in
it."
For long minutes, Tina struggles
with her desire to be one of the girls,
and her gut instinct that tells her she
is in over her head. Before long, she
climbs the steep stairs to the parking
lot, where she trades her longboard
for the comfort of her bodyboard.
"I can still be a duchess even with my
Boogie board " she says, smiling now.
"I'll be the mother duchess."
Out in the water. Danielle has
caught a wave — she's up on her
knees, now to her feet and. for a mo
ment, she's riding it in.Then, her bal
ance defeats her and she crashes to
the water. From over the thundering
surf come the shouts, the whistles, the
applause.The Duchesses are doing it.
TTiey are surfing.
And so it goes. One by one, the
ladies raise up on their knees and
lurch to standing, until the sea pulls
the bottom out and they tumble with
the waves.
But soon, they climb back on the
board, find another wave, rise, fall,
repeat.

oldest 66, and each determined on a
sunny September morning to catch
some waves, or at least suck up a lot
of salt water trying.

Their quest began with a birthday.
It was the big Five-O for Ruth Meier,
and she wanted it to be one for the
record books, not just the usual cake
and cards and bad over-the-hill
jokes, but an accomplishment, a gift
for the long run.
"My husband has been a longtime
surfer, and I grew up in Southern
California," Ruth says. "Being the
teenagers in the 70s, the girls were on
the beach; we weren't on the water
surfing. It was a taboo kind of thing."
Now, facing five decades on this
planet, Ruth decided she would take
a surfing lesson and she'd stick with
it. She expected people might think
she was crazy. Instead, she found her
self a sort of leader of the pack, with
friends suddenly asking. "Can I
come, too?"
And so it was, the Duchesses — a
fitting name, they decided, because

older male surfers are called dukes
—• were born. Ruth is the baby of the
bunch. Next is Danielle Emerick, 53,
a lifelong diver and underwater pho
tographer. Danielle tried surfing
when she moved to the coast in 2004,
but her instructor really didn't tell
her much, she says."I was getting
nowhere, just kind of riding the
waves. I was about to give up."
Carol Clifford. 54, can claim the
most experience. Her husband. Ron,
heads up the only 4-H surf club in the
country and has been teaching for
years. Last year, Carol, who has
helped Ron teach the 4-H members,
climbed on a board herself and has
been surfing ever since.
Pam Moore. 56, is the only nonlo
cal. A third-grade teacher with the
Oregon City School District, she
makes the drive to join the others as
often as she can.
"I took an unpaid leave to come
today" she says. "But it is surfing;
what can I say?" Today, she brought
along her husband. Bill. "He's my
surf daddy," Pam jokes."He helps me
get dressed and carries my board."
Tina. 66, a widow of three years, is
the group's senior member and a for
mer trick water-skier. Tina is the
most tentative of the bunch and has
surfed only once, when the women
gathered in August for their first les
son.
"I'm afraid of the water," she ad
mits. "Well, not the water, but the
waves. If you take me out. I can swim
and all; it's just getting past the
waves."
Now the women grab boards and
head for the beach. Husbands Ron
Clifford and Ralph Meier are along
for support, instruction and general
cheerleading.
On the beach. Ralph points to the
headlands above and relates the con
versation he has with each new surfer
he teaches.
First, he asks them to look out
over the ocean, then close their eyes
and remember what they see. Later,
after the lesson, they return to the
spot and repeat the exercise. Invari
ably. Ralph says, new surfers look out
at the sea that second time and they
all think about the same thing: riding

those waves.
"1 tell them, you've changed your
life," he says. "For the rest of your life,
you can't look at a wave without
thinking about riding it."
On the beach, the surfers survey
the waves, they stretch and practice
rising on their boards from lying
prone, to knees, to standing. Finally,
leashes attached from board to
ankle, they walk across the sand into
the water.
The waves close to shore today
curl about 4 to 5 feet high. They are
strong, clean waves, with solid force
behind them. The women stick close
to shore and try to stay out of the
way of other, more experienced
surfers riding the bigger waves far
ther out. A strong current pulls south
toward an area where riptides are
active, and the Duchesses must fight
to hold their ground. Fifteen min
utes after wading in, Tina is back on
shore, short of breath and red-faced.
"I am still afraid of the water,"
she says, worry and regret shadow
ing her eyes. "Danielle, she's deter
mined to make it. I'm not sure I'm
going to. Fm not sure my heart is in
it."
For long minutes, Tina struggles
with her desire to be one of the girls,
and her gut instinct that tells her she
is in over her head. Before long, she
climbs the steep stairs to the parking
lot, where she trades her longboard
for the comfort of her bodyboard.
"I can still be a duchess even with my
Boogie board " she says, smiling now.
"I'll be the mother duchess."
Out in the water. Danielle has
caught a wave — she's up on her
knees, now to her feet and. for a mo
ment, she's riding it in.Then, her bal
ance defeats her and she crashes to
the water. From over the thundering
surf come the shouts, the whistles, the
applause.The Duchesses are doing it.
TTiey are surfing.
And so it goes. One by one, the
ladies raise up on their knees and
lurch to standing, until the sea pulls
the bottom out and they tumble with
the waves.
But soon, they climb back on the
board, find another wave, rise, fall,
repeat.
