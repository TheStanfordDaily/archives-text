## Problems delay prison expt. movie Hollywood film of '70s Stanford prison experiment still in the works 
### AMANDA ZHANG 
The big-screen Hollywood retelling of Stanford
Prof. Philip Zimbardo's famed 1970s prison exper
iment is at yet another roadblock.
"A Hollywood movie about my Stanford Prison
Experiment is in the works." Zimbardo said, "but
the works are slow."
Progress was originally delayed when
Christopher McQuarrie, the director and co-writer
of the film with Tim Talbott. went abroad to Berlin
to work on "Valkyrie" as a writer, producer and
assistant director to Bryan Singer. "Valkyrie," a
movie about the assassination plot against Adolf
Hitler, stars 7'om Cruise and will be released on
Dec. 28.
McQuarrie's absence is only one in a number of
consecutive delays that have pushed the movie
back. Maverick Films, founded in 2001 by
Madonna and Guy Oseary, was locked in a lawsuit
with Inferno Distribution over rights to the film.
The lawsuit was resolved earlier this year on Jan.
16, when Maverick was given legal permission to
continue with its plans.
Although McQuarrie — who won an Academy
Award for his 1995 screenplay for "The Usual
Suspects" — has already returned to the United
States from Berlin, he is only at the casting stage of
the film. I le is currently searching for actors to play
the prison guard ensemble. Prof. Zimbardo, Carlo
Prescott (an ex-convict and chief consultant for the
experiment who has raised objections to the mak
ing of the movie) and psychologist Christina
Maslach (the film's heroine). Maslach prompted
the early termination of the actual experiment.
Despite previous rumors that Ryan Phillippe,
Kieran Culkin, Paul Dano, Jesse Eisenberg,
Charlie Hunnam, Ben McKenzie and Channing
Tatum would be starring in the movie, no main
characters have yet been confirmed.
Prof. Zimbardo conducted the experiment in
1971, assigning student volunteers to the roles of
prison guards and prisoners, but the study was
ended prematurely due to the intense reactions of
the subjects to their roles. Zimbardo is a senior
consultant for the movie and works closely with its
writers.
"Much of the details I described in the first 10
chapters of The Lucifer Effect forms the basis of
(the movie] — with dramatic elements added,"
Zimbardo said.
Zimbardo's book. The Lucifer Effect:
Understanding How Good People Turn Evil, was
published in 2007 and recounts the events of the
prison experiment.
The Stanford Legal Council is allowing the
moviemakers to use Stanford's name in the movie
only under three conditions: that the movie follow
the events of the study as closely as possible, that
nothing added will negatively portray Stanford,
the study of psychology or Zimbardo, beyond his
role as prison superintendent.
Such precautions are understandable and nec
essary. In 2001, the German movie Das
Experiment claimed to be inspired by the Stanford
prison experiment but depicted wildly inaccurate
