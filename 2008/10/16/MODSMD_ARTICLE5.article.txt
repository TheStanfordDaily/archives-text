## Natl. medical insurance law affects colleges Michelle's Law protects health care coverage of students on medical leave 
### ALAN GUO STAFF WRITER 
New legislation affecting college students, titled
Michelle's Law (H.R. 2851). guarantees students tak
ing medical leaves of absence up to a year of depend
ent status under their parents" health insurance
plans. While the effect of this law on Stanford's
health insurance plan is uncertain. Stanford students
welcomed the law.
President Bush signed Michelle's Law (H.R.
2851) into effect on Oct. 9. Though the number of
students affected by this law might not be directly
obvious, it is a relief for those who suffer from med
ical conditions.
"Cancer treatment is not something that only
affects you when you go to the hospital for your
chemotherapy, radiation or surgery," said Kate
McGrath '10, a cancer survivor and officer of student
group Stanford College Against Cancer (SCAC).
"No one diagnosed with cancer should have to con
front the additional stress of taking a full course load
in order to receive health insurance coverage."
Vaden Health Center staff is still trying to assess
whether the law affects Cardinal Care, the
University-sponsored student insurance plan.
"Presently, we believe the law does not pertain to
Cardinal Care, but we have asked for legal review to
confirm our interpretation." said Amy Baldwin, asso
ciate Director of Vaden. in an email to The Daily.
"However, students who are on Cardinal Care can
take a leave of absence and remain on the plan for
the remaining quarters in the academic year."
Staff of Vaden Health Center could not disclose
information on students who were or are on medical
leaves of absence, making it difficult to know the size
of students potentially impacted by Michelle's Law.
The bill is named after Michelle Morse, a former
student of Plymouth State University who was diag
nosed with cancer in 2(M)4. Morse had to maintain her
full-time enrollment while undergoing chemothera
py so she could be covered by her family's insurance.
She eventually succumbed to colon cancer.
A similar law was first passed in New Hampshire,
Michelle's home state, in 2006 after
strong advocacy by Michelle's moth
er. The bill was sponsored by U.S.
Rep. Paul Hodes (D-NH) and
received bipartisan support in
Congress.
A few other universities already
include in their student health insur
ance plan protection for those who
mill need health coverage but are no
longer able to enroll in school.
Illinois State University, for example,
allows students to switch from a
group plan to an individual plan lor
up to 12 months after withdrawing
from the university.
Meanwhile, administrators in
charge of undergraduate education
at Stanford applauded the legislation
and assured students that taking a

leave of absence for medical —or
non-medical — reasons is nothing to
he afraid of.
"'[lie process is very easy." said
Assistant Dean of Freshmen Koren
Bakkegard. "We have advisors here
at the VPUE office helping students
who are thinking about leave of
absence to evaluate impacts, with
regard to housing, financial aid. etc.
We want to emphasize that a leave of
absence is always an option."
SCAC members were thrilled by
the news of the legislation. Jamie
Tam " 10, co-chair of the group, point
ed to the strong advocacy effort of
the American Cancer Society, the
umbrella organization of College
Against Cancer, for the expediency
of the process.
"As part of American Cancer
Society's advocacy initiative, we col
lected over 1(H) signatures in support
of Michelle's Law last year," Tam
said. "It's very rewarding to see the
bill finally become a realitv."

"I think that it needed to hap
pen," said Lexi Peters '11, the
American Cancer Society advocacy
lead in California. "And hopefully
we'll he able to amend it later on and
extend the amount of time. A year is
just not enough."
McGrath shared her experience
as a cancer survivor, stressing the
importance of the legislation.
"Fighting cancer is a 24/7 battle —
one that leaves you fatigued, nau
seous and emotionally drained " she
said. "Diagnosed with cancer at age
15. 1 struggled to keep up with my
high-school studies during my treat
ment. I can assure you that it was no
small feat for me to graduate with
my class."
SCAC hopes to continue its
momentum in advocacy and work on
breast cancer awareness in the com
ing month.
