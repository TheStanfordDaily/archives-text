New legislation affecting college students, titled
Michelle's Law (H.R. 2851). guarantees students tak

take a leave of absence and remain on the plan for
the remaining quarters in the academic year."

information on students who were or are on medical
leaves of absence, making it difficult to know the size

She eventually succumbed to colon cancer.
