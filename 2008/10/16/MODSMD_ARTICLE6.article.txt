## SLAC renamed to SLAC Natl. Accelerator Laboratory Gov. dispute over SLAC's renaming resolved 
### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
In 2008, University officials and the
U.S. Department of Energy (DOE)
debated over the moniker of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center

(SLAC). A compromise was finally
reached yesterday, and the center is now
named the SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory.
The DOE originally raised issue with
the name of the laboratory in a national
campaign to secure government laborato
ries. of which SLAC was one. l"he DOE,
which foots the $300-million annual bill
for the center, wanted to remove
Stanford's name from the laboratory's
title.

SLAC physicists were upset with the
DOE's call for a new name, fearing that
dropping Stanford from the laboratory's
title would damage the center's history
and illustrious reputation. Throughout its
existence, SLAC has been linked to four
Nobel Pri/es and numerous discoveries.
The physicists circulated a petition stat
ing that the name "SLAC" was integral to
the lab's identity.
They were partly successful: While the
University's name has been eliminated

from the facility's official name, the
acronym SLAC remains in the title.
Meanwhile, the addition of the word
"National" to the center's official name is a
nod toward taxpayers, who sustain the lab
oratory.
SLAC Director Persis Drell is satisfied
with the lab's new name, noting to the San
Jose Mercury News that the new title indi
cates a strong linkage between the center's
successful past and its future research
prospects.
