## FMOTQ: Through the eyes of a freshman 
### CAROLINE CASELLI 
St's 10 p.m., and preparations are com
plete. Stanford police officers are sur
rounding the perimeter of the Quad.
Metal barriers are in place in an attempt
to block the entrance from wandering
Palo Alto natives, high-school students and other
unwanted additions to Stanford's own Love Fest.
Countless Peer Health Educators (PHEs) have as
sembled tables stocked with free goodies, from con
doms to breath strips to chocolate Hershey's kisses.
Usually prominent. Memorial Church and
Rodin's Bergers are mere backdrops to the grow
ing festivity on the Quad. The air is a crisp 59 de
grees, and the moon is aglow. Red and blue lights
radiate from the stage set up underneath one of
the sandstone arches.
It's 10:30 p.m., and the party is still pretty dead.
Giddy packs of freshmen make their way from
their dorms, anxiously anticipating a night of free
love and promiscuity. Or at least that's how their
Residential Assistants (RAs) and upperclassmen
counterparts described it.
While entering the Quad, two girls giggle at the
"No obvious drunkenness" sign. They whisper
loudly that they aren't that drunk as they flash
their student IDs and stumble past the complacent
Stanford police officer.
A chick rock band predictably croons Katy
Perry's."l kissed a girl and 1 liked it..." At this
point, several inspired pairs of girls decide to make
out, to the pure delight of the boys surrounding

them.
Half an hour passes and the crowds are steadi
ly trickling in. Students gather in small, awkward
huddles, clinging to the friends they came with.
Groups of students chatter incessantly:
"Is this it?" proclaims a bored-sounding girl,
checking her iPhone.
"We're so early," replies her friend, looking
around expectantly. "I told you we shouldn't have

come until midnight."
The much-hyped l ull Moon on the Quad event
is currently appearing to be a major letdown. The
Quad is still relatively open and everyone around
seems to be a member of the Class of 2012.
"But what if no one wants to kiss me?"slurs an
other student, clinging to her roommate's shoul
der for support.
The roommate turns to another friend.

"I should have taken another shot," she says.
"I'm definitely not drunk enough."
At the same time, two PiPhis, easily identified
by their matching black tank tops, chant, "Make
out! Make-out!" as they skip through the crowds.
The pressure is indeed mounting. Every fresh
man girl is expected to find a senior boy to kiss
come midnight. Yet. with just under an hour to go,
the upperclassmen prospects seem very limited.
So much for being truly initiated into the Stanford
community.
The music blares. The countdown to midnight
continues.
It's 11:30 p.m.,and the Quad has taken on a new
life. Dancers wearing white button down shirts,
ties and little more are performing a hip-hop
dance routine on stage.The random sprinklings of
people have now united into one swaying con
glomerate.
It seems as if everyone is out tonight â€” the ath
letes, the Greeks, the studious kid upstairs that
never comes out, a slew of graduate students wear
ing their hoodless Stanford sweatshirts. Even the
friendly man that works at the front desk of the li
brary has made an appearance.
A new student music group has taken the stage,
and they break into a very sensual rendition of
Marvin Gaye's "Let's Get It On." Bovs and girls
scope out the scene, scouting a potential hook-up.
It must be nearly midnight.
And then it happens. An unknown blond boy
meanders suavely in the direction of several fresh
man girls.
"So," he begins, speaking slowly. "Are you guys
freshmen?"
The girls look at each other with confusion and
expectation, fear and exhilaration.
The boldest of them speaks.
"Uh, yeah?" she replies hesitantly.
But there is no going back. Long gone are the
courteous days when senior boys and freshman
girls lined up on opposite ends of the Quad, meet
ing in the middle for a quick kiss.
And with that.it's now 12:01 a.m.,and the Quad
is an epicenter of utter merrymaking madness.
But not everyone in the Quad is there for an
anonymous kiss. Some stand off to the side, simply
watching with amusement. Others are clustered
directly below the stage, dancing to the vibrant
beats of the bands.
And some are evading the random smooch.
There's the easy rejection, the rapid look to the
ground, the "Oh. I'm not actually a freshman girl"
excuse. And when all else fails, the rapid walk (or
run) in the opposite direction is always effective.
As the night wears on, the remaining partiers
may encounter the senior boys wearing "tic-tac
toe" shirts that feature a different freshman dorm
in each square. Or there's the much older man with
a ponytail and receding hairline milling through
the crowd. Or there are the naked people in body
paint. Or the Stanford Tree, who arrives with the
rest of the Band just after midnight.
This carries on for approximately an hour.
Finally. 1 a.m. rolls around, and the Quad is
emptying out. The music has stopped. Once jubi
lant people are now tired and hungry, and for
many, the night concludes with greasy food at the
Axe & Palm or Lag LateNite.
Come tomorrow, the accidental hookup, or the
developing case of mono or the perpetual haunt
ing question of "Did I hook up with that guy last
night?" may be one one's mind. But tonight, the
craziness that is Full Moon on the Quad does not
matter in the least.Tonight is about Stanford tradi
tion and a good, free-loving time.
