# Alum enters National Geographic photo contest

During his days at Stanford. Quinn
Miller-Bedell '07 never thought that he
would wind up being in the highly com
petitive National Geographic "Your
Shot" photo contest.
But at this moment, that's exactly
what he's doing.
The "Your Shot" contest is a month
ly online competition where anyone
can submit one photo in the hopes of it
being featured in National Geographic
magazine. Of the thousands of submis
sions. only 12 daily are selected to be
judged by the public on a scale of one to
10 through the National Geographic
Web site.
Miller-Bedell's photo — a touching
image of a mother macaque holding her
dead baby — is part of the September
contest. And though the photo is giving
him a shot at National Geographic
fame, photography was surprisingly not
a major focus of his at Stanford.
Although he attempted to take a
photography class and even tried to
take pictures for The Daily, which never
happened. Miller-Bedell rather busied
himself with a major in political science
and the Stanford track team during his
freshman year.
It was by chance that Miller-Bedell
developed a passion for photography.
The graduate attributes his photogra
phy breakthrough to Alex Greenburg
'09. Greenburg was able to teach
Miller-Bedell about photography and
even let him borrow his fancy Canon
digital camera to photograph the track
team during a home meet.
"It was really this one day of shoot
ing that made me realize that this was
something that I really enjoyed and

would love to pursue further," Miller-
Bedell said in an email to The Daily.
Miller-Bedell was first exposed to
the "Yourshot" photo contest when his
senior-year roommate in EBF, Tim
Varga '07 — an accomplished photog
rapher. himself — bolted an old cereal
box to the bathroom wall. He filled it
with current issues of the "National Ge
ographic" in hope that residents' bath
room experiences would be more
pleasurable and informative.
It took a while, though, before
Miller-Bedell would come around to
photography and take his glorious shot.
The road had a few bumps and twists as
the Class of 2007 grad began his post
college life.
Shortly after graduating from Stan
ford. Miller-Bedell moved to Los Ange
les to pursue his interests in film and tel
evision. He spent much of his time in
Universal Studios watching the filming
of the ABC comedy "Carpoolers,"
whose lead actor, Tim Pepper, was his
roommate. Unfortunately, fate inter
vened in this fairy-tale-like lifestyle,
and a major injury in his knee left him
unable to walk.
Forced to move back to New York
City with his parents, Miller-Bedell
spent much of his time in pain as his
doctors continued to misdiagnose his
injury. Fortunately,after months of mis
diagnoses. an orthopedist was able to
accurately identify that the source of
his injury was a small tear in the lateral
side of the meniscus in his right knee.
Inspired and enthralled by this new
wave of hope, he agreed to take a fami
ly trip to Indonesia.
But while there. Miller-Bedell spent
much of his time in the hotel, still in
pain.

"I was often frustrated during the
trip because my knees hurt all the time
and I couldn't walk far. which you often
need to do get good photos," he said.
And when his sister, Emma Rose
Miller-Bedell '12 encouraged him to
visit a nearby park called Monkey For
est. Quinn was reluctant to go, fearful of
the inevitable pain in his knee.
Nevertheless, he agreed.
"[lt was] one of the best moves of my
life," he said.
The picture that Miller-Bedell sub
mitted to "Your Shot" depicts a mother
monkey mourning the loss of her child.
It was the mother's inability to let go of
her child — likely dead for several
days, as evidenced by the glazed green
eyes — that tugged at the hearts of
Emma, Quinn and the National Geo
graphic editors.
Chance and fate played an impor
tant role in such an emotional, and per
haps life-changing, experience.
Miller Bedell currently lives in New
York City, recovering from a successful
knee surgery, and he just received a job
at a biotech firm called Anadis. Yet he
still aspires to be a professional photog
rapher or filmmaker.
Miller-Bedell awaits the results of
the "Your Shot" contest until next
month. And as an added plus, he was re
cently notified that his photo was se
lected for National Geographic's Inter
national Photography Contest, a sepa
rate competition at the world level that
announces its winners in December.
Perhaps by the end of the year, readers
can pick up a copy of the magazine, with
his photo on one of its glossy pages.
