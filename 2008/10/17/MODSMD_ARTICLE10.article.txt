## Capturing the invisible: Photos from the 19th century at SFMOMA 
### 
The San Francisco Museum of Modern
Art's newest photography exhibit,
"Brought to Light," explores how sci
entific photography changed visions of reali
ty in the late 19th century. Ranging from the
infinitesimally small to the infinitely large,
the collection's 231 vintage photographs ask
its viewers to consider what it means to see
the invisible for the first time.
The first room is filled with visions of
the microscopic — where the seemingly
banal is transformed into strange beauty.

Human skin takes on the form of rippled
sand dunes, the cross section of a frog intes
tine is akin to the folds of a Georgia O'Keefc
painting and the mouth of a processionary
caterpillar (enlarged one hundred diameters)
becomes an ethereal layering of membranes.
Although many of these images were
used to further scientific discovery, the art of
microscopic photography was also propelled
forward thanks to the help of amateurs.
Wilson Alwyn Bentley, a Vermont farmer,
painstakingly transferred snowflakes from
his backyard to his microscopic camera using
a single piece of straw from his broom. Over
the course of thirty years he photographed
5,000 snowflakes and uncovered unique crys
talline forms. Bentley's images provide a dis
tinct bridge between science and art — his
work was accessible to the public, beautiful
in nature and meticulous in method. In this
microscopic work, phenomena that could
never be seen with the naked eye were finally
in mass circulation for all the public to see.
Other phenomena that were universally
experienced, such as the night sky, also
became an immediate subject of early pho
tographers. Although the moon and stars
were easily experienced in everyday exis
tence, the technical ability to capture these
images was incredibly demanding at the
time. To capture the details of the moon, sci
entists would patiently expose images for
hours while carefully turning the telescope to
counteract the motion associated with the
rotating earth. The results were stunning and
the long exposures yielded images of stars
and nebulas that had never been seen before.
These new photos even sparked the interest
of painters such as Van Gogh, who included
a nebula that had been recently discovered in
his famous "Starry Night."
One of the most visually stunning por
tions of the exhibit is the collection of elec
tricity and magnetism photographs. While

images of the moon and stars were grounded
in an immediate sense of reality, sparks of
electricity and the invisible power of mag
netic fields were, in comparison, a novel
technological concept. Etiennc Trouvelot, a
manufacturer of scientific instruments,
exposed photosensitive paper with pure
sparks of electricity from a Ruhmkorff coil.
In his collection of images, strands of light
expand in coniferous forms and create
abstract, almost psychedelic, patterns.
While images of electricity explored the
beauty of the rarely seen, the collection of
motion-study images exposed the mechanics
of human and animal kinematics. With the
invention of the mechanical shutter,
moments that occurred faster than the blink
of an eye were finally captured on film.
Eadweard Muybridge's famous study of a
galloping horse disproved the notion that a
horse's hooves leave the ground while
splayed out in front — a previously arche
typal image of a horse in motion can be seen
in many classical paintings.
While Muybridge significantly con
tributed to our understanding of human
movement and eventually to the technology
underlying films, some of his images strayed
away from the pursuit of scientific knowl
edge. Erring on the side of comedy,
"Spanking a Child" depicts a naked mother
spanking her young child. Taken from multi
ple angles, the study does not give one an

enlightened sense of kinematics, but rather
begs to ask, who spanks their children while
buck-naked? And why did Muybridge ever
conceive of such a strange situation? Comedy
aside, the collection succeeds in offering a
varied look at the overlap of science and
artistic vision.
Further inquiry into the composition of
human bodies was also embodied in the first
X-ray images. In 1895, Conrad Rontgen dis
covered the peculiar quality of X-rays to pen
etrate opaque substances and leave a mark
on photographic paper or plates placed
behind the objects. One of his earliest images
of his wife's hand shows the delicacy and
underlying structure of the human hand

contrasted with her wedding ring, which appears strangely massive in com
parison. Another image of note is Victor Chabaud's "X-ray of a plate with
crayfish," in which the normalcy of a home-cooked dinner is transformed
into an eerie exploration of a crawfish's interlinking anatomy. In addition
to offering a distorted view of reality, Chabaud also appeared to be very
conscious of the image's aesthetic composition; the circular plate forms a
frame within a frame to further highlight the intricacies of the crawfish.
Corey Keller, the curator of the exhibit, succeeds in presenting a wide
range of the striking scientific imagery. It's incredible that even after 100
years, images that were once revolutionary visions into the inner workings
of the world still retain the beauty that is inherent in new discovery today.
"Brought to Light: Photography and the Invisible" is on display at the
SFMOMA through lan. 4. For more information, visit sfmoma.org.
