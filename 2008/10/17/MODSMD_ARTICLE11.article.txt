# THEATER REVIEW
## Baldwin's pages come to life in "Sonny's Blues" 
### 
The Word For Word
Performing Arts
Gimpany's presentation
of "Sonny's Blues," directed by
Margo Hall, drew a typical
Stanford Lively Arts crowd —
older and classier than that which
Pigott Theater sees at the typical
Simps performance. The contrast
between the well-oft" audience
and the working-class characters

in the play was unmentioned by the various peo
ple who spoke before and after the performance,
but I wondered what it says about the Stanford
community that only old white folks in evening
wear were interested in a story about the African
American experience in '50s Harlem.
"Sonny's Blues" is actually a short story by
James Baldwin that Word for Word, a San
Francisco performing group, has adapted to a
staged reading. This adaptation meets Word for
Word's mission, encapsulated in its name: to
present works of fiction verbatim. The recorded
soundtrack is fully original, composed by
Marcus Shelby, a San Francisco jazz legend.
The story centers around the narrator and
his kid brother Sonny, raised in Harlem at the
middle of the 20th century. The two men
immerse themselves in radically different
lifestyles; the narrator is a high-school algebra
tcacher, Sonny a blues musician who gets into
heroin while a high-school student himself.
Each man struggles to define his own opinion
of suffering, music and family, both misunder
standing each other and fighting to keep their
relationship alive after the death of their moth
er. The final scene of the story takes place in a
smoky blues club where, for the first time, the
narrator hears Sonny play the piano.
The actors did the reading on a black stage
with only a backdrop for scenery. Their scripts
were with them on stage, and they were dressed
in simple costumes and used no props. There
was no pretense of suspension of disbelief or
attempt to retain the "fourth wall" between the
actors and the audience; the reading was clearly
just that, not a theatrical event with pizzazz.
The lack of a fourth wall worked smoothly
with the subject matter, because "Sonny's Blues"
does not readily lend itself to an ensemble pro
duction as a short story. It is a first-person nar
rative by the older brother, and he often mono-

the vital stats.

logues about his memories rather than recount
ing dialogue with other characters.
The entire presentation therefore took on a
dream-like, unrealistic quality, as the narrator
called forth different characters from his memo
ry to relive his past before dismissing them.
Rather than simply speaking about themselves,
the characters described themselves from the
viewpoints of others; for example, Sonny might
describe his own smile as his brother sees it.
Paradoxically, they must see themselves from the
narrator's point of view, mimicking the actions
he decrees and following his instructions.
In another quirk of language resulting
from the adaptation from story to play, the
actors created a Spoken Word-esque relation
ship with the entire text, not just the written
dialogue. A typical Baldwin line reads '"I guess
he thought so, too,' I said sharply, 'and that's
how he got hung.'" Anthony Harper, who
played the brother, read the entire line, includ
ing"! said sharply." He carried his emotion
through the line, not breaking into narrative
detachment outside of the dialogue, as one
would do simply reading the story aloud. The
effect this created is akin to the difference
between that kid in your English class reading
the "To be or not to be" soliloquy aloud and
hearing Laurence Olivier perform it to an audi
ence of hundreds.
Harper took the text and found his own
meaning, then presented his unique vision in
his reading. The story was no longer a passive
piece for a reader to interpret, but an opinionat
ed work for the audience to react to. The actors
gave Baldwin's words life and specific meaning.
The staged reading was more than reading die
words — in this sense, it was fully a play.
