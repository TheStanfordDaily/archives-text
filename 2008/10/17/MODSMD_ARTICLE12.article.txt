do these male enhancement drugs

This question lies close to my heart. I have a friend, let's call him Sean, and he recently
asked me a similar question. According to the FDA, none of these drugs work. If they did,
they would probably capture a market share equivalent to Viagra and you would be seeing
cheesy daytime commercials opposed to infomercials that promise you a "larger stroke of
confidence." But what would it be like if they did work? I like to think that they

would get abused like steroids. Instead of buff muscles, peopl*
would be walking around showing off their buff D's at the
beach. Muscle shirts would turn into penis pants that show
off your bulge. Also, let's talk for a second about female
expectations — I guess you would call it a growing problem.
In response to your second question, I too think it would be
super if you could grow more than one penis. My question
is where else on your body would you want it? I would have
to pick belly button because then, when you didn't have a
boner, it would just look like a funny outie.
