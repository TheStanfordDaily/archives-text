# Recycle, reuse, seduce!

### 
Today I ravaged my wardrobe, pawing
through jungles of lace and the occa
sional silky something or other, until I
encountered several exquisitely naughty new
accessories.
Recycling is marvelous for the environ
ment, but it's also a fantastically fun and frugal
way to keep your sex life exciting. Cramped
dorm rooms may not seem conducive to erotic
adventuring, but you'll be surprised at all of the
items desperately waiting for you to discover

their delicious ulterior functions.

Let's begin with the
"unmentionables" drawer (or

drawers, if you share my
taste for little lacy confec
tions). Stockings can be
employed in a million
wonderful ways, besides
adorning our gawgeous

gams. I prefer them wrapped
tightly around my wrists and ankles,
and perhaps a bed post or four. Their

elasticity provides just the right amount of
comfort and mobility while your beastly para
mour is having his way with you. But keep the
$150 silk back-seamed numbers tucked away
for a special day because those custom cuffs
may get a little stressed, if you know what I
mean.
I love luscious fabrics — rich, draping tap
estries to caress my walls and replace drab
dorm room with sumptuous Moulin Rouge
boudoir. They're also perfect for shutting him

up. Sometimes a good gagging is just what he
needs, and secretly wants, after a hard day's
work. Feeling power hungry? Whip out that
scarf your mommy gave you, secure firmly over
his dreamy eyes, and voila! Blind-folding com
plete. Ooooh, 1 just adore a little bondage, don't
you?
Next, take a peep into your belt collection.
Scan those belts up and down and listen care
fully: "Have you been naughty today?" A partic
ularly nasty piece of leather beckons. Yes, yes,
yes! Now, prepare for a good spanking.

Neckties are utilized best when yanked
violently from a man's neck. But they are
also fabulous when they're the only
thing he has on. If he's a good Stanford

boy, he'll have plenty at his disposal.
Next time soon-to-be big business man

wants to give you a ride, politely request

some reins or just throw one around his

neck and giddy-up! It's nice to have a little
something to hold on to. And that remnant of
office formality makes your dirty deeds that
much more delightfully despicable.
Hello mask you always wear when your
roommate refuses to turn off her desk light.
Why, hello there candles you illegally keep on
the window sill (but of course never light).
Good evening little schoolgirl outfit you wore
last Halloween!
Feeling resourceful yet? Go recycle!
