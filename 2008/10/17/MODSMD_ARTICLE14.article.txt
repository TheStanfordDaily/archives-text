# The 						new iPod is sexier than ever
## 
### 
The newest and possibly sexiest member of the iPod family,
the iPod nano, was released last month; the fourth genera
tion of the nano branch. Back to its original shape — a
longer rectangle as opposed to the third-generation squared design
— the nano features a sleeker, more futuristic shape in Apple's
slimmest iPod to date. Swapping sharp edges for a curved look in
line with the iPhone and iPod touch, the nano's new look is stream
lined and very chic.
In addition to its enhanced shape, the nano is available in nine
bright colors ranging from hot pink to yellow to classic tones of sil
ver and black. As with all new Apple products, the colorful options
are an enticing draw.
Featuring tried and true click-wheel navigation, the nano is as
user-friendly as any member of the current iPod family. Where the
new nano strays from older models is in its enhanced screen — like
the iPod touch and iPhone it has an "accelerometer" allowing users
to tilt and twirl their way through album covers and nano-specific
games. One of the most novel features is the "shake to shuffle"
option, used to mix-up songs in a play list. The user literally shakes
the iPod, and the songs change order randomly.
Another interesting programming feature is the new "Genius
Playlists," recently unrolled by Apple for all iPods and iPhones. By
playing a song and holding down the center button, the program
selects similar songs and creates a play list. Similar to the "genius"
function, but not quite as genius, pressing the center button will
also give the user the option to "browse artist" or "browse album,"
allowing for easy access to all tunes.
At two inches, the 320x240 resolution display equals that of
larger iPods. Even so, the screen on the nano is a bit small for
watching TV shows. Smaller than a book of matches, the pictures
are clear, but relatively teeny-tiny. It would suffice for a commuter
trip on Caltrain or a short plane ride, but for a longer trip or to
watch regularly, we would want something bigger.
Users of the iPhone and iPod touch will find the interface
counterintuitive, as there is no touch screen. Our first instinct was
to scroll through the album covers by swishing our fingers against
the screen — you can imagine our disappointment when all that
did was leave the glass with our greasy finger marks. We were also
thrown off slightly when using the nano in the horizontal position.
Rather than pressing in the "up" direction on the click wheel to
move backward through the display, you still must push the
"menu" button. It's not terribly confusing, but it did take us one or
two tries to get it right.
Still, the iPod nano is a true representation of Apple design at
its finest. The new iPod weighs a mere 1.3 ounces — less than the
ice around your neck — and can play music for up to 24 hours
when fully charged. In BGB ($149) and 16GB ($199) sizes, the nano
is almost big enough to replace your iPod Classic, and definitely
small enough to replace your shuffle. It has become widely expected
of Apple to go above and beyond, and with the new iPod nano, they
did just that.
