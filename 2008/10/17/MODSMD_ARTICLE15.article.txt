# MUSiC REVIEW
## Weezer's still rocking, bald spots and all 
### 
Even from the balcony seats in
the San Jose State Event
Center, I had a relatively
good line of sight down onto the
stage. I was able to see all of the
techs setting up during the inter
mission between Angels and
Airwaves, the opening band, and
Weezer. The set-up caught my eye
for exactly three strange reasons:
There were three drum sets, a
trampoline and at least eight
microphones on stage.
"Three drums sets?" you ask,
"but how?" The confusion is easy
to understand — Weezer is com
prised of only four members —
Rivers Cuomo, Brian Bell, Scott
Shriner and Patrick Wilson, and
Wilson is the only drummer
among them. Weezer's newly
released self-titled album, referred
to as "The Red Album," is different
from previous albums most
notably because of the distribution
of writing credits. Usually Cuomo
acts as the principal songwriter,
churning out catchy songs with
ease. But on "Red," each member
writes and sings at least one song
each. So, when drummer Wilson
prepares to sing one of his songs,
one of the other members hops on
a kit and keeps time. Mystery
solved. Now, on to the trampoline.

This was the first Weezer show
I'd ever been to. Going in, my
expectations were admittedly very
high. More than one person has
confessed to me that his or her
experience at a Weezer show has
been, without question, the most
memorable and enjoyable concert
experience they've ever had.
Everyone else must have heard the
same thing; a mosh pit had formed
even before the lights went down.
They band walked onto the
stage to roaring applause, and
made a few girls' heads combust (I
saw this, it was messy) by jumping
immediately into "My Name Is
Jonas," the first track off "The Blue
Album." Cuomo, equipped with a
headset-style microphone and a
wireless guitar connection, was
running and power-sliding all over
the stage. During the song's bridge,
he soloed while jumping on the
trampoline. In terms of showman
ship, the band, and especially
Cuomo, knows how to deliver.
While Cuomo kept the neo-glam
rock stage moves coming, the rest
of the band played on solidly,
switching instruments tin almost
every song. And, with each song
change, the lights would change
accordingly. When the menacing
"Hash Pipe" started playing about
13 songs in, the stage went blood
red, and, towards the end of the
show, the signature winged Weezer
"W" descended behind the band.
The group played hit songs
from each of its six albums, among
them: "Say It Ain't So," "Undone
(The Sweater Song)," "Keep
Fishin'" and "Pork and Beans."
They also threw in a few slightly
obscure tunes, most notably "Pink
Triangle" and "El Scorcho." After

another instrument swap that put
Wilson on guitar and lead vocals
and Cuomo on drums, Brian Bell
started an electronic drum
machine, providing the back beat
for the band's only cover of the
night, Pink Floyd's "Time/Breath
Reprise." They played the song very
well, and got the audience charged
for what was about to happen.
Which brings us back to the
excess of microphones on stage.
Weezer has labeled this tour "The
Hootenanny," which is a term used
to describe impromptu folk music
jam sessions where the audience
takes part in the performance.
Which is exactly what happened.
After "Time" finished up, about 20
musicians, some of them carrying
guitars and others carrying trian
gles and tubas, walked on stage and
jammed with the band on "Island
in the Sun" and "Beverly Hills." The
guest musicians were all San Jose
State students who had been hand
selected by the band through a
series of You Tube video blogs.
Surprisingly, the ensemble was
tight and dynamic, conducted the
whole time by Cuomo, who
seemed more like a middle-school
teacher than a rock star at that
point.
The hootenanny ended, and
the band gave the crowd one last
dose of catchiness with "Buddy
Holly." All in all, I think I would
have to agree with the masses on
this one — this was one of the
most memorable shows I've ever
been to. If you have a chance see
Weezer live, don't hesitate.
