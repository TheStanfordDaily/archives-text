# Vik Muniz:
## Teaching us how to see 
### 
The visual artist Vik Muniz spoke in Annenberg
Auditorium on Wednesday night as a part of the Studio
Lecture Series put on by the Art & Art History depart
ment. Muniz has created works in all media, including dia
monds, caviar, plastic toys and junk from landfills. Though he
is popularly known for his rendition of the Mona Lisa in PB&J
and his recreation of "The Last Supper" in chocolate syrup, he
is much more than a food magician.
He spoke about the possibilities of art to play with percep
tions, and the power of materials to carry their associations
into artwork. Although he said he never intended to become
an artist, his range of works have brought him worldwide
recognition and demonstrate his passion for connecting with
a wide audience. "I don't think of a specific public, it should be
everyone," he told his audience. "It should be something that

can please William [Muniz's befriended
UPS driver] and the chief curator of the

Metropolitan Museum of Art."

At first timid on stage, Muniz
spoke about his childhood with

his hands jammed into the
pockets of his snug skinny leg

jeans. "1 was that kid always
drawing caricatures of the

teachers in the back of the
class," he recalled. "I got

dates with girls because I
could draw pictures for them."

He was born into a working-class
family in San Paolo Brazil in 1961 during the military dictator-

ship. This atmosphere taught his entire
generation to take nothing at face value:
They were always questioning information
and listening for subliminal messages of
resistance in every love song played on the
radio. Growing up in this environment, he
became fascinated with perception — a
curiosity that would prove to be influential
in his future work.
Although he was inspired by psy
chology, he admitted that he was better at
advertising. He worked for billboard com
panies in Brazil, discovering ways to use
the psychology of visual perception to
improve the design and layout of adver
tisements. At an award ceremony, he was
accidentally shot by a man outside. "Really
I was lucky, the man who shot me was real
ly rich," and after agreeing to a bribe to not
press charges, Muniz was able to pay for
his airfare to move to the East Village in
New York City. He joked: "The real reason

I am here today is because I got shot!"
Once the lights dimmed and his slideshow began, he

abandoned his wall-flower stage presence and became

a dynamic entertainer. His group of objects called
"relics" were highly amusing. One slide displayed

a skull with a bone sphere protruding from the

nasal cavity; "this is a clown skull, the rem
nant of a race of very evolved entertainers."

A second slide, a photograph of half a
piece of marble stuck into the earth, was
a "half gravestone, for people who are
not dead vet."

His works extend beyond comedy

He explained that these visual puns

required the audience to "be fooled for a second." We have to
agree to be deceived, in order to believe in the representations
that artists create in their works. He traced back the discovery
of representation to prehistoric man staring at cracks in a cave
wall. Muniz described how the cracks animated a hunt scene
for this man, and started reminding him of the celebrations
and the feast. The cave wall had transformed into something
magical. After the discovery of fire, Muniz declared "the dis
covery of representation is probably the second most impor
tant discovery in this world."
The process of creating art always demands the artist to
look away from their subject and paint from memory, even if
only for a split second, he explained. Therefore, Muniz con
cluded, "everything in the world is made up of moments of
blindness. The history of photography, the history of draw
ing...is the history of blindness." Muniz is a mind that is able
to draw on these moments of blindness for inspiration and
through them create artwork to give his audience a new way of
seeing.
