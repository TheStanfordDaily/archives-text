# Questions from "Gods"
## 
### 
FROM THE DESK OF
Kate Hayes

It seems that whenever I pick up a book of
late, either it starts reflecting my life, or
my life starts reflecting it, in very strange
ways. I don't really know how to distinguish
the two, but either way makes me suspicious
about the universe — suspicious about the
relationship between reality and fiction; suspi
cious about the nature of experience; and sus
piciousness tends to lead to curiosity.
Most recently, 1 was reading Neil
Gaiman's "American Gods," when flyers began
appearing around campus, calling "down with
all gods!" Perhaps not the most mind-blowing
coincidence, but the book centers on the
struggle between gods brought to America by
its immigrants, and the "modern" gods, like
media.

In the book, worship is the nourishment
the gods live on. Gods are brought into the
world by belief — and when they are forgot
ten, their rites no longer observed, they serve
as gas station clerks, and run funeral homes
and rob banks when they are particularly
strapped. They are not too different from our
human celebrities, aside from their lifespan.
Which is perhaps part of the point.
So what does it mean to say "down with
all gods"? Right here, right now, in 21st-centu
ry America? We are the nation with separation
of church and state written into its founding
values, and yet one of the most religious states
of the Western world. We are an extremely
multicultural, religiously diverse nation, and
yet we recite our national pledge as if we all
believe in the same, singular, god.
In the majority of human experience,
religion wasn't some module-piece of a per
son's life, available for removal in appropriate
situations, or emphasis in others, such as run

ning for public office. Asking someone what
their religion was would have been like asking
what type of food they ate. Today, we have
"Religious Views" as a place to stick a word or
two on our Facebook profiles.
So what is different? Is religion to us even
"religious" anymore? Or are our credit cards,
and our cars and our televisions what actually
serve as our shrines, our totems and our ora
cles? And if so, is that necessarily a bad thing?
They still give us a shared mind-set, a unifying
philosophy. They give us a common founda
tion from which to understand our experi
ence, and the experience of our neighbors. So
what if the seasons and celestial bodies no
longer hold us in awe? So what if we pilgrim
age to New York City instead of Jerusalem?
In "American Gods," the answer is given
by the fact that the "new gods" want to wipe
out the "old gods." But it is a drama that has
played out across the history of human cul
tural evolution: a conquering culture brings

with it its beliefs, and the old gods are left to
find new personalities and roles in the incom
ing pantheon or die out.
It's a useful analogy, though, for how we
all survive. Every time we move, through
space or time, we have to change, adapt to
new circumstances. None of us would have
survived at Stanford if we hadn't adapted to
this often quite quirky world. What is at times
more challenging to do is to remember and
honor our old selves, the ones who got us
here.
In Neil Gaiman's book, the gods struggle
with this question but it's also one of the most
pressing questions for our nation at large as
we approach this election and try to decide
where to take ourselves. What does it mean to
remember and respect our past, without get
ting stuck in it? How do we reach for the
future without destroying all the beautiful
things of our past?
