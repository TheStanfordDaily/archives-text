Kara's Cupcakes - Sprinkles
ain't the only show in town

Sprinkles cupcakcs have been everywhere
recently. At Old Union a few days ago, I
passed a table sprawling with the bak
ery's signature brown boxes, flecked with the
remnants of someone's luxurious snack. It
seems like everyone on campus has heard of,
if not been to, the novel new eatery. Sprinkles
has even reached Facebook — at one point,
my friend's status read simply, "SPRIN
KLES!!!!"
However, unbeknownst to many
Stanford students, Sprinkles isn't the only
gourmet cupcake bakery to have recently set
up shop in Palo Alto. Early last month, San
Francisco-based Kara's Cupcakes opened its
doors in Town & Country Village. Situated
prominently on a corner of the mall, next to
Rojoz Wraps and across the parking lot from
Cold Stone, Kara's Cupcakes is a tribute to the
modern appetite for the small and gourmet.
Its pink and brown color scheme and mini
malist interior design — the window display
is nothing but a row of delicate and perfect
cupcakes — sends its message: We recognize
that our product is cute and fun, but we're
serious about our cupcakes.
Kara's Cupcakes are made every day from
scratch, and use some of the Finest ingredients
money can buy: Scharffen Berger chocolate,
Giustos organic flour and milk from Clover
Dairy. And from these fine ingredients comes
a fine product. From the crispy-on-the-out
side, soft-on-the-inside cake to the rich,
mousse-like frosting, Kara's cupcakes are, in a
word, delicious.
However, like Sprinkles's cupcakes,
they're also expensive: Three dollars for a reg
ular cupcake and $3.25 for a cupcake filled
with jelly or creamy caramel. One thing that
Kara's has that Sprinkles doesn't have, howev
er, is the option of buying a $2.00 mini cup
cake. For my money, the mini cupcakes are
the best value. $2.00 gets you about four bites,
which, with rich cupcakes like these, is often
enough. In addition, since much of the charm
of Kara's or any cupcake shop is the novelty of
a gourmet cupcake, mini cupcakes allow you
to buy multiple different cupcakes for only a
mildly insane price.
As can be expected, the cupcakes them
selves are elegant and lavishly tasty. Kara's

cupcakes range from the basics, such as
Vanilla Chocolate (a classic made new with a
dark chocolate ganache) to the more exotic,
such as Passion Fruit and Fleur Dc Sel (which,
by the way, is French for "salt"). I will say that
my tasting partner and 1 were under
whelmed by the fruity cupcakes — the
Passion Fruit cupcake was dominated by an
utterly tasteless frosting, and the Coconut can
only be described as "mch" — but floored by
the rich Chocolate Velvet. Anyone who likes
their chocolate with personality and a little
zing will adore Kara's Chocolate Velvet.
So Kara's cupcakes are good ... very
good, even. But what separates them from
Sprinkles cupcakes? The short answer is noth
ing. From a consumer standpoint, Kara's cup
cakes and Sprinkles cupcakes are identical,
down to the Madagascar bourbon vanilla.
The long answer is that, in the context of their
respective shopping centers, Kara's and
Sprinkles may represent two very different
things. Whereas Sprinkles is just another in
the long list of upscale shops and eateries to
be found in the Stanford Shopping Center,
Kara's Cupcakes seems to be the most recent
step in Town & Country Village's journey
towards respectability. Its recent renovations
indicate that Town & Country is looking to
attract more upscale clientele. So look for
more boutique stores and restaurants to pop
up at the corner of Serra and El Camino in
the next few years. If Town & Country Village
does indeed become Stanford Shopping
Center Lite, we may have Kara's Cupcakes to
thank for it.

Cute and unassuming, Sprinkles
Cupcakes will lure you in
despite its out-the-door line

The concept of gourmet cupcakes is dif
ficult for some people to reconcile:
"I'm totally against it," one of my
friends exclaimed when the subject of
Sprinkles came up over lunch. "Funfetti cup
cakes are the best cupcakes I've ever tasted.
I'm sure Sprinkles cupcakes arc good, but
what's the point?"
What is the point? I heard her words
echoing in the back of my head as I wandered
to the end of the line in front of the store —
half a block long on a Friday afternoon.
And judging by the enormous line, it
seems as though the institution's reputation
has preceded it. I eavesdropped over countless
conversations that went along the lines of,
"Can you believe we've waited twenty min
utes for cupcakes? Can you believe these t

cupcakes are $3.25 each?""l know, but I hear
they're so worth it..."
In the last few years, the trend of "gour
met banal" cuisine has exploded into a full
blown force in the world of fashionable

food, seemingly impervious to the econom
ic crisis and demands of practicality. Flow
else could one explain the success of chains
like The Counter (gourmet burgers). Red

Mango (gourmet froyo), and Let's Be Frank

(gourmet hot dogs)'' If it
Sprinkles probably wouldn't hawrsft^

vived outside of L.A., but the Stanford
Shopping Center is actually the'fourth
§i

extra-L.A. territory that Sprinkles
conquered to date — with 16 lQqyji^M

opening in the near future.

The Sprinkles interior

design and layout is given its
own section on the SprinklesC
Web site, where it is said to
o evoke the "memory of
?European bakeries," whose
"pure material palette speaks

to the quality" of their

ingredients. When I finally
made it inside (after wait-

ing nearly half an hour),

European bakeries weren't

exactly the first thing on my

mind, but the natural light and

open space were surprisingly

refreshing.
The employee who took my order was
very friendly, seemingly unfazed by the mass
es of people clamoring to get inside, and
moments later, I was presented with four cup
cakes — red velvet, vanilla, chai latte and
peanut butter chocolate — wrapped delicate
ly in a brown box and sealed with a pink and
brown Sprinkles sticker.
I chose two "basic" and two "specialty"
cupcake flavors: the former available every
day, and the latter only on certain days of the
week. The specialty flavors, ranging from
banana and pumpkin to chocolate coconut
and ginger lemon, are the truly dangerous
ones, because unlike ice cream shops, there is
no "sampling" at Sprinkles. It is tempting to
buy at least one specialty flavor. All of a sud
den, you went from buying one vanilla cup-
