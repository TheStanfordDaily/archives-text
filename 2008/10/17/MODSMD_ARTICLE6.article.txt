# Hidden gems of Green Library

### 
While it is a universally acknowl
edged Stanford truth that the
Green Library Media & Microtext
Center houses virtually every DVD ever
made, students far too often fail to recognize
this as they rent one generic new release after
another. Luckily, Intermission is here to solve
the problem. What follows is a list of docu
mentaries available at Green that might not
have caught your attention yet, but certainly
deserve to.
The King of Kong: A Fistful of Quarters
(2007)

In my mind, the best documentaries
take a subject you find completely irrelevant
and persuasively demonstrate why the topic
is in fact the only thing worth caring about.
Seth Gordon's "The King of Kong" achieves
this sensation masterfully by taking on the
fringiest of fringe topics — '80s arcade
games — and bringing us into a crazily com
pelling world of good vs. evil. When a movie
about the original Donkey Kong has the
entire Paloma lounge on the verge of tears,
I'd say it's been made well.
The movie follows the story of two men
as they vie to break the Donkey Kong world
record: Steve Wcibe, a down-on-his-luck,
stay-at-home dad who never seems to have
the ball (or in this case the barrel) bounce
his way, and Billy Mitchell.
If you watch this movie, you will still
think and talk about Billy Mitchell months
later. It's impossible to believe that this fan
tastically flamboyant "Sauce King of Florida,"
with his perfectly coiffed mullet and his
American flag neckties actually exists. He is
cocky and mean, actually saying things like,
"No matter what I say, it draws controversy.
It's sort of like the abortion issue." He is the
consummate video game villain, and you will
never have so much fun hating someone.
Every second of this movie is eye-pop
ping. Yes, it's true that many Stanford stu-

dents are hardcore gamers, but none of us
spend 48 straight hours analyzing video
game footage and looking for glitches. We
don't have any of the politics and sabotage
that apparently plague the arcade communi
ty. We definitely don't have any Billy
Mitchells. But for 79 transcendent minutes,
he can be all yours.
The War Room (1993)

If you're a Poli Sci major and you
haven't seen "The War Room," you're basical
ly like a bio major who's never dissected a
frog. Chris Hegedus and D.A. Pennebaker's
behind-the-scenes look at how a presidential
campaign runs — in this case, Bill Clinton's
race for President in '92 — is filled with
everything anyone could want in a political
drama: nutty characters, unsubstantiated
slander and more spin than a dreidel. Best of
all, the stories are all absolutely true and pre
sented plainly, without potentially manipula
tive devices such as narration and music.
Yes, that's right; the movie is pure
footage, which from today's perspective
makes everything even crazier. We get to see,
as it happens, Bill Clinton ducking charges of
womanizing for the first time like he's been
doing it his whole life (well, I guess he has).
We're privy to James Carville delivering bril
liant speeches off the top of his head before
he became a ridiculous caricature of himself.
We even get to see Hillary before her hair
started looking like a cheap rip-off of Kim
Jong Il's!
In addition, this movie contains several
startling parallels between the 1992 election
and today's race that make it seem oddly
prescient and even more fascinating. The
whole situation is so familiar. On the one
hand there are the Democrats with their can

didate of hope maintaining a constant focus
on the failing economy; on the other hand
there are the Republicans touting their expe
rienced candidate and his intellectually-chal
lenged running mate (sorry, couldn't resist).
It's enough to make a viewer wonder if poli
tics have always been like this, and if things
will ever change.
No. They probably won't. So you should
check out "The War Room" and see what the
games all about.
Born Rich (2003)

While it's true that many of the best
movies expand your worldview and teach
you important lessons about life, sometimes
you just want to laugh at people. For these
times, I present you with "Born Rich."
Directed by Jamie Johnson, heir to the
Johnson & Johnson shampoo and baby oil
fortune, this documentary is all about what
it's like to grow up with a net worth of bil
lions when you haven't contributed a cent.
The unfathomably rich young adults in this
movie come across in a variety of different
ways: spoiled, arrogant, selfish and petty.
Okay. Maybe not so much variety. Still,
as unlikable as a lot of the kids are, it's hard
not to feel somewhat bad for the guy who
was always told he was poor growing up, but
then had his uncle take him to Grand
Central Station where he was told point
blank, Mufasa-style: "You own this place."
The basic message of the movie is that too
much money can be as destructive as having
no money at all, and it's an admirable and

surprisingly salient point. Regardless of what
shows like "90210" claim, the problems of
the very wealthy don't always revolve around
sexy secrets. More often than not, it's bore
dom and lack of purpose that characterize
their lifestyles.
And hey, even if you don't want all of
those philosophical revelations, it's still just a
very entertaining movie about a bunch of
bitchy kids.
Man on Wire (2008)

James Marsh's "Man on Wire" is still in
theaters and, obviously, not yet available in
Green. This recent release, which chronicles
Philippe Petit's 1974 high-wire walk between
the Twin Towers, can be described as simply
delightful.
But maybe "delightful" isn't enough; this
movie clicks on seemingly every level. It's
exhilarating, it's amusing, it's emotional, it's
bizarre. It makes me want to learn French, it
makes me want to try tightrope walking, and
it even places another powerful and inspiring
image in my head that I can associate with
the World Trade Center to counter 9/11.
This movie is still playing at the
Aquarius in Palo Alto, and for a limited time
only, I'm sure. I wholeheartedly recommend
making what I know is the Herculean effort
to get off campus, because "Man on Wire" is
as fun as movies get.
