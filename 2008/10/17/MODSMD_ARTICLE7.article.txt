Making odds, ends and stones into wearable baubles?
Gea Kang talks with students who are making jewelry their

She pulls out a gold necklace adorned with a shard of
chandelier glass and a small, antique-looking key.
"My brother makes fun of me for obsessing over a key,
but I love this piece so much," says Amy Saper '11, while
straightening out the chain carefully.
And not just because it contains legit, 24K gold or rem
nants of 19th century France — she also made it herself.
Saper, a former PoliSci and current MS&E major, is one
of a handful of non-art majors here at Stanford who devote
their time to making jewelry.
"You know, I haven't met anyone at Stanford who does
it," she says.
Well, as it turns out, she does have some company.
"Falling apart, imperfect, old and decayed": Lauren Nguyen
'11
For Lauren Nguyen '11, an economics major also consid
ering a double major in digital humanities, it all started in
middle school, when her family started researching jewelry to
get her mother a new ring.
A self-proclaimed "opportunist" who uses "odd things
that you find and don't realize you can make into new jewel
ry," Nguyen is "really into coral from Fiji, locks, screws, safety
pins, feathers."
"Oh, and I'm obsessed with zippers — it's kind of scary,"
she adds. "I really like things that are falling apart, imperfect,
asymmetrical, old and decayed."
"There's really no limit to what you can use to make jew
elry — you're only limited by what you can think of," she
says,"and physics, 1 guess."
Nguyen derives a lot of her inspiration from designers
such as crystal carver Rene Lalique, Dior and Rodarte, and
architects like Frank Lloyd Wright.
Nguyen hopes to continue jewelry-making classes that
she took in San Francisco a few years ago, but time is always
an issue during the school year.
"1 just do it for fun," she says. "My friends will ask me to
make stuff for them, like for their sister's birthday. But I only
got to finish 10 pieces last year, and I miss it."
"Creating some sort of spectacle": Wayne Hwang'o9
Wayne Hwang '09, a pre-med biology major who plans on

becoming a reconstructive plastic surgeon, has been able to
meld his creations into campus life.
Hwang has a diverse and long-standing background in
the arts, ranging from being a Juilliard-rccruited pianist, 2D
art concentration in high school, hair stylist, model in
Manhattan, costume designer for Cardinal Ballet and
founder of Stanford's annual Charity Fashion Show. Yet
despite his many hats, jewelry has been a mainstay of sorts.
It all started when, the summer before high school, his
aunt taught him how to bead. Hwang soon became a design
er for The Bead Monkey in Minnesota, where he went to
high school. His work was a hit at school as well, selling par
ticularly well during prom season.
Now, Hwang's favorite materials include Swarovski crys
tals, recycled pieces and metal.
As for his style?
"Sophisticated edgy."
"1 really like making jewelry pieces for a runway, stuff
that's big and flashy so that you'll go, 'Whoa,"' he says. "You
want to make a statement — something kind of outrageous
but clean and very sophisticated. Basically, I'm trying to cre
ate some sort of spectacle."
When asked where he gets his inspiration, Hwang
promptly says: "Whatever goes through my head. Someone's
attic and a tornado went through it — that's probably what
my head looks like."
He says that whatever environment he happens to be in
is the ultimate source, particularly when around people in
metropolitan areas.
Whatever it is, it seems to be working.
Hwang receives about 20 orders per month just in the
Bay Area, and he still works for The Bead Monkey back in
Minnesota. His freshman year, he had 125 orders to complete
in one month during finals season.
"I've always been into the arts," says Hwang of his per
haps unexpected interest in jewelry, "but 1 never thought I'd
be continuing in the industry, because I didn't know what I'd
do with it."
"It's not just about presenting your idea — you have to
be prudent about it,"he says, readjusting his position to lean
in closer. "You have to be able to sell it. A lot of artists make
stuff like me, but they don't necessarily think about market
ing. I'm also thinking about the practicality of business. I
pretty much sell so that I can be an artist."

"Everyone from grandmas to girls": Amy Saper '11
Saper would likely agree.
She and a high school friend, Kay Ousterhout, started
Kosa Designs (a mix of their names) as their high-school
senior project.
"We both love pretty gold jewelry that you'd find in bou
tiques but that are so overpriced, so we were interested in
seeing how much the components cost and how hard it'd be
to make it ourselves," Saper says.
She's found that it isn't difficult, really.
"Nothing really takes more than two hours," she says.
"But there's definitely a learning curve to making it pretty."
"We used to subtly take phones into boutiques and take
pictures," Saper remembers. "We taught ourselves how to do
wire working and used online tutorials. We seriously used a
creme brulee torch to do soldering."
Now, they've already designed their third collection for
downtown Palo Alto's Romi Boutique, for which they are on
consignment, and their creations even boast a professional
"Kosa"-imprinted gold tag.
Specializing in necklaces, Kosa primarily makes nature
pieces, especially leaves and sea life dipped in 24K gold. Saper
describes them as "pretty contemporary, not too edgy and
catering to universal taste. Everyone from grandmas to girls
who have tastes so different from mine look for our stuff."
Saper, whose dream is to work for Google, would love to
have a career flexible enough to accommodate jewelry-mak
ing on the side as well — if not just for the love of it, then
also for its practicality.
"It's very gratifying when 1 find something online for
$200 and then make it myself for a quarter of the price," she
says.
"I can't just fly to Paris"
As with many artists, these students face obstacles that
put a strain on production.
"The hardest part is finding materials," Saper says. "In
this area, there aren't that many places. We've had special
requests for chandelier pieces, but sorry, I can't just fly to
Paris for a weekend."
Hwang also commented that if he weren't a designer for
The Bead Monkey, "it would be very financially difficult."
However, resourcefulness is also a merit.
