# FiLM REVIEW
## Gross-out sex comedy meets teenage angst in this needlessly complicated film 
### 
Ever since the success of "Superbad,"
there seems to be a wave of teenage
comedies storming the big screen. The
problem with this is that not only does
watching two male best friends trying to get
laid for the ump-teenth time get boring, but
the actors that play these roles seem to be
getting younger by the minute. Gone are the
likes of Jason Biggs and Shannon Elizabeth,
leaving us with relatively unknown actors
that all look like they are still going through
puberty.
Age hang-ups aside, "Sex Drive" contin
ues along the teenage comedy trend, deliver
ing a movie that revolves around teenagers
going on a drive for ... (surprise!) sex. The
main character, lan, is a squawky high
schooler whose voice seems to crack every
time he becomes flustered. Played by actor
Josh Zuckerman, lan starts off the film with
the self declaration that he is tired of being a
virgin, and he adds to this bravado by engag
ing in naughty online chatting where he
meets Ms. Tasty.
After much coercion from his best
friend, wannabe smooth-talker Lance (Clark
Duke), lan and company begin their road
trip to meet up with the mysterious Ms.
Tasty. However, their road trip is complicated
by the fact that lan's female best friend,
Felicia (Amanda Crew), also goes along for
the ride. This little detail becomes awkward
when we discover that lan has feelings for

her; a fact that almost anyone in the audi
ence can see from a mile away.
Once they all begin the road trip, you
can pretty much surmise what happens.
The three of them have their fare share of
wild and crazy detours, including a mem- A
orable encounter with an Amish conclave, J|
before finally reaching their destination

— all with semi-hilarious results. I

won't go into any detail about

what happens in the end,
but I will say that 1 was

pleasantly surprised with it,
and glad that it did not end
on a typical cliche.

So what makes this film
different from others like it?
Unfortunately, not a whole
lot. The film readily makes
use of its "R" rating, throw
ing a lot of gross humor and

nudity at you. As wacky as the film gets,
another one of its faults is that some scenes
are just plain stupid and illogical. For exam
ple, lan complains about being a virgin and
not being able to pick up girls for the entire
movie, yet when he is at a party in the begin
ning of the film, he completely fails to "seal
the deal" with an attractive girl that literally
throws herself at him. Nonsensical humor is
great, but there is such a thing as too stupid.
The biggest problem with this film was
that it tried to combine two distinct genres

[ into one. Even
though similar
audiences would
probably enjoy
both "Superbad"
and "40 Year Old
Virgin," it does not

necessarily mean that elements from both
should be combined. Basically, it was just a
bit odd seeing teenagers barely out of puber
ty engaging in pretty graphic sexual behav
iors, something that mainstream audiences
probably are not used to ... yet. This is not
to say that teenagers and wild sex can never
be combined, but the way in which "Sex
Drive" attempted to do so did not feel right.
This was also augmented by the fact that the
main cast of teenagers (who really do look
like teenagers) are all unknown actors that
will probably end up being one-hit wonders

when this film is over.
What ultimately saves this film (and I'm
using the word "save" very lightly) are some
laugh-out-loud hilarious sequences and per
formances, most notably seasoned actors
James Marsden and Seth Green. All of the
scenes with the donut costume also stand
out.
"Sex Drive" makes for a funny if not stu
pid movie-going experience that is filled with
just enough laughs to justify seeing it in the
aters. Of course, this is all assuming that you
do not mind seeing teenagers younger than
yourself engaging in disturbing (yet some
times hilarious) behaviors. Have fun with
those mental images.
