# DVD REVIEW
## Third season of "Robot Chicken" hits DVD 
### 
Do you like having your childhood bastardized? Do
you enjoy seeing familiar characters in unfamiliar,
hilarious and often horrifically inappropriate scenar
ios? Would you watch a sketch casting Speedy Gonzalez and
Dora the Explorer as illegal immigrants? If you answered yes to
any of the above questions, then "Robot Chicken" — whose
season three DVD was released Oct. 7 — just might be the
show for you.
A proprietary series of Cartoon Network's "Adult Swim"
late-night programming, the Emmy-award winning "Robot
Chicken" is actor Seth Green and writer Mathew Seinrich's
baby. Starting in 2005, the show is now officially in its fourth
season, having just released a double-disc set containing the
complete third season. It still retains some of the highest ratings
on the network and completely dominates the 18-24 age brack
et.
The show itself is a stop-motion animated comedy sketch
series, primarily featuring dolls or caricatures of famous people,
characters and pop culture phenomena that runs in 11-minute
episodes. The episodes themselves are just combinations of clips
ranging from a few minutes to a couple seconds that will fea
ture everything from Optimus Prime getting transplant surgery
to a mini-series of adventures between Adam and Eves replace
ment, Steve. The characters are voiced by Green, Seinrich and
fellow writers, as well as a plethora of celebrity guest stars
including such folks as Lance Bass, George Lucas, Paul Rudd,

Joss Wheadon and "Weird Al" Yankovic.
Season three continues the "Chicken" tradition with pride,
featuring all the profanity, gore and creativity that have made
the show so popular in its first two seasons. The sketches are
eclectic, the writing is hysterical and the animation and voice
work is absolutely superb. Green and company continue to find
brand new perspectives on extremely old pop culture institu
tions and provide for hours of endless comedy.
Also included on the DVDs is a cornucopia of little extras
that should make any fan of the show squeal with glee. One can
find alternative audio/voiceovers, deleted sketches, a gag reel,
commentary, video blogs and even a studio tour crammed into
these two discs.
The majority of the special features are wonderful addi
tions. The gag reels in particular are tear-inducing streaks of
hilarity. The studio tour, when coupled with the video blogs,
provides a very interesting look into the production, inner
workings, and process that every episode goes through before
hitting your television screen.
Unfortunately, the weakest addition to the DVDs is the
commentary. The structure of the commentary is inconsistent
at best, with some episodes giving very good insight into the
creative spark behind particular sketches and others spending
the entire episode's commentary as a series of inside jokes and
"remember when [x] did [y]?" stories. It's truly hit-or-miss and
while some fans of the show may enjoy some of the insider

humor, most will probably find it not worth their time.
Overall, the "Robot Chicken: Season Three" DVD set is a
complete and fantastic package. Featuring an overabundance of
special features, as well as every episode, blooper and deleted
scene from the third season, this is a must-own for any die-hard

"Robot
Chicken" fan.
New viewers
may find the
sheer quantity
of "Chicken
Nuggets," as
they are play
fully called, a
little over
whelming and
may want to
opt to tune in

to a few episodes before deciding on whether or not to make
the purchase. But for any fan of the series, make sure you plan a
trip to the store to snag this DVD set as soon as you can.
