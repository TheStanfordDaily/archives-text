# STUDENT GROUPS
## High-schoolers make a Splash! on campus Visiting students take wide range of classes 
### THOMAS YEH 
Carefully stenciled signs decorated
the pillars of the Main Quad on
Saturday morning, directing the more
than 550 visiting high-school and mid
die-school students toward the room
assignments printed neatly on their
crisp, individualized course schedules
for the day.
Ihe students — grades seven to 12.
and many with parents in tow — were
attending Splash!, a day-long event
organized by the Stanford
Educational Studies Program (ESP).
The event aimed to provide young
students from all across the Bay Area
with the chance to learn a number of
exciting new subjects in an enriching
campus environment.
Ihe pre-registered students had
handpicked their own course load
from an extensive online catalogue of
1()6 classes.The courses ranged widely
from technical courses like Solving
Problems with Probabilistic/Statistical
Algorithms and Credit Crisis 101 to
interactive ones on Ultimate Frisbee
and Nico Nico Douga (an in-depth
tutorial on navigating through the
world of Japanese Internet memes).
"We have so much fun doing this,"
said Michael Shaw, president of the
Stanford ESP. "And that plays a really
big part in making this program such a
success."
ESP was originally formed in 1957
at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and has steadily been
growing over the years, with approxi
mately 1.700 participants attending the
last event at Mi l. Ihe program was
first developed for Stanford in the mid
"90s but soon fizzled out due to a lack
of commitment.
Shaw, formerly an undergraduate
student at MIT who had been the
director of ESP there for a number of
years, revived the Stanford chapter in
the spring of 2008 shortly after his

arrival as a graduate student.
The visible commitment and
enthusiasm of the program's new
teachers played a large role in its suc
cessful revival. The classes are all
taught by a voluntary faculty com
prised of Stanford students, affiliates
and members of the Bay Area com
munity. Ihe instructions given to the
teachers were simple.
"We say: "Teach anything you want
as long as it's not illegal' — that's what
we tell every one of our teachers,"
Shaw said. "What you get out of that is
a teacher who chooses a topic that's
something they love to do. And when
you get students who can find some
thing they really like from this entire
spread of classes, you get a classroom
environment where everyone wants
to be there, and the activation energy
for learning goes down tremendous
ly."
Frank Lin i(), an electrical engi
neering major who joined Stanford
ESP at its inception, designed a class
last spring on solving the Rubik's
Cube. This quarter, he decided to
teach one on computer architecture.
"I love teaching and inspiring peo
ple," he said. "There really is nothing
else like it. It's all about the satisfac
tion of getting someone else excited
about engineering."
Anton Andryeyev and Ignacio
Ihayer, two employees at Google
who have been working on the
Machine Translation project for three
years, joined the Stanford ESP faculty
this fall to jointly talk about their
work.
"We're looking for some insight
ourselves," Andryeyev said. "We've
been looking at this stuff so much on
an everyday basis, so it helps to get
some fresh perspective from students
who are just getting interested in
Internet technology. It's reverse-teach
ing."
The students arrived early in the
morning with smiling faces, eager to
learn something new on their day off.
Many high-school students were hop
ing to get a more in-depth look at spe
cific topics of interest not offered in

their weekday curriculum.
Alexey Veronin, a junior at Gunn
High School, attended Shaw's
acclaimed course: On Black I loles.
Singularities, and the Event I lorizon:
A Journey.
"I'm really looking to expand my
knowledge on the things I know I'm

interested in." he said. "This is some
thing I see myself getting into."
Michael Burks, a home-schooled
high-school student and second-time
attendee of Splash!, brought his moth
er to the on-site registration.
"I like the opportunity for him to
he with other kids, to experience life

on a college campus, and really to
experience a variety of different top
ics," Mrs. Burks said.
Other students had different rea
sons for attending Stanford ESP.
Rachel Mvint of Fernando Rivera
Middle School had her mother drive
her from Daly Citv so that she could

spend her 13th birthday attending the
program.
"I just want to know what I want to
be when I grow up." Myint said, "and
this program will help."

Students enjoy a class on collage making as part of the Educational Studies Program (ESP). The classes are all taught by voluntary faculty comprised of
Stanford students, affiliates and members of the Bay Area community.
