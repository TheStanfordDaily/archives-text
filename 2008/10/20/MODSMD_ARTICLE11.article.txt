## EDITORIAL SLS protest not best way to end Don't Ask, Don't Tell 
### 
Stanford Law School has a long-standing
and admirable nondiscrimination poli
cy. which states that "Stanford Law
School makes its facilities and services open
only to employers who do not discriminate
on the basis of age, religion, disability, ethnic
background, national origin, gender, race,
sexual orientation, or veteran status, or any
other characteristic protected by applicable
law." But for years, this policy has complicat
ed the recruiting efforts of a discriminatory
employer with a lot of clout: the Department
of Defense.
Because of the military's well-known
Don't Ask. Don't Tell policy, the Stanford
Law School had admirably refused assis
tance and access to recruiters for the mili
tary's Judge Advocate General (JAG)
Corps for years, but a 2000 amendment to
the law made this position untenable. Hie
new version of the law would have denied
Stanford University — not just the law
school — funding and grants from several
government agencies, including the De
partments of Energy and Health and
Human Services, if it continued to bar the
military from recruiting on campus.
Forced to allow the military recruiters
access to SLS facilities, several faculty
members got together a drafted a letter
that is now sent to all SLS students every
semester. The letter details the history of
this contentious issue, respectfully out
lines the faculty members' strong opposi
tion to the military's discriminatory hiring
policies and politely asks any students who
wish to meet with recruiters to do so off
campus in order to "declare your support
for the law school's nondiscrimination
policy and your respect for those of your
colleagues whose expression of sexual ori
entation disqualifies them for military
service." The letter is cosigned by Dean
Larry Kramer and dozens of other SLS
faculty.
While we agree with the sentiments of
the letter and are dismayed that the De
partment of Defense can effectively extort
the University to permit its recruiting activ
ities on campus, the editorial board is un
sure that this is the best way to address the
issue or voice a well-founded opposition to
the military's hiring practices.
We must remember that both the out
moded Don't Ask. Don't Tell policy and the

exorbitant sanctions for prohibiting on
campus recruiting are congressionally
mandated and not policies that the JAG
Corps or even the military at large could
overturn on its own initiative. As SLS facul
ty members note in their letter,"JAG Corps
service is noble work."
While being asked to interview off-cam
pus is no great burden on students, the let
ter may tend to create an atmosphere of
contention between former servicemen
and women who feel the Law School is
adopting an anti-military stand and those
who rightly decry this kind of discrimina
tion. We hope that students who choose to
go through the interview process are not
belittled by their peers and do not fear re
proach from faculty.
We feel the objective of SLS's nondis
criminatory policy, at least in part, is to en
courage employers to adopt nondiscrimi
natory hiring standards in order to access
the trove of potential talent in the school's
student body. But this mechanism breaks
down when dealing with the military re
cruiters, because the SLS can no longer use
access as a wedge to encourage the military
to update its hiring practices. The best
protests are the ones that effect the most
change, and the way to change Don't Ask.
Don't Tell is to influence our representa
tives in Washington to pass a new law.
Instead, the editorial board would have
welcomed a joint statement from students
and faculty voicing a school-wide opposi
tion to employer discrimination — backed
by Iraq War vets. LGBT leaders and faculty
members alike — and a renewed effort to
end Don't Ask. Don't Tell through the leg
islative process.
It is unquestionably a shame that the
Department of Defense, in concert with
Congress, can force SLS to provide access
to recruiters that violate its principles and
standards. But the Stanford Law School, in
response to this heavy-handed treatment
from the Department of Defense, has re
sponded in a manner that the editorial
board believes is not the best way for SLS
to address the issue. While we share SLS's
strong disapproval of the military's un
equal hiring practices, we are still looking
for a more constructive way to one day end
the institutionalized discrimination of
Don't Ask, Don't Tell.
