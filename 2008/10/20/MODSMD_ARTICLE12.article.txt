# The

## The

### 
Watching John McCain and Barack
Obama debate is like watching Andy
Roddick play Roger Federer in a
tennis match.
For those who aren't tennis buffs, Federer
is arguably the best tennis player of all time.
He moves gracefully and effortlessly around
the court, making difficult shots look easy and
easy shots look like child's play. He's cool,
composed and collected. Roddick, on the
other hand, is a true-and-blue American hot
head who was once on the path to becoming
the world's No. 1 player — and was for a few
weeks, until Federer came along and squashed
him every step of the way
Most of their matches look something like
this: Roddick races around the court chasing
down Federer's strategically angled shots,
and when Roddick finally sees an opportuni
ty to close out a point,Federer hits an immac
ulate winner. By the end of the match, Rod
dick is drenched in sweat while Federer looks
like he hasn't lifted a finger. 'ITiis happens
game after game, match after match. And yet
Roddick still claims that he can beat Federer.
Does this story sound familiar?
Despite Obama's romping of McCain in
the first two debates, McCain came into the
third promising to "whip his you-know
what." This one would be different, he told
supporters. And it was. But the result was the
same — he lost. The truth is, Obama didn't
need to do much to win. All he had to do was
hold his ground.
Obama excelled best when on defense,
undermining McCain's accusations with a
simple,"That just isn't true." He nimbly skirt
ed issues about his associations with Bill
Ayres and ACORN, providing part of the
story without revealing the damning details.
He said nothing about how Ayres held a
fundraiser at his home to kick off Obama's
campaign for the Illinois legislature and

nothing about how, before last November's
voter registration fraud scandal hit. Obama
said that "I've been fighting alongside
ACORN on issues you care about my entire
career." Nor did he mention his promise to sit
down with ACORN and other community
organi/ers to create his presidential agenda.
The thing is, Obama didn't need to lie to
win the debate. He just didn't have to tell the
whole truth.
Suddenly put on the defensive, McCain
looked like the liar, not Obama. His winners
turned into points for Obama. For example,
McCain claimed Obama's health plan would
fine small businesses if they didn't provide
health insurance to their employees, but
Obama explained that only big businesses
would be fined. Why didn't McCain follow
up and ask how Obama defined small and big
businesses?
Talking so much about how Obama's tax
and health plans would hurt "Joe the
Plumber" bogged down McCain's game. The
strategy had a lot of potential, but McCain's
execution failed. He wasn't quick enough on
his feet. To win. McCain needed more shots
in his arsenal and more fuel in his tank.
There's no doubt that McCain trained hard

for the debate. But he needed to push his op
ponent harder. He needed to make Obama
work.There were so many issues he eould have
raised but didn't. For instance. McCain didn't
mention that Obama's plan to cut taxes for 95
percent of working families is a farce — 38
percent of people don't earn enough to owe in
come taxes. Under Obama's plan, that number
would rise to 4X percent, according to the Tax
Policy Center. So nearly half of the public
would receive some kind of government re
bate/subsidy/credit— welfare in essence —
funded by the top five percent of taxpayers.
That sounds fine ... if you like socialism.
Nor did McCain mention that Obama had
said he wouldn't repeal the Bush tax cuts in a
bad economy because repealing the tax cuts
would just hurt the economy even more. Fie
didn't mention that Obama had said that he
would increase capital gains taxes for the
purpose of social justice even though raising
capital gains taxes has shown to actually de
crease total revenue. McCain didn't mention
that the Chicago Annenberg Challenge that
Obama chaired, and for which he raised $160
million, failed miserably. And he didn't men
tion that Obama told the American Teachers
Federation earlier this year that education
reform amounted to "tired rhetoric about
vouchers and school choice."
All lost opportunities.
McCain put up a good fight, but he still
came up short. He just didn't have the finesse
to spin issues like Obama. In the end,Obama
may not be more qualified for president, but
he is a better politician and strategist. Re
turning hard balls with breathtaking compo
sure. he showed that he knows that the best
offense is a good defense.
