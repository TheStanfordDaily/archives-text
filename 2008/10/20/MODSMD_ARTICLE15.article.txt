# Letter to the Editor
## 
### 
I read the editorial in the Oct. 17 issue
of The Daily titled "Turning the Red
Zone Loose." Aside from being im
pressed by the many points that were
brought up. I was encouraged to find that
there are others who are voicing concern
and frustration at the current state of the
Red Zone.
I am an avid football fan and friends
with much of the team, and I go to every
home game several hours early just to
secure a front-row seat behind the team
bench. In the past several games, most
notably the Oct. 13 game vs. Arizona, I
have been sorely disappointed and upset
that the section has been roped off to ex
clude students instead of being exclu
sively/or students.
I have been talking to team members
and fellow student fans about the issue
since last Saturday, and just finished a let
ter to petition the situation. I am hoping
to get enough student support signatures
to send the letter to the Athletics Depart
ment (or rather. Athletics Marketing, as

mentioned in the editorial) hv the next
home game, against Washington State on
Nov. 1.
Hopefully we will see the Red Zone
filled with students by then!
