## SOCCER WOES CONTINUE 
### JACOB JOHNSON DESK EDITOR 
There was a heavy dose of cruel irony in Sat
urday's men's soccer game. In a year in which
the Stanford men have suffered through seem
ingly countless last-minute losses, this game fit
into the season's pattern all too well. But no one
expected the final slip-up to come from the
team's most consistent contributor, goalkeeper
John Moore.
Moore, a junior, has anchored the Cardinal
defense for the past two seasons. His athleticism
and hard work have been well-documented,
and the results on the field speak for themselves.
Last year. Moore started 10 of the team's 18
games, notched 23 saves and allowed only 1.07
goals per game. As a full-time starter in 2008, he
has 58 saves in just 13 contests. Opposing teams
are scoring less than one goal per game against
the Cardinal keeper.
But in Saturday's game between Stanford
and No. 13 California, the fatal mistake was
Moore's. A Cal cross in the 92nd minute went
wide left, and the junior goalie glided just out
side the post to catch the ball.
"As soon as the ball was hit. I was thinking,
'easy, easy does it.'" said redshirt junior Josh
Nesbit. "He has no support. There were six Cal

guys in the box, and maybe two Stanford guvs."
Despite the Bears' good positioning, no one
on the Stanford bench was worried — and they
certainly weren't expecting to see what hap
pened next.
The ball slipped though Moore's hands and
bounced towards the center of the goal. One of
Cal's attackers tapped the ball into the back of
the net.
Game over.
"I see him catch that ball regularly... one
handed." Nesbit said.
Moore collapsed onto the field, covering his
face. While the Bears celebrated, Moore's team
mates immediately helped him to his feet.
"I don't think anyone had to say anything [to
him]," said sophomore forward Bobby War
shaw."He'sa smart guv. We were just letting him
know we are there for him."
'The Stanford offense is especially apprecia
tive of their goalie's efforts. As Warshaw put it.
the "forwards have cost us a lot of games" with
their inability to convert scoring chances. They
are well aware that Moore and the Cardinal de
fense have carried the team for much of the sea
son.
"We weren't blaming him at all." added red
shirt freshman Garett Gunther.

GAME NOTES: The hard-luck season continues for the Card

games to secure a spot in the NCAA tournament. New
Mexico has won three of their last four contests.

proached Moore right alter the game.
"I went right up to him and said,' You know
we were in that game because of you.'"
Moore's response:'it doesn't matter."
Though he may blame himself for the loss,
it's clear that Moore's teammates do not. They
aren't worried about him being too hard on

himself either. To Moore, successes and failures
seem to motivate him equally.
"He gets motivated by positive and negative
occurrences," Nesbit said after Sunday's post
game practice. "We came out [Sunday] at prac
tice — 10 a.m., and he was as sharp as ever."
The real story of the game was Stanford's
continued inability to score. The teams were
even in shot attempts with 12, but the Cardinal
only managed two shots on goal while 10 of
Cal's tries were on target. Senior Tom Mont
gomery and sophomore Cameron I .amming led
the team with three shots apiece, and Gunther
added two shots of his own.
But many of the shots were wide or sailed
high — some of the shots were so far off that
fans began joking that the team has been using
50-foot-high goals in practice.
But Stanford has not let this season's disap
pointments break its spirit.
"Looking back, reflecting on it. it's kind of
tough to put the last couple games into words,"
Warshaw said. "I think it says a lot about our
team that we still get along [despite the tough
losses]."
The Cardinal's positive attitude comes from
the team's solid play throughout the season.

"We played well" Warshaw said.
"It's just the one aspect that matters
so much [scoring]."
"We're playing well," Gunther
agreed. "We've just got to keep going
and start finishing chances."
Stanford heads to Albuquerque
next Friday to take on a New Mexico
team that prides itself on being a "soc
cer school." The Lobos are 6-5-2 on
the season.
Stanford must win the remaining
six games on its schedule to qualify
for the NCAA Tournament. It may
sound like a daunting task, but the
Cardinal men think it is a very real
possibility
"We should have won 12 of 13
games [this year), so we can still win
six in a row," Warshaw said.
Afterall.it could be just a matter of
time before the Cardinal gets on a roll.
"It's going to click, whether it's
next game, in three games, or the first
game of next year." Warshaw said.
"It's going to click."
