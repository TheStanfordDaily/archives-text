# Bears record rare win at Stanford, 3-1
## 
### DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
For the first time in seven years
and only the sixth time in program
history, the California women's vol
leyball team defeated Stanford. The
No. 4 Golden Bears pulled off a mild
upset victory yesterday. 23-25,25-22,
'25-19, 27-25 on the road at Maples
Pavilion.
The Stanford women (15-3, 6-1
Pacific-10 Conference) started off
strong with a first-set victory but
passing woes and unforced errors
plagued them in later sets. But some
credit has to go to the relentless Cal
attack and the Bears' tough defense.
"Cal played great, give them a lot
of credit." head coach John Dunning
said. "They have some young players
on the court who really handled [the
pressure]."
Sophomore outside hitter Alix
Klineman had a big game for Stan
ford with 21 kills, 12 digs and four
blocks. Senior Foluke Akinradewo
also chipped in 12 kills and 7 blocks
and senior Cynthia Barbo/.a added
14 kills. But those big numbers could
n't stop Cal's Hana Cutura. who
pounded a match-high 23 kills and
had 12 digs.Tarah Murrey also had 14
kills for the Bears (17-1,7-0).
After trading points back and
forth in the first set. Stanford found
itself trailing 20-17. But three kills by
Klineman brought it back to a tie at
20-20. Klineman's kills were all
placed in different parts of the court
and all had different speeds on them.
A few plays later. Barboza
knocked a kill out of bounds and Cal
led 23-21. But after a kill by Akin
radewo. a block bv Barboza and jun
ior Janet Okogbaa, and a Cal hitting
error, Stanford had match point at
24-23. An excellent dig by senior Jes
sica Fishburn set up Barboza and she
pounded a kill to clinch the first set,
25-23.
The second set saw Stanford
come out and take a 5-3 lead on an
Akinradewo block. Cal stayed close
with kills from Cutura, but Akin
radewo kept Stanford ahead with
two kills to make it 10-9. But Cal
rolled off six straight points to take
the lead 15-10. Stanford's passing
woes continued, and Cal found itself
with match point at 24-19.The Cardi
nal was able to salvage some points
to bring it to 24-22, but a Cutura kill
down the line sealed the set for the
Bears.
Stanford's struggles in the second
set were evident by its hitting per
centage, which fell to .222 from .323
in the first.
Two out-of-bounds kills by Bar
boza helped Cal lead 8-6 in the third
set. But Barboza recovered with a
big kill to make it 8-7. A kill by Cutu
ra and another by Murrey put Cal up
10-7. but Barboza kept it tight with
another kill. Two more kills and an
ace by Cal had the Bears up 13-8, but
a kill by Klineman and an unforced
error by Cutura made it 13-10. Cal
then started unloading the kills and

Sophomore outside hitter Alix Klineman drives the ball over two Cal blockers. Klineman notched double-digits in
kills and digs for the Card, but Stanford still fell 3-1.
For the first time in seven years
and only the sixth time in program
history, the California women's vol
leyball team defeated Stanford. The
No. 4 Golden Bears pulled off a mild
upset victory yesterday. 23-25,25-22,
'25-19, 27-25 on the road at Maples
Pavilion.
The Stanford women (15-3, 6-1
Pacific-10 Conference) started off
strong with a first-set victory but
passing woes and unforced errors
plagued them in later sets. But some
credit has to go to the relentless Cal
attack and the Bears' tough defense.
"Cal played great, give them a lot
of credit." head coach John Dunning
said. "They have some young players
on the court who really handled [the
pressure]."
Sophomore outside hitter Alix
Klineman had a big game for Stan
ford with 21 kills, 12 digs and four
blocks. Senior Foluke Akinradewo
also chipped in 12 kills and 7 blocks
and senior Cynthia Barbo/.a added
14 kills. But those big numbers could
n't stop Cal's Hana Cutura. who
pounded a match-high 23 kills and
had 12 digs.Tarah Murrey also had 14
kills for the Bears (17-1,7-0).
After trading points back and
forth in the first set. Stanford found
itself trailing 20-17. But three kills by
Klineman brought it back to a tie at
20-20. Klineman's kills were all
placed in different parts of the court
and all had different speeds on them.
A few plays later. Barboza
knocked a kill out of bounds and Cal
led 23-21. But after a kill by Akin
radewo. a block bv Barboza and jun
ior Janet Okogbaa, and a Cal hitting
error, Stanford had match point at
24-23. An excellent dig by senior Jes
sica Fishburn set up Barboza and she
pounded a kill to clinch the first set,
25-23.
The second set saw Stanford
come out and take a 5-3 lead on an
Akinradewo block. Cal stayed close
with kills from Cutura, but Akin
radewo kept Stanford ahead with
two kills to make it 10-9. But Cal
rolled off six straight points to take
the lead 15-10. Stanford's passing
woes continued, and Cal found itself
with match point at 24-19.The Cardi
nal was able to salvage some points
to bring it to 24-22, but a Cutura kill
down the line sealed the set for the
Bears.
Stanford's struggles in the second
set were evident by its hitting per
centage, which fell to .222 from .323
in the first.
Two out-of-bounds kills by Bar
boza helped Cal lead 8-6 in the third
set. But Barboza recovered with a
big kill to make it 8-7. A kill by Cutu
ra and another by Murrey put Cal up
10-7. but Barboza kept it tight with
another kill. Two more kills and an
ace by Cal had the Bears up 13-8, but
a kill by Klineman and an unforced
error by Cutura made it 13-10. Cal
then started unloading the kills and
