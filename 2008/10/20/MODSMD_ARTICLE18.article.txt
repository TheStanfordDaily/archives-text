# Football still has Bowl hope
## 
### 
-23-20.
When I stared at the final
score, 1 could not help hut
think one word: karma.
One lucky win deserves an un
lucky loss, and after ousting USC
from the BCS Championship game
last season, karma decided to cash
in on the Cardinal at the worst pos
sible time.
Like a bad cut. here are three
reasons why this game will sting for
a quite a while:
First, it was our turn — finally —
to win.
Stanford had not beaten the Bru
ins since the 2003 season, and that
didn't change on Saturday. In the
five games since, the Cardinal has
been shut out twice, 31-0 and 21-0,
and was crushed last year 45-17 in
the season opener at home. On top
of that, Stanford hasn't won at the
Rose Bowl since 19%.
But this season, both teams were
finally on even playing ground.
UCLA is in the midst of reconstruc
tion in the Kick Neuheisel era, as is
Stanford under Harbaugh. While
Stanford was 4-3 overall and 3-1 in
the Pacific-10 Conference heading
into the game. UCLA was a feeble
2-4 and 1-2 in conference.
In fact, Stanford was probably
the favorite to win, and took a 14-6
lead into halftime. The Cardinal
seemed headed for its fifth win of
the season, almost assuring itself a
bowl bid with four games left. Two
quarters later and after an embar
rassing final two minutes. Stanford
was still stuck at four wins.
Really, it was Stanford's turn to
finally come out on top. to finally
avenge loss after loss to UCLA — it
was Stanford's turn to win bragging
rights.
What made it worse is that,
though Stanford and UCLA are
synonymous with all-around excel
lence in collegiate athletics, the Bru
ins have dominated the Cardinal in
the "headliner sports" such as foot
ball and basketball in recent years.
While Stanford has won the Di
rector's Cup 14 out of the 15 years it
has been offered, UCLA has fin
ished top-four in voting each year
and has also finished second in the
past three years. But. UCLA has
made six straight bowl appearances
since 2001, compared to Stanford's
zero.
This year was supposed to be dif
ferent — UCLA football had be
come the new "Stanford" in the Pac
10.a program with so many expecta
tions that were not met. It was time
to switch up the order of power in
the conference. As I said last week,
good teams win games they are sup
posed to.
Maybe I spoke to soon.
Second. Norm Chow and Kevin
Craft guided the Bruins to the victo
ry. And Norm Chow is an offensive
genius — period.
In his coaching career. Chow has
developed three Heisman winners,
Ty Detmer, Carson Palmer and
Matt Leinart. He has also helped
develop Jim McMahon. Steve
Young and Philip Rivers to name a
few.
After a fall-out with Pete Carroll
in 2005, Chow interviewed with
Stanford for the head coach posi
tion.Though Chow was expecting to
receive the position, the job went to
Walt Harris, and we all know how
that went.
And in Saturday's game, Chow
burned the Cardinal over and over.
After a terrible first half, Neuheisel
was tempted to bench Craft. But
Chow calmed the head coach, and
Craft went on to drive the Bruins X 8
yards to victory, a two-minute drill
orchestrated by none other than
Chow.
What makes it sting is that Chow
could have been the one shoring up
Stanford's anemic passing game.
Imagine what Chow could have
done for Trent Edwards' collegiate
career (Edwards has led the Buffalo
Bills to a 5-1 record this season).
And on Saturday, Stanford had just
51 passing yards in the game to


Anthony
Nguyen
Craft's 285. Perhaps Pritchard
should have rested after last week's
concussion, giving him two weeks
rest before facing Washington State.
Still, passing has been sub-par all
season (and in recent seasons past),
leading to an unbalanced Cardinal
attack. You know your offense is too
one-dimensional when even your
quarterback is scrambling for yards
over throwing the ball.
And Craft has flourished under
Chow. In any Bruin loss, Craft has
not been the one to blame. In fact,
Craft has willed the Bruins to two
victories, including Saturday's
win, with less than two minutes re

maining.
I guess 1 know how Tennessee
fans feel now. too.
Lastly, the Cardinal's chances at
a Bowl Game were severely hurt
with the loss.
Saturday should have been our
fifth win. heading into our matchup
against winless Washington State,
almost a guaranteed win.
That would have made six, the
magic number for the postseason.
With Stanford's final three
games coming against Oregon, USC
and Cal. the team's best bet was to
win at UCLA and then at home
against the Cougars.
Now, Stanford is stuck with four
wins, possibly five after Washington
State. Can they scrounge up a win
against the Ducks, Trojans or
Bears? I don't know — they are not
games the Cardinal is expected to

dominate, and if it does manage to
pull out a win, it'll take quite a bit of
luck.
As for Big Game, a scheduling
gaffe has it set for the first Saturday
of Thanksgiving Break. Now, more
than ever, Stanford needs the sup
port of its Red Zone as it goes for a
fifth and sixth win. Let me enter a
plea to the student body: Stay one
more day to cheer for your team.
Stanford has come so far, and a sixth
win is all it needs.
Imagine that — beating Cal and
securing a Bowl Game on the last
game of the season. The story could
n't have been written any better.

Stanford football... but it's definitely
a lot tougher now than it was a few
days ago. Contact him at anguyen9@
