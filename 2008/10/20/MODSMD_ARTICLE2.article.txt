# Disagreement arises over military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy
## Law school contends with JAG recruiting 
### RYAN MAC ELLEN HUET 
Proponents of military recruitment

have been clashing recently with antidis-

crimination groups on campuses across the country
over policies regarding recruitment of homosexu
als. At Stanford Law School, the argument is more
civil, but exists nonetheless.
The military's open discrimination policy

against homosexuality has long been a point of
contention between Stanford's staunch antidis
crimination stance and proponents of the Reserve
Officers Training Corps (ROTC). Advocates have
consistently pushed for ROTCs reinstatement on
campus since its elimination in 1%9, but have faced
resolute opposition from those who claim that
reestablishment would legitimize the military's
Don't Ask. Don't Tell policy, which discriminates
against those who make known that they are gay.

lesbian or bisexual.
However, the issues between Stanford and the
U.S. military have not simply been confined to
ROTC. In more recent times, the controversy
regarding Don't Ask, Don't Tell has manifested
itself through faculty and student opposition to on
campus recruitment by the Judge Advocate
General's (JAG) Corps, which is the judicial arm of
several military branches including the Air Force,
Navy and Armed Forces. JAG officers are respon

sible for the defense and prosecution of military
law and often advise commanders on issues involv
ing numerous areas of law.
Although SLS is proud to have alumni serve in
the military, it strongly encourages law school stu
dents to not interview on campus with JAG Corps
recruiters out of respect for SLS' policy of nondis
crimination and for openly homosexual classmates.

w ho arc not allowed to interview for
JAG corps.
SI.S faculty voices this opinion in
a semi-annual email to law students,
signed by 45 faculty members. The
email urges those who are asked for
an interview to meet military
recruiters off campus.
"Because [the undersigned]
believe the military's policy of overt
discrimination undermines this edu
cational principle [of nondiscrimina
tion], we hope those of you who
seek military service will arrange to
meet military recruiters off cam
pus," the most recent email read.
Since the establishment of Don't
Ask. Don't Tell in (he military under
the Clinton administration, SLS has
opposed JAG Corps recruiters as a
confirmation of the school's nondis
criminatory policies. Over the years,
however. Congress has enacted var
ious laws that have pledged to cut
off funding from branches of
schools that directly prevent mili
tary recruiting. Of course. SLS has
fought and opposed much of this

legislation.
After deciding to pursue litiga
tion by forming the Forum for
Academic and Institutional Rights
(FAIR) with various other law
schools, SLS has been at the fore
front of defending its right not only
to bar recruiters but also to express
its views about the military policy.
"In 2003 . .. dozens of law
schools and law faculties joined in
creating FAIR, the Forum for
Academic and Institutional Rights,"
the law school email described.
"FAIR brought suit against the
Department of Defense, largely
echoing the claims made in our fac
ulty's earlier brief. The Stanford law
faculty voted to join FAIR as the
United Faculty of Stanford Law
School and voted to make our mem
bership publicly known. Among top
law schools, Georgetown. NYU and
Stanford were the sole public mem
bers of FA I R r
Today, while SLS has been essen
tially forced to open its doors to
JAG Corps recruiters due to accom
panying government funding, the
argument still centers upon whether
the law school has a right to voice its
opinion on such issues as Don't Ask.
Don't Tell.
In the most recent decision of

FAIR v. Rumsfeld, the Supreme
Court argued that while law schools
must provide "favorable access" to
military recruiters to be eligible for
government funds, they may also
maintain the right to "express what
ever views they may have on the
military's congressionally mandated
employment policy." This has pro
vided the basis for the email from
SLS faculty encouraging students to
respect their fellow law students by
not interviewing with JAG Corps
recruiters on campus.
Among those who support the
faculty's move is John Kimble, a
first-year law student and co-presi
dent of OUTLAW — an organiza
tion that seeks to combat discrimi
nation in the legal community and
at Stanford. Kimble, along with
OUTLAW co-president and third
year law student Adam Bloom and
SLS Dean Larry Kramer, began a
petition and garnered more than
200 signatures to be presented to
JAG Corps recruiters on campus.
The petition states that the under
signed "strongly oppose the mili
tary's Don't Ask. Don't Tell policy"
and "believe it weakens the mili
tary and offends fundamental
American values of fairness and
equality."

SLS Policy: Anti-discriminatory or
anti-military?
At SLS, however, some students
have not supported the school's
request and have, in turn, raised ques
tions regarding the true motives and
subsequent consequences of SLS'
policy with JAG Corps recruiters.
While opposition against SLS
protests varies in degree, the main
issue that remains is whether or not
objection to the JAG Corps fosters
anti-military sentiment on campus.
Russ lusco. a third-year law stu
dent and U.S. Navy veteran, has
found himself at the center of this
opposition. Lusco voices his opinion
to the law school community by send
ing out an email each semester coun
tering the one from SLS faculty. In it.
l usco argues that SLS policies have,
whether deliberately or not. leveled a
certain attack on the military.
"[Dean Kramer] suggests that we
take advantage of the Navy JAG's
visit to protest Don't Ask. Don't Tell."
he wrote in his most recent email to
the law community. "This is careful
wording, but the underlying point is
clear: the protest is against [the mili
tary] per se. not just the Don't Ask.
Don't Tell policy."
Third-year law student John

"One can disagree...
without repudiating
the institution"
— LARRY KRAMER,
dean of the Law School

Robinson, though neutral on the
issue, echoed this concern.
"The motives behind the policy
aren't anti-military — they're anti
discriminatory — but these things
are not mutually exclusive," he wrote
in an email to The Daily. "A policy
can be both anti-discriminatory in
motive and anti-military in effect.The
policy both supports the LGBT com
munity and. in effect, denigrates the
military."
However. SLS is quick to defend
against accusations that its sentiments
are anti-military, clarifying their
stance in various statements to the
law community.
"One can disagree with particular
policies without repudiating the insti
tution." Dean Kramer wrote in an
email to The Daily. "Disagreeing with
the military's position on hiring gays
and lesbians does not make us anti
military."
And while Fusco did state in a fol
low-up email that his accusations
against the law school could not be
attributed to individual anti-military
feelings, he stood firm with his funda
mental argument. In an interview
with The Daily, he went on to talk
about the hypocrisy of the law
school's policy, saying it attacked the
military for a policy over which it has
no control.
"1 think the law school's policy is
objectively hypocritical," he said. "It's
unfair to infer what others are think
ing. but from a neutral observer's per
spective. you have to wonder why it's
directed toward the military and not
Article 111 Judges or Congress.
"You do much damage to that
organization when you make these
kinds of attacks — turning them into
a villain." he added.
In spite of this, Fusco managed to
affirm that he did not support Don't
Ask. Don't Tell and believed that it
was in the law school's domain to fun
damentally alter the policy. Hoping
for a cultural transformation as
opposed to an immediate policy
change, Fusco placed the responsibil
ity in the hands of the law school.
"Saying 'take it off campuses' is
tantamount to stigmatizing JAG serv
ice." Fusco said. "I think the advocacy
should be directed at the people who
cause the policy to exist. I think it
would be better for the law school
and gay students to embrace the JAG
and getting those more progressive

into the military to change things."
A lawyer's perspective
For the military, a change in Don't
Ask. Don't Tell may not he far off.
Last Friday at the law school, attor
ney James Lobsenz "74 MA'75 spoke
about a recent case in which he
defended a former Air Force Major
who was discharged after it was
revealed she was gay.
Lobsenz challenged military poli
cies by defending 18-year veteran
Maj. Margaret Witt, arguing that Witt
had not directly violated Don't Ask.
Don't Tell. By saying the actions in
the Witts private life provided no
rational grounds for her discharge.
Lobsenz was able to get the case rein
stated after its original dismissal in a
Federal Dismissal Court. Lobsenz
now awaits a final ruling.
Speaking about the FAIR v.
Rumsfeld decision. Lobsenz explored
the issue of free expression and its
application to the actions at SLS.
While he acknowledged that he stands
against military policies of discrimina
tion, Lobsenz conceded that from a
free speech standpoint.the FAIR deci
sion was entirely constitutional.
"As a free speech decision. I
thought FAIR was entirely correct."
he said. "If you want the money, you
have to let [JAG recruiters] come on
campus. But that does not mean their
experience has to be pleasant or you
can't talk about how horrible it is."
Regarding the larger issue of
Don't Ask. Don't Tell, the Seattle
based lawyer related LGBT rights to
civil rights in the '60s, seeing change
only a generation away.
"How long is [the policy] going to
be around?" Lobsenz asked. "I gener
ally encourage and see it as a change
in attitudes of generations. It just
seems like the younger the person,
the more likely they are to think that
sexual orientation is completely irrel
evant. I am moderately optimistic
that over time it will go away."
Lobsenz concluded his Friday talk
by considering the influence the
upcoming presidential election could
have. He also discussed the election
with The Daily, highlighting the major
differences between the two candi
dates over Don't Ask, Don't Tell.
"If McCain is elected, I think there
will be a request that the U.S.
Supreme Court hear the case because
the McCain administration will
defend the law and argue that it is
constitutional, even as it applies to
Major Witt." Lobsenz predicted. "If
Obania is elected, there's good rea
son to hope that he will instruct the
Air Force Justice department not to
seek [action]. It would be nice that if
Obama were elected with enough
Democrats that they repeal Don't
Ask. Don't Tell. That would moot the
whole case, wouldn't it?"

Proponents of military recruitment

have been clashing recently with antidis-

crimination groups on campuses across the country
over policies regarding recruitment of homosexu
als. At Stanford Law School, the argument is more
civil, but exists nonetheless.
The military's open discrimination policy

against homosexuality has long been a point of
contention between Stanford's staunch antidis
crimination stance and proponents of the Reserve
Officers Training Corps (ROTC). Advocates have
consistently pushed for ROTCs reinstatement on
campus since its elimination in 1%9, but have faced
resolute opposition from those who claim that
reestablishment would legitimize the military's
Don't Ask. Don't Tell policy, which discriminates
against those who make known that they are gay.

lesbian or bisexual.
However, the issues between Stanford and the
U.S. military have not simply been confined to
ROTC. In more recent times, the controversy
regarding Don't Ask, Don't Tell has manifested
itself through faculty and student opposition to on
campus recruitment by the Judge Advocate
General's (JAG) Corps, which is the judicial arm of
several military branches including the Air Force,
Navy and Armed Forces. JAG officers are respon

sible for the defense and prosecution of military
law and often advise commanders on issues involv
ing numerous areas of law.
Although SLS is proud to have alumni serve in
the military, it strongly encourages law school stu
dents to not interview on campus with JAG Corps
recruiters out of respect for SLS' policy of nondis
crimination and for openly homosexual classmates.


RISTINA BAUTISTA/The Stanford Daily
w ho arc not allowed to interview for
JAG corps.
SI.S faculty voices this opinion in
a semi-annual email to law students,
signed by 45 faculty members. The
email urges those who are asked for
an interview to meet military
recruiters off campus.
"Because [the undersigned]
believe the military's policy of overt
discrimination undermines this edu
cational principle [of nondiscrimina
tion], we hope those of you who
seek military service will arrange to
meet military recruiters off cam
pus," the most recent email read.
Since the establishment of Don't
Ask. Don't Tell in (he military under
the Clinton administration, SLS has
opposed JAG Corps recruiters as a
confirmation of the school's nondis
criminatory policies. Over the years,
however. Congress has enacted var
ious laws that have pledged to cut
off funding from branches of
schools that directly prevent mili
tary recruiting. Of course. SLS has
fought and opposed much of this

legislation.
After deciding to pursue litiga
tion by forming the Forum for
Academic and Institutional Rights
(FAIR) with various other law
schools, SLS has been at the fore
front of defending its right not only
to bar recruiters but also to express
its views about the military policy.
"In 2003 . .. dozens of law
schools and law faculties joined in
creating FAIR, the Forum for
Academic and Institutional Rights,"
the law school email described.
"FAIR brought suit against the
Department of Defense, largely
echoing the claims made in our fac
ulty's earlier brief. The Stanford law
faculty voted to join FAIR as the
United Faculty of Stanford Law
School and voted to make our mem
bership publicly known. Among top
law schools, Georgetown. NYU and
Stanford were the sole public mem
bers of FA I R r
Today, while SLS has been essen
tially forced to open its doors to
JAG Corps recruiters due to accom
panying government funding, the
argument still centers upon whether
the law school has a right to voice its
opinion on such issues as Don't Ask.
Don't Tell.
In the most recent decision of

FAIR v. Rumsfeld, the Supreme
Court argued that while law schools
must provide "favorable access" to
military recruiters to be eligible for
government funds, they may also
maintain the right to "express what
ever views they may have on the
military's congressionally mandated
employment policy." This has pro
vided the basis for the email from
SLS faculty encouraging students to
respect their fellow law students by
not interviewing with JAG Corps
recruiters on campus.
Among those who support the
faculty's move is John Kimble, a
first-year law student and co-presi
dent of OUTLAW — an organiza
tion that seeks to combat discrimi
nation in the legal community and
at Stanford. Kimble, along with
OUTLAW co-president and third
year law student Adam Bloom and
SLS Dean Larry Kramer, began a
petition and garnered more than
200 signatures to be presented to
JAG Corps recruiters on campus.
The petition states that the under
signed "strongly oppose the mili
tary's Don't Ask. Don't Tell policy"
and "believe it weakens the mili
tary and offends fundamental
American values of fairness and
equality."

SLS Policy: Anti-discriminatory or
anti-military?
At SLS, however, some students
have not supported the school's
request and have, in turn, raised ques
tions regarding the true motives and
subsequent consequences of SLS'
policy with JAG Corps recruiters.
While opposition against SLS
protests varies in degree, the main
issue that remains is whether or not
objection to the JAG Corps fosters
anti-military sentiment on campus.
Russ lusco. a third-year law stu
dent and U.S. Navy veteran, has
found himself at the center of this
opposition. Lusco voices his opinion
to the law school community by send
ing out an email each semester coun
tering the one from SLS faculty. In it.
l usco argues that SLS policies have,
whether deliberately or not. leveled a
certain attack on the military.
"[Dean Kramer] suggests that we
take advantage of the Navy JAG's
visit to protest Don't Ask. Don't Tell."
he wrote in his most recent email to
the law community. "This is careful
wording, but the underlying point is
clear: the protest is against [the mili
tary] per se. not just the Don't Ask.
Don't Tell policy."
Third-year law student John

"One can disagree...
without repudiating
the institution"
— LARRY KRAMER,
dean of the Law School

Robinson, though neutral on the
issue, echoed this concern.
"The motives behind the policy
aren't anti-military — they're anti
discriminatory — but these things
are not mutually exclusive," he wrote
in an email to The Daily. "A policy
can be both anti-discriminatory in
motive and anti-military in effect.The
policy both supports the LGBT com
munity and. in effect, denigrates the
military."
However. SLS is quick to defend
against accusations that its sentiments
are anti-military, clarifying their
stance in various statements to the
law community.
"One can disagree with particular
policies without repudiating the insti
tution." Dean Kramer wrote in an
email to The Daily. "Disagreeing with
the military's position on hiring gays
and lesbians does not make us anti
military."
And while Fusco did state in a fol
low-up email that his accusations
against the law school could not be
attributed to individual anti-military
feelings, he stood firm with his funda
mental argument. In an interview
with The Daily, he went on to talk
about the hypocrisy of the law
school's policy, saying it attacked the
military for a policy over which it has
no control.
"1 think the law school's policy is
objectively hypocritical," he said. "It's
unfair to infer what others are think
ing. but from a neutral observer's per
spective. you have to wonder why it's
directed toward the military and not
Article 111 Judges or Congress.
"You do much damage to that
organization when you make these
kinds of attacks — turning them into
a villain." he added.
In spite of this, Fusco managed to
affirm that he did not support Don't
Ask. Don't Tell and believed that it
was in the law school's domain to fun
damentally alter the policy. Hoping
for a cultural transformation as
opposed to an immediate policy
change, Fusco placed the responsibil
ity in the hands of the law school.
"Saying 'take it off campuses' is
tantamount to stigmatizing JAG serv
ice." Fusco said. "I think the advocacy
should be directed at the people who
cause the policy to exist. I think it
would be better for the law school
and gay students to embrace the JAG
and getting those more progressive

into the military to change things."
A lawyer's perspective
For the military, a change in Don't
Ask. Don't Tell may not he far off.
Last Friday at the law school, attor
ney James Lobsenz "74 MA'75 spoke
about a recent case in which he
defended a former Air Force Major

the military's position on hiring gays
and lesbians does not make us anti
military."
And while Fusco did state in a fol
low-up email that his accusations
against the law school could not be
attributed to individual anti-military
feelings, he stood firm with his funda
mental argument. In an interview
with The Daily, he went on to talk
about the hypocrisy of the law
school's policy, saying it attacked the
military for a policy over which it has
no control.
"1 think the law school's policy is
objectively hypocritical," he said. "It's
unfair to infer what others are think
ing. but from a neutral observer's per
spective. you have to wonder why it's
directed toward the military and not
Article 111 Judges or Congress.
"You do much damage to that
organization when you make these
kinds of attacks — turning them into
a villain." he added.
In spite of this, Fusco managed to
affirm that he did not support Don't
Ask. Don't Tell and believed that it
was in the law school's domain to fun
damentally alter the policy. Hoping
for a cultural transformation as
opposed to an immediate policy
change, Fusco placed the responsibil
ity in the hands of the law school.
"Saying 'take it off campuses' is
tantamount to stigmatizing JAG serv
ice." Fusco said. "I think the advocacy
should be directed at the people who
cause the policy to exist. I think it
would be better for the law school
and gay students to embrace the JAG
and getting those more progressive

into the military to change things."
A lawyer's perspective
For the military, a change in Don't
Ask. Don't Tell may not he far off.
Last Friday at the law school, attor
ney James Lobsenz "74 MA'75 spoke
about a recent case in which he
defended a former Air Force Major
who was discharged after it was
revealed she was gay.
Lobsenz challenged military poli
cies by defending 18-year veteran
Maj. Margaret Witt, arguing that Witt
had not directly violated Don't Ask.
Don't Tell. By saying the actions in
the Witts private life provided no
rational grounds for her discharge.
Lobsenz was able to get the case rein
stated after its original dismissal in a
Federal Dismissal Court. Lobsenz
now awaits a final ruling.
Speaking about the FAIR v.
Rumsfeld decision. Lobsenz explored
the issue of free expression and its
application to the actions at SLS.
While he acknowledged that he stands
against military policies of discrimina
tion, Lobsenz conceded that from a
free speech standpoint.the FAIR deci
sion was entirely constitutional.
"As a free speech decision. I
thought FAIR was entirely correct."
he said. "If you want the money, you
have to let [JAG recruiters] come on
campus. But that does not mean their
experience has to be pleasant or you
can't talk about how horrible it is."
Regarding the larger issue of
Don't Ask. Don't Tell, the Seattle
based lawyer related LGBT rights to
civil rights in the '60s, seeing change
only a generation away.
"How long is [the policy] going to
be around?" Lobsenz asked. "I gener
ally encourage and see it as a change
in attitudes of generations. It just
seems like the younger the person,
the more likely they are to think that
sexual orientation is completely irrel
evant. I am moderately optimistic
that over time it will go away."
Lobsenz concluded his Friday talk
by considering the influence the
upcoming presidential election could
have. He also discussed the election
with The Daily, highlighting the major
differences between the two candi
dates over Don't Ask, Don't Tell.
"If McCain is elected, I think there
will be a request that the U.S.
Supreme Court hear the case because
the McCain administration will
defend the law and argue that it is
constitutional, even as it applies to
Major Witt." Lobsenz predicted. "If
Obania is elected, there's good rea
son to hope that he will instruct the
Air Force Justice department not to
seek [action]. It would be nice that if
Obama were elected with enough
Democrats that they repeal Don't
Ask. Don't Tell. That would moot the
whole case, wouldn't it?"
