# Disagreement arises over military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy
## Law school contends with JAG recruiting 
### RYAN MAC ELLEN HUET 
Proponents of military recruitment

have been clashing recently with antidis-

crimination groups on campuses across the country
over policies regarding recruitment of homosexu
als. At Stanford Law School, the argument is more
civil, but exists nonetheless.
The military's open discrimination policy

against homosexuality has long been a point of
contention between Stanford's staunch antidis
crimination stance and proponents of the Reserve
Officers Training Corps (ROTC). Advocates have
consistently pushed for ROTCs reinstatement on
campus since its elimination in 1%9, but have faced
resolute opposition from those who claim that
reestablishment would legitimize the military's
Don't Ask. Don't Tell policy, which discriminates
against those who make known that they are gay.

lesbian or bisexual.
However, the issues between Stanford and the
U.S. military have not simply been confined to
ROTC. In more recent times, the controversy
regarding Don't Ask, Don't Tell has manifested
itself through faculty and student opposition to on
campus recruitment by the Judge Advocate
General's (JAG) Corps, which is the judicial arm of
several military branches including the Air Force,
Navy and Armed Forces. JAG officers are respon

sible for the defense and prosecution of military
law and often advise commanders on issues involv
ing numerous areas of law.
Although SLS is proud to have alumni serve in
the military, it strongly encourages law school stu
dents to not interview on campus with JAG Corps
recruiters out of respect for SLS' policy of nondis
crimination and for openly homosexual classmates.
