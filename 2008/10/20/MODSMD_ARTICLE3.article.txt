## UC profs. rise against budget cut Funds cut from Contreras Labor Program 
### CHRISTINE McFADDEN 
Professors from both public and
private schools statewide signed and
sent a letter on Wednesday to
California Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger, protesting his veto
of the Miguel Contreras Labor
Program. The program was the only
vetoed item in the governor's 2008-
09 budget cut from University of
California schools, leading many to
believe that his veto power was used
for political reasons rather than for
statewide savings.
Chris Tilly, an urban planning
professor and director of the
Institute for Research on Labor and
Employment at UCLA, was one of
the co-writers of the letter. Since
then, over 400 professors from
across the state have shown their
support by adding their names to
the letter.
"I'm very excited at the level of
response that we got." Tilly said in a
phone interview with ITie Daily.
"This is many more professors than
I expected."
Signers of the letter were from all
10 UC schools, with a strong show
ing of support from California State
Universities, as well as private insti
tutions such as Pomona and USC.
Five professors from Stanford
backed the letter, including Law
Prof. William Gould, who previously
served as Chairman of the National
Labor Relations Board.
"This letter is an attempt to dis
suade [Gov. Schwarzenegger] from
engaging in this action," Gould said.
"This is an attempt to work through
the political process."
Because the $5.4 million labor
program was the only cut made
from the $3 billion UC budget, much
speculation has arisen that the gov
ernor potentially removed the fund
ing because of his faulty relationship
with unions.
"The unions support this pro
gram," Gould said. "He probably
sees the unions as one of his political
enemies. The unions have been out
spoken."
The Contreras Program has cen
ters and institutes at both UC-
Berkeley and UCLA, but as the
demographics of support show, the
program has influence in colleges
and universities from across the
state. The program funds scholarly
research that investigates employ
ment and labor concerns in the
workforce through graduate student
grants and fellowships.
Community service through
unions, curriculum development and
research publications are also pro
moted, garnering the program inter
national attention.
"I actually believe that the pro
gram is unparalleled in the country."
Tilly said. "There are other labor
studies programs and institutes that
address labor issues, but there are
not many that do education and
training and address Latino. African
American. Asian and Pacific
Islander. LGBT, youth, women and
the whole range of constituencies
within labor."
Schwarzenegger's conspicuous
cut of the Contreras Program fund
ing has been attempted before.
According to Gould, previous
efforts to withdraw funds have con
sistently been answered by pressure
from Democrats urging the gover
nor to keep the program.
'"'lTiis is really a model for the
nation and a showpiece for the
University of California," Tilly said
in reference to the labor program. "I
can understand the political logic
I hat might be behind the veto, but at
the same time, it doesn't make much
sense because it is attracting pres
tige to the t Jniversity of C alifornia.'
ITie veto also raises ethical ques
tions on the governor's power to
slash programs seemingly based on
political reasons.
"Maybe the next governor does

n't like stem cell research." Tilly
said. "The question is: Do you want
to open this door for political deci
sions to steer academic programs?"
Although the vast majority of
funding has been taken away, Tilly
confirmed that the Contreras
Program will continue its research.
Small amounts of funding that
avoid the line of funding vetoed by
the governor, as well as written
grants and outside fundraising will
keep the program alive. Supporters
are also waiting to hear back from
UC President Mark Yudof regard
ing the possibility of additional
funding.
According to Tilly, there is a role
tor college students to play in the
campaign to win back funding for
the labor program. Although the
letter of protest has already been
sent to the governor, students can
send letters of their own to add to
the persuasion.
Despite the nation's current
financial situation, professors at
public and private schools alike are
stressing that programs such as the
Contreras Program are too impor
tant to lose. Professors argue that
the budget cut goes deeper than
funding for research but is also an
issue of freedom of speech.
"This would he a great setback to
intellectual inquiry in the labor field
and the right of people to speak
freely on this important issue."
Gould said.
