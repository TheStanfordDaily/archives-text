## UC profs. rise against budget cut Funds cut from Contreras Labor Program 
### CHRISTINE McFADDEN 
Professors from both public and
private schools statewide signed and
sent a letter on Wednesday to
California Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger, protesting his veto
of the Miguel Contreras Labor
Program. The program was the only
vetoed item in the governor's 2008-
09 budget cut from University of
California schools, leading many to
believe that his veto power was used
for political reasons rather than for
statewide savings.
Chris Tilly, an urban planning
professor and director of the
Institute for Research on Labor and
Employment at UCLA, was one of
the co-writers of the letter. Since
then, over 400 professors from
across the state have shown their
support by adding their names to
the letter.
"I'm very excited at the level of
response that we got." Tilly said in a
phone interview with ITie Daily.
"This is many more professors than
I expected."
Signers of the letter were from all
10 UC schools, with a strong show
ing of support from California State
Universities, as well as private insti
tutions such as Pomona and USC.
Five professors from Stanford
backed the letter, including Law
Prof. William Gould, who previously
served as Chairman of the National
Labor Relations Board.
"This letter is an attempt to dis
suade [Gov. Schwarzenegger] from
engaging in this action," Gould said.
"This is an attempt to work through
the political process."
Because the $5.4 million labor
program was the only cut made
from the $3 billion UC budget, much
speculation has arisen that the gov
ernor potentially removed the fund
ing because of his faulty relationship
with unions.
"The unions support this pro
gram," Gould said. "He probably
sees the unions as one of his political
enemies. The unions have been out
spoken."
The Contreras Program has cen
ters and institutes at both UC-
Berkeley and UCLA, but as the
demographics of support show, the
program has influence in colleges
and universities from across the
state. The program funds scholarly
research that investigates employ
ment and labor concerns in the
workforce through graduate student
grants and fellowships.
