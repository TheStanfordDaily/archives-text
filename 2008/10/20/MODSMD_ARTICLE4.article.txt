# STANFORD 20 UCLA 23
## CARD FALLS IN FINAL SECONDS 
### JACK SALISBURY DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal defense made UCLA's Kevin
Craft look more like a tackling dummy than a
quarterback for most of Saturday, sacking him
seven times and keeping constant pressure on
the Bruins' 08. But when it came to the game's
final two and a half minutes. Craft seemed to be
invincible.
Craft, who started training camp as UCLA's
(3-4, 2-2 Pacific-10 Conference) third-string
quarterback, drove the Bruins 87 yards down
the field with 2:23 left on the clock to lead
UCLA to a 23-20 victory at the Rose Bowl on
Saturday. He capped off the drive with a seven
yard touchdown pass to tight end Cory Harkey
with just 10 seconds left on the clock.
"They did to us what we did to Arizona." said
Stanford center Alex Fletcher. "It's heartbreak
ing. It really is."
"[lt's] gut wrenching," head coach Jim
Harbaugh said of the loss. "I hate to lose. I can
not stand it."
Stanford's (4-4, 3-2 Pac-10) loss was marked
by a number of mental mistakes. The Cardinal
was penalized 10 times for a total of 103 yards, a
few of the penalties providing the Bruins with
momentum on their drives. The team also had
three turnovers — two came while the Cardinal
was driving in UCLA territory, while the other,
a fumble by sophomore Doug Baldwin, gave the
Bruins prime field position and led to UCLA's
first touchdown of the game.
"I would definitely say we did a lot to beat
ourselves." said Fletcher, a senior and team cap
tain. "We got a little spotty at different times
and beat ourselves offensively."
"We stopped ourselves." junior running back
Toby Gerhart agreed. "We had a couple key
turnovers that stopped our drives."
Despites the mistakes that plagued the team
on Saturday, the Cardinal was still in the driver's
seat with two and a half minutes remaining —
the Bruins, who hadn't put together a substan
tial touchdown drive the whole day, were faced
with the prospect of going 87 yards against a
Stanford defense that had maintained constant
pressure on the quarterback.
Somewhere along the way. though, the
defense broke down.
"I'm not pointing any fingers," Harbaugh
said. "I just think we got tired mentally, not
physically. We also got creative on offense and
that's going to lead to mistakes.

Stanford redshirt junior quarterback Tavita Pritchard exits the field following UCLA's touchdown in
the final minute. Pritchard played despite suffering a concussion against Arizona last week.
"We just weren't able to get to him
[Craft]," senior linebacker Clinton Snyder
said. "We just didn't get it done."
The stunning loss did overshadow some
positives for the Cardinal, which mostly
thrived on its run game and pass rush. Ger
hart continued his recent tear,carrying the
ball 27 times for 138 yards and two touch
downs.
As a team. Stanford rushed for 250
yards. Carrying the ball six times on varia
tions of the option, redshirt sophomore
quarterback Alex Loukas had 51 yards.
Baldwin also took a reverse for 36 yards in
the second quarter, setting up Gerhart for
a score on the next play.The Cardinal's ex
periment with the option may have stunt
ed the aerial game, however, as redshirt

junior Tavita Pritchard could only muster
51 yards on 5-of-12 passing.
The loss was a tough one to take for
Stanford, which would have been just one
victory shy of qualifying for a bowl bid
with a win on Saturday. With a Nov. 1 home
game against Washington State, probably
the worst team in the Pac-10. a victory over
the Bruins would have all but clinched
bowl eligibility for a Cardinal team that is
looking for its first winning season in
years.
"It hurts," Fletcher said. "But I believe
in the character of this football team.
We're going to attack every game and spill
our hearts out on the field. We're just going
to keep fighting."
"It's a tough one to swallow," Loukas

said. "It's hard, but we're going to bounce
back."
NOTES — Redshirt junior right tackle
Chris Marinelli left the game with an in
jury to his shoulder, the extent of which is
not known at this time. Harbaugh said he
thinks that the upcoming bye week will
benefit Gerhart in particular, who will get
14 days of rest before the team's next
game. Gerhart agreed, "I've been waiting
for this bye week. It's going to be nice to
have an extra week." This weekend was
homecoming for UCLA, and the stands
were filled with about 65.000 in atten
dance.
