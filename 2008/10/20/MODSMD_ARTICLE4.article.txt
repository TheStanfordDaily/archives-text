# STANFORD 20 UCLA 23
## CARD FALLS IN FINAL SECONDS 
### JACK SALISBURY DESK EDITOR 
The Cardinal defense made UCLA's Kevin
Craft look more like a tackling dummy than a
quarterback for most of Saturday, sacking him
seven times and keeping constant pressure on
the Bruins' 08. But when it came to the game's
final two and a half minutes. Craft seemed to be
invincible.
Craft, who started training camp as UCLA's
(3-4, 2-2 Pacific-10 Conference) third-string
quarterback, drove the Bruins 87 yards down
the field with 2:23 left on the clock to lead
UCLA to a 23-20 victory at the Rose Bowl on
Saturday. He capped off the drive with a seven
yard touchdown pass to tight end Cory Harkey
with just 10 seconds left on the clock.
"They did to us what we did to Arizona." said
Stanford center Alex Fletcher. "It's heartbreak
ing. It really is."
"[lt's] gut wrenching," head coach Jim
Harbaugh said of the loss. "I hate to lose. I can
not stand it."
Stanford's (4-4, 3-2 Pac-10) loss was marked
by a number of mental mistakes. The Cardinal
was penalized 10 times for a total of 103 yards, a
few of the penalties providing the Bruins with
momentum on their drives. The team also had
three turnovers — two came while the Cardinal
was driving in UCLA territory, while the other,
a fumble by sophomore Doug Baldwin, gave the
Bruins prime field position and led to UCLA's
first touchdown of the game.
"I would definitely say we did a lot to beat
ourselves." said Fletcher, a senior and team cap
tain. "We got a little spotty at different times
and beat ourselves offensively."
"We stopped ourselves." junior running back
Toby Gerhart agreed. "We had a couple key
turnovers that stopped our drives."
Despites the mistakes that plagued the team
on Saturday, the Cardinal was still in the driver's
seat with two and a half minutes remaining —
the Bruins, who hadn't put together a substan
tial touchdown drive the whole day, were faced
with the prospect of going 87 yards against a
Stanford defense that had maintained constant
pressure on the quarterback.
Somewhere along the way. though, the
defense broke down.
"I'm not pointing any fingers," Harbaugh
said. "I just think we got tired mentally, not
physically. We also got creative on offense and
that's going to lead to mistakes.
