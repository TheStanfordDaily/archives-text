Jim Harbaugh likes plavmakers and
rewards success.
It was no surprise, then, that after
redshirt sophomore third-string quarter
back Alex Loukas led Stanford on its
game-winning drive against Arizona —
mainly using his legs to do so
Harbaugh said that he would likely see
the field against UCLA, regardless of
the play or condition of starting redshirt

He didn't say how often, or for how

Part of the key to Loukas's success

he was going to hand it off to one of
Stanford's backs. Indeed. Loukas only
