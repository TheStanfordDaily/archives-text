# OFFENSE NEEDS TO DIVERSIFY
## 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
Jim Harbaugh likes plavmakers and
rewards success.
It was no surprise, then, that after
redshirt sophomore third-string quarter
back Alex Loukas led Stanford on its
game-winning drive against Arizona —
mainly using his legs to do so
Harbaugh said that he would likely see
the field against UCLA, regardless of
the play or condition of starting redshirt
junior quarterback Tavita Pritchard.
He didn't say how often, or for how
long, but Harbaugh devotees know that
he enjoys the non-traditional. Plus, there
was a precedent: Pritchard and T.C.
Ostrander split time throughout the lat
ter part of the 2007 season, frequently
replacing each other on every other
series.
But Harbaugh took it to the next
level against the Bruins, as he switched
in Loukas and Pritchard seemingly at
random and sometimes on successive
plays. The goal was simple: keep the
defense off balance. But the results were
mediocre, at best.
Part of the key to Loukas's success
against the Wildcats was that his aggres
sive style of running was entirely unex
pected. Arizona was a step slow
throughout the final drive, and Loukas
was able to succeed.
A quick glance at Loukas' rushing
stats from Saturday's contest against the
Bruins might show something similar —
he ran six times for 51 yards. But the
majority came on a 29-yard rush in the
first quarter, after which the UCLA
defense adapted to the quarterback
keeper and rendered Loukas' skills
effectively moot.
Still. Loukas was given playing time.
But the Cardinal offensive plan became
predictable when he entered the game
— either he was going to run the ball, or
he was going to hand it off to one of
Stanford's backs. Indeed. Loukas only
had one pass attempt — on a "Hail Mary" pass
at the end of the game.
The game plan was very eonservative: 'ITie
Cardinal ran 44 times and threw just 13 passes.
But the lack of pass distribution amongst the two
quarterbacks allowed the defense to even fur
ther prepare for the run when Loukas played.
Additionally, the constant quarterback
changes did not allow Pritchard, who bore the
brunt of the passing load, to establish any sort of
rhythm. He isn't the most accurate passer,but his
throws on Saturday were particularly erratic,
and he could have had at least three intercep
tions to his name — he was fortunate to only
come awav with one.

It isn't the best situation
for either passer and, by
extension, the team.

Throughout his time as a starter, Pritchard
has shown that he is most effective both as a
passer and a game manager when he is allowed
to get in sync with the offense. But if he is taken
out of the game, even for one play, it seems to
throw him off. That was certainly evident in the
second half of last year, when Ostrander played
frequently.
And it's been true in 2008, too. Pritchard did
n't hit his stride this year until the second half of
the San Jose State game. Prior to that point, both

Loukas and senior Jason Forcier had seen play
ing time in each of the C ardinal s tirst three
games. Additionally, there was constant specula
tion that freshman Andrew Luck was going to
replace Pritchard as the starter.
But the latter part of the contest against the
Spartans was the first time that Pritchard s job
was effectively safe — it was his team. And he
excelled in the second halt and then notched the
best performance of his career against Washing
ton in the following week.
But nothing gold can stay, and after a poor
showing in South Bend and Loukas' heroics
against the Wildcats. Pritchard lost his grip on the
quarterback job.
Now, Stanford has a two-quarterback system.
But it isn't the best situation for either passer
and, by extension, the team.That's not to say that
Loukas shouldn't play at all — he should. His
running style brings another dimension to the
playing field.
But perhaps he should be used similar to the
way the Bruins used Jason's brother.Chris Forci
er. He was brought in for only about a half a
dozen plays on Saturday — and almost exclu
sively to run — but he caught the Stanford de
fense off guard nearly each time, resulting in nice
gains for the UCLA offense.
That could be a nice solution. But no matter
the change, the two-quarterback strategy needs
to be augmented to better maintain the effec
tiveness of both passers.
