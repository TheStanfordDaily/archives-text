### KAMIL DADA DESK EDITOR 
ITiree students from the Graduate School of
Business (GSB) lost their lives last week (Oct
10.) when their car went off Highway 1 and land
ed approximately 7(K) feet below the roadway,
according to a report by the Monterey County
Sheriffs Office.
Ihe students were subsequently identified as
Viet Nguyen. 28; Chris Sahm, 29: and Micah
Springer, 23. The students were reported missing

Friday night after failing to unite with a group of
fellow graduate students for a weekend gather
ing in Big Sur. According to the California
Highway Patrol (CHP), the students' 2(X)5 Jeep
Cherokee was last seen at approximately 7:45
p.m. on Friday, Oct. 10. heading southbound on
Highway 1.
Fellow classmates who arrived at the retreat
became worried when the boys failed to show up.
At 11 a.m. on Saturday morning (Oct. 11). they
notified highway patrol of the missing students.
Approximately one hour later, Monterey
County search and rescue crews located the Jeep
by the 57-mile marker of Highway 1. about 20
miles south of Carmel. A CHP helicopter was
used to locate the vehicle when classmates found
personal items relating to the boys down the hill

from the highway. They signaled to a helicopter,
which was then able to find the Jeep. All three
victims were removed from the Jeep later the
same day.
On Wednesday, the CHP released its initial
findings from the investigation, which revealed
that Sahm was driving, while Springer and
Nguyen were passengers.
Jim Covello, public affairs officer for the CHP.
said that boys were about 10 miles north of their
destination when the accident took place. There
were no witnesses or skid marks on the pave
ment.
"Rescuers found the [students] dead inside
the vehicle with their seat belts fastened,"
Covello said. "The Jeep was rolled up to a ball."
Covello said the three died due to blunt force

trauma.
The cause of the accident is currently still
under investigation. However, according to
Covello. an unsafe speed was a likely factor in the
incident. A full investigation, including toxicology
reports, is still pending.
The report also noted that the Jeep traveled
off the steep cliff and overturned numerous
times before landing near the edge of the Pacific
Ocean.
On Wednesday, hundreds of classmates
walked from the Schwab Residential Center,
where Nguyen and Springer lived, to the GSB a
few blocks away for a memorial service.
