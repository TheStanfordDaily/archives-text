## GSB mourns loss of three students who died in car accident Inestigation pending; Unsafe speed a likely cause 
### KAMIL DADA DESK EDITOR 
ITiree students from the Graduate School of
Business (GSB) lost their lives last week (Oct
10.) when their car went off Highway 1 and land
ed approximately 7(K) feet below the roadway,
according to a report by the Monterey County
Sheriffs Office.
Ihe students were subsequently identified as
Viet Nguyen. 28; Chris Sahm, 29: and Micah
Springer, 23. The students were reported missing

Friday night after failing to unite with a group of
fellow graduate students for a weekend gather
ing in Big Sur. According to the California
Highway Patrol (CHP), the students' 2(X)5 Jeep
Cherokee was last seen at approximately 7:45
p.m. on Friday, Oct. 10. heading southbound on
Highway 1.
Fellow classmates who arrived at the retreat
became worried when the boys failed to show up.
At 11 a.m. on Saturday morning (Oct. 11). they
notified highway patrol of the missing students.
Approximately one hour later, Monterey
County search and rescue crews located the Jeep
by the 57-mile marker of Highway 1. about 20
miles south of Carmel. A CHP helicopter was
used to locate the vehicle when classmates found
personal items relating to the boys down the hill

from the highway. They signaled to a helicopter,
which was then able to find the Jeep. All three
victims were removed from the Jeep later the
same day.
On Wednesday, the CHP released its initial
findings from the investigation, which revealed
that Sahm was driving, while Springer and
Nguyen were passengers.
Jim Covello, public affairs officer for the CHP.
said that boys were about 10 miles north of their
destination when the accident took place. There
were no witnesses or skid marks on the pave
ment.
"Rescuers found the [students] dead inside
the vehicle with their seat belts fastened,"
Covello said. "The Jeep was rolled up to a ball."
Covello said the three died due to blunt force

trauma.
The cause of the accident is currently still
under investigation. However, according to
Covello. an unsafe speed was a likely factor in the
incident. A full investigation, including toxicology
reports, is still pending.
The report also noted that the Jeep traveled
off the steep cliff and overturned numerous
times before landing near the edge of the Pacific
Ocean.
On Wednesday, hundreds of classmates
walked from the Schwab Residential Center,
where Nguyen and Springer lived, to the GSB a
few blocks away for a memorial service.
Relatives, classmates, faculh and staff shared
memories and stories about the boys.
There was a family service on
Thursday at Alta Mesa Memorial Park
in Palo Alto on Thursday for Nguyen,
a service for Sahm on Friday in New
York. N.Y. and a service for Springer
on Saturday in Westerville. Ohio.
Their Backgrounds
Nguyen, from Raleigh, N.C., and
Springer, Columbus. Ohio, were first
year GSB students, while Springer was
also pursuing a PhD in the materials
science and engineering department,
aiming to complete both degrees
simultaneously. Sahm. from Long
Island, N.Y., was a second-year student
in the MBA program.
Nguyen was the first in his family to
attend college and earned an under
graduate degree at Duke University in
political science and French. He then
went on to earn an M.A. in French
from Columbia University. Before
entering the GSB. he had a career in
marketing watches and jewelry, work
ing as a brand manager for Chanel and
earlier as a product correspondent for
Louis Vuitton and a marketer for
Baume Mercier.
Sahm earned his undergraduate
degree in sociology at Harvard and
went on to work in strategic planning
at American Express in both New
York City and Sao Paolo, Brazil. He
then spent two years as a financial
manager at Saks Fifth Avenue, where
he launched Saks' co-branded credit
card with HBSC He also volunteered
as a mentor to troubled youth.
Springer graduated at the top of his
class at Ohio State University, where
he earned his undergraduate degree in
aerospace engineering. He completed
a year of his PhD in materials science
and engineering last year, specializing
in nonmaterial for biomedical applica
tions. He was combining that degree
with his MBA to bridge the disconnect
between scientific technology and the
"real world."
Springer previously held an intern

ship at the nonmaterial group at
NASA. When he was young. Springer
fought through a cancer diagnosis that
gave him a life expectancy of age six.
Friends said he was researching novel
cancer eradication techniques for his
PhD and felt strongly that they could
apply to cancer cures.
Student Reactions
Many students refused to publicly
comment, citing the high emotional
stress of doing so. Others requested
privacy and space as they dealt with
the tragedy.
First-year GSB student Avion Gray
said she was a good friend of Viet and
was immediately drawn to his enthusi
asm.
"With Viet it was more than just the
superficial banter," she said. "It went
much deeper than that. Fie was the
type of person that would be genuine
ly happy to see you. His face would
instantly light up and he would wel
come you with a big hug and two
cheek kiss."
She added that Viet never ran out
of energy or things to talk about.
"Viet was the type of person that
you could be around all day and never
run out of things to talk or giggle
about," she added. "He exuded a level
of energy and zeal that was contagious.
As his friends, we literally had an insa
tiable desire to be in his presence. We
just could not get enough of him."
Gray found it difficult to put into
words the extent to which Viefs death
affected her.
"My world literally came to a stop
when I received word of this tragedy,"
she said. "The world has lost a beauti
ful person who had a deep passion for
life. Although my heart has been bro
ken, I take comfort in knowing and
believing that although I can no longer
see Viet, he will always be with me."
Gray pointed out that losing Viet
taught her harsh lessons about the
fragility of life and the importance of
relationships.
"Too often do we take people for
granted, thinking that they'll always be
with us," she said. "We overlook oppor
tunities to connect with others on a
deeper level and we put things off for
the next time. Viet's death has awak

ened me to the reality that there may
not be a next time and that we should
live everyday as it were our last."
Julia Collins, a second-year GSB
student. lived with Sahm in a four-bed
room house in Palo Alto with two
other friends. She spoke of how Sahm
was one of the most humorous people
she had ever met, and how he always
new how to make her smile.
"Chris was an incredibly passion
ate person who lived his life richly
every day," she said. "He was a loyal
friend and a person that we all relied
on for his intellect and his keen
insights. He was an incredible per
former and musical talent. He was
kind and sweet and the first person to
give you a big hug when he saw that
you needed one."
Second-year business schwl stu
dents Laura Jones and Betty Chen —
both best friends with Sahm — spoke
at the memorial on Wednesday, along
with Julia Collins and Justin Nassiri.
They also had a "Project Runway"
season finale party following the serv
ice to celebrate his life, which was
attended by approximately 70 of
Sahm's classmates.
"On Friday, we went to wake and

burial along with 14 other Stanford
GSB '09 students who tlew out on
Thursday evening," Jones said. "[On
Saturday], we attended a celebration
of Chris' life, which 19 other Stanford
GSB '09 also attended — others tlew
in on Friday or were already in N.Y. for
other purposes."
Jones was at a loss to pick specific
memories of Sahm. saying it was too
difficult to choose.
"In terms of stories and details, it's
impossible to put into words just how
wonderful, loving, fabulous, funny, out
rageous. proud, caring and supportive
Chris was," she said. "He was not just a
good friend, but a best friend to many
He had amazing style and loved fash
ion, having spent part of his career
working on strategy for Saks Fifth
Avenue."
Jones said students are now consol
ing themselves by trying to make up
for what Sahm brought to the world.
"We all have to become more fab
ulous to make up for the fabulousness
we have lost," she said.
Since classes at the GSB only
began in late September, not everyone
had the chance to get to know the boys
that well. Yohei Iwasaki, a first-year

business school student, only spoke to
Springer once, but felt that Springer
made an immediate impression upon
him. Iwasaki played violin in a memo
rial service for the three students.
"Although I talked with Micah just
once. I felt that he was an extremely
nice guy," he said. "He had a warm
heart, big eyes and leadership of
attracting others."
Similar to Gray, Iwasaki pointed
out how the loss helped him realize
the importance of personal relation
ships
"Their loss helped me realize how
family, friends and community are
important — how they affect us and
how they make us strong," he said.
Faculty Reactions
University President John
Hennessy issued a public statement in
response to the incident and offered
his condolences to the family mem
bers.
"This is a tragic loss for the
Stanford community of three brilliant
and promising students who had so
much to contribute to the world, and
lost their lives too suddenly and too
soon." Hennessy said. "To the families,
friends and graduate business col
leagues of Viet, Chris and Micah. and
all those who are also grieving at this
shocking news, we send our deepest
sympathies from the entire university
community."
GSB Dean Robert Joss said the
school was shaken by the loss. He
described to The Daily how there has
been a whirlwind of activities and
communications at the GSB, pointing
to the large memorial service on
Wednesday afternoon and other
remembrance activities.
"All of us are shocked and full of
grief, and our hearts and prayers go
out to their families and friends," Joss
wrote in a note to students and faculty
as soon as the incident came to light.
"We will prepare plans for the coming
week to remember them, to share our
grief and to support each other at such
a difficult time."
Joss sent a follow-up email the next
week as part of his mid-quarter mes
sage to all GSB students. I !e said he
appreciated the way students banded

together to remember the boys.
"I was especially inspired by Viet's
father, who. in such a trying and truly
awful time, had the grace and kind
ness to thank those who helped him
— such dignity and poise are an inspi
ration to us all," he said. "Like Viet's
father, I, too, am looking for the bright
spots in all of this. In these dark days,
I have found many such sources of
comfort. First and foremost, I have
been inspired by the support the
entire community has given to one
another. Many of you have extended
an unparalleled effort and generosity
— you have listened, prayed, regaled
each other with memories, and pro
vided all sorts of emotional and moral
support."
"Most importantly, you have
accepted that grief takes many forms,
and have listened without judging,
accepted one another's varied reac
tions and sought to help one another
in whatever form is most needed." he
added.
Joss also commended students for
recognizing that all members of the
community are affected by the loss
and are working cooperatively to
identify and implement means of com
fort.
"I was moved by the vision many
of you have painted of what Chris,
Micah and Viet strove for — a com
munity in which every one of us is
inspired to be true to ourselves and to
fulfill our highest potential," he wrote.
"A community where each of us is
accepted and embraced for our
uniqueness. A community where each
of us dreams lofty dreams, and then
commits to the work to make those
dreams a reality. I hope and believe
that the events of this past week will
bring us closer to realizing that noble
vision."
