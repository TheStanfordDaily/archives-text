## Vice presidential candidate takes on late-night comedy Palin smiles as SNL mocks her anew 
### GLEN JOHNSON THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
After watching "Saturday Night Live" make
fun of her from afar, Sarah Palin witnessed it first
hand as Tina Fey engaged in fiction by depicting
her at the news conference the Republican vice
presidential nominee has yet to hold.
Later, Palin came on stage during the
"Weekend Update" mock news segment and
bobbed to the beat as cast member Amy Poehler
performed a rap song the Alaska governor decid
ed was too hardcore to perform herself.
"I'm Jeremiah Wright 'cuz I'm the preacher, I
got a bookish look and you're all hot for teacher,"
Poehler rapped as actors dressed as Eskimos.
Palin's husband, Todd, and a moose pranced
across the stage.
The appearance was anticipated since
September, when Fey began portraying Palin just
after GOP presidential nominee John McCain
selected the then-little-known governor as his run
ning mate. The two look alike, and Palin remarked
that people had often told her she resembled the
actor.
In the shows opening, Fey's Palin told a news
conference: "First off. I just want to say how excit
ed I am to be in front of both the liberal elite
media as well as the liberal regular media. I am
looking forward to a portion of your questions."
Moments later, the camera cut away to the real
Palin watching a television monitor alongside the
show's executive producer, Lome Michaels.
"You know, Lome, I just don't think it's a real
istic depiction of the way my press conferences
would have gone," Palin said. She said she wished
he would have let her do a sketch about "30
Rock," the NBC program in which Fey now stars.
That prompted Michaels to deadpan: "Honestly
not enough people know that show."
Palin then stood mute as Fey's "30 Rock" co
star. Alec Baldwin came by. mistook Palin for Fey
and pleaded with Michaels not to let the actor go
onstage with the governor.
"This is the most important election in our
nation's history and you want her. our Tina, to go
out there and stand with that horrible woman?"
Baldwin said.
When Michaels broke down and introduced
him to Palin. Baldwin feigned embarrassment and
replied: "I see. Forgive me. I feel I must say this:
You are way hotter in person."
Palin got even, saying: "Thank you, and 1 must
say. your brother Stephen is my favorite Baldwin
brother."
The camera soon cut back to Fey who
answered a question about the polls.
"I don't worry about the polls. Polls are just a
fancy way of systematically predicting what's
going to happen. The only poll I care about is the
North Pole, and that ... is ... melting. It's not
great."
The real Palin then walked onto the news con
ference set. and Fey fled.
"Thank you. thank you." the governor said to
applause from the studio audience. "No, I'm not
going to take any of your questions, but I do
wanted to take this opportunity to say,' Live from
New York, it's Saturday Night.'"

governor made a stop by Studio 8H the next day to appear on Saturday Night Live, which frequently parodies the candidate.
