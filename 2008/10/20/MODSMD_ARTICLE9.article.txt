Taliban kill around 30 people after
stopping bus
Taliban militants stopped a bus traveling on
Afghanistan's main highway through a dangerous part
of the country's south, seized about 50 people on board
and killed around 30 of them, officials said Sunday.
A Taliban spokesman took responsibility for the
attack but claimed to have killed 27 Afghan army sol
diers. Afghan officials said no soldiers were aboard and
all the victims were civilians.
Militants stopped the bus traveling in a two-bus con
voy in a Taliban-controlled area about 40 miles west of
Kandahar, said provincial police chief Matiullah Khan.
He said two buses had been traveling together, and
the militants had tried to stop the first one but failed.
He said the insurgents fired at the first bus, killing a
child on board.
Officials offered varying death tolls from the attack,
which occurred in an area where government forces
cannot travel safely without heavy military protection.
That may explain why news of Thursday's killings did
not emerge until Sunday.
Stevens to get final chance to explain gifts
Sen.Ted Stevens will get one final chance next week
to explain the expensive gifts and thousands of dollars
in free work on his Alaska chalet, as the Republican
lawmaker's corruption trial comes to a close just days
before he faces re-election.
Stevens angrily jousted with prosecutor Brenda
Morris on Friday as she pressed him about the more
than $250.(XK) in renovations and other gifts he received
through millionaire businessman Bill Allen, who found
ed VECO Corp., an oil services company in Alaska.
Stevens is charged with trying to hide the gifts and
free work by lying on Senate financial disclosure forms.
Stevens insists that he and his wife paid all the renova
tion bills that were given to them,
"If it was a gift, why did I ask for a bill?" said Stevens
in one exchange with Morris.
"To cover your butt," Morris said calmly.
"That wasn't fair, ma'am." Stevens replied.
The trial has jeopardized one of the Senate's storied
careers. An imposing figure in Alaska politics since
before statehood. Stevens is now fighting to hold onto a
Senate seat he has held for generations.
