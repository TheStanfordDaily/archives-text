## Palin, McCain disagree on gay marriage ban 
### ASSOCIATED PRESS 
NEW YORK (AP) — Republican
vice presidential nominee Sarah
Palin says she supports a constitu
tional amendment banning gay mar
riage. a break with John McCain
who has said he believes states
should be left to define what mar
riage is.
In an interview with Christian
Broadcasting Network, the Alaska
governor said she had voted in
1998 for a state amendment ban
ning same sex marriage and hoped
to see a federal ban on such unions.
"I have voted along with the
vast majority of Alaskans w ho had
the opportunity to vote to amend
our Constitution defining marriage
as between one man and one
woman. 1 wish on a federal level
that's where we would go. I don't
support gay marriage." Palin said.
She said she believed traditional
marriage is the foundation for
strong families.
McCain, an Arizona senator, is
supporting a ballot initiative in his
state this year that would ban gay
marriage. But he has consistently
and forcefully opposed a federal
marriage amendment, saying it
would usurp states' authority on
such matters.

As governor, Palin vetoed a bill
that would have denied benefits to
the partners of gay state employees.
In a debate with Democratic rival
Joe Biden. Palin said she was "toler
ant" of gays and said she supported
certain legal protections for same
sex couples, like hospital visitation
rights.
Biden. meanwhile, said during an
appearance Monday on "The Ellen
DeGeneres Show" that if he lived in
California he would vote against a
ballot measure that seeks to ban gav
marriage. DeGeneres. who is gay
and newly wed to actress Portia de
Rossi, has urged Californians to
reject Proposition 8.
"1 think it's regressive," the
Delaware senator said. "I think it's
unfair, and so 1 vote 'no.'"
Biden added that he and Barack
Obama.the Democratic presidential
nominee, opposed a similar initia
tive nationally. In the debate with
Palin, Biden said he supporters part
nerships rights for gays and lesbians,
although he also opposes same-sex
marriage.
In the CBN interview, Palin also
said she would speak out if she
heard a supporter at a rally yell vio
lent or threatening comments about
Barack Obama. the Democratic
presidential nominee.
