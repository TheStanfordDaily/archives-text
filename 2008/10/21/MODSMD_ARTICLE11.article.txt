## Editorial CDC must step up in era of economic strife 
### 
In these volatile economic times, job
searching Stanford students face
unimaginable challenges. Students will
meet the worst job market since the Great
Depression, but they cannot count on re
ceiving extensive help from Stanford. The
Career Development Center (CDC) is sur
prisingly limited in its capabilities, and more
importantly, is not doing enough for stu
dents in light of the current job market. The
editorial board recommends the CDC offer
more career resources in such chaotic times
and also provide better assistance to stu
dents of all academic backgrounds.
The most damning inadequacy of the
CDC is its failure to change its offerings to
reflect the poor job market. The main re
source students have is speaking with a
counselor — the same remedy the CDC has
long prescribed for all job-related ailments,
from help with resumes to interview prac
tice. Speaking with a counselor may be help
ful, but t he CDC should be devoting all of its
resources, manpower and innovation to per
forming the best possible services for stu
dents.
The CDC needs to go above and beyond
the norm. Instead of expecting students to
come to it in these troubled economic times,
the CDC should reach out to the student
body. Perhaps the CDC could offer a few in
formation sessions on industries that are hir
ing in large numbers despite the economic
downturn, or host a seminar about job op
portunities students may never have consid
ered, such as fellowships or grants.
The center's job posting and information
Web site, cardinalcareers.stanford.edu. is
perhaps the most glaring example of the
center's inadequacies. Cardinal Careers is
the sole job application channel offered by
the CDC. Students register their personal in
formation, resume and cover letters. They
can then apply to specific jobs through the
site, or companies can contact students after
viewing their information.
Considering that Stanford is a leader in
technological innovation, our career Web
site is frankly embarrassing. For example,
the site's drop-down tab menus make navi

gating the site incredibly time-consuming.
The system also keeps track of all submitted
applications on the 'interviews" page, but
students cannot filter this list to show only
current applications. Instead, they must sift
through every application ever submitted,
regardless of whether or not the application
is active or if the position even exists any
more. While the home page offers a calendar
to which students can add "Personal
Events," there is no direct way to set up
email reminders for application deadlines, a
seemingly easy and helpful feature to add.
While these features are inconvenient
and the aesthetics displeasing, the far more
detrimental feature of Cardinal Careers is
its unabashed bias towards finance and engi
neering positions. A keyword search for "en
gineer" turns up 613 job posting results and
"computer" prompts 696. while "invest
ment" and "finance" turn up 275 and 319, re
spectively On the other hand, "music" re
turns 41 job results."politics" returns 17, and
"non-profit" returns 104.The CDC needs to
do more to show students interested in non
technical fields that there are career options
other than law or education.
To make matters worse, applicants can be
restricted from applying to certain jobs
based on their major. For example, an urban
studies major who has worked in consulting
for the last two summers would be preclud
ed from applying to Navigant Consulting,
simply because Cardinal Careers has filters
in place to limit application abilities. While
employers are probably looking for students
with a certain education background, the
burden of assessing candidates should be
solely the privilege of the company, not the
career center. The CDC should be maximiz
ing opportunities for students, not restricting
them.
The most unacceptable failing of the
CDC's Web site is the excruciating presence
of errors that have impacted student job ap
plications. From duplicate postings of the
same position, to the misprinting of dead
lines— which was the case with Bain and
