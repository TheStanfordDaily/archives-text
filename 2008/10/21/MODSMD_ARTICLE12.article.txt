## Barack Obama should bail out the American economy 
### 
Senator Barack Obama has again sur
passed all fundraising expectations and
raised $150 million in the month of Sep
tember, doubling his own fundraising record
of $66 million set the month before. His
fundraising over the past two months is
more than almost any presidential candi
date. ever.
John McCain, for his part, fundraised
nothing, as he is limited to spending $84 mil
lion under public financing rules. His cam
paign— in violation of the spirit of Mc-
Cain's own campaign-finance legislation —
is directing fundraisers to the Republican
National Committee, which continues to
pull in huge amounts of money and spend it
on McCain's behalf.
Despite the fact that Obama has much
more money than seems necessary, his cam
paign continues to ask for money. His cam
paign manager David Plouffe sent out an
email yesterday to supporters announcing
how much the campaign had raised.
"It's not too late to own a piece of this
campaign." Plouffe wrote."ln fact, your sup
port is needed more urgently now than ever
before. Watch the video anil make a dona
tion today." Despite fundraising $5 million
per day last month, the campaign still sends
out daily emails asking for money. As if the
campaign needs it.
I can imagine what Obama does with all
the money he hasn't spent: overworked
Obama staffers are told to "take a break in
the Vault" and dive into the campaign vault,
where they roll around in Benjamins sent in
by college professors, Scarlett Johansson
and Oprah fans.The job's best perk for sure.
Given that Obama is already outspend
ing Senator John McCain four-to-one in
most swing states, it's not entirely clear how
much more money Obama needs to defeat
McCain, and whether additional dollars now
will actually lead to additional votes.
Obama's huge financial advantage has
caused him problems before. When fighting
Ilillary Clinton in Pennsylvania,he outspent
her three-to-one, but still lost the state by 10
points. A similar result happened in Ohio.
It's hard to imagine that Obama could drop
another $100 million he has not already
committed in the next three weeks and not
waste the vast majority of it.
TV advertisements, to which most cam
paign funds are directed, certainly exhibit

the principle of "diminishing returns." If vot
ers have seen nine TV ads in the span of an
hour, it is unlikely that the tenth will change
their minds. Obama raised record amounts
in the primaries which enabled him to out
last Hillary Clinton, but also spent record
amounts, baiely defeating the greatly out
spent and bankrupt Clinton in the end.
Obama's financial record has inspired con
servative critics to snarkily observe that
Obama's spending record compares to how
"tax-and-spend liberals" use government
money: unwisely, and a lot of it.
There's certainly a better use for all the
money Obama has raised: bailing out the
American economy. It's clear that in the
final month of the election. Obama is going
to raise something like $150 bajillion and
not have any real use for it. Rather than
going toward the Obama 2012 reelection
campaign, or funding exceptionally lavish
inauguration parties, Obama can put this
money to good use: immediately bailing out
the American economy. We need it, to be
certain, with a recession looking more and
more likely and the credit markets still
locked up.
I can even think of a good place to start
with the bailout and "liquidity injections"
(which honestly do not sound all that appe
tizing): my bank account. It's grown smaller
in recent months, though not necessarily due
to the stock market or declining house
prices. But that doesn't matter. It has grown
smaller.That's what matters. I can even think
of good taglines for this: "Investing in a
Youth" and "Supporting Tomorrow's
Leader." Something like that. Obama has no
idea what to do with his embarrassment of
riches. I am not yet rich. I think this sounds
like something that has traction.
