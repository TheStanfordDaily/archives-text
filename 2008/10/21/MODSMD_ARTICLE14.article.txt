# Executive Experiences
## I am woman, hear me roar 
### 
The past week of Daily journalism has
given us some novel and improbable
ideas to consider. For example,"Seniors
consider grad school." No way.
In addition, recently our college newsprint
has featured a rehash of the ongoing revela
tion that Stanford students are, over all.
mediocre sports fans.
Neither of these stories are news — espe
cially the latter. You know it. I know it. We've
acknowledged this truth for time immemori
al. but our behavior doesn't change.
It's time to take the matter into our own
hands.
First, a reality check: not all fans are lack
ing. Among us are true, Cardinal-blooded
men and women who cheer and jump and ac
tually know the rules of the game we're
watching.
But then there are those students who
stand there, giggling. Hipping their hair, tex
ting and drooling on themselves.
I'm talking, by and large,about girls.
If you've ever sat with me at a Stanford
sports game, you've been subjected to a loud,
continuous string of expletives whose intensi
ty and creativity would make my column look

like Sunday-school reading material by com
parison. Being a fan, especially for a college
team, is not a passive role. It's a responsibility
and a privilege that we all share.
So when I start a cheer in the student sec
tion. be it "To-by Ger-hart" or "Cal has her
pes," why do I see so many girls standing
there, mutely playing with their lip gloss as if
they were at a middle-school dance?
i get it. You want to be hott (with two"t"s,
for emphasis. Like Paris Hilton. She is way
hott). You're afraid that yelling will make you
less so.
But have you considered how much your
stock will rise if word gets out that you can
talk competently about two-point conver

sions? Guys dig girls who dig sports. Or, at
least, girls who stand up and root for their
school.
Maybe you just don't want to put yourself
out there, because yelling is potentially em
barrassing. (I. who find plenty of other forums
in which to embarrass myself, can only wish I
had some dignity to protect.) I have several
good female friends who are also avid sports
fans. Accusing players on the other teams of
bestiality, illiteracy and future employment at
McDonald's — foreshadowing my basket
ball season pre-game monologue — isn't re
ally their style.
That's really okay. My approach isn't nec
essarily the best — maybe I shouldn't be
quite so comfortable being completely be
ligerent. But at least I'm loud. The point is.
that in our different ways, my friends and I all
engage and vocalize our support for our
team.
If you're going to come to a Stanford
sports game, you have to cheer. You don't
have to be obnoxious or obscene, but you
have to do something.

You might think that not cheering
doesn't do any harm, but it does. It
prevents those of us who are actually
trying to do our job from mobilizing
and doing it well.
Ladies, 1 don't want to have to
fight you. We're the same, after all. I
too like Project Runway and gossip
and mani-pedis and Mariah Carey (I
seriously do. "Always Be My Baby"
must be the greatest song of all time).
The game needs us. Our feminine
charm mobilized in tandem with raw
male testosterone is an unstoppable
combination.
During the Arizona game two
weeks ago, my boyfriend, who is. inci
dentally, way hot (with only one t. be
cause he is not like Paris Hilton) was
sitting right behind two girls who had
spent the past two hours completely
engrossed in their cell phones. In the
dramatic final moments of the game,
he veiled to everyone in our section

to make some noise. Flipping her
hair, one of the girls turned to him
and said/Tin taking care of my busi
ness. Why don't you just leave me
alone and just take care of yours?"
Because you're at a football game,
sweetie. Because no hot guy is paying
any attention to you right now, so you
might as well do something produc
tive. Because you look stupid when
you don't cheer, and awesome when
you do.
What business did this girl have to
do at a football game besides cheer,
anyway?
I want you, the women of Stan
ford, at the football game this Satur
day. I don't want to just see you there
— I want to hear you, too.
Think of that bratty, coke-snorting
kid you went to high school with who
crashed his BMW into a tree and
then Daddy bought him a new one
the next day. He goes to USC, and
you want to be there to see him cry
into the popped collar of his pink
polo shirt.
But if you're going to stand there,
lifeless and inert, then don't hold the
rest of us down.

There are a lot of great sports fans
on the Stanford campus. Now it's
time for the other half of us to arrive.
So get out there. Get pumped. Learn
the rules. If you don't know them, ask
a hot guy. I'm sure he'd be delighted
to tell you.
