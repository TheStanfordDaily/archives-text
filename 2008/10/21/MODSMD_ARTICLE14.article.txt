# Executive Experiences
## I am woman, hear me roar 
### 
The past week of Daily journalism has
given us some novel and improbable
ideas to consider. For example,"Seniors
consider grad school." No way.
In addition, recently our college newsprint
has featured a rehash of the ongoing revela
tion that Stanford students are, over all.
mediocre sports fans.
Neither of these stories are news — espe
cially the latter. You know it. I know it. We've
acknowledged this truth for time immemori
al. but our behavior doesn't change.
It's time to take the matter into our own
hands.
First, a reality check: not all fans are lack
ing. Among us are true, Cardinal-blooded
men and women who cheer and jump and ac
tually know the rules of the game we're
watching.
But then there are those students who
stand there, giggling. Hipping their hair, tex
ting and drooling on themselves.
I'm talking, by and large,about girls.
If you've ever sat with me at a Stanford
sports game, you've been subjected to a loud,
continuous string of expletives whose intensi
ty and creativity would make my column look

like Sunday-school reading material by com
parison. Being a fan, especially for a college
team, is not a passive role. It's a responsibility
and a privilege that we all share.
So when I start a cheer in the student sec
tion. be it "To-by Ger-hart" or "Cal has her
pes," why do I see so many girls standing
there, mutely playing with their lip gloss as if
they were at a middle-school dance?
i get it. You want to be hott (with two"t"s,
for emphasis. Like Paris Hilton. She is way
hott). You're afraid that yelling will make you
less so.
But have you considered how much your
stock will rise if word gets out that you can
talk competently about two-point conver

sions? Guys dig girls who dig sports. Or, at
least, girls who stand up and root for their
school.
Maybe you just don't want to put yourself
out there, because yelling is potentially em
barrassing. (I. who find plenty of other forums
in which to embarrass myself, can only wish I
had some dignity to protect.) I have several
good female friends who are also avid sports
fans. Accusing players on the other teams of
bestiality, illiteracy and future employment at
McDonald's — foreshadowing my basket
ball season pre-game monologue — isn't re
ally their style.
That's really okay. My approach isn't nec
essarily the best — maybe I shouldn't be
quite so comfortable being completely be
ligerent. But at least I'm loud. The point is.
that in our different ways, my friends and I all
engage and vocalize our support for our
team.
If you're going to come to a Stanford
sports game, you have to cheer. You don't
have to be obnoxious or obscene, but you
have to do something.
