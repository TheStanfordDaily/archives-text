Well, at least Cal still sucks. That was
the predominant thought that circu
lated in my brain as I closed my eyes
and gradually became unconscious. It was
Saturday night, and Stanford football had
just suffered a gut-wrenching,stomach punch
of a loss at the hands of UCLA. All week long
we had been hearing about what a momen
tous game this was going to be for Stanford, a
game about which coach Jim Harbaugh had
commented, "I'm not going to call it life or
death, but it's close."
We were so close to life. And then ...
ooooooffff. Haymaker to the babymaker.
In years past, this might have been a
"here-we-go-gain" moment. Stanford foot
ball has broken our hearts before. I remem
ber Notre Dame a few years back, when we
forgot to play the fourth quarter. I remember
Big Game my freshman year. Thankfully. I
have forgotten most of the 2(X)6 football sea
son.

When adversity strikes me. I usually re
spond by drinking beer and crying uncontrol
lably, while staring at myself in the mirror. I
am sure most of you readers can relate.
Hut I have faith that our football team will
respond differently.The going is tough, but so
is our hero, senior Clinton Snyder (despite
the fact that he backed out of grabbing lunch
again â€” this past Sunday. Great player?
The greatest. Great friend? Very much in
question).
Iliis year feels a little different from those

past, even from last year.This year, there has
been a palpable change in our team's identi
ty. We are for real. You can see it in our play
ers' eyes. I've seen it when I've spoken with
my friends on the team.They believe in each
other,and they believe in coach God-baugh.
So whnt's my point,beyond this posturing,
pontificating and prophesizing? That we can
still make it to a bowl game, but no football
team is an island. Now more than ever, we as
fans need to stop with our beer drinking and
mirror crying exercises, and get off our re
spective Faccbook profiles come Saturday.
It's the stretch run for Stanford football. No
more time for fair-weather fandom. We go to
Stanford.The weather is already fair.There's
no excuse for not showing up.
So far. the turnout to games has been
unimpressive, to say the least. To both of the
dedicated fans who somehow managed,
