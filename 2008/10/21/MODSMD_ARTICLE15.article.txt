## A 						stadium of seats packed with empty people

Well, at least Cal still sucks. That was
the predominant thought that circu
lated in my brain as I closed my eyes
and gradually became unconscious. It was
Saturday night, and Stanford football had
just suffered a gut-wrenching,stomach punch
of a loss at the hands of UCLA. All week long
we had been hearing about what a momen
tous game this was going to be for Stanford, a
game about which coach Jim Harbaugh had
commented, "I'm not going to call it life or
death, but it's close."
We were so close to life. And then ...
ooooooffff. Haymaker to the babymaker.
In years past, this might have been a
"here-we-go-gain" moment. Stanford foot
ball has broken our hearts before. I remem
ber Notre Dame a few years back, when we
forgot to play the fourth quarter. I remember
Big Game my freshman year. Thankfully. I
have forgotten most of the 2(X)6 football sea
son.

When adversity strikes me. I usually re
spond by drinking beer and crying uncontrol
lably, while staring at myself in the mirror. I
am sure most of you readers can relate.
Hut I have faith that our football team will
respond differently.The going is tough, but so
is our hero, senior Clinton Snyder (despite
the fact that he backed out of grabbing lunch
again — this past Sunday. Great player?
The greatest. Great friend? Very much in
question).
Iliis year feels a little different from those

past, even from last year.This year, there has
been a palpable change in our team's identi
ty. We are for real. You can see it in our play
ers' eyes. I've seen it when I've spoken with
my friends on the team.They believe in each
other,and they believe in coach God-baugh.
So whnt's my point,beyond this posturing,
pontificating and prophesizing? That we can
still make it to a bowl game, but no football
team is an island. Now more than ever, we as
fans need to stop with our beer drinking and
mirror crying exercises, and get off our re
spective Faccbook profiles come Saturday.
It's the stretch run for Stanford football. No
more time for fair-weather fandom. We go to
Stanford.The weather is already fair.There's
no excuse for not showing up.
So far. the turnout to games has been
unimpressive, to say the least. To both of the
dedicated fans who somehow managed,


Mark
Donig
k
through various trial and tribulation,
to make it all the way from Wilbur to
Stanford Stadium to watch our foot
ball team dramatically beat Arizona,
you are to be commended for your
suffering. Let's hope a few others find
the courage to follow your example.
The difference between a rock
ing, packed house and a half-filled
ghost-town stadium is not foreign to
me, both as a fan and as a former Lit
tle League player (I had the reputa
tion of just not being able to turn it
on when there were less than five
parents in the stands).
I grew up not far from here, an
avid Giants fanatic. I remember
going to games at old Candlestick
Park, a place with about the same
level of charm as Hepatitis. The
swirling gales gave a wind chill factor
that forced me into layers in the mid
dle of the summer.
Candlestick Park was not made

with the fans in mind, and the fans re
sponded by leaving the turnstiles un
turned during the losing seasons. But
I'll never forget those last few years
at the 'Stick, when the Giants started
winning, and the stadium started to
get packed come the stretch run. It
was an unforgettable experience as a
spectator, and many of our beloved
warriors on the field acknowledged
that it made them kick their game up
a notch.
So when did this school, and this
community, lose the culture of cele
brating Saturday by supporting the
home team? As recently as 2001, we
averaged over 51.000 fans per game.
Granted, it is slightly hyperbolic to
say two people showed up in our
game against Arizona. But our per
formance as fans does not match our
players' efforts on the field.
Why can we not fill up our beauti
ful new — and. mind you, recently
downsized — Stanford Stadium
with beautiful new fans? You look
up at the stands, and you see rows
upon rows of seats filled with empty
people. And I am not just talking
about the nosebleed section.

Do you know the feeling of
50.000 people screaming their col
lective heads off for one team? It's
an energy you can never forget. It's
an energy that we can do our part to
recreate here, with our own team, in
our stadium.
It's crunch time, babies, and this
time, we can help. Let's get this stadi
um rockin' and rollin'. Help (ierhart
scamper. Help McAndrew domi
nate. Help Snyder fly. Let's show up
for next Saturday against Washing
ton State, and let's all be able to say
"I was there when Stanford beat
USC — again." We can help lift our
team to our first bowl berth in seven
years. We just have to show up. So
let's show up.
Come to Stanford Stadium this
Saturday. Come, to paraphrase a
wise man named President, and let
your wines take dream.

Mark Donig is showing up to the game
this Saturday to support the team, along

dle of the summer.
Candlestick Park was not made

with the fans in mind, and the fans re
sponded by leaving the turnstiles un
turned during the losing seasons. But
I'll never forget those last few years
at the 'Stick, when the Giants started
winning, and the stadium started to
get packed come the stretch run. It
was an unforgettable experience as a
spectator, and many of our beloved
warriors on the field acknowledged
that it made them kick their game up
a notch.
So when did this school, and this
community, lose the culture of cele
brating Saturday by supporting the
home team? As recently as 2001, we
averaged over 51.000 fans per game.
Granted, it is slightly hyperbolic to
say two people showed up in our
game against Arizona. But our per
formance as fans does not match our
players' efforts on the field.
Why can we not fill up our beauti
ful new — and. mind you, recently
downsized — Stanford Stadium
with beautiful new fans? You look
up at the stands, and you see rows
upon rows of seats filled with empty
people. And I am not just talking
about the nosebleed section.

Do you know the feeling of
50.000 people screaming their col
lective heads off for one team? It's
an energy you can never forget. It's
an energy that we can do our part to
recreate here, with our own team, in
our stadium.
It's crunch time, babies, and this
time, we can help. Let's get this stadi
um rockin' and rollin'. Help (ierhart
scamper. Help McAndrew domi
nate. Help Snyder fly. Let's show up
for next Saturday against Washing
ton State, and let's all be able to say
"I was there when Stanford beat
USC — again." We can help lift our
team to our first bowl berth in seven
years. We just have to show up. So
let's show up.
Come to Stanford Stadium this
Saturday. Come, to paraphrase a
wise man named President, and let
your wines take dream.

Mark Donig is showing up to the game
this Saturday to support the team, along
with 49,99V Stanford faithful. If you
would like to tailgate with him, please
contact him at mrdonig@stanford.edu.
