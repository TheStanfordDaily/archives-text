### ANARGHYA VARDHANA STAFF WRITER 
A crowd of fans waited with baited breath as Stan
ford sophomore Camille Gandhi swung hard.The puck
sailed through the air and gently landed in the goal. As
shouts and screams pierced the stadium, Gandhi was
suddenly surrounded by her teammates jumping up
and down, hoisting her up in the air.jubilant at their vic
tory.
However, none of her teammates were Stanford stu
dent-athletes. They were members of the USA U-2I
National Team — Gandhi had just taken the winning
shot in overtime of the gold-medal match against C hile,
leading the United States to a 2-1 victory in the 74th
minute.
Gandhi started four of the five contests in the Junior
Pan-American Games in Mexico City, scoring three
goals overall — the last one being the most important
and memorable. The gold-medal match provided a big
stage for Gandhi to show off her skills.
Hie U.S. coach called for a straight strike from the
sidelines, and Gandhi shot it perfectly.
"That was the best field hockey 1 have ever played in
my life," Gandhi said.
And that's saying a lot for someone who already has
numerous titles — including being the 2007 NorPac
Rookie of the Year — under her belt.
Meanwhile, the Stanford women's team definitely
missed its top offensive player. Gandhi was absent for the
back-to-back one-goal losses the Cardinal suffered on its
East Coast road trip two weeks ago.
Gandhi was back on the Farm this week, and she
made her presence felt with two assists in a 3-0 win over
Davidson last Tuesday. She provided a much-needed
spark for the Cardinal women, who seeixjj|ti to regain
their ferocity and determination after droppmg the pre

tempts and assists this year, with 36 and seven respective
