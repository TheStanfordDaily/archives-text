A crowd of fans waited with baited breath as Stan

shot in overtime of the gold-medal match against C hile,
leading the United States to a 2-1 victory in the 74th
minute.
Gandhi started four of the five contests in the Junior
Pan-American Games in Mexico City, scoring three
goals overall — the last one being the most important

stage for Gandhi to show off her skills.

sidelines, and Gandhi shot it perfectly.
"That was the best field hockey 1 have ever played in
my life," Gandhi said.
And that's saying a lot for someone who already has
numerous titles — including being the 2007 NorPac
Rookie of the Year — under her belt.

missed its top offensive player. Gandhi was absent for the
back-to-back one-goal losses the Cardinal suffered on its
East Coast road trip two weeks ago.
Gandhi was back on the Farm this week, and she
made her presence felt with two assists in a 3-0 win over
Davidson last Tuesday. She provided a much-needed

playing for the USA U-21 National Team. The Cardinal takes on Cal this Friday and returns home on Sunday to play Pacific.

tuned offensive attack combined with
a relentless defense. Sophomore Xan

recorded the most shots in the game.
Junior Midori Uehara added to her
team lead in goals,securing her seventh
tally of the year, eight minutes into the
second half. The game was sealed with
freshman Stephanie Byrne's goal, her
fifth of the season, while keeper

kept the Cardinal in the game with four
saves. Stanford controlled the name

a huge margin. 17-5.

and senior Chloe Bade. Although
statistics from the match will not
count towards regular-season totals
(Davis is a club team that will be
joining the NorPac Conference as
an affiliate member next season) the
win was still significant as Stanford
tries to build momentum going into
its final three games of the season.
Next up for the Cardinal is a
showdown with California on Fri

"We have some important games
coming up to close our conference
play; we play University of Pacific

times," Byrne said. "Closing confer

very tangible goal for us. We know
that we have to come out hard in the
first half and hold that intensity all
70 minutes."
The Stanford women are looking
to build on this week's success when
they take on their Northern Califor
