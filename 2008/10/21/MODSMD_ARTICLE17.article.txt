# For Rays, the Price is right

Jon Miller was excited. Very ex
cited. Tampa's rookie reliever
was blowing pitches past an im
posing Boston lineup and was doing
it with relative ease. The kid wasn't
daunted by the situation — the
most important in the franchise's
history. Miller, known for his more
restrained broadcasting style, and
his color man. Joe Morgan.couldn't
contain themselves.
They had heard of the pitcher
and had seen him throw a few in
nings in the playoffs and the latter
part of the year, but despite his po

season on the line. Yet there he was,

commentary was a bit hyperbolic.

MVP and had an excellent start in
Game 7. but the pitcher that the
sports world will talk about when
they remember this series will be
Price, the 23-year-old rookie who
was thrown into a huge role in the
postseason with injuries and incon
sistencies plaguing Tampa's
bullpen.
He walked into a situation that
could hardly have been more tense:
top of the eighth, two outs, bases
loaded and the Rays clinging to a 3-
I lead in Game 7 of the team's first
ALCS. Tampa shouldn't have even
been in this situation — it had held
a seven-run lead in the seventh in
ning of Game 5. needing just a hand
ful of outs to clinch its first pennant.
And yet here they were, facing an
extremely foreign scenario and a
