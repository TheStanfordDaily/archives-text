# For Rays, the Price is right
## 
### 
Jon Miller was excited. Very ex
cited. Tampa's rookie reliever
was blowing pitches past an im
posing Boston lineup and was doing
it with relative ease. The kid wasn't
daunted by the situation — the
most important in the franchise's
history. Miller, known for his more
restrained broadcasting style, and
his color man. Joe Morgan.couldn't
contain themselves.
They had heard of the pitcher
and had seen him throw a few in
nings in the playoffs and the latter
part of the year, but despite his po
tential and limited success, he was
still a late-September call-up. He
shouldn't be pitching now, with the
season on the line. Yet there he was,
slinging fastball after fastball and
slider after slider until the final
Red Sox batter was retired.
A star was born. David Price
had arrived.
I listened to the game live on the
radio, in a car on my way back from
L.A., and thought that perhaps the
commentary was a bit hyperbolic.
But after watching the final innings
later. I realized that the announc
ing team might have understated
Price's performance.
Matt Garza won the ALCS
MVP and had an excellent start in
Game 7. but the pitcher that the
sports world will talk about when
they remember this series will be
Price, the 23-year-old rookie who
was thrown into a huge role in the
postseason with injuries and incon
sistencies plaguing Tampa's
bullpen.
He walked into a situation that
could hardly have been more tense:
top of the eighth, two outs, bases
loaded and the Rays clinging to a 3-
I lead in Game 7 of the team's first
ALCS. Tampa shouldn't have even
been in this situation — it had held
a seven-run lead in the seventh in
ning of Game 5. needing just a hand
ful of outs to clinch its first pennant.
And yet here they were, facing an
extremely foreign scenario and a

team that had been there many
times before.
Tampa had brought in Dan
Wheeler, who had been the default
closer after Troy Percival went
down with an injury, with no outs in
the inning after Alex Cora reached
first on an error. But Wheeler had
given up three runs in Game 5, and
on Sunday he put another man on
base before getting his lone out. J.P.
Howell was able to force a David
Ortiz ground out, but Chad Brad
ford, who was brought in specifical
ly because of his good control,
walked Kevin Youkilis to load the
bases.
And so in came Price with all of
15 innings of big-league experience
under his belt — he picked up the
win in Game 2, but was still untest
ed. Nevertheless, manager Joe
Maddon didn't hesitate: he pulled
Bradford, a tested veteran with
playoff experience, in favor of the
rookie.
Of course. Price wasn't just any
September call-up. He was the first
pick in the 2007 draft out of Vander
bilt, where he went 11-1 in his junior
year while striking out nearly 200
batters in just 133.1 innings. Nearly
every expert pegged the lefty as the
No. 1 pick in the June draft, and the
Rays pounced on him. Overnight, he
became the best pitching prospect in
the franchise's short history.
He didn't sign until August of
2007, but upon inking the second
largest draft contract in history, he
rocketed through Tampa's minor
league system — he had a combined
11 -0 record in Single and Double A.
and was in Triple A Durham less
than a year after signing.
On Sept. 14. Price made his
debut in the big leagues and pitched
over five innings of relief against
the New York Yankees. He made
one start late in the year, but other
wise found himself pitching out of
the bullpen.

Tampa's young phenom made
enough of an impression to earn a
spot on the postseason roster, but
he didn't play against Chicago in
the ALDS. Entering Game 7 of the
ALCS. Price had just one inning of
postseason work.
No matter. With the bases
loaded and Boston on the verge of
yet another miraculous comeback.
Price struck out J.D. Drew on four
pitches to get the Rays out of the
eighth-inning jam.
Maddon stuck with Price in the
ninth inning. Jason Bay worked an
eight-pitch walk. Bay had a check
swing on 3-2 on a ball that was just
outside, but the call could have gone
either way. Price immediately
bounced back, striking out both
Mark Kotsay and Jason Varitek.
Price has three main pitches in
his arsenal: a high 90s fastball, a
high 80s slider, and a changeup.
Price stuck to his bread and butter
against the Sox on Sunday— the
fastball and slider— and was ab
solutely dominant. The best Drew.
Kotsay or Varitek could do was
swing in the near vicinity of the ball
and hope to make contact.
Stanford alum Jed Lowrie was
the last chance for the Red Sox. Price
got him to ground out to second
baseman Akinori Iwamura. ending
the game and giving the Rays their
first pennant in franchise history.
Price's line? 1.1 innings, zero
hits, zero runs, three strike outs, one
walk and the save. Not bad for a
rookie in his eighth major-league
game.
Like other top pitching
prospects who begin their careers in
the bullpen (See: Chamberlain,
Joba). Price has a higher calling as a
starter. And for 30 minutes in Octo
ber. Price displayed exactly why
he's such a touted prospect.
Jon Miller was right to be excit
ed. We witnessed the beginning of
something special.

Matt Garza won the ALCS
MVP and had an excellent start in
Game 7. but the pitcher that the
sports world will talk about when
they remember this series will be
Price, the 23-year-old rookie who
was thrown into a huge role in the
postseason with injuries and incon
sistencies plaguing Tampa's
bullpen.
He walked into a situation that
could hardly have been more tense:
top of the eighth, two outs, bases
loaded and the Rays clinging to a 3-
I lead in Game 7 of the team's first
ALCS. Tampa shouldn't have even
been in this situation — it had held
a seven-run lead in the seventh in
ning of Game 5. needing just a hand
ful of outs to clinch its first pennant.
And yet here they were, facing an
extremely foreign scenario and a

Between the lines
team that had been there many
times before.
Tampa had brought in Dan
Wheeler, who had been the default
closer after Troy Percival went
down with an injury, with no outs in
the inning after Alex Cora reached
first on an error. But Wheeler had
given up three runs in Game 5, and
on Sunday he put another man on
base before getting his lone out. J.P.
Howell was able to force a David
Ortiz ground out, but Chad Brad
ford, who was brought in specifical
ly because of his good control,
walked Kevin Youkilis to load the
bases.
And so in came Price with all of
15 innings of big-league experience
under his belt — he picked up the
win in Game 2, but was still untest
ed. Nevertheless, manager Joe
Maddon didn't hesitate: he pulled
Bradford, a tested veteran with
playoff experience, in favor of the
rookie.
Of course. Price wasn't just any
September call-up. He was the first
pick in the 2007 draft out of Vander
bilt, where he went 11-1 in his junior
year while striking out nearly 200
batters in just 133.1 innings. Nearly
every expert pegged the lefty as the
No. 1 pick in the June draft, and the
Rays pounced on him. Overnight, he
became the best pitching prospect in
the franchise's short history.
He didn't sign until August of
2007, but upon inking the second
largest draft contract in history, he
rocketed through Tampa's minor
league system — he had a combined
11 -0 record in Single and Double A.
and was in Triple A Durham less
than a year after signing.
On Sept. 14. Price made his
debut in the big leagues and pitched
over five innings of relief against
the New York Yankees. He made
one start late in the year, but other
wise found himself pitching out of
the bullpen.

Tampa's young phenom made
enough of an impression to earn a
spot on the postseason roster, but
he didn't play against Chicago in
the ALDS. Entering Game 7 of the
ALCS. Price had just one inning of
postseason work.
No matter. With the bases
loaded and Boston on the verge of
yet another miraculous comeback.
Price struck out J.D. Drew on four
pitches to get the Rays out of the
eighth-inning jam.
Maddon stuck with Price in the
ninth inning. Jason Bay worked an
eight-pitch walk. Bay had a check
swing on 3-2 on a ball that was just
outside, but the call could have gone
either way. Price immediately
bounced back, striking out both
Mark Kotsay and Jason Varitek.
Price has three main pitches in
his arsenal: a high 90s fastball, a
high 80s slider, and a changeup.
Price stuck to his bread and butter
against the Sox on Sunday— the
fastball and slider— and was ab
solutely dominant. The best Drew.
Kotsay or Varitek could do was
swing in the near vicinity of the ball
and hope to make contact.
Stanford alum Jed Lowrie was
the last chance for the Red Sox. Price
got him to ground out to second
baseman Akinori Iwamura. ending
the game and giving the Rays their
first pennant in franchise history.
Price's line? 1.1 innings, zero
hits, zero runs, three strike outs, one
walk and the save. Not bad for a
rookie in his eighth major-league
game.
Like other top pitching
prospects who begin their careers in
the bullpen (See: Chamberlain,
Joba). Price has a higher calling as a
starter. And for 30 minutes in Octo
ber. Price displayed exactly why
he's such a touted prospect.
Jon Miller was right to be excit
ed. We witnessed the beginning of
something special.
