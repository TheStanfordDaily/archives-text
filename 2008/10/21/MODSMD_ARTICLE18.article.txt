## Stanford dominates No. 4 Bruins in LA massacre 
### KENAN JIANG CLAUDIA PRECIADO 
The No. 2 Stanford men's water polo team
triumphed in a pair of crucial road games this
weekend, taking down No. 4 UCLA on Satur
day at Rose Bowl Aquatics Center in Los An
geles and defeating UC-Santa Cruz on Sunday.
With the wins in hand, the Cardinal im
proves to 15-2 overall this season, and is 1-0 in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation

(MPSF). Stanford trails only USC in the rank

have come at the hands of the Trojans, a 10-3
loss on Sept.23 and an 8-7 defeat in overtime at
the SoCal Tournament on Oct. 12.
This weekend, the Cardinal pounded the
Bruins in a 12-2 blowout and shut down UC-
Santa Cruz, 14-2. Stanford's previous meeting
with Santa Cruz was also a massacre — the
Cardinal scored 22 goals and allowed only five.
Last week, senior captain Will Hindle-Katel

was named the MPSF co-Player of the Week
along with USC's J.W. Krumpholz. The acco
lade is Stanford's second weekly honor in the
2008 season — the first went to junior Janson
Wigo in mid-September for his offensive dom
inance.

Bruins. The Stanford defense held UCLA to
just four goals in an important early-season

win. Hindle-Katel's efforts also helped hold
USC two weekends ago to seven goals — just
half of its MPSF-leading average of 14 scores
per game.
Like the teams' first encounter two weeks
ago — in which the Cardinal jumped out to a 5-
0 advantage en route to a 7-4 win — Stanford
charged to an early 4-0 advantage in the first
quarter on Friday and the Bruins never recov-
