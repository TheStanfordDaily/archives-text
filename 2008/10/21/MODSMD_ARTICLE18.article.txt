# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Stanford dominates No. 4 Bruins in LA massacre 
### KENAN JIANG CLAUDIA PRECIADO 
The No. 2 Stanford men's water polo team
triumphed in a pair of crucial road games this
weekend, taking down No. 4 UCLA on Satur
day at Rose Bowl Aquatics Center in Los An
geles and defeating UC-Santa Cruz on Sunday.
With the wins in hand, the Cardinal im
proves to 15-2 overall this season, and is 1-0 in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation

(MPSF). Stanford trails only USC in the rank
ings. Stanford's only two losses this season
have come at the hands of the Trojans, a 10-3
loss on Sept.23 and an 8-7 defeat in overtime at
the SoCal Tournament on Oct. 12.
This weekend, the Cardinal pounded the
Bruins in a 12-2 blowout and shut down UC-
Santa Cruz, 14-2. Stanford's previous meeting
with Santa Cruz was also a massacre — the
Cardinal scored 22 goals and allowed only five.
Last week, senior captain Will Hindle-Katel

was named the MPSF co-Player of the Week
along with USC's J.W. Krumpholz. The acco
lade is Stanford's second weekly honor in the
2008 season — the first went to junior Janson
Wigo in mid-September for his offensive dom
inance.
I lindle-Katel.a utility player who often de
fends the opposition's two-meter man. was in
strumental in shutting down the then-No. 2
Bruins. The Stanford defense held UCLA to
just four goals in an important early-season

win. Hindle-Katel's efforts also helped hold
USC two weekends ago to seven goals — just
half of its MPSF-leading average of 14 scores
per game.
Like the teams' first encounter two weeks
ago — in which the Cardinal jumped out to a 5-
0 advantage en route to a 7-4 win — Stanford
charged to an early 4-0 advantage in the first
quarter on Friday and the Bruins never recov-
ered. The Cardinal defense continu
ally shut down the opposing attack
ers, limiting their scoring chances and
demoralizing the Bruins.
Utility player Janson Wigo, the
team's leading scorer,contributed his
eighth hat trick of the season to lead
the Cardinal. Hindle-Katel; senior
Chris Jacobson; juniors Ryan Mc-
Carthy, Drac Wigo and Sage Wright;
sophomores Alex Pulido and Jeffrey
Schwimer; and freshmen Peter
Sefton and Jacob Smith, each scored
one goal in a group effort to carry the
Cardinal. Junior captain Jimmie
Sandman made 11 saves, while soph
omore Brian Pingree contributed a
save in the fourth period.
"The win this weekend was very
important in our conference stand
ings," Drac Wigo explained. "Beating
UCLA by that much to start off our
conference schedule is good, [be
cause] it sets the tone. UCLA is a very
good team and beating them has def
initely boosted our confidence."
UCLA's Ben Hohl finally scored
at the 2:45 mark, making the score 4-
1 in the second period. But Stanford
quickly answered and went into half
time up 5-1.
Stanford dominated the Bruins in
the second half: The Cardinal came
out of the break with seven unan
swered goals. Bruin goalkeeper Chay
Lapin made two saves on the day but
gave up a season-high 12 goals. In the
last period, the Bruins managed just
one goal while Stanford scored five
to comfortably wrap up the game.
No. 4 UCLA is 9-4 on the year behind
No. 3 Cal (11-4).
The team then accomplished a
tough task by traveling to UC-Santa
Cruz to play a non-MPSF conference
game, easily defeating the Banana
Slugs by a score of 14-2. Stanford
once again clamped down on defense
and improved its overall record to an
outstanding 15-2 on the year, while
Santa Cruz is now 6-13.
Stanford came into the weekend's
games with a defensive mindset.
Teams have only managed to score
five goals per game against the Cardi
nal. second-best in the extremely
competitive MPSF. Only USC and
California. Stanford's main rivals in
the hunt for an NCAA title, have
managed to score double digits

against Stanford's stifling defense.
After the weekend, the Cardinal has
now held opponents to fewer than
five goals in 14 of its 17 games played.
Not to be outdone, the Stanford
offense had averaged an impressive
11.53 goals per game going into the
weekend, second best in the MPSF.
After the victories over UCLA and

Santa Cruz, Stanford now has 199
goals on the season. Janson Wigo
leads the team with 32 goals, fol
lowed by twin brother Drac Wigo at
28. Wright has added 20 scores as
well.
Stanford's offensive dominance
has been a product not only of its star
players, but also of its "defense-initi

ates-offense" mindset. The offense's
great depth, evidenced by the fact
that 10 players scored in Friday's de
feat of UCLA, has also greatly bene
fited the Cardinal, making it difficult
for opponents to focus on stopping
any one player. Janson Wigo was
third in the MPSF with 2.13 goals per
game going into the weekend, while

Drac averages 1.87 scores and was
seventh among MPSF players.
"I think I have made improve
ments on my defense in general, as
well as taking higher-quality shots,"
Drac Wigo said. "There are many
competitive teams in our conference,
so every game will be an important
win. If we keep up our solid team de

fense, we should do very well this
season."
Stanford will look to continue its
win streak this Wednesday against Pa
cific. 5 p.m. at Avery Aquatic Center.

With the wins in hand, the Cardinal im
proves to 15-2 overall this season, and is 1-0 in
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation

(MPSF). Stanford trails only USC in the rank
ings. Stanford's only two losses this season
have come at the hands of the Trojans, a 10-3
loss on Sept.23 and an 8-7 defeat in overtime at
the SoCal Tournament on Oct. 12.
This weekend, the Cardinal pounded the
Bruins in a 12-2 blowout and shut down UC-
Santa Cruz, 14-2. Stanford's previous meeting
with Santa Cruz was also a massacre — the
Cardinal scored 22 goals and allowed only five.
Last week, senior captain Will Hindle-Katel

was named the MPSF co-Player of the Week
along with USC's J.W. Krumpholz. The acco
lade is Stanford's second weekly honor in the
2008 season — the first went to junior Janson
Wigo in mid-September for his offensive dom
inance.
I lindle-Katel.a utility player who often de
fends the opposition's two-meter man. was in
strumental in shutting down the then-No. 2
Bruins. The Stanford defense held UCLA to
just four goals in an important early-season

win. Hindle-Katel's efforts also helped hold
USC two weekends ago to seven goals — just
half of its MPSF-leading average of 14 scores
per game.
Like the teams' first encounter two weeks
ago — in which the Cardinal jumped out to a 5-
0 advantage en route to a 7-4 win — Stanford
charged to an early 4-0 advantage in the first
quarter on Friday and the Bruins never recov-
ered. The Cardinal defense continu
ally shut down the opposing attack
ers, limiting their scoring chances and
demoralizing the Bruins.
Utility player Janson Wigo, the
team's leading scorer,contributed his
eighth hat trick of the season to lead
the Cardinal. Hindle-Katel; senior
Chris Jacobson; juniors Ryan Mc-
Carthy, Drac Wigo and Sage Wright;
sophomores Alex Pulido and Jeffrey
Schwimer; and freshmen Peter
Sefton and Jacob Smith, each scored
one goal in a group effort to carry the
Cardinal. Junior captain Jimmie
Sandman made 11 saves, while soph
omore Brian Pingree contributed a
save in the fourth period.
"The win this weekend was very
important in our conference stand
ings," Drac Wigo explained. "Beating
UCLA by that much to start off our
conference schedule is good, [be
cause] it sets the tone. UCLA is a very
good team and beating them has def
initely boosted our confidence."
UCLA's Ben Hohl finally scored
at the 2:45 mark, making the score 4-
1 in the second period. But Stanford
quickly answered and went into half
time up 5-1.
Stanford dominated the Bruins in
the second half: The Cardinal came
out of the break with seven unan
swered goals. Bruin goalkeeper Chay
Lapin made two saves on the day but
gave up a season-high 12 goals. In the
last period, the Bruins managed just
one goal while Stanford scored five
to comfortably wrap up the game.
No. 4 UCLA is 9-4 on the year behind
No. 3 Cal (11-4).
The team then accomplished a
tough task by traveling to UC-Santa
Cruz to play a non-MPSF conference
game, easily defeating the Banana
Slugs by a score of 14-2. Stanford
once again clamped down on defense
and improved its overall record to an
outstanding 15-2 on the year, while
Santa Cruz is now 6-13.
Stanford came into the weekend's
games with a defensive mindset.
Teams have only managed to score
five goals per game against the Cardi
nal. second-best in the extremely
competitive MPSF. Only USC and
California. Stanford's main rivals in
the hunt for an NCAA title, have
managed to score double digits

against Stanford's stifling defense.
After the weekend, the Cardinal has
now held opponents to fewer than
five goals in 14 of its 17 games played.
Not to be outdone, the Stanford
offense had averaged an impressive
11.53 goals per game going into the
weekend, second best in the MPSF.
After the victories over UCLA and

Santa Cruz, Stanford now has 199
goals on the season. Janson Wigo
leads the team with 32 goals, fol
lowed by twin brother Drac Wigo at
28. Wright has added 20 scores as
well.
Stanford's offensive dominance
has been a product not only of its star
players, but also of its "defense-initi

ates-offense" mindset. The offense's
great depth, evidenced by the fact
that 10 players scored in Friday's de
feat of UCLA, has also greatly bene
fited the Cardinal, making it difficult
for opponents to focus on stopping
any one player. Janson Wigo was
third in the MPSF with 2.13 goals per
game going into the weekend, while

Drac averages 1.87 scores and was
seventh among MPSF players.
"I think I have made improve
ments on my defense in general, as
well as taking higher-quality shots,"
Drac Wigo said. "There are many
competitive teams in our conference,
so every game will be an important
win. If we keep up our solid team de

fense, we should do very well this
season."
Stanford will look to continue its
win streak this Wednesday against Pa
cific. 5 p.m. at Avery Aquatic Center.
