# Card gets third place at home
## Women's golf hosts tourney, beats three of nation's best 
### STEPHEN ADAMSON 
The No. 19 Stanford women's golf team
is on a roll. Coming off a key victory at the
Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational last week,
the team shot a combined five-over-par
857 this past weekend at the Stanford In
tercollegiate to finish in third. Only No. 1
UCLA and No. 3 IJSC were better at the
event.
That's not to say the rest of the field was
poor, either. The Cardinal finished ahead
of three top-10 teams (No. 5 Oklahoma,
No. 6 Vanderbilt and No. 9 Duke) after a
weekend of highly competitive golf on the
Farm. Cardinal head coach Caroline O'-
Connor was pleased with her squad's ef
forts, viewing this weekend as a good sign
of improvement for the team.
"UCLA and USC certainly separated
themselves from the rest of the field," O'-
Connor said."but I think as we continue to
improve through the next few months,
we'll close that gap."
The two Los Angeles schools dominat
ed, as was expected going into the week
end. IJCLA shot a combined eight-under
par 844 while USC shot a five-under 847.
Lizettc Salas of I JSC finished first individ
ually with a score of seven under (206).
Sophomore Rebecca Durham led the
way individually for the Cardinal, finish
ing in a tie for ninth overall, shooting one
under par (212). O'Connor has been very
impressed with Durham's play this year.
"| Rebecca]'s really emerging as a solid
and consistent performer, as evidenced by

her finish this week," she said.
The Cardinal continues to get strong
contributions from its experienced mem
bers and its youngsters alike. Senior co
captain Mari Chun and talented freshman
Sydney Burlison each finished two over
par (215), tying for 14th overall. Burlison
shot the tournament's lowest Sunday
score, sinking six final-round birdies on
her way to score a three-under-par 6K for
the day.
"I played well the first and third day,
but the second day my swing was a little off
and 1 think I put a lot of pressure on myself
since we were playing at home," explained
Burlison.
After opening with two solid rounds,
junior Angela King struggled to a six over
par (77) on Sunday. King, who entered the
day tied for ninth, fell to a tie for 2 1 ->th with
a three-round total of five over par (2IK).
The final golfer for Stanford was fresh
man Lila Barton who played her best golf
of the tournament on Sunday, shooting a
three over par (74). Barton finished tied
for 66th with a three round total of 14 over
par (227).
The Stanford women had some swag
ger as they walked down the fairways this
past weekend. They proved that they be
long in the conversation of the top
women's golf programs â€” and they are
confident that they will soon be competing
with the schools down south for the top
spot in the nation.
"We knew that the field would chal
lenge us and that many teams would be
separated by only a few strokes." O'Con
nor said. "But we felt very comfortable on
the greens and definitely had some confi
dence after last week's win."
