# Card gets third place at home
## Women's golf hosts tourney, beats three of nation's best 
### STEPHEN ADAMSON 
The No. 19 Stanford women's golf team
is on a roll. Coming off a key victory at the
Edean Ihlanfeldt Invitational last week,
the team shot a combined five-over-par
857 this past weekend at the Stanford In
tercollegiate to finish in third. Only No. 1
UCLA and No. 3 IJSC were better at the
event.
That's not to say the rest of the field was
poor, either. The Cardinal finished ahead
of three top-10 teams (No. 5 Oklahoma,
No. 6 Vanderbilt and No. 9 Duke) after a
weekend of highly competitive golf on the
Farm. Cardinal head coach Caroline O'-
Connor was pleased with her squad's ef
forts, viewing this weekend as a good sign
of improvement for the team.
"UCLA and USC certainly separated
themselves from the rest of the field," O'-
Connor said."but I think as we continue to
improve through the next few months,
we'll close that gap."
The two Los Angeles schools dominat
ed, as was expected going into the week
end. IJCLA shot a combined eight-under
par 844 while USC shot a five-under 847.
Lizettc Salas of I JSC finished first individ
ually with a score of seven under (206).
Sophomore Rebecca Durham led the
way individually for the Cardinal, finish
ing in a tie for ninth overall, shooting one
under par (212). O'Connor has been very
impressed with Durham's play this year.
"| Rebecca]'s really emerging as a solid
and consistent performer, as evidenced by

her finish this week," she said.
The Cardinal continues to get strong
contributions from its experienced mem
bers and its youngsters alike. Senior co
captain Mari Chun and talented freshman
Sydney Burlison each finished two over
par (215), tying for 14th overall. Burlison
shot the tournament's lowest Sunday
score, sinking six final-round birdies on
her way to score a three-under-par 6K for
the day.
"I played well the first and third day,
but the second day my swing was a little off
and 1 think I put a lot of pressure on myself
since we were playing at home," explained
Burlison.
After opening with two solid rounds,
junior Angela King struggled to a six over
par (77) on Sunday. King, who entered the
day tied for ninth, fell to a tie for 2 1 ->th with
a three-round total of five over par (2IK).
The final golfer for Stanford was fresh
man Lila Barton who played her best golf
of the tournament on Sunday, shooting a
three over par (74). Barton finished tied
for 66th with a three round total of 14 over
par (227).
The Stanford women had some swag
ger as they walked down the fairways this
past weekend. They proved that they be
long in the conversation of the top
women's golf programs — and they are
confident that they will soon be competing
with the schools down south for the top
spot in the nation.
"We knew that the field would chal
lenge us and that many teams would be
separated by only a few strokes." O'Con
nor said. "But we felt very comfortable on
the greens and definitely had some confi
dence after last week's win."


DAYU YANG/The Stanford Doily
The women's golf team upset three top-10 schools at the Stanford Intercollegiate last weekend. Sophomore
Rebecca Durham paced the Cardinal with a total score of 212 (one under par), finishing ninth overall.
Freshman Sydney Burlison
voiced similar sentiments. Stanford
has shown it has capable golfers; now
it just needs to execute on the course.
"It was really exciting playing
against the top competition, and the
fact that we finished so well confirms
that we can rival the top teams in the
country," Burlison said. "We started
off the fall s|ia,son slow, but I'm real
ly proud (Wiow we rallied back in
our last two events,"
Next up for the team is a trip to
Honolulu for the Kent Youel Invita
tional. hosted by the University of
Hawai'i. O'Connor wants the team
rested and ready when they begin
competition on Oct. 28.
"Our focus this week is going to
be on getting rested, staying healthy,
and catching up on schoolwork,"
O'Connor said.
The Cardinal will also try to sim
ulate some of the unique conditions
they will face on Oahu.
"In preparation for Hawaii, we'll
be spending a majority of our time
on campus putting on the Bermuda
green at the Siebel Complex," O'-
Connor added. "Otherwise we'll be
off campus a bit playing some cours
es that tend to get a lot of wind."
The Cardinal should move up in
the rankings after finishing ahead of
three top-10 teams this past week
end. The Stanford women will now
need to build on their newfound
confidence as they head into the last
tournament of the fall season.
