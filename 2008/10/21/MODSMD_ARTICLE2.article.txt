## Man beaten, robbed at Caltrain station Armed robbery part of a wave of crime in Palo Alto, Stanford 
### JENNY REMPEL 
Palo Alto experienced an increase in
crime over the past three months with two
robberies in the past week, including an
armed robbery on Oct. 13 near the
Caltrain station at the end of University
Ave.
Palo Alto Police Department (PAPD)
Agent Dan Ryan reported that there have
been 16 robberies since June 19.
"We're still on par," Ryan said of the
comparison between this year's and last
year's crime rates. "We're below our num
bers for 2007. but the numbers for the past
three months are higher."
The robbery on Oct. 13 took place at
11:40 a.m. when suspects described as two
black male adults struck a 58-year-old
man with a baseball bat.The two men fled
on foot after stealing the man's money.
One of the suspects was described as
wearing a blue shirt and beige pants, and
another was wearing a dark shirt and
pants. The victim was treated for a frac
tured shoulder at Stanford Hospital.
Another robbery occurred at 8:44 p.m.
last Thursday night, according to Ryan. A
woman walking home from work in Palo
Alto was approached by a man on a bicy
cle who attempted to speak with her then
returned to steal her clutch purse. Officers
found a man on University Ave. who
matched the victim's description, and
after a brief foot chase. PAPD Deputy
Chief Dennis Burns detained the suspect.
The man could not be definitively identi
fied by the victim, but was arrested for
failing to yield to an officer.
Stanford has also experienced an
increase in crime, with a string of thefts
throughout East Campus and Row resi
dences since the start of the school year.
As a result of rising crime, students are
increasingly nervous about their own
security.
"I was particularly surprised about the
Caltrain incident because 1 take the train
a lot and it was in the middle of the day."
said Zena Kharsa '09.
While she already takes precautions to
prevent theft on campus. Kharsa said the
increased crime numbers of late in Palo
Alto have been somewhat surprising.
"1 agree that my first perceptions of
the town are that it's really safe â€” at least
compared to Berkeley." she said. "But in
some ways, hearing that people are get-
ting beaten in the middle of the
day brings things into perspective.
We're not immune."
Louis Liu "12 shared Kharsa's
sentiments.
"It's very surprising," Liu said
of the recent attacks. "1 thought
Palo Alto was going to be a safe
community that Stanford belonged
to. and I thought we wouldn't have

to worry about any crime going
on."
Ryan reiterated that crime in
Palo Alto affects Stanford as well.
"We wrap around three quar
ters [of Stanford], so crime in Palo
Alto or Menlo Park is going to be
very similar." Ryan said. "The
thieves don't stop at the city limits
or the University border."
The PAPD is still investigating
both of the recent thefts. Ryan
added.
