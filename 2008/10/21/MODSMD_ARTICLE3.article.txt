# Hospital unveils new design
## New Medical Center adds 248 total beds 
### WILL DOOLEY 
Yesterday afternoon, in a joint confer
ence hosted by Stanford Hospital &
Clinics and Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital, officials unveiled plans for the
expansion of the two facilities.
Stanford University Medical Center's
Renewal Project includes a complete
reconstruction of Stanford Hospital on a
space adjacent to the current location, and
the addiiion of a 441,500-square-foot wing
to the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.
Construction is scheduled to begin in 2010.
The new buildings will enable the hos
pitals to overcome the most fundamental
challenges that plague modern medicine:
over-crowding, disorganization and out
dated facilities that cannot evolve to
accommodate the rapid pace of medical
advancement.
For example, both hospitals will have
private rooms for all patients as a method
of infection control, a modern necessity
that is lacking in many hospitals. State-of
the-art ventilation systems will also be
provided to combat disease.
Rooms in Stanford Hospital will be a
spacious 300 square feet, which will allow
minor surgeries and operations to take
place in the room itself — a response to
one of the major patient complaints of
being moved around too frequently. All in
all, Stanford Hospital alone will expand by
approximately 824,000 square feet, with
144 new beds for a grand total of 600 beds.
The Packard addition will include 104
new beds for a total of 361. Eight new
operating rooms will be added, bringing
the total to 15.
Christopher Dawes, president and
CEO of Packard, said unequivocally that
the expansion "is a privilege, but also a
necessity."
Packard has to turn away as many as
400 children a year. Dawes said, adding
that children and their families then have
to turn elsewhere for medical care.
The project has recently been ramped
up by a looming deadline. California State
Law requires that all hospitals meet strin
gent earthquake safety regulations by
2013 or risk loosing their licenses.
Unfortunately, the majority of Stanford
Hospital, which is almost 50 years old. can
not be retrofitted to meet the requirements
that will be phased into effect by 2030.
"This project is extraordinarily impor
tant for the whole community,especially in
these turbulent times," said Vice President
of Planning and Development Mark

"This project
is extraordinarily
important for
the whole
community''
