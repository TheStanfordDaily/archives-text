# Hospital unveils new design
## New Medical Center adds 248 total beds 
### WILL DOOLEY 
Yesterday afternoon, in a joint confer
ence hosted by Stanford Hospital &
Clinics and Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital, officials unveiled plans for the
expansion of the two facilities.
Stanford University Medical Center's
Renewal Project includes a complete
reconstruction of Stanford Hospital on a
space adjacent to the current location, and
the addiiion of a 441,500-square-foot wing
to the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.
Construction is scheduled to begin in 2010.
The new buildings will enable the hos
pitals to overcome the most fundamental
challenges that plague modern medicine:
over-crowding, disorganization and out
dated facilities that cannot evolve to
accommodate the rapid pace of medical
advancement.
For example, both hospitals will have
private rooms for all patients as a method
of infection control, a modern necessity
that is lacking in many hospitals. State-of
the-art ventilation systems will also be
provided to combat disease.
Rooms in Stanford Hospital will be a
spacious 300 square feet, which will allow
minor surgeries and operations to take
place in the room itself — a response to
one of the major patient complaints of
being moved around too frequently. All in
all, Stanford Hospital alone will expand by
approximately 824,000 square feet, with
144 new beds for a grand total of 600 beds.
The Packard addition will include 104
new beds for a total of 361. Eight new
operating rooms will be added, bringing
the total to 15.
Christopher Dawes, president and
CEO of Packard, said unequivocally that
the expansion "is a privilege, but also a
necessity."
Packard has to turn away as many as
400 children a year. Dawes said, adding
that children and their families then have
to turn elsewhere for medical care.
The project has recently been ramped
up by a looming deadline. California State
Law requires that all hospitals meet strin
gent earthquake safety regulations by
2013 or risk loosing their licenses.
Unfortunately, the majority of Stanford
Hospital, which is almost 50 years old. can
not be retrofitted to meet the requirements
that will be phased into effect by 2030.
"This project is extraordinarily impor
tant for the whole community,especially in
these turbulent times," said Vice President
of Planning and Development Mark

"This project
is extraordinarily
important for
the whole
community''

The design of the new addition to the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital was presented yesterday at an event hosted by Packard and
Stanford Hospital & Clinics. While Packard will recieve a new wing, Stanford Hospital is slated for a complete rehaul.

Rafael Vinoly, architect for the new Stanford Hospital & Clinics, presented his design for
the new facility yesterday. Vinoly found inspiration for his plan in Stanford's Main Quad.
Tortorich, who moderated the pres
entation.
The design, presented by Rafael
Vinoly Architects, centers around a
series of modular buildings —
essentially a series of squares
arranged around a central court
yard. The interiors of the buildings
can be reconfigured to serve a num
ber of uses.
The central courtyard will fea
ture a large waterfall that Vinoly
said was inspired by the integration
of nature and space in Stanford's
Main Quad, which he called one of
the "unsung pieces of American
architecture."
This design motif is featured
throughout the redesign, with four
more gardens interspersed between
the hospital buildings. One of the
gardens will be located at the
entrance to the new ER, which will
serve both facilities.
Building a new ER may very
well be the most pressing part of
this rebuild. The current emergency
room, built in the 19705, was
designed to hold 70 patients. Today,
it routinely serves between 125 and
150 people per day and. as a result,
has been forced in the past to close
its doors to arriving ambulances
because of over-crowding.
"Rafael Vinoly has brought cre
ativity and innovation to translating
our vision" said President and CEO
of Stanford Hospital & Clinics
Martha Marsh, "as well as future
flexibility to assure that these excit
ing facilities will keep pace with
rapid advances in medicine and
technology."
That creativity includes an-all
glass garden pavilion that will
encompass the entire third floor,
housing such necessities as dining,
retail and conference spaces.
Other notable features highlight

the hospital's commitment to sus
tainability. such as roof-top gardens
that collect rainwater, solar cells
and a shading system that is physi
cally detached from the building to
increase efficiency.
The addition to Packard
Children's Hospital also focuses on
blending nature into all aspects of
the design, expanding upon the orig
inal theme while drawing inspiration
from the neighboring arboretum.
"The innovation of KPF's [archi
tect firm Kohn Peterson Fox's]
design is clear." Dawes said. "It's an
environment that embraces safety,
comfort and privacy — all compo

nents in the extraordinary healing
journey we have built our reputa
tion around."
The two wings will be separated
by 90 feet of new garden space. TTie
western portion is oriented around
the existing gardens and pond,
which will serve as the unifying
joint of the old and new structures.
"Nature plays a very important
part." said architect William
Pedersen. "As waves emanate from
a stone tossed into a tranquil pool,
our design is influenced by nature
radiating from a healing garden."
Packard prides itself on its dedi
cation not just to children, but to

family. Each room has been con
ceived as a "nest" with space and
amenities, allowing families to stay
in the room with patients.
Solariums overlooking the south
ern gardens will be located at the end
of each of the two towers, solar panels
will line the roof to capture renew
able energy and sun-reflecting sur
faces will cover the north and south
walls to manage internal tempera
ture.
The new complex is set to open in
2015.

This design depicts the forthcoming Stanford Hospital, which will replace the current facility in order to meet more
stringent modern earthquake requirements. A waterfall will be added in the middle of the four hospital buildings.
Yesterday afternoon, in a joint confer
ence hosted by Stanford Hospital &
Clinics and Lucile Packard Children's
Hospital, officials unveiled plans for the
expansion of the two facilities.
Stanford University Medical Center's
Renewal Project includes a complete
reconstruction of Stanford Hospital on a
space adjacent to the current location, and
the addiiion of a 441,500-square-foot wing
to the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital.
Construction is scheduled to begin in 2010.
The new buildings will enable the hos
pitals to overcome the most fundamental
challenges that plague modern medicine:
over-crowding, disorganization and out
dated facilities that cannot evolve to
accommodate the rapid pace of medical
advancement.
For example, both hospitals will have
private rooms for all patients as a method
of infection control, a modern necessity
that is lacking in many hospitals. State-of
the-art ventilation systems will also be
provided to combat disease.
Rooms in Stanford Hospital will be a
spacious 300 square feet, which will allow
minor surgeries and operations to take
place in the room itself — a response to
one of the major patient complaints of
being moved around too frequently. All in
all, Stanford Hospital alone will expand by
approximately 824,000 square feet, with
144 new beds for a grand total of 600 beds.
The Packard addition will include 104
new beds for a total of 361. Eight new
operating rooms will be added, bringing
the total to 15.
Christopher Dawes, president and
CEO of Packard, said unequivocally that
the expansion "is a privilege, but also a
necessity."
Packard has to turn away as many as
400 children a year. Dawes said, adding
that children and their families then have
to turn elsewhere for medical care.
The project has recently been ramped
up by a looming deadline. California State
Law requires that all hospitals meet strin
gent earthquake safety regulations by
2013 or risk loosing their licenses.
Unfortunately, the majority of Stanford
Hospital, which is almost 50 years old. can
not be retrofitted to meet the requirements
that will be phased into effect by 2030.
"This project is extraordinarily impor
tant for the whole community,especially in
these turbulent times," said Vice President
of Planning and Development Mark

"This project
is extraordinarily
important for
the whole
community''

The design of the new addition to the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital was presented yesterday at an event hosted by Packard and
Stanford Hospital & Clinics. While Packard will recieve a new wing, Stanford Hospital is slated for a complete rehaul.


MICHAEL ROONEY/The Stanford Daily
Rafael Vinoly, architect for the new Stanford Hospital & Clinics, presented his design for
the new facility yesterday. Vinoly found inspiration for his plan in Stanford's Main Quad.
Tortorich, who moderated the pres
entation.
The design, presented by Rafael
Vinoly Architects, centers around a
series of modular buildings —
essentially a series of squares
arranged around a central court
yard. The interiors of the buildings
can be reconfigured to serve a num
ber of uses.
The central courtyard will fea
ture a large waterfall that Vinoly
said was inspired by the integration
of nature and space in Stanford's
Main Quad, which he called one of
the "unsung pieces of American
architecture."
This design motif is featured
throughout the redesign, with four
more gardens interspersed between
the hospital buildings. One of the
gardens will be located at the
entrance to the new ER, which will
serve both facilities.
Building a new ER may very
well be the most pressing part of
this rebuild. The current emergency
room, built in the 19705, was
designed to hold 70 patients. Today,
it routinely serves between 125 and
150 people per day and. as a result,
has been forced in the past to close
its doors to arriving ambulances
because of over-crowding.
"Rafael Vinoly has brought cre
ativity and innovation to translating
our vision" said President and CEO
of Stanford Hospital & Clinics
Martha Marsh, "as well as future
flexibility to assure that these excit
ing facilities will keep pace with
rapid advances in medicine and
technology."
That creativity includes an-all
glass garden pavilion that will
encompass the entire third floor,
housing such necessities as dining,
retail and conference spaces.
Other notable features highlight

the hospital's commitment to sus
tainability. such as roof-top gardens
that collect rainwater, solar cells
and a shading system that is physi
cally detached from the building to
increase efficiency.
The addition to Packard
Children's Hospital also focuses on
blending nature into all aspects of
the design, expanding upon the orig
inal theme while drawing inspiration
from the neighboring arboretum.
"The innovation of KPF's [archi
tect firm Kohn Peterson Fox's]
design is clear." Dawes said. "It's an
environment that embraces safety,
comfort and privacy — all compo

nents in the extraordinary healing
journey we have built our reputa
tion around."
The two wings will be separated
by 90 feet of new garden space. TTie
western portion is oriented around
the existing gardens and pond,
which will serve as the unifying
joint of the old and new structures.
"Nature plays a very important
part." said architect William
Pedersen. "As waves emanate from
a stone tossed into a tranquil pool,
our design is influenced by nature
radiating from a healing garden."
Packard prides itself on its dedi
cation not just to children, but to

family. Each room has been con
ceived as a "nest" with space and
amenities, allowing families to stay
in the room with patients.
Solariums overlooking the south
ern gardens will be located at the end
of each of the two towers, solar panels
will line the roof to capture renew
able energy and sun-reflecting sur
faces will cover the north and south
walls to manage internal tempera
ture.
The new complex is set to open in
2015.
