### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's soccer team claimed two more vic
tories on its first Pacific-10 Conference road swing of the sea
son. defeating Washington and Washington State in the
Pacific Northwest this weekend. Not only did the team beat
two dangerous opponents, hut it did so bv a combined score
of 8-1.
"I thought the team played exceptionally well this week
end." Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe said. "It's always
hard playing away from home, especially against two very
good Pac-10 teams, but we showed great mental toughness
and goal scoring ability."
ITie No. 5 Cardinal began the weekend in Seattle with a
match against Washington on Friday. The first 10 minutes of
the contest were mostly uneventful, but Stanford soon sent
out a warning as junior forward Kelley O'Hara saw her shot
bounce off the post. Seven minutes later, the Card opened
the scoring on the foot of freshman midfielder Cami Levin.
Levin — who already had a couple long-range goals on the
season — put a shot in the upper-right corner of the net from
30 yards out to put her team in front.

GAME NOTES: The Stanford women's soccer team con
tinued to dominate the competition, downing the
Huskies on Fridoy and the Cougars on Sunday. The
Cardinal outscored its Washington opponents 8-1 and
extended its winning streak to nine games. Freshman
Lindsay Taylor and |uniors Kelly O'Hara and Christen
Press all scored multiple goals. The Cardinal women
play their final home games this weekend when they
take on the Arizona schools at Laird Q Cagan
Stadium. Stanford will honor its seniors before their
last regular-season home game on Sunday.


Junior Christen Press combined with classmate Kelly O'Hara to score six of Stanford's eight goals in Washington. The Card
has yet to lose this season, but faces a tough final stretch: after this weekend, the remainder of its games are on the road.
Stanford would double its advan
tage just three minutes later. Sopho
more forward Christen Press sent
classmate O'Hara clear on goal with a
great through ball.and O'Hara buried
it low past the keeper to make it 2-0.
It would be 3-0 before the half
hour mark. In the 28th minute, the
two forwards switched roles as Press
finished a great feed from O'Hara.
who notched an assist on the play
along with freshman Lindsay Taylor.
The rout was on.
The Cardinal added yet another
goal just after halftime. Once again.
Press converted from close range
after O'Hara had split the defense
with a through ball in the 48th
minute.The goal, the 10th of the sea
son from Press, tied her for the team
lead with Taylor and put her two
ahead of her total for the entire 2007
season.
The Huskies were able to restore
some pride and end Stanford's streak
of five straight matches without con
ceding a goal. In the 62nd minute,
they cut the lead to 4-1 when substi
tute McKenna Waitley chipped a

shot over Stanford keeper Kira
Maker from inside the box.
Not to be outdone, Stanford
would answer back and grab the
game's final goal. O'Hara capped a
great match with her second strike of
the game, bringing the final score to
5-1. Once again she was the recipient
of a lovely through-ball that split the
defense, this time courtesy of sopho
more Morgan Redman.
The team then traveled to Pull
man on Sunday to take on Washing
ton State — a team riding the mo
mentum of a 2-1 upset of No. 18 Cal
on Friday night. Just like the Wash
ington game, both the Cardinal and
the Cougars started slowly. Neither
team registered a shot until the 26th
minute of the match. Then the shots
began to come fast and furious as
Taylor saw a shot saved and O'Hara
and senior defender Marisa Abegg
both went wide of the target, all in the
span of two minutes.
Both teams had chances in the
next five minutes, but it was Stanford
who struck first. In the 36th minute,
freshman midfielder Teresa Noyola
found herself in space on the right
side of the field and sent the ball into
the box. Her cross found the head of
Taylor, who headed the ball into the
left side of the goal and regained the
team scoring lead in the process.

It was deja vu in the 51st minute.
Again, Noyola sent the ball in from
the right — this time directly from a
corner kick — and Taylor drove an
other header past Cougar keeper
Lindsay Parlee to make it 2-0.
O'Hara delivered the final blow
just five minutes later. Parlee came
far out of the net to collect a loose
ball, but the Stanford junior beat her
to it and tipped the ball away. O'Hara
then deposited it into the empty net
from just outside the box, sealing the
deal on yet another 3-0 Stanford win.
Ratcliffe was not only proud of
the team's statistics for the matches,
but the way it responded to slow
starts and tough defense in both
games.
"Both teams initially tried to sit
back against us. but after we scored,
they changed and tried to attack a lit
tle bit." he said. "[The defensive style
of play] can be hard to deal with
sometimes, but we dealt with it well."
The two victories kept the Cardi
nal undefeated on the year with a
record of 14-0-1 (4-0-0 in the Pac-10).
The team will have its last home stand
of the regular season this weekend as
it hosts Arizona and Arizona State on
Friday and Sunday, respectively.
