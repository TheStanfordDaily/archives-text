## Breaking out of the bubble Students take a year off to pursue other passions 
### E. BLAIR LAING STAFF WRITER 
Imagine leaving the sunny enclave of
Stanford to take a year off. Where
would you go and what would you do?
How do you think your parents would
react to the news? Your friends?
The idea of taking time off from college,
or even of taking a gap year between high
school and college, is one that many students
consider but few actually pursue. Those that
do. however, tend to be strongly in favor of
the idea and encourage other students to
take time off as well.
The Volunteer: Annalise Blum '10
Annalise Blum TO took a gap year before
her freshman year to do community service
in Thailand and Guatemala.
"I was in Thailand when the tsunami hit
and I wanted to stay to do relief work, but I
decided to finish high school first," Blum
said.
After graduation, she took a month-long
course in San Francisco and was certified to
teach English to foreign-language speakers.
She then headed to the small town of
Kuraburi, Thailand for two months to teach
local women.
"I learned a lot about international devel
opment and how important it is to have com
munity-based support," Blum said."l saw the
effects of poorly invested aid money."
She continued on to Guatemala, where
she taught English at a girls' school.
"I spent the whole year trying to volun
teer, and I maybe taught some people some
English." Blum said. "It's a lot harder to
make a difference than I thought."
These experiences gave Blum a different
perspective about international service and
her goals for Stanford.
"I'm definitely glad I took a gap year be
cause it has made my time at Stanford more
rewarding," Blum said. "It helped me have
more focus here because I had a chance to
see the world before I had to figure out my
major."
In particular, it taught her an important
life lesson: "I needed to gain concrete skills
and learn more to do what I wanted."
Blum is now an environmental engineer
ing major because she feels that the skills she
learns as an engineer can be solidly applied
to helping people.
She also strongly encourages other stu
dents to consider taking a gap year or a year
off; she has even created a Web site with re
sources for students interested in taking time
off to do international service —
http://www.freewebs.com/gapyearsite/.
"I made the site because I wanted to help
other people take a year off," Blum said. "It
would have been so hard without support

from my family."
The Chef: Michael Albada '11
Some students who take time off. howev
er. aren't so lucky, and are forced to do so
without aid from their parents. Michael Al
bada. originally class of 2010. now 2011. took
a year off after his freshman year to work as
a sous-chef in Ashland. Ore. without his par
ents' help.
Albada's freshman year didn't go exactly
as he had anticipated.
"I wanted to live in an all frosh. all-male
dorm but got stuck in a four-class, co-ed
dorm, so it was basically the opposite of what
I wanted," Albada said. "But the biggest
problem I had was the academics. I was
burned out from senior year."
Albada experimented with lectures, semi
nars and IntroSems in multiple departments,
and was unable to find a professor he con
nected with or a class that really clicked.
"I didn't know why I wanted to be here
anymore." Albada said.
It had originally been one of his dreams to
pursue a career as a chef, and he had even
contemplated culinary school.
So. after his disappointing freshman year.
Albada moved into a house with some
friends and got a job as a sous-chef.
His parents were not pleased.
"They were really pissed off because they
were afraid I wouldn't go back." Albada said.
"I didn't talk to them for a good few months."
Without their support, Albada was living
on his own. making paychecks, paying rent
and even buying a car.
"It was probably the best decision I have
ever made," Albada said. "I wouldn't have
done it any other way. It gave me a much larg
er perspective."
Now that he's back, there have been some
rough patches, but he says it was worth it.
"Coming back has been crazy," Albada
said."lt was a hard transition for the first cou
ple weeks.The difference in pace of life is in
tense. It's a lot better now, though. I don't
know what has changed, but I feel like I'm a
lot more receptive to opportunities. And I
have a lot more to bring to the table."
He has also discovered that while he has
remained close to his best friends from fresh
man year, he is mostly making new friends
from the class of 2011.
"I feel like a freshman in many ways." Al
bada said. "It's like starting over."
The Olympian: Elle Logan '11
Elle Logan.originally 2010, now 2011. has
been able to get back into the swing of her
old life pretty easily.
Logan, who took last year off to train with
the U.S. National Rowing Team in Princeton,
N.J.. ultimately made the team and went on
to win an Olympic gold medal in women's

rowing.
"My life this past year was literally row
ing. eating and sleeping," Logan said. "For
the first time in my life. I wasn't the best.
There were times when I was exhausted and
I almost came home. There were definitely
times when I was wondering why I took a
year off."
"But the Olympic experience was amaz
ing," Logan said. "And winning a gold medal
— I don't think it's hit me yet."
After her year away, however, she was
ready to come back to school and her friends.
"I was really excited to get back to
school." Logan said.'i missed going to class
es and learning. I have a great group of
friends who I'm just happy to be back with."
And now that she has returned, it's back
to the grind for the Stanford women's crew
team.
"It's hard because national team rowing is
very different from college team rowing."
Logan said. "It's not an easy transition: it'll
take some time. But we have a really great,
really talented team."
Still, Logan is ultimately very happy with
her decision.
"It was a good time to step back, take a
look at everything and focus." Logan said. "It
made me realize that academics are important
to me. For now. I've decided I just want to take
classes that I like and figure out my career
later. I'm in full support of taking time off."

The Campaigner: Daniel Shih '10
It was a different quadrennial event that
lured Daniel Shih. originally '09. away from
Stanford for four quarters.
"I made the decision to leave school to
work on the Obama campaign because I be
lieved that our country was in a crisis" Shih
said in an email to The Daily. "Inspired by
Barack Obama's message of creating a grass
roots movement for change, I felt compelled
to leave Stanford to do mv part."
For the last year and a half, Shih has been
working to promote the Ohama campaign all
across the country. Before the primaries, he
worked as a field organizer in Nevada. Utah.
Texas. Mississippi and North Carolina. He is
currently a regional field director in New
Mexico.
"I manage a team of 13 field organizers."
Shih said. "As part of the field operation, our
job is to identify and persuade voters through
intensive voter contact efforts, and then to
turn out the vote on Election Day."
Shih has been fortunate to have the sup
port of his family.
"My parents were initially perplexed, but
now they're very supportive." Shih said. "My
dad even came down to Texas to volunteer!"
And while Shih feels like his campaign
work has definitely taught him a lot about life
outside of school, it has also helped him to
appreciate his Stanford experience.

"Working on a presidential campaign
forces you to be a 'jack of all trades' and,
above all. a problem solver," Shih said. "I
feel much more capable of handling just
about anything after a year and a hall of the
insanity that is campaign life. [But] I've also
come to realize what a luxury it is to spend
your whole day surrounded by brilliant stu
dents and world-class professors, trying to
understand big ideas and learning new
things."
Getting out
From politics and international aid to
sports and culinary studies.Stanford students
are doing it all.
As it isn't always easy to find information
or the resources, some universities, such as
Princeton, have even started developing pro
grams that encourage students to take a gap
year before beginning their undergraduate
careers.
Once they find these options, some
choose to take time off because they hear the
cal! of once-in-a-lifetime experiences — oth
ers, just an opportunity to learn a little bit
more about life outside the classroom.
Either way, as Logan so succinctly put it.
"Stanford students do so many cool things."
