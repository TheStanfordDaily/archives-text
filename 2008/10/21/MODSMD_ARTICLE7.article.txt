# Faux proposals seek STAMP of approval
## 
### JESS WERTHEIM 
At 3:30 p.m. last Monday afternoon. Michelle
Mederos'l 1 received a marriage proposal. And
she wasn't the only one. As covered by I"he
Daily on Friday, last Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday saw 20 marriage proposals put on
by Stanford Theatre Activist Mobilization Project (STAMP)
all over campus—in 12 different classes and four dining
halls, as well as Moonbeans, Tresidder, the CoHo and the
Treehouse.
"STA MP's mission is to create theatre to educate and mo
bilize people for progressive social change," wrote Amanda
Gelender'o9, founder and director of STAMP, in an email to
The Daily."Theatre can dynamically evoke the positive emo
tions that are at the core of marriage equality. Since Prop. 8 is
attempting to ban loving couples from receiving equal rights,
what better way to educate voters than to include them in the
joy and love that these couples share every day?"
If passed, California Proposition 8 would ban same-sex
marriage within the state; with the deadline for California
voter registration having passed yesterday and National
Coming Out Day this week, reactions to S TAMP'S protest
are still percolating.
"The reaction in the classroom was both positive and wel
coming," Mederos, a STAMP actress, said after she received
her proposal. "There was clapping and smiling as [STAMP
actress Kate Hyder II and l| exited the classroom, and I
would generally consider the proposal to be a success."
Mederos then addressed the issue of student backlash.
"While I have not personally been the recipient of direct

criticism, I have heard that many students have been offend
ed — that a sizable number feel either manipulated by the
performances or that valuable class time has been wasted,"
she said.
She was right.
"I thought it made a mockery of the entire institution of
marriage," declared a male junior, who wished to remain
anonymous for fear of backlash about his views. "I thought
our class time and the teaching time of the professor was
wasted and the entire production unnecessary."
"I don't think it's going to make a difference — it's just a
bunch of kids acting," an anonymous male sophomore said.
"I think it just degrades the whole thing."
In response to these students who felt duped and used,
STAMP Guerrilla Theater Director Vera Eidelman '09 tried
to clarify the goal of the performances.
"Our proposals are creating moments of joy that repre
sent the beauty of marriage, an institution that we are fierce
ly fighting for," she wrote in an email to the Daily. "We are
showing the Stanford campus what society has to lose if it
bans same-sex marriage."
Of the 205 professors contacted, only 17 agreed to let the
STAMPactors perform in their classrooms. While the major
ity of professors simply did not respond, those who did were
fervently opinionated. Those who were receptive to a per
formance were excited, but said little more than "Yes!"
TTie professors who denied the .STAMP actors from pro
posing in their classes offered a careful explanation as to why
not. According to STAMP, these included: "Against politiciz
ing our classrooms," "There's not enough time,""Political ac
tivism is great, but not during class time,""Against using class
time (a captive audience of students) for political advocacy"
and"I have a longstanding and very firm policy against using

class time for anything
except lecture and dis
cussion."

Nonetheless, many students
were not bothered by their class
time being interrupted and instead
viewed the proposals as a positive
step being taken by the Stanford
community.
"[The mock proposals] seem like
a really great way to make the issue
very tangible and up-close to a popu
lation that might not be thinking
about (gay marriage] in those sort of
real life terms," Steven Crane' 11 said.

Blake Miller 'I I agreed, describing the proposal at the
end of his China and World Politics Class as "extraordinary."
"A girl came up to the front of the classroom with a rose
and very convincingly expressed her love for someone in the
audience," he said. "It was compelling. I thought it was real
until our professor shared with us that it was a performance
put on by STAMP. She shared with us that Prop. K threatens
to break up her marriage. I thought that was just unbeliev
able. No one should have to have his or her marriage threat
ened like that."
Positive response or not, STAMP seems to have accom
plished its goal of sparking a discussion about Prop. 8 among
the student body.
"We always wanted to foster dialogue and intense re
sponses," Eidelman said."Wedepend on people with adverse
responses to be open-minded enough to engage with us."
