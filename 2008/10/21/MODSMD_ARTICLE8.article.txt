## Obama takes break to visit grandmother

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) —
Democratic presidential candidate
Barack Obama is canceling nearly
all his campaign events Thursday
and Friday to visit his suddenly
gravely ill 85-year-old grandmother
in I lawaii. a spokesman said.
Robert Gibbs told reporters
aboard Obama's plane that Madelyn
Payne Dunham, who helped raise
Obama, was released from the hos
pital late last week. But he said her
health had deteriorated "to the point
where her situation is very serious."
Events originally planned for
Madison. Wis., and Des Moines,
lowa, on 'ITiursday will be replaced
by one in Indianapolis before he
makes the long flight to Hawaii. On
Friday, Obama's wife, Michelle, will
sub for Obama at rallies in Akron
and Columbus, in Ohio, said cam
paign spokeswoman Jen Psaki.
Obama was expected to resume
campaigning on Saturday, at an
undecided location in the West, she
said.
"Sen. Obama's grandmother,
Madelyn Dunham, has always been
one of the most important people in
his life, along with his mother and his
grandfather." Ciibbs said. "Recently
his grandmother has become ill and
in the last few weeks her health has
deteriorated to the point where her
situation is very serious. It is for that
reason that Sen. Obama has decided
to change his schedule on Thursday
and Friday so that he can see her and
spend some time with her."

Citing the family's desire for pri
vacy. Gibbs would not discuss the
nature of Dunham's illness. It
seemed likely that she was close to
death, as Gibbs said that "everyone
understands the decision that Sen.
Obama is making." Dunham turns
86 on Sunday.
It could be a momentous one in
his bid for the White House against
Republican John McCain, with
Election Day just two weeks away
on Nov. 4.
In a campaign ad this year,
Obama described his Dunham as the
daughter of a Midwest oil company
clerk who "taught me values straight
from the Kansas heartland" —
things like "accountability and self
reliance. Love of country. Working
hard without making excuses.
Treating your neighbor as you'd like
to be treated."
She's also the "white grandmoth
er" he referred to in a speech on
race.
Obama recognized Dunham
when he accepted the Democratic
presidential nomination at the
party's convention in Denver.
"She's the one who taught me
about hard work. She's the one who
put off buying a new car or a new
dress for herself so that I could
have a better life. She poured
everything she had into me. And
although she can no longer travel. I
know that she's watching tonight,
and that tonight is her night as well."
he said.
Obama last visited Hawaii in
August for a week's vacation after he
had elinched the nomination.
