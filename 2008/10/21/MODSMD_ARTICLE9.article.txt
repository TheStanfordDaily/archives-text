### DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Chemistry Prof. W.E. Moerner
recently recieved the 2009 Irving
Langmuir Prize in chemical physics
from the American Physical Society.
Moerner was heralded for his
contributions to interdisciplinary
research in chemistry and physics,
including the application of single

molecule spectroscopy. Hie profes
sor was also recently awarded the
Wolf Prize in Chemistry.
The biennial Langmuir award is
named after Irving Langmuir, who
was the recipient of the 1932
Nobel Prize in chemistry. The
prestigious prize awards the recip
ient $10,000.
The Langmuir Prize was estab
lished in 1964 by General Electric
and is now part of the GE fund and
GE R&D. Recipients are chosen by
