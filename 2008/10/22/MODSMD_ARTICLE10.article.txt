Apple's profit up 26 percent on iPhone
boom
Apple Inc. said its profit jumped 26 percent in its
fiscal fourth quarter as the newest iPhone outsold the
market-leading Blackßerry from Research in Mo
tion Ltd.
Despite the blockbuster performance, which sent
Apple's shares soaring in after-hours trading, the
company issued what it called "'prudent" predictions
for the current quarter, because of broader economic
uncertainty.
Cupertino,Calif.-based Apple's profit topped Wall
Street's expectations, but sales missed. Analysts had
expected the company to sell $8 billion worth of Mac
intosh computers, iPods, iPhones and other gadgets,
for a profit of $ 1.11 per share, according to a Thomson
Reuters poll.
On a conference call with analysts. Chief Execu
tive Steve Jobs addressed concerns that economic
weakness will eat into Apple's business through the
holidays and beyond.
"We may get buffeted around by the waves a little
bit. but we'll be fine," Jobs said.
Senate Democrats subpoena Mukasey
over detainees
Senate Democrats on Tuesday subpoenaed Attor
ney General Michael Mukasey for testimony and
documents about the Justice Department's legal ad
vice to the White House on detention and interroga
tion policies since the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., complained to Mukasey that after five
years of efforts to glean the information, the commit
tee still has seen only a fraction of the documents it is
seeking.
"There is no legitimate argument for withholding
the requested materials from this committee." Leahy
wrote in a letter to Mukasey that accompanied the
subpoena.
The Justice Department blasted the subpoena as a
partisan move.
"We have worked in good faith over the past sev
eral months to see that the Judiciary Committee's le
gitimate oversight requests were being met in a man
ner consistent with the Justice Department's equally
legitimate and long-standing need to provide confi
dential legal advice within the executive branch." de
partment spokesman Brian Roehrkasse said. "We
will now assess our next steps."
San Francisco weighs decriminalizing
prostitution
In thislive-and-let-live town, where medical mar
ijuana clubs do business next to grocery stores and
an annual fair celebrates sadomasochism, prosti
tutes could soon walk the streets without fear of ar
rest.
San Francisco would become the first major U.S.
city to decriminalize prostitution if voters next
month approve Proposition k — a measure that
forbids local authorities from investigating, arrest
ing or prosecuting anyone for selling sex.
The ballot question technically would not legal
ize prostitution since state law still prohibits it. but
the measure would eliminate the power of local law
enforcement officials to go after prostitutes.
Even in tolerant San Francisco — where the
sadomasochism fair draws thousands of tourists and
a pornographic video company is housed in a former
armory — the measure faces an uphill battle, with
much of the political establishment opposing it.
Bush: aid to poor nations especially
needed now
Amid global economic turmoil, President Bush
said Tuesday that it's more important than ever for
the United States and other prosperous nations to
help the less fortunate.
"During times of economic crisis, some may be
tempted to turn inward — focusing on our prob
lems here at home while ignoring our interests
around the world.This would be a serious mistake,"
Bush said at a summit on international develop
ment. "America is committed and must stay com
mitted to international development for reasons
that remain true regardless of the ebb and flow of
the markets."
Bush said that during the past eight years, the
United States has provided more foreign assistance
than at any time in the past half century.
