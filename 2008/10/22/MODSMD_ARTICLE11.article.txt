# GOVERNMENT RAISES MORE DOUBTS ABOUT U.S. SECURITY AGREEMENT
## Iraqi Cabinet says U.S. pact needs change 
### ROBERT H. REID THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Iraq's Cabinet decided Tuesday to ask the
U.S. for changes to the draft agreement that
would keep American troops here three
more years, as key Shiite lawmakers warned
the deal stands little chance of approval as it
stands.
The decision, reached in a closed-door
meeting that lasted nearly six hours, raised
doubt that the agreement can be ratified be
fore a new American president is elected
next month.
Parliament must approve the draft before

the current U.N. mandate expires on Dec. 31
or no legal basis will exist for the U.S.-led
military mission.
Such an outcome would force hard deci
sions in Baghdad and Washington on the fu
ture of the unpopular war.
Critics maintain the draft falls short of
Iraqi demands for full control of their own
country after nearly six years of U.S. occupa
tion. Supporters insist Iraq still needs U.S.
military and political support as it builds its
security forces and governmental institu
tions.
Opposition, however, is divided, with dif
ferent parties objecting to different parts of

the agreement, which could make it difficult
to win broad support for the entire docu
ment before the year end deadline.
Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and his
ministers reviewed details of the draft, ham
mered out in months of tortuous negotia
tions, and concluded that changes were
needed "to raise the agreement to a nation
ally acceptable level," government
spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said in a state
ment.
Cabinet members will prepare a list of
proposed changes to present to the Ameri
cans, al-Dabbagh said without giving a time
frame.
