## Senate discusses advocacy Senators approve anti-Proposition 8 resolution 
### MARISA LANDICHO 
With the new freshman senate
associates in attendance, the ASSU
Undergraduate Senate was on its
best behavior at last night's meeting.
Senators briskly moved through the
agenda and did not get bogged down
by any issues.
Advocacy, which was brought up
at last week's meeting in reference to
an anti-Proposition 8 resolution, was
the recurring theme throughout the
agenda. Although all senators
expressed their personal convictions
against Prop. 8. the California initia
tive to ban gay marriage, last week's
Senate meeting stalled over whether
an anti-Prop. 8 resolution would
open the Senate up to further lobby
ing efforts.
At this week's meeting, the Senate
approved the anti-Prop. 8 resolution
and considered another resolution
on a report released by the
Committee on Libraries.
The report, focused on the future
of Stanford libraries, was prompted
by last year's proposition to demolish
Meyer Library and detailed a divide
between the School of Humanities
and Sciences and other schools.
"The gist of it is that the President

[John Hennessy] and the Provost
[John Etchemendy] want to chuck
out all print books, at least in Latin
characters, more or less overnight,"
said Senator Luukas lives '09. "The
faculty in the humanities and social
sciences are much more conservative
as to the pace we ought to move for
ward."
lives pushed for establishing a
Senate position on the issue, with
the rationale that the majority of
undergraduate students agree with
the School of Humanities and
Sciences.
The discussion quickly turned
from the specific library issue to the
broader question of advocacy.
"To what extent, or at all. are we
comfortable with individual senators
turning up lobbying projects that
many of us may actually oppose, or at
the very least feel uncomfortable
with?" asked Senator Stuart Baimel
"09.
Baimel. referencing both the
library and the anti-Prop. 8 issues,
was especially wary that one resolu
tion would then require the Senate to
pass a resolution on each subsequent
issue.
Other members argued that some
issues were too important not to be
addressed.
"I think it's really important for us
to not be afraid or to be too shy to
bring up these controversial topics
just because there might be opposi

tion in a 15-member legislative
body," said Deputy Chair Shelley
Gao '11. "Fundamentally, we were
elected to represent the different
views of our constituents. While it's
very time consuming, this is what this
deliberative body is about."
The Senate never clarified what a
general resolution would require of
its members, particularly those who
may personally oppose future meas
ures. It also remains unclear what
effect Senate advocacy resolutions
have on the Stanford community.The
library resolution will be up for a
vote at the next meeting.
After coming to some consensus
on Senate activism, the Senate quick
ly moved to resolve the issue that
bogged down its last meeting: sup
port for gay marriage rights.
Following an impassioned speech
by Amanda Gelender '09. who spoke
on discrimination and Prop. 8,13 sen
ators voted for the resolution, with
Senator J'vona Ivory '11 abstaining.
Ivory said her abstention was not
due to personal views.
"I just felt that 1 should not tell
people how to vote," Ivory said. "I
didn't feel that it was my place."
Overall, the meeting ran smoothly
and the new associates were
impressed by the Senate.
"I thought [the meeting] was real
ly exciting, and I can't wait to get
involved," said Senate Associate
Dylan Plofker '12.
