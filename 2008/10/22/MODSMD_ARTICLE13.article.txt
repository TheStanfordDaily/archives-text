## Editorial Take a moment to remember, as well as take care 
### 
On Oct. l()th, Stanford suffered a
tremendous loss. Three students from
the Graduate School of Business —
Viet Nguyen. Chris Sahm and Micah
Springer — tragically lost their lives when
their car plummeted off Highway 1. down an
embankment.
First and foremost, the editorial board
commiserates with the GSB and the students'
families and friends. We understand the im
mensity of this tragedy, especially in such a
small community. To know individuals who
died so young — all three students were in
their mid- to late-twenties — snatches us all
immediately out of the perceived warmth
and safety of the Stanford bubble.
Life is precious, and in our hectic lives, we
all too often forget this. Stanford students are
known for their jam-packed schedules, aca
demically, extracurricularly and socially, and
for being driven individuals at the top of their
game. Yet despite this immersion in a life of
progress and accomplishment, we must re
member what's truly important — that we're
all here for too few years to begin with, and
that sometimes we must remember to take
the time and deep breaths necessary to truly
appreciate our experiences.
Though the deaths of the three young
business school students had a tremendous
impact on the GSB, which has only 350 stu
dents per class, the event seemed to barely
ripple among the lives of undergrads this
month. Our community has not grown so
large that individual schools are completely
isolated from each other.The editorial board
wishes that the undergraduate community
had taken at least a moment out of its day to
commemorate the loss of promising students.
We implore undergraduates to look up
from their homework, pause in their partying
and pay their respects to members of our
Stanford community. More importantly, we
would like to take this opportunity to encour
age everyone to pause and reflect.
So as you go about your day, think about
the people whom you hold dear. Tell your
friends you value their companionship and
advice, tell your parents you love them, tell

that person down the hall that you've always
admired their taste in music.
Whatever it may be. don't lose the oppor
tunity to let people know that they're mean
ingful, before it's too late.

Life is precious, and
in our hectic lives,
we all too often
forget this.

And at the same time, take care of yourself
— whether mentally, emotionally or physi
cally. For example, each and every one of us
has likely seen a disastrous hike accident at
the Intersection of Death on the way to 11
a.m. lecture. Keep your head up and your
hands on the handlebars — unnecessary ac
cidents are just that: unnecessary.
Even more relevant, he careful when driv
ing. Even if the driver of a car you are in has
n't been drinking, accidents do occur. Stay
alert, drive at or below the speed limit, come
to complete stops at stop signs and be respect
ful of other people on the road.
More than anything else, the editorial
board simply cannot emphasize enough the
fleeting nature and priceless quality of
human life. As we all prepare to move on
from this community's loss, keep a place in
your heart for those who are no longer here
— and keep a place in your mind to remem
ber what matters in life, as well as how you
can help prevent a similar tragedy from hap
pening again.
