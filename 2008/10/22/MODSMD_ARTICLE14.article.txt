# The 						Ad Analyst
## Be aware: Ads are all around you 
### 
Isn't it time you started paying attention
to advertisements? For ail their many
appearances in mass media, there is a
tendency to minimize the importance of ad
vertisements in our lives. Even the word it
self. "advertisement," is usually shortened
to an innocuous two-letter abbreviation, al
most like an afterthought — ad. But even
though you think you aren't paying atten
tion to the ads when you casually flip
through a magazine or lose focus during
commercials on TV. you're still not doing
much to minimize the effect of ads on your
attitudes. Ads are designed to be processed
without much effort — they are actually
more effective the less you try to think
about them.
So why not spend some time thinking
about them? After all, if it weren't for the
carefully crafted ennui of Prada models,
how would you ever get the idea that being
rich enough to buy Prada makes it okay to
be disinterested in life? (Not that many of
us would know what that feels like anyway.)
And although fashion ads may seem like
harmless window dressing, the useless fluff
of magazines, consider the potency of the
idea behind those models' flat stares. In
America, we equate being successful with
being rich. The rich are the ones with the
means to do the most for society. But imag
ine if the logic of Prada prevailed among us
— what happens to social responsibility
when monetary success means you just
don't have to care anymore?
Now that I'm hopefully on my way to
convincing you that ads are indeed impor
tant. let me step off my soapbox for a mo
ment and tell you why I felt the need to
write this column about advertisements in
particular. I come from a city that rivals
even L.A. with its reputation for superficial
ity. Will Smith wrote a song about it in 1998
that regrettably still plays in European
clubs today — yes. I'm talking about Miami.
This is the city that was used as the set
ting for the first four seasons of the FX se
ries Nip/Tuck, a show that follows the errat
ic lives of two plastic surgeons. The city was
perfect for the show because, for the Miami
elite, plastic surgery has become just as
commonplace as getting a facial. Hie show
is now set in L.A. Go figure.
As for me, I live 15 minutes from South
Beach (famous for its semi-nude sunbathers
with surgically perfected bodies), Star Is
land (where the likes of Madonna and
Diddy have their mansions) and Fisher Is
land (recently deemed the most expensive

zip code in the country). And I don't live in
an especially unique location in the city —
from most areas of Miami, a peek into the
lifestyles of the rich and famous is always
just a short car ride away. It's no secret to
anyone who lives there that Miami's elite
spends a large chunk of their money on
looking the part. Whether or not you are
rich, you can't deny that consumerism plays
an integral part in the city's culture.
Because of the atmosphere created bv
this culture, I grew up immersed in the no
tion that the way you look determines
where you can go, whom you can know and
who you can be. If you want to experience it
for yourself, just go out to South Beach on a
Saturday night. I guarantee you'll see 16-
year-old girls dressed to impress walking
into clubs before actual 21-year-olds,
dressed a little shabbier, ever see the front
door.
That's just part of the reason why under
standing ads, the vehicles that deliver con
sumer logic to us, is important to me. I. for
one, did not like being subjected to rules 1
didn't understand. I wanted to take steps to
wards knowing why things are the way they
are in my hometown and. in some aspects, in
America as a whole.
But even if you don't have the privilege
of coming from the bowels of superficiality,
it's still worthwhile to devote some time to
advertisements — and. in order to do so, to
devote some time to reading this column.
It's hard to escape consumer culture in the
United States, so why not be informed
about it? Hie world is confusing enough —
would you rather walk through it with a
blindfold or a flashlight?
So,you choose to be informed. And then,
maybe one day, you will be walking down
the street and encounter a well-dressed
woman gazing into the distance with disin
terest. If it reminds you just a little bit of de
signers' ads, you won't be surprised ... be
cause you will know all too well that ads can
