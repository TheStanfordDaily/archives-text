## Notes from a consumerist 
### 
It all began when I bought the blender. I
don't remember what exactly motivated
me to do so, but I'm pretty sure it had
something to do with a desire to make pre
meds wonder what happened to their orgo
homework. That may have been what made
me buy the flamethrower, though — I can't
say for sure.
In any case. I bought a blender. It's a nice
blender. I think: elegant, sturdy and vicious.
It's the No. 1 result for "blender" on
Amazon.com, for whatever that's worth.
Amazon,as it turns out,is my favorite place
to buy things. It's got everything imaginable,
after all: blenders, v-neck tees,office chairs, vi
brators, replica 17th-century triple-barrel
flintlock pistols — you name it. And whatever
it is that you end up purchasing, it arrives at
your doorstep in two to three days.
But all that is unimportant in comparison
to one simple — but profound — intergener
ational observation regarding Amazon, one
that truly makes the service of the utmost
value to every single college student:
Your parents think it only sells books.
This means, quite delightfully, that after

telling them textbooks are cheaper online
than in the bookstore, you can go ahead and
order an $1K,()(X) grand piano with their credit
card.
"Sorry, mum. Orgo books are outrageous
these days. You do want me to be a doctor,
right?"
Voila. Blender purchased.
And so it was.
Freshly armed with a brand-new blender. I
found myself faced with the question of what
exactly I should blend.Those of you who have
seen BlendtecVWill It Blend?" viral market
ing campaign know that just about anything
can be blended, from golf balls to light bulbs to
credit cards to iPhones. The possibilities are
endless.

Endless possibility can make decisions
tough, though, so it's lucky that I happen to he
a narrow-minded reactionary who prefers
blending fruit. While this may seem boring to
you. it's tastier than blended Barbie.
So,decision made. I setoff in search of fruit.
Initially, my friend convinced me that the
tastiest and most socially conscious thing to do
would be to purchase fresh fruit from the Hast
Palo Alto Farmers' Market. I wholeheartedly
agreed with him and attempted to do so, but I
have yet to succeed in getting up before 5 p.m.
on any Saturday this year. I think the Farmers'
Market closes a bit earlier than that.
My next strategy was to patronize the Stan
ford Produce Stand.This fantastic little racket
sets up in front of Tresidder every Friday after
noon. providing delicious locally grown pro
duce to the Stanford masses. For the last few
weeks, I've been buying fresh strawberries
and raspberries to compliment the goodies I
pilfer from the dining hall. My only real com
plaint about the Produce Stand is that they
don't accept meal plan points, which they the-
