## The 						audacity of Jenna 
### 
Last Tuesday, columnist Jenna Reback
wrote a scathing piece titled "I can see
Hoover Tower from my house," in which
she egregiously attacked my integrity. Since
then, several of you. Dear Readers, have asked
me "When. Kevin, will you proffer a rebuttal?"
First off, please never, ever use the word
"proffer." It is absurd.
Secondly, I have nothing much to say re
garding Reback. aside from the fact that SHE
IS NOW MY GREATEST ARCHNEMESIS
OF ALL TIME AND SHALL HI DE
STROYED. Allow me to explain.
In her column, she suggested that I "pal
around with Pete Carrol." And maybe I do. But
maybe Jenna Reback never bathes.
More troublingly, she also throws her hat
into the ring for hostilely taking over the Uni
versity. Well. I have decided that I will also
throw my hat into the "taking over Stanford"
ring,along with a dog,a desk and a small dress
er. Why all of these objects? Because I am a
man. and men can throw more than women.
And that is only the first reason why I am
more qualified for a coup d'etat. Reason No. 2:

I can whip out French-like coup d'etat on com
mand. so my administration would be able to
say "Screw you. Quebec!" in its native tongue.
(Vous vis, Quebec!) Iliis is extremely impor
tant.
Now, I have known Reback for several
years, and I consider her a good person and a
close friend. She is, however, also grossly in
competent and morally bankrupt.
For example, last year I was an RA, which
stands for "Community Organizer," where I
fostered a strong sense of belonging in new
freshmen. Reback. meanwhile, has been
charged twice with assault.

Winner? Me, but you probably don't want
to tell her that.
1 would oppose immigration. Jenna, as you
may not know, is a transfer student, one who
came to this great University, like all transfer
students, to steal our housing, our grades and
our freshman-oriented culture. Who cares that
they've chosen our school and way of life over
their own? The last thing we need are dedicated
people messing up the curve for the rest of us.
Ironically, Reback has privately accused me
of being a member of the "academic elite."
Well, Ms. Reback, I have seen my grades, and
trust me, there is very little that is elite about
them.
In fact, like many of you. 1 come from hum
ble.common origins. My grandfather, YusefVla
chokcxlnikev Webb, used to work in a trinket
making sweatshop in Zenborgia.The toys were
usually just older, lesser toys that they would
glue together with asbestos,but since everything
in Zenborgia was made that way, that's just
about as common as you can get.

The most important difference be
tween Jenna and I.though.is that 1 rep
resent change from school-leadership
as-usual. Reback, on the other hand,
has sided with the administration 90
percent of the time in her columns. Let
me repeat that:9o percent! Some mav
erick.
She even supported building the
new Walkways to Nowhere in White
Plaza. Can we really afford another
Plaza-gate?
Enough about my opponent. For
too long, we Stanford students have
been told "do this,""don't do that" and
"please put on pants — this is the
Alumni Center." But no more!

It's time to heal the major rifts on
this campus. Jocks and stoncrs. Jets and
Sharks. SLE and FroSoCo. We are not
a college of disparate groups; we are a
college of disparate groups who all
hate Cal.
Indeed, this irrationally passionate
hatred is one of the philosophies Re
back and 1 share. Berkeley is a known
terrorist state, founded by banshees
and fueled by the anguish of children.
But the problem, columnist, isn't
just Cal — it's Notre Dame. It's USC.
It's UC-Davis. We cannot allow such
unabashed toolishness to persist in the
world, and I have a definitive plan to
stop them: send the Band to all those
schools and let it do whatever the hell
it wants. If it does a good enough job, I
will send it to Brigham Young Univer
sity and say "go crazy."
By the time I'm done, when other
schools think of us, they will be like,
"Dude. Stanford's really cool. I wish I
were them." And another school,
school A's wingman, will say "Yeah." I
can't give you any more details 011 how
this will happen, but trust me, it will be
awesome.
Speaking of difficult promises to
keep, it given absolute power, my ad

ministration will make us perfect in all
sports forever. How can we expect to
have a respected football team when
players still have to make the difficult
choice between their personal lives and
practicing every moment they are
awake?
Ultimately, though,you should sup
port my unprecedented and meteoric
rise to a position I'm not totally quali
fied for because I have hope. Hope for
change. Hope for the future. Mostly,
though, I have hope that you won't tell
Jenna I wrote this.
She's got a nasty left hook.

Kevin can't believe that this is only his
third column and already he has an arch
nemesis. Let him know whose side
yon 're on at ktwebh@stanford.edu.
