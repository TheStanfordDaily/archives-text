## The
						audacity of Jenna 
### 
Last Tuesday, columnist Jenna Reback
wrote a scathing piece titled "I can see
Hoover Tower from my house," in which
she egregiously attacked my integrity. Since
then, several of you. Dear Readers, have asked
me "When. Kevin, will you proffer a rebuttal?"
First off, please never, ever use the word
"proffer." It is absurd.
Secondly, I have nothing much to say re
garding Reback. aside from the fact that SHE
IS NOW MY GREATEST ARCHNEMESIS
OF ALL TIME AND SHALL HI DE
STROYED. Allow me to explain.
In her column, she suggested that I "pal
around with Pete Carrol." And maybe I do. But
maybe Jenna Reback never bathes.
More troublingly, she also throws her hat
into the ring for hostilely taking over the Uni
versity. Well. I have decided that I will also
throw my hat into the "taking over Stanford"
ring,along with a dog,a desk and a small dress
er. Why all of these objects? Because I am a
man. and men can throw more than women.
And that is only the first reason why I am
more qualified for a coup d'etat. Reason No. 2:

I can whip out French-like coup d'etat on com
mand. so my administration would be able to
say "Screw you. Quebec!" in its native tongue.
(Vous vis, Quebec!) Iliis is extremely impor
tant.
Now, I have known Reback for several
years, and I consider her a good person and a
close friend. She is, however, also grossly in
competent and morally bankrupt.
For example, last year I was an RA, which
stands for "Community Organizer," where I
fostered a strong sense of belonging in new
freshmen. Reback. meanwhile, has been
charged twice with assault.

Winner? Me, but you probably don't want
to tell her that.
1 would oppose immigration. Jenna, as you
may not know, is a transfer student, one who
came to this great University, like all transfer
students, to steal our housing, our grades and
our freshman-oriented culture. Who cares that
they've chosen our school and way of life over
their own? The last thing we need are dedicated
people messing up the curve for the rest of us.
Ironically, Reback has privately accused me
of being a member of the "academic elite."
Well, Ms. Reback, I have seen my grades, and
trust me, there is very little that is elite about
them.
In fact, like many of you. 1 come from hum
ble.common origins. My grandfather, YusefVla
chokcxlnikev Webb, used to work in a trinket
making sweatshop in Zenborgia.The toys were
usually just older, lesser toys that they would
glue together with asbestos,but since everything
in Zenborgia was made that way, that's just
about as common as you can get.
