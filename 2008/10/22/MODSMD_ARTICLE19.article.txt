## FARM'S FRESHMAN FORCE 
### BY NATE ADAMS 
ike many Cardinal athletes, Lindsay Taylor
has being playing and loving all kinds of sports
for as long as she could throw a ball — or kick
one. Now. as No. 5 Stanford's leading goal-
I scorer, it's hard to doubt that soccer was a
good choice for Taylor to stick with. In her freshman cam
paign, the blossoming forward has been named Pacific 1(1
Conference Player of the Week and been given 'National
Team' honors twice. She has scored a conference leading
12 goals (including six game-winners), and leads a domi
nating Stanford offense that has outscored its opponents
48 to four.
So where did this girl come from?
For Taylor, soccer on the Farm is only the latest part of
a life that has always involved sports.
"I've always loved playing a variety of sports, basket-

ball especially." said Taylor, a four-year letter winner and
formci captain of Castilleja high school's basketball
squad. "I've played basketball since sixth grade. As a sen
ior. I decided to play golf. In middle school, I also played
tenuis and did swimming. I have always loved to compete
and be part of a team. Really, I just love to play."
It was soccer, though, that got her noticed. Despite not
playing in high school. Taylor was part of an elite club team
the MVI A Mercury, along with fellow freshman Tere
sa Noyola that won hack to back ('al North state titles.
"It was definitely a great environment to play soccer
in." she said. "Almost everyone went tin to play soccer at
I )ivision I schools."
I ven before college, layloi's soccer prospects seemed
to grow brighter and brighter. She may be getting named
to hypothetical "national teams" in magazines now, but
not long ago she was on a real one America's IJ 17
team.
"Playing for the national team playing at that level

with great players - was amazing," Taylor said. "It really
helps you to improve as a player."
Experiences like these playing on a championship
club team and a chance to compete lor her country —
helped direct Taylor's multi-faceted sports career towards
soccer.
"'lliey really helped me grow as a player, and made me
start to realize I may have something special with soccer,"
she said.
Taylor, of course, would go on to attend Stanford as a
soccer player, and while she finds herself longing for the
golf course or the basketball court every now and then.she
lias no future plans to don Cardinal colors for any sport
but soccer.
I ier teammates certainly approve of the choice.
"IT is a great gal." junior Kristin Stannard said. "She
comes up big in games when we need her to, and creates

lots of opportunities for our team. If
she is given an inch, she will take
that inch and hammer the ball in the
back of the net. And she is a hard
worker — she will work until she
just cannot run anymore."
Taylor's opponents, however,
likely wish she had chosen basket
ball.
"I remember running back to
our half after she scored her second
goal against Washington State [last
weekend)," Stannard said. "I heard
a girl on the other team say, 'Who
was marking her?' And another girl
replied. 'We had three people on
her."'

Taylor scored two goals — one
the game-winner — against Wash
ington State, both assisted by for
mer MVLA Mercury teammate
Noyola.
Taylor is glad to have teammates
like Noyola and Stannard backing
her up, and loves the dynamic pace
of their game plan.
"The transition [to college] has
been made a lot easier because of
the support from my teammates
and the coaches," she said, "I love
the possession- and attack-oriented
style of soccer that Stanford plays. I
haven't really had to change my ap
proach to the game — I still love [to
just] go out and have fun."
There's no question that Taylor,
though a rookie, is already an inte
gral part of this team. In fact,Taylor
is always sure to prioritize her
team's success ahead of her own.

"All of [my] awards have been
such a great honor," she said. "The
Pac-10 Player of the Week was an
especially cool award. Really,
though. I am just happy that the
team has been performing so well."
Indeed. Taylor may have more
goals this year than anyone in the
Pac-10, but there's only one "goal"
she has in mind when her name is
announced at game time.
"Our team is so great all the way
around, from our defense to our of
fense. and we want to make it to the
Final Four and win a national cham
pionship," she said.
Taylor hopes to help the team
continue its undefeated season at
home this weekend with games
against Arizona and Arizona State.
