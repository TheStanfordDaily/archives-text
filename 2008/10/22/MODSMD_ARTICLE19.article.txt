## FARM'S FRESHMAN FORCE 
### BY NATE ADAMS 
ike many Cardinal athletes, Lindsay Taylor
has being playing and loving all kinds of sports
for as long as she could throw a ball — or kick
one. Now. as No. 5 Stanford's leading goal-
I scorer, it's hard to doubt that soccer was a
good choice for Taylor to stick with. In her freshman cam
paign, the blossoming forward has been named Pacific 1(1
Conference Player of the Week and been given 'National
Team' honors twice. She has scored a conference leading
12 goals (including six game-winners), and leads a domi
nating Stanford offense that has outscored its opponents
48 to four.
So where did this girl come from?
For Taylor, soccer on the Farm is only the latest part of
a life that has always involved sports.
"I've always loved playing a variety of sports, basket-

ball especially." said Taylor, a four-year letter winner and
formci captain of Castilleja high school's basketball
squad. "I've played basketball since sixth grade. As a sen
ior. I decided to play golf. In middle school, I also played
tenuis and did swimming. I have always loved to compete
and be part of a team. Really, I just love to play."
It was soccer, though, that got her noticed. Despite not
playing in high school. Taylor was part of an elite club team
the MVI A Mercury, along with fellow freshman Tere
sa Noyola that won hack to back ('al North state titles.
"It was definitely a great environment to play soccer
in." she said. "Almost everyone went tin to play soccer at
I )ivision I schools."
I ven before college, layloi's soccer prospects seemed
to grow brighter and brighter. She may be getting named
to hypothetical "national teams" in magazines now, but
not long ago she was on a real one America's IJ 17
team.
"Playing for the national team playing at that level

with great players - was amazing," Taylor said. "It really
helps you to improve as a player."
Experiences like these playing on a championship
club team and a chance to compete lor her country —
helped direct Taylor's multi-faceted sports career towards
soccer.
"'lliey really helped me grow as a player, and made me
start to realize I may have something special with soccer,"
she said.
Taylor, of course, would go on to attend Stanford as a
soccer player, and while she finds herself longing for the
golf course or the basketball court every now and then.she
lias no future plans to don Cardinal colors for any sport
but soccer.
I ier teammates certainly approve of the choice.
"IT is a great gal." junior Kristin Stannard said. "She
comes up big in games when we need her to, and creates
