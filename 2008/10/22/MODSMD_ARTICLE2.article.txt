# Candidates' energy policies debated
## McCain, Obama energy advisors agree on most points, differ on nuclear power, drilling and cap and trade

Energy advisors to presidential candidates
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Barack
Obama (D-Ill.) debated last night in a packed
Kresge Auditorium.
The debate, called "Presidential
Perspectives on Energy and Innovation" and
hosted by Scientists and Engineers for
America, highlighted the components of each
candidate's energy platforms in opening state
ments and rebuttals, then addressed specifics
questions from the audience.
Kurt Yeager. the McCain representative, is
co-chair of the McCain California Energy
Security Coalition. Daniel Kammen, the
Obama representative, is senior advisor on
energy and environmental policy for the
Illinois senator. The debate was moderated by
Paul Rogers, a resources and environmental
writer for The San Jose Mercury News.
The debate covered a range of topics
involving the candidates' energy policies.
"At the 30,000-foot level, the positions of
both campaigns are thankfully pretty similar."
Kammen said.
Both campaigns stressed the general simi
larities between the two platforms. "There is
a great deal of consistency from a national
standpoint," Yeager said, "and that is ulti

mately good."
But the energy policies of McCain and
Obama are by no means identical.
"The differences between candidates when
you get into the details are really extreme,"
Kammen told The Daily after the debate.
Much of the debate was spent exploring
those differences, many of which stem from
diverging opinions in political ideology.
"Above all. we must resist the temptation to
rely more on taxes and artificial subsides."
Yeager said. "Senator McCain would argue
that the focus and purpose of government as
proven in the past is to help and facilitate the
private sector."
"Sen. Obama is committed to a 10-year.
$150 billion program divided between dramat
ically increasing the federal R&D component
and building markets." Kammen said.
Beyond the typical Democrat-Republican
divide over use of the public and private sec
tors, the advisors disagreed over several specif
ic policies.
One obvious difference arose when dis
cussing nuclear power.
"We must restart our nuclear energy indus
try." Yeager said. "Nuclear energy in the future
is an important dimension of not just our ener-

gy future, but the whole world's."
But the Obama campaign was
less forward about a nuclear pro
gram.
"The expansion of nuclear power
is contingent on safe and locally
accepted disposal methods,"
Kammen said.
Another discrepancy was related
to the cap and trade system for car
bon emissions. Both support creat
ing a system of carbon permits trad
ed between corporations to help
control emissions. The campaigns
differ, however, in their implementa
tion strategies.
"The Obama campaign calls for
auctioning off the credits right now to
raise the revenues to make good on
these promises." Kammen said.
ITie money from selling the per
mits would go to the government to
invest in the energy programs that
Obama proposes.
"The McCain plan is to set a set of
progress points and hold the private
sector accountable to that." Yeager
said.
The McCain cap-and-trade system
would not sell the permits to private
sectors but give them freely and allow
corporations to trade the permits.
"This is not a give-away pro
gram," Yeager added. "It's a pro
gram intended not to bankrupt the
private sector, which all ot us will

pay for."
Another contested point was off
shore drilling. Both campaigns sup
port offshore drilling to some
degree, but the representatives dif
fered in their views on states' rights
to their shorelines.
"[Offshore drilling] is a viable
alternative that can create new ener
gy for us rather quickly," Yeager
said. "It is a step towards reducing
our dependence [on foreign oil].
There is a point where national
interest exceeds states' rights."
Kammen stood up for states'
rights.
"Offshore drilling would be per
missible if part of a broader portfolio
of clean technologies," Kammen
said. "States' rights would be respect
ed. That's a blanket statement."
Both advisors seized the opportu
nity to detail what the opposing
campaign was doing wrong.
Yeager criticized the Obama
campaign for promoting "renewable
energy 'Ã¼beralis.'" Also, he added
that Obama is putting his emphasis
on a "limited portfolio of energy
resources."
Kammen criticized the McCain
campaign for "saying the words
without backing them up with sub
stance." He criticized McCain's posi
tions on cap and trade and said his
"support of 45 nuclear plants is
unrealistic without the technical
capacity."
However, as noted by Mike
Rogers '12, "they were both pretty
agreeable."
"1 liked the fact that they're hav

ing the debate," said Zach Ming '12.
"It shows that both candidates care
about energy, which is new in
Washington. 1 like that Stanford
cares."
The debate drew many students
interested in the science of energy,
but some with advanced study in the
subject area were skeptical.
"It's always nice to see numbers
and plots," said Dan Strickland, a
graduate student in mechanical
engineering. "Without seeing any
real citations, it was hard to believe
anything they say."
Though no one said the debate
would influence his or her vote,
Ming noted that he was happy the
topic was being discussed.
"This issue is not going to go
away when this election is over." he
said. "The more we talk about it.the
more likely something's going to
happen."
