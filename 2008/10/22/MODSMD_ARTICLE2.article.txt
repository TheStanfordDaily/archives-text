Energy advisors to presidential candidates
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Barack
Obama (D-Ill.) debated last night in a packed
Kresge Auditorium.
The debate, called "Presidential
Perspectives on Energy and Innovation" and
hosted by Scientists and Engineers for
America, highlighted the components of each
candidate's energy platforms in opening state

questions from the audience.
Kurt Yeager. the McCain representative, is
co-chair of the McCain California Energy
Security Coalition. Daniel Kammen, the
Obama representative, is senior advisor on

diverging opinions in political ideology.
"Above all. we must resist the temptation to
rely more on taxes and artificial subsides."
Yeager said. "Senator McCain would argue
that the focus and purpose of government as
proven in the past is to help and facilitate the
private sector."
"Sen. Obama is committed to a 10-year.
$150 billion program divided between dramat
ically increasing the federal R&D component
and building markets." Kammen said.
Beyond the typical Democrat-Republican
divide over use of the public and private sec
tors, the advisors disagreed over several specif
ic policies.
One obvious difference arose when dis
cussing nuclear power.
"We must restart our nuclear energy indus

is an important dimension of not just our ener-
