# Nolan never had a chance
## 
### 
Sometimes truth is stranger than
fiction. If you were an NFL
head coach, and you were to be
fired, how do you think it would go
down? A calm, postseason briefing in
the owner's office? An angry con
frontation with upper management
in which your every decision was
called into question?
Or do you think you'd get your
pink slip literally right after sitting
through a post-game press confer
ence, explaining yet another loss and
answering questions about your own
job security? Do you think you'd be
asked to go through that kind of awk
wardness?
Former 49ers head coach Mike
Nolan was. Assistant head coach
Mike Singletary is already in charge
of the team in the interim and will
lead the Niners into action against
Seattle this Sunday.
Sometimes it's no fun to be right.
In this space a week ago. I predicted
that the Nolan regime would soon
come to an end. hoping that former
Raiders coach Lane Kiffin would be
hired for the long term, with his fa
ther. Monte, tabbed to run the de
fense. And now that Nolan has been
shown the door, all that can happen.
But somehow, you think it could
have just been handled better. As I
wrote last week, the 49ers have a lot
to be thankful for when it comes to
the Nolan regime, linlike four years
ago. when he arrived, there's no gap
ing power vacuum — General Man
ager Sfolt McCloughan and Single
tary are both solid football people
who won't let the team fall apart as it
did after the firing of Steve Mariucci.
Both were appointed bv Nolan and
will now have to take up more of the
load in his absence.
It's a testament to the former
49ers coach that he was both able
and willing to surround himself by
personalities strong enough to carry
that responsibility reasonably well.
ITie team may not take the next step
with Singletary at the helm, but it
won't collapse either.
Interestingly, despite the less
than-ideal circumstances under
which Nolan learned he had lost his
job. here was another Bay Area
coach who handled the difficult situ
ation of being forced out with quiet
dignity. There was no railing against
an ownership group many casual
49er fans feel very passionately
about, often in a negative way. And.
there was no backstabbing directed
at his former subordinates who
would now be running the show
without him.
Instead, like Kiffin. after he was
fired from the Raiders a few short
weeks ago, Nolan had nothing but
praise for his players, lamenting only
that he couldn't be there to help
them turn the corner. Indeed,the for
mer 49ers coach even encouraged his
protege, Singletary. to accept the job
he was initially reluctant to take and
coach in his mentor's place.
Ultimately, it wasn't going to
work with Nolan in San Francisco.
And to be sure,he shares some of the
blame for that — particularly in the
way his defense has looked tentative
and soft for much of 2008 and in the
disastrous miscommunication that
virtually severed any hope at a pro
ductive relationship between quar
terback Alex Smith and the team.
But, the clear and definite progress
made by the 49ers during his tenure
speaks well of him. Perhaps it's not
that Mike Nolan wasn't ready for
one of the NFL's most high-profile
coaching gigs, but rather that the
49ers weren't entirely ready for him.
Too often, fans are trapped in the
past, and for San Francisco, that
means any coach who ever wants to
walk the sidelines for the Niners will
be measured against the shadow of
Stanford and 49ers legend Bill
Walsh. And that's a pretty long shad
ow. Its even longer when you come
into the job with a defensive back
ground and a workmanlike approach
to the game — a formula that can
work, has worked, and will work
plenty of times in the future, but is
entirely lacking in the professorial
and artistic flair of a Walsh-coached
offense.
As much as anything, it was
