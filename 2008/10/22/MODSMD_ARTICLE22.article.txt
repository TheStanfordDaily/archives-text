## Governor summons lawmakers Emergency session called for sitting Calif. legislators 
### EVAN HALPER THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SACRAMENTO, Calif. — Gov.
Arnold Schwarzenegger's decision
Tuesday to call California lawmak
ers back for a special session in No
vember comes with several strategic
advantages.
The governor is planning to sum
mon sitting lawmakers — not the
new class that will be elected in two
weeks — for the emergency session.
They already are versed in the intri
cacies of the current state spending
plan and no longer will be waging
reelection campaigns. Some will be
leaving the Legislature when their
terms expire Nov. 30.
Analysts say that if
Schwarzenegger proposes a tax in
crease again to deal with the state's
fiscal problems, the current crop of
lawmakers is still his best hope of
passing it — even though Republi
can members beat back his efforts
to raise the sales tax temporarily
during the summer. Administration
officials say they are drafting a plan
to submit to lawmakers.
"There are some ... lame-duck
Republicans who could probably be
persuaded to be made more agree
able to his fiscal approach," Repub
lican political analyst Tony Quinn
said. "Some are leaving office and
have no plan of running again. I am
sure he hopes he can put together an
arrangement with them."
Quinn also said the resolve of
Republican lawmakers to block
taxes could soften if Democrats
make big gains statewide Nov. 4.
"It would be harder for them to
say the *no new taxes' mantra has
been validated by voters,"he said.

Schwarzenegger is calling on the
Legislature to fix a budget passed
only weeks ago. which is already at
least $3 billion in the red. "We just
don't believe we can wait to attack
this deficit." Schwarzenegger
spokesman Aaron McLear said.
Administration officials said
Tuesday that the governor had not
yet decided whether to propose a
tax hike. Republican legislative
leaders maintained that their cau
cuses would continue to block any
proposals for new taxes.
"California's economy cannot
handle a tax increase." Senate Re
publican Leader Dave Cogdill said.
Regardless, steep cuts in services
are almost certain to be part of any
plan the governor proposes. Fiscal
analysts say it would be extremely
difficult to balance the budget with
out cuts.
At a news conference in Carson
on Tuesday. Schwarzenegger said
the session would allow lawmakers
to "fix some of the problems that
need to be fixed."
"With the financial crisis, the
economy, the housing market,
things have changed so quickly from
one week to the next," the governor
said.
He said lawmakers could use the
special session to speed up alloca
tion of public-works bond money
and see if legislation can be enacted
to help people facing foreclosure
stay in their homes.
Schwarzenegger this year vetoed
all but one of more than a dozen
bills that lawmakers passed to ad
dress the housing crisis.
Economists, meanwhile, say the
outlook for state revenue is bleak
and the deficit is almost certain to
grow.
"We're going to have falling job
levels and rising unemployment."
said Stephen Levy, director of the
Center for the Continuing Study of

the Economy in Palo Alto. "We have
moved into a major, consumer-driv
en economic decline that is going to
take some time to settle out."
Now, the state is looking to Con
gress for help. The governor sent a
letter to congressional leaders Tues
day. urging them to approve eco
nomic stimulus measures for states.
Such a package could include an
increase in funding for health-care
programs for the poor as well as
grants for public works projects. It
also should fund an extension of un
employment insurance benefits, the
governor said. The plan could gen
erate as much as $6 billion in state
and local aid to California.
"Congress should move as quick
ly as possible to enact this legisla
tion," he wrote. "The timing of an
economic stimulus package is just as
important as its components."
As state lawmakers grapple with
the state's fiscal troubles, they will
get advice from someone new: Law
makers announced that they have
chosen Mac Taylor, a 30-year veter
an of the nonpartisan Legislative
Analyst's Office, to take over that
operation.
Taylor replaces Elizabeth G. Hill,
the long-serving analyst who consis
tently advised lawmakers to con
front the state's constant debt and
stop pushing the chronic deficit into
the future. She had become known
in the Capitol as the"budget nun."
Taylor was diplomatic when
asked about lawmakers' tendency
to ignore the advice of the office.
"Sometimes it takes awhile for ideas
or information to filter through." he
said.
He said bringing the state's fi
nances under control is going to be a
big challenge. "We're clearly going
to be in a string of seriously difficult
fiscal times." he said. " There are no
magic answers. It would have been
made evident if there were.
