# Stanford falls short in Regionals
## In-state rivals best Card in heated tourney on the Farm 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's tennis team
hosted the ITA Northwest Regional
Championships last weekend on the
Farm, but it was California and Fresno
State that took the spotlight.
As 16 programs from the area con
vened at the Taube Tennis Center, the
Cardinal women looked to defend
their home court, as they did last sea
son when then-junior Jessica Nguyen
took home the singles title. Nguyen
did not play in the Championships
this year.
Still. Stanford was well represent
ed in the tournament, with seven play
ers in the main singles draw and three
teams in the doubles draw.
Of the seven players, four reached
the round of 16, including top-seeded
sophomore Hilary Barte, No. 8 junior
Lindsay Burdette, No. 12 sophomore
Carolyn McVeigh and freshman
Veronica Li. But Stanford was not
alone in sending such a talented
group to the sweet 16 as conference
rival Cal matched the Cardinal with
four players of its own.
Barte would be the only Cardinal
member to advance to the quarterfi
nals, joined by four Cal women.
"It speaks a lot for how solid Cal
is." Barte said."We're a young team. It
was weird not playing next to my
teammates, but at the same time it was
motivating—l didn't want to see
only Bears playing at our school."
And against Cal's Claire Ilcinkas,
Barte almost lost, facing a match
point in the second set.
"I thought she was playing really
well to start the match." Barte said."l
had my chances in the first set, but I
didn't convert and she took advan
tage of that. In the second set. I decid
ed to fight for every point."
Barte would rally for a 2-6.7-6 (1).
6-0 win to meet Bojana Bobusic in the
semifinals. After playing seven sets on
the day. Barte finally succumbed to
Bobusic 7-6 (6). 3-6, 7-5 in a hard
fought match.
"I definitely had my chances in
that match, and it still kind of hurts
right now," Barte said. "I had it in my
fingertips. Next time."
Despite her loss. Barte was pleased
with how much she matured since the
beginning of last season, as was evi
dent in the tournament.
"I think I'm still a work in progress,
definitely, but I feel good about that
performance." Barte said."Physically.
I'm a lot stronger than I was last year.
Mentally. I'm more mature and
calmer on the court — it's a good step
forward for me and the team."
Aside from Barte's strong play.
Burdette showed that she is ready to
bounce back from a particularly long

off-season last year. Burdette picked
up two wins in three matches over the
weekend.
"I didn't play as much over the
summer and definitely needed a
break after last year and struggling."
Burdette said. "Iliis year, I'm playing
and moving a lot better. I definitely
need some wins to get my confidence
going, but it was great to get a couple
matches under my belt."
In doubles, Stanford decided toex
periment with its lineup in prepara
tion for the dual-match season. In
doing so. the dynamic duo of Barte
and Burdette was split up — Barte
teamed with Li, while Burdette
played with McVeigh.

"I definitely had
my chances in that
match, and it still
kind of hurts right
now."

— HILARY BARTE,
sophomore

"To be honest, at first it was a little
weird." Barte said. "It took a few
games to get used to it because I'm so
used to playing with Lindsay. Veroni
ca and I played well together,
though."
Barte and Li reached the quarterfi
nals of the doubles draw before falling
8-4 against eventual champions Rena
ta Kucerkova and Anastasia Petukho
va of Fresno State. In fact, Fresno
State's Melanie Gloria also took
home the singles title, making it a Bull
dog sweep at this year's regionals.
"I think that this tournament reaf
firmed some positive and negative
things," Burdette said. "It reaffirmed
that we're not ready yet, which is fine
since we want to be ready from Janu
ary until May. It also reaffirmed how
much we have to offer this season."
Flie tournament was a greater suc
cess than the final standings might
imply. Besides additional match play
for the entire roster, the squad was
able to watch its young freshmen in
action for the first time this season.
"They looked good." Burdette
said. "They all know how to win and
that's going to be valuable this sea
son."
The next time Stanford will return

to the Farm will be in late January
against UC-Davis. It may be a long in
terlude until then, but after a travel
heavy 2007 campaign, the Cardinal
women will play 14 of their 17 match
es at home.
"Traveling last year was very

tough and challenging in so many
ways," Burdette said. "We're going to
be at home for almost every single
match, and that's going to be huge for
us. especially our freshmen. I played
on the home court for this tourna
ment, and that's all 1 could think

about — all of our matches being at
home."
Finally, the Cardinal will catch a
break.

Mentally. I'm more mature and
calmer on the court — it's a good step
forward for me and the team."
Aside from Barte's strong play.
Burdette showed that she is ready to
bounce back from a particularly long

off-season last year. Burdette picked
up two wins in three matches over the
weekend.
"I didn't play as much over the
summer and definitely needed a
break after last year and struggling."
Burdette said. "Iliis year, I'm playing
and moving a lot better. I definitely
need some wins to get my confidence
going, but it was great to get a couple
matches under my belt."
In doubles, Stanford decided toex
periment with its lineup in prepara
tion for the dual-match season. In
doing so. the dynamic duo of Barte
and Burdette was split up — Barte
teamed with Li, while Burdette
played with McVeigh.

"I definitely had
my chances in that
match, and it still
kind of hurts right
now."

— HILARY BARTE,
sophomore

"To be honest, at first it was a little
weird." Barte said. "It took a few
games to get used to it because I'm so
used to playing with Lindsay. Veroni
ca and I played well together,
though."
Barte and Li reached the quarterfi
nals of the doubles draw before falling
8-4 against eventual champions Rena
ta Kucerkova and Anastasia Petukho
va of Fresno State. In fact, Fresno
State's Melanie Gloria also took
home the singles title, making it a Bull
dog sweep at this year's regionals.
"I think that this tournament reaf
firmed some positive and negative
things," Burdette said. "It reaffirmed
that we're not ready yet, which is fine
since we want to be ready from Janu
ary until May. It also reaffirmed how
much we have to offer this season."
Flie tournament was a greater suc
cess than the final standings might
imply. Besides additional match play
for the entire roster, the squad was
able to watch its young freshmen in
action for the first time this season.
"They looked good." Burdette
said. "They all know how to win and
that's going to be valuable this sea
son."
The next time Stanford will return

to the Farm will be in late January
against UC-Davis. It may be a long in
terlude until then, but after a travel
heavy 2007 campaign, the Cardinal
women will play 14 of their 17 match
es at home.
"Traveling last year was very

tough and challenging in so many
ways," Burdette said. "We're going to
be at home for almost every single
match, and that's going to be huge for
us. especially our freshmen. I played
on the home court for this tourna
ment, and that's all 1 could think

about — all of our matches being at
home."
Finally, the Cardinal will catch a
break.
