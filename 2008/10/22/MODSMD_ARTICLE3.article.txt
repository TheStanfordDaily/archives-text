## Kissers face FMOTQ aftermath No uptick in health problems yet, says Vaden 
### KATE BARBER 
It's been a week since Full Moon
on the Quad, and unlike the days of
yore, kissers are more likely to
remember last Tuesday's festivities
by the hacking cough they've devel
oped rather than by a rose given by a
senior.
But the night's most prolific kiss
er, Stanford Tree Patrick Fortune *09
reported that he is still symptom
free.
"I'm really happy to get the word
out that I'm not sick," Fortune said,
"because so many people thought I
had diseases."
Fortune showed up to the event in
full evergreen garb, armed with a
counting clicker to keep a kiss tally
for the night â€” the record is believed
to be in the seven to eight hundreds.
So just how many girls did the
Tree kiss this time around?
"The clicker had some problems,"
Fortune said. "I probably kissed
about 450 people, possibly more if
you count before and after and in
between."
'ITiough he fell short of the record.
Fortune has now kissed roughly 15
percent of Stanford's female under
graduate population.
While the PHEs provided
Listerine and chocolate kisses.
Fortune took his own precautions to
avoid spreading illness during Full
Moon.
"We had mouthwash on hand," he
said. "I was offering it to girls. We
wanted to keep it fresh and clean."
Fortune feels fine at the moment,
but his immune system isn't out of
the woods just yet.
