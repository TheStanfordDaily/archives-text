## Kissers face FMOTQ aftermath No uptick in health problems yet, says Vaden 
### KATE BARBER 
It's been a week since Full Moon
on the Quad, and unlike the days of
yore, kissers are more likely to
remember last Tuesday's festivities
by the hacking cough they've devel
oped rather than by a rose given by a
senior.
But the night's most prolific kiss
er, Stanford Tree Patrick Fortune *09
reported that he is still symptom
free.
"I'm really happy to get the word
out that I'm not sick," Fortune said,
"because so many people thought I
had diseases."
Fortune showed up to the event in
full evergreen garb, armed with a
counting clicker to keep a kiss tally
for the night — the record is believed
to be in the seven to eight hundreds.
So just how many girls did the
Tree kiss this time around?
"The clicker had some problems,"
Fortune said. "I probably kissed
about 450 people, possibly more if
you count before and after and in
between."
'ITiough he fell short of the record.
Fortune has now kissed roughly 15
percent of Stanford's female under
graduate population.
While the PHEs provided
Listerine and chocolate kisses.
Fortune took his own precautions to
avoid spreading illness during Full
Moon.
"We had mouthwash on hand," he
said. "I was offering it to girls. We
wanted to keep it fresh and clean."
Fortune feels fine at the moment,
but his immune system isn't out of
the woods just yet.
"I've heard that mono takes a few
weeks to incubate," he said,"but right
now I feel great."
Jarreau Bowen. peer health edu
cation coordinator at Vaden. agreed
with Fortune, and said that Full
Moon on the Quad doesn't usually
cause significant health problems for
students.
"It actually takes a little longer
than a week for people to show full
cold, tlu or in worse cases, mono
symptoms, so we wouldn't see the
signs of cases specific to Full Moon
for at least another week," Bowen
said in an email to The Daily. "That
being said, historically, Vaden does
not see an increase of cases in the
month after Full Moon. Although the
event has a reputation for spreading
disease, our data shows that this is
not the case."
Still, Bowen acknowledged that
the potential to share germs does
exist, and several organizations work
to increase awareness about this phe
nomenon.
"As with any situation in which
students are in intimate proximity
with one another, there is a possibili
ty of spreading germs." he said. "The
week before Full Moon. Vaden. in
collaboration with Residential
Education, sends out an email with
tips about preparing for Full Moon."
Fortune was not the only student
trying to rack up a high number of
kisses. Marcus Williams '09 was one
of several seniors who played a

"bingo" game to compete for

kisses.
"One of my drawmates
and I created T-shirts with
characteristics of freshmen
we would like to kiss in a
giant bingo box," Williams

said. "We carried markers and
crossed off the boxes as we
kissed someone who fit the
description. We were more or

less tied, but then I pulled ahead

by kissing a tennis player."
"To be fair, [my drawmate] tech
nically got bingo about six seconds
before me. but I had my bingo square
almost blacked out at the end of the
night." he added. "The boxes I could
n't fill were J-Ro and Casa Zapata,
go figure."
Despite mouth-to-mouth contact
with so many people and a few
alarming symptoms, Williams
believes he avoided illness.
"I've had symptoms of several
small things: a bad sore throat on
Thursday, an aching headache on
Saturday, and now I have a small
cough," he said.
"Luckily, 1 took a multi-vitamin
before going to bed, stole someone in
6Xo's mouthwash temporarily and
am immune to illness," he then boast
ed.
Still, the tradition of Full Moon
romance does remain for some.
Take, for example. Marlene
Kennedy '11, pictured in mid-kiss on
the front page of last Wednesday's

BECCA DEL MONTE/The Stanford Daily

Daily. Kennedy said she wasn't fazed
when she woke up and saw the pic
ture.
"Tim [the sophomore she was pic
tured kissing] texted me and said that
we were on the front cover and I
thought it was a joke," she said. "But
when 1 got to Hum Bio. four people
brought me copies. I was surprised
and I guess it was very surreal. I did
get a lot of comments and it was all I
heard about for three or four days.
Mostly it was just kind of fun."
Luckily for Kennedy, she and Tim
Wolfe '11 are dating.
"We were kissing and there was
this bright flash and this guy with a
camera asked if it could be put in."
Kennedy said. "We said yes because
it's not embarrassing, since we're dat
ing. Our first kiss was at Full Moon
last year so it's a little funny that we
were on the front page this year."
