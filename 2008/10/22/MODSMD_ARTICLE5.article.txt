# ROOKIES GIVE CARD HOPE FOR FUTURE
## 
### BY WILL DOOLEY 
As the men's soccer team crosses the
midway point of its conference
schedule, having achieved limited
success so far, it's appropriate to
focus on the future of the team: the
freshmen. Although they have not been a large
part of Stanford's plans this season —only one
of the six true freshmen has started — coach
Bret Simon has been overjoyed with their
progress and potential.
Initially. Simon wasn't sure what kind of
group he had, but they made him into a believer.
"I really like this class," Simon said. "I think
they will blossom; they are exceptionally hard
working."

According to Simon, there are generally two
different ways freshmen players fare when they
make the jump to college soccer. Either the pres
sure of the bigger stage and the transition to a
more skilled league makes them play miserably,
or they start comfortably but run into the
proverbial wall of the reality of college.
School work, schedules, classes, girls and parties
— handling it all can be just as challenging, if not
more so. for athletes as it is for regular students.
Simon expressed just how impressed he was
that, across the board, all of his freshmen appear
to have avoided these problems.
"This group is strange in that all players have
gotten better every couple of weeks, becoming
more than competitive with the rest of the
group," he said.
The freshmen themselves offered an alterna
tive explanation.
"The team as a whole is pretty awesome,"
said true freshmen Cullen Wilson. "Nobody's
been ostracized, the older guys have really
helped, and that translated onto the field."

Cullen Wilson is part of a freshman class that has earned the respect of both coach Bret Simon
and the team's upperclassmen, despite limited playing time during a down year for the Cardinal.
It's not just the older players helping the
freshmen, but also the preseason experience of
living with other freshmen for five weeks before
school started.
"We have a good freshman group you can al
ways fall back on." Wilson said. "Because of pre
season. the class is tight, you get to know every
body's sense of humor. We hang out outside of
class too."
But the coaching staff and upperclassmen
have a different answer, putting the freshmen
progress firmly on their attitude.
"Our freshmen are awesome," said fifth-year
senior Tommy Montgomery, who has started
every game this year. "It's really nice when they
are willing to sacrifice for the team: I think they

are all in it for the long haul."
"They always want to help the team, they are
always agreeable," Simon echoed. "As a group,
they are humble. You don't usually say that
about groups, just individual players."
That's not to say they aren't competitive or
hungry for the spotlight.
"Definitely as freshmen you want to estab
lish yourself, it's in all our minds," Wilson said.
"You go out in practice and want to show that,
and if you get into a game, you want to prove to
the team you belong."
Simon noted that the guys played a lot of
games before practice — horseshoes, soccer,
volleyball and the like — and speculated that
maybe this is why the team has gotten along so

well. The competitiveness and unity has then
translated to the pitch.
"The main thing with our freshman is that
throughout the game they are supportive and
into the game, whether or not they are playing,"
Montgomery said."l don't always see that."
Even if their playing time is limited.the fresh
men are still having fun.
"I enjoy having soccer to balance school,"
Wilson said. "I look forward to playing with a
good group of guys everyday."
The freshman class has shown a small pre
view of what the future holds — they've man
aged two goals and two assists between them.
"They'll be fine," Montgomery said. "They
just need to keep that attitude."

"If they continue to work hard, continue to
progress, they will be a coach's dream," Simon
said of their unique group dynamic.
But he stressed that the class's future certain
ly "hasn't yet been written."
"I don't think they have really felt pressure to
perform yet," Simon said.
It is both a warning and a challenge to the
freshmen class.
But while Wilson was a bit apprehensive, he
seemed exhilarated by the prospect of next year.
"Were losing a bunch of key guys," he said.
"But that's a chance for others to step up, and I
think they definitely will."
