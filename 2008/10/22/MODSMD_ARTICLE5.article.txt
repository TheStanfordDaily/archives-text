# ROOKIES GIVE CARD HOPE FOR FUTURE
## 
### BY WILL DOOLEY 
As the men's soccer team crosses the
midway point of its conference
schedule, having achieved limited
success so far, it's appropriate to
focus on the future of the team: the
freshmen. Although they have not been a large
part of Stanford's plans this season —only one
of the six true freshmen has started — coach
Bret Simon has been overjoyed with their
progress and potential.
Initially. Simon wasn't sure what kind of
group he had, but they made him into a believer.
"I really like this class," Simon said. "I think
they will blossom; they are exceptionally hard
working."

According to Simon, there are generally two
different ways freshmen players fare when they
make the jump to college soccer. Either the pres
sure of the bigger stage and the transition to a
more skilled league makes them play miserably,
or they start comfortably but run into the
proverbial wall of the reality of college.
School work, schedules, classes, girls and parties
— handling it all can be just as challenging, if not
more so. for athletes as it is for regular students.
Simon expressed just how impressed he was
that, across the board, all of his freshmen appear
to have avoided these problems.
"This group is strange in that all players have
gotten better every couple of weeks, becoming
more than competitive with the rest of the
group," he said.
The freshmen themselves offered an alterna
tive explanation.
"The team as a whole is pretty awesome,"
said true freshmen Cullen Wilson. "Nobody's
been ostracized, the older guys have really
helped, and that translated onto the field."

Cullen Wilson is part of a freshman class that has earned the respect of both coach Bret Simon
and the team's upperclassmen, despite limited playing time during a down year for the Cardinal.
