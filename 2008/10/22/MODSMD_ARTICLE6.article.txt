## Row board bills cause confusion All board bills added to Univ. bill next quarter 
### JENNY REMPEL 
Confusion about board bills in
houses on the Row has drawn
numerous student complaints
recently, as residents on financial aid
struggle to pay unanticipated bills.
Currently, Row board bills are not
included on the University bill and
can take students by surprise.
Five Row houses participated in
a pilot program this quarter under
which their house board bill was
included in the University bill, and
next quarter, the program will be
expanded to include all Row houses.
Financial aid for all students is
based on a standard cost of atten
dance. regardless of where students
are living. For the 2008-2009 school
year, students are allotted $11,182
for room and board.
lliis is the exact cost of room and
board for students living in a resi
dence such as Branner. but for stu
dents living on the Row. actual living
costs are often slightly more expen
sive.
"Financial aid does cover your
basic living expenses," said Director
of Financial Aid Karen Cooper.
"But are we paying attention to the
exact dollar amount that each indi
vidual student is charged? No. We're
making a standard allowance for
everyone."
Currently, the University bill
does not include board costs for stu
dents on the Row. When they
receive a second bill from their
houses several weeks after the start
of the quarter, many of these stu
dents are surprised.
"One of the big problems is that
Financial Aid doesn't make it as
known as it should be." said ASSU
