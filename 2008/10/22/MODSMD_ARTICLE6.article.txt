## Row board bills cause confusion All board bills added to Univ. bill next quarter 
### JENNY REMPEL 
Confusion about board bills in
houses on the Row has drawn
numerous student complaints
recently, as residents on financial aid
struggle to pay unanticipated bills.
Currently, Row board bills are not
included on the University bill and
can take students by surprise.
Five Row houses participated in
a pilot program this quarter under
which their house board bill was
included in the University bill, and
next quarter, the program will be
expanded to include all Row houses.
Financial aid for all students is
based on a standard cost of atten
dance. regardless of where students
are living. For the 2008-2009 school
year, students are allotted $11,182
for room and board.
lliis is the exact cost of room and
board for students living in a resi
dence such as Branner. but for stu
dents living on the Row. actual living
costs are often slightly more expen
sive.
"Financial aid does cover your
basic living expenses," said Director
of Financial Aid Karen Cooper.
"But are we paying attention to the
exact dollar amount that each indi
vidual student is charged? No. We're
making a standard allowance for
everyone."
Currently, the University bill
does not include board costs for stu
dents on the Row. When they
receive a second bill from their
houses several weeks after the start
of the quarter, many of these stu
dents are surprised.
"One of the big problems is that
Financial Aid doesn't make it as
known as it should be." said ASSU
Senator Ana Diaz-Hernandez '11. "I've
spoken to a lot [of students] who were
not aware of this until after they'd
already signed a contract and were
already planning to live on the Row."
The autumn quarter bill is more
expensive than those for winter or
spring — something that also comes as a
surprise to students.
"It confuses a lot of people when they
get that first bill and it's so high,"

Cooper said.
Some students take out scholarship
money from their spring quarter to pay
for this higher bill, but others are forced
to take out student loans.
Last year's elimination of loans in
financial aid packages has caused prob
lems as well. Students are now expected
to contribute to their aid package
through work-study, but when board
bills are due at the beginning of the
quarter, students have not yet had the
opportunity to work. This means that
some students on financial aid are still
forced to take out loans just to cover the
early board bills on the Row.
Some members of the Undergraduate

Senate have grown concerned that stu
dents of lower-income families will avoid
living on the row.
"What you'd expect as a result of this
and what you often see, speaking anec
dotally, is that demographically the aver
age person on the Row is economically
better off than the average Stanford stu
dent." said Senator Luukas lives '09.
Cooper agreed that the potential for
stratification of the campus exists, but
said students can work with the Office of
Financial Aid to live in whatever resi
dence they choose.
"You have to budget a little more
carefully perhaps if you've chosen a din
ing option that's not on the University

bill," Cooper said. "But I think it's
important to remember that we're talk
ing about a couple hundred dollars, not
differences of thousands."
Next quarter, the board bill will be
included in the University bill for all
Row houses.
"1 think the new plan is a great idea
because it will save a lot of trouble on
both sides — both for financial managers
and the people on financial aid." said Tim
Lim '09, Bob's financial manager.
This may seem like a simple change,
but Cooper hopes it will simplify the sys
tem and alleviate some of the confusion
surrounding board bills on the Row.
"The mvths that swirl around out

there cause some students
to choose not to live on the
Row," the aid director
said. "There's this percep
tion that the Row is for
rich kids, and as the finan
cial aid director, that's not
what we're looking for here
at Stanford. We want all of
the housing options to be
available to every student."
