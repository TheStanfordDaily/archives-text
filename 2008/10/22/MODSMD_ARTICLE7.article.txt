## SENATOR DRAWS ON HIS EXPERIENCE TO SHOW HE CAN HANDLE CRISES AS PRESIDENT McCain claims to be tested in crisis 
### GLEN JOHNSON THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Republican John McCain told voters in
this key electoral state Tuesday he was per
sonally tested by the same kind of crisis
that Democratic vice presidential nominee
Joseph Biden warned Barack Obania will
almost certainly face if elected president.
McCain recalled being ready to launch
a bombing run during the October 1%2
Cuban Missile Crisis, which Biden said
over the weekend tested a new President
John F. Kennedy and was the template for
the kind of "generated crisis" the 47-year
old Obania would face within six months of
taking office.
"I was on board the USS Enterprise,"
McCain, a former naval aviator, said in the
capital city of Harrisburg.'T sat in the cock
pit. on the flight deck of the USS Enter
prise, off of Cuba. 1 had a target. My friends,
you know how close we came to a nuclear
war."
As the crowd of several thousand began
to swell with cheers and applause, he added
with dramatic effect: "America will not
have a president who needs to be tested.
I've been tested, my friends."
Biden told two fundraising audiences in
Seattle over the weekend that he expected
world figures to test Obama early if he wins
the election in two weeks.
"He's gonna need you — not financial
ly to help him — we're gonna need you to
use your influence, your influence within
the community, to stand with him," Biden
said.
Biden predicted Obama would fare well
because he's "got steel in his spine." In cit
ing the Cuban Missile Crisis, though, he
evoked a historic event in which McCain
played a part.
"The Enterprise, sailing at full speed
under nuclear power, was the first U.S. car
rier to reach waters off Cuba," McCain
wrote in his memoir."Faith of My Fathers."
"For about five days, the pilots on the En
terprise believed we were going into ac
tion. We had never been in combat before,
and despite the global confrontation a
strike on Cuba portended, we were pre
pared and anxious to fly our first mission."
He added: "Pilots and crewmen alike
adopted a cool-headed, business-as-usual
attitude toward the mission. Inwardly, of
course, we were excited as hell, but we kept
our composure and aped the standard
image of a laconic, reserved, and fearless
American at war."

McCain spent all day Tuesday in Demo
cratic-leaning Pennsylvania, worth 21
Electoral College votes, before heading
Wednesday into New Hampshire, a for
merly reliable GOP state which Obama
has made competitive this year. Though it
has only four of the 270 electoral votes
needed to win the presidency, New Hamp
shire could swing the election under some

voting models which predict a very close
Electoral College split.
The 72-year-old McCain regularly ques
tions whether Obama — a first-term sena
tor — has the experience to he president.
He also questions whether the Illinois De
mocrat has the character to stand up to his
own party and to stick with his core philo
sophical views.

In a region experiencing World Series
fever. McCain underscored his argument
by noting Obama had expressed support
for both teams playing in the upcoming
baseball championship.
Standing just miles north of Philadel
phia, whose Phillies will represent the Na
tional League starting Wednesday against
the American League champion Tampa
Bay Rays, McCain noted Obama has iden
tified himself with both teams while cam
paigning in their two politically important
home states.
Obama said over the weekend in
Philadelphia that while he was a Chicago
fan, "Since the White Sox are out of it. I'll
root for the Phillies now." On Monday in
Tampa, Obama was introduced by a Rays
pitcher and said,"l've said from the begin
ning that I am a unity candidate, bringing
people together. So when you see a White
Sox Fan showing love to the Rays — and
the Rays showing some love back — you
know we are on to something right here."
McCain told employees at TCI Mill
work Inc. in Bensalem: "Now, I'm not
dumb enough to get mixed up in a World
Series between swing states. But I think I
may have detected a little pattern with Sen.
Obama. It's pretty simple really. When he's
campaigning in Philadelphia, he roots for
the Phillies, and when he's campaigning in
Tampa Bay, he 'shows love' to the Rays."
As boos echoed through a cavernous
warehouse, he added:"lt's kind of like the
way he campaigns on tax cuts, but then
votes for tax increases after he's elected."
McCain ended his day with a rally at
Robert Morris University in Moon Town
ship. just outside Pittsburgh. He tried to
criticize Obama for saying in April that
working class Pennsylvanians "cling" to
guns and religion when their economic
fears rise and Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., for
saying last week that some of his Western
Pennsylvania constituents are racist. But
McCain drew mostly silence as he fumbled
the remarks several times before getting
his point right.
"Sen. Obama's supporters have been
saying some pretty nasty things about
Western Pennsylvania lately. And you
know 1 couldn't agree with them more. 1
couldn't disagree with you. I couldn't agree
with you more than the fact that Western
Pennsylvania is the most patriotic, most
god-loving, most patriotic part of America.
This is a great part of the country. My
friends. I could not disagree with those crit
ics more," McCain said.
