# Federal government moving to help break credit logjam
## The 						Fed and Treasury take more action on crisis 
### MARTIN CRUTSINGER THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
First, it was the banks. Now the Federal
Reserve has come to the aid of money
market funds as the government seeks to
break the credit logjam that threatens the
global economy.
A week after the government an
nounced it would spend $250 billion to buy
stakes in U.S. banks, the Fed stepped up
Tuesday to help money market funds that
have been squeezed by worried investors
demanding to cash out their holdings.
Meanwhile, the Treasury named two ac
counting firms to help manage the $700
billion bailout package.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said
Tuesday night that the government would
do whatever it takes to deal with the cred
it crisis but he cautioned that economic
troubles caused by the crisis are likely to
persist "for a number of months."
"Through a multitude of powerful ac
tions we have and will demonstrate our
commitment to unlocking our credit mar

kcts and minimizing the impact of the cur
rent instability on the rest of the U.S. econ
omy," Paulson told a New York audience.
The government is trying to combat the
worst credit crisis in seven decades, an up
heaval that has destabilized Wall Street
and raised fears that the country could
tumble into a deep recession.
The Fed said it would provide up to
$540 billion in financing to money market
mutual funds in a new program called the
Money Market Investor F r unding Facility.
"The government is doing everything it
can to break the logjam,"said Mark Zandi,
chief economist at Moody's
Economy.com. "If these money markets
are not working properly, then the econo
my is significantly threatened because this
is where businesses get their short-term fi
nancing for their day-to-day operations."
JPMorgan Chase & Co. was chosen to
run five special funds that will buy from
money market mutual funds certificates of
deposit, bank notes and commercial
paper, which is short-term debt companies
issue to raise money for payroll or sup
plies.
