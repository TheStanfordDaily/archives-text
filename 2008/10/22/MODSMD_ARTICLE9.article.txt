# A 						NEW ERA IN ASIAN SPACE EXPLORATION
## India launches its first mission to the moon 
### GAVIN RABINOWITZ SETH BORENSTEIN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Scientists have better maps of distant
Mars than the moon where astronauts
have walked. But India hopes to change
that with its first lunar mission.
Chandrayaan-1 —which means
"Moon Craft" in ancient Sanskrit —
launched from the Sriharikota space cen
ter in southern India early Wednesday
morning in a two-year mission aimed at
laying the groundwork for further Indian
space expeditions.
Chief among the mission's goals is
mapping not only the surface of the
moon, but what lies beneath. India joined
what's shaping up as a 21st century space
race with Chinese and Japanese crafts al
ready in orbit around the moon.
The United States, which won the
1960s race to send men to the moon,
won't jump in this race with its new lunar
probe until next spring, but it is providing
key mapping equipment for India's mis
sion.
As India's economy has boomed in re
cent years, it has sought to convert its new
found wealth — built on its high-tech sec
tor — into political and military clout and

stake a claim as a world leader. It is hop
ing that a moon mission—coming just
months after it finalized a deal with the
United States that recognizes India as a
nuclear power — will further enhance
that status.
"It is a remarkable technological
achievement for the country," said S.
Satish.a spokesman for the Indian Space
Research Organization, which plans to
use the 3,0X0-pound lunar probe to create
a high-resolution map of the lunar surface
and what minerals are below. Two of the
mapping instruments are a joint project
with NASA.
Until now. India's space launches have
been more practical, with weather warn
ing satellites and communication systems,
said former NASA associate administra
tor Scott Pace, director of space policy at
the George Washington University.
To date only the U.S.. Russia, the Eu
ropean Space Agency. Japan and China
have sent missions to the moon.
While much of the technology in
volved in reaching the moon has not
changed since the Soviet Union and the
U.S. did it more than 4 decades ago, ana
lysts say current mapping equipment al
lows the exploration of new areas, includ
ing below the surface.
