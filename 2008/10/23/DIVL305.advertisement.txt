You are talented and driven. You know you have a bright future ahead of you.
You seem to have it all figured out except what you are going to do with all of
your ability when you graduate. If you are like so many other students, you don't
realize that you can pursue a career in management whether you studied
accounting and marketing or anthropology and modern literature.
McMaster-Carr employs an imaginative approach to developing
management talent. Assignments in areas such as market research, finance,
or distribution will give you valuable insight into how our company operates out
of multiple locations. Working on centralized teams like purchasing, software
development, and catalog design will give you exposure to the many other ways
we utilize our talent. No matter where you start, you will learn about our unique
business from the inside out. With demonstrated knowledge and achievement,
you will be challenged to manage people, processes, and projects. At
McMaster-Carr, advancement is directed not by your undergraduate major or
tenure, but rather by your ability to challenge and improve our business
practices.
