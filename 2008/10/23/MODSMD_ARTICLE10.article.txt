## Editorial Quarter system a right choice for law school 
### 
The editorial board supports the change
in Stanford Law School's calendar
from semesters to quarters (see today's
Daily article "Law school plans switch to
quarter system"). We supported Dean Larry
Kramer's original proposal for the change in
2(X)5, and we are glad that the law school has
ultimately decided to make the switch.
The main benefit of changing to the quar
ter system is that it will align the law school's
calendar with the rest of the University, al
lowing students to take more interdiscipli
nary classes. Because the law school academ
ic year currently ends in May, it is impossible
for law students to take classes in other
schools or departments during spring quar
ter. The change could also lead to more stu
dents from other parts of the University
being able to take classes at the law school.
This flexibility is increasingly important in
the legal profession. Many areas of law have
become so specialized that lawyers must de
velop expertise beyond the traditional law
school curriculum. Stanford Law School has
adapted to these changes by encouraging
students to propose virtually any joint-de
gree program, and establishing auricular
guidelines for the most popular joint degrees.
Switching to the quarter system will be espe
cially helpful for joint-degree students, al
lowing them to complete their requirements
more efficiently. However, even those who
are not pursuing a joint degree will gain mar
ketable interdisciplinary skills by taking out
side classes.
The new calendar will also lead to in
creased participation in the Mills Legal Clin
ic, which currently offers nine clinical cours
es that students can apply to take starting
their second year. Under the semester sys
tem, students only have four chances to en
roll in a clinic, and must balance their clinical

work with regular classes. Once the transi
tion to the quarter system is complete, stu
dents will have six chances to apply, and will
be able focus all of their attention on the clin
ic for that quarter.
When the switch to the quarter system
was first proposed, it was met with several
criticisms. We believe that these criticisms
have now been addressed, and ultimately are
outweighed by the pedagogical benefits of
the change.
Many professors expressed concern that
they would not be able to fit all of the mate
rial for a course into only 10 weeks. In the
years leading up to the change, however,
many professors have voluntarily switched
classes to the quarter system with no decline
in the quality of instruction. The biggest con
cern — the length of the first-year curricu
lum — has been resolved by designing an
extended fall quarter for first-year students.
Many students have also complained that
the new calendar will put them at a disad
vantage for summer jobs and the bar exam.
We believe that Stanford students will re
main competitive in the job market no mat
ter what, and current schedules for summer
jobs vary so widely that it is doubtful the new
calendar will have a serious impact. The law
school has also already made arrangements
to help students prepare for the most com
monly taken bar exams, California and New
York.
We ultimately applaud the decision of
Stanford Law School to adopt a calendar
that is best for the quality of its legal educa
tion, rather than bow to administrative con
cerns or an obsession with law school rank
ings. The editorial board is pleased to see
Stanford make the right decision for its stu
dents, rather than cater to a standard set by
other schools.
