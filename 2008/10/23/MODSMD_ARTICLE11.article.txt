## The 						economics of foreign oil 
### 
In this contentious election, one of the few
things that both presidential candidates
agree on is the profligate expenditure by
Americans on foreign oil.
"We have to stop sending $7(X) billion a
year to countries that don't like us very
much," Republican candidate John McCain
said in the final presidential debate. Democ
rat Barack Obama concurred at a recent rally
in Wisconsin.claiming that a push for alterna
tive energy "will stop us from sending $700
billion a year to tyrants and dictators for oil."
Both McCain and Obama claim that
Americans spend $700 billion — the equiva
lent of the Treasury bailout plan — a year on
oil imports from countries that are not Amer
ican allies.
Like so many of their ads, these claims reg
ister "false" on the political Truth-O-Meter.
According to government agencies that
track energy imports, the U.S spent $246 bil
lion on imported crude oil in 2007. While en
ergy prices have been significantly higher in
2008, the US. has spent $284 billion on crude
oil from January through July, equivalent to
an annual expenditure of $486 billion and far
from the claimed $7(X) billion.
With crude oil prices dropping dramatical
ly in the past month, annual expenditure for
2008 is likely to be closer to $4(X) billion than
$486 billion.
So where did the candidates get their $7(X)
billion figure? It seems as though McCain
and Obama — or, most likely, their aides —
took the number of barrels of crude oil im
ported by the U.S. each year (4.8 billion bar
rels) and multiplied it by the peak price of
crude oil, $145 a barrel.The result is $6% bil
lion — we can forgive the senators for round
ing up.
It is clearly unreasonable to take the high
est price ever for a barrel of crude oil as a
benchmark for annual expenditure. It's just
flat-out wrong. In reality, most U.S. imported
oil is cheaper than the West Texas variety
traded on the New York Mercantile Ex
change (NYMEX) and quoted as a headline
price for oil. Even when oil was in the $140
territory, U.S. firms were paying prices that
were in the $115 to $120 range.
It doesn't take a rocket scientist, or even a
middle-schooler, to work out that not spend
ing $7(X) billionn on oil imports means that we
couldn't possibly be sending that much to
"countries that don't like America."
The US. imports 16 percent of its oil from
the supposedly unfriendly Middle East and
10 percent of its oil from the blatantly un
friendly Venezuela. Meanwhile, the two
largest exporters to the U.S. are Canada —
pretty much the friendliest nation on Earth

— and Mexico, with a combined total of over
30 percent of our oil imports.
With the correct numbers in place, a quick
calculation reveals that the US. sends no
more than $ 1 (K) billion in oil revenues to
"tyrants and dictators."
But even this analysis is too forgiving to
the presidential candidates. A closer look at
U.S. oil imports reveals that, within the Mid
dle East, the largest exporters to the U.S. are
Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Kuwait. The only dic
tatorship on that list is Saudi Arabia: Kuwait
has parliamentary elections, while Iraq is now
a full-fledged democracy. Venezuela is the
other dictatorship among the top-10 oil ex
porters to the U.S. leaving only $80 billion
transferred to so-called "tyrants and dicta
tors."
That's close to the amount Americans
spend on soft drinks every year, and a far cry
from $7(X) billion. Perhaps the presidential
candidates should be directing their ire to
wards the carbonated beverage barons.
The truth is that it doesn't matter who
America buys oil from. What matters is the
total supply of oil on the market. In the short
run. this total is fixed. If America stops buying
oil from Venezuela, it just means that another
oil importer will purchase the oil instead.
Crude oil just gets geographically displaced.
In fact, such a strategy would probably
raise the price of imported oil since it costs far
less to get oil from Venezuela than from, say,
Nigeria. These higher transportation costs
would eventually be passed on to American
consumers — a cataclysmic outcome in the
current economic climate.
It is noble of both presidential candidates
to aim to reduce American dependence on
fossil fuels. But the arguments for reducing
this dependence should not be predicated on
xenophobia.They should instead point to the
significant environmental benefits that will
lead to better standards of living for future
generations. That, I am sure, is another thing
that both Senators McCain and Obama can
agree upon.
