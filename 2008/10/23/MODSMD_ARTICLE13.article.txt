# This Stanford Life
## Stanford. The anti-rock. 
### 
Stanford's high rankings are a source of
perpetual pride, hut in one respect, we
are woefully underperforming. Accord
ing to "Schools That Rock: The Rolling Stone
College Guide," Stanford is not very rocking.
The guide, which strives to be the "U.S. News
and World Report" rankings of college music
scenes, is dead on. As any Stanford student
can attest to, we just don't rock.
Stanford, of course, has an excellent music
department and classic music scene.The cam
pus is bursting at the seams with virtuoso
piano players and violinists. Wait around in
any dorm lounge and some amazing pianist
will eventually stride in, take a seat and da/./Je
you. But wait around for a talented rock band
to set up their gear, and you will never stop
waiting.
Stanford does have a few good, fun rock
bands. They come out for parties. Full Moon
on the Quad and Exotic Erotic. But you can
count these acts on one hand, and most of
them come and go easily. They are isolated
cases and do not constitute a cohesive campus
music scene.
Why can Stanford not get any rock and roll
traction? It is tempting to blame our geo
graphic location. Palo Alto is among the least
rocking cities ever. If anything, it is the sort of
sleepy suburb that rock bands lice and later
write about with angst and anger. The best
rock band to come out of Palo Alto — the
Grateful Dead — moved up to San Francisco
soon after forming.
Bands that encounter Palo Alto usually
hate it. In 1994, for instance, Radiohead
played a show in Palo Alto much to their cha
grin. Afterwards. Thorn Yorke wrote a song
called "Palo Alto." (Fun fact: The song was
originally called "OK Computer." They used
that name for something else, however.) In
this distorted rocker, Yorke sarcastically
growls,"ln a city of the future/It is difficult to
concentrate/Meet the boss, meet the
wife/Everybody's happy/Everyone is made

for life."
So, our Palo Alto location does not help us
rock out — but being only 40 minutes from
San Francisco certainly does. Indeed, a city
with arguably the best rock tradition ever —
it was the world capitol of rock from about
I%X to the early 1970's — is a short car ride
away. Still, Stanford remains untouched by
San Francisco's experimental and bohemian
vibe. Ibe answer, then, is not geography; it is
Stanford itself.
Stanford's core values are contrary to the
goals of rock music. Rock is viewed as neither
a constructive nor prestigious enough use of
our limited time. Time is a Stanford student's
most precious resource; we each have only
four years to take advantage of a million op
portunities. Schoolwork, social life, exercise
and saving the world from various threats —
these undertakings demand serious commit
ment. Few of us can find the space in our
Blackberrys, planners or Google Calendars
for band practice.
More importantly, however, Stanford val
ues a eertain brand of success, which demands
working within and eventually mastering the

systems that rule our lives. We all got into
Stanford by mastering the educational system
known as high school. Now, we succeed at
Stanford by mastering the systems of depart
ments and student groups. After Stanford, we
will succeed by mastering the systems of busi
ness, science and academia.
Rock music, however, is fundamentally
about overturning systems, or at least work
ing outside of the system. From its inception
in the '50s, rock gave little credence to social
norms, parental expectations or conventional
music practices. Rock, by nature, fought the
system.
As a result of our need for conventional
success, our collective creativity is channeled
into "more productive" ventures than rock.
We channel creativity into reinforcing the sys
tem, making a business, academic discipline
or computer coding better, faster, and
stronger.
So, sadly there is little hope for the future
of Stanford's rock scene. All colleges have
bands on campus. It's a rite of passage for
teenagers to get their first guitar and the ac
companying dreams of rock stardom. Student
rock groups will shuffle through the Stanford
nightlife for as long as rock is popular.
And rock — like our Rolling Stone as
sessment — isn't going anywhere.
