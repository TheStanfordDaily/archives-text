### CLAUDIA PRECIADO 
The No. 2 Stanford men's water polo team shot out of
the gate strong against No. 17 Pacific in an explosive 10-4
match last night at Avery Aquatic Center, keeping the
Cardinal in the running for an NCAA championship.
Stanford continued its season-long run of dominance
over the Tigers, and is now 3-0 against Pacific this year.
Hie Cardinal (16-2,2-0 Mountain Pacific Sports Federa
tion) extended its winning streak to three games, while
Pacific (10-13,0-2) dropped down a notch in the MPSF
standings.
Senior Will Hindle-Katel led the offensive attack as he
once more demonstrated his prowess in the pool. With
shots in the first, second, and fourth quarters. Hindle-
Katel consistently penetrated Pacific's defense through
out the entire match. Stanford's powerhouse offense con
tinuously delivered unanswered goals, romping out to a
one-sided victory over Pacific.
"We approach every game we play with consistency
regardless of our opponent." sophomore Jeffrey Schwim
mer said of matching up against a team the Cardinal had
so thoroughly dominated this season."Our main goal is to
compete at the highest level possible at all times."

ITie Cardinal built up an early lead in the first period
that set the momentum for the remainder of the game.
Junior driver Janson Wigo made an early impression
against the Tigers a minute into the match with a 1 -0 lead.
Teammates Hindle-Katel.Schwimmer,and redshirt sen
ior Andrew Drake broke through Pacific's defensive
wall as well for scores. A dose of retaliation from the
Tigers came in the shape of senior William Milcovich as
he closed in on Stanford defense two minutes into the pe
riod, making it 4-1.
"I'd say [Pacific] playfs] a very conservative.slow style
of play on offense in order to limit mistakes and thus re
duce our defense to counterattack," Schwimmer said.
"We have a much more dynamic offense which doesn't
rely on any one person, but rather we are a scoring threat
from every position at any given time."
Stanford's aggressive defense catapulted its offense
into a scoring frenzy once more in the second quartenthis
time with Hindle-Katel and Drake firing in one goal each,
boosting the advantage to 6-1. However, junior Joey
Rossi of Pacific launched a shot off the post to decrease
Stanford's lead to four points with two minutes left in the
half.The Cardinal took over yet again though, with a blast
by Drake in the last 58 seconds of the quarter, closing the
half at 7-2.
Redshirt junior goalkeeper Jimmie Sandman led the
defense with four saves at the half, and was notably assist
ed by freshmen Peter Sefton and the Cardinal defense,
which blocked and caved in on Pacific's offensive drive.
"We are only able to have such a dynamic offense be
cause of our superior defense backed by Jimmie [Sand
man | in the cage," Schwimmer said.
Stanford's defense and overall strength in the pool
comes from "maintaining control of the game the whole
time, not having any defensive slip ups, and not allowing
the other team to get a cheap goal," Sandman added.
A solid defense allows players like Hindle-Katel. the
Wigo brothers and senior driver Andrew Drake to focus
on the task at hand: scoring.
