## Stanford fries for win away from Pac-10 
### JACOB JOHNSON DESK EDITOR 
The total number of goals the
Stanford men's soccer team has al
lowed in the past eight games: nine.
The number of wins the Cardi
nal has in that same stretch: one.
If this sounds like a broken
record — for those who have fol
lowed the Daily's soccer coverage
this year, it surely must — that's be
cause it is the story of the season for
the men's soccer program. More
like a recurring nightmare than a
story, actually: tough defense, great
team chemistry and a lot of close
f;ames that end up as tallies in the
oss column.
The offense can't seem to score.
Yes, that is the most important part
of the game. But over the last eight
contests, Stanford has created nu

merous scoring chances: the Cardi
nal has out-shot its opponents by
1.5 attempts per game, and its shots
on goal are almost equal to the
competition. The Cardinal is 1-6-1
over that stretch.The stats say they
should be about .500.
Injuries are partially to blame
for Stanford's struggles. Redshirt
junior Alex Kozachenko and red
shirt senior Evan Morgan have
been sidelined all season, and sen
ior captain TJ Novak suffered a
hamstring injury against Drake on
Sept. 21 and has yet to return. De
spite the loss of key personnel.
Coach Bret Simon and his players
refuse to claim injuries as an ex
cuse.
"Everyone has injuries," Simon
said, referring to Stanford's oppo
nents.

GAME NOTES: Stanford travels to New Mex
ico during its Pac-10 bye week. The Car
dinal is coming off a 1-0 loss to No. 9
California, where it again played great
defense but could not find the net. Stan
ford is going to have to start winning
games if it wants to make the NCAA Tour
nament field.
from injury have acted as extra
coaches in practice and have been
instrumental in the development of
the younger players. Novak was ini
tially told he could be out for the
season, but further testing showed
that the damage to his hamstring
was less severe than expected. But
hamstring injuries can be unpre
dictable and are often slow to heal.
"We don't expect him back for
this weekend," Simon said. "He's
stuck at the point where he can jog,
[but] his hamstring won't cooper
ate."
He is still able to participate in
most of the team's drills and "get his
touches." But the in jury has prevent
ed him from going at full-speed
when his teammates are preparing
for games.
That doesn't mean he sits idly or
hit's the showers early, though. After
participating in team drills he "be
comes a coach" and helps out how
ever he can — even if that mean's
picking up a new position.
"TJ even got in goal one practice.
We needed an extra keeper and he
volunteered." Simon said with a
laugh. "He was actually pretty
good."
Next up for the Cardinal is a
quick road trip to Albuquerque to
take on New Mexico. The game will
be on Friday at 6 p.m. PT and it is the
first of three consecutive road
games.
The Stanford men know that the
next few contests will be very impor
tant. They must win-out to make the
NCAA tournament and they need
to prove that they can win on the
road.
New Mexico is 6-5-2 on the sea
son. The Lobos are strong offensive
ly. averaging more than 1.5 goals per
game. They have taken almost 200
shots this year, compared to just 146
for the Cardinal. But they have also
given up 1.23 scores per game while
the Cardinal is allowing just one. Fri
day's match-up will be a classic bat
tle of stingy defense and struggling
offense against a team with the op
posite strengths.
"New Mexico will be a difficult
team." Simon said. "They do score
goals in hunches and they put pres
sure on opposing defenses."
Simon and his coaching staff
have actually been stressing defense
in practice this week. With so much
emphasis on improving the offense
this season, they don't want the play
ers to get complacent against an ag
gressive New Mexico attack. Simon
also wants his players to focus on the
positive: they have played well this
year.and solid play eventually yields

good results.
"We need to make sure we recog
nize how well our defense has
played and celebrate that." he said.
Stanford can still make the
NCAA tournament. It would he an
improbable run, but it is certainly

possible for a team that has been
truly overmatched only once this
season.
"There's a number of things we
[still] want to accomplish," Simon
said.
Apparently, the Stanford men's

soccer team has taken a certain Jim
Carrey line from "Dumb and
Dumber" to heart — they're saying
there's a chance.
