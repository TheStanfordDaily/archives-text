## Stanford fries for win away from Pac-10 
### JACOB JOHNSON DESK EDITOR 
The total number of goals the
Stanford men's soccer team has al
lowed in the past eight games: nine.
The number of wins the Cardi
nal has in that same stretch: one.
If this sounds like a broken
record — for those who have fol
lowed the Daily's soccer coverage
this year, it surely must — that's be
cause it is the story of the season for
the men's soccer program. More
like a recurring nightmare than a
story, actually: tough defense, great
team chemistry and a lot of close
f;ames that end up as tallies in the

The offense can't seem to score.
Yes, that is the most important part
of the game. But over the last eight
contests, Stanford has created nu

nal has out-shot its opponents by
1.5 attempts per game, and its shots
on goal are almost equal to the
competition. The Cardinal is 1-6-1
over that stretch.The stats say they
should be about .500.
Injuries are partially to blame
for Stanford's struggles. Redshirt
junior Alex Kozachenko and red
shirt senior Evan Morgan have
been sidelined all season, and sen
ior captain TJ Novak suffered a
hamstring injury against Drake on
Sept. 21 and has yet to return. De

Coach Bret Simon and his players
refuse to claim injuries as an ex
cuse.
"Everyone has injuries," Simon
said, referring to Stanford's oppo
nents.
