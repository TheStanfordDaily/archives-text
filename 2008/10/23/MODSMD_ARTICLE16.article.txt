### JOSH ALVAREZ 
The Cardinal repeated history
on Tuesday at the Intercollegiate
Tennis Association Northern Cal
Regional Championships. Stan
ford swept into the singles final
for the second year in a row with
No. 4 sophomore Alex Clayton
(seeded No. I in the tournament)
taking on his teammate, freshman
Bradley Klahn (N0.9) in the finals
at the Taube Family Tennis Cen
ter. Clayton took the crown 6-3,3-
6,6-2, for the first tournament win
of his collegiate career.
Clayton and Klahn. interest
ingly, were also doubles team
mates at the tournament.The fifth
seeded duo made it all the way to
the semifinals before falling to

UC Berkeley's Geoff Chizever
and Pedro Zerbini, 8-4. Zerbini
and Chizever went on to defeat
Washington's top-seeded Jeevan
Nedunchzhyn and Patrik Fischer,
8-5 in the doubles championship
match.
As a doubles team, Clayton
and Klahn went 1-1 against Cal,
defeating Kallim Stewart and Thai
Tu 8-3 in the quarterfinals.
Last year's singles champion,
Stanford junior Richard Wire, fell
to Fresno State's second seeded
Rudolph Siwy in the quarterfi
nals. Klahn exacted revenge for
his teammate, though, defeating
Siwy in the semifinals 6-3,4-6,6-4.
In order to reach the singles semifinals, Clay
ton and Klahn had to overcome Cal's Jonathan
Dahan and Pedro Zerbini, respectively. They did
so in convincing fashion by winning in two sets in
their respective matches. Dahan fell to Clayton 6-
2,7-5 and Zerbini fell to Klahn 6-4,6-1.
But not all was rosey for the Cardinal, as three
Stanford doubles teams were eliminated in the
round of 32 alone.
"Overall my reaction to the tournament was
very positive." head coach John Whitlinger said.
"I was very pleased with individual play. As for
the doubles teams we have some work to do. It's
really all in finding the right combinations of
players."
"This was Alex's first collegiate tournament
win, so I'm very proud of him." the Stanford
coach continued.
Clayton's championship win gives him auto
matic entry to the exclusive ITA National Indoor
Championships Nov. 6-9 in Charlottesville, Va.
"It's great to have a Stanford representative in
the [ITA National Indoor Championships],"
Whitlinger said. "It's a national event. I'm excit
ed to see him play. [Clayton] is looking forward to
playing and is excited."
Last year, Clayton's strong performance in the
All-American Championships (in which he fell
in the quarterfinals to the eventual champion)
landed him a wild card spot in the Indoor Cham
pionships. Clayton made it all the way to the
semi-finals before losing to the eventual champi
on, Somdev Devvarmen of Virginia.
Klahn's strong performance as a freshman
brought back memories of Clayton's freshman
year. Clayton entered last season No. 111, but im
mediately established himself as one of the top
players in the country.
"Bradley is one of the best freshmen in the
country," Whitlinger said. "[He] played very well
[in the tournament]. He was composed â€” [it
was] nip and tuck all the way. He played a very
good, tough tennis match against Alex. It's not
easy to face a teammate for either of them. But
I'm very pleased with how they played and the
sportsmanship they displayed."
[Klahn] is going to get better as the competi
tions and practices go by, but really it's the goal to
have everybody on the team improve." he said.
The Cardinal's next competition will be at the
St. Mary's Gael Classic, from Oct. 31 through
Nov. 2 in Moraga, Calif.
