# Canseco made a mistake
## 
### 
What more could you ask
from these playoffs? ITie
regular-season champions
of each league were knocked off in
the first round by teams that weren't
supposed to be here. Boston provid
ed one of the most miraculous come
from-behind victories in postseason
history. Tampa Bay — a preseason
200-to-l underdog to make the
World Series — finished just one
run shy of the Phillies in Game I last
night.
Tempers have flared, benches
have cleared and there has been no
shortage of game-changing homers,
errors, strikeouts and defensive
gems. And every indication is that
what little remains of the 2008 sea
son should be just as fantastic.
At least the part that actually in
volves the teams competing for a
World Series title should be. The
other baseball news making the
headlines is about as nauseating as it
can get for a fan of this wonderful
game.
During a recently televised inter
view in an A&E program titled "Jose
Canseco, the Last Shot." Canseco re
vealed that, in his opinion, the
biggest mistake he has made in his
baseball career was, surprisingly, not
that he took performance enhancing
drugs and lied about it.
No. he said his biggest mistake
was writing his expose of steroids in
baseball, called "Juiced."
You see, Mr. Canseco has appar
ently realized after writing and pub
licizing the book, after giving count
less interviews discussing other play
ers' use of steroids, and after collect
ing every last cent he could (and
quickly blowing it all) from "naming
the names" of the biggest drug users
in his former profession, that reveal
ing them as such might damage their
reputations and careers.
What on Earth did he think
would happen? At a time when the
League was burying him. he decided
to "get back at baseball" — and
make a few bucks—by listing
everyone else who did what he did,
and he didn't think that would have
consequences? He didn't think an
nouncing that Mark McGwire,
Rafael Palmeiro and Sammy Sosa
all did steroids would tarnish their
images?
Come on Jose, you didn't need to
be brilliant to figure this out: the
path from your actions to their con
sequences is as straight and clear as
the baselines themselves.
And. if he now regrets what he
wrote in "Juiced." why did he write a
sequel with more names earlier this
year? As recently as April he was
touring to promote "Vindicated."
McGwire, Palmeiro and the oth
ers in "Juiced" were thrown into the
spotlight several years ago. long be
fore "Vindicated" was written, so
why write another expose if he
claims his biggest mistake was writ
ing the first?
No, I simply can't accept that he
has suddenly just now realized that
writing his book was the wrong
choice. In the opinion of many base
ball fans, he wrote it for attention, to
feel important, and to make money.
And 1 agree completely: four years
ago. I was disgusted by him for writ
ing the book.and today lam disgust
ed he is publicly announcing his re
gret ... after publishing the sequel.
Don't get me wrong. I am glad
that he has called attention to the
steroid problem in baseball and
helped to get the sport on the path to
recovery. But it is appalling that he
did so in a way calculated to bring
him renewed celebrity and wealth.
And he certainly has much more im
portant things to do than wasting the
public's time by grabbing the head
lines with absurd messages of regret.
Canseco is still battling with drug
dependency from his prolonged
steroid use, and the mistake of tak
ing the drugs in the first place is what
he should be regretting and working
to repair. And. if he sincerely does
want to help cleanup the game, he
should call attention to the devastat
ing effects the drugs have had on his
life to prevent younger players from
following the same path.
But for now, Mr. Canseco, the
public is sick of you and rightly so.
