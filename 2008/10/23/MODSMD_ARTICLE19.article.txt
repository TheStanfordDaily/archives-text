# FIELD HOCKEY
## Women set to face California 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA STAFF WRITER 
The next competition for the Stanford women's field
hockey team is not just any match — no, it is the game
of the season: a matchup against archrival UC Berke
ley. Not only do the Cardinal women face the pressure
of competing against Stanford's chief nemesis, hut also
the daunting task of squaring off against the current
league leader as the Bears bring a 5-0 record in the
Northern Pacific Conference into the match.
California's season has been perfect thus far as the
Bears have won every one of their conference games.
They have outscored their opponents 48-15. Indeed,
Cal has just two matches left within the conference,
both against Stanford.The Cardinal women will be out
to break the Bears' conference win-streak, helping
themselves and the rest of the conference in one fell
swoop, while also taking a big step towards asserting
their dominance within the Bay Area. Stanford faces
California on Friday at 1:30 pm in Berkeley.
After facing its archrivals, the Cardinal will play Pa
cific on Sunday in Stockton. Calif. Not too long ago. Pa
cific was mired in the midst of a six game losing streak,
but has rebounded of late, winning four matches in a
row. The Stanford game will be Pacific's final match of
the season.
Stanford defeated Pacific earlier in the year by the
score of 7-0. thanks to junior Midori Uehara's spectac
ular hat trick.
With just two weeks and three more games left in the
regular season, the Stanford women will have to secure
wins in order to move up from its current fourth place
standing in the league. In the rankings. California is fol
lowed by Pacific and Radford, with Longwood and
Stanford in a tie for fourth. Stanford has already suf
fered losses to Radford and Longwood. and will need to
draw upon all the skill and prowess on its roster to
make a comeback in the conference.The NorPac Tour
nament is scheduled for Nov. 6-8 in Farmville. Va.
But not all is grim in the outlook
for the Cardinal. The Stanford
women have definitely made a sec
ond half surge. Facing an incredibly
difficult slate of games at the begin
ning of the season, the team lost sev
eral early matches. Stanford,
though, has won its past two games
against conference opponents, and
looks forward to bringing the same
energy and determination to the up
coming matches.
The Cardinal women have
scored 27 goals on the season,
outscoring opponents 16-7 in the
second half. Stanford has a 90-71
shot attempt over their opponents,
while also leading opponents 61-37
in penalty corners in the final 35
minutes.
Stanford owes a lot of its success
and ability to bounce back to head

coach Lesley Irvine. A graduate of
lowa in 2001, Irvine is in her sixth
year of coaching at Stanford, with an
overall record of 47-66. After a
memorable and successful season in
2007, Irvine helped Stanford estab
lish itself as a rising field-hockey
program in the west. The 2007 sea
son ended with a NorPac Tourna
ment championship, as well as All-
American honors for Jess Zutz '08
and sophomores Camille Gandhi
and Xanthe Travlos. Zutz was also
awarded 2007 NorPac Offensive
Player of the Year. Irvine was hon
ored alongside her players with the
NorPac Coach of the Year award,
having guided Stanford into the na
tional rankings for the first time
since 2001.
With Irvine's relentless support
and drive, the Cardinal women will
look to find the strength to end the
season on a high note: another Nor-
Pac Tournament Championship.
