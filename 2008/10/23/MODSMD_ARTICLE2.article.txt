Despite rumors to the contrary. Stanford Law
School (SLS) will indeed transition from the semes
ter system to the quarter system next year.
SLS Dean Larry Kramer said the decision to con
vert to the quarter system stemmed from a desire to
better integrate the law school with rest of the
University as a whole.
"The chief impetus behind the move was to facili
tate interdisciplinary opportunities for law students
and make it easier for non-law students to take
appropriate classes at the law school," Kramer said.
"This integration is. in turn, a response to changes
in the legal profession." he added. "All the fields in
which lawyers work have grown more interdiscipli
nary and specialized. Lawyers must understand the
business of their clients and the substance on which
the law operates, as well as being able to work collab
oratively with others who have different training."
The change was first considered during the 2004-
2005 academic year, when the law faculty created a
student liaison committee and conducted research to
ascertain student reactions to the idea.
According to the surveys, students were comfort
able with the change. After the fifth faculty meeting
held in November 2005, faculty members voted to
switch to the quarter system at the beginning of the
2009-2010 academic year.
In anticipation of the adjustment in the academic
calendar, the law school made modifications to the cal
endar for the three academic years of 2006-2009.
allowing students to take classes offered in the fall and
winter quarters of the University's academic calendar.
The law school also made changes to its curricu
lum. establishing interdisciplinary courses and joint
degree programs that can be completed concurrently
with the J.D.
However, not all students at the law school wel
come the change.
"The professors are not used to teaching on the
quarter yet," said Blake Bailey, a third-year law stu
dent. "The one course I took on the quarter was much
more challenging due to the compacted schedule."
"My general sense is that students prefer the
semester system," Bailey added. "Whether this pref
erence is due to inertia or an honest comparative
analysis is unclear."
Once the quarter system is fully implemented at
the law school, the academic year will begin near the
middle of September and end near the middle of
June. In comparison, Harvard Law School will finish
