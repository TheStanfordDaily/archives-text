## Law school plans switch to quarter system Change integrates school with calendar of rest of University 
### AMANDA ZHANG 
Despite rumors to the contrary. Stanford Law
School (SLS) will indeed transition from the semes
ter system to the quarter system next year.
SLS Dean Larry Kramer said the decision to con
vert to the quarter system stemmed from a desire to
better integrate the law school with rest of the
University as a whole.
"The chief impetus behind the move was to facili
tate interdisciplinary opportunities for law students
and make it easier for non-law students to take
appropriate classes at the law school," Kramer said.
"This integration is. in turn, a response to changes
in the legal profession." he added. "All the fields in
which lawyers work have grown more interdiscipli
nary and specialized. Lawyers must understand the
business of their clients and the substance on which
the law operates, as well as being able to work collab
oratively with others who have different training."
The change was first considered during the 2004-
2005 academic year, when the law faculty created a
student liaison committee and conducted research to
ascertain student reactions to the idea.
According to the surveys, students were comfort
able with the change. After the fifth faculty meeting
held in November 2005, faculty members voted to
switch to the quarter system at the beginning of the
2009-2010 academic year.
In anticipation of the adjustment in the academic
calendar, the law school made modifications to the cal
endar for the three academic years of 2006-2009.
allowing students to take classes offered in the fall and
winter quarters of the University's academic calendar.
The law school also made changes to its curricu
lum. establishing interdisciplinary courses and joint
degree programs that can be completed concurrently
with the J.D.
However, not all students at the law school wel
come the change.
"The professors are not used to teaching on the
quarter yet," said Blake Bailey, a third-year law stu
dent. "The one course I took on the quarter was much
more challenging due to the compacted schedule."
"My general sense is that students prefer the
semester system," Bailey added. "Whether this pref
erence is due to inertia or an honest comparative
analysis is unclear."
Once the quarter system is fully implemented at
the law school, the academic year will begin near the
middle of September and end near the middle of
June. In comparison, Harvard Law School will finish
on May 15 this year, Yale Law
School ends its 2009 spring term on
May 22 and NYU Law will hold its
Convocation Ceremony on May 15.
Law students voiced concerns

that because many summer posi
tions begin in May, the later ending
of the spring quarter would reduce
their chances of getting summer
jobs in an already brutal job mar
ket.
But Dean Kramer is confident
that this will not be the case.
"Summer positions begin at a
number of different times in May
and June, and employers are flexi

ble on start dates because the last
day of classes is different at differ
ent schools," the dean said.
"Students have never all started
work on the same day. Moreover,
many students split their summer
among more than one employer
and so begin work at a second
employer later in the summer."
Although the academic year at
other law schools typically ends in
May, many highly competitive
schools such as the University of
Chicago and the University of
Washington are also on the quarter
system.
Still, some students remain skep
tical.
"It probably would have hurt my
ability to get a summer associate
position at a Texas firm," Bailey said.
"The ability to split is crucial in
Texas. Many major Texas firms only
want first-half splits, from mid-May
to late-June."

"Of course, most firms are flexi
ble, but it is not exactly the most
comfortable position to ask to start
in mid-June when most of their sum
mer class will start mid-May and
leave mid- to late-June," he added.
Of course, the actual impact of
the change to the quarter system
remains to be seen, but Kramer is
confident the transition is for the
better.
"Students who take clinics will
now be able to devote something
far closer to full-time effort to their
clinical experience," Kramer said,
"and our students will be able to
take more courses while they are
here. It is part of a broader effort to
modify and enlarge our curriculum
to prepare students better to meet
the challenges of practice in the 21st
century."
