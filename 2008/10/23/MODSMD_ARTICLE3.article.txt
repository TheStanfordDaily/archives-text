## Hoover acquires Rehnquist files 
### DAISY CHEN STAFF WRITER 
The Hoover Institution announced yes
terday that the family of the late Chief
Justice William Rehnquist has donated
papers from Rehnquist's 33-year tenure
on the Supreme Court to the Hoover
Archives at Stanford.
Rehnquist received a bachelor's and
master's degree in political science from
Stanford and a J. 13. from Stanford Law
School. He was also a member of the
Hoover Institute Board of Overseers.
"This is a major acquisition for the
Hoover Archives," said Hoover Institution
Director John Raisian in a press release.
"Chief Justice Rehnquist's collection will
enhance Hoover's reputation as a major

repository for materials on the U.S. gov
ernment."
"We are pleased that Chief Justice
Rehnquist's papers are coming full circle
back to Stanford, where he began his illus
trious career," Raisian added.
Rehnquist's papers include various
case-related materials, speeches, drafts,
personal correspondences with fellow jus
tices and notes from the books he
authored.
"It is the first time a justice has given
papers to Hoover," said Michele Horaney,
manager of Hoover Public Affairs. "His
family knew this would be an excellent
location to manage and file his papers."
I"he Rehnquist records contain approx
imately 6(H) linear feet of documents from
his vears on the Court. As the documents

were only recently received by the Hoover
Archives, much of the contents have not
been processed or screened.
"We will be working on this for a
while," Horaney said.
Once processed, particular sections of
his records and papers will be released to
the public and be available for research
use.
Richard Sousa. director of the Hoover
Archives, said Rehnquist's case files can
not be released until all the justices on the
Court who heard and ruled on the cases
are deceased.Therefore, only the case files
between January 1972 and December
1975 can be released now.
Among the cases decided between
those dates was 1973's Roe v. Wade, which
declared the right to abortion. Rehnquist's

files and records from the case are highly
anticipated, as he was one of only two jus
tices who dissented — the other was
Associate Justice Bvron White.
The Rehnquist files join over 5,000 sep
arate collections in the Hoover Institution
Archives — a repository of World War 1
documentation; records on various fascist,
communist and nationalistic movements
prior to World War II: and a wide range of
records on political movements and indi
viduals around the world in the 2()th and
21st centuries.
Also, a collection of Rehnquist's mem
orabilia. various personal materials and
artifacts was sent to the Rehnquist Center
at the University of Arizona.
