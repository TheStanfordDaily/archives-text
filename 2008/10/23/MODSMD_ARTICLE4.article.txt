## Univ. employee arrested on Caltrain for bike infraction Space constraints squeeze bikers off Caltrain

A Stanford employee was recently
arrested for bringing his bike onto an
over-capacity Caltrain bike car, but the
incident was just one of many in an ongo
ing controversy between bikers and
Caltrain.
Ridership on the Caltrain has
increased significantly in the past four
years with the initiation of Baby Mullet
service in 2004 and recent, skyrocketing

gas prices. According to a passenger
count this August, Caltrain reached a
new high of nearly 38.000 passengers per
day in 2008.
Due to the increase in commuters,
especially during peak hours, excess bicy
clists are bumped off the train when
there isn't enough space. This has result
ed in growing frustration among bikers
towards Caltrain.
"Trying to get on with my bike has
become a lot more problematic in the
last year or so," said Gert van Dijken. a
scientific associate in environmental
earth systems science who has been
bringing his bike onboard Caltrain lot
nine years. "Sometimes, you miss a meet

ing because you get to work later. You
cannot take the train you expected to
take."
This frustration culminated in an inci
dent three weeks ago when Scott Wildy.
an information systems specialist at
Stanford, tried to board Caltrain with his
bike when the ear was over capacity.
According to the San Francisco
Chronicle, Wildy found a spot on the
train to park his bike and refused to
leave despite the conductor's warnings.
Later, police officers arrested Wildy for
delaying the train.
Wildy could not be reached for com
ment.
Still, the issue affects a number of

Stanford employees and graduate stu
dents.
"It frustrates me that I'm trying to do
something that's healthy for my body
and for the environment, and I'm being
turned away because of the train," said
Kelly Mitchell, an employee at Lucille
Packard Children's Hospital.
In response to the growing friction
with bikers. Caltrain has taken steps to
alleviate tension. During the last Board
of Directors meeting two weeks ago.

Access plan, supporting additional bike
parking at stations, a bike-sharing pro-
