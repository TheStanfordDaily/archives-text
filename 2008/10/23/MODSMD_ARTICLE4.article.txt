## Univ. employee arrested on Caltrain for bike infraction Space constraints squeeze bikers off Caltrain 
### MARVIN SHU 
A Stanford employee was recently
arrested for bringing his bike onto an
over-capacity Caltrain bike car, but the
incident was just one of many in an ongo
ing controversy between bikers and
Caltrain.
Ridership on the Caltrain has
increased significantly in the past four
years with the initiation of Baby Mullet
service in 2004 and recent, skyrocketing

gas prices. According to a passenger
count this August, Caltrain reached a
new high of nearly 38.000 passengers per
day in 2008.
Due to the increase in commuters,
especially during peak hours, excess bicy
clists are bumped off the train when
there isn't enough space. This has result
ed in growing frustration among bikers
towards Caltrain.
"Trying to get on with my bike has
become a lot more problematic in the
last year or so," said Gert van Dijken. a
scientific associate in environmental
earth systems science who has been
bringing his bike onboard Caltrain lot
nine years. "Sometimes, you miss a meet

ing because you get to work later. You
cannot take the train you expected to
take."
This frustration culminated in an inci
dent three weeks ago when Scott Wildy.
an information systems specialist at
Stanford, tried to board Caltrain with his
bike when the ear was over capacity.
According to the San Francisco
Chronicle, Wildy found a spot on the
train to park his bike and refused to
leave despite the conductor's warnings.
Later, police officers arrested Wildy for
delaying the train.
Wildy could not be reached for com
ment.
Still, the issue affects a number of

Stanford employees and graduate stu
dents.
"It frustrates me that I'm trying to do
something that's healthy for my body
and for the environment, and I'm being
turned away because of the train," said
Kelly Mitchell, an employee at Lucille
Packard Children's Hospital.

with bikers. Caltrain has taken steps to
alleviate tension. During the last Board
of Directors meeting two weeks ago.

Access plan, supporting additional bike

gram and subsidies for buying

According to Caltrain spokes
woman Christine Dunn, a new bike
valet service called Warm Planet
liikes is already at capacity, indicat
ing a demand for more secure bike
parking.
"We think that shows that there
are people who are interested in
parking their bikes at the station if
they had a safe, secure parking situ
ation." Dunn said. "'Hie more peo
ple we can encourage to do that, the
more space there will be for people
who cannot do that."
However, Caltrain's statistics
indicate that among the eight per
cent of Caltrain passengers who
ride hikes to the station, seven per
cent bring their bikes onboard and
only one percent lock their bikes at

the station.
Andy Thornley, program direc
tor of the San Francisco Bike
Coalition, argued that Caltrain is
addressing the wrong issues.
"It's obvious that right now
we're turning away bicyclists with
their bike," he said, "and what we
really need to do is rebalance the
capacity onboard Caltrain."
Many bikers advocate for addi
tional bike cars or taking out seats
in the train to make room for fur
ther bike space.
"The No. 1 fundamental thing
that Caltrain should do is take out
some more seats and make more
room for bikes," Thornley said.
"Most trains have lots of empty
seats, and at the same time, the bicy
clists are being turned away.There's
an imbalance."
While Caltrain Executive
Director Michael Scanlon hinted at
the possibility of taking out seats
for more bike space, Caltrain still
lacks the funding for additional
cars. Furthermore, taking out seats

"What we need to do
is rebalance the
capacity on Caltrain."

may turn away other passengers
during peak hours, according to
Dunn.
"We've gotten a commitment to
do something," Thornley said, "hut
until we see seats actually coming
out. off the train and more bike
space going in, we aren't really too

excited yet."
Each train also differs in its
capacity to carry hikes: some trains
only have one bike car while others
have two or more. Bikers advocate
a system whereas they can ascertain
the hike capacity of the arriving
train so that they may plan their
trips accordingly.
Despite these troubles, Caltrain
arguably has the most liberal bike
policies of any public transporta
tion system in the Bay Area — a
policy Iliornley called "exemplary
among U.S. train systems, maybe
even across the world."
Still, Thornley is pushing
Caltrain to do better.
"They have taken a successful
service and kind of let it go to rot a
bit,"Thornley said. "In a time when
bicycling is booming and more and
more people arc riding bicycles as a
form of transportation, Caltrain is
still stuck in 2004."
