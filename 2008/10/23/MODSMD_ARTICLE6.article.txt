## Pro-political rofiles Popularity of Obama photos reflects Stanford's political climate

ly vacation photo — and Barack
Obama.
As Election Day draws closer.
Stanford students are turning to their
personal Facebook pages — specifi
cally. their profile pictures — to pub
licly display their candidate of choice
come November.
Eric Tran '10 is one such student.
Several weeks ago, he posted an
image showing all four candidates
equated with different trains. Sen.
Obama (D-Ill.) is paired with a sleek,
modern train, and Sen. Joe Biden (D-

Del.) with a typical freight train. On
the other hand. Sen. John McCain (R-
Ariz.) is portrayed with a very old
fashioned steam train, and finally.
Alaska Governor Sarah Palin is illus
trated with a wooden toy train.careen
ing off the tracks.
Tran explained his motivation for
publicly posting the image.
"I was trying to share a metaphor
that I found very apt," he said."lt was
meant to show the hilarious juxtaposi
tion of Sarah Palin with Obama and
Biden. 1 put it up after the vice presi
dential debate to help me laugh off her
horrendous performance."
Humorous images such asTran's,as
well as more inspirational and poster
quality images have been freely circu
lating the Internet and popping up on
countless profiles.The pictures do not
seem to have a common source, but
rather are taken from Google Images,

candidate Web sites, emails from
friends and other online sources.
On the Stanford Facebook net
work. the vast majority of candidate
themed profile pictures are pro-
Obama. This could be explained by
Obama's much larger network of
support via Facebook — 2.2 million
plus supporters to McCain's half mil
lion— or by Stanford's political cli
mate.
Xavier Gaeta '09 felt that the cam
pus' pro-Obama leaning could con
tribute to this disparity.
"In terms of design. I think that
Obama has catchier posters." he said.
"But I also think that because of the
general atmosphere on campus
there's more tolerance for pictures of
Obama whereas with McCain I think
there's a fear that you may be judged."
Louis Schueller *12 shared Gaeta's
sentiment that there may be a nega

tive stigma attached to posting a Mc-
Cain photo on Facebook.
"To date. I don't think that I've
seen one profile picture of John Mc-
Cain." he said. "People don't want to
be associated with a man that's old. fat
and can't smile."
Downright against the Republican
ticket, a few students have posted im
ages of vice presidential candidate
Sarah Palin. but have replaced
"HOPE" with "NOPE" in a twist on
the Obama poster.
Apparently students are fine with
being associated with Obama — and
members of his campaign have no
ticed this phenomenon.
Perry Rosenstein '07 now works
for Obama for America in Nevada as
the state's New Media Director. A
large part of his work centers around
social network outreach on Web sites
like Facebook and MySpace. Accord

ing to him. political pictures on stu
dents' profiles extend the greater role
of identity on Facebook.
"Since the beginning of Facebook.
you've had people putting their fa
vorite books and quotes in their pro
files, and demonstrate who their
friends are by writing publicly on their
wall," he said. "Putting up an Obama
photo on one's profile is just an exten
sion of this self-identification."
Although the profile picture trend
is noticeable, some students said they
don't give much thought to the politi
cally charged profile pictures of their
peers.
Joseph Lester '11, a political sci
ence major, said he is not persuaded
by profile pictures that feature a polit
ical figure or message.
"I don't think anything of it,"he
said. "You get an idea for what they
believe in and what they support, and

that's all. It doesn't tell you anything
substantial about their beliefs. It's like
an advertisement that tells you noth
ing about the product."
Rosenstein agreed that the role of
the profile picture is not a campaign
tactic. Rather, he returned to the no
tion that Facebook allows people to
publicly affiliate with something and
make "a lot more salient" where they
stand.
"I don't think when putting up a
photo that someone is trying to lobby
for votes," Rosenstein said. "It's not
political in the same way that holding
a fundraiser for a candidate is politi
cal. It's political in the sense that you
are saying how important this election
is and how important this candidate is
to vou."
