# Pursuit to Publish:
## Campus journals offer students first opportunities

ur mission is two-
M fold," said Julian
■ Hong '09, former
% # e d' tor ' n chief of
the Stanford Un
dergraduate Research Journal
(SURJ) for 2007-2008, "to expose
students to undergraduate research
and to give students recognition on
campus."
SURJ. along with the History De
partment's The Herodotus, the Stan
ford Journal of International Rela
tions (SJIR) and many other on
campus journals that publish student
works, provides Stanford students
with a chance to share their passions
with a broader community. These
journals, like many other aspects of
life at Stanford, foster independent
research and a mutual exchange of
knowledge.
Getting published in an academic
journal also provides students with a
resume boost, especially in fields
where the pressure to publish begins
early.
SURJ is particularly accessible,
accepting submissions from a variety
of different disciplines. The annual
journal is divided into four sections
designed to give variety to their read
ers: Humanities. Scxial Sciences. Nat
ural Science and Engineering. Addi
tionally. the SURJ staff recently
added a Special Features section.
"This section is designed to de
scribe certain aspects of research to

students interested in the process,"
Hong said.
For the section. SU RJ gets writers
to interview student researchers in
different disciplines.
"[These interviews are conduct
ed] in order to see the creative and
practical side of researching," Hong
added.
In addition, SURJ also gets quite
a few submissions every year for
each of the disciplines. Hong esti
mates the number of submissions to
be an average of 12-15 per section.
This gets whittled down to the three
to four papers published annually
per section.
"The Humanities generally gets
the most submissions,'" Hong said.
"Some of them are I HUM [Intro
duction to the Humanities] papers
and PWR [Program in Writing and
Rhetoric] papers, which get cut out
most of the time."
Techie papers are not as common
as fuzzy ones.
"Math papers are generally rare
— we get about one submission a
year," Hong said. "But when math
papers get published, they're gener
ally excellently written."
Lawson Wong '09 recently pub
lished his research through SURJ.
His piece, entitled "Learning to Se
lect Robotic Grass Using Vision on
the Stanford Artificial Intelligence
Robot," was one of the two Engi
neering papers published in the 2008
issue. His research was on teach
ing robots how to grasp objects.
"In general, my research in the
STAIR [Stanford Artificial Intelli
gence Robot] project revolves

around robotic manipulation." Wong
said. "An example of this would be
how to use the hand of the arm to do
interesting and intelligent tasks."
"The difficulty in it was mostly
due to the fact that the objects were
unknown [to] the robot and could be
placed in arbitrary locations." Wong
added.
Wong chose to submit to SURJ
for several reasons.
"I thought it would be a good op
portunity to close some ties and write
a more formal report on what 1 had
been working on for half a year," he
said. "Submitting this paper was also
a good marketing step to let the un
dergraduate community learn about
the advances of STAIR and AI [Ar
tificial Intelligence]."
Students in the history depart
ment, if they prefer, can bypass a bit
of the competition from other disci
plines. The Herodotus, founded in
1986. is an annually published, stu
dent-run journal that's mostly for
history papers.
"The Herodotus is aimed to
showcase the academic events in the
History Department and to give op
portunities to undergrads who are in
terested in serious academic publish
ing," said Edward Piper '09, former
editor in chief of The Herodotus.
Although the journal is mainly fo
cused on history, editors maintain
that students don't have to be ex
perts in the field to get published.
"The journal isn't exclusive,"
Piper said. "You don't have to be a
history major to get involved."
