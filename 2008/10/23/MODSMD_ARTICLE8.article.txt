### DAISY CHEN STAFF WRITER

various initiatives and funding requests.
Justin Brown, a third-year graduate student in
geophysics, informed the council of an election
night piirtv that will he held on the first floor of
the Graduate Community Center.
In addition, the programming committee is still
planning a Big Game tailgate, happening 10 days
after the election party. Jonny Dorsey and l agan
Harris, the ASSIJ executives, mentioned that the
undergraduate senate was in the process of organ
izing buses to transport students to Big Game.
"If you would want to participate in the plan
ning for Big Game buses." Harris said, "we would
like to be on the same page if you want grad seats
on the buses."
Dorsey and Harris also notified the council
that l.ila Kalaf '10 would be attending the GSC
meeting next week to brief and pitch various
health initiatives. The aim is to attempt to work in
conjunction with the graduate community in the
implementation process.
Brown, who attended the undergraduate sen
ate meeting Tuesdav night, informed the council

that the senate endorsed a "no" vote on
Proposition 8. which, if passed, would eliminate
the right for same-sex couples to marry.
Following some discussion on the suitability of
the GSC to take a blatantly political stance, the
council ultimately passed a similar measure with
only one dissenting vote.
"We take stances on political things." said Fen
Zhao, a fifth-year graduate student in applied
physics. "We do when it's a case for something
that's best for our student body."
David Rasch of the Stanford University
Ombuds made a brief presentation on the merits
of his office in dealing with confidential issues,
policy issues and concerns, ethical concerns and
various levels of conilicts. He requested that the
GSC inform the graduate student community of
the Ombuds office's services.
The Ombuds office is not an official Stanford
office of notice, so the appointments are confiden
tial and the staff is not involved in formal process
es such as lawsuits.
Alex Hirsch. a student at the Graduate School
of Business, headed the petition for increased
recreational swimming hours at the Avery
Aquatic Center. Last week, the University moved
evening swim hours from Roble pool to Avery, but
still only devoted one quarter of one pool in Avery

to evening swim.
"It moves overcrowding to a nicer venue,"
Ilirsch said. "They have responded in a very cos
metic way."
Hirsch is now making attempts to speak with
Rebecca Carpenter, the manager of Avery
Aquatic Center, and Eric Stein, the senior associ
ate athletic director for Physical Education.
Recreation and Wellness.
With the support of the GSC, Hirsch hopes to
attain a meeting with the provost's office to dis
cuss funding for the cause.
Hie (JSC then proceeded to approve the fund
ing proposal for the ASSU Nominations
Commission (NomCom). although a few mem
bers were skeptical of the budget's vague, insuffi
cient classifications in line items. The proposal
passed with the stipulations that F.ric Osborne, the
NomCom chair, will fully brief the GSC at next
week's meeting.
Finally, the GSC approved a last-minute fund
ing request for high-definition equipment and
technician support from the United Nations
Association Film Festival (UNAFF) for its film
finale "All Together Now." The event is to be held
this Sunday in Annenbere Auditorium.
