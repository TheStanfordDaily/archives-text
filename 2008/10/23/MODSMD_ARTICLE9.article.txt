# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## Sun Micro, founder discusses energy 
### NIKHIL JOSHI DESK EDITOR 
For the second time in 24
hours, Kresge Auditorium hosted
a discussion about the future of
energy. In yesterday's event, the
speakers were not presidential
advisors, but one of Silicon
Valley's founding fathers: Sun
Microsystems founder and ven
ture capitalist Vinod Khosla.
The famed entrepreneur, out
fitted in jeans and a white shirt,
bounded onto the stage and
launched into an hour-long, fre
quently bombastic talk. The top
ics ranged from innovation and
entrepreneurship to technical
examples of Khosla Ventures
portfolio companies. But a single
theme shined through: thinking
big and refusing to take the con
ventional wisdom at face value.
Khosla. who made his fortune
with Sun. unapologetically
assaulted the thinking behind tra
ditional environmentalism as he
challenged the packed Kresge
audience to think of the next
game-changer in the energy
domain.
A native of India. Khosla told
the audience about the litmus test
he uses when evaluating energy
startups — the "Chindia" test.
According to Khosla. if an energy
solution won't be affordable in
China or India, and won't be
cheaper than coal and oil. then it
won't ever be effective.
On Khosla's hit-list of ineffi
cient environmentalism are the
popular Toyota Prius. wind and
photovoltaic power and hydro
gen-powered vehicles. Khosla
said everything heard about
renewable energy is "relatively
uninteresting." "wrong" and
"immaterial."
"There is a lot of feel-good
environmentalism that gets in the

way of tackling real problems"
Khosla said.
Thought he acknowledged
that he does drive a hybrid,
Khosla was critical of high-cost
environmental projects, like the
Prius, that don't scale up.
According to Khosla, the same
energy savings achieved by driv
ing a Prius can be reached by sim
ply painting 100 square feet of
roof white.
Khosla was similarly critical of
wind and solar power because of
the non-storable nature of the
energy generated from such
sources. He believes in investing
in energy research rather than in
wind and solar power.
Khosla's views, uncommon for
most involved in the energy busi
ness, originated from his own
travels.
"I've been worried about the
environment for a long time," he
said. "In the "90s, I started taking
my kids to the Amazon rainfor
est. diving in Pilao. and I realized
that [the environment groups]
were well-intentioned, but noth
ing they were doing was going to
change the course of industry.
That's the problem — they were
working on the fringes to save
some corals, but that wasn't
enough."
Khosla dismisses both the "no
change bigotry" that doesn't
believe in addressing the problem
and the "environmental every
thing" group that advocates radi
cal change. Instead. Khosla char
acterizes himself as a "pragmen
talist."
In the pragmentalist world
view, there are only three things
that matter: relevant cost, rele
vant scale and relevant adoption.
The hour-long discussion was
not limited to energy and the
environment. As the founder of Sun
and an immensely influential ven
ture capitalist, Khosla also spoke
about entrepreneurship and innova
tion at length.
He emphasized that entrepre
neurs and innovators must look to
the future and not the past, referenc
ing the Alan Kay quote, "The best
way to predict the future is to invent

it." As an example. Khosla recount
ed a story of how he followed a num
ber of important environmentalists
to speak before the U.N.
"I said, 'Everything you heard
just now is entirely wrong,'" Khosla
said. "And it was wrong, because it
was based on a set of assumptions of
the past. They had no way to include
in their future forecasts what tech
nology would do."
Khosla spoke repeatedly about
the importance of "black swan"
innovations — game changing ideas
that are only easy to predict retro
spectively. He used several compa

nies in the Khosla Ventures portfolio
as examples of black swans.
One such company is attempting
to take biomass and convert it into
crude oil in a matter of minutes.
Another is trying to take the waste
from coal and put it into cement.
Khosla's entrepreneurial-centric
approach to solving the energy prob
lem puts him sharply at odds with
the traditional environmental view.
"Most people believe, especially
in the environmental community,
that we have to lower our standard
of living or energy consumption,"
Khosla said. "I disagree."

Instead of reducing energy con
sumption, Khosla hopes that the
companies he funds and other com
panies like those in the Khosla
Ventures portfolio will he able to
come up with the black swan that
will end our energy problems.
"If we have 100 companies in our
portfolio, and the world has 100
portfolios, then we have 10.000 shots
on goal." Khosla said."lf 1(X) are suc
cessful. then great, we've solved the
problem."
