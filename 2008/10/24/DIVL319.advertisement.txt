DEAR DR. PAUL,
I have a deep dark secret and I don't know who to
turn to. This is really embarrassing, but
Usually
I can only smell it if I have an itch and I happen to
stick my finger inside, but sometimes, I can detect its
odor without having so much as moved an abdominal
muscle. Please help.
Dear Gold Digger,
We all have insecurities about our deep dark places, and our belly buttons are no excep
tion. Whether you have an innic or an outie, small ominous holes in our bodies that are
not cleaned regularly or not exposed to air are prone to proliferating organisms.
Besides washing with an antibacterial soap to keep the bad boys
away, you could always try using some of your spring fresh |
deodorant to reduce the smell. You may be tempted to lube f
up with some anti-fungal or anti-itch cream. While it may be / f \
tempting to stick Q-tips or other swab-like objects in your I | | 1
hole, remember that it is a sensitive area — too much stimu- III l__
lation is not always a good thing. Thought you'd never hear m-A. J
me say that, huh?
Got a burning quesiton you can't ask anyone else?
