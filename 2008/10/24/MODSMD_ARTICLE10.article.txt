# UNAFF:
## 11 years of social consciousness 
### 
Jasmina Bojic is enthusiastic but rushed
as 1 enter her office, her phone ringing
off the hook every five minutes, paw
ing through piles of T-shirts before she'll
ii]low me to start the interview. Plastered
across the film critic and lecturer's office
door are posters and fliers advertising the
film festival she founded 11 years ago in
cooperation with the Mid-Peninsula
United Nations Chapter and the Stanford
Film Society. It's a hectic time, with the
film festival already in full swing and sev
eral closing events to plan for this week
end.
"Perhaps this is in your size?" she asks,
holding up a 100 percent-down-cycled
plastic shirt reading "UNAFF 2008: Blue
Planet, Green Planet."
Since 1998, long before the current
documentary boom, the UNAFF's mission,
in Bojic's words, has been to both "give us
a mosaic of what's happening in the world
and inspire us to search for more." Though
it has nearly doubled the number of films
it shows in a single year since its inaugural
showing, and seen even greater increases in
attendance, the festival has adhered to this
goal with a consistently world-class airing
of human rights documentaries from 41
countries around the world, ranging in
subject matter from the environment to
education to war and peace. And, as one of
the nation's oldest documentary film festi
vals, the UNAFF continues to set itself
apart from competitors with a strong focus
on audience involvement.
Dotting the packed schedule are a
series of topical panel discussions featuring
filmmakers, subjects and experts in the
field, which the festival leaves open to
audience Q&As. Today, for instance, Nobel
Peace Prize recipient and former President

of M£decins Sans Frontieres James
Orbinski will be present at the showing of
his vehicle, "Triage: Dr. James Orbinski s
Humanitarian Dilemma," while even earli
er, a panel discussion will discuss the
"Impact of Oil."
The vast array of topics that this year's
festival will cover all fall under the general
heading "Blue Planet, Green Planet," which
the T-shirt features. There is, as the slogan
would suggest, an environmental compo
nent to the festival — Saturday is devoted
entirely to ecologically minded films such
as "Waste=Food," dealing with the new
"cradle-to-cradle" engineering creed, and
"Trouble the Water," an intimate portrait
of survival after Hurricane Katrina — but
the phrase has a broader symbolism as
well.
"It is a blue planet in many ways," Ms.
Bojic explained. "Tragedies, illness, war.
And the green planet component is a wish
— to heal our blue planet, to be green
again. This festival gives people a chance to
learn how they can make this green more
vivid."
The filmmakers who've made it past
the competitive selection process (41 films
were chosen from 440 submissions) have,
it seems, embraced this inspirational man
date. Johnny Symons, currently teaching
documentary film at both Stanford and
the Art Institute of California, San
Francisco, sees documentaries as particu
larly powerful methods of reaching and
evoking empathy in groups otherwise
unexposed to others' hardships. His, along
with co-producer and fellow Stanford affil
iate Leah Wolchok, own entry in the festi
val, "Ask Not," grapples with the fallout of
the military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy,
following several personal stories that

illustrate what he said is the "actual social
impact of a policy that a lot of lawmakers
saw as doing the right thing." It is a com
plex issue, he acknowledged with resist
ance coming both from more conservative
factions who object to the idea of gays in
the military outright, and the traditionally
pro-gay liberal wing, which often finds the
desire to enlist mystifying.
"I think that a lot of people will be
surprised by the authenticity of the desire
to serve," Symons said. Noting, however,
that the majority of the characters in the
film are of approximately college age, he
hopes that students will feel a strong con
nection to the experiences of closeted sol
diers, "literally silenced" by national policy.
Other entries take a less direct
approach. Stanford graduates Britton
Caillouette '07and Nicholai Lidow '05, for
instance, have produced in "Sliding
Liberia" what Lidow refers to as "the first
surf film to feature combat footage."
Following the pair's travels across Liberia's
coastline, "Sliding Liberia" is simultane
ously a surfing documentary and an exam
ination of Liberia's recent troubled history.
"Many surfers just ride a cruise ship
from place to place and never see land,"
Lidow pointed out, "when the personal
connection is really what travel is all
about."
And while the love of the sport is
clearly present in the movie's joyful shots
of endless tube rides, a sense of tragedy is
necessarily inherent in its educational role,
updating audiences on a little-known
country.
Lidow has since returned to Liberia,
he pointed out, and the situation has
changed little.
"The highest level of government is

doing the best it can," he said, "but it's dis
couraging to think that might not be good
enough."
In general, filmmakers seem to agree,
the UNAFF represents a unique opportu
nity to publicly address complex social
phenomena that don't fit into the typical
news cycle. As Bojic explained, "we under
stand that we don't have time on TV or
radio to see these issues discussed in a
more extended way. But these images allow
die viewer to search for truth."
From its free admission with Stanford
ID to its open-to-all-comers closing party
on Sunday night — following the film "All
Together Now" about the collaboration
between Cirque du Soleil and the Beatles
— the festival prides itself on its accessibil
ity to the globally conscious student. After
all, though this iteration of the festival
marks the 6()th anniversary of the
Declaration of Human Rights — and the
event clearly draws its inspiration from the
humanitarian, internationalist spirit of
that document — there is a driving force a
little closer to home.
The UNAFF represents the culmina
tion of President Hcnnessy's desire to see
on-campus institutes engage students in
issues of international concern, and it is
this that drives the organizers to put on the
festival year after year.
"With this festival," Bojic chuckled,
"you could say we did good homework."

radio to see these issues discussed in a
more extended way. But these images allow
die viewer to search for truth."
From its free admission with Stanford
ID to its open-to-all-comers closing party
on Sunday night — following the film "All
Together Now" about the collaboration
between Cirque du Soleil and the Beatles
— the festival prides itself on its accessibil
ity to the globally conscious student. After
all, though this iteration of the festival
marks the 6()th anniversary of the
Declaration of Human Rights — and the
event clearly draws its inspiration from the
humanitarian, internationalist spirit of
that document — there is a driving force a
little closer to home.
The UNAFF represents the culmina
tion of President Hcnnessy's desire to see
on-campus institutes engage students in
issues of international concern, and it is
this that drives the organizers to put on the
festival year after year.
"With this festival," Bojic chuckled,
"you could say we did good homework."

Jasmina Bojic is enthusiastic but rushed
as 1 enter her office, her phone ringing
off the hook every five minutes, paw
ing through piles of T-shirts before she'll
ii]low me to start the interview. Plastered
across the film critic and lecturer's office
door are posters and fliers advertising the
film festival she founded 11 years ago in
cooperation with the Mid-Peninsula
United Nations Chapter and the Stanford
Film Society. It's a hectic time, with the
film festival already in full swing and sev
eral closing events to plan for this week
end.
"Perhaps this is in your size?" she asks,
holding up a 100 percent-down-cycled
plastic shirt reading "UNAFF 2008: Blue
Planet, Green Planet."
Since 1998, long before the current
documentary boom, the UNAFF's mission,
in Bojic's words, has been to both "give us
a mosaic of what's happening in the world
and inspire us to search for more." Though
it has nearly doubled the number of films
it shows in a single year since its inaugural
showing, and seen even greater increases in
attendance, the festival has adhered to this
goal with a consistently world-class airing
of human rights documentaries from 41
countries around the world, ranging in
subject matter from the environment to
education to war and peace. And, as one of
the nation's oldest documentary film festi
vals, the UNAFF continues to set itself
apart from competitors with a strong focus
on audience involvement.
Dotting the packed schedule are a
series of topical panel discussions featuring
filmmakers, subjects and experts in the
field, which the festival leaves open to
audience Q&As. Today, for instance, Nobel
Peace Prize recipient and former President

of M£decins Sans Frontieres James
Orbinski will be present at the showing of
his vehicle, "Triage: Dr. James Orbinski s
Humanitarian Dilemma," while even earli
er, a panel discussion will discuss the
"Impact of Oil."
The vast array of topics that this year's
festival will cover all fall under the general
heading "Blue Planet, Green Planet," which
the T-shirt features. There is, as the slogan
would suggest, an environmental compo
nent to the festival — Saturday is devoted
entirely to ecologically minded films such
as "Waste=Food," dealing with the new
"cradle-to-cradle" engineering creed, and
"Trouble the Water," an intimate portrait
of survival after Hurricane Katrina — but
the phrase has a broader symbolism as
well.
"It is a blue planet in many ways," Ms.
Bojic explained. "Tragedies, illness, war.
And the green planet component is a wish
— to heal our blue planet, to be green
again. This festival gives people a chance to
learn how they can make this green more
vivid."
The filmmakers who've made it past
the competitive selection process (41 films
were chosen from 440 submissions) have,
it seems, embraced this inspirational man
date. Johnny Symons, currently teaching
documentary film at both Stanford and
the Art Institute of California, San
Francisco, sees documentaries as particu
larly powerful methods of reaching and
evoking empathy in groups otherwise
unexposed to others' hardships. His, along
with co-producer and fellow Stanford affil
iate Leah Wolchok, own entry in the festi
val, "Ask Not," grapples with the fallout of
the military's Don't Ask, Don't Tell policy,
following several personal stories that

illustrate what he said is the "actual social
impact of a policy that a lot of lawmakers
saw as doing the right thing." It is a com
plex issue, he acknowledged with resist
ance coming both from more conservative
factions who object to the idea of gays in
the military outright, and the traditionally
pro-gay liberal wing, which often finds the
desire to enlist mystifying.
"I think that a lot of people will be
surprised by the authenticity of the desire
to serve," Symons said. Noting, however,
that the majority of the characters in the
film are of approximately college age, he
hopes that students will feel a strong con
nection to the experiences of closeted sol
diers, "literally silenced" by national policy.
Other entries take a less direct
approach. Stanford graduates Britton
Caillouette '07and Nicholai Lidow '05, for
instance, have produced in "Sliding
Liberia" what Lidow refers to as "the first
surf film to feature combat footage."
Following the pair's travels across Liberia's
coastline, "Sliding Liberia" is simultane
ously a surfing documentary and an exam
ination of Liberia's recent troubled history.
"Many surfers just ride a cruise ship
from place to place and never see land,"
Lidow pointed out, "when the personal
connection is really what travel is all
about."
And while the love of the sport is
clearly present in the movie's joyful shots
of endless tube rides, a sense of tragedy is
necessarily inherent in its educational role,
updating audiences on a little-known
country.
Lidow has since returned to Liberia,
he pointed out, and the situation has
changed little.
"The highest level of government is

doing the best it can," he said, "but it's dis
couraging to think that might not be good
enough."
In general, filmmakers seem to agree,
the UNAFF represents a unique opportu
nity to publicly address complex social
phenomena that don't fit into the typical
news cycle. As Bojic explained, "we under
stand that we don't have time on TV or
radio to see these issues discussed in a
more extended way. But these images allow
die viewer to search for truth."
