## The
						holiest matrimony: A Stanford story of love and priesthood 
### 
Twelfth-century France was a happening
place. While the Crusades were in full
swing, the abbot Abelard was busy
seducing his prodigious young pupil, Heloise,
whom he later married in secret. Even after
Heloise got knocked up and locked away in a
nunnery, and even after Abelard was castrated
in his sleep by Heloise's furious uncle, the
infamous medieval power-couple continued
to exchange prurient letters, all written in flu
ent Latin.
Stories of illicit Catholic love
(between priests and nuns, priests and monks,
priests and altar boys, etc.) are nothing new.
But it's unusual for the details to be candidly
revealed, as they are in director Simone
Grudzen's new documentary, "Immaculate
Confession," which will debut at the United
Nations Association Film Festival on Oct. 26
in Annenberg Auditorium.
The 55-minute film features four
subjects — three former priests and one ex
nun — all of whom chose marriage over
celibacy and were met with mixed results. Two
of the subjects are the director's parents, Jerry
and Marita Grudzen. Marita is currently a lec
turer on spirituality and aging in Stanford's
Department of Family and Community
Medicine.
The two first met at the Maryknoll
Catholic Mission Society in New York, where
they were both preparing to enter the clergy.
"They began this really passionate
intellectual exchange," Simone said, "and they
became really enthralled with each other."
After Jerry was ordained and sent to
Bolivia as a missionary, the two began com
municating secretly in the old Abelard and
Heloise tradition. They sent furtive audio reels
back and forth between New York and Bolivia,
strengthening a romantic connection that led
quickly to marriage and to Jerry's excommu
nication. The two are still married and still
Catholic.
Simone and her sister Corita, who
produced the film, contributed much of their
own money to the film's $100,000 budget.
Inspired by their parents' story, the sisters
began research for the film in 2000, conduct
ing over a hundred interviews with ex-clergy
members.
"Many of them knew us," Simone
said, "because we grew up in this network of
priests and nuns, so we had sort of an in, and
we had their trust."
Ultimately, Simone decided to center
the film around four subjects in order to give
full attention to their respective stories. In
addition to her parents, Simone chose to fea
ture ex-priests John Dee and Tom Durkin.
According to Simone, Dee is fairly conserva
tive, still wears the Roman collar and identifies
himself as a priest, while Durkin is a "priest
turned sex guru," who left the seminary in the
'60s and began a new life in San Francisco,
where he embraced communal living, very
free love and a career as a sex therapist.

The Grudzen family opposes the
Catholic Church's mandate on clerical celiba
cy, and Simone said that she hopes the docu
mentary will encourage support for a married
priesthood.
"I'm for optional celibacy, and I'd say
the film is a testament to the reasons for that
movement," Simone said. "Basically my par
ents, with thousands of others of priests and
nuns, started a married priesthood."
Simone, who studied documentary
filmmaking at NYU, currently lives in San
Francisco, where she has done camerawork
and composed music for films (including
"Immaculate Confession"). No longer
Catholic, Simone attends services at the
Tenderloin's Glide Memorial United
Methodist Church, where she says she feels
particularly welcome as a member of the gay
community. And her parents, though still
Catholic, have been similarly welcoming.
"They actually don't have issue with
my being gay," Simone said. "I got lucky in
that my parents are very progressive. Both
they and I have seen this parallel in being an
outsider and accepting our sexuality. I feel like
[my coming out] required similar strength of
character and strength in myself, and I feel like
they got that parallel."
"Immaculate Confession" premieres
at Annenberg Auditorium at 3:30 p.m. on
Sunday, as part of the United Nations
Association Film Festival. Tickets are eight
dollars for general admission, five dollars for
non-Stanford students and free for Stanford
students. Tickets can be purchased in advance
through the Stanford Ticket Office (650-725-
