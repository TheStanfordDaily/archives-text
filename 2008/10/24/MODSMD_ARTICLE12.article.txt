# FiLM REVIEW
## Alum-produced documentary makes its national debut on PBS 
### 
When World War II ended, the U.S.
Army sent its official historian
around America and Europe to
uncover and chronicle the facts of the war.
Among the many statistics that S.L.A.
Marshall reported, one stood out as the most
significant and the most shocking: Of the
millions of U.S. troops who engaged in
active combat in both the European and the
Pacific theaters, only 25 percent shot at the
enemy. In other words, when actually staring
down the barrel of a gun at an enemy com
batant, three out of four soldiers refused to
pull the trigger.
"At the vital point," Marshall wrote in
his report, "[the soldier] becomes a
Conscientious Objector."
That quote begins "Soldiers of
Conscience," the award-winning documen
tary produced by Catherine Ryan and Gary
Weimberg, along with Assistant Producer
Ian Slattery '04. The film, which premiered
on PBS on Oct. 16, delves into the question
of what it takes for a soldier to kill the
enemy, and what the consequences are for
those who refuse.
The filmmakers examine that dilemma
through the stories of several soldiers who
fought in Iraq. Many of the soldiers inter
viewed became so disillusioned with war
and the idea of killing that they applied for
Conscientious Objector status. However, an
equal number of them didn't, and in fact
look quite scornfully on those who allowed
their personal feelings to supersede the duty
they swore to their country.
The balance of viewpoints represented
in "Soldiers of Conscience" gets to the heart
of what the film is about. "Soldiers of
Conscience" is not an anti-war film, meant
to make its viewers hate the government that
sent us into Iraq or feel ashamed of the hor
rors committed there. It's a study of what
happens to morality in a time of war, what
happens to the conscience of each individual
soldier when he's forced to deal with the
ultimate dilemma.

Few have thought about these issues
more than Major Pete Kilner, a professor at
West Point who specializes in the morality of
war. A Ph.D. in philosophy, Kilner has devot
ed himself to determining when and where
it is acceptable to use lethal force on another
human being. As the cameras roll, Kilner
lectures his students — all of them Army
officers in training — on a subject 1 never
thought I'd see the Army broach: the ques
tion of why they kill in the first place.
However, while Kilner is an interesting
voice in "Soldiers of Conscience," he is cer
tainly in the minority. Most of the film is
devoted to four soldiers who applied for
Conscientious Objector status during their
service in Iraq. Among them are Private First
Class Aidan Delgado, a military policeman
who endured months of jeering and
ostracism for his Conscientious Objection,
and Camilo Mejia, who went AWOL when
his unit was recalled for a second tour of
duty. Mejia, who spoke out against the war
on "60 Minutes," was later arrested, court
martialed and sentenced to a year in jail for
desertion of duty.
Both now discharged from the Army,
Delgado and Mejia have become pacifists
and outspoken proponents of Conscientious
Objection. Though a difficult road to take,

Objection. Though a difficult road to take, Mejia says, Conscientious Objection could cause the end of all wars —
if soldiers on both sides simply put down their weapons, then there would be no one to fight the wars. Delgado
agrees, at one point reminding the audience that the military represents the United States, and asking, "Is that
how you want us represented?"
Though peace on earth has become the goal of these two soldiers-turned-pacifists, they recognize that that
dream is still a bit naive. However, Mejia compares it to the dream of reaching the moon — a dream that seemed
impossible at first, but that, given the right people and the right circumstances, was indeed achieved. And after
watching "Soldiers of Conscience," I think that maybe peace can someday be achieved. At the very least, it's a
lovely dream to dream.
