## How technology is changing the orchestra 
### 
The scene is something out of an H.G. Wells story:
Entering an old mansion on a hill, a visitor makes his
way upstairs, past thick trails of wires, control panels
mounted on the walls and experimental equipment. Then,
inside a sealed room, a half sphere covered with metal disks
purrs in varying pitches.
The room is silent, save the tapping of a keyboard and a
quivering female voice. Slowly, the singing grows louder,
gradually bending into a fragile Middle Eastern melody.
Then the voice hits a crescendo and morphs into something
unexpected. "D'Oh! DO'h! DO'h," Homer Simpson's trade
mark noise rings out in rapid succession.
Behind a laptop, holding a joystick, a man with long
dark hair smiles, "That's what we call 'The Joy of Chant.'"
Experimental alien technology? A secret government project?
Nope — a demonstration of the Stanford Laptop Orchestra,
or SLOrK, a new addition to the campus music community.
The orchestra is the brainchild of Ge Wang, a professor
of music and, by courtesy, computer science. Working at the
Center for Computer Research in Music and Audio
(CCRMA) — a modernized mansion near Lake Lagunita that
once served as the University President's house — Wang has
scrambled the lines between musical periods, genres and
even definitions. By replacing classical instruments with

computers but retaining the orchestra's organizational
model, SLOrK extends the modern phenomenon of digital
music into the time-honored realm of the orchestra.
Launched with the financial assistance of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, SLOrK materialized last spring
after several months of preparation. Between April and June,
the group played four shows around campus, including at
the New Guinea Sculpture Garden and CCRMA itself.
Perhaps the highlight of SLOrK's first quarter was
"Pacific Rim of Wire" a performance at the Pan-Asian Music
Festival in Dinkelspiel Auditorium last April. For the per
formance, SLOrK had a live Web cast to the Central
Conservatory of Music in Beijing, China, over 6,000 miles
away.
"We were definitely happy with that one," Wang said.
The Orchestra's Origins
SLOrK is modeled after the Princeton Laptop Orchestra,
or, appropriately, PLOrK. While studying for a Ph.D. in com
puter science at Princeton, Wang helped found the world's
first laptop orchestra. In the fall of 2005, Wang, alongside
Princeton Professors Dan Trueman and Perry Cook, first
thought of the idea.
"We had to figure out what a laptop orchestra was all

about," Wang confessed. For the next several years, Wang
taught undergraduate and graduate seminars on PLOrK,
drawing attention from media outlets like NPR and The New
York Times. Then, hired to Stanford's faculty, he brought his
idea with him.
"PLOrK and SLOrk are similar in spirit, but different in
most other ways," Wang said. SLOrK is bigger, featuring 20
musicians in the ensemble. Importantly, PLOrK does not
have salad bowl speakers. Hut, Wang emphasized, the orches
tras arc used to wildly varying effects, depending on the
piece.
Though the original idea for a laptop orchestra came
from Princeton, experimental musical projects like SLOrK
are nothing new to Stanford. CCRMA has long played an
important role in the development of musical technology,
most notably in the world of synthesizers. In 1%7, Stanford
Professor of Music John Chowning began developing the fre
quency modulation synthesis, or FM synthesizer. This tech
nique rapidly and repeatedly changed the basic frequency of
a sound. By 1975, Chowning had patented the approach and
soon after licensed the invention to Japanese technology
manufacturer Yamaha. The resulting product became the
template for the modern digital synthesizer, popular in the
'70s and '80s with both rock bands — Kraftwerk, The Cars
— and countless armatures. (It's not a stretch, then, to thank
— or blame — Stanford for most '80s dance music.)
Over the decades, with the help of Chowning and count
less others, CCRMA has developed an academically open
minded and innovative atmosphere.




SLOrK members have combined technology with the
everday by imbedding speakers into Ikea salad
bowls. The speakers, in addition to amplifying music,
add an eerie aesthetic to SLOrK performances.
