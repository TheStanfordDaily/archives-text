# The 						music machines
## How technology is changing the orchestra 
### 
The scene is something out of an H.G. Wells story:
Entering an old mansion on a hill, a visitor makes his
way upstairs, past thick trails of wires, control panels
mounted on the walls and experimental equipment. Then,
inside a sealed room, a half sphere covered with metal disks
purrs in varying pitches.
The room is silent, save the tapping of a keyboard and a
quivering female voice. Slowly, the singing grows louder,
gradually bending into a fragile Middle Eastern melody.
Then the voice hits a crescendo and morphs into something
unexpected. "D'Oh! DO'h! DO'h," Homer Simpson's trade
mark noise rings out in rapid succession.
Behind a laptop, holding a joystick, a man with long
dark hair smiles, "That's what we call 'The Joy of Chant.'"
Experimental alien technology? A secret government project?
Nope — a demonstration of the Stanford Laptop Orchestra,
or SLOrK, a new addition to the campus music community.
The orchestra is the brainchild of Ge Wang, a professor
of music and, by courtesy, computer science. Working at the
Center for Computer Research in Music and Audio
(CCRMA) — a modernized mansion near Lake Lagunita that
once served as the University President's house — Wang has
scrambled the lines between musical periods, genres and
even definitions. By replacing classical instruments with

computers but retaining the orchestra's organizational
model, SLOrK extends the modern phenomenon of digital
music into the time-honored realm of the orchestra.
Launched with the financial assistance of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, SLOrK materialized last spring
after several months of preparation. Between April and June,
the group played four shows around campus, including at
the New Guinea Sculpture Garden and CCRMA itself.
Perhaps the highlight of SLOrK's first quarter was
"Pacific Rim of Wire" a performance at the Pan-Asian Music
Festival in Dinkelspiel Auditorium last April. For the per
formance, SLOrK had a live Web cast to the Central
Conservatory of Music in Beijing, China, over 6,000 miles
away.
"We were definitely happy with that one," Wang said.
The Orchestra's Origins
SLOrK is modeled after the Princeton Laptop Orchestra,
or, appropriately, PLOrK. While studying for a Ph.D. in com
puter science at Princeton, Wang helped found the world's
first laptop orchestra. In the fall of 2005, Wang, alongside
Princeton Professors Dan Trueman and Perry Cook, first
thought of the idea.
"We had to figure out what a laptop orchestra was all

about," Wang confessed. For the next several years, Wang
taught undergraduate and graduate seminars on PLOrK,
drawing attention from media outlets like NPR and The New
York Times. Then, hired to Stanford's faculty, he brought his
idea with him.
"PLOrK and SLOrk are similar in spirit, but different in
most other ways," Wang said. SLOrK is bigger, featuring 20
musicians in the ensemble. Importantly, PLOrK does not
have salad bowl speakers. Hut, Wang emphasized, the orches
tras arc used to wildly varying effects, depending on the
piece.
Though the original idea for a laptop orchestra came
from Princeton, experimental musical projects like SLOrK
are nothing new to Stanford. CCRMA has long played an
important role in the development of musical technology,
most notably in the world of synthesizers. In 1%7, Stanford
Professor of Music John Chowning began developing the fre
quency modulation synthesis, or FM synthesizer. This tech
nique rapidly and repeatedly changed the basic frequency of
a sound. By 1975, Chowning had patented the approach and
soon after licensed the invention to Japanese technology
manufacturer Yamaha. The resulting product became the
template for the modern digital synthesizer, popular in the
'70s and '80s with both rock bands — Kraftwerk, The Cars
— and countless armatures. (It's not a stretch, then, to thank
— or blame — Stanford for most '80s dance music.)
Over the decades, with the help of Chowning and count
less others, CCRMA has developed an academically open
minded and innovative atmosphere.




SLOrK members have combined technology with the
everday by imbedding speakers into Ikea salad
bowls. The speakers, in addition to amplifying music,
add an eerie aesthetic to SLOrK performances.
"The term 'cross-disciplinary' gets thrown around a lot
nowadays," Wang said, "But we don't have to fake it...
(CCRMA) is a nexus of so many disciplines and of academia
and industry — and that's all reflected in the original vision."
Stanford's SLOrK
Certainly the Stanford Laptop Orchestra represents this
original vision well. Founded with the help of 25 students —
many music, science and technology co-term students — the
group has flourished to include students with a wide spec
trum of interests. Wang counts among his ranks "engineers
more interested in learning about music," composers looking
for a "new medium for their compositions" and even stu
dents from "history, chemistry, electrical engineering" and
more.
Little technical knowledge is required to work with
SLOrK. "You don't have to have any programming knowledge
when you step into one of these SLOrK classes," Wang said.
"We teach you ... You just have to want to make music
together."
The set-up is relatively simple. Members of the SLOrK
operate black Apple Macbooks, which are connected via a
series of cables to a spherical speaker system and control box
for volume, among other things. Depending on the piece
being played, the set up can include a joystick and other
accessories.
The laptops themselves are, as the group's title suggests,
the heart of Wang's vision. Ensemble members — the "musi
cians" — use a variety of different programs and configura
tions to create a variety of different sounds, ranging from a
human-like voice to percussion to the ambient noises of a
casino. SLOrK relies on a coding language that Professor
Wang developed while at Princeton known simply as
"CHUcK." The language is made specifically for music and
sound use, prototyping an instrument in a matter of min
utes. "The computer itself is not an instrument. Wc have to
craft it into one," Wang said.
As with all technology, SLOrk is not without glitches.
"There is a high attack factor — something could always
wrong," Wang said. Before every performance ensemble
members debug the coding that runs during the perform
ance. Then, once they begin "playing," the laptops arc suscep
tible to freezing and slowing, particularly when using the
Internet. But that's all part of the thrill of relying on technol
ogy, according to Wang: "It's all about dealing with uncer
tainty and embracing the potential for failure."
In addition to its innovative use of the laptop, SLOrK
has worked to develop unique spherical speakers that are
both visually and sonically arresting. Made from an amusing
combination of high technology — the latest in audio speak
ers — and decidedly low technology — wooden IKEA salad

bowls — the speakers are beige with six small gray circles.
The grey disks are the speakers themselves, roughly equiva
lent to a good car stereo system. The result is wondrously
alien, like something out of a science-fiction movie.
But they are much more than decoration. The IKEA
bowl speakers allow the orchestra's sounds to emanate out
ward from the musician, giving the "laptop and the human
their own sonic space," Wang said. The sound is "inside out,
rather outside in," he added. "As a result, there is sonic inti
macy, like a more traditional instrument — sound comes
from a violin, not the amplification around it."
Using the odd combination of a laptop and a salad bowl,
ensemble members "play" music in a variety of ways. In one
piece titled "Crystalis," a laptop generates sound based on
touch. In a demonstration by Wang, the sounds varied
depending on which key or part of the laptop he touched.
Even tapping the laptop itself generated an ethereal squeal.
"The laptop becomes a bow, where you can create sound
with very sensitive gestures," Wang noted as he tapped away
at a keyboard.
The Human Touch
This is where the human comes in. Like an actual
orchestra, SLOrK pieces arc coordinated for an ensemble of
people, so organization becomes crucial. The challenge is

making 20 different laptops work together.
"It is game-changing to go from one to many," Wang
pointed out, "The challenge is ... How do we take advantage
of the sound, making good use of the human and the com
puter?"
So far, around three dozen original pieces have been
composed for SLOrK. The composer plays many different
roles: designing the "instrument" to be used in the piece, pro
gramming using CHUcK, organizing the composition and
practicing with the ensemble.
"There is a lot of trial and error along the way," Wang
said.
Central to SLOrK, of course, is the premise that comput
ers are the future of music. Will laptops eventually replace
real instruments?
"1 get that fear a lot," Wang remarked. "My answer is, 1
hope not."
In Wang's mind, there is no trade-off.
"Humans and computers are better at fundamentally
different things... Computers are fast and precise," he said.
"Humans are social and can communicate in so many differ
ent ways. Our goal is to combine the best of both."

more interested in learning about music," composers looking
for a "new medium for their compositions" and even stu
dents from "history, chemistry, electrical engineering" and
more.
Little technical knowledge is required to work with
SLOrK. "You don't have to have any programming knowledge
when you step into one of these SLOrK classes," Wang said.
"We teach you ... You just have to want to make music
together."
The set-up is relatively simple. Members of the SLOrK
operate black Apple Macbooks, which are connected via a
series of cables to a spherical speaker system and control box
for volume, among other things. Depending on the piece
being played, the set up can include a joystick and other
accessories.
The laptops themselves are, as the group's title suggests,
the heart of Wang's vision. Ensemble members — the "musi
cians" — use a variety of different programs and configura
tions to create a variety of different sounds, ranging from a
human-like voice to percussion to the ambient noises of a
casino. SLOrK relies on a coding language that Professor
Wang developed while at Princeton known simply as
"CHUcK." The language is made specifically for music and
sound use, prototyping an instrument in a matter of min
utes. "The computer itself is not an instrument. Wc have to
craft it into one," Wang said.
As with all technology, SLOrk is not without glitches.
"There is a high attack factor — something could always
wrong," Wang said. Before every performance ensemble
members debug the coding that runs during the perform
ance. Then, once they begin "playing," the laptops arc suscep
tible to freezing and slowing, particularly when using the
Internet. But that's all part of the thrill of relying on technol
ogy, according to Wang: "It's all about dealing with uncer
tainty and embracing the potential for failure."
In addition to its innovative use of the laptop, SLOrK
has worked to develop unique spherical speakers that are
both visually and sonically arresting. Made from an amusing
combination of high technology — the latest in audio speak
ers — and decidedly low technology — wooden IKEA salad

bowls — the speakers are beige with six small gray circles.
The grey disks are the speakers themselves, roughly equiva
lent to a good car stereo system. The result is wondrously
alien, like something out of a science-fiction movie.
But they are much more than decoration. The IKEA
bowl speakers allow the orchestra's sounds to emanate out
ward from the musician, giving the "laptop and the human
their own sonic space," Wang said. The sound is "inside out,
rather outside in," he added. "As a result, there is sonic inti
macy, like a more traditional instrument — sound comes
from a violin, not the amplification around it."
Using the odd combination of a laptop and a salad bowl,
ensemble members "play" music in a variety of ways. In one
piece titled "Crystalis," a laptop generates sound based on
touch. In a demonstration by Wang, the sounds varied
depending on which key or part of the laptop he touched.
Even tapping the laptop itself generated an ethereal squeal.
"The laptop becomes a bow, where you can create sound
with very sensitive gestures," Wang noted as he tapped away
at a keyboard.
The Human Touch
This is where the human comes in. Like an actual
orchestra, SLOrK pieces arc coordinated for an ensemble of
people, so organization becomes crucial. The challenge is

making 20 different laptops work together.
"It is game-changing to go from one to many," Wang
pointed out, "The challenge is ... How do we take advantage
of the sound, making good use of the human and the com
puter?"
So far, around three dozen original pieces have been
composed for SLOrK. The composer plays many different
roles: designing the "instrument" to be used in the piece, pro
gramming using CHUcK, organizing the composition and
practicing with the ensemble.
"There is a lot of trial and error along the way," Wang
said.
Central to SLOrK, of course, is the premise that comput
ers are the future of music. Will laptops eventually replace
real instruments?
"1 get that fear a lot," Wang remarked. "My answer is, 1
hope not."
In Wang's mind, there is no trade-off.
"Humans and computers are better at fundamentally
different things... Computers are fast and precise," he said.
"Humans are social and can communicate in so many differ
ent ways. Our goal is to combine the best of both."

The scene is something out of an H.G. Wells story:
Entering an old mansion on a hill, a visitor makes his
way upstairs, past thick trails of wires, control panels
mounted on the walls and experimental equipment. Then,
inside a sealed room, a half sphere covered with metal disks
purrs in varying pitches.
The room is silent, save the tapping of a keyboard and a
quivering female voice. Slowly, the singing grows louder,
gradually bending into a fragile Middle Eastern melody.
Then the voice hits a crescendo and morphs into something
unexpected. "D'Oh! DO'h! DO'h," Homer Simpson's trade
mark noise rings out in rapid succession.
Behind a laptop, holding a joystick, a man with long
dark hair smiles, "That's what we call 'The Joy of Chant.'"
Experimental alien technology? A secret government project?
Nope — a demonstration of the Stanford Laptop Orchestra,
or SLOrK, a new addition to the campus music community.
The orchestra is the brainchild of Ge Wang, a professor
of music and, by courtesy, computer science. Working at the
Center for Computer Research in Music and Audio
(CCRMA) — a modernized mansion near Lake Lagunita that
once served as the University President's house — Wang has
scrambled the lines between musical periods, genres and
even definitions. By replacing classical instruments with

computers but retaining the orchestra's organizational
model, SLOrK extends the modern phenomenon of digital
music into the time-honored realm of the orchestra.
Launched with the financial assistance of the School of
Humanities and Sciences, SLOrK materialized last spring
after several months of preparation. Between April and June,
the group played four shows around campus, including at
the New Guinea Sculpture Garden and CCRMA itself.
Perhaps the highlight of SLOrK's first quarter was
"Pacific Rim of Wire" a performance at the Pan-Asian Music
Festival in Dinkelspiel Auditorium last April. For the per
formance, SLOrK had a live Web cast to the Central
Conservatory of Music in Beijing, China, over 6,000 miles
away.
"We were definitely happy with that one," Wang said.
The Orchestra's Origins
SLOrK is modeled after the Princeton Laptop Orchestra,
or, appropriately, PLOrK. While studying for a Ph.D. in com
puter science at Princeton, Wang helped found the world's
first laptop orchestra. In the fall of 2005, Wang, alongside
Princeton Professors Dan Trueman and Perry Cook, first
thought of the idea.
"We had to figure out what a laptop orchestra was all

about," Wang confessed. For the next several years, Wang
taught undergraduate and graduate seminars on PLOrK,
drawing attention from media outlets like NPR and The New
York Times. Then, hired to Stanford's faculty, he brought his
idea with him.
"PLOrK and SLOrk are similar in spirit, but different in
most other ways," Wang said. SLOrK is bigger, featuring 20
musicians in the ensemble. Importantly, PLOrK does not
have salad bowl speakers. Hut, Wang emphasized, the orches
tras arc used to wildly varying effects, depending on the
piece.
Though the original idea for a laptop orchestra came
from Princeton, experimental musical projects like SLOrK
are nothing new to Stanford. CCRMA has long played an
important role in the development of musical technology,
most notably in the world of synthesizers. In 1%7, Stanford
Professor of Music John Chowning began developing the fre
quency modulation synthesis, or FM synthesizer. This tech
nique rapidly and repeatedly changed the basic frequency of
a sound. By 1975, Chowning had patented the approach and
soon after licensed the invention to Japanese technology
manufacturer Yamaha. The resulting product became the
template for the modern digital synthesizer, popular in the
'70s and '80s with both rock bands — Kraftwerk, The Cars
— and countless armatures. (It's not a stretch, then, to thank
— or blame — Stanford for most '80s dance music.)
Over the decades, with the help of Chowning and count
less others, CCRMA has developed an academically open
minded and innovative atmosphere.




SLOrK members have combined technology with the
everday by imbedding speakers into Ikea salad
bowls. The speakers, in addition to amplifying music,
add an eerie aesthetic to SLOrK performances.
"The term 'cross-disciplinary' gets thrown around a lot
nowadays," Wang said, "But we don't have to fake it...
(CCRMA) is a nexus of so many disciplines and of academia
and industry — and that's all reflected in the original vision."
Stanford's SLOrK
Certainly the Stanford Laptop Orchestra represents this
original vision well. Founded with the help of 25 students —
many music, science and technology co-term students — the
group has flourished to include students with a wide spec
trum of interests. Wang counts among his ranks "engineers
more interested in learning about music," composers looking
for a "new medium for their compositions" and even stu

more.
