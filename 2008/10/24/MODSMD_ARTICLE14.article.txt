## Coupa Café: Campus dining takes a step up 
### 
Last week, Stanford welcomed the
newest addition to its on-campus food
scene. The Y2E2 building is now home
to the Stanford branch of downtown Palo
Alto's Coupa Cafe. Managed by Stanford
Alum Jean Paul Coupal '07 and his mother
Nancy (who we forgive for having graduated
from Cal), Coupa Cafe offers breakfast, lunch
and a variety of beverages that exceed the
standards of most, if not all other, on-cam
pus eateries.
Based on the small size of Coupa's
counter in the atrium of Y2E2, the number
of offerings is quite impressive. In terms of
food, there are pancakes for breakfast (avail
able all day), pastries for a snack any time
and a number of lunch options, including
sandwiches and salads. Like its University
Ave. location, Coupa patrons order at the
counter and receive a number to place on
their table; staff deliver your order when it is
ready. Additionally, food ordered to eat-in is
served on ceramic dishes, a touch not found
at most Stanford retail locations.
One of Coupa's specialties is arepas, tra
ditional Venezuelan sandwiches assembled
between cornmeal cakes. A number of fillings
are available, ranging from cheese to smoked
salmon. I opted for the carne mechada,
which is shredded beef cooked in a stew

somewhat similar to Cuba's more well
known ropa vieja ($5.95). The beef was
tasty and relatively lean, however it was a
little dry — it seemed that it was a little too
far removed from the stew in which it had
previously been cooked. Still, the cornmeal

griddle cake it was served on
provided a nice change of
pace from ordinary bread,
and the arepa was nicely
complemented by a hit of
habenero hot sauce.

Another good lunch
option is either a sweet or
savory crepe. The California
Mozzarella crepe ($7.50)
provided excellent mozzarel-

la bufala with pesto and tomatoes in a buck
wheat flower wrap. While tasty and generous
in size, a flour wrap might have been a better
choice as the relative harshness of the wheat
somewhat detracted from the mozzarella.
The Mediterranean platter of hummus, baba
ganoush, grapeleaves and pita is excellent for
sharing — great for a light lunch, or if you're
looking for something to nibble on over a
meeting.
But the main attraction at Coupa Cafe is
the coffee and beverage selection. The
Coupal family trusts nobody else to provide

their coffee. They
buy directly from
growers in

Venezuela, and roast it themselves there
before Fed Ex-ing it to the states. Coupa Cafe
takes its coffee seriously, and it shows. A sim
ple latte is good, and the cappuccino is even
better. However, what stood out even more
were the various forms of hot chocolate. The
spicy Maya recipe provided a subtle choco
late taste with a unique kick to it, and the
Abuela recipe provided pure chocolate bliss
that was thick, slightly creamy and sweet. The
mocha was simply the best I have ever tasted.
There is also a selection of teas including a
spiced chai latte which had just enough of an

edge to make things interesting, and vanilla
chai that I also enjoyed but many might con
sider too sweet.
The only real downsides of Coupa Cafe
are its remote location in Y2E2 and its prices,
which, while okay by real-world standards,
are a bit higher than the average on-campus
lunch. However, the food is a step above
most campus options and the drinks are eas
ily worth the price. Ultimately, if you are
willing to brave the journey to the west side
of the Science and Engineering Quad, you
won't regret it.
