# FiLM REVIEW
## Senior year could not come soon enough for "HS3" 
### 
CC -w- "V"igh School Musical 3: Senior Year" is a funda-
I I mentally flawed movie that does more wrong
.X. -A. than right. For those of us who are not in mid
dle school anymore, this film will definitely hit no more than
a small niche audience. However, when it comes down to it,
one cannot help but find some level of comfort in Zac Efron's
teen-dreamy good looks or the intrigue of the few scenes that
were shot on Stanford campus.
Don't get me wrong, though, Stanford and Efron aside,
this movie is pretty awful on almost every level. Several of the
film's flaws lie not only in the movie itself, but also in the fact
that it is the third installment of the franchise, which always
brings its own set of baggage.
Story-wise, "High School Musical 3," or simply "HS3,"
picks right up on the lives of the teenagers of East High as
they approach their senior year and all the emotional angst
that comes along with it. That is pretty much all you need to
know in terms of the story because there is barely any sem
blance of a plot. Yes, the characters have their fair share of
conflicts and drama, but these are all shrugged off casually as
opposed to being strong motivations and goals that move the
story forward. The film, which miraculously encapsulates
these teens' entire senior year, plays out more like an extended
episode of a Disney television show.
The character of Troy (Efron) struggles with what college
he wants to attend as well as what he is going to do about his
girlfriend Gabriclla (Vanessa Hudgens) as she gets ready to go
to — you guessed it — Stanford University. The remainder of
the senior characters — Sharpay, Ryan and Chad — also have
their "struggles" with regard to graduating and leaving.
However, as previously stated, all of these emotional hang
ups are quickly resolved, and at no point in the movie docs

one actually feel concerned, worried or curious as to
\ what will become of these characters.

So you're now probably telling yourself, "Well, I don't
care about the plot, 1 just want to enjoy the film's characters
and musical numbers!" Unfortunately, this aspect of the film
is also pretty hit or miss ... mostly miss. One of the funda
mental flaws of any third film in a series is that you can only
go so far with the characters. The first two films, if done
right, should already establish all of the main characters,
complete with their hopes, dreams and other notable attrib
utes. Because of this, third films always struggle with what to
do with their characters since they no longer have any room
to grow. This problem only becomes more apparent as a
result of the fact that this movie is also a musical. Musicals
heavily rely on their songs to act as emotional palettes and
tools of development for the characters. Since we already

know all about these characters, the songs in this film seem to
lack that emotional punch.
Of course I would be lying if I said that there was no
good song in this film. Even as I write this review I am listen
ing to the "HS3" soundtrack (don't judge me), which attests
to the undeniably catchy traits of some of this film's songs.
My final issue is that in a hurried effort to jam an entire

high school year into this film's story, there are a lot of
details that are stupid and oddly too convenient. For
example, why does a guy like Troy, a wealthy

kid from the suburbs, drive a beaten-up
truck? Why do the school's drama kids
have to vie for a scholarship from Juilliard
when they can all clearly afford to go any
way?
Finally, a detail that will especially bug
us Stanford kids is that in the film
Gabriella gets accepted into a special
Stanford freshmen honor's program that
entails her leaving high school in the mid-

die of the school year to go to Stanford for three weeks of
intensive academic programming. 1 know that this is only
supposed to be a movie, but as a Stanford student this glar
ingly false detail is hard to overlook. The film s writers should
have just had Gabriella go to Admit Weekend instead.
Despite the fake program Gabriella attends, the crew of
"HS3" did in fact make a trip to our actual campus to shoot a
few scenes. Hudgens walks through the quad and arcades
while real Stanford student extras stroll past her in the back
ground. Though there is one scene where Troy and Gabriella
are supposedly on campus, Efron did not make it here over
the summer — that was shot elsewhere.
Bottom line, "High School Musical 3" is not for every
one. If you are already hooked on the franchise and Efron's
good looks, you will probably find some enjoyment in this
film. Watching some of the scenes in the movie that were
actually filmed here at Stanford was pretty surreal. However,
if musicals (particularly bad ones) are not really your thing,

you are not missing much by skipping
this film. The "High School Musical"
\ franchise has finally come to an
end (for now at least), but hey, if

they make a college musical spin-off, cross

your fingers that they will come back to Stanford!
