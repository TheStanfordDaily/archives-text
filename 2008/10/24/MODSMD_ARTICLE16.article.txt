I guess you could say the night started out a little strange. I'm used to inti
mate club shows or stadium concerts, but the Roots' decision to play at
the Event Center at San Jose State, a converted basketball stadium, felt like
an awkward middle ground. There were even racquetball courts outside.
Still, 1 walked up to the growing crowd — much of which was formed into
a large breakdance circle — to find a comfortable place near the stage. 1 can't
say I was surprised — I'm pretty sure half the crowd was surrogate members
of JabbaWockeeZ — but it wasn't a usual concert experience for me. After the
breakdance battle died down, I walked up to find that spot near the stage.
It was a good spot — but it got way better. The girls in front of me lit up a
blunt and started smoking. Good times. Then they started kissing and blowing
smoke into each other's mouths. That was a little surprising. I tried to
get a picture, but unfortunately, it was too dark and I

think my flash would have ruined their intimacy.
Finally, Gym Class Heroes came out on stage.

I try not to enter shows with biases, but I wasn't necessarily looking forward to watching Gym Class Heroes open for a respectable
hip-hop group like the Roots. I was one of those people that, as singer/MC Travis "Schleprock" McCoy said "only knew them as the
band that plays that 'Girlfriend' song." Because of that, I imagined their fan base to be young teens that love Hannah Montana, and I
was apprehensive to see if they could appeal to the college-aged crowd they would be playing for at San lose State.
To my amazement, though, they started their set very strong. When Schleprock is not singing, he is a talented rapper, and the

band had plenty of energy to get the crowd excited. Ignoring the odd parts of their show, like when Schleprock told the crowd to hug
their neighbor (which involved me hugging the smoke-kiss duo) and their traveling flag-waver, the set was very successful. They played
through their hits, like "Girlfriend" and "Clothes Offl" to, by that time, a very enthusiastic audience. But, as my brother said, they

really won my respect when Disashi Lumumba-Kasongo, the Heroes' guitarist, tore the convention center down with Prince's
"When Doves Cry."

The Roots make a very good first impression. From the darkness, an interesting sound like a roaring sea lion emanat
ed from a corner of the stage. Then. Tuba Gooding Jr. marched out, his sousaphone blasting more bass than a speaker
could attempt to put out. The solo eventually transformed into "Get Down," a song in which the Philadelphia-based
group worked with legendary DJ Jazzy Jeff (Fresh Prince of Belaire). The energy stayed mid-level for a few songs,

then MC Black Thought said cryptically "I heard you were in town." To the crowd's initial confusion, then excite
ment, Mos Def made a guest appearance. Unfortunately, after one song, Mos Def left. I guess it was okay — it was
the Roots concert after all.

After a few songs, the lights dimmed suddenly. Slowly, ?uestlove began to pound his toms as a trippy yellow
light show followed the rhythm of his beat. Seconds later, co-percussionist F. Knuckles started playing his bongos,
hypnotizing the audience with the magic of their interplay. Tuba Gooding Jr. entered a little while later and began to
toot out a solo on his sousaphone. It seemed like Captain Kirk Douglas was going to end the solo party when he

began to play Stevie Wonder's "Don't You Wprry 'Bout a Thing." But, he's a jokester.
He began a 20-minute guitar solo that included Guns n' Roses' "Sweet Child o' Mine," George Thorogood and

the Destroyers' "Bad to the Bone" and Led Zeppelin's "Immigrant Song." Surprisingly, it was pretty
entertaining and very Jimi Hendrix-esque (including playing guitar with his teeth). The Roots were

imv.iiuuu.if.u.™ ...... . e v —j e>>
proving they are more than just a rap group when bassist Owen Biddle decided to ruin every
thing. His musical performance made it seem like he was scared to follbw the powerful acts of
the other Roots, but his velociraptor dancing would have said otherwise. It was an uncom

fortable moment.
Finally, Black Thought ended our pain and finished off the show with some crowd
favorites like "The Next Movement" and returning finally to "Get Down." I stayed for a little after
and acted like a fool to get a signed drumstick that ?uestlove was throwing into the crowd — but
to no avail.
All in all, the show was pretty great. I enjoyed watching Gym Class Heroes, which I wasn't
expecting, and the Roots were entertaining as usual. More importantly, if the Roots ever play at the
San Jose Convention Center again, I'll know to go play racquetball during the bass solo.
