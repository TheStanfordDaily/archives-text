# PERFORMING ARTS REVIEW
## Meredith Monk transcends the traditional with "Songs of Ascension" 
### 
cc ongs of Ascension" by interdisci
plinary artist Meredith Monk has
overpowered both the denotations
of the words "theater," "dance" and "music,"
and also my paltry reviewing ability.
Commissioned by Stanford Lively Arts, the
piece, which was performed in Memorial
Auditorium on Saturday, is a multi-genre
performance of extraordinary merit and
very little conventional logic. Jerry Bilfield,
director of Lively Arts, described Monk's
performance piece as "a transcendent musi
cal movement theater oratorio."
Monk performed with five other choral
members, a string quartet, a duo of other
musicians and the Pacific Mozart Ensemble,
a Bay Area choral group founded by one of
the original Mendicants (there's always a
Stanford connection).
The music continuously spanned the
70-minute performance, alternatively
accompanied by dance, creative movement
and theatrical lighting effects. The vocaliza
tions were entirely nonverbal, or perhaps in
a language that I neither understand nor rec
ognize.

The
Mozart
Ensemble
began the
piece on the
balcony, dis
guised in
street clothes
but inexpli
cably hum
ming the
same few
chords for
the 30 min
utes prior to
the show.
Throughout
the perform-

ance, the mood of the music would shift,
pendulum-like, from tense, fearful or mock
ing to temperate, gentle or even loopy and
fun.
At the close of the show, the choral
members walked down into the audience as
the musicians on stage laid down on the
floor while still playing their instruments, a

particularly
amusing image in
the case of the
cellist. After the
final note had
been sung, there
was no blackout;
the lights simply
dimmed on the
stage of prone
musicians and

singers, then rose again as they got up to
bow.
Simply put, it was an extraordinarily
innovative performance.
Bilfield called the show "one of
Meredith's finest, most expressive works."
True, the piece was evocative, but it is diffi
cult afterward to conceive of what content,
exactly, Monk was expressing.
In the dance portions of the piece, for
example, there was a clear progression of
ideas: During the show, first a man in red,
then Monk herself (also in red), then finally
a woman in white had solo dance portions.
The man danced frenetically and jerkily to
fearful music, as if he were sleepwalking
through a nightmarish maze; Monk moved
more smoothly, but with urgency and inten
sity; the woman in white's final dance was
fluid, to gentler music, recalling a natural

tranquility.
In the title piece
called "Songs of
Ascension," one naturally

searches for a rising tide and a summit of
emotion. Finding that within the dance
structure is challenging, since the emotions
slid from uncontrollable fear and sentiments
of violence into smooth, controlled expres
sion. The progression of ideas was not fin
ished by one of the five singers dressed in
shockingly bright red, but by the woman in
neutral, reinforcing the idea of relaxation or
release. Monk's trend toward physical fulfill
ment and personal ease with the dancer's
body did not crescendo to a shattering end,
but fulfilled itself quietly.
Nowhere in the show, in fact, was there
an obvious climax of emotion. The dances
had a linear progression and the music's
continual cycle between tension and release
found no dizzying conclusion, but transi
tioned gently back and forth, expressing
slightly different emotions in each section.
The work ended in philosophic aporia, lack
ing the clear moment where the audience
and performers finished ascending the
metaphorical mountain. The audience, how-

ever, was not left unfulfilled, only
unfinished. Perhaps this was

Monk's intended effect:
Rather than concluding
the journey, she simply
shared with us an hour
of her ascension.
