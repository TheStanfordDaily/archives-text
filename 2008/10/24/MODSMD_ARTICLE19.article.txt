# The 						Sexile Files: A rude awakening
## 
### 
cc> swear, I'm not making any of this up,"
says a handsome senior, slowly swirling
the rich black coffee in his hands as he
recalls the harrowing event that occurred about
four months into his freshman year. "My room
mate shakes me awake. It's about 2:30 in the
morning, and he's got a girl next to him.
"'Hey man', he says,'l'm gonna need you to
leave for a minute.'
"I was in no real position to protest, so I
got up and walked two doors down to the
room of a friend. I hadn't gotten a great look at

the girl since it was dark."
He shifts in his seat and takes a

few deep sips of coffee. The
night has cast a shadow across

his face, leaving only a pair
of isolated, moonlit lips

untouched. I watch them,
leaning forward in antici
pation.

"Twenty minutes later,

the girl pokes her head into my
friend's room.

'"Ey yo dawg, you can go back in

derc now,' she booms incoherently. I

walk out of the room in time to see her limping
down the hallway like she had just been beaten
or ridden a horse for eight hours."'
His mouth contorts into a grimace, and I
shudder. Who was this mysterious woman, this
wreck of a human being: a hooker or just
another Stanford floozy? Little did I know that
the worst was yet to come.
"I walk back into my dark room,"

Handsome says, his voice dripping with disgust

"and an overpowering stench assaults my nos
trils. There's no mistaking it. It smells exactly
like someone has taken a fresh shit in the mid
dle of the room."
No one could have prepared me for this.
Who arc these people who indulge their foul
fetishes at strange hours, cruelly casting their
roommates out into the cold?
"Somehow, I manage to block out every
thing I've seen, heard and smelled in the past
half hour and fall asleep. But there was much
shit-talking (no pun intended) the next morn
ing, and for the three years that followed."
Tt J. 1 __ t 1 .

Handsome takes a final gulp of the bitter

liquid and gets up to leave. As he strides

away into the crisp autumn night, I pon
der the circumstances: a rude awaken
ing. A dark lady. A ghastly stench. The

clues all add up to one thing: yet
another sordid tale of Stanford students
gone bad.
