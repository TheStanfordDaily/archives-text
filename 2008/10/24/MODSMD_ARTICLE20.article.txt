# THEATER REVIEW
## Themes of today's politics prevalent in "Radio Golf" 
### 
Given the state of our
nation, the timing of
Theatre Works'
regional premiere of August
Wilson's "Radio Golf" could
not be more appropriate. In
fact, as the election draws
near and the economy con
tinues to crumble, the con
currence of issues raised by
the production — a charis-

matic African-American politician,
a housing crisis — with those in
the world around it is downright
frightening.
It seems strangely prophetic
that the final installment in
Wilson's 10-play examination of
black Americans in the 20th centu
ry, which premiered in 2005, not
only speaks of the last decade of
the century, but of the future as
well.
"Radio Golf," directed by
Stanford Professor and Senior
Associate Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education Harry
Elam, chronicles the rise and fall of
Harmond Wilks (Aldo Billingslea),
a real estate mogul with ambitions
of being the first black mayor of
Pittsburgh. Wilks is a young, hand
some, extremely articulate black
politician with a message of change
for the working class. Sound like
anyone you know? Billingslea's
commanding stage presence, and
his character's mastery of political
rhetoric easily evoke comparisons
with presidential hopeful Barack
Obama.
In spite of an Ivy League edu
cation, upper-class social status and
a network of connections in the
city, Wilks soon finds himself in the
midst of political scandal. As his
dreams unravel, we begin to sec the
exact fear that many skeptical vot
ers have about Obama: Can we
believe the hype? Can black
Americans count on him to solve
their problems, simply because he
is black?
Elam said in an interview with
Intermission that some of his direc
torial choices were intended to
remind audiences of the similarities
between the world of Wilks and
Obama; for instance the costume
design for character Mame Wilks,
the candidate's wife, was meant to
bring to mind the image of
Michelle Obama. On the other

the vital stats. o« ASC V^

hand, Elam pointed out, "Radio
Golf" deals with questions present
throughout Wilson's 10-play opus
and serves as "coda for the cycle."
The idea that "in order to go for
ward, you've got to go back" figures
prominently into this and other
Wilson plays, and those familiar
with the author's work will notice
direct repetition of lines from other
shows in the cycle.
The central tensions of "Radio
Golf" stem from class conflict with
in the black community and a con
troversy over a repossessed house.
In an echo of the satire "American
Psycho," business cards play a
recurring role as a status symbol
for Wilks' social-climbing colleague
who clashes with the working class.
One cannot help but think of the
countless victims of the foreclosure
crisis while watching Charles
Hranklyn's heartbreaking portrayal
of a man whose home has been
illegally foreclosed.
In addition to its political and
social commentary, "Radio Golf"
boasts a stunning set and moving
performances from a talented cast.
As both a dramatic critic and a
director, Elam said he has enjoyed
being able to see academic and the
atrical interpretations of Wilson's
work "feed each other."
While students in, or interested
in, the African-American commu
nity may find the subject matter of
"Radio Golf" particularly engaging,
the issues raised by the production
arc front and center in the national
discourse. Leaving the bubble may
be difficult during this season of
midterms, but the questions asked
by "Radio Golf" are worth the jour
ney down HI Camino. Consider it
your civics homework.
