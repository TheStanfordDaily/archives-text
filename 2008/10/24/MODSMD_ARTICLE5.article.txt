# DOs & DON'Ts who wears short shorts? Leia Lorica bares her legs like a lady...
## 
### 
- Do this. Ever.
- Try to be Jessica Simpson.
- OD on multiple trashy
pieces (although one here
and there can be fun!)
Here we have: daisy dukes,
high-heeled boots, a lycra
tube and a wide patent
waistbelt. Each piece on its
own can be worn in an
acceptable way. Together
they are like having 4 prob
lem sets a week. Kill me.

- Choose shorts in longer,
tailored cuts
- Stay chic by pairing shorts
with loose thin knits or crisp
button-downs (seen here)
- Accessorize with heels
- Pick a simple color palette and
statement accessories.
Here, flat-front cuffed shorts, a
slim leather belt, a crested white
oxford, stacked heels and lay
ered necklaces are a comfy and
cute alternative to the standard:
jeans-and-a-top night-outfit
