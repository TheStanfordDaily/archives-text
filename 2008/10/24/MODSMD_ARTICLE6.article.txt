# DIY do it yourself
## 
### 
r
Open a beer bottle, or any
bottle for that matter, when
you don't have a bottle
opener.

Use a door! Find a door with
a good 'ol fashioned locking
mechanism. Place the top of
the bottle in the hole, and
pull backward, catching the
edge of the lid on edge of the
latch. Voila!

Use a table! Locate a table. It
shouldn't be too difficult.
Make sure it's not an antique.
Rest the edge of the cap on
the edge of the table. Slam
down with your fist and watch
the cap pop free. Refreshing!

Use your teeth! Ask a friend
who has thick enamel to help
you out. Get the crown of
your teeth under the lip of
the cap, and bend the lip up
while simultaneously prying
the cap off. Don't tell your
dentist!

Twist it off!
Always be sure to double
check when you're in a bind.

Many bottled beers and
EANABs come with twist-off
caps these days. Who knew?
We sure didn't!
