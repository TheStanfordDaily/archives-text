# New ceramics studio brings back a lost art
## 
### 
Last Friday, for the first time in 13 years,
Stanford students sculpted vases and
urns in an official ceramics studio.
Though it may seem hard to believe, the
University has not had a bona fide ceramics
studio since 1995 — and Friday's Ceramics
Club open house marked the culmination of
a four-year effort to bring the workshop back.
In a gorgeous location on the shore of
Lake Lag, at the rear of the Elliot Program
Center, students gathered to enjoy the club's
refreshments, tried their hands at throwing
some clay and explored the new studio. The
light-filled space, completed only a few days
before the open house, is outfitted with brand
new pottery wheels and hand-building tables,
and has large windows that open up onto a
view of Lake Lag. The workshop also includes
an electric kiln that fires to cone 10, and
shelving for student work.
Turnout at the event was high, and the
excitement among founding members of the
club was palpable as they watched their proj
ect come to fruition.
Alan Malek '09, the president of the
Ceramics Club and the man largely responsi
ble for creating the new studio, came to
Stanford expecting to find a studio where he
could continue to work in ceramics. Instead,
after a month of his first quarter spent
searching, he was told that no such studio
existed. Over the next two years, Alan went to
everyone he could think of — the Cantor Arts
Center, the art department, resident fellows of
various dorms and Housing and Dining — in
search of the funding and space needed to
bring a ceramics studio back to campus.

"All along we were sustained by the stu
dent support we were getting — everyone was
saying, 'I've always wanted to try that,' or '1
did ceramics in high school, and I was wish
ing that they had a studio here' -— we even
had a petition going at one point," Malek
said.
It's this kind of student support that the
club is counting on to fill its benches with
potters and its shelves with finished vases.
"We plan to hold open houses for the
general student body, as well as supporting
membership," Malek said, referencing the
club's commitment to expanding the influ
ence of ceramics at the school.
"It's exciting — this is really the culmina
tion of a movement to bring ceramics back to
Stanford," said Arts and Student Life
Coordinator Megan Miller, the club's faculty
advisor and one who has been tirelessly
invested in the project for the better part of
the last two years. Indeed, the club has been
working for nearly four years to find and
establish a space for ceramics on campus,
only now securing the perfect spot for the
workshop.
Membership in the club, for a fee of 50 to
100 dollars per quarter, not including clay,
will include unlimited, 24-hour-a-day use of
the studio, shelf space and kiln access. With a
beautiful location, excellent facilities and the
promise of unlimited creative opportunity,
Friday's level of turnout was one that the club
should have no trouble sustaining.
