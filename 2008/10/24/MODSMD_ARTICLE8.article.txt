# Impressionism:
## An art by accident? 
### 
In correspondence to a friend, Edgar
Degas once remarked that in painting,
"one sees as one wishes to see."
The subjectivity of vision that Degas
brought to his paintings caused fin-de-siecle
critics like Edmond Duranty to herald Degas
as inaugurating a "New Painting," or what we
now call impressionism.
But a new exhibition at the Lane
Medical Library asks whether Degas and his
contemporary Claude Monet were actually in
control of their own vision — or whether
ophthalmologic maladies may have con
tributed toward stylistic developments dur
ing their careers.
Curated by Dr. Michael Marmor, an
ophthalmologist at the School of Medicine,
"What Degas and Monet Saw" is part science
exhibit, part art display comprised of medical
equipment, scientific diagrams, computer
simulations and reproductions of paintings.
The exhibition is organized in the lobby of
the library and on two walls of a central
reading room.
Large display cases in the lobby show the
instruments of ophthalmology — the knives
that would have been used to remove
Monet's cataracts in 1923 and the types of
wire-rim spectacles worn by the visually
impaired at the turn of the 20th century. The
curator devised charts which estimate the
visual acuity of Degas and Monet at different
points throughout their respective careers. A
particularly successful didactic display shows
a normal color spectrum and the color spec
trum Monet saw with his dense cataracts. We
can appreciate the challenge the artist mast
have faced when blues became indistinguish
able from greens and reds from violets.
The exhibition's intention to bridge the
gap between art and science is a worthwhile
interdisciplinary enterprise, especially at
Stanford, where the boundaries between the
arts and everything else sometimes seem so

rigidly fixed. Given that the exhibit will likely
attract a mainly medical audience, it is per
haps fitting that significant attention is given
over to science. There is, however, a shortage
of attention paid to the paintings themselves,
despite the exhibit's claim that "ophthalmol
ogy does not 'explain' art."
The high point of the exhibition, then, is
when it does attempt to study the qualities of
Monet's painting. One wall shows reproduc
tions of well-known landscapes, one painted
pie-cataracts, another made with cataracts
and the last created post-cataracts removal.
Sandwiched between Monet's early
"Water Lily Fond" (1899, National Gallery of
Art, London) — a crisp and colorful canvas
showing the bridge at Giverny — and his
later "Morning with Weeping Willows (1926,
Musee de l'Orangerie, Paris) — a subtle
study of the effect of light reflecting on water
— is "Japanese Bridge at Giverny" (1918-
1923, Musee Marmottan, Paris), a seeming
one-off in Monet's career. Here, dark, muddy
reds and browns are abstractly strewn onto
the canvas and objects — like the bridge —
are nearly illegible. That this dissimilar pic
ture, "Japanese Bridge," was painted during
the most severe stage of Monet's cataracts
highlights the possible effect of visual
impairment on his work.
Although the exhibit is thin on textual
explanations and descriptions, it nonetheless
raises important issues about the place of
medicine in the arts, the role and significance
of artistic choice and the importance of
vision for the artist.
"What Degas and Monet Saw" is at the
Lane Medical Library, 300 Pasteur Drive
(650-723-6830 ) through early 2009.
