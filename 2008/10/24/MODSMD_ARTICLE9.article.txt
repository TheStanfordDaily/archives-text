# Student films awarded in red-carpet style

### 
Participants and supporters of Campus MovicFest at
Stanford shook up Memorial Auditorium last Sunday at
the festival's grand finale event. Attendees strolled down
Mem And's decked out red carpet while music blared overhead
for the festivity. The party spilled into the lobby where those who
attended the festival snagged free gifts from sponsors Apple,
AT&T and Guitar Hero Mobile, while a few lucky audience
members even won random door prizes ranging from iPods to
backpacks.
The finale, put on by Campus MovieFest, an organization
dedicated to empowering emerging filmmakers, featured the top
sixteen films of the twenty-two submissions produced by
Stanford students. Campus MovieFest distributed computers
camera equipment to students at the beginning of the year, and
asked them to create five minute shorts on a topic of their choice.

"Tour Guides," by Stanford's sketch comedy group Robber
Barrons won Best Picture.
"Tour Guides is a harrowing story of two tour guides, Andy
and Maria, who, though terrible at their jobs, realize they still
have feelings for one another," said Kevin Webb, of Robber
Barrons. "Andy is a straight-laced Humßio major who saves frogs
and fights cancer; Maria is a crazy artist who thinks her tour
cares as much about her personal life as she does,"
"The movie was almost entirely scripted," said Webb.
"Though one amazing accident was that Aaron Berg, one of our
founding members, came dressed in suspenders, rapist glasses,
and a gigantic moustache. We featured him prominently in the
video because of this."
Webb said from pre-production to finished product "lour
Guides" took about 20 hours to create. Packed into a five minute

short film Webb said, "I think it shows."
Other winners of the night were Best Comedy, "Slam Helps
Evan with a Problem," a film about Slam who is summoned to
help a friend with a delayed speech problem, and Best Drama,
"Gravity," a film about a man who is confronted with the dilem
ma of whether to report his brother who has come to him for
help after bombing a federal building.
The winning teams were awarded iPods, iTunes gift cards,
copies of Final Cut Studio and tickets to the Western Regional
Grand Finale at the Sundance Kabuki Theatres and the Great
Music Hall on November 15th, where their films will compete
with top films from other schools in the Bay Area.
