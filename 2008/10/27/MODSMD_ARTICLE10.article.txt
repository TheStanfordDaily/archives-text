Witnesses: U.S. helicopters attack Syrian
village
Syria's state-run television and witnesses say U.S. mil
itary helicopters have attacked an area along the coun
try's border with Iraq, causing casualties.
The report quoted unnamed Syrian officials and said
the area is near the Syrian border town of Abu Kamal. It
gave no other details on Sunday's attack.
Local residents told The Associated Press by tele
phone that two helicopters carrying U.S. soldiers raided
the village of Hwijeh, 10 miles inside Syria's border,
killing seven people and wounding five.
The U.S. military in Baghdad had no immediate com
ment.
Alaska's largest newspaper endorses
Obama
The Anchorage Daily News, Alaska's largest newspa
per, endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Barack
Obama Sunday after declaring Gov. Sarah Palin "too
risky" to be one step away from the Oval Office.
"Like picking (Republican presidential candidate
John) McCain for president, putting her one 72-year-old
heartbeat from the leadership of the free world is just too
risky at this time,"The Daily News said.
The newspaper said Obama "brings far more promise
to the office. In a time of grave economic crisis, he dis
plays thoughtful analysis, enlists wise counsel and oper
ates with a cool, steady hand."
The Daily News said since the economic crisis has
emerged, McCain has "stumbled and fumbled badly" in
dealing with it.
"Of the two candidates, Sen. Obama better understands
the mortgage meltdown's root causes and has the judgment
and intelligence to shape a solutionis well as the leader
ship to rally the country behind it,"the paper said.
The Daily News said Palin has shown the country why
she is a success as governor. But the paper said few would
argue that Palin is truly ready to step into the job of being

president despite her passion, charisma and strong work
ethic.
"Gov. Palin's nomination clearly alters the landscape
for Alaskans as we survey this race for the presidency —
but it does not overwhelm all other judgment. The elec
tion. after all is said and done, is not about Sarah Palin,
and our sober view is that her running mate. Sen. John
McCain, is the wrong choice for president at this critical
time for our nation," the paper said.
'High School Musical 3' graduates to No. 1
with $42 million
Crazed killer Jigsaw has been done in by a bunch of
singing and dancing teens.
Disney's "High School Musical 3: Senior Year" hoofed
its way to the top of the weekend box office class with $42
million, while Lionsgate's horror sequel "Saw V" had to
settle for second place with $30.5 million, according to
studio estimates Sunday.
A big-screen sequel to the Disney Channel TV
movies, "High School Musical 3" had a record opening
for a song-and-dance flick, easily beating the previous
best of $27.K million, set last summer by "Mamma Mia!"
"High School Musical 3" and "Saw V" combined to
send Hollywood revenues soaring. The top 12 movies
took in $ 120.5 million, up 41 percent from the same week
end last year, when "Saw IV" led the weekend with a
$31.8 million debut.
"It was good vs. evil at the box office, and both won,"
said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box office tracker
Media By Numbers. "That combination of a G-rated and
an R-rated movie, both chasing completely different au
diences, proved to be a huge success."
"Saw V" pulled in about the same amount of cash over
opening weekend as the last three flicks in the franchise
about the diabolical Jigsaw, but it was the first that failed
to finish at No. I since the original "Saw" debuted in third
place in 2004.
The horror crowd was simply outnumbered by young
fans and their parents turning up to see how senior year
played out for the"I ligh School Musical" cast — led by
Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens. Ashley Tisdale, Lucas
Grabeel and Corbin Bleu.
