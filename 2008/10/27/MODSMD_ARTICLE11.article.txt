Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has
fallen ill due to exhaustion brought on by his heavy
workload, the state-run news agency reported quot
ing a close associate.
The announcement comes as doubts have surfaced
over whether Ahmadinejad, who faces strong criti
cism from opponents, will seek re-election next
year.
Parliament member Mohammad Ismail Kowsari,
an ally of the president, said late Saturday that Ah
madinejad was feeling under the weather because of
the strain of his position, according to the news
agency, IRN A.
"The president will eventually get well and con
tinue his job," said Kowsari, who accompanied Ah
madinejad last month to the U.N. General Assembly.
"Every human being can face exhaustion under such
a workload.""
Ahmadinejad, who rarely misses meetings and
public appearances, canceled a speech Wednesday at
a conference and did not appear at a Cabinet meet
ing the same day. But the president, who turns 53 on
Monday, did attend a religious ceremony on Satur
day in Tehran, though he looked tired as he greeted
supporters.
On Sunday, state TV also showed him receiving
credentials of three foreign ambassadors.
Ahmadinejad, who is known for working long
hours, has had low blood pressure and has gone to
the hospital occasionally to seek treatment, said Mo
hammad Hossein Saffar Harandi.the Iranian Minis
ter of Culture and Islamic Guidance.
"Even if you are immortal, you will suffer from
working so much. ...That is what has happened sev
eral times to Mr. President over the last years. How
ever, he is up and about and fresher than us right
now," he told reporters Sunday.
In recent weeks, some supporters of Ahmadine
jad have been discussing potential candidates for the
June 2(MW election, implying that the sitting presi
dent is not their automatic choice.
But Kowsari accused opponents of using Ah
madinejad's illness as an excuse to spread rumors
about whether he will run for a second term.
