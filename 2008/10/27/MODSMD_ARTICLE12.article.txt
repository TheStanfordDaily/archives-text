## Editorial New ResEd privacy procedures needed 
### 
The editorial board would like to com
mend Residential Education for
reevaluating its procedures regard
ing student privacy following the disclosure
of private information in an email acciden
tally sent to the Branner announcement list
(see "Privacy procedures reexamined" in
the Oct. 24 issue of The Daily). The stan
dardization of such procedures is long
overdue, and we believe that students need
to feel completely certain their privacy will
be protected.
We are concerned that there were not
safeguards against mistakes like this one.
Protecting confidential information should
he one of the main goals of dorm staff, and
Residential Education should have evaluat
ed its policies at the onset of the email era,
not in 2008, and before an incident like the
one in Branner occurred, not after.
Regardless of what should have been
done in the past, a standardized policy is
now necessary to protect resident privacy.
Though every situation is different and re
quires a unique response from dorm staff, a
few basic rules across dorms would go a
long way in safeguarding confidential infor
mation.
Email is clearly a poor means of commu
nicating confidential information and
should not be used as a means of relaying
staff meeting minutes. We all have sent an
email to the wrong person at some point.
This episode should be a lesson for staff that
an honest mistake can have serious ramifi
cations, and Residential Education should
ban private information from being com
municated in this manner.
Keeping records of confidential infor
mation. however, may be useful for dorm
staff. The Wiki method employed by a few
dorm staffs is a good way to keep records
while protecting private data. Perhaps Res
idential Education could help create a log

in system through which staff in each dorm
could post information. Stanford tech wiz
ards could easily create such a secure site
that only residential assistants (RAs) in a
particular dorm could access.
Residential Education should also estab
lish procedures for how information is
shared between RAs, resident fellows
(RFs) and residence deans (RDs). While
dorm staffs have done a commendable job
in the past relaying information about resi
dent problems to higher authorities, a for
mal policy regarding the sharing of such in
formation may be helpful. Certain stan
dards for what information to share with
dorm adult residential staff and how to
share it will help expedite problem solving.
Students should also be more aware of
confidentiality policies. Residents should
know that privacy is a priority for their
dorm staff, and that information they share
with RAs will not be spread throughout the
dorm. But they should also know that RAs
may share information with each other, and
that RAs. RFs and RDs may share informa
tion among themselves. Residents should
be aware of how such information is shared
and what protections are in place to prevent
privacy breaches. We want residents to feel
safe coming to dorm staff with personal in
formation, but knowledge of how RAs deal
with such information is essential to main
taining their comfort.
This episode should be a lesson for all
RAs to watch not only what they put in an
email but also to understand that what they
say could be overheard. We applaud Bran
ner staff for handling the recent privacy
breach in a responsible manner by immedi
ately contacting residents and instructing
them to delete the email. But we should
take the time to learn from the incident and
make sure that something similar does not
happen again.
