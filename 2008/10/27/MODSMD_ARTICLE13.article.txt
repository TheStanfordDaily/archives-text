## A 						consistently disfunctional relationship comes to an end 
### 
It can't he easy to he the ugly stepsister. I
should know. I have three ugly stepsisters.
One of them is named Bob. As if her situa
tion weren't already bad enough ...
Indeed,life is a drag for these femmes d'ug
ly. While your beautiful stepsiblings enjoy the
good life, nobody wants to take you to the ball;
nobody kindly invites you to the attractive
people-only frat parties; nobody (willingly) en
ters into a relationship with you.
For the last three and a half years. I have
been that Nobody.
I have been a gallant Nobody, to be sure, in
this relationship between my beautiful self and
this ugly stepsister,T-Mobile. Even before our
relationship began, the real apple of mv eye
was the hot one. the one who's been known to
give a man what he wants. We all know her
name: AT&T —or Cingular. or something.
(So maybe we don't all know her name). 1
turned to the ugly one for the same reason all
men of moral fortitude pick their significant
others:T-Mobile was cheap.
I kept up my end of the bargain. I strove to
see an inner beauty, but I found nothing to
convince me that T-Mobile had anything
more to recommend her once I got to know
her better. T-Mobile promised me reception;
originally. I misunderstood the connotation,
but no matter what she meant, she abstained
from delivering. 1 knew we were destined for
failure when T-Mobile stopped taking my
calls.That was about two hours after the rela
tionship began. It's been a steady helping of
frustration since then.
To be fair.T-Mobile also promised consis
tency. ITiis promise it has managed to keep.
You want zero bars of reception? Here's zero
bars of reception. You want five bars of recep
tion? Here's zero bars of reception. You want
to receive a message 10 hours after it was sent?
Your wish isT-Mobile's command, every time,
without fail, as long as your wish involves your
phone not being able to perform its primary
functions. The consistency was always there,
even if the bars were somewhere else.
(There was, actually, one exception to this
consistent lack of service, in the form of five
bars in the KZSII studios. l(Kated in the base
ment of Pigott Theater, 10 feet beneath the
ground. Go figure.)
This all would have been much easier to
stomach if the sales representative at the T-
Mobile store had not assured me all those
years ago that the "reputation"T-Mobile had
at Stanford was ill-deserved, and that I would
have no trouble making calls whenever I
pleased. I was promised that T-Mobile was not

the ugly stepsister after all. If I saw her for my
self in a different light. I was assured. I would
be happy with what I saw. Three years and
change, my friends,and this light is nowhere to
be seen.
(Since that fateful day when I signed the
contract with T-Mobile. I have had a recurring
dream in which that sales rep and Dick Ch
eney invite me to their dungeon lair for dinner,
and then when I show up. there is no one there.
Several days later. I receive a message from the
sales representative saying he tried to call and
cancel because of a prior engagement, but all
his calls went straight to voicemail. But that's a
column for another time.)
The "reputation" that T-Mobile has gained
is, of course, grounded in fact. I would realize
within days of signing my contract, and enter
ing into this relationship from hell, that AT&T
has its own contract — with Stanford Univer
sity— that gives it so-called "affiliate" status
on campus, a standing that no other cell phone
company enjoys. It allows AT&T exclusive re
ception rights, prohibiting other wireless com
panies from building cell towers on campus.
It turns out that the hot sister is just as con
niving as the ugly one I got stuck with.The dif
ference is that everyone still wants her. I know
I do.
I must acknowledge, however, that there is
something sinister about Stanford and AT&T
teaming up to restrict our right freedom of
communication, as well as the free market's
ability to offer us the best deal. Yes. we do have
the option as students to become "premium"
members of AT&T I think that's fantastic.
Save us all a buck or two. You know what
would have been even better? If anyone from
Stanford had told me before last week that
that option was available.
Not that it would have made much of a dif
ference. As I said. I'm already stuck in a rela
tionship. Yet I still find it incredulous that at no
time did any Stanford representative tell me
before college began that T-Mobile had nearly
no service on campus.

But my anger is as futile as the
phone provider at which it is directed.
As my contract mercifully runs out
this week, the time has come to finally
break free of the shackles that have
reduced my ability to communicate
via cell phone with the outside world
to almost nothing. And this time, I'm
going for AT&T, the hot one. She

knows what I want: an incoming call.
And she promised something about
reception,and I've been assured she'll
deliver.
I can't wait tocall all my friends and
tell them I've switched to a company
that works.
On second thought, maybe I'll just
create a facebook group.

change, my friends,and this light is nowhere to
be seen.
(Since that fateful day when I signed the
contract with T-Mobile. I have had a recurring
dream in which that sales rep and Dick Ch
eney invite me to their dungeon lair for dinner,
and then when I show up. there is no one there.
Several days later. I receive a message from the
sales representative saying he tried to call and
cancel because of a prior engagement, but all
his calls went straight to voicemail. But that's a
column for another time.)
The "reputation" that T-Mobile has gained
is, of course, grounded in fact. I would realize
within days of signing my contract, and enter
ing into this relationship from hell, that AT&T
has its own contract — with Stanford Univer
sity— that gives it so-called "affiliate" status
on campus, a standing that no other cell phone
company enjoys. It allows AT&T exclusive re
ception rights, prohibiting other wireless com
panies from building cell towers on campus.
It turns out that the hot sister is just as con
niving as the ugly one I got stuck with.The dif
ference is that everyone still wants her. I know
I do.
I must acknowledge, however, that there is
something sinister about Stanford and AT&T
teaming up to restrict our right freedom of
communication, as well as the free market's
ability to offer us the best deal. Yes. we do have
the option as students to become "premium"
members of AT&T I think that's fantastic.
Save us all a buck or two. You know what
would have been even better? If anyone from
Stanford had told me before last week that
that option was available.
Not that it would have made much of a dif
ference. As I said. I'm already stuck in a rela
tionship. Yet I still find it incredulous that at no
time did any Stanford representative tell me
before college began that T-Mobile had nearly
no service on campus.

But my anger is as futile as the
phone provider at which it is directed.
As my contract mercifully runs out
this week, the time has come to finally
break free of the shackles that have
reduced my ability to communicate
via cell phone with the outside world
to almost nothing. And this time, I'm
going for AT&T, the hot one. She

knows what I want: an incoming call.
And she promised something about
reception,and I've been assured she'll
deliver.
I can't wait tocall all my friends and
tell them I've switched to a company
that works.
On second thought, maybe I'll just
create a facebook group.

Mark just went to the ATA T store, and is
now about to take a red-eye from the
East Coast. If you want to compliment
