# The 						Right Angle
## Too much doing, too little thinking 
### 
It's amazing how we Stanford students can
he doing so much while at the same time
not be doing anything at all. We're like
chickens running around with our heads cut
off. We're crossing roads for no other pur
pose than to get to the other side. And once
we get there, then what? Then we cross an
other road without first pausing to ask our
selves where we're going and why we're
going there. We move on instinct, and we
move because we've been told we need to
keep moving to get somewhere.
At the beginning of the year, it's common
to see students, especially freshmen, racing
from one activity to another, trying to cram
as much into 24 hours as superhumanly pos
sible. A few activities are meaningful, but
many are not. Many students talk about get
ting involved in activities just because their
advisors say it would look good on their re
sumes.
On paper we all want to look like Albert
Einstein, Mother Theresa and Bill Gates
combined. What's scary is that some of us ac
tually do. With over 600 clubs and an abun
dance of research and service opportunities,
it's not that difficult to spend a few hours
each week in a lab, serve as the president of a
club and start an organization "to fill some
greater need in the community."The secret is
that the greater need is padding students' re
sumes.
I've talked to many students who are
stressing about whether they're doing
enough — doing enough to get into Harvard
Law. earn a Marshall scholarship or get a
high-paying job after graduating. Some are
performing research, writing honors theses,
volunteering and sitting on University stu
dent committees. Still, they wonder whether
it's enough. Some are struggling to stay afloat
but look incredibly serene, like the prover
bial Stanford duck.
I am sure that there are many students out
there doing things because they're passion
ate about them.'lTiey are dancing mariachi or
singing operetta or playing club sports with
out the intent of putting any of these activi
ties on their resumes. Some may be helping
kids in East Palo or performing chemistry re
search because of a genuine interest. Hut I
have a feeing that these students are becom
ing scarcer.
Career-focused student groups are be
coming more popular. Many of the college
students racing around padding their re

sumes for graduate school are the same ones
who raced around padding their resumes for
college, checking off their service activities
and leadership positions. And during gradu
ate school, these same students will probably
race around, padding their resumes for some
prestigious job. And once they get that job,
they'll race around padding their resumes for
a promotion. I wonder if it ever ends.
This is something to keep in mind for
t hose seniors who are filling out their gradu
ate school and job applications, and for
freshmen that are looking for venues to
build their resumes. In high school, many ra
tionalized doing meaningless activities and
holding worthless leadership positions be
cause it would help them get into college.
They told themselves that once in college,
they'd pursue their real passions, they'd con
centrate on really leading "a purpose-driven
life." Perhaps, but many have gotten caught
up in the same rat race as they watch their
peers sign up for a plethora of activities and

positions, and they feel guilty and inade
quate for not doing the same. So they give in
and tell themselves that after college, they'll
have the time and leisure to do what they re
ally want to do.
It's so tempting and easy just to do what
everyone else is doing. When you're present
ed with golden opportunities at every turn,
it's hard to turn them down. Hut the thing
about constantly doing things is that it leaves
less time for thinking about things, less time
for introspection and reflection. When every
one else is frantically crossing roads, it's im
portant to take a step back to consider what
you really want to do and where you really
want to go. If we keep on crossing roads with
out thinking first,all we'll ever get to isanoth
er side.
