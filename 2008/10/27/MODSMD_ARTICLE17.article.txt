I leated debate has filled this political sea
son, both over the presidential candidates and
the accompanying issues presented. Before
the Nov. 4 ballots are decided, however,
Proposition N merits a closer look.
The proposed amendment, which would
add to the California Constitution the state
ment "only marriage between a man and a
woman is valid or recognized in California,"
was accused as discriminatory in last week's
ASSU Undergraduate Senate meeting on
Oct. 22 ("Senate discusses advocacy"). Often
overlooked, however, is the intolerance im
plied in allowing the definition of marriage to
stay as ambiguous as the courts ruled it last
May.
Consider for a moment one consequence
of redefining marriage from what it has been
for the last few thousand years of human his
tory. ( urrently. quite a number of individuals
in California, along with their respective
churches and organizations,believe that mar
riage was originally defined by God at the
creation of humanity, as the story in chapter
two of Genesis goes. In this way, the defini
tion of marriage holds deep religious impor
tance to many.

If the court's ruling is allowed to stand,
such organizations trying to hold to core
principles of their faith can he prosecuted
under anti-discrimination laws, such as what
occurred with Catholic Charities of Boston in
2006. when, under pressure to change its
adoption policy, it opted to shut down its op
erations rather than compromise core be
liefs. Similar lawsuits may further penalize
any other church organization attempting to
adhere to its values on the definition of mar
riage.
More important than effects on the big or
ganizations, however, would be the damage
done to children in individual families if this
definition of marriage holds. Children are the
ones most affected by the condition of the
family. Public school curricula, required by
the state to include material on marriage,
would undermine the efforts of many parents
wishing to teach their children the values of
their faith.
The issue has many sides, to be sure. All I
ask is that we realize that religious freedom is
one of them.
