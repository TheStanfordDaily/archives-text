# Op-Ed
## CDC offers valuable career resources 
### 
On Oct. 21, the Stanford Daily
editorial, "CDC must step up
in era of economic strife," of
fered a number of suggestions and
criticisms of the Career Develop
ment Center that included some in
accuracies and assumptions. Let me
attempt to correct these errors in
fact.
First off. while there is a great deal
of grim economic news filling the
news channels, I hope that students
do not despair or give up. There are
still many significant life signs in the
economy.The Fall Career Fair had a
record number of employers attend
ing: 318. Every day new jobs are
being posted on our site. Rumors of a
job market akin to the Great Depres
sion are premature.
Secondly, the challenges and
amount of work you will have to do
for your job search will depend on
the type of job you are seeking, the
effectiveness of your job searching
skills and your qualifications. Com
puter programming jobs will be far
easier to find than jobs related to
music. This is true in good and bad
times and is related to the laws of
supply and demand. Don't be sur
prised if you find more computer sci
ence jobs in the database than jobs
for musicians.
Depending on the type of job you
are seeking, you may have to be
more proactive, taking the initiative
to contact employers for opportuni

ties. Definitely, in this current eco
nomic situation, you will need to
work harder and more efficiently to
secure jobs. The good news is that the
CDC career counselors are available
to prepare you for the job search and
to help you develop a tailored strate
gy to fit your goals.
Thirdly. I want to assure students
that the CDC seeks to support stu
dents not only in computer science,
education and law. hut students in all
arenas. We have career counselors
who specialize in arts, media, com
munication, engineering, public serv
ice, international careers, education,
business and environment/sustain
ability. Each of these counselors
maintains a web site for their special
ty at http://cardinalcareers.stan
ford.edu/research/exploring.htm
and sends out a targeted newsletter.
The CDC Resource Center.
http://cardinalcareers.stanford.edu/li
brary/, has a wealth of books and on
line subscriptions to support any job
seeker. Panels about various career
fields are organized. For the past two
years, the CDC has partnered with
The Daily to create special career
sections each quarter, highlighting
different fields. The CDC strives to
support all job seekers.
Fourthly, I also want to highlight
some key job/internship databases.
There area lot of "job sites" available
on the Internet and the quality of op
portunities listed can vary greatly.

First is Cardinal Careers
(https://stanford-csm.symplicity.
com/students/). Embedded in Cardi
nal Careers, the CDC s online sys
tem, are three valuable databases. —
Jobs for Stanford Students and
Alumni, has full-time, internship,
part-time and volunteer opportuni
ties. The majority of the jobs are
Stanford specific.
— NACELink Alumni Network is
an excellent site that gives appli
cants access to jobs posted on com
pany Web sites. Considering that
most jobs are not posted on the job
boards, accessing company Web sites
is key to most job strategies. Also,
your searches will access listings
from indeed.com and
simplyhired.com, two very powerful
job aggregator sites. When 1 search
the word "music." 1 generate over
500 jobs on Job Central, 26,625 jobs
on simplyhired.com and 15.016 jobs
on indeed.com.
— Employer Database is a database
of employers who have posted jobs
or attended career fairs over the past
few years. Considering that they
have a history and connection with
Stanford University, 1 would use the
database to identify potential em
ployers for job/internship opportuni
ties.
Students should also look into
iNet Internship Consortium
(https://inet-csm.symplicity.com/stu
dents/).The iNet Internship Network

is an internship listing shared by
eight selective universities. USC will
be added to this network later this
academic year.
Other Web Resources (http://car
dinalcareers.stanford.edu/links/)
may also be helpful. This is a data
base of Web sites organized by career
field and geographic region. While
most non-specific Stanford jobs
could be found through Job Central.
there are niche job sites that may be
valuable to your job search.
Finally, the editorial made a num
ber of comments about the online
system. Cardinal Careers. Most of
the complaints attributed to the
CDC are the responsibility of the
employers with whom we work. The
employer decides what majors they
wish to screen for, the employer en
ters their job descriptions into the
system and the employer determines
anv changes in deadlines — not the
CDC.
1 encourage students to visit our
Web site at cardinalcareers.stan
ford.edu. Better yet. they can make
an appointment to meet with the
CDC's great career counselors at
(650) 725-1789. If students have
feedback about how the CDC could
better serve you, they should feel
free to contact me directly at
lchoy@stanford.edu.
