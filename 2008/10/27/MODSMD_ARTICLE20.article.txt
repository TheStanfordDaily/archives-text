# Stanford stranded in the desert
## Men's soccer drops seventh one-goal game of season in 2-1 loss at New Mexico 
### WILL DOOLEY 
The Cardinal's season-long woes continued for men's
soccer this past weekend in Albuquerque, N.M., despite a
strong offensive performance. Stanford fell 2-1 on Friday to
New Mexico.
The defeat was the team's seventh one-goal loss of the
season as the deciding goal was once again scored late in
the second half — another cruelly close loss for a team that
has sustained plenty in 2008.
Stanford (3-8-2) jumped out to a strong start when
fifth-year senior Tom Montgomery notched his third goal
of the season. Montgomery, a true walk-on who has be
come one of Stanford's most reliable players, is now tied
for the team lead in goals. He scored unassisted as his
quick cut across the top of the penalty box was followed
by a hard, low shot that found the back of the net in the
29th minute.
New Mexico (7-5-2) quickly answered back with a goal
of its own a mere six minutes later when P.J.Wilson scored
on a strong volley.
The Lobos sealed the come-from-behind victory in the
83rd minute. Michael Green sprang Justin Davis through
the Cardinal defense, and David struck a one-tinier off the
pass that bounced off the crossbar and into the net.
After the game. Stanford coach Bret Simon couldn't
help but wonder when his team's luck would change — an
other sign of the frustrations mounting from a season of
close defeats and narrow misses.
"When will the law of averages go our way?" he won
dered.
The game was certainly frustrating in light of the fine
performance that was put forth by the Cardinal offense.
Sophomore Garret Gunther twice was stopped on one
on-one opportunities, and two shots were blocked by

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal's inability to finish haunted it once again
against the Lobos, as the team lost its seventh one-goal game of the

Stanford worked New Mexico's keeper Brie Staver hard,
forcing him to come up with six saves, total.for the game.
"Everybody's frustrated."Simon said."But all the guys
on the team played very hard. I have to give a huge amount
of credit to the guys, for playing like it was the national
championship."
Freshman Cullen Wilson played a strong7l minutes.tal
lying two shots on goal in his first collegiate start. Simon
praised him after the game, referring to the talented first
year player as "a thorn in the side of New Mexico's de
fense."
Stanford has not suffered seven one-goal losses since
the 2005 season, when the Cardinal men amassed the
same total en route to a 4-11-3 finish. In the last nine
games. Stanford is I -7-1, with no game being decided by
more than one goal. In fact, only twice in the 15 games
that Stanford has played has there been a final goal dif
ferential of more than one.
Despite the hard luck, the team has never let up — a
positive sign in a season that is quickly winding down. It's a
sign that Simon takes strongly to heart despite all the disap
pointments of the year.
"Even after their second goal, the guvs fought like crazy
to the very last second," Simon said."ln the end. the most
important thing is they laid it on the line. I'm very proud of
them for that."
Stanford now faces a week of downtime to retool and re
cuperate before it travels to San Diego State on Friday for a
I lalloween showdown with the A/tecs.'llie ( ardinal will be
looking to split the season series after suffering a 1-0 home
loss against San I )iego State earlier in the season.
Following the rematch in Southern California, the
Cardinal men will have just four games remaining on
their schedule for 2008, as they will travel to UCLA on
Nov. 2 before returning to the Farm
to face Washington and Oregon State
on Nov. 7 and 9, respectively. Stan
ford will then close out its season
with a road game against archrival
California.
