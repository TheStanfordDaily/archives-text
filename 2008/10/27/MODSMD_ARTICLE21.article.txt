### KENAN JIANG STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men's water

contest against a very determined
No. 10 Long Beach State squad on
Saturday at Avery Aquatic Center.
The Cardinal improved to 3-0 in
the competitive Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) and
boosted iis record to 17 2 overall,
with its only two losses coming
against perennial contender and
national powerhouse No. I I JSC.
An energized crowd from the
Palo Alto and Stanford communi
ties cheered on the team at the
packed Avery Aquatic Center.
Stanford came out with a
vengeance in the second quarter
after I.ong Beach State spurred the
scoring when Pavle I ilipovic scored
in the left corner off a 4 ( Jers six-on
five power play. Stanford junior
Drac Wigo started the counterat
tack at the 6:25 mark with a goal in
the right corner. Then, in one of the
impressive plays of the game, his
brother, junior Janson Wigo. threw
a perfectly timed pass over all the
opposing defenders to two-meter
senior Will I lindle-Katel. who was
ahead of the pack and put it past the
4 l )ers' goalkeeper at the 4:14 mark.
Drac Wigo scored again at the
3:IN mark off a powerful shot, and
senior Chris Jacobson cemented
the lead with 13 seconds left in the
half, scoring on a strong volley into
the left corner of the net. Stanford

GAME NOTES: Stanford moved to 17-2 on
the year and 3-0 in MPSF play. The team
was led by junior Drac Wigo, who had
four goals on the day. Junior goalkeeper
Jimmie Sandman kept Ihe 49ers offense at
bay with 10 saves.

went into the half leading 5-2.
I.ong Beach State played tough
defense as Stanford had trouble
getting the ball inside for easy looks
at the net. Similarly, Stanford re
sponded with a stout defensive ef
fort, continually shutting down the
49ers' offense.
Stanford's aggressive defense
left Long Beach with no shot at
tempts over a span of four minutes
during the second quarter, due to
mistimed passes caused by a deter
mined Stanford defense led by
goalkeeper Jimmie Sandman, and
two-meter defenders I lindle-Katel
and freshman Peter Sefton.
"Mv mentality as a two-meter

defender is to come in off the bench
and do everything I can to not let the
man I am guarding score," Sefton
said.
With the beginning of the second
half, Hindle-Katel took advantage of
another power-play goal. Stanford
was awarded 10 six-on-five situations
on the day, scored in five of them and
also capitalized on both of its five
meter penalty shots.
Long Beach State's scoring
drought was made all the more no
ticeable when Andrew Drake scored
at the 1:37 mark in the third period. It
was not until 49ers' Jeff Greenwood
scored with a minute left to go that
Long Beach managed to snap out of
it. Long Beach State's Jake Kinne
scored again for the 49ers with 23 sec
onds left in the third period to make
the score 9-4. Overall, though, Stan
ford's defense took a noticeable toll
on the 49ers' offensive rhythm.
The fourth quarter started with a
Greenwood goal at the 7:25 mark
bringing the score to 10-5. But Drac
Wigo, who went on to be the game's
leading scorer at four goals, put in an
other goal at 7:08. A five-goal deficit
was as close as the 49ers were able to
get over the remainder of the game.
Junior Ryan McCarthy scored

twice in the fourth period to cement
the final score at 13-7. Long Beach
State, 0-4 against MPSF opponents
and 9-12 overall, played a gritty
game against Stanford, but was
clearly outmatched on the offensive

Sandman, who directed many of the
team's counterattacks and solid de
fense as the goalkeeper, anchored the
Cardinal defense.
Sandman had 10 saves on the day
as Long Beach had no answers for the

tributed to Stanford's goal tally.
Stanford's next game will he at
UC-Davis this Thursday at 5 p.m.
