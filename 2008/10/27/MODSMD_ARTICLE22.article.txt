# Jankovic yanks top spot
## 
### 
It's official — Jelena Jankovic will
end Ihe 2008 season as No. I in
women's tennis with a command
ing lead over No. 2 Dinara Safina.
But without a Grand Slam title
under her belt, does the 23-year-old
Serbian truly deserve the title of best
player this year on the women's
tour?
During the season, players accu
mulate points based on how they
fare in individual rounds of a tourna
ment and essentially how "big" a
tournament is. At the pinnacle of the
sport are four Grand Slam events,
which net the most points. Women's
Tennis Association (WTA) rankings
are subsequently based on these
points — the more you have, the
higher you are ranked.
Since computerized rankings
were enacted by the WTA in 1975, IS
different women have earned the top
singles ranking. Of these IK, three
had not won a Grand Slam tourna
ment at the time they reached the
lop spot: Kim ( lijisters.Amelie Mau
resmo and Jankovic.
Reaching No. I in 2003, Clijisters
would capture the 2005 U.S. Open,
