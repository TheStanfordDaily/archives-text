# Jankovic yanks top spot
## 
### 
It's official — Jelena Jankovic will
end Ihe 2008 season as No. I in
women's tennis with a command
ing lead over No. 2 Dinara Safina.
But without a Grand Slam title
under her belt, does the 23-year-old
Serbian truly deserve the title of best
player this year on the women's
tour?
During the season, players accu
mulate points based on how they
fare in individual rounds of a tourna
ment and essentially how "big" a
tournament is. At the pinnacle of the
sport are four Grand Slam events,
which net the most points. Women's
Tennis Association (WTA) rankings
are subsequently based on these
points — the more you have, the
higher you are ranked.
Since computerized rankings
were enacted by the WTA in 1975, IS
different women have earned the top
singles ranking. Of these IK, three
had not won a Grand Slam tourna
ment at the time they reached the
lop spot: Kim ( lijisters.Amelie Mau
resmo and Jankovic.
Reaching No. I in 2003, Clijisters
would capture the 2005 U.S. Open,

her sole Grand Slam championship.
Similarly, Mauresmo would reach
No. 1 in 2004, only to capture the
2006 Australian Open two years
later. And at 23, Jankovic is primed
to capture her first Slam very soon.
However, neither Clijisters nor
Mauresmo have finished a year at
No. 1, an honor that belonged to only
eight players before this year.
So by finishing at No. 1, Jankovic
joins the company of Chris Evert,
Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf,
Monica Seles, Martina Hingis, Lind
say Davenport, Serena Williams and
Justine Henin.
Quite a crowd, no?
If the names aren't enough, here's
how many Grand Slam titles they've
won in their career: Evert (18),
Navratilova (18), Graf (22), Seles
(9), Hingis (5), Davenport (3),
Williams (9) and Henin (7).
Okay, so maybe that's not entire
ly fair. Jankovic is just 23.
At the same age. here's how many

Slams the same players have won:
Evert (7), Navratilova (2), Graf (11),
Seles (all 9 titles), Hingis (all 5 titles),
Davenport (2). Williams (6) and
Henin (4).
Jankovic (0).
In the U.S. Open, Jankovic was
demolished by Williams, 6-4, 7-5 in
the finals. Advancing to the semifi
nals of the Australian Open and
French Open, Jankovic would lose to
eventual champions Maria Sharapo
va and Ana Ivanovic, respectively.
And at Wimbledon, Jankovic was
ousted easily in the fourth round.
That's the main argument against
Jankovic: she has not won on the
major stage of tennis. Can she even
tually win a Grand Slam and make a
name for herself in the history
books? Probably. Can we put her
name alongside the same eight
women just listed? No, and it's not
even close.
How then did Jankovic earn the
No. 1 ranking without netting a sin
gle Grand Slam victory?
Consistency.
Jankovic is 63-17 this year. She
has won four titles, and recently won
12 consecutive matches to net three
of her four titles: the China Open in

Beijing, the Porsche Tennis Grand
Prix in Stuttgart, Germany and the
Kremlin Cup in Moscow. Her display
of stamina and consistency through
out the tour and the Olympics defi
nitely deserves notice.
Still, I'm not convinced.
Let's look at how Jankovic fared
against the runners-up to the title.
Jankovic lost to Safina in their only
matchup of the year in the semifinals
of the East West Bank Classic. Safina
would advance to win one of her four
titles on the year.
Against her countrywoman,
Jankovic lost twice to Ivanovic in the
semifinals of the Pacific Life Open
and the French Open, two major
tournaments on the tour. And
against Williams, Jankovic was 1-2,
with two finals losses at the Sony Er
icsson Open and the U.S. Open.
Sure, Jankovic has won more
often than anyone else during the
year and deserves praise for her con
sistent play. But, her resulting rank
ing is a by-product of the WTA's em
phasis on quantity over quality.
Jankovic has yet to show that she
can beat a top-ranked player on
some of tennis' biggest stages. The
No. 1 ranking deserves a more domi

nant player the likes of Evert,
Navratilova, Graf, Seles, Hingis,
Davenport, Williams and Henin.
My apologies to Jankovic, but she
has not yet arrived at that level of
dominating play.
At the same time, it is not
Jankovic's fault entirely.The fact that
she was able to finish at No. 1 without
the major win says much about the
WTA tour. With Henin's sudden re
tirement and William's disappoint
ing lack of focus on the tour,
Jankovic was almost handed the No.
1 ranking. In fact, had Safina (who
has yet to win a Grand Slam singles
title also) finished at No. 1, we would
have the same conversation.
It's definitely hard to write any
thing bad about the 23-year-old
Jankovic. As one of the nicest and
most charismatic players on the tour,
she has won over many fans world
wide. But at the same time, she has
yet to pay her dues to the game.
Hopefully, she'll be able to do so in
2009 as the incumbent No. 1.
