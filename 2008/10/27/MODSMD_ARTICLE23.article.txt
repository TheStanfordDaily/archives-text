## Phillies just one win away from World Series title 
### RONALD BLUM ASSOCIATED PRESS 
PHILADELPHIA - Ryan Howard
knows this place will go nuts with one
more win.
"It will be absolute bedlam," he said.
"It will be one of the craziest places on
earth. It's kind of scary to imagine."
Then again, who would've guessed
Phillies pitcher Joe Blanton would
shut his eyes, take a huge swing and
sock a ball into the seats.
Blanton became the first pitcher in
34 years to homer in the World Series,
Howard drove in five runs with two

homers and Philadelphia romped over
the Tampa Bay Rays 10-2 on Sunday
night to move within one win of its first
title since 1980.
The team of 10.(XX) losses could
give title-starved Philadelphia its first
champion in any of the four big sports
since the NBA's 76ers in 1983.
"A championship is the only way to
fully reverse that thought of how the
Phillies are portrayed," said Jimmy
Rollins, who sparked the Phillies with
three hits and three runs."lf we get that
game, I believe we will be happy, the
city will be happy, there will be a big pa
rade,"

Jayson Werth also homered as the
Phillies took a 3-1 lead in the best-of
seven Series and thrilled their frustrat
ed, long-suffering fans.
"I didn't really buy into the whole
thing about the city and the drought
and all that kind of stuff," Howard said.
Cole Hamels will try to close out
the Phillies' second Series title on
Monday night against Scott Kazmir in
a rematch of Game 1 starters. Hamels
(4-0) is trying to become the first pitch
er to win five postseason starts in one
year.
Of the 42 teams to take 3-1 World
Series leads.36 have gone on to win the

crown. After splitting the first two
games in Florida, the Phillies improved
to 6-0 at Citizens Bank Park this post
season. That includes a wacky, rain-de
layed 5-4 win in Game 3 that ended at
1:47 a.m. Sunday.
"Cole looks for these moments. I
call him Hollywood, because when the
lights are on, that's when he's at his
best," Rollins said. "And tomorrow
night, the lights will definitely be on."
Rollins made a great escape from a
rundown in the first inning — perhaps
with the help of an umpire's blown call
— energizing the Phillies and rattling
the Rays.
