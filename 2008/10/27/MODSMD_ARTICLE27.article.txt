SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — At least
64.000 people from all 50 states and more
than 20 foreign countries have given money
to support or oppose a same-sex marriage
ban in California, reflecting broad interest
in a race viewed by some as second in na
tional importance only to the presidential
election.
Ten days before the vote on Proposition
8. campaign finance records show that total
contributions for and against the measure
have surpassed $60 million, according to an
analysis by The Associated Press.
That would be a record nationally for a
ballot initiative based on a social rather
than economic issue, campaign finance ex
perts say. It also eclipses the combined total
of $33 million spent in the 24 states where
similar measures have been put to voters

since 2004.
If approved by California voters. Propo
sition 8 would overturn a state Supreme
Court ruling that legalized same-sex mar
riages by changing the state constitution to
limit marriage to a man and a woman.
Campaign committees formed to respec
tively back and battle the amendment were
close in fundraising as of Oct. 25, AP's
analysis found. Supporters have raised at
least $28.2 million, while opponents have
taken in $32.3 million, closing a fundraising
gap that had them $8 million behind a
month ago.
Hie figures for each side are actually
higher because these totals do not include
most donations under $100 and contribu
tions under $ 1,000 since Oct. 18.
The measure is likely to attract more
money than any race other than the billion
dollar presidential election, judging by cam
paign-finance data from other high-profile
contests. The closest appears to be the U.S.

Senate race in Minnesota, at $35 million.
"I'm surprised how much they are spend
ing because I would have thought 90 per
cent of the people would have made up
their minds on this issue," said Robert Stern,
president of the nonpartisan Center for
Governmental Studies. "But if this is a close
race, that undecided 10 percent will decide
the election. Every dollar, in a sense,
counts."
The money pouring into the 13 commit
tees promoting or challenging the measure
has come from prominent religious conser
vatives and gay rights activists. Hollywood
actors and moguls, teachers and CEOs.
Individuals who identified themselves as
retirees and homemakers accounted for the
most donations, giving over $11 million.
Sell-identified lawyers gave $2.3 million.
On the Yes side. Knights of Columbus,
based in New Haven. Conn., is the mea
sure's largest single contributor so far. hav
ing given $1.4 million.
