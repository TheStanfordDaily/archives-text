The United Nations Association Film
Festival (UNAFF) came to campus from
Oct. 19 to 26, featuring 41 documentaries in
Annenberg Auditorium and in theaters
around Palo Alto. This year was the 11th
year that UNAFF has screened documen
taries. drawing attention to social, econom
ic and environmental issues around the
world.
The documentaries this year offered per
spectives from over 40 countries, detailing
problems from the current crisis in Darfur

and its parallels to the Holocaust in "This
Time We Can't Say We Didn't Know," to
China's transition from communism to cap

UNAFF is a traveling non-profit film fes
tival that makes its rounds nationally and
internationally, showing many screenings in
the California area. Established in 1998.
UNAFF is one of the oldest documentary
festivals in the U.S.
UNAFF founder and Executive Director
Jasmina Bojic wrote in her welcoming letter
that the festival's goal was to "engage the
entire community and beyond." According

to Bojic. the festival "promotes docu
mentary filmmaking as a tool lor
encouraging social, cultural and politi
cal understanding."
A theme for the film festival is cho
sen each year, with this year's concen
tration being "Blue Planet. Green

Planet." But while the theme was environ
mental awareness, many of the films encom
passed other issues.
"Environmentalist!! is a huge component
of the films this year." said volunteer
Bradley Heinz *09. "UNAFF uses environ
mentally aware products."

Heinz added that the pens being
used by volunteers have soy ink and are
compostable, while the T-shirts being sold
are half-plastic bottles, half-recycled cotton.
Heinz went on to explain how the docu
mentaries are chosen through a jury selec
tion process.
