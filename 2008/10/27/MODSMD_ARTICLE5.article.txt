# SENIORS CELEBRATE
## BUT FOUR FRESHMEN SCORE GOALS AS CARD STAYS UNDEFEATED 
### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
The No. 5 Stanford women's soccer
team sent its seniors off in style this
weekend, defeating Arizona and Arizona
State 3-1 and 5-0, respectively. This week
end's games were the final home games
of the regular season, and with the two
victories, the Cardinal completed an
unbeaten home slate for the year.
Like many of the Cardinal's matches
this season, the team started rather slow
ly against Arizona on Friday. The
Wildcats got off the game's first two
shots, as Stanford seemed out of synch for
the first 10 minutes of the match.
But the intensity soon picked up. as
the Cardinal defense took over with a
couple of tough tackles and the offense
fired five shots in seven minutes.The best
of these chances came when junior for
ward Kelley O'Hara made room on the
right and sent a low cross to fellow junior
Kristin Stannard in the box.The midfield
er's shot, however, was straight at
Arizona keeper Chelsea Mclntyre.
Hie team continued to press, as fresh
man Lindsay Taylor forced a good save in
the 27th minute and O'l lara headed over
the bar from close range a minute later.
With just five minutes left in the half,
freshman Teresa Noyola saw her goal
bound free kick pushed away by a diving
Mclntyre. The half would end 0-0. and
although Ari/ona wasn't playing poorly.

5:00 PM.
GAME NOTES; Sunday's game against the Sun
Devils was Senior Day for the Cardinal - seven
seniors were honored. It was the freshmen who
shined, however, as four of them got on the score
board for Stanford. Stanford is still undefeated on
the season with a record of 16-0-1.

Stanford's 15-5 shot advantage was a
good indicator of who had been in con
trol.
Hie Cardinal came out flying in the
second half as sophomore forward
Christen Press beat three defenders and
blasted just wide only two minutes after
the restart. The team would get on the
score sheet just two minutes later. Noyola
picked up the ball near the center of the
pitch and strode forward before releasing
to Taylor near the top of the box. Taylor
ran onto the ball and calmly slotted past
Mclntyre to put the Cardinal in front.

Senior Kate Mannino fights for position against an opponent from Arizona State on Sunday.
Mannino was one of seven seniors to be honored during the Cardinal's 5-0 win on Senior Day.
Both teams had clear chances
within a minute of the goal, as junior
fullback Ali Riley had to clear a ball
off the goal line for Stanford, and on
the other end of the field, O'Hara saw
her one-on-one chance against the
goalkeeper blocked away by Mcln
tyre. On the ensuing corner kick, sen
ior defender Marsia Abegg saw her
header bounce off the crossbar.
Stanford would double its advan
tage in the 63rd minute courtesy of
some beautiful passing. Stannard
played a one-two with O'Hara to get
into the box and then laid the ball to
Press in the center. The forward
thought about a shot but instead
passed to an open Noyola on the
right, and the freshman buried it in
the corner.
It was 3-0 four minutes later as
Levin's through ball from the top of
the box narrowly beat the offsides
trap and Taylor finished for her sec
ond goal of the game and 14t of the
season.
Arizona would get one back when
it was awarded a penalty kick in the
74th minute, and Karina Camacho
put it right down the middle as Stan
ford keeper Kira Maker dove to her
left. But, in the end, it was too little
too late, as the game would end 3-1.
The Cardinal women next took on
Arizona State on Sunday afternoon,
and unlike Friday, the team was the
aggressor from the start. O'Hara was
causing all sorts of problems for the
Sun Devil backline, and she was re
warded with a goal in the 19th
minute. Senior defender Allison Falk
picked out O'Hara with a long ball
from her own half and O'Hara ran
onto it and beat the keeper to open
the scoring.
Falk almost doubled the lead just
three minutes later, only to see her
header from a corner kick hit the
crossbar. However, Taylor would
stretch the margin to two in the 29th
minute with a spectacular goal. Going

away from goal, the freshman con
trolled a header near the top of the
box, cut the ball to her left foot and
curled a beauty into the top left cor
ner of the net. Stanford continued to
push for the rest of the half, but the
score remained 2-0 going into half
time.
After 10 minutes of the second
half, the lead was 4-0. In the 49th
minute. Levin charged forward from
midfield and curled a long-range ef
fort right over the keeper. Six minutes
later, Press cut inside from the left
and fed Noyola in the center, who
tucked away an open shot.
Stanford coach Paul Ratcliffe soon
put in all of his seniors — who had
been honored before the game for Se
nior Day — for one last chance to all
play together on their home field, but
it was a freshman who put the excla
mation point on the victory. With two
minutes left in the match, freshman
midfielder Kristy Zurmuhlen scored
her first career goal on a half volley to
make the final score 5-0.
"I'm really proud of the team."
Ratcliffe said. "I thought they played
really well, scored some great goals,
and overall the entire team just
played some great soccer this week
end."
The Cardinal will now hit the road
for its final three games of the regular
season, before the NCAA Tourna
ment begins in mid-November.
