### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
The No. 5 Stanford women's soccer
team sent its seniors off in style this
weekend, defeating Arizona and Arizona
State 3-1 and 5-0, respectively. This week
end's games were the final home games
of the regular season, and with the two
victories, the Cardinal completed an
unbeaten home slate for the year.
Like many of the Cardinal's matches
this season, the team started rather slow
ly against Arizona on Friday. The
Wildcats got off the game's first two
shots, as Stanford seemed out of synch for
the first 10 minutes of the match.
But the intensity soon picked up. as
the Cardinal defense took over with a
couple of tough tackles and the offense
fired five shots in seven minutes.The best
of these chances came when junior for
ward Kelley O'Hara made room on the
right and sent a low cross to fellow junior
Kristin Stannard in the box.The midfield
er's shot, however, was straight at
Arizona keeper Chelsea Mclntyre.
Hie team continued to press, as fresh
man Lindsay Taylor forced a good save in
the 27th minute and O'l lara headed over
the bar from close range a minute later.
With just five minutes left in the half,
freshman Teresa Noyola saw her goal
bound free kick pushed away by a diving
Mclntyre. The half would end 0-0. and
although Ari/ona wasn't playing poorly.

GAME NOTES; Sunday's game against the Sun
Devils was Senior Day for the Cardinal - seven
seniors were honored. It was the freshmen who
shined, however, as four of them got on the score
board for Stanford. Stanford is still undefeated on
the season with a record of 16-0-1.

Stanford's 15-5 shot advantage was a
good indicator of who had been in con
trol.
Hie Cardinal came out flying in the
second half as sophomore forward
Christen Press beat three defenders and
blasted just wide only two minutes after
the restart. The team would get on the
score sheet just two minutes later. Noyola
picked up the ball near the center of the
pitch and strode forward before releasing
to Taylor near the top of the box. Taylor
ran onto the ball and calmly slotted past
Mclntyre to put the Cardinal in front.
