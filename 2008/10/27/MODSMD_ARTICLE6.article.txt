## Google's Android released Possibility of future programming class 
### ELLIOTT JIN 
Last Tuesday, in an attempt to
break into the mobile phone arena.
Google released the first free, open
source operating system for mobile
devices. Dubbed Android, the oper
ating system will first be launched
on T-Mobile's new G1 Smartphone.
This past year. Google's Android
Developer Challenge offered $5
million in prizes as an incentive to
build Android applications. Google
also has plans to work with top uni
versities. including Stanford, to
develop Android teaching pro
grams.
Last spring. Prof. Hal Abelson of
MIT taught an experimental course.
Building Mobile Applications with
Android, and four MIT undergradu
ates won a $275.()(H) top prize in part
one of the Android Developer
Challenge for their term project.
The second part of Google's
Developer Challenger will launch
later this year and will offer an addi
tional $5 million in prize money.
Mehran Sahami PhD '98. com
puter science professor and former
research scientist at Google, is
working with Abelson and Google's
university relations group.
"We've been looking into doing
some educational work on an
Android platform," Sahami said.
"It's definitely an interesting plat
form from an educational stand
point because it has the potential to
excite students."
But don't expect anything soon.
"We don't have any plans for an
Android class this year." Sahami
added. "We would continue the dia
logue with Google to see if there's
something we could potentially do
next year, but it depends on
Stanford and Google coming to an
arrangement that could work for
both of us."
Sahami also said the possibility
of any such classes would be
dependent upon resources.
"For the iPhone class (CS 193P],
the instructors are actually Apple
employees who agreed to teach the
class." he said, "if there was a similar
arrangement that could be made
with Google, then we could offer a
class, but it's difficult for us to have
current faculty and resources devot
ed to teaching this platform."
Stanford students are involved
with Android as well. Symbolic sys
tems major Evie Gillie '10 is decid
ing whether to use Android or
Apple's iPhone for her final project
in CS 147, Intro to Human-
Computer Interactions.
"The i Phone is easy to use, but
with Android you can do a lot of
cool stuff yourself," Gillie said.
"Android is still so new that if you
get right in there with a new appli
cation. it could be a name-brand
thing."
However, Android's future is
uncertain, especially considering the
iPhone's current grasp of the mobile
phone market.
Kayvon Beykpour, teaching
assistant for CS 193P and founder of
Terriblyclever Design, said Android
in its current state could not com
pete with the iPhone.
"It's far too early to consider the
platform as being a competitor to
the iPhone," he said. "Android is
really new. Yes. it's open source, and
that bodes for some interesting
development. But right now. the
platform is far inferior."
As open source software.
Android's source code is freely
available for users to download and
modify.
"Because of its open-source

direction, the potential for Android
to get a pretty nice developer com
munity around it is high," Sahami
said. "But the developer community
for iPhone is larger because it's been
out longer. At the end of the day,
developers are drawn to a platform
that there are a lot of users for."
Hardware is another potential
obstacle for Android.
"I don't like the hardware of
Android, so I kind of want to wait
until something nicer comes out,"
Gillie said. "If they get the right
hardware to go with it, it could be
big."
Although Android may not yet
be a competitor for the iPhone,
Sahami said Google's Developer
Challenge is more about the educa
tional experience than about the
competition.
"We're not married to one or the
other," Sahami said. "We just want
something useful for exciting the
students and teaching them the
material on any platform."
