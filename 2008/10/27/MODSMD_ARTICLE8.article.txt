Republican John McCain declared "I'm
going to win it," dismissing polls showing
him behind with little more than a week to
go in the presidential race. A confident De
mocrat Barack Obama drew a jaw-drop
ping 100,000 people to a single rally and
rolled out a new TV ad asserting his rival is
"running out of time."
Heading into the final nine days of the
2008 contest, the White House competitors
campaigned in key battlegrounds that
President Bush won four years ago as the
state-by-state Electoral College map tilts
strongly in Obama's favor. Democrats and
Republicans alike say it will be extraordi
narily difficult for McCain to change the
trajectory of the campaign before the Nov.
4 election.
"Unfortunately, I think John McCain
might be added to that long list of Arizo
nans who ran for president but were never
elected," McCain's fellow senator from
Arizona, Republican Jon Kyi, told the Ari
zona Daily Star editorial board in an inter
view published Sunday.
The candidates sparred from a distance,
each criticizing the other anew in hopes of
swaying the roughly one-fourth of voters
who are undecided or could still change
their minds. The campaign trail images and
rhetoric said perhaps more about the state
of the race than any poll could.
In Colorado, Obama reveled in his
largest U.S. crowd to date, with local police
estimating that "well over" 100,000 people
packed Denver's Civic Center Park and
stretched even to the distant steps of the
state Capitol. The enthusiastic sea of peo
ple prompted a "goodness gracious" from
Obama as he took the stage. Another enor
mous swarm — an estimated 45,000 to
50,000 — greeted him in Fort Collins later
on the perhaps aptly named Colorado
State University lawn; it's known as "The
Oval."
At each rambunctious stop Obama
portrayed McCain as more of the same,
saying, "For eight years, we've seen the
Bush-McCain philosophy put our country
on the wrong track, and we cannot have

another four years that look just like the
last eight."
In Cedar Falls, lowa, McCain cam
paigned before a much smaller audience,
roughly 2,000 people, and chided his De
mocratic rival: "He's measuring the
drapes.... I prefer to let voters have their
say. What America needs now is someone
who will finish the race before starting the
victory lap."
Later, amid 5,000 people in Zanesville,
Ohio, McCain warned of the perils of one
party rule, targeting House Speaker Nancy
Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Harry

Reid as vigorously as Obama. "You can
imagine Obama, Reid and Pelosi," McCain
said. "Tax and spend, tax and spend."
As the day began. McCain cast Obama
as too liberal for a right-of-center country,
saying on NBC's "Meet the Press:" '"He
started out in the left-hand lane of Ameri
can politics and has remained there."
In coming days, both candidates will
focus primarily on Bush-won. vote-rich
battlegrounds like Ohio and Florida,
which decided the last two presidential
elections and could do so again.
Pennsylvania is the only state that De

mocrat John Kerry won four years ago that
both candidates are expected to visit be
fore Election Day. With 21 electoral votes,
it hasn't voted for a Republican president
since IWB, but McCain is aggressively
courting white, working-class voters who
overwhelmingly chose Democrat Hillary
Rodham Clinton in the primary over
Obama. who would become the country's
first black president.
