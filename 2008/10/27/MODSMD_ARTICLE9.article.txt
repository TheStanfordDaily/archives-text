### JOSEF FEDERMAN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
The leader of Israel's ruling party,
Tzipi Livni, gave up her attempts to
form a coalition government Sun
day, setting the stage for early elec
tions and diminishing hopes for
stalled peace talks with the Pales
tinians.

Israel now appears to be headed
toward months of politieal paralysis,
and opposition leader Benjamin Ne
tanyahu, a critic of the peace
process, is in a strong position to be
come the country's next leader. It
would be the third national election
in six years, reflecting the instability
of Israel's fractious political system.
Livni, who hopes to become Is
rael's first female prime minister in
three decades, has been trying to put
together a government since she re
placed the corruption-tainted Prime
Minister Ehud Olmert as head of the
ruling Kadima Party last month. But

partners in the current coalition,
which took power in May 2006.
pressed new demands.
In a meeting with President Shi
mon Peres broadcast live on national
TV. Livni said she did everything she
could to keep the government intact
but would not give in to what she
termed political blackmail.
She told Peres that "we'll go to
elections ... and 1 intend to win
them."
Elections for the 120-seat parlia
ment will likely take place in Febru
ary or March, a year and a half ahead
of schedule.
