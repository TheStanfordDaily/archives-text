## Editorial Financial aid students deserve equal chance to live on Row 
### 
Earlier this quarter, as reported by The
Daily ("Row board hills cause confu
sion," Oct. 22), five Row houses par
ticipated in a pilot program in which stu
dents' fall quarter board bills were incorpo
rated into their University bills. Next quar
ter. this new plan will be instituted for all
students living on the Row in an effort to
simplify the payment process. Students who
are new to living on the Row are oftentimes
caught unaware by the prospect of paying a
second hill, their board bill.after they've al
ready paid their University hill separately.
While the editorial board lauds the Uni
versity for incorporating the Row board
bill into the University hill, there is still
much to be done when it comes to making
the process easier for students.
Many students new to the Row are not
aware that their board bills must be paid in
dependently of their University bills and
that the costs of living associated with Row
houses tend to be substantially higher than
those associated with living in regular
dorms. For students on financial aid. this
can pose a serious problem. Even a few
hundred extra dollars per year can signifi
cantly impact the life of a student on finan
cial aid, especially when that money has to
be paid out of pocket.
Though board bills are due after the
University bills, they tend to be due so early
in the quarter that students who would nor
mally pay with work study money usually
have not accumulated sufficient work study
funds to do so. Because of this, some stu
dents have had to take out loans. Consider
ing the fact that the Financial Aid Office
(FAO) completely restructured its aid
packages last year so that students wouldn't
be faced with expensive loans as part of
their packages, the notion that students
must take out loans to pay something as
simple as their board bills is completely

ridiculous.
Furthermore, because of the same re
structuring. many students now receive too
much aid to be eligible for federal work
study, which makes paying their board bills
out of pocket even more difficult.
Currently, the FAO grants students on
financial aid an $11.182 allotment for room
and board for the year. While this amount is
perfect for a student living in. for example.
Branner Hall, it is inadequate for students
who choose to live on the Row, where room
and board is often more expensive.
Stanford's Financial Aid Office should
reassess the room and board allowance for
students on financial aid to more accurate
ly reflect the living costs students face
across different residents. Students should
never feel forced to live off the Row be
cause of the discrepancy in room and board
costs between living on the Row and else
where.
'ITie editorial board would like to com
mend the ASSU, particularly President
Jonnv Dorsey '09 and Vice President Fagan
Harris '09 for taking the initiative to push
for greater financial assistance for students
who choose to live on the Row. While the
incorporation of the board bill into the gen
eral University bill is the first step in reduc
ing confusion regarding board bills, there is
much more progress to be made when it
comes to making living on the Row feasible
for all students, and we're glad to see that
the ASSU recognizes this.
Though Director of Financial Aid Karen
Cooper acknowledged this discrepancy in
the Oct. 22 Daily article, we hope the Finan
cial Aid Office will go a step further and
begin to work towards ensuring that living
allowances more accurately reflect individ
ual students' living situations. When that
happens, there will truly be housing equali
ty for all undergraduates.
