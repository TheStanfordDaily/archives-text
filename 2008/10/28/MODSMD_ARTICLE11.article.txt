# Stu's Views
## The 						long and winding road to Barack Obama 
### 
Over the course of this too-long elec
tion, I've supported four candidates.
In 20()6. I originally supported Vir
ginia Governor Mark Warner, who dropped
out of the campaign very early. For about two
weeks after that. I supported Indiana Senator
Evan Bayh. who also left the campaign sud
denly. These two men represented what I still
value most in Democratic politicians: mana
gerial competence, centrism. a belief in free
markets and an assertive foreign policy. On
the day of the Feb. 5 super-primaries, Stu's
Views endorsed Senator Hillary Clinton for
the presidency.
I felt that her campaign most represented
the best of Democratic politics that I associat
ed with Warner and Bayh: resolutely centrist
and heavy on the policy. Eighteen million
people felt the same way. but Clinton was de
feated by a more charismatic candidate, with
a much better-funded and better-managed
campaign.
It was indeed a long and winding road to
supporting Sen. Barack Obama after
Hillary's defeat in June. Some of his support
ers on campus turned me off to a great de
gree; the idolization and Messiah-ification of
a politician seemed to be out of touch with re
ality. All those Facebook profile photos of a
pensive two-tone Obama looking upward did
not befit the seriousness and dignity of the
presidency. We must keep our politicians, and
our expectations of them, close to earth so
our hopes are not always dashed.
For several months, I considered writing
in Sen.Clinton on my meaningless California
ballot. But the political and global events of
the past two months have encouraged me to
cast my vote in favor of the man likely to be
the next President of the United States and
to be part of the re-conquest of the White
House.
Obama's performance in the debates —
I think he clearly won all three — was espe
cially remarkable. He was respectful, pa
tient, thoughtful and serious, the right mix
of qualities we need in the White House at
this uncertain time. McCain's clear con
tempt for Obama and lack of respect for his
opponent indicated an inability to deal with
opposition that is unacceptable in a presi
dential candidate.
I admittedly never seriously considered
voting for John McCain, who I still think is a

conservative masquerading as a moderate.
His pick of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin es
pecially indicates a spectacular lack of judg
ment and deep-set political cynicism that
make him a very poor choice for the office.
For all his emphasis on experience and princi
ple, he picked a running mate who had none
of either.
Obama, for his part, picked Sen. Joe
Biden, knowing that the "Biden bounce"
would be essentially zero.The fact that lie still
picked him over other contenders — I per
sonally preferred Bayh — who might have
brought more votes or states to the ticket is
admirable. Biden was picked for the right rea
sons— Obama liked and respected him —
rather than cynical political ones. Despite my
persistent urging in previous columns,
Obama also failed to select me (and the
catchiness of "Obama-Bainiel") despite my
strong pull among college students, a demo
graphic in which he clearly needs help.
What I most appreciate about Obama is
his thoughtfulness and judgment. Unlike the
impulsive, self-righteous, quick-to-anger Mc-
Cain, Obama has considered his positions
with an admirable sincerity. Indeed, he is the
most serious contender for the presidency in
recent memory; considering the enormity of
his task, his gravity and solemnity will prove
to be important attributes. My only worry is
that, with such high expectations, we will find
ourselves disappointed with what Obama can
do for us in light of the economy and the poor
state of the government's finances.
Obama has run the most impressive cam
paign since Ronald Reagan's 19K4 machine,
and his emphasis on organizing will pay a
huge dividend on Election Day. Ile will have
a mandate on Jan. 20, and I do believe he will
know what to do with it.

Stiiarl will he voting for Obama on Nov. 4th
