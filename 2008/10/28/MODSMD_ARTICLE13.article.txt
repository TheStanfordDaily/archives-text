unr he Jews have tailed to keep the
Lord's Commandments. Beware
A the Day of Judgment."
Thus began the 10-page, handwritten mis
sive that I received the other week, care of
Undergraduate Admission, from an unspeci
fied address in New York.
As far as I can figure, this letter must he
the result of a remark I made about my par
ticipation in various aspects of Jewish life at
Stanford while giving a campus tour to per
spective students. For most of my guests, this
comment probably went in one ear and out
the other. For one party, apparently, it stuck.
In the 48 hours after receiving this mail
ing, I reveled in self-righteous snarkiness.
Everyone within yelling radius of me was
subjected to a monologue about how grateful
I was for what was surely divine intervention.
For the first time, I realized that there was
more to life than laundering money, boiling
the blood of Christian babies and controlling
the media! I resolved immediately to write a
letter to Satan, sent care of AC/DC, telling
him that unfortunately I would no longer be
attending his orgy/kegger/Harry Potter Fan
Club meeting in hell that evening.
Eventually, however, the novelty wore off
("orgy slash kegger slash Harry Potter Fan
Club meeting" is a mouthful, even for me).
As much as I wanted to discount the anony
mous letter as nothing more than the scrib
blingsof a deranged bigot, I had to admit that
it forced me to think.
Fundamentally, I cherish the right of my
countrymen to express opinions different
from mine. The letter wasn't technically a
personal attack; it made no direct threat on
me besides eternal damnation, which thank
fully isn't in the hands of its author.
In fact, the letter may well have been mo
tivated by a genuine — if. in my opinion,
highly misguided — desire to do good by

helping me.
Doing good is one of those things that
should be easy, but is not. In the name of
doing good, we start wars, send hate mail and
bake each other casseroles. (I hate
casseroles; Don't ever bake me one.) We
can't get it into our heads that people who be
lieve or act differently than we do aren't irra
tional or ignorant, so we indefatigably con
tinue arguing, imagining that eventually our
opponents will admit that we are superior be
ings and therefore right about everything.
I respect the right of others to believe, or
not, as they choose, but how should I react to
someone who practices their faith in a way
that insults mine?
'ITie Northern California public elemen
tary school system told me that all we have to
do is really talk to each other, and then we
will realize that we are all the same deep
down inside, and we will braid flowers into
our hair and sit in a circle and laugh with joy
at the beauty of the world.
Outside of Theta Chi special dinner, this
will never happen.
Case in point: The conviction that there's
only one way to be a good and principled per
son makes no sense to me. Talk to me for as
long as you like, but I will never be able to re
spect proselyti/.ers, just like I will never re
spect Facebook stalkers, Palin supporters or
football-non-cheer-ers (whenever those

games are, anyway).
What I can respect, however, is the right
to hold these opinions and beliefs, and the
right to voice them (or not). Provided, of
course, that I am allowed my say. A week
from today, we will he collectively choosing
what we want this country to look like for
the next four years. No matter what is decid
ed. we're all going to have to confront the
fact that we have wildly differing opinions
on the issue.
More dialogue isn't necessarily the solu
tion. After so many months of heated opin
ion-sharing, we've had more than enough,
and I doubt many people's minds have actu
ally been changed. Make no mistake, I am not
advocating giving up your opinions just for
the sake of agreeing with someone else. Hut,
maybe we should all just get a little more will
ing to consider that others might have rea
sons for believing what they do and leave it at
that.
Diversity of opinion increases our collec
tive wealth of experience. Even before we all
became members of the Stanford communi
ty, we could intuitively sense this. It's why I
left an insular theater school for a university,
and why you came here instead of going to
M.I.T. We might not always agree, but hope
fully, every now and then, we make each
other think.
If I knew the identity of my new friend in
New York. I would recommend that he or she
finds a more productive hobby than sending
proselytizing letters. Sudoku, maybe? But I'd
also like to thank them for reminding me,
paradoxically, that just like High School Mu
sical said, we're all in this together.

Jenna actually hates HSM so much that she has
never seen it. She also hates Kevin Webb, which
is why she assaulted him twice. He deserved it.
