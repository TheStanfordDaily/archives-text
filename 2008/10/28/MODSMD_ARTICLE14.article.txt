## GUIDING THE SHIP 79 wins and counting for Ratcliffe 
### BY SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe has the whole coaching thing
down pat. You want results? He has led the women's soccer
team to back-to-back Sweet 16 appearances in the NCAA Tour
nament and a record of 16-0-1 (6-0-0 Pacific-10 Conference) this

And as for style points,
the Cardinal has one of the
most aggressive, effective
offenses in the country,
highlighted by its goals per
game average of 3.29 —
fifth-best in the nation. Rat
cliffe was honored this
weekend after surpassing
Berhane Andeberhan's
school record of 77 victo
ries, and is now the win
ningest coach in Stanford
history with 79 career wins.
It hasn't always been so
easy for Ratcliffe. In 2003,
his first year on the Farm

"The first goal has to be
to win a Pac-10 and
national title, and then
we'll want to do it again."

after five successful years at St. Mary's, the team went 10-9-2 and lost in the
first round of the NCAA Tournament. The next two years were a little bet
ter, with a combined record of 23-13-6.
The team finally broke through in Ratcliffe's fourth year. The Cardinal
went 15-6-2 in 2006 and made the Round of 16 in the NCAA Tournament,
losing to Clemson on penalty kicks. Stanford lost in the Sweet 16 again in
2007, but improved upon its overall record and lost only three games the en
tire season. For part of the year, the Cardinal was ranked No. 1 in the country.
This season, Stanford has dominated every opponent that has crossed its
path — save for a 1-1 draw with No. 2 North Carolina. The team has
outscored the opposition 56-5 and has the second-best winning percentage in

the country, behind only top-ranked Notre Dame (18-0-0).
How did Ratcliffe orchestrate his program's dramatic improvement?
Though the coach says there have always been talented players on the Farm,
it took time for Ratcliffe to shape the program as he wanted through recruit
ing.
"Every coach has their own picture in their head of what their team will
look like," Ratcliffe said."This is actually the first year that I've had the entire
team just how I want it."
Ratcliffe downplayed his recruiting abilities, saying that the University it
self attracts great athletes. I le seemed almost embarrassed to talk about his
new record after becoming the program's most successful coach.

"It's a nice honor, but... really it's all about the players." he said. "They
make everything happen. I just want to make sure I'm doing the best job I can
to help the players do well."
Although he credits them for much of his success, his players are quick to
give that praise right back to their coach.
"He has an incredible knowledge of the game and can adjust the team
under any circumstances," said sophomore midfielder Allison McCann.
"whether that's moving players around or just explaining to us what we need
to do differently to make things work."

The seniors of the Stanford women's soccer team are just the third group that head coach Paul Ratcliffe has coached for a full four years. Ratcliffe's career
win total now stands at a school-record 79, and he is poised to add to it when the Cardinal travels to Los Angeles this weekend.
