## Injuries force frosh, sophomores into spotlight in annual wrestle-offs 
### ZOE LEAVITT 
In Saturday's wrestle-offs at
Burnham Pavilion, Cardinal
wrestlers got their first chance of the
season to prove themselves under
pressure. After weeks of practice
and endless drills, the squad was
primed and ready for some intense
competition as 15 wrestlers took
part in eight matches to determine
the season's starting lineups.
The winners will represent Stan

ford against Cal State-Bakersfield
in the season opener on Nov. 8.
Several injuries made the start
ing lineups less certain and gave the
freshmen and sophomores an op
portunity to show off their skills. Six
freshmen competed for the first
time, and all are expected to be key
contributors this year.
"People might not be expecting
as much because they don't know
[these newcomers'] names," first
year Stanford coach Jason Borrelli

said, "but I'm very, very excited.
Since freshmen are the building
blocks of the team, they're the fu
ture."
Borrelli's faith in his young ath
letes seemed justified from the start.
Freshman Matt Sencebaugh took
the 125-pound weight class title
from sophomore Austin Quales in a
decisive 12-0 victory. Sencebaugh, an
Auburn. Wash.-native who wrestled
in several weight classes during high
school and took the state title at 119
pounds as a junior, will be the only
starting newcomer at Bakersfield.
At 133 pounds, redshirt sopho
more Justin Paulsen defeated soph
omore Porfirio Madrigal, 5-3.
Madrigal started in the same weight
class last year and will be expected
to contribute again this season.
Paulsen redshirted last season due
to injury, but regained the starting
spot he held as a freshman by beat
ing out Madrigal.
At 141 pounds, sophomore
Cameron Teitelman notched the
only win by fall of the wrestle-offs.
The victory came against freshman
Jason Torres at the 2:01 mark.Teitle
man competed at 133 pounds in the
Pac-10 championship as a freshman,
and he returns to the team after red
shirting his sophomore year.
Moving up from the 141 pound
class where he started last year,
sophomore Max Rosefigura defeat
ed freshman Michael Kent 5-2 for
the starting spot at 149 pounds. In
the 165-pound weight class, redshirt
sophomore Lucas Espericueta, who
planned to wrestle at 157 pounds
this year, beat freshman Spence
Patrick, 6-3. Espericueta started in
the 149-pound class his freshman
year and moved up in weight to
compete this season.
Redshirt freshman Nick
Amuchastegui beat true freshman
Victor Haug 13-1 in the 174-pound
class. Sophomore Kyle Barrett won
K-l over freshman Kyler Hasson at
IX4 pounds. Hasson also battled for
the 197-pound spot, but fell to junior
veteran starter Jake Johnson. Red
shirt freshman Matt Winterbourne
will wrestle as a heavyweight.
Several veteran wrestlers are out
with injuries but are expected to re
turn later in the season. As a result,
the starting lineup as determined on
Sunday will likely change.
Four starters are out after having
