# Does anybody care? Steroids and the NFL
## 
### 
D id you hear about the latest steroids scandal?
It's pretty heavy stuff. At least half a dozen players,
many of them stars, are being investigated for using a
banned substance.
Oh, you missed it? It wasn't a headline on Sports Ce
nter? There wasn't an uproar in the media and across the
country?
That's odd. But oh, I see why: it happened in the NFL,
not MLB.
That's right: What is arguably the biggest steroid scan
dal, at least since the Mitchell Report, broke this week
end, and it was buried. If you don't avidly browse the
sports wires, there is a perfectly good chance that you
could have missed it altogether.
Here's what happened: Between six and 10 players
tested positive for Bumetanide. a banned substance that
is ostensibly a weight-loss pill but is in actuality a mask
ing agent for steroids.The players' names were supposed
to be kept confidential until the NFL completed their in
vestigation. but they quickly leaked. To the surprise of
many, the individuals were not marginal players who
used steroids to get an edge over others trying to make a
team — in fact, a number of these men were stars.
One was Deuce McAllister, the starting running back
for the New Orleans Saints. McAllister is a two-time Pro
Bowler and has four 1 ,()(K)-yard seasons to his name. Will
Smith, McAllister's Saints teammate, was also on the list.
Smith — the starting right defensive end — recently
signed a contract extension worth $70 million, making
him one of the most highly paid defensive players in the
game. And that's not all: The Saints' other starting end,
Charles Grant, also tested positive.
Two Minnesota Vikings — Kevin and Pat Williams —
also used Bumetanide. Together, these two defensive
tackles form the so-called "Williams Wall." The
Williamses have earned a reputation as perhaps the most
formidable interior line duo in the league. Both made the
2007 Pro Bowl.
All five players, along with the Houston Texans'
Bryan Pittman and other still-unnamed athletes, will
likely face at least a four-game suspension.
Let's take a step back and imagine if three starters
(including two stars) from the Boston Red Sox tested
positive for steroids; for example. David Ortiz, Dustin
Pedroia and Coco Crisp. And let's also say that a top
double-play tandem — such as the Philadelphia
Phillies' Jimmy Rollins and Chase Utley — was found
guilty as well.
Imagine the pandemonium that would ensue.
The rest of the sports world would cease to exist. For
24 hours a day, it would be all the ESPN experts could
talk about. Sportswriter after sportswriter would pen
pieces lamenting the downfall of America's pastime.
Congress would put bailout legislation on hold and start
immediate investigations. Fans nationwide would feel
betrayed, and the pundits would compare the steroids
usage of Ortiz. Rollins and co. to everything from the
Black Sox to the Vietnam War. And 50 vears down the

road, I'd be telling my grandkids about the day I heard
that baseball's best had been cheating all along.
But it didn't happen in MLB. It happened in the NFL,
and few cared enough to comment.
Steroid use in the NFL isn't anything new — football
players have been testing positive for steroids as long as
their bat-wielding counterparts have. And yet, this dou
ble standard persists. We will never think of Mark McG
wire, Sammy Sosa or even the yet-to-be-convicted-of
anything Barry Bonds in the same way again, but when
we reflect on the run-stuffing prowess of the Williams
Wall, will anyone remember that they were juicing?
Probably not, because no one seems to care.
Perhaps, in our subconscious, we expect it. When 6-
foot-6, 350-pound offensive linemen routinely run sub
-5.0 40-yard dashes, the idea that they may be on some
type of drug doesn't seem too far fetched. When they're
clean, we laud them as freakishly athletic, which the vast
majority of them are. Few sports require the blend of
speed, size and agility that football does. But when it
turns out that they've been juicing, no one is shocked.
In contrast, the traditional baseball player is supposed
to be lean, not necessarily physically imposing and, for
the most part, looks like your average Joe. Sure, it's a
stereotype — one that McGwire, Sosa and an older
Barry Bonds certainly bucked — yet, it resonates. When
Brian Roberts was named in the Mitchell Report, people
were surprised because he doesn't look like a juicer.
Maybe the storyline isn't as intriguing. McGwire, Sosa
and Bonds were all part of homerun chases that captured
the interest of the nation and helped win back baseball
fans after the 1994 players strike. While McAllister,
Smith and the Williamses are all top players, none of
them are chasing Michael Strahan's sack record, or Eric
Dickerson's rushing yards mark — even if they were, nei
ther of those two totals gets anything close to the rever
ence for the single-season homerun record.
Maybe baseball, not football, truly is the definitive
American pastime — and maybe that's why we care
more. Or, perhaps because their faces aren't hidden by a
helmet and facemask, there is a more personal element
to baseball that allows fans to connect more with players.
Whatever the reason, the double standard persists.
The NFL will hand out its punishment, just as the MLB
does when faced with a similar situation. But the most im
portant battle is the one for public opinion, which will
persist long after the suspensions are over.
I'm not a fan of throwing steroid users to the wolves,
or of hypocritical sportswriters (and commissioners)
turning a blind eye to juicing one day and acting holier
than-thou the next. But if we as a society are going to se
riously clamp down on the problem that is supposedly ru
ining our games, then we must hold athletes of all sports
to the same standards.

Wyndatn Makowsky is the kind of sportswriter who be
lieves in holding baseball and football players to the same
standard... even if the latter are much scarier than the for
mer. Email him at makowsky@stanford.edu if you've also
got the courage.
