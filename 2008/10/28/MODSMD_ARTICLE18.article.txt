# Field hockey victorious in stroke-off
## 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA STAFF WRITER 
Redshirt freshman Alessandra Moss was de
termined to lead her team to a victory against the
Pacific Tigers on Sunday afternoon in Stockton,
Calif. In a season filled with close matches and
one-goal defeats, the Cardinal needed a win to
build momentum going into the NorPacTourna
ment — and that's exactly what it got.
"The win over University of Pacific was real
ly crucial for us," said Junior Rachel Bush.adding
that the team needed to establish "a good posi
tion for [itself in the] NorPac Tournament com
ing up in a couple weeks."
The women began the weekend with a 2-1
loss against Cal. Fortunately for the Cardinal, it
did not count towards the team's conference
record: however, next week's rematch against
the Bears will affect the NorPac standings.
The Cardinal lost Sunday in a close decision,
allowing the winning goal late in the second half
off a penalty corner. It was Stanford's eighth one
goal defeat of the year.Though disappointing for
the Stanford women, the loss should help moti
vate the team when it faces Berkeley again on
Nov. l.The match served as an exhibition round
and allowed the Cardinal to get a good feel for
Cal's style of play and to assess the Bears'
strengths and weaknesses. The Cal women have
already secured the No. 1 seed in the NorPac
Tournament.
"Even though we started out the season a lit
tle rocky, everyone has been working hard non
stop," Bush said."[ W]e're starting to peak at just
the right time for conference tournament and
NCAAs. It's really exciting to see everything
start to come together for us and it's going to be
a great game next weekend against Cal.especial
ly since it will be our last home game."
On Friday, the Cardinal was led by junior Mi
dori Uehara. The midfielder continued her
amazing season, scoring her eighth goal of the
year to tie the match at 1-1. Moss also had a
strong game, making five of her six saves in the
first half.
The match on Friday was followed by the
much-needed victory against Pacific. The win
pushed the Cardinal's record to 5-10 on the sea
son. and more importantly to a 3-2 record in the
NorPac conference. The victory also gave Stan
ford a season sweep of Pacific, as the Cardinal
beat the Tigers 7-0 in September.
The win is a timely one as Stanford prepares

for a late-season surge. The team held an advan
tage in shots with a 15-12 lead and penalty cor
ners, 14-10. Freshman Stephanie Byrne scored
her sixth goal of the year to give the Cardinal a 1 -
0 lead in the 14th minute. But Pacific scored with
two minutes left, and the game went to overtime.
While Stanford maintained control in the first
overtime — leading the Tigers in shots (5-1) and
penalty corners (6-0) — there was no scoring as
Pacific goalie Kelly Miller came up with a num
ber of fantastic saves. The game moved into the
second overtime and the Tigers reversed the mo
mentum, out-shooting the Cardinal 5-3. But de
fense prevailed and the second bonus period was
scoreless.

Going into the stroke-off, senior Baiiy
Richardson led the Cardinal with four shots,
while sophomores Camille Gandhi and Xanthe
Travlos contributed three each. Moss had an im
pressive match with five saves.
The Stanford women came together to rally
their teammates on as the stroke-off began.
Moss made a number of spectacular saves, and
Travlos converted on Stanford's first attempt to
take a 1-0 lead.Travlos' goal was followed by six
consecutive scores from Gandhi, senior Hillary
Braun and sophomore Katherine Donner. The
result: a close and stressful 2-1 victory.
Uehara was excited for the upcoming confer
ence tournament and considered the Cardinal's

two recent wins as a big morale boost.
"The team is definitely moving forward going
into the conference tournament." she said.
"We've been playing well as a unit, and il has felt
good to get two wins out of our past three games.
We're really excited to honor our seniors at our
game against Cal this Saturday, and to continue
the momentum we've been building to go into
NorPacs."
Stanford will host this Saturday's contest
against Cal, which will also be Senior Day. Game
lime is set for 1 p.m.
