## Redefining political apathy at Stanford 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS 
With a spike of vote-or-die mes
sages and celebrity-studded
You Tube videos targeted at the
disaffected segment of the popu
lation, apathetic voters have
been in the limelight lately.
But do the couch-sitting, politically uninformed,
disinterested voters really exist at Stanford?
It doesn't seem like it.
Rather, a new trend is emerging â€” one where
students mistakenly placed under the umbrella
term "apathetic" actually do have strong, albeit not
mainstream, voting philosophies.
A feeling of un-empowerment and ignorance
David Brody Ml, who hails from a heavily
Democratic area of California, considers himself
marginally politically aware, but said he feels a cer
tain level of distance from the electoral process
because he questions the power of his individual
vote.
"My vote will have no significant impact since
my area always tends to vote one way." he said.
Nevertheless, he still plans on casting a ballot on
Nov. 4 because he feels a social responsibility to par
ticipate in the democratic process.
"I feel an obligation to vote, so 1 do," Brody said,
"but I feel bad for being an uninformed voter."
Anastasia Yee Ml shares Brody's sentiments
about casting a vote that doesn't seem fully
informed.
"Relative to other students here who are really
gung-ho about politics, I care less about the issues,"
she confessed. "1 do have opinions on platforms, but
politics aren't on the top of my priority list, so I
don't care enough to actually get involved because
I have other things to do."
The political atheist
Coterminal student Osprey Brown '09 identifies
himself as politically apathetic, but is probably
something closer to politically atheistic.
Having lost faith that voting in a presidential
election will directly affect issues important to him,
he said he doesn't "feel that either political party is
out to protect my needs."
