## Redefining political apathy at Stanford 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS 
With a spike of vote-or-die mes
sages and celebrity-studded
You Tube videos targeted at the
disaffected segment of the popu
lation, apathetic voters have
been in the limelight lately.
But do the couch-sitting, politically uninformed,
disinterested voters really exist at Stanford?
It doesn't seem like it.
Rather, a new trend is emerging — one where
students mistakenly placed under the umbrella
term "apathetic" actually do have strong, albeit not
mainstream, voting philosophies.
A feeling of un-empowerment and ignorance
David Brody Ml, who hails from a heavily
Democratic area of California, considers himself
marginally politically aware, but said he feels a cer
tain level of distance from the electoral process
because he questions the power of his individual
vote.
"My vote will have no significant impact since
my area always tends to vote one way." he said.
Nevertheless, he still plans on casting a ballot on
Nov. 4 because he feels a social responsibility to par
ticipate in the democratic process.
"I feel an obligation to vote, so 1 do," Brody said,
"but I feel bad for being an uninformed voter."
Anastasia Yee Ml shares Brody's sentiments
about casting a vote that doesn't seem fully
informed.
"Relative to other students here who are really
gung-ho about politics, I care less about the issues,"
she confessed. "1 do have opinions on platforms, but
politics aren't on the top of my priority list, so I
don't care enough to actually get involved because
I have other things to do."
The political atheist
Coterminal student Osprey Brown '09 identifies
himself as politically apathetic, but is probably
something closer to politically atheistic.
Having lost faith that voting in a presidential
election will directly affect issues important to him,
he said he doesn't "feel that either political party is
out to protect my needs."
Brown does acknowledge that he
is happier with this election's choice
of candidates compared to those
from past years, but bureaucratic
governmental structures still bar
both from delivering the change that
they each promise.
"Neither candidate can fully cir
cumvent the bureaucracy," Brown
said."There's only so much that an in
dividual can do."
Brown's political cynicism stems
mainly from failures he observes in
the judiciary. 1 le feels that corruption
in the courts has caused widespread
problems that the executive branch is
ill-equipped to remedy, and accord
ing to Brown, electing one individual
to the presidency won't change the
status quo.
"Most people at Stanford are very
politically active and think that things
can be changed, but I don't know
why." he said. "I don't see any plausi
ble end to the injustices that exist in

the government. I don't see much
that any one person can do to under
mine 200 years' worth of problems."
Despite his skepticism regarding
the amount of change that one indi
vidual can make in Washington,
Brown is still voting.
He doubted, however, that he will
ever be enthusiastic about the system.
"I don't see any circumstance
where what I think is important is
ever going to be part of the political
agenda," he said. "I just don't."
The non-voter
Michael Gummelt'l 1 browses the
blogosphere, follows the issues and
navigates the ins and outs of the polit
ical arena. In fact, he might arguably
be one of the most politically aware
undergrads around, and he cares pas
sionately about what happens to the
country and the world.
And that's precisely why he's not
voting on Nov. 4.

"I'm not voting because I disagree
with both of the candidates on such a
fundamental level that I can't in good
conscience vote for either one of
them," Gummelt said. "If I don't
agree with enough points to endorse
a candidate, then I'm not going to
vote."
On top of his break with both can
didates. Ciummelt also has other rea
sons for refusing to vote: He feels that
the voting machine as a system is rife
with failure and internal corruption.
"I feel that there are so many
things wrong with the electoral sys
tem — that seeing all these things
and continuing to participate is par
ticipating in what I view as a corrupt

and broken system," he said.
Gummelt's disenchantment with
the electoral system was reinforced in
2004 when Clinton Curtis, a comput
er programmer, testified under oath
that Rep. Tom Feeney (R-Fla.) had
hired him to write untraceable vote
rigging software code to be used in
touch-screen voting machines. Cur
tis' testimony killed what little faith
Gummelt had in the voting system.
"People say that in order to fix a
system you have to vote to change it.
and I get that," Gummelt explained.
"But when there are so many things
integrally wrong with the system in
the first place, it's overwhelming."
"You have elections that could

very well be bought and
you have electoral systems
that make most votes obso
lete," he continued. "Part o
my vote is a protest against
the Electoral College,
which is outdated. Local
voting doesn't gel anyth

done because all the districts are ger
rymandered. Hie political machine is
too broken right now to be a part of."
Nonetheless, Gummelt hopes for
the day when his faith in the system is
restored.
"1 don't know how to fix the sys
tem, but I don't think that voting is
the way to do it,"he said. "If it gets
fixed. I'll vote. And if there's a candi-

"Neither candidate can fully cir
cumvent the bureaucracy," Brown
said."There's only so much that an in
dividual can do."
Brown's political cynicism stems
mainly from failures he observes in
the judiciary. 1 le feels that corruption
in the courts has caused widespread
problems that the executive branch is
ill-equipped to remedy, and accord
ing to Brown, electing one individual
to the presidency won't change the
status quo.
"Most people at Stanford are very
politically active and think that things
can be changed, but I don't know
why." he said. "I don't see any plausi
ble end to the injustices that exist in

the government. I don't see much
that any one person can do to under
mine 200 years' worth of problems."
Despite his skepticism regarding
the amount of change that one indi
vidual can make in Washington,
Brown is still voting.
He doubted, however, that he will
ever be enthusiastic about the system.
"I don't see any circumstance
where what I think is important is
ever going to be part of the political
agenda," he said. "I just don't."
The non-voter
Michael Gummelt'l 1 browses the
blogosphere, follows the issues and
navigates the ins and outs of the polit
ical arena. In fact, he might arguably
be one of the most politically aware
undergrads around, and he cares pas
sionately about what happens to the
country and the world.
And that's precisely why he's not
voting on Nov. 4.

"I'm not voting because I disagree
with both of the candidates on such a
fundamental level that I can't in good
conscience vote for either one of
them," Gummelt said. "If I don't
agree with enough points to endorse
a candidate, then I'm not going to
vote."
On top of his break with both can
didates. Ciummelt also has other rea
sons for refusing to vote: He feels that
the voting machine as a system is rife
with failure and internal corruption.
"I feel that there are so many
things wrong with the electoral sys
tem — that seeing all these things
and continuing to participate is par
ticipating in what I view as a corrupt

and broken system," he said.
Gummelt's disenchantment with
the electoral system was reinforced in
2004 when Clinton Curtis, a comput
er programmer, testified under oath
that Rep. Tom Feeney (R-Fla.) had
hired him to write untraceable vote
rigging software code to be used in
touch-screen voting machines. Cur
tis' testimony killed what little faith
Gummelt had in the voting system.
"People say that in order to fix a
system you have to vote to change it.
and I get that," Gummelt explained.
"But when there are so many things
integrally wrong with the system in
the first place, it's overwhelming."
"You have elections that could

very well be bought and
you have electoral systems
that make most votes obso
lete," he continued. "Part o
my vote is a protest against
the Electoral College,
which is outdated. Local
voting doesn't gel anyth

done because all the districts are ger
rymandered. Hie political machine is
too broken right now to be a part of."
Nonetheless, Gummelt hopes for
the day when his faith in the system is
restored.
"1 don't know how to fix the sys
tem, but I don't think that voting is
the way to do it,"he said. "If it gets
fixed. I'll vote. And if there's a candi-

date whom I agree with on enough of
the points, then I'll vote. But now.nei
ther one of those things is true."
