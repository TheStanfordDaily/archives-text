# Stem cell facility breaks ground
## Lorry I. Lokey Stem Cell Research Building will be largest of its kind 
### ALEX HOLTZMAN 
'ITie University broke ground yesterday
on what will be the nation's largest stem
cell research facility when it is completed
in the fall of 2010. Over 200 attendees wit
nessed the ceremony inaugurating the
Lorry I. Lokey Stem Cell Research
Building.
The 200,000-square-foot facility will

bring together roughly 600 scientists in one
central location at the Stanford School of
Medicine. The school expects that the new
space for unified research will attract tal
ented stem cell researchers to Stanford.
"A significant number of spots are
being reserved for new faculty recruits."
said Chris Shay, project manager for the
new building, in a press release. "The build
ing will be attractive to scientists because it

will be a hub of our research enterprise."
Hopes are high for the new building.
"The Lokey Building will have a trans
forming impact on stem cell biology and
regenerative medicine," said Philip Pizzo,
dean of the School of Medicine, in a state
ment. "Decades from now, we will view
the Lokey Research Building as one of
the catalysts for moving the field of stem
cell biology to a new level of excellence

and success."
Pizzo opened the groundbreaking cere
mony by talking about the effort involved
in making the Lokey Building a reality.The
$200 million building will be financed
through a mix of public and private funds.
Public funds come from the California
Institute for Regenerative Medicine
