# Stem cell facility breaks ground
## Lorry I. Lokey Stem Cell Research Building will be largest of its kind 
### ALEX HOLTZMAN 
'ITie University broke ground yesterday
on what will be the nation's largest stem
cell research facility when it is completed
in the fall of 2010. Over 200 attendees wit
nessed the ceremony inaugurating the
Lorry I. Lokey Stem Cell Research
Building.
The 200,000-square-foot facility will

bring together roughly 600 scientists in one
central location at the Stanford School of
Medicine. The school expects that the new
space for unified research will attract tal
ented stem cell researchers to Stanford.
"A significant number of spots are
being reserved for new faculty recruits."
said Chris Shay, project manager for the
new building, in a press release. "The build
ing will be attractive to scientists because it

will be a hub of our research enterprise."
Hopes are high for the new building.
"The Lokey Building will have a trans
forming impact on stem cell biology and
regenerative medicine," said Philip Pizzo,
dean of the School of Medicine, in a state
ment. "Decades from now, we will view
the Lokey Research Building as one of
the catalysts for moving the field of stem
cell biology to a new level of excellence

and success."
Pizzo opened the groundbreaking cere
mony by talking about the effort involved
in making the Lokey Building a reality.The
$200 million building will be financed
through a mix of public and private funds.
Public funds come from the California
Institute for Regenerative Medicine

Included in yesterday's groundbreaking ceremony were (left to right) Robert Klein, chairman of CIRM; Philip Pizzo, dean of the School of Medicine; Lorry Lokey, Business
Wire founder and donor; John Hennessy, University President; and Irving Weissman, director of the Stanford Institute of Stem Cell Biology and Regenerative Medicine.
(CI RM) — the state stem cell agency
created by 2(XJ4's Proposition 71 —
which provides grants and loans for
stem cell research. CIRM provided a

grant of $43.6 million to help pay for
construction.
The majority of the funding,
though, comes from philanthropic
contributions, including a historic $75
million gift from Lorry I. Lokey.
Lokey, the founder of Business
Wire and a former editor of The
Daily, also contributed to the under
construetion Lorry I. Lokey Stanford

Daily Building. His gift is the largest
to the medical school from a private
individual and one of the largest cap
ital gifts to Stanford University. The
remaining funding will come from the
University.
"This building shows that the sci
ences are cooperating amongst them
selves to reach a goal," Lokey said.
Deflecting praise for his own phi

lanthropy, he claimed that the pas
sage of Proposition 71 showed that
"voters are smarter than you think."
Dr. Irvine Weissman, director of
the Stanford Institute of Stem Cell
Biology and Regenerative Medicine
— and one of the first faculty mem
bers to call for a new building —
echoed Pizzo's comments about the
potential of the building to bring
researchers together in an interdisci
plinary environment.
Weissman introduced Bob Klein,
director of CIRM. who led the cam
paign for the passage of Prop. 71. For
Klein, stem cell research is a personal

issue. His son has juvenile diabetes
and his mother suffers from
Alzheimer's disease, two diseases
which are under the scope of stem
cell research.
"I am personally deeply apprecia
tive," Klein said, adding that stem cell
research offers great promise for
future generations.
University President John
Hennessy also spoke at the event,
commenting that the new building
will make Stanford a leader in the
field of stem cell research.
Nevertheless, Hennessy explained
that the building itself was not
enough.
"What matters in a university is
the quality of the people," Hennessy
said.
Following the groundbreaking,
there was a symposium featuring
talks from Stanford researchers,
including Dr. Rennee Reijo Pera,
director of the Center for Human
Embryonic Stem Cell Research and
Education.
Reijo Pera called stem cells the
tools to unwrap the lineage of human
development.
"Human embryology matters,"

she said. "If it didn't, we wouldn't be
here."
Event attendees universally laud
ed the achievement involved in mak
ing the stem cell research facility a
reality and spoke of the promise for
the future.
Dr. Margaret Billingham, a
Stanford professor emeritus of
pathology, lauded the new building as
"absolutely amazing."
"I'm very proud and really hon
ored to be here," she added.
Gordon Newlin said he had been
interested for years in stem cell
research when he got involved in the
2(X)4 campaign for Prop. 71.
"The building allows the outstand
ing faculty and staff to make real con
tributions," Newlin said.
The design of the four-story facili
ty along Campus Drive mirrors the
Quad's limestone exterior and red
roof elements. The building's open
design encourages collaboration,
with a large atrium lobby to serve as
a pedestrian thoroughfare to other
parts of the medical school campus.
