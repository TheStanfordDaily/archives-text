## Students lament limited Stern Late Nite 
### E. BLAIR LAING CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stern's Cyber Cafe offers a range of
comfort foods, from smoothies to hamburg
ers to chicken strips. But since the begin
ning of fall quarter, none of these late-night
offerings have been available on weekends,
a change that has led to dissent among
some students.
'ITie Cyber Cafe, known to most students
as Stern Late Nite. originally started serv
ing pizza after hours in 1992. Eventually, it
expanded its variety of foods and opened
for service every night of the week. For the
past three years, the Cyber Cafe has been
open from 8 p.m. until 2 a.m., every day of
the week.
But this year the Cyber Cafe is only
open on weekdays. With the success of the
Axe & Palm, among the other late-night
dining options such as the CoHo, Lag Late
Nite and the 750 Pub, the Cyber Cafe has
decided to bow out.
"During the last year. . . students
migrated from other late-night venues to
the center of campus," said Eric Montell,
executive director of Stanford Dining in an
email to The Daily. "Stern has steadily seen
its late-night participation drop during the
last year. Students are (overwhelmingly]
choosing to support the Axe & Palm
through the use of the meal plan and
Cardinal Dollars."
In response, the Cyber Cafe has closed
its weekend operations, and is planning ren
ovations during winter quarter to help draw

students to Stern Late Nile.
"The plan is to make the space feel more
like a late-night lounge where students
would want to mingle and spend time with
their friends," Montell said. "We are active
ly working with students and our team to
[increase] attendance in Cyber Cafe and
Late Nite at Lakeside."
Montell said that there have been few
requests from students to reopen on week

ends. but that student input is highly val
ued, especially in terms of the renovations.
"We would like to hear additionally
from students if there are other ideas we
should consider," Montell said.
Michael Wilkerson '09, Daily columnist
and freshman RA in Burbank, has been
talking to Stanford Dining about the possi
bility of reopening the Cyber Cafe on
weekends.

"There isn't really a concerted effort, but
1 personally want to get it reopened,"
Wilkerson said. "I have been speaking with
a lot of people ... and there is a lot of inter
est."
Wilkerson himself frequented Stern
Late Nite his freshman year and recollects
his weekends spent there with his friends

with a hint of nostalgia. Wilkerson
said that Dining, however, has been
very helpful in working with him to
open a discussion on the subject.
"There is a strong argument to
be made about Late Nite being part
of the residential experience, like
being at home," Wilkerson said. "1
think a lot of people want some
thing more relaxed, easier and clos
er to home. I know my freshmen
have asked me why it isn't open on

weekends."
Emily Deffner "11 lived in Stern
last year and often frequented the
Cyber Cafe late on weekend nights.
"[The weekend] is when they
make the most money, because peo
ple like me come in and order one
of everything." Deffner said. "I still
think it should be open on week
ends."
Now. with Stern Late Nite closed
on Friday and Saturday nights, stu
dents are forced to walk to central
campus for food. However, Dining
is willing to work with students.
"There have been a very limited
number of requests to expand the
hours of Stern Cvber Cafe from stu

dents," Montell said. "We respond to
what the majority of students are
requesting. Student voices are heard
through the use of their dining dol
lars."
Students can also go online to
the Stanford Dining Web site at din
ing.stanford.edu and let Dining
know their opinions in the "Let Us
Know" section.
"Ultimately, students are decid
ing where Stanford Dining should
focus its attention by their participa
tion in certain dining venues,"
Montell said.
