## WTO Director speaks on financial crisis Lamy visits campus, discusses Doha, protectionist policies 
### ALAN GUO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Pascal Lamy. the director general of the
World Trade Organization (WTO), spoke yes
terday to an audience of mostly faculty and doc
toral candidates about the international trade
system within the context of the current global
financial crisis.
Lamv's talk, entitled "Is Multilateralism
Dead?" explored the merits and (laws of bilater
alism and multilateralism, with Lamy arguing
for the latter.
Hie veteran diplomat briefly spoke of the
difficulties confronting the WTO in the Doha
round of trade negotiation, a series of talks with
the goal of further reducing trade barriers to
foster development and integrate global eco
nomic systems. The Doha round began in 2001.
but the latest negotiations stalled over agricul
tural import rules this summer.
"WTO is a member-driven organization,
not a member-driving organization (like the
International Mutual Fund]," Lamy
said. "Right now, the members just
lack the incentives to reach a consen
sus."
Lamy went on to state that the
risk of protectionism certainly exists
given the current situation of the
global economy. He stressed, howev
er, that current regulations exist in
the WTO to prevent a reversion to
protectionist ideology.
The WTO director continued on
to emphasize that closing off trade
carries a great risk for the world
economy.
"The lesson of history is that there
is one thing one should not do in
these circumstances," Lamy said,
"which is, make things worse."
Lamy's discussion of protectionist
policies struck a chord with those at
the talk.
"As of now. the country sees a
short-term benefit, and we see a clos
ing market and protectionism," said
Stuart Baimel '09, who is a columnist
for The Daily. "In a time of global
slowdown, at least in my mind, peo
ple should work extra hard to open
the export market."
Frequently referencing the Great
Depression of the 19305. Lamy
explained that the current crisis is
not unexpected given the capitalistic
boom and bust cycles of the market.
He pointed out that the lack of regu
lation is one of the major sources of
the current crisis, among other
things.
"Our financial system is [mini

mally] regulated, as compared to the
forces which we have inserted in the
system." Lamy said. "The reason we
do not have a system in place is
because people decided not to have
it."
Lamy noted that in the interna
tional system, the process of estab
lishing a standard is much more diffi
cult, often requiring unanimous
agreement instead of a majority vote,
as in domestic democracy. Lamy said
such a system is a possibility.
"[What we learned in trade in the

19305] led to a system which is...
incredibly imperfect, but in many
ways is the only serious regulation
system," Lamy said. "[I hope that]
something of this kind will apply to
finance."
Lamy also argued that the eco
nomic benefits of free trade far out
weigh national political interests and
have enduring impacts on develop
ing and developed countries alike.
