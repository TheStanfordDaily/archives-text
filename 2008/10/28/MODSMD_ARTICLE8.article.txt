## QA with Republican Congressional candidate BLAIR NATHAN '10 
### JONATHAN ANDERSON 
Blair Nathan '10 is doing something
most undergraduates would never
have thought possible: He's run
ning as the Republican candidate
for California's State Senate in the
11th District.
While it may surprise people, Nathan —
a staff writer for "The Stanford Review"
who is studying economics —is 21 years old
and thus eligible to run for the office.
The 1 Ith District, redistricted in 2(X)l,en
compasses the Pacific coastline from south
of Half Moon Bay to Santa Cruz, including
Stanford. It has nearly 850,000 constituents.
Nathan is taking on the district's current
Democratic incumbent. State Senator Joe
Simitian, who handily won out the open seat
over the Republican challenger Jon Zell
hoefer in 2004. While Simitian is best known
for his work on the Hands-Free Cell Phone
Bill (1613), which requires California mo
torists to use hands-free devices when using
cell phones while driving, he has also sup
ported legislation extending environmental
codes and increasing transparency and ac
countability in education.
For his own part. Nathan has listed his top
priorities as limiting government and being
fiscally disciplined, instituting education re
forms by adjusting local control over fund
ing and curriculum, while fashioning a busi
ness environment "conducive to employ
ment and enterprise."
Nathan corresponded with The Daily
over email to answer questions on how and
why he became involved in the campaign.
More information on Nathan's biogra
phy.priorities and stance on the issues can be
found at http://smartvoter.org/2008/
1 l/04/ca/state/vote/nathan_b/.
The Stanford Daily: Who can vote for you
and when can they do so?
Blair Nathan: Voters registered in the 11th
district can vote in this election. If voters
have signed up for vote-by-mail, they can
vote well in advance of the election. Other
wise they can go to their polling place on
Nov. 4.

SD: On what issues do you and Rep. Joe
Simitian share similar ideas and where do
you differ?
BN: I'll give credit where it's due. Simitian is
an experienced legislator, and some of his
legislation is respectable, even if I don't
agree with it. For example, you can certainly
make a case for the hands-free hill. (My own
view is that it kind of misses the point. There
should be appropriate civil and criminal
penalties for negligent driving in general. It's
not so clear-cut what constitutes negligence,
though. Under the hands-free law, you can
have a highly distracting phone conversa
tion as long as it's hands-free. However, if
you want to make a routine, quick call on
your handset, it's illegal.)
More broadly, Simitian is a pretty much
down-the-line Democrat in Sacramento. My
concern is that those policies — on taxes,
health, education, the environment and so
on — are not taking California in the right
direction. Sacramento is a few legislative
seats away from being a liberal monopoly. I
don't think that one-sided situation is in the
state's interests.
SD: What experiences do you have working
either for or with the legislators?
BN: I haven't worked in a legislative office
before, but then again, look at where the cur
rent legislature is in spite of all its collective
experience.lt has something like a 15 percent
approval rating, and with good reason.
The state has one of the highest tax bur
dens in the country and yet can't get its
money's worth in education, prisons and
roads. Meanwhile, the budgets that allocate
this spending are increasingly gimmicky and
unsustainable, this fiscal year's budget being
the best example. Experience in finance (of
which I have some) might be more to the
point.
SD: Why did you decide to get involved with
this senatorial race? What were the reasons
and how did this realization come to you?
BN: I was at a talk on healthcare here on
campus lasHFebruarv or March. It so hap
pened that' there were a couple regional
GOP officials there. They mentioned after
the event that there was no Republican can
didate in the race, and that they would like to
have one. I thought about it and figured.

"Why not?" Like I said before, it's about
choice. Democracy functions better when
there are multiple candidates! I know the
Bay Area is more or less liberal, but there
should still be a public discourse in which
different points of view are out there.
Look at Washington. For six years, the
Republican Party dominated both elective
branches.The result is that it got complacent
and sloppy — and I say that as a Republi
can. A monolithic establishment is not
healthy.
SD: After deciding to run, what were the
steps to becoming the Republican represen
tative on the ballot?
BN: It was actually quite complicated. First I
needed to get 40 signatures of registered
District 11 Republicans. In practice, this
meant getting a lot more signatures, since
some of them are inevitably rejected for var
ious reasons by the county registrars.
Once that was completed. I had to file a
number of forms with the Santa Clara Coun
ty registrar. That would have been the end of
it. but unfortunately there was a misunder
standing when I went to file. The registrar's
and Secretary of State's offices insisted (er
roneously) that I was not eligible.
The result was several weeks of uncer
tainty. but finally the situation was cleared
up favorably bv Charles Bell, the OOP's
counsel in Sacramento. A writ of mandate
was issued to the registrar, and my papers
were accepted.
SD: What's happened since then?
BN: On the formal side of things, disclosure
of contributions and expenses is required at
regular intervals. (In my case, there's not a
whole lot to disclose, which is, I suppose, a
mixed blessing.)
I was on the ballot in the June primary
election. Since I was already the nominees
this was a pro forma exercise. I did, however,
field some inquiries from particularly dili
gent voters.
For the general election, I've prepared
the [Smart Voter] Web page, which commu
nicates my positions to the electorate and
gives the appropriate contact information.

JEFF KEACHER/The Stanford Do

Blair Nathan '10 is doing something
most undergraduates would never
have thought possible: He's run
ning as the Republican candidate
for California's State Senate in the
11th District.
While it may surprise people, Nathan —
a staff writer for "The Stanford Review"
who is studying economics —is 21 years old
and thus eligible to run for the office.
The 1 Ith District, redistricted in 2(X)l,en
compasses the Pacific coastline from south
of Half Moon Bay to Santa Cruz, including
Stanford. It has nearly 850,000 constituents.
Nathan is taking on the district's current
Democratic incumbent. State Senator Joe
Simitian, who handily won out the open seat
over the Republican challenger Jon Zell
hoefer in 2004. While Simitian is best known
for his work on the Hands-Free Cell Phone
Bill (1613), which requires California mo
torists to use hands-free devices when using
cell phones while driving, he has also sup
ported legislation extending environmental
codes and increasing transparency and ac
countability in education.
For his own part. Nathan has listed his top
priorities as limiting government and being
fiscally disciplined, instituting education re
forms by adjusting local control over fund
ing and curriculum, while fashioning a busi
ness environment "conducive to employ
ment and enterprise."
Nathan corresponded with The Daily
over email to answer questions on how and
why he became involved in the campaign.
More information on Nathan's biogra
phy.priorities and stance on the issues can be
found at http://smartvoter.org/2008/

The Stanford Daily: Who can vote for you
and when can they do so?
Blair Nathan: Voters registered in the 11th
district can vote in this election. If voters
have signed up for vote-by-mail, they can
vote well in advance of the election. Other
wise they can go to their polling place on
Nov. 4.

SD: On what issues do you and Rep. Joe
Simitian share similar ideas and where do
you differ?
BN: I'll give credit where it's due. Simitian is
an experienced legislator, and some of his
legislation is respectable, even if I don't
agree with it. For example, you can certainly
make a case for the hands-free hill. (My own
view is that it kind of misses the point. There
should be appropriate civil and criminal
penalties for negligent driving in general. It's
not so clear-cut what constitutes negligence,
though. Under the hands-free law, you can
have a highly distracting phone conversa
tion as long as it's hands-free. However, if
you want to make a routine, quick call on
your handset, it's illegal.)
More broadly, Simitian is a pretty much
down-the-line Democrat in Sacramento. My
concern is that those policies — on taxes,
health, education, the environment and so
on — are not taking California in the right
direction. Sacramento is a few legislative
seats away from being a liberal monopoly. I
don't think that one-sided situation is in the
state's interests.
SD: What experiences do you have working
either for or with the legislators?
BN: I haven't worked in a legislative office
before, but then again, look at where the cur
rent legislature is in spite of all its collective
experience.lt has something like a 15 percent
approval rating, and with good reason.
The state has one of the highest tax bur
dens in the country and yet can't get its
money's worth in education, prisons and
roads. Meanwhile, the budgets that allocate
this spending are increasingly gimmicky and
unsustainable, this fiscal year's budget being
the best example. Experience in finance (of
which I have some) might be more to the
point.
SD: Why did you decide to get involved with
this senatorial race? What were the reasons
and how did this realization come to you?
BN: I was at a talk on healthcare here on
campus lasHFebruarv or March. It so hap
pened that' there were a couple regional
GOP officials there. They mentioned after
the event that there was no Republican can
didate in the race, and that they would like to
have one. I thought about it and figured.

"Why not?" Like I said before, it's about
choice. Democracy functions better when
there are multiple candidates! I know the
Bay Area is more or less liberal, but there
should still be a public discourse in which
different points of view are out there.
Look at Washington. For six years, the
Republican Party dominated both elective
branches.The result is that it got complacent
and sloppy — and I say that as a Republi
can. A monolithic establishment is not
healthy.
SD: After deciding to run, what were the
steps to becoming the Republican represen
tative on the ballot?
BN: It was actually quite complicated. First I
needed to get 40 signatures of registered
District 11 Republicans. In practice, this
meant getting a lot more signatures, since
some of them are inevitably rejected for var
ious reasons by the county registrars.
Once that was completed. I had to file a
number of forms with the Santa Clara Coun
ty registrar. That would have been the end of
it. but unfortunately there was a misunder
standing when I went to file. The registrar's
and Secretary of State's offices insisted (er
roneously) that I was not eligible.
The result was several weeks of uncer
tainty. but finally the situation was cleared
up favorably bv Charles Bell, the OOP's
counsel in Sacramento. A writ of mandate
was issued to the registrar, and my papers
were accepted.
SD: What's happened since then?
BN: On the formal side of things, disclosure
of contributions and expenses is required at
regular intervals. (In my case, there's not a
whole lot to disclose, which is, I suppose, a
mixed blessing.)
I was on the ballot in the June primary
election. Since I was already the nominees
this was a pro forma exercise. I did, however,
field some inquiries from particularly dili
gent voters.
For the general election, I've prepared
the [Smart Voter] Web page, which commu
nicates my positions to the electorate and
gives the appropriate contact information.
