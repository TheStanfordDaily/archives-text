## Zimbra email system well received Popular new interface still secondary to Gmail 
### LIZ STARK 
Zimbra, the new Webmail client
introduced by the University at the
beginning of this academic year, is
being hailed by students and admin
istrators alike as a significant
improvement over the previous
Webmail interface.
"It's going really well," said
Ammy Hill, Information
Technology Services' (ITS) campus
readiness specialist, of the transition
to Zimbra. "We finished the student
migration two weeks ahead of
schedule, and we're starting the final
phase of moving faculty and staff
emails."
All undergraduate, graduate and
post-doctoral student emails migrat
ed from the previous client, Cyrus
lniap Server, prior to the beginning
of the new school year.
Currently, 19,875 users have
switched to Zimbra since the migra
tion began this June with ITS users.
ITS' goal is to reach 38,000 by the
end of fall quarter by including fac
ulty and staff in the transition.
ITS also plans to convert stu
dents from Sundial, the previous
online calendar, to Zimbra's inte
grated email and calendar service in
February or March of 2009, though
Hill estimates that this conversion
will apply to only 600 students.
ITS began its search for a new
email client in 2007. After meeting
with students, faculty and staff about
their needs, ITS narrowed the initial
field of nine down to proposals from
Zimbra, Google and Microsoft
Exchange 2007.
Following student and staff test
ing of the three clients, ITS recom
mended Zimbra to University
President John Hennessy in June
2007.
Zimbra is also used at Georgia
Tech. Texas A&M and Ohio State
University.
Based in Sunnyvale, Zimbra —
which was purchased by Yahoo! in
September 2007 — has been "really

responsive" in meeting Stanford's
needs, according to Hill.
Zimbra has been upgraded once
already this year, and Hill reported
that another upgrade is planned for
Jan. 1,2009.
"It's a really positive relation
ship," Hill said. "Typically, the
Stanford setup is what it is, but
we've said to them, 'This is what we
need,' and they have said, 'OK. we
can do that.' It's been a very refresh
ing change."
Student response to Zimbra has
been generally positive, particularly
when compared to the earlier
Webmail setup.
"It's so much more useful now,"
said Kelly Bonney-Ache '11.
"Before it took longer to send some
thing, and it wouldn't even tell you
when something was sent."
"Now it saves drafts automatical
ly," Bonney-Ache continued. "I
actually lost a lot of important
emails last year because my Internet
would crash and I hadn't saved any
drafts."
Zimbra's stylish new look has
also impressed users.
"The new Webmail interface ...
is very sleek," said James Xie '10 in
an email to The Daily. "Compared to
the old version, there really is no
comparison."
Many returning students, howev
er, do not use the new Zimbra
because they have already switched
over to Google's Gmail.
"Halfway through my sopho
more year I switched to Gmail." said
Eva Jellison '09. "The old Webmail
used to be pretty bad. You couldn't
include images or color, and it was
easier to attach stuff in Gmail."
"Most people I know have a
Gmail account," added Ariel James
'11, who also uses the mail client.
"Even if Zimbra's better, I'm not
going to switch back."
Some students were so frustrated
with the previous email client that
they are not even considering a
move to Zimbra.
"I absolutely hated what they
had before," said Marty Hu '11,
another Gmail user. "You could
only store 500 MB ... If you didn't
actually go back and delete your

emails, you could have a full inbox
by winter quarter."
"When the new Zimbra came
out, I didn't even pay attention to
it," Hu added.
The new Zimbra has approxi
mately 955 MB of storage, while
Gmail offers 7256 MB.
"Student use of Gmail was con
sidered," said Hill of the new client
selection process. Concerns about
data storage at Google, however,
ultimately ruled out Google's pro
posal for Stanford's email system.
"[With Gmail], data is saved in
Google storage, not Stanford stor
age, and the faculty were against
that," Hill said.
While Google uses targeted
advertising to afford additional stor
age space, Stanford does not.
According to Hill, additional
storage is available to "departmen
tal users" for a monthly cost.
The lack of storage space has also
driven many students to use POP
email clients, such as Microsoft
Outlook. Apple Mail and Firefox's
Thunderbird, to download their mail
to their computers.
"I like the format of [Apple Mail]
better," said Ali McKinney '12. "I
like that I can click an icon on my
desktop instead of logging in. and
that I can check my home and
school emails simultaneously."
New freshmen who already have
Gmail accounts have also indicated
they see no reason to switch to
Zimbra.
"I never considered using
[Zimbra] because I opened it up and
it was this really weird Java applet
thing that looked like it wouldn't
work very well," said Eric Conner
'12, who forwards his Stanford email
to his Gmail account. "I think
Stanford is kind of just screwed,
because they're not Google."
Despite the significant number of
students using Gmail and desktop
email clients. Hill said Stanford is
pleased with Zimbra.
"You don't have to use our web
mail," she said. "Everybody does
email their own wav"
