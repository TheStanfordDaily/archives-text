Nancy Etchemendy
Author of fantasy, horror and other fiction for children and adults
Nancy Etchemendy's novels, short fiction, and poetry have appeared
regularly for the past 25 years, both in the U.S. and abroad.Though she is
best known for her children's books, she has also published several dozen
stories for adults, mostly dark fantasy and horror. Her work has earned a
number of awards, including two Bram Stoker Awards for children's horror,
a Golden Duck Award for excellence in children's science fiction, and an
Anne Spencer Lindbergh Prize silver medal for excellence in children's
fantasy. Her books include the novel,The Power of Un, and Cat in Glass and
Other Tales of the Unnatural, a collection of short dark fantasy for young
adults. She leads a somewhat schizophrenic life, alternating between
unkempt, introverted writer of weird tales and requisite gracious wife of
Stanford University's Provost.
