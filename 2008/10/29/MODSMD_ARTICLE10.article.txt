Authorities say skinhead plot against Obama
wasn't fully formed
Two white supremacists charged with plotting to behead
blacks across the country and assassinate Barack Obama
while wearing white top hats and tuxes were likely too disor
ganized to carry out the plot, authorities said, and their plan
ning was riddled with blunders.
Paul Schlesselman. IX, of I lelena-West Helena, Ark., and
Daniel Cowart, 20, of Bells are accused of dreaming up the
plan. While authorities say they had guns capable of creating
carnage, documents show they never got close to getting off
the ground.
Among the blunders: They drew attention to themselves
by etching swastikas on a car with sidewalk chalk, only knew
each other for a month, couldn't even pull off a house rob
bery, and a friend ratted them out to authorities.
Calls mount for Stevens to resign
A growing chorus of Republicans on Tuesday called for
Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens to resign from a seat he's held for
four decades after his conviction on seven felony charges.
But with the party bracing for losses in the upcoming elec
tion. many hope Stevens will first win re-election next Tues
day. and then resign to give Republicans a chance to fill the
seat with a fresh GOP face.
Stevens, 84. was convicted Monday of lying about hun
dreds of thousands of dollars in home renovations and gifts he
received from a corrupt oil contractor. The verdict came
down just a week before Election Day. too late for Republi
cans to put someone new on the ballot against Democrat
Mark Begich.
Nevertheless. Republican presidential nominee John Mc-
Cain and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell urged
their Senate colleague to resign.
