## SSE unit funds student ventures 
### DAN HUANG 
Budding campus entrepreneurs can now look to
the ASSU for seed money to grow their business
ventures. SSE Ventures, a division of Stanford
Student Enterprises, is currently accepting business
plan applications from undergraduate and graduate
students at Stanford.
The funding group, which aims to become the
premier source of capital and advice for student
entrepreneurs, successfully funded diffbot.com last
year, and is looking for new ideas to invest in.
"Last year, we had a two- or three-month cycle
for people to apply," said Erin Dexter Ml, managing
director of SSE Ventures. "This year, we have rolling
applications until March 1."
According to Dexter, the application review
process has three tiers.
"Once people submit their applications, I will
review it and I will pass it off to a group of experts
to help me test how viable it is." she said. "If we
determine that it has a certain level of worth, we
have a board of members from the venture capital
community and a local angel investor who make the
final decision on whether to fund or not to fund."
SSE Ventures provides both seed funding and
consulting for teams that are ultimately selected
from the pool of applicants.
"It's more of an adviser relationship rather than
an investor relationship," Dexter said. "We really do
want to help the student entrepreneurs that we fund
be able to present their product to a real venture
capital firm once they have passed the first level of
funding we provide."
Diffbot.com, which was created on campus last
year, is cited bv SSE Ventures as an example of its
success. The prototype for diffbot came about when
co-founders Michael Tung M.S. '06 and Leith
Abdullah M.S.'O7 were still in school.
"There was one [time] when 1 was taking eight
classes in one quarter." Tung said. "I created this
tool, which turned into diffbot later, to check a set of
URLs for updates and then let me know exactly
what had changed. What I could do was I could add
all of the URLs for all of my classes, and whenever
a professor uploads new lecture slides or a new
homework assignment or test results. I would be the
first person to know, even before they announced
it."
The goal of diffbot is to make unstructured data
on the Internet — in a Web page, for example
more easily accessible to people.
