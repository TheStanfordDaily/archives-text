## Upczuk Socialism's no fun 
### 
I happen to have a great deal of hair. So
much hair, in fact, that I've been accused
of being some sort of smelly, tree-hugging
Marxist who knows nothing about econom
ics. An anti-American nutter. A commie.
With great regret, 1 would like to inform
the world that these accusations are entirely
true.
1 reject the imperialist, pro-market agen
da of The Economist. Warren Buffet and
Martha Stewart. With their top hats and bar
barous wiles, these malevolent capitalists
have kept us down for far too long. 1 say.
The time has come for something new.
The time has come to cast off our chains
and do away with exploitive myths like "free
trade." "money" and "numbers" — social
constructions that do nothing but keep the
poor man writhing in squalor while the rich
man uses government bailout money to
stage a multimillion-dollar junket complete
with risque ice sculptures and wildly gyrating
exotic dancers who will sing your favorite
tunes for tip money. (Also, 1 think there were
refreshments.)
The time has come. I say!
Melt the ice sculptures! Halt the gyra
tions! Regurgitate the refreshments! Silence
Jim Cramer and with a raucous drum, bring
out the cannons — the revolution has come!
As 1 said. I know nothing about econom
ics.
American hero Lyndon Laßouche does,
however. Or at least that's what the friendly
men standing around campus, handing out
dramatic flyers and asking if 1 have $7(X) bil
lion to spare tell me.
Laßouche is a delightful quasi-socialist
and eight-time candidate for president — 1
won't mention how he's also an anti-Semite,
because he tends to sue people for saying
that — whose main activity these days seems
to be convincing eager young men to flood
Math 51 lecture halls with terrifying propa
ganda.
Aware of Laßouche's socialist past, 1
made a remark to one of his supporters
about Barack Obama being our savior. He
looked at me askance and kept talking about
the bailout.
He must have been a racist.
But bigotry aside, he had some pretty
good points. The big-shot money men on
Wall Street were keeping us down and out,
he said. They'd been gambling with our
money and then spreading the risk of that
gambling around to everyone else, using
some magic thingamajig called a "deriva
tive."
Derivatives, it turns out, are financial in
struments that rely on the fortunes of other
financial instruments. Futures are one com
mon variety.
And this Laßouche groupie just may
have been on to something with all his talk
about derivatives. Last Friday,The New York
Times related some intriguing comments
made by Mr. Free Market himself — former
Fed Chairman Alan "Why-the-hell-did-we
let-a-guy-who-h ad-sleepovers-at-Ayn-
Rand's-house-control-t he-Federal -Re
serve?" Greenspan,a.k.a. Al[i] G.
Quoth The Times:
"[Greenspan] noted that the immense
and largely unregulated business of spread

ing financial risk widely, through the use of
exotic financial instruments called deriva
tives, had gotten out of control and had
added to the havoc of today's crisis."
Wow.
Apparently it was with good reason that
the Laßouche guy complained to me about
derivatives for so long. He seemed most
upset by the existence of the weather deriva
tive — a tool some companies use to hedge
against possible losses due to unfortunate
weather.
According to the Laßouchey, this irre
sponsible speculation had to be stopped.
I agreed quite loudly, all the while think
ing to myself, "1 can make money from pre
dicting the weather?"
When I got home, I tried to get a leg in the
weather futures market. This proved to be
quite complicated and not at all successful.
Apparently you have to be rich for stuff like
that.
And I'm not rich. Not yet, at least.
Morose, 1 gave up on my dream. I brood
ed and went about my boring, quotidian life.
I would have to become rich the old-fash
ioned way. by working hard and buying pres
ents for my boss' kids.
1 accepted my ordinary fate.
But then, one day, in a flash. I remem
bered the solution to every other problem
I've encountered this year: the Internet!
Enter intrade.com and intrade.net.
These two Web sites allow you to bet on
the outcomes of a wide range of events, in
areas as diverse as politics, entertainment, fi
nance and — yes — weather, lntrade.net is
almost identical to intrade.com.except that it
allows users to create their own events for
betting, while intrade.com does not.
Users can place money on Barack Obama
winning Nevada, GM selling 15,000 Chevy
Volts by 2012 or Lindsay Lohan baring it all
for Playboy.
In 2004, Intrade attracted quite a bit of at
tention when it correctly predicted the out
come of every single state in the presidential
election, even while exit polls differed.
Wow.
I knew very quickly that I had to get in on
that. There was absolutely no way I could
pass up this opportunity to make free money
by guessing the future — and in so doing fi
nally realize my capitalist agency.
So I registered a free account, transferred
some money and started making predictions.
I'm not going to tell you exactly what hap
pened next, because I don't want to lip my
hand too much, but let me just say that the
"Ron Paul to win 2008 U.S. Presidential
Election" contract has nowhere to go but up.
A revolution is indeed coming, my
friends. But this one will make me rich.
