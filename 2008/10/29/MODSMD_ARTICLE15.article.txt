## Polling place cutback problematic for community 
### 
The exciting election season, currently
captivating the attention of the Ameri
can public and spicing up many a Stan
ford dorm email listserv. will culminate on
Nov. 4, when the Stanford community will
turn out to vote. Unfortunately, if February's
primary is any indication, thousands of them
will converge at the Graduate Community
Center to all vote at the same time.
That occasion was marked by understand
ably grumpy voters having to wait in long
lines, some queuing up for over an hour be
fore they were able to enter the polling place
and cast their votes. As the state of California
makes a concerted effort to promote the
vote-by-mail system as a way to ease polling
place overcrowding on Election Day, county
officials in Santa Clara County and else
where are phasing out polling places in
precincts where there are not enough voters.
This frees up resources and poll workers for
bigger districts with more voters, but leaves
the Stanford community in the lurch.
The problem is California Elections Code,
Section 3(X)5. which deems all precincts with
fewer than 250 resident voters "vote-by-mail
precincts,'" and does not require counties to
provide polling places for these voters. In
stead, they are mailed ballots that they can re
turn through the mail or drop off in some
other precinct in their county on Election
Day. Because so many Stanford students are

registered elsewhere in the country, only one
precinct on campus has at least 250 voters and
Santa Clara County is only required to allot
the Stanford campus one place to cast votes.
This will inevitably create the congestion and
long lines that lead some to skip the vote.
This vote-by-mail classification seems like
a reasonable policy for spread-out rural dis
tricts where election by mail is a cheaper and
easier alternative. But in a 2007 San Diego
Union-Tribune op-ed.two political scientists
from UCSD and Temple shared the results of
a study of California vote-by-mail precincts
where they found participation rates to be
more than two percent lower in such
precincts compared to similar ones across the
state.This turnout decrease seems like a like
ly scenario at Stanford, where several thou
sand students and local residents must crowd
into the GCC to cast a ballot if they wish to
vote in person or drop off their ballot.
While it might be wise to amend the law to
require extra polling places for adjacent
groups of small precincts, there is nothing
Stanford can do about getting another polling
station in time for November's election.
But there is something that voters can do
to avoid the long lines on Election Day: vote
by mail. Voting by mail is the easiest way to
avoid the hassle of long lines at the Graduate
Community Center and to ease the strain on
poll workers and those Stanford voters who

are not able or willing to mail in their ballots.
While the deadline to apply for a ballot has
passed, many locally registered voters will be
sent one automatically â€” make sure to
check your mailbox to see if you've been
mailed one by the county.
Voters should also remember to come
prepared to the polling place, having already
studied the candidates and propositions. If
voters take up less time in the booths, the line
will move along more quickly.
Stanford is home to many who will be vot
ing for the first time in November. That land
mark in each person's civic life should be cause
for celebration, but anyone who has to wait an
hour to cast his vote won't feel much like cele
brating. The editorial board encourages every
one to get out and vote, but hopes that many
students will avoid the long lines and join the
nearly half of voters statewide who will be vot
ing by mail in this historic election.
