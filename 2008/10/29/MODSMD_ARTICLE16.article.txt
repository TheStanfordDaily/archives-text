## Cheers to global warming, part one 
### 
If Absolut vodka had to propose an ideal
solution to global warming, what would it
be?
Simple: "Add more ice."
The line may be an obvious one for a drink
company, yet when paired with the distinct
character of the Absolut campaign, it be
comes loaded with all kinds of meaning. So
today, just as a little prep exercise. I want you
to step back and ask yourself a question:
What would life would be like "in an Absolut
world"?
That is the very question that the Absolut
ad campaign."ln an Absolut World." poses to
consumers, hoping that their ads will strike a
chord with the answers of their target demo
graphic. It's a lofty concept for a vodka ad:
ITiese ads presume to be a slice of life in an
ideal world, a window of escape inviting con
sumers to indulge in their dreams.
Yet however lofty.it is undeniably a genius
move to guide consumers into associating
your product with their wildest dreams —
that is, if you can find out exactly what those
are. But contrary to the central pun of this
campaign, ideals are rarely absolute. Even if
you succeed in pinpointing the ideal of one
group, ideals inevitably vary along cultural,
political and social lines. The only absolute is
that it is absolutely impossible to cater to
everybody's fantasy.
Absolut tried specializing their ads to ap
peal to specific groups of people, only to run
into criticism for appealing to controversial
sentiments like nationalism.To win the glob
al popularity contest, they needed to come up

with an ad that would portray an ideal relat
ing to an issue affecting every human on
Earth. Does such an issue even exist? Coinci
dentally, yes. In that respect, global warming
may just be a godsend for the Absolut mar
keters.
The ad itself features an aerial view of a
generic slice of planet Earth. Out of a break
in the clouds come two obviously male hands
cracking ice out of an old-fashioned ice tray
into the ocean. I"hc image echoes a tried and
true crowd pleaser: the deus ex machina
cure-all. the classic alls-well-that-ends-well
finish. The hands of God reach out of the sky
and put ice back in our oceans, to the delight
of us all at not having to do anything our
selves.
Let's just ignore for now the fact that this
"ideal" solution almost horrifically com
pounds one of the effects of global warming
— theoretically, additional ice would just
melt in overly warm water temperatures and
contribute further to rising sea levels. No, I'm
more interested in what made the Absolut
advertisers think that this particular scenario
would be the ideal for consumers. Because I

think they are right. 1 think that most con
sumers wish that they could keep living ex
actly as they have been living, while someone
else makes the global warming problem dis
appear for them.
In an ideal world, instead of everybody
chipping in to fix the problem of climate
change, none of us would have to help solve
the problem at all.
Why? There are several reasons. We, as
consumers, like instant gratification. The
things we can do to temper global warming
are not instant gratification courses of action.
Hie solutions are long-term, far-reaching
and will affect future generations more than
they will affect us. Doing something about it
now involves mostly cost on our part, while
the benefits appear way down the road. So it
makes sense that we would like to see ice
dropped in the ocean (by someone else) and
be done with it.
And note that some entity other than our
selves is doing the problem solving. We don't
like that pesky Earth, with its menopausal
climate mood swings, messing with our lives.
In fact, most of the time, we don't really like
to admit that we are part of the earth at all. It
is something other,out there, and we'd like it
best if we weren't involved.
This Absolut ad portrays an ideal scenario
that encourages us to hope that we will never
have to change our lifestyle to save our plan
et. Moreover, it sends us the message that
harboring this ideal in our heart of hearts is

OK. But the problem of climate
change isn't going to go away —
whether or not you believe it is
caused by man. Wishing that it wilt
go away only sets us back instead of
solving the problems ahead of us.
Because while it is acceptable to
be overwhelmed bv the enormity of
climate change, it is simply not ac
ceptable for a global citizen to wish
he or she could relegate the problem
to someone — or something — else.
Don't let this ideal speak to your
inner desires. We no longer need
God as a machine to get us out of our
messes.
All we need is a little ingenuity —
and the willpower to implement it.
