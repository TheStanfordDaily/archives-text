## No on Prop. 8 
### 
I don't know how we're blowing this.
Proposition 8, which purports to change
California's constitution to remove the
California Supreme Court-sanctioned right
of same-sex couples to marry, seems to he
winning by up to eight percent. Not cool.
1 can't believe that I have to articulate this,
but being gay should not be a big deal. Like
anyone else, most gay people live decent, ethi
cal lives and contribute to the betterment of
our society and our country.They are perfectly
capable of being loving partners and parents,
and they should be entitled to the same respect
that marriage gives heterosexual couples.
Straightforward as that seems to me, I
wanted to give Prop K's sponsors a fair shake,
so I checked out protectmarriage.com.
ITie first thing that struck me: the word
"protect." It's powerful. It implies that,
should Prop. H fail, untold terrors — gay cou
ples? Godzilla? — will actively destroy mar
riage, and perhaps even society,as we know it.
I genuinely feel bad for heterosexual cou
ples whose marriage value hinges on Prop. H's
outcome. Marriage isn't a party that gets ru
ined as soon as unwanted guests show upjike
some special dinner Testimony crashes. Mar
riage is about a commitment two people
make, regardless of their genders, to spend
their lives together. Nothing else.
At least a third of Protect Marriage's
budget comes from — and I swear I am not
making this up, just check out the Wall Street
Journal — Mormons, many of whom are
from out of state.
While Mormons have strong values, an ex -

cellent hoys' choir and an unparalleled abili
ty to craft family trees, the Salt Lake Tribune
estimates that there are up to 18,000 people
living in "polyamorous relationships" in
Utah. Great as you are. Mormons, you're not
exactly in the best position to defend the
sanctity of marriage.
Mormons aside, Protectmarriage.com is a
pretty nifty site. It has a Facebook page, a
Twittering feature and lots of pictures of smil
ing, white families. Homophobia, I must
admit, has never looked so good.
Unfortunately, the organization clutters
the page with their views, including the fol
lowing dire consequence of allowing gay
marriage:
"Because public schools are already re
quired to teach the role of marriage in socie
ty as part of the curriculum, schools will now
be required to teach students that gay mar
riage is the same as traditional marriage,
starting with kindergarteners."
The horror!
