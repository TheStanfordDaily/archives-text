## No on Prop. 8 
### 
I don't know how we're blowing this.
Proposition 8, which purports to change
California's constitution to remove the
California Supreme Court-sanctioned right
of same-sex couples to marry, seems to he
winning by up to eight percent. Not cool.
1 can't believe that I have to articulate this,
but being gay should not be a big deal. Like
anyone else, most gay people live decent, ethi
cal lives and contribute to the betterment of
our society and our country.They are perfectly
capable of being loving partners and parents,
and they should be entitled to the same respect
that marriage gives heterosexual couples.
Straightforward as that seems to me, I
wanted to give Prop K's sponsors a fair shake,
so I checked out protectmarriage.com.
ITie first thing that struck me: the word
"protect." It's powerful. It implies that,
should Prop. H fail, untold terrors — gay cou
ples? Godzilla? — will actively destroy mar
riage, and perhaps even society,as we know it.
I genuinely feel bad for heterosexual cou
ples whose marriage value hinges on Prop. H's
outcome. Marriage isn't a party that gets ru
ined as soon as unwanted guests show upjike
some special dinner Testimony crashes. Mar
riage is about a commitment two people
make, regardless of their genders, to spend
their lives together. Nothing else.
At least a third of Protect Marriage's
budget comes from — and I swear I am not
making this up, just check out the Wall Street
Journal — Mormons, many of whom are
from out of state.
While Mormons have strong values, an ex -

cellent hoys' choir and an unparalleled abili
ty to craft family trees, the Salt Lake Tribune
estimates that there are up to 18,000 people
living in "polyamorous relationships" in
Utah. Great as you are. Mormons, you're not
exactly in the best position to defend the
sanctity of marriage.
Mormons aside, Protectmarriage.com is a
pretty nifty site. It has a Facebook page, a
Twittering feature and lots of pictures of smil
ing, white families. Homophobia, I must
admit, has never looked so good.
Unfortunately, the organization clutters
the page with their views, including the fol
lowing dire consequence of allowing gay
marriage:
"Because public schools are already re
quired to teach the role of marriage in socie
ty as part of the curriculum, schools will now
be required to teach students that gay mar
riage is the same as traditional marriage,
starting with kindergarteners."
The horror!

OK. first things first: I went to Cal
ifornia public school, and I don't recall
ever spending much time discussing
the importance of marriage. As a stu
dent. I was too busy learning to read,
add and not eat crayons anymore.
And frankly, I'm glad 1 remember
more about George Washington and
photosynthesis than I do about mar
riage's role as the fundamental build
ing block of society because it means
that my teachers were teaching me
what they should have been: facts.
Less anecdotally, the decision to
include marriage in public school
curriculums falls not on the state but
on locallv elected school boards.

which parents strongly influence.
LOGIC SMASH!
Secondly, the ruling stated that
gay marriage and "traditional" mar
riage must be treated equally and
with respect under the law. not that
they're identical. Churches can still
choose whether they want to recog
nize vows taken by gay people, and
individuals can still believe that gay
people and their supporters (i.e. me)
are going to Hell. Everyone wins.
13ut that's not really what bugs
you, is it. Protect Marriage.com?
You're worried that, if we teach kids
that gay marriage and straight mar
riage are exactly the same, your son
Steve will go marry his friend Tom.
aren't you? Well, rest assured —
most studies show that sexual orien
tation is determined before birth or,
at the very latest, by age five.
And maybe, just maybe, if we can

learn to accept sexual orientation as
part of who we are, independent of
character, we won't see as many clos
eted, confused Congressmen paying
to give head to strangers in public
restrooms.
Then again, maybe I'm a dreamer.
The Web site goes on to state that
in 20(K).61 percent of voters opposed
a proposition to allow gay marriage,
and all it took was four "activist
judges" to overrule that decision. We
Americans are proud, strong and ca
pable. but we are stubborn as hell:
and I think sometimes.as with deseg
regating schools, that it takes "ac
tivist judges" to bring us into the fair
society we should be in.
Oh. and by the way. both houses
of the California State Legislature
— which California citizens elected
— have repeatedly passed laws sup
porting the all-inclusive definition of

marriage. Save for the governor's re
peated vetoes, gay marriage would
be supported by both our state con
stitution and California law.
So please, go to phone banks.Talk
to family, friends and total strangers.
Wear those awesome purple shirts.
Imply that Prop 8 supporters are
only voting out of denial of their own
repressed homosexuality. It should
n't matter, but maybe it will make
them think twice about voting yes.
Whatever it takes, we have come
too far to lose now. Support gay and
lesbian rights. Support equality. Sup
port marriage. Vote no on Prop. 8.

Kevin sincerely apologizes to any
Mormons, gay people, straight people
or Testimony members he may have
offended, provided they're voting no
on Prop. S. You can email him at
