The report in the Oct. 27 issue of
The Daily ("Rice planning return to
the Farm") that Condoleezza Rice
plans to return to Stanford will un
doubtedly provoke arguments over
whether she should be barred from
teaching — or even from campus —
because she was one of the policy
makers in a Bush administration
that launched an illegal and unnec
essary war. undermined the Consti
tution and blatantly defied Con
gress.
A more convincing reason Rice
should not be allowed to return to
teaching is that she has repeatedly
lied. A campus is a place where di
verse opinions and ideas should be
welcome, but where lies should not
be tolerated. In Berlin on Dec. 5.
2005, Rice said. "The United States
does not permit, tolerate or condone
torture under any circumstances."
Yet Rice was a chief policy adviser in

an administration that authorized
hanging prisoners by their wrists, at
taching electrodes to their genitals,
subjecting them to simulated drown
ing and exposing them to extremes of
heat and cold.
When F. 8.1, agents and the in
spector general reported to the ad
ministration last May that they had
seen prisoners sexually humiliated,
shackled in painful positions for long
periods, isolated for months and
threatened with attack dogs, Rice
continued to maintain that the Unit
ed States did not practice torture. By
now. the Bush administration's bru
tal and illegal policies have been well
documented. If Rice returns to cam
pus. she should at the very least be
asked to explain her role in authoriz
ing them.
