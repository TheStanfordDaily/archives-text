## MLS ENTICES PLAYERS 
### BY JACOB JOHNSON DESK EDITOR 
Every year, a handful of Stanford varsity athletes go
pro. Some play in the United States.others in Europe
or elsewhere around the globe. Football, basketball
and baseball players are the most common — after
all. those are the big money sports in America.
Meanwhile, the occasional water polo player, swimmer or
gymnast who pursues a professional career in his sport is the
exception rather than the rule. Most sports simply do not at
tract enough attention to support professional leagues, in the
States or anywhere else.
The men of the Stanford soccer team are stuck somewhere
in the middle. Yes. there is Major League Soccer. Yes.soccer is
king in other parts of the world. But the level of competition
jn Europe is extraordinarily high — only the best of the best
in the United States make it overseas. Which leaves the MLS
and a couple of lower-level leagues in the United States as the
main professional soccer options available.
Yet some of the Stanford footballers aren't ready to leave
the game — despite the uncertainty of a career in the MLS.
Junior keeper John Moore is one of those players. After
exploring options in the corporate world, he has decided to
pursue a career in the sport he loves.
"Being a pro athlete is much more appealing." he said.
Redshirt senior Ryan Imamura agreed with his keeper. He
knows that he will probably end up in business, but wants to
take advantage of the opportunity to play while he can.
"I'm at least going to try." Imamura said. Working a day
job might be inevitable for him. but he's in no rush to get start
ed.
"It'd be nice to put that off for a while." he added.
Junior midfielder Michael Strickland is another player
with aspirations to play professional soccer. Strickland, an
economics major, didn't initially plan on going pro. Though
still undecided, last year he began to seriously consider a ca
reer in the sport.
The timing of the MLS season is a complicating factor.The
league holds its annual combine for amateur players in Janu
ary and the draft takes place shortly thereafter. The season
takes place in the spring and summer. Clearly, this is problem
atic for a Stanford student trying to complete his degree.
"You have to start planning by the end of freshman year,"
Strickland said. "You have to load up on units — especially
major units. I started late,so I would have to take two summer
school classes and 18 to 20 units next fall and winter [in order
to graduate early and play next year]."
Players must be invited to the MLS combine.
and invitations don't go out until December.

Add to that the uncertainty of the draft, and most players
have little or no idea of where they will end up — if they get
drafted at all.
That uncertainty has been on senior defender Tim Jones'
mind for years. 1 le came to Stanford intent on making it in the
pros. Now. he's not so sure.
"I was more excited about going pro when I came in as a
freshman." Jones said. "As the four years go on, you realize
how much MLS players get paid and how long the season is."
Jones, also an economics major, has weighed the pros and
cons and is leaning towards "going into corporate America."
But if he receives an invitation this December, he admits the
decision will be tough.
"I haven't completely made up my mind." he said."l would
have to sit down ... and discuss what's best for me."
Whatever lie chooses, his passion for soccer will never dis
appear.
"I'm definitely going to miss the game." Jones said.
Fortunately, those players considering a career in pro soc
cer have a few valuable sources to turn to for advice, starting
with head coach Bret Simon. Since coming to the Farm in
2001, Simon has developed a number of current professional
players. These include Chad Marshall (who played for Stan
ford from 2002-2003), a defender for the Columbus Crew who
has played with the USA National Team: and Ryan Nelsen
('01). currently playing for the Blackburn Rovers of the Eng
lish Premier League. Simon's success comes from both his
technical expertise and the care he has for his players.

"He's had so much success because of his quality as a
coach," Strickland said. "He's well established in soccer cir
cles, and he's a very caring coach on a personal level."
Another source of guidance for those players who want to
go pro is associate head coach Rob Becerra. Although he has
developed strong relationships with many of the players —
Strickland noted that Becerra has been instrumental in his
development — his role as the goalkeeper coach has brought
him especially close to the Stanford goalies.
"Rob has been a really big influence on me." Moore said.
Strickland and his teammates have no problem as far as
prioritizing the Cardinal's team goals and their personal aspi
rations. The two are actually complimentary.
"Winning teams get more looks." Strickland said. "There
are very talented people who haven't gotten the attention
they deserve [because they are on losing teams]."
"Winning teams play more televised games and garner
more attention nation-wide." he added.
And that means individual players get more opportunities
to show off their skills for professional teams.
The Stanford men are hoping to end a disappointing 200K
season on a positive note. A late-season win streak would
boost the team's morale and build momentum for next year.
And for some of the team's seniors, it could mean attracting
the attention of MLS scouts — and the chance for a career in
Major League Soccer.
