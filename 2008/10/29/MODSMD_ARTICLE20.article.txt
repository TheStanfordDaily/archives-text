# LAST CHAMP STANDING
## 
### BY ANTHONY NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As the only remaining member of the 2(H)6
NCAA Championship squad, senior Jessi
ca Nguyen has seen quite a bit in her time
on the Stanford women's tennis team, in
cluding a perfect season.
Nguyen, who is one of only three upperclassmen on
the squad, surely seems like the elder statesman on a
young Cardinal team, which has an astounding six un
derclassmen.
"I think that there's a lot to carry on to the incoming
classes," Nguyen said of the Stanford tradition. "We
have so many new faces here. It's weird having only
three upperclassmen on the team."
Once an incoming freshman on the team herself,
Nguyen understands the importance of strong leader
ship. Back in 2(K)b. NCAA champion Amber Liu *06
took Nguyen under her wing and was one of her
strongest influences that year.
"We both entered Stanford coming from similar sit
uations with tennis and schooling," Nguyen said of I iu.
"That really helped me adjust. I know how much it
helped me, and I'm looking forward to taking on that
role this year as well."
And with experience and seniority comes great re
sponsibility. As a co-captain for this year's squ;id,
Nguyen has already begun leading the team by exam
ple from day one.
"There's a lot of unspoken leadership," Nguyen said.
"There are a lot of things that upperclassmen take for
granted as far as knowledge goes — the way we carry
ourselves in practice, in workout, on and off the court.
Our responsibilities are to be accountable for ourselves
and each other, and that's something the freshmen look
up to."
Certainly,there is much to learn in the transition into
collegiate tennis, whether it be juggling practice and

schoolwork or adapting to the team atnic>sphere
of the sport. And in recent years, it's been much

tougher.as the squad has become further re
moved from their national championship.

When Nguyen entered Stanford,the C'ar
dinal was the No. 1 team in the nation
and rightfully high on confidence.

"Coming in my freshmen year, we were two-time
defending NCAA champions," Nguyen said. "Confi
dence was really high — we were the best team in the
country and [head coach] Lele [Forood] stressed that
with us. It's a different mentality coming in.since we lost
the past two years.
"Establishing that confidence and getting back to
the Stanford tradition will be important for us." Nguyen
added.
From going through an undefeated season and na
tional championship to a young squad. Nguyen under
stands her role on the team as the last remaining link to
past champions.
"My role has increased every year,playing higher on
the team and now being the captain of the team."
Nguyen said. "It's different in that everything that I do
is watched,even when I don't know it.it puts pressure
on me. but it's something that I enjoy because having
experience over the years has helped me be the leader."
More importantly, Nguyen uses her stories from her
lone championship season to motivate her teammates to
achieve more.
"I try to tell them how amazing it is, but you really
can't express how it feels in words — that's the most in
credible thing about it." Nguyen said."l try to tell every
one on the team and their eyes get bigger and it makes
them work harder every day. I try to tell them,and at the
end of the day. hopefully they get to experience it as
well."
Right now, the most important thing to Nguyen is
building team chemistry and camaraderie.To survive a
long, testing season, the ability to count on each other
will be key to Stanford's success.
"We're a really close team in general," the Cardinal
senior said. "We spend time with each other on and off
the courts. We hang out on the weekend and have train
ing table every night, so we get to spend time with each
other bonding off the court in ;i non-pressure environ
ment."
Hut when January comes, the expectations are high
er than ever, especially with Nguyen in her last year on
the team. Despite its young age, Stanford is expected to
be in serious contention for the national championship.
"It's in the back of everybody's mind — it's a long
road to May, and we're working hard every day for that
tournament," she said. "We're excited to start the sea-
