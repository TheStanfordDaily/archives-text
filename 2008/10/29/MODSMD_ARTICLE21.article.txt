# Selig is a misguided rebel
## 
### 
Prior to the start of Monday's
Game 5 of the World Series, I
was ready to pen a column
today describing how,despite the lack
of a certain media-driven hype, the
2(M)8 series would eventually go down
in history as the spectacular dawning
of a new age for Major League Base
ball.
1 had it all planned out. I was going
to propose the creation of a new All-
StarTeam.theTampadelphia Raylies.
which would consist only of players
from the two league champion teams
and would take on a roster filled with
the rest of MLB's best at the '09 All-
Star break.
It would've been fun to discuss the
ramifications of an infield composed
of Ryan Howard. Chase Utley, Jimmy
Rollins and Evan Longoria.with Car
los Pena at the DH spot (the Raylies,
you see. play by AL rules in Philadel
phia's stadium, for no reason other
than the convenience of this construct
to my column). I'd get to talk about a
pitching staff with Cole Hamels, Brad
Lidge. Matt Garza and David Price. It
would've been a story chock-full of
observations about how the com
bined rosters of Philadelphia and
Tampa Bay would feature one of the
most valuable players in baseball
(based on talent, age and cost) at vir
tually every position on the diamond
and every spot on the roster.
It would've been whimsical. It
would've been fun. It probably
wouldn't have been that entertaining
to most of you. but I would've gotten
a kick out of writing it.
But then. Bud Selig just had to
come along and make things a lot eas
ier for me. and a lot angstier (if it's not
a word, it should be) for all of you.
Bud. you see, failed to read a
weather forecast correctly, and decid
ed to go ahead with the scheduled
start of Game 5 in Philadelphia.Then,
everything rolled along pretty well for
about five innings before Mother Na
ture remembered, "Hey, it's late Oc
tober in Philadelphia ... shouldn't
this weather be a little more in
clement?"
Cue the monsoon.
Tampa Bay, possibly aided by the
conditions, tied the game at 2-2 in the
top of the sixth. And then Selig. by far
the least popular of the four major
American professional sports com
missioners, was faced with a decision
he doubtlessly wished he could have
avoided. Given the unplayable condi
tions. the game had to be postponed
and continued later,just as soon as the
weather would allow.
The decision itself was the right
one. You can't call the game a tie (ob
viously). and there was no way that
weather was letting up anytime soon.
And unlike some commentators who
are roasting Selig for his decision to
even play the game. I can't blame the
man for not being a meteorologist.
I lopefully, he had qualified people
advising him before the game on the
prospective weather conditions, and if
lie did and they were just wrong, hey,
it happens. The weather in Northern
California may not lead you to be
lieve it, but as a Midwesterner. let me
tell you, predicting this stuff is still def
initely an inexact science.
Selig deserves our ire, but not for
the weather that hit in the middle of
the game. Rather, he deserves it for
the very fact that an alternative solu
tion that was possibly considered was
to follow MLB's regular season rules,
in which, if a game is rained out after
the fifth inning and one team is lead
ing, then that team is declared the
winner.
Of course, baseball's fearless
leader was quick to declare following
the game that he never would have let
the outcome of a World Series C Jame
come to that. 1 le even declared lie was
"standing on very solid ground" while
clutching a rulebook.
Ilie thing is. though, you're not.
Bud. You're right â€” a World Series
game shouldn't be decided by any
thing less than a full nine innings of
play. I think we're all KM) percent with
you on that one. But to arbitrarily de
cide at the last minute that, in this case,
you're not going to follow your own
rules because it would be bad for base
ball,simply because of the high-profile
