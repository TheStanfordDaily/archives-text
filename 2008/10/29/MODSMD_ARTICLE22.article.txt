# SENIOR SHOT
## 
### BY CLAUDIA PRECIADO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Three years ago, Will Hindle-Katel distin
guished himself from an array of colle
giate water polo players and was named
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) Newcomer of the Year. Now a
senior. Hindle-Katel has continued to outdo him
self every year, whether by earning more titles,
scoring more goals or bringing more intensity than
ever before.
"Being a part of the Stanford water polo team is
what's meaningful to me," Hindle-Katel said. "It's
been a real privilege to be a part of it for four years,
and I've been very lucky to be able to play a big
part in it. I'm trying to do my best to hold up to
those standards and take all the collective wisdom
from all those that came before me and help the
team with that."
Soaking in the traditions, the legends and the
expectations of a storied Stanford program. Hin
dle-Katel dove into the NCAA finals as a fresh
man,only to be left with a sour aftertaste as the top
ranked Cardinal lost by a single goal to No. 2
UCLA.
"It's bittersweet obviously because we lost." he
said. "It was a bit surreal for me freshman year be
cause I had just come in. [But] the team meeting
before the game was very cool for me because I was
very excited to play, obviously."
Stanford reached the finals again in his sopho
more year, but this time was downed bv (JSC.
Now in the 2008 season. I lindle-Katel has devot
ed himself to once again reaching the title game
— his exemplary work ethic proves just that. Not
only does he key in on self-improvement, but he
also classifies himself as a relentless observer of
the game. By studying his opponents' strengths
and weaknesses, as well as knowing his own. Hin
dle-Katel is able to consistently make better deci
sions in the pool.
"I try to play disciplined; I try to play tough; I try

to play intelligently," he said. "I go through all the
scenarios that I think I'll he in the game, and there
are certain positions that I'll likely be in when the
game starts.Then, when 1 get in the game, I feel like
I'm a little bit more prepared when that situation
does arise."
Behind Hindle-Katel is an interconnected sup
port system from which he extracts the desire and
willpower to play.
"My parents have always been there for me," he
said. "It's that type of dedication that I take from
them. I'm doing them and myself a disservice if I
don't give what I do everything I have because
they're giving me everything they have. I've always
had people that are encouraging me and support
ing me along the way. It makes all the difference."
Such encouragement has not only helped Hin
dle-Katel in the pool, but outside of it as well.
Bound for medical school with hopes of becoming
a doctor. Hindle-Katel wants to apply his skills to a
task that's already in progress, but he is also always
looking ahead to the next challenge.
"I went to Cape Town for a quarter and I really
enjoyed being there," he said."We did some public
health work [where] I worked in an HIV clinic. It'
was a cool experience. I'm taking a year off before
med school and I'm thinking of working abroad." .
With four years under his belt, Hindle-Katel has
developed the perspective of a true senior. After
having taken in the essence of the Stanford com
munity and the many opportunities it offers —
such as his current job in an Alzheimer's lab — he.
exudes a feeling of being fortunate to have seen'
and done so much.
"You're surrounded by such amazing people all
the time." he said. "I think it's inspiring. Everyone
you meet here is extraordinary, and it's important
to remember that while you're here. You need to


PAUL ZAICH/The Stanford Daily
learn to appreciate everyone's ex
traordinary talents; learning from
everyone around you is one of the
best parts of being here."
Being an athlete changes your
take on life, whether you're more ag
gressive, whether your teamwork im
proves or whether you learn to enjoy
each moment more than before; it all
extends from that experience. Once

you near the end of one career, like
Hindle-Katel, you realize the satis
faction it brings.
"it's very fulfilling to be able to
work toward a certain goal and then
see the results when you get out
there," he said. "You can feel the dif
ference when you've worked on
something and feel that you've im
proved. Not only are you achieving
something for yourself, but you're
achieving something for your
friends."
