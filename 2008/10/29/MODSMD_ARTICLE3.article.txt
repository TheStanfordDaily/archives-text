# GCC to be only polling place
## Voters urged to come to polls prepared or vote early by mail; long lines expected 
### MATT SERNA 
Despite requests for a second polling
center on Stanford's campus to ease voter
congestion. Santa Clara County has desig
nated the Graduate Community Center
(GCC) as the sole polling place on cam
pus.
Voters can expect to see more of the
long lines that marred February's primary
election, as the only change the County
has made to Stanford's voting situation is
the addition of extra poll workers, along
with advertising recommending that stu
dents vote early or by mail.
Due to an unexpectedly large turnout,
lines at the February election stretched to
over two-hour wait times.
ITie decision to not add another polling
place was largely influenced by county
election policies, which outline conditions
for the addition of a new polling center.
According to Elma Rosas, spokesperson
for the Registrar of Voters office, the
County is not required to establish polling
centers in precincts with fewer than 250
registered non-absentee voters.
Though students have been remarkably
active in this election cycle, and there has
been a robust voter registration drive on
campus, most students are absentee voters
or are registered in their home states. As a
result, only one Stanford precinct, which
includes parts of East Campus and some
residential areas, meets the requirements
to obtain a polling center.
Several polling centers will be open
near campus, including one at Escondido

Elementary School and another at
University Lutheran School.
To help facilitate the voting process and
ease long lines at the polls, Santa Clara
County is strongly pushing students to vote
by mail.
"We expect almost 70 percent of Santa
Clara County's likely voters to vote by
mail," Rosas said.
A majority of students living on campus
are registered under vote-by-mail
precincts; these students have their ballots
mailed to them automatically and can mail
them in early or turn them in on Election
Day.
Both the County and the Stanford
Voter Registration Coalition agree that
this is the best option for both voters and
the county. Students who do not want to
mail in their ballots but wish to avoid the
hassle of long lines have the option of
dropping their ballots off the Monday
before Election Day at the GCC.
Despite the County's attempts to miti
gate long lines with an increased emphasis
on mail-in voting. Stanford Democrats
President Ashwin Mudaliar "09 believes
congestion will be exceptionally high due
to the historic nature of the election.
"We want to make sure that the voting
process is as smooth as possible." Mudaliar
said.
Congestion at the polls results not only
from the number of people voting, but also
because many voters are unprepared.
According to Santa Clara Registrar of
Voters Jesse Durazo. who has been moni
toring Santa Clara's single in-person early

vote polling center, voter preparation is
one of the most critical factors affecting
long lines.
"It is very apparent that half of the vot
ers are taking as long as 25 minutes to vote
because they are unprepared."
Durazo urged voters to come to the polls

prepared and ready to vote so they occupy
as little time as possible in the center.
