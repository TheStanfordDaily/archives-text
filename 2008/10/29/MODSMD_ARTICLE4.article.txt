# STUDENT GOV'T
## Mausoleum Party moved to Old Union 
### MARISA LANDICHO 
For over 20 years, students have cele
brated I lalloween with Leland, Leland Jr.
and Jane Stanford at the Mausoleum,
which holds their remains. But unless
Stanford's founding family will he relocat
ed underneath the Axe & Palm, the 20-
year tradition will be put on hold this
year.
Junior Class co-President Jonathan
Kass '10 revealed at last night's
Undergraduate Senate meeting that due
to a forecast of rain, the event cannot be
held outdoors at the Mausoleum.
According to co-President Risha Bera
'10, the Party will be relocated to Old
Union.
"[Old Union] will definitely get a dif
ferent sort of reaction," Bera said.
"However, it's a great way to welcome the
new Old Union building."
Bera and Kass are still working on
ways to re-create the feeling of the
Mausoleum's outdoor lawn party inside
of Old Union.
"What's probably going to happen is

moving all the furniture out of Old Union
sometime during the day." Kass said.
The first and second floors of Old
Union will be completely cleared out. and
the party will be held in the emptied
building. The Mausoleum Party will be
the first event of its kind to be held in Old
Union.
Yesterday morning, at what was sup
posed to be the final coordination meet
ing before the event, planners realized
that with a high chance of rain on Friday,
they could not use generators at the
Mausoleum.
"| Rain | doesn't seem like that much of
a problem, besides killing the party
atmosphere, but you cannot rent genera
tors in the rain — that would blow the cir
cuit." Kass said. "That means no DJ, that
means no lights, that means no party."
"People love the Mausoleum Party
and would probably still come out in the
rain," Bera added, "but we also want it to
be safe."
In order to salvage the party. Bera and
Kass decided to change the venue and
hope for the best.

This will not be the first year the
Halloween party did not go on as
planned.
While a key part of Stanford lore, the
Mausoleum Party, held annually at the
Stanford family's burial site, was revived
in 2006. Due to lack of funding and spon
sorship. the partv was suspended from
2002 to 2005.
At the party's much-publicized reap
pearance in 2006. a power outage left the
sound system useless and party-goers
without music. The debut received only a
lukewarm reception.
Still, organizers estimated that around
S.IKK) students attended the 2006 event,
and attendance last year was also in the
several thousands.
This year's party will still be the first
not held at the fabled burial site off of
Palm Drive.
At last night's meeting, senators
expressed alarm at the change in location,
but they acknowledged that nothing else
could be done to combat the gloomy fore-

Other business discussed at the
meeting included a possible resolu
tion for longer swimming hours in
Avery Pool and a discussion on the
anti-Proposition 8 resolution that
passed at last week's meeting.
On further review of Senate
bylaws. Senator Luukas lives '09
found that the Senate was more
restricted in its advocacy terms than
previously recognized. He concluded
that the Senate really had no author
ity to pass a resolution on Prop. 8.
"We are only really empowered to
pass resolutions on things that not
only affect Stanford students, but
only affect students as Stanford stu
dents." lives said. "That is to say,
regardless of whether you are
enrolled as a Stanford student or not,
the effect on your partnership rights
is the same. Theoretically, that's out
side the scope of the Senate."
