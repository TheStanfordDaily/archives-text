# Questioning Senate advocacy
## 
### JENNY REMPEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hie Undergraduate Senate has taken
an increased role in both political and
campus advocacy over the last several
weeks. While advocacy has been a tradi
tional part of the Senate's activities, it
remains unclear what effect this advocacy
has on the undergraduate population.
Last week's Senate meeting featured
debate over both a resolution to oppose
Proposition 8 and the future of Stanford's
library system.
