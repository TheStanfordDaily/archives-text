In the end. the senators agreed to pass
a resolution that would publicize their
anti-Prop. 8 stance, and put the library
issue on hold.
"We represent the undergraduate com
munity. and we felt there was a critical
mass of people who were engaged in the
[Prop. S] issue" said Senate Chair Tiq
Chapa '11. "We felt we should at least dis
cuss it."
But because the Senate's role is to rep
resent and serve the undergraduate popu
lation. it is questionable whether broad
reaching advocacy is appreciated by the
Senate's constituents.
At last night's meeting,Senator l.uukas
lives i |i » pointed out that the ASSU
Constitution might not even allow some
types of advocacy.
"We are only really empowered to pass
resolutions on things that not only affect
Stanford students, but only affect students
as Stanford students," lives said."That is to
say. regardless of whether you are enrolled
as a Stanford student or not, the effect on
your partnership rights is the same.
Theoretically, that's outside the scope of
the Senate."
lives remarked that since the anti-prop
K resolution has already been passed, a senator
must challenge it on constitutional grounds for it
to be struck down.
Ilie Senate, when not engaged in advocacy,
has in the past focused on addressing topics that
are Stanford-specific, such as extending Green
Library's hours and issuing free bike lights.
"I would contend that [advocacy] is our most
important task because we were elected to serve
on the behalf of the undergraduate students to
advance their interests" said Senator Stuart
Baimel *09, who is also a Daily columnist. "But I
do think our advocacy should be. generally
speaking, limited to things that are affecting
undergrads on campus."
At last week's meeting, Baimel was critical of
the Senate taking on highly political issues.
"To what extent, or at all, are we comfortable
with individual senators turning up lobbying
projects that many of us may actually oppose, or
at the very least feel uncomfortable with?"
Baimel asked last Tuesday.
Senator Ana Diaz-Hernandez '11 said the
ASSU Senate would not spend much time on
political advocacy before next week s election.
Nonetheless, she considered Prop. S to be an
important issue that directly affects many at

Stanford.
"We wanted to take a symbolic stance to the
student body and hopefully to the administration
so that they would do similarly," Diaz-
Hernandez said."The administration often takes
examples from the Senate if they find it com
pelling enough, and a public statement from the
University would have a huge impact on the
issue."
Despite Diaz-Hernandez's optimism, stu
dents may recall the negligible effect the Senate
had last year when they tried to oppose Donald
Rumsfeld's appointment to the Hoover
Institution.
The question of what is pertinent to the
Stanford community is one that some senators
feel is crucial when deciding whether or not to
engage in advocacy.
"What we're going to see is increased Senate
activity for things that are Stanford-specific,"
Baimel said.
Several members of the Senate hope to
address topics such as the expansion of the fresh
man class, a renewed focus on sustainability and
increased undergraduate advising. Baimel was
particularly pleased with the ASSU's success last
year in making course evaluations publicly avail
able on Axess.
"There's more and more to be done," Baimel
said." I think by the end of this school year, we'll
have some tangible accomplishments."
