## Iran aids Iraqi insurgency 
### JULIA BROWNELL 
Colonel Joseph Felter. a national security fellow at the
Hoover Institution, has released 85 pages of information
documenting how Iranian military and Lebanese Hezbollah
forces train Iraqi Shiite militias to attack Coalition Forces in
Iraq.
line documents contain interviews of detained Shiite
Iraqi militants and were released as sources in Felter's
report."lranian Strategy in Iraq: Politics and 'Other Means'"
"i realized many of those detainees were talking about
the same experiences." Felter said about his motivation to
pursue the research.
While noting the limitations of information gathered in
interrogations. Felter said the documents support other
information proving Iran's involvement in Iraq's insurgency
movements.
"[The release] provides some context and some anecdot
al evidence." he said."lt was the human story."
Abbas Milani, I loover research fellow and director of the
Iranian Studies Program.agreed with the humanizing nature
of the evidence. I le felt it was obvious, however, that Iranian
forces have been training insurgent forces in Iraq for some
time.
"[The release] just provides some human details to some
thing I suspect anyone who has been following Iraq and Iran
already knew." Milani said. "I think the argument to be hon
est was. to me, a foregone conclusion."
Felter said that while deployed, he saw evidence of a
weakened Al-Qaeda. mostly as a result of the resistance of
the Iraqi people.
"There has been an awakening in the tribes that Al-
Qaeda in Iraq is not the future they want for their families,"
Felter said.
Still, the colonel did feel the influence of Iran.

"The threat from Iran was insidious
and growing," he added.
The documents also contain
accounts of how the militants were
trained, including reports of how the
militants were taught to travel long dis
tances on foot with a pack and
weapon, how to set up ambushes on
convoys of vehicles and how to fire
AK-475. The detainees also told of
long journeys to training camps out
side of Iraq.
Felter summarized in his paper that
Iran's goal in training the militants is to
limit America's power in the Middle
East and exert political power in Iraq
by drawing on close historical relation
ships with Shiite organizations, and
thus preventing the Sunni majority
from taking power.
"[lran] wants a weakly federated
Iraq." Felter said. "But they don't want
Iraq so weak that it falls back into
chaos."
Felter added that the Iranian mili
tary has worked closely with Shiite
organizations in Iraq in the past, but
that the two groups are actually more
different than most Westerners realize.
"They cooperate when they have a
common enemy" Felter said.
While in Iraq. Felter realized that
the Iranians and the Iraqi Shiites are
actually very ethnically divided, and
that gives him hope for the future.
"As U.S. forces draw down, they
will lose that common enemy, and
those rifts between Persians and Arabs
will rise up." he said.
Iran has denied the claims that its
military has been training the Iraqi
Shiite militias.
"I don't think that we can rely on
their word." Milani said. "This is a
regime that lies and cheats."
With the upcoming election, all
eyes are on the political ramifications
of the evidence of Iran's involvement
in Iraqi insurgencies. The paper puts a
spotlight on the issue of U.S.-Iran rela
tions in a new presidential administra
tion.
Felter hopes the election will bol
ster international support for the
Coalition Forces.
"[The election] is going to be an
opportunity to reassess the multilater
al solutions." he said.
Milani said the documents could
help develop better policies because
they draw attention to the many prob
lems in U.S.-Iran relations. Milani

expects that this relationship will be an
important issue for the new adminis
tration, and thinks that talking will
help solve the many problems
between the two nations.
"Regardless of what administration
comes in. I think it's very clear that the
policy we must pursue is directly nego
tiating with Iran." Milani said.
Milani also stressed that it is impor
tant to engage with Iran on a range of
issues, from nuclear power to human
rights. By ignoring many issues to
focus only on military problems, he
said the United States is not looking at
the entire picture.
Overall, Milani said that future
policies must be very different from
those of President George W. Bush,
who made it clear that the United
States will not rule out attacking Iran
militarily
However, beyond the issues raised
by Felter's documents. Milani held that
the report in general was heartening.
"The most interesting aspect of the
report is that here is a colonel of the
U.S. Army, and he has a very clear
understanding of what the underlying
problems are." Milani said.
