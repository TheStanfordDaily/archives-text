## Iran aids Iraqi insurgency 
### JULIA BROWNELL 
Colonel Joseph Felter. a national security fellow at the
Hoover Institution, has released 85 pages of information
documenting how Iranian military and Lebanese Hezbollah
forces train Iraqi Shiite militias to attack Coalition Forces in
Iraq.
line documents contain interviews of detained Shiite
Iraqi militants and were released as sources in Felter's
report."lranian Strategy in Iraq: Politics and 'Other Means'"
"i realized many of those detainees were talking about
the same experiences." Felter said about his motivation to
pursue the research.
While noting the limitations of information gathered in
interrogations. Felter said the documents support other
information proving Iran's involvement in Iraq's insurgency
movements.
"[The release] provides some context and some anecdot
al evidence." he said."lt was the human story."
Abbas Milani, I loover research fellow and director of the
Iranian Studies Program.agreed with the humanizing nature
of the evidence. I le felt it was obvious, however, that Iranian
forces have been training insurgent forces in Iraq for some
time.
"[The release] just provides some human details to some
thing I suspect anyone who has been following Iraq and Iran
already knew." Milani said. "I think the argument to be hon
est was. to me, a foregone conclusion."
Felter said that while deployed, he saw evidence of a
weakened Al-Qaeda. mostly as a result of the resistance of
the Iraqi people.
"There has been an awakening in the tribes that Al-
Qaeda in Iraq is not the future they want for their families,"
Felter said.
Still, the colonel did feel the influence of Iran.
