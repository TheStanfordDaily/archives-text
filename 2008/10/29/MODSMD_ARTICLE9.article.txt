Doubts about John McCain's
chances for the presidency grew louder
among fellow Republicans on Tuesday
as a White House race largely focused
on Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania en
tered its final week
Even two Republicans once on Mc-
Cain's short list for vice president
sounded skeptical. In a fundraising e
mail on behalf of Senate Minority
Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky,
Mitt Romney referred to "the very real
possibility of an Obama presidency." In
the Midwest. Gov. l im Pawlenty gave a
dour assessment of McCain's chances in
his state, saying Barack Obama "has a
pretty good advantage in Minnesota
right now."
Nationally, a poll by the Pew Re
search Center found Obama with a 16-
point lead among registered voters. The
survey said Obama had 52 percent and
McCain 36 percent, with independent
voters supporting the Democrat by a 48-
31 margin.
The Nielsen media company report
ed that both are focusing about three
fourths of their advertising in Florida,
Ohio and Pennsylvania. Obama, who
had been spending four times as much as
McCain on advertising, is now airing
only twice as many ads as his rival, the
ratings company said.
Those three states are battlegrounds,
offering a combined 68 electoral votes
on Election Day.
The concentration of firepower
comes even as Obama mounts a nation
al advertising campaign that will culmi
nate Wednesday evening with a 30-

minute, prime-time commercial on net
work television. The candidates also
planned appearances on cable TV talk
shows, including Obama on Comedy
Central's "The Daily Show."
ITie candidates kicked off their final
week of campaigning in the southeast
ern corner of Pennsylvania, which hasn't
supported a Republican presidential
candidate in 20 years and where Obama
is ahead in the polls. McCain is working
for an upset and has Pennsylvania as the
linchpin to his victory strategy.
"I'm not afraid of the fight. I'm ready
for it," McCain told noisy supporters at a
rally in this Republican region and
home of the world's largest chocolate
factory.
Obama's advisers say they are confi
dent of victory in the state. Still, they sent
him to rally supporters in Pittsburgh
Monday night and to the battleground
Philadelphia suburbs on Tuesday. About
9,000 people stood in the mud and a
steady, cold rain at Widener University
to hear him.
"I just want all of you to know that if
we see this kind of dedication on Elec
tion Day. there is no way that we're not
going to bring change to America," said
Obama. uncharacteristically attired in
jeans, sneakers and a raincoat. McCain
canceled a second event 50 miles away
in Ouakertown because of the dismal
weather.
McCain appeared with running mate
Sarah Palin, who planned to stay in the
state for rallies in Shippensburg and
State College. "Pennsylvania, it's going
to be a hard-fought contest here," she
said. "It's going to come down to the
wire here."
If McCain doesn't win the state's 21

electoral votes, it's hard to see how he
can win the presidency since Obama is
expected to pick up several of the states
that helped re-elect President Bush four
years ago. McCain needs one of the blue
states to make up for expected losses in
the red ones.
Both presidential candidates left
Pennsylvania for rallies Tuesday
evening in Republican strongholds that
have become battlegrounds — McCain
to North Carolina and Obama to Vir
ginia. McCain is increasingly playing de
fense in states that have been reliably

Republican.
Early voting in some swing states also
appeared to be in Obama's favor. In
North Carolina, for example, the
turnout for early voting has been nearly
a third higher than in 2004 and the num
ber of Democrats has been close to dou
ble that of Republicans. Democratic vot
ers in Florida have numbered about
1 ()().()()() more than Republicans,and De
mocrats hold an so far in Colorado.
