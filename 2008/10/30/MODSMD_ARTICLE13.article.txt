## Editorial Vote no on Prop. 4 
### 
As Stanford students, we should not feel
removed from the issues raised by
Proposition 4. Every one of us, even if
we personally felt comfortable talking to our
parents about sex, probably had a friend
growing up who would never have been able
to go to her parents if she wanted to have an
abortion. This Nov. 4, we urge you to think of
her.
Although increasing family communica
tion and decreasing abortions are both laud
able goals. Prop. 4 is not an effective tool for
achieving either of them. If passed. Prop. 4
would actually endanger the health and safe
ty of California's teenagers. The editorial
board encourages the Stanford community to
vote no on Prop. 4.
Prop. 4 would require that a parent or legal
guardian be notified in writing at least 48
hours before a minor could have an abortion.
The law has an exception for medical emer
gencies and also allows the minor to notify an
other adult family member if she reports
parental abuse. Finally, there is a judicial by
pass procedure where a minor can be exempt
from notification if she proves to a judge by
clear and convincing evidence that she is ma
ture enough to make the decision on her own
and that notification would not be in her best
interests.
Although there are numerous ideological
arguments on both sides of the Prop. 4 debate,
the editorial board finds the statistics on the
issue to be the most persuasive. A fact sheet
compiled by the Bixby Center for Global Re
productive Health at UC-San Francisco pro
vides objective measures showing that
parental notification laws such as Prop. 4 are
not sensible reproductive policy.
First of all. most teenage girls already com
municate with their parents about reproduc
tive health. In fact. 79 percent of California
women ages 14-17 reported that their parents
are aware of their sexual activities. Doctors
also already encourage teenagers to be open
with their parents about sexual health. Most
teenagers (61 percent) in states without
parental notification laws also involve their
parents in a decision about whether or not to
have an abortion, and the numbers were espe
cially high for girls who were 14 or 15 years old
(90 percent and 74 percent, respectively).
But for those minors who do not feel safe
informing their parents, the risks of Prop. 4 are
too great. Of those teenagers who chose not to

tell their parents of their decision to have an
abortion, over 30 percent stated that they
were afraid of physical harm or being kicked
out of their home. A parental notification law
would be a serious risk to the health and safe
ty of these young women. Although some of
the teenagers surveyed indicated that they
would use the judicial bypass option, more in
dicated that they would travel out of state to
obtain an abortion, and others even said that
they would travel out of the country. Some just
responded that they would "find a way around
the law." suggesting the possibility of an in
crease in "back-alley" abortions. Scared
young women from troubled families should
not be forced to resort to such drastic meas
ures to obtain reproductive care.
Prop. 4 will also endanger the health of all
minors seeking abortions, not just those who
do not feel comfortable notifying their par
ents. Parental notification laws in other states
have resulted in an increase in the number of
abortions sought during the second trimester
of pregnancy, which require a longer and
more risky procedure.
Furthermore. Prop. 4 would do little to in
crease meaningful family communication.
The text of the law provides no guidance or
counseling for helping a young woman ap
proach her parents â€” it simply requires noti
fying them of her intention to have an abor
tion and lets the teenager deal with the con
sequences. Some teenagers might also be
more comfortable going to a sister, aunt or
grandmother about their decision. If Prop. 4
passes, the help and advice of those family
members would not be enough unless the
teenager reported parental abuse, triggering
an investigation that is required by law
whenever abuse is reported. Ultimately,
Prop. 4 reduces the important goal of healthy
family communication to a mechanical ob
stacle to reproductive care that could actual
ly harm family relationships.
California's rates of teen pregnancy, birth
and abortion have all declined in the past
years thanks to comprehensive sex education
and affordable family planning options.Those
truly seeking to reduce abortions and protect
young women should focus their efforts on
these successful methods rather than detri
mental, divisive initiatives. Prop. 4 cannot
mandate healthy family communication and
instead endangers the health of teenage
women, and it should be rejected.
