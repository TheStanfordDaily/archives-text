JONNY DORSEY
ASSU President
On Nov. 4, California voters will decide
whether or not the civil institution of
marriage will continue to extend to
same-sex couples. If passed. Proposition 8
would "eliminate the right of same-sex couples
to marry in California." A video against Prop. 8
(produced by Stanford students, entitled "Pro
tect Marriage"), reminded me of my parents'
own struggle to marry as an interracial couple
in the South.
Upon hearing that my father (a white
man) was dating my mother (a black
woman), my father's father expressed worry
that he might be killed walking to work. As a
child. I can remember being hushed quiet
when my parents were on the phone with old
friends and family from the South because
my very existence would have further ostra
cized them from their former communities.
ITiroughout my parents' courtship, they were
told that any child of theirs would be unnatu
ral and socially maladjusted.
Because of strongly held beliefs over
which kinds of love are and are not valid or
appropriate, I have never met many of the
friends and family formerly involved in my
parents' lives. Growing up. I felt this absence
keenly. While I can remember the shame and
confusion I felt as a child.it was perhaps more
difficult listening to my parents struggle to ex
plain to my younger brother — who couldn't
yet comprehend bigotry and who appreciat
ed love without caveats or exceptions — why
certain family members wouldn't speak to
him on the phone.
But I've seen nothing but wisdom in my
parents. Their love for one another has led
them to appreciate the beauty in difference
and to discover what is common and funda
mental in those differences. My mother often
faces the question,"What's it like being mar
ried to a white person?" Her response never
changes:"lt's no different from being married
to anyone else." My father is not a "white per
son" — he's her husband. My mother hap

pens to be black, married to a man who hap
pens to be white. My parents are not defined
by their respective races, and neither is their
marriage. Race does not alter or taint the sa
cred promise they made to one another more
than 25 years ago.They've embraced the idea
that couples do not see one another as gay or
straight, black or white.
I do not think my family is evidence of the
degradation of the traditional family. Nor do I
think we detract in any way from the moral
fiber of American society. I feel that the
Supreme Court was right to overturn Pace v.
Alabama, the case outlawing interracial mar
riage. in 1 %7. But as we move closer to possi
bly electing our first African-American presi
dent. I am astonished that only forty years ago
the same kind of marriage that produced
Barack Obama was illegal in many places
across the United States.Today, we face a sim
ilar dilemma.
Opponents of gay marriage today use
many of the same arguments used against in
terracial marriage. California voters must de
cide, by voting no on Prop. 8, whether to con
tinue supporting same-sex marriage, whether
these arguments are as illegitimate now as
they were 40 years ago.
i do, however, believe that the sanctity
of religious marriage should be respected.
Religious institutions should move in their
own direction and at their own pace regard
ing gay marriage. But the religious concep
tion of marriage should not be legislated
into the civil conception. It is unthinkable
to me that a partner in a same-sex union
would have to find out about a partner's
death on the news. It is unthinkable to me
that a person in a loving, stable relationship
would not have the right to be notified if
something were to happen to his or her
other half. And it is unthinkable to me that,
in a week, Californians would not emerge
in huge numbers against any legislation to
that effect.
Upon marrying my mother, my father
made her an avowed, lifelong commitment.
Extending a lifelong commitment to her. re
gardless of social outrage and normative val
ues, was a right, fundamentally human and
universal.Today. I reject the premise that the
love between two men or two women is less
valid or less deserving of the legal affirmation
of marriage and the rights that come with it.
My vote will speak accordingly. I hope yours
will too.
