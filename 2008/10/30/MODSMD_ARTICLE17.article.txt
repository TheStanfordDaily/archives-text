# This Stanford Life
## Progressivism is in the air 
### 
America is in the midst of a new progres
sive Zeitgeist, and Stanford is on its cut
ting edge.
The Zeitgeist is not a full-boar, "Mother
Jones Magazine"-style progressivism clamor
ing to undermine America's current political
footing. It is. instead, a vague mood rising out
of our national Bush administration hangover
— a new opposition to past dogmas, but not a
dogma unto itself.
It is a pragmatic, positive strain of progres
sivism exemplified best by. of course. Barack
Obama — but also by Stanford graduate,
Newark Mayor Corey Booker and Stanford
Law Professor Lawrence Lessig.
This new progressive mood stands out for
its relative moderation; Obama, Booker and
Lessig all have openly post-partisan aspira
tions. Indeed,these leaders of thought have in
ternalized lessons — both positive and nega
tive — from conservatism's 30-year reign.
The new progressivism, for example, does
not haphazardly reject free market thought.
Booker, despite a life-long obsession with
public service, sees value in school choice, an
idea Milton Friedman first proposed in the
19505. Obama, writing in the "Audacity of
Hope," said that "Reagan's central insight —
the liberal welfare system had grown compla

cent and overly bureaucratic ... contained a
good deal of truth."
But Ohama also summarized the current
financial collapse in four words: "Deregula
tion caused this crisis."The same progressives
that admire some of the market's effective
ness also interpret this year's disaster as the in
evitable result of free market extremism.They
cannot wholeheartedly believe in the "magic
of the market," as Reagan once said.
ITiey instead fall somewhere in between.
ITie new progressives are not radical like the
1960s protestors.or Utopian likeThe Great So
ciety supporters, but deliberately pragmatic.
Obama, Booker and Lessig want to attack
long-standing American challenges — racial
divisions, urban decay and congressional graft
by working with past successes, both con
servative and liberal in origin.
Lessig's new "Change Congress" agenda is
a great example of this progressive shift. Leav

ing behind his earlier eelebrated work on
technology and legal issues, Lessig has set his
ambitious sights on Congress'structural flaws,
including earmarks and high incumbency
rates.
Even John McCain, who harps on the elim
ination of earmarks, is often working within
the progressive Zeitgeist. He has long been a
synthesis of conservatism and classic progres
sivism.and that is why he won the nomination.
A more conservative candidate could not
have won.
The ethos of private gain has been contin
ually engrained into the American psyche
over the past several decades, but figures like
Booker and Lessig are gradually subverting
these underlying values.
Arthur Schlesinger Jr. wrote that Ameri
can history pivots between cycles of public
good and private interest. 2(H)K seems to be
one of these pivotal years in these cycles, shift
ing from private gain to public good.
We are, in other words, living in the year
where Booker and Lessig's messages became
the new mainstream.

Hopefully Paul's message will also become tin
new mainstream. Email him at pcraft@stan
