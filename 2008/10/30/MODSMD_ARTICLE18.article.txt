## Valuing teacher education 
### 
Thursday night I attended a small dinner
with Stanford President John 1.. Hen
nessy at the Buttery House in Raines.
Graduate students posed questions to the
president throughout the meal.
I used my question to ask why Stanford,
which employs over 1 (K) education faculty
members, only trains 86 kindergarten
through 12th grade (K-12) teachers per year.
The president's answer shocked me. He
said (and I'm paraphrasing): Teacher educa
tion is something that should be left to state
schools ... We are a research university.
We've made a decision and teacher educa
tion is just not where our priorities are. You
can't have research and teacher education ..
. There is little interest or need to expand the
teacher education school.
It took me half the meal to regain my bal
ance.
Examined closely. President Hennessy's
remarks contain a particularly insidious mes
sage: that is, students preparing to become
classroom teachers do not require the educa
tional excellence Stanford provides.
Perhaps President Hennessy is not aware
that the research coming out of Stanford and
other universities suggests exactly the oppo
site. Study after study indicates that the best
way to improve a child's education is, guess
what? Not curriculum. Not sexy new initia
tives. It's not even the number of students in

a classroom. It is, rather, the quality and train
ing of teachers who interact with students
day after day, week after week and month
after month. At Thursday's dinner. President
Hennessy indicated that he would prefer to
leave the hulk of that training to third-tier
colleges.
Sadly, the president's poorly chosen com
ments also fuel an ugly hut widely held as
sumption that teaching is a second-class pro
fession. Many times during the meal, the
president spoke fondly of other professional
schools; he seemed especially receptive to
ideas about expanding the business school.
In light of his disparaging remarks about
teacher education, I translated this to mean:
"If you want to be entrepreneur, doctor or
lawyer, come to Stanford; if you want to be a
teacher, you might as well go to a California
State school."
Later in the meal, the president spoke
passionately about Stanford's commitment
to helping underprivileged students. 1 le cited
the University's decision to offer scholar
ships to undergraduate students whose fami
lies make less than $ I ()(),0(K) per year. While
ambitious, this program may assist a couple
hundred hard-working high-school gradu
ates each year.Contrast this with the fact that
educating just one additional K-12 teacher,
would, over the course of that teacher's ca
reer, bring the fruits of a Stanford education

to well over 2,(M)0 kids.
I walked away from dinner convinced that
President Hennessy fails to recognize a sim
ple truth: Teachers, not highly specialized ed
ucational scholars, are what make schools
work (and,in some instances,not work). Sta
nford. which is widely acknowledged to have
one of the best education schools in the coun
try, is in a unique position to train a large num
ber of teachers capable of positively impact
ing the lives of thousands of young people.
Considering the University's colossal and un
taxed endowment,such a project is also. I feel,
a moral necessity. As of today, there are al
most 10 times more Stanford students work
ing toward MBA degrees than there are stu
dents preparing to become classroom teach
ers. Something is wrong with this picture.
I challenge President Hennessy to step
out of Google and Cisco boardrooms and
take a trip to one of the many Bay Area
schools where 86 Stanford graduate students
are completing their student teaching. He
might be surprised to find that the work
going on there is every bit as important and
rigorous as the work being done in any other
Stanford graduate program. Teacher educa
tion is certainly not a task that should be left
to CSU schools.
