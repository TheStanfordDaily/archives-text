## NEEDING A SPARK Card looks for goals to break slump 
### WILL DOOLEY 
They say defense wins championships. What
they don't say is that you need a little offense too.
Stanford has been playing exceedingly well on
the defensive side of the ball all season, but has lit
tle to show for its prowess. Despite being the only
team in the Pacific-10 Conference to hold every
conference opponent to just two goals or less and
having the second-lowest goals-against average in
the conference — allowing, on average, just 1.04
goals per game — it currently has just a single con
ference win.
That win came against conference-leading
UCLA (7-4-5,5-1-1 Pac-10) and should be a source
of optimism as the Cardinal meets the Bruins again
when they head to Southern California for a tough
two-game conference road series this weekend.
Every conference game is crucial as Stanford (3-8-
2.1-3-1) will need to come close to winning out to
remain in contention for a conference title.
Friday afternoon, the Cardinal will visit San
Diego State (3-8-3. 1-3-3) in a match-up of teams
looking to breakout of their current slumps. The
Aztecs are winless in their last five, with two ties
and three losses — two of which came in overtime.
San Diego State's last win came against Stanford
on Oct. 10. when the Aztecs scored the decisive
goal in the 83rd minute to earn a 1-o,heartbreaking
victory over the Cardinal.
Stanford has just one win in its past nine games
and would like to jumpstart its offense against the
Aztecs, who have the worst goals-against average
in the Pac-10. While Stanford has only scored nine
goals in 13 games this season, the Cardinal offense
hasn't been lacking in chances. Stanford is averag
ing 12.2 shots per game, while its opponents are
doing just slightly better at 12.8 shots per game.
Whatever the outcome, the match is almost cer
tain to be a close contest. Both teams have suffered
a remarkable string of near misses on the year, with
each having recorded seven one-goal losses. If the
Cardinal suffers another one goal-loss, it w ill be the
team's highest total since 1988.
In contrast to San Diego's recent poor play,
UCLA (7-4-5. 5-1-1) is coming into Sunday's
match red-hot.The last match-up between the Car
dinal and the Bruins — a 2-1 Cardinal victory at
home on Oct. 12 — was Stanford's last win and
UCLA's last loss. Since then, the Bruins have been

literally perfect, vaulting into first place in the Pac
-10 with four consecutive shutout wins. UCLA can
secure the conference title by sweeping its two
home games this weekend against UC-Bcrkeley
and Stanford.
Stanford hasn't lost to UCLA since 2005 and is
unbeaten (3-0-3) in the past six meetings. But
UCLA will be hungry to break that streak, espe
cially if the win would secure its conference title.
Stanford, on the other hand, would love to play
spoiler for a variety of reasons. Aside from keeping
its streak against UC LA alive,a strong finish would
give Stanford a lot of momentum going into next
year, something especially needed because of the
number of seniors leaving.
But probably more importantly, a strong finish
would help the individual prospects of several
players. For players looking for an invite to Major
League Soccer's combine, more wins means more
scouts,especially against a UCLA team that is cur
rently ranked No. 22 in the nation by Soccer
America.
Both the coaches and the players feel that their
team is due for their run of good luck. Stanford has
been competitive in almost every game they've
played this year, and a string of late goals, bad
breaks and otherwise unlucky play has hampered a
team that has shown great chemistry and solid play
all season.
