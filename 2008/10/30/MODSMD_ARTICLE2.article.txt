# New Macs updated
## ResComp gives cluster computers dual-booting systems 
### LIZ STARK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Next week, Residential
Computing (ResComp) will begin
updating computers in the 78 resi
dence clusters to boot to both Mac
and Windows operating systems.
This update comes six weeks behind
schedule, according to Technology
Operations Manager for Student
Computing Surajit Bose.
"We had hoped that by the time
the school year began we would
have a working dual boot system,"
Bose said.
A team of three ResComp
employees — Bose, Dustin King
and Karl Kuehn — began develop
ing the dual-boot program in June
with the purchase of new. brushed
metal Apple iMacs.
These new iMacs replaced older
G5 Mac desktops predating Apple's
migration to an Intel processor,
which is required for a Mac to boot

a Windows OS.
"Up until this year, we would buy
a mixture of Apple and Dell hard
ware," Bose said. "We figured since
we were doing [the dual boot], we
would replace the Dells with Macs."
ResComp replaces every com
puter after three years, which is the
length of the warrantee offered by
manufacturers. This year, in order to
create uniformity and to accommo
date the migration to dual-booting.
ResComp replaced the Dell com
puters with new Macs in the clusters.
Because certain computers were
in use over the summer, new iMacs
have yet to be set up in Green
Library, the Lyman and Lantana
clusters and the first floor of Meyer
Library.
"We're certainly shifting toward
Apple hardware," Bose said,
"because Macs can run both Mac
and PC operating systems."
Though he could not disclose the
cost of the new iMacs because of the

University's contract with Apple,
Bose acknowledged that "it's more
expensive to go with Apple hard
ware."
Though Apple computers come
equipped with a program called
Boot Camp that enables users to
switch between Mac and Windows, it
requires users to log in and adjust
the system preferences to switch
between operating systems.
"We wanted students to be able
to pick a button [for operating sys
tem] without logging in." Bose said.
"That's slightly more secure,
because we don't typically give users
the ability to change [the comput
er's] settings using the control
panel." Because Boot Camp did
not meet ResComp's needs,
ResComp instead had to design its
own system that allows students to
choose between Mac and Windows
prior to logging in.

New iMac desktop computers run Windows for the first time after being fitted with a new dual-booting system that
allows for switching between Windows and Mac systems. ResComp installed the system six weeks later than planned.
