# New Macs updated
## ResComp gives cluster computers dual-booting systems 
### LIZ STARK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Next week, Residential
Computing (ResComp) will begin
updating computers in the 78 resi
dence clusters to boot to both Mac
and Windows operating systems.
This update comes six weeks behind
schedule, according to Technology
Operations Manager for Student
Computing Surajit Bose.
"We had hoped that by the time
the school year began we would
have a working dual boot system,"
Bose said.
A team of three ResComp
employees — Bose, Dustin King
and Karl Kuehn — began develop
ing the dual-boot program in June
with the purchase of new. brushed
metal Apple iMacs.
These new iMacs replaced older
G5 Mac desktops predating Apple's
migration to an Intel processor,
which is required for a Mac to boot

a Windows OS.
"Up until this year, we would buy
a mixture of Apple and Dell hard
ware," Bose said. "We figured since
we were doing [the dual boot], we
would replace the Dells with Macs."
ResComp replaces every com
puter after three years, which is the
length of the warrantee offered by
manufacturers. This year, in order to
create uniformity and to accommo
date the migration to dual-booting.
ResComp replaced the Dell com
puters with new Macs in the clusters.
Because certain computers were
in use over the summer, new iMacs
have yet to be set up in Green
Library, the Lyman and Lantana
clusters and the first floor of Meyer
Library.
"We're certainly shifting toward
Apple hardware," Bose said,
"because Macs can run both Mac
and PC operating systems."
Though he could not disclose the
cost of the new iMacs because of the

University's contract with Apple,
Bose acknowledged that "it's more
expensive to go with Apple hard
ware."
Though Apple computers come
equipped with a program called
Boot Camp that enables users to
switch between Mac and Windows, it
requires users to log in and adjust
the system preferences to switch
between operating systems.
"We wanted students to be able
to pick a button [for operating sys
tem] without logging in." Bose said.
"That's slightly more secure,
because we don't typically give users
the ability to change [the comput
er's] settings using the control
panel." Because Boot Camp did
not meet ResComp's needs,
ResComp instead had to design its
own system that allows students to
choose between Mac and Windows
prior to logging in.

New iMac desktop computers run Windows for the first time after being fitted with a new dual-booting system that
allows for switching between Windows and Mac systems. ResComp installed the system six weeks later than planned.
"You have to go deep into the
operating system to make those
technical changes," Bose said. "That
turned out to be more time-consum
ing than anticipated."
According to Bose, though the
desired dual-boot login system was
completed by September, ResComp
also had to develop a new image for
Apple's Leopard OS, which will
replace the previous Tiger image for
all the iMacs.
"We're now putting the final
touches on the Leopard image."

Bose said. "That's actually the hold
up right now."
Because the Leopard image is
still in development, all cluster
iMacs are currently running on the
new Windows image. Bose
described this setup and the inabili
ty of students to choose between
Mac and Windows as "far from
ideal."
A pilot program for the dual
boot system has been running on 24
new iMacs in Meyer for the last two
weeks as part of ResComp's final
preparation for migrating cluster
computers. These are the first com
puters for student use that are dual
boot capable.
Bose noted that, since the setup
of the program in Meyer. ResComp
has reduced the login delay.
The installation of the dual-boot
program will be handled wirelessly.
Bose reported that ResComp plans
to run the 2.5-hour maintenance
scripts on cluster computers around
3 a.m., when computers are rarely in
use.
The delay of the dual-boot sys
tem release seems to have had little
impact on students.
"Currently, we have both PCs
and Macs, which hasn't been a prob
lem," said BJ Beatty, residential

computer consultant (RCC) for
Lyman, which has yet to receive the
new iMacs.
"I think it's better that they get it
right," noted Jenny Wolochow '10,
RCC for Freshman-Sophomore
College, which has new iMacs.
"Only a couple of people who pre
fer to use [a Mac OS] are disap
pointed that they have to wait."
Wolochow looks forward to the
improvement she predicts the dual
boot system will entail.
"It's the right balance of giving
students a choice between PC or
Mac," she said, "but it makes our job
easier in terms of maintaining the
hardware."
Statistics from the in-room net
work registration connection system
during New Student Orientation
2008 suggest that, in general, incom
ing freshmen prefer Apple.
Of registered freshman comput
ers, 57 percent are Macs and 43 per
cent are PCs. Eighty-four percent of
students use laptops. Of all regis
tered student computers. 37 percent
are Macs and 62 percent are PCs,
and 77 percent of students use lap
tops.

RCC for Freshman-Sophomore
College, which has new iMacs.
"Only a couple of people who pre

"It's the right balance of giving
students a choice between PC or
Mac," she said, "but it makes our job

ing freshmen prefer Apple.
Of registered freshman comput
ers, 57 percent are Macs and 43 per
cent are PCs. Eighty-four percent of
students use laptops. Of all regis
tered student computers. 37 percent
