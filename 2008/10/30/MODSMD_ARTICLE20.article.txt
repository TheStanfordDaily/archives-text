## Men's water polo departs on road trip 
### 
The No. 2 Stanford men's water polo
team is facing the home stretch of its season
with the NCAA Championships just over a
month away. Stanford will host the finals
this year at Avery Aquatic Center, and the
Card would love to reach the Final Four in
front of its home fans.

Today, the Cardinal men (17-2. 3-0
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) will
head to UC-Davis to take on the Aggies (9-
11) in a 5 p.m. match.The Cardinal comes in
with plenty of momentum, having won
eight of nine games in the month of Octo
ber. with the squad's lone loss coming
against No. 1 Southern California back on
Oct. 12. In fact, both of Stanford's losses on
the season have come courtesy of the top
ranked Trojans.
"We're doing a great job as a team right
now." said senior captain Will Hindle-Katel.

"Everyone's coming together and everyone
has a good understanding of what we need
to do and how we're going to get there."
Saturday, the Stanford men will move on
to face UC-Irvine at Avery Aquatic Center
in a match starting at 11 a.m.The Anteaters
(9-8) are still looking for their first Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation victory on
the year. In both contests, as it has been all
year, the Cardinal's depth will play a crucial
role in helping the team to prepare.
"I love our team environment," said
Hindle-Katel about his last vcar on the

Farm."l also believe it's the best team envi
ronment there possibly is. Everyone is
working together toward a common goal,
and everyone is a part of that effort."
"We have the guys that you might not
see play as much in the game, but they're
playing against us at practice." he contin
ued. "And that's how you get better: playing
against each other at practice. If they're not
playing well at practice, we won't play as
well in a game."
