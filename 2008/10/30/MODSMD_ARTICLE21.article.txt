# Title in sight as women head to Los Angeles
## 
### NATE ADAMS 
The No. 5 Stanford women's soccer team
(16-0-1,6-0-0 Pacific-10 Conference) has a big
weekend in Southern California ahead, featur
ing games against USC and UCLA — both
conference foes with impressive top-10 national
rankings. A sweep would secure at least a tie for
the Pac-10 championship.

On Friday, the undefeated Cardinal will face
perhaps its biggest test of the season in the
match-up with the UCLA Bruins (14-0-2. 5-0
Pac-10), who are hot off a victory over cross
town rival USC, and could take a big step to
wards fulfilling their own Pac-10 title hopes with
a win.
The Bruins and the Cardinal have seen simi
lar success this year, but there are quite different

stories behind the Pac-lO'sonly two undefeated
records. IJC I .A features a style of play that is in
some ways opposite to Stanford's all-out offen
sive personality, scoring only 39 goals this season
(2.44 pei game) compared to Stanford's aston
ishing 56 (3.29 per game). So despite having jun
ior forward Kristina Larsen, named Pac-1()
Player of the Week for Oct. 21-27. UCLA's
chances of victory will depend most heavily on

its impressive defense.
UCLA has allowed a conference-best three
goals during the entire season, shutting out its
opponents in 13 of its 16 games. Goalkeeper
Ashley Thompson, a redshirt senior, boasts na
tion-leading numbers in goal-against average
(. 1%) an dsa ve perce nt age (.942). Wi thherhe I p.
the Bruins are still riding a 44-game winning
streak on their home turf.
If any Pac-1() team has the answer to the
NCAA's best goalie and the impressive defense
that supports her.it has to be Stanford.The ( ar
dinal has earned a reputation this season for
bringing a relentless and unpredictable attack to
every game, and with its incredible core of offen
sive freshman, it isn't difficult to see how that
came about.
Stanford is fresh off of two routs, over Ari
zona and Arizona State in a weekend in which
they took a whopping 65 shots and scored eight
goals. Freshman Lindsay Taylor, the confer
ence's leading scorer with 15 on the season,
notched seven of those shots and three of those
goals. Taylor leads an offense that features four
players in the Pac-l()'s top 10 in points per game.
With those numbers in mind, Stanford coach
Paul Ratcliffe isn't concerned by UCLA's de
fense. and he doesn't plan to make any big
changes when the team heads south.

strengths, put our team out in the best formation

for us and try to attack," Ratcliffe
said.
Ending a 44-game home winning
streak is never easy, hut the 2008 Car
dinal — hoping to clinch the Pac-10
title — will certainly pose the biggest
threat that the Bruins' streak has seen
in some time. Even if Stanford is suc
cessful, however, another victory
would he necessary to clinch at least a
share of the conference crown. The
first opportunity would come this
Sunday at USC (12-3-1,2-2-1 Pac-10).
Despite USC's had luck in the
transition to Pac-10 play this season,
the 2007 NCAA National Champion
Trojans will pose a significant threat.
They are among the conference's top
three teams — along with UCLA
and Stanford —in every offensive
category, and lead the Pac-10 in shots
with 358.
But beyond the team's strong
numbers on the season, USC has sev
eral comparative weaknesses to Stan
ford. While ranking second in goals
per game with 2.69, they are still sig
nificantly behind Stanford's 3.29.The
Trojans' top individual goal-scorer,
senior Amy Rodriguez, has less than
half the goals of Stanford's Taylor,
with seven.
Most importantly for the attack
oriented Cardinal, however, is the rel
ative weakness of USC's defense.The
Trojans have allowed an average of
.81 goals per game this season, doing
a wonderful job by almost any stan
dard and ranking third in the confer
ence. Stanford, however, allows less
than a quarter that amount (.19) and
should have a comparatively easier
time against Trojan goalkeeper
Kristin Olsen, who has a 0.77 goals
against average and 0.773 save per
centage — respectable numbers, but
not nearly so intimidating as UCLA's.
Both games should prove to be
among the season's most exciting, es
pecially with the possibility of Stan
ford returning to the Farm with a con
ference title.

They are among the conference's top
three teams — along with UCLA
and Stanford —in every offensive
category, and lead the Pac-10 in shots
with 358.
But beyond the team's strong
numbers on the season, USC has sev
eral comparative weaknesses to Stan
ford. While ranking second in goals
per game with 2.69, they are still sig
nificantly behind Stanford's 3.29.The
Trojans' top individual goal-scorer,
senior Amy Rodriguez, has less than
half the goals of Stanford's Taylor,
with seven.
Most importantly for the attack
oriented Cardinal, however, is the rel
ative weakness of USC's defense.The
Trojans have allowed an average of
.81 goals per game this season, doing
a wonderful job by almost any stan
dard and ranking third in the confer
ence. Stanford, however, allows less
than a quarter that amount (.19) and
should have a comparatively easier
time against Trojan goalkeeper
Kristin Olsen, who has a 0.77 goals
against average and 0.773 save per
centage — respectable numbers, but
not nearly so intimidating as UCLA's.
Both games should prove to be
among the season's most exciting, es
pecially with the possibility of Stan
ford returning to the Farm with a con
ference title.
