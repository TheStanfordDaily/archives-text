# An exciting end to the Fall Classic

What a World Series!
Congratulations to both the 2008
World Series Champion Philadel
phia Phillies and to the American
League Champion Tampa Bay Rays.
It certainly was unusual, hut what
happened last night had to be one of
the most exciting three innings of
baseball in the history of the game.
The only way they could have been
better is if it was Game 7.
Yes, MLB handled the weather
situation poorly — that game should
never have started. Anyone who
looked at the radar images of
Philadelphia before the game on
Monday night could see that the rain
was going to continue for hours. But
the league, understandably, wanted
to get the game in and went ahead
anyway. As a result, last night we got
to see something that had never hap
pened before in the World Series
and. hopefully, will never happen
again.
Baseball is not a game meant to
be decided in less than nine innings.
It can take players time, especially
after a full day off, to get into rhythm.
Each game has its own life and flow,
which can vary greatly as it progress
es. Any rain delay alters this How. but
a 40-plus-hour suspension complete
ly disrupts it. Asking the Phillies and
Rays to decide a World Series game
in just three innings — especially
after the first five and a half were
played in absurdly bad conditions —
simply isn't baseball.
That said, last night's mini-game
couldn't have been more entertain
ing.'lTie atmosphere and anticipation
made it feel almost like a one-game
playoff gone into some sort of sud
den death — not traditional base
ball, but exhilarating and nerve
wracking to the max. And. because
each team played competitively, the
fear that the suspension would be un
fair to one of them was not realized.
Seeing the Phillies "retake" the
lead after Geoff Jenkins' "lead-off"
double and Rocco Baldelli tie it with
a home run moments later was ab
solutely thrilling. Who could have
predicted it would be former San
Francisco Giant Pedro Feliz — hard
ly remembered for his clutch bat in
San Francisco — who would deliver
the game-winning RBI? And have
reborn Brad "Lights-Out" Lidge —
who has completely eclipsed K Rod
as the closer story of the year —
completing a perfect season by
recording a strikeout with the tying
run on second to win the World Se
ries in front of the hometown fans ..
. What more could you want?
It didn't even feel like just a Game
5. When Fernando Perez stole sec
ond with just one out in the ninth, it
felt a lot like a game seven, didn't it?
With all the anticipation after the
long suspension — and the fact the
game immediately delivered excite
ment and drama — it was easy to for
get Philly had a 3-1 series lead.
And, unless you were from
Philadelphia or Florida, it was im
possible to be overly disappointed in
the outcome. The Phillies — largely
ignored at the start of the playoffs —
are a feel-good story after winning
just their second championship in
125 years, and the perennially dismal
Rays came out of nowhere to prove
they were the best team in the Amer
ican League.
The Phillies gave their city a rare
title and proved that even the
losingest franchise in sports history
can win a championship. The Rays,
although they didn't make it all way,
proved a small-market team can be
come better than the Yankees and
the Red Sox. And the fans finally got
a World Series worth remembering
outside of the winning city.
Maybe baseball didn't make as
much money as it could have with
big-market teams in contention, but
this World Series couldn't have been
better for the game. No baseball fan.
once they get past where their team
finished,can argue that this wasn't a
fantastic way for the season to end
and a great postseason overall.
The only problem with the end of
the season? That it is four long
months until pitchers and catchers
