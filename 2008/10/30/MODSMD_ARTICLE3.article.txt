## Technology changes election landscape 
### CAROLINE CASELLI 
In 1960. Democratic presidential candidate John F.
Kennedy and Republican candidate Richard Nixon
squared off in the very first televised presidential
debates. Now. almost 50 years later, the dependence
on technology has thoroughly changed the terrain
of this national election.
The You Tube debates are but one of the many new
technologies being utilized in this 2008 election cycle.
From text-message updates from the candidates to mass
online fundraising. the Internet is proving to be a promi
nent feature of this election.
Popular social networking sites like Facebook and
MySpace — where both candidates have their own pages
— have become places where users can "friend" their can
didate of choice, join political groups and express their
own political opinions publicly.
Through the candidates' pages, social network users
can also view campaign updates, watch new advertise
ments and speeches, get information about where to reg
ister to vote, buy a T-shirt or even leave a personal com
ment for the candidates.
Perry Rosenstein '07, new media director for Obama for
America in Nevada, has found that social networking sites
can also be quite useful in terms of organizing supporters.
"We do certain types of things using Facebook," he
said. "We create events. We have groups for Northern
Nevada Students for Obama and Southern Nevada
Students for Obama. There's a Nevada for Obama page.
All of this is great for event and volunteer recruitment."
Although not a new phenomenon, political blogs have
also become highly prevalent in this election. Blogs, which
can range from informative to entertaining, allow anyone,
from New York Times writers to the girl down the hall, to
publish their political musings on the Internet for anyone
to access.
Although blogs can present a wealth of information.
Sean Meador '09 feels that they should not be confused
with news.
"It's easy for someone to go online, especially on blogs,
to perpetuate a bias toward one party," he said. "Blogs
usually express the opinions of only one person. Even if
bloggers pull information from multiple sources, they are
very selective about what they choose to post. I think that
this can be dangerous if read as news because it's very
one-sided."
Similarly, sound bytes and brief You Tube segments
have been wildly popular throughout this election. Videos
can be posted online almost instantaneously and seen by
millions. Anyone with access to the Internet, a resource
that continues to grow, can gain access to both visual and
audio representations of the candidates.
Stanford Political Science Professor Simon Jackman,
who teaches a Freshman Introductory Seminar on the
2(X)8 election as well as graduate school courses, has
observed a shift in the way that viewers receive the news
as a result of You Tube.
