## Technology changes election landscape 
### CAROLINE CASELLI 
In 1960. Democratic presidential candidate John F.
Kennedy and Republican candidate Richard Nixon
squared off in the very first televised presidential
debates. Now. almost 50 years later, the dependence
on technology has thoroughly changed the terrain
of this national election.
The You Tube debates are but one of the many new
technologies being utilized in this 2008 election cycle.
From text-message updates from the candidates to mass
online fundraising. the Internet is proving to be a promi
nent feature of this election.
Popular social networking sites like Facebook and
MySpace — where both candidates have their own pages
— have become places where users can "friend" their can
didate of choice, join political groups and express their
own political opinions publicly.
Through the candidates' pages, social network users
can also view campaign updates, watch new advertise
ments and speeches, get information about where to reg
ister to vote, buy a T-shirt or even leave a personal com
ment for the candidates.
Perry Rosenstein '07, new media director for Obama for
America in Nevada, has found that social networking sites
can also be quite useful in terms of organizing supporters.
"We do certain types of things using Facebook," he
said. "We create events. We have groups for Northern
Nevada Students for Obama and Southern Nevada
Students for Obama. There's a Nevada for Obama page.
All of this is great for event and volunteer recruitment."
Although not a new phenomenon, political blogs have
also become highly prevalent in this election. Blogs, which
can range from informative to entertaining, allow anyone,
from New York Times writers to the girl down the hall, to
publish their political musings on the Internet for anyone
to access.
Although blogs can present a wealth of information.
Sean Meador '09 feels that they should not be confused
with news.
"It's easy for someone to go online, especially on blogs,
to perpetuate a bias toward one party," he said. "Blogs
usually express the opinions of only one person. Even if
bloggers pull information from multiple sources, they are
very selective about what they choose to post. I think that
this can be dangerous if read as news because it's very
one-sided."
Similarly, sound bytes and brief You Tube segments
have been wildly popular throughout this election. Videos
can be posted online almost instantaneously and seen by
millions. Anyone with access to the Internet, a resource
that continues to grow, can gain access to both visual and
audio representations of the candidates.
Stanford Political Science Professor Simon Jackman,
who teaches a Freshman Introductory Seminar on the
2(X)8 election as well as graduate school courses, has
observed a shift in the way that viewers receive the news
as a result of You Tube.
"We're starting to see much more
delayed viewing, or secondhand
viewing" Jackman said. "People are
not watching the debates, or the Sat
urday Night Live skits or the Katie
Couric interview on television. I
would bet you that most people are
not watching these as they aired, but
rather through delayed viewing via
Tivo — or now. an even bigger medi
um. You Tube."
Twitter is yet another resource
used by activists. Twitter is a website
that allows users to pen brief mes
sages. something of a mini blog. and
send these messages to large groups
of users via cell phone, email, and
other outlets. They can update sub
scribers on virtually anything.
Not only are tech-savvy political
activists using Twitter amongst their
friends, but the candidates them
selves have also tapped into Twitter
as a resource. For example. Democra
tic nominee hopeful Sen. Hillary
Clinton (D-N.Y.) asked supporters
via Twitter to vote on the theme song
of her campaign. Sen. Barack Obama
(D-lll.) announced his vice presiden
tial pick using the application.
Many Stanford students subscribe
to these text-message updates. Claire
Woodard '12 frequently receives
messages to her Blackberry from
Obama's campaign.

"I think that the texts that Obama
sends are a really innovative system
for keeping people connected."
Woodard said. "And specifically. I
thought it was a really cool way for
him to tell everyone who his vice
presidential pick was. It felt very per
sonal."
Perhaps most importantly, the In
ternet has changed the way that the
campaigns can fundraise. Although
online fundraising is not new to the
2008 election, it has been taken to a
new level. Small donations made
over the Web have translated to huge
sums of money for the candidates,
particularly for Obama.
Jackman feels that the organiza
tion of the Obama campaign, and its
ability to both fundraise and maintain
this base of support, is spectacular.
"The single biggest thing that you
have to talk about is Obama's
fundraising." he said. "It's just had
such a profound effect on this elec
tion cycle. It has helped to reverse a
traditional fundraising advantage en
joyed by Republicans. You can partic
ipate in politics now by going on
Obama's website and giving him $50.
$ 1 (K). $200. and in turn you're now in
their database. They've pretty much
rewritten the playbook."
But it is uncertain whether all of
this technological change is good.

While there is undoubtedly an abun
dance of information and an in
creased ease at attaining it. is the pub
lic more informed? Or, are they
merely picking and choosing which
information is important, funny or
appealing?
Karl Ulig *09 thinks it may be a lit
tle of both.
"I feel like this election has been
really prone to little gaffs becoming
huge." he said. "Because there's a lot
more unimportant information.it de
tracts from one's view of the impor
tant issues. But at the same time. I
think that you can choose to pay at
tention or to not pay attention. You
have all this information at your fin
gertips."
And will this increase in new

forms of media — media that is
heavily absorbed by young peo
ple— translate to a stronger
vote from the notoriously ab- |
sent l<S-24-year-old voting |i
IJ

bloc.'
"What's the saying?
Young voters continu
ally disappoint."
Jack m a n laughed. fl|
"That beine said.

[Bill] Clinton was a
change election and
he did very well with
generating a boost
amongst the younger

voters. I suspect it's
there and we'll see it. But
it's one of the hig open
questions of this cycle."

Finally, amidst all
of these advances and
chanees. there are still

those who prefer receiving
\ their news the good, old-fash-
Sa ioned way.
"I still prefer reading the
newspaper because there's
something about getting the ink
on my fingers "Woodard said."lt's
a good way to keep in touch with
what's going on in the world, but
it's also just a tradition to sit
and read the newspaper in the
? morning. It's comforting. You
don't get that with the Inter
net."
