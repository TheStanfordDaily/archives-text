## Grad school drawing older crowd 
### DANIEL BUI 
The age gap between Stanford under
graduate and graduate students may
begin to widen even further, according
to a study showing a nationwide increase
in the number of older students attend
ing graduate school.
According to data from the National
Center for Education Statistics, the per
centage of American adults between 30
and 34 who were enrolled in school
nearly doubled from four percent to
seven percent between 1970 and 2008.
Furthermore, a report by The New York
Times noted a 38 percent growth for
graduate students over the age of 50
between 2001 and 2005, a figure more
than twice the growth of graduate stu
dents overall over the same period of
time.
Whether or not this national growth
has been reflected on the Stanford cam
pus appears debatable. Judith Haccou.

director of graduate admission, said that
her office could neither confirm nor
deny the trend.
"We do not track that kind of data,"
Haccou said. "Graduate admission is a
decentralized process."
Ken Hsu. associate dean and director
of the Graduate Life Office, added that
the graduate community has always
included a significant portion of older
students.
"We have not noticed any increase in
terms of our work of any older or non
traditional graduate students," Hsu said.
"We've always worked with a wide range
of ages within the graduate student pop
ulation. and we simply have not noticed
any changes from that."
While neither Haccou nor Hsu has
noticed any recent major jumps in the
proportion of older graduate students,
both agreed that graduate programs at
Stanford do include many students of
the older demographic. A few programs

— such as the four-year Master of
Liberal Arts (MLA) program — seem
to appeal largely to older adults who

have been long-finished with their

undergraduate education and

already involved in their own
careers.

"I was going to complete a
master's after my undergraduate pro
gram. but for various reasons I was not
able to do that," said Karen Ely, a fourth
year MLA master's student, who had
been out of school for 38 years.
With the help of a financial aid pack
age, Ely admitted that she would have
been "stupid not to" continue her educa
tion.
Prof. Paul Robinson has been work
ing with the MLA program since its
inception a few decades ago.
"A typical student, when they were
an undergrad. put most effort into get
ting a career," Robinson said. "If they
had to take liberal arts classes, they saw

EMILY VOGEL/The Stanford Daily
them as just hurdles before they could
get into business or some other career
path."
Robinson feels that a major reason
why adults return to school to pursue lib
eral arts degrees is recognition that they
have "missed out on something" they
could have hAd years ago.
He did older graduate students
share an apparent trait.
"They don't need to fake their enthu
siasm," Robinson said.
