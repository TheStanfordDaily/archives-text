## Kizer speaks on war and medicine 
### NIKHIL KAMAT STAFF WRITER 
Kenneth Kizer. former undersecre
tary of health at the Department of
Veteran's Affairs, spoke to a packed
audience at Clark Auditorium yester
day on the topic of "How War is
Changing Medicine." ITie presentation
featured a three-guest panel that dis
cussed in detail the ramifications of
the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan on
the U.S. healthcare system.
Kizer was joined by Assistant
Professor of Psychiatry Craig Rosen
and Professor of Orthopedic Surgery
Eugene Carragee. Kitzer opened with
a discussion of the contributions of
war and conflict to medicine. Starting
with the ancient Roman health figure
Galen — who contributed to early
studies of anatomy — he demonstrat
ed how modern military engagements
like WWII, the Korean War and
Vietnam have enhanced our under
standing of medicine through the
treatment of large numbers of casual
ties.
"The hyperbaric needle was a Civil
War invention," Kizer said. "Blood
transfusion . . . was developed and
pioneered during the Spanish
American War."
Kizer said the Iraq War has been
fundamentally different from both a
medical and a technological perspec
tive. According to Kizer. the unprece
dented survival rate of casualties in

the Iraq War is attributable to rapid
mobilization of battlefront medical
care. The survival rate, however, has
created unique challenges to health
policy as injured veterans return
home.
"The signature injury of this con
tlict is traumatic brain injury," Kizer
said. "What is the baseline, and how do
we manage these folks with often very
subjective and vacillating symptoms
that are impairing functioning is a
challenge when as many as 30 percent

of troops are thought to have traumat
ic brain injury."
Rosen highlighted that extended
tours of duty in urban combat are cre
ating new approaches in treating men
tal illness like Post Traumatic Stress
Disorder (PTSL)). He also said the
Iraq War has seen novel approaches to
tackling mental illness like new
screening procedures, a renewed pur
suit of investigating military sexual

trauma and changing how patients view
their illness.
Significant challenges remain, howev
er. especially in improving veterans'
quality of life.
"One huge area we have not
addressed very well is recovery in work
functioning and how to help people to be

economically self-sufficient," Rosen said.
"The jury is out whether this is going to
be a lifelong disability or whether you'll
be able to transition into work."
Carragee went on to demonstrate sta
tistical changes in the types of wartime
injury. According to Carragee, military
injuries now more closely resemble civil
ian disability injuries. The lingering
effects of the war can be found in sol
diers affected by diseases like muscu
loskeletal diseases, pain syndrome and
psychological stress. The numbers of such
cases have risen, especially as the war

transitions from offensive combat opera
tions to a counter-insurgency occupation.
Carragee suggested that military lead
ers ultimately need to change the way
they view the relationship between war
and psychological trauma.
"Exposure to combat is nearly always
a psychological trauma" he said. "Rut
people wring their hands at the begin
ning of every war and ask 'Will this be a
problem?"'
