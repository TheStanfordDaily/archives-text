College campuses are known for being
hotbeds of political activity, and Stan
ford is no exception.
For students interested in politics, activities
range from following the national debates to being
involved in debates right here on campus. Some stu
dents even take their political inclinations off cam
pus by volunteering for campaigns or attending
campaign events.
Holly Stebing'o9 and Grant Starrett i0 are two
examples of Stanford students who followed their
political candidates all the way to the national con
ventions in Denver and Minneapolis.
The Democratic National Convention: Holly
Miowak Stebing '09
With all of the hype surrounding presidential
candidate Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.), his cam
paign decided to do something special for this
year's Democratic National Convention (DNC).
They invited regular citizens to apply to be chosen
to go backstage and meet Obama before his speech
in Denver.
Of all the applicants. Holly Stebing '09 was one
of the 10 chosen by the campaign for this opportu
nity.
"I had consistently donated a little bit of money,
maybe five or 10 dollars each month,so I was on the
mailing list." Stebing said. "They sent an email say
ing there was an opportunity to meet Obama. so I
signed up. I filled out a short essay of things I'd like
to talk about with Sen. Obama."
Stebing. a native Alaskan, wrote an essay about
Alaskan and Native-American issues.
" I ended up getting a phone call," she said. "I was
called for a pre-interview. Basically, they asked me
questions like what were some things I wanted to
talk about with Obama."

Stebing talked with Obama headquarters in Illi
nois about oil drilling in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska and about the
Indian Health Services Budget.
"They called me back while I was at work, so I
checked my voicemails and it said I was selected,"
Stebing said. "Later, they followed up with details. I
got to bring a guest, and I brought my mom. They

paid for plane tickets and the hotel, and we got cre
dentials."
Stebing and her mother arrived in Denver on
Tuesday evening, spent Wednesday at the Pepsi
Center and Thursday at Invesco Field,participating
in the convention.
