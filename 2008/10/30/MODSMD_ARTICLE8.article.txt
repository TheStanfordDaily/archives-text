The Democratic National Convention: Holly
Miowak Stebing '09
With all of the hype surrounding presidential
candidate Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.), his cam
paign decided to do something special for this
year's Democratic National Convention (DNC).
They invited regular citizens to apply to be chosen
to go backstage and meet Obama before his speech
in Denver.
Of all the applicants. Holly Stebing '09 was one
of the 10 chosen by the campaign for this opportu
nity.
"I had consistently donated a little bit of money,
maybe five or 10 dollars each month,so I was on the
mailing list." Stebing said. "They sent an email say
ing there was an opportunity to meet Obama. so I
signed up. I filled out a short essay of things I'd like
to talk about with Sen. Obama."
Stebing. a native Alaskan, wrote an essay about
Alaskan and Native-American issues.
" I ended up getting a phone call," she said. "I was
called for a pre-interview. Basically, they asked me
questions like what were some things I wanted to
talk about with Obama."

Stebing talked with Obama headquarters in Illi
nois about oil drilling in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska and about the
Indian Health Services Budget.
"They called me back while I was at work, so I
checked my voicemails and it said I was selected,"
Stebing said. "Later, they followed up with details. I
got to bring a guest, and I brought my mom. They

paid for plane tickets and the hotel, and we got cre
dentials."
Stebing and her mother arrived in Denver on
Tuesday evening, spent Wednesday at the Pepsi
Center and Thursday at Invesco Field,participating
in the convention.

able to speak to Obama after winnina a contest.
"[The convention] was very
politically engaging, very active,"
Stebing said.
The night of Obama's big
speech, the selected 10 and their
guests were seated in the front two
rows.
"I met him about an hour before
his historic speech," Stebing said.
"We shook hands, and I was really
just amazed by the genuine look in
his eyes. He's very charismatic and
caring. I gave him a beaded craft
and a packet on racial segregation
in Alaska with some of my
research."
Stebing also got to see and meet
other famous political figures, such
as former President Jimmy Carter,
and she sat just a few seats away
from vice presidential candidate
Sen. Joe Biden (D-Del.).
"The convention was the most

politically engaging week of my
life," Stebing said. "I've actually
been volunteering for the Obama
campaign since then."
The Republican National
Convention: Grant Everett
Starrett *10
Grant Starrett iO, president of
the Stanford Conservative Society,
attended this year's Republican
National Convention (RNC) with
his father. An amateur convention
historian, he also attended the RNC
in 2004 and noted a few differences
between the two.
"This was a different experi
ence," Starrett said. "In the last con
vention, it was a chock-block-full
schedule. This year was a lot freer to
do what you would, and less focused
on events — [it was] more about
the TV audience."
Traditionally, the convention was
a critical part of the election process
and where the party's platform was
discussed.
"[Conventions] used to be the
place where things were decided,"

Starrett said. "What is the point of
the convention anymore — it's just
an infomercial. This year, the plat
form is more conservative than
[Sen. John] McCain (R-Ariz.)."
This year's convention had a dif
ferent ambiance, given the nature of
the candidate. Starrett himself was
originally a Romney supporter, but
he is now backing McCain.
"The crowd was desperate to get
something to cheer for. but it wasn't
often given," he said. "A lot of
McCain's message was that he was
not beholden to the party. His
speech did pick up extremely well
at the end. but he needs to talk
more about his biography — it's his
strongest trait."
Despite McCain's uneasy hold
over the conservative base, Starrett
said the convention atmosphere
was generally supportive.
"I wouldn't say it was a hotbed
of McCain support," Starrett said.
"But the people on the floor were
McCain delegates. At the end of his
speech, the crowd drowned every
thing out."

Starrett cited Wednesday night
— when former campaign con
tender Rudy Giuliani and vice pres
idential candidate and Alaska
Governor Sarah Palin spoke —as
the biggest night of the convention.
"Wednesday night, the crowd

was most excited," Starrett said.
"Giuliani was popular because he
was constantly berating Obama,
and Palin was a rock star."
Ultimately, Starrett felt that the
convention showed the strength of
the Republican Party.

"Every single person there was
active in the Republican Party,"
Starrett said. "We're a party that
gets together, we coalesce."

LEFT Stebing and her mother get the chance to meet presidential can
didate Barack Obama before his acceptance speech. Stebing was
able to speak to Obama after winnina a contest.
"[The convention] was very
politically engaging, very active,"
Stebing said.
The night of Obama's big
speech, the selected 10 and their
guests were seated in the front two
rows.
"I met him about an hour before
his historic speech," Stebing said.
"We shook hands, and I was really
just amazed by the genuine look in
his eyes. He's very charismatic and
caring. I gave him a beaded craft
and a packet on racial segregation
in Alaska with some of my
research."
Stebing also got to see and meet
other famous political figures, such
as former President Jimmy Carter,
and she sat just a few seats away
from vice presidential candidate
Sen. Joe Biden (D-Del.).
"The convention was the most

politically engaging week of my
life," Stebing said. "I've actually
been volunteering for the Obama
campaign since then."
The Republican National
Convention: Grant Everett
Starrett *10
Grant Starrett iO, president of
the Stanford Conservative Society,
attended this year's Republican
National Convention (RNC) with
his father. An amateur convention
historian, he also attended the RNC
in 2004 and noted a few differences
between the two.
"This was a different experi
ence," Starrett said. "In the last con
vention, it was a chock-block-full
schedule. This year was a lot freer to
do what you would, and less focused
on events — [it was] more about
the TV audience."
Traditionally, the convention was
a critical part of the election process
and where the party's platform was
discussed.
"[Conventions] used to be the
place where things were decided,"

Starrett said. "What is the point of
the convention anymore — it's just
an infomercial. This year, the plat
form is more conservative than
[Sen. John] McCain (R-Ariz.)."
This year's convention had a dif
ferent ambiance, given the nature of
the candidate. Starrett himself was
originally a Romney supporter, but
he is now backing McCain.
"The crowd was desperate to get
something to cheer for. but it wasn't
often given," he said. "A lot of
McCain's message was that he was
not beholden to the party. His
speech did pick up extremely well
at the end. but he needs to talk
more about his biography — it's his
strongest trait."
Despite McCain's uneasy hold
over the conservative base, Starrett
said the convention atmosphere
was generally supportive.
"I wouldn't say it was a hotbed
of McCain support," Starrett said.
"But the people on the floor were
McCain delegates. At the end of his
speech, the crowd drowned every
thing out."

Starrett cited Wednesday night
— when former campaign con
tender Rudy Giuliani and vice pres
idential candidate and Alaska
Governor Sarah Palin spoke —as
the biggest night of the convention.
"Wednesday night, the crowd

was most excited," Starrett said.
"Giuliani was popular because he
was constantly berating Obama,
and Palin was a rock star."
Ultimately, Starrett felt that the
convention showed the strength of
the Republican Party.

"Every single person there was
active in the Republican Party,"
Starrett said. "We're a party that
gets together, we coalesce."
