## Lawyer recounts suing terror supporters Darshan – Leitner speaks on terrorism, litigation 
### MELANIE REYNARD 
Everything costs money — including
terrorism.
Rather than combat terrorism with
weapons, Israel's leading activist attor
ney, Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, is "bank
rupting terrorism — one lawsuit at a
time."
Last night at the Stanford Law
School, Darshan-Leitner recounted her
lawsuits against banks that transfer funds
to terrorists. In an event sponsored by
Students for an Open Society.
International Law Society and the
Stanford Israel Alliance, a room full of
captivated students and members of the
community gathered to hear her stories
of judicial battles.
Darshan-Leitner stood behind the
podium and recounted a lawsuit against
the Arab Bank. She said that during the
Antifada. the Arab Bank funded "thou
sands of dollars in reward to help sui
cide bombers. Then they went home to
watch TV and watch the dead bodies get
loaded onto the ambulance in
Jerusalem."
Her firm was able to sue the Arab
Bank in New York under U.S. jurisdic
tion. and thev succeeded in Ireezina over

$450 million of assets in the United
States.
According to Darshan-Leitner.
through the international hanking sys
tem, several banks give money to Hamas
and the Palestinian Authority, either
because "they just don't care" or because
their leaders are — according to her —
anti-Semitic, like the Jordanian head of
Arab Bank.
She says that since her lawsuits have
"sent shock waves through the interna
tional banking system," terrorism has
been reduced by 60 percent.
A major factor in her work is her lack
of trust in European courts. And. she can
only sue and indict Arab officials when
she steps foot in U.S. territory. For exam
ple, after the Islamic Revolution in Iran.
12 Iranian Jews tried to escape to
Pakistan but disappeared. In 2002, they
were reportedly seen 10 floors under
ground in a dark cell.The only way to sue
the Iranian official was to catch him
while he was in the U.S.
A year and a half ago, Darshan-
Leitner's firm learned that former
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
was visiting the U.S. for a promotional
dinner. Her attorneys paid the $400 fee
to attend the ceremony and an addition
al $400 fee for a photo-op with the prime
minister. She said that as they stepped up
for the photograph, they handed the
prime minister the lawsuit papers — and
did not stay for the dinner.

Khatami has refused to answer the
complaint, and the case remains unre
solved. hut the action sends a message to
officials that "when they leave Tehran,
lawyers will be waiting to sue and indict
them for crimes against humanity."
"We're doing it because governments
cannot do what we do," she said. "They
have political interests, and they worry
about trade agreements and relations
with other governments. Private attor
neys represent one thing: their clients, the
private citizens."
According to Darshan-Leitner, the
Palestinian side has also filed similar law
suits against Israel based on cases from
the 1980s, and Israel has paid 300 million
shekels for "negligence." However,
Knesset legislation bars lawsuits during
the current Antifada, as it is no longer
considered a disunity of sticks and molo
tov cocktails, but rather guns and meth
ods of war.
Her firm not only represents Israeli
cases, hut has also worked to represent
Colombian citizens in a suit against the
Chiquita food label that was accused of
funding terrorist organizations in
Colombia.
Darshan-Leitner admitted to the
audience "we have a PR problem"
because her firm, the "little fish," may not
be as well known in the United States.
