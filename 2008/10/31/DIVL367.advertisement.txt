DEAR DR. PAUL,
mean A LOT. Not just about the issues, but about the
politicians themselves ... I can't explain it in too much
depth, but I think you catch my drift. Is this normal?
Dear Politics in the Pants,
Let me say, first and foremost, that having naughty thoughts about
anyone and anything is completely normal. Everyone has them, even if they
don't care to admit it. On that note, since this question has little true medical
relevance, I will attempt to reassure your insecurities by divulging a few of my
own thoughts on the issue. Although most everyone prefers to talk about Sarah
Palin's sexiness, I honestly spend most of my time thinking of our future first
ladies. Here's my sexy analysis of each candidate:
Michelle Obama: Pretty hot. To me, she looks uptight, bossy and diffi
cult to please in the sack. On the outset, her bossiness might seem sexy but fur
ther thought leads me to believe that she has lofty bedroom expectations that
would be difficult to fulfill — like trying to have sex with Madonna or Sting.
Cindy McCain: Really hot. I would do almost anything for
one night with her. She looks like a USC cheerleader
that loves to have lingerie parties. All I can think of ■
arc the animal noises, handcuffs and leather. I j
smile just thinking about it. Woof. / \
By the way just in case you're interested, I 1 1 1
Larry Flint and Hustler decided to make a porno I I ■ L
called "Nalin Palin." From the previews, it looks .JL. /
amazing, and to tell you the truth: I have already <

Got a burning question you can't ask anyone else?
