## Smith brings the vulgarity he's known for in "Porno" 
### 
Tack of personal motivation and money can be a power
ful thing. One gets creative in how to make a living.

1. Jwrhy struggle for a grade or some meager salary
when you could end up as a broke, foul-mouthed barista

who stars in a pornographic film with his blonde room
mate, two strippers and Jason Mewes — the actor who
plays Jay, one half of the drug-dealing Clerks duo Jay
and Silent Bob — for some quick and easy cash.
"Zack and Miri Make a Porno" is the newest release
from director Kevin Smith, writer and director of

"Clerks," "Dogma" and "Chasing Amy" — all films in
which he also plays the sometimes-silent Silent Bob.
Smith's movies are renown for their slew of four-letter

words and mainstay characters, a trend that he continues in
his latest film.
Zack and Miri, two roommates who have been friends
since they met in first grade, find themselves in the dark,
without running water or heat, when they fail to pay off their
rent and monthly utility bills. After an unfortunate stint at
their 10-year high school reunion — where Miri finds that
her old crush is actually homosexual and Zack receives a
handjob from a disgruntled wife — the two realize their lives
didn't exactly turn out as expected. Miri's no prettier, Zack
has only gotten fatter and their present life in squalor (com
plete with Miri having to wash her hair with toilet water) fur
ther scalds their enthusiasm.
While the average 27-year-old might doggedly trudge
back to their parents' house, Zack suggests they create a
pornographic film, the most powerful tool for launching use
less, short-lived Internet careers. With a couple-hundred-dol
lar investment of a fellow barista — whose title is "producer,"
but his only responsibility is to "cast" the right breasts — and
a short foray into a strip club, the two assemble a sloppy cast

consisting of an anal-loving,
implanted blonde; a woman

named "Bubbles" (after her interesting ability to blow bubbles
with a certain body part); and Mewes, who plays an egotisti
cal "riser" able to, well, rise in a span of 30 seconds.
But for films like this, it's never the plot that matters.
Much of the hilarity comes from Smith's ingenious knack for
writing dialogue; all 10 million swear words of it. It's easy to
identify with Zack and Miri, their disillusion with traditional
lifestyles, their cynicism and rampant sarcasm. The audience
will also find themselves recoiling in disgust at times, as
Smith never underestimates the shock value of a few unfortu
nate anal incidents: one camera operator tacitly explains the
dangers in filming such scenes from below when he says,
"Dude, she just frosted me like a chocolate cake!"
At times, the film struggles to emulate "Chasing Amy," a
masterpiece in Smith's repertoire that naturally weaved com
cdy and drama together; amazingly, it could leave someone
laughing at the screen one minute and rethinking their stan
dards about the opposite sex the next. But as soon as the

audicnce learns that Zack and Miri lived together for so many
years without having sex, it's simply too predictable to have
them get all doe-eyed and sappy with each other by the end.
Perhaps this is due to the fact that the audience never gets to
see the side of Zack and Miri that isn't about drinking or
having sex. Their characters are one-dimensional — so much
so that it feels awkward and uncomfortable to hear and watch
them express their feelings.
Luckily, the movie does not end with a scene of them
gazing into each other eyes, complete with lush violin music
a la Casablanca. Rather, Mewes' Urban Dictionary-worthy
definition and demonstration of a "Dutch rudder" single
handedly saves the film from drowning in melodrama. That,
and a little unabashed full frontal.
