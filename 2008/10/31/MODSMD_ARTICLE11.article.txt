# FiLM REVIEW
## Moments of disarming honesty carry "Confession" 
### 
Before the second Vatican council in the 19605, most
nuns weren't allowed to eat in front of laypeople. Clad
in their penguin-style habits, the nuns retreated to pri
vate dining rooms while Catholic schoolgirls speculated
about what exactly the mysterious sisters snacked on.
Watching the documentary "Immaculate Confession," a can
did portrait of ex-Catholic clergy who chose marriage over
celibacy, feels a lot like catching an old-timey nun eating; it
seems faintly illicit, but undeniably intriguing.
The film, which premiered at the United Nations Film
Festival on Oct. 26, focuses on three former priests and one
ex-nun, all of whom entered the clergy during that no-eat
ing-in-public time, which was followed by the slightly more
lovey-dovey Vatican II era, during which many nuns took off
their habits, and the Latin mass was replaced by the vernacu
lar. But despite the Vatican II reforms, clerical celibacy still
remained a requirement. Splicing Super 8 footage with pres
ent-day interviews, the documentary peers into its subjects'
emotional and spiritual lives, fleshing out messy, decades
long tensions between Catholic vocation and love.
The stories themselves are sufficiently interesting materi
al for an hour-long documentary, but "Immaculate
Confession" takes on the additional burden of a distinct anti
celibacy bias that manifests itself in earnest captions and a
let's-tug-at-those-heartstrings soundtrack. And although that
earnest "message" can prove distracting, the film fortunately
redeems itself by catching moments of disarming poignancy
and frankness; during one particularly tense interview, ex
priest Tom Durkin and his estranged daughter begin bicker
ing about money. The daughter starts rolling her eyes, the

two snap at each other and the fight escalates until the
daughter quietly asks the cameraman to stop filming. We
hear a muttered "OK" before the camera turns away and the
screen goes black.
It's those unnerving glimpses that give "Immaculate
Conception" its power. Admittedly, the movie was shot on a
low budget, the soundtrack occasionally becomes oddly loud
and the film quality isn't great, but the honesty that director
Simone Grudzen elicits from her subjects is impressive, and
it's certainly enough to keep the film interesting.
The intimacy that "Immaculate Conception" achieves is
perhaps due to the fact that both of Grudzen's parents appear
in the film. Cutting between archival footage, family photos
and interviews, Grudzen reconstructs the story of her par
ents' marriage. Marita and Jerry Grudzen met at the
Maryknoll Catholic Missionary Society in New York in 1967,
where they fell in love before Jerry was sent to Bolivia as a
missionary. While the two were separated, they exchanged
audio reels, portions of which are played during the film

(again, points for disarming honesty).
Marita and Jerry are still happily married, but

things were slightly rockier for Tom Durkin, a

fascinating, scruffy man who now lives in
Hawaii with his girlfriend. After leaving the 1
priesthood, Tom got married, moved to
San Francisco, indulged in free love and
became a sex therapist and later a goat
farmer. Durkin is, hands down, the most
fun ex-priest to watch; at one point, we see
him kneeling on the ground, shirtless, as he

violently slices open some fruit with an oversized axe.
Grudzen's other subject, Father John Dee, pushes the
film into its most interesting theological territory.
Throughout his marriage and after his wife's death, Dee con
tinued to wear the Roman collar and counsel Catholic
parishioners, although the Church still refuses to reinstate
him as a priest unless he renounces his marriage. With this in
mind, we watch Father John digging heavy snow around his
wife's grave. Again, a disarming moment.
These four stories — admittedly so different — are gen
erally well-paced and well-balanced, but it seems jarring
when a much larger anti-celibacy message is introduced, via
captions (although those captions did introduce the audience
to the intriguing rentapriest.com). The documentary's
strength lies in its depiction of four individual stories, and in
its investigation of how vocation continues to affect a life,
despite excommunication or marriage or divorce or goat

farming. And because Grudzen is
lucky enough to have found four peo-

pie with such compelling ties to faith
and love, "Immaculate Conception" is at its

best when it's quietly observing.
