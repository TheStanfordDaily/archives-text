# Rocky Horror? Bring your umbrellas
## 
### 
In the world of horror and slasher films, a
formula exists that should be familiar to
almost everyone: a group of people expe
riences debilitating car trouble and is forced
to ask the local crazies (e.g. psycho corn-wor
shipping children, disfigured survivors of
nuclear bomb experiments) for help. Chaos
ensues and more than a few people end up
dead. "Children of the Corn," "Texas
Chainsaw Massacre," "The Hills Have Eyes"
and "House of Wax" are just a few examples
of the tired plot.
In 1973, a production mocking this
cliche storyline, the Rocky Horror Show,
opened in a small English theater to wildly
impressed audiences. A young couple is
forced to journey to a castle and mingle with
its crazy inhabitants. Two years later, piggy
backing off of the success of the play, 20th
Century Fox released the "Rocky Horror
Picture Show" (RHPS) — a screen version of
the original stage musical. Over 20 years and
thousands of hopelessly devoted fans later,
the movie still plays in theaters around the
globe, promising a healthy dose of absurdity
to its many viewers.
Despite its mass appeal and popularity
the world over, RHPS is considered a cult
classic, — a film with only a very small fol
lowing. "Rocky Horror" probably achieved
cult status then because its main fan base is
more cult-like than Jim Jones' People's
Temple. Fans may not be drinking the Kool-

Aid yet, but that's only because

the criminologist (the

narrator of RHPS)
hasn't instructed

them to.
The

cult of
"Rocky

Horror" revolves
around spe-

cial gather
ings — mid
night show-

ings of the

musical. Believers flock to theaters at 12
a.m. to worship. Special tools are required
to perform the ritual properly: newspa
pers, umbrellas, etc. While fans watch,
they also participate in the action of the

story on-screen. When Brad Majors
(played by Barry Bostwick) and Janet

xI// / ' '
Weiss (Susan Sarandon) are stranded with

car trouble (sound familiar?) in the pouring
rain, experienced RHPS followers must cover

their own heads as if they, too,

are in the storm.

Also, like any
decent cult, music

is crucial. Truly
spiritual

worship is
best
L

achieved
through song. That
is why at these

gatherings
everyone sings
along, espe-

cially to such

favorites as the "Time Warp." The ceremo
nial song informs audiences that it's not
the "jump to the left" that is important;
rather, "it's the pelvic thrust that really
drives you insane." Insanity —

another cultish behavior.
The film's unique music

presents one theory as to why
so many worship at the feet of

"Rocky Horror." Catchy melodies and

fun lyrics will draw anybody in. Consider
another cult classic, Disney's "Newsies." The
film's storyline and acting leave a bit to be
desired — but it is hard not to sing along to
"King of New York" and "Seize the Day."
Likewise, "Rocky Horror Picture Show" con
tains many songs that call audiences to join
in with their melodic and lyrical goodness.
What really makes RHPS so successful,
though, is its journey into the absurd. The
so-called normal characters — Barry and
Janet — are forced into a situation of excit
ing human diversity, depravity and color.
While in traditional horror films audiences
would root for Barry and Janet, instead they
get enthralled by the madness of Dr. Frank
N. Furter, played by Tim Curry. Even if they
aren't Transvestites from Transexual,
Transylvania, people tend to relate to the
insanity of the Castle members rather than
the blandness of Barry and Janet.
The cult of the "Rocky Horror Picture
Show" has persisted. Participate in the magic
and absurdity at a FLiCKS special showing, 8
p.m. tonight in Cubberley Auditorium. Don't
forget your umbrella.
