# For the 19th time, The Simpsons' Treehouse of Horror
## 
### 
In what has become as much a Halloween tradition as
pumpkin carving and trick-or-treating, "The Simpsons"
will be airing their annual installment of the "Treehouse
of Horror," an off-beat series of vignettes centered on an All
Hallows-esque theme.
In its 19th rendition, this year's "Treehouse of Horror"
opens with a short intro sequence as Homer tries to cast his
ballot for the 2008 presidential election, with comically dead
ly results.
The classic "Horror" structure remains intact, featuring
three short and completely unrelated mini-episodes. The
ironically titled "Untitled Robot Parody" follows Bart as he
Christmas shops for his sister Lisa. Unknowingly buying a
devious Malibu Stacy convertible, Bart introduces an army of
transforming appliances that do battle in Springfield.
This particular mini-episode is fairly weak and unorigi
nal. It's a rough start to the episode, but fortunately for Fox
— and you, the viewing public — the other episodes are sub
stantially better.
The next, fast-paced fright-fest is titled "How to Get
Ahead in Dead-Vertising." The episode focuses on Homer's
uncanny new talent for murdering celebrities so that their
images can be used for royalty-free advertising. As Homer
continues to knock off celebrities, his victims begin to muster
a revolt in celebrity heaven. This episode is a huge improve
ment over the first, from its stylish and wonderfully executed
introduction sequence, to its cavalcade of celebrity spoofs
and conclusion.

The final
scare comes in
the form of an
episode titled,
"It's the Grand
Pumpkin,
Milhouse."
Showing a very
direct influence
of the Charlie
Brown holiday
classics in its
animation, the

story centers on Milhouse's supposedly unfounded belief in
The Grand Pumpkin, a being that appears only to true
Halloween believers. When Milhouse's fantasy comes to life
and seeks revenge for the pumpkin atrocities committed
throughout Springfield, it's up to Milhouse's imagination to
right the wrong.
This last episode is definitely the best of the three. The
direct Halloween theme, the writing and the superb anima
tion really pull this one together to deliver the most enjoyable
episode to close the 19th "Treehouse of Horror."
The episode will air this Sunday, Nov. 2 at 8 p.m. on Fox.
