# Roxy encourages duos to really dress up (before dressing down) this Halloween
## 
### 
Secretary and CEO, cop and prisoner, doctor and
nurse... yawn ... Where's the originality? On
Halloween, couples can take role play to a whole
new level, so why waste the opportunity on the same
old, boring costumes? Depending on how you spend
your spooky day (and how you'll be divvying up your
candy in the heat of the night) show your collective
creativity as a unique and sexier pair. Roxy has con
jured up a few ideas of her own to give you a head start
on your collaborative costuming.
Lolita and Humbert:
If you want to attempt something really scary, try
the pedophilic relationship between 12-year-old
Dolores Hayes (a.k.a. Lolita) and disturbed scholar
Humbert Humbert. Lolita costumes can include any
thing from little school-girl outfits to jumpers or '50s
style dresses, coy "nymphet" expressions, pigtails or
high ponytails and optional little-girl accessories, like
lollipops or jump ropes. Humberts should don tradi
tional professorial garb, complete with spectacles and
pervy-old-man demeanor. Shifty paranoid eyes are also
a plus. Real sickos can freak out onlookers by
canoodling in public places or diving suspiciously into

dark corners.
Princess Leia and ]abba the Hutt:
Take bondage beyond the bedroom as the
scantily clad Princess Leia chained to the giant,
grotesque slug-like monster from that famous
scene in "Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the
Jedi" (before Princess Leia strangles Jabba to
death with her slave shackles — woo!). When

else can you keep your lover forcibly by your side

at all times without being arrested? The female cos
tume may be slightly more flattering, but how delight
ful to be green, fat and wrinkly for a night, knowing

that it won't deter your princess from royally ravaging
you later on!
Popeye and Olive Oyl:
Ever re-visited Popeye episodes from childhood?
Popeye was a badass, and Olive Oyl actually had some
pretty sweet outfits (little black skirt, brown campus
boots, red sweater with ruffled collar ... OMG, Olive
was a hipster!). Men, don't tell me you haven't secretly
yearned to don that sailor outfit, complete with corn
cob pipe, canned spinach and inflatable muscles. Real
muscles may be required, however, as Popeye spends a
lot of time sweeping Olive Oyl off her dainty feet.
Mary Poppins and Bert the chimney sweep:
Dirty chimney sweep/street artist with cockney
brogue? Sexy, no-nonsense nanny with magical pow
ers? There is no doubt in my mind that when all of the
chalk-painting field-trips ended and the children were
in bed, Mary Poppins and Bert made amazing, sooty
musical love together. A spoonful of Mary's sugar
undoubtedly helped Bert's medicine go down. And
what do you think was really in that carpet bag? Berts
can dirty themselves up with artist's charcoal or face
paint and don a newsboy cap, trousers and suspenders

over a white tank top. And don't forget
the brush! Mary Foppinses can

explore variations on the big petti
coated skirt, Victorian high-col
lared blouse and long black coat.
The flower-adorned hat, bottom
' less bag and umbrella, however,
are crucial accessories.
