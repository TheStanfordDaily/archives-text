# The 						Spoken Word Collective opens up its mic
## 
### 
Stanford Spoken Word Collective is trying
something new this year: they want to
democratize poetry.
After seeing so many talented poets dur
ing their fall auditions, the Spoken Word
Collective decided to expand its group to not
just include its members, but a larger poetic
community.
"I was overwhelmed by what I heard at
auditions," said Brian Yoo '11, a member of
the Spoken Word Collective. "We didn't want
to discourage the people we couldn't accept
from writing. I want to learn from these peo
ple. Basically, everyone is part of the collective
as far as I'm concerned."
So starting this Saturday, from 8 to 9
p.m., Spoken Word Collective will be hosting
a monthly open mic night at the CoHo called

Stanford Unplugged.
"This night is for
other students who want
to get up and rant or
profess, or say whatever
they want to say," said
Lyla Johnston '11,
another Spoken Word
Collective member. "It's
completely uncensored.
It's an open mic, do
whatever you want."
While members of
the group may get up
and perform their pieces

during down time, they intend to leave the
mic mostly open for other students.
"We want to create a spoken word com
munity outside of the collective," Johnston
said. "I'd love to build a community where
that'd be our thing. We want to teach, but we
also want to learn."
M. Scott Frank '10, another member of
the collective, feels that Stanford students have
a lot to gain from this community.
"This is not based on elitism, not exclu
sive," Frank said. "It's about facilitation. We
want to change the access people have to
being heard. Everyone's words are regarded on
the same level."
The collective will also continue to offer
spoken word workshops every Thursday, from
7:30 p.m. to 9:30 p.m. in the basement of

environment for
people to speak.
Expectations get
in the way."
"We're not

Margaret Jacks Hall; they will also hold work
shops in dorms throughout the year.
Spoken word is a type of dramatic poetry
that involves not just reading the words, but
conveying and portraying the emotion of
them simultaneously.
"It is like performance poetry," Yoo said.
"A lot of it is dramatic, but it doesn't have to
be. But you do have spatial control, you can
move, go into the audience, etc. I like it
because there are no real rules."
"There's a certain power that comes with
spoken word," Johnston added. "It sort of
speaks for itself; it's magical as an art form.
People walk away transformed."
In fact, spoken word may be closer to the
original nature of poetry than the printed
poems of modernity.
"Poetry is meant to be spoken out loud,"
Yoo said. "'The Iliad' was a spoken word,
Homer was a spoken word poet. We're trying
to bring that element back to poetry."
Frank really sees spoken word as offering
Stanford students a chance to be heard.
"Stanford students are reticent," Frank
said. "They are afraid to express themselves,
afraid to be heard. We know everybody has a
voice, but we haven't created a comfortable

the
only per-

formers," Johnston
added. "We're not
the only ones who
want to say shit."

And so the col
lective is working
together to try to cre
ate an open commu-

nity of poetry and
voice on campus,

and working to
facilitate other
students and
their ability to
speak.

"It's about
having confidence

in voice," Frank said.
"This community is an

outlet through which the
collective power of stu-

dents can be heard."
