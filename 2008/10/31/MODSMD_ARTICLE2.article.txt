# Sewing whiz Cathy Ye takes on yet another Halloween getup
## 
### 
CCt spend all my money on yarn and
I fabric," she gushed. "It's terrible.
.A. Yarn and fabric and shoes."
Such are the financial woes of Cathy Ye
'09, self-taught seamstress and hand-maker
of sundry apparel since freshman year, when
she saw a simple possession of a residential
advisor (RA).
"I saw the sewing machine," Ye said
nonchalantly. "I decided 1 needed a cloak."
The result was the unexpected birth of
her first real sewing project: a black cloak
with cow-print inside. She had no prior
experience in the craft, except for a seventh
grade home economics class.
Three years, three destroyed sewing
machines and no formal training classes
later, Ye has expanded her resume of useful
creations. The list includes a ragged-edged
dress made of dark red silk and sheer black
fabric for her younger sister, numerous T
shirt dresses, a little black number for this
year's Full Moon on the Quad and even cur
tains for friends.
Despite her love for sewing, Ye doesn't
see herself vying for a spot on Project
Runway.
"1 don't want to put that pressure on
myself," she said, quickly denying a career in
fashion.
Ye is currently fixated on the newest
addition to her closet: a full-length blue win-

ter coat with a bright blue silk lining that ties
around the waist. Alas, after an estimated 80
to 90 hours of labor over several months, the
piece is still missing "the perfect buttons."
This kind of commitment is what has
Ye's parents "mildly surprised" her hobby
proved to be more than just another phase.
Ye instead channels her spontaneity into the
creation of single-use party costumes.
Ye's past event apparel has ranged from
the classic Halloween princess to a penguin
on vacation to a 1900s-style gown of an
imaginary wife of the richest man in Britain
for a murder mystery night.
After deliberating over which was her
favorite concoction, Ye decided on an elabo
rate 14th-century period dress she made her
sophomore year. She unveiled her creation at
a special dinner at Phi Sig; a medieval harlot
frock with a skirt that pulled up like window
blinds for an extra exhibition of legginess.
High fashion is "not something I want
to emulate," Ye noted on the source of her
costume ideas. "I get really bored in class. I
start doodling."
This year, lack of time has been the
main hindrance to Ye's sewing. Ye considers
her sophomore year her prime, when she
would set up her "Phi Sig sweatshop" at the
end of her hall every Friday afternoon to
make something new.
There is no end to the costume cre
ations, however. Tonight, while most girls
will be stalking Stanford as a Sexy Soccer
Referee or Sultry Sixties Chick, Ye will as
usual be posing as the unusual. Make sure to
keep a look out for Ye as she breaks out yet
another costume of high creative heights,
appearing with her roommate as the infa
mous Alice in Wonderland characters
Tweedledee and Tweedledum.
