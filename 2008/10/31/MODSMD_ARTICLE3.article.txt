# It comes once every four years: All-Hallows-Evening of Elections Results Coverage
## 
### 
This is a spooky time of year. The sun starts to go away.
The nights get colder. "Saw V" continues to make mil
linns of dollars in theaters. And there are ghosts like,
all over the goddamn place. Truly, the spirit world is drawing
closer. The thin veil separating our dimensions is getting
thinner and less veiling every day. The lines between reality
and fantasy arc blurring into a fog of magic and mystery. A
lot of crazy A & 4 % is going on.
But believe me, I'm not the first person to point this out.
Many cultures across the globe have noted this recurrent phe
nomenon, and all of them believe that the mystical distur
bances and cosmic crossovers culminate on a single evening
— that one night, when all the craziness comes to a head and
explodes out in a festival of epic proportions. I am talking, of
course, about Election Night.
The night of the United States Presidential election
results coverage is renowned as the most magically potent
time of the year. Demons, fairies, Elvis Presley and a ton of
girls in fishnets run rampant through the streets eating candy
and staying up past their bedtimes. Everyone is excited and

nervous. The air feels electric. (That's because there is magic
in the air, and magic feels like electricity. Try sucking on a 9V
battery. It's like a magical cough drop.)
But not everyone thinks magic is as fun as I do. Some
people get very scared on Election Night. They watch their
TVs, paying rapt attention to the goings on across the coun
try. Are we finally going to overdo it? Are things going to get
out of hand? For some, all the ghoulish revelry of Election
Night might very well signal the beginnings of the apoca
lypse. These people typically stay indoors during Election
Night, eating decidedly less candy and wearing far fewer fish
net stockings than the people out there "feeling the magic."
They also probably go to bed at a reasonable hour. That is,
unless they catch a late-night episode of Matlock.
It is true, though, that people are getting pretty worked
up about this election. It really is a magical moment in
American history. Almost everyone seems to have an opinion
this time. Everyone's dressing up and coming out to partici
pate. It's going to be an awesome party. But on the flipside, a
little too much partying and people can start to get belliger

ent. I'm worried that no matter who wins, the victor will have
to face either a lynch mob or the kind of mob that hangs
people they don't like, but does so without the connotation of
racism. Either way, 1 would be wary of anyone dressed up like
a European blacksmith, farmer or village idiot, particularly if
they are carrying a torch or a pitchfork. You should probably
avoid that kind of person as a general rule, even if it's not
Election Night. They have probably time-traveled here and
are almost certainly carrying the plague.
I guess my point is that I'm excited to see how this turns
out. I'm also excited to just move past this whole All-
Hallows-Eve thing so that all these ghosts and goblins and
girls in fishnet stockings will leave me the heck alone. They
keep waking me up with all their moaning. And I think
they're stealing my socks. Oh wait, I'm sorry, did I say All-
Hallows-Eve? I meant All-Hallows-Evening of Election
Results Coverage. Easy mistake.
