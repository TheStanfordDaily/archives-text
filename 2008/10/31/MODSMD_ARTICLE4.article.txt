# Turtle Island Quartet defies theories of physics
## 
### 
Despite what the Stanford physics
department may preach, Mark
Summer, cellist of the Turtle Island
Quartet, would like you to know that string
theory is not "that boring old science with
black holes."
Summer described a much more literal
version of string theory to a Lively Arts audi
ence last Wednesday: the idea that musicians
can use their stringed instruments as limitless
tools, without tying themselves to traditional
styles or methods of playing. And such is the
mantra of the Turtle Island Quartet, an inno
vative group that attempts to transcend the
traditional string quartet experience.
Summer's definition was the beginning of
the evening's collaboration between the
Turtle Island Quartet and the Assad Duo, a
brace of Brazilian guitar-playing brothers.
Though the Quartet and the Duo each played
a set alone, the greatest music of the evening
came from their collaborations. The flamenco
esque guitar music alternately underscored
and lightened the more traditional quartet,
using a fluid combination of styles to create an
entirely unique score for the evening.
The Assad brothers' lifelong collaboration
is reflected in their uncannily well-blended
music. The two brothers, Sergio and Odair

Assad, have been innovators in creating music
for two guitars, a union that is easily discount
ed and undervalued. The Duo's first tune in
their solo set was nimble and gently played.
With their cascading notes in tandem, the
music became at moments almost harplike.
Their second song was more raucous and
rhythmically powerful, but their harmonies
remained perfectly synced. When playing with
the Turtle Island Quartet, the sheer force of
the bowed instruments occasionally over
whelmed the guitars, but the Quartet fre
quently slowed or quieted its instruments to
allow the demure elegance of the guitars to
shine through.
Although a standard string quartet might
seem tame in comparison to the collabora
tion of the brothers, to call the Turtle Island
Quartet traditional does them a great disserv
ice. Although the group is composed of the
technically correct instruments — violin, vio
lin, viola, cello — their presentation strays far
from traditional quartet music and form. They
opened the evening without the Assad Duo,
playing a jazzy, upbeat interpretation of a John
Coltrane tune from "A Love Supreme," their
CD celebrating Coltrane's work that snagged
the Quartet a Grammy last year. In their sec-


I 11
ond selection, "Song to John," the audience audibly
laughed as the theme to "Mario Brothers" briefly sur
faced in the middle of the song. None of the music
throughout the evening bore any resemblance to classi
cal string quartet repertoire.
The true innovation of the evening, however, was
in how the musicians played their instruments. The
viola and violins occasionally put down their bows to
pluck their instruments like mandolins; the cellist fasci
natingly played his instrument like a bass, plucking the
strings in a bass line. No part of the instrument was off

limits, and every sound they could create from their
instruments was music. This is string theory as
Summer would have it: the ability of musicians to act
on every possibility that their instrument offers, rather
than allowing fusty tradition and structure to dictate
the limits of musical innovation.
