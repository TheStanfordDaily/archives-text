# Freaky fashion creeps its way through campus
## 
### 
After three years on campus, I've real
ized that Halloween — a commer
cialized holiday of ghosts and goblins
— is nothing compared to the horrors of
everyday life. While Oct. 31 is just one deli
cious day of sluts and candy, every day at
Stanford is a fashion frightfest. In the past

week alone, I have had a series of horrifying
encounters with hideous faux-pas monsters.
Such creatures mostly lurk in the Terman
vicinity, but can pop up at any place or time
if you're shrewd enough to spot them. My
objective: to hunt them down. The following
log documents my chilling journey.

ENCOUNTER #1: 12:53 p.m. Location: Tresidder.

I'm having a hard enough time as it is, stomaching TresEx
"sushi," when 1 spot one of Stanford's most common, yet most
perplexing fashion gremlins: Uni-toes. Uni-toes emerge when a
confused soul can't decide if he's hot or cold, so he mediates
the situation by wearing socks with sandals, creating the illu
sion of one big toe. This particular breed — white socks and
hiking sandals — seemed harmless, but is totally gross
nonetheless. The next day I spotted another Uni-toe outside
Olives, in the form of lime green socks embroidered with pink
flamingoes, peeking out of tattered Birkenstocks. It was kinda

cute, but then again, so is a sewer rat.

ENCOUNTER #2: 3:30 p.m. Location: History Corner.
I'm rubbing my eyes after a grueling two-hour lecture.
Suddenly, sitting nonchalandy on the steps in front of me, was the
infamous and all-too-common crack monster, gaping as it oozed
out of ill-fitting jeans. Although crack monsters have been multi
plying like the plague ever since Britney became a "Slave 4 U," I'm
told that a sturdy belt keeps them away. And here's a tip, if you're
feeling breezy out back, you've probably got a crack monster on
your case, flashing your business to the world. If this happens to
you, pull up your damn pants.

ENCOUNTER #3: 11 a.m. Location: Terman Cafe.
I'm strolling to class, minding my own business when all of a
sudden the friendly, but sneaky Knee-Down monster comes bounding
out of Terman. Knee-down monsters destroy outfits from the knee
down, and most commonly occur when dresses or skirts are tragically
paired with tube socks and sneakers (or other "functional" walking
Shoes). One can avoid knee-down dilemmas buy simply buying com
■ortable flats.

ENCOUNTER #4: 2:14 p.m. Location: Terman Cafe
1 found myself chasing this monster up Terman stairs wielding my camera and desperately
trying to document the sighting. I've heard of these before, but never in my wildest dreams did 1

imagine that I would see one in the flesh on my very own campus
(as they are mostly found in Europe). Now I can tell my grandkid
dies that in my very own engineering building, I tracked the most
elusive West Coast fashion faux pas: the denim manpri.
Undoubtedly, all boys have worn jean pants, fewer have worn
jean shorts (jorts) and fewer still have worn the paradoxical nei
ther pants nor shorts combination: the jean capri. Worn on
women, jean capris can be cute and figure friendly. The manpri
however has no redeeming characteristics, and if stared at loag - 112
enough will cause the observer confusion, humor and ultimately, I
rage. If you see the manpri roaming around, ask yourself, "Why?" |

and then just move along.
Inevitably, you'll see some pretty outrageous costumes this Halloween. But when the festivities
cease, the blatant caricatures end up on frat floors or back in storage. Every day, however,
there are creatures among us, subtly invading our busy lives. They feed off our indifference,
and will continue to thrive as long as Stanford kids are too smart to care.
