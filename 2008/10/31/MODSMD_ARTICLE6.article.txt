# Campaign style: an issue in itself
## 
### 
There are still a few undecided voters in
our nation — potential voters that
have watched the debates, analyzed the
issues and weighed the arguments, only to
find themselves approaching Nov. 4 like deer
in headlights. It's easy to be overwhelmed by
claims around abstract concerns like "experi
ence" and "judgment." Complicating these
ambiguous terms even more is the issue of
how we "view" our candidates — which
brings us to a theme that has been ever-pres
ent in the 2008 race: campaign style.
Campaign style is tricky. I might even go
so far as to say that if a candidate can master
the art of election fashion, he or she can defi
nitely handle the economic crisis. Candidates
and their spouses have to look smart yet
relatable, professional but approachable and
fashionable without looking trendy. No wrin
kled shirts, no cleavage and no leaving the
house without at least one piece of flare
(Palin, for example, loves her polar bear pin).
Let's start with a breakdown of the GOP
candidates. According to the scientific journal
"Nature," being associated with the
Republican Party has unwittingly given
McCain and Palin a style advantage: in a
study of four sports during the 2004
Olympics, researchers found that athletes
who wore red were more likely to win. Even
Tiger Woods wears red on the final days of
golf tournaments because, according to his
mother, "red symbolizes power." And no mat
ter your political affiliation, you have to
admit that Sarah Palin and Cindy McCain
have been rocking the red power suits.
John McCain usually hits the pavement
in an oversized suit and red-striped tie or, for
casual events, a checkered button-up dress
shirt and a brown leather bomber jacket (in
case we forgot about his military back
ground). While his personal style doesn't
make any bold statements, Cindy is unafraid
to go for high-glamour. She was strutting her
stuff at the Republican National Convention
in a shiny yellow wrap dress by Oscar de la
Renta — part of an ensemble that would
retail for $300,000, according to Vanity Fair
editors.
This almost puts Palin's recent wardrobe
splurge to shame. A recent New York Times
article exposed the $150,000 Republican
campaign expenditure to "build her
wardrobe" for the campaign trail. This

expense alone might have been understand
able, especially since Palin had little prior
exposure to the global media's scrutiny before
the campaign began — and 1 think we'd all
be surprised at how much it costs to create a
cohesive, professional image from the ground
up. But what really baffles me is that Palins
makeup artist was reportedly the highest paid
worker in McCain's camp, earning $22,800 in
the first two weeks of October alone. Does
she really need that much help?
Aside from the economics of her
wardrobe, Palin always looks put-together in
flattering formal business suits, and I'm glad
she ditched her Tina Fey glasses for chic rim
less frames. I also have to give her points for
wearing Naughty Monkey-brand shoes at her
nomination press conference (very trendy!).
Now let's move on to the Kennedys — I
mean — the Obamas. Barack Obama's suit of
choice, slim-cut and single-breasted, has
earned him compliments from the likes of
David Letterman and Halle Berry, who both
said they felt his suit was very "electable" (or
did they mean delectable?) He favors skinny
ties, which may be on-trend in the suiting
world, but also make him look rather skinny
himself.
Michelle Obama, on the other hand,
loves to flaunt her curves — she wears figure
enhancing dresses in colorful fabrics that
exude feminine confidence. Michelle has won
a soft spot in my heart for supporting up
and-coming Chicago clothing designers as
well as mainstream favorites, like sporting a
print dress from White House Black Market
that retailed for $150 on The View. She's not
always so budget conscious, though — her
favorite pair of shoes are limmy Choo knee-
