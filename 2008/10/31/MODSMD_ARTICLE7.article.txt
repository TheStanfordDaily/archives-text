# Obama: presidential muse
## 
### 
Art as a political medium has long
been a familiar part of presidential
campaigns. Political cartoons — flat
tering or otherwise — abound around elec
tion time in newspapers, journals and Web
sites. The usual bichrome campaign poster
with the candidate's name, followed by a
snappy phrase or slogan, bores everyone to

Since the early 19905, British artist
Damien Hirst has been making lots of
noise in the art world. He is applauded,
chastised, imitated and parodied for his
works that bring death to life and ask the
audience to look more deeply at their sur
roundings; his most poignant pieces chal
lenge nature and the way we look at its
processes.
Hirst's first exhibition in 1988 was titled
"Freeze," and it allowed him to gain connec
tions in the art world that would later propel
him to the forefront. He met major art dealer

tears every four years.
Pumpkin carving, You Tube and
street graffiti, however, have been
noticeably absent in campaigns —
until now. Just in time for Halloween,
Yeswecarve.com features pictures of
aspiring artists and their pumpkin
masterpieces of "Oooobama," often
accompanied by the words "Change" or
"Vote" lovingly carved next to the
man's lantern-lit face. Right here in the
Bay Area, a series of graffitied Obama
images with angel wings can be found
at Linda Mar Beach.
Not all Obama-inspired art has
been as offbeat though. Street artist
Shepard Fairey's now infamous poster
of a determined-looking Obama star
ing off into the distance, with the word
"Hope" emblazoned across the bottom,
helped launch the recent deluge of
poster art floating around the Internet.

artistic support and in such mass quantity.

Charles Saatchi who would later become one
of Hirst's first customers. It was at these
shows that Hirst first began to use dead ani
mals.
The first piece of this nature, "A
Thousand Years," was a glass case displaying a
rotting cow's head, maggots, flies, sugar water
and a bug zapper. Given the audience did not
throw up, the piece was meant to show a
cycle of life beginning with the death of the
cow, which allows the maggots to become
flies, and then, the eventual death of the flies.
Not surprisingly, there were mixed reactions.

Warhol's mass-produced Marilyn prints, the
poster consists of six boxes of Obama —
looking presidential as usual — in various
bright color schemes.
Even Stanford students are not immune
to this rising trend of independent campaign
art. Nimbleweed, Stanford's bluegrass group,
recently covered and revamped will.i.am's
Emmy Award-winning video "Yes We Can."
The catchy bluegrass version, which can be
found on You Tube, features lines from the
inspirational speech Obama gave after the
New Hampshire primary.
Fiddler and Daily writer Molly Thomas
'11 said that though the group had never
focused on any other political issue for their
songs, "We had considered doing volunteer
work for Obama's campaign, so we felt really
strongly about wanting to support him."
Filmed at the deceptively dry Lake Lagunita,
the music video's grassy background and
bluegrass twang adds a rustic, homey feel to
the presidential candidate's message.

the omnipresent nature of Obama art. A

But, the few who enjoyed the work started
building up Hirst's reputation in the art
community.
At 1992's "Young British Artists" show,
Hirst finally entered the public conscience of
the art world. He exhibited for the first time
what is thought to be his most iconic piece,
"The Physical Impossibility of Death in the
Mind of Someone Living." The piece, cur
rently on display at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York, is a 14-foot
tiger shark preserved in formaldehyde in a
bluish glass container.
Most of Hirsts pieces can be broken up
into four categories: spin paintings, dot
paintings, cabinets and nature pieces. His
spin paintings are essentially gloss paint
thrown onto a fast rotating board to create a
beautiful explosion appearance. They are
given wild names, like "Spill of Light in
Destitute of Blackness" or "Tick Tick Tickety
Boo."
His dot art is exactly like it sounds —
symmetrical, brightly colored dots painted
on typically white backgrounds. (Lately, he
has been painting them on red and gold
backgrounds as he begins to move into a
more glitzy stage of his artwork.) Typically

Shcpard Fairey image, the shirts featured
Obama with Kanye-style shutter shades and
the words, "Live Sexy."
"It's weird to think of Obama as sexy,"
Faulus said, "but he is, especially compared
to McCain on the stage."
It's perhaps this perception of Obama
that is the source behind the mania. Though
Reagan may have arguably rivaled the charis
ma, not since Kennedy has a presidential
candidate had this much sex — and art —
appeal.
"He's iconic, and we wanted to use this
as a way to support the campaign and give to
a good cause," Paulus said, referring to the
partial proceeds from the shirts that would
go to helping refugees in Darfur.
If Obama art and altruistic donations to
Darfurians seem like disparate concepts,
think again. Even the campaign slogans on
Obama posters, bumper stickers and buttons
are incomplete without "Hope" or some
other similar, feel-good catchphrase.
Is this trend more a commentary on the
candidate or the values of contemporary cul
ture? Whatever the secret to the success, it's
clear that Barack Obama has become a
deeply entrenched face in pop art.

these paintings are titled after synthetic drugs
and chemicals, like "LSD" and "Gelsemine."
While Hirst's spin and dot works repre
sent more conventional art, his cabinets and
nature pieces push traditional boundaries
more. Early on, he began making cabinets
and arranging sets of things like pills and Sex
Pistols records on their shelves. As he has
become more prominent, the collections in
Hirst's cabinets have transitioned to dia
monds or meticulously painted drugs.
His nature pieces include vitrines of dif
ferent animals positioned and preserved in
formaldehyde. Hirst positions animals in
awkward figures, or cuts them up into pieces
in gruesome fashion to toy with ideas of
death. In fact, when Hirst tried to display
"Two Fucking and Two Watching," a rotting
bull and cow copulating, in an exhibition in
New York in 1995, public health officials had
to stop the show for fears that "visitors would
be vomiting everywhere." His other nature
pieces include paintings made out of flies,
like"Untided Black Monochrome (Without
Emotion)," and collages made out of butter
flies that give the appearance of a kaleido
scope or stained glass. These pieces ini
tially give an aesthetic pleasure,

but upon closer inspection shock the viewer by their
medium.
The initial shock and awe of Hirst's art seems to
have decreased in recent years, due in large part to his
auctions at Sotheby's. Critics claim he is a sell-out and
that his art is only created for the auction block. There
is large evidence for this. In September, he sold an
entire collection titled "Beautiful Inside my Head" for a
record £111 million. The most ostentatious example of

this money-tailored art is "For the
Love of God," an 18th-century skull
coated in platinum and covered with
8,601 flawless diamonds that cost
Hirst £14 million to produce. Hirst
claims that he has sold this piece to
an anonymous buyer for £50 million
in cash, but he can produce no
records and the British government
claims otherwise.
In addition, Hirst's studio has
become more of a nouveau Warhol
factory. What started as Hirst and a
few assistants has become Hirst
guiding an army of assistants to
churn out the same repetitive shock
art. In fact, Hirst claims that he has
only painted around five spot paint
ings, instead relying on his assistant
Rachel Howard.
Only time will tell if Damien
Hirst will be remembered as an
innovative artist of our time or sell
out with a factory that produces

rubberstamp artwork. But, he has done his part to
shock and scare both art enthusiasts and the friendly
museum visitor. If you've had enough with scary
movies this Halloween, just go online and look up
some of his art. It will suffice to make your blood cur
dle.

While Hirst's spin and dot works repre

nature pieces push traditional boundaries
more. Early on, he began making cabinets
and arranging sets of things like pills and Sex
Pistols records on their shelves. As he has
become more prominent, the collections in
Hirst's cabinets have transitioned to dia

His nature pieces include vitrines of dif

death. In fact, when Hirst tried to display
"Two Fucking and Two Watching," a rotting

New York in 1995, public health officials had
to stop the show for fears that "visitors would
be vomiting everywhere." His other nature

but upon closer inspection shock the viewer by their
medium.
The initial shock and awe of Hirst's art seems to
have decreased in recent years, due in large part to his
auctions at Sotheby's. Critics claim he is a sell-out and
that his art is only created for the auction block. There
is large evidence for this. In September, he sold an
entire collection titled "Beautiful Inside my Head" for a
record £111 million. The most ostentatious example of

this money-tailored art is "For the
Love of God," an 18th-century skull
coated in platinum and covered with
8,601 flawless diamonds that cost
Hirst £14 million to produce. Hirst
claims that he has sold this piece to
an anonymous buyer for £50 million
in cash, but he can produce no
records and the British government
claims otherwise.
In addition, Hirst's studio has
become more of a nouveau Warhol
factory. What started as Hirst and a
few assistants has become Hirst
guiding an army of assistants to
churn out the same repetitive shock
art. In fact, Hirst claims that he has
only painted around five spot paint
ings, instead relying on his assistant
Rachel Howard.
Only time will tell if Damien
Hirst will be remembered as an
innovative artist of our time or sell
out with a factory that produces

rubberstamp artwork. But, he has done his part to
shock and scare both art enthusiasts and the friendly
museum visitor. If you've had enough with scary
movies this Halloween, just go online and look up
some of his art. It will suffice to make your blood cur

Art as a political medium has long
been a familiar part of presidential
campaigns. Political cartoons — flat
tering or otherwise — abound around elec
tion time in newspapers, journals and Web
sites. The usual bichrome campaign poster
with the candidate's name, followed by a
snappy phrase or slogan, bores everyone to

Since the early 19905, British artist
Damien Hirst has been making lots of
noise in the art world. He is applauded,
chastised, imitated and parodied for his
works that bring death to life and ask the
audience to look more deeply at their sur
roundings; his most poignant pieces chal
lenge nature and the way we look at its
processes.
Hirst's first exhibition in 1988 was titled
"Freeze," and it allowed him to gain connec
tions in the art world that would later propel
him to the forefront. He met major art dealer

tears every four years.
Pumpkin carving, You Tube and
street graffiti, however, have been
noticeably absent in campaigns —
until now. Just in time for Halloween,
Yeswecarve.com features pictures of
aspiring artists and their pumpkin
masterpieces of "Oooobama," often
accompanied by the words "Change" or
"Vote" lovingly carved next to the
man's lantern-lit face. Right here in the
Bay Area, a series of graffitied Obama
images with angel wings can be found
at Linda Mar Beach.
Not all Obama-inspired art has
been as offbeat though. Street artist
Shepard Fairey's now infamous poster
of a determined-looking Obama star
ing off into the distance, with the word
"Hope" emblazoned across the bottom,
helped launch the recent deluge of
poster art floating around the Internet.

The first piece of this nature, "A
Thousand Years," was a glass case displaying a
rotting cow's head, maggots, flies, sugar water
and a bug zapper. Given the audience did not
throw up, the piece was meant to show a
cycle of life beginning with the death of the
cow, which allows the maggots to become
flies, and then, the eventual death of the flies.
Not surprisingly, there were mixed reactions.

found on You Tube, features lines from the

Fiddler and Daily writer Molly Thomas

focused on any other political issue for their
songs, "We had considered doing volunteer
work for Obama's campaign, so we felt really
strongly about wanting to support him."
Filmed at the deceptively dry Lake Lagunita,
the music video's grassy background and

But, the few who enjoyed the work started
building up Hirst's reputation in the art
community.
At 1992's "Young British Artists" show,
Hirst finally entered the public conscience of
the art world. He exhibited for the first time
what is thought to be his most iconic piece,
"The Physical Impossibility of Death in the
Mind of Someone Living." The piece, cur
rently on display at the Metropolitan
Museum of Art in New York, is a 14-foot
tiger shark preserved in formaldehyde in a
bluish glass container.
Most of Hirsts pieces can be broken up
into four categories: spin paintings, dot
paintings, cabinets and nature pieces. His
spin paintings are essentially gloss paint
thrown onto a fast rotating board to create a
beautiful explosion appearance. They are
given wild names, like "Spill of Light in
Destitute of Blackness" or "Tick Tick Tickety
Boo."
His dot art is exactly like it sounds —
