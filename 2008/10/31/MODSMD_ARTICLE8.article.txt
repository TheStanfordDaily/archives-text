# THE
						POLITICS OF PARODY
## How this year's campaign season has shaped this year's comedy season, and the other way around... 
### 
While Stephen Colbert's bid to run
for President of the United States
was ultimately rejected because he
was deemed "not a serious candidate," the
case that the political establishment made
against him is harder to accept than one
might think.
After all, the late-night comedian was
endorsed by the fastest-growing Facebook
group in history, and other "not serious"
celebrities, most notably Gov. Arnold
Schwarzenegger and possibly Al Franken,
have made major inroads in politics as of
late. Colbert's candidacy represented more
than just an easy joke, and the popularity of
his campaign actually served as evidence that
something is changing in the dynamic
between politics and political humor.
Political satire and "fake news" shows are
now more culturally relevant than ever
before. In the past year or so, programs like
"The Daily Show," "The Colbert Report" and
"Saturday Night Live" have not only lam
pooned current events, but they have in
effect become events themselves, holding sur
prising sway over the presidential campaigns
and perhaps speaking more to the American
political consciousness than the actual news.
A Classic Combination
The relationship between politics and
pop culture has always been notable, from
Richard Nixon's bizarre utterance of the line
"Sock it to me!" on the hit sketch comedy
show "Laugh-In" to Bill Clinton's soulful sax
solos on "The Arsenio Hall Show." In 2000,
the SNL sketches depicting Gore and Hush
were wildly popular, spawning the word
"strategery" and the running "lockbox" joke.
Yet in this campaign, the connection between
presidential-politics and satirical programs
has reached a new level.
In the new media-celebrity-politics cal
culus, candidates and the shows that mock
them work in tandem to create news. Sarah
Palin's recent appearance on "SNL," for

example, was eagerly anticipated by pundits
and the public alike as a possible venue for
her to turn the race around. Both Barack
Obama and John McCain have appeared on
"The Daily Show" numerous times. A small
feud between McCain and talk show host
David Letterman made headlines in the same
weeks as America's financial meltdown.
Earlier in the campaign season, Hillary
Clinton's presidential chances were nearly
saved when she made reference to an "SNL"
scene in which a moderator bullies her while
coddling Obama — even asking him if he
wants a pillow — during a debate with
Obama in the heat of the Democratic pri
mary. A Pew Research study showed that as a
result of Clinton's use of "SNL" as a fact
checker, the New York senator's standing and
sympathy in the media improved the follow
ing week, while pundits and reporters simul
taneously started seriously questioning their
treatment of Obama.
Objectivity?
The Clinton "SNL" episode raised a
compelling issue in regards to political satire:
Should the fake news world have anything
resembling journalistic objectivity in political
matters? Shows like "The Daily Show" and
"Colbert Report" do not, for instance, strive
for objectivity; they openly mock the Bush
and Clinton establishments at every turn and
go easy on the up-and-coming Obama.
Indeed, McCain is constantly assailed for
his age, anger and aimless, wandering ways,
and at this point the number of You Tube
searches for "Tina Fey Sarah Palin" are out
numbered probably only by "funny cats."
Obama, meanwhile, is mocked for coming
off as too cool, too awesome — or as "The
Onion" puts it: "Pro-Hope. Also supports
Dreams."
This is no surprise; the entertainment
industry is generally left-leaning, and even
when performers such as Colbert adopt a
conservative persona, it is for comedic effect

alone. (That much should be obvious to any
body, except perhaps the poor soul who
scheduled Colbert as the entertainer for the
2006 White House Correspondents Dinner.)
Moreover, comedy works best when
directed at power. Not surprisingly, over the
past eight years while conservatism has held
power, the best political comedy has been
left-leaning. Fox News' attempt to counter
this trend, billed as a conservative version of
"The Daily Show" called "The Half Hour
News Hour," never gained traction. It was
cancelled after less than a year on air, from
early 2007 to Fall 2007.
The Race Card
Perhaps the major reason that comedy
shows have generally treaded lightly in their

treatment of Obama has not so much to do
with political ideology, but with race. It is not
as if Obama cannot be parodied well. In fact,
he actually debunked this myth himself. At
the recent Alfred E. Smith Memorial Dinner,
Obama made some of the funniest critiques
of his character yet, poking fun at his alleged
Messianic complex by quipping that he was
"born on the planet Krypton and sent here
by [his] father Jor-El to save the Earth." The
Democratic candidate even joked about his
politically unfortunate middle name, saying
it was chosen by "someone who obviously
never thought [he] was going to run for pres
ident."
In light of all this, it is only natural to
wonder why the politician Obama's self
inflicted jokes hit harder than those of pro
fessional comedians. It is relevant to note
