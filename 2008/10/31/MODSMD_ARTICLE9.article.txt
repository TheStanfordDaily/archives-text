that some of the most successful satirical programs have an
extremely low percentage of black writers and performers.
"The Daily Show" features just one African-American cast
member, the seldom-used, aptly titled "Senior Black
Correspondent Larry Wilmore;" and the only black cast
member of "SNL," Kenan Thompson, is not a major player
on the show, but probably much to his chagrin, better known
for his role in "Good Burger."
In fact, the actor who portrays Obama on the show, Fred
Armisen, is not black. The audience, thus far, has been recep
tive to his portrayal, despite its slight awkwardness. He has
grasped some of the Illinois senator's mannerisms, but
whether because of the race factor or not, his portrayal of
Obama has yet to catch fire in

the national consciousness
in the way that Will
Ferrell's portrayal of
George W. Bush did —
or like Tina Fey's por
trayal of Sarah Palin.

The Politics of Palin
And if the current surge in popularity for satire could be
attributed to any one person, it would have to be Sarah Palin
To a degree, she brings it on herself, boasting of her state's
proximity to Russia, for instance. Recently "The Daily Show"
simply repeated her thoughts verbatim on the "pio-America
parts of the country" onscreen — additional commentary by
Jon Stewart wasn't even necessary to insight audience laugh
ter. Palinsanity has spread rapidly to the degree that it has
actually taken "SNL" over completely; in the last several
episodes of the show, viewership has dropped dramatically
after the first sketch, usually a scene starring Palin's dopple
ganger and imitator Fey.
Palin has become omnipresent in the satirical world —
so much so that it is worth considering why, exactly, she
invites such large amounts of ridicule. It cannot be solely
because she is such a silly person; after all, her Democratic
counterpart, Biden, is widely considered one of the most
gaffe-prone politicians in the country. At one rally, he spent
several moments imploring a veteran to stand up and take a
bow before he realized that the man was in fact paraplegic.
No, beyond her sheer goofiness there exists another
major reason that comedy programs have

treated Palin like, well, a hockey
puck. The McCain campaign didn't
vet the formerly unknown Palin
particularly carefully, so someone
had to — and why not late-night
TV? Indeed, as Palin's approval
numbers have diminished in
recent weeks after a stellar begin
ning, particularly with moderates
and independents, it's starting to
seem more like the myriad
moose-killing jokes have taken
their toll.

The Internet
Even for those who refuse to believe that professional
comedians hold any influence over presidential politics, one
last undeniable source of evidence proves that satire has infil
trated society like never before. All it takes to realize this is a
trip to what Colbert might call "the Internets." With the
widespread access that the Internet provides, an exposure
previously known only to network shows like "SNL," thou
sands of bloggers and You Tubers have taken up the mantle of
their comic heroes in making their own political mischief.
Weeks before Fey donned the Palin updo, hundreds of
Palin spoof videos already littered the online world — more
footage, in fact, than existed of the governor herself at that
point. In addition, popular internet memes have developed
like the oft-forwarded Photoshop image that compares the
four major candidates to types of trains: Obama to a sleek
bullet; Biden to a standard Amtrak; McCain to an old-timey,
Leland Stanford-style locomotive; and Palin to Thomas the
Tank Engine.
From the television screen to the computer screen, polit
ical humor has clearly come to have a profound effect on the
American consciousness. The increasingly satirical mindset
has created a nationwide culture that is at once both more
cynical and whimsical, and never before have the distinctions
been so blurred between loe the politician, Joe the performer
and, yes, loe the plumber — provided of course, that he,
unlike McCain, knows how to use a computer.
Overall, as more Americans become technologically liter
ate and politically savvy, it seems that this major cultural
shift, this steady stream of momentum, is leading the nation
down a bold and inevitable political path ...
