--What does a NO vote on Proposition 8 mean?
If Proposition 8 is defeated, the sanctity of marriage will be destroyed and its
powerful inflluence on the union of husband and wife wll instead become a rela
tionship between 'Party A' and 'Party B' (or even 'Party C'). The marriage of a
man and a woman has been at the heart of society since human history. It pro
motes the ideal opportunity for children to be raised by a mother and father in a
family held together by the communal and spiritual bonds of marriage. We
should put the best interest of children first, and that is traditional marriage.
Voting NO on Proposition 8 would destroy marraige as we know it. Shall we
redefine Father, Mother, Husband and Wife as well? If we want to relax the defi
nition of Marriage, can we also include polygamy in it? Could we redefine Mar
riage as "A marriage is a union between a group of people, regardless of sex
-Will Proposition 8 take away any rights for gay and lesbian
domestic partners?
No. Proposition 8 is not an attack on the gay lifestyle. Proposition 8 doesn't
take away any rights or benefits from gays or lesbians in domestic partnerships.
Under California law, "domestic partners shall have the same rights, protections
and benefits" as married spouses. (Family Code 297.5) There are no excep
tions. Proposition 8 will not change this. If a gay couple would like to be
reunited as a couple, they could use another term.
-If Propostion 8 does not pass, will my child be forced to learn
gay marriage at school?
Yes. In health education classes, state law requires teachers to instruct children
as young as kindergartners about marriage. (Education Code 51890.) A
teacher has the right in California to speak about sexuality in whatever form, age
appropriately (Ed. Code 51933). Now who determines the limit? Social study
shows that most behaviors are formed by learning and modeling. Parents
should be given the right to their children's education when they are minors.
PLEASE VOTE "YES" ON "8"!!!
