In a big-screen commercial during the homecoming football game, a
hand scrolled through the Course Work Web site and Stanford sports
scores. The product being marketed wasn't the glitzy iPhone, hut
iStanford — a suite of applications made by and tailored for Stanford
students.
The iStanford application, available since mid-September through
Apple's App Store, was so impressive that its creators took the grand
prize in AT&T's 2008 Big Mobile on Campus Challenge, a contest to
find the most innovative application created by college students for
mobile devices.
"[iStanford] is a suite of native iPhone applications that allow anyone
— students, teachers, administrators, the extended community — to do
a number of things," said Aaron Wasserman '10. "including search
Stanford Who [the Stanford directory], search the campus maps, search
the online course directory and get schedules and scores from every var
sity athletic team."
The creators of iStanford included Wasserman. Kayvon Beykpour
'10. Ben Cunningham '10. Felipe Pimentel '10 and Pablo Jablonski '10.
Each team member received an iPhone and will split the $10,000 grand
prize scholarship. As part of the prize, the group was flown to Orlando
and put up at the Ritz-Carlton from Oct. 28-31 for the EduCause
Annual Convention, where they demonstrated their product to industry
professionals.
Their work, however, could not have been completed without the
help of Apple. AT&T and most importantly, the University's administra
tion.
"The whole Stanford administration has been very supportive and
very behind us." Wasserman said, "but the registrar's office was really
our home base in connecting with other departments."
"They gave us the ability to tap into their database for classes and
for buildings," Beykpour added.
Two faculty members who were instrumental in the project were
Thomas Black, the University registrar and associate vice provost for
student affairs, and Director of Student Affairs Information Systems
lim Flood. Both Black and Flood own iPhones and use them regularly.
Black and Flood first had the vision for the iStanford application and
went to Apple with the goal of empowering students through mobile
devices. Apple referred them to Beykpour. who had done other Web
application development work through his company, Terribly Clever
Designs.
"We sat with [Black] and reconciled his really grand general vision
with really concrete ideas." Beykpour said.
Starting in late May of this year. Beykpour and his fellow students
pared down the sweeping goal to four applications of manageable
scope.
In mid-September, the iStanford application went live on the App
Store with a directory, campus map. course catalog and athletics net
work. Users have been emailing in future ideas for iStanford, ranging
from the logical — such as an accessible Stanford ePay and events cal
endar— to the very ambitious — such as a map for tracking the
Marguerite shuttles and the ability to use the iPhone as an ID card.
"We're not finished at all," Jablonski said. "We're always going to be
