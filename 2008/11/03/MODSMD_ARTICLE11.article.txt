# ELECTION '08
## Students turn out in force for phonebank Approx. 270 students volunteer, set state record this election season 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO 
Approximately 270 Stanford students braved
Saturday's rainstorm in an effort to rally against
California Proposition 8. The overwhelming sup
port displayed bv the Stanford community has
made this phone bank the largest of its kind in the
state.
The scene at the Women's Community Center
far from resembled a typical phone bank. People
were strewn across the floor and on couches as the
large number of students who dedicated their time
to the cause struggled to find seats.
The magnitude of student volunteers at the
Mega Phonebank was unprecedented.
"Our priority is to get students through the
door, to get students to be part of the campaign,"

said Amanda Gelender '10. who co-founded the
Stanford Theatre Activation Mobilization Project,
or STAMP. "'lTie activists on this campus talk all
the time about penetrating the Stanford Bubble. I
think we're going to see that at the end of the day.
we're reaching tens of thousands of voters off
campus."
Organized by the Student Coalition for
Marriage Equality (SCME) — along with other
student organizations such as STAMP and the
ASSU Executives — the "Vote Down 4 & 8 Mega
Phonebank" was the last phone bank on campus
rallying undecided voters against Prop. 8. Held
from noon to 8 p.m.. the Mega Phonebank accumu
lated 1,558 vows out of the 15,000 phone numbers
dialed.
Previous bi-weekly phone banks were held pri
marily in an effort to inform undeeided voters and
clarify any confusion. According to SCME member
Jamie Tarn '10, many of the poll results that showed
favor toward Prop. 8 can be attributed to voter con
fusion. Several voters, she said, believe that a yes

vote for Prop. 8 symbolized support for the LGBT
community.
Students also volunteered on Saturday night to
post educational flyers that outlined counter-argu
ments to arguments in favor of Prop. 8. Others
attended the football game against Washington
State on Saturday and held up signs that urged vot
ers not to support Prop. 8 in an effort to increase
visibility for their cause.
Some, like Matt Woloszyn '09. claim that issues
such as Prop. 8 are so important that other aspects
of their lives have taken a backseat to their political
responsibility.
"I'm really behind in my coursework. but that
doesn't really matter right now." he said. "I just
thought that I need to stop being an academic, get
off my butt and just start making things happen."
"Stanford students are not apolitical." Tam
added. "When push comes to shove, they will take
action. It makes me have hope in Stanford again."
