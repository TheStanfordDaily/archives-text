## Google files book settlement 
### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN 
A proposal for a settlement in a lawsuit con
cerning the Google Book Search project was filed
last Tuesday when Google, along with the Authors
Guild and the Association of American
Publishers, jointly submitted the proposition to
the U.S. District Court of the southern district of
New York.
The lawsuit was filed against the Google Book
Search project, which is an effort to index millions
of books online from the world's greatest libraries
and make them available and searchable to the
public. Copyright laws complicated the process,
bringing the two other parties — as well as
Stanford, the University of Michigan and the
University of California — to consult with
Google on the issue.
"We believed we were doing great things in a
legal way." said Andrew Herkovic. director of

communications and development for Stanford
Libraries. "The Author's Guild and the
Association of American Publishers felt other
wise. They felt that simply scanning the books at
all was a criminal infringement of their copy
rights."
The settlement would entail an undetermined
fee in order to access the content. Revenue would
come from a fee charged for the online subscrip
tions. and although the price is yet to be deter
mined. Google will grant a free license to one ter
minal in every post-graduate institution and pub
lic library in America where the books can be
accessed. ITiis would only become a reality if the
settlement is approved by the District Court.
According to Herkovic. such an outcome
would benefit authors and publishers, who would
once again be able to make a profit for books that
have been out of print.
"Suddenly, for the first time in the history of

the

world.it
creates a

potential revenue stream
for books that have already
lived through their publishing cycle." he said.
"Essentially, it creates a revenue stream for
authors and publishers where there hasn't been
one before."
Herkovic went on to explain how the three
universities had been involved in negotiations of
the settlement for roughly two years, with
Stanford joining the Google Book Search project
in 2004. The proposed settlement would avoid a
trial, introducing an entirely new set of principles.
"What the settlement does is it makes books
that are out of print available in full text."

Herkovic said. "It legitimizes
[Stanford's] providing books to
Google to be scanned. This licenses
it explicitly. It allows us to have dig
ital copies of the books we con
tribute."
Donna Hunter, an instructor in
the Program in Writing and
Rhetoric, was surprised to know the
project's hands were being legally
bound.
"I think the Google Book Search
project is important, and I didn't
realize that a lawsuit was preventing
this idea from becoming a reality,"
I lunter said.
Herkovic said that, if in court.
Google would be able "to clarify
and use its huge legal and economic
power to crush the copyright right
wing and favor a left fair use expan
sion doctrine."
Herkovic, however, was quick to
add that a trial would not necessari
ly guarantee a win.
Those unhappy with the settle
ment include those opposed to the
digitization of books in the first
place. Some believe in sticking to
traditional forms of research using
tangible books, while others, like the
Authors Guild and the Association
of American Publishers, genuinely
believe in a potential infringement
of copyright laws.
Others felt that access to Google
Book Search could only be seen as a
positive. Hunter felt that for stu
dents in writing classes such as
PWR, the settlement, if approved,
would vastly broaden research
opportunities.
"I imagine authors and publish
ers may feel threatened by digitizing
books, but I believe they need to
adapt their business models to work
with the 21st century technologies,"

Hunter said. "Providing more peo
ple access to more books will. I
believe, benefit everyone in the long
run."
Still, others are disappointed in
the undetermined fee to access the
digitized collections.
"We would love to give every
thing to everybody for free, but
there were huge interests involved
and a lot at stake." Herkovic said.
"The proposed settlement that
comes out of this is probably as
good a deal as could have come for
authors, publishers, Google and
readers and researchers."
The settlement's outcome now
lies in the hands of the District
Court in New York. According to
Herkovic, this could take anywhere
from weeks to months. If approved.
Stanford would also have to renego
tiate and revise its contract with
Google before the project could be
made available to the public.
"Ideally, those negotiations
would have been completed before
the proposed settlement was made
public, hut people got busy and it
didn't happen." Herkovic said. "I
would really like to think that we
will see resolution of the contract
negotiation between Google and
Stanford soon."
Other institutions such as
Oxford and Harvard had previously
been involved with the project, but
have not chosen to participate in the
settlement. The three remaining
consultants are the "largest partners
in terms of the volume of books that
were being provided to Google,"
according to 1 lerkovic.
"It really does provide a lot of
unprecedented benefits to the pub
lic," Herkovic said about the
Google Book Search project.
"These are important benefits that
Stanford considered important in
the first place."
