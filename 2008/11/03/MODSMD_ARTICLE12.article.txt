## Google files book settlement 
### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN 
A proposal for a settlement in a lawsuit con
cerning the Google Book Search project was filed
last Tuesday when Google, along with the Authors
Guild and the Association of American
Publishers, jointly submitted the proposition to
the U.S. District Court of the southern district of
New York.
The lawsuit was filed against the Google Book
Search project, which is an effort to index millions
of books online from the world's greatest libraries
and make them available and searchable to the
public. Copyright laws complicated the process,
bringing the two other parties — as well as
Stanford, the University of Michigan and the
University of California — to consult with
Google on the issue.
"We believed we were doing great things in a
legal way." said Andrew Herkovic. director of

communications and development for Stanford
Libraries. "The Author's Guild and the
Association of American Publishers felt other
wise. They felt that simply scanning the books at
all was a criminal infringement of their copy
rights."
The settlement would entail an undetermined
fee in order to access the content. Revenue would
come from a fee charged for the online subscrip
tions. and although the price is yet to be deter
mined. Google will grant a free license to one ter
minal in every post-graduate institution and pub
lic library in America where the books can be
accessed. ITiis would only become a reality if the
settlement is approved by the District Court.
According to Herkovic. such an outcome
would benefit authors and publishers, who would
once again be able to make a profit for books that
have been out of print.
"Suddenly, for the first time in the history of

the

world.it
creates a

potential revenue stream
for books that have already
lived through their publishing cycle." he said.
"Essentially, it creates a revenue stream for
authors and publishers where there hasn't been
one before."
Herkovic went on to explain how the three
universities had been involved in negotiations of
the settlement for roughly two years, with
Stanford joining the Google Book Search project
in 2004. The proposed settlement would avoid a
trial, introducing an entirely new set of principles.
"What the settlement does is it makes books
that are out of print available in full text."
