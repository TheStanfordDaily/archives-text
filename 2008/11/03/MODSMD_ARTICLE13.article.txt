# ELECTION '08
## Races to Watch: Georgia Senate, Virginia 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY 
Over the next two days, The Daily will preview
four races to watch come Election Day. today, the
112 ocus will he on Georgia's Senate race, and the role
Virginia will play in the presidential election.
Georgia Senate
Contestants: Saxhy Chambliss (Republican,
incumbent), Jim Martin (Democrat)
Real Clear Politics composite polling average:
Chambliss +2.7 percent
This race wasn't on anyone's radar until just
over a month ago. Martin has only been the
Democratic candidate since the beginning of
August, when he won a primary runoff over
Vernon Jones, and Chambliss was leading by dou
ble digits well into September. But this race, much
like its presidential counterpart in the state, has
since tightened — one mid-October poll had
Martin and Chambliss tied, and the majority of
polls have the race within four points.
Georgia has become a battleground, and an
important one to both the DNC and CI OP. ITie
Democrats want to secure 60 seats in the Senate,
which would give them a filibuster-proof majority.
The Democrats hold 51 seats (including two inde

pendents) and are expected to pick up at least
four seats. lTiey lead in three other races, and have
had favorable polling in a fourth. That would give
them a total of 59 seats. With races in Mississippi
and Kentucky slipping further out of reach.
Georgia has the best chance of becoming that 60th
seat.
The DSCC and NRSC have thus invested
heavily in the race. The Republicans expect to
spend $1.3 million in the state over the final few
days; the Democrats expect to spend $1.6 million.
Influential PACs such as Vote Vets have bought
airtime throughout the state.
The race depends heavily on African-
American turnout. Georgia has a significant black
population: 30 percent of the state is black.
African Americans make up a similar percentage
of the state's registered voters — 29 percent. For
Martin to win, he would need black voter turnout
to reach at least that percentage, and likely higher,
at above 30 percent. African Americans are not
completely sold on Martin, hut they are on Barack
Obama — he is expected to win over 95 percent of
the black vote, both in Georgia and nationwide.To
win. Martin would need to ride Obama's eoattails
the Illinois senator is expected to turn out
record numbers of blacks to the polls. Indeed, in
Georgia's early voting, which just concluded.

about 35 percent of voters were African
American.
However. Martin has to do more than simply
win on Tuesday — he also needs to eclipse 50 per
cent of the vote, or else the race will go to a runoff
later in the year, when he will not have the benefit
of Obama's presence in the state.
The race boils down to this: In order for the
Democrats to pull off the upset, they need not
only a continued high turnout among African
Americans, but a win decisive enough that it does
not go to a runoff, where Chambliss will have the
clear upper hand.
Virginia presidential race
Real Clear Politics composite polling average:
Obama +3.N percent
2(M)4 result: Bush +8.2 percent
Five lbirty Hight. an electoral projections site,
called Virginia Obama's "firewall." They couldn't
have been more accurate. Virginia will give the
nation a nice indicator of how the election could
turn out — if Obama wins the Commonwealth, his
election to the presidency is almost inevitable. If
McCain wins, then the night could get interesting.
As of right now. Obama is expect
ed to win all of the states John Kerry
won. plus lowa. That would give him
259 of the 270 votes necessary to
emerge victorious. Virginia, with its
13 electoral votes, would push him
over the top. The lone Kerry state
where the McCain campaign is seri
ously on the offensive is
Pennsylvania, which has 21 electoral
votes. While the Keystone State is in
Obama s column, it has tightened. If
Obama were to lose there, a win in
Virginia, an East Coast state that
leans his way. would become almost a
necessity — otherwise. Obama
would go into true tossup races like
Indiana. North Carolina and Florida
needing a considerable number of
votes to reach 270. From there, it
would be anyone's ballgame, as
Obama's strength in the southwest
(New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada)
would be rendered moot if he can't
pick up an eastern tossup.
Virginia is an interesting case:
The traditionally red state hasn't
been won by a Democrat since
Lyndon Johnson in 1964. but it has
been treading blue in recent years.
With the all-but-guaranteed election
of former governor Mark Warner to
the Senate in 2008, Virginia will have
two Democratic senators and a

Democratic governor. However, the
Virginian Congressional delegation
is still primarily Republican, and the
bicameral state general assembly is
under GOP control as well.
Virginia is thus a state divided, and
an interesting microcosm of the gener
al election. On the one hand, the
northern, more Democratic part of
the state has seen a drastic population
increase since 2(XX) that skews the
demographics of the state more
toward the center, however, the south
west portion of the state has a strong
Evangelical, conservative base. That
means that the main battleground in
the state is the southeast, which has a
strong minority and military presence.
According to a recent poll by The
Military Times. McCain is favored
among military personnel at nearly a
3:1 margin. However. Obama has
tried to make inroads with the military
community after he received the
endorsement of Colin Powell, a for
mer Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff. Additionally. 20 percent of the
population of the region is African
American —as noted above, blacks
break for Obama at a staggering rate.
The showdown for Virginia is and
will continue to be intense — the
two candidates have combined to
spend over three million dollars in
television ads there — and could be
a bellwether for the election as a
whole.
