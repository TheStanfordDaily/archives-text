## Races to Watch: Georgia Senate, Virginia 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY 
Over the next two days, The Daily will preview
four races to watch come Election Day. today, the
112 ocus will he on Georgia's Senate race, and the role
Virginia will play in the presidential election.
Georgia Senate
Contestants: Saxhy Chambliss (Republican,
incumbent), Jim Martin (Democrat)
Real Clear Politics composite polling average:
Chambliss +2.7 percent
This race wasn't on anyone's radar until just
over a month ago. Martin has only been the
Democratic candidate since the beginning of
August, when he won a primary runoff over
Vernon Jones, and Chambliss was leading by dou
ble digits well into September. But this race, much
like its presidential counterpart in the state, has
since tightened — one mid-October poll had
Martin and Chambliss tied, and the majority of
polls have the race within four points.
Georgia has become a battleground, and an
important one to both the DNC and CI OP. ITie
Democrats want to secure 60 seats in the Senate,
which would give them a filibuster-proof majority.
The Democrats hold 51 seats (including two inde

pendents) and are expected to pick up at least
four seats. lTiey lead in three other races, and have
had favorable polling in a fourth. That would give
them a total of 59 seats. With races in Mississippi
and Kentucky slipping further out of reach.
Georgia has the best chance of becoming that 60th
seat.
The DSCC and NRSC have thus invested
heavily in the race. The Republicans expect to
spend $1.3 million in the state over the final few
days; the Democrats expect to spend $1.6 million.
Influential PACs such as Vote Vets have bought
airtime throughout the state.
The race depends heavily on African-
American turnout. Georgia has a significant black
population: 30 percent of the state is black.
African Americans make up a similar percentage
of the state's registered voters — 29 percent. For
Martin to win, he would need black voter turnout
to reach at least that percentage, and likely higher,
at above 30 percent. African Americans are not
completely sold on Martin, hut they are on Barack
Obama — he is expected to win over 95 percent of
the black vote, both in Georgia and nationwide.To
win. Martin would need to ride Obama's eoattails
the Illinois senator is expected to turn out
record numbers of blacks to the polls. Indeed, in
Georgia's early voting, which just concluded.

about 35 percent of voters were African
American.
However. Martin has to do more than simply
win on Tuesday — he also needs to eclipse 50 per
cent of the vote, or else the race will go to a runoff
later in the year, when he will not have the benefit
of Obama's presence in the state.
The race boils down to this: In order for the
Democrats to pull off the upset, they need not
only a continued high turnout among African
Americans, but a win decisive enough that it does
not go to a runoff, where Chambliss will have the
clear upper hand.
Virginia presidential race
Real Clear Politics composite polling average:
Obama +3.N percent
2(M)4 result: Bush +8.2 percent
Five lbirty Hight. an electoral projections site,
called Virginia Obama's "firewall." They couldn't
have been more accurate. Virginia will give the
nation a nice indicator of how the election could
turn out — if Obama wins the Commonwealth, his
election to the presidency is almost inevitable. If
McCain wins, then the night could get interesting.
