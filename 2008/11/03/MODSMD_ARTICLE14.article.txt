## EDITORIAL Barack Obama for president 
### 
It goes without saying that tomorrow is a
pivotal day for the future of America. Our
next president will inherit an economic
crisis, two wars, a nation of families losing
their homes and an increasingly anti-Ameri
can global landscape. The two parties pro
duced their best candidates. Senators Barack
Obama of Illinois and John McCain of Ari
zona.
After examining what each candidate of
fers not only Americans, but also Stanford
students specifically, the clear choice for
president is Obama. This endorsement may
not surprise some. Republican vice-presi
dential nominee Sarah Palin would probably
categorize the editorial board as part of the
liberal, elite, "gotcha" media.
Our choice, however, was not forged by
party ideologies or any "liberal" agenda.The
editorial board believes that Obama is the
best choice for president because he best
represents the values, the goals and the in
ventive spirit we all share on the Farm. As we
stand on the brink of adulthood about to
enter the "real world," we also must consider
the policies that will allow us to inherit an
America of promise, not one that continues
the exact same policies that contributed to
the current international and political crises.
The economy is the No. 1 issue in this elec
tion and for good reason. Students in partic
ular will be directly impacted by the current
economic crisis. We face a terrible job mar
ket. decline in wages and bonuses, rising un
employment rates, increasing struggles to
pay tuition, higher healthcare and costs of
living and a collapsing stock market. Bush's
deregulation of Wall Street and tax breaks
for the wealthy have left our nation in the
midst of what is possibly the worst economic
crisis since the Great Depression.
And yet. McCain wants to continue many
of these same economic policies, arguing that
American economic fundamentals are
strong. America cannot stand four more
years of failure. We clearly need economic re
form and increased governmental responsi
bility to protect Americans from the
unchecked greed that helped bring about the
crisis. Obama offers a more equitable eco
nomic program of tax breaks for the middle
class, anyone making less than $250,000 a
year. As most of us will be entering the job
market at entry-level positions that fall into
this category, the majority of tax-paying
graduates would benefit from Obama's tax
plan.
Lest we forget the War on Terror, we are
also in the midst of two major wars on two
fronts, with no clear plan or definition of vic
tory, despite McCain's persistent claims that
"we are winning." Yet. Obama's thoughtful
and rational early opposition to the war and
astute call for pulling out of Iraq in favor of
the war against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in

Afghanistan show sound military judgment.
Senator McCain instead chooses to labor on
to protect our troops from the shame of de
feat. We should not sacrifice lives and valu
able resources over a pointless, un-winnable
war when the true threat grows unchecked
because our military is overstretched.
But above all. we value intelligence and
education. We are all at Stanford because we
value the power of knowledge and intellectu
al endeavor. And for us, the most damning
and inexcusable feature of the McCain-Palin
presidential ticket is that it represents the
anti-intellectual presidency.
The McCain-Palin campaign persistently
and flippantly criticizes "elites," tossing the
phrase about to characterize everyone from
the news anchors who interview Palin to
Obama himself. McCain and Palin put a neg
ative spin on "elites" and instead champion
everymen like "Joe the Plumber" and hock
ey moms who embody what Palin describes
as "real America."These attacks devalue our
Stanford education. Stanford students and
graduates are no more or no less valuable to
society than "Joe the Plumber." We are all
"real" Americans.
We walk a dangerous and potentially dis
astrous fine line when we start rejecting the
value of intellect. We send our elite athletes
to the Olympics, we give Nobel prizes to elite
minds and make our elite soldiers Marines
— why can't our nation be represented by
the best and brightest America has to offer?
While McCain's 26-year career in the
Senate and service to his country are com
mendable, such campaign tactics have placed
his run among arguably the dirtiest of all
time. This is ironic considering that McCain
himself was the victim of a smear campaign,
when a 2000 South Carolina primary ad cam
paign suggested that his adopted daughter
was his illegitimate child. His alarming pick
of the untested and controversial Sarah Palin
for vice president further reveals a despera
tion to be elected president at any cost. This
desperate, shoot-from-the-hip style of judg
ment is exactly what America does not need
right now.
We particularly urge Hillary Clinton sup
porters who feel disenfranchised to cast their
ballots for the candidate Clinton now backs.
Do not let spite override the shared beliefs
both Senators Clinton and Obama have cru
saded for. Do not let your disappointment
cause you to vote for a Republican ticket that
stands for everything Clinton was against.
Finally, we recognize that some Stanford
students may be undecided. We urge them to
think about our future, what we will inherit.
This is the time to vote for vision, integrity
and, above all, change. We deserve compas
sion, vision, innovation and responsible lead
ership— qualities Senator Barack Obama
will bring to the White House.
