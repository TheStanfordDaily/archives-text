# STEAL THIS COLUMN
## The
						rewards of the road not taken 
### 
I'll start with this: If I read a bunch of
angry comments attacking anyone men
tioned in this column,or anyone who dis
agrees with them on Middle East issues, as
either ignorant or stupid. I'll know that my
purpose in writing what follows will have
failed.
There. I got that out of the way ...
I find the role of professors at a universi
ty intriguing. While on the one hand, there
is no rule preventing a professor from dis
tributing his or her own political views, we
as students place a certain level of trust in
our professors to leave their own politics
outside the classroom. I understand that
this is a formidable challenge,and may even
be impossible at times.
Among the four classes I am taking this
quarter, I have found my experience in the
course entitled "Gandhi and Nonviolence"
the most challenging. The course is taught
by Professor Linda Hess, from whom I
asked, and received, permission to express
my views in this column, despite our differ
ences.
I have great admiration for Prof. Hess,
who exudes the serenity and optimism that
her Buddhist practice has given to her. From
my limited experience talking to her during
her "walking office hours," I have gained
not only a greater insight into the powerful
character of Gandhi,but also the inspiration
Prof. Hess has derived from him.
Prof. Hess has mentioned the topic of
the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as an alle
gory for India and Britain several times in
passing during our class, often in a way
that underlines her support for the Pales
tinian cause and her disapproval for Is
rael's actions.
I have no issue with her support for
Palestinians. I believe, as do most people
who are pro-Israel, in the Palestinian peo
ple having their own state, given that Is

racTs safety is not sacrificed in the process.
I did not, however, feel totally comfort
able with Prof. Mess's focus on Palestinian
suffering, without giving what I view as a
fair account of the Israeli loss of life at the
hands of Palestinian terrorism. Additional
ly, having proudly served in the pro-Israel,
pro-peace community, both at Stanford and
outside, I found the implicit comparison in
the context of this class troubling and erro
neous, given the numerous historical and
contextual differences.
The tendency for Israel defenders, my
self included, is to take immediate, staunch
and fiery action against those who we feel
have unfairly characterized the Israeli-
Palestinian conflict. I have been taught, as
both a Jew and a defender of Israel — the
two are not necessarily the same — that I
must defend myself from those with preju
dices against me. History has shown that no
one else will.
The fact that history has provided us
with lessons, however, does not mean we
can apply those lessons the same way no
matter what the situation. Don't get me
wrong: I wanted to yell. I wanted to walk
out of the classroom or drop the class. I
wanted to complain. After reflection,
though, I resisted my urge to do any of
these things, realizing that in the process of
doing so, at the very best, I would end up
with less knowledge of Gandhi, and at the
