## Proposition 4 protects no one, endangers many 
### 
I was pleased to open The Daily on Oct. 30
to find a well-written editorial opposing
Proposition 4 and bringing to light the
many problems it creates. Prop. 4 masquer
ades as a measure to keep teens safe and im
prove family communication — both ad
mirable goals — but in reality it will achieve
neither. To appreciate its true nature and
consequences, we must think beyond our
own secure and stable social networks and
consider the situations of the many teens this
would affect.
As noted by the editorial board in the Oct.
30 issue, if Prop. 4 passes,pregnant minors will
be required to notify their parents before
seeking an abortion. However, most girls al
ready consult their parents or another respon
sible adult, and those who don't have very
good reasons for not doing so.
Telling parents about a pregnancy implies
confessing to being sexually active.This can be

a daunting task for anyone, let alone for those
whose parents are abusive, strict or simply un
supportive. Consider the situation of girls who
suffer domestic abuse. What if the pregnancy
is the product of incest? Can we really expect
these girls to confront their parents?
Proponents of the legislation assert that
Prop. 4 will protect girls from abuse by ensur
ing the abuse and rape are reported and ad
dressed. But Planned Parenthood already
diligently reports violence. The proposition
will not help address these issues; if anything,
more girls won't tell anyone or will find ways
around the law for fear of their parents' reac
tions.
In theory, the proposition provides options
for girls who are scared or unwilling to talk to
their parents. Technically, a minor can turn to
a grandmother, aunt or other responsible
adult whom she trusts, but doing so would au
tomatically trigger an investigation into her
family life. Alternatively, she can attempt to
obtain a judicial bypass.
To appreciate the feasibility of this option,
let's think about what a pregnant minor
would have to do. First, she would have to fig
ure out where the courthouse is and how to
get there. Upon arriving, she would explain
her situation to the clerk, who would give her
a stack of paperwork. Next she would need to

explain to a court-appointed guardian and to
a lawyer how she got pregnant and why she
can't tell her parents. Several days later, she
would have to appear in court and reveal the
personal, perhaps painful, details of her preg
nancy and her family life to the judge. If she
were able to convince the judge that this is in
her best interest or that she is sufficiently ma
ture to make this decision without her par
ent's involvement, she would get a waiver. If
not, she would have to appeal or give up. Sim
ple, right? I am 21 years old and have taken
classes about the legal system, but I would still
be overwhelmed, confused and intimidated
by this process.
So. unless pregnant teens have supportive
parents or have the time, courage and tenacity
to navigate the court system, they will be left
with few options and may become depressed,
turn to unsafe measures or even contemplate
suicide. Yes, teenagers faced with unplanned
pregnancies need support and guidance, but
Prop. 4 is not the way to achieve this. If we re
ally want to protect our teens, we must reach
out to those who are most vulnerable and find
ways to give them more options, not fewer.
