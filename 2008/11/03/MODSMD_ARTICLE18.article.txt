common myth
Apparently. Prop. 8 supporters no longer just
hate gays, but are repressed homosexuals who
share with militant Islam a lust for theocratic to
talitarianism. Meanwhile, Prop. 8 opponents
don't just support the monolithic gay agenda, but
are opening the door for man/dog marriage and
want to eviscerate your religion.
Such boilerplate accusations and recrimina
tions on both sides obscure a fundamental dis
agreement about what marriage is currently
and what it should become.
To quote Webb's "Like A Rock" column in
The Daily, supporters of same-sex marriage de
fine marriage "as a commitment two people

make, regardless of their genders, to spend their
lives together. Nothing else." To say that mar
riage is "nothing else" gives marriage a very
narrow definition. Marriage involves much,
much more.
Marriage is a social institution and is defined
hy a unique web of public meanings. When your
post-modern sociology professor droned on
and on about the "self' being "socially con
structed" he was referring to the ability of insti
tutions to shape and transform individuals
through such shared meanings. This direction
and transformation are the "social goods" that
institutions produce. A narrow definition of
marriage ignores many of the valuable "social
goods" that man/woman marriage creates.
First, man/woman marriage safeguards the
right of a child to be raised by his or her biolog
ical parents. Exceptions such as adoption are
valid only if they better serve the interests of
the child. But children in same-sex marriages
would be automatically denied the right to be
raised by two biological parents.
Next, as a social institution, man/woman
marriage maximizes the welfare of children.
Married, biological mother/father rearing is
best lor the child and thus, in aggregate, for so
ciety.
In addition, the principal sexual divide in the
United States is not between gay and straight;it
is between male and female. Man/woman mar
riage bridges the male-female divide more
completely and effectively than any other so
cial institution.
F inally, man/woman marriage confers statuses
and identities on individuals that are beneficial to
society. Marriage turns the male into a husband
and father and the female into wife and mother
— each taking on burdens and responsibilities

outside of personal self-interest.
Every "social good" described above is pro
duced primarily and often uniquely by the
man/woman definition of marriage. If this defi
nition is deinstitutionalized, then the social
goods it once produced will necessarily be lost.
Using a narrow "close, personal relationship"
model of marriage, opponents of Prop. K ignore
many of these benefits. Boldly, they claim that a
fundamental deinstitutionalization of
man/woman marriage will not change any
thing.
Intelligent, reasonable people disagree over
these "facts of marriage." In the relevant court
cases, both the California and Massachusetts
Supreme Courts predicated their subsequent
rulings on a narrow, personal relationship
model of marriage. On the other hand. Wash
ington. New York and Maryland state courts
referenced a more broad definition that in
cludes many of the social goods listed above.
The same pattern repeats itself in academic re
search — different definitions of what mar
riage is and should be lead to different conclu
sions about its alteration.Together, these stud
ies and cases provide support to both sides of
the Prop 8 debate.
What is harmful, what is disingenuous, is to
cite the relevant cases and literature that sup
port your opinion and then use rhetoric to ques
tion the values, morals and intentions of the
other side. Especially here at Stanford, we
should be able to cut through the vitriol sur
rounding these controversial issues and recog
nize that there are multiple legitimate view
points, some of which may even conflict with
our own.
