As a strong supporter of Stanford's
Teacher Education Program (STEP), I appre
ciate the passion expressed in Mark West's
op-ed piece in the Oct. 30 issue of The Daily,
though I believe he misunderstood my com
ments about the size of the program and the
University's commitment to training teach
ers.
By design. STEP is oriented toward a
number of important objectives. First, it pre
pares exceptional professional teachers with
the capacity and commitment to help our na
tion's children be successful in school. Sec
ond, the program serves as a research vehicle
to explore and analyze the best practices in
the field of teacher education. STEP'S excep
tional and well-deserved national reputation
is built in large measure by the intensity of re
sources it is able to provide in support of its
teaching candidates and its mission.
I also believe strongly that teaching is a
profession, and thus, like other professional
degrees at Stanford, the program is offered
only at the graduate level. An intensive pro
fessional degree program, such as STEP, will
naturally be smaller than the undergraduate
teaching preparation programs offered at
other institutions.
I"he University has been an enthusiastic

supporter of the STEP program, providing,
for example, half the funds for The Dorothy
Durfee Avery Loan Forgiveness Program
that helps graduates of STEP repay their
graduate school loans. We take great pride in
the education that STEP provides and the
quality of professional teachers it produces.
JOHN HFNNESSY
Stanford University President

We were glad to see one of our teacher
candidates point out the importance of well
prepared teachers on the Opinions page on
Oct. 30. We suspect, however, that President
Hennessy's comments about expanding
teacher education at Stanford were misun
derstood or at least misjudged.
President Hennessy has been extraordi
narily supportive of our teacher education
program (STEP). For example, he encour
aged a generous donor to give $10 million and
added to it an additional $10 million in Uni
versity funds,establishing the Avery-Stanford
loan forgiveness program for STEP students.
Similarly, he recently matched another
donor's generous gift, creating the first en
dowed clinical associate position for the

School of Education, which supports the im
portant work we do to bridge theory and
practice in our teacher preparation program.
President Hennessy has featured our
teacher candidates at many events and has re
peatedly lauded the program in public fo
rums. Indeed, he is perceived by foundations
and university leaders in the country as one of
the strongest spokespersons for investing in
teacher preparation. His leadership in
teacher education was also recognized as un
paralleled in our recent re-accreditation of
Stanford's teacher education program.
With regard to the program's size, STEP
was expanded four years ago to include an el
ementary teacher preparation program. Fur
ther expansion is not being considered. Un
like the Law School and the Graduate School
of Business, the School of Education has
many (close to 200) doctoral students and
many other masters programs in addition to
STEP.
The relatively small size of the overall
school is a strength and one of the things that
attracts such talented students. Stanford could
never prepare more than a small proportion of
the thousands of teachers who need to be cre-
