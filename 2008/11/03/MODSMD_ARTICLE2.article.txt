# ELECTION '08
## Student voters rush to mail Absentee voters make choices before Nov. 4 
### THOMAS YEH 
Even though polls open for the
general election on Tuesday, many
Stanford students across campus
have already cast their ballots. Not
only have these students taken part
in deciding on our future leaders
and various state legislation, they
have also made an active decision
on where their votes will be count
ed.
Under the concept of "vote-by
mail" voting (the lawful term for the
absentee method), students have
been given the opportunity to
choose between registering as vot
ers in California's Santa Clara
County or as vote-bv-mail voters in
their home counties and states.
