# ELECTION '08
## Student voters rush to mail Absentee voters make choices before Nov. 4 
### THOMAS YEH 
Even though polls open for the
general election on Tuesday, many
Stanford students across campus
have already cast their ballots. Not
only have these students taken part
in deciding on our future leaders
and various state legislation, they
have also made an active decision
on where their votes will be count
ed.
Under the concept of "vote-by
mail" voting (the lawful term for the
absentee method), students have
been given the opportunity to
choose between registering as vot
ers in California's Santa Clara
County or as vote-bv-mail voters in
their home counties and states.

Students' reasons vary for
choosing one option over the other,
but their decisions predominantly
reflect their desire to have a
stronger voice on certain issues.
Voting in California allows students
to have an active say on the state's
controversial, initiative-based bal
lot propositions. But some argue
that it deprives them of a stronger
voice in the presidential election, as
well as any say at all in decisions
being made in their own home
states or counties.
Winston Lofton '09 ultimately
chose to cast his vote in his home
town of Bellevue, Wash. He
explained his inherent conflict
between the two alternatives.
"My feelings are somewhat
torn." Lofton said. "On one hand.
[Propositions] 4. 6. X and 9 are
extremely important for civil rights
in our time, and California state law
seems to have a pretty big symbolic
impact on states across the nation.
On the other hand, there's a close
Congressional race in my district
that I wanted to vote in."
"I also feel more of an attach
ment to my hometown and hence
am more concerned with what hap
pens there politically," he added.
lor Kate Erickson 12 from
Massachusetts, the decision to vote
in California was an easier one.
"The Massachusetts election is
probably one of the least contested
out there.Though chances are good
that California will also go
|Democratic]. I still feel that my
vote is being better used in this
state," Erickson said. "Also, all the
[propositions! in Massachusetts this
year dealt with income and proper
ty tax. which, as a non-land owning
college student, I care very little
about at this point in time. The
[propositions] in California are
much more interesting."
Many students from swing states
Florida, Pennsylvania. Ohio and
Virginia â€” shared the same senti
ment about wanting a greater role
in the presidential decision, and
thus chose to forego the ability to
vote at Stanford on Flection Day in
order to have their ballots counted
elsewhere.
"I'm voting absentee in
Pennsylvania," said Mike Young, a

first-year Ph.D. candidate in electri
cal engineering. "My vote matters
more there."
Lucia Constantine '10 of
Jacksonville, Fla. agreed.
"1 was somewhat disenchanted
with the whole absentee process
because there was no real feeling of
having voted." Constantine said. "I
didn't wait in line, I didn't get to go
in a booth and I didn't get a sticker.
But it was important to me to vote
in my home state because I feel like
Florida will play a crucial role in
determining this election, whereas
California is already decided."
Californians, including those
registered in Santa Clara County
who simply do not wish to visit polls
on Tuesday, could also apply for
vote-by-mail ballots before the Oct.
2K deadline. Andrew Dow '09 of
Irvine, CA used priority mailing to
ensure that his ballot reached the
Orange County election office by
Nov. 4.
"In addition to having a say in
the more conservative Orange
County and being able to influence
that election on a local level, it just
seems easier to do vote-by-mail."
Dow said. "I don't have to worry
about waiting at the poll. 1 can do it
on my own time, mail it in and not
have to worry about going to a cer
tain place during a certain window
of time."
Elma Rosas, spokeswoman for
the Santa Clara County Registrar
of Voters, noted that Stanford stu
dents had been clearly informed of
the alternatives provided to them.
"We've been doing a lot of pub
licity with Stanford," she said.
"What we're trying to do is to get
students really prepared and to give
them opportunities to express their
voices in any way they prefer."
The choice ultimately comes
down to balancing different aspects
of that voice.
"Since arriving at Stanford. I
have voted in California once and
Oregon once, and now will be vot
ing in California again." said
Oregonian Anna Waxham-
Blackwell '09, referring to the
midterm and primary elections. "I
care deeply about Propositions 4
and N. and there are no comparably
important measures in Oregon this
year. I take each election as an
opportunity to make the biggest
impact possible."
