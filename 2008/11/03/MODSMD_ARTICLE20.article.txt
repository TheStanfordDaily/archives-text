GAME NOTES: Stanford lost its first game this season when it
fell to the UCLA 1 -0 on Friday. The Cardinal will now pre
pare for this Saturday's match-up with Cal. The game will be
the team's last before the start of the NCAA Tournament.

The No. 5 Stanford women's soccer team
suffered its first defeat of the season this week
end. losing to No. 4 UCLA in Los Angeles on
Friday. However, the Cardinal got the chance
to rebound quickly, defeating No. 10 USC on
Sunday and leaving itself a slight chance of a
conference title.
The UCLA match figured to be a tough one
for Stanford from the start. The Bruins came

into the game undefeated at home over 44 con
secutive matches and had not lost to a Pacific
-10 Conference opponent in over two years. On
top of that, the Cardinal was hit with some ter
rible luck when junior forward Kelley O'Hara
suffered a freak concussion in practice and was
forced to sit out.
Still, the game featured the Pac-10'stoptwo
teams, who at the time were two of just three
unbeaten teams in the nation. Fittingly, it
proved to be a nail-biter and a very well-played

match.
Both teams managed to create offensive
chances throughout the game, and both goal
keepers were forced to make eight saves — a
season high for sophomore Kira Maker, whose
high-octane offense and controlling defense
have given her excellent protection this season.
Stanford's freshmen had an impressive
showing once again, with midfielder Cami
Levin putting three shots on goal and forward
Teresa Noyola adding another two. Fellow
freshman Lindsay Taylor, the conference's
leading goal-scorer, had two shots of her own,
one of them on goal.
ITie Cardinal's best chance of the game,
though, came via sophomore forward Christen
Press in the 65th minute. Press put a powerful
shot past UCLA goalkeeper Ashley Thomp
son, but it ricocheted off of the net's crossbar.
Just 12 minutes later, Christina DiMartino
gave UCLA the first and only lead they would
need to finish off the Cardinal, blasting a bend
ing shot from 25 yards out past Maker. The
Cardinal was unable to find a late equalizer
and the game would end 1-0.
Stanford head coach Paul Ratcliffe was
proud of the way his team played, but admitted
that losing O'Hara — widely considered one
of the most dangerous forwards in the nation
— was a big blow.
"It really hurt us because she's an inspira
tional player," he said. "We still played very
well, but she's such a spark for the team."
The Cardinal had no time to dwell on its
first defeat of the season, though, as it battled
defending champion USC on Sunday after
noon. O'Hara was back in the lineup for Stan
ford, but it was the Trojan attack that dominat
ed early, recording four of the game's first five
shots. But the match would more or less even
out. and both teams went into halftime score
less.
The second half proved to be a different
story,as the Cardinal had the brighter start and
got on the board in the 54th minute. Noyola
sent in a corner kick and senior defender Alli
son Falk headed it in off the crossbar to give
her team the lead.The goal, her first of the sea
son. was well-deserved as Falk has seen the
crossbar deny her on multiple occasions this
season.
The match then turned decidedly more
physical, as two USC players received red
cards in the span of three and a half minutes,
while Stanford attempted to wrap up the game.
With just over six minutes remaining, Taylor
scored her 16th goal of the season on a low shot
to the left corner of the net. Then in the 89th
minute. Press rilled a shot from 30 yards out
over the goalkeeper to push the lead to 3-o.The
Trojans' Ashli Sandoval notched a consolation
goal in the dying seconds of the game.
Although the victory over the Trojans was
n't the team's prettiest of the year. Ratcliffe
was very happy with the way his team bounced
back from a heartbreaking loss.
"Both of our opponents this weekend were
very strong teams," Ratcliffe said. "Against
UCLA, we played well, and it was a very even
ly matched game.They scored a great goal and
that was the difference. Today's game, we
showed great character to come back from that
loss, scored three nice goals and it was a great
result."
The team still has a chance for the confer
ence title, but UCLA would have to slip up in
its final two conference games against the Ore
gon schools this weekend. ITie Cardinal has
one final conference match — next Saturday
against California — before the NCAA Tour
nament begins. The match is scheduled for a 2
p.m. start at Berkeley's Edwards Stadium.
