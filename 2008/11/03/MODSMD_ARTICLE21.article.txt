## Water polo scores 20th win of season 
### KENAN JIANG STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men's water polo team
defeated two very solid opponents over the
weekend with wins over UC-Davis, IJC-Irvine
and Santa Clara. Stanford is now an impressive
20-2 on the season.
The games against Davis and Irvine also
were Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) games, making them all the more cru
cial for the Cardinal's postseason hopes.
With the NCAA championships coming up in
less than a month, the Cardinal will seek to ex
tend its perfect MPSF record in games against
Pepperdine this Saturday, UC-Santa Barbara
on Sunday. USC on Nov. 1 1 and California on
Nov. 22.The top MPSF records will be entered
into the four berths available in the NCAA
Tournament, while the other two spots are re
served for wild-card teams.
Last year, the Cardinal finished third to
California and USC in MPSF and was not se
lected for the wild card. Stanford will need to
solidly put away its upcoming MPSF oppo
nents such as Pepperdine and UCSB while
playing tough against perennial contenders
California and USC to clinch a spot in the
tournament.

While the Trojans are ranked No. 1 in the
nation. California has been the best team for
the past two years overall, evidenced by their
two national titles in those years. Stanford beat
the No. 3 Bears this year in a triple-overtime,
11-10 thriller back in September at the NorCal
Tournament.
USC has been much tougher on Stanford,
however, and has handed the Cardinal both of
its two losses on the season.The first loss was
10-3 at the NorCalTournament semifinals,and
the second loss was a double-overtime, K-7
heartbreaker at the SoCal Tournament.
Last Thursday against No. 11 UC-Davis,
Stanford won comfortably with a 12-4 victory
and once again showed its offensive depth by
boasting eight different goal scorers, capped
off by senior Andrew Drake's three-goal per
formance.
Along with Drake's three goals, juniors
Janson Wigo and Sage Wright each added a
pair. Senior Will Hindle-Katel, sophomore
Alex Pulido, sophomore Jeffrey Schwimer,
freshman Peter Sefton and freshman Jacob
Smith each added one goal apiece.
Stanford's offense found the net consistent
ly throughout the contest, notching three goals
in the opening period. But Davis hung around,
putting up a pair of scores over the first eight

minutes to stay within striking range. Thanks to
a mid-tank steal by Smith and the ensuing
counterattack goal with 10 seconds left in the
opening period. Stanford held a slim, 3-2 lead.
The second and third periods would follow
a script that the Cardinal defense has been
polishing every week. While the offense kept
up the scoring, with three more goals in the
second period and four more in the third, the
defense tightened up and limited the Aggies to
just one goal in each of the next two periods.
Despite Aggie goalkeeper Kevin Peat's 14
saves, the Stanford offense was just too much
for Davis.
Against IJC -Irvine on Saturday, the defen
sive story would he the same.The Cardinal held
the Anteaters scoreless for the first IS minutes
as it climbed out to a 10-0 lead at Avery Aquat
ic Center. Junior goalkeeper Jimmie Sandman
again showed his confidence in the net by stop
ping 10 shots. My the time Irvine scored its first
goal with 1:48 left in the third period, the game
was already well in Stanford's hands.
"The team continued to play great water
polo," Wright said. "Recently, everyone has
been able to focus on the game at hand and let
all other distractions go. Our approach to the
UCI game enabled us to come out strong and
win the game in the first half."
