# Scouting the free market

### 
Unless you're a Phillies fan,
this year's playoffs was prob
ably a ho-hum viewing expe
rience. For the 22 teams left out of
the postseason (i.e. the Yankees and
Co.). it was probably boring. For
those falling in the thick of the chase
(i.e. any team but the Phillies), it was
heartbreaking to say the least. And
for pure fans of the game, it simply
was just too short, with only one se
ries going the distance.
So to the Phillies, congratulations
— you played one heck of an Octo
ber. With so many subplots behind
their run to the championship, it
would have been a shame to see any
one else win.
Now with the annual general
managers' meetings in Dana Point.
Calif., the offseason is officially upon
us. With the likes of CC Sabathia,
Mark Teixeira and Manny Ramirez
on the market, it's bound to be one of
the most exciting postseason races
until the 2010 summer (for all you
basketball fans). Here's a look at
where the "Big Three" will probably
end up next season:
CC Sabathia
Favorite: New York Yankees. It's
no secret that the Yankees have
deep, deep pockets. And you can be
sure that after a third-place finish
last season. Steinbrenner and Co.
won't settle for anything but the best.
As we saw this postseason, it's pitch
ing that wins championships. After
missing out on Johan Santana last
season, the Yankees will not make
the same mistake again with
Sabathia, or it's ( ashman's head.
Dark horse: Los Angeles Angels.
If the Angels lose out on Teixeira. ex
pect them to make it rain for
Sabathia. And unfortunately, this
may be the worst mistake they make
this offseason — that is. unless they
sign Frankie Rodriguez to a huge
contract. Before Sabathia owned the
National League,he was just another
good pitcher in the AL as part of the
Indians' staff. If he had any concern
whatsoever for his career, he'd stay
in the NL and dominate.
Mark Teixeira (tie)
Favorite No. la: New York Yan
kees. Again: deep, deep pockets. Ilie
Yanks are losing Giambi this offsea
son. and who better to replace him
with than Teixeira. Teixeira is worth
every penny of his contract, and New
York has the means to offer him the
most money. With the new stadium
also opening, it looks to be a case of
the rich getting much richer.
Favorite No. lb: Los Angeles An
gels. ITie Angels need Teixeira more
than any other team. After giving up
promising first baseman Casey
Kotchman and failing to deliver a
World Series title, losing out on Teix
eira would cripple the franchise. And
if they miss out on Teixeira, expect
ace John Lackey and others to start
looking for teams that can win in the
postseason. The Angels must resign
Teixeira — almost at any cost.
Dark horse: Baltimore Orioles.
Teixeira may be the local favorite,
but with his talent, there's no home
town discount here.
Manny Ramirez
Favorite: Los Angeles Dodgers.
Manny transformed the Dodgers
into playoff contenders. Without his
presence in the lineup, the Dodgers
would never have even sniffed the
postseason, much less swept the
Cubs. The fans at Chavez Ravine
adore him. and if management were
to let Ramirez go. they would never
hear the end of it.The Dodgers have
to dig deep into their pockets and try
to bring back Manny if they want any
respectability for the next few years.
Dark horse: New York Yankees.
My apologies again. It may seem re
dundant, but if the Yankees are
smart, they'll make a run for all of the
Big ITiree.and look for them to dom
inate for years to come if it happens.
After being ostracized by the Red
Sox, Manny has a personal vendetta
against his former employers. By
signing with the Yankees, he can
pound on the Sox for nearly 20

games a season, and after seeing
what he did in the postseason, the
Sox and Rays are in big trouble.
The Yanks have the money, the
schedule and the venue for a
superstar like Mannv.
As you can see. I'm betting the
Yankees will look to dominate the
offseason with huge contracts and
incredible leverage with the new
Yankee Stadium. Though the rich

may get richer, not all is lost for
the other 2V teams in MLB. In the
past few years, it is not the highest
payrolls that have produced world
champions; rather it is the cama
raderie and cohesion of a well
run. well-managed team (i.e. the
Phillies. Red Sox, Marlins, etc.).
And. if Stanford football can
come within one win of a howl
berth, let's face it: anything's possi
ble.

Anthony Nguyen still has his niintl on
baseball in November. And if you
agree with him, so does Hank
Steinbrenner. Email Anthony at
