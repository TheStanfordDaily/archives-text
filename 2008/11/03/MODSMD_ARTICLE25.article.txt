# Stanford set for stretch run to season
## 
### DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
There were a few questions looming in the
minds of Stanford fans before Saturday's game
against Washington State. Would Stanford be able
to come off the bye week looking sharp? Would
Stanford take the Cougars too lightly and get
caught looking ahead to Oregon? What effect
would the weather have on the game? Would Stan
ford cover the 30-point spread?
The questioners must have felt sillv after the
final whistle blew on Saturday, because it wound up
being of the most lopsided victories in Stanford
football history.
It was hard to tell what was worse, the weather
or the Washington State defense. It's tough to say
for certain, but some random fans in the stands
might have been able to score on the Cougars on
Saturday. Stanford rolled to its fifth win of the sea
son in convincing fashion — it was the largest mar
gin of victory for the program in 59 years.
Junior Toby Gerhart supplemented his spectac
ular season with four touchdowns in the first half,
finishing with 22 carries for 132 yards.The lightning
to Gerhart's thunder, senior Anthony Kimble
added a 62-yard touchdown run.and redshirt soph
omore quarterback Alex Loukas had a 17-yard
touchdown run via a quarterback draw. Even fresh
man Delano Howell joined in on the fun. scoring
Stanford's seventh rushing touchdown of the
game. It was 51-0 with 3:50 left... in the third quar
ter.
The Cardinal gained 344 yards on the ground.
6.3 yards per carry and 6.7 yards per offensive play.
'Hie defense allowed just 225 total yards and only
152 in the air. combined with four sacks and two in
terceptions. But this was Washington State after all.
The Cougars are making Stanford's 1-11 campaign
a few years back look like a Pac-10 championship
caliber team.
But regardless of how the win was captured.
Stanford is now 5-4 and just one win away from
bowl eligibility. Stanford came out with the win.
and whenever that happens, the players and coach
es did things right. Perhaps this wasn't the most ex
citing victory, but it allowed Stanford to move one
step closer to its postseason goals by playing a great
game.
Additionally, this game shone more light on
Gerhart's tremendous season, giving yet another
indication that the junior two-sport athlete de
serves all the recognition he gets. He is only one of
five Stanford running backs in history to score four
touchdowns in a game; his fourth score against the
Cougars was his 12th of the season and he is now in
third place on the all-time single-season rushing
touchdown list. He also sits at eighth all-time on the
single-season rushing yards list, with 911 through
nine games.
The win also gave the Cardinal confidence mov
ing into the home stretch. On Saturday, the team
was aggressive, patient and consistent. With Ore
gon. USC and Cal coming up. Stanford needs to
keep up those attributes and believe in themselves
as team. A confident Stanford team is a good Stan
ford team.
"The next three games are going to be tough for
us." said senior safety Bo McNally. who notched
one of the Cardinal's interceptions on Saturday.
"We'll probably be underdogs in all of those, but
we like that. It's always nice to come out and be un
derestimated. because we know what we can do."
But what will be Stanford's approach to the next
three games? On Saturday, the quarterbacks —
junior Tavita Pritchard. Loukas and junior Jason

Forcier — attempted a combined 13 passes. And
it's certainly great to be able to win a game like
that, letting the defense and running game control
the field: but realistically, the quarterbacks are
going to have to be relied upon a bit more if Stan
ford is going to keep on winning.The upcoming de
fenses might not concede ground quite so easily to
Gerhart and Kimble, so it's up to the passing game
to step up.
We saw against UCLA that the ground game
alone cannot carry the team. Head coach Jim Har
baugh acknowledged time spent on passing during
the bye week, with good reason.The running game
will be there as long as everyone is healthy.'flic de
fense knows what it has to do to stop those high-fly
ing offenses.That leaves the quarterback play to be
a huge component in the team's success from here
on out.
But as we saw last year against USC and Cal.

and this year against Washington and San Jose
State, Stanford's quarterback play can be a true
positive for the team. It is just a matter of execu
tion, and Harbaugh, a former 08. will surely be
preparing his team to do just that the rest of the
way.
Now is the most pivotal point of the season for
Stanford.The Cardinal has five wins, but it faces its
toughest three-game stretch of the year. Winning
just one will all but assure Stanford going to its first
postseason bowl since 2001—something both
players and fans have been looking forward to for
a long time.
"We're still in it," I iarbaugh said after the game.
"All of our goals are still out there in front of us."
Just one more step forward and they'll be with
in reach.

It's safe to say that if you're a Washington State fan right now, you're just
praying for the season to end.

Senior running back Anthony Kimble runs through a massive hole during the Cardinal's 58-0 thrashing of Washington State on Saturday. Kimble had 92 yards on just five carries, scoring on a 62-yard touchdown in the third quarter.
There were a few questions looming in the
minds of Stanford fans before Saturday's game
against Washington State. Would Stanford be able
to come off the bye week looking sharp? Would
Stanford take the Cougars too lightly and get
caught looking ahead to Oregon? What effect
would the weather have on the game? Would Stan
ford cover the 30-point spread?
The questioners must have felt sillv after the
final whistle blew on Saturday, because it wound up
being of the most lopsided victories in Stanford
football history.
It was hard to tell what was worse, the weather
or the Washington State defense. It's tough to say
for certain, but some random fans in the stands
might have been able to score on the Cougars on
Saturday. Stanford rolled to its fifth win of the sea
son in convincing fashion — it was the largest mar
gin of victory for the program in 59 years.
Junior Toby Gerhart supplemented his spectac
ular season with four touchdowns in the first half,
finishing with 22 carries for 132 yards.The lightning
to Gerhart's thunder, senior Anthony Kimble
added a 62-yard touchdown run.and redshirt soph
omore quarterback Alex Loukas had a 17-yard
touchdown run via a quarterback draw. Even fresh
man Delano Howell joined in on the fun. scoring
Stanford's seventh rushing touchdown of the
game. It was 51-0 with 3:50 left... in the third quar
ter.
The Cardinal gained 344 yards on the ground.
6.3 yards per carry and 6.7 yards per offensive play.
'Hie defense allowed just 225 total yards and only
152 in the air. combined with four sacks and two in
terceptions. But this was Washington State after all.
The Cougars are making Stanford's 1-11 campaign
a few years back look like a Pac-10 championship
caliber team.
But regardless of how the win was captured.
Stanford is now 5-4 and just one win away from
bowl eligibility. Stanford came out with the win.
and whenever that happens, the players and coach
es did things right. Perhaps this wasn't the most ex
citing victory, but it allowed Stanford to move one
step closer to its postseason goals by playing a great
game.
Additionally, this game shone more light on
Gerhart's tremendous season, giving yet another
indication that the junior two-sport athlete de
serves all the recognition he gets. He is only one of
five Stanford running backs in history to score four
touchdowns in a game; his fourth score against the
Cougars was his 12th of the season and he is now in
third place on the all-time single-season rushing
touchdown list. He also sits at eighth all-time on the
single-season rushing yards list, with 911 through
nine games.
The win also gave the Cardinal confidence mov
ing into the home stretch. On Saturday, the team
was aggressive, patient and consistent. With Ore
gon. USC and Cal coming up. Stanford needs to
keep up those attributes and believe in themselves
as team. A confident Stanford team is a good Stan
ford team.
"The next three games are going to be tough for
us." said senior safety Bo McNally. who notched
one of the Cardinal's interceptions on Saturday.
"We'll probably be underdogs in all of those, but
we like that. It's always nice to come out and be un
derestimated. because we know what we can do."
But what will be Stanford's approach to the next
three games? On Saturday, the quarterbacks —
junior Tavita Pritchard. Loukas and junior Jason

Forcier — attempted a combined 13 passes. And
it's certainly great to be able to win a game like
that, letting the defense and running game control
the field: but realistically, the quarterbacks are
going to have to be relied upon a bit more if Stan
ford is going to keep on winning.The upcoming de
fenses might not concede ground quite so easily to
Gerhart and Kimble, so it's up to the passing game
to step up.
We saw against UCLA that the ground game
alone cannot carry the team. Head coach Jim Har
baugh acknowledged time spent on passing during
the bye week, with good reason.The running game
will be there as long as everyone is healthy.'flic de
fense knows what it has to do to stop those high-fly
ing offenses.That leaves the quarterback play to be
a huge component in the team's success from here
on out.
But as we saw last year against USC and Cal.

and this year against Washington and San Jose
State, Stanford's quarterback play can be a true
positive for the team. It is just a matter of execu
tion, and Harbaugh, a former 08. will surely be
preparing his team to do just that the rest of the
way.
Now is the most pivotal point of the season for
Stanford.The Cardinal has five wins, but it faces its
toughest three-game stretch of the year. Winning
just one will all but assure Stanford going to its first
postseason bowl since 2001—something both
players and fans have been looking forward to for
a long time.
"We're still in it," I iarbaugh said after the game.
"All of our goals are still out there in front of us."
Just one more step forward and they'll be with
in reach.
