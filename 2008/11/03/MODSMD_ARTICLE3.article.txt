# Police chief apologizes
## Palo Alto Chief denies racial profiling after recent city robberies 
### DEVIN BANERJEE MANAGING EDITOR 
Palo Alto Police Chief Lynne Johnson
issued a statement Friday clarifying earlier
comments she made that appeared to con
done racial profiling by her police officers.
Johnson's original statements were made
Thursday at a town hall meeting held to dis
cuss the recent trend in crime that has
plagued the Caltrain. downtown and
California Avenue areas. KGO-TV. a local
ABC station, immediately pounced at the
police chiefs words, which seemed to indi
cate that Johnson ordered officers to ques
tion African Americans "to find out who
they are."
"We do not want to create an environ
ment of fear of people of color in this com
munity — absolutely not — but on the other
hand, we have to do due diligence in trying to
apprehend the suspects that are doing this,"
Johnson said at Thursday's meeting. "When
our officers are out there and they see an
African American, in a congenial way. we
want them to find out who they are."
Johnson also came under fire for com

merits regarding suspects at the Caltrain sta
tion.
"The one suspect around the California
Avenue train station is wearing a do-rag."
Johnson said in an interview broadcast by
KGO-TV. 'if my officers see an African
American who has a do-rag on his head,
absolutely the officers will be stopping and
trying to find out who that person is."
The police chief issued a statement on
F : riday apologizing for any offensive com
ments and emphasizing that some of her
statements have been misconstrued. She said
her officers will not stop anyone just because
he or she is African-American.
"Officers will be judicious and will detain
people based solely upon the totality of the
circumstances and an articulable set of facts
that ties the person to criminal activity."
Johnson said.
Agent Dan Ryan of Johnson's depart
ment told The Daily on Saturday that an offi
cer will only stop a suspect if that suspect
matches a description given to the depart
ment.
"If we see someone acting suspiciously in
the same area where the robberies have

occurred, then we would expect our officers
to contact that person," Rvan said.
"|JohnsonJ made an unfortunate state
ment. and it was taken out of context," he
added.
Palo Alto Mayor Larry Klein told The
Daily yesterday that he is "concerned" about
the police chiefs comments, although he
admitted he had not yet thoroughly reviewed
her follow-up statement.
"The problem is the difference between
stopping any African-American male, which
is clearly against the Constitution, and stop
ping suspects of whom we have a specific
description." the mayor said. "I found her
statements to be unacceptable, unconstitu
tional and un-American."
Still. Klein said he believes officers do not
racially profile suspects and only approach
those whose descriptions are given to offi
cers.
In her Friday statement. Johnson
acknowledged that racial profiling "is uncon
stitutional. immoral, violates department
policy and is contradictory to our
department values."
"I do not condone or allow such
conduct," she added.
According to KTVU. a Bay Area
news source. Johnson spent "several
hours" at the Jerusalem Baptist
Church on Sunday afternoon, apolo
gizing to about 60 church-goers who
were predominantly African
American. She also listened to con
cerns relating to treatment by mem
bers of her police force.
Hie mayor noted that he does not
— and cannot — have any say in the
status of the police chiefs position.
That is reserved for City Manager
James Keene, who met with Johnson
Friday morning and issued his own

statement later that day.
"From my meeting with the chief
and department senior staff, it is
clear that the Palo Alto Police
Department does not practice racial
profiling nor would it tolerate racial
profiling," Keene said.
Keene also noted that he was
"impressed with the command staffs
sensitivity to matters of racial, ethnic
and cultural differences."
The Palo Alto Police Department
works closely with Stanford's
Department of Public Safety, accord
ing to Ryan. The two departments
share information on a common
radio frequency.
"We work hand in hand with
them," Ryan said. "We have a very
good relationship with the depart
ment and the entire campus commu
nity."
