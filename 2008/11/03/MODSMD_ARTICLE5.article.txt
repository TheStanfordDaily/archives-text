# ELECTION '08
## Classes held on Election Day, despite criticism 
### FATIMA WAGDY 
Election Day is right around the corner
â€” an historic day that happens only once
every four years. On such a day, some stu
dents ask: Should they even have class at
all? The response from professors, appar
ently, has been an overwhelming. "Yes, you
should."
At Stanford, no specific policy exists that
dictates whether or not class should he held
on Election Day. Many students and profes

sors agree that there is no need to cancel class
next Tuesday, but other students feel that
class should be canceled and that Election
Day should be a national holiday.
Some believe canceling class would be
unnecessary because of the demographics of
Stanford students. Most Stanford students do
not live close to their voting districts and
would therefore have to vote absentee even if
they lived in California. Many other students
live out of state, so they would have to vote
absentee anyway.

"I'm not inclined to cancel classes on
Election Day.and in fact 1 am not doing so for
the classes I teach," said Political Science
Prof. Rob Reich. "Adult citi/ens are not
excused from the workplace to vote. And
many students will vote by absentee ballot
here, so the number of affected students is
smaller than would be true if everyone were a
California resident."
Brennan Saeta '12 said it would be point
less to cancel class.
"What else would we do during election

day?" he asked. "Sit around and watch the
talking heads repeat over and over the same
drivel they've heen spewing for the last
month? If students need to ditch class to
make it to vote, then ditch class."
Other students thought having class on the
day of the election is actually beneficial.
"Depending on the class, it can provide an
informal forum for students to discuss their
predictions for the election and the next four
years in general," said Sarah De La
Garza "12.
On the other hand, some stu
dents felt that citizens nationwide
should not have to work or go to
class on Election Day. These stu
dents mentioned the fact that other
countries like Mexico make
Election Day a national holiday.
"I definitely think Election Day
should be a national holiday." said
Nica Lunginger" 12. "It seems rather
out of line with democracy to make
people have to choose between vot
ing and working or attending class.
Some people simply can't make that
kind of sacrifice and thus are denied
their right to a political voice."
Llsewhere in America, schools

such as Alverno College, University
of Southern Maine and Liberty
University have canceled classes for
Election Day this year in order to
promote voting.
But at Stanford, most classes will
still be held. 1 lowever, many evening
activities have been postponed or
canceled so that students and staff
alike may watch the election returns.
Attendance for evening activities
and classes on Election Day has
been low in the past, according to
Cireg Watkins, lecturer in Structured
Liberal Education (SLE).
"We had a lecture on The
Republic' four years ago in the
evening [on Election Day], and it
didn't go well." Watkins said. "It
gets hard for people to pay atten
tion when something so dramatic is
happening."
