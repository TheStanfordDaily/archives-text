# ELECTION '08
## Classes held on Election Day, despite criticism 
### FATIMA WAGDY 
Election Day is right around the corner
â€” an historic day that happens only once
every four years. On such a day, some stu
dents ask: Should they even have class at
all? The response from professors, appar

should."
At Stanford, no specific policy exists that
dictates whether or not class should he held

excused from the workplace to vote. And
many students will vote by absentee ballot
here, so the number of affected students is
smaller than would be true if everyone were a
California resident."
Brennan Saeta '12 said it would be point

talking heads repeat over and over the same
drivel they've heen spewing for the last
month? If students need to ditch class to
make it to vote, then ditch class."
Other students thought having class on the
day of the election is actually beneficial.
"Depending on the class, it can provide an
informal forum for students to discuss their
predictions for the election and the next four
