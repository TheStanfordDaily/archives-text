# STANFORD 58 WASHINGTON STATE O
## CARD CRUSHES COUGS Stanford now one win away from bowl eligibility 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
Domination doesn't begin to describe it. so per
haps some historical context will.
Stanford's 58-0 win over Washington State was the
fifth-largest win in school history. It was the first time
the Cardinal shutout a Pacific-10 Conference oppo
nent since the Ford administration, and the largest
victory over a conference foe since World War 11.
"This was a big win," senior center Alex Fletcher
said.
Indeed it was: The game may as well have been
over the first time junior running back Toby Gerhart
touched the ball. Gerhart ran for 132 yards and four
touchdowns (the latter matching the Cardinal's sin
gle-game record) in essentially only two quarters of
work to lead a Stanford offense that found the end
zone eight times.
In a driving rain that exerted a significant inilu
ence on the game — from dropped balls to poor foot
ing— the Cardinal offense relied almost entirely on
the running game. Senior Anthony Kimble, whose 62-
yard touchdown run in the third quarter was
Stanford's longest play from scrimmage, and fresh
man Delano Howell, who had a career-high 40 yards

and scored his first collegiate touchdown, comple
mented Gerhart on the ground.
Sophomore quarterback Alex Loukas, who was
substituted for starter Tavita Pritchard for the second
straight game, contributed 60 yards rushing as well,
and had the longest pass play from scrimmage: a 41-
yard bomb to freshman Chris Owusu. By the end of
ihe contest, fourth-string quarterback Nicolas Ruhl

and fifth-string running back Blaise Johnson were
carrying the load for the Cardinal — and the Stanford
offense was still relatively successful.
"We play the same way no matter what — hustle,
all out," said Stanford head coach Jim Harbaugh.

Junior running back Toby Gerhart tied a school record with four touchdowns. Gerhart rushed for 1 32 yards,
while the Cardinal went for 344 yards rushing as a team.
The offense was unrelenting, but
the story of the game was the Cardi
nal defense, which shut down Wash
ington State's attack all day. The
Cougars were able to move the ball
on their first possession before being
forced to punt, and began their sec
ond drive with good field position
after a nice kick-off return by Chant/.
Staden. But then Stanford set a tone
that would continue throughout the
day: on third down, redshirt junior
safety Bo McNally intercepted a
Kevin Lopina pass and took it 31
yards into WSIJ territory. Gerhart
scored five plays later to give the Car
dinal a 10-0 advantage, and the rout
was on.
The Cougars only threatened to
score twice, and failed both times. In
the first quarter,Nico Grasu had a 28-
yard field goal attempt blocked by
senior Pannel Egboh.and with under
a minute left in the half. Lopina was
intercepted in the end /one by fresh
man Michael Thomas.
"Our turnovers once again en
abled the onslaught," WSIJ coach
Paul Wulff said.
The Cougars turned the ball over
five times, and Stanford, despite the
weather conditions, never gave the
ball up once.The Cardinal had strug
gled with turnovers all year and was
relieved to play error-free football.
"The offense made a promise to
the defense earlier in the week that
we weren't going to turn the ball
over," Gerhart said. "We've beaten
ourselves at times and wanted to give
the defense confidence that they
could trust us to hold on to the ball
and not put them in bad spots with
turnovers."
The defense returned the favor by
preventing the Cougars from estab
lishing any sort of rhythm. In addition
to the turnovers, the Cardinal sacked
Lopina and J.T. Levenseller four
times and had nine tackles for a loss
— redshirt freshman Tom Keiser led
the way with three tackles for loss and
two sacks. Stanford's secondary,
which has had an up-and-down year,
was excellent, shutting down WSU's
star wide receiver Brandon Gibson.

who gained only 64 yards and
dropped a number of passes.
The Cougars' hest production
came from Staden. their kick and punt
returner, who gave Washington State
good field position throughout the
first half. But even Staden's produc
tion was eventually rendered moot by
the Stanford special teams unit, which
forced a fumble on a punt late in the
fourth quarter. It was the last chance
for the Cougars to regain any sort of
offensive respectability but. as they
had throughout the game, they failed
to do so.
The Cardinal's true tests now
begin, and its bowl hopes lie in the bal
ance. Stanford needs only one win to
become bowl eligible,but they'll have
to pick it up against three of the Pac
10's best teams. First, the Cardinal will
hit the road to face Oregon, the only
team in the conference that possesses
a better running game than Stanford.
'Ilien, it's back to the Farm for a
match-up with USC, which, since los
ing to Oregon State last month, has
shut out three of five opponents. It is
entirely possible that the Cardinal's
final contest against Cal will be an
even larger Big Game — Stanford
could enter Berkeley still seeking that
elusive sixth win, and the 6-2 Golden
Bears are no pushovers.
"The next three games are going to
be tough for us." McNally said. "We'll
probably be underdogs in all of those,
but we like that. It's always nice to
come out and be underestimated, be
cause we know what we can do."
The Washington State game was
one of Stanford's most impressive vic
tories ever. But the team cannot rest
— the stretch run begins now.
Game Notes: Safety Scan Wiser led
Stanford with eight tackles ... The
Cardinal did not emerge unscathed:
fullback Owen Marecic, linebacker

kick returner Jeremy Stewart all left

even larger Big Game — Stanford
could enter Berkeley still seeking that
elusive sixth win, and the 6-2 Golden
Bears are no pushovers.

Domination doesn't begin to describe it. so per
haps some historical context will.
Stanford's 58-0 win over Washington State was the
fifth-largest win in school history. It was the first time
the Cardinal shutout a Pacific-10 Conference oppo
nent since the Ford administration, and the largest
victory over a conference foe since World War 11.
"This was a big win," senior center Alex Fletcher
said.
Indeed it was: The game may as well have been
over the first time junior running back Toby Gerhart
touched the ball. Gerhart ran for 132 yards and four
touchdowns (the latter matching the Cardinal's sin
gle-game record) in essentially only two quarters of
work to lead a Stanford offense that found the end
zone eight times.
In a driving rain that exerted a significant inilu
ence on the game — from dropped balls to poor foot
ing— the Cardinal offense relied almost entirely on
the running game. Senior Anthony Kimble, whose 62-
yard touchdown run in the third quarter was
Stanford's longest play from scrimmage, and fresh
man Delano Howell, who had a career-high 40 yards

and scored his first collegiate touchdown, comple
mented Gerhart on the ground.
Sophomore quarterback Alex Loukas, who was
substituted for starter Tavita Pritchard for the second
straight game, contributed 60 yards rushing as well,
and had the longest pass play from scrimmage: a 41-
yard bomb to freshman Chris Owusu. By the end of
ihe contest, fourth-string quarterback Nicolas Ruhl

and fifth-string running back Blaise Johnson were
carrying the load for the Cardinal — and the Stanford
offense was still relatively successful.
"We play the same way no matter what — hustle,
all out," said Stanford head coach Jim Harbaugh.


AGUSTIN RAMIREZ/The Stanford Daily
Junior running back Toby Gerhart tied a school record with four touchdowns. Gerhart rushed for 1 32 yards,
while the Cardinal went for 344 yards rushing as a team.
The offense was unrelenting, but
the story of the game was the Cardi
nal defense, which shut down Wash
ington State's attack all day. The
Cougars were able to move the ball
on their first possession before being
forced to punt, and began their sec
ond drive with good field position
after a nice kick-off return by Chant/.
Staden. But then Stanford set a tone
that would continue throughout the
day: on third down, redshirt junior
safety Bo McNally intercepted a
Kevin Lopina pass and took it 31
yards into WSIJ territory. Gerhart
scored five plays later to give the Car
dinal a 10-0 advantage, and the rout
was on.
The Cougars only threatened to
score twice, and failed both times. In
the first quarter,Nico Grasu had a 28-
yard field goal attempt blocked by
senior Pannel Egboh.and with under
a minute left in the half. Lopina was
intercepted in the end /one by fresh
man Michael Thomas.
"Our turnovers once again en
abled the onslaught," WSIJ coach
Paul Wulff said.
The Cougars turned the ball over
five times, and Stanford, despite the
weather conditions, never gave the
ball up once.The Cardinal had strug
gled with turnovers all year and was
relieved to play error-free football.
"The offense made a promise to
the defense earlier in the week that
we weren't going to turn the ball
over," Gerhart said. "We've beaten
ourselves at times and wanted to give
the defense confidence that they
could trust us to hold on to the ball
and not put them in bad spots with
turnovers."
The defense returned the favor by
preventing the Cougars from estab
lishing any sort of rhythm. In addition
to the turnovers, the Cardinal sacked
Lopina and J.T. Levenseller four
times and had nine tackles for a loss
— redshirt freshman Tom Keiser led
the way with three tackles for loss and
two sacks. Stanford's secondary,
which has had an up-and-down year,
was excellent, shutting down WSU's
star wide receiver Brandon Gibson.

who gained only 64 yards and
dropped a number of passes.
The Cougars' hest production
came from Staden. their kick and punt
returner, who gave Washington State
good field position throughout the
first half. But even Staden's produc
tion was eventually rendered moot by
the Stanford special teams unit, which
forced a fumble on a punt late in the
fourth quarter. It was the last chance
for the Cougars to regain any sort of
offensive respectability but. as they
had throughout the game, they failed
to do so.
The Cardinal's true tests now
begin, and its bowl hopes lie in the bal
ance. Stanford needs only one win to
become bowl eligible,but they'll have
to pick it up against three of the Pac
10's best teams. First, the Cardinal will
hit the road to face Oregon, the only
team in the conference that possesses
a better running game than Stanford.
'Ilien, it's back to the Farm for a
match-up with USC, which, since los
ing to Oregon State last month, has
shut out three of five opponents. It is
entirely possible that the Cardinal's
final contest against Cal will be an
even larger Big Game — Stanford
could enter Berkeley still seeking that
elusive sixth win, and the 6-2 Golden
Bears are no pushovers.
"The next three games are going to
be tough for us." McNally said. "We'll
probably be underdogs in all of those,

come out and be underestimated, be
cause we know what we can do."
