## CARD CRUSHES COUGS Stanford now one win away from bowl eligibility

Domination doesn't begin to describe it. so per
haps some historical context will.
Stanford's 58-0 win over Washington State was the
fifth-largest win in school history. It was the first time
the Cardinal shutout a Pacific-10 Conference oppo
nent since the Ford administration, and the largest
victory over a conference foe since World War 11.
"This was a big win," senior center Alex Fletcher
said.
Indeed it was: The game may as well have been
over the first time junior running back Toby Gerhart
touched the ball. Gerhart ran for 132 yards and four
touchdowns (the latter matching the Cardinal's sin
gle-game record) in essentially only two quarters of
work to lead a Stanford offense that found the end
zone eight times.
In a driving rain that exerted a significant inilu
ence on the game — from dropped balls to poor foot
ing— the Cardinal offense relied almost entirely on
the running game. Senior Anthony Kimble, whose 62-
yard touchdown run in the third quarter was
Stanford's longest play from scrimmage, and fresh
man Delano Howell, who had a career-high 40 yards

and scored his first collegiate touchdown, comple
mented Gerhart on the ground.
Sophomore quarterback Alex Loukas, who was
substituted for starter Tavita Pritchard for the second
straight game, contributed 60 yards rushing as well,
and had the longest pass play from scrimmage: a 41-
yard bomb to freshman Chris Owusu. By the end of
ihe contest, fourth-string quarterback Nicolas Ruhl

and fifth-string running back Blaise Johnson were
carrying the load for the Cardinal — and the Stanford
offense was still relatively successful.
"We play the same way no matter what — hustle,
all out," said Stanford head coach Jim Harbaugh.
