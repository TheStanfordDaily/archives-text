## LIFE OF THE PARTY STUDENT FORCED TO HAUNT OLD UNION, NOT MAUSOLEUM 
### JAMES HOHMANN ALEXAMERZ 
A fight broke out Friday night in Old Union. Two
Trojan soldiers in gladiator sandals, red capes and
warrior hats attacked Will Lee '12 with plastic
swords. The motive for the playful brawl? Lee
guessed it was because they showed up wearing
the same costumes.
"I didn't have a sword so I couldn't protect myself."said Lee.
who had come to Old Union in an outfit inspired by the
Spartans in the movie "300."
The freshman had a spear but a drunken friend in Branner
broke it before the party, leaving him defenseless.
You can't have a Mausoleum Party without a mausoleum.
But a forecast for rain prompted organizers to announce last
Tuesday that the event normally held at the crypt where the
LJniversitv's founders are interred would relocate to Old
Union. It was the first party of its kind at the student center
since its remodeling last year.
The furniture was removed from study spaces. Yellow cau
tion tape was draped above the building's facade. Two dozen
stvrofoam tombstones were staked into the grassy courtyard.
Free Red Bulls, glow sticks and condoms were available near
the bathrooms.
Turnout was modest. Old Union wasn't deserted, but it was
n't popping at the seams either. A rival Synergy party seemed
to draw much of the upperclassmen cohort, and many of those
present were freshmen. No reliable attendance estimate was
available since students filtered through over four hours.
"Given the weather conditions, we worked as hard as we
could to put together a party that I think most people enjoyed
very much." said organizer Risha Bera '10. junior class co
president.
