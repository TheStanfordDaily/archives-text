## LIFE OF THE PARTY STUDENT FORCED TO HAUNT OLD UNION, NOT MAUSOLEUM 
### JAMES HOHMANN ALEXAMERZ 
A fight broke out Friday night in Old Union. Two
Trojan soldiers in gladiator sandals, red capes and
warrior hats attacked Will Lee '12 with plastic
swords. The motive for the playful brawl? Lee
guessed it was because they showed up wearing
the same costumes.
"I didn't have a sword so I couldn't protect myself."said Lee.
who had come to Old Union in an outfit inspired by the
Spartans in the movie "300."
The freshman had a spear but a drunken friend in Branner
broke it before the party, leaving him defenseless.
You can't have a Mausoleum Party without a mausoleum.
But a forecast for rain prompted organizers to announce last
Tuesday that the event normally held at the crypt where the
LJniversitv's founders are interred would relocate to Old
Union. It was the first party of its kind at the student center
since its remodeling last year.
The furniture was removed from study spaces. Yellow cau
tion tape was draped above the building's facade. Two dozen
stvrofoam tombstones were staked into the grassy courtyard.
Free Red Bulls, glow sticks and condoms were available near
the bathrooms.
Turnout was modest. Old Union wasn't deserted, but it was
n't popping at the seams either. A rival Synergy party seemed
to draw much of the upperclassmen cohort, and many of those
present were freshmen. No reliable attendance estimate was
available since students filtered through over four hours.
"Given the weather conditions, we worked as hard as we
could to put together a party that I think most people enjoyed
very much." said organizer Risha Bera '10. junior class co
president.
The lights above the dance floor
were uncomfortably bright, she said,
because of all the emergency lighting
in Old Union. They tried to put col
ored sheets over as many as they
could.
Instead of dancing, many stood
around and talked or snapped pic
tures of costumes with their camera
phones. The normally antiseptic
smell of the student union was re
placed by the odors of sweat, body
paint and polyester.
A Santa Clara County Sheriffs
deputy and two Stanford police offi
cers paced the dance floor's perime
ter. A few feet away from the cops, a
group of students passed around a
bottle of vodka disguised as water.
Many took advantage of the occa
sion to wear as little as possible.
Leggy barmaids abounded. Metallic,
skin-tight leggings from American
Apparel seemed the item of the
night. Others wore miniskirts that re
vealed more than most underwear
would.
A group of girls cut holes in the
bottom of their mesh laundry bas
kets, stepped into them.and filled the
empty space with brassieres.
One guy came as a singer of "Dick
in a Box" — a play on Justin Timber
lake's now classic "Saturday Night
Live" skit. Walking in to find a
crowded dance floor, he removed the
box tied around his waist, set it in a
corner and stripped down to his
moose print pajama pants. He flexed
his biceps, approached a group of
girls and began grinding to Nelly
Furtado's "Promiscuous."
If grades were given for costumes,
some would get extra credit for cre
ativity. A "Chick Magnet" wore a
cardboard U-shaped magnet with
pictures of baby chickens attached.
When a girl came in as a human-size
TI-89 graphing calculator, a boy
pushed her buttons. Just then, a trio
of cardboard iPods began snaking
through the crowd, dancing to the
music.
Team efforts were another popu
lar theme of the night.
Michael Picasso '12 and Yesenia
Cisneros' 12 came as Adam and Eve.
She wore a green bikini.and he had a
green speedo. Both were covered in
leaves when they arrived, but they
were left with pretty much only their
swimsuits when the night ended.
On the dance floor, Cisneros said.
"Leaves were flying everywhere."
Jesse Altman '12 and Megan
Pfeiffer '12 were "red party cups."
"Like for beer pong," Altman
said, motioning to the ping pong balls
glued to her headband and red fabric
draped around her body.
Eight freshmen from Burbank
dressed as characters from Mario
Brothers. By process of elimination.
Travis Noll 12 was cast as Mario. He
wore a hat with an "M." blue overalls
with a gold button and a long-sleeve
red shirt.
"There were eight freshmen and
eight characters." Noll said. "Toad.
Luigi. Wario. They're all there."
Just before midnight, two stu
dents in black suits with Zombie
masks and wigs rode their tricycles
around in the foyer of Old Union.
Someone with a pig mask followed
behind.
The Axe & Palm served a special
Halloween menu, but the diner
stayed less busy than the rest of the
party. The doors connecting it to the

dance floor were blocked off. and
students were forced to walk outside
and around the main dance floor to
get in.
The second floor was closed until
around 11 p.m. But even after stu
dents were allowed upstairs, the area
stayed relatively deserted. A girl
dressed as a nurse and another as
Dorothy slouched onto the ground.
The two quietly ate from a pile of
M&Ms. mini-1 lershev bars and Laffv
Taffies.
In another corner, a pair of stu
dents quietly hooked up against the
crook of a window sill.
At the top of the staircase. 88
sheets of paper had been taped to
gether to create an image of the
Mausoleum.
Outside, a chap in a chicken suit
talked to a Speedo-wearing con
struction worker, two bumble bees
and a tourist, who was holding the
hand of a girl dressed in a gothic out
fit. Ken Soong, a first-year graduate
student in applied physics, bought a
plunger for three dollars at Wal-Mart
and put on a McCain sticker.
And. bam, an Obama supporter
was transformed into "Joe the
Plumber."
"It's pretty cool running into
Sarah Palins."' he said. "I've run into
three in the last half hour."

broke it before the party, leaving him defenseless.
You can't have a Mausoleum Party without a mausoleum.
But a forecast for rain prompted organizers to announce last
Tuesday that the event normally held at the crypt where the
LJniversitv's founders are interred would relocate to Old
Union. It was the first party of its kind at the student center
since its remodeling last year.
The furniture was removed from study spaces. Yellow cau
tion tape was draped above the building's facade. Two dozen
stvrofoam tombstones were staked into the grassy courtyard.
Free Red Bulls, glow sticks and condoms were available near
the bathrooms.
Turnout was modest. Old Union wasn't deserted, but it was
n't popping at the seams either. A rival Synergy party seemed
to draw much of the upperclassmen cohort, and many of those
present were freshmen. No reliable attendance estimate was
available since students filtered through over four hours.
"Given the weather conditions, we worked as hard as we
could to put together a party that I think most people enjoyed
very much." said organizer Risha Bera '10. junior class co
president.
The lights above the dance floor
were uncomfortably bright, she said,
because of all the emergency lighting
in Old Union. They tried to put col
ored sheets over as many as they
could.
Instead of dancing, many stood
around and talked or snapped pic
tures of costumes with their camera
phones. The normally antiseptic
smell of the student union was re
placed by the odors of sweat, body
paint and polyester.
A Santa Clara County Sheriffs
deputy and two Stanford police offi
cers paced the dance floor's perime
ter. A few feet away from the cops, a
group of students passed around a
bottle of vodka disguised as water.
Many took advantage of the occa
sion to wear as little as possible.
Leggy barmaids abounded. Metallic,
skin-tight leggings from American
Apparel seemed the item of the
night. Others wore miniskirts that re
vealed more than most underwear
would.
A group of girls cut holes in the
bottom of their mesh laundry bas
kets, stepped into them.and filled the
empty space with brassieres.
One guy came as a singer of "Dick
in a Box" — a play on Justin Timber
lake's now classic "Saturday Night
Live" skit. Walking in to find a
crowded dance floor, he removed the
box tied around his waist, set it in a
corner and stripped down to his
moose print pajama pants. He flexed
his biceps, approached a group of
girls and began grinding to Nelly
Furtado's "Promiscuous."
If grades were given for costumes,
some would get extra credit for cre
ativity. A "Chick Magnet" wore a
cardboard U-shaped magnet with
pictures of baby chickens attached.
When a girl came in as a human-size
TI-89 graphing calculator, a boy
pushed her buttons. Just then, a trio
of cardboard iPods began snaking
through the crowd, dancing to the
music.
Team efforts were another popu
lar theme of the night.
Michael Picasso '12 and Yesenia
Cisneros' 12 came as Adam and Eve.
She wore a green bikini.and he had a
green speedo. Both were covered in
leaves when they arrived, but they
were left with pretty much only their
swimsuits when the night ended.
On the dance floor, Cisneros said.
"Leaves were flying everywhere."
Jesse Altman '12 and Megan
Pfeiffer '12 were "red party cups."
"Like for beer pong," Altman
said, motioning to the ping pong balls
glued to her headband and red fabric
draped around her body.
Eight freshmen from Burbank
dressed as characters from Mario
Brothers. By process of elimination.
Travis Noll 12 was cast as Mario. He
wore a hat with an "M." blue overalls
with a gold button and a long-sleeve
red shirt.
"There were eight freshmen and
eight characters." Noll said. "Toad.
Luigi. Wario. They're all there."
Just before midnight, two stu
dents in black suits with Zombie
masks and wigs rode their tricycles
around in the foyer of Old Union.
Someone with a pig mask followed
behind.
The Axe & Palm served a special
Halloween menu, but the diner
stayed less busy than the rest of the
party. The doors connecting it to the

dance floor were blocked off. and
students were forced to walk outside
and around the main dance floor to
get in.
The second floor was closed until
around 11 p.m. But even after stu
dents were allowed upstairs, the area
stayed relatively deserted. A girl
dressed as a nurse and another as
Dorothy slouched onto the ground.
The two quietly ate from a pile of
M&Ms. mini-1 lershev bars and Laffv
Taffies.
In another corner, a pair of stu
dents quietly hooked up against the
crook of a window sill.
At the top of the staircase. 88
sheets of paper had been taped to
gether to create an image of the
Mausoleum.
Outside, a chap in a chicken suit
talked to a Speedo-wearing con
struction worker, two bumble bees
and a tourist, who was holding the
hand of a girl dressed in a gothic out
fit. Ken Soong, a first-year graduate
student in applied physics, bought a
plunger for three dollars at Wal-Mart
and put on a McCain sticker.
And. bam, an Obama supporter
was transformed into "Joe the
Plumber."
"It's pretty cool running into
Sarah Palins."' he said. "I've run into
three in the last half hour."
