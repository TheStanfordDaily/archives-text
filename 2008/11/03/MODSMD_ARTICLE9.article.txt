## Q&A AL KARIMLAIANI '12 A 						newcomer's take on the tricks and treats of Halloween 
### LAURA RUMPE STAFF WRITER 
What is this Halloween thing, and how am I
supposed to celebrate? It's not a question
most Stanford students, with years of cos
tume hunting and trick-or-treating under
their holts, grapple with when the big day
rolls around each October. We take for granted that a night is
set aside each year solely for the purpose of dressing up as
something we've always wanted to be. but never had the
chance, and bingeing on fun-sized nougat bars with reckless
abandon.
Not so for Al Karim Lalani 12 from Dares Salaaam,Tan
zania, one of the many international students trying to make
sense of this night of revelry known as I lalloween. He shares
his experience in the following, groundbreaking Daily exclu
sive.
The Stanford Daily (SD): So you'd never heard of I lalloween
before ever?
Al karim Lalani (AKL): Well, I went to an international
school, back home.The kids in the American Embassy would
celebrate.and sometimes the neighbors would come trick-or
treating, which 1 thought was annoying, so I had the basic
idea.
SI): Oh, so you knew about it but you never celebrated?
AKL: The thing is. I didn't know how big of a deal it was until
the week of Halloween. I did order something online, but it
came a day late,so at the last minute. I put on a kanga.a very
Tanzanian cloth, wrapped it around me and said I was Massai
warrior (a traditional warrior from Tanzania or Kenya).
SD: Nice save! So how was your first Halloween? Any sur
prises?
AKL: I went to the Mausoleum Party in Old Union ... but I
think trick-or-treating would have been more fun. I was pret
ty amazed at how creative people were with their costumes; I
assumed they'd all be scary cartoon characters, but no. Also,
there were lots of adult costumes, a lot of Playboy bunnies ...
I thought,"Wow, these people must freeze!"
SD: No kidding. So do you have anything like this that you cel
ebrate in Tanzania?
AKL: I don't think there's anything in Tanzania where we
dress up ... there is E!id. For Eid, we go around to relatives'
and friends' houses, and take them candy and nuts, and they
come to your house, and you do end up accumulating a lot of
candy.
SD: I low do you feel about the difference between celebrating
traditions from home and American holidays after your Hal
loween experience?
AKL: Well. we celebrated Eid here earlier on. but it was very
different from what I celebrate hack home. It was a very
Americanized version. I'm still going to celebrate* the holidays
1 celebrate back home, but I am also going to celebrate Amer
ican holidays. It's part of the whole experience of studying
abroad in a new country; I'm going to embrace it.
SD: Cool. And your last-minute costume idea sounds great!
Can we ask what you were planning to be that arrived late?
AKL: [pause .. .chuckle] Is this going in The Daily?
SD: Yes.
AKL: Ok. So I ordered a chick magnet costume. You know, it
was a big magnet, with chickens attached to it.
SD: Wow. too bad that didn't work out.
AKL: Yeah. I thought it was going to be so cool. Maybe next
Halloween.
