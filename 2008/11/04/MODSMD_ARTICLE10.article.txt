You've seen the "No on Prop. 8" T-shirts
form a sea of purple, the "Yes on Prop. 8" pick
et signs, the "Get Up Vote Down 4 & 8" posters,
the efliers of all kinds flooding your inbox.
But these campaign efforts both for and
against the California propositions don't just
appear out of thin air. Who's behind it all?
Living and breathing the cause
"I'm exhausted,"said Emily Gasner'o9.co
president of Stanford Students for Choice
(SSFC)."But I want to do this â€” it's not an ob
ligation."
To sum up Gasner's quarter so far, one
needs not look further than the"Noon Prop.4"
button pinned to her shirt. If passed, Prop. 4
would prohibit abortion for a minor until 48
hours after her parent or legal guardian re
ceives notification.
"Tliis is all I do," she said. "I don't talk to
anyone lately, it seems, without talking about
the issue."
Gasner, who argued "No on 4" in last week's
debate hosted by the Stanford Political Union
(SPU),and SSFChave conducted information
al dorm storms and worked with the Stanford
Theatre Activist Mobilization Project
(STAMP) to put on last week's Maze of I lorror
in White Plaza.
"The main campaigning approach has been
to complement day-to-day conversations with
really prominent events," Gasner said. "You
hear about it one day, and the next day you see
this event in White Plaza and make the connec
tion. Part of the importance present in day-to
day conversation is in that it's a day-to-day

issue. We're trying to make it present all the
time."
Activism isn't anything new for Gasner,
who worked as a NARAL Pro-Choice Ameri
ca intern in New York to pass The Reproduc
tive Health and Privacy Protection Act. Two
years ago.she was also involved with campaign
ingagainst Prop. 85, which dealt with issues sim
ilar to Prop. 4.
"Basically, I do this," she said."This is what I
do and I love it. I can't focus on what I'm read
ing for class, even if I try, because I'm always
thinking about the issue."
Amanda Gelender '09 is another example
of an experienced student campaigner.
"My family was always very focused on so
cial justice." she said. "It's the most important
thing in my life. I identify as an ally to the gay
rights movement.This doesn't affect me direct
ly, but I don't think that matters. All of us need
to realize that we're all a part of the fabric of the
same community."
As founder and director of STA M P, Gelen
der takes advantage of creativity as a cam
paigning tool. In addition to collaborating
with SSFC, STAMP has worked extensively
with the Student Coalition for Marriage
Equality (S('ME) against Prop. 8, which
would ban same-sex marriage within Califor
nia if passed. For example,STAMP'S marriage
proposal performances led to Gelender's invi
tation to speak at a Redwood City press con
ference.
"'The kind of creativity we're using for dif
ferent kinds of mobilization lets us get a wider
scope of audience," Gelender said. "We see
every public space as a potential theater space."
Previously,S TAMP has partnered with such
groups as Students Taking Action Now Darfur

(S TAND). Gelender herself worked for two
years with the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) death penalty project, and she also
lobbied to get gender-neutral bathrooms and
abolish the Sadie Hawkins dance in high
school.
"1 kind of have a history of advocacy," she
said. "This is something i feel comfortable
doing."
No experience necessary
But even those who have had little or no
previous campaigning experience are verv visi
ble.
"I was surprised to see myself get so in
volved in the [Noon H| campaign,"said Norris

Mei Ml. "But it's hard not to when you are
aware of all that is happening on both sides."
In fact, she said that "campaigning has been
my top priority above school and all else. My
friends and girlfriend can tell you that it has
taken over my life. I spend at least three hours
every day doing something "No on Prop. X' re
lated."
Bob's "No on K" dorm captain, Mei argued
against Prop. 8 at the SPU-hosted debate and
managed content for the Marriage Equality
Photo Exhibit.
"I'm constantly on Facebook and Gmail,
writing notes, posiing news stories, comment
ing on other people's posts and encouraging
other people to get involved," Mei said. Her

current profile picture stars a jack-o'-lantern
carved with "No on Prop. 8."
Cireg, who did not want his last name pub
lished in The Daily for privacy reasons, is in a
similar boat.
"I ley, I'm a bioengineering grad student
I'm not trained in this," he said."But it needed
to be done."
As the Campus Campaign Manager for the
Vote Down 4 & 8 state campaign that links 23
college campuses, Greg, who said that "people
realize this is the major civil rights movement of
the 21st century," started planning over the
summer and devotes 30 hours a week to the

Patrick Ardinger '09 used his Kimball dorm room window to take action against Prop. 8. While some students went all-out campaigning for
and against propositions, others found smaller ways to contribute to the effort.
