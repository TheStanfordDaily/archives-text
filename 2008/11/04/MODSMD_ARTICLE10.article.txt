You've seen the "No on Prop. 8" T-shirts
form a sea of purple, the "Yes on Prop. 8" pick
et signs, the "Get Up Vote Down 4 & 8" posters,
the efliers of all kinds flooding your inbox.
But these campaign efforts both for and
against the California propositions don't just
appear out of thin air. Who's behind it all?
Living and breathing the cause
"I'm exhausted,"said Emily Gasner'o9.co
president of Stanford Students for Choice
(SSFC)."But I want to do this â€” it's not an ob
ligation."
To sum up Gasner's quarter so far, one
needs not look further than the"Noon Prop.4"
button pinned to her shirt. If passed, Prop. 4
would prohibit abortion for a minor until 48
hours after her parent or legal guardian re
ceives notification.
"Tliis is all I do," she said. "I don't talk to
anyone lately, it seems, without talking about
the issue."
Gasner, who argued "No on 4" in last week's
debate hosted by the Stanford Political Union
(SPU),and SSFChave conducted information
al dorm storms and worked with the Stanford
Theatre Activist Mobilization Project
(STAMP) to put on last week's Maze of I lorror
in White Plaza.
"The main campaigning approach has been
to complement day-to-day conversations with
really prominent events," Gasner said. "You
hear about it one day, and the next day you see
this event in White Plaza and make the connec
tion. Part of the importance present in day-to
day conversation is in that it's a day-to-day

issue. We're trying to make it present all the
time."
Activism isn't anything new for Gasner,
who worked as a NARAL Pro-Choice Ameri
ca intern in New York to pass The Reproduc
tive Health and Privacy Protection Act. Two
years ago.she was also involved with campaign
ingagainst Prop. 85, which dealt with issues sim
ilar to Prop. 4.
"Basically, I do this," she said."This is what I
do and I love it. I can't focus on what I'm read
ing for class, even if I try, because I'm always
thinking about the issue."
Amanda Gelender '09 is another example
of an experienced student campaigner.
"My family was always very focused on so
cial justice." she said. "It's the most important
thing in my life. I identify as an ally to the gay
rights movement.This doesn't affect me direct
ly, but I don't think that matters. All of us need
to realize that we're all a part of the fabric of the
same community."
As founder and director of STA M P, Gelen
der takes advantage of creativity as a cam
paigning tool. In addition to collaborating
with SSFC, STAMP has worked extensively
with the Student Coalition for Marriage
Equality (S('ME) against Prop. 8, which
would ban same-sex marriage within Califor
nia if passed. For example,STAMP'S marriage
proposal performances led to Gelender's invi
tation to speak at a Redwood City press con
ference.
"'The kind of creativity we're using for dif
ferent kinds of mobilization lets us get a wider
scope of audience," Gelender said. "We see
every public space as a potential theater space."
Previously,S TAMP has partnered with such
groups as Students Taking Action Now Darfur

(S TAND). Gelender herself worked for two
years with the American Civil Liberties Union
(ACLU) death penalty project, and she also
lobbied to get gender-neutral bathrooms and
abolish the Sadie Hawkins dance in high
school.
"1 kind of have a history of advocacy," she
said. "This is something i feel comfortable
doing."
No experience necessary
But even those who have had little or no
previous campaigning experience are verv visi
ble.
"I was surprised to see myself get so in
volved in the [Noon H| campaign,"said Norris

Mei Ml. "But it's hard not to when you are
aware of all that is happening on both sides."
In fact, she said that "campaigning has been
my top priority above school and all else. My
friends and girlfriend can tell you that it has
taken over my life. I spend at least three hours
every day doing something "No on Prop. X' re
lated."
Bob's "No on K" dorm captain, Mei argued
against Prop. 8 at the SPU-hosted debate and
managed content for the Marriage Equality
Photo Exhibit.
"I'm constantly on Facebook and Gmail,
writing notes, posiing news stories, comment
ing on other people's posts and encouraging
other people to get involved," Mei said. Her

Cireg, who did not want his last name pub
lished in The Daily for privacy reasons, is in a
similar boat.
"I ley, I'm a bioengineering grad student
I'm not trained in this," he said."But it needed
to be done."
As the Campus Campaign Manager for the
Vote Down 4 & 8 state campaign that links 23
college campuses, Greg, who said that "people
realize this is the major civil rights movement of
the 21st century," started planning over the
summer and devotes 30 hours a week to the

Patrick Ardinger '09 used his Kimball dorm room window to take action against Prop. 8. While some students went all-out campaigning for
and against propositions, others found smaller ways to contribute to the effort.
campaign.
Getting over I,(XX) "No on Prop. 8"
T-shirts printed, training students for
phonebanking (twice a week for "No
on 8" and once a week for "No on 4")
to reach undecided voters outside
Stanford and helping set up the appa
ratus for Stanford's 50"No on B"dorm
captains have been just a few of his re
sponsibilities.
"I don't really sleep," Greg said.
Neither does Jamie Tim "10, al
though she, too, has "never, ever" been
involved with any sort of campaigning.
"Of the 24 hours in a day, I spend 20
of them thinking about the cam
paign," Tam said. "Even when I go to

sleep, I'm always thinking, 'Has this
been taken care of? Has that been
taken care of?' Sometimes I can't
sleep."
AccordingtoTam.SCME has been
involved with putting on three to five
events every week since school has
started. This included the state's
largest "No on 8" phonebank, which
took place on Saturday and drew
more than 270 student vounteers who
made over 15,(XX) calls.
"It's a huge time commitment,"
Tam said. "This election is such that
things are moving really fast and we're
having to react really fast. You get a
phone call, and then you have to drop
everything and run. I haven't done any
real homework in three or four weeks."
"But we have to realize that this is
much more than GPA. much more
than just Stanford," she continued.
"The world keeps turning, and being

inside the Stanford Bubble isn't an ex
cuse for not realizing that things go on
beyond that bubble."
Every little hit counts
Nonetheless, losing sleep and lag
ging in schoolwork aren't require
ments for making the California
propositions a part of one's life.
For one, Patrick Ardinger '09, a
Kansas native, has propped up "No.
on Prop. 8" signs on his Kimball dorm
window.
"I put up the sign because I have
this amazing bay window and I
thought that I should capitalize on
my architectural advantages," he
said.
Jonathan Scrafford' 09 also in
volves himself via small-scale indi
vidual campaigning, such as by post
ing a "Yes on 4" sign on his door.
"I've participated in the [SPU] de

bate and talked to people, but other
than that, I haven't really done any
thing public with it,"Scrafford said."l
think about this stuff a ton, but I
wouldn't say it consumes a very big
part of my life because I'm a lot more
concerned about actual abortion pol
icy. I don't see Prop. 4 as having any
thing to do with the legitimacy of
abortion."
For Catherine Howard '11, a na
tive of Washington, it's more about
information than persuasion. As part
of a political service requirement for
her presidential politics class, she
spent a few hours compiling an infor
mation packet entitled "Know Your
Props," which has been forwarded to
several campus email lists.
"I'm not sure how I'd vote, and
I'm honestly kind of glad I don't have
to make that decision because I'm
not a California voter." she said. "But

I still thought it was important for
people to be informed. You could
hear all you want from other people,
but are you going to let them make
the decision for you?"
Getting through today and beyond
In the final push, both sides are
making last-ditch efforts to get the
word out.
SCME, for instance, guerilla
fliered other college campuses last
night and will be stationed at polling
places from 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. today,
standing the required 100 feet away,
but close enough "so that the last thing
voters see is our smiling faces," in
Greg's words.
And the final challenge?
Swallowing the nervousness and
anticipation building up in the last
hours before the polls unveil the
verdicts.

"If Prop. 8 passes, I'll be crying for
the next week,"Tarn said. "If it doesn't
pass, I'll be crying tears of joy for the
next week. Either way, I'll be sobbing.
Part of me is too nervous to watch the
entire build-up tonight."
For Randy Stoltenberg, a Ph.D.
candidate in chemistry and an active
"Yes on 8" South Palo Alto campaign
er, whether or not Prop. 8 passes "will
be a major factor in deciding whether
to stay in California after I'm done at
Stanford. If this loses and we were to
stay in California, public schooling
will be out of the question."
"I have no idea how it'll turn out,"
Gelender said. "It's so nerve-wrack
ing. The stakes are high, and I think
we're all feeling that. This is going to
be monumental."
