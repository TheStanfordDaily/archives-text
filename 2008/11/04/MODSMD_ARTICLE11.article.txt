# Students hit the road for Obama

### JESSICA WERTHEIM 
"Most students come to Stanford with a set of ideals —
some sort of lofty belief to which they more or less try to
cling in principle," Anton Zietsman "12 said. "For me, it was
public service."
While countless Stanford students express their political
views by wearing shirts and pins and sending bumper stick
ers to each other on Facebook.that sentiment of public serv
ice has driven some students to drop their problem sets and
literally take to the road.
By the end of high school. Zietsman. for instance, had de
cided that he wanted to get involved with politics in his com
munity and determined that college was the perfect place to
start.
I lis views changed, however,once the hectic first days of
moving in and settling down into a routine had passed.
"Most of the time, it consists of things that you are used
to and therefore contains very little difference from your
life before," he reflected. "Nothing is more dangerous for
your ideals. What I truly love about Stanford in this case is
that it provided me with a way to breathe life into my beliefs,
to materialize a once intangible goal."
And right now, Zietsman is in Nevada doing exactly that.
Seeing the opportunity to leave campus and campaign
for Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) as a learning experience. Zi
etsman traveled to Las Vegas for five days and is planning to
come back to campus tomorrow.
"I value this experience as much, if not more, as any of
my classes because it teaches me something new — some
thing real." Zietsman said. "The Stanford Bubble can be
very oppressive and this was an opportunity for me to have
a larger impact beyond the red-tiled roofs."
Zietsman saw canvassing — going door to door — as the
perfect outlet for his desire to be involved.
"While canvassing. I've been exposed to a great deal of
people — fervent Obama supporters,staidskeptics,staunch
conservatives and even white supremacists," he said.
People's reactions toward the election still vary, and the
greater part of Zietsman's job was to "get the vote out," to
remind people of the election and make sure they will turn
up and vote today.
"There seems to be a genuine appreciation for the effort
we all put in," Zietsman said. "Most of the time, people
seemed grateful to see that I was out there knocking on
doors. I guess we are seen as foot soldiers — expendable yet
vital — in an ongoing war."
Andrew Ehrich '08, another first-time presidential cam
paigner, worked on canvassing as well.
"I drove up to Vegas with a friend.and from there, we got
in touch with the field organizers (people in charge of one
small district), were given packets with addresses and went
door to door, asking people if they were supporting
Obama," he said.
What happened after proved to be eye-opening for him.
"I was surprised by the sheer number of citizens who
gave up their time and paycheck to be there," he said. "It was
such an experience to get out to a place where the economy
is the biggest issue — so many of these people were about to
lose their homes to foreclosure. We are a little sheltered
from the economic recession here at Stanford. We know
about what is happening and we know why. but there are so
few people on this campus where this issue really hits
home."
Angelina Cardona "11. who works with Students for
Obama, is yet another student whose passion extends be
yond the clasp of a safety pin. She went to Philadelphia last
spring for eight days during the primaries and has traveled
to Reno twice this quarter with a group of other Stanford
students. According to Cardona, Stanford has sent 134 stu
dents to Nevada, and many others have traveled all over the
country to swing states.
"1 canvassed to remind people to vote and persuade'
them it they are an undecided voter," she said, explaining
how the canvassers discuss the issues that matter most to the
voter.
Whv devote so much time on the road doine that?
