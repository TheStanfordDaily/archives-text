The Daily concludes its two-day pre
view of four races to watch. Today, the
focus will he on the battle for
Nevada's second congressional dis
trict and on the race for North
Carolina's governorship.
Nevada's Second Congressional
District
Contestants:
Dean Heller (Republican, incum
bent),
Jill Derby (Democrat)
Pollster composite polling average:
Heller +K.O percent
This race is a rematch of Heller
and Derby's 2006 battle, when,
despite a largely Democratic year
nationwide, Heller was able to hold
on to the traditionally Republican
seat by about five points. Derby, a
strong candidate in 2006. spent the
two-year interval as chairwoman of
the Nevada Democratic Party and
hardened her political credentials.
Now. in a year with an even bigger
Democratic groundswell than in the
recent midterm election, she's back to
try and snag this seat from the (iOP.
Little polling has been done in
the district, but signs point to it being
a close race: Research 2000 had a
poll just last week that put the con
test at Heller +3 percent. A Mason-
Dixon poll came out days later that
had Heller at +13 percent, but
according to Five 'ITiirtv Eight, a
polling analysis site. Mason-Dixon
has had a slight Republican lean all
year — as a result, this might be an

outlier. Indeed, the NRCC is not
treating this like a double-digit lead:
the Nevada second was on their
leaked "Death List," garnering a "2"
rating, which means, "Leaning
Republican; if there's a wave ...
could be in trouble."
Could such a wave — largely in
the form of Barack Obama's success
in the state — manifest itself?
It's certainly a possibility. Even
though Democrats have closed the
gap on party identification in the dis
trict in recent years, they are still out
numbered by Republicans. Indeed,
the Nevada second is the most con
servative region of the state, and one
that is critical to national Republican
candidates seeking to win Nevada. In
2004. for instance, George W. Bush
won Nevada by the skin of his teeth
— three percent, but he won the sec
ond by 16 points. In order for a
Republican to win Nevada, they must
have a wide margin in this district.
However, in early October,
polling data showed John McCain
with a lead of less than seven points
in the Nevada second. In early vot
ing statewide. Democratic participa
tion far surpassed its Republican
counterpart — this was true even in
the second district. where
Democrats cast about 1,800 more
early and mail-in ballots than
Republicans did.
This favors Derby, but the mar
gins aren't wide enough for her to
be remotely comfortable. Heller
does not need a McCain victory in
Nevada to hold onto his state. By
contrast, Derby needs Obama's
coattails to remain competitive.
Expect this seat to remain with the
GOP. but if Obama dominates the
Electoral College nationwide and in
the Silver State — thus creating the
proverbial wave — then Derby may

be able to pull off the upset.
North Carolina Governor
Contestants:
Beverly Perdue (Democrat),
Pat McCrory (Republican)
Real Clear Politics composite polling
average: Perdue +2.0 percent
In a year when the Democrats are
expected to increase majorities in the
House and Senate and reclaim the
White House, North Carolina's
gubernatorial race may be a contest
for the GOP to hang their hats on.
Perdue, the current lieutenant gover
nor of the state, is facing off against
McCrory. the mayor of Charlotte, in a
contest to replace Democrat Mike
Easley. If McCrory were to win, it
would likely be one of the few
nationwide races where the
Democrats lost a seat.
McCrory is an interesting case.
Despite being the most high-profile
Republican candidate, he was the last
of the bunch to enter the race — the
three other candidates for the GOP
nomination were holding debates
almost three months before McCrory
declared his candidacy. After winning
the primary. McCrory. who has never
worked in state government, used a
Democratic strategy and painted
himself as the change candidate. It
was effective, and by September, he
had flipped Perdue leads as high as
nine points into an eight-point
advantage for himself. Barack
Obama's campaigning in North
Carolina and change rhetoric of his
own (and support of Perdue) helped
stop the bleeding, but McCrory was
largely able to level the race.
But why should residents of the
other 49 states care?
Emphasis by both parties on ger
rymandering has increased the

national interest in governors' races
across the country. Governors have a
major influence on how congression
al districts are drawn in their state —
this means that they can craft districts
so that their party can remain in or
gain control of different areas.
In July, Chris Schrimpf, a
spokesman for the Republican
Governor's Association, said that by
2010, "We could feasibly see 25 to 30
congressional seats swing as the
result of redistricting."
As a result, the RGA. DGA and
other party associations have kicked
into high gear in 2008. North
Carolina is one of the first of 47 states
that will have gubernatorial elections
by 2011 — and it is arguably the most
competitive governor's race of this
cycle (although Washington state
may beg to differ). The RGA has
spent over $4 million on television
advertisements for McCrory, and
Perdue has raised almost $5 million
in three months.
And yet, neither Perdue nor
McCrory has been able to pull away
from the other. It mirrors the other
major races in the state: North
Carolina is one of the true tossups of
the presidential election as McCain
leads Obama by a fraction of a point
in the RCP average and incumbent
Elizabeth Dole has refused to allow
challenger Kay Hagan to pull away
in the state's senatorial race. Polling
over the past week has favored
Perdue, but Rasmussen had
McCrory with a four-point lead as
late as October 23.
It's Election Day.and in this pur
ple state, one thing is clear: The
Executive Mansion is entirely up for
grabs.
