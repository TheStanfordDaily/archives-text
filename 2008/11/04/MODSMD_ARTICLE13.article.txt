### ALAN GUO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In today's election. Californian voters will vote on
Proposition X. a measure that eliminate the right to
marry for same-sex couples. As of last night. 1.394
Stanford faculty and staff have taken a stand against the
ballot initiative through an online petition that has circu
lated the Stanford campus.
The petition was sent out on Oct. 28 as part of the
larger effort of "No on Prop. 8" supporters reaching out
to the Stanford community.
"The purpose of this petition is to educate faculty and
staff about how Prop. 8 harms the Stanford community
and to give them an easy way to express their opposition
to Prop 8." said Greg, leader of the Stanford's Coalition
for Marriage Equality, in an email to The Daily
Greg. who did not want his last name published in The
Daily for privacy reasons, views the petition as an inte
gral part of demonstrating the Stanford community's
opposition to the proposition, along with the ASSU's and
Graduate Student Council's resolutions condemning
Prop. 8.
The petition received quick response from faculty and
staff members, generating over KHM) signatures within 24
hours.
Noah Abrahamson. a computing info systems analyst
for IT services, was one of several signatories who joined
the petition not just because of political opposition, but
also in defense of his own same-sex marriage.
"(The proposition] intimately affects our life: it's like

we've living in suspended animation, waiting for the
other shoe to drop." Abrahamson said to The Daily in an
email.
"There are at least 32,000 other people who are expe
riencing the same agony of not knowing what the future
will hold — on what is the most intimate aspects of one's
life." Abrahamson said. "How can my husband and I
move confidently forward in our future together?"
Other faculty and staff saw the proposition as a seri
ous violation of human rights.
"Gays should have the right to marry, to have their
union fully recognized by the state." said Hoover Senior
Fellow and petition signatory Larry Diamond.
Although Diamond does not expect the U.S. Supreme
Court to interpret marriage in that way. he added "it is
particularly disturbing that there is this initiative to
reverse a California Supreme Court ruling on this consti
tutional right."
"The initiative is to take away a right that has already
been recognized." he added.
Joe Nation, lecturer in public policy and former state
legislator, agreed.
"I think it's important for everybody to [take a stand
against Prop. B], because [rights are] such a fundamental
principle that we must either stand up for or sit on the
sidelines, and I have never sat on the sidelines," Nation
said.
"I hope it fails, and that everyone celebrates tomor
row night." he added.
