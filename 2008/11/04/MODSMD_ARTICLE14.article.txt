# ELECTION '08
## Groups join to host election party CoHo to feature projection screens, free food, free beer 
### JENNY REMPEL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In an effort to bring undergradu
ates together for a historic election,
several student organizations have
collaborated to host an election
party at the CoHo from 7 p.m. to
midnight tonight.
The event will offer students free
food and beer, as well as a unique
venue to watch the election results.
"We ... want to create an atmos
phere and get a lot of people gath
ered there, celebrating this pretty
historic election," said Anuradha
Sivaram '09 of Stanford in
Washington, one of the event's co
sponsors.
The party will feature live net
work coverage on the CoHo's flat
screen TV's. The organizers will also
bring in two projectors that will
show election results from several
different TV stations.
One projector will remain inside,
but another will be placed outside
between the CoHo and the
Treehouse in case of a student
spillover.
ITie party is open to the entire
undergraduate community, so the
organizers anticipate the possibility
of an overflow. They hope to fill the
CoHo and involve as many students

as possible.
Sivaram said that the organizers
are planning for as many as 4(H)
attendees, but that turnout is unpre
dictable since many students may
base their decision to go on the
weather or on their moods.
"It can range anywhere from a
very small contingent of people who
want to get out there to any and all
undergraduates who want to come
by," she said.
Those who participate will be
part of the first election party to be
hosted not only bv Stanford in
Washington but also a number of
co-sponsors. Other groups involved
in the event include Stanford in
Government. Peninsula Young
Democrats, the Stanford Political
Union, the Stanford Democrats, the
Stanford Campaign for Marriage
Equality and the asm
"It's been a very collaborative
effort," said Cameron Bell '09. one
of the party organizers. "We reached
out to The Review, the Stanford
Conservative Society and the
College Republicans, but there was
not so much interest there."
When asked why the College
Republicans would not be co-host
ing the party, Irina Obernian told
The Daily by email that the College
Republicans had already planned
their own election night party
before hearing about the one at the
CoHo.
Despite the noticeable lack of a
conservative contingent on the party

sponsorship list, organizers empha
sized that the party is a non-partisan
event.
"We just want it to be a place
where the entire university can coa
lesce and celebrate the election,"
said Ashwin Mudaliar '09, president
of the Stanford Democrats. "We're
not trying to bill this as a victory
party for Obama or anything."
Because there are so many spon
sors for the party, the organizers will
offer free food to everyone who
attends and free beer for anyone
over the age of 21.
"That sounds tempting," said
Ainiee Miles '10. Though she had
been planning to watch election
results with her friends, after hearing
about the party yesterday evening,
she began to reconsider her plans
for tonight.
Alex Chu '09 was also unaware of
the party, but he still plans to remain
at home tonight.
"I am going to be watching the
election in my dorm," Chu said.
"I've got school work to do."
Sivaram. however, said that he
thinks the CoHo will be a unique
experience for students to share in a
historic election.
"Why watch [the election results]
in your room, on your computer,
alone," he said, "when you can have
fun and really enjoy the process with
all your peers at Stanford?"
