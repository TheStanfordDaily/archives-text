## Editorial Drop this newspaper and go vote 
### 
Alter a year of never-ending primaries,
the rise and fall of presidential hope
fuls and the hard-fought campaigns,
the wait is over. After months of knocking on
doors in our neighborhoods, calling swing
states and engaging in tireless debates on the
campaign trail — in the classroom and across
the dining hall table — the day is finally here.
All the talk has come to an end and we final
ly have a chance to exercise our right, our
privilege and our duty to vote.
Some have grown weary as these cam
paigns have left many of us wounded, but the
historical significance and political impor
tance of this election go without being said.
So if you are hesitant to go out and brave the
weather and the long lines, the editorial board
has compiled a list of the top five reasons why
you should take the time out of your day to
make your voice heard.
I.The Propositions: People registered in
California often believe that because this
state is guaranteed to go blue, their vote does
n't matter. It is necessary to note, however,
that this election cycle we have several very
important propositions on the ballot, particu
larly Proposition 8, which challenges our no
tion of equality. Recent polls have revealed a
tight contest, and each and every vote will
matter.
2. The Past Eight Years: No matter where
you party lines are drawn, both Senator John
McCain and Senator Barack Obama are run
ning on platforms of change. McCain, or the
"Maverick" as many of his supporters know
him, did much to speak out against his party
throughout his long tenor as an elected offi
cial. Obama has been known for reaching
across party lines and fights for inclusive pol

itics. Your vote is one of the most powerful
and productive ways that you can speak out
against the politics of the past and push for
ward to a future that is, if nothing else, a bit
brighter. It is often said that if you don't vote,
you can't complain. Obviously, no one can
rob you of your right to free speech. I >ut if you
do not actively do your part to get the results
that you want, you are part of the problem.
3. Your Paycheck (or lack thereof): The
economy is bad. Really bad. The struggling
economy affects all facets of America. Both
candidates have noted that it can be felt from
Main Street to Wall Street, and many of us
can say that we are feeling it on Campus
Drive and Escondido Road, too. Each candi
date has a different approach to fixing our
economy and an approach that will affect
many of us as we begin to see what life outside
of the Stanford Bubble has in store for us.
4. Your Children and Grandchildren: Not
only is the future of our country at stake, but
also our reputation. Imagine that 30 years
from now one of your grandchildren asks you
where you were on that historic day. Now
imagine the looks on their faces when you say
that you were sitting in your dorm room.
Facebooking instead of taking an active part
in the political process.
5. Because You Can: Voting is something
that was not always provided to all of our na
tion's citizens, and still to this day many of the
people affected by the votes that we cast do
not get to have a say in whom we elect as pres
ident. So get out there and stretch your De
mocratic muscle.
The editorial board strongly urges you to
stop reading this article, put down the paper
and i»et out and vote.
