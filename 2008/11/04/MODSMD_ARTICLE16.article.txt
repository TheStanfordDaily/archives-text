# ENDORSEMENTS ON CALIF. PROPOSITIONS
## 
### 
The following statements represent the editorial
hoard's views on I Oof the 12 propositions Cal
ifornia residents will vote on today.
PROPOSITION 1A: YES
Prop. 1A authorizes the sale of $9.95 billion
in bonds to build a network of high-speed train
rail lines linking Sacramento and San Diego.
Construction would begin as early as 2011 and
would be the largest public works project in
California history. The project would also be
the first high-speed train system in the United
States. The proposition is to receive equal
funding from state taxpayers, the federal gov
ernment and private investors.
Proponents of IA. including Governor
Schwarzenegger and the Los Angeles and San
Francisco Chambers of Commerce, argue that
the proposition will give a much-needed boost
to California's economy, creating 160.000 con
struction-related jobs and another 450,000
permanent jobs. The train system would also
reduce traffic congestion to help mitigate the
estimated $20 billion in wasted fuel and pro
ductivity that plagues California, which has
three of the five most congested urban areas in
the United States. Hie proposition is also
viewed as an environmental necessity â€” it
would lower air pollution and greenhouse gas
emissions, while also reducing foreign oil de
pendency by 12 million barrels a year, accord
ing to Californians for High Speed Trains, a
coalition of taxpayer, business, environmental
and labor groups.
Critics of Prop. 1A base their arguments on
the sheer expense of the proposition, arguing
that California cannot afford to spend money
when taxpayers are already saddled with a
heavy bond debt. Anti-1 A advocates like Jon
Coupal, the president of the Howard Jarvis
Taxpayer Association, and State Senator Tom
McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) contend tax
payer dollars are better allocated to regional
transit systems and highway construction, em
phasizing the uncertainty of the success of the
rail system and the great expense California
will face if it fails.
Despite these warranted claims, we support
Prop. 1A for its innovative vision for the future
of California. Our state needs to stay at the
forefront of the fight for the environment, and
a high-speed train system would put ('alifornia
on par with the highly successful systems in
Europe and Asia. Despite the expense and risk
of the project, we need forward-looking and
innovative solutions to California's problems.
Ilie editorial board supports Prop. 1 A.
PROPOSITION 2: YES
Prop. 2 would require that calves raised for
veal, egg-laying hens and pregnant pigs be
given enough room in confinement to lie
down, stand up, turn around and spread their
limbs or wings.The veal and pork industries in
California are very small, so Prop. 2 would
mostly affect California's large egg industry.
Most egg-laying hens on industrial farms are
confined in stacked wire "battery cages" that

allow very little room for movement.
Prop. 2 is sponsored mainly by groups such
as the I lumane Society, which argue that cur
rent confinement practices amount to animal
cruelty. It is also supported by the Center for
Food Safety and the California Veterinary
Medical Association. Prop. 2's opposition
comes mainly from egg producers, who fear
that the cost of improving confinement prac
tices will be prohibitive, and consumers who
oppose any increase in egg prices. Claims that
more space will increase the risk of salmonella
have been refuted by the experiences of farms
in Europe and the United States that have al
ready stopped using battery cages.
Although it is true that egg prices will rise,
the increase will be marginal,and the editorial
board recommends voting yes on Prop. 2. The
conditions currently allowed on most industri
al farms are appalling. Vegans and devoted
carnivores alike can agree that animals should
not be treated cruelly,and improving practices
in California could lead to better treatment for
animals across the country. Prop. 2 is also a pos
itive use of the initiative process that allows
voters to overcome the powerful lobbying
forces of corporate farming. If it passes, we can
all feel better the next time we enjoy an omelet
at Sunday brunch.
The editorial board supports Prop. 2.
PROPOSITION 3: YES
Prop. 3, the "Children's I iospital Bond
Act." would authorize $980 million in bonds to
pay for the overhaul of several children's hos
pitals in some of the state's most populous
areas, including San Diego. Orange County,
Los Angeles and San Francisco. Flighty per
cent of the funds would be specifically allocat
ed to hospitals that specialize in a variety of
sicknesses, such as heart defects, cancer and
cystic fibrosis.
Citing a wide array of endorsements, rang
ing from Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger
and California Senator Barbara Boxer to the
California Nurses Association, proponents of
Prop. 3 argue that the measure will improve,
expand and update the state's child health fa
cilities so that they can effectively deal with
California's burgeoning youth population.
Prop. 3 opponents, mainly traditional anti
bond advocates, argue allocating a set number
of dollars to a program holds down money for
future, more essential programs. We believe,
however, that there are few priorities more es
sential than providing for the well-being of the
young.
Ilie editorial board supports Prop. 3.
PROPOSITION 5: YES
Prop. 5, the Nonviolent Offender Rehabili
tation Act. invests $65 million per year into de
veloping the first system of drug treatment
programs for at-risk California youth under IK
who have been convicted of non-violent drug
related offenses, first, it will work to expand
