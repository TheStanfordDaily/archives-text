# ENDORSEMENTS ON CALIF. PROPOSITIONS
## 
### 
The following statements represent the editorial
hoard's views on I Oof the 12 propositions Cal
ifornia residents will vote on today.
PROPOSITION 1A: YES
Prop. 1A authorizes the sale of $9.95 billion
in bonds to build a network of high-speed train
rail lines linking Sacramento and San Diego.
Construction would begin as early as 2011 and
would be the largest public works project in
California history. The project would also be
the first high-speed train system in the United
States. The proposition is to receive equal
funding from state taxpayers, the federal gov
ernment and private investors.
Proponents of IA. including Governor
Schwarzenegger and the Los Angeles and San
Francisco Chambers of Commerce, argue that
the proposition will give a much-needed boost
to California's economy, creating 160.000 con
struction-related jobs and another 450,000
permanent jobs. The train system would also
reduce traffic congestion to help mitigate the
estimated $20 billion in wasted fuel and pro
ductivity that plagues California, which has
three of the five most congested urban areas in
the United States. Hie proposition is also
viewed as an environmental necessity — it
would lower air pollution and greenhouse gas
emissions, while also reducing foreign oil de
pendency by 12 million barrels a year, accord
ing to Californians for High Speed Trains, a
coalition of taxpayer, business, environmental
and labor groups.
Critics of Prop. 1A base their arguments on
the sheer expense of the proposition, arguing
that California cannot afford to spend money
when taxpayers are already saddled with a
heavy bond debt. Anti-1 A advocates like Jon
Coupal, the president of the Howard Jarvis
Taxpayer Association, and State Senator Tom
McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) contend tax
payer dollars are better allocated to regional
transit systems and highway construction, em
phasizing the uncertainty of the success of the
rail system and the great expense California
will face if it fails.
Despite these warranted claims, we support
Prop. 1A for its innovative vision for the future
of California. Our state needs to stay at the
forefront of the fight for the environment, and
a high-speed train system would put ('alifornia
on par with the highly successful systems in
Europe and Asia. Despite the expense and risk
of the project, we need forward-looking and
innovative solutions to California's problems.
Ilie editorial board supports Prop. 1 A.
PROPOSITION 2: YES
Prop. 2 would require that calves raised for
veal, egg-laying hens and pregnant pigs be
given enough room in confinement to lie
down, stand up, turn around and spread their
limbs or wings.The veal and pork industries in
California are very small, so Prop. 2 would
mostly affect California's large egg industry.
Most egg-laying hens on industrial farms are
confined in stacked wire "battery cages" that

allow very little room for movement.
Prop. 2 is sponsored mainly by groups such
as the I lumane Society, which argue that cur
rent confinement practices amount to animal
cruelty. It is also supported by the Center for
Food Safety and the California Veterinary
Medical Association. Prop. 2's opposition
comes mainly from egg producers, who fear
that the cost of improving confinement prac
tices will be prohibitive, and consumers who
oppose any increase in egg prices. Claims that
more space will increase the risk of salmonella
have been refuted by the experiences of farms
in Europe and the United States that have al
ready stopped using battery cages.
Although it is true that egg prices will rise,
the increase will be marginal,and the editorial
board recommends voting yes on Prop. 2. The
conditions currently allowed on most industri
al farms are appalling. Vegans and devoted
carnivores alike can agree that animals should
not be treated cruelly,and improving practices
in California could lead to better treatment for
animals across the country. Prop. 2 is also a pos
itive use of the initiative process that allows
voters to overcome the powerful lobbying
forces of corporate farming. If it passes, we can
all feel better the next time we enjoy an omelet
at Sunday brunch.
The editorial board supports Prop. 2.
PROPOSITION 3: YES
Prop. 3, the "Children's I iospital Bond
Act." would authorize $980 million in bonds to
pay for the overhaul of several children's hos
pitals in some of the state's most populous
areas, including San Diego. Orange County,
Los Angeles and San Francisco. Flighty per
cent of the funds would be specifically allocat
ed to hospitals that specialize in a variety of
sicknesses, such as heart defects, cancer and
cystic fibrosis.
Citing a wide array of endorsements, rang
ing from Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger
and California Senator Barbara Boxer to the
California Nurses Association, proponents of
Prop. 3 argue that the measure will improve,
expand and update the state's child health fa
cilities so that they can effectively deal with
California's burgeoning youth population.
Prop. 3 opponents, mainly traditional anti
bond advocates, argue allocating a set number
of dollars to a program holds down money for
future, more essential programs. We believe,
however, that there are few priorities more es
sential than providing for the well-being of the
young.
Ilie editorial board supports Prop. 3.
PROPOSITION 5: YES
Prop. 5, the Nonviolent Offender Rehabili
tation Act. invests $65 million per year into de
veloping the first system of drug treatment
programs for at-risk California youth under IK
who have been convicted of non-violent drug
related offenses, first, it will work to expand
the current treatment programs that
have been in place since 2(XX)'s Prop.
36. Next, through its three-level sys
tem. it will create tailored care and su
pervision based on the past offenses
and the severity of the crime. With the
integration of both incentives and con
sequences (including jail time) all peo
ple in this program will be encouraged
to complete the suggested treatment.
As comedian and political com
mentator Bill Maher said,"the war on
drugs is over, and drugs won." As it
currently stands, California policy is
failing our youth. When a person
under the age of I <S gets charged with a
drug offense, he or she is herded into
our broken juvenile justice system,
often receiving no treatment for the
drug abuse problem at the root of their
troubles. Prop. 5 will have an impact on
the number of youth who face incar
ceration and unequal punishment for
nonviolent crimes. And building on
the success of Prop. 36. this proposition
will make a significant dent in our
prison overcrowding problem and ef
fectively cut costs.
ITiose who oppose Prop. 5 fear that
it will weaken the punishment for drug
offenders. It is important, however,
that we acknowledge the proposition's
diverse approaches,which include and
are not limited to family therapy and
educational and employment
stipends. Many current California
policies treat criminals on a very strin
gent and binary system: this proposi
tion. on the other hand, aims to ad
dress offenders on a more case-by
case basis. These services seek to ad
dress the roots of the problem, and not
just the symptoms.
The editorial board supports
Prop. 5.
PROPOSITION 6: NO
Prop. 6 would significantly alter the
landscape of criminal justice in the
state of California. Besides setting a
minimum of $965 million to be spent
annually on criminal justice programs
and diverting those funds away from
education, housing and environmental
protection.it would allow 14-year-olds
found guilty of gang-related crimes to
be prosecuted as adults and expand
hearsay as a means of evidence in
criminal trials, among a spate of other
unnecessary and overly punitive ac
tions.
The proposition is supported by the
California Sheriff's Association, San
Diego District Attorney Bonnie Du
manis and a smattering of other law
enforcement organizations and offi
cials from around the state. Its propo
nents argue that it provides much
needed financial support for law en
forcement and that it would serve as a
strong measure against encouraging
youths towards gang activity.
The League of Women Voters and
the California Teacher's Association,
among a wide range of organizations
opposed to Prop. 6. counter that the
measure will adversely affect the poor
and will only increase the state's enor
mous prison rolls by trying eighth
graders as adults. Prop. 6 is an overly
punitive measure that addresses the
symptoms rather than the cause of
gang violence. California already has
some of the harshest anti-gang laws in
the nation.
The editorial board opposes Prop. 6.
PROPOSITION 7: NO
Prop. 7 would amend California
statutes to require utilities, both gov
ernment-owned and private energy
companies, to generate 20 percent of
their power from renewable energy

starting in 2010. Private electrical com
panies are already under this mandate,
but Prop. 7 would extend the require
ment to municipal utilities like the
L.A. Department of Water and Power.
It would raise this requirement to 40
percent by 2020 and 50 percent by
2025, while fast-tracking approval for
new plants that will generate renew
able energy.
Advocates say that approving the
proposition will put California on
course to be a global leader in clean
energy, and create over 370,000 new
high-wage jobs.
But Prop. 7's advocates are few and
far between — the proposition is op
posed by both major political parties,
the state's largest newspapers, major
utility companies including PG&E
and environmental groups like the
Sierra Club of California. This broad
consensus is a good indication that
something is seriously wrong with the
proposition. Opponents claim it will
create logistical and legal nightmares
as both the California Energy Com
mission and the Public Utilities Com
mission will have conflicting regulato
ry powers.
The editorial board opposes
Prop. 7.
PROPOSITION 9: NO
Prop.9will amend both the Califor
nia Constitution and state statutes to
allow victims more opportunities for
input during several phases of the
criminal justice process, including bail,
sentencing and parole. It simultane
ously reduces the number of parole
hearings to which prisoners are enti
tled.
Advocates, including the Califor
nia Coalition of Law Enforcement As
sociations and Crime Victims United
of California, believe the proposition
will save money, sparing the expense
of holding numerous parole hearings
for serious criminals with little chance
of release.
But opponents, which include the
California Democratic Party, the Cali
fornia Teachers Association and the
state's major newspapers, argue that
the proposition would make the crim
inal justice system less equal — cer
tain criminals might receive harsher
punishments just because their partic
ular victims are especially vocal in
pushing for longer imprisonments or
fewer chances for parole.
This type of vendetta justice is a far
cry from a system in which all are
equal before the law. Victims would be
given input regarding bail, but in our
justice system, people are innocent
until proven guilty; allowing an alleged
victim to have input on the judicial sys
tem undermines this concept. Detrac
tors also point out that the beneficial
provisions of Prop. 9, like a mandate
for law enforcement officials to assist
victims in finding counseling and to in
form them of their rights, could easily
be passed by the legislature and not
through an inflexible constitutional
amendment.
The editorial board opposes
Prop. 9.
PROPOSITION 10: NO
Prop. 10 is another proposition with
the potential to significantly alter C ali
fornia's environmental policy. It offers
tax credits to help "consumers and oth
ers" purchase certain fuel-efficient ve
hicles. including natural-gas vehicles,
and to encourage research of renew
able energy technology, especially
solar technology. lTie funding totals up
to some $5 billion dollars in bonds,
which the legislature estimates will cost
about $335 million a year over 30 years.
The proposition is primarily
backed bv the Clean Energy Fuels
Company, which has donated nearly
$10 million to the cause, according to
The San Jose Mercury News.The com

pany, owned by former oil magnate T.
Boone Pickens, stands to profit signifi
cantly if the measure is passed.
The Los Angeles Times editorial
board, which opposes the measure,
pointed out that "nothing in the initia
tive says these trucks have to remain in
California." meaning that individuals
could buy "clean alternative-fuel vehi
cles" in California,sell them elsewhere
and pocket the $50,000 rebate at tax
payer expense. Ultimately, the propo
sition seems to be a costly.self-interest
ed scheme, very ill-advised when Cali
fornia is already deep in debt. And it is
opposed by environmental groups like
the League of Conservation Voters
and the Sierra Club.
The editorial board opposes
Prop. 10.
PROPOSITION 11
Prop. 11. concerning "redisrict
ing." provides for the creation of a new.
bipartisan 14-member commission
with the authority to establish Califor
nia Assembly and Senate election
boundaries. The members would be
selected by a lottery and legislative
leaders that currently control the re
districting process would be stripped
of that power.
The proposition's supporters in
clude Governor Arnold Schwarzeneg
ger and the League of Women Voters.
It has been backed by The Los Ange
les Times and The San Francisco
Chronicle, among a number of other
papers, and is supported across party
lines. The proposition's supporters
want to make redistricting more fair,
so that the party in power does not
simply draw the district to give an in
cumbent advantage.
Prop. 11 is opposed by the Califor
nia Democratic Party, as well as minor
ity advocates like the Mexican-Amer
ican Legal Defense and Education
Fund and the NAACP Defense Fund.
They argue that the newlv-created
commission would be completely un
accountable to voters and that minori
ty communities are not guaranteed
representation in the process.
The proposition has both merits
and drawbacks. The Democratic Party
has a vested interest in maintaining the
status quo; the numerous state news
papers endorsing the measure point
out that the incumbency reelection
rate is 99 percent in recent state elec
tions,and that is largely because the in
cumbent politicians are drawing their
own districts. Taking redistricting out
of their hands will end the insider deals
that ensure this high re-elect rate and
make the system ultimately more
democratic.
The editorial board is concerned,
however, about potential negative im
pact on minority representation in the
government. We unanimously agree
that California needs redistricting. but
we are concerned that the selection of
those in charge of the redistricting
process via lottery will not hold them
sufficiently accountable.
ITie editorial board was split on
Prop. 11 and offers no endorsement.
PROPOSITION 12: YES
Prop. 12.The Veteran's Bond Act of
2(XK would allocate million to
distribute loans to California veterans
in order to help them buy houses and
farms. Unanimously approved by the
State Senate and State Assembly to be
placed on the ballot. Prop. 12 would
give those brave men and women who
put their lives on the line in defense of
this country a chance to build stable
and secure lives outside the military.
The Libertarian Party of California
and Gary Wesley, an attorney in
Mountain View, are listed as the only
two groups opposing the measure in
the California Voter Guide.
The editorial board supports
Prop. 12.
