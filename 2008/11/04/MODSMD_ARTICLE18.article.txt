## At long last, the end 
### 
Today marks the renewal of American
democracy. What separates the vitality
of our democracy from, say. that of
South Africa, is the peaceful transition of
power from one party to another.To a certain
extent, we've already experienced that recent
ly — in 2006. But the presidency is a different
ball game, and it does seem like the Democ
rats are finally going to win it.
All of the media attention in the past few
weeks has been spent looking forward — who
will Obama/McCain appoint? How will they
approach issue X? I low will the transition hap
pen? As we relish the last day of this intense,
exciting campaign, it's important that we un
derstand what we're leaving behind and why
we're so eager to forget the past four years.
It's been two long terms of President
George W Bush, and while he did not get
everything wrong, he came pretty close. He
was right on some issues: free trade, foreign
aid.immigration and eventually. North Korea.
But those accomplishments are far out
weighed by the zealous politici/.ation of non
partisan government positions, rising social
authoritarianism, an open-ended commit
ment in Iraq, gross government mismanage
ment. an enormous and unfunded expansion
of the federal budget and. most importantly, a
declining position internationally.
Bush's greatest failure, however, is not any
thing that he did. It is what he didn't do. We
have had to endure an unprecedented three
years of a lame-duck presidency. Problems re
mained unsolved while Bush hemorrhaged
political capital and prestige. All presidents
enter lame-duck status while in their second
term, but Bush has been completely ineffec

live for the longest amount of time by far.
We have to remember that in 2004 Hush
won the most votes in American history and
won an absolute majority in the popular vote
for the first time since 1 V>S4. John Kerry and
allied 527s raised hundreds of millions of dol
lars, but they could not tip a single swing state.
Mow far he's fallen. From winning (lie
most votes in American history in November
2004. Bush lost all clout and political capital
by the end of 2005 with the spectacular fail
ure of his social security reform. The Democ
ratic landslide of 2006 was largely a referen
dum on his presidency. By the time immigra
tion reform rolled around in June 2007. Bush
could do nothing to prevent its failure in the
Senate. Solvable and pressing problems that
existed three years ago still exist today, and
many more have emerged.
The intense media and public attention on
the campaign has been driven by a weakness
of the presidency. We have been so eager to
look past the second term we gave President
Bush, wishing for the days to pass faster than
ever before. The public debate over the re
sponse to Russia's invasion of Georgia, for ex
ample, was driven largely by the presidential
candidates, not by the president. Bush has not
engaged in a serious congressional initiative in

years. Paulson and Bernanke, not the presi
dent. have driven the response to the financial
crisis. Bush may have signed the bailout, but it
was John McCain that at least attempted to
plav the Republican hero. Military policy in
Iraq and elsewhere has been driven by hvper
competent General Petraeus and Bob Gates,
not by the president.
The weakness of the presidency is un
precedented and indicates the si/.e of the ex
pectations that its next occupant, whoever it
is. will face. Not only will all the egregious
politici/ation and abuses of power have to be
corrected, but the next president will have to
fix the structural weaknesses in the office of
the presidency created by Bush. Obama or
McCain will have to restore the presidency to
its status as a respected policy actor not over
shadowed by cabinet personalities. It will be a
difficult task, but our situation is desperate
and we don't have a choice. We will need a
larger-than-life president to account for
Bush's second-term weakness and failure to
solve some of the country's most pressing
problems.
