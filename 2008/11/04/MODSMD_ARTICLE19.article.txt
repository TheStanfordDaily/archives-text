## Canada, f@*% yeah! 
### 
It s Flection Day in the greatest nation on
Earth. As a friend of mine said, we're all
going to cry tonight, but it has yet to be
determined if our tears constitute a visceral
expression of joy or the whimpering of the
damned.
At such a crucial juncture for our frac
tured country, I want to do my part to bring
us together. And what better way to do that
than to ally us against a common enemy? As
Al-Queda, I le/bollah and Pete Carroll were
all unavailable for personal interviews, I
turned, naturally, towards the True North.
Most of us know Canada only as that in
distinct place to which we keep threatening
to run away, a place where we will ostensibly
be safe from WWJD bracelets, guns and
country music. Friends, it is time to face the
facts: Canada is a real country, with real peo
ple who live there everyday! (They're called
"Socialists.")
Intrigued by this novel idea, 1 approached
several Stanford Canadians for interviews
but was collectively rebuffed. (Read: I sent
them messages on Facebook and got no
reply.) This taught me that all Canadians
hate I lie Daily, the dissemination of knowl
edge and Johannes C Jutenberg.
From here, I could not help but continue
down the path towards enlightenment. After
30 seconds of exhaustive research on Cana
dians and Canadian culture on Wikipedia. I
am now an expert on maple syrup and ice
hockey.
Committed as I am to bringing the truth
to the reading public, I knew that a mere
essay on my findings would not be enough to
convince you of what a superior country we
are. Alter much spiritual and emotional
preparation. I undertook the arduous task of
assuming a Canadian alter ego and inter

viewing myself. Journal to the -ism. babv.
Sure. I'm expecting a call from the Pulit/er
committee, but it's not like I'm waiting by
the phone.
Anyway, here it goes. I, naturally, am
Maverick Jenna, and my pitiful doppel
ganger is identified as "Canuck."
Maverick Jenna: Tell us about a typical
day in the life of a Canadian.
Canuck Jenna: Well
Maverick Jenna: Never mind, I'll tell you.
First you wake up and cry because you don't
live in a real country. After a breakfast of
maple syrup and snow, you walk out your
front yard and promptly get trampled by a
moose. You drag your flattened body to the
hospital, but after waiting in the E.R. for ten
hours, a doctor gives you a state-manufac
tured Advil and tells you to "sleep it off."
lie's very nice about it. Then you return
home to watch Seinfeld reruns dubbed in
French.
Canuck Jenna: Actually —
Maverick Jenna: And that's why all your
music is so emo.
Canuck Jenna: To be honest, I'm rather
happy to be a Canadian. And a big part of
Canadian culture that you didn't mention is
hockey.
Maverick Jenna: Yeah, which is why
"Mighty Ducks" takes place in Canada. Oh.
wait.
Canuck Jenna: We have our own movies
in Canada, too.
Maverick Jenna: I'm sure you do. Back to
important stuff, is it true that your national
mascot is Anne of Green Gables?
Canuck Jenna: No, it's actually a totem
pole.
Maverick Jenna: A totem pole? Serious
ly? Mow in the hell do you expect to intimi

"Canada is a real
country, with real
people who live there..."

date anyone with a totem pole?
( anuck Jenna: We also have a maple leaf.
Is that better?
Maverick Jenna: Do you know what our
national mascot is here in America?
Canuck Jenna: Uh —
Maverick Jenna: FREEDOM!
( anuck Jenna: That's nice. We're free in
Canada, too.
Maverick Jenna: Really. So then, why is
one of your official languages French?
( anuck Jenna: Well, France was among
the first modern countries to institute a par
liamentary system.
Maverick Jenna: Yeah, it was also among
the first modern countries to suck at every
thing! Swish!
("anuck Jenna: Don't you live in the
French I louse?
