# The 						Right Angle
## Capitalist Obama 
### 
I find it ironic that conservatives
call Barack Obama a socialist
since he is perhaps one of the best
political capitalists our nation has
seen. He's run all the way to the
White House with the capital he
gained from his 2004 keynote con
vention speech.
Before 2004. he was a little
known, unaccomplished Illinois leg
islator. In 2004. he became a well
known, unaccomplished U.S. sena
tor. Now in 2008, he is a well-known,
unaccomplished U.S. senator, but
highly accomplished politician. His
campaign is perhaps the most oiled
and well-refined machine in modern
history.
Like oil baron John Rockefeller.
Obama incorporated his opponents
after squashing them. When Joe
Biden ran against Obama in the pri
maries. Biden had said "I don't be
lieve he is [ready].The presidency is
not something that lends itself to on
the-job training." Bill Clinton had re
peatedly challenged Obama's expe
rience and qualifications: "When is
the last time we elected a president
based on one year of service in the
Senate before he started running?"
Now both men are eagerly tooting
Obama's horn on the campaign trail.
I wouldn't be surprised if Obama has
promised to appoint Bill and Hillary
to the Supreme Court if he wins.
While a master of horizontal inte
gration. Obama has also succeeded
in vertically integrating mainstream
media into his campaign. FOX News,
talk radio and a few conservative
newsmagazines are perhaps the only
hold-outs. According to the Pew
Center. 70 percent of people think
the media want Obama to win. com
pared to nine percent who think the
media want McCain. And according
to the Project for Excellence in Jour
nalism. McCain had more than twice
as many negative stories as Obama
and less than half as many positive
ones. Most CEOs would kill for
Obama's media relations office.
Like other great capitalists.
Obama has also managed to manipu
late and exploit labor. He'd make
Wal-Mart proud. He's got several
thousand young people campaigning
for him, getting nothing in return be
sides a higher payroll tax in the fu
ture to help pay for the broken social
security system that he supports.
This election, Obama has raised
$hl)0 million, giving him more than a
2-1 funding advantage over McCain.
He's used most of that money not to
pay his hardworking volunteers or
his own Aunt Zeituni living in a
South Boston slum, but rather on tel
evision advertisements — a strategi-

Ailysiq Finley
callv smart and cost-effective deci
sion. If Obama really believed in
spreading the wealth around, he'd
stop spending millions of dollars on
TV advertisement in these last few
days, racking up his margin of victo
ry. and instead pay the Joe six-packs
volunteering on his campaign — or
at the very least, help support his im
poverished relatives. Maybe he'd
even think about spreading the
wealth around to John McCain, who
surely needs it more than Obama
himself.
While there is no doubt that
Obama is a capitalist, it remains to be
seen just what kind of capitalist he is.
Is he a capitalist in the mold of An
drew Carnegie and John Rocke
feller. ruthless in his drive to destroy
competition, but nevertheless phil
anthropic? According to Investors
Business Daily, Obama got his foot
into the Illinois state legislature by
challenging the African-American
signatures of other candidates in
court and then crushed his oppo
nents for the U.S. Senate seat when
their messy divorce papers got '•mys
teriously" leaked to the press. Ruth
less. indeed. But. perhaps there is
room for compassion.
Many historians and biographers
argue that Carnegie and Rockefeller
used philanthropy to justify their
ruthless ambition and to improve
their public image. Obama seems to
fit the same mold. Hie New York
Times reported that prior to his 2004
Senate campaign. Obama con
tributed about $2,500 (about one
percent of his taxable income) to
charity. By the time his presidential
campaign was well underway in
2007, his charitable contributions
had jumped to $240,000 (about six
percent of his taxable income). You
can connect the dots.
As President. Obama may choose
to spend the massive political capital
that he has accumulated over the
course of this election for "noble"
purposes. The problem is that his
noble purposes require not just polit
ical capital, which belongs to him. but
also monetary capital, which belongs
to taxpayers. While he should be free
to spread his own money around, he
shouldn't be free to take other peo
ple's money and spread it around.
That just wouldn't jibe with his capi
talistic campaign.
