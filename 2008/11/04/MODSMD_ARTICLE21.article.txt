## The
						importance of healthcare in this election 
### 
With a $7(X) billion bailout, a
volatile stock market and ris
ing unemployment hogging
the headlines, it's easy to forget about
the healthcare calamity facing this
country.
But a look at the numbers should
shift your focus. In 2(X)X.the American
government will spend $1.1 trillion on
medical care, $4(X) billion more than
the price tag for saving Wall Street. By
2016. when an Obama or McCain ad
ministration would be finishing its sec
ond term,this figure is projected to top
$2 trillion dollars a year, almost three
times as large as the bailout.
Maybe you have already cast your
vote. If you haven't, consider voting
not only for who you think can man
age a $7(X) billion bailout,but also $1.1
trillion in government healthcare in
2(X)8.52 trillion in 2016, and of course,
your health over the next four or even
eight years.
Most Americans spend a lot on
healthcare, and get a lot in return. But
some Americans get very little. In a
country that spends over a trillion dol
lars on health care each year. 47 mil
lion Americans remain uninsured. It is
disgraceful when all America can offer
its citizens is the Internet. Advil and.as
a last resort.an emergency room visit.
We can do better.and we don't need to

copy the Canadian or French systems
to do so.
For those 47 million uninsured,
Obama's Health Insurance Exchange
will make sure they are offered the op
portunity to enroll in a government
administered health plan modeled
after the plan available to members of
Congress. Low-income families will
receive a subsidy so care is affordable.
ITie Exchange will not force out pri
vate insurers, but to participate, pri
vate insurers will have to follow some
commonsense standards: guaranteed
issuance to all applications regardless
of their health history, quality mini
mums so that expectant mothers and
the mentally ill get appropriate treat
ment and community rating, which
means that men and women, young
and old pay the same price for care.
Competition between public and
private health insurance will improve
quality and reduce costs. The govern
ment plan will be forced to operate ef
ficiently. with short wait times and
minimal bureaucracy, or risk losing
enrollees to the private systems. The
logical standards will force profit
seeking private insurers to make their
money by reducing wasteful spending
and administrative costs, rather than
by denying coverage and rejecting
claims.

If you already are covered under
employer-based healthcare. Obama's
plan won't change much. You will not
be forced into a public insurance pro
gram. In fact, small employers will re
ceive government subsidies to provide
health insurance, expanding access to
employer-based coverage.
In contrast to Obama's approach
of using competition between a new
public system and existing private in
surers to get you the best deal. John
McCain is proposing a complete over
haul of the tax treatment of health in
surance. For over a quarter century,
the government has subsidized health
insurance by exempting it from the
taxes that both employers and em
ployees pay on wage income. McCain
wants to replace this time-tested sys
tem with a lump-sum tax credit of
$S.(XX) for a family and $2.5(X) for an
individual that can be used either for
health insurance provided through
work or in the individual health insur
ance market. This reduces the incen
tive for and ability of families to pur
chase more generous plans if they
don't need them — and if they do.
McCain's tax credit is designed for
portability, allowing families to receive
the same tax treatment if they choose
coverage in the individual market over
employer-based coverage. While this

might sound benign or even favorable,
it could play out very badly. Since they
cost the least to cover, the young and
healthy have the biggest incentive to
skip employer-based coverage for the
individual market where they can pur
chase inexpensive policies. The exit of
these low-cost workers will push up
premiums for everyone else,encourag
ing the moderately healthy to exit for
the individual market. In the worst
case scenario, this could lead to an un
raveling of employer-based health in
surance, what economists call an ad
verse selection death spiral, leaving
those who need health insurance the
least able to afford it.
We don't know the odds of this
worst-case scenario but, given the
mess we're facing on Wall Street, it
doesn't seem like the type of risk that
we need to be taking right now. So
when you vote, ask yourself, which
plan would you prefer for you, your
siblings — or even your parents:
Barack Obama's plan for managed
competition or John McCain's com
plete tax overhaul? The last thing we
and our families can afford is a Mc-
Cain gamble.
