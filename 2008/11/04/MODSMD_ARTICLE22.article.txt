GAME NOTES.' The No. 5 Stanford women rolled over
their conference rivals to the north, sweeping both the
No. 6 Huskies and Cougars over the weekend. Stan
ford was led against Washington by seniors Cynthia
Barboza and Foluke Akinradewo, who notched 14
and 12 kills, respectively. Two nights later against
WSU, sophomore libera Gabi Ailes took center stage,
recording 19 digs to lead the Cardinal defensively in
perhaps the best match of her collegiate career so far.

I"he Stanford women's volleyball team
set the stage and landed the knockout blow
in a weekend of offensive explosions for
Cardinal athletics. Unfortunately for the
state of Washington, this was accomplished
at the expense of its two best-known uni
versities.
The No. 5 Cardinal (19-3.10-1 Pacific 10
Conference) breezed past No. 6 Washing
ton and Washington State, sweeping the
teams for the second time this season in im
pressive fashion. Stanford showed no signs
of fatigue upon returning home from a road
trip in Los Angeles.
Friday night's game against Washington
had the makings of a thriller. The Cardinal
and Huskies came into the match ranked
fifth and sixth in the country, respectively.
The Washington women entered the con
test with a chip on their shoulders, having
been embarrassed 3-0 by Stanford at home
on Oct. 5.
But Stanford's hitters proved too domi
nant for Washington's front line and left the
Huskies with no chance for redemption.
Freshman Alix Klineman and seniors Cyn
thia Barboza and Foluke Akinradewo all
finished the day with double digit kills. Bar
boza was especially impressive for the sec
ond weekend in a row. notching a double
double relatively early in the match.
Stanford coach John Dunning knew be
fore the weekend that his team had a lot of
talent on the offensive side of the net, but
was nevertheless pleased to see it produce
at such a high level.
"Definitely one of the things about our
team that is very positive is that we have
several hitters that are capable of just going
off," Dunning said. "We're all looking for
ward to days when we'll all be on at the
same time. [Our hitters] had big matches
for us and [it] shows that we have a lot of
weapons."
Despite dismantling the Huskies 25-22,
25-23, 25-18, the Cardinal's performance
was subpar on paper — the team's hitting
percentage was below .300. Stanford com
pensated for its miscues with solid defense,
holding Washington to a meager .214 hit
ting percentage.
The Huskies, who came into the game
third in the Pac-10, looked to vault them
selves into a tight race with Stanford and
Cal for the top spot in the conference stand
ings. With the win, the Cardinal solidified its
ranking and put extra pressure on archrival
Cal as the season winds down.
The Cougars followed the Huskies on
Sunday afternoon at Maples Pavilion, but
for them, the story was different. Washing
ton State entered the day winless in the
Pac-10.
The Stanford women did not sleep on
their struggling visitors: instead, they put
the Cougars to sleep.The Cardinal won eas
ily, 25-12,25-19,25-22. The offense was once
again on the ball, hitting .404 for the match.
But the story of the afternoon was oft
overlooked sophomore Gabi Ailes. Hie
