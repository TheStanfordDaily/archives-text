Neither the rain nor the California field
hockey squad could stop Stanford this week
end.The Cardinal scored a huge upset by beat
ing No. 16 Cal, 2-1. The victory was particular
ly sweet in that it marked the last home game
for the team's seniors. It was an emotional
game, as Chloe Bade's. Bailey Richardson's
and Hillary Braun's family members had all
gathered to commemorate Senior Day.
The fans were soaked and puddles of water
on the field made it difficult to run, but nothing

could stop the Cardinal on Saturday. Stan
ford's attitude was in opposition to the dark
weather — the team's enthusiasm and passion
was apparent from the moment it hit the field.
"I have never played in conditions like that
before," said Richardson, who was speaking
from over three years of experience playing on
The Farm."lt was miserable. It was actually the
first time I played in a game at Stanford in the
rain and our field did not cope well."
But Richardson and her teammates quick
ly adapted to the adverse conditions despite
the "puddles galore," according to the senior.
"It really made the game messy and a bit
slower than usual, but we'll take it," she said.
In addition to the less-than-ideal weather
conditions, junior Midori IJehara, Stanford's
leading scorer, had to play the game in a face
mask. Uehara suffered an injury to her fore

head during Friday's practice, and the cut re
quired ten stitches to close. Despite the injury
and the mask, which limited her visibility, Ue
hara came into the match in the 50th minute.
Within three minutes she had scored her ninth
goal of the year. Uehara's score tied the match
at one,giving the Cardinal a new surge of hope.
In what was already an emotional day there
was even more intensity from the home side
because the match was a must win for the Car
dinal.
"My last game at home was a lot more emo
tional than I anticipated," Richardson said.
"Nothing compares to actually walking out
onto the field with your parents before the
game and seeing your mom, dad, teammates
and classmates tear up, not to mention crying
yourself. Our [head] coach [Lesley
Irvine] said in the pre-game speech
that Hillary [Braun], Chloe [Bade]
and I played our first game for Stan
ford on August 27, 2005 against
Miami of Ohio. We really came full
circle — that day we lost our first
ever game in overtime, and today we
won our last home game in overtime
against our archrivals."
The winning goal against the
Bears was scored by junior Nora
Soza. her first of the year. Soza was
forced to sit out all of last season
with an injury, but she made her
presence felt on Saturday. Soza
scored four minutes into the first
overtime, lifting the Cardinal to the
victory over Cal.
Emotions ran high throughout
the contest, and both squads played
with aggression and passion. The
Stanford women say they thrive on
the intensity.
"It was a dream to play Cal on my
senior day." said Richardson, a na
tive of Los Gatos, Calif. "As a Stan
ford player,nothing is more exciting.
Especially for local girls like myself,
we have been competing against
many of the Cal players since high

school and have quite a history with
each other. In part because of all of
the intense emotions and the sloppy
conditions, the game got really phys
ical. Cal received a green card — a
warning, and 2 yellow cards, which
send players off the field. In normal
games, no cards are awarded."
But the Bears physical play just
gave Stanford extra incentive to
come away with a victory.
"Needless to say, it was great to
win such an aggressive, emotionally
charged match." Richardson added.
Next up. Stanford heads to the
NorPac Tournament in Farmville,
Va.The conference champion will be
determined there this weekend.
Stanford will enter the competition
as the No. 2 seed — meaning it
would not have to face Cal. should
the Bears advance, until the champi
onship game.
With Saturday's big win, the Stan
ford women say they are ready to
take on the best teams in the confer
ence. Early season losses seemed
like huge setbacks at the time, but
they have also given the Cardinal
added inspiration.
When the NorPac Tournament
begins on Thursday. Stanford's re
newed passion and intensity will cer
tainly be tested.
