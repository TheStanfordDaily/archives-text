Neither the rain nor the California field
hockey squad could stop Stanford this week
end.The Cardinal scored a huge upset by beat
ing No. 16 Cal, 2-1. The victory was particular
ly sweet in that it marked the last home game
for the team's seniors. It was an emotional
game, as Chloe Bade's. Bailey Richardson's
and Hillary Braun's family members had all
gathered to commemorate Senior Day.
The fans were soaked and puddles of water
on the field made it difficult to run, but nothing

could stop the Cardinal on Saturday. Stan
ford's attitude was in opposition to the dark
weather â€” the team's enthusiasm and passion
was apparent from the moment it hit the field.
"I have never played in conditions like that
before," said Richardson, who was speaking
from over three years of experience playing on
The Farm."lt was miserable. It was actually the
first time I played in a game at Stanford in the
rain and our field did not cope well."
But Richardson and her teammates quick
ly adapted to the adverse conditions despite
the "puddles galore," according to the senior.
"It really made the game messy and a bit
slower than usual, but we'll take it," she said.
In addition to the less-than-ideal weather
conditions, junior Midori IJehara, Stanford's
leading scorer, had to play the game in a face
mask. Uehara suffered an injury to her fore

head during Friday's practice, and the cut re
quired ten stitches to close. Despite the injury
and the mask, which limited her visibility, Ue
hara came into the match in the 50th minute.
Within three minutes she had scored her ninth
goal of the year. Uehara's score tied the match
at one,giving the Cardinal a new surge of hope.
In what was already an emotional day there
was even more intensity from the home side
because the match was a must win for the Car
dinal.
"My last game at home was a lot more emo
tional than I anticipated," Richardson said.
"Nothing compares to actually walking out
onto the field with your parents before the
game and seeing your mom, dad, teammates
and classmates tear up, not to mention crying
