# Cougars' QB moves baffling
## 
### 
I don't like to kick teams when
they're down — and Washing
ton State hasn't been this low in
decades — hut 1 have to question
Cougars' coach Paul Wulff's quar
terback usage against Stanford on
Saturday.
In the days leading up to the
game, Wulff declared that he was
going to remove freshman J.T. Lev
enseller's redshirt. It was a monu
mental decision. WSU was already
well past the year's halfway mark,
and. having just lost 69-0 to USC at
home to push their record to 1-7.
the Cougars were going absolutely
nowhere. Wulff could have sat Lev
enseller, who the Cougars have
high hopes for in the future, for the
rest of the season and in the
process, earned him an extra year
of eligibility.
But injuries forced Wulff's hand
— practically every single Cougars
quarterback has been injured at
some point in the season. First,
starter Gary Rogers suffered a vi
cious hit against Portland State that
resulted in fractured cervical verte
brae. It nearly paralyzed him and
all but ended his college career. In
the same game. Rogers's backup,
Kevin Lopina, broke his back.
Third-string quarterback Marshall
Lobbestael took over but tore both
his ACL and MCL against Oregon
State three weeks later.
Daniel Wagner was at best
shaky in relief of Lobbestael. For
tunately for WSU, Lopina was
cleared to play against USC". But he
was clearly not 100%, and his only
backups were Wagner and Peter
Roberts — a scout team quarter
back who won an open, campus
wide tryout for a reserve job in
early October. Lopina threw only
nine passes against the Trojans; it
was clear something had to be
done.
Enter Levenseller, the son of the
Cougars' wide receivers' coach and
a player whose redshirt Wulff was
trying desperately to preserve. But
with no other options, Wulff pulled
Levenseller's redshirt.
It must be stressed how serious
ly Wulff took this decision. It wasn't
an impulsive, spur of the moment
choice — much different than, for
instance, former Washington head
coach Tyrone Willingham's deci
sion to throw away a freshman re
ceiver's redshirt, seemingly on a
whim. Wulff conferred with his
coaches — including Levenseller's
father — throughout the process.
In the end. they reached a verdict:
Levenseller would be Lopina's pri
mary backup against Stanford, and
would likely get into the action.
I was in Wulff's corner up to this
point.The thoughtfulness shown by
Wulff throughout his interviews
demonstrated that he hadn't taken
this decision lightly. But, if Lev
enseller was going to be activated, I
assumed his coach would actually
use him. He would take at least a
decent amount of the Cougars'
snaps.
I was wrong.
Instead. Lopina played practi
cally the entire game. Levenseller
made it in for three drives — one
of which ended on a Logwone Mitz
fumble on the first play — and that
was it. He finished with about five
minutes of total playing time and
threw just four passes.
WSU was never in the game.and
Lopina was devastatingly bad
he threw for two interceptions and
could get nothing going on offense.
His play was obviously diminished
by the lingering back injury: his
passes lacked any zip whatsoever,
and he (drastically) underthrew his
receivers at least four times. Addi
tionally, the Cougars run a spread
offense, and the hobbled Lopina
could get nothing going on the
ground.
In contrast, in limited time, Lev
enseller showed why he's regarded
so highly by the WSU coaching
staff. His passes were quick and ac
curate and all but one hit the re
ceiver square on the hands. A
three-sport athlete in high school,
Levenseller was able to keep plays

Between the lines
alive with his athleticism. He was
certainly raw and by no means per
fect, hut he was the better option
compared to a crippled Lopina.
With this season over, Wulff has
to look out of the long-term health
of his team. Risking an injury to
Levenseller in a rainstorm against
a ferocious Stanford defense does
n't exactly fit that plan. But this
isn't the preseason, and Lev
enseller isn't Peyton Manning.The
experience to be gained from play
ing in inclement weather is invalu
able to a young quarterback — es
pecially one you think may be your
team's leader down the line. And
Levenseller put the Cougars in a
better position to succeed on Sat
urday than Lopina.
Wulff made the right decision in
pulling Levenseller's redshirt. But
now that it is officially off, he must
utilize his young quarterback and
make the decision worth it.

Wyndam Makowsky is hoping that
the coach of his intramural flag foot
ball team doesn t take his redshirt this
season. Contact him at makowsky@
