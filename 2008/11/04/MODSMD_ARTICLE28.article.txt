Stanford men's swimming opened its slate of Pacific
-10 Conference competition with a 134-70 win on Friday
against Washington. The Cardinal showed off its talent
and depth through all four classes — something they will
need as they pursue their 29th consecutive Pac-10 cham
pionship.
In the opening 200 yard medley relay. Stanford's "A"
team of junior Eugene Godsoe. senior Paul Kornfeld,
sophomore Austin Staab and senior Jason Dunford took
first place with a time of 1:30.54. The Washington relay
finished three seconds back — a huge margin of victory
for such a short race.
In the following event, the 1000 yard freestyle, fresh
man Chad LaTourette out-touched Washington senior
Scott Spansail. The Husky senior won the event at last
year's dual meet, but LaTourette came from behind this
year to grab the win.
LaTourette's performance was a great example of the
effort the team expects from its underclassmen.
"Freshmen showed key places where they can be of
great value to us. where we need them to step up." senior
co-captain Nate Cass said. "The 1000 free where Chad
[LaTourette] ran down Scott Spansail — that was great."
Sophomore Alex Coville made a strong return to the
pool, swimming for the Cardinal for the first time since
suffering a shoulder injury and missing most of last sea
son. Coville won the 50 yard freestyle in 20.81 seconds.
Later, Cass followed with an individual event win in
the 200 individual medley with a time of 1:51.97. Senior
co-captain Jason Dunford won the 100 freestyle in 44.70,
a quick time for an early-season meet. Fellow senior and
co-captain Paul Kornfeld won the 200 breaststroke in
2:03.95.
The underclassmen showed off their talents, too.
Freshman Bobby Bollier made perhaps the biggest
splash of the meet, running away with a victory in the 200
butterfly. He touched the wall at 1:49.12. close to a
NCAA "B"qualification.
"Bobby had a great 200 butterfly," Dunford said. "He
will be a key athlete for us this year."
Junior Eugene Godsoe also stood out on Friday. God
soe paced the field in the 200 backstroke, finishing first at
1:47.88.The team thinks the longer backstroke event will
be a strong suit this year. Godsoe as well as freshman Ge
offrey Cheah. who finished in second behind Godsoe.
have shown a lot of potential in the event.
"It was really encouraging to have Eugene [Godsoe]

and Geoffrey [Cheah]," Dunford said.
And. in a meet where the Stanford men focused less
on times and more on fundamentals. Cass thinks the
work they have put in is already paying off.
"[Cheah] set up a beautiful race in the backstroke,"
Cass added. "To get to wall under 1:50, to get second
place — those are indicators of what the freshmen can
do. and how they can help us."
In their opening meet of the season at Avery Aquatic
Center, the team was happy with the result — a win — as
well as the manner in which il happened.
"We did a good job of coming out strong against a Pac-10
foe." Cass said. "And we had some special performances
from some people."
Stanford next faces cross-Bay rival California on
Wednesday Nov. 12 in the annual "triple distance" meet.
"It is a friendly meet." Dunford said, referring to the
fact that the scores are not tallied for a winner and loser.
"It will be interesting how people perform; there will be
some close races."
