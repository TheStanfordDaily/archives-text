# Students call for chief's dismissal
## Palo Alto Police chief's racial profiling remarks draw criticism at city council meeting 
### DEVIN BANERJEE MANAGING EDITOR 
More than 50 African-American Stanford
students attended last night's Palo Alto City
Council meeting, where several community
members called for the resignation of Police
Chief Lynne Johnson over previous state
ments she made that appeared to condone
racial profiling.
City Manager James Keene. who controls
Johnson's employment, told The Daily after
last night's meeting that he is giving Johnson
a chance to "reclaim her standing and reputa
tion" in the city. Still, Keene said last
"Thursday's comments by the police chief indi
cated a lapse in the leadership required of
someone in her position.
"Effective and accurate communication is
a requirement of leadership." he said, "and
obviously that was clearly not demonstrated."
Addressing the council last night. Johnson
again apologized for all statements she made
at ITiursday's meeting, which was called to
address the recent trend in city crime.
"I did not. nor would I ever, instruct my
officers to stop any person based solely upon
the color of their skin or their ethnicity,"
Johnson stated slowly in the silent council

chambers. "That is racial profiling, which is
unconstitutional, illegal and violates our city
policy and our core values at the police
department — it is just wrong."
But for many students, apologies aren't
cutting it.
"[Her Friday] apology was wholly inade
quate because it's clear that there was
offense," said Kenneth Gibbs. an African
American and fourth-year graduate student
in immunology, before the meeting. "You can
get over hurt feelings, but the real issue is
whether or not the police department has
been racially profiling."
"We don't want apologies, but we want the
proper steps to make sure those policies are
not going to be in place." added Tracy
Holmes, an African American and fourth
year graduate student in chemical engineer
ing.
Johnson laid out the foundation of what
she called a "specific action plan" that will be
developed over the next two weeks. The plan
includes visits to East Palo Alto and Palo Alto
church congregations, a meeting with her staff
today, coordination with the East Palo Alto
Police Department and a future visit to
Stanford to speak with students.
"I want to hear the concerns of the

Stanford students," Johnson told The Daily at
the meeting. "I want to share with them and
get ideas about how we move forward from
where we are right now."
The police chief said she is in contact with
LaDoris Cordell. a member of University
President John Hennessy's staff, and
Associate Vice Provost Sally Dickson. An
African American herself. Dickson told The
Daily before the meeting that she "was very
disappointed and surprised" upon hearing
Johnson's initial statements.
Several of the Stanford students in atten
dance addressed the council during its open
communication session, offering recommen
dations for the chief and her department.
Matthew Miller '12 brought Barack
Obama into the discussion.
"Chief Johnson's language suggested that
if a man who might be elected President of
The United States of America were at or
around the Caltrain station, he too might be
unjustly questioned for the simple color of his
skin," Miller told the council. "Her position
and her authority means she must be careful
with her words."
Michael Tubbs '12 said the first step to
solving "the problem" in the police depart
ment would be to admit that racial profiling

exists.
Anthony Darrington. senior pastor at
Jerusalem Baptist Church — where Johnson
spent several hours on Sunday, speaking with
members of the congregation — called for
the police chiefs resignation. Darrington
believes Johnson is not racist, but needs to be
more responsible.
Still, a few Palo Alto residents defended
the police chief.
Bob Moss, who has known Johnson for
more than 20 years, said she misspoke, and
"people do that at times." Moss denounced
racial profiling, but said it's easy to stop an
African-American male in error if statistics
reveal that the majority of crimes are carried
out by blacks.
"That's not the way it should be done." he
said, "but it's easy to make that error."
In statements to the council. Keene said
that, as city manager, he has commissioned an
independent police auditor to examine the
police department's policies. Keene said he
will also reach out to Palo Alto employers and
employees to review their policies on racial
profiling.
