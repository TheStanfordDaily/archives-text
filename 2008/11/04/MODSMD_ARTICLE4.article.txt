# ELECTION '08
## Newsom speaks against Prop. 8 San Francisco mayor addresses gay marriage, importance of vote 
### KAMIL DADA DESK EDITOR 
Gavin Newsom, the current mayor of San Francisco,
spoke at the "No on Prop. 8. Yes on Obama" rally on
Monday afternoon at Old Union. Newsom was elected
mayor in 2003 and quickly reached national significance
in 2004 when he issued a directive permitting marriage
licenses for same-sex couples.
The Daily spoke with Newsom to discuss his reasons
for riling up the crowd and for disagreeing with
Proposition 8, a state constitutional amendment that
would eliminate the right of same-sex couples to marry in
California.
The Stanford Daily (SD): Why did you decide to come
to Stanford on the day before the election? Would the
battle to win voters have better been fought in a location
that had more Republicans or undecided voters?
Gavin Newsom (GN): Wc have been traveling a lot,
and I've been up and down the state. 1 visited Long
Beach, Anaheim, L.A.. Sacramento, Marin County. San
Mateo County, Santa Clara County, Palo Alto area, Santa
Cruz last week.
SI): What are you aiming to achieve on your travels?
Why did you attend the rally at Stanford?
GN: It is important to remind people what's at stake
and to make sure that we actually vote. It is an old cliche
but it's true — polls have never voted in the history of
mankind. No poll has ever voted. People vote, polls don't
vote.
If we don't vote, we may wake up. not only with the
president that we don't want, but with our rights taken
away, and really that's what's at stake. Prop. 8 takes rights
away that have been legally afforded. That is something
that in my lifetime has never been done. That is not
something that we are going to look at with any pride. In
fact, it would be a real shame that this state would be the
first state ever to take rights away from people by chang
ing the constitution; that is the principle point.
SI): What about prohibition in the 19205? Prohibition
was introduced by an amendment to the Constitution.
How is Prop. 8 different?
GN: Prohibition is one exception. That was just drink
ing, that was hardly a notion of human rights or civil
rights. In this case, it is taking someone's civil rights away.
[Prop. 8 is about] their basic right to enter an institution
that everyone else can enter into. That would be a pretty
remarkable thing and would hurt this state for years to
come.
SI): Let's move on to the economy, which has become
increasingly important in this election given the recent
financial meltdown. Do you believe that a yes vote on
Prop. 8 could negatively impact California's economy?
I low?
GN: I recently received an interesting letter from a lot
of leaders in the science and biotechnology fields who
really feared Prop. 8 passing because they felt that it
would hurt their ability to attract
talent. They believe very specifically
and appropriately that
Massachusetts will be the biggest
beneficiary.
Massachusetts currently allows
same-sex marriages and is a state
that is beating us in terms of human
capital already. Prop. <S will he
another nail in that coffin. I am very
concerned about our economic
position, as our ability to attract tal
ent is predicated upon the belief
that we are all in this together.
Tolerance, diversity — it's our com
petitive strength. It's what defines
the best of California. That is at risk
of being eroded here, along with the
notion of tolerance and advancing
the principles of diversity and inclu
sivity. That will be eroded if Prop. K
passed. I have got to remind people
that even after people think it is
over on the presidential side, it is
not over on the initiative side.
People need to turn up to cast that
ballot, even if it is late in the day.
SI): In 2004. you began to illegal
ly issue marriage licenses to same -
ex couples. 'ITie courts struck you
down, many in the Democratic
Party distanced themselves from
you and numerous political leaders
puhlically disagreed with your
actions. Why did you decide to begin
issuing marriage licenses, and do
you have any reservations?
GN: I have no reservations. Guys
like me come and go. Politicians are
a dime a dozen. I don't want to be a
robot. I don't want to sit there pas
sively. I want to actually make a dif
ference and fight for principles I
believe in. and I want to fight for
people. It's why I got into politics. I
couldn't care less about my political

career. I have money and am happy
to fight outside elected office for
things I believe in.
SI): What happened when the
California Supreme Court inter
vened and ordered San Francisco to
stop issuing licenses to same-sex
couples?
GN: When the courts told me to
stop. 1 stopped. The rule of law
worked. Had 1 broken that lost
covenant. I would have lost moral
authority. One will argue whether or
not I have moral authority in the
context of something I believe in.
but I think that any time someone
stands up to something they believe
in. they do have the principle of
moral authority. But it would have
been wrong to have just walked
down a path that was in complete
contrast with that court decision.
Challenging the law is a civil right.
The history of the civil rights move
ment has always been marked by
people challenging the law. I
thought it was necessary at the time
in order to awaken people and
awaken their consciousness about
what the issues were all about.
SI): Since it is crucial that voters
actually reach the voting booths on
Election Day, do you think that the
day should be a public holiday?
More specifically, are you enacting
any rules to make it easier for voters
to cast their ballot?
GIN: That's a great question. I've
always thought we should consider
elections on weekends or over mul
tiple days, not one day exclusively.
I'm very proud of what we do in San
Francisco by opening up our doors a
month in advance and we do early
voting. I think it is really important
that we consider extending the early
voting opportunity — we're already
doing it. why not do more of it? In
order to accommodate for people's
schedules or their lives, it is very dif
ficult for everyone on the exact
same day regardless of what project

they are working on. case they're lit
igating or what time of year it is as
some people may he on vacation. To
put all that aside to vote on one spe
cific day can be difficult.
SI): What is your view on absen
tee voting? Many people, including
a large percentage of students at
Stanford, have already cast their
votes by mail. Would you like to see
this expanded? How will absentee
voting affect the ejection?
GN: Absentee voting allows peo
ple to vote [even if they] do not live
in the area that they are registered
in and is obviously important.
However, going back to your ques
tion about public holidays, we need
to accommodate for people's sched
ule on more than one day. That's
why city hall has so many people in
line every day. In terms of absentee
voting: Yes. a lot of people already
voted. Fifteen percent of people
have voted before Election Day It's
extraordinary So the election in
some ways may already have been
decided, we just don't know yet. It
depends who voted.
