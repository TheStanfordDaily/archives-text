# ELECTION '08
## Newsom speaks against Prop. 8 San Francisco mayor addresses gay marriage, importance of vote 
### KAMIL DADA DESK EDITOR 
Gavin Newsom, the current mayor of San Francisco,
spoke at the "No on Prop. 8. Yes on Obama" rally on
Monday afternoon at Old Union. Newsom was elected
mayor in 2003 and quickly reached national significance
in 2004 when he issued a directive permitting marriage
licenses for same-sex couples.
The Daily spoke with Newsom to discuss his reasons
for riling up the crowd and for disagreeing with
Proposition 8, a state constitutional amendment that
would eliminate the right of same-sex couples to marry in
California.
The Stanford Daily (SD): Why did you decide to come
to Stanford on the day before the election? Would the
battle to win voters have better been fought in a location
that had more Republicans or undecided voters?
Gavin Newsom (GN): Wc have been traveling a lot,
and I've been up and down the state. 1 visited Long
Beach, Anaheim, L.A.. Sacramento, Marin County. San
Mateo County, Santa Clara County, Palo Alto area, Santa
Cruz last week.
SI): What are you aiming to achieve on your travels?
Why did you attend the rally at Stanford?
GN: It is important to remind people what's at stake
and to make sure that we actually vote. It is an old cliche
but it's true â€” polls have never voted in the history of
mankind. No poll has ever voted. People vote, polls don't
vote.
If we don't vote, we may wake up. not only with the
president that we don't want, but with our rights taken
away, and really that's what's at stake. Prop. 8 takes rights
away that have been legally afforded. That is something
that in my lifetime has never been done. That is not
something that we are going to look at with any pride. In
fact, it would be a real shame that this state would be the
first state ever to take rights away from people by chang
ing the constitution; that is the principle point.
SI): What about prohibition in the 19205? Prohibition
was introduced by an amendment to the Constitution.
How is Prop. 8 different?
GN: Prohibition is one exception. That was just drink
ing, that was hardly a notion of human rights or civil
rights. In this case, it is taking someone's civil rights away.
[Prop. 8 is about] their basic right to enter an institution
that everyone else can enter into. That would be a pretty
remarkable thing and would hurt this state for years to
come.
SI): Let's move on to the economy, which has become
increasingly important in this election given the recent
financial meltdown. Do you believe that a yes vote on
Prop. 8 could negatively impact California's economy?
I low?
GN: I recently received an interesting letter from a lot
of leaders in the science and biotechnology fields who
really feared Prop. 8 passing because they felt that it
