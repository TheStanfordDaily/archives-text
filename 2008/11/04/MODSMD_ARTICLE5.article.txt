# ELECTION '08
## Leaders rally students to the polls 
### KAMIL DADA DESK EDITOR 
Approximately 2(H) students gath
ered outside Old Union on Monday
afternoon at an event intended to rally
the campus in favor of Democratic
Presidential Candidate Barack Obama
and in opposition to Proposition 8, a
state constitutional amendment that
would eliminate the right of same-sex
couples to marry in California.
Speakers at the event included San
Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom,
Stanford Law Professor Larry Marshall
and former State Controller Steve
Westly *78.
Westly, who is the California cam
paign co-chair for Obama for America
and is a member of the campaign's
finance committee,played heavily to the
home crowd and spoke of his memories
of Stanford.
"Let's cheer loudly for Obama," he
said. "1 want everyone in Stern Hall —
Ciod help them — to hear us cheer. And
let's have another cheer for Branner
while we are at it. 1 remember that when
I was student body president,about 2(KH)
students took over [Old Union] to rally
against apartheid in South Africa. Never
underestimate the strength of student
rallies."

Newsom. on the other hand, started
his talk by addressing the controversial
ballot initiative that would ban same-sex
marriages in California. In a stinging
rebuke of the on-campus supporters of
Prop. 8. Newsom noted that he couldn't
understand the logic of people who sup
ported the proposition.
"I can't believe that in 2(X)8 there are
people out there saying that 'let's take
rights away from other people,"' he said.
"How would they feel if their rights were
taken away? If you can take away rights
from line section of society, then you can
take rights away from other groups as
well."
Newsom proceeded to address the
crowd about the need to defeat Prop. 8.
"Millions of people are counting on
us to get it right." he said. "Prop. 8 is a
fight that no one wanted to fight. We
don't want to write decisions into the
Constitution that will remove civil
rights."
Newsom compared same-sex mar
riages to interracial marriages. I le elud
ed the case of Richard Loving (a white
man) and Mildred Loving (a black
woman) who were sentenced to one
year in prison in 1%7 because they
decided to marry.
"The Lovings
were sentenced to I

one year in prison just because they had
the audacity to fall in love with someone
of a different race." he said. "This is not
history. This was in my life. It was the
year of my birth."
Ashwin Mudaliar '(W. president of
the Stanford Democrats, noted that the
rally had been in the making for a couple
of months.
"There have been many plans for this
event going back into the summer," he
said. "It was debated over who we would
bring to campus. We were close to get
ting will.i.am. the lead singer of Black
Eyed Peas, but he cancelled at the last
minute due to scheduling issues."
Marshall appealed to students and
urged them to consider the importance
of the historical significance of today's
election.
"I fear that you don't understand the
magnitude of what this election is." he
said. "You need to see how different this
election really is. This is between choos
ing the status quo as we inherited it and
choosing a different world."
Marshall also encouraged students to
prioritize their activities on Election
Day.
"Since I am a faculty member here. 1
am not going to tell you to skip class and

not to do your work," he said. "But if
you don't act creatively, it will be a
moment you will regret."
Westly added that the election was
far from over.
"You can't be complacent," he
said."lt is not over now. It is just start
ing.
"If you can still get in a car and
drive to Nevada — Go!," he contin
ued. "You can still he a critical role
that can shape the future of this elec
tion. This is showtime."
Bipartisan concerns
The rally raised some eyebrows in
the Office of Student Affairs (OSA),
however, about the potential biparti
san nature of the event.
Patrick Cordova '09 noted that he
was the event sponsor and explained
how Associate Dean and Director of
Student Activities Nanci Howe
expressed her concerns about the
event.
"In order to plan an event, you
need to file an event application with
the OSA," Cordova said."When I did
that, [Howe] contacted me with some
concerns. She wanted to make sure
that we were not being overly parti
san at the event."
I lowe did not return any of a num
ber of phone calls for comment from
The Daily.
Cordova added that the issue was
due to the legal nature of events that
were permitted to be held on campus.
He stressed, however, that Howe
never denied the application at any
time.
"She wanted to know that
Stanford's non-profit and tax code
were not going to be violated by a
partisan rally." he said. "We provided
her with the information she request
ed. We were more than happy to
invite other members from the com
munity to the event."

Cordova said that he was not
involved in the invitations to other
members of the community, hut that as
far as he was aware, the Stanford
College Republicans, the Stanford
Review and the Stanford Conservatives
were invited to the event.
"Yes on Prop. 8" supporters
While the event was primarily
attended by those already opposed to
Prop. 8. not all members of the
Stanford community agreed with the
rally.
Andrew Ning, a third-year PhD
student in favor of Prop. 8, explained
that he and others promoting the
measure wanted to let attendees
know that there were definitely mem
bers of the Stanford community that
supported Prop. 8.
"Although there are fewer stu
dents out here that support Prop. 8,
we want to inform voters of all the
aspects of proposition, so that they
can vote with a consciousness of what
they are actually voting for." he said.
Ning explained he supported
Prop. 8 because he did not wish to
alter the fundamental nature of mar
riages. He added that he was not in
favor of discrimination against gays.
"Marriage is an important and
sacred tradition." he said. "I feel that
the strength of America, or any other
state, is dependent upon the strength
of strong families. We need to pro
mote families and family life between
a man and a woman."
Jason Porter, a fourth-year PhD
candidate in mechanical engineering,
was also in favor of Prop. 8 and noted
the legality of gay marriages was a
non-partisan issue.
"Prop. 8 doesn't need to be a divi
sion between voting for Obama or
not." he said. "You can be pro on
Prop. 8 and pro-Obama, which is what
I am. 1 already voted for Obama and
Prop. 8. Both Obama and Biden's
official stances are that they are
against gay marriage."
