# ELECTION '08
## Leaders rally students to the polls 
### KAMIL DADA DESK EDITOR 
Approximately 2(H) students gath
ered outside Old Union on Monday
afternoon at an event intended to rally
the campus in favor of Democratic
Presidential Candidate Barack Obama
and in opposition to Proposition 8, a
state constitutional amendment that
would eliminate the right of same-sex
couples to marry in California.
Speakers at the event included San
Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom,
Stanford Law Professor Larry Marshall
and former State Controller Steve
Westly *78.
Westly, who is the California cam
paign co-chair for Obama for America
and is a member of the campaign's
finance committee,played heavily to the
home crowd and spoke of his memories
of Stanford.
"Let's cheer loudly for Obama," he
said. "1 want everyone in Stern Hall —
Ciod help them — to hear us cheer. And
let's have another cheer for Branner
while we are at it. 1 remember that when
I was student body president,about 2(KH)
students took over [Old Union] to rally
against apartheid in South Africa. Never
underestimate the strength of student
rallies."

Newsom. on the other hand, started
his talk by addressing the controversial
ballot initiative that would ban same-sex
marriages in California. In a stinging
rebuke of the on-campus supporters of
Prop. 8. Newsom noted that he couldn't
understand the logic of people who sup
ported the proposition.
"I can't believe that in 2(X)8 there are
people out there saying that 'let's take
rights away from other people,"' he said.
"How would they feel if their rights were
taken away? If you can take away rights
from line section of society, then you can
take rights away from other groups as
well."
Newsom proceeded to address the
crowd about the need to defeat Prop. 8.
"Millions of people are counting on
us to get it right." he said. "Prop. 8 is a
fight that no one wanted to fight. We
don't want to write decisions into the
Constitution that will remove civil
rights."
Newsom compared same-sex mar
riages to interracial marriages. I le elud
ed the case of Richard Loving (a white
man) and Mildred Loving (a black
woman) who were sentenced to one
year in prison in 1%7 because they
decided to marry.
"The Lovings
were sentenced to I

one year in prison just because they had
the audacity to fall in love with someone
of a different race." he said. "This is not
history. This was in my life. It was the
year of my birth."
Ashwin Mudaliar '(W. president of
the Stanford Democrats, noted that the
rally had been in the making for a couple
of months.
"There have been many plans for this
event going back into the summer," he
said. "It was debated over who we would
bring to campus. We were close to get
ting will.i.am. the lead singer of Black
Eyed Peas, but he cancelled at the last
minute due to scheduling issues."
Marshall appealed to students and
urged them to consider the importance
of the historical significance of today's
election.
"I fear that you don't understand the
magnitude of what this election is." he
said. "You need to see how different this
election really is. This is between choos
ing the status quo as we inherited it and
choosing a different world."
Marshall also encouraged students to
prioritize their activities on Election
Day.
"Since I am a faculty member here. 1
am not going to tell you to skip class and
