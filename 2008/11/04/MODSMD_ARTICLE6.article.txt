### LIZ STARK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Graduate Community Center (GCC)
— Stanford's sole polling place on Election
Day — opens for voting at 7 a.m. this morn
ing and closes at K p.m.
In response to two-hour wait times in the
February primaries, the Santa Clara County
Registrar emphasized absentee balloting
during this election to abate delays at the
GCC
"We've done extensive paid publicity with
The Daily to make sure that students" regis
tration was current and to let them know
where they could drop off their [absentee]
ballots." said Elma Rosas, spokesperson for
the Registrar of Voters office.
Andy Parker '11, campus director for the
Stanford Democrats and coordinator for stu
dent voter registration, worked with the
Registrar's office to encourage voters from
all states to use vote-bv-mail ballots.
According to Parker, several hundred voters
registered on campus took absentee ballots
last month.
Yesterday, the Registrar's office set up a
collection box for vote-by-mail at the GCC
from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. in another attempt to
decrease voter congestion on Election Day.
Though Rosas was unable to project the
number of voters who will vote at the GCC
today, she pointed out that the GCC is the
polling place for two precincts, which Parker
estimated to include "hundreds and hun
dreds" of voters.
In addition, four precincts with 250 or
fewer voters have received vote-by-mail bal
lots. and voters from those precincts may be
dropping off their ballots at the GCC today.
Rosas predicted that there will be "plenty
of staff at the polling place, including both
volunteers receiving stipends and staff mem
bers from Santa Clara County.
"We're going to try to see if we can have a
courtesy officer to expedite the process, espe
cially for our vote-by-mail voters." Rosas
added.
Parker said that the Stanford Democrats
have recruited students to serve as poll work
ers. She also that that although Santa Clara
County was unable to add more polling
places on campus, they have improved the
setup by adding more staff and a computer
on site for voters who report to the GCC
incorrectlv and need to find their actual
