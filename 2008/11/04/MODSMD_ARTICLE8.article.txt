## AMERICA VOTES: THE WORLD LOOKS ON 
### LILY GUO 
With the election results just hours away,
Americans all over the country are holding
their breath. But what does this all mean to
international students, who make up seven
percent of Stanford's undergraduate population?
Some international students may be under the im
pression that they know little about U.S. politics and
may thus place little value on today's election. After all,
few Americans know details about politics from many
other countries.
It seems, however, that Stanford's international stu
dents are in fact well-informed about American history
as well as current issues.
"While living outside of the United States, I've been
reading numerous articles concerning the elections pub
lished in the main news sources such as The New York
Times, Newsweek and MSNBC." said German interna
tional student Ariana Koblitz'l2. "Since I've been here,
I have been following the elections and watching the de
bates with fellow students."
And according to Sakshi Agarwal '12 from Singa
pore, the international students are leaning heavily De
mocratic.
"Every international student I have met here so far
has been a Democrat," she said."This isn't really surpris
ing because a lot of us chose Stanford for its liberal edu
cation and liberal political environment. Plus, the De
mocratic Party has a broader world view on things."
In fact, this international pro-Democratic trend
spans far beyond the boundaries of our campus. A June
7 Time magazine story reported that "a recent world
wide poll showed [Obama] beating the Republican by
more than three to one ... If Barack Obama was taking
on John McCain in a global election, he would already
be on his way to the White House."
Yet this particular article's title ("Europe shows love

for Barack Obama — unfortunately it has no vote") re
minds readers that it is, after all. the American votes that
count.
Although some international students have voiced
the desire to vote, most remain unperturbed.
"Frankly, I am not at all frustrated that I can't vote,"
said Chinese international student James Zhang '12.
"California is a blue state and definitely not a swing
state.Thus,a Democratic vote from me would be useless
with the Electoral College."
Some students have been attempting to voice their
opinions by getting actively involved. Koblitz, for exam
ple, has been participating in phone banks for "No on
Prop. 8."
"It has always been an issue important to me, but
Germany never legalized same-sex marriages,so I think
it's important that any place where it is legalized re
mains so," she said.
Others are focused on more specific political issues
pertinent to the relationship between their home coun
try and the United States.
"As internationals, foreign policy is especially impor
tant to us," said Iranian international student Roxana
Gharanzola '12. "Personally. I am very concerned with
the issue of immigration, ft worries me that conserva
tives might make it impossible for Iranian students like
myself to have the opportunity to study here."
It may well be this focus on foreign policy that con
tributes to the international pool's pro-Obama leanings.
In fact. Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin quotes such as,"You
can actually see Russia from Alaska!" and. "I'm so en
couraged to know that we both love Israel!" have be
come ongoing jokes in the international community. At
the October international student reunion dinner at the
Bechtel International Center, several students talked
about playing "Palin Bingo" during the debates — a
game in which the bingo card is filled with words like
"bad guys." "Pakistan. "Arab." "evil," "outsider" and

"gee."
But despite the seemingly lighthearted games and
the belief that they will not be as directly affected by the
election results, international students are still aware of
the election's potential impact in an international con
text.
"I highly doubt that the result of this year's election
will dramatically change life back home in Sri Lanka,"
said Aparna Surendra '12. "The world attention toward
the election, however, ensures that the outcome will
shape the way America is viewed by others. The results
will drastically affect the way other nations approach
the United States."
Regardless.since international students don't have a
vote, do their views really matter in this political battle
field?
According to Robert Zimbroff *12, an American stu
dent and a member of Students for Obama, they do.
"The opinion of international students is very impor
tant," Zimbroff said. "It is often easy for us to get caught
up in our beliefs, convinced the other side is completely
wrong, even evil. The international students can give us
a perspective more removed and impartial, helping us
make rational decisions."
