# Mixing the Cardinal with red and blue:
## Politics in the classroom 
### SIJIA WANG 
In a highly political campus climate, some profes
sors have taken the plunge, bringing politics to the
classroom. The Daily sat down with Political Science
Professor Terry Moe to discuss the implications of mix
ing two worlds.
The Stanford Daily (SD): Do you think that it is appro
priate for professors to reveal their political prefer
ences to students? Why or why not?
Prof. Terry Moe (TM): Well, I think it depends on the
situation. 1 certainly don't think that political prefer
ences need to be kept a secret, but I believe that a pro
fessor's job in the classroom is to teach subject matter
in a reasonably objective way. Professors should not in
fluence students by advertising their own views on pol
itics. They should not use their pulpit in the classroom
to advertise political stances.
SI): Do you think that a professor revealing his politi
cal preferences would dramatically influence students'
views on politics?
TM: There is certainly the danger that some students
will be influenced. It is wrong for professors to try to in
fluence their students in the classroom. Outside of
class, it is perfectly fine for professors to converse with

their students about politics in informal settings. But
sometimes professors use their formal position to try
to legitimize an ideology,and that's inappropriate. Pro
fessors shouldn't be spouting off about their own views
in a classroom setting. It is wrong to have a heavy par
tisan or ideological slant in the classroom.
SI): What about political campaigns? Do you think
that professors should participate in candidates' cam
paigns?
T!M: Professors have lives outside of work, and they
have every right to participate in political campaigns if
they so choose to.
SI): Have you seen or heard about professors using
their position to inappropriately influence students'
political viewpoints at Stanford?
TIM: I don't know if it's a problem on campus. 1 certain
ly haven't seen it. However, I have heard from several
students that some of their professors make it clear
which political party or candidate they favor when that
kind of information is superfluous. For instance, some
professors take out after Republicans or George W.
Bush, and that really has nothing to do with the subject

matter they are teaching.
SI): What about in the lower levels (such as secondary
school)? Do you think this is a bigger problem in high
school or middle school?
TM. It's definitely a much bigger issue for high school
and middle school. College students are more grown
up and can view their professors objectively. I lowever,
in high school or middle school, teachers are clearly
role models for students. Much of what they say is
viewed as legitimate. 1 think it's becoming less and less
of a problem, though.
SI): Do you think that there should be rules or laws
against faculty members revealing their political pref
erences to students?
TM: I don't know — that's a tough question. On one
hand, we want people to talk about politics openly. We
don't want to discourage that. On the other hand, we
don't want professors or teachers trying to indoctri
nate students. There are also other issues as well, such
as the freedom of speech, that are important to consid
er.

"I think professors should be straightforward about
their political viewpoints. That way,
students can come into classroom
situations knowing what to expect
from their professors. It is easier for
students to detect biases in their pro
fessors' presentation of the subject
matter if the professors themselves
are candid about their political pref
erences. In fact, I don't think that
students would be influenced as
much by their professors' political
viewpoints if they realize where they
are coming from, such as whether
they are coming from a conservative
or liberal mindset."
Tiq C'hapa '10
"I'd prefer that professors strive to
remain objective and kind of main
tain the appearance of being objec
tive. but I also understand that their
passion for their political beliefs
may bleed into their work. I'd prefer
that they'd work to keep that from

happening, but I understand that
they're human. At the same time,
they're in a position to intluence and
shape minds, so that's something
that they should be aware of."
Sharon Zeng '12
"As independent people, students
should be able to form their own
opinions on politics. Authority fig
ures will frequently have different
opinions, and I think that college
students can recognize this and
make up their minds. However, I
think that a professor's most impor
tant job is to provide wisdom and
knowledge to his students. And
sometimes the best teachers are
those that challenge your beliefs. For
example. I had a fairly conservative
history teacher in high school that
provided more insight into politics
than the many Democratic teachers
I've had over the years."
James Barton '09
"I think that it can be appropriate if
it's within the right context. I think
the professor should never speak of
political beliefs as part of subject

material. Like, they should never
say, 'And then Columbus landed in
1492 — and I think you should vote
for Barack Obama." But if it's mak
ing a segue and it's an appropriate
thing, I think that's fine. For exam
ple, I was in one of the classes where
the theater marriage proposals took
place, and I think the professor han
dled it really well. She was actually a
transgender professor, and she more
or less said that 'this prop, if it pass
es, will ruin our lives. I know this isn't
part of the subject material, but I
wanted to give you an opportunity
to be exposed to that.That said, vote
how you want.' And I think that's
the best possible way to handle it.
She wasn't telling us that we should
vote one way or the other, but that
whatever you vote, be educated and
be thoughtful about the issue."
Denise Johnson '12
"I think it is fine for professors to re
veal their political preferences as
long as they're not imposing their
viewpoints on their students. If they
aren't promoting a certain candi
date's stance over and over again in

the classroom, then I don't think
that it is a problem."
Otis Chodosh '1(1
"To be honest. 1 don't think any of
my professors have talked about
their political viewpoints because
I'm a math major. But 1 don't think
I'd be too offended."
Dean Julie Lythcott-Haims '89
"Stanford was founded on the prin
ciple of academic freedom. Faculty
have tremendous latitude and dis
cretion in all aspects of their aca
demic life, and preventing them
from sharing their political views in
the classroom would be to muzzle
and restrain the very freedom we
celebrate. Students confronted with
views they disagree with are free to
challenge those views, and they
should be encouraged to do so. Live
ly debate enhances the learning and
understanding of all involved. As an
administrator, I have an obligation
not to mix my Obama campaign ac
tivities with my professional life at
Stanford. I have worked hard to
draw the line appropriately in each

instance, though it is sometimes hard
to see where that line is. If I was in
California today (I am not because I
am traveling abroad for Stanford) I
would take a vacation day from
work so as to stay on the right side of
that line, just as I did on Feb. 5, the
day of the California primary."
Mati Horava '1(1
"There was a study in The New York

Times saying that it actually doesn't
influence people. It's an educational
experience, too; in real life, people
aren't going to not tell you what they
think, and I think it's kind of artifi
cial to try to stop that."

In a highly political campus climate, some profes
sors have taken the plunge, bringing politics to the
classroom. The Daily sat down with Political Science
Professor Terry Moe to discuss the implications of mix
ing two worlds.
The Stanford Daily (SD): Do you think that it is appro
priate for professors to reveal their political prefer
ences to students? Why or why not?
Prof. Terry Moe (TM): Well, I think it depends on the
situation. 1 certainly don't think that political prefer
ences need to be kept a secret, but I believe that a pro
fessor's job in the classroom is to teach subject matter
in a reasonably objective way. Professors should not in
fluence students by advertising their own views on pol
itics. They should not use their pulpit in the classroom
to advertise political stances.
SI): Do you think that a professor revealing his politi
cal preferences would dramatically influence students'
views on politics?
TM: There is certainly the danger that some students
will be influenced. It is wrong for professors to try to in
fluence their students in the classroom. Outside of
class, it is perfectly fine for professors to converse with

their students about politics in informal settings. But
sometimes professors use their formal position to try
to legitimize an ideology,and that's inappropriate. Pro
fessors shouldn't be spouting off about their own views
in a classroom setting. It is wrong to have a heavy par
tisan or ideological slant in the classroom.
SI): What about political campaigns? Do you think
that professors should participate in candidates' cam
paigns?
T!M: Professors have lives outside of work, and they
have every right to participate in political campaigns if
they so choose to.
SI): Have you seen or heard about professors using
their position to inappropriately influence students'
political viewpoints at Stanford?
TIM: I don't know if it's a problem on campus. 1 certain
ly haven't seen it. However, I have heard from several
students that some of their professors make it clear
which political party or candidate they favor when that
kind of information is superfluous. For instance, some
professors take out after Republicans or George W.
Bush, and that really has nothing to do with the subject

matter they are teaching.
SI): What about in the lower levels (such as secondary
school)? Do you think this is a bigger problem in high
school or middle school?
TM. It's definitely a much bigger issue for high school
and middle school. College students are more grown
up and can view their professors objectively. I lowever,
in high school or middle school, teachers are clearly
role models for students. Much of what they say is
viewed as legitimate. 1 think it's becoming less and less
of a problem, though.
SI): Do you think that there should be rules or laws
against faculty members revealing their political pref
erences to students?
TM: I don't know — that's a tough question. On one
hand, we want people to talk about politics openly. We
don't want to discourage that. On the other hand, we
don't want professors or teachers trying to indoctri
nate students. There are also other issues as well, such
as the freedom of speech, that are important to consid
er.

"I think professors should be straightforward about
their political viewpoints. That way,
students can come into classroom
situations knowing what to expect
from their professors. It is easier for
students to detect biases in their pro
fessors' presentation of the subject
matter if the professors themselves
are candid about their political pref
erences. In fact, I don't think that
students would be influenced as
much by their professors' political
viewpoints if they realize where they
are coming from, such as whether
they are coming from a conservative
or liberal mindset."
Tiq C'hapa '10
"I'd prefer that professors strive to
remain objective and kind of main
tain the appearance of being objec
tive. but I also understand that their
passion for their political beliefs
may bleed into their work. I'd prefer
that they'd work to keep that from

happening, but I understand that
they're human. At the same time,
they're in a position to intluence and
shape minds, so that's something
that they should be aware of."
Sharon Zeng '12
"As independent people, students
should be able to form their own
opinions on politics. Authority fig
ures will frequently have different
opinions, and I think that college
students can recognize this and
make up their minds. However, I
think that a professor's most impor
tant job is to provide wisdom and
knowledge to his students. And
sometimes the best teachers are
those that challenge your beliefs. For
example. I had a fairly conservative
history teacher in high school that
provided more insight into politics
than the many Democratic teachers
I've had over the years."
James Barton '09
"I think that it can be appropriate if
it's within the right context. I think
the professor should never speak of
political beliefs as part of subject

material. Like, they should never
say, 'And then Columbus landed in
1492 — and I think you should vote
for Barack Obama." But if it's mak
ing a segue and it's an appropriate
thing, I think that's fine. For exam
ple, I was in one of the classes where
the theater marriage proposals took
place, and I think the professor han
dled it really well. She was actually a
transgender professor, and she more
or less said that 'this prop, if it pass
es, will ruin our lives. I know this isn't
part of the subject material, but I
wanted to give you an opportunity
to be exposed to that.That said, vote
how you want.' And I think that's
the best possible way to handle it.
She wasn't telling us that we should
vote one way or the other, but that
whatever you vote, be educated and
be thoughtful about the issue."
Denise Johnson '12
"I think it is fine for professors to re
veal their political preferences as
long as they're not imposing their
viewpoints on their students. If they
aren't promoting a certain candi
date's stance over and over again in

the classroom, then I don't think
that it is a problem."
Otis Chodosh '1(1
"To be honest. 1 don't think any of
my professors have talked about
their political viewpoints because
I'm a math major. But 1 don't think
I'd be too offended."
Dean Julie Lythcott-Haims '89
"Stanford was founded on the prin
ciple of academic freedom. Faculty
have tremendous latitude and dis
cretion in all aspects of their aca
demic life, and preventing them
from sharing their political views in
the classroom would be to muzzle
and restrain the very freedom we
celebrate. Students confronted with
views they disagree with are free to
challenge those views, and they
should be encouraged to do so. Live
ly debate enhances the learning and
understanding of all involved. As an
administrator, I have an obligation
not to mix my Obama campaign ac
tivities with my professional life at
Stanford. I have worked hard to
draw the line appropriately in each

instance, though it is sometimes hard
to see where that line is. If I was in
California today (I am not because I
am traveling abroad for Stanford) I
would take a vacation day from
work so as to stay on the right side of
that line, just as I did on Feb. 5, the
day of the California primary."
Mati Horava '1(1
"There was a study in The New York

Times saying that it actually doesn't
influence people. It's an educational
experience, too; in real life, people
