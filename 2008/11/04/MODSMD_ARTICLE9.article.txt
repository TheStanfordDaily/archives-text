# Mixing the Cardinal with red and blue:
## Politics in the classroom 
### SIJIA WANG 
In a highly political campus climate, some profes
sors have taken the plunge, bringing politics to the
classroom. The Daily sat down with Political Science
Professor Terry Moe to discuss the implications of mix
ing two worlds.
The Stanford Daily (SD): Do you think that it is appro
priate for professors to reveal their political prefer
ences to students? Why or why not?
Prof. Terry Moe (TM): Well, I think it depends on the
situation. 1 certainly don't think that political prefer
ences need to be kept a secret, but I believe that a pro
fessor's job in the classroom is to teach subject matter
in a reasonably objective way. Professors should not in
fluence students by advertising their own views on pol
itics. They should not use their pulpit in the classroom
to advertise political stances.
SI): Do you think that a professor revealing his politi
cal preferences would dramatically influence students'
views on politics?
TM: There is certainly the danger that some students
will be influenced. It is wrong for professors to try to in
fluence their students in the classroom. Outside of
class, it is perfectly fine for professors to converse with

their students about politics in informal settings. But
sometimes professors use their formal position to try
to legitimize an ideology,and that's inappropriate. Pro
fessors shouldn't be spouting off about their own views
in a classroom setting. It is wrong to have a heavy par
tisan or ideological slant in the classroom.
SI): What about political campaigns? Do you think
that professors should participate in candidates' cam
paigns?
T!M: Professors have lives outside of work, and they
have every right to participate in political campaigns if
they so choose to.
SI): Have you seen or heard about professors using
their position to inappropriately influence students'
political viewpoints at Stanford?
TIM: I don't know if it's a problem on campus. 1 certain
ly haven't seen it. However, I have heard from several
students that some of their professors make it clear
which political party or candidate they favor when that
kind of information is superfluous. For instance, some
professors take out after Republicans or George W.
Bush, and that really has nothing to do with the subject

matter they are teaching.
SI): What about in the lower levels (such as secondary
school)? Do you think this is a bigger problem in high
school or middle school?
TM. It's definitely a much bigger issue for high school
and middle school. College students are more grown
up and can view their professors objectively. I lowever,
in high school or middle school, teachers are clearly
role models for students. Much of what they say is
viewed as legitimate. 1 think it's becoming less and less
of a problem, though.
SI): Do you think that there should be rules or laws
against faculty members revealing their political pref
erences to students?
TM: I don't know â€” that's a tough question. On one
hand, we want people to talk about politics openly. We
don't want to discourage that. On the other hand, we
don't want professors or teachers trying to indoctri
nate students. There are also other issues as well, such
as the freedom of speech, that are important to consid
er.
