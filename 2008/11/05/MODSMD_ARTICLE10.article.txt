## Sex, death and bike helmets 
### 
We all know that wearing a helmet
while biking can save your life, or, at
least, we should. Bike accidents hap
pen approximately 30 times more often than
coitus on campus, and yet. the vast majority of
us refuse to wear helmets to protect the brains
that got us here. Why? Because somehow, tak
ing protective measures to safeguard what
makes us, well, us — is uncool.
"And coolness," argues the Fonz, "leads to
sex." Now, I have absolutely no idea if he actu
ally said that (given that "Happy Days" ended
seven years before I first remember televi
sion's sweet, sweet embrace), but even if he
didn't say those words precisely, he basically
proved the mantra every day of his fictional
life.
Unfortunately, though. I am not the Fonz.
At Stanford. I have been in two respectable
bike accidents; My freshman year. I was biking
at night when a kid pedaled headfirst into me
(I had stopped by then), permanently damag
ing both of our bikes. The whole thing hap
pened in front of my PHE.who laughed at me.
The second time was a fantastic spill where
I hit a bump wrong, my chain fell off, my bike
flipped over, the Jamba Juice I was holding ex
ploded in my hand, and I landed in front of
hundreds of people covered in blood, oil and
32 ounces of Peanut Butter Mood. The biggest
tragedy? No one was holding a camera.
I have also had friends get hit by cars, and
one who was mauled by a collapsing fence. For
products designed simply to stay upright,
fences are alarmingly poor at it.
Really, between Stanford's constant con
struction, less-than-ideally designed bike
paths, and its rushing, sleep-deprived bikers,
accidents are a very real threat. And bicycle
helmets, though funky-looking and made of
foam, are probably about the best way, aside
from not biking, to prevent seriously debilitat
ing injury in the event of a collision.
But here's the problem. Bike helmets make
people look more nerdy on an already very
nerdy campus, and when it comes to impress
ing the opposite sex, that's probably the last
thing most of us need.
Before writing this column. I ran a bunch of
statistically significant tests using "regres
sions," "logarithms" and "imagination," and I
realized that the likelihood of death or injury is
pretty decently correlated with the chance of
sex.Think of stereotypical chess nerds — they
have a very low risk of death (not counting any
stereotypical bullies out there), but they also
have a low risk of sex.
After the debacle that was last week's col

umn, I feel it necessary to point out here that
TTiis is a stereotype. Chess nerds are perfectly
capable of incurring ricks and getting tail,
should they so desire. So please, please, please
don't send me dozens of angry emails.
Now.at the other extreme, we have football
players, rock stars and pirates, all of whom
have a higher risk of death or bizarre injury,
but who. I assume, get significantly higher
amounts of play.
Again, this is a stereotype. I am sure there
are football players, rock stars and pirates who
have made the decision to remain chaste,and I
am happy for them. Please don't send me
angry emails.
I should point out. though, that there were
exceptions to my thorough study James Bond,
for example, has a zero percent risk of death
and a 1 (K) percent chance of sex. John McCain,
on the other hand, has a 22 percent chance of
sex and an H7 percent risk of death.
John McCain is a proud American and,
even though he may not be president, he has
worked hard to serve our country and de
serves our utmost respect.
Now. the study did bring into focus the hel
met issue. If not wearing a helmet means high
er risk, which in turn means higher chance of
sex, people, who I will assume are concerned
about their own sex appeal (not everyone is,
nor should they be), will continue to not wear
their helmets.
As such. I have devised two brilliant ways
to put the "clnie" back in "helmet," assuming
that "elme" means "sexy."
Idea No. I: Make not wearing a helmet un
bearably repulsive. Let's try an exercise!
Picture someone you consider absurdly,
mind blowingly gorgeous. At this time, I would
like to remind readers that, yes, there is a pic
ture of me at the top of this column. Now, pic
ture that same person in a coma. Is sex the first
thing you think of when you think of them in
capacitated? Before you say anything out
loud, please make sure your answer is "no."

And if I have to tell you. perma
nent brain damage is about as sexual
ly appealing as Rainn Wilson in a leo
tard. (Rainn Wilson is a beautiful
human being whose body should be
celebrated). Now, Stanford.just make
everyone go through this simple
mental exercise and hiking helmet
less will seem totally not hot.
Problem solved!
Idea No. 2: Make wearing helmets
literally the sexiest thing a person can
possibly do at Stanford. I lere's how:
First, find all of the attractive girls
on campus (this will be easy because
they're the ones who avoid eye con
tact with me).
Next, pay/convince them all to
wear helmets (bonus points for biki
nis. if we really want to beat a dead
horse with the sex thing, which we
definitely should. For safety).
Finally, pay/convince them to only
date guys who wear helmets (it isn't
morally corrupt if we're saving
lives!).
Problem solved — and awesome
ly. I might add.
I suppose that this attractive girl
policy could cause more accidents for
easily distracted bikers, but hey, that's
just another reason to wear a helmet.
Get on it. Stanford.

But here's the problem. Bike helmets make
people look more nerdy on an already very
nerdy campus, and when it comes to impress
ing the opposite sex, that's probably the last
thing most of us need.
Before writing this column. I ran a bunch of
statistically significant tests using "regres
sions," "logarithms" and "imagination," and I
realized that the likelihood of death or injury is
pretty decently correlated with the chance of
sex.Think of stereotypical chess nerds — they
have a very low risk of death (not counting any
stereotypical bullies out there), but they also
have a low risk of sex.
After the debacle that was last week's col

umn, I feel it necessary to point out here that
TTiis is a stereotype. Chess nerds are perfectly
capable of incurring ricks and getting tail,
should they so desire. So please, please, please
don't send me dozens of angry emails.
Now.at the other extreme, we have football
players, rock stars and pirates, all of whom
have a higher risk of death or bizarre injury,
but who. I assume, get significantly higher
amounts of play.
Again, this is a stereotype. I am sure there
are football players, rock stars and pirates who
have made the decision to remain chaste,and I
am happy for them. Please don't send me
angry emails.
I should point out. though, that there were
exceptions to my thorough study James Bond,
for example, has a zero percent risk of death
and a 1 (K) percent chance of sex. John McCain,
on the other hand, has a 22 percent chance of
sex and an H7 percent risk of death.
John McCain is a proud American and,
even though he may not be president, he has
worked hard to serve our country and de
serves our utmost respect.
Now. the study did bring into focus the hel
met issue. If not wearing a helmet means high
er risk, which in turn means higher chance of
sex, people, who I will assume are concerned
about their own sex appeal (not everyone is,
nor should they be), will continue to not wear
their helmets.
As such. I have devised two brilliant ways
to put the "clnie" back in "helmet," assuming
that "elme" means "sexy."
Idea No. I: Make not wearing a helmet un
bearably repulsive. Let's try an exercise!
Picture someone you consider absurdly,
mind blowingly gorgeous. At this time, I would
like to remind readers that, yes, there is a pic
ture of me at the top of this column. Now, pic
ture that same person in a coma. Is sex the first
thing you think of when you think of them in
capacitated? Before you say anything out
loud, please make sure your answer is "no."

And if I have to tell you. perma
nent brain damage is about as sexual
ly appealing as Rainn Wilson in a leo
tard. (Rainn Wilson is a beautiful
human being whose body should be
celebrated). Now, Stanford.just make
everyone go through this simple
mental exercise and hiking helmet
less will seem totally not hot.
Problem solved!
Idea No. 2: Make wearing helmets
literally the sexiest thing a person can
possibly do at Stanford. I lere's how:
First, find all of the attractive girls
on campus (this will be easy because
they're the ones who avoid eye con
tact with me).
Next, pay/convince them all to
wear helmets (bonus points for biki
nis. if we really want to beat a dead
horse with the sex thing, which we
definitely should. For safety).
Finally, pay/convince them to only
date guys who wear helmets (it isn't
morally corrupt if we're saving
lives!).
Problem solved — and awesome
ly. I might add.
I suppose that this attractive girl
policy could cause more accidents for
easily distracted bikers, but hey, that's
just another reason to wear a helmet.
Get on it. Stanford.
