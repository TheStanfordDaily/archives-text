## Cheers to global warming, part two 
### 
Meet "the future of adult entertain
ment," the Svedka_Grl — extraor
dinaire and cover girl for Svedka
vodka. Completely computer-generated
(with no clothes written into her code), she's
definitely not your ordinary model.
But this is definitely not your ordinary
vodka ad campaign, either.
With its übiquitous exposure in magazines
and subway stops everywhere, the Svedka
vodka campaign is possibly one of the most
sophisticated alcohol ad campaigns in the
market. Part of this sophistication comes
from the talent that constantly fuels creativi
ty into the campaign — a team of 16 writers
whose sole task is to come up with 16 differ
ent scenarios of life in 2033, the year from
which the Svedka_Grl comes.
The campaign offers a complex and
multi-layered form of satire. First there is
the Svedka_Grl herself, whose enormous
breasts, childbearing hips and non-existent
waist makes her an exaggerated and inhu
man version of the "ideal" female body.
(Think "I-Robot" meets porn-star Barbie).
Along with her description as "the future of
adult entertainment," the look of the Sved
ka_Grl alone serves as a merciless parody of
the way in which unrealistic body images
have changed our concept of "sexy" to "un
real."
Then there is the Svedka_Grrs functional
purpose in the campaign. Aside from the
satire inherent in her looks, she is also the
mouthpiece of the campaign writers — the
fortuneteller dripping in irony who dishes
out wry social commentary to consumers
everywhere. In one ad,for example,she urges
consumers from 2033 to "make your next tro
phy wife 1 (K) percent titanium," while in an
other, she claims that in 2033 "gay men still
prefer Svedka over sex with women." Yet
while her outlook can amuse us present
dwellers by offering scenarios that some
times seem outlandish, it can also have a dis

tinctly sobering effect. When all is said and
done, behind the thin veil of irony, her mes
sages inevitably cause us to think about the
more unpleasant facts about our reality
today.
Having already tackled some of the more
controversial social issues, it was only a mat
ter of time until the Svedka writers put in
their two cents about global warming. In that
particular ad, the Svedka_Grl looks over her
shoulder at the consumer with an unreadable
gaze, her hands on her hips in a sexually sug
gestive pose. Next to her. "Do your part to
help end global warming. Add more ice" is
printed in clear, unapologetic font.
Last week. 1 criticized Absolut for the
"add more ice" line because I felt it perpetu
ated a retrogressive worldview. This week. 1
am going to commend Svedka for the exact
same line, simply because it is used in a com
pletely different context.
Instead of endeavoring to represent an
ideal, as in the Absolut ad. the Svedka_Grl
represents an extrapolation of our current re
ality. And since her messages routinely sati
rize the shortcomings of our world today, one
thing is certain — we can't take what we see
at face value.
If we were to interpret this ad at face
value, we would probably conclude that it
does not take global warming seriously at all.
It seems to mock the gravity of climate
change with the quip about adding more ice,
which is only made worse by the over-the-top
nature of the Svedka_GrPs appearance. Hut I

don't think that interpretation is consistent
with the tone and purpose of the Svedka
campaign. Svedka ads tend to hold the mirror
up to consumers and make them face their
own degenerate cultural trends. So rather
than sending us the message that global
warming is a matter worthy of flippancy, this
ad does exactly the opposite —it subtly
mocks us for thinking we could ever be flip
pant about it in the first place.
Where does this flippancy come from? As
surprising as it may seem to some, an over
whelming majority of people are still reluc
tant to recognize that we are facing a global
environmental crisis —to the point where
they cannot even fathom making any serious
effort to combat it. In some people's minds,
"add more ice" is just an imaginary solution
to an imaginary problem.Their outlook is un
derstandable, though not exactly justifiable.
After all, global warming probably hasn't yet
directly affected them much at all — no won
der it seems unreal.
But here's the rub: This particular prob
lem isn't imaginary, and it will affect every
one sooner or later (even people who can af
ford to drink Svedka vodka). What if we
don't take any action in the next few years to
reduce our impact on climate change? By
2033, "add more ice" might really be all we
can do — add more ice to our vodka sours
and toast to the death of the Earth that we
know and love.
Want to prevent that scenario? Then start
envisioning our planet 25 years from now,
with your life figured into it. Start thinking
about the future,and what you can do now to
ensure that your quality of life will be just as
good. Start taking measures to help the plan
et today ... while we can still even presume
to laugh about it.

Think you'd be a belter model for the Svedka
campaign than the Svedka _Grl? Email your
