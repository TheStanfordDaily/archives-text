## An old dream actualized 
### 
Approximately 45 years ago, Martin I.uther King,
Jr. gave his famous "I Have a Dream" speech, with the
highest hopes that some day his dream could be actu
alized. On Nov. 4, the dream came to fruition with the
election of the first African-American president,
Barack Obama. Over 200 years of inequality and dis
crimination against African Americans in the forms of
lynchings, white-only signs and institutionalized racism
all seemed to melt away with the Hash of life-altering
words across television sets worldwide: Barack Obama
Elected President. King's dream has been 45 long years
in the making. Finally, it has come true.
Within only two minutes of hearing the news, my
phone began to ring off the hook. My most heartwarm
ing phone call came from one ocean and one continent
away in Sierra Leone. My dear friend Dabo came in,
through heavy static, saying, "Re, Re, he110... Re?
This is Dabo. I am listening live. Obama! Congratula
tions."
"Congratulations to all of us," I said before we lost
contact.
With the receipt of his call, it dawned on me just how
meaningful this historic moment was for the entire
African Diaspora. For the first time in a very long time,
we are united, proud, strong. In the face of the Social
Darwinist notion that Blacks are lesser, impoverished,
beneath and "othered," we stand. ITiis moment is truly
historic for all of us.
History has been made, not just for the African-
American community, but also for every existing un
derdog and for the nation as a whole. What has oc
curred this night was enough to beckon the tears of
grown men, to summon the attention and support of
the international community and to renew the long-de
parted faith and hope of myself, a young African-
American woman budding into adulthood.
The history has been made. The change has come.
The dream has been actualized.
Onward.
