## Senate talks advocacy on day of election 
### MARISA LANDICHO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Undergraduate Senate was
once again confronted with its advo
cacy policy in an abbreviated meeting
last night. The Graduate Student
Council (GSC) questioned the
Senate's expansion into political
issues, specifically the recent resolu
tion to go against California
Proposition <S. which was passed by
voters yesterday.
"A third of the graduate popula
tion are international and there might
be repercussions for students whose
home countries are not so free," said
Deputy Chair Shelley Gao '11.
reporting from the GSC. "In fact, [the
students] might be prosecuted."
Currently, the GSC is looking into
international law. California law and
the ASSU Constitution to assess
these possibilities.The council did not
want its support to be included with
future ASSU resolutions passed on
political topics.
The other main issue discussed last
night was the lack of parties held on
campus due to increased restrictions
bv the University. Senator Zachary

Johnson "10 argued that because it
has been harder for houses on the
Row to host parties, students have
been partying instead at their own
dorms and private residences.
"When there is nothing going on.
I've talked to a number of RAs. and
their kids have been drinking a lot
more and pre-gaming," Johnson said.
"At least for my freshmen, there
have been a lot more parties in the
dorms."
Johnson said he was circulating a
petition on the Row to make it easi
er for houses to throw parties. If
more parties were scheduled, stu
dents. especially freshman, would
have another outlet on weekends
and would not consume as much
alcohol, Johnson argued.
After 20 minutes, the meeting was
concluded and the senators hurried to
watch the incoming election results.
"In case you weren't aware, polls
close in 36 minutes," announced
Senator Yvorn "Doc" Aswad-
Thomas '11. as the senators streamed
out the door.
