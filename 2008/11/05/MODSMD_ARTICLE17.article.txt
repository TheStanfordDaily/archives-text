## FROSH FOOT FORWARD 
### BY NATE ADAMS 
Like many other freshman, rookie midfielder Teresa
Noyola has spent her first fall quarter at the Farm ex
ploring classes, making friends, and adjusting to din
ing hail food. In her spare time, though, the Palo Alto
native has been busy ripping apart Division I defens
es and supporting one of the most prolific offenses in the NCAA.
Noyola's soccer career had humble beginnings, but it didn't
take her long to be recognized for her talent. She first began play
ing at age seven, for an American Youth Soccer Organization
team named "The Purple Penguins."
As a Penguin, ironically enough, Noyola's skills took (light.
She stuck with soccer, and some time later, joined the Mountain
View-Los Altos (MVLA) Mercury, where she played champi
onship-caliber soccer for several years alongside current Stan
ford classmate Lindsay Taylor, and played an incredible six sea
sons with lIS national teams and development programs. At
barely 17. she was the youngest person to ever play for America's
Under-20 team.
She credits her time with these teams for much of her growth
and success as a player.
"Playing for the national team gave me invaluable experience
and prepared me well for college soccer," Noyola said. "I loved
traveling around the world to places like Japan. Brazil, France,
and Argentina. And playing with Lindsay Taylor, as many others
would agree, is a treat. 1 ler nose for the goal is amazing, and our
years of playing together are definitely showing on the field."
As a senior at Palo Alto High School. Noyola had many op
tions for her future. She was the three-time MVP and captain of
her soccer team, had amassed a record amount of athletic and ac
ademic scholarships and would eventually be named the
Gatorade National Girls' Soccer Player of the Year. In short, she
could have gone almost anywhere. So how did she wind up on the
Farm?
"Growing up in Palo Alto. I always loved Stanford. But the
close location to home was pretty irrelevant in mv decision," she
said. "No other school that I looked at matched Stanford's aca
demic and athletic balance."
To say that the decision is working out well for Noyola would
be putting it mildly.The Cardinal freshman was named the Pacif
ic* 10 Conference's player of the week in the first full weekend of
the season, when she scored three goals against Navy and No. 15
Boston College. She has started every game for the Cardinal,
scored three game-winners, and has the only penalty-kick goal of
Stanford's season.
Noyola says she loves soccer for its "balance of structure and
creativity." Previously named to the Nike Premier 50 Most Cre
ative Player list, she certainly hasn't had trouble expressing her
creativity this season: Noyola leads the midfielders in assists (9)
and shots (39). and has been a direct part of 15 Stanford goals, six
of which were her own.
Her teammates are certainly glad to have her on their side.
"T has a huge offensive impact in the midfield," junior mid
fielder Kristin Stannard said. She makes unselfish runs all over
the place,just to open other players up. Our opponents have lots
of difficulty marking her, and we often hear them yelling at each
other, trying to figure out marking. She's scored lots of goals and
also made some crucial assists so far this year."
With the regular season now winding to a close, Noyola con
tinues to contribute and remains focused on capitalizing on a
great year for the Cardinal, whose first loss came just last week
end at UCLA.
"Amazing is the only way I can describe our season. Our suc
cess has come from everyone executing their individual role on
the field, but also from an intangible common desire to win above
all else," she said. "We had a bad game against UCLA, but
showed resilience in notching a big win against USC. We came off
the weekend as a better team, and I am confident in our position
heading into postseason. Our goal remains the same as in the be
ginning of the season...national championship."
Noyola and the Cardinal will end their regular season at Cal
this Saturday, where a win will keep their hopes of a Pac-10 cham
pionship over UCLA alive.
