# MEN'S WATER POLO
## Stanford takes on two top-10 opponents Cardinal faces MPSF foes on the road 
### KENAN JIANG STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men's water
polo will hit the road to plav two,
tough ranked opponents this week
end: No. 5 Pepperdine on Saturday,
and No. 8 UC-Santa Barbara on
Sunday. These two contests will
count for Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation tournament points, and
are key to the Cardinal's quest to
make the MPSF top four at the end
of the season.
"We will prepare by watching
film and walking through tendencies
that they have shown." freshman
Peter Scfton said. "We go into every
game with the mindset that the
game is very important and we have
to play at a high level."
The top two teams in MPSF will
receive an automatic berth in the
NCAA men's water polo champi
onships while the other two teams
are selected based on wild card.
Every year, the two top teams in the
MPSF essentially play for the cham
pionship as the conference has had
the four best teams in the nation
each year in UCLA, USC, Cal and
Stanford. This season. No. 4 UCLA
has lost to Stanford twice including a
12-2 rout in mid-October. The Car
dinal has also beaten No. 3 Cal this
year in a thrilling, triple overtime

victory at the NorCal Tournament in
September.
The Cardinal is 20-2 overall and
4-0 in MPSF" play. Sunday's 19-7 vic
tory over Santa Clara marked Stan
ford's sixth straight win. and gave
the Cardinal its first 20 win season
since 2005. where it went 20-7.
Offensively, Stanford is led by
junior Janson Wigo who has put up
an incredible 43 goals and averages
1.95 goals per game. Janson is close
ly followed by his brother Drac.who
has put up an impressive 39 goals on
the season — they are the number
five and number eight leading goal
scorers in the MPSF. respectively.
MPSF- rankings also essentially
amount to rankings for the best
water polo teams around the nation.
Stanford's offensive depth is il
lustrated by the presence of multiple
scorers in each game. In any regular
contest. Stanford usually has be
tween five and seven different play
ers each contributing offensively.
Thanks, in part, to its offensive
depth. Stanford is currently second
in the nation in goals scored per
game with 12.14, while USC is No. 1
with 12.40.
On the defensive side, junior cap
tain Jimmie Sandman is ninth in the
nation for goal attempts saved per
game with 7.28. Stanford's defense is
number two nationally for total
goals allowed per game at 4.82 goals
per game — again, only the Trojans
top the Cardinal with 4.45 goals al
lowed per game.
UC-Santa Barbara has the top

goal scorer in the nation in Milos
Golic, who averages 3.15 goals per
game and leads the MPSF with 63
goals scored. The Gauchos have a
pair of goalkeepers splitting time in
Fraser Bunn and Michael Robinson,
who have made 1(H) and % saves re
spectively on the season. UCSB is

number five in the nation in goals
per game with 10.50 while its de
fense is somewhat more suspect
with 9.40 goals allowed per game.
"We need to play great team de
fense, as always." Scfton said. "Also,
we will have to come into the game
with a great mental attitude and

ready to battle."
Stanford's trip against Pepper
dine will be much tougher as the
Waves will feature stars JP Mac-
Donnell and Grant Miller who both
average 1.95 goals per game, with 39

goals and 37 goals scored on the sea
son respectively. Pepperdine's scor
ers are ranked sixth in the nation
and will also be aided by Adam
Hewko, the 11th top scorer in the
nation with 33 goals. The Waves'
Matt McDonnell is 17th on the same
leaderboard with 26 goals, and Clay
ton Snyder is 23rd nationally with 23
goals. Pepperdine's dynamic offense
is ranked fourth in the nation over
all in goals scored per game with
10.90, and their defense also only al
lows 7.10 goals per game, which
points to a tough challenge for the
Card.
The Cardinal is slated to open
play at 12 p.m. in Malibu and Santa
Barbara, Calif, on Saturday and
Sunday, respectively.
