# Show Harbaugh the money
## 
### 
It was tempting to make this a
sports-in-politics column, or
mayhe a politics-in-sports piece.
After all, with all the bright reds and
blues, shifting electoral college
scores and constant media coverage
and color commentary, it seems that
American politics in the media shifts
ever closer to being a Red Sox-Yan
kees, Michigan-Ohio State or USC-
Notre Dame style grudge match.
Which nation are you a part of?
Show your colors and cheer along.
It's even more tempting when a
pair of Bay Area sports icons (ok.
one icon and one villain) makes
their voices heard on one of the most
controversial state propositions in
recent years. And let's just say that
Jeff Kent's reported Sisoo donated
to the Yes On S campaign and Steve
Young's quiet support for the count
er campaign (he did not openly op
pose the proposition, but his wife did
and loudly) only further reinforce
my already existing opinions of both
of them as a Giants and 49ers fan.
But frankly. I have to say I'm not
really a fan of the collision between
the sporting and political worlds. So
I wasn't too eager to go that direc
tion myself, and was about as happy
as a Stanford fan could be today to
read rumors that football coach Jim
Harbaugh could be a prominent
candidate for the soon to be vacant
Oakland Raiders head coaching job
after the season. Which is to say I
was miserable, but not quite to the
point of making myself sick.
Tim Kawakami.a prominent Bay
Area sports columnist for the San
Jose Mercury News, wrote in his
blog yesterday that Harbaugh is
very likely to be offered the Raiders'
job after interim coach Tom Cable is
presumably fired at the end of the
season. Citing a source within the
Raiders organization, who. Kawaka
mi wrote, "has been very reliable in
the past," was adamant that Raiders
owner A 1 Davis loved Harbaugh,
and that the only question would be
whether the Cardinal coach would
feel similarly towards accepting a
position with the Raiders.
Of course, on the surface, this is
all speculation. This is just one
writer, citing recent information
from an unnamed source. But it rais
es an issue with the Stanford pro
gram that has been lurking in the
background for years — long before
Harbaugh's reign as coach, even
began.
The essential problem with build
ing a successful Cardinal program
has always been that if the Universi
ty finds a good football coach, he in
evitably moves on to greener pas
tures. li happened with Bill Walsh, it
happened with Denny Green,it hap
pened with Tyrone Willingham and
there's no reason to think it won't
eventually happen to Harbaugh,
too. Unless, that is, Stanford wises up
fast.
You see, we've all heard the argu
ments and in a way, they're right.
There's no way a football coach is
more important to the overall health
of an academic institution than a
university president, so why should
he be paid more? Iliis essentially
limits the amount of money the Uni
versity has been willing to pay its
coaches over the years, meaning that
eventually they all decide to just
take the money and go somewhere
else.
The problem with that line of
thinking though, is that it complete
ly ignores the reason college coach
es in the big money sports (football
and men's basketball) need to be
paid more — because they are
everywhere else. And you know why
that is? Because they bring in
money.
It's simple economics really.
Good coaches build good football
programs. Good football programs
can rake in cash by the boatloads.
Therefore, other universities, seeing
the opportunity to rake in said cash,
offer good football coaches a por
tion of the tremendous riches they
expect them to bring in. Stanford,
meanwhile, sits back and wonders
why it can't fill a glorious new stadi
um that took millions of dollars to
build.
llie solution isn't hard to grasp.

Stanford needs to take a long look in
the mirror and realize that the
money it would need to spend to
keep a solid young coach like Har
baugh in house is a pittance com
pared to the benefit it stands to gain
by his presence and continued work.
Whether Harbaugh decides to con
sign himself to a coaching fate worse
than death in Oakland or not, even
tually a richer offer will come along.
And when that happens, Stan
ford needs to ante up. for the first
time in far too long.
