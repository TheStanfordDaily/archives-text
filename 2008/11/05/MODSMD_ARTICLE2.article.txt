# 'CHANGE HAS COME'
## Barack Obama elected first African-American president 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A makeshift bonfire broke out in the
Main Quad on Tuesday night as Stanford
students celebrated the election of Sen.
Barack Obama (D-III.) as the first African-
American president of the United States.
Red plastic cups were thrust high into the
air as students celebrated the landslide
Electoral College victory of the son of a
Kenyan father and Kansas mother who rose
from an unconventional upbringing to the
national spotlight after being elected to the
Senate just two years before.
Obama's calls for change mobilized hun
dreds of thousands of college students and
generated one of the highest turnouts of
young voters in the nation's history.
This heightened awareness was in no
short supply at Stanford, where early elec
tion returns from the E : .ast Coast made it dif
ficult for students to concentrate during
afternoon classes and threatened to pre
empt some of the celebrations planned for
later in the evening.
Hut even as national polls pointed
towards a decisive victory for Obama. stu
dents' enthusiasm could not be dampened
by the possibility of a predetermined out
come. Cheers erupted at the CoHo as sever
al hundred students attending a campus
wide Election Night party watched swing
state after swing state fall into Obama's col
umn.
"This is a historical moment." said Tolu
Olorunnipa MA '09.
Reactions were markedly subdued at a
small, off-campus gathering of conserva
tives. many of whom had been supporting
the candidacy of Obama's opponent. Sen.
John McCain (R-Ariz.).
"I've pretty much expected [the election]
to go for Obama." said Nathan Harnett '12
while watching results come in at a restau
rant on University Ave. "I held onto a little
hope, but the news has kind of made me a
little less optimistic."
'Never the likeliest candidate'
Obama's victory marked the culmination
of a nearly two-year election cycle that wit
nessed a long-fought primary battle, record
breaking fundraising efforts and a series of
historical milestones that shattered race and
gender harriers in the contest for the
nation's highest office.
"If there is anyone out there who still
doubts that America is a place where all
things are possible, who still wonders if the
dream of our founders is alive in our time,
who still questions the power of our democ
racy, tonight is your answer." Obama told an
estimated 125.000 people in Chicago.
Hie election night extravaganza at the
CoHo. sponsored by many of the
University's major political student groups,
was the largest of a number of election
watching gatherings taking place on and off
campus. At Hranner Hall, close to 50 fresh
men — many of whom voted in their first
presidential election — clustered around a
projection screen in the dorm's lounge to
watch the results filter in.
"I'm just excited to have a president that
I can believe in," said Ross Darwin "12 about

an hour before the polls closed in California.
"I don't remember being excited about a
president. Now I can be."
Acknowledging that he "was never the
likeliest candidate." Obama attributed his
success to the growth of a grassroots cam
paign that built on small donations and a
message of change that appealed to a
diverse cross-section of the American elec
torate.
"It grew from the young people who
rejected the myth of their generation's apa
thy. who left their homes and their families
for jobs that offered little pay and less
sleep." Obama said. "It drew strength from
the not-so-young people who braved the bit
ter cold and scorching heat to knock on
doors of perfect strangers, and from the mil
lions of Americans who volunteered and
organized and proved that more than two
centuries later a government of the people,
by the people and for the people has not
perished from the Earth."
'A Journey of Self-Discovery'
One of these volunteers was Elizabeth
D'Aunno '09. political co-director and chief
financial officer of the Stanford Democrats.

llinois Senator Barack Obama won a landslide victory over Arizona Senator John McCain on Tuesday to become the 44th president of the
Jnited States of America. Obama will now be expected to move quickly and may soon name key officials in his administration.


SAMMY ABUSRUR/The Stanford Daily
Students celebrated Barack Obama's presidential victory by lighting a bonfire in the Main Quad
last night. Revelers joined in chants of "Obama!" and sang "The Star-Spangled Banner."
who stopped out of Stanford last fall to cam
paign for Obama in lowa. She worked on a
team responsible for planning and executing
(he senator's appearances in lowa in
advance of the state's primary caucuses,
which ultimately gave Obama an early lead
on the path to his party's nomination.
Although her family had been living in
lowa. D'Aunno described her campaign
work as "a journey of self-discovery." By
bringing her in contact with residents of
other parts of the state. D'Aunno said the
campaign gave her an education in lowa's
politics that paralleled the same learning
curve Obama met as he canvassed the state.
"For me, it was the most formative expe
rience of my life." she said.
D'Aunno spent the early hours of
Election Night at the CoHo. where a stand
ing-room-only crowd was served free
nachos and beer while watching election
returns on four screens. The traditionally
low-key atmosphere of the campus coffee
house was decked out with shimmering red
and blue streamers. Face masks of the candi
dates and election-themed coloring books
were on hand for those who sought a break
from watching election coverage.
"It's been outstanding so far," said Eric
Showen '09, chair of Stanford in
Government (SIG), one of the co-sponsors
of the event. "It's exceeded my expectations.
People seem to be excited regardless of their
political affiliation."
The party, which was co-sponsored by the
ASSU. Stanford in Washington and the
Stanford Democrats, was billed as a non
partisan event. But the crowd overwhelm
ingly supported Obama's candidacy, often
counting down the seconds to network pro
jections and cheering for each state decided
in Obama's favor. States that went red were

usually met by jeers from those assembled.
"I'm more of an Obama guy, but I like
both candidates," said Will Young '09, who
attended the CoHo party. "So when people
here boo McCain whenever he wins a state.
I don't join in. He doesn't deserve that."
'Another Spectrum'
The increasingly rowdy atmosphere at
the CoHo contrasted with a smaller, quieter
gathering of conservative students watching
the election results on a small television at
Round Table Pizza in Palo Alto.
Organizers said the event, co-hosted bv
The Stanford Review and the Stanford
College Republicans, was designed to pro
vide attendees a comfortable environment
to view the results regardless of their politi
cal leanings.
"The gathering was supposed to be a sort
of place where people could come and meet
together, to feel they can express whatever
their views are," said Irina Oberman *09,
president of the Stanford College
Republicans. "People don't want to argue
with their friends over political problems
sometimes. It doesn't have to be in your
face."
Many conservatives suggested that
Stanford is an overwhelmingly liberal cam
pus and that it can often be difficult to pres
ent alternative viewpoints. They viewed the
off-campus gathering as a place to voice
their own views in a more accepting atmos
phere.
"It's really offering another spectrum,"
Thomas Stilson '09. "Here you can be
amongst... like-minded supporters without
feeling like an outcast."
Garrett Taylor '12 said he thought the
CoHo party would not provide the same
atmosphere since some of the co-sponsors

seemed liberal leaning.
But Cameron Bell '09, one of the lead
organizers of the CoHo event, told The
Daily on Sunday that they had reached out
to conservative student groups on campus to
help organize the CoHo event.
"We reached out to l"he Review, the
Stanford Conservative Society and the
College Republicans, but there was not so
much interest there," said Bell, SlG's vice
chair of operations.

A race beyond race?
The historical significance of the first
African-American man elected as com
mander-in-chief was not lost on Stanford stu
dents across campus.
"It says a lot that less than half a century
ago, there were laws that prevented African-
Americans the use of even the same bath
rooms as white Americans," Olorunnipa, the
graduate student at the CoHo, said.
"This is huge for all African Americans,
minorities or anybody else who has ever
been discriminated against before or now,"
he added.
Some suggested that Obama's appeal
transcended racial lines. Colleen Okyere 'I I
said she felt race had faded as an issue in the
election as more people voted for candidates
because of the substance of their ideas, not
the color of their skin.
"As an African-American woman, that
makes me very happy," Okyere said.
But others, like TajahTubbs '12, a resident
in Ujamaa, suggested that some may be too
quick to assume that Obama's election
would overcome racial inequalities.
"It's good, but there's still progress to be
made," Tubbs said.
Much of the same could be said for
women seeking higher office. Although the
200K election saw the first competitive
female presidential candidate in Sen. Miliary
Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) and the first
female vice-presidential candidate on a
Republican ticket, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin,
the West Wing remained out of a woman's
grasp.
James Barton '09 supported Clinton dur
ing the hard-fought Democratic primaries
and felt that although Obama shared some
of Hillary's views, the victory was bitter
sweet.
"Hillary was the first politician I had a
true connection to," Barton said. "Her defeat
was crushing for me. I'm excited that Obama
won, but Hillary would have been better."

'Tomorrow'
Early returns from the East Coast inter
rupted lecture halls lull of students eagerly
anticipating the results. In a Hewlett lecture
hall, students and even teaching assistants
frequently checked their laptops throughout
a two-hour review session, breaking into
chatter as those leading the review session
switched between slides and election updates.
Some of the University's biggest political
junkies, however, weren't on campus.
About 25 students at Stanford in
Washington crowded around a lounge televi
sion to watch the returns, eating donkey- and
elephant-shaped cookies and coloring in
electoral maps as network news channels
made their projections. Joining them were
life-sized cutouts of the candidates.
Back on campus, enthusiasm for Obama's
victory swelled into a kind of pandemonium
in the Main Ouad as celebrants — reminis
cent of the revelry following Stanford foot
ball's upset victory over Southern California
last year — set a pile of newspapers and
nearby branches ablaze in front of Memorial
Church.The flames grew into a sizeable bon
fire before being neutralized by firefighters
who responded to the scene.
For many, the real celebrations would
start once Obama entered the Oval Office.
"There are so many problems right now.
and they're not going to be different tomor
row," Ailison l ink '12 said. "But for the first
time in eight years, there's a chance that it's
going to be better."

team responsible for planning and executing
(he senator's appearances in lowa in
advance of the state's primary caucuses,
which ultimately gave Obama an early lead
on the path to his party's nomination.
Although her family had been living in
lowa. D'Aunno described her campaign
work as "a journey of self-discovery." By
bringing her in contact with residents of
other parts of the state. D'Aunno said the
campaign gave her an education in lowa's
politics that paralleled the same learning
curve Obama met as he canvassed the state.
"For me, it was the most formative expe
rience of my life." she said.
D'Aunno spent the early hours of
Election Night at the CoHo. where a stand
ing-room-only crowd was served free
nachos and beer while watching election
returns on four screens. The traditionally
low-key atmosphere of the campus coffee
house was decked out with shimmering red
and blue streamers. Face masks of the candi
dates and election-themed coloring books
were on hand for those who sought a break
from watching election coverage.
"It's been outstanding so far," said Eric
Showen '09, chair of Stanford in
Government (SIG), one of the co-sponsors
of the event. "It's exceeded my expectations.
People seem to be excited regardless of their
political affiliation."
The party, which was co-sponsored by the
ASSU. Stanford in Washington and the
Stanford Democrats, was billed as a non
partisan event. But the crowd overwhelm
ingly supported Obama's candidacy, often
counting down the seconds to network pro
jections and cheering for each state decided
in Obama's favor. States that went red were

usually met by jeers from those assembled.
"I'm more of an Obama guy, but I like
both candidates," said Will Young '09, who
attended the CoHo party. "So when people
here boo McCain whenever he wins a state.
I don't join in. He doesn't deserve that."
'Another Spectrum'
The increasingly rowdy atmosphere at
the CoHo contrasted with a smaller, quieter
gathering of conservative students watching
the election results on a small television at
Round Table Pizza in Palo Alto.
Organizers said the event, co-hosted bv
The Stanford Review and the Stanford
College Republicans, was designed to pro
vide attendees a comfortable environment
to view the results regardless of their politi
cal leanings.
"The gathering was supposed to be a sort
of place where people could come and meet
together, to feel they can express whatever
their views are," said Irina Oberman *09,
president of the Stanford College
Republicans. "People don't want to argue
with their friends over political problems
sometimes. It doesn't have to be in your
face."
Many conservatives suggested that
Stanford is an overwhelmingly liberal cam
pus and that it can often be difficult to pres
ent alternative viewpoints. They viewed the
off-campus gathering as a place to voice
their own views in a more accepting atmos
phere.
"It's really offering another spectrum,"
Thomas Stilson '09. "Here you can be
amongst... like-minded supporters without
feeling like an outcast."
Garrett Taylor '12 said he thought the
CoHo party would not provide the same
atmosphere since some of the co-sponsors

seemed liberal leaning.
But Cameron Bell '09, one of the lead
organizers of the CoHo event, told The
Daily on Sunday that they had reached out
to conservative student groups on campus to
help organize the CoHo event.
"We reached out to l"he Review, the
Stanford Conservative Society and the
College Republicans, but there was not so
much interest there," said Bell, SlG's vice
chair of operations.

A race beyond race?
The historical significance of the first
African-American man elected as com
mander-in-chief was not lost on Stanford stu
dents across campus.
"It says a lot that less than half a century
ago, there were laws that prevented African-
Americans the use of even the same bath
rooms as white Americans," Olorunnipa, the
graduate student at the CoHo, said.
"This is huge for all African Americans,
minorities or anybody else who has ever
been discriminated against before or now,"
he added.
Some suggested that Obama's appeal
transcended racial lines. Colleen Okyere 'I I
said she felt race had faded as an issue in the
election as more people voted for candidates
because of the substance of their ideas, not
the color of their skin.
"As an African-American woman, that
makes me very happy," Okyere said.
But others, like TajahTubbs '12, a resident
in Ujamaa, suggested that some may be too
quick to assume that Obama's election
would overcome racial inequalities.
"It's good, but there's still progress to be
made," Tubbs said.
Much of the same could be said for
women seeking higher office. Although the
200K election saw the first competitive
female presidential candidate in Sen. Miliary
Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) and the first
female vice-presidential candidate on a
Republican ticket, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin,
the West Wing remained out of a woman's
grasp.
James Barton '09 supported Clinton dur
ing the hard-fought Democratic primaries
and felt that although Obama shared some
of Hillary's views, the victory was bitter
sweet.
"Hillary was the first politician I had a
true connection to," Barton said. "Her defeat
was crushing for me. I'm excited that Obama
won, but Hillary would have been better."

'Tomorrow'
Early returns from the East Coast inter
rupted lecture halls lull of students eagerly
anticipating the results. In a Hewlett lecture
hall, students and even teaching assistants
frequently checked their laptops throughout
a two-hour review session, breaking into
chatter as those leading the review session
switched between slides and election updates.
Some of the University's biggest political
junkies, however, weren't on campus.
About 25 students at Stanford in
Washington crowded around a lounge televi
sion to watch the returns, eating donkey- and
elephant-shaped cookies and coloring in
electoral maps as network news channels
made their projections. Joining them were
life-sized cutouts of the candidates.
Back on campus, enthusiasm for Obama's
victory swelled into a kind of pandemonium
in the Main Ouad as celebrants — reminis
cent of the revelry following Stanford foot
ball's upset victory over Southern California
last year — set a pile of newspapers and
nearby branches ablaze in front of Memorial
Church.The flames grew into a sizeable bon
fire before being neutralized by firefighters
who responded to the scene.
For many, the real celebrations would
start once Obama entered the Oval Office.
"There are so many problems right now.
and they're not going to be different tomor
row," Ailison l ink '12 said. "But for the first
time in eight years, there's a chance that it's
going to be better."

in the day. A Daily exit poll showed that the vast majority of voters were satisfied with polling conditions at the GCC.

Students at Ujamaa react to incoming election results. Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois swiftly picked up Electoral College votes to defeat
Sen. John McCain of Arizona in a landslide victory. Both campaigns had been in action for at least 1 8 months, culminating on Tuesday.
A makeshift bonfire broke out in the
Main Quad on Tuesday night as Stanford
students celebrated the election of Sen.
Barack Obama (D-III.) as the first African-
American president of the United States.
Red plastic cups were thrust high into the
air as students celebrated the landslide
Electoral College victory of the son of a
Kenyan father and Kansas mother who rose
from an unconventional upbringing to the
national spotlight after being elected to the
Senate just two years before.
Obama's calls for change mobilized hun
dreds of thousands of college students and
generated one of the highest turnouts of
young voters in the nation's history.
This heightened awareness was in no
short supply at Stanford, where early elec
tion returns from the E : .ast Coast made it dif
ficult for students to concentrate during
afternoon classes and threatened to pre
empt some of the celebrations planned for
later in the evening.
Hut even as national polls pointed
towards a decisive victory for Obama. stu
dents' enthusiasm could not be dampened
by the possibility of a predetermined out
come. Cheers erupted at the CoHo as sever
al hundred students attending a campus
wide Election Night party watched swing
state after swing state fall into Obama's col
umn.
"This is a historical moment." said Tolu
Olorunnipa MA '09.
Reactions were markedly subdued at a
small, off-campus gathering of conserva
tives. many of whom had been supporting
the candidacy of Obama's opponent. Sen.
John McCain (R-Ariz.).
"I've pretty much expected [the election]
to go for Obama." said Nathan Harnett '12
while watching results come in at a restau
rant on University Ave. "I held onto a little
hope, but the news has kind of made me a
little less optimistic."
'Never the likeliest candidate'
Obama's victory marked the culmination
of a nearly two-year election cycle that wit
nessed a long-fought primary battle, record
breaking fundraising efforts and a series of
historical milestones that shattered race and
gender harriers in the contest for the
nation's highest office.
"If there is anyone out there who still
doubts that America is a place where all
things are possible, who still wonders if the
dream of our founders is alive in our time,
who still questions the power of our democ
racy, tonight is your answer." Obama told an
estimated 125.000 people in Chicago.
Hie election night extravaganza at the
CoHo. sponsored by many of the
University's major political student groups,
was the largest of a number of election
watching gatherings taking place on and off
campus. At Hranner Hall, close to 50 fresh
men — many of whom voted in their first
presidential election — clustered around a
projection screen in the dorm's lounge to
watch the results filter in.
"I'm just excited to have a president that
I can believe in," said Ross Darwin "12 about

an hour before the polls closed in California.
"I don't remember being excited about a
president. Now I can be."
Acknowledging that he "was never the
likeliest candidate." Obama attributed his
success to the growth of a grassroots cam
paign that built on small donations and a
message of change that appealed to a
diverse cross-section of the American elec
torate.
"It grew from the young people who
rejected the myth of their generation's apa
thy. who left their homes and their families
for jobs that offered little pay and less
sleep." Obama said. "It drew strength from
the not-so-young people who braved the bit
ter cold and scorching heat to knock on
doors of perfect strangers, and from the mil
lions of Americans who volunteered and
organized and proved that more than two
centuries later a government of the people,
by the people and for the people has not
perished from the Earth."
'A Journey of Self-Discovery'
One of these volunteers was Elizabeth
D'Aunno '09. political co-director and chief
financial officer of the Stanford Democrats.

true connection to," Barton said. "Her defeat
was crushing for me. I'm excited that Obama
won, but Hillary would have been better."

'Tomorrow'
Early returns from the East Coast inter
rupted lecture halls lull of students eagerly
anticipating the results. In a Hewlett lecture
hall, students and even teaching assistants
frequently checked their laptops throughout
a two-hour review session, breaking into
chatter as those leading the review session
switched between slides and election updates.
Some of the University's biggest political
junkies, however, weren't on campus.
About 25 students at Stanford in
Washington crowded around a lounge televi
sion to watch the returns, eating donkey- and
elephant-shaped cookies and coloring in
electoral maps as network news channels
made their projections. Joining them were
life-sized cutouts of the candidates.
Back on campus, enthusiasm for Obama's
victory swelled into a kind of pandemonium
in the Main Ouad as celebrants — reminis
cent of the revelry following Stanford foot
ball's upset victory over Southern California
last year — set a pile of newspapers and
nearby branches ablaze in front of Memorial
Church.The flames grew into a sizeable bon
fire before being neutralized by firefighters
who responded to the scene.
For many, the real celebrations would
start once Obama entered the Oval Office.
"There are so many problems right now.
and they're not going to be different tomor
row," Ailison l ink '12 said. "But for the first
time in eight years, there's a chance that it's
going to be better."

Lines at the Graduate Community Center (GCC) stretched to an hour and a half when polls opened in the morning, but eased later
in the day. A Daily exit poll showed that the vast majority of voters were satisfied with polling conditions at the GCC.

Students at Ujamaa react to incoming election results. Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois swiftly picked up Electoral College votes to defeat
Sen. John McCain of Arizona in a landslide victory. Both campaigns had been in action for at least 1 8 months, culminating on Tuesday.
A makeshift bonfire broke out in the
Main Quad on Tuesday night as Stanford
students celebrated the election of Sen.
Barack Obama (D-III.) as the first African-
American president of the United States.
Red plastic cups were thrust high into the
air as students celebrated the landslide
Electoral College victory of the son of a
Kenyan father and Kansas mother who rose
from an unconventional upbringing to the
national spotlight after being elected to the
Senate just two years before.
Obama's calls for change mobilized hun
dreds of thousands of college students and
generated one of the highest turnouts of
young voters in the nation's history.
This heightened awareness was in no
short supply at Stanford, where early elec
tion returns from the E : .ast Coast made it dif
ficult for students to concentrate during
afternoon classes and threatened to pre
empt some of the celebrations planned for
later in the evening.
Hut even as national polls pointed
towards a decisive victory for Obama. stu
dents' enthusiasm could not be dampened
by the possibility of a predetermined out
come. Cheers erupted at the CoHo as sever
al hundred students attending a campus
wide Election Night party watched swing
state after swing state fall into Obama's col
umn.
"This is a historical moment." said Tolu
Olorunnipa MA '09.
Reactions were markedly subdued at a
small, off-campus gathering of conserva
tives. many of whom had been supporting
the candidacy of Obama's opponent. Sen.
John McCain (R-Ariz.).
"I've pretty much expected [the election]
to go for Obama." said Nathan Harnett '12
while watching results come in at a restau
rant on University Ave. "I held onto a little
hope, but the news has kind of made me a
little less optimistic."
'Never the likeliest candidate'
Obama's victory marked the culmination
of a nearly two-year election cycle that wit
nessed a long-fought primary battle, record
breaking fundraising efforts and a series of
historical milestones that shattered race and
gender harriers in the contest for the
nation's highest office.
"If there is anyone out there who still
doubts that America is a place where all
things are possible, who still wonders if the
dream of our founders is alive in our time,
who still questions the power of our democ
racy, tonight is your answer." Obama told an
estimated 125.000 people in Chicago.
Hie election night extravaganza at the
CoHo. sponsored by many of the
University's major political student groups,
was the largest of a number of election
watching gatherings taking place on and off
campus. At Hranner Hall, close to 50 fresh
men — many of whom voted in their first
presidential election — clustered around a
projection screen in the dorm's lounge to
watch the results filter in.
"I'm just excited to have a president that
I can believe in," said Ross Darwin "12 about

an hour before the polls closed in California.
"I don't remember being excited about a
president. Now I can be."
Acknowledging that he "was never the
likeliest candidate." Obama attributed his
success to the growth of a grassroots cam
paign that built on small donations and a
message of change that appealed to a
diverse cross-section of the American elec
torate.
"It grew from the young people who
rejected the myth of their generation's apa
thy. who left their homes and their families
for jobs that offered little pay and less
sleep." Obama said. "It drew strength from
the not-so-young people who braved the bit
ter cold and scorching heat to knock on
doors of perfect strangers, and from the mil
lions of Americans who volunteered and
organized and proved that more than two
centuries later a government of the people,
by the people and for the people has not
perished from the Earth."
'A Journey of Self-Discovery'
One of these volunteers was Elizabeth
D'Aunno '09. political co-director and chief
financial officer of the Stanford Democrats.

llinois Senator Barack Obama won a landslide victory over Arizona Senator John McCain on Tuesday to become the 44th president of the
Jnited States of America. Obama will now be expected to move quickly and may soon name key officials in his administration.


SAMMY ABUSRUR/The Stanford Daily
Students celebrated Barack Obama's presidential victory by lighting a bonfire in the Main Quad
last night. Revelers joined in chants of "Obama!" and sang "The Star-Spangled Banner."
who stopped out of Stanford last fall to cam
paign for Obama in lowa. She worked on a
team responsible for planning and executing
(he senator's appearances in lowa in
advance of the state's primary caucuses,
which ultimately gave Obama an early lead
on the path to his party's nomination.
Although her family had been living in
lowa. D'Aunno described her campaign
work as "a journey of self-discovery." By
bringing her in contact with residents of
other parts of the state. D'Aunno said the
campaign gave her an education in lowa's
politics that paralleled the same learning
curve Obama met as he canvassed the state.
"For me, it was the most formative expe
rience of my life." she said.
D'Aunno spent the early hours of
Election Night at the CoHo. where a stand
ing-room-only crowd was served free
nachos and beer while watching election
returns on four screens. The traditionally
low-key atmosphere of the campus coffee
house was decked out with shimmering red
and blue streamers. Face masks of the candi
dates and election-themed coloring books
were on hand for those who sought a break
from watching election coverage.
"It's been outstanding so far," said Eric
Showen '09, chair of Stanford in
Government (SIG), one of the co-sponsors
of the event. "It's exceeded my expectations.
People seem to be excited regardless of their
political affiliation."
The party, which was co-sponsored by the
ASSU. Stanford in Washington and the
Stanford Democrats, was billed as a non
partisan event. But the crowd overwhelm
ingly supported Obama's candidacy, often
counting down the seconds to network pro
jections and cheering for each state decided
in Obama's favor. States that went red were

usually met by jeers from those assembled.
"I'm more of an Obama guy, but I like
both candidates," said Will Young '09, who
attended the CoHo party. "So when people
here boo McCain whenever he wins a state.
I don't join in. He doesn't deserve that."
'Another Spectrum'
The increasingly rowdy atmosphere at
the CoHo contrasted with a smaller, quieter
gathering of conservative students watching
the election results on a small television at
Round Table Pizza in Palo Alto.
Organizers said the event, co-hosted bv
The Stanford Review and the Stanford
College Republicans, was designed to pro
vide attendees a comfortable environment
to view the results regardless of their politi
cal leanings.
"The gathering was supposed to be a sort
of place where people could come and meet
together, to feel they can express whatever
their views are," said Irina Oberman *09,
president of the Stanford College
Republicans. "People don't want to argue
with their friends over political problems
sometimes. It doesn't have to be in your
face."
Many conservatives suggested that
Stanford is an overwhelmingly liberal cam
pus and that it can often be difficult to pres
ent alternative viewpoints. They viewed the
off-campus gathering as a place to voice
their own views in a more accepting atmos
phere.
"It's really offering another spectrum,"
Thomas Stilson '09. "Here you can be
amongst... like-minded supporters without
feeling like an outcast."
Garrett Taylor '12 said he thought the
CoHo party would not provide the same
atmosphere since some of the co-sponsors

seemed liberal leaning.
But Cameron Bell '09, one of the lead
organizers of the CoHo event, told The
Daily on Sunday that they had reached out
to conservative student groups on campus to
help organize the CoHo event.
"We reached out to l"he Review, the
Stanford Conservative Society and the
College Republicans, but there was not so
much interest there," said Bell, SlG's vice
chair of operations.

A race beyond race?
The historical significance of the first
African-American man elected as com
mander-in-chief was not lost on Stanford stu
dents across campus.
"It says a lot that less than half a century
ago, there were laws that prevented African-
Americans the use of even the same bath
rooms as white Americans," Olorunnipa, the
graduate student at the CoHo, said.
"This is huge for all African Americans,
minorities or anybody else who has ever
been discriminated against before or now,"
he added.
Some suggested that Obama's appeal
transcended racial lines. Colleen Okyere 'I I
said she felt race had faded as an issue in the
election as more people voted for candidates
because of the substance of their ideas, not
the color of their skin.
"As an African-American woman, that
makes me very happy," Okyere said.
But others, like TajahTubbs '12, a resident
in Ujamaa, suggested that some may be too
quick to assume that Obama's election
would overcome racial inequalities.
"It's good, but there's still progress to be
made," Tubbs said.
Much of the same could be said for
women seeking higher office. Although the
200K election saw the first competitive
female presidential candidate in Sen. Miliary
Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) and the first
female vice-presidential candidate on a
Republican ticket, Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin,
the West Wing remained out of a woman's
grasp.
James Barton '09 supported Clinton dur
ing the hard-fought Democratic primaries
and felt that although Obama shared some
of Hillary's views, the victory was bitter
sweet.
"Hillary was the first politician I had a
true connection to," Barton said. "Her defeat
was crushing for me. I'm excited that Obama
won, but Hillary would have been better."

Early returns from the East Coast inter
rupted lecture halls lull of students eagerly
