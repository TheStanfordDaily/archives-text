# 'CHANGE HAS COME'
## Barack Obama elected first African-American president 
### THEO MILONOPOULOS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A makeshift bonfire broke out in the
Main Quad on Tuesday night as Stanford
students celebrated the election of Sen.
Barack Obama (D-III.) as the first African-
American president of the United States.
Red plastic cups were thrust high into the
air as students celebrated the landslide
Electoral College victory of the son of a
Kenyan father and Kansas mother who rose
from an unconventional upbringing to the
national spotlight after being elected to the
Senate just two years before.
Obama's calls for change mobilized hun
dreds of thousands of college students and
generated one of the highest turnouts of
young voters in the nation's history.
This heightened awareness was in no
short supply at Stanford, where early elec
tion returns from the E : .ast Coast made it dif
ficult for students to concentrate during
afternoon classes and threatened to pre
empt some of the celebrations planned for
later in the evening.
Hut even as national polls pointed
towards a decisive victory for Obama. stu
dents' enthusiasm could not be dampened
by the possibility of a predetermined out
come. Cheers erupted at the CoHo as sever
al hundred students attending a campus
wide Election Night party watched swing
state after swing state fall into Obama's col
umn.
"This is a historical moment." said Tolu
Olorunnipa MA '09.
Reactions were markedly subdued at a
small, off-campus gathering of conserva
tives. many of whom had been supporting
the candidacy of Obama's opponent. Sen.
John McCain (R-Ariz.).
"I've pretty much expected [the election]
to go for Obama." said Nathan Harnett '12
while watching results come in at a restau
rant on University Ave. "I held onto a little
hope, but the news has kind of made me a
little less optimistic."
'Never the likeliest candidate'
Obama's victory marked the culmination
of a nearly two-year election cycle that wit
nessed a long-fought primary battle, record
breaking fundraising efforts and a series of
historical milestones that shattered race and
gender harriers in the contest for the
nation's highest office.
"If there is anyone out there who still
doubts that America is a place where all
things are possible, who still wonders if the
dream of our founders is alive in our time,
who still questions the power of our democ
racy, tonight is your answer." Obama told an
estimated 125.000 people in Chicago.
Hie election night extravaganza at the
CoHo. sponsored by many of the
University's major political student groups,
was the largest of a number of election
watching gatherings taking place on and off
campus. At Hranner Hall, close to 50 fresh
men — many of whom voted in their first
presidential election — clustered around a
projection screen in the dorm's lounge to
watch the results filter in.
"I'm just excited to have a president that
I can believe in," said Ross Darwin "12 about

an hour before the polls closed in California.
"I don't remember being excited about a
president. Now I can be."
Acknowledging that he "was never the
likeliest candidate." Obama attributed his
success to the growth of a grassroots cam
paign that built on small donations and a
message of change that appealed to a
diverse cross-section of the American elec
torate.
"It grew from the young people who
rejected the myth of their generation's apa
thy. who left their homes and their families
for jobs that offered little pay and less
sleep." Obama said. "It drew strength from
the not-so-young people who braved the bit
ter cold and scorching heat to knock on
doors of perfect strangers, and from the mil
lions of Americans who volunteered and
organized and proved that more than two
centuries later a government of the people,
by the people and for the people has not
perished from the Earth."
'A Journey of Self-Discovery'
One of these volunteers was Elizabeth
D'Aunno '09. political co-director and chief
financial officer of the Stanford Democrats.
