# SENIOR STANDOUTS
## 
### BY JACOB JOHNSON 
TThe Stanford men's soccer team
hates to lose. And head coach Bret
Simon just might hate it more than
anyone. In 29 years of collegiate
coaching, Simon has only produced
a handful of losing seasons; unfortunately, three
of them have come over the last six years.
"I haven't had too many of them," Simon
said."We enter every game and season with high
expectations."
This year, the Cardinal squad has fallen short
of those expectations. After dropping both con
tests on last weekend's Southern California road
trip, the team is 3-10-2 overall.
"We're all disappointed," Simon said. But he
emphasized that all is not lost — despite its
mediocre record, the team has made significant
progress.
"We also know that we're playing well,"
Simon continued. "We're just a piece or two
away."
Stanford will look to its younger players to fill
in those missing pieces. Coach Simon specifically
called on the class of 2011 to contribute next
year.
"This year's sophomore class is a big, talented
class," Simon said, adding that they need to grow
from being "important pieces" to the "heart and
soul of the team." Although the class of 2010 will
provide strong leadership next season. Simon
wants his underclassmen to start to "develop as
leaders of the team."
The Cardinal hopes that it will also retain the
services of two of this year's seniors for the 2009
season. TJ Novak suffered a hamstring injury in
the 66th minute against Drake on Sept. 21. and
has been unable to play since. Redshirt senior
Evan Morgan will have surgery in about a week
to correct a torn knee ligament suffered early in
the season. Both have applied to the NCAA for
an extra year of eligibility because of medical
hardship.
Although being granted a medical redshirt is
by no means a guarantee, Simon thinks that his
players will be able to come back for one more
vear of soccer on the Farm.

"We think Evan and TJ fit the definition of
"medical hardship,'" he said. "Having those two
back would be a big help."
With or without the leadership of Morgan
and Novak, the team must replace the rest of its
graduating seniors. That will be no small task,
given that Stanford will graduate eight seniors
this year — not including the two redshirt appli
cants. Simon hopes that the incoming freshman
class will help to compensate for the loss of a big
and talented senior class.
"We have a number of guys with national ex
perience coming in [next year]." he said. Al
though the team cannot announce its class of
2013 until signing day in February. Simon ap
pears confident that next year's freshmen will be
able to contribute right away — especially on of
fense.
"That's been the focus since I've been here,
getting top attacking players." he said.
Even with a superstar recruiting class. Simon
will miss his seniors.
"We ended up with 10 after starting with six
or seven [in the class of *09]", said Simon, refer
ring to the additions to the class via a walk-on. a
transfer and injuries that resulted in medical red
shirts for other players. "I'm really fond of this
group — they make my job fun."
Ryan Imamura transferred to Stanford from
Cornell after his freshman year.The redshirt sen
ior suffered his share of injuries during his years
on the Farm, but "last year he really blossomed."
Simon said. "I think he's the best center-mid in
the conference. He's the core of our defense. I'm
really proud of him."
Another standout senior is defender Tim
Jones. A four-year starter. Simon describes Jones
as "talented." an "exciting player" and "fun to
coach." Jones' has utilized his blazing speed as an
attacking defender.
"[Defenders] who can help the attack" are
valuable and rare. Simon said — especially for a
Stanford squad that has struggled to score goals.
Jones' quickness and playmaking ability at out
side back will definitely be missed.
Another starter Simon praised was redshirt
senior Tom Montgomery. Simon describes the

former walk-on as a
"workaholic" and a
"self-made player." The
head coach gave Mont
gomery perhaps the
biggest compliment of
all: "Nobody works
harder than him."
But Simon stressed
that it wasn't just the on
field contributions from
his seniors that would
be missed. Redshirt sen
ior Enrique Allen is a
"wonderful person and
a team leader." Simon
said. "[Allen] got a
chance to play this year,
and he hasn't let go.
He's one of those guys
you really root for."
Goalie Josh Nesbit is
another player who has
made huge contribu
tions as a team leader,
despite limited minutes.
Nesbit has been a back
up for his entire colle
giate career. Still. Simon
heaped on the praise:
"Josh is just awe
some." he said. "He is
one of the favorite peo
ple I've coached in 29
years. Everyday he
comes out with a good
attitude and leads the
team."
One of the Cardinal's
main goals next year will

be to improve its offensive production. Simon
expects to make some changes to Stanford's sys
tem. hut they will he relatively minor adjust
ments. The personnel on the team will determine
the style of play, Simon said.
"The system that fits the players is ultimately
the hest system."

"I'm sure [the team] won't look exactly the
same [next year]," he added."But I don't antici
pate any dramatic changes."
Except, the Cardinal hopes, a lot more goals
and wins.
