This article was reported by An Le Nguyen

The $7()-niillion campaign to overturn
California's Proposition 8 quickly lost trac
tion Tuesday night as poll results showed
California voters leaning toward overturning

same-sex marriage in the state. As of press
time, 52 percent of voters favored passage of
the proposition, with 89 percent of precincts
reporting.
During the weeks leading up to Tuesday's
election, much of the Stanford community
lashed out against Prop. 8. II passed, the
proposition would amend the Golden State's
Constitution to "eliminate the right of same
sex couples to marry in California."

"It's such an unjust, immoral proposition
that threatens to take away people's rights
and the love that people share," said Amanda
Gelender '10, founder of the Stanford Theatre
Activist Mobilization Project (STAMP). "I'm
disgusted by the proponents of this initiative,
and I felt propelled to do something."
Both gay and straight members of the
community gathered at the LGBT
Communitv Resource Center on Tuesday

night to watch the election returns.
"It's great to get people together," said
fourth-year medical student Mitch Lunn.
"especially when people share the same inter
ests and beliefs on issues."
"Students are really focused on being
here." Gelender added. "We're kind of shar
ing this really intimate moment together."
Many students were anxious
throughout the day. unsure of what to
anticipate when early results began
rolling in during the evening hours.
"1 have never been so afraidsaid
Greg, an anti-Prop. 8 organizer who
asked to keep his last name confiden
tial for privacy reasons. "This is too
much."
"I've been nervous all day." added
A-lan Holt "11 on Tuesday evening.
"California is split for Prop. 8, so I'm
nervous but also hopeful."
Several students cried while watch
ing the returns. Gelender noted.
On the other side of the fence stood
many supporters of Prop 8. including
Mike Bailey, a PhD candidate in eco
nomics. Bailey only supports marriage
between a man and a woman, because
he believes marriage is an institution
meant to nurture natural children.
"Marriage is a societal institution
that teaches people what they need to
do to raise children in the world," he
said. "I fear that the consequences
down the line are people seeing mar

riage as a way to get personal happi
ness— and they lose sight about the
kids. Marriage is fundamentally about
the children it creates."
Stanford faculty members also
weighed in on the issue, many of whom
signed an online petition against Prop.
8 that began circulating on Oct. 28.
Larry Diamond, petition signatory
and senior fellow at the Hoover
Institution, called it "particularly dis
turbing" that an initiative — Prop. 8 —
aimed to reverse a decision by the
California Supreme Court.
The Supreme Court approved
same-sex marriage in a ruling on May
15 of this year.
"Gays should have the right to
marry, to have their union fully recog
nized by the state." Diamond told The
Daily earlier this week.
Bailey noted that his differences
with opponents of Prop. 8 are not per
sonal. but stem simply from a different
definition of marriage.
"All of us on the 'yes' side have gay
friends and family whom we love," he
said. "Even if it does pass. I'm not
going to be happy because I know how
much pain my gay friends will suffer. It
will be bittersweet."
In opposition to what many "No on
Prop. 8" supporters are viewing as

temporary defeat, a rally and March
will be held today at 12:30 p.m. in
White Plaza.
Proposition 4
Over the past few weeks, opposi
tion to Prop. 8 has grown hand-in-hand
with opposition to Prop. 4. which, if
passed, would prohibit abortion for a
minor until 4K hours after a physician
notifies her parent.
As of press time. 53 percent of vot
ers opposed the proposition, with 89
percent of precincts reporting.
Amy Herbertson '11, publicity
coordinator for the Women's
Community Center, said "a lot of dia
logue" was held at the center during
the past few weeks.The center actively
supported a no vote on Prop. 4.
"We hosted a debate in the center,
and we tried to provide a space for
people to have these types of discus
sions," Herbertson said.
Regardless of whether or not Prop.
4 passes. Herbertson pointed to Vice
President-elect Joe Biden as a support
er of women's rights, noting that he
"has a fabulous record."
