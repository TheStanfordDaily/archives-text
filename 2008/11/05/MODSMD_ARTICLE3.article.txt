The $7()-niillion campaign to overturn
California's Proposition 8 quickly lost trac
tion Tuesday night as poll results showed
California voters leaning toward overturning

same-sex marriage in the state. As of press
time, 52 percent of voters favored passage of
the proposition, with 89 percent of precincts
reporting.
During the weeks leading up to Tuesday's
election, much of the Stanford community
lashed out against Prop. 8. II passed, the
proposition would amend the Golden State's
Constitution to "eliminate the right of same
sex couples to marry in California."

"It's such an unjust, immoral proposition
that threatens to take away people's rights
and the love that people share," said Amanda
Gelender '10, founder of the Stanford Theatre
Activist Mobilization Project (STAMP). "I'm
disgusted by the proponents of this initiative,
and I felt propelled to do something."
Both gay and straight members of the
community gathered at the LGBT
Communitv Resource Center on Tuesday

night to watch the election returns.
"It's great to get people together," said
fourth-year medical student Mitch Lunn.
"especially when people share the same inter
ests and beliefs on issues."
"Students are really focused on being
here." Gelender added. "We're kind of shar
ing this really intimate moment together."
