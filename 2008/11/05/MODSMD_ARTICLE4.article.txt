# ELECTION '08
## Stanford vote goes to Obama 90 percent at GCC choose Obama, says exit poll 
### JAMES HOHMANN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Reflecting an overwhelming
desire for change, President-elect
Barack Obama received nearly 90
percent of the votes cast at
Stanford's main polling place
Tuesday, according to exit polling
conducted by The Daily.
Election officials reported that,
from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.. roughly 1.000
ballots were cast at the Graduate
Community Center (GCC). In 147
anonymous surveys, distributed
throughout the day to a random
sample primarily composed of stu
dents. voters also expressed strong
opposition to Proposition 8. the
measure to ban same-sex marriage,
and Proposition 4. which would
require doctors to notify the parents
of a minor seeking an abortion.
In line with support for Obama's
candidacy. 89 percent of those sur
veyed said the country has been on the
wrong track. Ninety-six percent dis
approved of President George W.
Bush's performance.
After several days of rain and
inclement weather, the skies parted
for Election Day. The morning saw
the longest lines, with voters who
came at 8 a.m. waiting up to an hour
and a half. A few graduate students
grilled hotdogs and burgers for voters
leaving the polling place in the after
noon.
Caught off guard by record
turnout in the February primary, the
Santa Clara County Registrar of
Voters prepared for long lines this
time around, sending more poll work
ers and bringing extra equipment.
One issue arose, however, when
several students with addresses on
the Upper Row and in the Cowell
Cluster discovered that, in order to
vote, they needed to go to Escondido
Elementary School on Stanford Ave.
About 280 votes were cast at the
school during the day, mostly from
community members.
Aside from the polling place con
fusion and the GCC running short on
provisional ballot envelopes, election
workers and most voters said they
were satisfied.
A majority of polled voters identi
fied the economy as the most impor
tant factor in their decision. National
security, including the wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan, was most important
to 17 percent of those polled. While
13 percent of the Stanford sample
said the war in Iraq has been worth
the costs. 44 percent believed it was
"absolutely not."
Virtually all the supporters of Sen.
John McCain (R-Ariz.) said the war
in Iraq was worth the cost. One-tenth
of those surveyed felt moral or social
issues were most important.
Four in 10 polled were voting for
the first time.
"It feels so exciting, so incredible
that this is the first election we can
vote in." said Jenny Depierre '10. an
Obama supporter.
A number of provisional ballots
were cast by first-time voters who did
not receive their absentee ballots or
provide their documentation in time
for the election. Absentee voters reg

istered to vote in other California
counties encountered difficulties
when submitting ballots.
"The assumption is that they can
drop off ballots from outside of the
county," said Dan Gentile, an assis
tant trainer with the county who
worked at the GCC on Tuesday.
"That's false."
A third of those surveyed bv The
Daily said that they changed the state
they were registered in so they could
cast a ballot in the Golden State — a
choice typically motivated by a desire
to vote on the referendums.
Both of the most controversial bal
lot initiatives were opposed by more
than three-fourths of those surveyed,
although twice as many supported the
parental notification measure (25
percent) as the marriage ban. Eight of
the 19 people who voted for
Proposition 8 also supported Obama.
Throughout the day, volunteers
waved signs urging a yes vote on
Prop. 2. a measure intended to restrict
animal cruelty, while others handed
out flyers advocating gay rights.
"People think we're in California,
by the Bay, and so they'll think. 'Of
course, it won't pass,'" said Tamika
Butler, a gay third-year law student
who rallied to oppose Prop. 8. "But
it's still really important to vote."
Jamila Rufaro, the election official
responsible for overseeing the opera
tion at the GCC, said the day went
"really smoothly." The polling places
were quieter than she had expected
during the normally busy lunch hour,
as well as the period after the end of
the workday, around 5 p.m.
"Most of the machines worked
fine," said Rufaro, who also serves as
residence dean for Florence Moore,
Lagunita and Roble. "There was
enough room for everyone. People
seemed generally comfortable."
Many counties report election
results precinct by precinct, but Santa
Clara County combines votes from
multiple polling places before passing
tallies to the central office. Exit polls
offer a more meaningful sense of how
voters on the Farm felt about the can
didates and issues. Countywide, with
two-thirds of votes reported, Obama
was ahead of McCain by a margin of
40 percent — 69 to 29. Statewide.

Obama led McCain by 24 points, 61 to
37.
The Daily set out to poll every sev
enth voter throughout the day.
Among those not included in this
sample are students who submitted
absentee ballots, either to the
California county where they main
tain residency or in their home state.
Most voters walked to the GCC,
but many came on bicycle.
Throughout the day, a handful of
voters parked illegally in the bike
lane on Escondido Dr.. leaving their
flashers on as they waited. Amid the
noise from a nearby construction site,
those in line stayed relatively quiet.
On Super Tuesday, when the
Democratic nomination was up for
grabs. The Daily's exit poll found that
75 percent of students supported
Obama. On Tuesday, all 21 percent of
those who said they had supported
Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.) in the
primary voted for Obama.
McCain's support came almost
exclusively from white students.
Three admitted that Obama's race
made them less likely to support him.
None of the three voted for him.
About one-third of respondents
said Obama being an African
American made them more likely to
vote for him. Only 17 percent of those
who gave that answer were them
selves black.
As the sun set and the networks
called Pennsylvania for Obama. mak
ing it clear he would win. students
continued to vote.
"I think that every American
should exercise their right to vote."
said James McGillicuddv '09, "regard
less of the projected outcome."
Rufaro told several people they
couldn't wear Obama buttons as they
waited.
"Sorry but that's electioneering,"
she said.

Reflecting an overwhelming
desire for change, President-elect
Barack Obama received nearly 90
percent of the votes cast at
Stanford's main polling place
Tuesday, according to exit polling
conducted by The Daily.
Election officials reported that,
from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.. roughly 1.000
ballots were cast at the Graduate
Community Center (GCC). In 147
anonymous surveys, distributed
throughout the day to a random
sample primarily composed of stu
dents. voters also expressed strong
opposition to Proposition 8. the
measure to ban same-sex marriage,
and Proposition 4. which would
require doctors to notify the parents
of a minor seeking an abortion.
In line with support for Obama's
candidacy. 89 percent of those sur
veyed said the country has been on the
wrong track. Ninety-six percent dis
approved of President George W.
Bush's performance.
After several days of rain and
inclement weather, the skies parted
for Election Day. The morning saw
the longest lines, with voters who
came at 8 a.m. waiting up to an hour
and a half. A few graduate students
grilled hotdogs and burgers for voters
leaving the polling place in the after
noon.
Caught off guard by record
turnout in the February primary, the
Santa Clara County Registrar of
Voters prepared for long lines this
time around, sending more poll work
ers and bringing extra equipment.
One issue arose, however, when
several students with addresses on
the Upper Row and in the Cowell
Cluster discovered that, in order to
vote, they needed to go to Escondido
Elementary School on Stanford Ave.
About 280 votes were cast at the
school during the day, mostly from
community members.
Aside from the polling place con
fusion and the GCC running short on
provisional ballot envelopes, election
workers and most voters said they
were satisfied.
A majority of polled voters identi
fied the economy as the most impor
tant factor in their decision. National
security, including the wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan, was most important
to 17 percent of those polled. While
13 percent of the Stanford sample
said the war in Iraq has been worth
the costs. 44 percent believed it was
"absolutely not."
Virtually all the supporters of Sen.
John McCain (R-Ariz.) said the war
in Iraq was worth the cost. One-tenth
of those surveyed felt moral or social
issues were most important.
Four in 10 polled were voting for
the first time.
"It feels so exciting, so incredible
that this is the first election we can
vote in." said Jenny Depierre '10. an
Obama supporter.
A number of provisional ballots
were cast by first-time voters who did
not receive their absentee ballots or
provide their documentation in time
for the election. Absentee voters reg

istered to vote in other California
counties encountered difficulties
when submitting ballots.
"The assumption is that they can
drop off ballots from outside of the
county," said Dan Gentile, an assis
tant trainer with the county who
worked at the GCC on Tuesday.
"That's false."
A third of those surveyed bv The
Daily said that they changed the state
they were registered in so they could
cast a ballot in the Golden State — a
choice typically motivated by a desire
to vote on the referendums.
Both of the most controversial bal
lot initiatives were opposed by more
than three-fourths of those surveyed,
although twice as many supported the
parental notification measure (25
percent) as the marriage ban. Eight of
the 19 people who voted for
Proposition 8 also supported Obama.
Throughout the day, volunteers
waved signs urging a yes vote on
Prop. 2. a measure intended to restrict
animal cruelty, while others handed
out flyers advocating gay rights.
"People think we're in California,
by the Bay, and so they'll think. 'Of
course, it won't pass,'" said Tamika
Butler, a gay third-year law student
who rallied to oppose Prop. 8. "But
it's still really important to vote."
