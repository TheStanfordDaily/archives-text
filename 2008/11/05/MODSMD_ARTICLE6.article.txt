# ELECTION DAY 2008
## ELECTION '08 Triumphant Obama turns to challenges 
### TERRENCE HUNT THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON — His name
etched in history as America's first
black president, Barack Obama
turned from the jubilation of victory
to the sobering challenge of leading
a nation worried about economic cri
sis, two unfinished wars and global
uncertainty.
"The road ahead will be long. Our
climb will be steep," Obama cau
tioned.
Young and charismatic but with
little experience on the national
level, Obama smashed through
racial barriers and easily defeated
Republican John McCain to become
the first African-American destined
to sit in the Oval Office, America's
44th president. He was the first
Democrat to receive more than 50
percent of the popular vote since
Jimmy Carter in 1976.
"It's been a long time coming, but
tonight, because of what we did on
this date in this election at this defin
ing moment, change has come to
America," Obama told a victory rally
of 125,000 people jammed into
Chicago's Grant Park.
Obama scored an Electoral
College landslide that redrew
America's political map. He won
states that reliably voted Republican
in presidential elections, like Indiana
and Virginia, which hadn't supported
the Democratic candidate in 44
years. Ohio and Florida, key to
Bush's twin victories, also went for
Obama, as did Pennsylvania, which

McCain had deemed crucial for his
election hopes.
With just 76 days until the inaugu
ration, Obama is expected to move
quickly to begin assembling a White
House staff and selecting Cabinet
nominees.
Campaign officials said Illinois
Rep. Rahm Emanuel was the front
runner to be Obama's chief of staff.
The advisers spoke on a condition of
anonymity because the announce
ment had not yet been made.
Democrats expanded their
majority in both houses of Congress.
In the Senate, Democrats ousted
Republicans Elizabeth Dole of
North Carolina and John Sununu of
New Hampshire and captured seats
held by retiring GOP senators in
Virginia, New Mexico and Colorado.
Still, the GOP blocked a complete
rout, holding the Kentucky seat of
Senate Minority Leader Mitch
McConnell and a Mississippi seat
once held by Trent Lott — two top
Democratic targets.
In the House, with fewer than a
dozen races still undecided.
Democrats captured Republican
held seats in the Northeast, South
and West and were on a path to pick
up as many as 20 seats.
When Obama and running mate
Joe Biden take their oath of office on
Jan. 20. Democrats will control both
the White House and Congress for
the first time since 1994.
"It is not a mandate for a party or
ideology but a mandate for change,"
said Senate Majority Leader Harry
Reid of Nevada.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of
California said: "Tonight the
American people have called for a
new direction. They have called for
change in America."
After the longest and costliest
campaign in U.S. history. Obama was
propelled to victory by voters dis
mayed by eight years of George W.
Bush's presidency and deeply anx
ious about rising unemployment and
home foreclosures and a battered
stock market that has erased tril
lions of dollars of savings for
Americans.
Six in 10 voters picked the econ
omy as the most important issue fac
ing the nation in an Associated Press
exit poll. None of the other top
issues — energy, Iraq, terrorism and
health care — was selected by more
than one in 10. Obama has promised
to cut taxes for most Americans, get
the United States out of Iraq and
expand health care, including
mandatory coverage for children.
Obama acknowledged that
repairing the economy and dealing
with problems at home and overseas
will not happen quickly. "We may
not get there in one year or even in
one term," he said. "But. America, I
have never been more hopeful than I
am tonight that we will get there. I
promise you. we as a people will get
there."
McCain conceded defeat shortly
after 11 p.m. EST. telling supporters
outside the Arizona Biltmore Hotel,
"The American people have spoken,
and they have spoken clearly."
"This is an historic election, and

1 recognize the special significance
it has for African-Americans and
the special pride that must be theirs
tonight," McCain said. "These are
difficult times for our country. And
I pledge to him tonight to do all in
my power to help him lead us
through the many challenges we
face."
Obama faces a staggering list of
problems, and he mentioned some of
them in his victory speech. "Even as
we celebrate tonight, we know the
challenges that tomorrow will bring
are the greatest of our lifetime —
two wars, a planet in peril, the worst
financial crisis in a century." He
spoke of parents who worry about
paying their mortgages and medical
bills.
"There will be setbacks and false
starts." Obama said. "There are
many who won't agree with every
decision or policy I make as presi
dent. And we know the government
can't solve every problem."
The son of a Kenyan father and a
white mother from Kansas, the 47-
year-old Obama has had a startlingly
rapid rise, from lawyer and commu
nity organizer to state legislator and
U.S. senator, now just four years into
his first term. He is the first senator
elected to the White House since
John F. Kennedy in 1960.
Bush called Obama with congrat
ulations at 11:12 p.m. EST. "I prom
ise to make this a smooth transition,"
the president said. "You are about to
go on one of the great journeys of
life. Congratulations and go enjoy
yourself." I le invited Obama and his

family to visit the White House soon.
Bush planned to make a state
ment about the election at midmorn
ing Wednesday in the Rose Garden.
With most U.S. precincts tallied,
the popular vote was 51.9 percent for
Obama and 46.8 percent for
McCain. But the count in the
Electoral College was lopsided in
Obama's favor over McCain—349
to 147 as of early Wednesday, with
three states still to be decided. Those
were North Carolina. Georgia and
Missouri.
Obama won California,
Colorado. Connecticut. Delaware,
the District of Columbia, Florida,
Hawaii. Illinois, Indiana, lowa,
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan. Minnesota, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New
Mexico. New York, Ohio. Oregon.
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Virginia. Vermont. Washington and
Wisconsin.
McCain had Alabama, Arizona,
Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky.
Louisiana, Mississippi. Montana.
Nebraska, North Dakota,
Oklahoma. South Carolina. South
Dakota. Tennessee, Texas, Utah.
West Virginia and Wyoming. I le also

won at least 3 of Nebraska's five
electoral votes, with the other two in
doubt.
Almost six in 10 women support
ed Obama nationwide, while men
leaned his way by a narrow margin,
according to interviews with voters.
Just over half of whites supported
McCain, giving him a slim advantage
in a group that Bush carried over
whelmingly in 2004.
The results of the AP survey were
based on a preliminary partial sam
ple of nearly 10.000 voters in
Election Day polls and in telephone
interviews over the past week for
early voters.
In terms of turnout. America
voted in record numbers. It looks
like 136.6 million Americans will
have voted for president this elec
tion. based on 88 percent of the
country's precincts tallied and pro
jections for absentee ballots, said
Michael McDonald of George
Mason University. Using his meth
ods. that would give 2008 a 64.1 per
cent turnout rate.
"That would be the highest
turnout rate that we've seen since
1908." which was 65.7 percent,
McDonald said earlv Wednesday.

Students in Roble's lounge jump to their feet as CNN projects Illinois
Senator Barack Obama as the next President of the United States. Obama
decisively defeated Arizona Senator John McCain in an historic election.
WASHINGTON — His name
etched in history as America's first
black president, Barack Obama
turned from the jubilation of victory
to the sobering challenge of leading
a nation worried about economic cri
sis, two unfinished wars and global
uncertainty.
"The road ahead will be long. Our
climb will be steep," Obama cau
tioned.
Young and charismatic but with
little experience on the national
level, Obama smashed through
racial barriers and easily defeated
Republican John McCain to become
the first African-American destined
to sit in the Oval Office, America's
44th president. He was the first
Democrat to receive more than 50
percent of the popular vote since
Jimmy Carter in 1976.
"It's been a long time coming, but
tonight, because of what we did on
this date in this election at this defin
ing moment, change has come to
America," Obama told a victory rally
of 125,000 people jammed into
Chicago's Grant Park.
Obama scored an Electoral
College landslide that redrew
America's political map. He won
states that reliably voted Republican
in presidential elections, like Indiana
and Virginia, which hadn't supported
the Democratic candidate in 44
years. Ohio and Florida, key to
Bush's twin victories, also went for
Obama, as did Pennsylvania, which

McCain had deemed crucial for his
election hopes.
With just 76 days until the inaugu
ration, Obama is expected to move
quickly to begin assembling a White
House staff and selecting Cabinet
nominees.
Campaign officials said Illinois
Rep. Rahm Emanuel was the front
runner to be Obama's chief of staff.
The advisers spoke on a condition of
anonymity because the announce
ment had not yet been made.
Democrats expanded their
majority in both houses of Congress.
In the Senate, Democrats ousted
Republicans Elizabeth Dole of
North Carolina and John Sununu of
New Hampshire and captured seats
held by retiring GOP senators in
Virginia, New Mexico and Colorado.
Still, the GOP blocked a complete
rout, holding the Kentucky seat of
Senate Minority Leader Mitch
McConnell and a Mississippi seat
once held by Trent Lott — two top
Democratic targets.
In the House, with fewer than a
dozen races still undecided.
Democrats captured Republican
held seats in the Northeast, South
and West and were on a path to pick
up as many as 20 seats.
When Obama and running mate
Joe Biden take their oath of office on
Jan. 20. Democrats will control both
the White House and Congress for
the first time since 1994.
"It is not a mandate for a party or
ideology but a mandate for change,"
said Senate Majority Leader Harry
Reid of Nevada.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of
California said: "Tonight the
American people have called for a
new direction. They have called for
change in America."
After the longest and costliest
campaign in U.S. history. Obama was
propelled to victory by voters dis
mayed by eight years of George W.
Bush's presidency and deeply anx
ious about rising unemployment and
home foreclosures and a battered
stock market that has erased tril
lions of dollars of savings for
Americans.
Six in 10 voters picked the econ
omy as the most important issue fac
ing the nation in an Associated Press
exit poll. None of the other top
issues — energy, Iraq, terrorism and
health care — was selected by more
than one in 10. Obama has promised
to cut taxes for most Americans, get
the United States out of Iraq and
expand health care, including
mandatory coverage for children.
Obama acknowledged that
repairing the economy and dealing
with problems at home and overseas
will not happen quickly. "We may
not get there in one year or even in
one term," he said. "But. America, I
have never been more hopeful than I
am tonight that we will get there. I
promise you. we as a people will get
there."
McCain conceded defeat shortly
after 11 p.m. EST. telling supporters
outside the Arizona Biltmore Hotel,
"The American people have spoken,
and they have spoken clearly."
"This is an historic election, and

1 recognize the special significance
it has for African-Americans and
the special pride that must be theirs
tonight," McCain said. "These are
difficult times for our country. And
I pledge to him tonight to do all in
my power to help him lead us
through the many challenges we
face."
Obama faces a staggering list of
problems, and he mentioned some of
them in his victory speech. "Even as
we celebrate tonight, we know the
challenges that tomorrow will bring
are the greatest of our lifetime —
two wars, a planet in peril, the worst
financial crisis in a century." He
spoke of parents who worry about
paying their mortgages and medical
bills.
"There will be setbacks and false
starts." Obama said. "There are
many who won't agree with every
decision or policy I make as presi
dent. And we know the government
can't solve every problem."
The son of a Kenyan father and a
white mother from Kansas, the 47-
year-old Obama has had a startlingly
rapid rise, from lawyer and commu
nity organizer to state legislator and
U.S. senator, now just four years into
his first term. He is the first senator
elected to the White House since
John F. Kennedy in 1960.
Bush called Obama with congrat
ulations at 11:12 p.m. EST. "I prom
ise to make this a smooth transition,"
the president said. "You are about to
go on one of the great journeys of
life. Congratulations and go enjoy
yourself." I le invited Obama and his

family to visit the White House soon.
Bush planned to make a state
ment about the election at midmorn
ing Wednesday in the Rose Garden.
With most U.S. precincts tallied,
the popular vote was 51.9 percent for
Obama and 46.8 percent for
McCain. But the count in the
Electoral College was lopsided in
Obama's favor over McCain—349
to 147 as of early Wednesday, with
three states still to be decided. Those
were North Carolina. Georgia and
Missouri.
Obama won California,
Colorado. Connecticut. Delaware,
the District of Columbia, Florida,
Hawaii. Illinois, Indiana, lowa,
Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan. Minnesota, Nevada, New
Hampshire, New Jersey, New
Mexico. New York, Ohio. Oregon.
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,
Virginia. Vermont. Washington and
Wisconsin.
McCain had Alabama, Arizona,
Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky.
Louisiana, Mississippi. Montana.
Nebraska, North Dakota,
Oklahoma. South Carolina. South
Dakota. Tennessee, Texas, Utah.
West Virginia and Wyoming. I le also

won at least 3 of Nebraska's five
electoral votes, with the other two in
doubt.
Almost six in 10 women support
ed Obama nationwide, while men
leaned his way by a narrow margin,
according to interviews with voters.
Just over half of whites supported
McCain, giving him a slim advantage
in a group that Bush carried over
