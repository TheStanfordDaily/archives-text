## Students in U.K. herald Obama win 
### ERIC MESSINGER SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In a historic election, even those Americans
across the Atlantic trained an eye toward
Tuesday's results.
On Election Night at the Stanford House in
Oxford — 3.000 miles from the U.S. and 5,400
miles from the Stanford campus — students con
gregated around television sets to learn the out
come of the 2008 presidential election. Many had
voted absentee and were anxious to learn the
results in their home states.
Stanford students in the U.K. quickly learned
that Americans were not the only ones interested
in the election results. Many Oxford colleges and
even clubs hosted events that were soon crowded
by waves of British attendees.
Two Stanford-associated colleges. Magdalen
and Corpus Christi. drew large crowds. Among

Oxford students, the enthusiasm of international
students toward the American political process
was clear.
"Normally, people would consider politicians to
be very similar," said classics student Thomas
Corcoran, who organized an election viewing party
for Corpus Christi College. "This time, they acted
different, and it felt like it meant something."
Like many of their American counterparts,
British students favored Democratic nominee
Sen. Barack Obama (D-III.). Numerous students
sported Obama T-shirts, while McCain supporters
stayed under the radar.
"The first time 1 noticed Obama was in 2005.
in a You Tube clip of the 2004 keynote," said John
Beresford. an Oxford law student. "A phenome
non was the only proper way to describe the gen
tleman."
When the returns favoring Obama came in.
Stanford students at the Oxford house were over

joyed.
"I'm excited to see the kind of enthusiasm and
support I see because of Barack Obama," said
Francesca Mazzola '10.
"Barack Obama has just overcome barriers for
people of all differences," added Ansaf Kareem
'10. "He has. like never before, given hope to peo
ple who had never before had hope within them."
By being in the United Kingdom, students at
the Stanford House noted an increased aware
ness of their place within the international com
munity. and the impressions they imparted while
abroad.
"You realize, when people hear your voice,
that they immediately judge you." said Matthew
Lucky '10. "Sometimes, you're emblematic, not
because of who you are, but because you are
American."

last-minute effort to swing the state to Senator Barack Obama. The Illinois
senator won Nevada on Tuesday, picking up five Electoral College votes.
