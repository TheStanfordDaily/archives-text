# Student volunteers descend on Nevada
## Stanford sends 130; Biden says thanks 
### KAMIL DADA DESK EDITOR 
LAS VEGAS —Calls of "OBAA
MAAA" could be heard resonating
throughout the nigtt in many Las
Vegas suburbs on Election Day, as a
veritable army of volunteers, includ
ing 130 Stanford students, cam
paigned for the Democratic candi
date.
Students spoke of how. when uni
fied in support of Obama. they felt
that they could really make a differ
ence— and the presidential ticket
they helped to elect agreed.
"Thanks to young voters, this
election has been a success," said
Vice President-elect Joe Biden in a
phone interview with The Daily.
Biden spoke about the role of
young adults in the 2008 election
season at 8:17 p.m. PST last night,
just 17 minutes after the major news
networks called the election in
Obama's favor.
But despite being coronated by
the media minutes before the inter
view, Biden was cautious to declare
victory.
"I am confident, but will not com
ment on the outcome yet," he said.
"We need to wait until all the results
are in."
Most of all, Biden lauded the
efforts of the volunteers.
"Obama's troops out on the field
have had a tremendous impact upon
this election," he said.
Some 70 out of Stanford's 130
"troops" headed to Las Vegas, while
the rest went to Reno. 'ITiey drove
for up to 12 hours to reach Nevada
on Saturday morning, and often
woke up at 4 a.m. to begin cam
paign-related work. By 6:30 a.m..
they started to put out door hangers
that reminded people to vote. By 9
a.m., they were knocking on doors,
reminding people of their voting
rights and the importance of voting.
Sam Kaspick '10. who coordinat
ed the canvassing activities of the
majority of Stanford students in Las
Vegas, explained the importance of
campaigning in Nevada.
"Nevada is the closest swing state
to campus," he said. "It is also a lot
of fun to be in a place where the race
is so close, and you can really feel
that you're going to make a differ
ence in the state."
Kaspick also pointed out that he
would be campaigning regardless of
who the candidate was.
"I'm a Democrat and believe in
Democratic values," he said. "So
even if it was Clinton, I would still
be out here helping, no matter what.
But Obama [is] special. I guarantee
that if it was one of the other candi
dates. the volunteer group wouldn't
be as big. He inspired us."
Others students drew inspiration
directly from Obama.
"If Clinton were the candidate, I
would not be here," said Michael
Albada '11. "1 am here because 1
believe in Obama. 1 think he is a
political messiah. He is the man our
generation needs."
While there were many Obama
supporters on the streets, there was
a notable lack of Republicans can
vassing in Las Vegas. Students
reported they had come across very
few Republican campaigners over
the four days that they were in Las
Vegas.
The president of the Stanford
College Republicans, Irina
Oberman '09, said she was not aware
of any Stanford Republicans visiting
L.as Vegas to campaign.
Campaign experiences
Despite the end result, students
reported mixed feelings with cam
paigning on the trip. While there
were many overwhelmingly positive
experiences, the campaigners did
also run into several roadblocks.
Students found the positive spirit

of Obama supporters contagious,
and bathed in the tide of support for
their candidate.
"There [is] something in the air
that's really different this year than
anything I have felt," Kaspick said.
There were also a number of
cases in which the students felt they
made a big difference individually.
"People are generally happy to
see you." said Chris Anelli *09. "This
one guy was unbelievable. When we
started talking about what this cam
paign meant, he invited us in and
offered us chicken, onions and pota
toes on his barbeque. We ate and
talked about how politics connected
people to each other."
Albada agreed and referred to
the case of a 79-year-old female
Democrat who had a long record of
voting for the Democratic Party.
"She told us that she wasn't vot
ing because she couldn't make it to
the polling station because her hus
band had died and she couldn't
drive," Albada said. "We were
shocked and arranged a ride for her.
There is such good infrastructure
present [in the campaign], that we
wrote it on our sheet, and then
someone picked her up and took her
to the voting station later."
But not all of the students' cam
paigning was well-received by
Nevada voters.
"People are generally frustrated
with us." Albada said. "Especially
the number of times we come back
day after day with fliers, door hang
ers and other [campaign materials].
Some people threatened us by say
ing that they were no longer going

to vote or that they would vote for
McCain because they were annoyed
with the campaigners. However,
those people are so few and so far
between that is it worth it to get the
information out."
He added that students also had
to deal with abusive language and
insults from the public.
"Several people cursed at us,"
Albada said. "After the rally (with
Michelle Obama on Monday], we
were out dancing in the street and
throwing fliers around when some
people drove past us screaming. I'm
never voting for a black guy!' and
shouted [profanities at J us."
Students also faced the issue of
gated compounds and had to resort
to guerilla tactics to spread their
message.
"Some of the addresses we
receive from the campaign are in
gated communities," Kaspick said.
"'lTiey give us the addresses anyway
and we have to figure out a way how
to get in there. We sometimes have
to climb over walls or fences."
Many commented on the tight
knit cohesion that quickly devel
oped between students.
"Just walking around and meet
ing a lot of new people has been
really exciting." said Nicholas
Rosellini *12. "Before this trip. I did
n't know that many other Stanford
Democrats, and now I know many."
Students also reported meeting
their peers from UC-Berkeley while
out campaigning and pointed out
that they put their usual rivalry
aside for the sake of the campaign.
"This is one of the few times
we're friendly with them." Kaspick
said. "We jest at each other now and
then, but we're pretty friendly. We
are all here for the same reason."
Strong support
Ashwin Mudaliar "09. president
of the Stanford Democrats,
remarked on how there was an

young voters,
this election has

incredible number of students will
ing to volunteer in the days leading
up to the election.
"I receive emails every day from
people asking how to get involved."
Mudaliar said. "Sending so many
students to Nevada has been the
capstone of all our efforts this year.
People read about the election and
make phone calls, but really there is
nothing more satisfying that actual
ly getting in the field."
Sarahi Constantine '11. president
of the Students for Barack Obama
Stanford Chapter, noted that not all
students who wanted to go to cam
paign were able to make the trip.
"I have heard of a lot of people
who weren't able to go," she said.
"Some students needed to leave
earlier because of midterms. Other
students have to miss their
midterms altogether. In classes that
drop the lowest midterm grade, I
know many students who have
opted to take the zero."
In fact, many students were con
cerned that spending time canvass
ing would have academic conse
quences.
"I felt like this was a once in a
lifetime chance and something that
was very important to me." Kaspick
said. "School became a second pri
ority. My GPA will probably drop
after this quarter, but hopefully I
can make up for it in the quarters to
come."

Voter fraud monitoring
While Stanford students primari
ly went door-to-door campaigning
in Las Vegas, Constantine said that
some Stanford Law students were
helping monitor the election sta
tions for fraud in Reno.
"They have [a] legal background
and so participate in voter protec
tion in the campaign," she said. "If
there are any issues with voting and
someone feels that the process is not
running smoothly, then they can
take action immediately."
Perry Rosenstein. '07. new media
director for the Obama campaign in
Nevada explained that people could
also utilize the Internet to report
voter fraud.
"I would check periodically if
there were any complaints reported
on the Web site and then forwarded
them on to the voter protection
team." he said. "There weren't a lot
of problems at all."
Reactions
Once the election results started
streaming in on national television
stations, many students began to
celebrate right away. Andrea
Romero "09 was reduced to tears
upon hearing that Obama was pro
jected to win in Virginia.
"I am elated." she said. "This is
the proudest day of my human life.
I feel so proud of our nation. I am
floored by democracy."
Bethany Woolman '09 added
that the American Dream was still
alive.
"It really goes to show that any
one can accomplish anything in this
country." she said. "This is the best
thing that has happened to our coun
try. Racially, this is the biggest
advance that has happened in histo
ry"
But Vice President-elect Biden
wasn't celebrating yet. Instead, he
insisted that young people continue
their activism.
"I don't want young voters to be
complacent, however." Biden said
to Hie Daily. 'They need to keep
on fighting for positive change."
