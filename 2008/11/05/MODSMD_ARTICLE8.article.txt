# Student volunteers descend on Nevada
## Stanford sends 130; Biden says thanks 
### KAMIL DADA DESK EDITOR 
LAS VEGAS —Calls of "OBAA
MAAA" could be heard resonating
throughout the nigtt in many Las
Vegas suburbs on Election Day, as a
veritable army of volunteers, includ
ing 130 Stanford students, cam
paigned for the Democratic candi
date.
Students spoke of how. when uni
fied in support of Obama. they felt
that they could really make a differ
ence— and the presidential ticket
they helped to elect agreed.
"Thanks to young voters, this
election has been a success," said
Vice President-elect Joe Biden in a
phone interview with The Daily.
Biden spoke about the role of
young adults in the 2008 election
season at 8:17 p.m. PST last night,
just 17 minutes after the major news
networks called the election in
Obama's favor.
But despite being coronated by
the media minutes before the inter
view, Biden was cautious to declare
victory.
"I am confident, but will not com
ment on the outcome yet," he said.
"We need to wait until all the results
are in."
Most of all, Biden lauded the
efforts of the volunteers.
"Obama's troops out on the field
have had a tremendous impact upon
this election," he said.
Some 70 out of Stanford's 130
"troops" headed to Las Vegas, while
the rest went to Reno. 'ITiey drove
for up to 12 hours to reach Nevada
on Saturday morning, and often
woke up at 4 a.m. to begin cam
paign-related work. By 6:30 a.m..
they started to put out door hangers
that reminded people to vote. By 9
a.m., they were knocking on doors,
reminding people of their voting
rights and the importance of voting.
Sam Kaspick '10. who coordinat
ed the canvassing activities of the
majority of Stanford students in Las
Vegas, explained the importance of
campaigning in Nevada.
"Nevada is the closest swing state
to campus," he said. "It is also a lot
of fun to be in a place where the race
is so close, and you can really feel
that you're going to make a differ
ence in the state."
Kaspick also pointed out that he
would be campaigning regardless of
who the candidate was.
"I'm a Democrat and believe in
Democratic values," he said. "So
even if it was Clinton, I would still
be out here helping, no matter what.
But Obama [is] special. I guarantee
that if it was one of the other candi
dates. the volunteer group wouldn't
be as big. He inspired us."
Others students drew inspiration
directly from Obama.
"If Clinton were the candidate, I
would not be here," said Michael
Albada '11. "1 am here because 1
believe in Obama. 1 think he is a
political messiah. He is the man our
generation needs."
While there were many Obama
supporters on the streets, there was
a notable lack of Republicans can
vassing in Las Vegas. Students
reported they had come across very
few Republican campaigners over
the four days that they were in Las
Vegas.
The president of the Stanford
College Republicans, Irina
Oberman '09, said she was not aware
of any Stanford Republicans visiting
L.as Vegas to campaign.
Campaign experiences
Despite the end result, students
reported mixed feelings with cam
paigning on the trip. While there
were many overwhelmingly positive
experiences, the campaigners did
also run into several roadblocks.
Students found the positive spirit

of Obama supporters contagious,
and bathed in the tide of support for
their candidate.
"There [is] something in the air
that's really different this year than
anything I have felt," Kaspick said.
There were also a number of
cases in which the students felt they
made a big difference individually.
"People are generally happy to
see you." said Chris Anelli *09. "This
one guy was unbelievable. When we
started talking about what this cam
paign meant, he invited us in and
offered us chicken, onions and pota
toes on his barbeque. We ate and
talked about how politics connected
people to each other."
Albada agreed and referred to
the case of a 79-year-old female
Democrat who had a long record of
voting for the Democratic Party.
"She told us that she wasn't vot
ing because she couldn't make it to
the polling station because her hus
band had died and she couldn't
drive," Albada said. "We were
shocked and arranged a ride for her.
There is such good infrastructure
present [in the campaign], that we
wrote it on our sheet, and then
someone picked her up and took her
to the voting station later."
But not all of the students' cam
paigning was well-received by
Nevada voters.
"People are generally frustrated
with us." Albada said. "Especially
the number of times we come back
day after day with fliers, door hang
ers and other [campaign materials].
Some people threatened us by say
ing that they were no longer going
