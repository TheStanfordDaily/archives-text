## Editorial Continue your activism past Election Day 
### 
The ballots have been cast in unprece
dented amounts. The votes have been
tallied, and a new president has been
elected to lead this nation for the next lour
years. Senators have been ousted, new gov
ernors have emerged and a wide array of
states, including California,have weighed on
a variety of consequential ballot initiatives
that will be discussed for years to come. On
the whole, this election has been momentous
in terms of time, dollars and significance.
Stanford University can look with pride
and satisfaction on its contributions to this
tremendous election season.The campaigns
of Hillary Clinton. Barack Obama and John
McCain included among its advisors a num
ber of distinguished Stanford faculty.
Droves of students volunteered for cam
paigns, making phone calls, canvassing
neighborhoods, hosting on campus debates
and traveling to battleground states to regis
ter voters and rally support. Of particular
note, the opponents of California Proposi
tion 8, the measure that sought to overturn
gay marriage in the Golden State, whipped
the campus into a frenzy with their purple T
shirts and phonebank operation, which was
largest in the state and held in spite of the
driving rain last Saturday.
Regardless of who you donated money
to, what cause you rallied around or what
candidate you fervently supported, the edi
torial board lauds the tireless efforts of all
Stanford students who were impassioned
enough to vigorously participate in this un
precedented exercise of American democ
racy. You defied the notion that Stanford is a
politically apathetic campus.
We are now left with a great dilemma:
how to effectively engage Stanford students,
and the rest of the country, now that the elec
tion is over. It is incumbent upon this univer

sity to reflect on how this recent surge of
campus activism can be effectively translat
ed into something more than a quadrennial
phenomenon.
Both the McCain and Obama campaigns
have inspired a generation of new voters,
both on the campus and across the nation.
Huge swaths of Americans, heretofore apa
thetic towards elections, have been incorpo
rated into the body politic.
Particularly when our country faces un
precedented challenges both at home and
abroad, one of the most basic responsibilities
we have is to stay informed and abreast of
the continual developments that will shape
and define our next president's term in of
fice. Keeping our elected leaders responsible
to us, their constituents, will be vital in ensur
ing that the United States climbs out of the
Bush administration's ruins.
The Constitution enshrines both the
rights of political majorities and minorities,
and especially if your candidate did not fare
as well as hoped, petition the government,
stage rallies for certain causes or work to ed
ucate your peers about an issue. In the past
week, we have seen a large spike in the num
ber of op-ed submissions to The Daily from
both sides of the aisle. The election is over,
but the troubles facing our society are no
less real, and we hope that students continue
to discuss how to solve them.
We leave it up to the student leaders who
led these political movements to keep advo
cating for their causes. We hope that those
students not involved are now inspired by
their peers, who looked beyond their own
success and thought about the success of our
nation and our world. Just because Nov. 4 is
now a memory, albeit a recent and extraor
dinarily emotional one, that does not mean
our fight is finished.
