# This Stanford Life
## Politics move from White Plaza to the Quad 
### 
Late on Election Night, in the hours fol
lowing President-elect Barack
Ohama's acceptance speech, students
gathered in the Main Quad — and not
White Plaza — to celebrate. This location
was no accident.
The Quad is a space traditionally saved
for important public celebration and not
fleeting concerns.Take, for instance, the bon
fire that materialized after Stanford's upset
of USC over a year ago. When students hope
to unite and celebrate, they head to the Main
Quad.
In contrast, student political activity at
Stanford traditionally takes place in White
Plaza. Protests and marches — partisan oc
casions, designed to persuade, protest and
antagonize — often materialize in White
Plaza. Last year, a protest of the war in Iraq
took place near the Bookstore. In 2006,
thousands of students gathered in White
Plaza to protest President George W. Bush's
visit on campus. In 1995, Jesse Jackson fa
mously rallied students for affirmative ac
tion from a platform near the Birdcage.
White Plaza rallies, in a sense, represent
Stanford's activist past. It is a place for the
campus's many factions to make their voices

heard for any and every agenda. The Plaza
has nurtured political divisions for decades,
divisions born out of the tumult of the 19605,
sharpened in (he 1980s and early 19905, and
half-heartedly continued into the 2000s.
But, just as Obama's victory largely rep
resents a break from the baggage of 20th
century politics, the Tuesday night rally rep
resented a break from the campus's political
past.
After Obama's victory on Tuesday night,
students walked right past White Plaza and
into the Main Quad.
Students did this because the celebration
was, on its deepest level, not partisan. The
gathering, inspired, of course, by Obama,
took on another level of significance: It was
a celebration of a renewed faith in American
values. Unlike the political rallies of the past,
Tuesday night was not an anti-establishment
rally but a pro-establishment rally.

lake, for instance, what students sang at
the rally. Students didn't sing Bob Dylan
protest songs, "We Shall Overcome," or in
cite angry chants, but sang "The Star-Span
gled Banner." An earnest rendition of our
national anthem is not something typically
associated with student protests. But this
was different.
And later, when the fire truck came to ex
tinguish the bonfire, students didn't hurl in
sults at "the man" or try to block the truck's
path. (Like they did at the anti-Bush rally in
2006, when students were arrested for block
ing a fire engine on Serra St.) Instead, the
students broke out into applause.
Students spoke not just of Obama, but of
America as whole. The win represented
something far deeper than a political victory;
it seemed to represent far more than normal
partisan politics. For students in the Main
Quad on Nov. 4. Obama's victory represent
ed the greatness of our nation in general.
ITiis is why students felt it appropriate to
celebrate in the Quad, not White Plaza.They
were not celebrating a man or cause or point
of view, but our nation itself.
