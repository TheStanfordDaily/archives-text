I am writing to clarify one of the purpos
es of the Proposition K protest that confused
many Stanford students trying to bypass the
human blockade on Wednesday. [See
"TITLE" in today's issue of The Daily.]
As I sat with other aggrieved citizens
blocking bike passage near the School of Ed
ucation and Building 260. I noticed a high
degree of frustration among people that
couldn't navigate through the blockade.
'ITiey were angry and felt that this blockade
was frivolous, unnecessary and unfair.
I want to explain that the blockade was
not frivolous. It was meant to make people
feel discomfort (for even a short time). It was
meant to make people reflect on the discom
fort they feel over a trivial matter like at
tending class on time and imagine the incon

veniences. indignities and discomforts that
some U.S. citizens face because they are
blockaded from exercising fundamental
human rights and are denied equality under
the law.
Some students, attempting to get
through, reasoned with me saying, "I voted
against Proposition 8."To them, I say thank
you. But, the point of the protest was to
make it clear that voting wasn't enough this
time. Now, it is our duty as a society to dis
rupt the status quo, again and again, to en
dure discomfort again and again, until civil
rights are granted to everyone regardless of
their sexual orientation.
