## Breast milk molecule found CCR 10 supplies antibodies to mothers' breast milk 
### NIKHIL KAMAT STAFF WRITER 
A molecule called CCRIO is critical to the
mobilization of certain cells involved in sup
plying antibodies to breast milk, according to
a collaborative study by researchers at
Stanford, Harvard and Brigham Young
University.
The molecule's role in breast milk antibody
production was detailed in the Nov. I issue of
the Journal of Immunology. According to the
article's results, mice genetically engineered
to not have the molecule had over a 70-fold
decrease in the secretion of the antibody IgA,
the main antibody in breast milk.
Professor of Pathology and study co-author
Eugene Butcher said that the results were
important in understanding the transfer of
maternal antibodies, which provide immunity
to breastfeeding infants. He said that the
study sheds light on the poorly understood
class of molecules called chemokines, which
are involved in the mobilization of immune
cells to different parts of the body.
"In many cases, the trafficking molecules
white blood cells use to get out of the blood

stream into other parts of the hotly are redun
dant," Butcher said, "but in this case, the mol
ecule was this one molecule that was (particu
larly] important in that one site."
Butcher said that while the molecule has
not been studied in humans, there is a very
high likelihood that humans have a similar
molecule that is involved in mobilizing anti
body-producing cells to the breast.
The study, which also focused on the role of
the molecule in mobilizing immune cells to
other parts of the body where IgA is impor
tant. found that other parts of the body do not
require CCRIO for successful immune func
tion. Butcher said that the singular impor
tance of the molecule in breast milk may have
important implications in humans, where
mutations might have an impact on the
immunological properties of breast milk.
Butcher emphasized the importance of the
collaborative nature of the project. He said
that the researchers at Harvard developed the
mouse deficient in the CCRIO molecule, while
researchers at Brigham Young were involved in
analyzing the immunity of breast milk.
Butcher was also impressed by the methods
employed by the other authors involved â€” in
particular the isolation of mouse breast milk.
"I thought it was kind of amazing that it could
be done," Butcher said.
