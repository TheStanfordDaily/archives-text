WASHINGTON â€” While
President-elect Barack Obama
enjoyed a few days with his family
after a hard-fought election, specu
lation swirled in the nation's capital
around potential administration
appointees.
Obama pivoted quickly to begin
filling out his team on Wednesday,
selecting hard-charging Illinois
Rep. Rahm Emanuel as White
House chief of staff while aides
stepped up the pace of transition
work that had been cloaked in pre
election secrecy.
Several Democrats confirmed
that Emanuel had been offered the
job. While it was not clear he had
accepted, a rejection would amount
to an unlikely public snub of the
new president-elect within hours of
an electoral college landslide.
Obama he has promised to hold
a news conference later in the week.
As president-elect, he begins receiv
ing highly classified briefings from
top intelligence officials Thursday.
In offering the post of White
House chief of staff to Emanuel.
Obama turned to a fellow Chicago
politician with a far different style
from his own. a man known for his
bluntness as well as his single-mind
ed determination.

Emanuel was a political and pol
icy aide in Bill Clinton's White
House. Leaving that, he turned to
investment banking, then won a
Chicago-area House seat six years
ago. In Congress, he moved quickly
into the leadership. As chairman of
the Democratic campaign commit
tee in 2006, he played an instrumen
tal role in restoring his party to
power after 12 years in the minority.
Emanuel maintained neutrality

during the long primary battle
between Obama and Sen. Hillary
Rodham Clinton, not surprising
given his long-standing ties to the
former first lady and his Illinois
connections with Obama.
The day after the election there
already was jockeying for Cabinet
appointments.
Several Democrats said Sen.
John Kerry of Massachusetts, who
won a new six-year term on
Tuesday, was angling for secretary
of state. They spoke on condition of
anonymity, saying they were not
authorized to discuss any private
conversations.
Kerry's spokeswoman, Brigid
O'Rourke, disputed the reports.
"It's not true. It's ridiculous." she
said.
Announcement of the transition
team came in a written statement
from the Obama camp.
The group is headed by John
Podesta, who served as chief of staff
under former President Clinton:
Pete Rouse, who has been Obama's
chief of staff in the Senate; and
Valerie Jarrett, a friend of the presi
dent-elect and campaign adviser.
Several Democrats described a
sprawling operation well under way.
Officials had kept deliberations
under wraps to avoid the appear
ance of overconfidence in the weeks
leading to Tuesday's election.
