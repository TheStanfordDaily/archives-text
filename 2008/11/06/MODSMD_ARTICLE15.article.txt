DAVIDSON \JBLT
1 1/6 Farmville, Va

GAME NOTES: The Stanford field hockey team
begins play today in the NorPcic Tourna
ment. The Cardinal is the No. 2 seed in the
tournament and will take on Davidson in the
first round today. Stanford is coming off a
thrilling overtime victory over then-No. 16
Cal on Saturday in the rain. The Cardinal is
the defending champion of the tournament,
winning it last year when it was held here at
Stanford.

A last-minute surge is exactly what the Cardi
nal needs as it enters the Northern Pacific Tourna
ment this weekend in Farmville. Va. After starting
the season on a rough note, dropping several
matches in overtime and accumulating one-goal
losses, Stanford's chances of repeating last year's

fantastic finish — earning a NorPac Tournament
Championship and an NCAA Tournament berth
— looked dismal.
Yet those early losses failed to drive the passion
out of the Cardinal women, who rebounded from
their less-than-encouraging beginning to the 2008
campaign and eventually upset No. 16 California in
overtime on Saturday. With the win. Stanford gave
Cal its only loss in conference play and secured the

second seed going into this year's NorPac Tourna
ment.
Stanford is currently 6-10, a poor finish com
pared to last season's 13-8 mark, one of the best
seasons in school history. But the numbers are
somewhat deceiving, as they do not give any cred
it to the fact that the first few teams the Cardinal
took on were non-conference foes among the na
tion's top-25 teams.
"We had a challenging first half of our season,
although I think our record doesn't fully reflect
how we played," junior Midori Uehara said.
Indeed, Stanford faced four top-20 teams in its
first six matches to start the season. The Cardinal
dropped all four of those games, with three coming
as one-goal losses. Additionally, almost half of
Stanford's games this season have been extended
into overtime,giving the squad experience that will
surely prove beneficial in the upcoming tourna
ment.
Hie Cardinal has proven to be versatile and ca
pable— and is definitely not lacking in talent. A
strong core of players, made up of both underclass
men and upperclassmen. has helped lead and in
spire the team all season and is highlighted by red
shirt freshman goalkeeper Alessandra Moss, fresh
man forward Stephanie Byrne, sophomores Xan
the Travlos and Camille Gandhi, junior forward
Midori Uehara and senior Bailey Richardson.
A large contributor to Stanford's success last
season was senior goalkeeper Madison Bell, who
only allowed two goals in tournament play. Moss
came into the season as a rookie and had big shoes
to fill. But she truly stepped up to her role and has
become a top performer in the cage, playing like a
veteran. She has made 80 saves and has established
herself as one of the top goalkeepers in the confer
ence. earning NorPac Player of the Week honors
three different times this season.
Uehara has emerged as one of the most danger
ous offensive threats in the conference,leading the
team with nine total goals, including two game
winners. Byrne has also made a major contribution
to the team with six goals on the year.Travlos and
Gandhi have also chipped in. with Travlos at four
goals and four assists and Gandhi at eight assists
and a team-best 41 shots.
But perhaps the most important component to
success in this weekend's tournament will be expe
rience, something Stanford has in spades after last
year's run. The Cardinal has advanced to the con
ference tournament title match in each of the last

two seasons, which means that a ma
jority of the team has experienced the
pressure and thrill of playing for the
highest stakes.
"The recent wins have really
boosted our confidence heading into
the tournament this week," Richard
son said. "With all the talent we have,
the only missing link this year was
confidence. And with everything
coming together now, we are all quite
optimistic about repeating as NorPac

champions and heading to the
NCAA Tournament for the second
straight year."
Cal has the edge and the upper
hand in the tournament as the No. 1
seed, but Stanford has the determina

before. Playing with momentum and
newly renewed confidence, the Stan
ford women are ready to make their
mark at the NorPac Tournament.
They begin their quest to repeat as
conference champions against sev

opening round.
