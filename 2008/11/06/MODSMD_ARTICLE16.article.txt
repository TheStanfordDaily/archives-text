# Soccer in the final stretch
## Last homestand of the season for Card 
### WILL DOOLEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's soccer team
will play its final home games of the
year this weekend, marking the near
end of a long and disappointing sea
son. Tomorrow, the Cardinal plays
host to Washington before closing
out its home slate against Oregon
State on Sunday, when the team will
honor its seniors.
Despite a rare losing season for
the team, there is still much to fight
for. For the large senior class, this will
be its final opportunity to play before
a home crowd and finish the season
on a high note. Also, the team hopes
to gain momentum going forward
into its last game of the 2008 season,
the Nov. 15 match against Cal, which
always provides its own motivation
for winning: bragging rights over the
University's archrivals from across
the Bay.
Stanford's senior class is unusual
ly large, with 10 players playing in
what could be their final home game
in cardinal and white. The seniors
have been the core of the team all
year, providing much-needed leader
ship. The team's leading scorer is sen
ior former walk-on Tom Mont
gomery, and the anchor of the de
fense that has been stellar all year is
senior Ryan Imamura.
But this might not be the final run
for all of the players set to be hon
ored Sunday. Senior co-captains
Evan Morgan and T.J. Novak have
been awarded another year of
NCAA eligibility for next season,
based on injuries both suffered dur
ing the year that severely limited
their playing time. Morgan and
Novak have been out for the majori
ty of the season, and their return next
season would be a tremendous bene
fit to a Stanford team looking to re
tool its offense.
Novak is an excellent playmaker
with tremendous versatility, while
Morgan was the team's leading goal

GAME NOTES: The Stanford men's soccer
team will play its final home matches of the
season this weekend. Tomorrow it will take

play Oregon State. Sunday marks senior day
for the Card, where 10 seniors will be hon
ored before the game.
scorer in his last full campaign,
notching five goals in the 2006 sea
son; he was redshirted last season
due to injury.
Any additional offense at all
would substantially benefit the Car
dinal (3-10-2, 1-5-1 Pacific-10 Con
ference). having lost eight one-goal
games this season. Stanford head
coach Bret Simon is optimistic. He
appeared confident that next year's
recruits will be able to make a differ
ence on the attacking side of the ball.
"We have a number of guys with
national experience coming in,"
Simon said. "That's been the focus
since I've been here, getting top at
tacking players."
Stanford starts its homestand
looking to avenge a 1 -0 loss to Wash
ington (8-5-2,3-2-2 Pac-10) on Oct. 3.
The Cardinal would love to play
spoiler to the Huskies' dream of
sharing the Pac-10 title with UCLA,
which has already clinched at least a
share of the conference title based on
tie-breakers.
Sunday's match versus Oregon
State (5-8-3, 2-4-1 Pac-10) appears
on paper to be a favorable match-up
for Senior Day. The Beavers are cur
rently fifth in the Pac-10 standings,
only one spot above the Cardinal.

Freshman Alex Binnie and the Stanford men's soccer team will host Washington and Oregon State for their final
homestand of the season. On Sunday, the Cardinal will honor 10 seniors before their final home game.
The last time the two teams played,
Stanford was able to battle the
Beavers to a 1-1 tie. The Cardinal
holds a commanding 20-5-3 overall
series lead against the Beavers that
dates back to 19K8.
Stanford will need all the mo
mentum it can get when it travels to
Berkeley next week. The Cardinal
will be going up against a very good
Bears team that has the lowest goals

against average in the conference, a
daunting statistic in light of Stan
ford's season-long difficulties pro
ducing offensively.
Cal is also ranked as high as No.
11 nationally in the four big national
soccer rankings, despite only being
ranked third in the conference
standings.
Friday's game has a 7:30 p.m. start
and the Sunday kickoff is scheduled
for 12:30 p.m. Both games will be
played at Stanford's Laird Q. Cagan
stadium.
