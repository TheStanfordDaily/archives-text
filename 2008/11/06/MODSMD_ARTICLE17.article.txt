# Ice hockey team needs some love

### 
Change certainly is on its way —
and not just in the political
world. The MLB season is al
ready becoming a mere memory, and
many sports on campus are entering
the home stretch. Football is fighting
for a bowl berth, women's soccer is
charging towards the NCAA Tourna
ment arid women's volleyball is in the
final month of its regular season.
With all these teams and more
heading towards their respective post
seasons and both basketball teams
preparing to tip-off their regular sea
sons next week, there is plenty for Car
dinal fans to be excited about this time
of year.
But there is another Cardinal team
that is quietly having one of the most
successful seasons of any on campus.
With a 7-2 record, the Stanford club ice
hockey squad is off to one of its best
starts ever.
Its season — which spans six
months, one of the longest runs of
competition of any Stanford sport —
began at the start of fall quarter and
hasn't yet reached the midway point.
Between the loss to San Jose State last
weekend and a season-opening loss to
Sacramento State, the Cardinal has
won seven straight, outscoring its op
ponents 47-25.
Certainly, this sort of success is wor
thy of commanding some interest in
the student body and attracting fans to
the games, which are typically played
on Friday and Saturday evenings at the
Redwood City Ice Oasis.
But, as we see at most Cardinal
sporting events. Stanford students are
far too busy to turn out in force for
every match,no matter how much they
love their teams. And who can blame
them with so many great teams to fol
low? It would be expected,then, that a
club team playing off campus would
have a hard time drawing many fans.
For years this was the case for the
ice hockey team, with the notable ex
ception of the annual "Big Freeze" se
ries against Cal. But students are al
ready taking notice of the team's great
improvement this season and atten
dance is growing. And. for those stu
dents who didn't know or were only
vaguely aware that Stanford even had
an ice hockey team, this squad is doing
plenty to earn your interest.
As a club team, the squad is able to
represent the full Stanford student
community by having both undergrad
uate and graduate students on its ros
ter. Ihis allows for an age spread of
eight or more years between the
youngest and oldest players. And it is
one of the older players who joined the
squad this season that helped boost the
team to its current success.
Joe Ulerich, a graduate student
who formerly played club hockey at
Princeton, has combined with senior
captain Max Guise to contribute the
bulk of the Cardinal's increased goal
scoring — the biggest reason for the
team's success this year. Behind these
forwards, the Cardinal has averaged
nearly six goals per game and has only
scored fewer than four twice in nine
games.
Combine this offensive firepower
with the fast pace, physical style of play
and intimate atmosphere inside the
Ice Oasis (where fans are at most a few
feet behind the glass), and you get one
of the most exciting fan experiences a
Stanford sport can offer. Considering
this, it's no wonder that fan interest is
beginning to increase.
If you haven't been able to get to a
game yet and would like to, don't
worry because there will be several
more opportunities to do so. With 16
games remaining and 12 home con
tests— including three huge games
against conlerence foe Washington
State tomorrow at 4:40 p.m., Saturday
at 6 p.m. and Monday at 4:40 p.m —
Stanford fans still have plenty of
chances to see the Cardinal take to the
ice.
Stanford is currently 3-0 within the
Pacific-8 Conference (Arizona and
Oregon State do not have programs),
and is seeking its first bid to the confer
ence tournament in years. Including
the WSI) games this weekend, the
team s next 10 contests are within the
conference.
Given the Cardinal's talent this
year and its hunger to reach the tour
nament, every remaining game should
be hard-fought and exciting for the
fans. TTiis team deserves to set noticed
