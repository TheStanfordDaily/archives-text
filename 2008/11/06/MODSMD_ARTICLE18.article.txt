## Politics, taxes, baseball 
### RONALD BLUM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Looking ahead to an Obama ad
ministration, some baseball agents
already are thinking about trying to
beat a possible tax increase for their
well-paid clients.
President-elect Barack Obama
has proposed increasing the top fed
eral income tax rate from 35 percent
to 39.6 percent, where it was under
the Clinton administration. If signing
bonuses are paid before Jan. 1, they
likely would be taxed at the current
rate and would not be subject to any
tax increase.
"It's something we'll consider,"
agent Craig Landis said Tuesday at
the general managers' meetings.
"Besides the federal issue, we have a
state issue in some cases, anyway,
where it's advantageous to take sign
ing bonuses because of the state in
come tax. A Florida resident can take
the signing bonus and not have to
pay his team's state tax."
Obama's proposal would increase
federal income tax on families earn
ing more than $25().()()0 annually,
money that would help finance a de
crease for workers and families earn
ing less than $200,000 annually.

Boras, negotiating eight- and possi
blv nine-figure deals for free agents

Manny Ramirez and Mark Teixeira,
already has thought about the possi
bility of asking for larger signing
bonuses payable this year in some of
his contracts.
"There's some consideration to
be had with the impact of the elec
tion," he said.
Free agents can't start negotiating
money with all teams until Nov. 14.
Only a relatively small percentage of
contracts are finalized before Jan. 1.
Still, for a big-money free agent
earning $10 million in 2009,Obama's
plan could increase his federal tax by
more than $4(X).000.
"I'm sure it will be kicked
around," said Paul Kinzer. who rep
resents free-agent closer Francisco
Rodriguez.
With the general election Tues
day, many of the GMs said they had
voted by absentee ballot. New York
Mets general manager Omar Minaya
said he could predict whether his
counterparts supported Democrats
or Republicans.
"I'm working out. I'm at the gym,
I'm looking around, everyone's
watching TV," he said. "And you can
tell: A guy would be on the Fox chan
nel, somebody would get off (the ma
chine), and the other guy would just
switch right to CNN. Or somebody
would be on CNN. and the other guy
would go like, OK. Tm not watching
this stuff.'"

Minaya, who worked for the
Texas Rangers when George W.
Bush was controlling owner, said
some of the GMs also turned to
MSNBC.
Agents generally had thought
about the possibility of a tax increase
more than the GMs. Many of the club
representatives said they likely
wouldn't be able to determine until
after Nov. 14 whether beating a tax
hike was a trend.
"It's not off the wall," said An
drew Friedman, executive vice presi
dent for baseball operations of the
AL. champion Tampa Bay Rays.
"We'd certainly be open-minded to it
depending on what the rest of the
terms of the deal are."
On the first full day of the meet
ings:

firms that have fallen, baseball com
missioner Bud Selig warned GMs in
a video conference about the nation
al economy, mentioning that Bear
Stearns. Lehman Brothers and Mer
rill Lynch have all collapsed or been
take over in the past year.
"We're living in a tumultuous eco
nomic period." Selig said later in a
telephone interview with The Asso
ciated Press. "Many economists be
lieve that we're going to have signifi
cant problems. Maybe this could turn
out to be the most difficult period
since the Great Depression."
