## Business prof. joins Moody's board Darrell Duffie now one of nine members of board of directors 
### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
On Oct. 29. Moody's Corporation, one of the
nation's major financial ratings firms determining the
credit-worthiness of borrowers, announced that
Stanford Graduate School of Business (GSB) Prof.
Darrell Duffie had been elected as a member of the
company's board of directors.

Duffie has also been
elected to the board's
audit committee and to
the governance and
compensation commit
tee. With the addition of
Duffie, Moody's board
now consists of nine
directors.
"It was a pretty easy
decision to accept to join
Moody's board of direc
tors." Duffie said. "Right
now is a very important
time for the credit mar
kets; credit ratings nlav

an important role in improving credit markets, and I
will learn a lot from the opportunity to serve on the
hoard of directors of Moody's."
I"he credit crisis was one of the first and earliest
facilitators of the current financial turmoil.
Early in October, Moody's CEO Raymond
McDaniel. along with chairmen of two other large
financial rating firms, testified before Congress
regarding the company's faulty ratings and risk
assessments on mortgage-backed securities.
Duffie expressed confidence that despite misrat
ings in the past. Moody's will continue to improve
both as a corporation and as a ratings agency.
"McDaniel has made a number of public state
ments about the fact that some of Moody's ratings
were not correct." Duffie said. "He's also described,
including in testimony, some measures that the firm is
taking to give future good ratings for structured cred
it products and other products that they rate."
One of those measures is Moody's $189 million
acquisition of Fermat International, a European firm
and lead provider of risk and performance manage
ment software to the global banking sector.
While Moody's Corporation is known primarily as
a financial ratings agency, it also contains other


PROF. DARRELL DUFFIE
branches with non-rating functions.
One such branch, called Moody's
Analytics, gathers data and informs
investors regarding the capital mar
kets.
"There is a wide range of
finance-related expertise involved
in that side of their business," Duffie
said. "Since I do work on credit mar
kets in my research, I'll be some
what relevant to both sides of their
business."
"But of course, the board has a
lot of responsibilities beyond rat
ings," Duffie added. "Our main job
is to provide corporate governance,
look out of the interest of share
holders. and provide advice to the
company."

In terms of compensation,
according to a filing released by
Moody's on Oct. 31, Duffie will be
paid an annual cash retainer of
$75,000 and an annual restricted
stock award issue with a grant date
fair value of $115,000.
Ultimately, however, Duffie is
first and foremost committed to
teaching finance at the Stanford
GSB. He said that he will not have
to miss any classes due to the added
responsibility of Moody's; he only
had to reschedule one class in order
to attend a meeting to initially join
the board of directors.
"My biggest commitment is to
teaching at Stanford," Duffie said.
"This opportunity to be involved
with Moody's will allow me to bring
new information into the classroom
and into mv own research."
