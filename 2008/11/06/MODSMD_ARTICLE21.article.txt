# Cardinal sends message to ITA Championships
## 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The 2008 Intercollegiate Tennis
Association National Intercolle
giate Indoor Championships begin
today at the University of Virginia in
Charlottesville, hut don't count on
the Stanford women's tennis team to
participate this year.
As storied of a history as any pro
gram in the nation, Stanford has
elected not to participate in this
year's Indoor Championships, effec
tively ending its fall season earlier
than expected.
Though Stanford has the talent to
qualify for the Championships, its
boycott of one of the toughest tour
naments of the season comes with a
strong message, according to head
coach Lele Forood.
"My opinion is that college tennis
has gone too ambitious in our off
season." Forood said. "We play too
much during this period of the year,
and we need to start modifying our
tennis schedule in the fall. We're
sending a message that we don't be
lieve this tournament should be in
existence anymore."
The Indoor Championships have
been a mainstay in collegiate tennis
since 1984 for the women's side. Ini
tially played in February, the In
doors were moved to the fall season
a few years ago, which adds to Stan
ford's recurring problems with the
fall season schedule. Stanford, which
starts school late due to the quarter
system, is as a result at a disadvan
tage entering major tournaments in
early October.
With five tournaments scheduled
for the sport's "off-season," Forood
questioned whether it is a healthy
decision to push her team when it
matters the least.
"I think it's time when we need
people in school more," Forood said.
"When you play Indoors, you leave
on a Tuesday morning and miss an
entire week of school to play a tour
nament. It's gotten a bit out of hand
considering we're in our off-season,
supposedly."
Last year, the Stanford women's
tennis team sent only one player,
then-junior Jessica Nguyen, to the
Championships. Sophomore Hilary

Barte and senior Jessica Nguyen
were expected to receive at-large
bids to this year's event, hut are not
entering. Sophomore Alex Clayton
of the men's tennis team will be the
only Stanford player at the tourna
ment.
"Two players had the potential to

play the Indoors: Hilary and Jessi
ca." Forood said. "I think they real
ized both were taking a lot of econ.
midterms this week, and they real
ized that there's not a lot of value to
playing in the last tournament of the
fall. It's a lot of time off school for. to
me. not a large reward."

As players juggle their academic
schedule and getting through au
tumn quarter, the demands of the
fall season have taken a definite toll.
With the academic rigor of the Stan
ford curriculum. Forood said that
the negatives of the tournament out
weigh any possible benefits.

"I have had some discussions
with coaches from other good aca
demic institutions during the Ail-
American Tournament about what
should take place during the fall."
Forood said. "A lot of these kids are
playing four or five events during
the fall, which is ridiculous when our

real season is during the winter and
spring. It really needs to get correct
ed, but it's hard to cut back on these
events that have been going for a
while."
Though the Indoors may give the
players a few extra matches and
some padding in the ITA rankings,
Forood believes there is little lost
from their absence.
"There's no obligation to play
them initially," she said." These tour
naments enhance the ranks of the
participants, but everything's shut
down in college tennis for the next
two months anyway. So, it's hard to
argue that these matches will do
anything for these player's games
except improve their ranking."
Another major issue of a rigorous
fall season is the funding behind
traveling to each tournament. With
the bad economy and lack of ITA
funding support. Stanford has ques
tioned whether these off-season
tournaments are worth their effort.
"A lot of expenses to fund the
players to these events used to get
paid by the ITA," Forood said. "Now
it's a money issue to go to all ol these
individual tournaments. We certain
ly have to look at what we must go to
before our dual-match season."
Finally, after a travel heavy 200K
campaign, the Stanford women are
less than eager to travel across the
country for a tournament that could
do more harm than help. Forood be
lieves that travel schedules must be
better coordinated in the future..
"I'd also like to see the confer
ence do a better job of scheduling us
because we go from one year where
we travel just about all the time to
i.his'year coming up where we hardly
travel at all," Forood said. "I think
there'd be a better balance to have a
little travel each year instead."
As a former Stanford player and
coach of 21 years. Forood has experi
enced everything to do with college
tennis. With the best interests of her
players in mind, she has sent out a
clear message to collegiate tennis:
Stanford's student-athletes are first
and foremost full-time students, not
frequent flyers.

some padding in the ITA rankings,
Forood believes there is little lost
from their absence.
"There's no obligation to play
them initially," she said." These tour
naments enhance the ranks of the
participants, but everything's shut
down in college tennis for the next
two months anyway. So, it's hard to
argue that these matches will do
anything for these player's games
except improve their ranking."
Another major issue of a rigorous
fall season is the funding behind
traveling to each tournament. With
the bad economy and lack of ITA
funding support. Stanford has ques
tioned whether these off-season
tournaments are worth their effort.
"A lot of expenses to fund the
players to these events used to get
paid by the ITA," Forood said. "Now
it's a money issue to go to all ol these
individual tournaments. We certain
ly have to look at what we must go to
before our dual-match season."
Finally, after a travel heavy 200K
campaign, the Stanford women are
less than eager to travel across the
country for a tournament that could
do more harm than help. Forood be
lieves that travel schedules must be
better coordinated in the future..
"I'd also like to see the confer
ence do a better job of scheduling us
because we go from one year where
we travel just about all the time to
i.his'year coming up where we hardly
travel at all," Forood said. "I think
there'd be a better balance to have a
little travel each year instead."
As a former Stanford player and
coach of 21 years. Forood has experi
enced everything to do with college
tennis. With the best interests of her
players in mind, she has sent out a
clear message to collegiate tennis:
Stanford's student-athletes are first
and foremost full-time students, not
frequent flyers.
