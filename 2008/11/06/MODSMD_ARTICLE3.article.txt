# Prop. 8 opponents rally
## Stanford students rally against California voters' passage of same-sex marriage ban 
### RYAN MAC STAFF WRITER 
Students on their way to class around 1 p.m. yesterday
found their route very congested at the intersection of
Lasuen Mall and Escondido due to a large student
protest against the recent passage of Proposition 8.
Marching from White Plaza, a group of over 100 stu
dents sat down at the "Intersection of Death," grinding
roundabout traffic to a halt from all directions. Despite
class or other obligations, many onlookers stopped to lis

ten to the protest.
With previous "No on 8" signs modified to now read
"I am a second-class citizen." protesters conveyed their
frustration with California voters who supported Prop. 8
— a voting bloc that Prop. 8 opponents feel marginalized
the rights of the LGBT community. Chanting phrases
such as "Drop your bike for civil rights" and "Stand up.
fight hack." demonstrators showed that the fight for
same-sex marriage rights is far from over.
Amanda Gelender '10. an organizer of the rally and
member of the unofficial Student Coalition for

Marriage Equality, spoke about the general sentiment
among supporters for LGBT rights after learning about
Prop. B's passage.
"It's just devastating," she said. "It's a mix of absolute
sadness and anger — anger at the more than 50 percent
majority of California who chose to make us second-class
citizens."
The sit-down protest was planned spontaneously, as
organizers, originally hopeful that Prop. 8 would not pass.


ISAAC GATENO/'The Stanford Daily
Students gathered at the "Intersection of Death" yesterday at 12:30 p.m. to rally against California's passage of Proposition 8. The rally was impromptu; Prop. 8 opponents
organized it overnight after voting results indicated that a small majority of Californians voted for the proposition.
were disappointed. On Election
Night, leaders of "No on 8" activism
and the L.GBT community who
watched the results come in soon pre
pared for the worst and began devel
oping a plan to voice their opinions.
Gelender described the train of
thought.
"We were hopeful with numbers
teetering around 47 percent as our
counties hadn't come in yet," she
explained. "But by midnight, we

asked ourselves, 'What if Prop. 8
passes?' From 12 [p.m.] to 2 [a.m.],
we sat in search of a plan. Some of us
never went to bed and organized
until around 5 [a.m.], sending out
emails and getting the message to
friends about what would be happen
ing today."
While the organizers of the rally
originally only had six volunteers
slated to speak, a variety of stu
dents and supporters of LGBT
rights took advantage of an open
megaphone to voice their opin
ions. Among those impromptu
speakers was Stanford Law School
graduate LaDoris Cordell '74, the
former municipal court judge of

Santa Clara County and current
special counsel to University
President John Hennessy.
Originally unaware that there
was going to be a rally, Cordell
passed the rally while walking back
from a meeting and spoke on the
megaphone to show her support for
what she saw was a very important
cause.
"My purpose was to give encour
agement and to let them know that
they are not alone," she told The
Daily.''lt's not right to remain silent.
This is about civil rights, and it's an
issue that's not going to go away. I
wanted to show that senior adminis
trators care about this issue."

In her talk. Cordell described
how her own personal history and
understanding of civil rights for
African Americans had deep con
nections to today's LGBT issues. She
explained the importance of bridg
ing the connections between the two
movements, past and present.
"Civil rights is something that
should concern everybody," she
said. "There is an absolutely clear
correlation [between today's move
ment] to race issues."
"I think it's sad that 70 percent of
African Americans voted to pass
Prop. 8," she added. "All groups had
a part in passing it: however, it's a
concern especially for African

Americans as [Prop. 8] has not
clearly registered in the African-
American community."
As for activism on campus, stu
dents have shown interest in continu
ing their support for LGBT rights
post-Prop. 8. There has not yet been
any action taken, however, in con
tacting government officials or larger
organization.
"Tonight at a 'thank you' meeting
for those who helped organize and
support our cause, we're going to
gauge interest and take contact infor
mation and see who wants to contin
ue the fight for queer rights." Jamie
Tam '10 said.
While she was unsure if this was

going to lead to the foundation of a
Volunteer Student Organization on
campus. Tarn remained optimistic for
future plans. ASSU President Jonny
Dorsey '()9 echoed this sentiment.
"1 think we saw at Stanford what
we will see more and more across
the nation: Not only are LGBT stu
dents infuriated by this, but straight
allies are joining in the cause in
great numbers, too." Dorsey said.
"While I am depressed by the
results, I am so happy our communi
ty has, and will continue to, come
together to fight for equality"

Americans as [Prop. 8] has not
clearly registered in the African-
American community."
As for activism on campus, stu
dents have shown interest in continu
ing their support for LGBT rights
post-Prop. 8. There has not yet been
any action taken, however, in con
tacting government officials or larger
organization.
"Tonight at a 'thank you' meeting
for those who helped organize and
support our cause, we're going to
gauge interest and take contact infor
mation and see who wants to contin
ue the fight for queer rights." Jamie
Tam '10 said.
While she was unsure if this was

going to lead to the foundation of a
Volunteer Student Organization on
campus. Tarn remained optimistic for
future plans. ASSU President Jonny
Dorsey '()9 echoed this sentiment.
"1 think we saw at Stanford what
we will see more and more across
the nation: Not only are LGBT stu
dents infuriated by this, but straight
allies are joining in the cause in
great numbers, too." Dorsey said.
"While I am depressed by the
results, I am so happy our communi
ty has, and will continue to, come
together to fight for equality"
