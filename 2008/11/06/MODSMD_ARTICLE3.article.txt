# Prop. 8 opponents rally
## Stanford students rally against California voters' passage of same-sex marriage ban 
### RYAN MAC STAFF WRITER 
Students on their way to class around 1 p.m. yesterday
found their route very congested at the intersection of
Lasuen Mall and Escondido due to a large student
protest against the recent passage of Proposition 8.
Marching from White Plaza, a group of over 100 stu
dents sat down at the "Intersection of Death," grinding
roundabout traffic to a halt from all directions. Despite
class or other obligations, many onlookers stopped to lis

ten to the protest.
With previous "No on 8" signs modified to now read
"I am a second-class citizen." protesters conveyed their
frustration with California voters who supported Prop. 8
— a voting bloc that Prop. 8 opponents feel marginalized
the rights of the LGBT community. Chanting phrases
such as "Drop your bike for civil rights" and "Stand up.
fight hack." demonstrators showed that the fight for
same-sex marriage rights is far from over.
Amanda Gelender '10. an organizer of the rally and
member of the unofficial Student Coalition for

Marriage Equality, spoke about the general sentiment
among supporters for LGBT rights after learning about
Prop. B's passage.
"It's just devastating," she said. "It's a mix of absolute
sadness and anger — anger at the more than 50 percent
majority of California who chose to make us second-class
citizens."
The sit-down protest was planned spontaneously, as
organizers, originally hopeful that Prop. 8 would not pass.

Students gathered at the "Intersection of Death" yesterday at 12:30 p.m. to rally against California's passage of Proposition 8. The rally was impromptu; Prop. 8 opponents
organized it overnight after voting results indicated that a small majority of Californians voted for the proposition.
