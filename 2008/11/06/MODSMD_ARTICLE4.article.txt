## Univ. sends post-docs to Bangladesh 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
In an effort to show continued support for
international educational development,
Stanford officials recently announced a new pro
gram aimed at aiding disadvantaged women
through education.
Through the new initiative, Stanford will send
two post-doctoral fellows to the Asian
University for Women (AUW) in Bangladesh to
teach the Stanford equivalent of two core intro
ductory courses with 25 students. The effort is
designed to provide its students a world-class,
high-quality education that will better enable
them to contribute to their communities.
"Stanford seeks to provide more educational
opportunities so students are prepared for
careers working side-by-side with peers from
around the world, including those from the
Asian University for Women," said Vice Provost
John Etchemendy.
Located in ( hittagong, Bangladesh, the
recently established AUW will be a leading insti
tution of higher learning for women across Asia.

AUW has the
explicit mission of
providing the educa
tional and training
opportunities neces
sary for leadership

development, economic
progress and social and
political equality in South
Asian communities.
In addition to its colle

giate program. AUW is also currently
offering eligible students the option of enrolling
in its Access Academy. The Access Academy
program is a year-long college preparation pro
gram that trains students in English language
studies, mathematics and computer skills. In
March 2(M)K. the Access Academy enrolled its
first 130 students, all of whom will be graduating
in time to join AUW's inaugural semester.
In an email to the Daily, Dean of the School
of Humanities and Sciences Richard Sailer said
that he hopes that the two Stanford University
post-doctoral fellows will have a profound
impact on the learning community at AIJW.

Sailer also empha
sized that the interaction
is mutually beneficial;
not only will the Stanford
post-doctoral fellows aid
in developing education
al programs for South
Asian women, they will
also gain valuable insight
to bring back to the
University.

"Stanford is dedicated to building a strong
program in South Asian Studies" he said. "And
this will be accomplished through research on
contemporary economics and politics, as well as
research on the region Is diverse cultures and
history."
