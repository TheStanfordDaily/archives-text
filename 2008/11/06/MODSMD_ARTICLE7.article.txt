## Cactus garden a campus treasure 
### EMILY RIALS STAFF WRITER 
It would be fairly easy to go
through four years on the Farm
and never realize that the Ari
zona Cactus Garden exists.
It's one of the University's best
kept secrets, tucked away deep in a
quiet corner of the Stanford Arbore
tum. From the outer edges of the gar
den, the Mausoleum is just visible
through the trees; the traffic around
the Stanford Shopping Center is just
barely audible.
News of the garden's presence seems
to spread slowly, via word-of-mouth. It
would be all too easy never to be aware
that the campus, dominated by palm
trees and fountains, is also home to a
haven for cacti and succulents.
"I see people out there all the time,"
said Christy Smith, the Arizona Gar
den Coordinator. "It used to be a lot
emptier."
The garden does have a checkered
past. Despite its understated pres
ence. it's actually older than the Uni
versity itself. In the 1880s, when Le
land and Jane Stanford decided they
wanted to build a house in the area
now known as the Arboretum, they
arranged for Rudolf Ulrich to design
one of the gardens.
After their beloved son's death in
1884. plans for the house were aban
doned.and the University was founded
instead. Ulrich's cactus garden had al
ready been created, and the garden has
remained on Stanford land ever since.
In the early days of the University,
Stanford students knew the garden as a
popular couples' destination. But the
garden fell into a state of neglect in the
middle of the last century, around
World War 11, and many of the original
plants, left untended. were lost.
In 1997, a volunteer-driven restora
tion effort was begun, and today the
garden is positively flourishing. About
a dozen of the original species planted
for the Stanfords remain in the garden;
other plants. Smith explained, have
been donated by volunteers, home
owners or local cactus and succulents
societies. On the third Saturday of
every month, a group of volunteers as
sembles to attend to the garden, weed
ing. dead-heading, maintaining the
rock borders around each bed and wa
tering the plants as needed.
Watering, of course, is di fferent for a
cactus garden.
"I water once every six weeks in the
summer," Smith said, adding that she
doesn't plan to water the garden at all
before May. at the earliest.
On Oct. 18. the California Preserva
tion Foundation presented its annual
Preservation Design Awards aboard
the Queen Mary. The exhaustive ef
forts of the Arizona Garden volunteers
were honored with an award in the re
construction category. Smith was one
of those present to accept the award.
The garden's isolated location, how
ever, and the fact that it has only re
cently begun to be restored, have taken
a toll on students' general awareness of
its presence. Some undergraduates

hear about the garden through classes
taken over the summer or stumble
upon it as a result of curiosity about the
area surrounding the Mausoleum. But
for the most part, the garden seems
better-known to runners and older
members of the Stanford community
than to the average undergrad.
"I think not too many people think
it's back here," said JingLucy Sun. a
graduate student in structural biology.
"I always get lost coming here, but
since I work right across the street [at
the Stanford Hospital]... 1 always
find it eventually."
Sun explained that the garden at
tracts more visitors during lunch hours,
particularly visitors from the nearby
hospital. Yet at the same time, she ex
plained. part of the garden's allure is
that in general, it's an area of peaceful
solitude.
"You can walk around for 20 min
utes and not run into too many peo
ple," she said.
The Cactus Garden is, according to
Smith, quadrilaterally symmetrical, en
compassing nearly 60 individual beds.
The layout is both incredibly formal
and consistently surprising â€” no two
beds are quite alike. For those accus
tomed only to the stoic saguaro cacti
usually depicted in Westerns, this gar
den offers a glimpse of the mind-bog
gling diversity of succulent plants.
Take the central bed. for example.
In the very center of the cactus garden
stands a massive fan palm tree, sur
rounded by dozens of silvery-grey suc
culents, thick-stalked with broad
leaves, which only reach about six inch
es in height. To one side, a prickly pear
cactus, whose broad green pads are
reminiscent of spined ping-pong pad
dles branching off of one another at
every angle.To the other side.a sprawl
ing cholla. which more closely resem
bles a bush than a stereotypical cactus,
its limbs green cylinders cascading and
twisting over one another. At the very
edges of the bed squats a border of
golden barrel cacti, green spherical
plants with regular columns of pliable
yellow spikes.
While the color scheme of the gar
den is overwhelmed by the abundance
of green hues, here and there one finds
flashes of brighter colors. A man eager
ly points out to his walking companion
the massive white flower buds on the
side of one cactus. Elsewhere,small red
and orange flowers peek out from a
maze of spikes.
For the most part, the garden sits
quietly and alone in the sunshine.
Squirrels and birds frolic among the
spiked leaves; tiny lizards sun them
selves on the rocks that separate the
beds from the sandy walkways. Every
now and then, a group of undergradu
ates runs or bikes past, sometimes
using the garden as an excuse to rest
for a moment before continuing on.
"That's a pretty bailer tree," one
young woman remarked as she and her
companion jogged through the gar
den's center.
The garden's twisting paths are also
frequented by dog-walkers, while the
few benches on the outskirts provide
safe harbor for those who would enjoy
their lunches awav from the hustle and

bustle of central campus.
"I just love wandering here," ex
plained Adrienne Mayor, a visiting
scholar studying classics and the histo
ry of science.
Mayor keeps her own garden in
Palo Alto and visits the garden several
times a year.
"[I goj to get ideas, to see how big
[the plants] are going to get," she said.
Mayor learned about the garden
from an acquaintance who was under
going chemotherapy at the hospital.

"She always came here to medi
tate." she said. When the acquaintance
mentioned the garden. Mayor sought it
out on a campus map.
"I just love how old it is," Mayor
added. "It just seemed like a secret gar
den. I always bring guests here."
The garden is located just off Quar
ry Road, between Arboretum Road
and Campus Drive.

utes and not run into too many peo
ple," she said.
The Cactus Garden is, according to
Smith, quadrilaterally symmetrical, en
compassing nearly 60 individual beds.
The layout is both incredibly formal
and consistently surprising â€” no two
beds are quite alike. For those accus
tomed only to the stoic saguaro cacti
usually depicted in Westerns, this gar
den offers a glimpse of the mind-bog
gling diversity of succulent plants.
Take the central bed. for example.
In the very center of the cactus garden
stands a massive fan palm tree, sur
rounded by dozens of silvery-grey suc
culents, thick-stalked with broad
leaves, which only reach about six inch
es in height. To one side, a prickly pear
cactus, whose broad green pads are
reminiscent of spined ping-pong pad
dles branching off of one another at
every angle.To the other side.a sprawl
ing cholla. which more closely resem
bles a bush than a stereotypical cactus,
its limbs green cylinders cascading and
twisting over one another. At the very
edges of the bed squats a border of
golden barrel cacti, green spherical
plants with regular columns of pliable
yellow spikes.
While the color scheme of the gar
den is overwhelmed by the abundance
of green hues, here and there one finds
flashes of brighter colors. A man eager
ly points out to his walking companion
the massive white flower buds on the
side of one cactus. Elsewhere,small red
and orange flowers peek out from a
maze of spikes.
For the most part, the garden sits
quietly and alone in the sunshine.
Squirrels and birds frolic among the
spiked leaves; tiny lizards sun them
selves on the rocks that separate the
beds from the sandy walkways. Every
now and then, a group of undergradu
ates runs or bikes past, sometimes
using the garden as an excuse to rest
for a moment before continuing on.
"That's a pretty bailer tree," one
young woman remarked as she and her
companion jogged through the gar
den's center.
The garden's twisting paths are also
frequented by dog-walkers, while the
few benches on the outskirts provide
safe harbor for those who would enjoy
their lunches awav from the hustle and

bustle of central campus.
"I just love wandering here," ex
plained Adrienne Mayor, a visiting
scholar studying classics and the histo
ry of science.
Mayor keeps her own garden in
Palo Alto and visits the garden several
times a year.
"[I goj to get ideas, to see how big
[the plants] are going to get," she said.
Mayor learned about the garden
from an acquaintance who was under
going chemotherapy at the hospital.

"She always came here to medi
tate." she said. When the acquaintance
mentioned the garden. Mayor sought it
out on a campus map.
"I just love how old it is," Mayor
added. "It just seemed like a secret gar
den. I always bring guests here."
The garden is located just off Quar
ry Road, between Arboretum Road
and Campus Drive.

It would be fairly easy to go
through four years on the Farm
and never realize that the Ari
zona Cactus Garden exists.
It's one of the University's best
kept secrets, tucked away deep in a
quiet corner of the Stanford Arbore
tum. From the outer edges of the gar
den, the Mausoleum is just visible
through the trees; the traffic around
the Stanford Shopping Center is just
barely audible.
News of the garden's presence seems
to spread slowly, via word-of-mouth. It
would be all too easy never to be aware
that the campus, dominated by palm
trees and fountains, is also home to a
haven for cacti and succulents.
"I see people out there all the time,"
said Christy Smith, the Arizona Gar
den Coordinator. "It used to be a lot
emptier."
The garden does have a checkered
past. Despite its understated pres
ence. it's actually older than the Uni
versity itself. In the 1880s, when Le
land and Jane Stanford decided they
wanted to build a house in the area
now known as the Arboretum, they
arranged for Rudolf Ulrich to design
one of the gardens.
After their beloved son's death in
1884. plans for the house were aban
doned.and the University was founded
instead. Ulrich's cactus garden had al
ready been created, and the garden has
remained on Stanford land ever since.
In the early days of the University,
Stanford students knew the garden as a
popular couples' destination. But the
garden fell into a state of neglect in the
middle of the last century, around
World War 11, and many of the original
plants, left untended. were lost.
In 1997, a volunteer-driven restora
tion effort was begun, and today the
garden is positively flourishing. About
a dozen of the original species planted
for the Stanfords remain in the garden;
other plants. Smith explained, have
been donated by volunteers, home
owners or local cactus and succulents
societies. On the third Saturday of
every month, a group of volunteers as
sembles to attend to the garden, weed
ing. dead-heading, maintaining the
rock borders around each bed and wa
tering the plants as needed.
Watering, of course, is di fferent for a
cactus garden.
"I water once every six weeks in the
summer," Smith said, adding that she
doesn't plan to water the garden at all
before May. at the earliest.
On Oct. 18. the California Preserva
tion Foundation presented its annual
Preservation Design Awards aboard
the Queen Mary. The exhaustive ef
forts of the Arizona Garden volunteers
were honored with an award in the re
construction category. Smith was one
of those present to accept the award.
The garden's isolated location, how
ever, and the fact that it has only re
cently begun to be restored, have taken
a toll on students' general awareness of
its presence. Some undergraduates

hear about the garden through classes
taken over the summer or stumble
upon it as a result of curiosity about the
area surrounding the Mausoleum. But
for the most part, the garden seems
better-known to runners and older
members of the Stanford community
than to the average undergrad.
"I think not too many people think
it's back here," said JingLucy Sun. a
graduate student in structural biology.
"I always get lost coming here, but
since I work right across the street [at
the Stanford Hospital]... 1 always
find it eventually."
Sun explained that the garden at
tracts more visitors during lunch hours,
particularly visitors from the nearby
hospital. Yet at the same time, she ex
plained. part of the garden's allure is
that in general, it's an area of peaceful
solitude.
"You can walk around for 20 min
utes and not run into too many peo
ple," she said.
