## Editorial Palo Alto should investigate racial profiling remarks 
### 
The Palo Alto city government has
launched an aggressive damage con
trol campaign in response to Police
Chief Lynne Johnson's remarks suggesting
that officers should engage in racial profil
ing of African Americans following a recent
crime increase. Johnson has apologized sev
eral times and has promised to spend the
next few weeks repairing relationships with
black congregations and community lead
ers.
Merely apologizing for the remarks,
however, and claiming that she misspoke
will not be enough to repair Johnson's dam
age. The editorial board believes that the
practices of the Palo Alto Police Depart
ment should be fully investigated to assure
the community that racial profiling is not
taking place.
Johnson stated in a television interview
that because the suspects in a string of
crimes around the Cal-Train station in Palo
Alto were African-American, officers were
being urged to make "consensual contact"
with all black men seen in the area "to find
out who they are." We are concerned that
Johnson did not seem to realize how insen
sitive — as well as illegal — this strategy
was until the community responded with
outrage. Only then did she retreat and say
that African-American men would only be
stopped if they fit a more detailed descrip
tion of the suspects.
Both Palo Alto Mayor Larry Klein and
City Manager James Keene rightfully con
demned the remarks, but then quickly ex
cused them as a slip of the tongue and insist
ed that racial profiling is not being practiced
in Palo Alto. Citizens of the community,
however, noted several instances where
racial profiling had occurred without repa
rations at Monday's city council meeting.
Even if the assurances of Johnson's defend
ers are true, more must be done to prove
that to the community. It is offensive to us
that our peers could easily be victims of
such racial profiling.
Racial profiling breaks the trust that
needs to exist between citizens and police in

order to keep our communities safe. It
makes citizens feel victimized rather than
protected. It makes even honorable police
officers that play by the rules fearful that a
legitimate judgment call about who to ques
tion or arrest will result in an allegation of
racism. Even a suspicion of racial profiling
must be fully investigated.
Many citizens of Palo Alto — including
nearly 50 Stanford students — attended the
Palo Alto City Council meeting on Monday
night to ask for that investigation. Although
some of those in attendance called for John
son's resignation, most seemed more con
cerned with making sure that regardless of
the police chief's verbal gaffe, racial profil
ing is not and will not be happening in Palo
Alto. Others suggested that Johnson and
perhaps the rest of the police force undergo
sensitivity training.
The editorial board agrees that these are
the right steps to take. An audit or investiga
tion of current police practices, while per
haps time-consuming or costly, is the only
way to ensure that the civil liberties of Palo
Alto residents are not being threatened.
Sensitivity training might strike some as
trite, but given Johnson's lack of initial
awareness about the impact of her remarks,
it seems necessary. Such training should not
be viewed as punishment, but as necessary
to help all officers fulfill their most basic re
quirement: serving their citizens.
At the same time. Johnson has been a
dedicated public servant, and without more
evidence, it seems premature to ask her to
resign. If an investigation reveals a history
of racist behavior or proves that she has in
deed put racial profiling into practice. John
son should be removed from her position.
Palo Alto is a community that prides it
self on tolerance and progressive values,
and it borders one of the most diverse elite
universities in the nation. Practices such as
racial profiling are the antithesis of the val
ues that Stanford and Palo Alto normally
project, and the editorial board calls for a
full investigation to determine that those
practices are not and never will be in use.
