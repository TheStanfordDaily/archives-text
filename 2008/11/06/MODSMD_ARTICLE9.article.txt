# Stu's Views
## Almost perfect 
### 
Everyone agrees that this election will
go down in history, not only for our
first non-white president, but also as
the longest and the most expensive. It's ad
ditionally clear that this was the second half
of the "Democratic wave" that began in
2006 — the Democrats took at least six
Senate seats, 19 House seats and most im
portantly, the presidency in this election,
after 30 House seats and eight Senate seats
two years ago.
ITiis election was almost perfect. It was a
clear mandate for Democrats to govern,
from top to bottom. What is most clear about
this Democratic wave, or at least this half of
it, is that it was won almost entirely on eco
nomic issues. Obama's rise in the polls began
with the collapse of Lehman Brothers and
the start of the real economic panic, and as
the economy got worse and worse, he did
better and better. Something like 63 percent
of voters listed the economy as the most im
portant issue according to exit polls, and
Obama won those voters 53-44.
Unfortunately, I had hoped that this
election would not be waged entirely on
economic grounds, and not only because I
am uncomfortable with Obama's positions
on trade and globalization. Due to the De
mocrats' extremely advantageous position
nationwide, I had hoped to see something
else last night: a real expansions of rights —
gay marriage, choice, free speech — rather
than another incremental erosion. With the
surprisingly large backlash against Gover
nor Sarah Palin, whose extreme positions
on social issues exceeded even that of John
McCain, it seemed like Democrats could at
least win a battle in the culture war. finally.
That appears not to have been the case.
Even as Obama won 61 percent in Califor
nia, the "No on K" campaign was only able
to muster 47 percent. More concerning.
Proposition 4 received 4K percent of the
vote, higher than the 47 percent and 45 per
cent it received in the previous two elec
tions, when similarly worded propositions
were on the ballot. Same-sex marriage bans
sailed through in two other states, and
Arkansas, for good measure, banned adop
tions by gay couples as well. Michigan did
vote to allow stem cell research and med
ical marijuana, but it seems like we're just
barely catching up to the America of 1975
and still far behind any other liberal
democracy.

Republicans have owned the culture
war for decades, which reached its high
point during the late 19905, as represented
by Bill Clinton's circus impeachment pro
ceedings. It has been fought mostly on their
terms, and they have made full use of their
home-field advantage. It is easy to tar and
feather advocates of more accessible con
traception; it's much more difficult to de
fend using the sound bytes that Republi
cans use as currency. This political climate
and media culture of 30-second YouTUbe
clips does not lend itself to serious policy
discussion or the use of complex argu
ments. It takes far longer to rebut the
ridiculous claim that Obama is a Muslim
than to simply call him one.
Some of our most treasured social institu
tions remain in peril. While women still have
the right to choose, it's been slowly eroding.
It's inconceivable to even think of a turn
around in the next decade. The pro-lifers'
"stealth" strategy of gradual infringement
has worked in some states.The fight over the
morning-after pill was unreal. Somehow we
are supposed to worry about the poor state
of our schools and our lack of competitive
ness globally, yet we still insist on teaching
our children about creationism (excuse me,
"intelligent design") in science class.
It seems that Americans' dislike of Palin
was due to her incompetence and startling
lack of seriousness, rather than her policy
positions. It also seems true of Republicans
generally. Most Americans opposed the
bailout, but it was the Democrats who led
the fight for it in Congress. Hie Republi
cans have been manifestly rejected, not be
cause of their policy agenda, but because of
their failure to govern in a clean, effective
fashion.
