DEAR DR. PAUL,
I am a freshman, and while I have always been comfort
able in my own skin,
school I was one of the bigger guys. Now, I feel like a
little wimp next to all the senior men. It's hurting my
game. I've been hitting the gym every day and drinking
thick protein shakes with every meal, but I just can't
seem to get huge. Any suggestions?
Dear Girlie Man,
How big are you thinking? Incredible Hulk huge or brad Pitt in "Troy: huge?
I'm here to tell you that without unbelievable genetics and some steroids, the
I lulk is unrealistic. Although you are drinking a lot of protein, it takes more
than shakes to get you yoked. Most important is a healthy, balanced diet. You're
not going to gain any muscle eating McDonald's cheeseburgers and drinking
Guinness every day Also, it's great that you hit the gym, but how long are you
there? Exercising 30 minutes a day is good for your heart but it won't make you
have the eye of the tiger like Rocky. I applaud your efforts, so keep
at it, and eventually you will start to notice a differ
ence. Alternatively, you could pick up a cigarette ■
habit, stop drinking protein shakes and pick your- j
self up a pair of skinny jeans. / \
Got a burning question you can't ask BUM"""™ -
anyone else?
