# This Stanford life: students tune in to storytelling at KZSU

a ne of the lawyers finally just
I 1 stopped me and said, 'You know,
there's no such thing as a story.
There arc only accounts that are legally defen
sible in a court of law.'"
Faced with this quote as the first line and
opening challenge of the episode "Telling
Other People's Stories," the Stanford
Storytelling Project (SSP) launches into an
hour-long radio program that considers the
challenges that face those telling the stories of
others. It doesn't just stop at one episode,
though; as a whole, SSP's entire goal is to dis
prove that lawyer's statement and, in fact,
assert that stories are not only existent, but
also essential to human interaction and com
munication.
Each Thursday at 6 p.m., as most
Stanford students settle down to eat dinner or
start work, a handful choose instead to fill a
studio at KZSU with the sound of storytelling
in all its varied forms Devoting themselves to
bringing the craft of storytelling to the
Stanford community, the SSP members air a
weekly radio program that explores story
telling through documentary, memoir, poetry,
fiction and essays as related to a certain
theme, which has in the past ranged from
Africa to Valentine's Day.
While all the staff, producers and authors
featured on the show are affiliated with

Can't get enough? Enter Stanford Storytelling's storytelling competition!

In order to reach new parts of the student body, SSP is holding a story
telling competition with the theme of "Narrow Escapes/Getting Caught"
and is inviting submissions from all students, emphasizing that regardless
of one's department or academic leanings, everyone has a story to tell.
The submissions, which should be able to be told in under 20 minutes,
can be submitted in either audio file or word document to
storytelling@stanford.edu until Dec. 1 .

Stanford, the show's content is not limited to a
Stanford-only audience. "Basically, the idea
behind it is really storytelling," explains senior
producer Charlie Mintz'lo. "We're just inter
ested in storytelling in every way, and that's
what every piece we have tries to focus on:
having a story."
SSI' benefits from the strong public inter
est in other radio shows such as "This
American Life," "Radio Lab" and
"Story Corps," while still working to carve out
a niche of its own by interviewing Stanford
professors, using music from campus ensem
bles and stories written by students, alumni or
Stegner fellows.
"It's more like Stanford reflecting out,"
Mintz said, adding that a portion of the listen
ing audience is alumni who may no longer
live near campus but should still be able to
enjoy the show.
From start to finish, developing a seem
ingly simple radio program is an intricate
process. It starts with a meeting, during which
SSP producers develop an idea for a show.
They draw their inspiration from a theme or a
compelling piece, and spread out from there
to find material that focuses on the chosen
topic. Most material is found through student
submission and general contacts, but SSP
hopes to increase its profile on campus and
work toward getting more submissions.

Once the material is collected, the pro
ducers work with the "editorial head hon
chos" — Bonnie Swift, the deputy director,
and Jonah Willihnganz, the director — to
develop the program in a collaborative
effort with the authors. The story segments
arc then recorded, often read aloud by the
authors themselves, in a studio in
Wallenberg Hall. Then,9 every Thursday, the
show is broadcast live, with a host delivering
the script in the KZSU studio and inserting
in the pre-recorded elements of music, sto
ries and interviews. The themes are usually
planned out a quarter in advance, and the
shows recorded a couple weeks prior to air
date.
The idea for SSP was born in a PWR 2
class taught by Willihnganz titled "The Art
of the Audio," and was made possible by
grants obtained from the Stanford Institute
for Creativity and the Arts, Stanford
Continuing Studies, the Stanford Oral
Communication Program and the Hume
Writing Center. When the show started air
ing in November of 2007, some of the mate
rial used in the first few episodes was origi
nally developed for the PWR class. But as
senior producer Dan Hirsch '09 explained,
"|SSP] is slowly moving toward more mate
rial produced specifically for the show."
Shifting toward SSP-specific and com
missioned programming is part of a larger
goal to expand the storytelling project to the
greater parts of campus.
"I would really love to get a wider sam
pling of authors," Hirsch explained.
"We want everyone to know someone

who's been involved with the Stanford
Storytelling Project," Mintz added. "We've
definitely covered the academic side really
well, hut the student side, we could do hct
ter."
The episodes from the first season of
the Stanford Storytelling Project, as well as
the new episodes that hegan airing on Nov.
8, are available either through Podcast or
online at storytelling.stanford.edu. For new
comers, Hirsch and Mintz recommended
listening to "Science and the Supernatural,"
which explores the few dedicated scientists
who use strict scientific methods to study a
very nontraditional subject — the paranor
mal.
SSP has grand ambitions to expand into
more than just a radio show, emphasizing
integration with academic departments, an
expanded Web site and more live events, but
for now is simply focusing on its original
inspiration: storytelling.
"I think (storytelling] is sort of funda
mental to how we think about our lives and
how we think about ourselves as shown by
how we tell stories," Hirsch said. "We really
believe that everyone has a good story to tell
— it doesn't have to be a polished piece, not
even from a fiction class, but maybe just an
idea. Even if you're never listened to 'This
American Life,' we can make it into a great
piece if you come with the idea and the
energy; it's your unique take on the world."
