# Is your passion practical?
## 
### 
Only a minority of students on campus arc pursuing
careers in the arts. However, given America's current
financial situation, the cliche of the starving artist is
losing its humor. Stanford opens doors towards lucrative
careers in consulting and medicine, but there are still those
students who would choose their artistic passion over what
peers and parents might advocate as more practical options.
For freshman Gary Champi '12, pursuing a major in
Dance is an easy decision — despite his parents who feel his
aspirations to be a professional dancer "are going to take him
nowhere."
Many of Champi's dance teachers disagree and see his
future as promising. After completing an intensive dance pro
gram this past summer at the California State Summer
School for the Arts, Champi received a prestigious scholar
ship.
"The program directors saw potential in me, and didn't
want me to stop dancing," Champi explained.
At Stanford, Champi is one of the only people in his
dance classes working towards a professional career in the
field. He doesn't mind that the other students arc taking
dance classes just for fun — the focused attention he gets
from his teachers is invaluable.
For others, Stanford's focus on more'"traditional" paths
— and the pressure from peers to take them — is deterring.
Julia Meltzer would be a senior this year, but has decided to
take time off from Stanford to pursue a career as an actor in
New York City.
"When I told my parents, they said 'Oh, Cod — it's a
waste of your time," Meltzer said of her parents' reaction to
her decision to leave. She felt more fulfilled by the training at
I langar Theater in Ithaca, N.Y.
"Stanford wasn't like the master class I took this summer,
where everyone's attitude was '1 will be an actor, so I will do
whatever I can in this room to build my craft,"' Meltzer said.

"If you want to be a professional artist, Stanford's not the
place." Despite Meltzer's confidence in the move, she hesi
tated to announce to her peers that she wanted to be a pro
fessional actress. On campus, she was a member of Stanford
Shakespeare Society and directed the widely revered rendi
tion of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" last spring. However,
even in that community of actors, pursuing a career on the
stage wasn't broadcasted.
"It's hard to do that at Stanford, because everyone wants
to be a doctor," Meltzer said. "I only recently felt okay saying I
want to be an actor."
Sara Sisun '09, a studio art major, the route opposite
Meltzer. Sisun transferred from Vassar College — a school
known for its artistic student body — to attend Stanford.
While Sisun prefers the diversity of opinions and majors at
Stanford, she has also had experiences where she felt misun
derstood by the community here.
Sisun received an Angel Grant and a Fall Quarterly grant
last year to create a series of self-portraits of her face taken in
a copy machine.
"The imagery is hopefully reflective of the internaliza
tion of external pressure, and how distortions affect emotion
al tone," she explained.
The audience at the UAR undergraduate research sym
posium, however, rarely asked for her artistic thesis. Sisun
spoke with one woman who grilled her with questions about
the instability of being an artist.
"She dropped the bomb that her daughter was at MIT
studying engineering but had really wanted to study art,"
Sisun said. "She felt bad that her daughter wasn't happy, but
that as parents, they just really wanted the daughter to suc
ceed; and art, for whatever reason, is scary to people."
Pursuing a career in art is a risk that many people strug
gle with. Margot Gilliland, a career counselor at the Career
Development Center who focuses on advising students in the

arts, recognized the challenges they face.
"A large number of the creative internships are unpaid,"
she said in an email to Intermission. "An unpaid internship
can be a burden for many students."
For those students who are unable to receive grant
money, or rely on the financial support of their parents, pur
suing a career in the arts is not a viable option. Money is just
one of the many reasons that students leave their high-school
artistic aspirations behind, and pursue more practical paths
when they come to Stanford.
Devin Tooma '09, an international relations major, was
heavily involved in the arts at her high school as the president
of the arts and painting department. When she arrived at
Stanford, art became a hobby instead of her academic focus.
"I decided to take advantage of one of the programs that
Stanford's best in: political science," Tooma said, explaining
that she doesn't regret her academic decisions in the slightest.
"To make a career out of art, it has to be your deepest under
lying passion first, something that you can't live without."
For Champi, Meltzer and Sisun, living without their art
is not an option.
"Life would be really hard ... without dance, I'd be one
of those people who is deprived of what they love most,"
Champi said.
These artists find ways to market their skills and talent
simply in order to sustain their passion — and it is because
of this passion that they will continue to give up more lucra
tive opportunities, helping to sustain the artistic communities
that benefit us all.
