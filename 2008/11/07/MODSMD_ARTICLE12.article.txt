# FILM REVIEW
## Recent Stanford grad shines on the silver screen 
### 
Documentaries are typically known for being
more educational than entertaining. However,
Disney's new documentary "Morning Light"
carries an extra draw: it features recent alum Graham
Brant-Zawadzki '07.
This sailing documentary begins with Roy E.
Disney (you may have heard of him, his father helped
found the Walt Disney Company), who wanted to
make a film about the Transpacific Yacht Race
(TRANSPAC), a widely revered open-ocean sailing
competition that begins in California and ends in

Hawaii. For this, Disney buys a brand new sailing boat,
Morning Light, and decides to fill its crew with the youngest
crew to ever sail the race.
The film begins with potential sailors being rigorously
interviewed and selected for the competition. All of the can
didates are smart and qualified, many of them hailing from
schools such as Harvard, Stanford and various military acad
emies. Once 15 potential crew members are selected, training
begins immediately. The TRANSPAC is no joke among sail
ing competitions — and the Morning Light's new crew has a
lot to learn.
From here, the film pretty much unfolds in a linear fash
ion. After six months of training, the crew of Morning Light
enters the TRANSPAC, where they have to think on their feet
as they compete against many seasoned sailors in their race
for victory. The film does, however, throw in a small twist:
Out of the chosen 15 sailors, only 11 of them will actually be
on the boat during the race, the remaining four acting as
alternates.
Unfortunately for Brant-Zawadzki fans, he was one of

these alternates and never actually competed in the
TRANSPAC. However, he still gets plenty of screen time, and
I still cheered loudly every time he appeared on the screen.
Even though the film's premise is pretty interesting, its
major problem is that it fails to go any deeper than what it
covers, which really just boiled down to a bunch of happy,
smiling youths sailing a boat. The few problems and issues
that they do encounter are glossed over and never given the
full emotional attention that they deserve. For this, I mainly
blame the fact that this is a Disney production, and as such it
strives to maintain its happy-go-lucky facade.
A lot of the shots in the film quickly become tiresome,
especially when the team begins the TRANSPAC. The shots
of the ocean are beautiful, but one can only get excited about
a sail boat jetting across the water so many times. Putting
more emphasis on the characters as people, as well as their
issues, would have greatly helped in this department. Not
surprisingly, the characters in the film never feel fully fleshed
out. Though 15 crew members is a formidable number, the

film fails to develop
any of the sailors
fully, and misses out
on its opportunity
to develop an emo
tional draw for the
audience.
As a documen
tary, "Morning
Light" does not real
ly offer anything

the vital stats.

particularly unique. The coverage of the TRANSPAC is pretty
cool, but the fact that the film superficially focuses on the
"intensity" of the race, as well as portraying all of the charac
ters as being disturbingly happy and smiley 24/7, makes this
film pretty one-sided.
