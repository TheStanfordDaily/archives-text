# intermission Q&A

### 
with alum Graham "BÂ£"
Intermission recently sat down with
Graham Brant-Zawadzki '07 to discuss his
role in Disney's documentary "Morning
Light." Afteivscheduling an appointment
with his publicist (he has a publicist now?),
Graham shared his thoughts with
Intermission writer Kyle Evaldez.
Intermission: When did this sailing compe
tition take place?
Brant-Zawadzki: It took place during July
of 2007. During that year, I had to take
winter and spring quarter off.
i: How did you hear about this competi
tion? How did you get involved?
BZ: I was involved with the sailing team
back at Stanford. I didn't have a whole lot

of experience before applying to this com
petition, and when I came across the appli
cation, I thought it sounded cool, so I just
applied.
i: How was the sailing competition for you?
How were the other people that were on
the boat with you?
BZ: Well, the people on the boat were just
completely amazing. They all came from
different parts of the country, so it was just
great getting to know all of them. Those
guys are still some of the closest friends
that I have. In terms of the sailing, it was
really intimidating going in since I didn't
have that much experience. However, it was
just a huge learning experience for me; and
almost everything I learned, I was learning
for the first time.
i: Did you know about the filming during
all of this, and that it was going to eventu
ally lead to a movie?
BZ: So going in, the guys just told us that
they were going to shoot some footage to

make a documentary about the race. To be
honest, I really didn't know that it was
going to become anything bigger than what
it is now.
i: What was the filming process like? Did
you have to do some extra filming besides
just having camera people follow all of you
around?
BZ: We didn't have to do a whole lot of
extra stuff. We all had to fly down to L.A. to
do some audio recording since some of the
stuff we said on the boat gets washed out
by all the sound. The one thing that did
impress me with the film was that in the
final version, there is like no single cuss
word. I was so surprised that they were able
to edit all of it out because 1 just remember
that we all just swore so much!
i: What experiences from Stanford helped
you to prepare for all of this?
BZ: Wow, that's a good question. I think,
for me, Stanford really taught me how to
work on a team and always keep an open

mind. Since I was working with people
from different backgrounds, Stanford
helped me navigate through everyone's
diversity, and allowed me to be able to
appreciate everything about them.
i: So now that you've done a movie, what's
in store for you now? Do you plan on going
to Hollywood or anything? 1 know that last
time we spoke you mentioned that you
were pre-med ...
BZ: When it comes down to it, this whole
movie thing has been a funny experience,
but I really don't see anything coming from
it. In fact, I kind of find it embarrassing,
and am kind of excited about it to die
down. With regards to my future plans, I'm
still pre-med, living in San Francisco, and
am actually trying to find a job right now.
