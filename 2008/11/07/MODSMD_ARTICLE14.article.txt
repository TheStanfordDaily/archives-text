## "Role Models": as funny and flawed as its characters 
### 
Comedy movies have been seeing quite
a lull lately. As movie studios prepare
to unleash their latest round of
blockbusters for the holiday season, movies
that pride themselves on tickling our funny
bones seem to be getting pushed aside.
Thankfully, this is where "Role Models"
comes in — one of the better comedy movies
to hit the big screen this fall.
The story's premise is pretty simple. Two
co-workers, Wheeler and Danny (Seann
William Scott and Paul Rudd, respectively)
are given the option of either going to jail or
completing 150 hours of community service
at a local mentoring program after a casual
run-in with the law. The two choose the
community service route, but immediately
begin to regret that decision after meeting
the two children that they are supposed to
befriend and mentor. Wheeler gets stuck with
Ronnie (Bobb'e Thompson), an African-
American boy that is vulgar, violent and has
a strong interest in the female chest region.
Danny gets Augie played by Christopher
Mintz-Plasse, who is most notably known for
his work as "McLovin" in "Superbad."
Not surprisingly, the character of Augie
is your typical nerd, with a fondness for
video games and "LARPing," which stands
for playing Live Action Role-Playing games.
These LARPs arc extremely elaborate and are
fleshed out pretty thoroughly within the film.
To better imagine what a LARP is, think a

Renaissance Fair but for a fan
tasy video game.
With all of these elements
in play, it is not too hard to
predict how the movie unfolds.
Rudd and Scott's characters
have trouble initially bonding
with their kids, but by the end
of the movie, they are all one
big, happy family. Thankfully,
comedies do not need elabo
rate, intricate plots. Making the
audience laugh is what counts,
and "Role Models" does just
that.
"Role Models" relies on a
simple method of comedy:
humorous dialogue and put
ting the characters in interest-

ing situations. Rudd and Scott make a great
duo, and they have pretty good comcdic
chemistry with one another. Their kids are
also hilarious, each with their own form of
character humor.
1 only have two big gripes about the
movie. First off, the development of the rela
tionships between Rudd and Scott and their
kids is completely unbalanced. In one scene
they are all miserable with one another, and
then almost overnight they are all getting
along just fine. Since these relationships real
ly form the heart of the movie, greater focus
should have been paid to the subtle details of

how one actually forms a meaningful bond
with a young and troubled child.
Finally, the movie clearly pays more
attention to the relationship between Augie
and Danny. Granted, Danny is the main
character, so his mentor-mentee relationship
is naturally given more emphasis, I still
would have liked to see more between
Wheeler and his child — especially since the
kid is almost as rude and vulgar as his men-

Even though these relationships are not
perfectly developed within the film, "Role

Models" still manages to deliver a solid, hilar

the vital stats.

Comedy
after a slight run-in with the law,
two energy drink reps are sentenced
to community service: mentoring
Lk.ds. A

ious time. The film never gets too bogged
down in details and strives to focus purely on
the funny, without ever overdoing it. Scott
and Rudd are not the perfect role models in
the film, but are still fun to watch overall —
just like this movie.
