# MUSiC REVIEW
## offers up surprises in her sophomore album RACHAEL YAMAGATA 
### 
Three years ago, Rachael Yamagata was
just beginning to appear on the scene
with her debut album,
"Happenstance." After a long wait, she has
produced "Elephants ... Teeth Sinking Into
Heart," a follow-up that, while only several
years in the making, sounds as if it's written
and sung by a woman whose soul has aged a
decade since her first album.
Gone are her former forays into happy
go-lucky, when she sang about hippie love,

crooning, "I find it to be magical /1 feel like
- I'm loving you in 1963 with flowers in my
I hair." In its place is a riper, darker sound that
I meshes more smoothly with her characteris
tically raspy voice. Even before the album is
opened, Rachael Yamagata makes it known
that this project reaches for a more ambi
tious goal than her previous one. Vaguely
modeled as two concept albums paired
together, the work is divided into
"Elephants," a set of nine intimate songs in a
daze of melancholy, and "Teeth Sinking Into
Heart," which encompasses the bitter and
angry side of heartbreak in five grittier songs.
The title track and opener, "Elephants,"
is quick to establish this world-weary tone,
with a mournful piano accompanying her as
she sings, "If the elephants have past lives /
Yet are destined to always remember / It's no
wonder how they scream / Like you and I
they must have some temper... You are
forcing me to remember / When all I want is
to just forget you."
These are the words of someone who has
learned to love through trial and error, and
it's reflected in all of her songs. Throughout
"Elephants," the instrumentation remains
sparse and only swells further in a few heart
wrenching choruses. Instead of focusing on
developing the musical hooks that made
"Happenstance" such a singable gem,
Yamagata emphasizes her lyrical side, spot-

lighting her poetry with floating, ethereal
melodies that, for all their beauty, often lack
the cohesion to carry the momentum of the
album.
It makes for an interesting ambiance
during the first few tracks, hut after a while,
"Elephants" begins to drag its feet; the effort
to create an intimate musical portrait begins
with good intentions and pensive thoughtful
ness, but spirals down into something a little
tiresome and mundane. However, a few
tracks manage to stand out among their
peers. "What If I Leave" is peaceful with a
quiet energy, and "Horizon," while mostly
unremarkable, contains a frail and lovely hid
den track with just Yamagata and a guitar.
Best of all, though, "Duet" features an under
stated yet poignant collaboration with the
simply amazing Ray LaMontagne, whose
unmistakable growl is rendered softer as he
sings with Yamagata about two old lovers
returning to each other.
On the flip side, "Teeth Sinking Into
Heart" is far less poetic and instead seems to
draw its driving force from bitterness.
Yamagata puts her rough voice to a different
task with these songs, which arc darker and
harsher, spitting out lyrics like "So this shit
about taking in the souls / And life's lasting
misery / We're gonna take them down / And
do it on the front page." One can applaud the
sincer for stepping out into something a little

unexpected, but she feels out of her element
in these songs, and she curiously chooses to
mute her powerful voice in several of the
tracks, which effectively blocks out one of
her strongest assets.
Despite these missteps, Yamagata almost
redeems herself at the very end of "Teeth
Sinking into Heart" with "Don't," a sleepy
ballad in that lazy, almost-country style that
has resurfaced recently among indie artists
like lenny Lewis. Overall, this sophomore
effort is hard to pin down; it morphs from
one mood to another, never truly hitting its
stride. Regardless, it does plenty to assure her
fans that she still has plenty of surprises to
offer and has made tangible progress in
maturing as an artist.
