# Guiltless pleasures: Roxy's three favorite literary sex scenes

Delving into a trashy erotica novel can be a
fun and lusty enterprise. But as an English
geek, 1 choose to look to the greats to throw
me unexpectedly into the depths of a magnificent sex
scene. Here is my top three:
No. I: "Fountainhead," by Ayn Rand: Sex in
Rand's fiction has been criticized as violent and
fetishistic, which is what makes it so glorious. Female
protagonist Dominique Francon is unapologetically
sexual and fiercely independent; and her lover,
Howard Roark, is Rand's characteristic male hero —
strong, handsome, brilliant and uncompromising.
After what feels like ages of agonizing anticipation,
Roark sneaks into Francon's window and takes his
lover in a climax so explosively passionate that both
readers and characters are left in a state of blissful
fatigue.
No. 2: "Lady Chatterley's Lover," by D.H.
Lawrence: In his marvelously controversial novel,
Lawrence shocked readers of the late 1920s with his
graphic sex scenes, which caused the book to be
banned from multiple countries. The novel addresses
the relationship between the body and mind, their

respective stimulation and necessary connection
Little is left to the imagination, and Lawrence
manages to weave his words into a swirl of lus-

cious, overwhelmingly beautiful poetry,
immersing the reader in the heat and confu
sion of the moments he describes. Even in
2008, readers can't help but feel naughty read
ing passages like this one:

"He too had bared the front part of his body and she

felt his naked flesh against her as he came into her. For
a moment he was still inside her, turgid there and quiv-

J
ering. Then, as he began to move, in the sudden help
less orgasm, there awoke in her new strange thrills rip
pling inside her. Rippling, rippling rippling, like flap
ping overlapping of soft flames, soft as feathers, running
to points of brilliance, exquisite, exquisite and melting
her all molten inside."
Number 3: "Rayuela" (in English,"Hopscotch"),
by Julio Cortazar: Sex is the intoxicating merge of
two bodies into a whirl of blurred and animated sen
sation — sight, smell, sound, taste and, perhaps most
importantly, touch. In only a few hundred words,
Argentine author Cortazar captures the gritty and
heavenly ecstasy of this union in his wonderfully
avant-garde style:
"Then my hands go to sink into your hair, to cherish
slowly the depth of your hair while we kiss as if our
mouths were filled with flowers or with fish, with lively
movements and dark fragrance. And if we bite each
other the pain is sweet, and if we smother each other in
a brief and terrible sucking in together of our breaths,
that momentary death is beautiful. And there is but one

saliva and one flavor of ripe fruit, and 1

feel you tremble against me like a

moon on the water."
