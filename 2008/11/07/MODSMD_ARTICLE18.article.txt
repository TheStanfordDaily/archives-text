# A 						renovated green museum opens in Golden Gate
## 
### 
The California Academy of Sciences,
located in Golden Gate Park in San
Fr#|tdSco, has its nevvl^^F
making the Academy is now housed in a
cutting-edge building of glass and steel with

a "living roof" designed by award-winning
architect Renzo Piano.
Seen from the front, the floor-to
ceiling glass panels allow visitors to look
straight into the museum with its open cen
tral space and natural lighting. The building
is designed to maximize the sunlight and
breeze from the park to regulate the lighting
and temperature with minimum energy
expenditure. Perhaps most startlingly unique
is the "living roof," a veritable lawn of grass
and small plants, with skylights opening up
into the museum below and solar panels over
the eaves.
Continuing this trend of sustain
ability, the building also uses recycled denim
scraps as insulation, along with the soil from
the natural roof, and heats the building using
pipes in the floor. All in all, they have pre-

Ed the highest level of I.FED certification by
the U.S. Green Building Council, making it
the largest Platinum-rated building in the
world.
But of course, the Academy is more
than just a green building. It is in fact a high
ly synthetic museum, combining an aquari
um, natural history museum and planetari
um under one eco-conscious roof. It also
houses a four-story, fully enclosed rainforest,
along with a variety of live animals, skeletons
and stuffed displays. Over 40,000 animals arc
scattered through exhibits.
Upon entering the museum, imme

architectural spheres are smaller exhibits of

visitors can see live coral and a plethora of

fish. At either end of the museum there are

about climate change in California. The
exhibits are very interactive and many are
child-friendly, with games that teach kids
about greenhouse gases, the melting of the
polar ice caps and how to offset a carbon
footprint.
The Academy also has on display a
mini-exhibit about building green and the
green practices of its own building. There is
even a station where visitors can email their
representatives regarding their concerns
about climate change.
Perhaps the most stunning part of
the museum is its aquarium, which has
exhibits ranging from the California coast to
swamps and coal reefs.
In addition to the classic exhibits,
visitors may go to the naturalist center and
watch the scientists at work, walk up onto

the living roof or get foodat one of the eat
ing spaces in the museum.
For visitors interested in seeing the
whole museum in one day, get there early.
Since its grand reopening this fall, the muse
um has been extremely busy every weekend,
from open to close, and there is a limited
capacity in the planetarium and to view the
movie currently playing at the museum,
"Bugs."
Also, beware the traffic inside
Golden Gate Park. There is a convenient
parking structure directly underneath the
museum, but the wait to get there can be
horrendous.
Though it is possible to do the
museum in one day, be wary of the crowds
inside the building. All in all, the new layout,
eco-friendly building and interactive exhibits
work together to promote the Academy's
mission: to explore, explain and protect the
natural world.
