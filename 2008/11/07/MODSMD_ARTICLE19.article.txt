# Jeffrey's Hamburgers keeps is simple
## 
### 
From a cheap bite at In-N-Out to a rela
tively high-end experience at The
Counter, Stanford students have no
shortage of options when looking for a burg
er. Somewhere in the middle of the spectrum
is Jeffrey's Hamburgers in Menlo Park.
Located on El Camino Real, Jeffrey's is just a
short hop from campus and ideal for a quick
burger when the on-campus options won't
do.
The atmosphere at Jeffrey's could be
described as a more successful attempt of the
vibe The Axe & Palm failed to capture:
namely, a *50s-themed diner. And while the
menu at Jeffrey's is not nearly as comprehen
sive as a real diner, it offers a solid selection

of inexpensive, easy-to-like choices,
i The main attraction, of course,

arc the burgers; but there are also a number
of sandwiches ranging from BLTs to rib-eye
steak, as well as salads and fish and chips.
Given the setting, the most appropriate bev
erage would probably be a milk shake, but
there is also a small selection of beers on tap.
The style of service is what I refer to as
California casual. Orders are taken at the
counter and then brought to your table —
assuming you have put your number in a
sufficiently visible position. Ordering a burg
er is a relatively simple proposition (unlike,
for example, at The Counter, where you
might need 20 minutes and a friend's advice
before being able to get through all of the
choices). The basic options consist of various

combinations of
cheese, bacon, mush
room and pineapple.
After ordering,
my food arrived with
impressive speed. This
may vary depending
on how busy Jeffrey's

staff is, but the turnaround was possibly
faster than that at In-N-Out (not to mention
the drive is much shorter). The burgers
arrived cleanly presented but rather sparse in
terms of the garnishes; that is your own
responsibility as there is a salad bar with
everything else you'd want to add to your
burger, including lettuce, tomato, onions,
pickles and jalapenos.
Burgers at Jeffrey's don't have too much
going on. The quantity of meat is about aver
age (perhaps around tine-third pound), and
the add-ons are relatively limited and simple.
However, what Jeffery's does do, it does well.
The burgers, which were ordered medium
rare, exhibited just the right amount of pink

on the inside, while the
cheese was nicely melt
ed and the various veg
gies on top all looked
fresh and tasted good.
The burgers'
accompaniments were
fine, though hardly

overwhelming. The fries were tasty and of
appropriate thickness, though they could
have been a bit crispier. The onion rings were
average, but lost points for structural integri
ty when a single bite extracted all of the
onion, leaving just a ring of fry. The milk
shake included a generous amount of ice
cream, but would have been better if the fla
vor (in this case vanilla) was stronger.
There isn't much about the Jeffrey's
experience that really stands out, but the
diner deserves credit for sticking to the basics
and getting them right. The burgers arc not
amazing, but they are definitely respectable,
and the prices (around six dollars) arc very
reasonable. A place to go on a date or to hang
out for a few beers, it is not. Hut if you're
craving a good, quick burger by yourself or
with a friend, it's a pretty safe bet.
