## Beauty & muscles

By the time I dialed Jessi Reel's number, I had
created an image of her in my head. After all,
I knew that 1 was about to talk to an artist,
one whose work was good enough to go up in the
CoHo. By virtue of that fact, she had to be a damn
good artist, for sure. To go with that stereotype, I
thought, she probably wore bohemian skirts, had
flowers in her hair and devoted her life single
mindedly to art with the passion of a thousand
suns.
I exaggerate. But even if 1 had harbored that
terrifyingly romantic picture of the creative spirit, I
should have known that a Stanfordite would have
proven me wrong. Far from trundling down the
well-worn path, Reel seemed to prefer crossing the
busiest intersections, where art, sport and intellec
tual pursuits meet.
"I thought I was going to be an artist," Reel
revealed. "1 was deciding between art conservatories
and Stanford. But creativity incubates over time, so
being a whole person at Stanford was so much
more important."
Her philosophy could not be clearer. On arriv
ing at Stanford, Jessi didn't just continue to paint.
She started rowing, a sport that "changed my life in
the most awesome way." She currently plans to train
with the national rowing team after graduation.
This diversity in her interests is reflected in
Reel's artwork. Her paintings, which went up in the
CoHo last week, feature athletes: their physicality,
their energy and, as simple as it sounds, their bodies
of athletic beauty.
"It was the most natural thing to do," Reel said.
"You paint what you see — the beautiful forms.

[The paintings in the
CoHo] are also
expressing the indi
viduality of the sport."
Reel achieves her
goals. While preview
ing her art, 1 was
impressed by the
undulating textures,
the effective propor
tions and the lingering
sense of transience, as
if these paintings were
only a split second in
an arc of athletic
movement and beau-

ty. What impressed
me the most, however,
was the thought put into the work; thought not just
poetic or artistic, but intellectual.
"This art's a launching point for some ideas
I'm developing about images and physiques in
media," Reel said, before further elaborating. "The
athletic physique is very different from the model
physique, for example. It has a purpose because it
optimizes [the athletic] performance and pushes
our bodies' limits. It's beautiful, but sometimes, it
comes in a slightly different form than you see in
the media."
Reel's analysis extends to her own artwork,
where she loves thinking about motifs and juxtapo
sitions. In one of her pieces, a woman stretches
while wearing Nikes. Reel explained that it was a
contrast of Renaissance-style painting, contextual

ized in very modern symbols: first the Nikes, and
second, the fact that it was a female athlete being
empowered by her clothes and attire.
When it comes down to it, athleticism and art
aren't all that different, Reel thinks.
"In art, not only do you take in all these differ
ent influences and elements you learn about in life,"
she said. "You're analyzing them and you're creating
something beautiful and challenging. You're learn
ing and processing, but you're learning with your
body."
She paused, and then reflected simply, "It's just
like rowing."
