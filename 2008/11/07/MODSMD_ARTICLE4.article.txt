# Now showing: "Ghostpile"
## 
### 
The focus of the exhibition "Ghostpile" is easy to
describe: pictures taken in the floodplain of
Sacramento Valley. What is much harder to pin down
are the deeper currents that the artist, Stanford photography
professor Lukas Felzmann, probes with this layered and
engrossing show.
Felzmann said that he intended to create a show that is
"dense and complex, and engages the viewer in thinking" —
and he has succeeded; each new wall is filled with carefully
arranged images that are organized by theme, providing
seemingly endless details if you look deeper.
Exploring themes like places of transition, the pace of
life tied to agriculture and human control over the land
could keep a visitor for hours. A casual viewer, however, can
leave with new knowledge of a typically overlooked region
and a reframed view of the powerful, and often beautiful,
forces at work in the floodplain.
This exhibition seems almost like several shows in one:
each wall has pictures in different sizes and arrangements,
often with their own sub-theme and visual style. One side of
the gallery consists mostly of rows and grids of tiny photo
graphs, meant to be individually glanced at, but understood
as a whole. Themes such as the things people push away, the
shelters they surround themselves with and the currents that
move through the area are illustrated both by variety and
repetition; they display a range of small details to create an
overall picture, and the sheer number of them drives home
the magnitude of what is being displayed.
On the opposite side, larger pictures lend themselves to
individual meanings, as well as an overall effect; one picture
may help illustrate the relationship between humans and the
flooding river, as well as provide intimate details of the dam-

age to one cracked culvert.
The title "Ghostpile" refers, according to Felzmann, to
the idea that "pictures are layers of things that are passed ...
the world is a layer of strata, or a pile, and photography is a
ghost image of it." The "layer" motif is found in how the
flooding river lays down silt to create fertile soil, as well as in
Felzmann's grouping together or layering of themes to cap
ture the region.
As a Stanford professor who has been exhibited both
around the world and in prestigious local venues such as
Southern Exposure and the SFMOMA, Felzmann said he is
particularly excited about showing here at Stanford.
"As a teacher, it is good for students to see the work I
do," he said.
Also on display in the exhibit is a book, "Ghostpile,"
which draws from the same collection of photographs as the
show. The case exhibits Felzmann's process of bookmaking,
which involves a much more linear progression of pictures
than the immersive gallery environment.
The combination of meanings and levels of detail in the
show combine to give an overall understanding of the push
and pull between humans and nature, wet and dry, speeding
through and slowing down. Felzmann has created a complex
puzzle of meaning, but it is one worth solving.
"Ghostpile" is on view through Dec. 14 at the Thomas
Welton Stanford Art Gallery. The gallery is open Tuesday
through Friday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday,
1 p.m. to 5 p.m.
