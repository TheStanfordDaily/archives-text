# The 						Savoyards' "HMS Pinafore"
## a 						nautically fun time for all 
### 
Playing this weekend at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, Gilbert and Sullivan's
"HMS Pinafore" is a fast-paced, highly
enjoyable, comedic love story that is sure to

amuse and
entertain all
types of audi
ence, even those
who would never
dream of giving
up their
Saturday night to
see an "opera."
The show
is put on by the
Stanford
Savoyards, and is
their first pro
duction of the
year.
The story
follows young
Josephine, who
is engaged to Sir
Joseph Porter, an
upper crust who
believes that all
men should be
treated equally

regardless of
rank or class. It remains to be seen, however,
whether his progressive attitudes hold when
he finds that Josephine is in love with the
commons sailor, Ralph Rakestraw. Mischief

and mayhem ensue as Josephine's father (the
Captain), Dick Deadeye, "Little Buttercup"
Josephine and her two competing gentlemen
all get involved in what they believe would
make the most suitable marriage.
Directed by Aumna Iqbal '09, the
Stanford Savoyards are a student-run group
of actors, singers, technicians and musicians
who dedicate their skills in the theatre world
to recreate the classics of Gilbert and
Sullivan, whose other works include Pirates
of Penzance and The Gondoliers.
In this particular production, the full
orchestra is absolutely phenomenal, keeping
the audience tapping their toes throughout
each upbeat and enjoyable song. A cast of
entirely humorous characters keep people
grinning and chuckling for the entire span of
two hours, making this show a relatively
short opera. The set and recreation of the
ship is incredibly impressive. The ropes,
masts, cabins and sails are realistic and very
fun to look at throughout the production.
The most noteworthy component of the
performance is the singing abilities of the
cast. Natalie Wilemon (Josephine) has an
outstanding and almost unbelievable sopra
no, not faltering for a note throughout each
of her songs. Daniel Galpin (Uakestraw) is a
very strong tenor, in addition to being an

excellent actor.
While the lead actors are strong, the
dance numbers in the show fall flat. The cho
reography is unexciting, and when there is
dancing, few cast members look confident in
the steps they are performing. Even big group
numbers leave the ensemble standing in
either a clump or an uneven line across the
stage. Still, the vocals are the main focus of
the opera, and are strong enough to carry the
show through. The ensemble does a very
impressive job of maintaining high energy in
each group number, always giving the audi
ence something entertaining to watch and
listen to.
Playing tonight 8 p.m., as well as Nov. 8
and 15 at 8 p.m., and Nov. 16 at 2:30 p.m.,
"HMS Pinafore" is sure to delight any audi
ence who loves music, comedy, love stories,
happy endings, sailors or all of the above.
Tickcts are $8 for students, and available by
phone at the Stanford Ticket Office (650-
725-2787), inside Tresidder Union and at the
door each night of the performance.
