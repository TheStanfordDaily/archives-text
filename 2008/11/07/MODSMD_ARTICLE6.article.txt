# A
						classic Greek tale retold
## "Eurydice" succeeds in its portrayal of feminine love 
### 
fy arah Ruhl's "Eurydice," directed by sen
ior drama majors Elisabeth Barnick and
Michelle Sutherland, is a cathartic expe
rience that will capture the hearts and minds
of its audience. Any daughter who has felt
she has lost her father in any way; young
people in love but uncertain of what exactly
that means; would-be dark lords, yearning
for power, full of lust and vigor; artists, musi
cians, poets, writers and lovers: this play is
for you.
Ruhl's stunning drama is much more
than a reinventing of the Greek myth of
Orpheus — it is a poetic retelling with a
completely different tilt. Here, the audience
gets a glimpse of the nuances of feminine
love and heartbreak as presented by
Eurydice. Orpheus is present and alive, but it
is Eurydice's emotional journey that propels
the action of the play. It is a moving tale "by
a woman, about a woman," said Senior
Project Director Roselyn Hallett, who plays
Eurydice. The play reverses the traditional
tale, which centered on Orpheus' journey
into the underworld to find his beloved
Eurydice, who died too soon after their mar
riage, and makes the story about her experi

ence rather than his.
Brilliantly cast, cach and every ensemble
member remains connected and engaged
throughout. While Eurydice is the play's
focus, Hallett does not try to outshine the
rest of her actors, but rather is there in the
midst of them, binding them all together. All
of the actors are absolutely charming and
beautiful, so pleasant to look at and listen to.
The set consists of scattered antique fig
urines, a hodgepodge of trinkets, bowls of

colored water representing the waters of
forgetfulness and photographs strewn
across the floor — memories littered
throughout the play that provide a cer
tain eeriness to the scene, a sense of
things lost and forgotten, as well as still
ness. One perceives the thematic ele
ments before the show even begins.
The relationship between Eurydice
and Orpheus (Will Lindemann) embod
ies innocence. Their love is young and
beautiful, a delight to watch. At first, they
may appear too naive, but Eurydice's
naivete in particular proves to invaluable
to the drama of the play. It is the way in
which, through death, Eurydice becomes

a woman that we arc taught something about
life. Loss changes us, teaches us tilings, and
though we still may be dead inside at the
end, wc have gained wisdom that carries with
it a certain sweetness — one that tells us our
lives are meaningful and each moment, each
memory, embodies who wc are. Hut some
times, forgetting is the only way to move on.
"Won't I fall down when the song ends?"
Eurydicc says, afraid to become an instru
ment for Orpheus. She speaks of that fear all

people have in love, that when the music is
over, when love fades, how much will it hurt
when we all fall to the ground? Poignant
phrases like this fill the play as each character
brings the wisdom of their experiences to the
stage.
"This is what it is like to love an artist,"
Eurydice laments. "The moon is always rising
above you ... he is always going away from
