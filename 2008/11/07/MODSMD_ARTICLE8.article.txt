# The

To most modern Americans,
prostitution is barely on the
radar. The word itself conjures
up images of desperate heroin addicts
or, perhaps, historical courtesans in
exotic lands. Neither of these popula
tions, however, are the focus of Louise
Brown's book "The Dancing Girls of
Lahore." There, the red-light district of
Heera Mandi is dying; and Brown, a
sociologist studying the lives of its pop
ulation, is marvelous at weaving in dis
cussions of the contributing factors
among vibrant narratives of life in the
Diamond Market.
Through excerpts from the
journal she kept while living in Heera
Mandi, Brown shows us the rapid tran
sition from a multicultural city to a
monocultural one that resulted from
the partition of the Indian subcontinent
— and its implications for the ostra
cized classes. She shows us escalating
Westernization — and its implications
for those whose livelihood was based on
traditional arts and pastimes.
What the book does most
poignantly, however, is show us the
constant struggle that is life in contem
porary Heera Mandi. While the rest of
the world celebrates the clean-up of
such dens of vice, those who made their
living there find their already desperate
situations becoming even more so. The
entertainers who populate the pages of

"Dancing Girls" are unfit for marriage
because of their background, and few
other opportunities are available for
women without male guardians. They
bear the burden — the pimps and
human traffickers will always find ways
to wring profits from other people's
work.
And yet, what impressed me
most about the book was the author
herself. While becoming a sociologist
and living in far-flung places for
months at a time is not exactly every
one's calling, there is something to be
said for maintaining an awareness of
the rest of the world's population.
History is awash with cases of good
intentions gone awry, the result of cul
turally based misconceptions and plain
ignorance (including, at times, blatant
refusal to acknowledge facts). And as
the world shrinks, the consequences
escalate: from the hesitancy of Western
nations to confront 1930s Germany to
the over-eager involvement of the
United States in 1960s Vietnam.
It is rather humbling to con
sider the sentiment expressed by
Rudyard Kipling's "The White Man's
Burden" and its relationship with the
modern, enthusiastic but often sadly
misdirected attempts to aid third
world inhabitants. Much of the aid
money thrown at Africa ends up prop
ping up regimes that continue to devas-

tate the continent instead of improving
anything except the self-satisfaction of
donors. Attempts to meddle in domes
tic politics often serve only to intensify
anti-Western sentiment and are used to
justify brutal "returns to tradition."
Americans are among the
most monolingual people in the world,
and we are considered overall extremely
ignorant of the affairs of the rest of our
planet. There is little excuse for this.
Having few neighboring countries
means little with high-speed communi
cation and travel at our disposal.
English may be the world's lingua fran
ca of the moment, but it is far from
universal. We may be the superpower of
the moment, but to rely on such status
is at best disrespectful and at worst (and
far more likely) foolhardy.
At Stanford, as recipients of
some of the best education available in
our country (and the world), we are
among the best-poised to change this
sad state of affairs. We owe nothing less
to ourselves, our nation and our global
community. There is an amazing
amount of energy on this campus that
wants to contribute, but we need to
make sure when we channel it that we
do not act on uninformed impulses, but
with enlightened dedication.
