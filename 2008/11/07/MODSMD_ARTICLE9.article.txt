# The
						drama department opens its T.S. Eliot-inspired season
## 
### 
The cool, dreary weather last weekend set the perfect
stage for the opening of the drama department's
year-long season of performances inspired by T.S.
Eliot's "The Waste Land."
The first production of the season, "T. S. Eliot's The
Waste Land in Black & White," directed by Aleta Hayes, was
an original work produced by Hayes and a team of Stanford
students and faculty. The non-traditional show blended
theatre, dance and song within a multi-layered framework
of Baroque theatre traditions and literary and artistic allu
sions.
The script drew from Eliot's allusion to the tale of Dido
and Aeneas and brings the classical story into a modern set
ting. Inspired in part by the Carlos Saura film rendition of
"Carmen," in which actors staging the opera begin to mimic
its events in their own lives, "The Waste Land in Black &
White" opened with the rehearsal process for what is appar
ently a version of the Purcell opera "Dido and Aeneas."
The actors quickly fall into the pattern of the classical
tragedy, representing Dido (Hayes), Aeneas (Donnie Hill
'09) and a modern, strong-willed version of Dido's confi
dante Belinda (Virginia Preston). The sort of love triangle
that develops among the three suggests that there exist
many types of love: divine, sexual, platonic.
Hayes' vision for the show was to "tell a story, mainly
through dance." True to her word, "The Waste Land in
Black & White" often eschewed dialog in favor of move
ment. Dramaturge and actress Virginia Preston said that the
participants in the project faced the challenging task of
"how to put language and movement together." The final
product featured minimal dialog, much of which was
drawn verbatim from"The Waste Land," with Baroque
dance and movement filling in the spaces.
The most powerful scene of the play, and the most suc
cessful use of dance to convey plot, came when the "actors"
rehearsed a Baroque dance. First, the lovers Dido and
Aeneas playfully moved through the number, his hand on
her chest, both of them smiling. Belinda reprimanded
them, telling them to do it as they rehearsed, and then took
the place of Aeneas, steadily leading Dido through the
repeated motions. The physical parallelism then gave way to
a stylized fight, set against red background lights.
Aiding in the show's development were a team of
directors, brought in mid-way through the process to offer
outside perspectives. Associate Director Jim Cadena, also a
Residence Dean, offered a vast knowledge of Baroque and
classical theatre, as well as a passion for original works.
Assistant Director Gabby Randle '09 also contributed to the
writing and directing process. The spectacle was amplified
by a series of stunning, ornate costumes and some of the
most impressive lighting effects I've seen in any perform
ance at Stanford.
While writing this review I've found that 500 words is
nowhere near enough space to address all of the concepts
and themes present in "The Waste Land in Black & White."
Members of the directorial team admitted that some of the
questions which arose during the rehearsal process
remained unanswered in the final performance. Without
the background provided by the cast, many of the subtleties
of the show would have been lost on me.
"The Wasteland in Black & White" set an ambitious
precedent for the season, though part of me hopes that pro
ductions to follow from The Waste Land Project will be
slightly more accessible to a wider audience.
