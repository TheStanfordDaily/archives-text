AROUND THE PAC-10
%1. USC (8-1, 6-1 Pac-10) W 1 7-3 v. California
The No. 6 Trojans dominated defensively, holding No. 21 Cal to just 165 total
yards and three points.
r 2. Oregon (7-3, 5-2 Pac-10) W 35-28 v. Stanford
J The game against the Cardinal very easily could have gone the other way, but
V J. ■ ultimately the strength of Oregon's run game prevailed.
S? 3. California (6-3, 4-2 Pac-10) L 1 7-3 v. USC
Cal's loss to USC was predictable, but the utter hopelessness of the Bears'
offense drops them down a spot in the rankings.
4. Oregon State (6-3, 5-1 Pac-10) W 34-6 v. UCLA
jfaM The Beavers are really rolling late, just as Jim Harbaugh predicted they would
after Stanford handed them their lone Pac-10 loss to start the year.
5 - Arizona (6-3, 4-2 Pac-10) W 59-28 v. Washington State
Now that conference cupcake WSU is out of the way, the 'Cats can move on to
real challenges — at Oregon and versus OSU in the next two weeks.
S6. Stanford (5-5, 4-3 Pac-10) L 35-28 v. Oregon
Another heartbreaker, which could make this year's Big Game the biggest in a
long while if USC, as expected, wins Saturday.
7. Arizona State (3-6, 2-4 Pac-10) W 39-19 v. Washington
Winning against Washington at this point definitely falls under the category of too
little, too late for the Sun Devils.
UCLA (3-6, 2-4 Pac-10) L 34-6 v. Oregon State
The Bruins only managed a pair of field goals and were 2-14 on third-down con
££ss3o versions against OSU.
9. Washington (0-9,0-6 Pac-10) L 39-19 v. Arizona State
This is a team that you really wouldn't have expected to be winless at this point,
but injuries have truly crippled the Huskies.
10. Washington State (1-9,0-7 Pac-10) L 59-28 v. Arizona
AM , More of the same from the conference's worst team.
