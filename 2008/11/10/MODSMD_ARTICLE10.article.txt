Flie fire safety system on a brand-new Russian nuclear sub
marine accidentally turned on as the sub was being tested in the
Sea of Japan, spewing a gas that suffocated 20 people and sent
21 others to the hospital, officials said Sunday.
Ihe Russian Navy said the submarine itself was not damaged
in Saturday s accident and returned to its base on Russia's Pa
cific coast under its own power Sunday. The accident also did
not pose any radiation danger, the navy said.
Yet it was Russia's worst naval accident since torpedo explo
sions sank another nuclear-powered submarine, the Kursk, in
the Barents Sea in 2000, killing all 118 seamen aboard.
Overcrowding may have been a significant factor on Satur
day.
The submarine being tested had 208 people aboard, includ
ing 81 seamen, according to Russian navy spokesman Capt. Igor
Dygalo. Yet Russian news agencies said a sub of this type nor
mally carries only a crew of 73.
"A submarine is the most vulnerable during trials. With both
navy and civilian personnel on board, it's very dificult to keep
such a large number of people organized." Gennady Illarionov,
a retired submarine officer, told the RIA Novosti news agency.
1 he victims suffocated after the submarine's fire-extinguish
ing system released Freon gas, said Vladimir Markin.an official
with Russia s top investigative agency. He said forensic tests
found Freon in the victims' lungs.
Seventeen civilians and three seamen died in the accident
and 21 others were hospitalized after being evacuated to shore,
Dygalo said, adding that none of the injuries were life-threaten
ing.
'Ihe submarines nuclear reactor was operating normally
and radiation levels were normal." Dygalo said, explaining that
the accident affected two sections of the submarine closest to
the bow.
Markin s agency, the Investigative Committee under the
Prosecutor General s office, has launched a probe into the acci
dent, which he said will focus on what activated the firefighting
system and possible violations of submarine operating rules.
Lev Fyodorov,a top Russian chemical expert.agreed that the
Freon pushed oxygen out, causing those inside to die of suffoca
tion. Hut he wondered why the individual breathing kits that
everyone on board is supposed to have did not keep people
from dying.
"People on board the sub may have failed to use their
breathing equipment when they found themselves in an emer
gency," he told the A P.
Igor Kurdin.a retired navy officer who heads an association
of former submariners, told Ekho Moskvy radio that the high
death toll probably resulted from shipyard workers who lacked
experience in dealing with the breathing kits.
A siren warning the crew that the firefighting system was
turning on also may have failed, RIA Novosti quoted an
unidentified navy official as saying, so those on board might not
have realized that Freon was being released until it was too late.
