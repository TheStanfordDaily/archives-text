## Gumball Challenge hits campus 13 teams participate, raise $1,200 total 
### MARISA LANDICHO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last week, teams of Stanford stu
dents were given 27 gumballs. 27
dollars and free rein of the campus
for a one-week fundraising blitz
known as The Gumball Challenge.
. In its second year,The Challenge
pitted 13 teams against one another
and raised over $1,200 dollars to be
donated to Kiva. a micro-lending
organization that funds social entre
preneurs across the globe.
Melanie Edwards, a professor of
social entrepreneurship who
addressed the teams during the clos
ing ceremonies on Sunday, pointed
out that it was possible to generate
change while making money.
"We're real believers that you
can do well, you can make money
and you can still have really great
social impact at the same time," she
said.
The goal of The Gumball
Challenge was to raise money and
awareness of microfinance, which
involves small loans given directly to
the working poor in developing
countries. The number 27 was
inspired by 2006 Nobel Peace Prize
winner Muhammad Yunus. whose

initial loan of $27 started a cyclical
lending process and evolved into the
Grameen Bank, which grew to help
over live million poor women.
With only one week to turn gum
halls into gold, teams churned out
ideas and quickly implemented their
various money-making schemes.
Sophomores Maddie Duhon,
Whitney Liehr, Biju Obi and
Stephanie Marcy formed "Team
Trash for Cash" and canvassed
dorms door-to-door, operating as
both garbage collectors and agents
spreading the message of microfi
nance.
"We just asked if people wanted
their trash taken out for a small
donation." Duhon said.
Ultimately, Team Trash for Cash
raised the most money of all teams
— over $390.
While Tuesday's election made it
difficult for some teams to carry out
their plans, one team took advan
tage of the timing and used the pres
idential election as inspiration for
their efforts. On Tuesday, "Team
Burbank Love" organized a "Cream
the Candidates" event where partic
ipants paid two dollars to throw a
whipped-cream pie at their choice of
mock presidential or vice presiden
tial candidate.
Team Burbank love's planners
Philippe De Koning '10, Victoria
Fischman '12 and Kelsey Davidson
'12 rallied over 30 dorm-mates to

help out and even volunteer to have
pies thrown at them by overzealous
election-watchers in White Plaza
and at the CoHo. Their team raised
$202 through both Cream the
Candidates and a dorm-wide ping
pong tournament, earning them the
prize for biggest risk takers.
Prizes for best microfinance
advocate and most innovative went
to teams "Los Elefantes" and "Blue
Barracudas" respectively, both com
prised of freshmen from Larkin in
Stern Hall. Los Elefantes raised
over $200 through a dorm assassins
game, while Blue Barracudas raised
$330 through a date auction and an
application essay review service for
high-school students.
However, not all teams managed
to pull off their schemes quite
according to plan. Team "Donner
Love" was thwarted by the weather
when their plan to sell Gatorade at
intramural games was washed away
by rain. Eventually, through some
last-minute efforts, the team man
aged to raise $13.
A few other teams dropped out
throughout the week due to lack of
time.
"Everyone has their own road
blocks," said Gumball Challenge
Director Nick Noone '10. "There are
successes and there are some ideas
that had a rough go. but overall I'm
excited."
Noone. who also coordinates

challenges at other universities
through Gumball Capital, said he
hoped to see The Gumball
Challenge become a campus-wide
event in the future.
All participating teams were
enthusiastic about this year's com
petition— and eager to participate
again next year.
"I had the Sarah Palin mask, and
I think overall in the whole day. 1 got
50 pies thrown at me," De Koning
said. "I'll also never forget the fact
that when Obama won. I was cov
ered in whipped cream. It's some of
the most fun I've had at Stanford."
