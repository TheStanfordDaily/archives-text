## Housing installs solar water heaters Robinson and Adams first to receive heaters 
### ELLIOTT JIN 
Two Stanford dorms will soon
become test sites for green technolo
gy when the Stanford Solar and
Wind Energy Project (SWEP)
installs solar-powered water heaters
in Robinson and Adams.
The pilot project will reduce these
dorms' carbon footprints while gath
ering valuable data for future sus
tainability projects.
Mike Dvorak, doctoral student
and vice president of SWEP, said a
visit to China inspired the project.
"In a field trip to China in 2(M)f>.
we noticed solar water heaters were
everywhere," he said. "A family of
two to three could buy all their water
heating for the next 15-20 years for
about $250, and we asked why these
aren't used in the U.S."
SWEP worked with Professor
Emeritus of Civil and Environmental
Engineering (iil Masters to test the
Chinese water heaters, and found
them highly effective.
"Last winter, we installed this
Chinese solar water heater that I had
purchased with my own funds, and
we tested it with (iil Masters in his

renewable energy lab," Dvorak said.
"We found that the efficiency of the
units was actually really good, much
better than conventional American
made solar water heaters."
After these encouraging lab
results. SWEP looked toward field
testing the systems on Stanford's
dorms.
"SWEP organized people from
Utilities and Housing, and lobbied
Stanford to build two different types
of solar water heating." Dvorak said.
" ITie system on Robinson is the con
ventional American type, and it's a
high-quality, high-performance sys
tem. The Chinese system still hasn't
got a building permit, but that's
probably going to he installed within
the next month in Adams."
Although the system on
Robinson is already installed and
heating water, installation of the sys
tem on Adams is still awaiting
approval. In an email to The Daily.
Alicia Restrepo. assistant director of
1 lousing for planned and sustainabil
ity projects, explained why a building
permit had not yet been issued.
"The County of Santa Clara,
which issues permits for the installa
tion. is researching it and will deter
mine what kind of certification is
needed to operate it." she said.
"Stanford Housing hopes we will be
able to bring it online in the next
couple of months."

Stanford I lousing has been work
ing with SWEP for the past year, and
wholly supports the project.
Executive Director of Housing
Rodger Whitney told The Daily that
the administration valued the part
nership with environmental engi
neering students. Whitney also
mentioned Stanford's dedication to
sustainability.
"The notion of reducing our
dependence on traditional energy
models is very important," he wrote
in an email. "If we can modestly
improve in that arena, it's worth it."
In addition, the administration is
enthusiastic about the project's edu
cational benefits.
"We are very excited we are able
to turn a design idea into an actual
project that will benefit not only the
residents, but also the students in the
classroom as they learn about creat
ing new ideas and implementing
them," Restrepo wrote.
According to Whitney, Housing
has supported many sustainability
initiatives and is eager to continue
doing so in the future.
"We will continue to pilot new
ideas that have strong merit that can
be implemented to the benefit of all
our residences." he said, "[and] work
hard on all fronts of sustainability."
