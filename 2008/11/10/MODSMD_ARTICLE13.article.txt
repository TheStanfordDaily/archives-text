## Scholars discuss federal tax gap Approximately $345 billion lost annually 
### THOMAS YEH 
Some scholars refer to it simply
as cheating, but the official term
for it is non-compliance, or tax eva
sion. The result is the federal tax
gap — an estimated $345 billion
lost annually in the difference
between what individuals are sup
posed to owe in taxes and what
they actually pay.
Last Saturday, Stanford Law &
Policy Review (SLPR) sponsored
"Closing the Tax Gap" to discuss
the problem of tax evasion.
Leading scholars, policymakers
and practitioners convened in a
number of panel discussions to talk
extensively about the underlying
issues of non-compliance.
In his opening remarks.
Stanford Law Professor Joseph
Bankman emphasized the impor
tance of dialogue as key to devel
oping a plan to combat non-com
pliance.
"We from academia can call on
you to get perspective," Bankman
said to the panelists who repre
sented government offices. "And
that can get all of us started on a
path toward solving this problem."
Each panel was modeled after a
published research paper written
on the same subject, which provid
ed a wide range of topics, ranging
from the relationship between lax
evasion and income distribution to
proposals for the new administra
tion. The panel topics were careful

ly chosen by the organizers of the
event — second-year law students
and editors of SLPR Shira Pinnas
and Oh-Yoon Kim.
"The members of SLPR vote
every year on what topic we want
to address" Pinnas said. "The tax
gap is an important issue and an
area of policy that everyone can
agree on. It's not something divi
sive. It's about people who should
be paying taxes that aren't."
One of the keynote speakers.
Nathan Hochman, assistant attor
ney general of the tax division in
the Department of Justice, stressed
the importance of building
increased public awareness.
"We want to reward the people
who want to do it right, and deter
and punish the ones who don't...
as loudly as possible." Hochman
said. "Our goal both currently and
for the future is to promote and
leverage every civil and criminal
case we have."
Nina Olson, the national tax
payer advocate of the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS), delivered
the second keynote of the day. She
agreed with Hochman and advo
cated specificity and measured pol
icy implementation that caters to
different subsets of non-compliers.
"II we continue to talk in broad
strokes, we will not get anywhere,"
Olson said.
In a paper entitled "Cash
Business and Tax Evasion." co
written with Susan Morse and
Stewart Karlinsky, Bankman
established that the tax gap stems
largely from small cash businesses,
the owners of which consistently

under-report income. According to
the paper, these small businesses
contribute to roughly half of all eva
sion. The goal of the panels, then,
was to understand the mindset
behind this behavior, and in doing
so, to attempt to form a solution
accordingly.
"It's not that they don't like the
government. It's not that they think
it's unfair. It's not that they think
the process is too difficult," Morse
pointed out in her panel. "Rather,
the current statutes [are] not consis
tent with the behavior of their
friends and families ... [which has]
established itself as a social norm.
Rather, it is about opportunity.
They don't believe there's any
chance they will get caught."
Discussion about specific solu
tions and proposals for the next
administration generated much
participation from the audience,
touching on the need for increased
visibility, for enforcement on a local
level and for efforts to simplify the
taxpayer's paperwork.
For attendee Virginia Stene, an
administrator from the State of
California Employment
Development Department who is
currently working on a report
specifically on payroll tax evasion,
this was important advice.
"Especially now after the recent
election, I wanted to get an update
on the current information that's
out there about my issue," Stene
said. "I want to know how budgets
will be affected."
