## Editorial Defeating Prop. 8 requires coming together 
### 
There were few dry eyes around the na
tion as the election results began to
roll in last Tuesday night. Some peo
ple wept out of pure excitement for the elec
tion of our first black president, while other
tears were shed as Senator John McCain
conceded.
Perhaps even more people cried in shock
and disbelief as several anti-gay initiatives
were passed in Florida, Arizona, Arkansas
and California, where Proposition 8 banned
same-sex marriage. Once the tears finally
dried and results were finalized, many Prop.
8 opponents tried to decide who was to
blame for the initiative's passing. In many of
our classes, on our email lists and during
one-on-one conversations, the finger was
pointed at various minority groups and peo
ple of faith.
The editorial board remains firm in its
denouncement of Prop. 8, for its fundamen
tally discriminatory nature. In that same
vein, the editorial board also urges the stu
dent body to denounce and rise above the
line of attacks that have been put forth in
this past week. We must begin the process of
moving forward. Scapegoating and making
ad hominem attacks on the people and com
munities who supported Prop. 8 have no
place in our student body. Many people of
color and people with strong religious ties
chose to stand up for equality on Nov. 4. So
instead of alienating those who went against
their religious leaders to speak out against
discrimination, we should find ways to stay
united and push forward for change in the
hearts and minds of those who supported
the initiative.
The "Obama Effect" theory, which sug
gests that the higher turnout of African-
American voters led to the passing of Prop.
8, was ultimately overemphasized. Data
provided by the Los Angeles Times suggests
that the proposition still would have passed
had its African-American backers chosen
not to vote. People of all colors and all faiths
voted in favor of Prop. 8, and in many of the
inland counties that voted overwhelmingly
in favor of the measure, one would be hard
pressed to find an African-American.
Finding someone to blame does not turn
back the hand of time, nor does it give back
the rights that were lost.The numbers game

ultimately alienates the numerous members
of targeted religious and ethnic groups who
came out against Prop. 8. It draws a unnec
essary line in the sand between disenfran
chised groups, leaving many Americans
who find themselves both Latino and Queer
or Black and Queer or Christian and Queer
to fall between the cracks. Instead of bring
ing communities together, it pulls us further
apart.
The numbers that really matter are the
ones that shine light on how far LGBT
rights have come in the past two decades.
Just 20 years ago, gay marriage didn't seem
like a viable option for many members of
the LGBT community. In recent years,
when marriage propositions similar to Prop.
8 were put forth, they passed with over
whelming support. In 2000, when Prop. 22
imposed a statutory ban on gay marriage in
California, the measure won by a 22-point
margin.
We have come a long way in such a short
amount of time.The 48 percent of the voting
population who opposed a ban on gay mar
riage are an inspiration. Rhetoric stating
that we have set the movement back 20
years belittles what progress we have made.
Unfortunately, change does not come
overnight in America, and as we have
learned from President-elect Barack
Obama.'We have more work to do." At this
rate, we can expect and hope that Prop. 8
will be an outdated and out-of-touch meas
ure 20 years from now.
Rallies like the one in the Intersection of
Death following the election are steps in the
right direction.They continue to inspire stu
dents and help those who opposed Prop. 8
remember that the battle is not over. Prop. 8
opponents must continue to energize peo
ple who continue to stand for equality, while
also working with those who supported
Prop. 8. If you are unhappy with the results
of this year's election, plug yourself into the
cause as the Stanford community continues
to do its part to raise awareness, end apathy
and push forward with the legislative fight.
Prop. 8 is not the end of the road: it is just
another hurdle in the journey towards
equality. We should keep our heads up,
reach out to each other and continue build
ing a better, more equal, California.
