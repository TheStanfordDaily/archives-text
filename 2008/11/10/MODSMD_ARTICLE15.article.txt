# Steal This Column
## A 						retroactive diary of Election Night 
### 
They don't call me the Bill Simmons
of The Daily for nothing. In fact,
they don't call me the Bill Simmons
of The Daily at all. Regardless, in the spir
it of the nation's second-most popular
syndicated columnist (behind only our
very own Stuart Baimel of "Stu's Views"
fame), I give to you Election Night: a run
ning diary.
6:45 p.m.: At my parents' house in
Atherton, just wrapping up dinner. Our
eyes are glued to CNN. Master of Cere
monies Herr Blitzer sings the praises of
CNN's new hologram technology, in
which they beam random celebrities with
no political insight into the studio. I keep
my hands firmly placed on either side of
my head to keep it from exploding.
7 p.m.: CNN announces that Virginia
is too close to call. With Pennsylvania
and Ohio already firmly in Obama's
grasp, McCain's road to the White House
is all but a dead end. My father is giddy.
Every few minutes he demands we
switch over to FoX News, just to look at
how long Brit Hume's face can get. I
haven't seen my father like this since the
Giants won the pennant in 2002. My
mother is cautiously optimistic, but her
eyes are gleaming.
7:16 p.m.: I say goodbye to my parents
and race into the CoHo for the free beer
and nachos (incidentally, they are also
showing election coverage). The place is
already packed, and the good cheer is
freely flowing, not to mention the alco
hol. I meet up with several friends,
Obama-philes all. A fervent pro-hope
bias seems to be rapidly taking hold.
7:32 p.m.: will.i.am just got beamed
into the CNN studios to give his two
cents. I frantically search for a latch that
leads to the basement of the CoHo,
where I will be safe from the imminent
apocalypse.
7:58 p.m.: Anticipation fills the air. At
long last, we hear the call: Virginia for
Obama! The packed CoHo goes ballistic.
CNN cuts away to the scene at Grant
Park in Chicago, where approximately
400 trillion people are ready to celebrate.
CNN shows a countdown to polls clos
ing on the West Coast. Everyone sponta

neously joins in the countdown: "8 ... 7 .
.. 6... " I announce that a countdown
makes no sense, because it will take CNN
at least 15 more minutes to announce
California ...
8 p.m.: ... Or not! With zero percent
of the precincts reporting. CNN projects
California will go blue.
We have our new President of the
United States, and his name is Barack
Obama.
8:01 p.m.:"Yes We Did! Yes We Did!"
8:02 p.m.: I find my buddy Jake on the
other side of the room, and we watch Mc-
Cain give a gracious concession speech.
With his marked change in tone, we de
cide it's probably the first time in months
that he has been in control of his own
image.
Minutes later, CNN goes back to
Grant Park for Obama's speech. Who
couldn't be affected by one Jesse Jackson
standing among the faithful in Chicago,
an American flag in his left hand, tears
streaming down his face?
I see my friend Fadi. with whom I had
just the day before argued our different
views on the Middle East conflict in my
"Gandhi and Nonviolence" class.
"You were for Obama?" I ask.
"Yes," he answers.
"I am very happy tonight." We hug.
9:15 p.m.: My night is just beginning.
Someone (even if 1 knew who, I wouldn't
tell you) announces that there will be a
bonfire in the Main Ouad. When the
flammables arrive at the quad, the 75
people who are already there rejoice. The
Barack O'Bonfire commences.
9:43 p.m.: Two shirtless guys with gui
tars lead the hundreds who have gath
ered around the fire in patriotic songs. I

invent a dance. Nobody notices.
Meanwhile, the fire is dying. In a show
of selfless sacrifice. I rip off my shirt and
triumphantly raise it into the air. The
crowd erupts as I announce my intention
to restart the fire by burning my shirt.The
cheering ceases when they realize I am
not a woman.
I throw my shirt into the fire.The shirt
does not catch. I am ashamed. A moment
later, I decide I don't care. I am happy
again.
After nearly two hours of revelry, Joe
the Firefighter arrives and we disperse.
After one final cheer, my friends and I
head to Casa Italiana.
Back at Casa, Jake grabs his ukulele
from his room and hands me a guitar.The
two of us lead several foxy ladies to the
balcony, where we serenade them with
songs of love (for our country).
12:30 a.m.: A few folks who have just
participated in an illegal activity ask if I
would like to take them to In-N-Out. You
know, to celebrate. I agree to drive. Jake
comes along.
12:59 a.m.: We made it! With nary a
moment to spare. Jake sprints in and or
ders a burger,"Obama style." We fall over
ourselves giggling. The woman behind
the counter says she voted for McCain.
She is not amused. In an attempt to save
face. Jake says,"l meant extra pickles."
I*he five of us discuss whether In-N-
Out could have come up with a better slo
gan than "Ouality You Can Taste." After
careful deliberation, we eventually de
cide on "Food You Can Eat."
1:45 a.m.: We arrive back on campus,
and I bid everyone adieu. Minutes later. I
reach my room, and go to cnn.coni to
make sure that Tuesday, N0v.4,200N actu
ally happened. I watch Obama's speech
once more.
I fall asleep a happy man. One day
won't reverse The Bush Tragedy. But we
are off to a good start.
