## Allysia Finley An elegy for McCain and the GOP 
### 
Good riddance.The 2(X)8 election is finally over,
but it seems that the 2012 election is just gear
ing up. Republicans are already focusing on re
vamping their message and image, though it might be
better to build anew than to try remodeling their shaky
structure. As Lincoln once said. "A house divided
against itself cannot stand." ITie GOP doesn't need a
new facade; it needs a new framework. It needs to get
back to the fundamentals of limited government,
whieh have all but gone out the window in the last
eight years.
While John McCain benefited from GOPdivisions
in the primary, his campaign collapsed under them in
the general election.The backbiting termites infiltrat
ed his campaign and ate away at his integrity. Like the
Republican Party. McCain lost his message. He lost his
focus. He lost himself. Somewhere along the way. he
forgot who John McCain was. I le became an embodi
ment of Rudy Giuliani. Mitt Romneyand Mike I luck
abee— the lion, the tin man and the scarecrow. He
lost his heart,courage and brain. He became a typical
Republican politician trying to appeal to every corner
of the big tent. But that's just no longer possible. The
tent's tcx) big. It's ready to burst.
McCain tried to unite the various factions by pro
claiming "Country First" — but he was capsized by a
campaign staff whose motto was "Me First." He select
ed a fierce Alaskan beauty queen as his vice president,
but soon learned that two mavericks are not better
than one.To borrow Jimi Hendrix's words, Sarah Palin
wasa"wild thing." And wild things don't like to be con
fined by campaigns or questions. As a wild thing him
self, McCain should have realized that.
As polling numbers sank and then settled,advisers
of the two wild things got embroiled in a catfight over
who was to blame. Both came out looking ugly. They
should have realized that beforehand. Didn't they
ever watch the movie "Mean Girls?"
Barack Obama won in part because he capitalized
on Americans' cynicism and contempt for politics. Mc-
Cain tried to run on a platform of reform, but that be
came difficult when he selected as his running mate
Sarah Palin, who as governor had requested nearly
$197.8 million in earmarks and was embroiled in her
own alleged ethics scandal. Then frugality went com
pletely out the window when the media reported that
the Republican National Committee budgeted
$150.(XX) for Palin's wardrobe. What happened to the
party of fiscal discipline?
I would like to say that the GOP will be stronger
and more united in four years, but I doubt it. It's going
to take time to regroup, and unfortunately, Republi
cans seem to be particularly dense. They just don't get

it. Die midterm 2(X)6 elections were a wake-upcall.hut
they didn't seem to heed the warning that people were
growing tired of big government and run away spend
ing.Their solution: expand government even more. As
a result, they lost six more Senate and l l > I louse seats.
I wonder if they will wake up now or whether it will
take a Democratic filibuster-proof majority in 2010 to
do the trick.
By the end of the election, even conservative com
mentators like George Will. Peggy Noonan and David
Brooks were fed up with the Republican ticket. Other
conservatives like Ann Coulter put on a happy face to
keep up appearances. For the far-right ideologues, par
tisanship trumped principles.
But if most conservatives were honest with them
selves, they'd admit that they voted for McCain only be
cause they didn't like Obama — his party, policies or
persona. Iliey chose the better of"twoevil&"They trust
ed a man who knew nothing about the economy more
than a man who knew nothing about the economy or
foreign policy.They trusted a man who once appeared
to have integrity over a man who demonstrated a lack
of integrity. They trusted a man who was after their
hearts more than a man who was after their wallets.
Indeed, some conservatives like Colin Powell de
fected to the Obama camp. Washington Post colum
nist Robert Novak dubbed these "Obamacans." A
middle-level official in the George I I.W. Bush and the
Reagan administration Bruce Bartlett noted in an ar
ticle for the New Republic that Obamacans shared a
"disgust with a Republican Party that still does not see
how badly George W. Bush has misgoverned this
country." Obamacans didn't leave the GOP; the GOP
left them.
While McCain tried todistance himself from Bush,
he also found himself beholden to the President. He
could not denounce Bush without denouncing the
GOP, which provided much of his funding. The my
opia, secrecy and government excess that tainted the
Bush administration had tainted the GOP as well. As
a result. McCain's message came out muddled. The
Republican senator claimed to be running against the
government graft and excess that Republicans helped
create. This just didn't gel with voters. In contrast,
Obama's message of hope and change, however spe
cious it may be, stood out more for its coherency and
consistency than for its oratory.
In sum, Palin's interview with Katie Couric provid
ed a good metaphor for the GOP: Off-point, disjoint
ed and incoherent.
