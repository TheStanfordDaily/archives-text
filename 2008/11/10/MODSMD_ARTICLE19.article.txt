## CEO talks online study guide 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
Shmoop, a Silicon Valley startup
aimed at streamlining the studying
process for high-school and college
students, recently launched its beta
version. Founder and CEO Ellen
Siminoff MBA '93, a member of the
executive board of Yahoo!, spoke to
The Daily about her inspiration
behind the Web site.
The site currently features study
guides and outlines to assist students
in literature, history and poetry.
"Our idea here with Shmoop is to
make learning a little bit more fun
and engaging," Siminoff said. "We
recognize that not everyone is going
to love literature and history, but we
think there are ways to make the
teaching process a lot more effective
such that the material is more acces
sible and we can at least help stu
dents get through it. so they don't
hate it."
The company is still in the growth
stage, expanding aggressively by
adding between five percent and 10
percent additional material per
week.
According to Siminoff. another
driving factor for the company's cre
ation was the gap in the educational
materials market created by exces
sively high textbook prices.
"Even when I was at Princeton

20 years ago, textbook prices were
way too high," she said, "and that is
probably something that most stu
dents in the Stanford community
can appreciate as well. Our Web site
is free."
Siminoff played a number of
roles at Yahoo! between 1996 and
2002, including head of business
development, head of corporate
development and head of the small
business and entertainment business
units, ultimately representing
approximately 25 percent of
Yahoo's revenue.
She is also chairman and former
CEO of Efficient Frontier, the
largest buyer of search advertising
keywords on Google and one of the
25 most valuable privately held
companies in the Silicon Valley, with
an estimated $275 million valuation.
In 2005, Forbes magazine named
Siminoff one of its Masters of
Information.
One of the most important les
sons Siminoff has learned in her
Silicon Valley career is the centrality
of innovation and adaptation to any
company's success.
"You always have to be cog
nizant of where the industry is
going, and that it is going to be
changing quickly," she said. "With
Shmoop. I go and talk to high-school
students [and] college students
about what thev want to see. about

what would help them. After all, the
company will only be successful if
we effectively cater to their needs."
Siminoff also emphasized her
belief in the importance of being
willing to take risks and act uncon
ventionally.
"When we founded Yahoo!, it
was just another startup company
with a funny-sounding name." she
said. "In fact, my boss told me when
I first got there that joining Yahoo!
was probably not going to hurt my
career, but it probably was not going
to help it. either. We didn't join
Yahoo! because we thought there
was going to be a huge IPO. We
joined because we thought it was
going to change the world, change
the way people communicated."
Siminoff attributed a significant
amount of the ultimate success of
her career's trajectory to her time at
Stanford, where she met her future
husband and business partner.
"When I was an undergraduate
at Princeton, I swore I was going
into investment banking." Siminoff
said. "But I came out here to
Stanford for business school, and
what can I say? I caught the entre
preneurial bug."
