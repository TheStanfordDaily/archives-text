## CARD WINS, AWAITS DRAW Stanford wraps up season with 3-0 win at Cal, NCAA tourney seeding tonight 
### NATE ADAMS 
The No. 6 Cardinal closed out the regular season with a
dominating victory over California on Saturday, improv
ing to 18-1-1 (8-1-0 Pacific-11) Conference) and earning
second place in the Pac-lO.The Golden Bears, playing in
their annual Senior Day game,fell to 10-8-1 (3-5-1 Pac-10),
and will learn on Monday evening if they have a place in
the upcoming NCAA tournament.
Junior forward Kelley O'Hara, in her second game hack
from injury, scored the first goal for the Cardinal, which
proved to be the game-winner in the 3-0 shutout. Sopho
more forward Christen Press provided added insurance,
scoring a pair of goals of her own.
The first half was a soggy and scoreless affair, with rain
coming down as hoth teams traded chances. Both goal
keepers — freshman Kira Maker for the Cardinal and sen
ior Rosie Aguilera for Cal — were forced to make three
saves in the half. As the players headed to the lockers. Stan
ford totaled nine shots.compared tojust four for the Bears
The rain was an obstacle for both teams, and may have
contributed to the low shot totals early. Freshman Teresa
Novola. though, said the Cardinal truly found its groove
regardless of the elements.

"We adjusted well
to the rain considering
we have played in nor
mal conditions all sea
son." Noyola said. "I
actually think the slick
field played to our
strengths, especially
our quick ball move
ment and flank speed."
As has often been
the case this season.
Stanford's offense
broke the game open
in the second half. Just
six minutes in. O'Hara
redirected an unusual
rebound into the lower
right corner of the net.
"It was an odd goal,
and I don't remember
exactly what hap
pened beforehand."
she said. "Basically, a
bouncing ball got
loose at the top of the
box and I just stepped
up and half-volleyed
it."

"We are
confident that
no team can
beat us when
we are at our
best."

freshman midfielder

It was her 11th goal
of the season, and gave
the Cardinal the only lead it would need. O'Hara. who had
three shots in the game, is rebounding from a concussion
she suffered last weekend in a practice prior to the game at
UCLA, hut says she feels completely fine now. She credits
her team and their style of play for her goal on Saturday.
"The whole team was playing awesome up until that
point.and I think that scoring three goals in the second half
is just a perfect example of how we are able to play our pos
session style and slowly break down teams." O'Hara said.
"1 think it gave us more confidence and opening up the
field a little, but before and after the goal we just continued
to play our style soccer."
The 'Cardinal style' was quick to produce again, as
Press was able to sneak a ball into the right side of the net.
Freshman midfielder Teresa Noyola. who had a game-high
five shots, was credited with the assist.
Following the two quick goals. California head coach
Neil McGuire decided to make a change at the goalkeep
er position, swapping Aguilera for junior Gina Pellegrini,
who has seen the most time in the net for Cal this season.
Press, however, proved that it didn't matter which
goalie she was up against when she scored Stanford's final
regular-season goal in the K4th minute. The effort was
scored as unassisted, but came off of a great passing se
quence between several players. Press was able to send a
