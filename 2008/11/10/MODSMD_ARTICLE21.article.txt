energy for an inevitable postseason
run.'liius. it seems they have decided to
stop losing games, period.
The No. 2 Cardinal (21-3,12-1 Pacif
ic-10 Conference) continued its stellar
play last weekend, sweeping two more
Pac-10 rivals in Arizona State and Ari
zona. With the weekend victories, along
with former conference leader Cal's
losses. Stanford has solidified its spot
atop the Pacific-10 and is clearly on the
path to finishing its regular season as
one of the nation's best teams.
The Sun Devils (12-13,3-9) became
the first victim of the weekend, al
though this sweep was far more difficult
for Stanford than expected.The visiting
Cardinal put away its opponents 25-23,
26-24, 25-20 despite allowing a whop
ping 25 kills from ASU sophomore
Sarah Reaves. Reaves accounted for
over 50 per-cent of her teams' kills
while hitting a staggering .558.

Cardinal Coach John Dunning com
mended Reaves for her play, but was
nonetheless impressed wilh his team's
ability to overcome such a strong per
formance.
"The first match at Arizona State
was actually a very tough match ". Dun
ning said. "One of their hitters just went
off and we could not stop her. I lowever.
I thought we played tough when we
needed to and we handled the situation
well."
Fortunately for Cardinal fans. Stan
ford was able to contain the rest of
Reaves* teammates,and provide ;i little
firepower of their own.
Cynthia Barbo/a and loluke Akin

Barboza padded her resume by adding
12 digs, pushing her above 1.100 for her
career and into ninth on Stanford's ca
reer digs list. Libero Gabby Ailcs also
contributed significantly, chipping in 15
digs on the night.
Stanford followed up its 20th win of
the season by marching into Wildcat

again stole the show. On the way to her

plishing." Dunning said. "She is very
high up on the aces list, the kills list,
and the digs list in Stanford history.
She certainly has an exciting part of
her career awaiting her at the end of
the season. She is one of those rare
players who plays the whole game,
and we are thrilled to have her."
Barboza finished with 10 kills on
the night. She was outperformed of
fensively by Akinradewo, who once
again had an impressive night offen

swings, creating even more problems
for opposing teams down the road.
Stanford has raised its profile on
the national level by performing at
such a high level over the past few
weeks. As a national standout, the
Cardinal possesses many qualities
envied by teams around the country.
"One of the things we obviously
have are some extraordinary play
ers," Dunning said. "Volleyball is a
sport where you can overcome a lot
by doing team things well. Chem
istry just really helps. 1 think we are
growing and improving in that area
every day, and it is really exciting
when your team can take problem
areas and keep getting better at
them."
The next step for the Cardinal is

avenging its loss to Cal earlier in the
season. Stanford travels to the home
of its Bay Area rival this weekend
with hopes of a different outcome.
Cal has been struggling of late, losing
the Pac-10 lead while dropping three
of its last five matches. The Cardinal
isn't taking anything for granted
though, after the Bears' win earlier
in the season.
"Our team knows how good they
are," Dunning said. "We are going to
have information about how we
played against them and them
against us. We are going to get really
prepared this week. We will be
