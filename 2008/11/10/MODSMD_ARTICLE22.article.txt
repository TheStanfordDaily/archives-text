Stanford was two minutes
away from its sixth win. two
minutes away from bowl eligi
bility, and two minutes away from
finally breaking through seven
seasons of mediocrity. And for
those two minutes, 1 intently re
freshed the box score only to see
the lead slowly slip out of Stan
ford's hands for the second time in
three games.
While a few die-hard fans might
have experienced the same jubila
tion and defeat over those two
minutes, most people probably
didn't even know that we were that
close until reading the recap. Most
people probably didn't know that
Stanford was on the verge of its
first bowl berth since 2001. Heck,
maybe a few didn't even know we
had a game this past Saturday.
I know, I know — you'll start
following the team closely once it
hits eight or nine wins, once it
makes it to a bowl game, once it be
comes an undeniably good team. It
may seem like a bandwagon men
tality. but judging by Stanford's at
tendance numbers this year, that's
probably exactly what's going on.
But after Saturday's close loss
to Oregon, that excuse won't work
anymore.
Stanford may be 5-5 overall and
4-3 in the Pac-10, but they easily
could have six or seven wins at this
point. After witnessing two final
minute losses to UCLA and Ore
gon, you can see that the team did
n't have the extra energy to close
out those games. And without the
complete backing of their fans,
who can blame them?
Granted, those key last minute
losses were road games, but it still
can't help that Stanford students,
on the whole, seem woefully unat
tached to the team's fate. When
leading rusher Toby Gerhart went
down with an upper hamstring in
jury, could you hear a collective
groan in the Cardinal Nation?
When Tavita Pritchard connected
with Doug Baldwin on fourth-and
two late in the fourth quarter, was
there a sigh of relief amongst the
Stanford fans? How about when


Anthony
Nguyen
Anthony Kimble recovered his
own fumble at the one-yard line to
take the lead for Stanford — did
cheers erupt across campus
lounges watching their team play?
Did anyone care at all?
Saturday's game in Eugene,
Ore. was gut-wrenching, jaw-drop
ping football, but the matchup
brought zero buzz to campus. In
fact, Sigma Nu's Moonsplash may
have gotten more people talking
than Saturday's game. And
frankly, the team deserves better,
Jim Harbaugh deserves better and
Stanford deserves better.
What Stanford needs is the full
backing of its fans, at home and
away. It needs fans to fill up the in
credible Stanford Stadium to ca
pacity. It needs its students to be
loyal to the team, to support Stan
ford in all of its endeavors on and
off the field. Stanford is no longer
some pushover laughingstock of a
team. The Cardinal has kept itself
in each game all season long and
has even managed to pull off a few
upsets. And isn't that exactly what
we all wanted in the first place?
With the loss, Stanford is down
to two games to capture its sixth
win of the season — two games
against Southern California and
Cal, perhaps the two toughest
squads in the Pac-10. After upset
ting both the Bears and Trojans last
year, you can bet that they will both

play with a chip on their shoulders
and will enter their games with the
Cardinal smelling blood.
After two emotionally draining
losses against UCLA and Oregon,
the Cardinal players need the fans
more than ever to pick them up
when they're down. Next week
end, USC comes into town, bring
ing hoards of Trojan fans into Car
dinal territory.
Don't let them take away
home-field advantage.
Show Stanford that you're
there for them through the good
and the bad, through the ups and
downs of a season. Give them the
extra burst of energy to pull out a
deciding sixth win.
And for the 111 th Big Game —
Stanford hasn't won back-to-back
Big Games since, you guessed it.
the 2001 season — come out to the
Big Game and cheer on the Cardi
nal in enemy territory. There are
no papers or midterms due the
next week, it's Thanksgiving so
there are no excuses. How sweet
would it be to keep the Axe and
earn a bowl berth in the same
game?
Stanford has the talent and
leadership to be a bowl team, as it
has proven this season. But if
we're to have any chance against
USC and Cal, the burden is no
longer on the team — it's on us as
fans to deliver when the program
needs us most.
