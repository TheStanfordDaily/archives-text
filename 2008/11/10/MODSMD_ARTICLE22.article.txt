Stanford was two minutes
away from its sixth win. two
minutes away from bowl eligi
bility, and two minutes away from
finally breaking through seven
seasons of mediocrity. And for
those two minutes, 1 intently re
freshed the box score only to see
the lead slowly slip out of Stan
ford's hands for the second time in
three games.
While a few die-hard fans might
have experienced the same jubila
tion and defeat over those two
minutes, most people probably
didn't even know that we were that
close until reading the recap. Most
people probably didn't know that
Stanford was on the verge of its
first bowl berth since 2001. Heck,
maybe a few didn't even know we
had a game this past Saturday.
I know, I know â€” you'll start
following the team closely once it
hits eight or nine wins, once it
makes it to a bowl game, once it be
comes an undeniably good team. It
may seem like a bandwagon men
tality. but judging by Stanford's at
tendance numbers this year, that's
probably exactly what's going on.
But after Saturday's close loss
to Oregon, that excuse won't work
anymore.
Stanford may be 5-5 overall and
4-3 in the Pac-10, but they easily
could have six or seven wins at this
point. After witnessing two final
minute losses to UCLA and Ore
gon, you can see that the team did
n't have the extra energy to close
out those games. And without the
complete backing of their fans,
who can blame them?
Granted, those key last minute
losses were road games, but it still
can't help that Stanford students,
on the whole, seem woefully unat
tached to the team's fate. When
leading rusher Toby Gerhart went
down with an upper hamstring in
jury, could you hear a collective
groan in the Cardinal Nation?
When Tavita Pritchard connected
with Doug Baldwin on fourth-and
two late in the fourth quarter, was
there a sigh of relief amongst the
Stanford fans? How about when
