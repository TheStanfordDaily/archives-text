## Close, but no bowl... yet 
### JACK SALISBURY DESK EDITOR 
"We're in complete control of our
destiny and that's a great place to
be," said linebacker Clinton Snyder,
before Stanford's game against Ore
gon this past Saturday.
The redshirt junior was referring
to the Cardinal's postseason hopes,
as the team needed only one win in
three games coming into this week
end to secure bowl eligibility.
And with two minutes left in the
game on Saturday, the same situa
tion applied for Snyder and the
Stanford defense: however, the Car
dinal apparently didn't have as much
control over its destiny as it would
have liked.
Stanford went blow-for-blow
with Oregon on Saturday, battling
the harsh weather and the hostile
crowd at Autzen Stadium to take a
one-point lead with just over two

minutes to go. The game would be
decided by a single drive, a single
match-up: the Cardinal defense
against the opposing offense.
It was a situation eerily similar to
the loss at UCLA three weeks ago.
And it had an eerily similar out
come.
What may have been most unset
tling about the Ducks' game-win
ning 76-yard drive was how easy it
was. They faced only two third
downs on the drive, both resulting in
big plays by tailback LaGarrette
Blount: one a 25-yard run.the other
the game-winning touchdown.
Despite fumbling the ball four
times earlier in the game. Oregon
worked its no-huddle spread offense
to perfection. The Ducks lacked
focus and were mistake-prone for
much of the game, but when it came
to the final two minutes, you could
sense that they were the ones in con
trol.

"There was a time when I felt like
we had the game won," said redshirt
junior quarterback Tavita Pritchard
to GoDucks.com. "I was confident in
our defense's ability to stop them,
but it wasn't our defense's fault. We
could have been better in all three
aspects of the game."
"We've been practicing our two
minute defense, especially after the
UCLA game." said redshirt junior
safety Bo McNally. "We tried to run
some stuff to contain them, but they
made a couple of big plays that real
ly hurt us.The quarterback scramble
really hurt. It's a big letdown. We feel
like we kind of let the team down."
Coach Jim Harbaugh wasn't
completely let down, however.
"I'm very proud of our guys"
Harbaugh said. "They overcame a
lot of adversity and showed great ef
fort all day long. They played physi
cal and hard."
ITiough Harbaugh's positive atti
tude is admirable and probably the
main reason behind Stanford's im
mense improvement these past two
seasons, the fact still remains: For the
second time in three games, the Car
dinal defense "controlled" its own
destiny in the game's final seconds.
And for the second time, the team's
desired destiny slipped through its
fingers.
The Cardinal was on the fringe of
winning two big Pac-10 games on the
road (UCLA and Oregon), and it's
still on the fringe of earning a bowl
bid.
"We were close." Pritchard said.
"We've been close a lot. We just have
to get over the hump."
With the way things have been de
veloping under Harbaugh, it seems
like it's only a matter of time before
the Cardinal gets over the hump. It's
a question of when, not if. But with
the transient nature of college foot
ball. nothing is guaranteed. As Stan
ford knows itself, the only thing the
team can do is leave everything on
the field these next two games.
Stanford may or may not control
its own destiny. The one thing it def
initely controls, though, is its ap
proach to the final two games of the
season — against two of the best
teams in the conference.
McNally, who was a part of Ihe
dark ages of Stanford football two
years ago. knows that the only way to
look is forward.
"This might be the most painful
loss we've had yet," he said, "but
we've got to move on quickly with
USC and California coming up."
