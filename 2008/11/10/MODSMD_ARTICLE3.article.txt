### KATE BARBER 
If you thought you heard screaming
and a gunshot coming from the Main
Quad on Saturday night, you heard
right. The mob scene was an act staged
by the Stanford Model United Nations
Conference (SMUNC) held on campus
over the weekend.
The conference was put on by the
Society for International Affairs at
Stanford, and hosted roughly 430 dele

"Ideally, the crisis format will allow
the delegates to gain insight into what's

them into the shoes of political leaders
of the past, present and future."
Under-Secretary General for Crisis
Peter Davis '11 said Stanford's confer

and many commonly cite it as the best
part of SMUNC," Davis said. "It has
become our trademark, and this year
has. without a doubt, surpassed even
the crises of the previous two years."
SMUNC staff was comprised of
members from the traveling MUN
team and many students from around
campus who are interested in interna
tional relations. Staff members agreed
that Stanford goes to great lengths to
provide creative crises for the high
school delegates to resolve.
"We expose delegates to situations
they don't expect," Brooke said. "We've
