# Model UN storms campus
## Approx. 430 high-schoolers participate 
### KATE BARBER 
If you thought you heard screaming
and a gunshot coming from the Main
Quad on Saturday night, you heard
right. The mob scene was an act staged
by the Stanford Model United Nations
Conference (SMUNC) held on campus
over the weekend.
The conference was put on by the
Society for International Affairs at
Stanford, and hosted roughly 430 dele
gates from 33 high schools around the
United States, Honduras and Canada.
"Most top universities put on a high
school [Model United Nations (MUN)]
conference, and this is ours." said Justin
Brooke '09. secretary general for
SMUNC. "The goal of the conference is
to expose students to a setting where
they can actively debate, discuss and
collaborate about international and
political issues."
Stanford's conference is unique
among its counterparts at other univer
sities because it is primarily made up of
small, crisis-focused committees. These
crisis committees revolve around

staged, unexpected incidents that inter
rupt the normal debate.
"Ideally, the crisis format will allow
the delegates to gain insight into what's
really happening," Brooke said. "It puts
them into the shoes of political leaders
of the past, present and future."
Under-Secretary General for Crisis
Peter Davis '11 said Stanford's confer
ence is noteworthy for its crisis focus.
"Crisis keeps delegates on their toes,
and many commonly cite it as the best
part of SMUNC," Davis said. "It has
become our trademark, and this year
has. without a doubt, surpassed even
the crises of the previous two years."
SMUNC staff was comprised of
members from the traveling MUN
team and many students from around
campus who are interested in interna
tional relations. Staff members agreed
that Stanford goes to great lengths to
provide creative crises for the high
school delegates to resolve.
"We expose delegates to situations
they don't expect," Brooke said. "We've

Hezbollah and a simulation of Israel
in the Six-Day War. The delegates
must think on the fly to solve all the
problems."
However, not all the delegates
were debating traditional MUN
subject matter. The Vatican
Conclave committee held its meet
ings in the dark and projected an
image of the Sistine Chapel on the
ceiling while debating the election
of a new Pope.
Rashida Haveliwala, a history
teacher at Oakland Aviation High
School, said she chose to bring her
students to SMUNC because of the
unique and intimate setting it pro
vides its delegates.
"This is the first time we've taken
students to Stanford," Haveliwala
said. "We chose this conference
because 1 heard they had small, spe
cialized committees which make it a
more effective learning environ
ment."
Adrienne Chiu. a senior at
Menlo School, enjoyed the events
she witnessed in the 1775 British
Parliament committee.

"We had the Boston Tea Party
and had to deal with that, and later
executed a member of the commit
tee for treason." Chiu said.
One of the more complex crises
involved the assassination of
President George W. Bush in the
United States Security Council by
the terrorist organization al-Qaeda.
SMUNC staff dressed as Secret
Service and terrorists, using ketchup
to imitate blood.
Davis said staff members found
creative ways to engage the dele
gates by making the crises exciting.
"Crisis staff members ran from
committee to committee imperson
ating everyone from Zimbabwe
President Mugabe to Roman
Legion Mithradades to former
Russian President Vladimir Putin."
Davis said. "For each mission, we
chose from a box of props that
included camouflage gear, a soviet
hat, ski masks, nylon panty hose,
swords, fake guns and much more."
Haveliwala said staged crises like
this are what make SMUNC a pow
erful learning experience.
"It's really inspiring." she said.
"It's an alternative way of learning
that makes the students have to
think at a higher level, more on the
spot."
Fortunately for the SMUNC
staff, no real crises occurred during
the conference.
"We're a little disappointed
about the rain, but based on feed

hack from staff and advisors, things
seem to be going quite well,"
Brooke said during the second night
of the conference.
Though some students com
plained of competitiveness among
delegates, most agreed that the con
ference was a positive experience.
"Everyone's really active" said
Sian Yuan, a senior at the Marker
School. "The crises happen really
suddenly, so they are very interest
ing."
In addition to learning and per
fecting public speaking skills, some
students made lasting friendships at
SMUNG
"I made quite a few friends at
SMUNC, and have kept in touch
with some from my first year." said
Todd Medema, a junior from
Oakdale.
The conference is a worthwhile
experience not only for the dele
gates. but also for the staff and sec
retariat.
"The most truly rewarding thing
is to see the kids come to the confer
ence and really enjov themselves."
Brooke said. "They get to debate,
talk to other kids and experience
the complex, nuanced situations we
put them in. whether they're on the
U.S. Security Council, the Vatican
Conclave or the Wal-Mart board of
directors."

Russian President Vladimir Putin."
Davis said. "For each mission, we
chose from a box of props that
included camouflage gear, a soviet
hat, ski masks, nylon panty hose,
swords, fake guns and much more."
Haveliwala said staged crises like
this are what make SMUNC a pow
erful learning experience.
"It's really inspiring." she said.
"It's an alternative way of learning
that makes the students have to
think at a higher level, more on the
spot."
Fortunately for the SMUNC
staff, no real crises occurred during
the conference.
"We're a little disappointed
about the rain, but based on feed

hack from staff and advisors, things
seem to be going quite well,"
Brooke said during the second night
of the conference.
Though some students com
plained of competitiveness among
delegates, most agreed that the con
ference was a positive experience.
"Everyone's really active" said
Sian Yuan, a senior at the Marker
School. "The crises happen really
suddenly, so they are very interest
ing."
In addition to learning and per
fecting public speaking skills, some
students made lasting friendships at
SMUNG
"I made quite a few friends at
SMUNC, and have kept in touch
with some from my first year." said
Todd Medema, a junior from
Oakdale.
The conference is a worthwhile
experience not only for the dele
gates. but also for the staff and sec
retariat.
"The most truly rewarding thing
is to see the kids come to the confer
ence and really enjov themselves."
Brooke said. "They get to debate,
talk to other kids and experience
the complex, nuanced situations we
put them in. whether they're on the
U.S. Security Council, the Vatican
Conclave or the Wal-Mart board of
directors."
