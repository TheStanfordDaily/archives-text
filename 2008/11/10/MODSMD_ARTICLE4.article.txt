# STANFORD 28 – OREGON 35
## ROLLER COASTER Card rallies to take lead, loses as Oregon scores in final seconds 
### DAVID LOMBARDI 
So close, and yet so far away.
Alter seeing another victory slip from
its grasp in the final seconds, the Stanford
football team (5-5, 4-3 Pacific-10
Conference) was forced to wait one more
week for another shot at becoming bowl
eligible for the first time since 2001.
Just three weeks after UCLA stunned
the Cardinal, 23-20 in an upset, come
from-behind victory, Oregon running
back LaGarrette Blount swept into the
end zone with six seconds remaining in

the fourth quarter to turn a 28-27
Stanford advantage into a 35-28 Duck
victory at Autzen Stadium in Eugene.
Ore. '
After Anthony Kimble recovered his
own fumble in the end zone to give
Stanford its first lead of the game with
2:18 remaining, Blount's run capped an
11-play. 74-yard Oregon touchdown drive
that shredded through the helpless
Cardinal defense. The Stanford "D" was
ineffective against Oregon (7-3. 5-2) all
day. allowing 451 yards — 307 on the
ground.

"I'm proud of the guvs, the way they
fought and the effort they gave," Stanford
coach Jim Harbaugh said. "We just didn't
finish the last drive on defense."
The Cardinal's last-minute breakdown
was reminiscent of the team's collapse on
Oct. IK at UCLA, when Bruins quarter
back Kevin Craft capped off a long scor

the decisive lead with just nine seconds
left. This Saturday, however. Stanford fell
even harder — and faster — at game's

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal is still looking for its sixth win
and a bowl bid after a tough loss at Oregon last week
end. USC has just one loss on the season, but Stanford
stunned the Trojans last season on the road. The game
will be the 100 th of USC head coach Pete Carroll's

who finished the game 11-21 for 144
yards passing, picked up nearly half of his
51 rushing yards on a devastating. 25-
yard scramble to the Stanford eight-yard
line on third-and-eight with less than a
minute to play. The Ducks didn't even
need to use a single one of their three
timeouts during their winning march
downfield. The Cardinal, on the other
hand, which had been forced to burn all
three of its timeouts earlier in the half
due to the disruptive Autzen Stadium
crowd noise, watched helplessly as the
Ducks ran out the clock prior to Blount's
winning score.
"You don't have to throw the ball
downfield right now. you've got a ton of
time, you've got three timeouts," Oregon
offensive coordinator Chip Kelly told
Masoli before the drive.
"And we did exactly what we do in
practice." he added.
Hie thrilling ending was just a part of
a wild game that saw six fumbles, a safety
and Jekyll-and-Hyde weather patterns
drifting from the occasional downpour to
flashes of brilliant sunlight. For much of
the afternoon, the Ducks' biggest enemy
was not the Stanford team, but rather
their own propensity to turn over the
football. Four Oregon fumbles allowed
Stanford to hang in the game, even
though the Ducks averaged an astonish
ing 7.5 yards per carry.
Although Kimble was solid in a 24-
carry, 106-yard performance and quarter
back Tavita Pritchard managed an effi
cient game heavily utilizing the play
action pass (going 15-22 for 138 yards),
the story of the day was Oregon's domi
nance up front. In a game between the
Pac-10's best rushing teams, it was the
Ducks' ground attack that stole the show.
Starting running back Jeremiah Johnson
finished with 15 carries for 135 yards,
while Blount rushed 10 times for 90 yards
and two scores.
"We feel like we let the team down."
said Stanford safety Bo McNally. "This is
going to be a hard one to get over, but
we've got to get over it fast. This might be
the most painful loss so far."


The Associated Press
Stanford seniors Wopamo Osoisai (6) and Kris Evans (24) can't bring down Jeremiah Johnson of Oregon as he scores a touchdown
n the first half. Oregon dominated Stanford on the ground, leaving the Cardinal still one win shy of a bowl bid.
Stanford's Toby Gerhart, who en
tered the game needing only 89 rush
ing yards to become Stanford's first
1000-yard back since Tommy Vardell
in 1991, finished with only eight car
ries for 21 yards after straining his
upper right hamstring in the first
quarter.
The game started disastrously for
Stanford when Chris Owusu fum
bled the opening kickoff deep in
Cardinal territory. That set up Ore
gon kicker Flint Morgan, whose 37-
vard field goal gave the Ducks a 3-0
lead.
A tew plays later. Masoli hooked
up with Jeff Maehl for a five-yard
touchdown that capped a two-play,
50-yard drive that was highlighted by
Drew Davis' explosive 45-yard bub
ble screen catch-and-run. The game
was barely three minutes old, but
Oregon already led 10-0. A 41-yard
Jeremiah Johnson touchdown run
gave the Ducks their largest lead of
the game at 17-3 with 2:09 remaining
in the first quarter.
The Cardinal, however, struck
back with 14 unanswered points to
tie the game. A five-yard touchdown
catch from Pritchard to fullback Josh
Catron cut the lead in half. Then, on
fourth-and-goal from the Oregon
five. Stanford faked a field goal.
Holder Bo McNallv kept the snap
and took it to the end zone for the
equalizing score.
The teams then traded field goals,
while Oregon made a habit of fum
bling the football, before Blount
ripped off a 38-yard touchdown run
to give the Ducks a 27-20 lead with
5:33 remaining in the third quarter.
Hiree Oregon second-half fumbles
allowed Stanford to stick around as
the fourth quarter wore on.Then, on
third down from the Oregon three
yard line with 8:41 to play, center
Max Unger's snap sailed over the
head of Masoli and out of the end
zone for a safety that cut the lead to
27-22.
The Cardinal then took the ball 65
yards in 10 plays to set up Kimble's
go-ahead score. The drive, which
chewed up 6:23 of clock, featured a
clutch, nine-yard completion from
Pritchard to Doug Baldwin on a
fourth-and-two. It ended when Kim
ble fumbled into the end zone but

was able to recover the ball for the
touchdown just before it went out of
bounds. The Cardinal failed to con
vert the two-point conversion, set
ting up Oregon's game-winning
drive.
Stanford has two more shots to
become bowl-eligible for the first
time since 2001: next week at home
against Pac-10 heavyweight USC
and Nov. 22 at archrival California.
"We've been close a lot of times
and now we've just got to get over
the hump," Pritchard said. "We've
just got to finish."

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal is still looking for its sixth win
and a bowl bid after a tough loss at Oregon last week

stunned the Trojans last season on the road. The game
will be the 100 th of USC head coach Pete Carroll's
career at the helm of the Trojans.

who finished the game 11-21 for 144
yards passing, picked up nearly half of his
51 rushing yards on a devastating. 25-
yard scramble to the Stanford eight-yard
line on third-and-eight with less than a
minute to play. The Ducks didn't even
need to use a single one of their three
timeouts during their winning march
downfield. The Cardinal, on the other
hand, which had been forced to burn all
three of its timeouts earlier in the half
due to the disruptive Autzen Stadium
crowd noise, watched helplessly as the
Ducks ran out the clock prior to Blount's
winning score.
"You don't have to throw the ball
downfield right now. you've got a ton of
time, you've got three timeouts," Oregon
offensive coordinator Chip Kelly told
Masoli before the drive.
"And we did exactly what we do in
practice." he added.
Hie thrilling ending was just a part of
a wild game that saw six fumbles, a safety
and Jekyll-and-Hyde weather patterns
drifting from the occasional downpour to
flashes of brilliant sunlight. For much of
the afternoon, the Ducks' biggest enemy
was not the Stanford team, but rather
their own propensity to turn over the
football. Four Oregon fumbles allowed
Stanford to hang in the game, even
though the Ducks averaged an astonish
ing 7.5 yards per carry.
Although Kimble was solid in a 24-
carry, 106-yard performance and quarter
back Tavita Pritchard managed an effi
cient game heavily utilizing the play
action pass (going 15-22 for 138 yards),
the story of the day was Oregon's domi
nance up front. In a game between the
Pac-10's best rushing teams, it was the
Ducks' ground attack that stole the show.
Starting running back Jeremiah Johnson
finished with 15 carries for 135 yards,
while Blount rushed 10 times for 90 yards
and two scores.
"We feel like we let the team down."
said Stanford safety Bo McNally. "This is
going to be a hard one to get over, but
we've got to get over it fast. This might be
the most painful loss so far."


The Associated Press
Stanford seniors Wopamo Osoisai (6) and Kris Evans (24) can't bring down Jeremiah Johnson of Oregon as he scores a touchdown
n the first half. Oregon dominated Stanford on the ground, leaving the Cardinal still one win shy of a bowl bid.
Stanford's Toby Gerhart, who en
tered the game needing only 89 rush
ing yards to become Stanford's first
1000-yard back since Tommy Vardell
in 1991, finished with only eight car
ries for 21 yards after straining his
upper right hamstring in the first
quarter.
The game started disastrously for
Stanford when Chris Owusu fum
bled the opening kickoff deep in
Cardinal territory. That set up Ore
gon kicker Flint Morgan, whose 37-
vard field goal gave the Ducks a 3-0
lead.
A tew plays later. Masoli hooked
up with Jeff Maehl for a five-yard
touchdown that capped a two-play,
50-yard drive that was highlighted by
Drew Davis' explosive 45-yard bub
ble screen catch-and-run. The game
was barely three minutes old, but
Oregon already led 10-0. A 41-yard
Jeremiah Johnson touchdown run
gave the Ducks their largest lead of
the game at 17-3 with 2:09 remaining
in the first quarter.
The Cardinal, however, struck
