## Green Fund prompts student ideas $30.000 set aside for students' sustainablity projects 
### ELLIOTT JIN 
Last Thursday, environmentally active students
packed an Old Union meeting room, as Stanford's
new Green Fund was unveiled. The Green Fund,
which has set aside $30,000 to fund student sus
tainability projects, will debut this academic year.
A brainchild of Elaine Chang '10 and Lauren
Finzer '09 from Students for a Sustainable
Stanford, the Green Fund allows all Stanford stu
dents to submit project ideas to a committee for

approval. The commit
tee consists of four stu
dents, two staff mem
bers and one professor
who seek projects that
reduce Stanford's car
bon footprint, produce
measurable results and
have short payback
periods.
One of the founding
members. Nicholas
Enge '09. emphasized
the importance of direct
student involvement
and campus outreach.
"We [will] definitely

choose ones that would involve students as much
as possible, to give students their own experience
with implementing sustainability projects." he
said. "We also want to make sure that the campus
knows what's going on and supports the project,
so you don't have this backlash of. Why do I sud
denlv have less water coming out of mv shower
head?"'
Although founding members were nervous
about the Fund's first public meeting and a possi
ble shortage of projects. Thursday's gathering dis
pelled their doubts. After a brief presentation, stu
dents broke into groups to discuss ideas from all
categories of green development, including food,
energy, recycling, transportation and water.
"There were so many ideas that people
brought." Enge said. "A lot of ideas were created
at the meeting, too. which was really cool."
With over 50 students brainstorming, projects
that were discussed included rainwater-capturing
systems, power generators in exercise bikes,
rooftop gardens and drying racks.
Although Stanford has many student sustain
ability groups, few students have pursued such

hands-on projects. In the past,
obtaining grants for sustainable
projects from the University was an
intimidating process.
"The only avenue was the
research grant." Chang said, "or
bothering Housing to make
changes."
Founding member David Rust
'11 explained the Green Fund's
intention to eliminate frustrating
bureaucracy and streamline the
funding process.
"People had a lot of projects that
sounded incredible, but they just
needed that little bit of funding,"
Rust said. "Students are afraid of
applying for a grant from an institu
tion they don't know about — they
feel like they're confronting a large
wall."
Rust added that the Green
Fund's straightforward application
and student-dominated committee
would ease students' fears in apply
ing for funding and increase student
involvement in sustainability proj
ects.
Students at Thursday's meeting
agreed.
"They've broken down a lot of
the barriers," said Michael Brant
'11. "They've done so much of the
work that it seems my idea could
become possible."
"It's a very innovative way of
allocating resources." added
Michael Fisher '09. "It's pretty clear
that it's going to have a huge impact
on campus."
Although this is the Green
Fund's first year, organizers believe
it will significantly increase student
involvement. Chang, who will sit
3on the project selection commit
tee, hopes students' projects will
inspire further development
throughout campus.
"I'm looking forward to seeing
the project ideas," she said. "The
great hope is that we'll see success
ful pilot projects that show certain
cutting-edge technologies can work,
and make wide-scale changes."
