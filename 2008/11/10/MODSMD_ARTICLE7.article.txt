President-elect Obama plans to use his
executive powers to make an immediate
impact when he takes office, perhaps re
versing Bush administration policies on

stem cell research and domestic drilling for
oil and natural gas.
John Podesta. Obama's transition chief,
said Sunday Obama is reviewing President
Bush's executive orders on those issues and
others as he works to undo policies enacted
during eight years of Republican rule. He

said the president can use such orders to
move quickly on his own.
"There's a lot that the president can do
using his executive authority without wait
ing for congressional action, and 1 think
we'll see the president do that." Podesta
said."l think that he feels like he has a real

mandate for change. We need to get off the
course that the Bush administration has
set."
Podesta also said Obama is working to
build a diverse Cabinet. That includes
reaching out to Republicans and independ
ents — part of the broad coalition that sup
ported Obama during the race against Re
publican John McCain. Defense Secretary
Robert Gates has been mentioned as a pos
sible holdover.
"He's not even a Republican," Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada
said. "Why wouldn't we want to keep him?
He's never been a registered Republican."
Obama was elected on a promise of
change, but the nature of the job makes it
difficult for presidents to do much that has
an immediate impact on the lives of average
people. Congress plans to take up a second
economic aid plan before year's end — an
effort Obama supports. But it could be
months or longer before taxpayers see the
effect.
Obama could use his executive powers to
at least signal that Washington is changing.
"Obama's advantage of course is he'll
have the House and the Senate working
with him, and that makes it easier," said
Carl Tobias, a law professor at the Universi
ty of Richmond. "But even then, having an
immediate impact is very difficult to do be
cause the machinery of government doesn't
move that quickly."
Presidents long have used executive or
ders to impose policy and set priorities. One
of Bush's first acts was to reinstate full abor
tion restrictions on U.S. overseas aid. The re
strictions were first ordered by President
Reagan and the first President Bush followed
suit. President Clinton lifted them soon after
he occupied the Oval Office and it wouldn't
be surprising if Obama did the same.
Executive orders "have the power of law
and they can cover just about anything,"To
bias said in a telephone interview.
Bush used his executive power to limit
federal spending on embryonic stem cell re
search. a position championed by oppo
nents of abortion rights who argue that de
stroying embryos is akin to killing a fetus.
Obama has supported the research in an ef
fort to find cures for diseases such as
Alzheimer's. Many moderate Republicans
also support the research, giving it the

stamp of bipartisanship.
On drilling, the federal Bureau of Land
Management is opening about 360,000
acres of public land in Utah to oil and gas
drilling. Bush administration officials argue
that the drilling will not harm sensitive
areas: environmentalists oppose it.
"They want to have oil and gas drilling in
some of the most sensitive, fragile lands in
Utah." Podesta said. "1 think that's a mis
take."
Two top House Republicans said there is
a willingness to try to work with Obama to
get things done. But they said to expect Re
publicans to serve as a check against the
power held by Obama and Democratic
leaders in Congress.
"It's going to be a cheerful opposition."
said Rep. Mike Pence, R-lnd. "We're going
to carry those timeless principles of limited
government, a strong defense, traditional
values, to the American people."
Pence, of Indiana, is expected to take
over the No. 3 leadership post among
House Republicans.
In other transition matters, Obama's
new chief of staff. Rahm Emanuel, would
not say whether Obama would return to the
Senate for votes during the postelection
session this month. Obama's presence
would be extraordinary, given his position
as president-elect, especially if Congress
takes up a much-anticipated economic
stimulus plan.
"I think that the basic approach has been
he's going to be here in Chicago, setting up
his economic, not only his economic team,
but the policies he wants to outline for the
country as soon as he gets sworn in. so we
hit the ground running," Emanuel said.
Also. Emanuel would not commit to a
Democratic proposal to help the auto in
dustry with some of the $700 billion ap
proved by Congress to for the financial
bailout.
Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
D-Calif., said in a letter Saturday to Trea
sury Secretary Henry Paulson that the ad
ministration should consider expanding the
bailout to include car companies.
Podesta appeared on "Fox News Sun
day," as did Pence, and CNN's "Late Edi
tion," where Reid also was interviewed.
Emanuel spoke on ABC's "This Week" and
CBS' "Face the Nation."
