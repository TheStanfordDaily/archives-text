Texas councilman tells teens to hoist
saggy pants
Dallas Councilman Dwaine Caraway is on a
mission: He wants those wearing low-hanging,
baggy pants to pull them up.
As part of his ongoing campaign against saggy,
underwear-exposing pants, the mayor pro tem
held a summit Saturday. More than 100 adults,
children, students, ministers, law enforcement of
ficers and representatives from local organiza
tions attended the hours-long derriere affair.
Local youth counselor Calvin Glover even
brought a contingent of saggy bottom teens. The
group piled into two elevators and made its way
to the council chamber. Saggy britches, big belt
buckles and untucked T-shirts were in abun
dance.
Glover, a 29-year-old former sagger who still
admits to an occasional offense, said kids today
have taken the trend too far.exposing too much of
j their backsides.
"Come on. man." he said disgustedly. "I don't
want to see your dirty boxers that you've had on
for two or three days. I mean, really."
Nurse in Time Square war photo
reunites with Navy
A 90-year-old who says she's the woman being
kissed by a sailor in Times Square in one of World
War ll's most famous photographs reunited in
town with the Navy on Sunday — days before she
is to serve as grand marshal of the city's Veterans
Day parade.
Edith Shain of Los Angeles, donning a white
nurse's uniform like the one she wore back in 1945.
went to see the musical revival of "South Pacific"
and posed for pictures, being hoisted off her feet
on stage by five of the actors in their Navy whites.
On Tuesday.she'll ride in the parade at the head
of a contingent of World War II veterans.
The "South Pacific" event was a touching re
minder of history, but very different from Aug. 15,
1945. the day Shain recalls that she joined thou
sands of people whooping it up after Japan surren
dered. Right there on Broadway and 45th Street, a
sailor suddenly grabbed and kissed her — and the
moment was caught by Alfred Eisenstaedt. a Life
magazine photographer.
His picture from V-J Day became one of the
20th century's most iconic images.
Even the fact that Shain stands only 4 feet 9
isn't helpful in analyzing the photo, in which the
sailor has her in what looks more like a death grip
than an embrace, with both of their faces ob
scured.

By her own account, Shain said she could not
identify the bussing boy in blue.
Gay marriage supporters march in
