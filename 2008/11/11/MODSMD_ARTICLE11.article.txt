## Palin puzzled by recent focus on wardrobe 
### GENE JOHNSON THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASILLA. Alaska — Alaska Gov.
Sarah Palin says she was puzzled
by the amount of attention her
wardrobe got at the end of her
unsuccessful vice presidential run.
In an interview that aired on
Fox News Channel on Monday.
Palin said she neither wanted nor
asked for the $150.000-plus
wardrobe the Republican Party
bankrolled.
"I did not order the clothes. Did
not ask for the clothes." Palin said.
"I would have been happy to have
worn my own clothes from Day
One. But that is kind of an odd
issue, an odd campaign issue as
things were wrapping up there as
to who ordered what and who
demanded what."
Amid speculation she'll run for
president in four years. Palin
blamed Bush administration poli
cies for the defeat last week of the
GOP ticket and prayed she would
n't miss "an open door" for her
next political opportunity.
"I'm like. OK. God. if there is an
open door for me somewhere, this
is what I always pray. I'm like, don't
let me miss the open door." Palin
said in a wide-ranging interview
with Fox's Greta Van Susteren.
"And if there is an open door in '12
or four years later, and if it is some
thing that is eoing to be good for

mv family, for my state, for my
nation, an opportunity for me. then
I'll plow through that door."
"It's amazing that we did as well
as we did." Palin. who was Sen.
John McCain's running mate, said
of the election in a separate inter
view with the Anchorage Daily
News.
"I think the Republican ticket
represented too much of the status
quo. too much of what had gone on
in these last eight years, that
Americans were kind of shaking
their heads like going, wait a
minute, how did we run up a $10
trillion debt in a Republican
administration? How have there
been blunders with war strategy
under a Republican administra
tion? If we're talking change, we
want to get far away from what it
was that the present administration
represented and that is to a great
degree what the Republican Party
at the time had been representing."
Palin said in a story published
Sunday.
Palin has scheduled a series of
national interviews this week with
Fox. NBC's "Today" show and
CNN. She also plans to attend the
Republican Governors Association
conference in Florida this week.
Palin has been mentioned as a
possible presidential candidate in
2012. She also could seek re-elec
tion in 2010 or challenge Sen. L.isa
Murkowski.
