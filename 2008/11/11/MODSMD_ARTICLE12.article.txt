## Bushes and Obamas: All smiles at White House meeting 
### JENNIFER LOVEN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON- All smiles and compli
ments. President-elect Obama and his wife.
Michelle, called on President Bush and first
lady Laura Hush Monday in a White House
visit that was part political ritual, part prac
tical introduction and a striking symbol of
the historic transfer of power to come.
The president and Obama talked war
and financial crisis. I .aura Bush and
Michelle Obama talked about raising
daughters in the nation's most famous
house.
Then Obama flew back to Chicago to
work on setting up the new administration
that will take over on Jan. 20.
Mrs. Obama came earlier than her hus
band to the nation's capital, and stayed after
him. hunting a new school lor the kids by
visiting two of the city's best-known private
schools.
If first impressions matter. Obama and
his wife displayed one similarity to the
super-punctual Bushes, pulling up to the
White House's South Portico II minutes
early. The couples traded warm and easy
greetings in the crisp autumn sunshine, with
the wives exchanging pleasantries about the
fall hues each wore - Mrs. Bush in a brown
dress and Mrs. Obama in a red one.
While ()bama and Bush, in business suits,
proceeded waving and smiling down the
White House Colonnade for nearly two
hours of private talks. Mrs. ()bania and Mrs.
Bush had their own agenda: talk of raising
children in most unusual circumstances. Mrs.
Bush conducted a tour ol the living quarters

of the historic mansion and made introduc
tions to the army of residence staff who look
after first families.
Michelle Obama had toured the White
I louse before with daughters Malia, who is
10. and Sasha, who is 7. But the two women
had never met.
The 43rd president and the man who will
be the 44th - and first black - commander in
chief met alone in the Oval Office, with no
handlers or staff. It was Obama's first time in
the storied workspace, even though he had
been to the White House previously for
events.
Neither the Bushes nor the Obamas
spoke to reporters.
Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs said
the two men "talked extensively" about
both the economic situation and foreign pol
icy. Obama inherits from Bush an economy
in deep turmoil and two wars that are far
from won, among other problems.
Ibpics between them included the hous
ing industry, foreclosures, the auto industry
in crisis, as well as "the need to get the econ
omy back on track," Gibbs said.
Obama's aides said the president-elect
discussed with Bush the need for urgent
action to help struggling automakers. Gibbs
said "it was a discussion about the broad
health of the industry" that was not just lim
ited to just any one of the nation's three
largest car makers.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid asked the
administration this weekend to consider
expanding the $700 billion bailout for finan
cial firms to include car companies. At a
news conference Friday, Obama said he

hoped the Bush administration would "do
everything it can to accelerate the retooling
assistance that Congress has already enact
ed."
lite White House did not reject such an
idea. Presidential spokeswoman Dana
Perino said Bush would listen to lawmakers
if. when they come back for a post-election
session, "they decide to try to do something
more on the auto industry." She said
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson would
review the rescue plan again, but also sug
gested the administration needs Congress'
help to determine which industries might
qualify for help under the new law.
Regarding any new economic stimulus
plan, the White House has repeatedly
stressed that its main priority is passage of a
free trade agreement with Colombia.
As for Obama's first glimpse of the Oval
Office. Gibbs said. "He said it was a very,
very nice office."
Perino said Bush described the meeting
as "constructive, relaxed and friendly." cov
ering problems at home and abroad, and
said he personally pledged a smooth transi
tion. Bush gave Obama a sneak peek at
White House highlights, such as the I incoln
Bedroom and the president's office in the
residence, after their hour-plus in the Oval
Office.
Such White I louse meetings have a histo
ry going back decades. They are discussions
that can range wherever the two men
choose, whether on specific issues, how best
to make decisions, the extraordinary
resources that accompany any American
president, the special weight of the office or
even the secrets about the building that few

people are privy to. It's also a chance to
establish personal rapport between near
strangers. though that is by no means guar
anteed.
Michelle Obama checked out
Georgetown Day School in the morning and
then Sidwell Friends School, which Chelsea
Clinton attended when her parents were in
the White House, in the afternoon before
joining her husband back in Chicago. The
Obamas' children now attend a private
school there.
At the White House, while Bush and
Obama talked, parallel confabs went on all
around the building.
Bush chief of staff Josh Bolten and
Obama transition manager John Podesta.
himself a former White House chief of staff
under President Clinton, held their own
talks after standing off to the side together
in the Rose Garden watching their bosses
walk by. Obama s likely White House press
secretary. Gibbs. got a glimpse of the West
Wing digs he probably will occupy - includ
ing a fancy bank of television screens.
Outside, crowds built throughout the day
with people pressing their noses through the
fencing around the White I louse complex in
hopes of getting a glimpse of the first family
to be. Street vendors operating nearby were
already stocked with Obama-related mer
chandise.
Obama traveled the streets of
Washington and up the White House drive
in a motorcade upgraded from campaign
mode to full-blown presidential level. There
were the two identical black, heavily
armored limousines - one a decoy - like
those Bush rides in.onlv without the seal or

flying flags. There was also a hazardous
materials truck, a communications vehicle
and an ominous-looking, armed-to-the
teeth counterassault team filling the seats of
an open-windowed Suburban.
Obama's staff, most in suits, remarked
they had needed to buy "grown-up clothes"
that better befitted a White House visit than
the smart casual look they had adopted for
the campaign plane. Even the entourage's
ever-cheerfl.il luggage handler donned a coat
and tie for the day. though he didn't come
along to the White House.
And there was one small but unmistak
able sign that it will be Obama who will be
in charge before too long: He put a hand on
Bush's back as they went side-bv-side inside
the building from Obama's motorcade, as if
he was guiding the president into his own
house.
Later, as he sat on his plane waiting for
takeoff, he was heard to say into his cell
phone: "I'm not going to be spending too
much time in Washington over the next sev
eral weeks."
These White House sessions are designed
to put the presidency above politics, tem
porarily at least. ITiis year's took place less
than a week after Election Day. giving less
time than usual for raw campaign words to
fade.
But both Bush and Obama have set a
tone of graciousness and cooperation that
has surprised - and pleased - many
observers.

in deep turmoil and two wars that are far
from won, among other problems.
Ibpics between them included the hous
ing industry, foreclosures, the auto industry
in crisis, as well as "the need to get the econ
omy back on track," Gibbs said.
Obama's aides said the president-elect
discussed with Bush the need for urgent
action to help struggling automakers. Gibbs
said "it was a discussion about the broad
health of the industry" that was not just lim
ited to just any one of the nation's three
largest car makers.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate
Majority Leader Harry Reid asked the
administration this weekend to consider
expanding the $700 billion bailout for finan
cial firms to include car companies. At a
news conference Friday, Obama said he

hoped the Bush administration would "do
everything it can to accelerate the retooling
assistance that Congress has already enact
ed."
lite White House did not reject such an
idea. Presidential spokeswoman Dana
Perino said Bush would listen to lawmakers
if. when they come back for a post-election
session, "they decide to try to do something
more on the auto industry." She said
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson would
review the rescue plan again, but also sug
gested the administration needs Congress'
help to determine which industries might
qualify for help under the new law.
Regarding any new economic stimulus
plan, the White House has repeatedly
stressed that its main priority is passage of a
free trade agreement with Colombia.
As for Obama's first glimpse of the Oval
Office. Gibbs said. "He said it was a very,
very nice office."
Perino said Bush described the meeting
as "constructive, relaxed and friendly." cov
ering problems at home and abroad, and
said he personally pledged a smooth transi
tion. Bush gave Obama a sneak peek at
White House highlights, such as the I incoln
Bedroom and the president's office in the
residence, after their hour-plus in the Oval
Office.
Such White I louse meetings have a histo
ry going back decades. They are discussions
that can range wherever the two men
choose, whether on specific issues, how best
to make decisions, the extraordinary
resources that accompany any American
president, the special weight of the office or
even the secrets about the building that few

people are privy to. It's also a chance to

WASHINGTON- All smiles and compli
ments. President-elect Obama and his wife.
Michelle, called on President Bush and first
lady Laura Hush Monday in a White House
visit that was part political ritual, part prac
tical introduction and a striking symbol of
the historic transfer of power to come.
The president and Obama talked war
and financial crisis. I .aura Bush and
Michelle Obama talked about raising
daughters in the nation's most famous
house.
Then Obama flew back to Chicago to
work on setting up the new administration
that will take over on Jan. 20.
Mrs. Obama came earlier than her hus
band to the nation's capital, and stayed after
him. hunting a new school lor the kids by
visiting two of the city's best-known private
schools.
If first impressions matter. Obama and
his wife displayed one similarity to the
super-punctual Bushes, pulling up to the
White House's South Portico II minutes
early. The couples traded warm and easy
greetings in the crisp autumn sunshine, with
the wives exchanging pleasantries about the
fall hues each wore - Mrs. Bush in a brown
dress and Mrs. Obama in a red one.
While ()bama and Bush, in business suits,
proceeded waving and smiling down the
White House Colonnade for nearly two
hours of private talks. Mrs. ()bania and Mrs.
Bush had their own agenda: talk of raising
children in most unusual circumstances. Mrs.
Bush conducted a tour ol the living quarters

of the historic mansion and made introduc
tions to the army of residence staff who look
after first families.
Michelle Obama had toured the White
I louse before with daughters Malia, who is
10. and Sasha, who is 7. But the two women
had never met.
The 43rd president and the man who will
be the 44th - and first black - commander in
chief met alone in the Oval Office, with no
handlers or staff. It was Obama's first time in
the storied workspace, even though he had
been to the White House previously for
events.
Neither the Bushes nor the Obamas
spoke to reporters.
Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs said
the two men "talked extensively" about
both the economic situation and foreign pol
icy. Obama inherits from Bush an economy
in deep turmoil and two wars that are far
from won, among other problems.
Ibpics between them included the hous
ing industry, foreclosures, the auto industry
