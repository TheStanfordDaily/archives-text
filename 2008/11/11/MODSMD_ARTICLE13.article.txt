## Editorial Undergrad. expansion too risky a proposal 
### 
On Thursday, Oct. 30, t he Stanford Task
Force on Undergraduate Expansion
released an interim report on the sta
tus of deliberations regarding expanding the
undergraduate population by about 200 stu
dents. The task force estimated that under
graduate expansion will cost between $700
million and $1 billion. Ironically, that same
day. President John I lennessy sent an email
to Stanford students, faculty and staff alert
ing them to a $45 million cut from the gener
al funds budget.
Considering the mighty toll on both the
University's already weakened financial sta
tus and overall quality of student life, the ed
itorial board strongly condemns any move
for undergraduate expansion anytime in the
near future.
The biggest move for undergraduate ex
pansion began with a column by Hennessy
in the September/October 2007 issue of
Stanford Magazine, which pondered the
benefits of increasing the undergraduate
population. The column was prompted in
large part by a record 24,000 applicants in
2007 and the University's desire to provide
quality education to qualified candidates
from a variety of socioeconomic and cultur
al backgrounds. Admitting a larger fresh
man class would potentially increase diversi
ty and broaden experiences for the under
graduate population as a whole, while still
maintaining a high standard for admission.
Another important argument in favor of
expansion is the shrinking size of the under
graduate population, which has dropped from
63 percent of the total Stanford population 50
years ago to just 41 percent in the 2(X)7-2(X)8
academic year. Expansion would also fall
under the goals of Stanford's founders, Leland
and Jane Stanford, who built the University to
bring quality education to the children of Cal
ifornia and the West.
Despite these purported yet abstract
benefits of undergraduate expansion, there
are concrete and harmful disadvantages as
well. I"he most clear and of-the-moment
problem with undergraduate expansion is its
sheer monetary cost. We currently face "the
tightest financial outlook we have seen in
decades," as Hennessy noted in his Oct. 30
email.

To simultaneously chop $45 million from
the general funds budget while saddling the
University with up to $1 billion in costs
seems utterly nonsensical. Why are we lay
ing off employees only to admit a larger stu
dent population? While Hennessy noted the
cost of expansion would be a one-time in
vestment in faculty, housing, staff and other
resources that would cover years of expan
sion. making grand aims to expand an al
ready strained resource pool is far too risky
at thisstage in time. Now is not the time to be
overstretching our funds.
Other vital University resources would
potentially be overstretched as more stu
dents would seek financial aid. apply to
overseas campuses and enroll in popular
majors like human biology and economics.
With the need for financial aid only increas
ing. a move that would in any way damage
the University's ability to support access to
education is the most damning strike against
an expansion.
Furthermore, undergraduates already
face a serious housing and classroom
crunch. Increasing the size of the undergrad
uate population would only exacerbate an
already dire situation.The University should
focus its efforts on improving the experience
of freshmen by increasing the number of
freshman dorms and improving Residential
Education.The opportunities and life expe
riences provided bv living in a close-knit
freshman dorm far outweigh the cross-inter
actions between 200 additional students.
The University ultimately should be fo
cused 100 percent on the current student
population, not sacrificing the quality of life
and the quality of education to simply in
crease international prestige or reach a lofty,
abstract goal. Stanford has many problems
to solve, the housing crunch among them,
and these should be dealt with long before
the University even considers admitting
more students.
Undergraduate life is a short four years,
and these years should be of the utmost
quality. One of the major reasons Stanford is
such an esteemed institution is because its
students boast outstanding quality of life,
much of which lies in the University's small
er size. Let's keep it that way.
