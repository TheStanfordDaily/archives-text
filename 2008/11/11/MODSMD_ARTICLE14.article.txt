## The myth of the youth vote
### 
Well, we were fooled again. Every
one. myself included, predicted a
substantial increase in the "youth
vote," or voters between the ages of IS and
30.Thanks to the Internet, Obama's appeal
on college campuses and ridiculous events
like the "You Tube debate," it seemed that
politicians had finally broken through to
young voters.
It looked good for a while. We did see
substantial increases during the primaries,
when college-age students were invaluable
to Obama's crucial victory in lowa.The on
campus effort for Obama in the lead-up to
the Feb. 5 California Democratic primary
was certainly impressive. Hundreds of stu
dents had those blue-and-red "Hope" or
"Change" photos as their Facebook profile
pictures. (Interestingly, these all disap
peared after he won the primary.)
It seems, though, that the increases every
one expected to happen did not materialize
in the general election. According to the
Politico, the youth vote made up IK percent
of the electorate, compared to 17 percent of
the electorate in 2(K)4. TTiis is not a substan
tial increase, and it seems to be much lower
than everyone had thought or hoped.
Obama's remarkable pull among col
lege-age voters was not in bringing new
ones to the polls — indeed, numbers barely
went up from 2004 — but in winning the
ones who voted. John Kerry only won voters
aged 18-30 by 9 points, but Obama won
them by 34 points. His 66-32 margin among
young voters is truly remarkable, and it
bodes poorly for Republicans as these vot
ers grow older and vote in higher numbers.
Young voters went for Congressional De
mocrats by almost as much, indicating that
not only do young voters love Obama but
that they tended to love Democrats in gen
eral. Without such a huge margin, Obama
would have lost many of the swing states he
flipped from the Republicans.
Ihe fact that so many young voters went
for Obama does not say anything about

their level of engagement or participation in
the political process. The more fundamental
question remaining is how to engage young
voters when they do not have much of a per
sonal stake in the process. At Stanford, it's
telling that most Obama supporters seemed
interested in him for his charisma and biog
raphy, rather than his policy positions, which
were never much out of the mainstream.
The antiwar movement, for example, has
never had a presence at Stanford; students
did not seem particularly concerned about
Obama's positions on any issue, including
the war. which was the original centerpiece
of his campaign.
Considering young voters' lack of real
policy engagement with the campaign, it
will be interesting to see the issue on which
young voters take a different stance from
Obama. Will we be disillusioned by politics
as usual? Will we still believe in him even
after he is inevitably forced to make com
promises? Can he win 66 percent of the
youth vote again in 2012?
To a certain degree, the lofty proclama
tions of the "Obama Generation" are true
for people our age, Obama is our defin
ing politician. Bill Clinton was too long ago.
and George Bush is anathema. I'm not sure
all Stanford students,or all 18-30 voters,can
articulate why we support Obama, but
many of us do.
What he does with his presidency, how
ever. will prove to be highly influential to
how we view politics in the future.
