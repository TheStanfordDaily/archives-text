# Executive Experiences
## Come together, right now 
### 
Let me tell you about the collegiate so
cial scene at Northwestern, where I
started my college career. A zero-toler
ance alcohol policy dissuaded most student
groups from throwing parties. The few par
ties that did happen were held by fraternities.
To prevent overcrowding, guests needed to
be invited personally.
The rest of us plebes had to content our
selves by partying behind closed doors, or by
carting off to random sketchy bars in town. It
was so awesome that I transferred.
My first weeks at Stanford were a breath
of fresh air. The first Saturday night after
classes started.some friends and I were walk
ing down the Row, where a number of hous
es had their doors open. Everywhere we
went,groups of people were hanging out,and
they invited us to join them.
'ITiis was everything I wanted in a social
scene: fun. inclusive and diverse. ITiere was a
plethora of social events happening simulta
neously,and I floated between them,encoun
tering a cross-section of campus in the
process. Finally, I was at a university where
students actually partied as a community.
Two years later. I am a veritable Julius
Caesar, stabbed in the heart by the advent of
increasingly strident party policies here. Sud
denly, every get-together "needs" more secu
rity guards than Fort Knox, and every party is
a fire hazard due to perceived overcrowding.
Houses get in trouble for throwing parties,
which deincentivizes them from doing so
again in the future. Then there are fewer par
ties, and — guess what? — they're even
more crowded than before. In fact, they're so
crowded that not even all of the people at
these parties are our own.

Dear Palo Alto I ligh School students: We
don't want you here past your bedtime. As a
94301-native myself. I insist that you spend
your post-adolescent weekend nights just the
way I did — hanging out with that dude who
makes the balloon hats at Pizza My Heart.
XOXO, Jenna "Big Guns" Reback.
1 understand and respect the rationale of
the Univesity's increasingly strict party poli
cies. If someone gets injured or ill as the re
sult of excessive alcohol consumption at one
of these overcrowded parties, it is the Univer
sity. not the individual, that stands to be vic
tim to a massive lawsuit — and, in a flash,
there goes your free T-shirt money (and our
reputation). The ante only gets upped if the
"someone" in question is a rando who could
potentially harm real Stanford students, or
themselves.
'ITiat being said. I'm worried that we're
headed in the direction of Northwestern,
where hosting more than four people in a
room, even if no one is drinking, constitutes
an illegal party. Et tu. Brute?
Hie road to party hell — or, at least, to a
severe degradation in the quality of campus
life — is paved with the University's good in
tentions — our safety is top priority. But the
admirable goals that guide these new policies
are negatively impacting this campus, and 1
fear the worst is yet to come.
It's no surprise that already there are far
fewer parties on campus this year than last.
And whenever there is an all-campus party,
people swarm it. Not only does this increase
the risk of a negative incident, but it makes it
a lot easier for high-schoolers driving around
in their moms' Volvos to find us, too.
So what happens if you choose not to go to

the one party being thrown on any given
weekend, or if there isn't even an all-campus
party being thrown? You end up sitting
around in your lounge with the same 10 peo
ple you see every day.That sure is the kind of
horizon-expanding experience that drew me
here.
On the other hand, maybe you and your
10 friends decide that you're going to find a
party, but you're not sure you'll be able to get
a drink there. You each pound a few shots be
fore heading out. thereby saluting Stanford's
new social policies for helping you make
healthy decisions.
Stanford affords a wide variety of forums
in which we can come together as a commu
nity — sports events, theatrical performanc
es and so on — but I'd like to know whatev
er happened to good old unstructured fun.
I'm not arguing that we need more all-cam
pus parties because I have a lot of free time,
or because I'm a particularly big drinker
(quite the contrary). But. I feel strongly that
Stanford's current party policies are anti
thetical to the spirit we try to foster on this
campus.
The right to party seems frivolous, but it
impacts the way we interact with each other
and the way we celebrate our school. We de
serve to enjoy ourselves while enjoying each
other's company.
