## Remember our nation's veterans 
### 
Why arc you in school? Don't you
know what day it is today? It's a na
tional holiday; almost no one going
to a public school is in class. Most college cam
puses are closed as well. In fact, we are one of
the few universities actually in session. Why?
Today is Veterans Day, also celebrated
around the world as Armistice Day or Re
membrance Day. This date commemorates
the peace achieved on the I Ith hour of the
I Ith day of the 1 Ith month in 1918 when the

Germans officially signed the armistice end
ing World War I. We've celebrated it as a na
tion every year since 1919 when President
Wilson declared it a national day of remem
brance. It celebrates everyone who has worn
a uniform, whether they served during war or
peace. Too often overlooked are those who
answered the call when there was no war and
stood ready to defend our nation and her al
lies if the need arose.
Today is a chance to reflect on the sacri

fices of those men and women who have
served in uniform during the last 230-plus
years. It's an opportunity for introspection,
for taking stock of what matters,and it's par
ticularly appropriate given Stanford Univer
sity's recent focus on the theme of service.
Stanford students have a unique duty to
the veteran community. We are the future
politicians, business leaders, community
organizers and social entrepreneurs
of this country; we are also the great
est beneficiaries of the peace and
prosperity secured by the continual
sacrifices of the military. We owe
them the greatest debt, and it is one
we can never repay.
And yet we will all be in class
today with our noses to the grind
stone,stressed about tests.papers. in
terviews and the like. We will live this
day like any other and pass up the
chance to learn something — any
thing — about the 23 million people
currently living in the United States
who have defended us and our inter
ests, at home and abroad. Every day
we lose 1.000 men and women who
dedicated a portion of their lives to
securing the liberties of others.
Veterans choose to enlist for
many reasons: family history, educa
tional opportunities, a chance to
travel or because a friend is signing
up. Or maybe they were drafted and
fought in a war they never asked to
be a part of. They come from all
states and territories and even from
overseas. They are the sons and
daughters of secretaries, farmers,
business owners and even the vice
president-elect. Every race, gender
and religion is represented in the
military, and these people are not
saying the same things. They don't
want the same cars, homes, lives or
presidents. Veterans are people, first

and foremost, and so they are as dif
ferent as you and I. Anyone who pre
tends to know how all veterans feel,
or what they think, is a fool.
But that's not to say there isn't a
thread of commonality, because
there is. To commemorate the awe
some and ongoing sacrifices freely
made by our nation's military, you
can do the one thing that all veter
ans, from all generations and nation
alities, can agree on: remember. Re
member that we are protected every
day, all day, by men and women we
don't see and rarely think of. Re
member we asked them to go into
harm's way for what we (not they)
deemed necessary and proper. Re
member the awful and wonderful
things they have done for our coun
try. Remember they have sometimes
come home to an indifferent or even
hostile nation. Remember we owe
them our safety, our thanks and our
love.
Just remember they exist.
Happy Veterans Day.
For it has been said so truthfully
that it is the soldier, not the reporter;
who has given us the freedom of the
press. It is the soldier, not the poet,
who has given us freedom of speech.
It is the soldier, not the agitator, who
has given us the freedom to protest. It
is the soldier who salutes the flag,
serves beneath the flag, whose coffin
is draped by the flag, who gives that
protester the freedom to abuse and
burn that flag. — Zell Miller
