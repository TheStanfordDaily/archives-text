## Remember our nation's veterans 
### 
Why arc you in school? Don't you
know what day it is today? It's a na
tional holiday; almost no one going
to a public school is in class. Most college cam
puses are closed as well. In fact, we are one of
the few universities actually in session. Why?
Today is Veterans Day, also celebrated
around the world as Armistice Day or Re
membrance Day. This date commemorates
the peace achieved on the I Ith hour of the
I Ith day of the 1 Ith month in 1918 when the

Germans officially signed the armistice end
ing World War I. We've celebrated it as a na
tion every year since 1919 when President
Wilson declared it a national day of remem
brance. It celebrates everyone who has worn
a uniform, whether they served during war or
peace. Too often overlooked are those who
answered the call when there was no war and
stood ready to defend our nation and her al
lies if the need arose.
Today is a chance to reflect on the sacri

fices of those men and women who have
served in uniform during the last 230-plus
years. It's an opportunity for introspection,
for taking stock of what matters,and it's par
ticularly appropriate given Stanford Univer
sity's recent focus on the theme of service.
Stanford students have a unique duty to
the veteran community. We are the future
politicians, business leaders, community
