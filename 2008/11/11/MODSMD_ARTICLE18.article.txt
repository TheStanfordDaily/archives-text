If you're looking tor an ugly duckling-vari
ety sports story, check out the Stanford
women's field hockey team.
The Cardinal women have come a long way
since their disappointing start to the season in
what has been a tense hut inspirational year.
Going into the NorPac Tournament in Far
mville. Va.. no one expected the 6-10 Cardinal
to achieve much, but Stanford wound up pass
ing its biggest test of the season to date with
flying colors.
Against Davidson, in the opening round of
the conference tournament. Stanford won by a
score of 4-2. Junior Midori Uehara led all scor

ers with two goals, and senior Bailey Richard
son and Gandhi chipped in with one score
each.
The Cardinal next faced Pacific, a team it
beat twice in the regular season. The Tigers fo
cused on containing Uehara and were success
ful. limiting her to just one shot. But Pacific's
defensive strategy allowed other Stanford
players to step up. and freshman Stephanie
Byrne made the Tigers pay. Byrne scored
twice, and Stanford scraped out a 3-2 victory.
Sophomore Jaimee Erickson also added a
goal, and redshirt freshman Alessandra Moss
made four saves in both matches.
To add to the already high drama of the
NorPac Tournament setting, Stanford faced
rival Cal in the final game â€” a team the Car

dinal had just beaten and the best team in the
conference for most of the year. Both teams
fought hard in their final meeting, and regula
tion play ended in a tie.The first overtime also
ended in deadlock, leading to a second bonus
period.
Fortunately, the Stanford women played in
numerous overtime contests this season and
had the endurance and experience to survive a
long match.Trailing 1 -0 with only four minutes
left in regulation time, sophomore Xanthe
Travlos forced overtime when she scored on a
penalty stroke.
It was fitting that fellow sophomore
Camille Gandhi scored the game-winning
