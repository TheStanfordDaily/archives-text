If you're looking tor an ugly duckling-vari
ety sports story, check out the Stanford
women's field hockey team.
The Cardinal women have come a long way
since their disappointing start to the season in
what has been a tense hut inspirational year.
Going into the NorPac Tournament in Far
mville. Va.. no one expected the 6-10 Cardinal
to achieve much, but Stanford wound up pass
ing its biggest test of the season to date with
flying colors.
Against Davidson, in the opening round of
the conference tournament. Stanford won by a
score of 4-2. Junior Midori Uehara led all scor

ers with two goals, and senior Bailey Richard
son and Gandhi chipped in with one score
each.
The Cardinal next faced Pacific, a team it
beat twice in the regular season. The Tigers fo
cused on containing Uehara and were success
ful. limiting her to just one shot. But Pacific's
defensive strategy allowed other Stanford
players to step up. and freshman Stephanie
Byrne made the Tigers pay. Byrne scored
twice, and Stanford scraped out a 3-2 victory.
Sophomore Jaimee Erickson also added a
goal, and redshirt freshman Alessandra Moss
made four saves in both matches.
To add to the already high drama of the
NorPac Tournament setting, Stanford faced
rival Cal in the final game — a team the Car

dinal had just beaten and the best team in the
conference for most of the year. Both teams
fought hard in their final meeting, and regula
tion play ended in a tie.The first overtime also
ended in deadlock, leading to a second bonus
period.
Fortunately, the Stanford women played in
numerous overtime contests this season and
had the endurance and experience to survive a
long match.Trailing 1 -0 with only four minutes
left in regulation time, sophomore Xanthe
Travlos forced overtime when she scored on a
penalty stroke.
It was fitting that fellow sophomore
Camille Gandhi scored the game-winning

After struggling earlier this season, Stanford field hockey has won seven of its last eight games. The Cardinal women successfuly defended the NorPac Conference title this weekend by defeating
Davidson, Pacific and No. 16 Cal. Stanford now must defeat Ivy League Champ Princeton in a play-in game to advance to the NCAA Tournament.
goal for the Cardinal after leading
the team offensively all season.
Gandhi tapped in a shot in the 94th
minute to end the match and send
the Cardinal back to the Farm as
NorPac Champions.
Just a week after ending the
Bears' perfect season in NorPac play
with a 2-1 victory in overtime to close
out its regular season, the Cardinal
women defeated Cal by the same
score in double-OT to knock them
out of the conference tournament.
"It was a hard-fought win. but not
unexpected." Uehara said of the
match. "We went into the game con
fident and excited to play,and got the
result we have worked so hard for
these past months."
Much of the credit goes to Moss,
as she tied a career high with an in
credible 13 saves in the final. With a
spectacular performance in the cage.
Moss showed why she received so
many accolades this season.
"Ale Moss and our defense kept
us in the game." Richardson said of
her young teammate and the rest of
the defense. "Ale played out of her
mind in goal. The match was totally
one-sided, with Cal dominating in
number of shots on cage. But their
confidence began to fade after our
defense rejected their scoring at
tempts over and over."
At the end of the tournament.

junior Nora Soza — who scored the
winning goal against Cal in the last
regular-season match — was named
NorPac Tournament MVP Travlos.
Moss and senior Hillary Braun
earned spots on the All-Tournament
Team.
The Cardinal had already racked
up plenty of individual honors, how
ever. On the eve of the tournament,
the Stanford women attended the
annual conference awards banquet,
and came away with several honors,
a testament to the team's depth and
versatility. Gandhi, who was Rookie
of the Year last season, became the
first Stanford athlete to earn Player
of the Year status since 2000.
Gandhi leads the Cardinal in as
sists (8) and shot attempts (41). and
truly emerged as a team leader this
year, despite missing two key match
es in October while leading the USA
Under-21 National Team to gold at
the 2008 Junior Pan American
Games in Mexico City. Michelle
Scott '01 was the last Cardinal
woman to earn the honor, back in
2000.
Byrne followed in Gandhi's foot
steps. becoming the sixth consecu
tive Stanford freshman to capture
the Rookie of the Year award. Byrne
made a big impact on the field this
season, ranking second on the team
in goals (6) and third in attempted
shots (24).
Gandhi and Travlos were named
to the All-MPSF First Team. Travlos
recorded four goals and four assists,
and ranks second on the team with
33 shot attempts.

Richardson. Uehara and Moss
were named to the NorPac's Second
Team. Richardson, one of the most
consistent and dependable players
on the team, recorded four assists
and 16 shot attempts this year.
Richardson has played in 75 out of a
possible 77 games during her Stan
ford career, highlighting her remark
able consistency.
Uehara had an incredible season,
pacing the Cardinal in goals with
nine — two of which were game
clinchers. The highlight of her career
came against Pacific in late Septem
ber. when she scored four goals on
just four shots. .
The rookie. Moss, stepped up and
played like a veteran in her first sea
son of collegiate field hockey. Estab
lishing herself as one of the premier
goalkeepers in the conference. Moss
earned NorPac Player of the Week
on three separate occasions during
the regular season. She made SO
saves, with a career high of 13 stops
against No. 4 lowa.
The title of NorPac Tournament
Champion earned Stanford a spot in
the NCAA play-in game — the win
ner of which earns a spot in the
NCAA Tournament. Hie Cardinal
will face No. 11 Princeton on Tuesday
in Princeton, N.J. The Tigers boast a
record of 14-2 and are the reigning
Ivy League Champions. They are
also one of the most explosive offen
sive teams in the nation, and are just
the 12th Princeton squad to go unde
feated in Ivy League conference
play.The Tigers have outscored their
opponents 73-24 and have outshot

opponents to the tune of 428-130.
Stanford faces one of the best
teams in the country, and there will
be no room for mistakes if the Cardi
nal hopes to advance into the NCAA
Tournament. The Stanford women
are known for late-season surges and
they hope to continue the trend
against the Tigers.

"We peaked at the right time in
our season." Uehara said. "And [we]
can't wait to play Princeton on I'ucs
day — (we're] playing to keep play
ing."
Currently, Stanford holds a 2-5
record against nationally ranked op
ponents. The Cardinal played four
top-20 squads over the first six games

of the year and went 0-4 in those eon
tests. but it lost three of those games
by just one goal.
Fresh off winning the NorPac
title. Stanford will be confident and
inspired when it travels to Princeton.
