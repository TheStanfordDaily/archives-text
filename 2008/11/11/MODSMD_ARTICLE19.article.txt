### WILL DOOLEY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford men's soccer finally hit its stride
as it has been threatening to do all season.The
Cardinal went undefeated at home this week
end with a dominant 4-2 victory over Wash
ington on Friday night, followed hv a solid ()-()
tie with Oregon State on Sunday afternoon.
It was an excellent weekend for Stanford
overall: Friday, the team doubled its single
game scoring high on the season, and Sunday,
senior goalie Josh Nesbit picked up his first
career shutout.
Friday was at once representative of the
troubles Stanford (4-10-3. 2-5-2 Fac-10) has
faced all season and a sharp departure from
the team's typical results. Having been ham
pered all season long by injuries to key play
ers, including both senior co-captains, the Car
dinal entered Friday's game even more de
pleted than usual. But several others stepped
up to the challenge as Stanford's four-goal on
slaught came from unlikely sources.
Junior co-captain Michael Strickland, sen
ior Enrique Allen and redshirt freshmen Tay
lor Amman and Garrett Ciunther all netted
their first goals of the season. For Amman,
Allen and Ciunther. the scores were also their
first collegiate goals.
Stanford went into the weekend in the
midst of a four-game losing streak and had
scored just 10 goals all year.'lTie Cardinal men
proceeded to score almost half that number
on Friday — the team's previous high had
been two goals in a game. Washington (N-7-2.
3-4-2) entered the match in position to tie

GAME NOTES: The Stanford men's soccer team broke out
of a season-long scoring slump with a four-goal outbur:
against Washington on Friday. The Cardinal got scores
from unlikely sources, as three players scored their first
career goals. Sunday was the team's last home game,
and the team honored its seniors before taking on OSU
Backup keeper Josh Nesbit got his first start of the sea
son and recorded his first career shutout against an ag
gressive Beavers offense. But the Stanford men also lost
midfielder Thiago Sa Friere for the season with a leg in
iury. The Cardinal will have to make up for his absence
when it plays the Bears this weekend in Berkeley.

Friday's result was a far cry from what
many expected. The teams' previous meeting
was a 1-0 loss for Stanford — and the Cardi
nal was notably healthier at the time.
"We had a lot of guys injured" said Stan
ford coach Bret Simon following the game.
"So a lot of guys who don't normally gel op
portunities showed why it's important to
work hard and always be ready. They came

through in the clutch for us tonight."
Strickland opened the scoring in the 24th
minute when he took a pass from senior Tim
Jones and shelved it in the top left corner.The
center midfielder then took possession of the
game.
"Michael played a great game." Simon
said. "He held us together. He was the best
player on the field."
The junior co-captain also assisted on the
third goal of the game, when Allen knocked in
a loose ball off free kick from Strickland.
Allen — a fifth-year senior — got his first
start of the year seven games ago and hasn't
missed one since
"He really has had a great finish to his sen

ior year," Simon said, praising Allen. "He's
worked so hard for five years."
Amman, on the other hand, was playing in
only his second game all season and the first in
two months. The redshirt freshman had al
ready gotten off one shot — a strong kick that
was saved hy the Husky keeper — when he
scored his first collegiate goal in the 45th
minute, giving Stanford a 2-0 lead going right
into the half. Amman's shot was the benefici
ary of a lucky bounce, deflecting off a Wash
ington defender and over the keeper — who
was already in mid-air — before landing in
the back of the net.

Reshirt freshman Taylor Amman, playing in just his second game this season, scored one of the
Cardinal's four goals in a win over Washington. Stanford could only get a tie against Oregon
State in its home finale on Sunday, but considered the weekend an overall success.
