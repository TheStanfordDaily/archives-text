## Zimbardo speaks on Pearl's legacy of heroism Psychology prof. takes part part in memorial lecture 
### AN LE NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Philip Zimbardo, professor emeritus of
psychology, spoke at Kresge Auditorium
yesterday night. His lecture, entitled "The
journey from Evil to Heroism: In Honor of
Daniel Pearl," drew a sizable crowd at the
third annual talk paying tribute to the slain
Stanford alum.
Pearl '85, a former Wall Street Journal
reporter, was abducted and killed in
Pakistan in 2002. In his memory, the annual
Daniel Pearl Lecture Series was created in
2006 through a partnership between the
Office for Religious Life, the Office of the
President, the Daniel Pearl Foundation and
Hillel at Stanford.
According to Debbie McDevitt. infor
mation editor for the Office for Religious
Life, the lecture series was a logical devel
opment.
"Daniel Pearl was a writer himself and a
great communicator, and it seemed like a
natural thing to have a lecture series."
McDevitt said.
In an email to The Daily. Hillel's

Executive Director Adina Danzig Epelman
stressed how the lecture series connects
Pearl's legacy to current affairs.
"The event aims to form a bridge
between the past and present by combining
a personal tribute to Dannv with a current
speaker of national or international promi
nence." said Danzig Epelman.
This year, the ASSU Speakers Bureau
and the Department of Psychology cospon
sored Zimbardo's lecture.
Zimbardo began his talk with video clips
and an anecdotal narrative in remembrance
of Pearl — a move made all the more
poignant by the presence of the deceased
alum's parents. Judea and Ruth Pearl.
But an equally important part of
Zimbardo's speech focused on the Lucifer
Effect. This concept derives from
Zimbardo's prominent research on the
process by which good people turn evil. In
particular. Zimbardo highlighted the
human mind's capacity to make people
behave kindly or cruelly. He stated that psy
chology aims to understand this transfor
mation of the human mind through three
lenses — dispositional, situational and sys
temic. Zimbardo used the Abu Ghraib
abuses. Pearl's murder and his own
Stanford Prison Experiment as examples of
how ordinary people can commit extraordi
narily cruel acts.

In concluding his lecture. Zimbardo
questioned whether or not ordinary people
have the power to overcome the Lucifer
Effect. For him. the answer seems to
depend on demystifying and democratizing
heroism. Zimbardo particularly empha
sized the need for a socio-centric approach
to heroism, as demonstrated by Pearl.
"Heroism is the basic antidote to evil."
Zimbardo said.
Zimbardo stated that Pearl's courage
was shown by his risky and determined
efforts to uncover the truth about terrorist

financing —an endeavor that ultimately
took his life.
"You're a hero because of what you do
before you die." Zimbardo said, adding that
what Pearl did in the days preceding his
death demonstrated his heroism.
Zimbardo's emphasis on the Lucifer
Effect surprised some students.
"It was great to hear that he had a new
project... having connection with Daniel
Pearl." said Michael Brandt ML "I was
