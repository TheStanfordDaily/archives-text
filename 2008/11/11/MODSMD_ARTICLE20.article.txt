# A 						military salute to football
## 
### 
Football and the military have
long been linked.
From West Point's first college
football championship in 1914, to the
995 NFL members who served dur
ing World War 11, 26 of whom never
made it home; from all-time great
quarterback Roger Staubach serving
in Vietnam to All-Pro safety Pat Till
man putting aside a lucrative career
to serve in Afghanistan, where he
was subsequently killed, an indelible
connection between America's pas
sion for a game and Americans' love
for their country was forged long ago
and persists to this day.
In the modern day, with wars rag
ing on two fronts, the military's in
volvement in football has remained
omnipresent. While we recognize
and applaud all members of our
armed forces, this is still a sports col
umn. As such, it must retain some rel
evance to athletics. So on this Tues
day, Nov. 11 — otherwise known as
Veterans Day — it's important to
recognize the members of today's
NFL community who have defended
our freedom at home and abroad.
Just yesterday, Tennessee Titans
fullback Ahmard Hall, along with
thousands of his closest brothers, cel
ebrated the Marines Corps' 233 rd
birthday. Hall served in Kosovo and
Afghanistan before enrolling at the
University of Texas and going on to
play in the NFL.
Running back Mike Anderson,
who was with the Baltimore Ravens
until last February, won the 2000
Rookie of the Year award as a mem
ber of the Denver Broncos—just
four years after completing a career
in the Marines that took him to both
Kenya and Somalia.
Even after his release from the Ti
tans in July, defensive end Bryce
Fisher was still employed — as a cap
tain in the National Guard. His fel
low National Guardsman, line
backer Robert McCune — who was
among the Ravens' final roster cuts
in 2008 — entered the military after
high school and was stationed in
both Kuwait and Korea.
The Houston Texans' C.C.
Brown, who has been with the team
since 2005, was a National Guards
man until last November. In fact.
Brown, a sixth-round pick in 2005,
fell in the draft because teams were
scared that he would be called into
duty in Afghanistan. He never went,
yet participated in the National
Guard until his service obligation
was complete.
Players aren't the only members
of the NFL community who have
served,
Mike Sweatman, the former New
York Giants' special teams coach
and the 2005 Special Teams Coach of
the Year, spent 26 years in the Ma
rine Corps Reserve after his four
years of active duty. His former ap
prentice, Mike Priefer, now the
Kansas City Chiefs' special teams
coach, was a Navy helicopter pilot
and officer stationed primarily in the
Persian Gulf. And Larry Zierlein.the
Pittsburgh Steelers' offensive line
coach, served a tour of duty in Viet
nam.
While some players and coaches
have had these experiences, and
many others have relatives who have
served, much of NFL community
does not have a specific tie to the mil
itary. Yet new connections are con
stantly being made. Take the New
York Giants, for example. In full dis
closure, I am a diehard supporter of
Big Blue. But in this case, my ram
pant homerism reminded me of a
beautiful story that was the influence
for this column.
It is the tale of one Army Lieu
tenant Colonel Greg Gadson. Gad
son was serving in Iraq in 2007 when
a roadside bomb tore off both of his
legs. He returned to the States, where
his former West Point football team
mate, Mike Sullivan, came to see
him. Sullivan, now the Giants' wide
receivers coach, arranged for Gad
son to attend a game.
If the story ended there, it would
still be touching. But it didn't. At this
point, the Giants were 0-2 and facing
a tough NFC East opponent, the
Washington Redskins. In the NFL's

toughest division, falling to 0-3 will
all but end your season, so this con
test was of the utmost importance. It
happened to be the game that Gad
son attended, but he did more than
just watch — he addressed the Gi
ants the night before kickoff.
In an interview with the New
York Daily News in January, he said.
"I just spoke from the heart, as a sol
dier and as a former football player,
for about 10 or 15 minutes. I talked to
them about appreciating the oppor
tunities in their lives, how special and
privileged they were, how everybody
needs to understand what they truly
have."

won. and all of a sudden, the team's
season had life. Gadson became the
Giants' biggest fan — and the feel
ing was mutual. By January, New
York found itself in the NFC Cham
pionship game and Gadson was
made an honorary co-captain.
When the Giants faced off against
the New England Patriots in the
Super Bowl, Gadson spoke to the
team the night before. And he was

right there on the sidelines during
the game, cheering from his wheel
chair.
After the Giants pulled off the
shocking upset, Gadson was in the
locker room, celebrating with his
team. He received a Super Bowl
ring, and when the Giants met with
President George W. Bush in April.
Gadson was there as well, standing
on new prosthetics and shaking
hands with his commander-in-chief.
To the soldiers-turned-players,
soldiers-turned-coaches, soldiers
turned-inspirational role models and
soldiers of all stripes across the coun
try and overseas, we salute you.
Happy Veterans Day.

Stanford community will join him in

Rookie of the Year award as a mem
ber of the Denver Broncos—just
four years after completing a career
in the Marines that took him to both
Kenya and Somalia.
Even after his release from the Ti
tans in July, defensive end Bryce
Fisher was still employed — as a cap
tain in the National Guard. His fel
low National Guardsman, line
backer Robert McCune — who was
among the Ravens' final roster cuts
in 2008 — entered the military after
high school and was stationed in
both Kuwait and Korea.
The Houston Texans' C.C.
Brown, who has been with the team
since 2005, was a National Guards
man until last November. In fact.
Brown, a sixth-round pick in 2005,
fell in the draft because teams were
scared that he would be called into
duty in Afghanistan. He never went,
yet participated in the National
Guard until his service obligation
was complete.
Players aren't the only members
of the NFL community who have
served,
Mike Sweatman, the former New
York Giants' special teams coach
and the 2005 Special Teams Coach of
the Year, spent 26 years in the Ma
rine Corps Reserve after his four
years of active duty. His former ap
prentice, Mike Priefer, now the
Kansas City Chiefs' special teams
coach, was a Navy helicopter pilot
and officer stationed primarily in the
Persian Gulf. And Larry Zierlein.the
Pittsburgh Steelers' offensive line
coach, served a tour of duty in Viet
nam.
While some players and coaches
have had these experiences, and
many others have relatives who have
served, much of NFL community
does not have a specific tie to the mil
itary. Yet new connections are con
stantly being made. Take the New
York Giants, for example. In full dis
closure, I am a diehard supporter of
Big Blue. But in this case, my ram
pant homerism reminded me of a
beautiful story that was the influence
for this column.
It is the tale of one Army Lieu
tenant Colonel Greg Gadson. Gad
son was serving in Iraq in 2007 when
a roadside bomb tore off both of his
legs. He returned to the States, where
his former West Point football team
mate, Mike Sullivan, came to see
him. Sullivan, now the Giants' wide
receivers coach, arranged for Gad
son to attend a game.
If the story ended there, it would
still be touching. But it didn't. At this
point, the Giants were 0-2 and facing
a tough NFC East opponent, the
Washington Redskins. In the NFL's

toughest division, falling to 0-3 will
all but end your season, so this con
test was of the utmost importance. It
happened to be the game that Gad
son attended, but he did more than
just watch — he addressed the Gi
ants the night before kickoff.
In an interview with the New
York Daily News in January, he said.
"I just spoke from the heart, as a sol
dier and as a former football player,
for about 10 or 15 minutes. I talked to
them about appreciating the oppor
tunities in their lives, how special and
privileged they were, how everybody
needs to understand what they truly
have."
His message worked: New York

Football and
the military have
long been linked

won. and all of a sudden, the team's
season had life. Gadson became the
Giants' biggest fan — and the feel
ing was mutual. By January, New
York found itself in the NFC Cham
pionship game and Gadson was
made an honorary co-captain.
When the Giants faced off against
the New England Patriots in the
Super Bowl, Gadson spoke to the
team the night before. And he was

right there on the sidelines during
the game, cheering from his wheel
chair.
After the Giants pulled off the
shocking upset, Gadson was in the
locker room, celebrating with his
team. He received a Super Bowl
ring, and when the Giants met with
President George W. Bush in April.
Gadson was there as well, standing
on new prosthetics and shaking
hands with his commander-in-chief.
To the soldiers-turned-players,
soldiers-turned-coaches, soldiers
turned-inspirational role models and
soldiers of all stripes across the coun
try and overseas, we salute you.
Happy Veterans Day.

Stanford community will join him in
thanking those who serve our country.
