## Stanford finds inspiration in losses 
### ZOE LEAVITT 
Despite winning seven matches on Saturday. Stan
ford wrestling faced defeat in its first two dual meets to
open the season. The Cardinal fell to Navy,27-1 l.and to
Cal State Bakersfield, 28-13.
All of the Cardinal wrestlers put up good fights, and
many only let the competition get to them in the final
few minutes of their matches. Navy immediately took
the lead in the first 125-pound bout with a major deci
sion. only for sophomore Porfirio Madrigal to narrow
the score to a one-point deficit in the second bout with
a major-decision victory at 133 pounds. But the Cardi
nal could never quite catch up. despite winning three
more matches throughout the course of the dual.
Injuries forced the Cardinal to forfeit its heavy
weight matches, costing the team valuable points.
Though the wrestlers didn't let on. the team knew it was
short a few valuable competitors and it would have to
make do without a heavyweight, essentially wrestling
from behind all night. Each wrestler put forth a strong
effort and ended the day with several striking perform
ances.
Madrigal earned eight points for his team on the day,
beating both his Navy and Bakersfield opponents by
major decision. I le was the only Cardinal wrestler to win
both of his matches that day. Madrigal is one of the
team's younger wrestlers, and first-year head coach
Jason Borrelli chalked up his wins to superior motiva
tion.
"[ WJhen he goes out there he's going to wrestle hard
for seven minutes," Borrelli said. "Sometimes the other
guy just gives up before you do."
True freshmen Nick Amuchastegui wrestling at 165
pounds and Victor Haug at 174 pounds achieved their
first dual wins. Amuchastegui defeated his Navy oppo

nent bv major decision with an 11-1 score. While Uaug
lost his first match against the Midshipmen 11-1. he
came back with a vengeance against Bakersfield's Sea
mus Dean in his first conference match of the season.
Though he had to move up a weight class to 184 pounds,
he still beat his opponent with an 11-8 decision.
While Madrigal believes he still has a lot to work on.
including leg attacks, his performances this weekend
bode well for his season goals of becoming a Pacific-10
Conference champion and "bringing home some gold
hardware from the NCAA Championships."
Though sophomore Max Rosefigura lost his first
match against Navy's Bryce Saddoris, ranked No. IS in
the nation, he was not discouraged. Against Bakers
field's Sam Barnhart. Rosefigura battled to the last to
score two points on a takedown in the third period to
win 6-5.
Other Cardinal wrestlers also rallied in the third pe
riods of their matches — No. 20 Lucas Espericueta
managed a takedown with only one second remaining
to come back against Bakersfield for the redshirt
sophomore's first win of the season. Unfortunately for
the Cardinal. Navy and Bakersfield wrestlers also
staged dramatic comebacks in a number of the match
es. Faltering at several key moments proved fatal for
Stanford.
But Borrelli remained optimistic, despite the Cardi
nal's tough start to the year.
"It excites me that the guys are upset about losing."
he said. "You never want people to be content with [los
ing]. You never want them to settle. Now they've come
in for their workouts with a great attitude, they are real
ly cranking down."
The team knows that although the truly meaningful
matches won't start until the Pac-10 Championships,set
ting the right tone in the dual-meet season could be cru

cial going forward and that the duals provide an accu
rate measure of where the team is and what needs im
provement.
"These matches [are] a measuring stick of how pre
pared [we are] for the beginning of the season." Madri
gal said.
This weekend's matches highlighted some weakness
es that the team must focus on throughout the coming
weeks. While all the wrestlers have greatly improved
their fitness levels since practice started. Saturday made
clear that the technical aspects need work.The team will
need to hone its skills on the mat in the top and bottom
positions and practice maintaining its focus throughout
the whole seven minutes, avoiding the small mistakes at
the end that can wind up costing the match or even the
dual.
"[Practice] has made us tougher, because even as we
work harder, we are making it look easier by never
showing weakness." said junior captain Jake Johnson,
who scored a third-period victory against Navy on Sat
urday.
Such composure in the face of difficulty should serve
the team well, especially as many members have faced
bigger or older opponents.
"The things that were frustrating were the mistakes
on the technical aspects, technical mistakes in some
areas that we work on hard." Borrelli said. "Getting a
first varsity match out of the way is important, especial
ly for a team with only one senior. Now we just have to
keep drilling."
With several more practices before the team's next
match-up. the Cardinal hopes to learn from its mistakes
and polish its skills. Stanford will face the Wyoming
Cowboys in Laramie. Wyo.. Friday night at 5 p.m. MT.
