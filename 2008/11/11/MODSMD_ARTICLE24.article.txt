Men's basketball
dominant in exhibitions
The Stanford men's basketball team sailed
through two preseason tune-ups this week in con
vincing fashion. In the Cardinal's first action with
out former head coach Trent Johnson (now at
LSU) or Brook and Robin Lopez down low (both
are now in the NBA), Stanford dominated Cal
State-Stanislaus last Tuesday night by the final
score of 93-54.The Stanford men followed that up
by rolling on against Seattle Pacific on Saturday
— which competes in the Great Northwest Ath
letic Conference — and earning another easv win.
97-54.
Against Seattle Pacific, junior guard Landry
Fields and sophomore forward Josh Owens led the
Cardinal with 17 points each. Fields was also a key
performer against Cal State-Stanislaus, scoring 24
points in just IN minutes. Fields was closely followed
in that game by senior guard Anthony Goods, who
chipped in l l ) points in 20 minutes.
Owens, meanwhile, saw limited playing time last
season, but is a gifted athlete who will be expected
to help fill the void left by the departure of the
Lopez twins. Senior Lawrence 11 ill also had a strong
game and dominated on the glass, grabbing 13 re
bounds. Freshman Jeremy Green, a 6-foot-4 guard,
added 12 points. Green, an Austin. Tex. product, is
quickly making a good impression on his team
mates.
Though the statistics from Stanford's two exhibi
tion victories do not count towards season totals, the
losses could be significant: Last year, the Cardinal
suffered a 79-67 to Siena in exhibition. The team
hopes to avoid another early-season disappoint
ment when it opens the regular season against Yale
in New Haven. Conn, on Friday. Tip-off is set for 4
p.m. PL
