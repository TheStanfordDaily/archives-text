# Polo gets win, loss on SoCal road trip
## Stanford men fall to No. 7 UCSB but beat Pepperdine 
### KENAN JIANG STAFF WRITER 
The No. 2 Stanford men's water
polo team played through a pair of
gritty. Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration (MPSF) matches over the
weekend against No. 5 Pepperdine
and No. 7 UC-Santa Barbara. The
Cardinal shut down Pepperdine in a
9-4 victory, but lost to the Gauchos
on the road in a 5-4 heartbreaker to
split the weekend's competition.
Despite the upset. Stanford is still
21-3 for the season — the other two
losses came against No. 1 USC. The
loss against UCSB was particularly
important because it was an MPSF
conference game — and only the
MPSF champion receives an auto
matic berth to the Final Four of the
NCAA Tournament. With the loss to
UCSB. Stanford's eight-game win
ning streak was snapped.
On Saturday in Malibu. Stan
ford's tough defense led to plenty of
scoring opportunities for the Cardi
nal. The team capitalized often and
showed off its offensive depth. Junior
Sage Wright and seniors Will Hindle-
Katel and Chris Jacobson scored two
goals each: freshman Jacob Smith,
redshirt sophomore Cody Wiesen
and junior Janson Wigo — the
team's leading scorer — each con
tributed one goal. Hindle-Katel
began the scoring at 2:17 in the first
period, but Pepperdine scored 16
seconds later to tie the game at one.
Wigo and Jacobson each responded
with a goal before the end of the first

period to put the Cardinal up 3-1.
Once again. Pepperdine came
back and tied the score at three with
4:39 to plav in the first half. But Stan
ford again answered the bell, as
freshman Jacob Smith scored with

-1:46 left to go before halftime.
In the second half, the Cardinal
men completely shut down the
Waves* offensive rhythm, while
goals from Wright. Jacobson. Wiesen
and Hindle-Katel extended their

lead to 9-4.
Stanford's defense was solid early
on, allowing only three goals with
4:39 remaining in the first half. In the
second half, the Cardinal clamped
down even tighter and stopped Pep

perdine from getting any clear op
portunities at the goal — the Waves
only scored once in the second half.
Redshirt junior and captain Jinimie
Sandman anchored the defense with
eight saves in another confident
showing. Sandman's consistency in
goal has become the core of Stan
ford's tough defense all season.
The Cardinal then traveled to
UCSB on Sunday and left with a
tough loss. It was an emotional victo
ry for the No. 7 UCSB squad. 'ITic
Gauchos are now 15-<S and 4-2 in the
MPSF and have upset Stanford for
the second straight year in confer
ence play.
Stanford's downfall was its inabil
ity to capitalize on two six-on-five
power plays in the last four minutes.
UCSB went up 5-4 with 4:40 left to
play, and Stanford was unable to
break through in the final period.
Sage Wright had two goals, and
Jacob Smith and junior Drac Wigo
both contributed one score each. But
Stanford — averaging 12 goals per
game coming into the match
could not find its offensive rhythm
and allowed UCSB to hold onto a
small lead in the waning minutes of
the match.
Stanford started the scoring when
Drac Wigo scored on a five-meter
penalty shot to give the Cardinal a 1 -
0 lead. UCSB responded quickly
with a goal off of a six-on-five advan
tage less than a minute later to tie the
score. The Gauchos had nine power
plays and were able to capitalize on
four of them: Stanford had 11 man
up advantages but only converted
one — a testament to both UCSB's
strong effort on defense and Stan
ford's offensive rut.
The Gauchos led 4-2 at halftime.

UCSB on Sunday and left with a
tough loss. It was an emotional victo
ry for the No. 7 UCSB squad. 'ITic
Gauchos are now 15-<S and 4-2 in the
MPSF and have upset Stanford for
the second straight year in confer
ence play.
Stanford's downfall was its inabil
ity to capitalize on two six-on-five
power plays in the last four minutes.
UCSB went up 5-4 with 4:40 left to
play, and Stanford was unable to
break through in the final period.
Sage Wright had two goals, and
Jacob Smith and junior Drac Wigo
both contributed one score each. But
Stanford — averaging 12 goals per
game coming into the match
could not find its offensive rhythm
and allowed UCSB to hold onto a
small lead in the waning minutes of
the match.
Stanford started the scoring when
Drac Wigo scored on a five-meter
penalty shot to give the Cardinal a 1 -
0 lead. UCSB responded quickly
with a goal off of a six-on-five advan
tage less than a minute later to tie the
score. The Gauchos had nine power
plays and were able to capitalize on
four of them: Stanford had 11 man
up advantages but only converted
one — a testament to both UCSB's
strong effort on defense and Stan
ford's offensive rut.
The Gauchos led 4-2 at halftime.
but Smith and Wright powered home

a disappointing loss to the No. 7 UCSB Gauchos. The Card will try to rebound this weekend when it hosts USC.
