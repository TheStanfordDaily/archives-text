cate] the student body about
Bangladesh's potential."
Based on the si/e of the anony
mous gilt, the GSB currently plans
to offer the program lor the 2009-
2010 academic year only.
The CiSB estimated that the cost
of one year in the MBA program

ini» fees, both of which are covered

by the scholarships.
I hose applying to the Grameen

pre-application pool on the basis of
"merit, financial need and commit
ment to developing Bangladesh."
The number of finalists seeks to
ensure that "we have a pretty
healthy pool of applicants,"
Giannangeli said.
Finalists will then fill out the reg
ular application for the Stanford
MBA program. From the pool of
finalists, two fellows and two alter
nates will be chosen.
Because demonstrated financial

need is one of the factors in the
admission process, no partial schol
arships will be awarded.
The GSB is working with
Grameen Bank to advertise the pro
gram in Bangladesh.
According to Giannangeli, the
bank has reached out to Grameen
employees, the children of its bor
rowers and recipients of its own
undergraduate scholarship pro

expressed interest in the MBA pro
gram.
