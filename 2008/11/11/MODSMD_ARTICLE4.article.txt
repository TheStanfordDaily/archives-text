# ELECTION '08
## Community, students rally against 8 Church-goers join protest against controversial prop. 
### MARISA LANDICHO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Five grandmothers in makeshift wed
ding dresses belted out a revised rendition
of "Here Comes the Bride" in a protest
against Proposition 8 on Monday evening.
Backed up by an ukulele and lit only by

candlelight, these unorthodox brides
ended the familiar song with the line,
'"What does it matter who marries
whom?"
Over 300 people gathered at the inter
section of Embarcadero and El Camino
for a candlelight vigil organized by the
women's activist group the Raging
Grannies, as well as the Santa Clara
County Council of Churches.
Unlike many other protests against the
recently passed Prop. S, the candlelight
vigil was sponsored by religious groups.

Many attendees sported both their church
affiliation and rainbow paraphernalia.
"It's incongruous that churches would
not stand up for civil rights and support
people who want to be in loving, commit
ted relationships," said Reverend Diana
Gibson, co-director of the Council and one
of the main organizers of the event.
On Monday night, separate vigils were
held at six other locations across the coun
ty.

Student protesters join community members at the corner of Embarcadero and El Camino for a candlelight vigil in protest of Proposition
8. The recently passed proposition took away the right for same-sex couples to marry, leading to sustained opposition from some groups.
Although the more visible pro
ponents of Prop. 8 have belonged to
certain religious organizations, vari
ous churches have publicly
denounced the proposition and are
still fighting against it.
According to Gibson, more
churches were moving toward sup
porting gay rights. When the Council
took out an ad in a newspaper, 25
churches signed on in support.
"I'd like to affirm that not all
faith communities are for Prop. 8,"
said Claire Heinzelman, a member
of the Ladera Community Church
branch of the United Church of
Christ (IJCC). Hein/elman said 15
percent of the UCC-affiliated
churches were open and welcoming
to the LGBT community.
Mike and Susan Owicki. both
members of the Unitarian

Universalist Church of Palo Alto,
attended the candlelight vigil in
matching anti-Prop. 8 shirts.
"One of our principles is the
inherent worth and dignity of every
person," Susan Owicki said. "We
just wanted to let people know
there are more people who are
unhappy."
The crowd, holding signs and
candles, tended to he far older than
the Stanford population.
Second-year chemistry graduate
student Brian Loy was one of the
few students who made the trek up
to Town and Country Village. Loy
had worked at three phone banks
to urge voters to vote down Prop. 8,
and after the measure passed, felt
that people needed to rally against
it.
"It's important to put a face on
the issue, to show that your 'yes' has
impacted my life." Loy said. "Our
generation hasn't really stood up
yet. and I think this is the civil rights
issue of our time."
Although not many students

attended, the youngest generation
was well-represented, as attendees
brought along children and grand
children. A few young boys joined
the Raging Grannies in song, while
others played with miniature rain
bow flags.
Stefania Pomponi Butler, a
neighborhood resident and creator
of the political Web site momoc
rats.com, lit candles for daughters
Anouk, age six, and Wallie, age
four.
Anouk carried a sign with the
message, "Boys can marry boys,"
which she had drawn herself.
Pomponi Butler had taken the girls
to past rallies, but had to explain to
her daughters that they had to keep
fighting the proposition.
"Tonight, I'm noticing more
beeps and honks than before the
proposition passed." she said. "I'm
just wondering where these people
were on Election Day."
