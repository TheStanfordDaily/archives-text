Five grandmothers in makeshift wed
ding dresses belted out a revised rendition
of "Here Comes the Bride" in a protest
against Proposition 8 on Monday evening.
Backed up by an ukulele and lit only by

candlelight, these unorthodox brides
ended the familiar song with the line,
'"What does it matter who marries
whom?"
Over 300 people gathered at the inter
section of Embarcadero and El Camino
for a candlelight vigil organized by the
women's activist group the Raging
Grannies, as well as the Santa Clara
County Council of Churches.
Unlike many other protests against the
recently passed Prop. S, the candlelight
vigil was sponsored by religious groups.

Many attendees sported both their church
affiliation and rainbow paraphernalia.
"It's incongruous that churches would
not stand up for civil rights and support
people who want to be in loving, commit
ted relationships," said Reverend Diana
Gibson, co-director of the Council and one
of the main organizers of the event.
On Monday night, separate vigils were
held at six other locations across the coun
ty.

Student protesters join community members at the corner of Embarcadero and El Camino for a candlelight vigil in protest of Proposition
8. The recently passed proposition took away the right for same-sex couples to marry, leading to sustained opposition from some groups.
