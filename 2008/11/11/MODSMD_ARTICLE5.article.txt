# High food prices cost campus
## Dining avoids cutbacks while others adjust bills 
### AN LE NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As high food costs take their toll on col
lege campuses. Stanford eateries are
responding to increased prices in a variety of
ways.
According to Eric Montell, executive
director of Stanford Dining, the largest
spikes in food prices have occurred in the last
six to eight months. In spite of these changes.
Dining has worked to maintain the same
quality of service for its customers.
"Stanford Dining has not changed the
menu, portions, offerings, selections, high
quality, name brands, service or service hours
for meal plan students due to the rising food
prices." Montell said in an email to The Daily.
"This is in contrast to other schools that have
eliminated trays, reduced choices, substituted
chicken thighs for chicken breasts, removed
menu items and reduced service hours to off
set the increase in prices."
Stanford houses and eating clubs are
using different approaches to deal with the
problem of skyrocketing food costs. Narnia
Kitchen Manager Mark Murphy '09 said
soaring prices have not caused major cut
backs in the amount of food provided.
Rather, the rising costs have been met with
an increase in student expenditures.
"It doesn't really pose a problem to the
running of the house." Murphy said. "It's just
an increase in the board bill, basically."
Sven Hinrichsen *10. Narnia house man
ager. added that many residents do not feel
the economic pinch of high food prices,
because everyone shares the total cost.
"The necessary extra amount of money
that we need is just dispersed throughout 62
residents," Hinrichsen said, "so it's not really
a big toll on everyone."
At the Toyon Ealing C'lubs. however, the
situation is quite different. Toyon took the
alternative route of cutting down students'
board bills and reducing its eating club staff
from nine to five.
"We don't want to pass on the food cost to
students, so we're sort of buckling down."
said Natasha Chu '10. general manager. "We
don't order a lot of excess, and we don't
waste food."
"Basically, I will have to cut hack on a few things,"
added Toyon chef Christina Cruz. "We want students to
have the products that they want but still regulate the
cost."
In part, this entails being more selective when pur
chasing food.

"We still have enough
food, but we probably have
less variety in terms of veg
etables," Chu explained.
"We just don't have all of it
out at once."
Having worked as the
chef at Narnia for the past
seven years, Mike Ryan has
also noticed changes in
food availability and costs.
"The budget is not that
tight," he said. "But, I've
noticed a dramatic increase
in the produce prices
because of transportation."
Yet the instability of oil
and transportation costs is
just part of the picture.
According to the United
States Department of
Agriculture, the recent

surge in food prices is caused by a host of factors — an
increased global demand for food, a growing amount of
U.S. agricultural exports, a weaker U.S. dollar and unfa
vorable weather conditions have all contributed to
uncommonly high food prices. In addition, the produc
tion of ethanol and biodiesel has diverted some com
modities. such as corn, away from food consumption
purposes. Consumers simply shoulder the added costs.
Hence, kitchens across campus now buy supplies in
bulk.
"Ordering from Costco with an executive member

ship and in huge quantities definitely saves money."
Murphy said.
As kitchen manager. Murphy is responsible for
ordering open kitchen items, which include snacks, dry
goods and special needs-based requests. For him, week-

end runs to Whole Foods
have become the norm.
On the other hand.
Stanford Dining has miti
gated some costs by lever
aging contracts with group
purchasing organizations
(GPOs). In essence. Dining
makes deals with manufac
turers on price structures
to reduce expenditures.
"Even with these con
tracts, there is room to
increase pricing." Montell
> said, "but it generally takes
longer for us to feel the
effect."
This suggests the need
for a more concerted effort
between the eating clubs
and Stanford Dining.
"One of the most sig-

- —o
nificant improvements to
purchasing that can reduce cost and increase sustainable
efforts to the campus at large is to increase the consoli
dation of purchasing at Stanford." Montell said. "The
most logical next step would be to combine the row
house and Stanford Dining purchasing."
But with food prices slated to remain costly, no clear
cut solution is in sight.
"It is a struggle balancing the needs of running the
operations... with the rising food costs." Cruz said.
