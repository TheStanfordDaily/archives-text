As high food costs take their toll on col
lege campuses. Stanford eateries are
responding to increased prices in a variety of
ways.
According to Eric Montell, executive
director of Stanford Dining, the largest
spikes in food prices have occurred in the last
six to eight months. In spite of these changes.
Dining has worked to maintain the same
quality of service for its customers.
"Stanford Dining has not changed the
menu, portions, offerings, selections, high
quality, name brands, service or service hours
for meal plan students due to the rising food
prices." Montell said in an email to The Daily.
"This is in contrast to other schools that have
eliminated trays, reduced choices, substituted
chicken thighs for chicken breasts, removed
menu items and reduced service hours to off
set the increase in prices."
Stanford houses and eating clubs are
using different approaches to deal with the
problem of skyrocketing food costs. Narnia
Kitchen Manager Mark Murphy '09 said
soaring prices have not caused major cut
backs in the amount of food provided.
Rather, the rising costs have been met with
an increase in student expenditures.
"It doesn't really pose a problem to the
running of the house." Murphy said. "It's just
an increase in the board bill, basically."
Sven Hinrichsen *10. Narnia house man
ager. added that many residents do not feel
the economic pinch of high food prices,
because everyone shares the total cost.
"The necessary extra amount of money
that we need is just dispersed throughout 62
residents," Hinrichsen said, "so it's not really
a big toll on everyone."
At the Toyon Ealing C'lubs. however, the
situation is quite different. Toyon took the
alternative route of cutting down students'
board bills and reducing its eating club staff
from nine to five.
"We don't want to pass on the food cost to
students, so we're sort of buckling down."
said Natasha Chu '10. general manager. "We
don't order a lot of excess, and we don't
waste food."
