## In class and online? Examining laptop usage in the classroom 
### VICTOR LIU 
At any given time in any given lecture on
this campus, it's a pretty safe bet that some
one is using a laptop to browse Facebook or
to instant message faraway friends. At the
same time, however, other students take
notes by hand, while some even use their lap
tops to look up additional information on lec
ture material.
In large lectures, students using their lap
tops for purposes unrelated to note-taking
can influence the learning ability of sur
rounding students.
"They're a major distraction." said Kaitlin
Louie *11 ."When you see people using email.
Facebook, You Tube. shopping online or
reading the newspaper online, you end up
doinii it. too."

Even though she considers laptops dis
tracting. Louie admits that she still has to use
a laptop in class because the lectures go by
too quickly to take down notes by hand.
In contrast.Travis Lehman '09 isn't both
ered by the use of laptops in class.
"About half the students in my lectures
use it for work." Lehman said of his econom
ics and history classes. "Some people think
that there should be a boundary between the
classroom and the outside world, but Stan
ford encourages well-rounded students and
sometimes it's necessary to stay connected to
activities outside the classroom, especially
since the entire campus is wireless."
Students and professors alike are in a
sticky situation because of the potential for
laptops to either distract or further engage
students. Every day.students make the choice

to bring their laptops to class or to leave their
electronics in their dorm rooms. Once in
class, the students make the choice to pay at
tention to the lecture or distract themselves.
As may be expected, laptops are consid
ered more of a hindrance in small classes and
sections where discussion is an integral part
of the lesson.
"[They] inhibit conversations and create a
barrier preventing the free flow of ideas," said
John Lindsay *12.
And don't think teachers aren't aware
that students may not always be using laptops
just to take notes.
"It's easy to tell what sites students are
using from the glow of their laptops in a dark
lecture hall." said Kelly McGonigal, the
course coordinator for Psych 1.
Some professors have banned the use of

laptops in their classes, while others embrace
the potential teaching benefits.
Because of their potential to be so dis
tracting, Structured Liberal Education
(SLE) Resident Fellow Professor Greg
Watkins believes that students should refrain
from taking notes on laptops during lecture.
"Personally. I think it would be better if
students paid attention to the lecture without
taking notes and then took notes after the
lecture," he said.
Watkins also outlined SLE's new laptop
policy.
"Students are only allowed to use laptops
to take notes during lectures, and they are
banned in discussions," Watkins said. "Before
this year, about 30 to 40 percent of students
used laptops in class."
Louie agrees that allowing laptops in class

hut limiting the Internet is something worth
considering. SLK Fellow Rashi Jackman, on
the other hand, is interested in this method
hut questions "how it would he enforced."
While the second lecture of Psych 1 fo
cused on showing students statistics regard
ing negative effects of using laptops in the
classroom for outside activities, the class has
strayed away from advocating a uniform pol
icy so that students can make the ultimate de
cision for themselves.
"We think that banning laptops entirely


LAURA CHANG/The Stanford Daily
from lectures would be too extreme,"
McGonigal said. "We show students
the information and give them the
choice. I do empathize with students
when they use email or Facebook. It
feels wrong not having email open
and even faculty members have mul
tiple windows open all the time."
Still, she added. "Outside research
has shown that students who use lap
tops for activities other than note-tak
ing get a lower grade. There is less re
tention of the material and it's as bad
as not going to class at all."
Other faculty members are com
pletely comfortable with students
using laptops in class.

"It doesn't bother me at all that stu
dents use laptops or pen computer de
viees — whatever works for them is
fine," said Math Professor Leon
Simon, who noted that laptop usage in
his classes has increased in the past two
years.
Richard Holeton, head of Student
Computing, said that if laptops were
banned from classrooms, students
would find alternative means of dis
tracting themselves.
"Students would bring actual print
newspapers to read in class," he said.
In the face of the inevitability of
students finding ways to distract them
selves, an alternative to lamenting the
use of laptops is to try to harness their
teaching potential.
Watkins was pleasantly surprised
to see that aside from instant messag
ing and other activities not related to
lecture, students were actually using

Wikipedia to track down references
that the lecturers made.
"I'm interested in how new tech
nology is making its way into learn
ing." he said.
In fact. Holeton said that laptop
usage in large lectures could promote
student participation if implemented
correctly.
"According to research on learn
ing, even texting and instant messag
ing to friends about the lecture during
the lecture itself is more beneficial
than not participating at all," he said.
"Professors and lecturers should put
more effort into drawing students
into the lecture by using new technol
ogy"
For example, Holeton suggested
having instant quizzes online during
large lectures to gauge students' un
derstanding of the material in real
time. He also suggested having stu

dents send questions to t he TAs or lec
turers via instant messaging, as he said
that this would increase active and so
cial learning in large lectures.
Ricardo Corona '12. who uses a
tablet PC for class, believes that mak
ing certain lectures more tablet-friend
ly and expanding the use of SMAR T
boards — interactive, electronic
whiteboards — would also be benefi
cial.
"Recording lectures using
SMART boards would facilitate the
School of Engineering's Stanford En
gineering Everywhere program,"
Corona added.
Rather than becoming the ene
mies, technology and the Internet
might end up being teachers' — and
students' — best classroom tool.

Facebook, You Tube. shopping online or
reading the newspaper online, you end up
doinii it. too."

Even though she considers laptops dis
tracting. Louie admits that she still has to use
a laptop in class because the lectures go by
too quickly to take down notes by hand.
In contrast.Travis Lehman '09 isn't both
ered by the use of laptops in class.
"About half the students in my lectures
use it for work." Lehman said of his econom
ics and history classes. "Some people think
that there should be a boundary between the
classroom and the outside world, but Stan
ford encourages well-rounded students and
sometimes it's necessary to stay connected to
activities outside the classroom, especially
since the entire campus is wireless."
Students and professors alike are in a
sticky situation because of the potential for
laptops to either distract or further engage
students. Every day.students make the choice

to bring their laptops to class or to leave their
electronics in their dorm rooms. Once in
class, the students make the choice to pay at
tention to the lecture or distract themselves.
As may be expected, laptops are consid
ered more of a hindrance in small classes and
sections where discussion is an integral part
of the lesson.
"[They] inhibit conversations and create a
barrier preventing the free flow of ideas," said
John Lindsay *12.
And don't think teachers aren't aware
that students may not always be using laptops
just to take notes.
"It's easy to tell what sites students are
using from the glow of their laptops in a dark
lecture hall." said Kelly McGonigal, the
course coordinator for Psych 1.
Some professors have banned the use of

laptops in their classes, while others embrace
the potential teaching benefits.
Because of their potential to be so dis
tracting, Structured Liberal Education
(SLE) Resident Fellow Professor Greg
Watkins believes that students should refrain
from taking notes on laptops during lecture.
"Personally. I think it would be better if
students paid attention to the lecture without
taking notes and then took notes after the
lecture," he said.
Watkins also outlined SLE's new laptop
policy.
"Students are only allowed to use laptops
to take notes during lectures, and they are
banned in discussions," Watkins said. "Before
this year, about 30 to 40 percent of students
used laptops in class."
Louie agrees that allowing laptops in class

hut limiting the Internet is something worth
considering. SLK Fellow Rashi Jackman, on
the other hand, is interested in this method
hut questions "how it would he enforced."
While the second lecture of Psych 1 fo
cused on showing students statistics regard
ing negative effects of using laptops in the
classroom for outside activities, the class has
strayed away from advocating a uniform pol
icy so that students can make the ultimate de
cision for themselves.
"We think that banning laptops entirely

from lectures would be too extreme,"
McGonigal said. "We show students
the information and give them the
choice. I do empathize with students
when they use email or Facebook. It
feels wrong not having email open
and even faculty members have mul
tiple windows open all the time."
Still, she added. "Outside research
has shown that students who use lap
tops for activities other than note-tak
ing get a lower grade. There is less re
tention of the material and it's as bad
as not going to class at all."
Other faculty members are com
pletely comfortable with students
using laptops in class.

"It doesn't bother me at all that stu
dents use laptops or pen computer de
viees — whatever works for them is
fine," said Math Professor Leon
Simon, who noted that laptop usage in
his classes has increased in the past two
years.
Richard Holeton, head of Student
Computing, said that if laptops were
banned from classrooms, students
would find alternative means of dis
tracting themselves.
"Students would bring actual print
newspapers to read in class," he said.
In the face of the inevitability of
students finding ways to distract them
selves, an alternative to lamenting the
use of laptops is to try to harness their
teaching potential.
Watkins was pleasantly surprised
to see that aside from instant messag
ing and other activities not related to
lecture, students were actually using

Wikipedia to track down references
that the lecturers made.
"I'm interested in how new tech
nology is making its way into learn
ing." he said.
In fact. Holeton said that laptop
usage in large lectures could promote
student participation if implemented
correctly.
"According to research on learn
ing, even texting and instant messag
ing to friends about the lecture during
the lecture itself is more beneficial
than not participating at all," he said.
"Professors and lecturers should put
more effort into drawing students
into the lecture by using new technol
ogy"
For example, Holeton suggested
having instant quizzes online during
large lectures to gauge students' un
derstanding of the material in real
time. He also suggested having stu

dents send questions to t he TAs or lec
turers via instant messaging, as he said
that this would increase active and so
cial learning in large lectures.
Ricardo Corona '12. who uses a
tablet PC for class, believes that mak
ing certain lectures more tablet-friend
ly and expanding the use of SMAR T
boards — interactive, electronic
whiteboards — would also be benefi
cial.
"Recording lectures using
SMART boards would facilitate the
School of Engineering's Stanford En
gineering Everywhere program,"
Corona added.
Rather than becoming the ene
mies, technology and the Internet
might end up being teachers' — and
students' — best classroom tool.
