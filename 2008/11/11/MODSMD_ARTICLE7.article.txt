## In class and online? Examining laptop usage in the classroom 
### VICTOR LIU 
At any given time in any given lecture on
this campus, it's a pretty safe bet that some
one is using a laptop to browse Facebook or
to instant message faraway friends. At the
same time, however, other students take
notes by hand, while some even use their lap
tops to look up additional information on lec
ture material.
In large lectures, students using their lap
tops for purposes unrelated to note-taking
can influence the learning ability of sur
rounding students.
"They're a major distraction." said Kaitlin
Louie *11 ."When you see people using email.
Facebook, You Tube. shopping online or
reading the newspaper online, you end up
doinii it. too."

Even though she considers laptops dis
tracting. Louie admits that she still has to use
a laptop in class because the lectures go by
too quickly to take down notes by hand.
In contrast.Travis Lehman '09 isn't both
ered by the use of laptops in class.
"About half the students in my lectures
use it for work." Lehman said of his econom
ics and history classes. "Some people think
that there should be a boundary between the
classroom and the outside world, but Stan
ford encourages well-rounded students and
sometimes it's necessary to stay connected to
activities outside the classroom, especially
since the entire campus is wireless."
Students and professors alike are in a
sticky situation because of the potential for
laptops to either distract or further engage
students. Every day.students make the choice

to bring their laptops to class or to leave their
electronics in their dorm rooms. Once in
class, the students make the choice to pay at
tention to the lecture or distract themselves.
As may be expected, laptops are consid
ered more of a hindrance in small classes and
sections where discussion is an integral part
of the lesson.
"[They] inhibit conversations and create a
barrier preventing the free flow of ideas," said
John Lindsay *12.
And don't think teachers aren't aware
that students may not always be using laptops
just to take notes.
"It's easy to tell what sites students are
using from the glow of their laptops in a dark
lecture hall." said Kelly McGonigal, the
course coordinator for Psych 1.
Some professors have banned the use of

laptops in their classes, while others embrace
the potential teaching benefits.
Because of their potential to be so dis
tracting, Structured Liberal Education
(SLE) Resident Fellow Professor Greg
Watkins believes that students should refrain
from taking notes on laptops during lecture.
"Personally. I think it would be better if
students paid attention to the lecture without
taking notes and then took notes after the
lecture," he said.
Watkins also outlined SLE's new laptop
policy.
"Students are only allowed to use laptops
to take notes during lectures, and they are
banned in discussions," Watkins said. "Before
this year, about 30 to 40 percent of students
used laptops in class."
Louie agrees that allowing laptops in class

hut limiting the Internet is something worth
considering. SLK Fellow Rashi Jackman, on
the other hand, is interested in this method
hut questions "how it would he enforced."
While the second lecture of Psych 1 fo
cused on showing students statistics regard
ing negative effects of using laptops in the
classroom for outside activities, the class has
strayed away from advocating a uniform pol
icy so that students can make the ultimate de
cision for themselves.
"We think that banning laptops entirely
