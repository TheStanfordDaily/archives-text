# Coming together in prayer:
## Students enter into interfaith dialogue 
### EMILY RIALS 
A few minutes before noon
on Friday, the interfaith
Sanctuary on the third
floor of Old Union is near
ly empty. A group of chairs
is set up in rows in the center of the
room; the muted lighting seems dark
compared to the bright sunshine out
side.
In the arcades. Jessica Galant '10
and Abdulkareem Agunbiade'lo
stand together, nervously looking up
and down the hallway.
*i hope people show up!" Agunbi
ade whispers.
He adds, a moment later, "A lot of
people in our community are really ex
cited about tonight!"
l ime passes. Noon comes and goes.
And then, suddenly, the space out
side the Sanctuary is full of people —
students and older community mem
bers, strangers and friends. Many of
them have never met before; introduc
tions are performed, smiles are
widened, laughter is easy and hands
are offered in gestures of welcome.
Two Muslim women lead a group of
Jewish students to one of the two
washing rooms set aside from the
Sanctuary. Inside, they guide the stu
dents through their familiar ritual of
cleaning before entering the Sanctu
ary. Hands three times, mouth three
times, face three times and onward
until the feet.
They explain the purpose of the
cleaning — purification before
prayer. Their instructions will be re
peated at least once more as more
people arrive; some are familiar with
the routine, some have never per
formed it before.
Inside the Sanctuary, the chairs for
merly in the center of the space have
been pushed to the side, and men and
women have formed lines on the floor,
facing east — men closer to the speak
er's podium, women closer to the back
wall. Galant enters and sits at the back
with the other women; they smile at
her as she passes. Several other Jewish
students will enter in the next moments
as the Sanctuary continues to fill.

Friday marked an important day for
Stanford's Jewish and Muslim students.
An invitation was extended by the Is
lamic Society of Stanford University
(ISSU) and the Jewish Students' Asso
ciation (.ISA) for members of their

communities to attend each other's
prayer services: Muslim students wel
comed their Jewish counterparts to Fri
day noon prayers, and Jewish students
opened their doors to the Muslim com
munity for Friday Shabbat services.
Agunbiade and Galant were two of
the students responsible for organizing
the event. Agunbiade acts as vice pres
ident of the ISSU. while Galant is the
vice president of campus relations for
the JSA.
"There are so many misunderstand
ings between religious cultures,"
Galant remarks. "But when it comes
down to it. we're asking the same ques
tions."
Two years ago. the end of Ramadan
overlapped with Yom Kippur. so Jew
ish and Muslim students came together
at a"Break Fast"event tocelebrate the
end of their respective holidays. Friday
marked the first event since that was
designed specifically to get the two
communities talking to one another
about religion.

As more and more people enter the
Sanctuary, a call to prayer is issued in
Arabic, and the speaker begins his ser
mon in English.Today he is addressing
the relationship between peace and
Islam.
When the speaker comments on the
structure of the Arabic language, in
which roots of words are made of
groups ol consonants while vowels and
varying pronunciation create multiple
individual words. Galant turns in the
semi-dark.
"Hebrew is the same way!" she
whispers, excited.
ITie speaker's sermon is split into
two parts. The structure of the service is
such that after the sermon is finished,
another call to prayer is issued, and
group prayer follows. Then, Agunbiade
walks to the front of the room. As he
shares his community announcements,
he calls attention to the visitors in as
sembly.
"Please feel free to talk to them," he
intones. "Make them feel welcome."
He reminds his audience of the in
terfaith Shabbat to be held that night at
the Koret Pavilion, then steps back
again.
As prayer ends, the room slowly
empties. In several places, however,
knots of people remain. Members of
the Jewish community linger to ask
questions — Why group prayer? What

Muslim and Jewish students gather at the Old Union Sanctuary to attend Friday's
Muslim noon prayers. The two groups exchanged invitations to each other's reli
gious services in hopes of opening the door to further interfaith communication
and understanding.
