# Coming together in prayer:
## Students enter into interfaith dialogue 
### EMILY RIALS 
A few minutes before noon
on Friday, the interfaith
Sanctuary on the third
floor of Old Union is near
ly empty. A group of chairs
is set up in rows in the center of the
room; the muted lighting seems dark
compared to the bright sunshine out
side.
In the arcades. Jessica Galant '10
and Abdulkareem Agunbiade'lo
stand together, nervously looking up
and down the hallway.
*i hope people show up!" Agunbi
ade whispers.
He adds, a moment later, "A lot of
people in our community are really ex
cited about tonight!"
l ime passes. Noon comes and goes.
And then, suddenly, the space out
side the Sanctuary is full of people —
students and older community mem
bers, strangers and friends. Many of
them have never met before; introduc
tions are performed, smiles are
widened, laughter is easy and hands
are offered in gestures of welcome.
Two Muslim women lead a group of
Jewish students to one of the two
washing rooms set aside from the
Sanctuary. Inside, they guide the stu
dents through their familiar ritual of
cleaning before entering the Sanctu
ary. Hands three times, mouth three
times, face three times and onward
until the feet.
They explain the purpose of the
cleaning — purification before
prayer. Their instructions will be re
peated at least once more as more
people arrive; some are familiar with
the routine, some have never per
formed it before.
Inside the Sanctuary, the chairs for
merly in the center of the space have
been pushed to the side, and men and
women have formed lines on the floor,
facing east — men closer to the speak
er's podium, women closer to the back
wall. Galant enters and sits at the back
with the other women; they smile at
her as she passes. Several other Jewish
students will enter in the next moments
as the Sanctuary continues to fill.

Friday marked an important day for
Stanford's Jewish and Muslim students.
An invitation was extended by the Is
lamic Society of Stanford University
(ISSU) and the Jewish Students' Asso
ciation (.ISA) for members of their

communities to attend each other's
prayer services: Muslim students wel
comed their Jewish counterparts to Fri
day noon prayers, and Jewish students
opened their doors to the Muslim com
munity for Friday Shabbat services.
Agunbiade and Galant were two of
the students responsible for organizing
the event. Agunbiade acts as vice pres
ident of the ISSU. while Galant is the
vice president of campus relations for
the JSA.
"There are so many misunderstand
ings between religious cultures,"
Galant remarks. "But when it comes
down to it. we're asking the same ques
tions."
Two years ago. the end of Ramadan
overlapped with Yom Kippur. so Jew
ish and Muslim students came together
at a"Break Fast"event tocelebrate the
end of their respective holidays. Friday
marked the first event since that was
designed specifically to get the two
communities talking to one another
about religion.
♦♦♦
As more and more people enter the
Sanctuary, a call to prayer is issued in
Arabic, and the speaker begins his ser
mon in English.Today he is addressing
the relationship between peace and
Islam.
When the speaker comments on the
structure of the Arabic language, in
which roots of words are made of
groups ol consonants while vowels and
varying pronunciation create multiple
individual words. Galant turns in the
semi-dark.
"Hebrew is the same way!" she
whispers, excited.
ITie speaker's sermon is split into
two parts. The structure of the service is
such that after the sermon is finished,
another call to prayer is issued, and
group prayer follows. Then, Agunbiade
walks to the front of the room. As he
shares his community announcements,
he calls attention to the visitors in as
sembly.
"Please feel free to talk to them," he
intones. "Make them feel welcome."
He reminds his audience of the in
terfaith Shabbat to be held that night at
the Koret Pavilion, then steps back
again.
As prayer ends, the room slowly
empties. In several places, however,
knots of people remain. Members of
the Jewish community linger to ask
questions — Why group prayer? What

is the formal structure of the service?
— and members of the Muslim com
munity linger to answer.
" There were a lot of similarities I
didn't expect,"one Jewish student re
marks, comparing the Muslim service
to the services he is used to.
"We're so excited for tonight!"
one of the Muslim students exclaims
across the room.
Awkwardness is minimal; the at
mosphere is one of enthusiasm
rather than hesitation. To the side,
several men move the chairs back to
the center of the room, but the con
versations continue as the students
leave the Sanctuary.
♦ ♦♦
Friday night at the Koret Pavilion,
the same sense of enthusiasm per
vades.
Downstairs, tables have been set
for the dinner that is to follow the
Shabbat services. Upstairs, as usual,
two services are going on at once: a
Reform service, led by Benj Fried'lo,
and a Conservative service, led by
Daniel Vertheim'll. Each service
leader pauses from time to time be
tween prayers to give context and ex
planation for the Muslim visitors.
Rabbi Mychal Copeland, the Mil

lei Rabbi, has already explained that
it is not unusual for students to attend
part of one service and then switch
rooms to experience the other. When
several students enter the conserva
tive service partway through and pull
up chairs to join the circle, Agunbi
ade is among them.
"I'd never been to a Jewish service
before." explains Fatima Wagdv '11,
who writes for The Daily and was one
of the Muslim students who attended
Friday's Shabbat event."l didn't real
ize there was singing."
Despite the clear differences in
their rituals, she says,"I saw many,
many similarities in our faiths — and
1 felt really welcome."
"There are so many more similar
ities than differences [between the
faiths]." Fried echoes."To experience
both [traditions] is really important.
It removes a lot of the preconceived
notions we have."
♦ ♦♦
After the services are completed
and prayers have been said down
stairs over wine (or grape juice) and
bread, tables fill with students.
Initially there had been concern
about running out of food, but the
supply holds up just fine, and many
return for second helpings. The JSA
has provided kosher Mediterranean
style food: a member of the ISSIJ has
brought dessert.
On each table lie green sheets of
paper labeled "Topics for Interfaith

Conversation: Muslim and Jewish."
Suggested discussion topics include
mysticism, forgiveness and charity in
Abrahamic traditions. While many
students sit with their friends with fa
miliar faces, the atmosphere is again
overwhelmingly one of inclusion and
informative discussion.
When everyone is settled. Galant
takes the floor to welcome the
evening's student speaker, chemical
engineering major Row/a Tur
Rumma'H). Rumnia's address focus
es on the similarities to be found be
tween Judaism and Islam, citing fast
ing. alms-giving, dietary laws and a
concept of social justice.
"Being just, being kind." she says,
"[is] a point where communities can
come together to make a better
world."
When her talk is finished, conver
sation continues where it left off.
Table to table, topics vary, some re
lated to the general ideas on the green
sheets, some more specific. Is there a
custom in Judaism that parallels the
pilgrimage in Islam? Who wears a
hi jab. and for what reason? How wide
ly do customs vary within faiths?
These and other questions keep
attendees talking late into the night.
By 10:30 p.m.. when JSA members
decide it is finally time to start clean
ing up. one long table is still occupied
by students discussing their beliefs.
"ITiese faiths have so many con
flicts in the world." Wagdy says. "To
be regular students and just to talk to

each other was really cool. We ended
up talking a lot about the difference
between kosher and halaal. [The din
ner) was a good forum for casual con
versation. student to student."
♦ ♦♦
All things told, turnout was not
very large — few Jewish students
were able to attend the afternoon
prayers, and about 10 Muslim stu
dents attended Shabbat.
With this foundation in place,
however,Galant hopes that more can
be done to open broader channels of
communication between these two
student groups.
"I think it was very fulfilling for
the people who went," she says."It
did what it was intended to do —
break some misconceptions."
"At the end of the night we sort of
agreed that we needed to do some
thing bigger and better," she adds.
"There was definite talk about doing
something more."
On this campus, where so many
cultures and beliefs are represented.
Friday's interfaith services were
planned to demonstrate that some
times better understanding can
come from something as simple as
opening the doors for others to ex
perience new traditions, as simple as
providing an opportunity for dia
logue to be had.

Two years ago. the end of Ramadan
overlapped with Yom Kippur. so Jew
ish and Muslim students came together
at a"Break Fast"event tocelebrate the
end of their respective holidays. Friday
marked the first event since that was
designed specifically to get the two
communities talking to one another
about religion.

As more and more people enter the

Arabic, and the speaker begins his ser

the relationship between peace and
Islam.

structure of the Arabic language, in

"Hebrew is the same way!" she
whispers, excited.
ITie speaker's sermon is split into
two parts. The structure of the service is
such that after the sermon is finished,
another call to prayer is issued, and
group prayer follows. Then, Agunbiade
walks to the front of the room. As he
shares his community announcements,
he calls attention to the visitors in as

"Please feel free to talk to them," he
intones. "Make them feel welcome."
He reminds his audience of the in

the Koret Pavilion, then steps back
again.

empties. In several places, however,
knots of people remain. Members of
the Jewish community linger to ask

— and members of the Muslim com
munity linger to answer.
" There were a lot of similarities I
didn't expect,"one Jewish student re
marks, comparing the Muslim service
to the services he is used to.
"We're so excited for tonight!"
one of the Muslim students exclaims
across the room.
Awkwardness is minimal; the at
mosphere is one of enthusiasm
rather than hesitation. To the side,
several men move the chairs back to
the center of the room, but the con
versations continue as the students

Friday night at the Koret Pavilion,
the same sense of enthusiasm per
vades.
Downstairs, tables have been set
for the dinner that is to follow the
Shabbat services. Upstairs, as usual,
two services are going on at once: a
Reform service, led by Benj Fried'lo,
and a Conservative service, led by
Daniel Vertheim'll. Each service
leader pauses from time to time be
tween prayers to give context and ex
planation for the Muslim visitors.
Rabbi Mychal Copeland, the Mil

lei Rabbi, has already explained that
it is not unusual for students to attend
part of one service and then switch
rooms to experience the other. When
several students enter the conserva
tive service partway through and pull
up chairs to join the circle, Agunbi
ade is among them.
"I'd never been to a Jewish service
before." explains Fatima Wagdv '11,
who writes for The Daily and was one
of the Muslim students who attended
Friday's Shabbat event."l didn't real
ize there was singing."
Despite the clear differences in
their rituals, she says,"I saw many,
many similarities in our faiths — and
1 felt really welcome."
"There are so many more similar
ities than differences [between the
faiths]." Fried echoes."To experience
both [traditions] is really important.
It removes a lot of the preconceived
notions we have."
♦ ♦♦
After the services are completed
and prayers have been said down
stairs over wine (or grape juice) and
bread, tables fill with students.
Initially there had been concern
about running out of food, but the
supply holds up just fine, and many
return for second helpings. The JSA
has provided kosher Mediterranean
style food: a member of the ISSIJ has
brought dessert.
On each table lie green sheets of
paper labeled "Topics for Interfaith

Conversation: Muslim and Jewish."
Suggested discussion topics include
mysticism, forgiveness and charity in
Abrahamic traditions. While many
students sit with their friends with fa
miliar faces, the atmosphere is again
overwhelmingly one of inclusion and
informative discussion.
When everyone is settled. Galant
takes the floor to welcome the
evening's student speaker, chemical
engineering major Row/a Tur
Rumma'H). Rumnia's address focus
es on the similarities to be found be
tween Judaism and Islam, citing fast
ing. alms-giving, dietary laws and a
concept of social justice.
"Being just, being kind." she says,
"[is] a point where communities can
come together to make a better
world."
When her talk is finished, conver
sation continues where it left off.
Table to table, topics vary, some re
lated to the general ideas on the green
sheets, some more specific. Is there a
custom in Judaism that parallels the
pilgrimage in Islam? Who wears a
hi jab. and for what reason? How wide
ly do customs vary within faiths?
These and other questions keep
attendees talking late into the night.
By 10:30 p.m.. when JSA members
decide it is finally time to start clean
ing up. one long table is still occupied
by students discussing their beliefs.
"ITiese faiths have so many con
flicts in the world." Wagdy says. "To
be regular students and just to talk to

each other was really cool. We ended
up talking a lot about the difference
between kosher and halaal. [The din
ner) was a good forum for casual con
versation. student to student."
♦ ♦♦
All things told, turnout was not
very large — few Jewish students
were able to attend the afternoon
prayers, and about 10 Muslim stu
dents attended Shabbat.
With this foundation in place,
however,Galant hopes that more can
be done to open broader channels of
communication between these two
student groups.
"I think it was very fulfilling for
the people who went," she says."It
did what it was intended to do —
break some misconceptions."
"At the end of the night we sort of
agreed that we needed to do some
thing bigger and better," she adds.
"There was definite talk about doing
something more."
On this campus, where so many
cultures and beliefs are represented.
Friday's interfaith services were
planned to demonstrate that some
times better understanding can
come from something as simple as
opening the doors for others to ex
perience new traditions, as simple as
providing an opportunity for dia
logue to be had.

A few minutes before noon
on Friday, the interfaith
Sanctuary on the third
floor of Old Union is near
ly empty. A group of chairs
is set up in rows in the center of the
room; the muted lighting seems dark
compared to the bright sunshine out
side.
In the arcades. Jessica Galant '10
and Abdulkareem Agunbiade'lo
stand together, nervously looking up
and down the hallway.
*i hope people show up!" Agunbi
ade whispers.
He adds, a moment later, "A lot of
people in our community are really ex
cited about tonight!"
l ime passes. Noon comes and goes.
And then, suddenly, the space out
side the Sanctuary is full of people —
students and older community mem
bers, strangers and friends. Many of
them have never met before; introduc
tions are performed, smiles are
widened, laughter is easy and hands
are offered in gestures of welcome.
Two Muslim women lead a group of
Jewish students to one of the two
washing rooms set aside from the
Sanctuary. Inside, they guide the stu
dents through their familiar ritual of
cleaning before entering the Sanctu
ary. Hands three times, mouth three
times, face three times and onward
until the feet.
They explain the purpose of the
cleaning — purification before
prayer. Their instructions will be re
peated at least once more as more
people arrive; some are familiar with
the routine, some have never per
formed it before.
Inside the Sanctuary, the chairs for
merly in the center of the space have
been pushed to the side, and men and
women have formed lines on the floor,
facing east — men closer to the speak
er's podium, women closer to the back
wall. Galant enters and sits at the back
with the other women; they smile at
her as she passes. Several other Jewish
students will enter in the next moments
as the Sanctuary continues to fill.

Friday marked an important day for
Stanford's Jewish and Muslim students.
An invitation was extended by the Is
lamic Society of Stanford University
(ISSU) and the Jewish Students' Asso
ciation (.ISA) for members of their

communities to attend each other's
prayer services: Muslim students wel
comed their Jewish counterparts to Fri
day noon prayers, and Jewish students
opened their doors to the Muslim com
munity for Friday Shabbat services.
Agunbiade and Galant were two of
the students responsible for organizing
the event. Agunbiade acts as vice pres
ident of the ISSU. while Galant is the
vice president of campus relations for
the JSA.
