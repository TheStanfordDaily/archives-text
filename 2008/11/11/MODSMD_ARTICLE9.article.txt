## Harvard seeks spending cuts 
### RODRIQUE NGOWI THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
BOS TON â€” Harvard University is considering spend
ing cuts because the economic slowdown may reduce
federal grants and the school's substantial endowment.
President Drew Faust said Monday.
I larvard's endowment posted an 8.6 percent return
and grew to $36.9 billion in the fiscal year that ended
June 30. The school, however, lost 12.7 percent on its
U.S. stock portfolio and 12.1 percent (in its foreign equi
ty portfolio during that time. Faust's spokesman on
Monday declined to s;i\ much the endowment has lost
during the current economic turmoil.
Still. Faust warned in an e-mail to faculty, staff and
students that "we must recogni/e that Harvard is not
invulnerable to the seismic financial shocks in the larger
world. Our own economic landscape has been signifi
cantly altered."
"We need to be prepared to absorb unprecedented
endowment losses and plan for a period of greater finan
cial restraint." she said.
Harvard's is the nation's largest university endow
ment and provides about a third of the annual operating
budget. Faust said the school is looking at ways to cut
spending and will review compensation costs, which
account for nearly half of the budget.
Harvard also is reviewing its ambitious expansion
program, including plans announced early last year to
expand across the Charles River from its Cambridge
campus into Alison, she said.
"We will need to plan and act in ways that reflect that
reality, to assure that we continue to advance our prior
ities for teaching, research and service," she said.
The school intends to implement initiatives to make

education affordable to students from low- and middle
income families, and will ensure that those with income
below $60,000 will pay nothing to send children to
Harvard College. Those earning up to $180,000 can
expect to pay no more than about 10 percent of their
income, she said.
Graduate and professional schools will keep financial
aid budgets at current levels.
Harvard's efforts to address the economic downturn
mirror what is happening elsewhere in the country,
including other Ivy League schools. While wealthy
schools can fare better in a downturn, they are also seen
as vulnerable to prolonged market slumps because they
tend to fund a greater portion of their budget from their
endowment.
Dartmouth College has announced that it will cut
spending after its endowment, which also makes up
about a third of its budget, lost $220 million. That
school's trustees blamed the loss on poor returns on
stocks and bonds because of the Wall Street meltdown.
Last week. Brown University announced a hiring
freeze through January, and said it would review its cap
ital budget to determine which projects could be
delayed. Cornell University also recently announced a
90-day halt of construction projects and a pause on hir
ing staff members from outside the university through
the end of March.
"Virtually every college and university, their budgets
are under strain, stress, for a variety of reasons," said
Matthew Hamill, a vice president of the National
Association of College and University Business
Officers.
