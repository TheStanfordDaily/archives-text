MOBILIZED WORKERS VS. MORPHING CAPITAL:
CHALLENGING GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS IN VIETNAM
Angie Ngoc Tr§n
2008 Lee Kong Chian NUS-Stanford Distinguished Fellow
Capital in its many facets is variable. Like quicksilver, it can divide, reunite, and metamorphose
seamlessly across a spectrum of ownerships by foreigners, the state, and domestic private
entrepreneurs.
What does variable capital mean in and for Vietnam? Who are the different investors? How do
they respond to state efforts to attract investments from overseas Vietnamese? How do global
supply chains—corporate buyers, contract factories, and subcontractors—shape the changing
nature and impacts of capital in Vietnam? How does a self-described socialist state use policies
on investment, employment, and the privatization of state-owned factories to control the relations
between workers and owners? What roles in this mix are played by journalists who can ignore
neither the party line nor the workers who protest in spite of it?
In addition to addressing these questions, Prof. Tran will argue that workers in Vietnam are not
resigned to being squeezed between morphing capital and state control. They defend their
interests flexibly in diverse forms of protest, overt and covert, including appeals to the state's own
socialist vision. Fresh from extensive fieldwork in labor-intensive industries such as textiles,
garments, and footwear, Prof. Tran will show how Vietnamese workers use origin, class, gender,
and ethnicity to mobilize collective action against morphing capital in a one-party state.
