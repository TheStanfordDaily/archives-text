# Gay rights activists question mild tactics of anti-marriage ban campaign
## Criticism mounts over Prop. 8 
### LISA LEFF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
California's gay-rights movement has been beset by
infighting and finger-pointing since the defeat of gay
marriage at the ballot box. with some activists question
ing the campaign's mild tactics,including the decision not
to show same-sex couples in ads.
The movement's leaders "were very timid. They were
too soft." said Robin Tyler, a lesbian comic who created a
series of celebrity public service announcements with the
slogan "Stop the Hate, No on 8" that were rejected be
cause they were deemed too negative. "We were light
weights on our side."
Proposition 8, a measure to stop gay marriage in Cali
fornia, passed with 52 percent of the vote last week in a
painful defeat for gay rights activists. The ban overrode a
California Supreme Court ruling last spring that allowed
18,000 same-sex couples to tie the knot over the past four
months.
Some gays are complaining that their leaders failed to
organize a visible and vigorous defense of same-sex mar
riage. In particular, they say the movement failed to
counter a series of hard-hitting ads warning that the ban
on gay marriage was needed to prevent children from
learning about gay relationships in school.
Leaders of the campaign in favor of gay marriage say
they made a strategic decision not to highlight gay newly
weds or same-sex couples with children in their ads for
fear of alienating undecided heterosexual voters.
The movement's first commercial, aired in late Sep
tember. starred a couple with an adult lesbian daughter.
Later ads included a fictional woman with a lesbian niece,
California's public schools chief, and Sen. Dianne Fein
stein saying, "No matter how you feel about marriage,
vote against discrimination."
Geoff Kors. executive director of the gay rights group
Equality California, defended the choice of advertise
ments.
"Lesbian and gay people were everywhere in this
campaign — as spokespeople, on You Tube, our Web site.
For the television advertising, the best messengers were
the messengers that were used." he said.
Hut Michael Petrelis, a veteran AIDS activist in San
Francisco, said the absence of gay couples in the media
campaign was a fatal error.
"We were seen more as a liability," Petrelis said.
"When vou have that kind of attitude, it's no wonder

there was little community buy-in."
The criticisms extend to beyond how the campaign
was run to how people are responding to the ban's pas
sage.
In the past few days,demonstrators have hit the streets
in California, sometimes clashing with police and snarling
traffic. They have rallied outside Mormon temples to
protest the church's major role in banning gay marriage.
Plans have been made for a demonstration outside a

Mormon church in New York City on Wednesday, and
outside city halls in every state on Saturday.
Some gay rights leaders have encouraged the heated
gatherings, while others worry they could backfire and of
fend churchgoers and others.
Evan Wolfson. executive director of New York-based
Freedom to Marry, raised no objection to the protests but
said it is important that they be carried out peacefully.
"Peaceful protest is important, time-honored way ol
mobilizing people to action for justice,' he said. "Its com
pletely understandable that people would be expressing
their sadness and determination."
Gay marriage is now legal in Massachusetts and C on
necticut only, with Connecticut holding its first same-sex
weddings on Wednesday.
Exit polls in California showed that the gay marriage
ban received a majority from black voters, which has
prompted some gay leaders to complain that they were
abandoned by a minority group that should understand
discrimination.
Kathryn Kolbert. a black lesbian who is president of
People for the American Way, a Washington-based group
that monitors the religious right, was so worried about a
backlash that she wrote a memo to colleagues, warning it
is wrong and self-defeating to blame black voters tor the
outcome.
"It's always easy to scapegoat when you are feeling
bitter about a loss." Kolbert said. "What we do in Ameri
ca when we are frustrated is blame the people we always
blame."
