Alter Saturdays successful Moonsplash
party at Sigma Nu.an annual fall-quar
ter Stanford tradition replete with
elaborate decorations and crowded dance
floors, many people on campus were surprised
to learn that this Moonsplash may be. in fact,
the last Splash. The wildly popular Moon
splash-Sunsplash series is likely over after the
administration raised security concerns over
the well-known events.
But this disappointing turn of events leaves
a few questions unanswered. Why the sudden
ly heightened security concerns? Did these
parties have a demonstrable and lengthy track
record of problems? Aren't there equally seri
ous security concerns at other parties on cam
pus? And is there no way to resolve these is
sues to ensure the Moonsplash/Sunsplash tra
dition continues?
It seems that the demise of Moonsplash
and Sunsplash was essentially assured when
the Office of Risk Management came to the
conclusion that the two parties were becoming
too big, too well-known and too likely to at
tract troublemakers from off campus. It's sad
that these very factors — their popularity,
their grandiose size — are also what make
Moonsplash and Sunsplash valued parts of the
Stanford experience.
ITiis said, security is a legitimate concern,
and if the parties are becoming dangerous,
then it is appropriate for the administration to
intervene. But it is unclear why this year the
parties were suddenly deemed so risky, or
what motivated this decision. The Office of
Risk Management would not respond to The
Daily's inquiries.and as of yet no report or doc
umentation of the parties' track record of inci
dents has been made public. Presumably such
a record exists, and points to an increasing
number of incidents in recent years — if not.
any conclusion that Moonsplash and Sun
splash are becoming too big and too well
known seems baseless.
The way the administration decided to han
dle the need for increased security also raised
eyebrows, and effectively snuffed out any
chance that Sigma Nu would continue throw
ing Moonsplash or Sunsplash.The administra
tion insisted that Sigma Nu find a way to over
come the $3,500 cost of staffing Moonsplash
with Stanford police, and this extra expense is
reportedly what led to the fraternity's decision
to no longer host the parties.
If it is true that the threat from off-campus
intruders has risen and party-throwers need to
be more vigilant in preventing their parties
from being infiltrated, we also need to take a
long, hard look at the state of party security op
tions on campus. Many private security com
panies, while cheap and therefore attractive to
party-planners, are unreliable and undisci

plined, with hired bodies instead of trained se
curity professionals manning the gates, and
sometimes they create as many security prob
lems as they prevent.
In reality, most fraternities or houses
throwing parties would love security services
provided by the Stanford police, who are well
trained, professional and reliable. But. as was
the case at Moonsplash. these services are
often prohibitively expensive. Sigma Nu could
hardly be expected to pay $3,500 for security
when this amount was equal to its original
budget for the entire party. Hiring such securi
ty severely cramped the plans for the colored
floodlights and larger-than-life decorations
that no Sigma Nu party could be without.
With a new policy that requires large par
ties to hire these services, we will inevitably see
a decline in large parties in general,as they be
come too expensive.The first casualties of this
process seem to be Moonsplash and Sunsplash
— but the editorial board hopes that we can
solve this problem before more traditions end.
For instance, with some sort of pooled party
security fund, paid into by all houses and fra
ternities on the Row that plan to host parties,
the University could help minimize the ex
pense of high-quality security. The burden
would not fall solely on those houses or frats
with big parties, and parties like Moonsplash
and Sunsplash would still be inexpensive
enough to throw. The University should place
a larger emphasis on saving a decades-old
Stanford tradition and finding alternate ways
to pay high security costs.
The editorial board does acknowledge,
however, that security is a real problem, and
that there have been incidents in the past — at
parties big and small, some with paid security
and some without — where non-students
have instigated fights or been hospitalized for
alcohol poisoning.The Office of Risk Manage
ment has the important job of limiting the Uni
versity's liability, and we must remember that
some colleges and universities refuse to even
let fraternities or houses throw parties on cam
pus. We are thankful for Stanford's under
standing polices in this respect.
We hope, however, that Stanford can con
tinue to distinguish itself from its peer univer
sities — where parties are driven off-campus
or indoors — by finding a way to make large
and popular parties like Moonsplash happen.
If security is truly becoming a serious prob
lem at parties, the administration and all stu
dents who enjoy having big parties on cam
pus should work together to solve the prob
lem — and not just put all the responsibility,
financial and otherwise.on groups like Sigma
Nu, whose only crime is throwing a party so
popular that people know about it for miles
around.

that there have been incidents in the past — at
parties big and small, some with paid security
and some without — where non-students
have instigated fights or been hospitalized for
alcohol poisoning.The Office of Risk Manage
ment has the important job of limiting the Uni
versity's liability, and we must remember that
some colleges and universities refuse to even
let fraternities or houses throw parties on cam
pus. We are thankful for Stanford's under
standing polices in this respect.
We hope, however, that Stanford can con
tinue to distinguish itself from its peer univer
sities — where parties are driven off-campus
or indoors — by finding a way to make large
and popular parties like Moonsplash happen.
If security is truly becoming a serious prob
lem at parties, the administration and all stu
dents who enjoy having big parties on cam
pus should work together to solve the prob
lem — and not just put all the responsibility,
financial and otherwise.on groups like Sigma
Nu, whose only crime is throwing a party so
popular that people know about it for miles
around.
