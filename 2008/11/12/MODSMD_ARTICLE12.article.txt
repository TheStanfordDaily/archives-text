# THE 						AD Analyst
## The 						Routan Bust 
### 
With their newest ad campaign for the
Routan, Volkswagen's first mini
van. VW has done something very
much like the father who takes his son to a
strip club for bonding time — they've taken
their good intentions way too far.
The premise of the commercials is the
"Routan Boom." a baby boom supposedly
spurred by the desire of young couples to
own the VW Routan — the underlying as
sumption being, of course, that having lots of
kids is the main prerequisite for buying a
minivan. Most of the 30-second commercials
shown on TV are actually clips from a four
minute "mockumentary"promotional video
produced by VW. in which none other than
model/actress Brooke Shields executes a
flawless parody of the concerned celebrity
advocating a humanitarian cause.
In one commercial. Shields accuses a
pregnant woman named Christine of having
a baby with "a man she barely knows" just
for "German engineering" — despite the
couple's protests that they are in fact mar
ried and clearly know nothing about the sup
posed "Routan Boom." She then makes a di
rect appeal to the viewer: "Don't be like
Christine. Have a baby for love ... not for
German engineering."
Shields would certainly be recognized by
a large portion of the Routan's target audi
ence — but not just because of her career as
a Calvin Klein model and brief stints in act
ing. Her greatest claim to fame recently was
her very public bout with post partum de
pression. In several interviews, including one
with Oprah in 2005, Shields openly admitted
to having thoughts of suicide and feelings of
utter detachment from her own baby. It nat
urally follows that your typical Oprah
watching mother under the age of 45 —
some would say the archetype of the poten
tial Routan customer — would undoubtedly
do a double-take at seeing Shields giving
other women baby advice, no matter how

light-hearted. The question must be asked:
"Why in the world did VW pick Brooke
Shields, of all people, to endorse this cam
paign?"
Yes, it does seem completely off —
maybe even slightly embarrassing for
Shields, as these commercials do a pretty
good job of dredging up her already widely
known psychological problem. But this cam
paign is supposed to be a parody of celebrity
humanitarian advocacy, which actually
makes Shields the perfect candidate for the
role. More often than not, when it comes to
celebrities, we see a clear disconnect be
tween the lifestyle of the advocate and the
nature of the humanitarian mission. In this
case, as a woman who once described herself
as "cervically challenged." Shields would
scarcely be affected by a phenomenon such
as the "Routan Boom" — yet she still pre
sumes to give women advice about it as if she
were an expert on having children. Her re
moval from the "cause" makes for the sub
tlest of mockeries ... although perhaps too
subtle, I think, for a 30-second commercial.
Yet however misguided,the parody in the
commercial is all in good fun; it is the car's
Web site, www.routanboom.org. that takes
the joke to an unacceptable level. While the
commercials clearly portray the idea of ob
jectifying children into commodities as out
landish, the Routan Web site suggests exact
ly the opposite. On the site, you'll find the
"RoutanßabyMaker3ooo" — a computer
simulation that combines your face with the
face of your chosen partner in order to pro
duce a virtual baby. In this virtual world, the
attractiveness of your baby's superficial fea
tures is the only thing that matters; in fact,
you are explicitly encouraged by the makers
of the site to "just find the right mate, and
make a baby so adorable you just can't help
but love."
Disturbingly enough, the babies pro
duced by this "tool" are in fact adorable.

equipped with fantastic CG that allows their
features to move in a lifelike way. Yet it is
this very realness that makes the whole con
cept even more perverse — just like virtual
car shopping, in which you can change the
color of the interior to satisfy your prefer
ences, you can virtual baby shop, changing
the features of your partner to end up with
the most attractive product.To take the cha
rade even further,you can even "announce"
your customized baby product to your
friends via e-mail, just as you would your
own baby in real life. Except in this virtual
world, inner qualities don't come into play
all you are expected to do is find the per
fect mate, achieve the perfect genetic for
mula and produce the perfect-looking baby.
Does this logic ring a bell? Some have
criticized this ad campaign for the way in
which "(Jerman engineering" seems to echo
"genetic engineering," an idea known to
have been explored by the Nazis.This would
ordinarily seem like a stretch, but then again,
the existence of the RoutanßabyMaker3()()()
does not do much to dispel this criticism. To
be fair, though, Volkswagen is not a compa
ny known for making family cars — the
Routan is their very first minivan.Their vet
eran competitors certainly wouldn't have
told them that it doesn't take something as
complex as a "mockumentary" starring a
troubled celebrity and a device like the
RoutanßabyMaker3ooo to get a family into
a family car.
Hut next time VW has an idea for an ad
campaign, maybe they should try it out on a
few test audiences first.

somebody but don't really have any friends, then

equipped with fantastic CG that allows their
features to move in a lifelike way. Yet it is
this very realness that makes the whole con
cept even more perverse — just like virtual
car shopping, in which you can change the
color of the interior to satisfy your prefer
ences, you can virtual baby shop, changing
the features of your partner to end up with
the most attractive product.To take the cha
rade even further,you can even "announce"
your customized baby product to your
friends via e-mail, just as you would your
own baby in real life. Except in this virtual
world, inner qualities don't come into play
all you are expected to do is find the per
fect mate, achieve the perfect genetic for
mula and produce the perfect-looking baby.
Does this logic ring a bell? Some have
criticized this ad campaign for the way in
which "(Jerman engineering" seems to echo
"genetic engineering," an idea known to
have been explored by the Nazis.This would
ordinarily seem like a stretch, but then again,
the existence of the RoutanßabyMaker3()()()
does not do much to dispel this criticism. To
be fair, though, Volkswagen is not a compa
ny known for making family cars — the
Routan is their very first minivan.Their vet
eran competitors certainly wouldn't have
told them that it doesn't take something as
complex as a "mockumentary" starring a
troubled celebrity and a device like the
RoutanßabyMaker3ooo to get a family into
a family car.
Hut next time VW has an idea for an ad
campaign, maybe they should try it out on a
few test audiences first.

If you'd like to announce your Routan baby to
somebody but don't really have any friends, then
email it to Sandy at slnader@stanfford.edu.
