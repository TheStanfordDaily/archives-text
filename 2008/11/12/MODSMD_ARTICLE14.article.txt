## Why I am irrationally scared of mountain lions 
### 
Hidden within the Bay Area's lush,rolling
hills waits a terror — a silent, ominous
terror that threatens to tear us apart.
And no. I am not talking about something ab
stract and divisive, like tax policy or carbon
credits.
The terror I speak of is the mountain lion, an
animal that, if given the chance, would literally
tear you apart.
Pretty much, if you take all that is wrong and
evil in the world and mash it together into the
fourth-largest cat on the planet, you'd have the
mountain lion: a snarling, ruthless beast born
with an unquenchable thirst for blood and no
understanding of the word mercy.
"But Kevin." 1 can see some of you already
protesting in lengthy emails,"mountain lions are
misunderstood,beautiful animals blah blah land
encroachment blah blah blah do you ever do re
search? blah blah."
You make some valid points. Reader, but will
your unrepentantly liberal cougar sympathizing
save you from being eaten alive? Doubtful.
"But Kevin," 1 see some of you writing in a
second, angrier email."in the past 10 years, there
have only been five recorded deaths bv moun
tain lions,and,like,soo deaths from vending ma
chine-related accidents."
First of all. check your facts.There's absolute
ly no evidence tosuggest that that many vending
machines kill people annually (though, in your
defense. I doubt my family would report my true
cause of death if I died trying to steal a candy bar,
so the vending machine death toll could well be
undcrreported).
Other than that, your logic's fine — you're
probably more likely to die in an earthquake
here than get mauled. What you haven't taken
into account, though, is a particularly vivid story
designed to distort your logical perception of
risk. Consider the following:
Jimmy was a normal, mildly left-leaning kid,
much like yourself. One day.he went for a bike
ride."What a great day!" he said."nothing could
possibly go wrong!"
Just then a mountain lion pounced from out
of nowhere and ate his face.
As vou can see from mv realistic, well-written

narrative.mountain lions are much more terrify
ing than vending machines. Why? Because vend
ing machines cannot stalk you or jump 20 feet
from a standstill. At least, not yet. (Looking at
you here,"science")
I think about this all the time when I walk
alone at night. Somehow. I have convinced my
self that if I am prepared for a mountain lion at
tack. I will be able to fend it off. I take stock of
every possible defense item 1 can think of —
my bike: Could it be a shield? The helmet I had
for Halloween: Though worn ironically, would
it protect my skull from being crushed?
And it's never long before I start daydream
ing about how if such a cat attacked me, I would
fight back and. inevitably, kill it with my bare
hands and sheer manliness. Later, in bar-type set
tings, women would ask me cautiously about the
scars lining my face, and I would reluctantly re
count my epic battle with nature. Impressed by
my ruggedness.they would then offer to bear all
my children forever.
Now, clearly. I would much rather not have a
scar on my face, not be attacked by a mountain
lion and not reproduce with women who find
near-death injury arousing. But it doesn't hurt to
be prepared.
I think what scares me so much about

pumas is that they intimidate me. I don't hunt,
hut it would be nice to know that if I had to, I
could kill squirrels, deer and Stanford's alarm
ingly aggressive raccoons as well as any lion.
But mountain lions can stalk their prey for days
without food; I, meanwhile, can barely com
plete my own sentences. 1 low can I possibly
compete?
It is with this in mind that I propose we erect
a gigantic wall around Stanford to keep us phys
ically safe from attack and to preserve our abili
ty to hunt game on campus, not that we would
ever want to. It would be 20 feet tall and 30 feet
wide.and. like the Great Wall.it would be visible
from space. I don't know if it would keep out
Mongols, but it would certainly make it hard for
cars to get in — a small price to pay for securing
our border.
Hut how, you might ask.can our great univer
sity afford to build such a wall when we can bare
ly afford to keep the school itself running?
Simple: we will create a Coalition of the Will
ing. We will work tirelessly, and probably illegal
ly, to construct the wall ourselves. What better
way to tell mountain lions "screw you and the
populations you keep in check" than to keep
them out forever?
Ultimately, 1 suppose mountain lions are
scary because of how they're different from us;
they walk differently, they talk differently and
they stalk differently. But maybe, someday, we
can learn to live harmoniously together.
Until that day comes, though, I've got a wall
to build.
