## What will you do when you're gone? 
### 
Last week I was so excited by hope and
change that I neglected to write a column.
At the time, it didn't seem like much of a
big deal. Who could possibly miss me, after all,
when there was such a gorgeous new first fami
ly to ogle?
If only I had known.The outpouring of con
cern and confusion from you, my dear readers,
has been heart-warming and life-affirming, to
say the least.
Some of you were quite worried that the fine
editors here at the Daily had — in light of last
Tuesday's mandate for radical, redistributionist
socialism — "spread around" my column.
Others of you thought it was "insane" that
Stuart Baimel was published twice last week,
while I languished, voiceless, in some dark and
undisclosed location.
And one of you. accustomed to using my col
umn for kindling, expressed anger at how hard
it was to keep his family warm.
But by far the vast majority of you expressed
a keen,genuine worry for my well-being. Was I
okay? Did I need any help? Would I return? As
the days passed and 1 didn't answer emails, most
seemed to assume that I was gone forever.
Well. I'm back.Those rumors on the Internet
were greatly exaggerated.
Your morbid concerns, however, did get me
thinking.
Hie afterlife is quite a bit different in this dig
ital age. We leave behind footprints that just
weren't there before: email, Facebook, our pa
pers from fifth grade that are still on our hard
drive. And because of these disparate digital
memories, constructing an image of the depart
ed can be far easier than it ever was. For some
families and friends, the information contained
online and on their loved one's computer great
ly eases the healing process.
There are some people, however, who un
derstandably don't want their family and
friends to see that information. And with the aid
of passwords and encryption, it's easy for those
people to ensure that they don't.
What. I wondered, would I want?
What would happen if I had, in fact, gone
tragically out of commission this past week?
What would happen to my thousands of emails.
AIM logs and Facebook messages? What
would happen to my brilliant, unfinished Great
American Novel? Or to those secret declara
tions of hate and love that I had kept bottled up
inside of me for so long? Or, most importantly,
to those pictures I took of people while they
weren't looking?
After much consideration. I decided that I

would want no one to see any of those things —
ever.
Hut the same can't he said of everyone in my
generation. I know of a few people who have ail
their passwords written on a piece of paper that
would presumably be found after their death. A
few others I know have given all the important
information to one or two trusty friends. And
quite a few more put no password on their lap
top. leave all their Web passwords saved in their
browser and assume people will find what they
want if the situation ever arises.
Admittedly, there are problems with all of
these solutions. What if you want to make every
thing available eventually, but definitely don't
want anyone to have access now? Someone
could find that piece of paper too early, or the
trusty friend could turn out to be not so trusty.
What if you want people to have some of
your stuff but not all of your stuff?
Well, as is so often the case: What the Inter
net hath wrought, the Internet hath provided a
solution for as well.
For years, geeks have been writing clever au
tomated scripts to deal with their eventual de
mise. And with the advent of the incredibly curi
ous Weh site deadmansswitch.net, that option is
now available to the non-programming masses.
After registering for a free account,you sub
mit a set of emails that you would like to be sent
to certain people if something were to happen.
ITie service will then.every once in a while (this
is configurable),send you an email with a link. If
enough emails go by and you haven't clicked the
link, the site will assume something tragic has
happened and carry out your last wishes. (If you
are planning on being away for an especially
long period of time, its possible to say so before
hand.)
These emails can contain whatever you
want: laptop passwords,email passwords, apolo
gies, confessions, screeds, instructions, poems,
ABBA lyrics or incoherent manifestos in which
every word begins with the letter "()."
They could even,perhaps,contain one's final
Daily column.

Alex still trusts his honu-hrcw solution the most.
