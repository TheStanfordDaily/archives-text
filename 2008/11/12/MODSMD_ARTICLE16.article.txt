## Stanford set for upcoming season Volleyball looks to improve on last year 
### JACOB JAFFE 
After a breakthrough season last year, the
Stanford men's volleyball team is back and
hungry for more.
The Cardinal went 4-24 and 3-22 in its pre
vious two seasons, but the Stanford men
turned it around last season, going 17-11 and
reaching the NCAA Tournament before
falling in the first round to Cal State-North
ridge. Head coach John Kosty credited the
tremendous improvement to the quick adjust
ments of a number of younger players.
"The turnaround was due to sticking a pri
marily freshman team onto the court, where
they played hard all the way through the sea
son," he said. "They gained valuable experi
ence, which allowed us to turn it around as
quickly as we did."
That said, though, Kosty was not satisfied
with last year's accomplishments.
"We were excited about last year but disap
pointed about how it ended." he said. "Stan
ford Athletics is Stanford Athletics. We wanted
to go deep in the playoffs. Unfortunately, we
ran into a very good Northridge team. In that
match, we had some match-up problems. We
didn't have an answer for some of their players
at the net."
After the disappointing end to the season,
the volleyball team took a tour of Italy this fall,
where it played six matches against Italian
teams. Last month, the team traveled to Ed
monton to compete in the Can-Am Cup. which
consists of four Canadian teams battling four
American teams. l"he Cardinal finished 3-1 in
the tournament, beating Montreal 3-o,Trinity
Western 3-1 and Saskatchewan 3-2, while los
ing to Alberta 3-1.
"Going to Italy and Canada gave our team
valuable experience before the season start
ed," said Kosty, who is entering his third year as
Stanford's head coach."Everybody got to play.

all the freshmen included, and we had a very
good time."
This year, the Cardinal figures to improve
on last year's first-round exit. Stanford returns
15 of 17 players from last year's roster, losing
only two to graduation.The returnees, who are
mainly sophomores and juniors, should only
get better as their collegiate careers continue.
Kosty expects great things from some of last
year's standout performers.
"Our team captain, [junior] Kawika Shoji.is
one of the best setters in the league, maybe in
the country," he said. "He was a second-team
All-American last year, and he wants to do bet
ter. [Sophomore] Spencer McLachlin at out
side hitter is returning from a great freshman
season, and he is coming in bigger and
stronger. (Junior] opposite hitter Evan
Romero is entering his third year as a starter,
and we expect great things from him. If those
players are successful, we'll have a successful
season."
Joining them is a group of five freshmen,
which is being touted as one of the best recruit
ing classes in the country. Evan Barry, Gus
Ellis, Dylan Kordic, Brad Lawson and Erik
Shoji should give Stanford a solid foundation
for years to come, while also making an impact
this season.
"We brought in five very talented players."
Kosty said. "They have integrated themselves
quickly into our team chemistry. The great
thing about this freshman class is it gives us the
opportunity to compete in the gym.The No. 1
outside hitter feels pressure from the N0.6 out
side hitter."
The competition among teammates should
be a factor in the team's improvement. Kosty
also stressed the importance of the team con
necting and working together.
"Stanford men's volleyball has always won
on team chemistry," he said. "We value it and
embrace it because we are Stanford Universi

tv. We get very talented volleyball players who
are also very talented in the classroom. We
don't necessarily have the six best players on
the court, but we have the best team. We really
stress cohesiveness. and that's how we're suc
cessful."
Kosty hopes to use that chemistry and cohe

siveness to carry his team through a very diffi
cult schedule.
"Getting through MPSF is the hardest part
for us," he said."lt's the toughest conference in
the NCAA, hands down. Oftentimes, seven of

John Kosty hopes the program will keep moving forward after just having its best season in years.
