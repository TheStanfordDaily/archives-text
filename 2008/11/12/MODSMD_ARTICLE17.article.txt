## The
						dawn of Dawkins 
### 
For those of you who don't know
much about Johnny Dawkins,
Stanford's new men's basketball
head coach,let me tell you a few things
about him. Granted, i was born and
raised a Duke fan, so he falls some
where between God and my parents
on the list of most admirable figures in
my life. But there can be no denying
that this latest addition to the Cardinal
basketball program has quite the re
sume. my own biases aside.
As a player, Dawkins spent four
seasons at Duke from 1982-1986. To
put this in perspective, that means he
faced off with Michael Jordan five
limes in the famed Duke-UNCTobac
co Road rivalry. (Jordan played at
UNC from 1981-84.) Although the
Blue Devils lost three of those match
ups, Dawkins averaged a career 19.2
points per game to Jordan's 17.7
against the same ACC and national
competition. Iliis is one reason why
Dawkins and classmates Mark Alarie.
Dave Henderson and Jay Bilas are
revered by Duke fans as the class that
"started it all."
Dawkinda led Duke in career scor
ing until he coached J.J. Redick past his
own record 0f2,556 points in 2(X)6. Most
notably, however, Dawkins also led the
Blue fX'vils to the NCAA Champi
onship game and won National Player
of the Year his senior season.
Beyond his college career, he
played in the NBA for nine seasons
before returning to his alma mater to
sit beside coach krzyzewski for 10.
