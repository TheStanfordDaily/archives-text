## The 						dawn of Dawkins 
### 
For those of you who don't know
much about Johnny Dawkins,
Stanford's new men's basketball
head coach,let me tell you a few things
about him. Granted, i was born and
raised a Duke fan, so he falls some
where between God and my parents
on the list of most admirable figures in
my life. But there can be no denying
that this latest addition to the Cardinal
basketball program has quite the re
sume. my own biases aside.
As a player, Dawkins spent four
seasons at Duke from 1982-1986. To
put this in perspective, that means he
faced off with Michael Jordan five
limes in the famed Duke-UNCTobac
co Road rivalry. (Jordan played at
UNC from 1981-84.) Although the
Blue Devils lost three of those match
ups, Dawkins averaged a career 19.2
points per game to Jordan's 17.7
against the same ACC and national
competition. Iliis is one reason why
Dawkins and classmates Mark Alarie.
Dave Henderson and Jay Bilas are
revered by Duke fans as the class that
"started it all."
Dawkinda led Duke in career scor
ing until he coached J.J. Redick past his
own record 0f2,556 points in 2(X)6. Most
notably, however, Dawkins also led the
Blue fX'vils to the NCAA Champi
onship game and won National Player
of the Year his senior season.
Beyond his college career, he
played in the NBA for nine seasons
before returning to his alma mater to
sit beside coach krzyzewski for 10.
With Dawkins as associate head
coach, it was only during the 2(X)6-
2(X)7 and 2007-2008 seasons that the
Blue Devils did not advance to at least
the Sweet 16. But. I'll put the statistics
book aside for a minute and tell you
what else 1 know about Johnny
Dawkins. You can find most of those
stats on Wikipedia, anyway.
Dawkins has a number of qualities
that make him especially well-suited
for the Stanford job. First, he is a great
recruiter. And let's be honest, that's
something the Cardinal needs. With a
dauntingly small pool of prospective
players, Stanford basketball needs
someone who has already weeded
through small towns from Pennsylva
nia to Alaska, and has made the
"you'll get a great education" argu
ment before.
Second, 10 years under one of the
greatest college coaches of all time
gives him an up on nearly any other
potential coach by virtue of osmosis
alone. Argue with me all you want,
Krzyzewski haters, but Dawkins is
bound to have some tricks up his
sleeve. l"he Duke bench is the ulti
mate training ground. Don't believe
me? Watch a video of a Duke basket

ball game and see how many times
the Blue Devils' guard, whether it's
Trajan Langdon, Jason Williams or
anyone else, looks over at the coach
ing staff for direction. I guarantee it's
more often than the Devils' oppo
nent. and with a winning record like
the one in Durham, something about
the system works.
Lastly, Dawkins is a basketball
purist's dream with regard to player
development. A prime example is the
dramatic change in Sheldon Williams
during his career at Duke from 2002-
2006. Dawkins reconstructed
Williams' foul shot over the summers,
improved the big man's strength and
mobility and got Williams comfort
able enough with the ball to put it on
the ground a few times instead of forc
ing a shot. Just think of what the
Lopez twins would have been if they
didn't have to rely on awkward hook
shots down low. Or if they had more of
a mid-range game. Or if their defense
went deeper than blocked shots, how
ever impressive those were.This is the
kind of re-mastering Dawkins can
provide, and it is something the Cardi
nal has sorely missed.
However, Dawkins isn't here to
change even thing. Stanford will likely
remain a guard-heavy lineup. But. if he
brings the Duke game that I anticipate,
it will be faster, smoother and more
fluid. Within the next few seasons, we'll
move awav from an offense that too

often resembles a game of "stuck in the
mud." You've seen it: The guards plant
their feet at set points around the three
point arc, and Stanford passes it around
and around the horn in a slow-paced
and unimaginative manner. That's usu
ally followed either by a forced shot or
by an attempt to dish it inside. Neither
option was staggeringly successful, and
will be even less so when the wingspans
of our centers no longer resemble "Go-
Go Gadget Arms!"
No, with Dawkins, Stanford will
have big men who can set actual picks
down low. No more 7-footers whose
picks are at best ineffective, and at
worst nonexistent; hitting Josh Owens
will start to feel more like running into
a stone wall.
There are stories of Dawkins telling
Duke basketball camp attendees about
the importance of "finding your range,"
taking a step back and shooting be
tween snippets of advice. After moving
a few yards beyond half court, he began
to work his way back in. He drained
every shot.
Now, with the preseason already in
action, I'm sure Dawkins is at work, try
ing to find a new "range" for Stanford.
Given a little time, 1 think he'll find the
same success.

purist's dream with regard to player
development. A prime example is the
dramatic change in Sheldon Williams
during his career at Duke from 2002-
2006. Dawkins reconstructed
Williams' foul shot over the summers,
improved the big man's strength and
mobility and got Williams comfort
able enough with the ball to put it on
the ground a few times instead of forc
ing a shot. Just think of what the
Lopez twins would have been if they
didn't have to rely on awkward hook
shots down low. Or if they had more of
a mid-range game. Or if their defense
went deeper than blocked shots, how
ever impressive those were.This is the
kind of re-mastering Dawkins can
provide, and it is something the Cardi
nal has sorely missed.
However, Dawkins isn't here to
change even thing. Stanford will likely
remain a guard-heavy lineup. But. if he
brings the Duke game that I anticipate,
it will be faster, smoother and more
fluid. Within the next few seasons, we'll
move awav from an offense that too

often resembles a game of "stuck in the
mud." You've seen it: The guards plant
their feet at set points around the three
point arc, and Stanford passes it around
and around the horn in a slow-paced
and unimaginative manner. That's usu
ally followed either by a forced shot or
by an attempt to dish it inside. Neither
option was staggeringly successful, and
will be even less so when the wingspans
of our centers no longer resemble "Go-
Go Gadget Arms!"
No, with Dawkins, Stanford will
have big men who can set actual picks
down low. No more 7-footers whose
picks are at best ineffective, and at
worst nonexistent; hitting Josh Owens
will start to feel more like running into
a stone wall.
There are stories of Dawkins telling
Duke basketball camp attendees about
the importance of "finding your range,"
taking a step back and shooting be
tween snippets of advice. After moving
a few yards beyond half court, he began
to work his way back in. He drained
every shot.
Now, with the preseason already in
action, I'm sure Dawkins is at work, try
ing to find a new "range" for Stanford.
Given a little time, 1 think he'll find the
same success.

Haley Murphy thinks Stanford's basket
ball program is ready to become the
Duke of the West. Enuiil her at hmmur
