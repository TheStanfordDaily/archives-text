WH 5 Cardinal women's
yj soccer team, it's easy
to see why she's a per
fect fit for her midfield role.
Offensively, the Stanford junior
spreads the ball all around the field
with her passing and is often the one
pulling the strings in the Cardinal at
tack. On the other end. she diligently
tracks runners to provide cover for
the backline and fights to win every
ball. Yet it was a long and difficult
road for Stannard just to get into the
starting 11 this year.
After a promising freshman year
in which she started 16 out of 23
games and tallied four goals and two
assists, Stannard was derailed by a se
ries of leg injuries in her sophomore
season. While she was able to play in
19 of the Cardinal's 23 games, she
struggled to get back to full-speed
and only started six matches.
"Last year was a rough one for
me," Stannard said. "It started off
with a pulled quad and then a couple
ankle sprains, all spaced out perfectly
so I never felt that 1 had time to get
back into the shape 1 wanted to be in.
1 didn't feel my best until th<

rival of freshman Teresa Noyola
meant that Stannard would have to
move away from the central attack
ing midfield role that she had prima
rily operated in for her first two sea
sons. While she had occasionally
played as a defensive midfielder in
those years, it now became her pri
mary position.
Stanford almost always plays with
two defensive midfielders, hut at the
beginning of this season. Stannard
couldn't crack either spot — for the
first six matches she was only playing
about 10 to 30 minutes per game off
the bench.
"It was very frustrating not start
ing earlier in the year, but it was defi
nitely just extra motivation to work
even harder and to never give up." she
said."! knew that by pushing myself. I
would also be pushing the team, and I
think I have helped my teammates..
. just as they have helped me."
Eventually the work began to pay
off. Stannard was still being used as a

substitute, but her play-

ing time began to
grow as she provid
ed a spark off the
bench. Finally, she
made it into the
starting lineup on
Oct. 3 against Santa
Clara, and has re
