# STANNARD BACK IN THE SADDLE

WH 5 Cardinal women's
yj soccer team, it's easy
to see why she's a per
fect fit for her midfield role.
Offensively, the Stanford junior
spreads the ball all around the field
with her passing and is often the one
pulling the strings in the Cardinal at
tack. On the other end. she diligently
tracks runners to provide cover for
the backline and fights to win every
ball. Yet it was a long and difficult
road for Stannard just to get into the
starting 11 this year.
After a promising freshman year
in which she started 16 out of 23
games and tallied four goals and two
assists, Stannard was derailed by a se
ries of leg injuries in her sophomore
season. While she was able to play in
19 of the Cardinal's 23 games, she
struggled to get back to full-speed
and only started six matches.
"Last year was a rough one for
me," Stannard said. "It started off
with a pulled quad and then a couple
ankle sprains, all spaced out perfectly
so I never felt that 1 had time to get
back into the shape 1 wanted to be in.
1 didn't feel my best until th<

rival of freshman Teresa Noyola
meant that Stannard would have to
move away from the central attack
ing midfield role that she had prima
rily operated in for her first two sea
sons. While she had occasionally
played as a defensive midfielder in
those years, it now became her pri
mary position.
Stanford almost always plays with
two defensive midfielders, hut at the
beginning of this season. Stannard
couldn't crack either spot — for the
first six matches she was only playing
about 10 to 30 minutes per game off
the bench.
"It was very frustrating not start
ing earlier in the year, but it was defi
nitely just extra motivation to work
even harder and to never give up." she
said."! knew that by pushing myself. I
would also be pushing the team, and I
think I have helped my teammates..
. just as they have helped me."
Eventually the work began to pay
off. Stannard was still being used as a

substitute, but her play-

ing time began to
grow as she provid
ed a spark off the
bench. Finally, she
made it into the
starting lineup on

Clara, and has re

mained there ever since.
"She's improved a lot as the year s
gone on," head coach Paul Ratclitte
said of his decision to move Stannaid
into the starting lineup. "She s really
maturing, and her fitness is improving
too."
"She's always been a great player
— her ability and creativity [have) al
ways been great." he continued.
"When she's totally fit and competing
and motivating, she's by tar one of our
best players."
The move has certainly paid divi
dends for both the team and Stannard.
Despite playing a more defensive posi
tion and her limited minutes early in
the year, the Cardinal junior has
scored five goals on the season and
also contributed two assists as part of
one of the most dangerous attacks in
the country. Not surprisingly, she said
the change in position has not been a
problem.
"It wasn't a big change switching
from offensive to defensive center mid
because I played it a decent amount
freshman year, so I knew my role."
Stannard said. "To be honest, 1 like
both offensive and defensive center
mid: as long as I'm in the center of the
field, where I can send the ball out to
either side, up the field or back for sup
port, I feel comfortable."
"I think she's good enough to play
either." Ratcliffe said. "For this team,
with the players we have, the best spot
for her is central defensive midfield.
She's one of our most creative players,
probably the best with the ball, and I
like to have her at defensive midfield
so she can pick up the ball and start the
attack. She's been great this season."
Stannard said the success of this sea
son has helped ease the pain of her sea
son last year, which she says was unsat
isfying both because she wanted to
make a bigger impact and because she
felt the team could have gone a lot fur
ther in the NCAA Tournament, Her
hard work enabled her to reach the first
of those goals this year — now. with the
tournament starting this weekend,
Stannard has made herself indispensa
ble in the team's quest for the latter.
Sometimes, the long road back is
the most rewarding.
