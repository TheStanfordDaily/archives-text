## buzzing in November 
### 
It's USC week here on the Farm,
and maybe it's just me, but it
seems as if there's a certain buzz
lacking on the campus. Maybe that's
natural. After last year's upset win
over the Trojans on the road, Stan
ford has already slain the giant of the
Pac-10. No matter how intimidating,
the prospect of scaling the mountain
for the second time is never as excit
ing as the first. Even despite the fact
that the Cardinal would undoubted
ly find its first bowl game in nearly a
decade at the top of Everest this
time around.
But you know what? 1 don't think
it's just here that there's a strange
lack of interest in a lot of sports in
season right now. The NFL is defi
nitely lacking some of the appeal it
has had in recent years as a sudden
changing of the guard has left the
Tennessee Titans as perhaps the
league's best team; and Kurt Warner
is an MVP candidate.
Both are excellent stories, no
doubt, but outside of Arizona and
Tennessee, I'm betting most people
are missing the excitement of last
season when New England was a le
gitimate threat to be perfect, Tony
Romo ascended to stardom and
Brett Favre had a legitimate chance
to win another ring and retire on top
with the Packers.
And for whatever reasons,college
football and the NBA seem to be
drawing similarly lackluster interest.
In the case of college football, things
seem a bit too muddied, with no truly
dominant, unbeatable teams, while
in the NBA the problem is the oppo
site: for the most part we know who
the good teams are, now let's just see
them in the playoffs already.
No, some way, somehow, it seems
like baseball is grabbing all the
headlines with any real panache to
them. And it's doing so at a time
when traditionally the sport gets
shoved into the background.
You know something strange is
going on in the world of baseball
when there's a buzz like this sur
rounding the hot stove league in
