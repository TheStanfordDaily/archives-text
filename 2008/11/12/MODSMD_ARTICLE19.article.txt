## buzzing in November 
### 
It's USC week here on the Farm,
and maybe it's just me, but it
seems as if there's a certain buzz
lacking on the campus. Maybe that's
natural. After last year's upset win
over the Trojans on the road, Stan
ford has already slain the giant of the
Pac-10. No matter how intimidating,
the prospect of scaling the mountain
for the second time is never as excit
ing as the first. Even despite the fact
that the Cardinal would undoubted
ly find its first bowl game in nearly a
decade at the top of Everest this
time around.
But you know what? 1 don't think
it's just here that there's a strange
lack of interest in a lot of sports in
season right now. The NFL is defi
nitely lacking some of the appeal it
has had in recent years as a sudden
changing of the guard has left the
Tennessee Titans as perhaps the
league's best team; and Kurt Warner
is an MVP candidate.
Both are excellent stories, no
doubt, but outside of Arizona and
Tennessee, I'm betting most people
are missing the excitement of last
season when New England was a le
gitimate threat to be perfect, Tony
Romo ascended to stardom and
Brett Favre had a legitimate chance
to win another ring and retire on top
with the Packers.
And for whatever reasons,college
football and the NBA seem to be
drawing similarly lackluster interest.
In the case of college football, things
seem a bit too muddied, with no truly
dominant, unbeatable teams, while
in the NBA the problem is the oppo
site: for the most part we know who
the good teams are, now let's just see
them in the playoffs already.
No, some way, somehow, it seems
like baseball is grabbing all the
headlines with any real panache to
them. And it's doing so at a time
when traditionally the sport gets
shoved into the background.
You know something strange is
going on in the world of baseball
when there's a buzz like this sur
rounding the hot stove league in

mid-November, weeks before the
annual winter meetings. But this
year, something's different.
Perhaps it's that a medium-mar
ket team defeated a small-market
team for the World Series in 2008.
The Phillies certainly don't lack for
star power, but in terms of payroll,
their resources are in no way unas
sailable, and if the Rays could build
an AL Champion on that budget,
well then every team in baseball has
a shot with enough patience and
foresight (that goes for you. too,
Pittsburgh and Kansas City).
Maybe it's also that the big-mar
ket teams out there are practically
foaming at the mouth over their in
effectiveness in the postseason (or
reaching the postseason, in the case
of the Yankees), leading to specula
tion that there will be plenty of
wheeling and dealing this offseason
in New York. Boston, Chicago and
Los Angeles.
Maybe it's also the current state
of the economy. By a happenstance
of timing, MLB will be the first
major American sport to have to
manage an offseason of spending in
the heart of the financial crisis.
There is one line of thinking that
says teams will be wary of spending
big bucks this year with future rev
enues in some doubt. After all. if the
American public has less money to
spend, it's likely that some of it will

not be spent on buying baseball tick
ets, jerseys, foam fingers and eight
dollar beers.
Add it all together and you have
the makings of a very interesting
offseason. Throw in names like
Mark Teixeira. CC Sabathia and
Manny Ramirez, and the stories get
juicier still.
And there's even a buzz around
the local Bay Area teams, despite
both the As and Giants posting
lackluster records last season. In
Oakland. General Manager Billy
Beane seems poised to run contrary
to conventional wisdom yet again,
diving into the offseason free
agency and trade market like never
before, looking to add pricey veter
ans just when every other team out
there was starting to shy away.
Beane has already orchestrated a
trade for former Colorado slugger
Matt Holliday and is rumored to
have an interest for speedy short
stop Rafael Furcal on the free-agent
market.
And in San Francisco, young ace
Tim Lincecum just won his first Cy
Young award, beating out Brandon
Webb. CC Sabathia, Johan Santana
and Brad Lidge in a crowded NL
field.
Baseball, including baseball in
the Bay Area, is poised on the
razor's edge of change. It may be
early, but this year, the hot stove is
alreadv burning bright.
