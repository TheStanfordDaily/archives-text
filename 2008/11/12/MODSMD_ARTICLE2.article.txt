# Was Saturday the LAST Splash?
## Future of Moonsplah, Sunsplash in question due to new policies 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
Since the 19K()s. Sigma Nu's Moonsplash has
been one of the largest parties of the year at
Stanford University, on par with other large-scale
events such as Mausoleum Party and Exotic
Erotic. But new. more stringent regulations by
the University might force Sigma Nu to discon
tinue throwing the party altogether after this
year.
Sigma Nu President Jake Fuentes '09 said
some of the newly enacted regulations and poli
cies by the Office of Risk Management. Stanford
University Police Department and other agencies
have made it too difficult and expensive for the
fraternity to host the party.
"One of the biggest of these new require
ments is that they wanted us to use the Stanford
University Police Department for all the securi
ty." Fuentes said last week before the party. "We
received a bill for six officers, eight non-depu
tized officers, as well as supervisors that totaled
around $3.5(X), which is almost our entire budget
for the party."
In addition, Fuentes said another regulation
required the police to empty the house before the
party started and systematically let people back
in so that they could identify which people live in
the house and which did not. People who live in

the house would receive armbands, and only they
could access the rooms inside the house.
While the Office of Risk Management did not
respond to phone calls and a voicemail from The
Daily, Bill Larson, public information officer for
the Department of Public Safety, said in an email
to The Daily that the new regulations were aimed
at keeping non-Stanford students out of the
party. Moonsplash is classified as a "Level Three"
party at Stanford, and consequently is meant to
be attended by only Stanford students.
"Based on the past two years of Moonsplash

and Sunsplash events, where non-Stanford stu
dents and even some high-school students made
entry," Larson said, "the Department of Public
Safety increased our presence and erected a bar
ricade line and 'hurricane' fence to help prevent
these unauthorized entries in an effort to ensure
the event is successful."
This past weekend, Moonsplash was attended
by an estimated 2.5(X) to 3,(X)0 people, according
to Fuentes.

New University requirements forced Sigma Nu to spend $3,500 on security for Saturday night's Moonsplash
The fraternily no longer plans to host another Moonsplash or Sunsplash due to the high costs.
Larson said that there were no
arrests made or citations issued at
the event.
"We had a very good attendance
in spite of rain," Fuentes said on
Tuesday. "We made some minor
adjustments for the rain, we had a
live hand going and dancers were
packed. It was a great party."
Despite the party's success,
Fuentes nonetheless believes that the
University's new security regulations
ultimately hurt the party.
"Don't get me wrong." he said. "It
was a very secure party. People that

weren't supposed to come in didn't
come in, but there were diminishing
returns. I think that the amount of
security that they had was overkill,
and that it actually caused more
problems for us than it actually
solved."
Fuentes said the biggest problem
with the security was the fact that the
fraternity had to release control of
the party's outer perimeter to the
police.
"They would check IDs. let peo
ple in and cap the party at a certain
amount of people," he said. "That
resulted in them having a large hold
ing area outside the party for people
waiting to come in. and the process of
bringing people in was so slow that
there were several hundred people in
the holding area waiting."

"There was no systematic line, so
people were incentivized to try and
push their way in." Fuentes added.
"This caused problems because the
barricades started falling over, and it
took 10 people just to hold up barri
cades so that no one got injured."
Fuentes said the incident was an
example of how the University tak
ing control of parties away from the
organizations hosting them might be
problematic.
"We do this as a service to the
University," Fuentes added. "We
enjoy throwing parties like this, and
the campus enjoys having them, but
it's become too difficult for us to
jump through all the hoops that the
University makes us jump through."
Fuentes also said the new regula
tions were unwarranted because

Sigma Nu has not shown any signs of
being unable to control its own par
ties.
"What really concerns us the most
about this whole situation is that the
University is making these drastic
changes in spite of the fact that we
have had a historically low incidence
rate at Moonsplash," he said. "Last
year, we even received a letter of
congratulations from the Associate
Dean of the Office of Student
Activities Nanci Howe on how well
planned. well-run and well-executed
the event was."
In an email to The Daily, Howe
said the OSA had been working
closely with Sigma Nu for months to
coordinate the event, including help
ing the fraternity find funding for
most of the increased security costs.

"The goal of our office is to do
whatever we can to help student
groups successfully plan large cam
pus parties," Howe said. "This year,
both Full Moon and Mausoleum
were well-planned, well-attended
and successful, even when rain
caused the students to move the
Mausoleum venue at the last
minute."
"We also look forward to working
with 680 in the planning of Exotic
Erotic, as we have done for many
years," she added.
While it currently appears that
Sigma Nu will no longer throw
Moonsplash after this year, Fuentes
said the party may live on if the
University eases its regulations.
"If the University changes its pol
icy between this Splash and the next

Splash, we'd definitely love to throw
it again," Fuentes said. "We're bring
ing reports from Moonsplash to the
OSA and other organizations such as
the SUPD. We want to show them
what went right, what didn't go right,
and we hope that they'll re-evaluate
their policies."
Regarding Sigma Nu's Sunsplash.
which is usually held in the spring,
Fuentes said the fraternity has no
plans to throw the party or another
one like it. Still, he did not rule out
the possibility of another big party.
"We are currently evaluating how
to best re-allocate the resources that
we would have put into Sunsplash."
he said.
