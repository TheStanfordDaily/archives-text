# Was Saturday the LAST Splash?
## Future of Moonsplah, Sunsplash in question due to new policies 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
Since the 19K()s. Sigma Nu's Moonsplash has
been one of the largest parties of the year at
Stanford University, on par with other large-scale
events such as Mausoleum Party and Exotic
Erotic. But new. more stringent regulations by
the University might force Sigma Nu to discon
tinue throwing the party altogether after this
year.
Sigma Nu President Jake Fuentes '09 said
some of the newly enacted regulations and poli
cies by the Office of Risk Management. Stanford
University Police Department and other agencies
have made it too difficult and expensive for the
fraternity to host the party.
"One of the biggest of these new require
ments is that they wanted us to use the Stanford
University Police Department for all the securi
ty." Fuentes said last week before the party. "We
received a bill for six officers, eight non-depu
tized officers, as well as supervisors that totaled
around $3.5(X), which is almost our entire budget
for the party."
In addition, Fuentes said another regulation
required the police to empty the house before the
party started and systematically let people back
in so that they could identify which people live in
the house and which did not. People who live in

the house would receive armbands, and only they
could access the rooms inside the house.
While the Office of Risk Management did not
respond to phone calls and a voicemail from The
Daily, Bill Larson, public information officer for
the Department of Public Safety, said in an email
to The Daily that the new regulations were aimed
at keeping non-Stanford students out of the
party. Moonsplash is classified as a "Level Three"
party at Stanford, and consequently is meant to
be attended by only Stanford students.
"Based on the past two years of Moonsplash

and Sunsplash events, where non-Stanford stu
dents and even some high-school students made
entry," Larson said, "the Department of Public
Safety increased our presence and erected a bar
ricade line and 'hurricane' fence to help prevent
these unauthorized entries in an effort to ensure
the event is successful."
This past weekend, Moonsplash was attended
by an estimated 2.5(X) to 3,(X)0 people, according
to Fuentes.
