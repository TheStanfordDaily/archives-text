# WALL(ER) OF STABILITY
## 
### DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
In an interview for Volleyball Magazine
during her senior year in high school,
Erin Waller declared her intent to play
with the best of the best.
"I'm going to Stanford to play with a
bunch of great athletes," she said. "If they
don't have room for me in the front row. I
want to be able to do something."
Four years later as a senior in college.she
has indeed been doing something — and
doing it well.

Raised in the suburbs of St. Louis. Mo.,
the 6-foot-1 Waller has been playing vol
leyball since fifth grade. She began getting
serious about the sport when she was
around 12 years old, and started playing on
a club team. By the end of high school, she
was a Missouri state champion, an Ail-
American and the two-time Missouri
State Player of the Year. After being high
ly sought after to play for Notre Dame,
North Carolina and Cal, Waller had an in
terest in Stanford and made her final offi
cial college visit to the Farm.
"[Stanford] was the very last visit that I
took." she said. "It was everything I had in
mind. I had dreamed about going to Stan
ford as a little girl, not really understanding
what it was all about."
Head coach John Dunning would even
tually welcome her to Stanford, along with
an all-star recruiting class that included cur
rent superstar seniors Cynthia Barboza and
Foluke Akinradewo.
"She has a lot of | volleyball] experience,"
Dunning said. "She is a very good athlete ..
. she has always played a major role on her
team."
Though Waller was an outstanding
player out of high school, she knew she
would come to Stanford and have to work
for a starting spot. She played the middle
before coming to the Farm, but was soon
moved to the right side. The Cardinal
began utilizing a unique right hitter posi
tion catered to Waller, allowing her to play
like a middle, running the slide play on the
outside. She saw scattered playing time
during her freshman year, but Waller
started playing a lot more as she grew
older and more confident.
"The longer we've gone, the more she's
grown into her role, adapted to the posi
tion," Dunning said. "It has taken a lot of
work on her part."
Waller has been playing with several
All-Americans her entire Stanford career.
Kristin Richards '07 was a top performer
nationally and spent two years with Waller.

The multi-faceted Barboza and Akinrade
wo are her classmates. And Stanford has
continued to be a hot destination for the
country's top high-school volleyball talent,
and the arrival of freshman star Alix Kline
man last year was no exception. So where
was Waller going to fit in?
It would have been easy for Waller to
quietly take a backseat to the Ail-American
hitters, or play sparingly as a reserve role.
But instead, she has paved her own way and
has been just as important to the Stanford
team as anyone. Just like she said she would,
Waller has done something: created her
own name and her own success.
"She has evolved and grown as a play
er," Dunning said. "She has worked very
hard, her skills have gotten better. She has
really grown into her role."
The number of total games Waller has
played has increased significantly over the
past three years, from 52 in 2(X)5 to 113 last
season. The same has been true for her
number of kills: 75 total in 2(X)5 (on .266 hit
ting) to 268 (.289) last season.
The shining moments of Waller's career
could not have come at better times. Last
year, she pounded a career-high 19 kills in
the NCAA Regional Final to help book her
team a ticket to the Final Four and had 10
kills in the national semifinals. Two years
ago, she pounded a season-high 18 kills on
.394 hitting in the NCAA Championship
match against Nebraska. Waller has
stepped up in a big way when her team has
needed it most.
"She's good at everything," Dunning
said. "She has always been skilled — and a
good attacker."
Despite Waller's success in the Cardinal
uniform, it has been easy to relegate her
"behind" Klineman. Barboza and Akin
radewo. as the latter two have frequently
made headlines on a national level, with
Klineman. for example, nabbing National
Freshman of the Year honors last year. And
while some fans might tend to overlook
Waller on the court and focus on other

players, she doesn't really mind.
"I don't really think about it like that,"
Waller said of being compared to the
team's headline players. "All I really care
about is how our team does. I'm very happy
for [Barboza. Akinradewo and Klinemanj,
all the attention they get."
"She has worked hard at finding a role
for herself," Dunning said. "She works hard
at doing things to help the team."
Perhaps part of Waller's attitude has to
do with the type of player she is. She may
not be the player most likely to rewrite the
record book, but she does bring something
extra — perhaps even more important
than the title of All-American.
"I bring a lot of energy to the court,"
Waller said.'i try to be an emotional voice."
"She gets excited when she makes plays,
and when other people make good plays,"
Dunning added. "When she really gets into
it, she plays with great intensity. Not every
one can do that."
Waller, like many of her teammates, has
been a part of two NCAA runner-up teams
in the past two years. While the team would
like to put the results in the back of their
minds and focus on this season, the feeling of
being so close to a national championship
still lingers.
"We have it in the back of our minds,"
Waller said. "We don't like to focus on it, but
it's a motivating factor."
She is hitting .293 so far this year,on pace
for her best season yet. With the team at 21-
3 and ranked No. 2 in the nation, this could
indeed be another year for an NCAA title
run. Waller will certainly be key to the
team's success from here on out, though
you may not read about it in the headlines.
But again. Waller couldn't really care less.
"I'm just happy to play, happy to be
here," she said.
Her coaches and teammates are certain
ly happy she's here as well.

said. "She has always been skilled — and a
good attacker."
Despite Waller's success in the Cardinal
uniform, it has been easy to relegate her
"behind" Klineman. Barboza and Akin
radewo. as the latter two have frequently
made headlines on a national level, with
Klineman. for example, nabbing National
Freshman of the Year honors last year. And
while some fans might tend to overlook
Waller on the court and focus on other

players, she doesn't really mind.
"I don't really think about it like that,"
Waller said of being compared to the
team's headline players. "All I really care
about is how our team does. I'm very happy
for [Barboza. Akinradewo and Klinemanj,
all the attention they get."
"She has worked hard at finding a role
for herself," Dunning said. "She works hard
at doing things to help the team."
Perhaps part of Waller's attitude has to
do with the type of player she is. She may
not be the player most likely to rewrite the
record book, but she does bring something
extra — perhaps even more important
than the title of All-American.
"I bring a lot of energy to the court,"
Waller said.'i try to be an emotional voice."
"She gets excited when she makes plays,
and when other people make good plays,"
Dunning added. "When she really gets into
it, she plays with great intensity. Not every
one can do that."
Waller, like many of her teammates, has
been a part of two NCAA runner-up teams
in the past two years. While the team would
like to put the results in the back of their
minds and focus on this season, the feeling of
being so close to a national championship
still lingers.
"We have it in the back of our minds,"
Waller said. "We don't like to focus on it, but
it's a motivating factor."
She is hitting .293 so far this year,on pace
for her best season yet. With the team at 21-
3 and ranked No. 2 in the nation, this could
indeed be another year for an NCAA title
run. Waller will certainly be key to the
team's success from here on out, though
you may not read about it in the headlines.
But again. Waller couldn't really care less.
"I'm just happy to play, happy to be
here," she said.
Her coaches and teammates are certain
ly happy she's here as well.

Erin Waller and
fellow seniors
Cynthia Barboza
and Foluke Akin
radewo are
looking to make
one last run at
the NCAA
Championship in
a month's time.
In an interview for Volleyball Magazine
during her senior year in high school,
Erin Waller declared her intent to play
with the best of the best.
"I'm going to Stanford to play with a
bunch of great athletes," she said. "If they
don't have room for me in the front row. I
want to be able to do something."
Four years later as a senior in college.she
has indeed been doing something — and
doing it well.

Raised in the suburbs of St. Louis. Mo.,
the 6-foot-1 Waller has been playing vol
leyball since fifth grade. She began getting
serious about the sport when she was
around 12 years old, and started playing on
a club team. By the end of high school, she
was a Missouri state champion, an Ail-
American and the two-time Missouri
State Player of the Year. After being high
ly sought after to play for Notre Dame,
North Carolina and Cal, Waller had an in
terest in Stanford and made her final offi
cial college visit to the Farm.
"[Stanford] was the very last visit that I
took." she said. "It was everything I had in
mind. I had dreamed about going to Stan
ford as a little girl, not really understanding
what it was all about."
Head coach John Dunning would even
tually welcome her to Stanford, along with
an all-star recruiting class that included cur
rent superstar seniors Cynthia Barboza and
Foluke Akinradewo.
"She has a lot of | volleyball] experience,"
Dunning said. "She is a very good athlete ..
. she has always played a major role on her
team."
Though Waller was an outstanding
player out of high school, she knew she
would come to Stanford and have to work
for a starting spot. She played the middle
before coming to the Farm, but was soon
moved to the right side. The Cardinal
began utilizing a unique right hitter posi
tion catered to Waller, allowing her to play
like a middle, running the slide play on the
outside. She saw scattered playing time
during her freshman year, but Waller
started playing a lot more as she grew
older and more confident.
"The longer we've gone, the more she's
grown into her role, adapted to the posi
tion," Dunning said. "It has taken a lot of
work on her part."
Waller has been playing with several
All-Americans her entire Stanford career.
Kristin Richards '07 was a top performer
nationally and spent two years with Waller.

The multi-faceted Barboza and Akinrade
wo are her classmates. And Stanford has
continued to be a hot destination for the
country's top high-school volleyball talent,
and the arrival of freshman star Alix Kline
man last year was no exception. So where
was Waller going to fit in?
It would have been easy for Waller to
quietly take a backseat to the Ail-American
hitters, or play sparingly as a reserve role.
But instead, she has paved her own way and
has been just as important to the Stanford
team as anyone. Just like she said she would,
Waller has done something: created her
own name and her own success.
"She has evolved and grown as a play
er," Dunning said. "She has worked very
hard, her skills have gotten better. She has
really grown into her role."
The number of total games Waller has
played has increased significantly over the
past three years, from 52 in 2(X)5 to 113 last
season. The same has been true for her
number of kills: 75 total in 2(X)5 (on .266 hit
ting) to 268 (.289) last season.
The shining moments of Waller's career
could not have come at better times. Last
year, she pounded a career-high 19 kills in
the NCAA Regional Final to help book her
team a ticket to the Final Four and had 10
kills in the national semifinals. Two years
ago, she pounded a season-high 18 kills on
.394 hitting in the NCAA Championship
match against Nebraska. Waller has
stepped up in a big way when her team has
needed it most.
"She's good at everything," Dunning
said. "She has always been skilled — and a
good attacker."
Despite Waller's success in the Cardinal
uniform, it has been easy to relegate her
"behind" Klineman. Barboza and Akin
radewo. as the latter two have frequently
