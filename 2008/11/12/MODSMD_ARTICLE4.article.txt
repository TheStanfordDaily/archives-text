## Ashoka founder Bill Drayton speaks on entrepreneurship 
### ALAN GUO STAFF WRITER 
Bill Drayton, founder of Ashoka, a nonprof
it organization supporting social entrepreneur
ship, spoke to students in a packed Wallenberg
Learning Center last night.
During the talk, sponsored by FUSION
(Future Social Innovators Network). Drayton
envisioned a world where "everyone is a
change-maker," and observed that society is
currently undertaking a fundamental change in
organization.

"Since the agriculture revolution, our socie
ty has been organized through hierarchy,"
Drayton said. "The new paradigm would be
more equitable, organized through parallel
cooperation."
Drayton defines social entrepreneurship as
transformative forces in society to solve sys
temic social problems. As founder of Ashoka,
Drayton seeks to identify those with the best
ideas for social change and provide them with
funding and support.

In a talk sponsred by the Future Social Innovators Network, Ashoka founder Bill Drayton spoke to
students about social entrepreneurship, and an upcoming paradigm shift in world organization.
In particular, he listed five essen
tial criteria for a successful social
entrepreneur: a new system-chang
ing idea, creativity in solving prob
lems, entrepreneurial drive, social
impact of the idea and, most impor
tantly, ethical fiber.
The idea for Ashoka came while
Drayton was working as the assistant
director of the Environmental
Protection Agency. Founded in 1981,
Ashoka strives to identify the best
ideas of social change and works to
support them.
With only a $S(),(HK) budget and
little idea of how to find outstanding
social entrepreneurs, Drayton select
ed his first Ashoka fellow in India —
Gloria de Sou/a. De Souza sought to
introduce experimental learning into
the classroom, where learning by
rote memorization was the dominant
teaching methodology.
Since then, Ashoka has expanded
into 60 countries and supports the
work of 1,800 social entrepreneurs.
Notable Ashoka fellows include
economist Muhammad Yunus,
founder of Grameen Bank and recip
ient of the 2006 Nobel Peace Prize.
Yunus will be speaking in Cubberley
Auditorium this Friday at noon.
Ashoka fellows vary greatly in
their fields of social problems, from
health to education, environment
and development.

Students interested in social
entrepreneurship responded eagerly
to the visit of Bill Drayton, consid
ered by many as the father of the sec
tor.
"Ashoka is all about empowering
social entrepreneurs," said Sarrah
Normanbhoy '11. "FUSION aligns
itself with that goal —we give
undergraduates opportunities to
impact social change."
Some students, after hearing
Drayton's speech, were motivated to
take action in the social entrepre
neurship field.
"I thought [the speech] was
inspiring," said Ken Watari '1 l."As a
true leader in social entrepreneur
ship, he tried to create more people
like him, who seek to change the
world."
"There's no better way to raise
awareness and excitement about
Ashoka's work than to inspire stu
dents, open-minded for entrepre
neurial opportunities," added Mike
Young, a first-year master's student
in electrical engineering. "I think
Drayton's goal at the talk was not to
spew facts and accomplishments, but
more to plant a seed to get people
thinking. After all, planting seeds is
what Ashoka is all about."
Drayton was invited by FUSION
and its faculty advisor to speak at
Stanford during his brief visit to the
Bay Area. He is speaking alongside
Yunus at Santa Clara University on
Thursday.
