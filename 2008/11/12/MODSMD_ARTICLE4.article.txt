### ALAN GUO STAFF WRITER 
Bill Drayton, founder of Ashoka, a nonprof
it organization supporting social entrepreneur
ship, spoke to students in a packed Wallenberg
Learning Center last night.
During the talk, sponsored by FUSION
(Future Social Innovators Network). Drayton
envisioned a world where "everyone is a
change-maker," and observed that society is
currently undertaking a fundamental change in
organization.

"Since the agriculture revolution, our socie
ty has been organized through hierarchy,"
Drayton said. "The new paradigm would be
more equitable, organized through parallel
cooperation."
Drayton defines social entrepreneurship as
transformative forces in society to solve sys
temic social problems. As founder of Ashoka,
Drayton seeks to identify those with the best
ideas for social change and provide them with
funding and support.
