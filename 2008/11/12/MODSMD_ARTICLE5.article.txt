## Senate debates politics, T-shirt policy Funding denied for Darfur Fast T-shirts 
### MARISA LANDICHO STAFF WRITER 
Politics was again a hot topic with the
Undergraduate Senate, as senators debat

ed last night whether to extend a new "col
laboration fund" to politically oriented stu
dent groups.
Also on the agenda was a repeat of the
T-shirt versus uniform debate from the
Senate's contentious meeting one month
ago. when the body denied funding for
anti-Prop. 8 shirts. The Senate struggled to
clarify its student group shirt policy.
The shirt discussion was reopened after
Students Taking Action Now: Darfur

(STAND) requested ASSU funds to pur
chase shirts for their annual Darfur Fast.
Senator Stephanie Chan '11, appropria
tions co-chair, objected to the line item
because the shirts were designed for the
event, rather than just for the group. Under
this reasoning, the Darfur Fast shirts would
no longer be uniforms because thev are not
reusable.
"We'll fund equal opportunity T
shirts as long as they are still uni
forms," she said.
STAND argued that their budget
request would still fall under the
category of uniforms because the
design was to simply read "Darfur
Fast" allowing them to be worn
again next year.
Senator Stuart Bairnel "09 was
highly skeptical.
"I think that's a pretty cunning
subversion of our rules, saying that
it's for an annual event." Baimel
said. "I think this does not fall true
to the spirit of our T-shirt policy."
"I don't even know the spirit of
our T-shirt policy," replied Senator
Stephanie Epps TO.
The uniform policy was eventual
ly clarified to only include shirts
reserved for identifying group mem
bers, not for specific events. The
Senate voted unanimously to strike
down the funding request.
ASSU Vice President Fagan
Harris '09, who attended the meet
ing, was visibly distraught at the
Senate's re-visitation of T-shirt
funding policy.
The bulk of the meeting, though,
was spent discussing the Committee
Collaboration Fund, an executive
project that would offer financial
incentives for different student

groups to coordinate with each
other. Over the summer, the ASSU
executives proposed the idea to
University President John
Hennessy, who supported the prin
ciples of the project.
"I think, as individual communi
ties, we do a wonderful job of pro
moting our own interests individual
ly. but I don't see enough collabora
tion among different groups," said
ASSU cabinet member Julian Kelly
•10.
The rough draft of the fund set
aside $10.0(H) for groups that agreed
to come together to promote cultur
al interests — including ethnic, reli
gious and scholastic issues — and
learn from each other. The money
was to be drawn from President
Hennessy's discretionary budget.
Tension sprang up between the
Senate and Kelly over whether the
Collaboration Fund would be acces
sible to political groups. Kelly
explained that political groups
should be excluded because they
didn't face the same difficulties that
plagued racial, religious and gender
specific groups.
"This fund was to accomplish a
particular goal — that is to bring
together people of specific cultures
that have been historically discrimi
nated against," Kelly said. "To my
knowledge, I have not seen a politi
cal group who has been demeaned
or publicly demoralized for their
beliefs."
Immediately following Kelly's
statement. Baimel vehemently
objected, claiming a conservative was

spat on last week. Senators Luukas
lives *09, Yvorn "Doc" Aswad-
Thomas '11 and Patrick Cordova '09
defended Baimel and argued for the
extension to political groups.
"There is a political minority
here at Stanford," Aswad-Thomas
said. "Even though I definitely don't
agree with the political minority,
they exist and they need to be
included within this framework."
Baimel further criticized the
measure because it set up a "moral
hazard system," offering groups
extra money, instead of making
them include collaboration fees in
their own budgets.
Harris and Kelly explained that
the fund was an experiment to
incentivize and set a precedent for
collaboration, and offering funding
was a way to spark changes. Harris
pointed out that with the current
system of encouragement, groups
have not been cooperating with one
another.
The input of the Senate was
noted, and Harris and Kelly plan to
have a formal proposal ready for
Hennessy by next quarter.
Other projects currently being
pursued by Senate members include
increasing social activities for stu
dents, the creation of an online stu
dent events calendar and campaign
finance reform.
After adjourning the public
meeting, the senators continued in
closed session.
