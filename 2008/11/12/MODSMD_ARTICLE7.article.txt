## Judge Breyer talks Watergate 
### AMANDA ZHANG 
Charles Breyer, District Court judge and
former Watergate prosecutor, spoke to stu
dents at the Law School yesterday about les
sons learned from Watergate, as well as con
nections between the issues of the time and the
problems we face today.
Breyer. brother of Supreme Court Justice
Stephen Breyer. was working as an assistant
district attorney for California when he was
asked by Archibald Cox to be involved in the
Watergate prosecution.
"It was. for me. a real life experience."
Breyer said, wearing a beige and polka-dotted
bowtie reminiscent of the times of which he
spoke "For you. it's something to study."
Breyer was discouraged on several fronts
from agreeing to join the prosecution. He was
told by his fellow district attorneys not to give
up a successful trial practice, and that he would
ruin his career by becoming involved in poli
tics.
Of course, he received opposition from the
government as well.
"We were told repeatedly by the White
House that this was a very dangerous investi
gation. and that we would somehow bring

about the downfall of 'national security' —
something mysterious we've heard referred to
often over the years," Brever said.
He then told students what to take away
from Watergate.
"It was, for me, a real life
experience. For you, it's some
thing to study."
JUDGE CHARLES BREYER,
Watergate prosecutor
"What was Watergate about?" Breyer
asked. "People will say it was about the abuse
of power. You can go through a whole list of
government abuses and say that these were the
lessons."
"I would say that these are not the les
sons." he continued. "At that time, we were
told that this investigation would
bring about the end of the republic
— that we could not afford to have
the investigation. In fact, the oppo
site happened. We could not have
afforded not to have this investiga
tion."
Breyer listed freedom of the
press, independent prosecution and
the system of checks and balances as
important principles reaffirmed by
the Watergate scandal.
"All [the branches of the govern
ment] worked together in an amaz
ing way," he said. "Looking back, the
writers of the Constitution were bril
liant — which brings me today to
the wiretaps."
"We have elected to live in a cer
tain type of society." Breyer added,
"and then I see these seizures of
conversations, these wiretaps. Try to
keep in mind these basic principles
[from Watergate] have everything to
do with contributing to a structure
you believe in."
Breyer encouraged the law stu
dents to seek out opportunities like
the one he enjoyed so much.
"I am convinced that sometime
in the next five to 10 years, you will
get some opportunity like I did." he
said. "Try to take it."
