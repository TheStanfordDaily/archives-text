It might sound ridiculous, but
some teachers at Stanford don't even
have college degrees.
Started by the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University
(ASSU), the Student Initiated
Course (SIC) program gives students
the chance to teach their peers about
subjects that interest them. Many
SICs focus on topics that are not cov
ered elsewhere in the Stanford cur
riculum. There are six SICs being of
fered this quarter, with an average of
14 students in each class.
The process of creating and teach
ing a class, while exciting, is not sim
ple. Just ask Zach Chotzen-Freund
'09 and Igor Popov '09. who are the
founders and Ph.D-less professors of
Bob Dylan: Voices and Visions, an
SIC offered this quarter.
Chotzen-Freund and Popov were
inspired to create their own course by
an interest that began nearly at the
same time they became friends in
high school seven years ago.
"We really liked Bob Dylan and
spent a lot of time talking about him."
Chotzen-Freund said. "So when we
heard about Student Initiated Cours
es, we thought.'How cool would it be
if we could teach a course on Bob
Dylan?"
Although the idea came to them
naturally, the actual process of devel
oping the course was a little more
complicated.
"It took a lot of brainstorming,
and then a lot of research," Popov
said. "It was very scattered at first."
Students who apply to teach
through the SIC program must fol
low specific guidelines, such as having
both a faculty member and a depart
ment sponsor the class. Applicants
also need to complete an application
and demonstrate thorough planning
by submitting a mock syllabus.
Chotzen-Freund and Popov esti
mated that it took a two-week period
of regular meetings to develop the
syllabus, complete with background
reading and research.
"We knew Dylan's music, but we
didn't know that much about him as a
person, so we had to learn more,"
Chotzen-Freund said.
But with that basic research under
their belts, it was simply a matter of
planning the course chronologically
through Dylan's life, putting a good
amount of thought into each class
meeting.
"We probably spent two hours

talking together and then two hours
individually," Popov said.
The classes under SIC are general
ly taught in a seminar format, so as to
provide closer interaction and an
open learning environment.The two
unit courses are graded pass/fail and
meet just once a week. For the stu
dents who enroll, that's merely a sliv
er of their schedules.
"The homework is mostly listen
ing [to music] and some additional
reading." Popov said.
The students also have to write
short responses to the albums they
listen to. At the end of the quarter,
there will be a final project that has
both creative and research compo
nents. It's a fairly relaxed class, but
current students, beware.
"We were saying that we should
fail two or three people, just to prove
we're not easy graders," Chotzen-
Freund said.
Most students in the class seem to
have the same casual demeanors as
their young instructors. Although in
general they aren't exactly diehard
Bob Dylan fans, they do enjoy his
music and want to learn more about
him. So far, they're doing just that.
"I quickly found how interesting
the character of Dylan is," said Dave
Mitchell '09, who is currently taking
the course.
Mitchell also praised his two in

structors as "really great teachers."
and added that it doesn't feel strange
to be taught by other students.
"A lot of times, people that are
younger and fresher are better able
to connect." he said, noting that the
class has also given him a new appre
ciation for SICs in general. "My ad
vice to everyone would be take one
every quarter."
For the rest of the quarter, the two
seniors have several main goals for
the course.
"We want people to gain an ap
preciation for the music, and we want
to use the music to explore bigger
ideas," Popov said. 'ITiose ideas in
clude Dylan's music in relation lo
other genres, his role in the civil rights
movement, and whether or not he is
an American icon.
But at the end of the day.the two
instructors just want to spark some
interest.
"We want people to have opin
ions and new ideas [about Dylan],"
Chotzen-Freund said. "And we want
it to be fun."
With these two in charge, it cer
tainly should be.
The class meets every Wednesday
from 3:15 to 5:05 p.m. in bldg. 240.
room 110.
