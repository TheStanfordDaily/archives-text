# Hitting a Home Run for charity
## 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS 
This Sunday. Stanford's Habitat for Humanity
chapter is hosting its 13th annual Home Run 5K./10K
run-walk.
Home Run is set to begin outside of the Stanford
Stadium at K:45 a.m. with the 10K run circling the en
tirety of Campus Drive, followed by the 5K run/walk
beginning at 9 a.m. The course ends in Pac-1() Plaza,
adjacent to the Sunken Diamond baseball field, where
a DJ will provide musical entertainment throughout
the run. A celebration complete with an awards cere
mony and raffle are scheduled to follow the event.
The idea for the Home Run event was spearhead
ed by Global Partners for Development, an interna
tional aid organization that provides developing com
munities in Eastern Africa the funds to implement
poverty relief and sustainability programs. Global
Partners wanted to bring the event to Stanford's cam
pus. but the University stipulated that the organiza
tion had to partner with an on-campus student group
to host the benefit run on University grounds.
1 labitat for I lumanity agreed to merge with Glob
al Partners, and currently receives 75 percent of the
run's proceeds, with the remainder of the revenue
going to Global Partners.
Alex Gaidarski *09, Stanford Habitat for Humani
ty's student organizer of Home Run, said that al
though this year's event is off to a slow start, student
participation is high.
"Home Run is a pretty big event, so hopefully there
will be around 500 or even 600 participants this year."
he said. "Plus, we have 100 or so volunteers who are
staffing Home Run."
Currently, 350 people have officially registered for
the event, and online registration numbers approach
400. Gaidarski also expects about 100 day-of partici
pants to register at the event.
Gaidarski, however, doesn't expect this year's
turnout or revenue to be as high as last year's — when
1000 participants raised $23,000 to fund poverty hous
ing relief.
"We're a bit behind in organizing for the event this
year, so registration numbers aren't as high as previ
ous years." he explained. "Still, we hope to raise
around $15,000, but it really depends on the number of
participants."
According to Gaidarski, the current mortgage and
loan crisis has left organizations like Habitat for Hu
manity strapped for cash,so it's particularly important
to help I labitat this year.
"Housing in California is already so expensive,"
Gaidarski said. "But because of the hard economic
times, it's actually so expensive that I labitat can't af
ford to buy land in California, and instead has to have
it donated."
And what's more, a decrease in funding and finan
cial backing has forced local I labitat chapters to con
solidate their funds and combine to allocate funds to
greater areas. Financial hardships forced Peninsula

Habitat — the Bay Area chapter stretching from Red
wood City to San Francisco — to merge with Habitat
San Francisco into one big chapter now called Habitat
for Humanity Greater San Francisco.
But according to Gaidarski. while the bureaucratic
network of Habitat for Humanity may be suffering in
the current economic climate, it is really the people
whom Habitat helps who are hardest hit.
"Everyone is suffering now. but the people who are
struggling to afford their homes are going to be strug
gling even more." Gaidarski said. "Everyone's going
through rough times, but it's even worse on those who
Habitat for Humanity is helping."
Proceeds from Home Run will go towards the gen
eral fund of local Habitat for Humanity chapters —
namely, the Greater San Francisco and Silicon Valley
Habitat chapters. These funds will finance projects
that aim to end poverty housing by allowing chapters
to work with low-income families to build quality, af
fordable, ownership homes in the southern part of the
Bay Area. A portion of proceeds also supports Global
Partners.
Liz Parissenti "11 participated in Home Run last
year with her dorm and looks forward to walking the
5K route this year with a group of friends. She feels
that I lome Run is an accessible and exciting way to get
involved with community outreach.
"I labitat for I lumanity is really accessiblc. which is
the important thing," she said."Lots of people want to
help with the causes but they don't want to fund their
own projects. Home Run is a really convenient and
easy way to fund important causes."
Travis Urban M 1 noted that the event is also a way
to get the word out about the group's cause.
"I participated in a few projects with Habitat in
high school, but haven't really thought about them
much since," he said. "This run just reminds people
that the organization is definitely still as equally as
alive for college students as it is for high-school stu
dents."
