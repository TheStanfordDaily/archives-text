## Editorial Lessons to be learned from Senior Night problems 
### 
Seniors received an email notification from
the senior class presidents on New. 11 no
tifying them that all pub nights have been
cancelled for the rest of the quarter (see "Se
nior Nights cancelled" in today's issue of The
Daily). Students were informed that the class
presidents were left with $2.(KX) in fees after in
dividuals who vomited on busses failed to own
up. Bus companies, they said, are now ques
tioning their relationship with Stanford, and
"the administration will not let us continue in
this manner, and so the future of the Senior
Nights tradition is in jeopardy."
While irresponsible students are largely to
blame for putting a Stanford tradition in jeop
ardy, the class presidents and administrators
should have foreseen these problems. Com
munication about possible penalties was un
clear, and if we took lesson from past problems
with Senior Night, the current suspension
could have been avoided.
Communication from the senior class pres
idents did not adequately convey the serious
ness of potential misbehavior. Before attend
ing their first pub night,seniors were required
to sign a waiver promising to abstain from
vomiting on busses, damaging property, etc.
We doubt, however, that all seniors read the
567-word waiver in full.The document includ
ed 10 bullet points, the sixth of which required
students to identify themselves and pay a $500
fine if they vomited on the bus.
Only on Oct. 22 did the class presidents
email students to inform them that such inci
dents could threaten the class's ability to hold
Senior Nights and warn them that students
could be lined $500 for throwing up on busses.
ITiough this warning was issued in the waiver,
students are more likely to pay lull attention to
an email.This email came late in the quarter,
and could have included stronger warnings
that if problems persisted. Senior Night would
be suspended.
Senior class presidents and administrators
should also have come up with a better plan to
prevent the problems that eventually put this
year's Senior Night on hiatus.These problems,
after all,are nothing new. In 2(X)6.Senior Night
was temporarily delayed at the start of fall
quarter as the senior class presidents negotiat
ed with the Office of Student Activities over

many of the same concerns.
In an Oct. 4,2(XKS article in ITie Daily, the
senior class presidents noted that vomiting on
buses was a longstanding problem, and though
$500 fines were in place, finding the guilty par
ties was difficult. At that time, they mulled over
ideas such as hiring sober monitors, arranging
for cabs to take home sick students and scan
ning SIJIDs as students boarded busses. The
presidents soon instituted a waiver with many
of the same points as the agreement signed by
students this year.
We should have learned from the lessons of
the past and solved this issue by now. If people
getting sick on the buses was a longstanding
problem even two years ago. the class presi
dents and administrators should have foreseen
that misbehavior and vomiting on buses would
continue to be problems at Senior Night.even
in light of the waiver. While the waiver policy
probably helped to some degree, we still
haven't implemented in full the other changes
seniors suggested two years ago to help identi
fy sick students and prevent accidents.
Hie ultimate burden, however, falls on stu
dents. Our criticisms of the senior class presi
dents are easily made in hindsight, and overall
they should be commended for handling the
challenges of putting on such a large event and
handling the suspension of Senior Night in a
responsible and professional manner.The sen
ior class at large, however, has no excuse. By
senior year, students should have learned
about responsible drinking. It's an embarrass
ment that by this point in our college careers,
students are still throwing up and being hospi
talized.
We're old enough to know better. Such
behavior, furthermore, is disrespectful to
the people who drive and clean the busses.
We fully agree with administrators that re
cent behavior at the event harms our repu
tation in the community. Seniors need to re
alize that irresponsible actions at Senior
Night make Stanford students look like we
don't have regard for others. We encourage
those unidentified persons who left the sen
ior class in debt to step up and pay for their
