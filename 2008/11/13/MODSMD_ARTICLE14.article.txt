# The
						Economics Of...
## Going to graduate school 
### 
As the Class of 2009 prepares to enter
one of the worst job markets in
decades, there are two questions on
the mind of every senior. First, why did my
parents not conceive me two years earlier?
Second, should I go to graduate school?
Unfortunately, I cannot help with the first
question. An answer to that is best sought
over the upcoming Thanksgiving Break.The
second question, though, lends itself perfect
ly to economic reasoning.
Graduate school is an investment. And.
like any investment.it should be analyzed in
an economic framework.
Going to graduate school involves paying
some upfront costs with the hope of accruing
benefits over the remainder of one's life.The
investment is profitable only if the benefits
outweigh the costs. More specifically, the dis
counted value of all future benefits should
be greater than the upfront cost.
When viewed in these terms, deciding
whether to go to graduate school comes to
down to determining three things: the sum
of the costs, the expected benefits and a dis
count rate.
Start with the costs.The largest and most
obvious cost is tuition fees. This can range
anywhere from $23,000 for those looking to
stay an extra year and co-term to $150,000
for those looking to do a full-fledged Ph.D.
program. Law school and business school
also come with heftier price tags and little
aid by way of grants or fellowships.
But tuition fees are not the only costs.
Vou also have to consider the opportunity
cost of the wages you could have earned in
the job market. In thisenvironment.it might
very well be minimum wage, though I am
fairly confident that you could parlay your
Stanford degree into something more glam
orous than burger flipping.
You also have to consider the leisure time
that you have forgone by choosing to go to
graduate school. After all. lying on your par
ents' couch and watching Top Chef reruns,
while stuffing your face with Doritos. has sig
nificant utility value.
Then there are other intangible costs: the
stress of completing and sending all your ap
plications, the time spent studying for the
GRE, the effort of garnering recommenda
tion letters from your professors.
After you've taken all these costs into ac
count, you still have to consider the benefits.
The most significant benefit is. expcctedly,
higher income for the remainder of one's
working life. This is especially true for engi

neering-type majors and those attending
professional schools.
Those in the humanities and social sci
ences will find that higher education has lit
tle impact on their future income. Ph.Ds in
these disciplines typically lead to academia,
where the benefits are accrued not in dollars
but in the love of learning, the joy of re
search and the opportunity to torture under
graduates.
Ilien there are the benefits that will be
gained while attending graduate school. For
the masochists among you. there is an op
portunity to do more problem sets, papers
and exams. For the pedophiles, you get an
other opportunity to prey on unsuspecting
freshmen. You also get to do some substan
tial networking while in grad school.
The last and perhaps most important fac
tor is the discount rate you use to calculate
the present value of your graduate school in
vestment. Ilie discount rate depends on
your own perceptions of the future, your risk
tolerance and your expected life span.
If you are someone who is impatient, who
needs instant gratification and who hopes
they don't make it past 30, then you have a
very high discount rate, lliis means that you
would need significant future benefits to jus
tify a given upfront cost. People in this cate
gory will struggle to make a graduate school
investment. If they do make the investment,
it is most likely in a professional school that
leads to significant income gains that offset
the high discount rate.
Alternatively, if you are the epitome of
patience, exist in a perpetual tantric state
and will outlive a couple of generations, then
your discount rate will be so low that even
small benefits will be sufficient to make an
investment worthwhile.
Now that you know what it takes to figure
out whether you should be in graduate
school, try tackling that other question â€”
just don't think about it for too long.
