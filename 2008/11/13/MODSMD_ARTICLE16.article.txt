# This Stanford Life
## The
						cult of investment banking 
### 
1 first came across the plaque this past sum
mer. Returning from Jackson Library at
the Graduate School of Business, I noticed
a black marble square that read, "Corporate
and Foundation Investors. The Stanford
Graduate School of Business gratefully ac
knowledges the following donors for their
generous support of the school." It then pro
ceeded to list big-time corporations and the
investment banking stalwarts: Goldman
Sachs, Merrill Lynch and the like.
But by late September, the plaque was
gone. In its place was a large rectangle of
butcher paper and. underneath the paper, a
bare stone wall. Until recently, the butcher
paper remained taped to the wall. In the last
few weeks.the GSB replaced it with an updat
ed, "2007-2008" sponsors plaque, which
lacked any of the big Wall Street names.
September's financial crisis didn't just un
expectedly alter on-campus recruitment cy
cles and tighten the job market — the crisis
altered the landscape of American elite uni
versities. The implosion humbled or outright
destroyed institutions that Stanford students
have long worshiped with reverence.
The September crisis just may have ended
the cult of investment banking as we know it
— and possibly for the better.
The collapse's short-term effects have
been amply documented by college newspa
pers. including line Daily. Hiring is down.
Firms are more conservative about recruit
ing. The Cornell Sun — serving a student
body close to Stanford in the pecking order of
elite recruiting — had some interesting statis
tics. According to Cornell Finance Professor
Charles Chang, the big Wall Street firms re
cently hired back about 80 percent of interns.
Iliis year they could only hire 40 percent of
interns. New offers are down by about half.
Wall Street has been hemorrhaging jobs for a
while and the Financial Times estimates that
it will shed dozens of thousands of more jobs.
But 2008 hasn't just led to a crisis in cam
pus recruiting; it has also shaken supreme
confidence with rampant uncertainty. Firms
like Goldman Sachs. Lehman Brothers, Mer
rill Lynch and Morgan Stanley have long held
special places in the imagination of the Stan
ford student. By recruiting the best of the best
at elite schools, the firms set themselves up as
the natural successor to prestigious schools
like Stanford and the Ivies; they positioned
themselves as the "real world" Ivies, so to
speak.
Wall Street firms were a student's direct
ticket to privilege and status. Investment
banks have represented intense work and

time commitments, hut also enormous payoff.
Income two or three times larger than other
entry-level jobs, a nice apartment and high
status social life (a lifestyle of "models and
bottles" as some phrase it) all before the age
of 25 were rewards for years of sacrifice that
first began in high school, consumed most of
college and then dominated the waning years
of youth.
And it's no wonder elite students have
been so attracted to finance and investment
banks in particular. For over a decade, the
world has been the Stanford senior's oyster.
Seniors have faced one of the best job mar
kets in American history.The financial indus
try. in particular, has flourished. In 2007 alone,
about 30 percent of S&P 500 profits were
earned by financial firms,according to Fareed
Zakaria of Newsweek.The number of jobs on

Wall Street has grown regularly in the past
years — two percent in 2007 and three per
cent in 2006. Moreover, starting investment
banking salaries vary, but they have been
known to run upwards of $100,000 with
bonus. And,compensation grew substantially
with experience.
ITiis career ambition is nothing particular
ly new. All the way back to the days of William
Whyte's'TheOrganization Man"in 1957,the
elite American university has been a breeding
ground for corporate and financial employ
ment: "The descent, every spring, of the cor
porations' recruiters has now become a built
in feature of campus life." Then, by the time
David Brooks wrote his 2001 profile of elite
college students entitled "'Hie Organization
Kid," investment banks had become the
prime attractions for career-obsessed colle
gians with glossy posters placed all over elite
campuses.

Wolfe famously labeled i-bankers — at the
