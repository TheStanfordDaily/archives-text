## Keeping Stanford's antiwar movement alive 
### 
I was disturbed to read the words, "The an
tiwar movement has never had a pres
ence at Stanford" in a recent column (see
"Stu's Views: I"he myth of the youth vote" in
the Nov. 11 issue ofThe Daily). What makes
this statement disturbing is that it isn't true.
Stanford has a vibrant, yet rarely discussed
history of antiwar activism, and this move
ment still exists today.
During the Vietnam War. there were stu
dent protests against the war on many col
lege campuses around the country. Stanford
University was one of them. During the Civil
Rights movement. David Harris '67 volun
teered with the Student Nonviolent Coordi
nating Committee during the Freedom Sum
mer voter registration drive. In 1%6, Harris
was elected student body president for a one
year term. The following year, he formed an
organization called Resistance and persuad
ed young men of draft age to take a stand
against the Vietnam War and refuse to be
drafted. For his own draft resistance, Harris
was sentenced to IK months in prison. Since
then, he has written many books and articles
for periodicals such as Rolling Stone and The
New York l imes Magazine. How do I know
David I larris? I got to meet him a few weeks
ago at a teach-in.
l ast forward to 2002. during the run-up to
the Iraq War, there was a "Books not Bombs"
campaign that protested the war before it
even started. In April of 2006, President Bush

planned a visit to the I loover Institution.This
sparked a massive protest that drew hun
dreds of people. The protest was so large that
the President's motorcade turned around to
meet I loover officials at another location. I'll
never forget that.because it happened during
my Admit Weekend.
A few weeks before autumn quarter of
2007 began, the Hoover Institution appoint
ed Donald Rumsfeld as a distinguished visit
ing fellow. This sparked immediate outrage.
Within days, a petition opposing his appoint
ment was sent out and garnered over 4.000
signatures of students, faculty and alumni.
On Nov. 8.2007, around 100 students, faculty
and Stanford community members protested
against Rumsfeld's appointment in White
Plaza.The protest even caught the eyes of the
international press. The headline in SBS
World News Australia read, "Stanford stu
dents oppose Rumsfeld honour." There was
even a bill in the ASSIJ opposing Rumsfeld's
appointment, though it failed to pass by two
votes.
Despite the ASSU's futile effort, the same
people who helped organize the anti-Rums
feld protests started a new student group
called "Stanford Says No to War," which I co
founded and am president of. Officially ap
proved on Feb. 25, 200K, our mission is to
work for peace and justice. Believing in fun
damental human rights and the preciousness
of all human life, we welcome anyone who

opposes aggression, militarism, war crimes
and war criminals.
So far, we have held tjuite a few events.We
held a candlelight vigil on March 19, 200 K.
commemorating the five-year anniversary
since the invasion of Iraq. On May 1.2008. wc
held a protest and marched to I loover l ower,
commemorating President Bush's infamous
"Mission Accomplished" speech. In fact, this
event was reported in The Daily. Other
events include collaborating with the Coali
tion for Justice in the Middle East to bring
Rajiv Chandrasekaran '94. Washington Post
reporter, to speak about his experiences in
Iraq's Cireen Zone, as well as collaborating
with the Stanford Theatre Activist Mobiliza
tion Project (STAMP) for its production of
the musical "Hair." This year, we screened
the film "Iran (Is Not the Problem)" and
brought the director, Aaron Newman,tolead
a discussion after the screening, and we have
other screenings and events in mind for the
future.
The antiwar movement, therefore, has al
ways, and still has, a presence at Stanford.
This is a history that I personally am proud to
share and be a part of. To those who firmly
believe in peace and justice, I encourage you
to be part of this history and be the change
you wish to see in the world.
