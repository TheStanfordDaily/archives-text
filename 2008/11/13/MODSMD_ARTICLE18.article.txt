## Is Stanford 10 percent below average? 
### 
Stanford prides itself on excellence and set
ting high standards, and rightly so. There is
one important area, however, in which we
are failing to meet even rudimentary stan
dards: providing the economic means for cam
pus workers to have a decent life. Many of
these workers do not get paid enough to afford
necessities like housing, food and healthcare.
Many need to hold down two jobs just to sur
vive. and thus are unable to spend time with
their own children and provide the other kinds
of advantages that so many Stanford students
received from their own families.
In the Spring of 2(X)7. members of the stu
dent group Stanford Labor Action Coalition
(SLAC) fasted for eight days to demand a
real, transparent living wage for the
University's subcontracted workers. They
only ended their protest when Stanford
University agreed to close the loopholes and
bring all the workers on campus under their
existing "living wage" policy. The mechanism
that was agreed on has two parts: (1) a "living
wage" is calculated, specifying an hourly wage
that affords bare necessities, which any work
er directly hired by Stanford and those non
unionized workers employed by the
University's contractors will be paid,and (2) a
"Preferred (Contractor's I ist" identifying con
tractors that pay living wages to their union
ized employees; departments are required to

use these "preferred contractors" unless they
have a compelling non-financial reason to do
otherwise.
Unfortunately. Stanford has failed to follow
through on a timely basis with these commit
ments. An accurate Preferred Contractors List
is over 4(K) days late. Worse yet. the so-called
"living wage" is anything but. Hie methodolo
gy for calculating the wage level is simply to
take an average of other living wage levels set
by companies or municipalities in the Bay
Area, and to keep within plus or minus 10 per
cent of this average. Stanford conducts no inde
pendent assessment of whether this is a wage
level that allows people to pay for the basic
necessities of life (it doesn't).
Our living wage has not been revised for the
past three years. Furthermore, since Santa
Clara and San Mateo Counties are the most
expensive counties in the region, an average
Bay Area value will not cover the expenses of
people who live within commuting distance of
Stanford. Defining a living wage in this way
encourages a race to mediocrity. "Stanford: Ten
Percent Below Average" — will this be our
new motto? It's time to calculate a true living
wage, and to keep it updated annually.
At Living Wage workshops sponsored by
SLAC, the costs of housing, food, clothing,
transportation and health care are calculated
alongside the current "living wage" of $12.59

for workers who do not receive benefits and
$11.15 for those with benefits. It becomes
apparent rather immediately that it is impossi
ble to live on this income: shortfalls approach
$K(K). $ 1 (MX), or even $12(X)per month.
ITie people who work on our campus can
only support their families if we at Stanford
ensure that they are paid adequately. Email
President Hennessy to let him know that
Stanford must publish and enforce an accurate
Preferred Contractors List, and calculate a
realistic, up-to-date living wage. Please come to
one of SLAC's Living Wage Workshops in
your dorm. Consider joining SLAC; we meet
weekly to plan strategies and coordinate with
workers on campus. Contact SLAC at stan
fordlaboractioncoalition@gmail.com.
While so many issues seem beyond our con
trol. this is one critical issue of equality and
injustice that we at Stanford can affect immedi
ately. We have the opportunity to provide lead
ership by setting a high standard. It's time for
Stanford to follow through on its word!
