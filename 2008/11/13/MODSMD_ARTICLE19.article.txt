The Aspen Institute Center for
Business Education awarded the 2(X)K
Faculty Pioneer Award for Lifetime
Achievement to Prof. David Baron of the
Stanford Graduate School of Business
(GSB) on Nov. 5 in New York City.
Hie award, which recognizes business
school faculty who integrate social and
environmental issues into their practices,
research and curriculum, was hailed as
the "Oscars of the business school world"
by the Financial Times.
Any faculty member at an institute
that offers a graduate management
degree is eligible to be nominated by his
or her academic colleagues.
"I very much appreciate the award
and the recognition for my work," Baron
said.
The panel of judges who select the
winners consists of Dan Bross from

Microsoft, Deborah Holmes from Ernst
& Young, Mitch Jackson from FedEx,
Dennis Macray from Starbucks Coffee
Company and Bruce Schlein from
Citigroup, all of whom hold corporate
positions at their respective companies.
The winners receive honoraria as well as
prestige and respect in their fields.
Baron specializes in political economy
at the GSB and has written three books
and over 1(K) articles. He was chosen by
the Aspen Institution, in his words,due to
"a combination of research and teaching,
both of which were part of an effort to
develop a field of study in business
schools' focus on the social, natural, legal
and political environment in which busi
ness operates."
"The approach is based on a strategic
perspective " Baron added, "and I have
written a textbook to make the material
accessible to students and teachable by
faculty."
Baron began teaching at the CISB in
1981. In 2(XX). he became the first to chair
the David S. and Ann M. Barlow
Professorship.
