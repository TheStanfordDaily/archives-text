## Meyer rumors discounted Library sees few unwelcome occupants, despite lack of security 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Meyer Library's 24-hour facilities have long
been rumored (o accommodate local homeless
people during late-night cramming sessions.
While rumors abound regarding Meyer as an
occasional home for the homeless, however, the
actual incidents run few and far between.
When it first opened in the l%()s. Meyer
implemented policies very similar to those that
Green Library has now. Students entered the
building to be greeted by staffed portals and
were required to swipe their SUID cards in
order to get in. Bags were also checked as stu
dents left the building.
This type of security was necessary in order to
discourage students from taking books without
first checking them out. The staffed portals were
removed in the 1980s when the literary collec
tion was transferred to Green. SUID cards were
then no longer required to enter Meyer.
"We don't have books here anymore," said
Ethan Rikleen, senior network administrator of
Residential Computing. "So, we don't have to
worry about people leaving with things stuffed
in their pockets."
Though the recently established 24-hour
areas of Meyer may have granted unofficial
access to non-Stanford affiliated individuals, the
Administrative Office at Meyer claims that inci
dents of homeless visitors have never posed any
grave concerns. With student complaints heard
only rarely and no reports of theft
or vandalism, the fact that anyone
can walk into Meyer unquestioned
seems to present very little threat to
campus security.
Rikleen suggested that daily stu
dent presence during the unstaffed
proportions of Meyer's open hours
helps prevent the occurrence of
crime.
"There are always people there,
so the risk of something like that is
lower," he said. "As long as there are
bodies somewhere, it's pretty safe."
The most recent incident
occurred last year when a student
reported a homeless person who
sought temporary shelter at Meyer
in the middle of the night, and
returned at least once after Stanford
Police asked him to leave. He was
subsequently banned from Stanford
library facilities.
"That did happen." said Richard
Holeton, associate director of
Academic Computing and head of
Student Computing, "and we will
continue to intervene when we have
questions about why someone is
here."

The Meyer Academic Computing
Administrative Office expressed
interest in initiating the use of
SUID cards to open the doors to
Meyer in a way that does not
require a staff person to be present.
Due to the minimal occurrences of
trespassing incidents at Meyer, how
ever. there have been no major
actions to reestablish the student
only policies that are now imple
mented at Green. This decision can
be attributed to a desire to provide
students with a very accessible study
area, and the difficulty in finding
employees to supervise a front desk
at all times of the day.
"Opening something up without
restriction means more resources,"
Rikleen said. "You want an open
environment, but you also want stu
dents to feel comfortable in that
environment. It's a tough balance."
The primary concern for Meyer
staff is to meet the academic needs
of Stanford students as best as they
can. Though campus safety remains
first priority in this endeavor, the
near-absent threats to security have
led them to believe that, as of now. it
is more important to offer students
unrestricted access to Meyer's
resources.
