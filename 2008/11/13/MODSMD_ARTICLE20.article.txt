### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
The No. 5 Stanford women's soccer team
will head into the NCAA Tournament as one
of the nation's four No. 1 seeds as it will be
playing for its first-ever College Cup.
The Cardinal (18-1-1) found out that it was
the top seed in its regional on the NCAA Se

lection Show on Monday afternoon, and
therefore it will host matches all the way up
until the Final Four, which will be played in
Cary, N.C. The team will take on UC-Santa
Barbara at Laird Q.Cagan Stadium in the first
round on Friday night, and will play the win
ner of the matchup between Kansas and Den
ver on Sunday if it advances.
"I'm excited to be a number one seed and

to be hosting in the first four rounds," Stan
ford head coach Paul Ratcliffe said.'it's defi
nitely a psychological boost: we love playing
at home in front of our fans and 1 think it will

GAME NOTES: The No. 5 Stanford women's soccer team

host school as long as they keep winning. But it's one

the Big West Conference Tournament, and
they did it in heart-stopping fashion — both
of their victories in the tournament came in
penalty shootouts after 1-1 draws.
Although they might not have won the Big
West convincingly, the Gauchos — who were
ranked in the top-25 for much of the season
— have proven that they can hang with Pacif
ic-10 opponents throughout the year. They
lost narrow one-goal decisions to No. 2
UCLA. No. 24 Washington State and Arizona
State and defeated Arizona 1-0. They also
posted a victory over No. 17 San Diego 1-0
this year. In short. UCSB will he no pushover
in the first round.
If the Cardinal gets by the Gauchos, it will
face either Denver or Kansas in the second
round. Denver (19-2-2 overall) won the Sun
Belt Tournament Championship last week
end. defeating Western Kentucky 2-0 in the
final. While the Pioneers did not play many
top-25 opponents this year, they did defeat
then-No. 16 Colorado 1-0 in August and also
played Long Beach State (ranked in the top
-25 for most of the season) to a draw.
A matchup with Denver would add a re
venge factor to the match for the Stanford
women. Last year the Pioneers shocked the
Cardinal in the Colorado Invitational Tourna
ment. winning 1-0 and handing Stanford its
first loss of the season and one of only two
regular season losses the team suffered all
year. Despite the outcome, it was a game the
Cardinal dominated, and the team would

Stanford's other possible oppo

The Jayhawks (12-7-2) were a bub
ble team going into Selection Mon
day, but they received a big boost
from their performance in the Big
12 tournament. The Jayhawks upset
No. 14 Texas A&M 4-2 in the first
round — their second victory over
the Aggies on the season — and
then played No. 13 Missouri to a 1-1
draw before losing in penalty kicks.
If the Cardinal makes it past the
second round and into the Sweet 16,
it can only expect things to get more
difficult. A potential third round
pairing could match the team up
with Oklahoma State, the No. 4 seed
in the region. The Cowgirls (17-1-3)
are actually ranked No. 7 in the
country, but their relatively low RPI
pushed them down to a four-seed. At
any rate, they could provide a stout
test in the Sweet 16. where Stanford
has fallen two years in a row.

finished the year at 17-1-0, the only
blemish on their record coming

that handed Stanford its only loss —
in their second game of the year. If
all goes according to seed, the Card
will host Portland with a Final Four
spot on the line in what could very
well be one of the best matches of
the tournament.
Ratcliffe said he will begin scout

but admitted that his team won't
worry too much about who they are
playing.
"All opponents are tough in the
playoffs." he said."l'll be doing some

just need to play to the best of our
ability. I don't think anyone can stop

GAME NOTES: The No. 5 Stanford women's soccer team
begins the NCAA Tournament this weekend. The Cardi
nal received the No. 1 seed in its region, making it the
host school as long as they keep winning. But it's one
game at a time, starting with the opening-round game
on Friday night against the Gauchos of UCSB.
the Big West Conference Tournament, and
they did it in heart-stopping fashion — both
of their victories in the tournament came in
penalty shootouts after 1-1 draws.
Although they might not have won the Big
West convincingly, the Gauchos — who were
ranked in the top-25 for much of the season
— have proven that they can hang with Pacif
ic-10 opponents throughout the year. They
lost narrow one-goal decisions to No. 2
UCLA. No. 24 Washington State and Arizona
State and defeated Arizona 1-0. They also
posted a victory over No. 17 San Diego 1-0
this year. In short. UCSB will he no pushover
in the first round.
If the Cardinal gets by the Gauchos, it will
face either Denver or Kansas in the second
round. Denver (19-2-2 overall) won the Sun
Belt Tournament Championship last week
end. defeating Western Kentucky 2-0 in the
final. While the Pioneers did not play many
top-25 opponents this year, they did defeat
then-No. 16 Colorado 1-0 in August and also
played Long Beach State (ranked in the top
-25 for most of the season) to a draw.
A matchup with Denver would add a re
venge factor to the match for the Stanford
women. Last year the Pioneers shocked the
Cardinal in the Colorado Invitational Tourna
ment. winning 1-0 and handing Stanford its
first loss of the season and one of only two
regular season losses the team suffered all
year. Despite the outcome, it was a game the
Cardinal dominated, and the team would

surely like to extract some payback
for that match if it indeed meets
Denver this weekend.
Stanford's other possible oppo
nent in the second round is Kansas.
The Jayhawks (12-7-2) were a bub
ble team going into Selection Mon
day, but they received a big boost
from their performance in the Big
12 tournament. The Jayhawks upset
No. 14 Texas A&M 4-2 in the first
round — their second victory over
the Aggies on the season — and
then played No. 13 Missouri to a 1-1
draw before losing in penalty kicks.
If the Cardinal makes it past the
second round and into the Sweet 16,
it can only expect things to get more
difficult. A potential third round
pairing could match the team up
with Oklahoma State, the No. 4 seed
in the region. The Cowgirls (17-1-3)
are actually ranked No. 7 in the
country, but their relatively low RPI
pushed them down to a four-seed. At
any rate, they could provide a stout
test in the Sweet 16. where Stanford
has fallen two years in a row.
Stanford's region also contains

finished the year at 17-1-0, the only
blemish on their record coming
against UCLA — the same team
that handed Stanford its only loss —
in their second game of the year. If
all goes according to seed, the Card
will host Portland with a Final Four
spot on the line in what could very
well be one of the best matches of
the tournament.
Ratcliffe said he will begin scout
ing the teams in Stanford's region,
but admitted that his team won't
worry too much about who they are
playing.
"All opponents are tough in the
playoffs." he said."l'll be doing some
research, but at the end of the day we
just need to play to the best of our
ability. I don't think anyone can stop
us if we play to our potential."
The Cardinal's first round match
is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m.on Fri
day night. The second round
matchup will be at 1 p.m. on Sunday.
The first 50 students to show up on
both days will receive free tickets.
After that, tickets will be five dollars
for students, since the match is an
NCAA event.
