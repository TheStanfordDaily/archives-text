playing for its first-ever College Cup.
The Cardinal (18-1-1) found out that it was
the top seed in its regional on the NCAA Se

lection Show on Monday afternoon, and

until the Final Four, which will be played in
Cary, N.C. The team will take on UC-Santa
Barbara at Laird Q.Cagan Stadium in the first
round on Friday night, and will play the win

GAME NOTES: The No. 5 Stanford women's soccer team
begins the NCAA Tournament this weekend. The Cardi
nal received the No. 1 seed in its region, making it the
host school as long as they keep winning. But it's one
game at a time, starting with the opening-round game
on Friday night against the Gauchos of UCSB.
the Big West Conference Tournament, and
they did it in heart-stopping fashion — both
of their victories in the tournament came in
penalty shootouts after 1-1 draws.
Although they might not have won the Big
West convincingly, the Gauchos — who were
ranked in the top-25 for much of the season
— have proven that they can hang with Pacif
ic-10 opponents throughout the year. They
lost narrow one-goal decisions to No. 2
UCLA. No. 24 Washington State and Arizona
State and defeated Arizona 1-0. They also
posted a victory over No. 17 San Diego 1-0
this year. In short. UCSB will he no pushover
in the first round.
If the Cardinal gets by the Gauchos, it will
face either Denver or Kansas in the second
round. Denver (19-2-2 overall) won the Sun
Belt Tournament Championship last week
end. defeating Western Kentucky 2-0 in the
final. While the Pioneers did not play many
top-25 opponents this year, they did defeat
then-No. 16 Colorado 1-0 in August and also
played Long Beach State (ranked in the top
-25 for most of the season) to a draw.
A matchup with Denver would add a re
venge factor to the match for the Stanford
women. Last year the Pioneers shocked the
Cardinal in the Colorado Invitational Tourna
ment. winning 1-0 and handing Stanford its
first loss of the season and one of only two
regular season losses the team suffered all
year. Despite the outcome, it was a game the
Cardinal dominated, and the team would
