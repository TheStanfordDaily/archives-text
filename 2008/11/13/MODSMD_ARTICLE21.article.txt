## Stanford and Cal square off Cardinal heads to Berkeley for big rematch 
### DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
Almost four weeks ago, the Stanford and Califor

record books. Both teams came into the match from

GAME NOTES: No. 2 Stanford will
look to avenge its only conference
loss of the season when it heads
across the bay to take on No. 7
California. Cal won the last meet
ing 3-1 back in October. However,
since then the Bears have gone 3-3
and Stanford has gone 6-0 and re
gained first place in the Poc-10.
Cal is looking for its first sweep of
Stanford in 29 years.

care of business, sweeping through their opponents
with relative ease. Stanford has surged to the top of
the Pac-10 and now sits a full two games up on Cal
and Washington in the standings. Something from
that loss seems to have sparked an internal fire with
in the Stanford players.
"While no loss is good, the loss certainly taught us
something," head coach John Dunning said.
"It made our team sit up and take notice."
The No. 2 Cardinal will not see an easy Cal team this
weekend.The Bears are still ranked No. 7 in the nation,
and they already have something on the Card: the win
earlier this season. History is again thrown out the win
dow as the Pac-10's first- and second-place teams will
show up tomorrow night ready to win a volleyball
game.
"They have the upper hand, they heat us on our
court." Dunning said. "They have confidence knowing
that they can beat us."
A big reason for Cal's victory over Stanford last
time was its offense. Setter Carli Lloyd was spectacular
against the Cardinal, while Ail-American hitter Hana
Cutura was knocking down balls left and right. Stan
ford could not get into a rhythm in its passing game and
thus could not counter Cal's relentless attacking. And
with Stanford giving up 25 kills to Arizona State's
Sarah Reaves last weekend. Cal will try to exploit the
Card in any way possible.
"[Last time], Cal played very well," said Dunning,
adding that when a team plays well,"they make you do
things you don't want to do."
But Stanford is not the same team that suffered a loss
four weeks ago. The Cardinal women have been playing
with more energy, scrambling better and are learning
more about what makes them a good team. They are 6-
0 since the loss, are improving every week, and inching
closer and closer to locking up the Pac-10 title.
Additionally, Stanford's individual players have
been heating up. Senior middle blocker Foluke Akin
radewo is coming off of an outstanding weekend that
earned her Pac-10 Player of the Week honors. She hit a
combined .634 against the Arizona schools with 12 kills
on Friday and a team-high 16 on Saturday. Senior out
side hitter Cynthia Barboza has recorded double-digit
kills in 13 of the last 14 matches, including the last seven
in a row. Junior middle Janet Okogbaa has hit .4(H) or
better in her last three matches and blocking 12 balls in
that span. Senior defensive specialist Jessica Fishburn
has been rock solid in the back line as well.
A possible reason Cal has struggled recently is the
fact that they were the Pac-10's top team after beating
the Cardinal. With the conference target perhaps tem
porarily moving from Stanford to Cal. teams would be
pumped to play the Bears while Stanford perhaps slid
under the radar a bit.
But the target is back on the Stanford women's
backs now, and Cal will surely be gunning for a victory
on their home court. The match will start at 7 p.m. at
Berkeley's Haas Pavillion.Those who cannot make the
trek across the bay will be able to view the action live
on Fox Sports Net.
"You know that they'll be ready to play." Dunning
said of the Cal team. "You know our team will be mo
tivated to play. [This game is] very important to our
team and our season."
