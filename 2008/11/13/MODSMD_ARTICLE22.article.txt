# Cardinal comes up short
## 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA STAFF WRITER 
After winning the NorPac Tournament
title last Saturday, the Stanford field hockey
team traveled to Princeton, N.J. on Tuesday
to take on the Tigers in an NCAA play-in
match. Coming off of a huge double-over
time victory over California in the title match
of its conference tournament and capturing
the NorPac Championship for the second
year in a row, the Stanford women were
looking to build on,as senior Bailey Richard
son put it, a "really sweet win."
"We drove six hours from Virginia to
Princeton on a charter bus and our team was
just so excited to still be together traveling
and playing hockey," Richardson continued.
Unfortunately, that excitement was short
lived, as the Cardinal faced one of the most
ferocious offensive teams in the nation, and
fell to Princeton 8-2.
The No. 9 Tigers had an amazing season,

going undefeated in the Ivy League and 16-2
overall. In its 12th consecutive undefeated
season against its fellow Ivies. Princeton had
been in the national rankings all season long.
The Tigers demonstrated their prowess
against the Cardinal from the beginning of
the match, scoring five first-half goals to
Stanford's zero.
"Princeton generated a lot of attack and
capitalized on their opportunities," senior
Hillary Braun said. "They were definitely
one of the best teams we've faced all season."
TTie Cardinal's opponent is ranked third
in the nation in goals per game and second in
penalty corners per game. Princeton left no
doubt of its rankings on Tuesday, as it dictat
ed the pace and flow of the game,securing a
29-7 edge in shot attempts and 12-2 edge for
penalty corners. The game marked the last
for the Cardinal this season, as Stanford fin
ished with a 9-11 overall record.
Junior Rachel Mozenter and sophomore
Xanthe 'Travlos each chipped in a goal for

Stanford. Mozenter tapped in her third goal
of the season in the 58th minute, giving the
Cardinal its first score, assisted by freshman
Stephanie Byrne. Travlos scored her sixth
goal of the year in the 62nd minute to bring
the final score to 8-2.The already highly ac
claimed redshirt freshman goalkeeper
Alessandra Moss stopped her fourth penalty
stroke of the season to stop another Prince
ton goal, one of her 10 saves during the
match. But it was not enough to stop the
high-flying Tigers.

match against Cal. It marked only the
third game that Richardson had
missed during her four-year career
on The Farm. The seniors served as
valuable leaders for the team and
will be missed in the upcoming sea

Still, the Cardinal left the field in
Princeton with the knowledge that
the team had taken another big step
forward in 2(K)S, winning its second
consecutive NorPac title.
"Despite the score [of the Prince
ton game], I am so proud of the way
our team came together and rallied

this season," Braun said.
After suffering several losses in
the beginning of the year, the team
was never expected to win the Nor-
Pac title,especially against No. 16Cal.
Nevertheless, the Cardinal women
overcame numerous hurdles and in
credible adversity to make it far into
the tournament, and eventually
emerge as the number one team in
the conference.
"Back to back NorPac champi

this program." Braun said.
With the offseason ahead, and a

turning next season, the Stanford
women will be looking to take the
next step in 2009.
