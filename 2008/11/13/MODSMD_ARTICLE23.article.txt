# Will the fans please stand up

Did you know there are col
leges out there where the
campuses practically shut
down for football games, even when
the team is on the road? Just about
every person on campus is either at
the game or watching it on TV.
Schools exist where the entire stu
dent body unites for their sporting
events and the campus is brought to
gether once a week.
At Michigan orTexas. the biggest
event of any weekend in the fall is
the football game. Students wake up.
paint their faces, go to tailgates and
pack into the stadium earlv. Home
work isn't even considered on a Sat
urday. and no one plans which frat
party to attend until well after the
game.
In Minnesota, where I'm from,
students enter a lottery just to be
able to buy hockey tickets and only
get tickets to half the home games if
they win. And good luck getting tick
ets if you're not a student — the
waiting list for season tickets for the
general public is estimated to be over
70 years long. At Wisconsin, there is
no lottery system and students in
stead wait in line for 24 hours or
more — skipping class just to be able
to buy their tickets at the start of the
season.
We don't have to wait in line or
win a lottery to get our tickets at
Stanford, and attendance at just
about every sport on the Farm is free
for students. We win the Director's
Cup every year and have multiple
teams legitimately competing for a
national titles in every season. Ibis
place should be a sports fan's dream.
But it isn't, and I just don't get it.
Not only do we consistently dom
inate the collegiate athletic land
scape. but every team plays its home
games in quality facilities on campus
within walking distance of every
dorm. Every sport but basketball is
free, and that hardly costs anything
for season tickets.The football team
is playing in a new stadium and is
competitive in every game. With one
more win. Stanford could be bowl
bound.
Where are the hours-long pre
game parties and tailgates? Where
was the Red Zone when Stanford
steamrolled Washington State in a
record-setting game a few weeks
ago? Why, when I walked intoTresid
der last Saturday afternoon, were
there three football games on, none
of which was the Stanford game?
We have all seen that this campus
likes to celebrate, as the charred
ground in the center of the quad at
tests. These moments of unifying cel
ebration and campus togetherness
are truly wonderful and there is no
reason they can't happen more
often. I'm not saying that we all need
to hold hands and sing "Kumbaya"
before every Stanford sporting
event.but these are perfect opportu
nities to have fun and connect with
your fellow students.
It is really fun to be part of a
screaming mob cheering your team
to victory, especially when they win
often and everyone else is just as ex
cited as you. Ibis one of the major
reasons college sports are so great:
the fanatical loyalty and excitement
of the students. And it's a great way
to vent and forget about schoolwork
on the weekend.
And don't listen to people who
say they will start caring when the
football team makes a bowl game or
the basketball team makes the Final
Four.That logic is absurd.Stanford's
athletes and teams are some of the
best in the nation and are all worth
following in any season. These ath
letes all deserve support and en
couragement for their efforts and
achievements on the field or on the
court.
The best part about being a fan
isn't jumping on the bandwagon
right before the end: it is being there
at every hurdle and celebrating with
them as they are cleared. It is about
supporting your classmates, crushing
your rivals, having a good time with
your friends and connecting with the
rest of campus. Stanford's athletics
provide the perfect opportunity and
framework for all of this.
Of course there are students here
who love the Cardinal and turn out
for as many games as they can, and I

salute them. 1 encourage them to get
their friends and the people who live
down the hall from them interested.
You don't have to go to every game,
because there are a lot. But make an
effort to go to as many as you can.
They are fun. the teams are good

and it can be one of the best parts of
the college experience.
I'm not asking you to be a fanatic.
Just be a fan.

Erik Adams realizes that most of the
people reading this column probably
already are fans. So spread that enthu

game viewing parties, and generally
encourage athletic excitement in your
fellow students. Contact Erik at
