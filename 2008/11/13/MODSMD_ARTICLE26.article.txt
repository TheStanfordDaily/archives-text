## Stanford gets back on mat Cardinal travels to Wyoming to face Cowboys 
### ZOE LEAVITT 
Coming off of an 0-2 start last weekend but bolstered by
some standout performances, Stanford wrestling is hoping to
kick-start its season against Wyoming this Friday.The Cardi
nal has not faced the Cowboys in a number of years, so the
team has no personal experiences to look back on. But there
seems to be little doubt that it will be a tough match.
This is the first match of the season for Wyoming, so the
Cardinal hopes that it will be more prepared with what head
coach Jason Borrelli called its "first match jitters" out of the
way. Like Stanford's wrestling squad, the Cowboys have a
new coach and a young team, and are working hard to move
up in the college wrestling world. Wyoming's freshman class
was ranked 11th nationally this fall. For these reasons, Bor
relli believes it may be hard to know what to expect from
Stanford's opponent this weekend.
"They are a team that has been kind of knocking on the
doors the past couple years," Borrelli said. "They've made a
lot of improvements â€” new coaching staff, some big re
cruits."
The Cowboys finished the season last year with a 4-9
record. But Borrelli cautioned against putting too much
stock in their performance last season.
"Just because they're not good on paper, doesn't mean
anything about their performance this year," he said.
"TTiey're a good, young team. I expect them to wrestle hard."
Sophomore Porfirio Madrigal, the only Cardinal wrestler
coming off of two solid wins last weekend, will face difficult
competition in the 133-pound weight class against the Cow
boys' only returning NCAA qualifier. The two freshmen in
Stanford's starting lineup. Nick Amuchastegui and Victor
Haug at 165 and IK4 pounds, respectively, will also need to
show that they can build off their first dual match victories
and improve. Amuchastegui will have to keep his compo
sure, as he may have to face a senior and All-West Coast Con
ference selection in the 165-pound class.
The first two matches last Saturday helped Stanford iden
tify some specific things that needed improvement. With an
other week of practice under the team's belt, the Cardinal is
looking forward to displaying what they have worked on.
The team's fitness level was indeed a big advantage last Sat
urday, but now the focus shifts to improving on the technical
aspects of wrestling as it looks to bring home its first dual
meet victory of the year from Laramie, Wyo.
Most of the team's mistakes came in small technical as
pects. or slip-ups that their opponents were able to exploit.
The coaching staff prefers to have to deal with these techni
cal problems rather than overall conditioning, since they are
easier to coach away than huge shortcomings in fitness or
motivation. Overall, Stanford wrestlers performed well in
the neutral position (i.e. on their feet) but struggled some
times when down on the mat. Improvement in this area is
critical, especially since mat wrestling seems to be one of the
Cowboys' strongest points.
This week in practice. Stanford has spent the bulk of its
time working on technical aspects and drilling the mat posi
tions. On Friday, the wrestlers also must focus on keeping
their strength up for the entire seven minutes, a lesson they
learned the hard way after several last-minute losses against
Navy and Cal State-Bakersfield.
"Those are the matches we gotta win, if we want to stay
competitive and look towards the Pac-1() and the champi
onships," Borrelli said.
The Cardinal wrestlers also will have to make up for sev
eral gaps in the team lineup because of injuries, including the
injury that forced them to forfeit their heavyweight matches
last weekend.
"Our first goal is keeping the guys healthy," the first year
Stanford head coach added. "Guys need to realize we still
need to wrestle with a few dings. We don't have the depth that
other schools do. even though we may not have more in
juries. so when guys go down, we are down. We're focusingon
healing now."
After their third dual match of the season this Friday, Sat
urday will give Cardinal wrestlers a chance to mix things up
a little with the all-day Cowboy Open tournament, also in
Laramie. There they will compete against opponents they
would not meet in a normal season and can focus on person
al improvement. Schools attending include Wyoming, Utah
Valley. Air Force and Northern Colorado. Boise State, how
ever, will be the team to beat at the tournament as the Bron
cos are ranked 14th nationally and the defending Pac-10
champion.
