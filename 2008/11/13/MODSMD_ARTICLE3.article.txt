Last night. Graduate Student
Council (GSC) members approved
funding requests and discussed vari
ous initiatives.
Asha for Education received a
budget modification in the form of a
$174 funding addition for the group
to rent monitors and purchase addi
tional cables for its event.
The French Stanford Student
Association also received a funding
increase of $400 toward doubling the
size of its wine and cheese event to
include non-French members of the
graduate student community. The
Persian Student Association

received an additional $300, allowing
them to add a food module provid
ing snacks and refreshments to its
classical music workshop series.
The Stanford Alpine Project,
which funds international geological
field trips every few years and is
planning a trip to Iceland this
upcoming summer, was awarded
$700 towards its fundraising chili
cook-off. Sarvodava. a campus com
munity service group, received $750
to hold its Mahatma Gandhi movie
screening event, which will include
dinner for approximately 70-80
expected attendees.
Stanford Color and Wind Energy
Projects and Stanford Student
Biodesign receive $1,6K7 to fund a
speaker series and $610 to hold a
dinner-mixer event featuring an
industry speaker, respectively.
Fen Zhao, a fifth year graduate
student in applied physics, gave a

presentation to the council about her
and chemical engineering graduate
student Ryan Peacock's recent atten
dance at the National Association of
Graduate-Professional Students
(NAGPS) conference.
Zhao outlined the roles various
NAGPS committees plav. addressing
issues such as legislative concerns,
social justice issues, international
student concerns, employment con
cerns and public relations. Zhao is
also the newly elected representative
for employment concerns; she will
attend to healthcare, stipends and
housing matters for graduate stu
dents from all participating colleges
and universities of NAGPS.
Matt Mcl aughlin, CEO oi
Stanford Student Enterprises, spoke
to GSC members about the new ini
tiatives to bring e-ticketing and tick
et distribution to e-groups. He out
lined the administrative and logisti
cal costs of working with the
Stanford Ticketing Office, such as an
event set-up fee. charging an exorbi
tant 3.5 percent fee per credit card
transaction and a $1.50 to four-dol
lar convenience fee on the ticket dis
tribution end.
In comparison, this new transi
tion would only charge a 1.8 to 2.2
percent fee plus a 30-cent transac
tion charge for each credit card
charge moving through the
University system. Though the ticket
distribution and ticket verification at
events are still being hashed out. this

process will keep all the transactions
and the money within the University
system and SSE, as well as make the
entire process more logistically effi
cient and cost-efficient as well.
Mary Van der Hoven. a graduate
student in the earth sciences, and
Peacock were sworn in as official
GSC voting members. They will be
able to begin voting on official GSC
motions beginning next week.
The Council re-voted on and
passed the granting of an additional
$500 from its General Discretionary
Fund to the Nominations
Committee (NomCom) for its offi
cial training dinner. The dinner will
feature Jeff Wachtel, University
President John Hennessey's senior
assistant, and John Friedenrich. a
board member at Stanford Hospital.
