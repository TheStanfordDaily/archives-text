## Former CIA Dir. joins Hoover Q & A JAMES VOOLSEY 
### NIKHIL JOSHI DESK EDITOR 
Hie Hoover Institution is famous for the
neoconservative scholars it attracts. But earlier
this month, the think tank welcomed its first
"greenocon" — former CIA Director-turned
venture-capitalist R. James Woolsev. who
became an Annenberg Distinguished Visitinu

Fellow on Nov. 1.
The Daily spoke with Woolsey about what
brings him to the Hoover Institution, and
about his ongoing work on energy independ
ence issues and national security.
The Stanford Daily (SD): What do you hope to
do as a visiting Hoover fellow?
James Woolsey (JW): Two things: First of all.
I'm out here a fair amount because I am a part
ner at Vantage Point Venture Partners in San
Bruno, working on cleantech and renewable

James Woolsey, who directed the CIA, has joined the Hoover Institution to continue his work on
energy independence and national security.
energy.
I've also been on the task force at
Hoover that [former Secretary of
State] George Shultz chairs on ener
gy. He and I have talked about dis
tributed generation — not just pho
tovoltaics on roofs, but also using
local bio waste as fuel and things
like plug-in hybrids. I'm very inter
ested in local generation of energy
for a number of reasons. Some have
to do with security and some have to
do with the simpler idea of econom
ic development. It's easier to put
photovoltaics in a village in Africa
than to build a giant power plant.
SI): What got you interested in
energy issues?
JW: It was 1973. and I was general
counsel for the Senate Armed
Services Committee, and I was late
for a hearing because I had to sit in
a gas line, because it was in the mid
dle of the Yom Kippur War. I
remember sitting in that gas line
seething that the Saudis cut off our
oil.
In one way or another. I've been
teed off about this issue for 35
years!
Jefferson always thought that
yeoman farmers were important,
and it is the idea that it increases
people's independence if they can
produce locally what they use.
You see this expressed in food a
lot, so people are thinking along
these lines of local production of
things they need, not because we are
all going to become autarkies, but
because it does improve your
resilience to things like terrorist
attacks and all sorts of things if you
can get some share of the key things
that you need locally, whether it is
energy or food.
I've been focusing almost exclu
sively on energy for the last five
years or so.
SD: What do you see as the most
compelling issue that should guide
energy policy in this country?
JW: I think [security and environ
mental concerns] are both impor
tant. and I think the key thing is not
to get bogged down on which is
more important, but to put together

joint efforts that draw on both of
those needs.
As far as I'm concerned, the key
thing is to get people together.
SI): What about the economic
impact of environmentalism?
JYV: That's going to be the biggest
problem going further, because
some of these things we can do and
actually save money, and you want
to focus on things like energy effi
ciency. But some of them are going
to take some investment up front,
and the payback may not be imme
diate. Coming up with the capital to
make the investments in, say. a
smarter electricity grid, is going to
take coming up with some
resources. That looked easier as lit
tle as a month ago than it looks now.
We may find that we have to start
with some of the things that have
short payback periods and hopeful
ly would involve jobs, because, with
Detroit's plants closing down and a
lot of other problems developing
with unemployment, it's hard to get
people to focus on doing anything
cooperative if they don't have a job.
SI): Is this a problem that the gov
ernment needs to be involved with,
or do you think a private sector
approach, through VCs like you. is
preferable?
JW: I tend to think the government
has an important role, but it ought
to not pick the winners. It's tried to
pick the winner in powering autos
twice in 25 years, and it's failed both
times.
I think we had a couple of gov
ernment decisions — synfuel and
hydrogen — that were not wise, and
it's much better if the government's

We have to begin to get on top of
the overall economic situation,
and, if this is a recession, make it
a short one.

job is to break up the monopolies,
and one very important monopoly
that needs to be broken up is oil.
That leads to the problems we've
got with OPEC. If we can, with tax
credits, get people to have batteries
available so they can drive on elec
tricity. and do the same by requiring
flexfuel vehicles, that's very easy.
That will open the market up to
other fuels, and it will also help
break oil's monopoly.
The government shouldn't be in
the business of choosing if we
should be driving on ethanol or
methanol, but it should let the most
effective ones win out so we are not
locked in.
SI): Do you think that the road to
energy independence involves cut
ting back on consumption, or do you
think that technology will improve
so that we don't need to conserve?
JW: 1 think the only way we can
make it possible to do the three
things we have to do with energy —
make it affordable, cleaner and
secure — is going to be with tech
nology.
Let me illustrate. For 150 years, a
lead acid battery was a lead acid
battery. Then consumer electronics
started to drive inventiveness in bat
teries. Look at the current lithium
ion [battery] that people are using in
the vehicles — all of these are com
ing thick and fast now. Although
there weren't any bright new
Stanford grads starting companies
that made batteries from the begin
ning of the University to five years
ago. for the last couple years there
sure have been.
We are having a rapid growth of

battery technology.That will make it
possible to both produce electricity
and use it at a different time from
when it is produced, which is very
hard.
Batteries are in the process of
beginning to make a big change in
the use of electricity for transport,
and the only way you can do that is
with the creative juices flowing in
bright, young
Stanford/MIT/CalTech grads.
SI): Are you optimistic that we'll be
able to solve the energy problem in
a reasonable amount of time?
JW: The problem we've got to get
beyond in order to make the rapid
progress we need in energy is this
current economic crisis. It's spread
from being just something related to
mortgages to something that is dam
aging the whole banking industry
and now is leading to slowdowns in
the economy and layoffs.
It's very hard for any society to
grapple with even extremely impor
tant issues like climate change and
energy security if it has large num
bers of people without jobs.
We have to begin to get on top of
the overall economic situation, and.
if this is a recession, make it a short
one.
Once people start to get a bit
optimistic again, and say that was a
bad year but it's now behind us,
once that happens, we ought to be in
a position to move forward — 1
hope pretty quickly — because a
number of these are going to create
jobs.
We are talking about making
fundamental changes to four or five
of the biggest industries in the
world, and that creates jobs here in
the United States.
If we are producing more of our
fuel domestically, it's not that we are
putting up tariffs, but that is going to
mean more American jobs instead
of hiring Saudi oil field workers.
We can use a turnaround in the
economic situation to build green
collar jobs. It may take some months
to get geared up to do that because
we need to start out working on
things that are going to give us a
quick payback and create jobs, and
that's a difficult set of things to
accomplish simultaneously.
