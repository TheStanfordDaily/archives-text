# Senior Nights cancelled
## Class presidents cancel Nights for rest of quarter; event under review 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES EDITOR IN CHIEF 
After several related hospitaliza
tions and multiple fines incurred for
vomiting on buses, the senior class is
now facing its first sober Thursday of
the year — one without the tradition
al Senior Night.
Tonight's event at Blue Chalk has
been cancelled, while plans for an
additional Senior Night to finish off
the quarter have been scrapped,
according to Dimitar Iliev, one of
four senior class presidents.
"During the past few weeks, there
have been a number vomiting inci
dents on buses." I liev wrote in a Nov.
11 email to the senior class. "As stat
ed in the wavier that you all signed,
each time someone throws up on the
bus, we are automatically charged a
$500 cleaning fee by the bus compa
ny."
While each vomiting incident is
meant to be paid for by the individual
responsible, four cases — one follow
ing the Oct. 2 Senior Night at the
BBC, and three following last
Thursday's San Francisco Senior
Night — have gone without a culprit.
According to Iliev, the $2000 total
fine that the senior class must now
pay in comparison to the typi
cal $1850 spent on a local Senior
Night event — left the presidents no
other choice but to cancel Senior

Night for the rest of the quarter.
"In minimizing the risk to the sen
ior class, there came a turning point
this past week," I liev said in an inter
view with The Daily, "and we ulti
mately wanted to see that our
finances would be all right for the
future, so we canceled the remaining
nights."
Iliev pointed to the need for sav
ing money to be used on other senior
events. He also expects the continua
tion of Senior Night next quarter, fol
lowing reevaluation the implementa
tion of new policies.
The development of a problem
This week's Senior Night cancella
tion. while unexpected, might not
come as a total surprise to students
— especially those seniors who have
bared witness to highly intoxicated
classmates on Thursday nights, or
been seriously drunk themselves.
In its first two weeks — with trips
to Illusions on Oct. 2 and Nola's on
Oct. 9 — Senior Night went off with
relatively few problems, according to
Senior Class President Johnny
McCormick. The third event, howev
er. which took place at the BBC on
Oct. 16. showed signs of a developing
problem.
On Oct. 22, McCormick sent an
email to the senior class noting that
"there were six incidents ranging
from the benign—one classmate
decided to take off her top and roll
around on the ground in her bra —
to the downright dangerous, which
included a hospitalization."
While many seniors responded
with laughter to the former, the hos
pitalization of a student who fell
down the stairs at the BBC was no
laughing matter. And a few weeks
later, with several hospitalizations
in addition to the many vomit cases,
the situation has only gotten more
serious — and the administration is
taking notice.
According to Associate Dean
and Director of Student Activities
Nanci I lowe and Vaden Substance
Abuse Prevention Program
Manager Ralph Castro. Senior
Night has had at least seven related
hospitalizations of students — a
number that causes concern within
the University administration.
"It's not so much the quantity as
it is the quality of the demonstrated
behavior," Castro said. "People are
vomiting frequently, getting carried
off, getting injured and needing to
go to the hospital for alcohol poi
soning because of this event."
While neither Castro nor Howe
were involved in the decision to
cancel this quarter's remaining
Senior Nights — that decision was
made solely by the senior class pres
idents — they said that the high-risk
nature has the University mindful
of further serious incidents.
"The more serious a problem it
becomes for the University." Howe
said, "the more concern develops
over time."
"It's troubling that it's become
such a serious problem, and it's
obviously an incredible liability to
the University." Castro added. "This
is a high-risk event, and the recent
events at specific Senior Nights
aren't just blips on the radar."
A history of issues at Senior Night
Also known as "Pub Night" by
seniors (the event was officially

renamed in 2003 to deemphasize
the alcohol component), the weekly
get-together has been a staple of
senior-year activities for over a
decade, and only developed into a
problem within the past few years.
Two years ago, the Class of 2007
faced a roadblock when the Office
of Student Activities (OSA) held
off a fall-quarter start to Senior
Night following reports of bar scuf
fles. excessive drinking and, much
like this year, vomiting on buses.
As a resolution, the senior class
and OSA developed a waiver for all
students to sign, as well as increased
security on the buses and at the bars
themselves.
"Two years ago, we had the same
problem we do now of people vom
iting and bringing alcohol on the
buses." noted Howe, who was
involved in the negotiations two
years ago. "The waiver was an
attempt to fix that, and it worked to
some degree, but now we're facing
some of the same issues again."
After a decrease in incidents
among last year's senior class, Howe
and Castro are concerned by this
year's resurgence of hospitaliza
tions and misconduct at Senior
Night. They're also alarmed by the
long-term change in tone at Senior
Night.
Castro noted, for example, how
the current Senior Night is a far cry
from its original form, in which sen
iors spent a night out socializing at a
bar — sometimes even with a mem
ber of the University administra
tion, like former University
President Gerhard Casper.
"There's a different view now:
It's a party night now. not a social
night," said Castro, adding that sen
ior classes have come to pregame,
binge drink and think of Senior
Night as an end-of-week outlet,
rather than a sophisticated get
together.
A sign of deeper issues
It's this point that has especially
drawn concern from Castro and the
University administration. While

the past four years have been
marked by a 69-percent decrease in
alcohol-related hospitalizations
among all students, according to
Castro — with 119 hack in the 2(X)4-
2005 academic year and just 37 last
year—this year the University has
seen a growing number of alcohol
related problems, not just at Senior
Night.
"In the fall we always see more
cases, but we have a higher number
of incidents at this point than we did
last year," Castro said of this year's
alcohol-related hospitalizations,
"and the higher number of incidents
makes it seem like we're on track to
break last year's total number."
In the case of alcohol issues at
Senior Night, "it seems like it's
more reflective of the changing pat
terns of drinking on campus,"
Castro said.
Multiple alcohol-related hospi
talizations. including incidents dur
ing New Student Orientation, have
led Castro to believe that something
more is going on when the student
body, and seniors in particular, get
the chance to release their inhibi
tions through alcohol.
"I definitely see it relating to
campus mental health." he said, not
ing the recent efforts by the
University to assess the campus
mental health climate, which result
ed in a report released just last
month. "We're seeing people more
stressed out and then using alcohol
as an outlet.
In explaining the excessive
drinking at Senior Night, Iliev
agreed.
"I think a lot of it has been that
people want to let go," he said. "It's
that time of the quarter when peo
ple get stressed with interviews and
midterms, and they want to have
fun on Thursday nights."
Assessing the current problem
While the Senior Night incidents
may reflect a larger issue of student
alcohol abuse, the senior class pres
idents. along with Howe, Castro and
the rest of the administration, are

currently looking at and reevaluat
ing the Senior Night system.
At the root of the senior class
presidents' decision to cancel
Senior Nights for the quarter are
the fines incurred by people vom
iting on buses. Without people
owning up to their drunken
mishaps, the senior class has had
to be more proactive about
enforcing rules.
"We would always check the
buses afterward to see what prob
lems may have come up, and when
we found vomit, we always tried
talking to people to find out who
was responsible." Iliev said. "We
called people who were on specific
buses to see if they could help us
out and find out who vomited, but
we didn't get very far."
With this year's Senior Night
waiver stipulating a $500 fine stu
dents can expect for bus damage,
few have come forward to accept
their responsibility, or their friend's
responsibility.
According to Transportation
Operations Lead Representative
Ramses Madou. a broker for
Parking & Transportation Services
(P&TS) who works with the senior
presidents in coordinating trans
portation, the University won't
actually know the full extent of the
fines it faces for at least a little while
longer. Last week's San Francisco
Senior Night utilized outside
provider Compass Transportation
— rather than the usual Marguerite
service — and a final report on
damage and related fines has not
yet been received.
Based on the senior class presi
dents' estimate of three vomiting
incidents. Compass Transportation
likely isn't happv about its current
relationship with Senior Night.
"We're not questioning our rela
tionship with Senior Night." Madou
said of offering Marguerite service
to the senior class, "but Compass
Transportation might be question
ing its relationship. This isn't the
first time this has happened, and it
onlv eets harder and harder for

them, I imagine, to agree to deal
with this."
Howe and Castro agreed that the
situation looks poorly on the
University, but said they want to
help find solutions.
"We want to find ways to make it
work." Howe said. "We'll continue
to assist the senior class as long as it
does not become too much of a
high-risk event."
Solving the problem
On the other hand, seniors don't
seem to understand the gravity of
the situation. Howe and Castro
emphasized the need for all seniors
to accept the responsibility and
privilege of attending Senior Night.
"We don't want to create the
expectation that the senior class
presidents have to mop up after
their classmates," Howe said.
"Hopefully, students will come to
see the event as their own — not
the senior class presidents' —
responsibility. Really, this event is a
privilege for seniors, and it seems
people are forgetting that."
"The senior class can send all the
emails, make all the announcements
and have all the waivers it wants,
but in the end it comes down to that
one person who drinks too much —
as well as his or her friends who
should take care of him — to make
the right decision," Castro added.
"That's not happening at the
moment, and that's a problem."
Iliev agreed, noting that the sen
ior class cabinet will continue to
work to address the alcohol prob
lems among individual members of
the senior class.
"We want to hit the root of this
problem, and we need people to
realize what individuals can do to
help stop this from happening again
and having us incur more fines," he
said.
The senior class cabinet is also
soliciting ideas for improvements to
its current system. Following his
Tuesday-night email. Iliev was sur
prised to receive a predominantly
positive response from his class

mates, including practical sugges
tions to improve the situation.
Among these was establishing a col
lective fund which seniors con
tribute to (in the range of one to
five dollars) as a safeguard for fur
ther fines.
Iliev recognized the complaint
seniors may have, however, about
having to pay for their classmates'
misconduct. At the same time, the
current fines must be dealt with and
it's now about working together and
seeking preventive measures, he
said.
"We need people to look out for
each other." added McCormick.
noting the possibility of more senior
class cabinet presence on buses. "If
people see someone in trouble, they
should keep watch, get the help
they need and maybe send them
home in a taxi."
In fact, a formal taxi service is
being considered by P&TS. accord
ing to Madou, so that seniors don't
run the risk of a $500 fine on a bus
when they reach that level of sick
ness.
In the end. however, the solution
lies in the students themselves, as
Castro. Howe and the class presi
dents all emphasized.
"The vast majority of students
make good choices, and we applaud
them for that," Castro said. "It's this
really small minority of students
who make poor choices and change
the whole thing. That minority has
the potential for a large impact,
which I hope they now realize. In
the end. though, everyone has the
responsibility to intervene."
Iliev assured that Senior Nights
"will start back up as normal at the
beginning of winter quarter." and
that the class cabinet will come up
with a better plan beyond the pre
ventive measure of cancellations.
"We don't want to see the senior
night tradition end." he said, "and
we want to leave a positive legacy as
a class."
