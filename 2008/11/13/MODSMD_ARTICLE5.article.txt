# Senior Nights cancelled
## Class presidents cancel Nights for rest of quarter; event under review 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES EDITOR IN CHIEF 
After several related hospitaliza
tions and multiple fines incurred for
vomiting on buses, the senior class is
now facing its first sober Thursday of
the year — one without the tradition
al Senior Night.
Tonight's event at Blue Chalk has
been cancelled, while plans for an
additional Senior Night to finish off
the quarter have been scrapped,
according to Dimitar Iliev, one of
four senior class presidents.
"During the past few weeks, there
have been a number vomiting inci
dents on buses." I liev wrote in a Nov.
11 email to the senior class. "As stat
ed in the wavier that you all signed,
each time someone throws up on the
bus, we are automatically charged a
$500 cleaning fee by the bus compa

While each vomiting incident is
meant to be paid for by the individual
responsible, four cases — one follow
ing the Oct. 2 Senior Night at the
BBC, and three following last
Thursday's San Francisco Senior
Night — have gone without a culprit.
According to Iliev, the $2000 total
fine that the senior class must now
pay in comparison to the typi
cal $1850 spent on a local Senior
Night event — left the presidents no
other choice but to cancel Senior

Night for the rest of the quarter.
"In minimizing the risk to the sen
ior class, there came a turning point
this past week," I liev said in an inter
view with The Daily, "and we ulti
mately wanted to see that our
finances would be all right for the
future, so we canceled the remaining
nights."
Iliev pointed to the need for sav
ing money to be used on other senior
events. He also expects the continua
tion of Senior Night next quarter, fol
lowing reevaluation the implementa
tion of new policies.
The development of a problem
This week's Senior Night cancella
tion. while unexpected, might not
come as a total surprise to students
— especially those seniors who have
bared witness to highly intoxicated
classmates on Thursday nights, or
been seriously drunk themselves.
In its first two weeks — with trips
to Illusions on Oct. 2 and Nola's on
Oct. 9 — Senior Night went off with
relatively few problems, according to
Senior Class President Johnny
McCormick. The third event, howev
er. which took place at the BBC on
Oct. 16. showed signs of a developing
problem.
On Oct. 22, McCormick sent an
