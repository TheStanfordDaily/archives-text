## Former 'Cal Sucks' shirts toned down to 'Beat Cal' 
### MATT SERNA 
Due to University licensing agreements,
the Stanford Store has decided to replace the
traditionally vulgar "Cal Sucks"T-shirts with
a more G-rated selection — "Beat Cal."
According to Bennett Hauser' 10, general
manager of the Stanford Store, the
University handles its licensing externally
through the Collegiate Licensing Company.
Anyone hoping to sell Stanford gear is
required to receive the licensing company's
approval.
"CLC is a trademark licensing agent,"
said Susan Weinstein, manager of Stanford's
trademark licensing program. " ibis means
that various universities and other institu
tions hire CLC to license their trademarks to

third parties who wish to put them on T
shirts and other merchandise."
Stanford's contract with the CLC stipu
lates that Stanford merchandise cannot
defame any other CLC client without con
sent from both sides. Since UC-Berkeley also
licenses through the CLC, the "Cal Sucks"
shirts were deemed a breach of contract.
I lowever. according to Weinstein. it is the
universities, not the CLC, who approve usage
of their brand.
"Although the CLC is an agent of the
University of California, it has no responsi
bility for the decision of whether or not to
license the phrase 'Cal Sucks' for use on a T-
Shirt." she said. "This decision resides with
Cal alone. The CLC's only role is to execute
a license when use of Cat's name has been

approved by Cal."
The Stanford Store was previously
unaware of the need to obtain permission.
"[Last year], we simply didn't know that
we couldn't produce any garments defaming
Cal." Mauser said. "The CLC and both uni
versities were understanding about our error
last year, and let us off with minor penalties
-a $1.()( M) fine, confiscation of extras and a
royalty payment to Berkeley of eight percent
of revenues. The repercussions would likely
be much worse for those who do not regular
ly work with the CLC."
The Student Store saw "Beat Cal" as the
best alternative design to choose. I lauser actu
ally expects the change to increase sales, citing
the new designs as "inclusive" toward easily
offended Stanford community members.

1 lowever, Hauser said increased
sales had no role in the decision to
cease production of "Cal Sucks"
shirts.
He also strongly discouraged stu
dents from making their own "Cal
Sucks" shirts, claming that "anyone
who attempts to do so without the
CL( "s consent could face stiff fines or
worse."
Despite the change. Hauser is confi-

dent that the Stanford Store will continue to
push for "Cal Sucks" designs in the future.
"We will likely submit 'Cal Sucks' as a
design every year, but it's up to the
University representatives to decide whether
it will be approved." I la user said. "Perhaps if
it's combined with a certain back they will

allow it to return, but it's
impossible to speculate."
Weinstein seemed a bit
less optimistic about a
potential return.
"Stanford and Cal both
agree that we want to
encourage rivalry between
our schools which is within
the boundaries of reason-

able good taste." she said. "We both believe
that this phrase falls below that standard.
Stanford has discouraged submission of this
phrase for license by Cal repeatedly — not
just this year."
