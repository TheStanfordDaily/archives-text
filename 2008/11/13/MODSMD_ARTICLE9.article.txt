## Lingering issues give election campaigners a political hangover 
### GEA KANG DESK EDITOR 
"lt left a great vacuum,"said Anton
Zietsman "12. "This entity had a great
presence in our lives and from one day
to the next, it evaporated. It went from
front stage to background noise, I
think, which is understandable."
Zietsman, who went to Las Vegas
to campaign for President-elect
Barack Obama during election week,
isn't the only one feeling such a void
now that "this entity" — the election
— has come and gone.
Scout Sanders 11. Toyon Hall's
dorm rep for the Student Voter Regis
tration Coalition, was another Obama
supporter who took to Las Vegas dur
ing election week — as well as Reno
twice before that.
"It feels weird." Sanders said. "I
sort of felt defined by it — everyone
knows me as the 'girl who's into
Obama." It's kind of like what I do
with my life. But at the same time it's
kind of a relief that it's over. You have
time to breathe."
Oh. and time to sleep, too. Or at
least a little more than in the past cou
ple months, that is.
The evening after the election re
sults came out. Greg, a grad student
who asked that his last name not be
published for privacy reasons, napped
for just four hours.
"I just want to be a normal person,"
he added with a tired smile.
And it's hard to blame Greg after
he poured almost 400 hours into the
"No on Prop. 8" campaign.
Angelina Cardona'l 1, who will fol
low her out-of-state campaigning for
Obama full-circle with a ticket to his
Jan. 20 inauguration, also said that
she's now "sleeping a little more, actu
ally going to class and working more
days at my job with F4Ed."
"There's mostly less stress in our
lives." said Randy Stoltenberg, a doc
toral candidate in chemistry who cam
paigned in favor of Proposition 8.
"[My wife and I] are back to life as it
was before we started campaigning in

August."
But amidst the newfound extra
hours in the day, student campaigners
and groups are already looking ahead.
Stanford Students for Choice, a
group that campaigned against Propo
sition 4. will be focusing on providing
comprehensive sex education and
"making sure that reproductive health
remains accessible," according to co
president Emily Gasner '09.
Yet although the groups are mov
ing on. they're not forgetting what was
on the ballot. ITie Stanford Theatre
Activist Mobilization Project
(STAMP), for instance, has chosen to
stage a production based on queer
rights for its winter play.
"While we are no longer attempt
ing to gain votes and defeat proposi
tions. the importance of informing
people about what you believe is no
less valuable and in no way do the is
sues disappear," Gasner said.
Sanders agreed, although she also
wondered what would continue to
glue students together.
"It's satisfying that something I put
so much effort into turned out so
well." she said. "At the same time, it
kind of makes me sad that it's been
such a movement for kids our age. and
1 wish there was some way for that
movement to continue in as tangible a
way as the election. It's kind of hard
figuring a way to keep that motivation
going."
Nonetheless, for Sanders, the cam
paign served as a catalyst for sparking
her interest in political activism and
working with the government in
Washington, D.G
Zietsman.too.is following up more
specifically on what he says sent him to
Nevada in the first place: public serv
ice.
"I applied for a vice president posi
tion at the Roosevelt Institute. I sched
uled meetings with my professors to
discuss possible ways of getting in
volved in the community and I joined
the Judicial Panel Committee," he
said. "However. I felt rather inconse
quential — that is. not having a signif

icant enough impact. When I go back
into politics. I want to reach a broader
public and truly have palpable conse
quence."
Touche.
"1 want my life to be queer rights
activism,"said Laura Wadden '09,wh0
campaigned against Proposition 8 on
top of 24 hours of varsity swim prac
tice a week; she has also previously
been involved in antiwar activism.
"I've never been as passionate about a
cause. 1 found it in Prop. 8."
Same goes for Jamie Tam '10. an
other "No on 8" campaigner.
"This has affected me in such a
powerful way,"Tam said. "I was never
an activist, but I feel that this has made
me an activist forever."
Still more students must be in the
same boat, as the Student Coalition
for Marriage Equality (SCME) gath
ered to take immediate action in the
hours after the election, staying up
until 4 a.m., organizing rallies for the
next day.
Although Greg half-jokingly said.
"I can stop wearing my purple T-shirt
now." he knows that doesn't mean his
work is over.
For one thing. SCME needs to
fundraise $3,000 to fill funding holes
from the campaign.
On the activism side, a "No on 8"
campaigners' gathering — which Tam
said was intended to be "a kind of clo
sure.but also more of a forward-think
ing thing" — held the night after the
election saw the first sign-up sheet for
a new queer rights activist group on
campus. Already underway. "The
Emma Goldman Society for Oueer
Liberation," named after a rabbit that
S TAMP founder and director Aman
da Gelender '10 owns, is charging
ahead with its first demonstration to
morrow at noon in White Plaza.
"Good things have come out of it."
Tam said. "We're hoping this spirit of
activism will continue. Very few peo
ple can look back and say they tried to
change the world, and these people in
volved did. I'm really proud of the his
tory that we made here at Stanford, of

how massive and truly monumental
this was."
Indeed, wherever they were last
Tuesday — huddled around an old
laptop with a live MSNBC feed in Las
Vegas, like Zietsman was; eyeing the
poll counts scribbled on the pieces of
paper posted under the LGBT-CRC
TV. like Wadden: or waiting anxiously
at the CoHo, like Cardona — and
whether they were crying and scream
ing in joy or sorrow by the end of the
night, the campaigners had no regrets.
"There is nothing I wish I could
have done differently." said Norris
Mei' 11. a "No on 8" campaigner."The
reason why I gave the campaign my all
is because I didn't want to wake up on
Election Day to regret anything or
wish I had done more."
And for the time being, while
groups like SCME are continuing to
make statements with rallies and
protests, waiting and observing will
also be important elements for stu
dent campaigners across the board.
"I truly feel that the effort was so
intense to get Obama elected that
people are recovering and now are
leaving the work lip to him and his fu
ture administration." Zietsman said.
"Perhaps we are now waiting to see
what will happen."
"I don't think we should force the
momentum." Gelender added. "I
think we should move swiftly, but take
enough time. I'm excited to see what's
coming out of it."
The election may indeed be just
background noise now. but it certainly
is lingering background noise.
As Tarn put it. looks like "it's not
over."
