# Intoducing: heavy metal
## intermission shows you the nuts and bolts of this misunderstood music genre 
### 
Few music genres are as diverse or as misunderstood as
heavy metal. Encompassing musical sounds from
Cookie Monster-esque screaming to the high-pitched
and makeup-stained bar anthems of the '80s, metal is truly
one of the largest classifications of music, primarily charac
terized by powerhouse vocals hacked by roaring guitars and
enough musical intricacy to keep Mozart occupied for days.
Contrary to popular belief, metal is not non-stop
screaming, accompanied by frantic drumming and screech
ing guitars thrashing away. That's a stereotype which has
been cultivated (and in some cases re-enforced) while
being, in a broad sense, incorrect.
The genre known as heavy metal was arguably created
in 1968 with the formation of the now-legendary Black
Sabbath. I leaded by the infamous Ozzv Osbourne, this
British quartet took the classic rock of the day and slowed it
down, giving it a slower, drearier, heavier sound and in so
doing, creating the beginnings of what we know today as
heavy metal.
In the beginning, metal was much too new and too dif
ferent to be widely accepted. Sabbath was shunned and
blasphemed by music critics, but it quickly picked up a cult
following. As the years went by and Sabbath sold more and
more albums, a wider and wider audience was introduced
to the concept of metal. Eventually mixing with the popular
"punk" music of the day, metal made its way across the
ocean to the United States.
In 1981, drummer Lars Ulrich*asked friend lames
Hetlleld to join him in recording a few tracks of a "new
style" of music. Two years later, the newly christened
Metallica released its first album, "Kill 'Em All" and a revo
lution began. If Black Sabbath created heavy metal, then
many will say Metallica brought it to the masses.
From Metallica's humble beginnings, many more acts
spawned and began bringing their own style to the masses.
Metallica was soon joined in clubs and stadiums by groups
such as Anthrax, Pantera, Megadeth and Slayer.
However, metal did not have a uniquely American
upbringing. At the same time as the rise of the American
metal scene, Europe's own underground artists began to
rise to the top. With the rise of bands such as Iron Maiden,

Dio and Judas Priest, and the continuing staying power of
Black Sabbath, Europe set its own foothold in the metal
genre.
With its increasing popularity worldwide, metal has
undergone a new and powerful rebirth in the last decade.
Massive numbers of genres and sub-genres have been creat
ed, established and torn down. What follows is and intro
duction to the most prominent and recognizable genres
and bands that exemplify them.
Heavy Metal/Metal: Early heavy metal is loud and heavy
rock and roll. Classic rock by foundation, but pissed off in
execution, heavy metal introduced the concepts of high
speed "riffage" and extended soloing to mainstream music.
Metal has subdivided and mutated so often during its
almost 30 years of existence that it is largely an umbrella
term now. Bands that were big and influential enough to
claim this as namesake include Black Sabbath, Dio, ludas
Priest, Iran Maiden and Metallica.
Download:
Black Sabbath: "War Pigs"
Iron Maiden: "The Trooper"
Metallica: "Master of Puppets"
Thrash Metal: Thrash metal took the in-your-face attitude
and speed of punk and mixed it with the loud and technical
rifling of heavy metal. This genre was the first that intro
duced screaming as a primary way of singing. Thrash went
on to later give rise to early death metal, and arguably the
recent nu-metal revolution as well. Bands such as Anthrax,
SlaveTfPantera, and Megadeth exemplify this style of music.
Download:
Megadeth: "Holy Wars" (The Punishment Due)
Slayer: "Raining Blood"
Pantera: "Cowboys from Hell"
Death Metal: Out of the young genre of thrash came death
metal. This is where oil the stereotypes originate! loud and
obnoxious drumming, crass, fast and heavy guitar play and

almost exclusively screaming vocals. Groups such as
Cannibal Corpse, Kreator and Entombed head this inten
tionally inaccessible style of music.
Download:
Cannibal Corpse: "Hammer Smashed Face"
Kreator: "Betrayer"
Entombed: "Left Hand Path"
Melodic Death Metal: An evolutionary step above death
metal, melodic death metal still maintains the screaming
vocals, but also mixes in clean vocal styles and a much
more orchestrated, intricate and epic sound. Melo-death, as
it is commonly called, has many sub-genres within itself,
mostly organized bv geographic origin of bands. The most
popular melodic death bands are Opeth, Arch Enemy,
Children of Bodom and In Flames.
Download:
Opeth: "The Drapery Falls"
Children of Bodom: "In Your Face"
In Flames: "Crawl Through Knives"
Power Metal: A genre almost completely unique to conti
nental Europe, power metal was purified in the early'9os.
With lyrical work ranging from outright nerdy (albums
based on J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Lord of the Rings") to over
the-top (the retellyjgjof Dante Alghieri's "Inferno" or
Homer's "The Odyssey" V power metal begs the fantasy
mindset. Backed by incredibly technical musicians, and
arguably some of the best singers in all of metal, power
metal does everything from retelling epic poems to writing
operas. Popular power metal bands include Blind Guardian,
Iced Earth, Dragonforce and Sonata Arctica.
Download:
Blind Guardian: "Mirror Mirror"
Dragonforce: "Through the Fire and the Flames"
Iced Earth: "Ten Thousand Strong"
Black Metal: A very dark and bleak detachment from the
metal world, born in Norway during the metal revolution of
the '90s, black metal features highly orchestrated synthesiz
ers, dramatic guitar and vocal work and dark source materi
al. With lyrics often focusing on anti-Christian and some
times violent themes, black metal stays a very unique and
specific genre headlined by bands like Dimmu Borgir,
Behemoth and Emperor.
Download:
Dimmu Borgir: "The Serpentine Offering"
Behemoth: "At the Left Hand of God"
Emperor: "Empty"
Metalcore: An umbrella term most often used to describe
hybrid bands that have fused multiple styles of rock, punk
and metal, the metalcore genre has exploded in the last five
years, with top-10 Billboard debuts and sell-out shows
across the country. The true face of modern American
metal, metalcore is headlined by bands such as Lamb of
God, Killswitch Engage, Trivium, Slipknot and All That
Remains.
Download:
Lamb of God: "Laid to Rest"
Killswitch Engage: "Rose of Sharyn"
All That Remains: "This Calling"
Industrial Metal: The essences of metal mixed with the
mechanical sounds of some techno and heavy industrial
music brought forth the concept of industrial metal. With

much of the instrumentation coming from digital sampling
and synthesizers, the industrial metal genre is personified by
acts such as Rammstein, Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson.
Download:
Rammstein: "Sonne"
Rob Zombie: "Dragula"
Marilyn Manson: "The Nobodies"
Hair Metal: This is the stuff your mom may have listened to
and the singles you will hear everywhere from frat parties to
weddings. Very poppy and commercial, hair metal was all
the permed hair, makeup and spajidex pants money could
buy, mixed with distortion and guitars. This group proudly
showcases bands like Van Halen, Poison, Journey and Bon
Jovi.
Download:
Journey: "Separate Ways" 0
Van Halen: "Jump"
Bon Jovi: "You Give Love a Bad Name"
Progressive Metal: The most musically and technically com
plex of all the genres, many music aficionado? will argue
that progressive (or prog) metal isn't metal at all. Most prog
bands sound nothing alike, but merely share the same goal
of creating very intricate and multifaceted music. Weird
time signatures and jaw-dropping guitar, bass and drun?
work abound in prog. The legends of the genre include
Dream Theater, Symphony X, Tool and Rush.

Download:
Dream Theater: "A Change of Seasons"
Tool: "Lateralus"
Rush: "2112"
Nu-Metal: The most recent showing of change in the metal
world, nu-metal has hit mainstream America prominently
in the past decade. Mixing rap, pop, puuk and old metal,
nu-metal combines the old and obscure and mixes it with
the popular and trendy. While most veteran metalheads will
snub their noses at the supposed "sellout" nature of the
genre, its popularity is undeniable. Nu-Metal contains many
different acts and styles; among them are bands such as
Korn, Disturbed, System of a Down and Linkin Park.
Download:
. . .*• ' • . ' .c
Korn: "Freak on a Leash"
System of a Down: "Chop Suey!"
Linkin Park: "In The End"
