# Renemed efforts boost Metallica's "Death Magnetic"
## 
### 
When it comes to heavy metal, few bands can claim
the title of patron saints of the genre as well as
Metallica. Since their conception in 1981,
Metallica has gone on to become one of the best-selling and
most well-known bands of all time. Now, nearly 30 years after
their first full CD release, Metallica is still rocking with the
release of their 10th studio album, "Death Magnetic."
After a lackluster 2003 outing titled "St. Anger," many
considered Metallica both over the hill and irrelevant. And
who could really argue? It was hard to muster any excitement
for a band that hadn't put out a positively reviewed album in
over a decade and whose most recent offering sounded like it
had been recorded in a garage, on trash cans, by an angst
filled set of middle-school rockers.
Fortunately for metal fans and the Metallica die-hards,
the kings of metal have comfortably reaffirmed their place
and used their experience for something other than impo
tently fighting music piracy
"Death Magnetic," from start to finish, is far and away
the most complete album since the band's self-titled 1991
release, maybe even since 1988's "... And Justice for All."
Gone arc the horrible production values of "St. Anger" and
the pseudo alt-rock attempts of the "Load" and "Reload" era.
This is old-school Metallica: angry, fast and loud.
The album opens with a heartbeat track as the band
kicks in to "That Was Just Your Life." Featuring rhythm and

vocal work reminiscent of the band's thrash foundations, the
song starts the modern trip down Metallica memory lane
that sets the tone for the entire album.
"Magnetics" first single,"The Day That Never Comes," is
a slow power-ballad. Albeit catchy, the song is fairly monoto
nous, never quite getting beyond the pace it sets for itself
with its introduction. And at a whopping eight minutes, it
becomes almost too much to bear by the end.
The extended song length is not the exception for the
album. In fact, the shortest song on the album clocks in at
just over five minutes in length, with the longest song, the
instrumental "Suicide & Redemption," reaching 10 minutes.
The longer songs allow for much greater flexibility in
writing, but the band seems to be hit-and-miss on how well
they pull it off. Some songs could definitely stand to lose a
minute or two, though true Metallica fans will doubtlessly be
ecstatic at the extended playtime.
The true gems of the album come in the riff-heavy
metal-fests "All Nightmare Long,""Broken, Beat & Scarred"
and"The End of the Line." All of these songs feature unique
melodies and absolutely relentless metal rhythm and pacing
that will remind listeners of what made this band great in the
first place.
Overall, the band is in top shape. James Hetfield's vocals
and infamous right hand speed arc better than ever. Lars still
doesn't do much, but by all accounts that is probably for the

best. Kirk Hammett definitely makes himself more promi
nent, with longer and more eclectic soloing throughout the
album. Although his solos could be comfortably packaged
and resold on a CD titled "Kirk Rediscovers his 'Wah' Pedal"
it is still welcome to hear Hammett get back to doing what he
does best, shredding fret boards and melting faces.
"Death Magnetic" is also bassist Rob Trujillo's first full
album with the band, having been added after "St. Anger"
was put into post-production. Trujillo fits in well, keeping to
his root notes and background rhythm with pride and giving
Metallica its deep, bassy punch.
For the collection of veteran 40-year-old rockers that
Metallica is, "Death Magnetic" is about as good an album as
one could have hoped for them to put out. It effectively
recaptures the energy and passion of their youthful efforts,
while showing the refined production and experimental song
writing that comes with experience.
Distilling the best elements of the band's long history of
thrash and modern rock, Hetfield and crew have composed
some instant, metal classics that will immediately reaffirm the
faith of any lapsed Metallica fan.
