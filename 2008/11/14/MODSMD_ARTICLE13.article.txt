Morcheeba: "Slow Down"
Morcheeba drips with sensu
ality. The British band blends trip
hop, rock and rhythm and blues to
create a truly sublime musical
experience that was surely intend
ed to be a sultry bedtime sound
track. (They even have a song
called,"Undress Me Now"!) Skye
Edwards' rich, honey-smooth
vocals lull listeners into an erotic
trance as she coos:
When the day is through
All you got to do is slowdown ...
Lovage: "To Catch a Thief"
Lovage's one and only album
speaks for itself: "Music to Make
Love to Your Old Lady By," an out
rageously entertaining and sexy
ode to love-making in all forms
and fashions. DI Kid Kuala turns
tables and infuses the songs with
tasty samples as Jennifer Charles
purrs to her cat burgling lover:
Come in off that rooftop
You're so handsome dressed in black
See you in the shadows
I'd like to see you on your back ...
Bjork: "Joga"
If any song is reflective of
love-making itself, "Joga" wins the
prize. Volcanic beats and swelling

romantic strings wrap themselves
around listeners like silken sheets,
building delicious anticipation.
Then Bjork finally bursts into a
soaring chorus, with lyrics beauti
fully encapsulating the explosive
climax described and induced:

And you push me up to this

State of emergency,
How beautiful to he,
State of emergency,
Is where I want to be

Led Zeppelin:
"Whole Lotta
Love"
Raunchy,
rowdy and rockin,'
"Whole Lotta
Love" is perfect for

naughty, playful, experi

mental sex. Turn it up loud so

the neighbors can't hear you!
Robert Plant's bluesy roots shine
as he wails teasingly about all of
the dirty things he'll do to his bad,
bad girl. And he doesn't beat
around the bush:
Way, way down inside, I'm gonna
give you my love,
I'm gonna give you every inch of my
love,
Gonna give you my love

Massive Attack: "Teardrop"
, Yes, it's the theme song for the
TV series, "House," but separated
from this rather clinical context,
the song never fails to seduce.
Pulsing drum beats and surging
strings blended with Liz Fraser's
(from the Cocteau Twins) smooth,
breathy vocals and lusciously poet
ic lyrics are sure to have lovers'
hearts beating and libidos soaring.

Nine Inch Nails: "Closer"
Why not end

with a bang (or per
haps the crack of a
whip)? Drenched in
harsh electronic beats,
with Trent Reznor's

gruff sing/whisper piercing
m through the chaos, "Closer"

stirs up wonderfully wicked
thoughts of leather and handcuffs.
Or perhaps it's simply the infa
mously profane lyrics "I want to
f**k you like an animal. I want to
feel you from the inside," that bring
out one's inner beast.
Intoxicatingly catchy, the song
may have you begging to be violat
ed.
