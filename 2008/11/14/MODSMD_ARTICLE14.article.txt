# Bond is back, and cute as ever
## "Quantum of Solace" replaces 007 charm with more 007 action 
### 
Few would doubt the awesomeness of
Daniel Craig's first foray into the world
of James Bond: the 2006 hit "Casino
Royale." While some initially seethed over the
loss of the previous Bond, Pierce Brosnan,
and others lamented Clive Owen not being
chosen, one can easily argue that Daniel
Craig silenced all if not most of his critics
after the film's American release. Bond was
back. He was now blonde, buff and with the
sexiest pout ever seen on a straight man.
Craig's 2008 return as Bond in
"Quantum of Solace" is therefore unsurpris
ingly exciting — riveting, even. Audiences
know what to expect when they take their
seats: sexy Bond charm, and serious actions
sequences as quick-cut scenes show Craig
hurling bad guys from one end of a room to
the other.
The film continues where "Royale" left
off, with Bond racing through the streets of
Siena, Italy with the incapacitated Mr. White
in the back of his car. Never once breaking a
sweat, Bond sends cars careening into trucks,
crashing into mountainsides and flipping
over in flames all the while maintaining his
signature pout. We learn of Mr. White's affili
ation with a suspicious organization called
Quantum, but he escapes with the aid of a
secret henchman before Bond and leader of
the MI6 organization, M (played by Dame
Judi Dench) can effectively question him.
What follows are more five-minute

bursts of sprinting through the
city and acrobatic leaps across
homes and temples. As the film
progresses, Craig, ever poised
and prepared to meet any chal
lenge (including the lack of trust
from his boss and colleagues)
angles his way through a high
speed boat chase, a surreptitious
interruption of terrorists at an
opera and a fast-approaching
Bolivian uprising.
Without releasing too much
information about the film, it is

safe to say that whatever one
thinks the movie will be about at

the beginning will surely have their ideas
trumped by the end. One satisfying aspect of
both "Royale" and "Quantum" is that they
leave the audience completely fooled about
the true nature of Bond's relationships with
friends and rivalries with enemies.
In "Quantum" especially, no one is ever
fully trustworthy — several main characters
are left just as surprised as the audience. For
a film that will earn praise mostly for its
action sequences and Craig's highly antici
pated second performance, the plot twists are
a refreshing means of garnering interest in
other aspects. After all, unless the director
does something particularly novel (think
Japanese samurai flick "Versus") or in a
somewhat cheesy, old-school style

(Tarantino's "Kill Bill") it does not take long
for moviegoers to tire of speeding cars blow
ing up in slow motion or macho men
thumping each others' heads against the wall
But part of where "Quantum" loses its
appeal comes from its loss of the main char
acter, Bond. James Bond has very specific
characteristics that make the 007 movies
enjoyable. He's suave, sexy, cool and
resourceful. One rarely sees a hint of conster
nation or worry in his expression. While
Craig certainly possessed these qualities in
"Royale," any secret agent in "Quantum"
could have easily replaced him — even a not
so-spectacular one. Some quintessential ele
ments of Bond are there, particularly his
ability to easily blend and morph into any

surrounding, but the rest of the movie seems
as if Craig is simply going through the
motions.
It is possible that this is not entirely
Craig's fault, as some will notice a change in
the movie's direction. In "Royale," director
Martin Campbell loved zoomed-in close-ups
of Craig's face, highlighting the charming
squint in his eyes and, yes, that adorable
pout. Conversely, "Quantum" is a series of
wide-view shots and fast-cut scenes. Director
Marc Forster could have hired a generic
blond actor and saved the money.
