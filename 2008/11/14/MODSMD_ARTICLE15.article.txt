# SF's de Young honors Asian American Art
## 
### 
The range and breadth of the latest
exhibit at San Francisco's de Young
Museum is striking, though not sur
prising. After all, any collection featuring
more than 70 artists working over a span of
70 years is bound to have some variety.
The cohesive thread in the collection is
not the artwork but the artists, all of whom
arc of Asian ancestry. The collection —
"Asian/American/Modern Art: Shifting
Currents, 1900-1970" — showcases a diverse
field of artists with influences spanning from
Pollock to Rothko, and styles from Japanese
brushstrokes to Western collage.
History Professor Gordon Chang, who
has worked for years to assemble the exhibit's
art, said the wide span of pieces is one of the
most notable features of the exhibit.
"One can't make generalizations about
the art, and that makes it exciting," Chang
said in an interview with Intermission.
But as Chang sat at his desk, before the
hundreds of historical volumes on his
shelves, it was apparent that the exhibit was
exciting in another, though much different,
respect. Although many of the books in
Chang's collection presented a

picture of Asian-American life in some
aspect, none offered the detailed portrait that
Chang had through his work assembling the
collection. Indeed, "Shifting Currents" is the
first comprehensive survey of Asian-
American modernism.
"This group of artists has been woefully
neglected and overshadowed," Chang said.
In fact, added Chang, much of the art
came from the basements and attics of the
artists' family members. That is not to say
that none of the artists featured have found
fame — Nam lune Paik, for instance, makes
an appearance with his conceptual sculpture
"TV Clock" (1963). And the work of artist
Yayoi Kusama — though she, too, is generally
more renowned for her performance art — is
showcased in the form of one of her large
scale paintings from the Infinity Nets series,
coming from the private collection of none
other than Frank Stella.
And yet, many artists in this collection
have been ignored or forgotten over time.
Their inclusion in the exhibit now presents a
unique view of art history through a fusion
of Asian and Western styles.
Chang's own father, Shu-chi Chang,

serves as an example of this stylistic blend.
The elder Chang was commissioned by the
Chinese government in 1940 to paint a con
gratulatory gift for President Franklin D.
Roosevelt for his second reelection. The
result was "Messengers of World Peace," a
vast scroll painted over with white doves and
pink blossoms. While the Chinese elements
of the piece are clear, the American influence
is subtly demonstrated by the hybrid of west
ern oil painting techniques and Chinese
brushstrokes.
Later pieces, however, showcase the
blend of Western and Eastern motifs more
overtly. Walasse Ting's "Black and White"
(1958) depicts a modernist permutation of a
Chinese character. The bold, contrasting
strokes bear a strong resemblance to the
work of abstract expressionist painter Franz
Kline.
Through pieces like Ting's, the line
between Western and Eastern influences
becomes all the more blurred. Several of the
paintings are strikingly reminiscent of criti
cally recognized Western styles such as
abstract expressionism. Throughout the exhi
bition, a fascinating tension arises from the

balancing act between the "Asian" and the
"American" influences that comprise Asian-
American art. How this overlooked collection
of artists chooses to incorporate, synthesize
and reinterpret these tropes is one of the
defining themes of the exhibit.
Chang emphasized this point, indicating
that the hybrid nature of the art led to
extraordinary works.
"Art and artists often recognize no
boundaries," Chang said. "There is a lot of
cross-fertilization."
"Asian/American/Modern Art: Shifting
Currents, 1900-1970" is on view through Jan.
18 at the de Young Museum in San Francisco.
Ticket price is $20 adults, $17 seniors, $16
youths age 13-17 and students with a college
I.D.
