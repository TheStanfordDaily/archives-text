# The 						drama continues
## "Dining Room, Home, Tomb, Decaying Hole and Empty Room" 
### 
Mhe drama department's
second installment in its
season of original works
inspired by T.S. Eliot's "The Waste Land"
debuted Thursday. "Dining Room, Home,
Tomb, Decaying Hole and Empty Room," a
play written and directed by fifth-year grad
uate student in drama Ileana Drinovan
draws not only from Eliot's masterwork, but
from two of Seneca's plays, "Thyestes" and
"Agamemnon," which chronicle through
multiple generations the murderous history
of a single family. The resulting amalgam of
Roman tragedy and modernist satire is an
imaginative, though thoroughly disturbing,
performance piece.

The development of "Dining Room,
Home, Tomb" began over a year ago as
Drinovan, the director, began pulling text
from Seneca and Eliot. After selecting a cast,
Drinovan asked actors to listen to readings
of "The Waste Land" and Seneca's plays, and
then to search for recordings that contained
similar elements.
In an interview with Intermission,
Drinovan said she wanted to, "let the words
speak for themselves," and cut through con
text and preconceived notions to arrive at
the text itself and then "make it human."
Actor Florentina Mocano, also a drama doc
toral student, focused on "words being like
fire," which is "being passed on."

The narrative itself concentrates on two
stories from the Seneca plays: the slaying of
Thyestes' (Ronnie Tisdale) sons by his
brother Atreus (Phillip Balliet), and the
murder of Agamemnon (Matthias Maat) by
his wife Clytemnestra (Valentina Conde).
Uniting the two stories is the spirit of the
mad Cassandra, the concubine of
Agamemnon (Florentina Mocanu). Direct
quotations of Eliot and motifs employed in
"The Waste Land" such as fire and the color
violet weave throughout the script, and the
acting is solid overall, with particularly
affective performances from the two female
leads.
As is characteristic of drama depart
ment shows, "Dining Room, Home, Tomb"
does not lack for spectacle. Costumes are
striking, helping to advance the Baroque
aesthetic of the season's productions. Staged
outdoors in front of the Stanford
Mausoleum, the show begins at dusk with
an auspiciously timed full moon rising over
the trees. Actors appear like specters in the
darkness as they move towards the tomb,
and disappear back into the shadows as they
exit the stage. In a play about ghosts and
being haunted by ones past, the setting

complements the action perfectly, making
the performance all the more creepy.
1 applaud the drama department for
producing original works and the directors
of projects for their astounding creativity.
However, my recurring concern for the
drama department's season is that its per
formances will be inaccessible for audiences
not composed of English scholars and
drama majors. Just as one cannot grasp the
entirety of "The Waste Land" upon first
reading, the performances in "The Waste
Land Project" cannot be appreciated, or
sometimes even understood, without sub
stantial research into the literature from
which they draw influence.
This is not to say that the department
should not take risks — this should be a
goal of college theater — but I worry that an
entire season of "The Waste Land Project"
may frustrate untrained audiences and dis
courage the future participation of actors
with a more traditional background.
