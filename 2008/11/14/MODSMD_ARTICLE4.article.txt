# Symphony to celebrate Prokofiev, Dvořák in fall concert
## 
### 
Stanford Symphony Orchestra Music
Director and Conductor Jindong Cai
describes the theme of tonight's fall con
cert as "romantic nationalism." Both pieces on
the program, Sergei Prokofiev's Piano Concerto
No. 3 — with concerto competition winner
and soloist Christine McLeavey — and Antonin
Dvorak's Symphony No. 9 ("From the New
World") hold true to Cai's description: each
romantic-era piece expresses a sense of emo
tion and wonder that will not disappoint.
Energized from a summer 2008 concert
tour of China, the symphony approaches the
ambitious concert with gusto.
"After the China tour, our brass section is
very solid," Cai said. "The strings and wood
winds are excellent, and all of us are very active,
working as an orchestra."
Cai stressed that above all, "It is important
for us to continue to make music, with [the
orchestra's! interests in mind. We try to use our

music to bring a different kind of experience
for our audience to examine."
First on the program is Prokofiev's Piano
Concerto No. 3. Although piano concerti gen
erally have fantastic piano parts, the orchestra
tion is at times less than enjoyable. Not so in
the Prokofiev. Throughout, the piece has a close
relationship between piano and orchestra, with
shining solo moments in both parts. The lyrical
and virtuosic characteristics of the piano por
tions showcase soloist McLeavey's great ability.
McLeavey described Prokofiev as a com
poser that, "also wrote Romeo and Juliet as a
ballet, and wrote film music. His music has lots
of drama, and lots of variety." Each movement,
she explained, includes a unique feature to add
to the overall piece.
"The piece goes from vulgarity and anger,
to gentle listening, to a passionate romantic
ending," she said. In particular, McLeavey cited
the middle of the second movement as a gor-

geous dichotomy between the piano and
strings.
Concluding the concert will be Dvorak's
Symphony No. 9, famously known as the "New
World Symphony." Dvofak wrote this final
symphony during a visit to the United States,
where, as Cai explained,"[Dvorak] was influ
enced by his Czech background, folk and
American music." Throughout all the move
ments, the listener is aware of a sense of fanfare
that the title "From the New World" invokes.
Dvorak's careful use of contrasting solemn and
lively orchestration keeps the listener involved.
The fourth movement especially is a moment
where Cai's energized orchestra will impress.
The orchestra will follow its fall concert
with a winter quarter that includes more con
temporary pieces by composers from Israel,
North Korea, China, Iran and Japan.
"We try to play contemporary pieces to
study different cultures through the symphony

as a medium," Cai said. The spring quarter will
wrap up the season with an all-Brahms con
cert, with the notable exception of a Beethoven
violin concerto, a nod to the more traditional
symphony repertoire.
Dvorak's "New World Symphony," and
Prokofiev's Piano Concerto No. 3 share roman
tic roots and a sense of nationalism drawn
from their respective, national musical legacies.
Dvorak's Czech and Prokofiev's Russian influ
ence, combined with their romanticism, cer
tainly is a musical challenge for any orchestra.
Cai and the Stanford Symphony Orchestra,
however, are certainly up for the challenge.
The Stanford Symphony Orchestra will be
performing tonight at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. Student tickets cost five dollars,
while general admission is $10.
