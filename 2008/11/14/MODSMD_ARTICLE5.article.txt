# "The Scales of Memory," a night worth remembering
## 
### 
Art is about tension, and there was plenty of it in
Urban Bush Women and Compagnie Jant-Bi's cross
cultural dance performance, Les ecaillcs tic la menwire
("The Scales of Memory"). The Lively Arts sponsored show,
which took place Wednesday, was co-commissioned by
DANCECleveland and with funding from the 2006 Joyce
Award and Christopher Newport University's Ferguson
Center for the Arts, brought together two cross-Atlantic
dance companies.
Urban Bush Women, founded in 1984, is a dance compa
ny based in Brooklyn, N.Y. Founded by choreographer Jawole
Wila Jo Zollar, Urban Bush Women tries to express the expe
riences of the powerless and marginalized. Compagnie Jant-
Bi, on the other hand, was created more recently — in 1998
— and in Toubab Dialaw, Senegal. Artistic director Germaine
Acogny leads the group.
These two companies spent three years together, learning
about each other's cultures and each other's dances. The
result was a complex, paradoxical piece of art, "Scales," a

series of vignettes that offer individual glimpses into a ten
sion-filled humanity.
The sources of thematic tensions are clear. There was a
gender divide between companies, one of women, one of
men. There was also a cultural divide. As Acogny described,
"It was important for me to work with African-Americans.
We are black, but we are not the same culture. "We have our
style and they have their style .. . everybody kept his or her
personality."
Yet, with the mark of all great art, the divisions within
"Scales" were also ambiguous. Chasms bridged as much as
they partitioned. The differences in gender were momentarily
negated in moments of sensual flirtation, close dancing and
body contact. Even as male dancers lifted women into the air
and, at moments, vice versa, the athleticism of the art could
not belie the intimacy.
Although the dancers came from very different cultural
backgrounds, the African-American women danced tradi
tional West-African styles as capably as the African men

danccd the less-traditional styles. The melange of personali
ties, even as personalities were distinct, implied the possibility
of coexistence, a coexistence perhaps more vibrant, being
more heterogeneous.
"Scales" also revealed a universality of human interac
tion. A particular segment of the performance stood out for
me. Imagine this: A man and a woman stand next to each
other, in silence, shyly awkward, before suddenly bursting
into a synchronized dance. There is no music, only the sound
of their tapping feet, the occasional yelp. The movement
fades, stops. Everything retreats to awkwardness. There is a
lull, and suddenly the dance begins again, and again and
again. "One time! Two time!" the man shouts, and each time,
the man and woman get a little closer, a little more familiar, a
little more comfortable. So much of the movement reflected
the clumsy process of meeting a stranger, and the transfor
mation of a stranger into a friend.
The tautness of dancing bodies, the clash of costume
colours and the jarring cut of music into silence put the per
formance constantly on an edge. These subtle strains, com
bined with excellent lighting, choreography and technical and
expressive skills, made for a near-perfect spectacle.
