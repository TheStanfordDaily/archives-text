# There should be time no longer...

There is something very interesting
going on in the title of Olivier
Messiaen's "Quartet for the End
of Time" ("Quatuor pour la fin du
temps"), a Lively Arts event performed
Thursday night. Is the piece's sense of
time literally stopping, as if the "Book of
Revelations" that inspired Messiaen
brought about a state of suspended ani
mation (that "silence in heaven about
the space of half an hour"), or does the
quartet reach for a sort of interminable
quality, an endlessness? Is it instead all a
pun — a puckish sounding of the death
knell for typical Western rhythm in the
vein of Brubeck's "Time Out?" And how
do we work in the peculiar finale — the
keening note of the violin dying out
unaccompanied?
It's been a hundred years since the
birth of Messiaen, and Stanford has
been pulling out all the stops to cele
brate the centenary of this enormously
influential but often publicly underap
preciated composer. Lectures on
Messiaen's compositional techniques,
piano recitals and an electronic event
called "Messiaen Remixed" have all been
lined up, but undoubtedly the center
piece of the event is this performance of

the celebrated quartet, along with select
ed organ works, in Memorial Church.
One of the few acknowledged clas
sics of 20th-century chamber music, the
"Quartet for the End of Time" was first
performed, and largely written, in a
World War II German camp where the
composer had been taken prisoner. The
music, however, is anything but con
tained — expansive and deeply religious,
both harmonically challenging and gen
uinely moving.
It is this unusually listenable combi
nation of characteristics that came
across so well in the performance, due
not only to the efforts of the performers,
but to the venue. Memorial Church is
both a gorgeous visual presence, shining
in its gold leaf over the increasingly
ecstatic music-making of the group, and
a remarkable acoustic space. The piano
sounds like bells, the clarinet like trum
pets and when they slowly build into the
liquid birdsong of the "Abime des
oiseaux," something in the delay of the
reverberation combines with the subtle
ty of the playing to remove any direct
association of the musicians' movements
with the sound that emerges, as if the
walls themselves were seeping music.

This is not, of course, to take any
credit away from the performers, who
were astounding to watch as an ensem
ble. The quartet played complex music,
giving each player his own independent
series of patterns that interact but rarely
seem to match up exactly with the oth
ers, like crystal spheres epicycled in a
Ptolemaic universe. Every one of these
performers did a tremendous job bring
ing lyricism to atonality. The always
remarkable Christopher Costanza, for
instance, playing over the shifting pulse
of Jamie Parker's piano in "Louange a
I'fiternite de Jesus," managed to slowly,
imperceptibly transition from a melodic
haunting vibrato into an almost insect
sound as the piece spinned briefly into
chaos, and then back again to that
unbalanced tranquility that ran
throughout the quartet. And Scott St.
John, rocking back and forth wildly,
brought a very real enthusiasm to the
rowdy, dance-like "Intermede."
Still, the key to understanding the
Quartet was really to be found in the
organ music that Robert Huw Morgan
played during the second half of the


COURTESY EDITIONS DURAND
concert. Often seeming static, it hypnotically held on unusual block chords, much like the halting sway of the
Quartet's opening notes. But there was motion in that stillness, subtle cycles that Messiaen hid in the middle of
the wall of sound. That is, it seems, where the Quartet means to stand on the issue of time — stopping and never
ending, simultaneously. The way the Book of Revelations sees the end of history, but not of motion, saying "and
swear by him that liveth for ever and ever ... that there should be time no longer." The violin will just quiver out
of our hearing when it's time to leave.
