# FiNE ART REVIEW
## "Durer to Picasso" kicks off art season 
### 
cc ollecting" has been a potent buzzword in many
I museum exhibitions this year. At the Met, an
exhibition honoring its longtime curator called
"The Phillippe de Montebello Years" is a hodgepodge of art
objects acquired under his leadership, ranging from dynastic
Egypt to the Italian Renaissance to Van Gogh. On the oppo
site coast, at LACMA, an exhibition called "Hearst: the
Collector" is just as eclectic as a Met show. Now, Stanford also
has its own show about collecting, and it too offers us a veri
table timeline of Western art history from the Renaissance
through World War 11.
Positioned as the first of three major shows highlighting
Cantor's reopening in 1999, the exhibition "Durer to Picasso,"
which opened here Wednesday, features the most prominent
works that have been collected by the museum in the past 10
years.
In a creative move, Cantor invited outside voices to help
the curators write the wall labels. Professors of art history
and history, along with students, artists, collectors and
donors contributed to the didactic experience of the exhibi
tion. Although sometimes the historical information about

the work of art is sacrificed, this experiment
brings an egalitarian and fresh perspective to
museum-going.
Because the curators have also signed their
names at the bottom of the labels they write, we
get to know these voices personally throughout
our experience. Each curatorial voice is distinct
and offers a unique perspective. For example,
when the Curator for Education Patience Young
writes a comment, she provokes research ques
tions and encourages future use of the collec
tions. About a Diego Rivera drawing, she writes
"Yet to be determined is how this drawing cor
responds to other works by Rivera — a question
that awaits attention by an enterprising scholar."
The first object to greet visitors — and one
of the exhibition's most surprising inclusions —
is Thomas Eakins' "Portrait of Professor
William D. Marks," (1886) a promised gift to
the museum. This larger-than-life oil sketch
shows the professor in a contemplative and

somber mood as he sits alone at a table. Eakins'
skill in conveying emotion through facial movement is unri
valed, and in this picture, his focus is almost entirely on the
mechanics of the professor's face — the way his brow furrows
and how his stare into space reveals a contemplative interior.
Once inside the Figott Family Gallery, one is greeted by
the neo-classical picture "Zeuxis Choosing his Models"
(1791) by Francois-Andre Vincent. The picture is remarkable
for its detailed precision and bright colors, as well as the dra-

matic gestures of its figures. Nearby is the set of 16 Diirer
engravings of Christ's Passion and several engravings after
Pieter Bruegel the Elder documenting his travels through
Italy.
Throughout, the general focus of the comments remains
on the idea of collecting, and appropriately so. Museum
Director Tom Seligmann's comment about the acquisition of
Picasso's "Courtesan with Hat" (1901) is a personal story:
The picture was donated by his own aunt. About a late-19th
century work "The Treachery of Delilah" by the little-known
artist Enrico Scurr, the curator Bernard Barryte writes that
"Every so often one sees a unique object that is simply a won
derful example of artistic invention. Scuri's elaborate and

extraordinary sheet had this sort of impact on me."
While these types of choices enliven and enrich the exhi
bition, other choices are predictable and leave the exhibition
flat. Why, for example, have the curators adhered to a
chronology? The front of the gallery is devoted to earlier
works of art, like Renaissance prints, and toward the exit are
more modern works like the Picasso and a lean Arp metallic
sculpture. Within the gallery, small exhibition spaces have
been created where art is grouped together based on its his
torical or stylistic affinities, so art nouveau prints, for exam
ple, are grouped together near other ftn-de-siecle prints and
near a Louis Comfort Tiffany vase.
The curators have missed an opportunity to let these
works speak to each other in unpredictable ways, which
should be the point of an exhibition about collecting. Why
not let objects from different historical moments speak to
one another? The Picasso painting next to a Durer print
would surely be an odd juxtaposition, but would it not
inspire interest, comments, laughs and thoughts?
