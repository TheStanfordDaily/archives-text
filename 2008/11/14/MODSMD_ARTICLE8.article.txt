# Cantor celebrates its collections for 10th anniversary
## 
### 
The theme for this year's exhibits and programs at
Cantor Arts Center is a "Passion for Collecting."
Cantor is celebrating its 10th anniversary since
reopening in 1999 after the devastation of the 1989 Loma
Prieta earthquake.
For this celebration, the curators at the museum want
the 2008-2009 season to draw attention to the diverse range
of works on exhibit and the unique paths that have brought
them there. The season is composed of seven shows; four of
the exhibits use only works form the permanent collection
and focus on the major works the museum has acquired in
the last decade. Kicking the season off is "Durer to Picasso,"
which opened Tuesday.
One of the major works featured in the exhibit is a
painting by Francois-Andre Vincent entitled "Zeuxis
Choosing his Models for the Image of Helen from Among
the Girls of Croton" (1791). This work was a gift from the
Robert and Ruth Halperin Foundation.

"It displays an artist with his models in the process of
painting," said Betsy Fryberger, Cantor's Burton.and Dee Dee
McMurtry curator of prints and drawings. She explained
that the museum curators were especially excited about this
piece because of its composition.
Works are often acquired by the museum as gifts or
bequests. At times, alumni will donate a large part of their
personal art collection to Cantor Arts Center at the time of
their death.
"Each work is initially proposed by a curator who is
excited about the work's aesthetic strength, historic signifi
cance, rarity or other exceptional quality — or usually a
combination of factors," said Cantor's Curator for
Education Patience Young in a press release. "These reasons
correspond to the museum's current and potential role in
university life and scholarship."
Fryberger elaborated by noting that the works in the
permanent collection display "how the Center's curators

seek quality, relevance to the overall context of the collec
tions and teaching opportunities."
The items being collected by the museum have evolved
from the original worldly artifacts that lane Stanford com
piled to educate her son. There is now a focus on collecting
pieces that are significant works of art, including antique
engravings from the masters like Albrecht Dtlrer and paint
ings from contemporary abstract expressionists like Richard
Diebenkorn.
Regardless of style, however, the meaning behind each
piece continues the legacy of Jane Stanford's original inten
tions — to document the history of art, as it educates and
excites the varied audiences that come to Cantor Arts
Center.
