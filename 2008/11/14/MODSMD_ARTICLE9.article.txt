# behind the scenes of GAiETiES
## How the silliest bunch of students puts together a full-fledged musical production 
### 
If you were to accidentally wander into a
Gaieties rehearsal in Manzanita dining,
you might not even realize that it was
anything unusual.
Dressed in street clothes and hanging
around tables in groups, laughing, the cast of
this year's Gaieties looks like any other group
of students. But as soon as they start warm
ing up, it's pretty clear that the cast of
Gaieties is anything but normal.
They begin by singing "Seasons of Love"
around the piano, and then it quickly
devolves. Their warm-ups involve singing
phrases such as "I love Obama," "fondle me"
and"I can't sing, but I'll fuck your mom."
And they wrap it up with a version of "Doe a
Deer" that is about beer and starts something
like "Dough, the stuff I buy beer with. Ray,
the guy I buy beer from. Me, the one I buy
beer for. Far, a long way to the store."
And the debauchery just continues.
While the rehearsal by its nature is entertain
ing and inappropriate, the cast keeps this up
during off moments, constantly cracking
inappropriate jokes in relation to lines from
the script.
A longstanding tradition
Gaieties, a Stanford tradition going back to
1911, is here again in full hilarity with this
year's show, "Dazed and Calfused." One of
the biggest productions put on by Ram's
Head, Gaieties is a comedic musical celebrat
ing the Stanford-Cal rivalry every year dur
ing Big Game Week.
While this student-written, student
directed play has earned its reputation as

being over-the-top, sexually inappropriate
and politically incorrect, it is also a genuine
dramatic production, and requires months of
work to produce â€” and not just from the
cast members, but also from the dozens of
backstage technical staff.
"1 think this show is the first time, to
me, that Gaieties has felt like a legitimate
show," said Director Nick DeWilde '10. "My
big thing this year is that there is something
at stake. I think Gaieties is about more than
just pumping you up for Big Game. It's about
reminding you what a phenomenal school
you go to."
DeWilde, who is directing this year after
two years on cast, has been working hard to
promote his vision of what Gaieties should
be.
"What art is, is being able to take a com
munity and show it to itself," he said. "You
take Stanford and you show it to itself. And
you show it farcically, but if you don't have
truth in there, then you're not doing it jus
tice. And this year there is a lot of truth."
In general, all of the cast and staff
involved feel that this year's show is particu
larly special, and that the production has
evolved over the past few years.
Taylor Ray '10, a three-year veteran cast
member, and a member of this year's writing
team, feels that the plot and cast for 2008 are
truly phenomenal.
"I think that this is probably the best
script that I've seen Gaieties have," Ray said.
"And it is by far one of the most talented
casts. Plus, the people arc just really crazy
and fun, which makes it better."

Jason Richman '09, the current head of
Ram's Head and the producer of Gaieties in
2006, feels that show has evolved over the
years.
"1 think you've really seen a progression
in the show quality as a whole," Richman
said. "The talent is better. 1 think Gaieties was
written off a lot as being just about sex. It's
become a lot more about the music, the
comedy, the comedic timing of the actors."
Production begins
This year in particular, Gaieties has even
more to offer. But it hasn't been easy.
"I think the script is fantastic," Richman
said. "I think it's irreverent, 1 think it's very
witty and I think the plot is fantastic, which
adds to the overall appeal."
Of course, the script didn't happen
overnight. Head writer Brett Hammond '08
began writing the script last spring, along
with a team of writing staff. Often meeting in
the Casa Italiana lounge, the writers began by
simply throwing out funny ideas, and then
sifting through the material to craft the show.
"Brett was our head writer," Ray said.
"But everyone sort of shared the task of writ
ing the scenes and stuff."
With a draft in hand, the writers enlisted
Charlton Gholson '08, Hammond's room
mate, to compose the music for the play.
"They do the script first, without the
songs," Gholson said. "Then they come to me
and they say we want this kind of song, or we
want this to happen in a song, things like
that, general guidelines. I give them my ini
tial thoughts and write up the lyrics first. If

they don't like them, they send it back, and
we keep working."
This process of revising the script and
score takes months, and isn't actually fin
ished until right before the show is cast.
"The composing went on for most of the
summer, and I've been finishing it all the last
couple months," Gholson said.
"It's been about six months that we've
been working on this play," Ray said. "There
was a lot of revision going on this summer,
we had to make it tighter, shorter. It wasn't
finalized and printed until right before we
had our read-through with the cast."
Making it their own
But the script is never completely set in
stone. Cast members are encouraged to play
with the characters and their lines. And one
of the famous Gaieties traditions, the crosses,
are not scripted at all.
"The crosses are a Gaieties tradition
where people who aren't in the scene just
randomly cross and do something distract
ing," explained sophomore cast member
Phillip Bowen.
Cast members arc given free reign to
make up crosses in the appropriate scenes,
and the best are run. Crosses arc known for
being notoriously ridiculous and witty.
"I think that a lot of the things going on
in the background arc the funniest things,"
Rich man said.
Because the cast is able to participate in
reworking parts of the script, every night's
show tends to be a little different, and the
closing night is usually wilder, with more
