## Farmer discusses role of students, universities with The Daily 
### KAMIL DADA DESK EDITOR 
Before his talk at Kresge Auditorium on
Friday, Dr. Paul Farmer, co-founder of
Partners in Health (PIH), spoke with Hie
Daily's Kamil Dada Ml about his work in
treatable, infectious diseases and the role stu
dents can play while still in college. Farmer is
a professor of medical anthropology at
Harvard.
The Stanford Daily (SD): What role
should large research universities such as
Stanford play in the infectious disease arena?
Paul Farmer (PF): One of the things I
would say is. universities like this one have
resources that no other institution has. So we
shouldn't just try and do what development
institutions or the international standard-set

ting bodies do. Why should Stanford end up
looking just like the USA ID? Why should
Stanford try to do what the WHO does, or the
Pan-American Health Organization? One
thing we should be doing is not the same thing
other institutions are doing. If the university is
well resourced like Stanford, then they —
Stanford — should put skin in the game.
Harvard should put skin in the game.
By that I mean, investing resources instead
of competing for resources. Unfortunately, a
lot of universities are competing for resources.
But they already have resources. Let me give
you an example. If I am at a big teaching hos
pital in Boston, and we're trying to make a
contribution to global health. I think that the
hospital can make a contribution through
money, faculty, training, and pony up the
resources for it. I don't want to use too manv

colloquialisms,so forgive me. but I really think
that institutions like this have to get involved
with the poor world and epidemic disease in a
really new way. For example, wouldn't it be a
shame if all we did was teaching and
research? Can't we do something better than
that?
What do research universities do? They do
research and they teach. What do we need to
take on epidemic diseases like AIDS?
Certainly we need research and teaching, but
we also need services that people who are liv
ing in poverty can access easily.
SD: What role should college students plav
in helping prevent the spread of infectious dis
eases? What do you think of Dance
Marathon's efforts to raise money for
Partners in I lealth?
PF: When I first heard of this Dance

Marathon. I thought what on earth is this
DM? What is this idea? How could they pos
sibly raise money by dancing? And the
Stanford students told me — 'Oh we will raise
money, we will raise $150.(XH).' Sure enough,
the next morning, they raised $150,000. It's a
bit of a mystery to me how you raise money
by dancing, but they did it. We got to use that
money for people living in poverty and peo
ple who were -sick. So what do I think of
Dance Marathon? I think they're awesome.
College students are great at coming up with
new and innovative ways to raise money, and
I think they should carry on doing that.
SD: You were raised as part of a large fam
ily in a bus and then a boat. How did your
background affect who you are now? Was it
the catalyst for vour philanthropy work?
PF: I m not sure if it was the catalvst. Look

at all the students who don't have a back
ground at all like mine. 1 would actually not
underline the significance of my background,
myself. You can attribute certain actions to
certain motivations, but you can't really show
that they're related. ITiere are people at
Stanford who didn't live in a bus or a boat and
didn't come from a big family, but they're
doing the same work that I'm doing. So 1
think that's not the important part. Even
more important than the motivations is what
we can get done. Motivations change over
time.
SI): Is your program to help the poor in
Haiti realistic?
PF: It is realistic. We are doing it in one of the
poorest places on earth with individuals who
