## Editorial Digital, physical improvements to libraries go hand in hand 
### 
At a time when Stanford's top-notch
library collections are growing by
60.000 volumes a year and the
Google Books Library Project aspires to
digitize the entire collection within a
decade, the future of the Stanford Univer
sity Libraries and Academic Information
Resources may seem bright. But these
signs of progress belie problems with ac
cess and ease of use that are the center of a
new Committee on L.ibraries report that
was recently adopted unanimously bv the
Faculty Senate. The report paints a picture
of a rapidly changing library system that
may be headed in the wrong direction.
The report warns that coming changes
to the library system — the demolition of
Meyer Library, increased emphasis on re
mote library storage and digital access,
emerging dependence on the Google
Books Library Project — represent a sig
nificant step backward for the University.
Many faculty members are worried that
the physical library, with its innumerable
stacks of books, easy browsing and inter
personal experience, is being phased out in
favor of digital databases and streamlined
Internet searching.This library evolution is
happening so quickly that many academic
researchers have not had time to adjust —
or time to speak out against this march of
progress.The library is not merely a "ware
house" of books, as the Provost is quoted as
saying in the report, and deserves a central,
physical place on campus.
The problem at the heart of the matter is
the General Use Permit, an agreement be
tween Santa Clara County and Stanford
University that limits the amount of build
ing square-footage that can exist on Stan
ford-owned land. With plans to demolish
Meyer Library in the near future, the Uni
versity will cither have to ship even more
books to the library's off-campus storage
auxiliary at Livermore. or sacrifice other
construction priorities — housing, work
spaces and laboratories — that cannot ef
fectively be moved off-site. The Committee
on Libraries established a subcommittee
on Digital Information Technology to eval
uate this change and make policy recom
mendations for the University.
The subcommittee, after canvassing de
partment heads for their input and per
spectives on the matter, came to a few im
portant conclusions that are shared by the
editorial board. The report asserts that the
very process of looking up books in an ac
tual library, with books on closely-related
subjects in hand's reach and knowledge
able librarians on site to help with ques
tions. contributes to intellectual research
and discovery — and is completely lost in
the current online-search paradigm. It also
points out that the library building serves
as important additional workspace for
many professors and faculty members
forced into tiny offices. Finally, the subcom
mittee acknowledged that space is limited
on campus and any modern research li
brary must make use of off-site storage.
But in this case, the system must ensure a

highly effective electronic search system
that is easy to use, all-encompassing and
error-free.
Hie subcommittee advocates the con
struction of a new, underground extension
to Green Library that could house nearly
the entire library collection, paving the way
for the demolition of Meyer and the auxil
iary libraries on campus. Its members also
propose reinventing some of the Green Li
brary space to provide research modules to
faculty and students working on projects.
Scholars could be assigned a small space in
Green for the duration of a project, a
space-sharing arrangement reminiscent of
the successful model used at Stanford's sci
entific research laboratories.
This ambitious proposal would require
a change to the General Use Permit (which
is up for renegotiation in 2010) and a new
found financial commitment to humanities
and social science research on the part of
the University. We support this proposal
wholeheartedly as a renewal of Stanford's
commitment to research excellence and a
necessary assist for Stanford's elite corps of
academic researchers.
Regardless of whether a new library ex
tension is ever built, scholars at Stanford
will have to deal with electronic search and
retrieval from off-site facilities. These is
sues were a central focus of the subcommit
tee, which rightly concludes that Socrates is
badly in need of both a cosmetic facelift
and a technical tune-up. The subcommit
tee's report recommends a greater empha
sis on cataloguing off-site materials —
after all. once the books have been shipped
away to Livermore.the collection is only as
valuable as it is accessible.
The report recommends complete scan
ning of the title page, table of contents and
index of every book at an auxiliary library,
and making this available on the revamped
Socrates.The subcommittee also makes the
good point that the least-used books are
not necessarily the best candidates for
shipment to off-campus storage, as the li
brary's official policies would suggest. In
stead, periodicals. which are often searched
for a specific article in a specific issue, seem
easiest to access from afar and should be
prioritized for shipment to Livermore. Fi
nally.the non-Roman text sources, includ
ing the vast majority of the Hast Asian li
brary. are essentially impossible to search
with Socrates because of its inability to
handle Korean. Chinese or Japanese-lan
guage materials. Given this fact, it is unac
ceptable for any of these materials to be
shipped off-site and the report is clear on
this issue.
In the words of Stanford's first presi
dent, David Starr Jordan, and as quoted in
the subcommittee's report: "the library is
the heart of the university ... a great li
brary is the most important element in the
formation of a great university." We hope
that the administration will take Jordan's
words to heart when considering the valu
able recommendations of the committee's
report.
