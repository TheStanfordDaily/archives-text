## Allysia Finley Government needs lesson in fiscal responsibility 
### 
Before becoming a civil servant, one
should have to pass a fiscal responsi
bility exam. Let's call it the FRE. My
guess is that most of our politicians would
fail.
Despite the federal government's $455
billion deficit (it is expected to reach over a
trillion in 2009), Obama supported a $ 1 ()-bil
lion expansion of a pre-K education pro
gram, a $ 150-billion renewable energy "in
vestment" and a government healthcare plan
that the non-partisan Tax Policy Center esti
mates will cost $1 trillion over the next 10
years. All in all. Obama's policy plans would
add another $3.6 trillion to the deficit by
2018. according to the Tax Policy Center.
But to be fair and honest, it's not just
Obama. Bush has topped the list of presi
dents on almost all kinds of spending, includ
ing regulatory spending. According to
Richard Viguerie, a principal architect of the
Reagan Revolution, the federal government
budget increased by 33 percent during
Bush's first five years in office. Discretionary
spending grew at a faster rate than under
Lyndon B. Johnson, and pork-barrel ear
marks skyrocketed by 121 percent.
Lately, the Capitol has become the fi

nance sector's ATM. as ravenous lobbyists
from banks, savings and loans associations
and insurers line up for their piece of the pie.
When they blow through their billions,they'll
just come back for more, like AIG. After al
ready giving the Big Three American au
tomakers a $25-billion loan, Democrats are
pushing for a $50-billion stimulus for these
same companies. There's no accountability.
But since the feds seem quite willing to
bail out almost anyone and everyone, why
don't they bail out California? After all. Cal
ifornia desperately needs it. The state right
now is running a $27.8 billion deficit. Despite
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's promises to
exercise fiscal discipline, he's succumbed to
the Democratic legislature on most spending
measures and has become a typical, tax-bor
row-and-spend liberal. When times were
flush. California made huge financial con
tracts and outlays, and now when times aren't
flush, the state wants to continue spending as
if it is still reeling in the money.
On the last ballot, Schwarzenegger sup
ported the $19.4-billion high-speed railway,
the $2-billion children's hospital bond and
the $1.8-billion veterans' bond. All of these,
of course, were worthy causes, but so are

many other things. Increased grant money
for disadvantaged students and funds for
cancer research are also worthy causes. But
taxpayers cannot afford to subsidize every
worthy cause â€” much less to subsidize un
worthy. incompetent, bankrupt businesses
like the Big Three automakers. Where is all
the money going to come from?
Taxes? Schwarzenegger has proposed a
1.5-percent increase in sales tax and the ex
tension of the sales tax to services. Rather
than wrangle with unions and cut state em
ployee benefits (which are better than almost
anywhere in the private sector), he'd rather
distribute the costs of the state's fiscal irre
sponsibility over the entire population.
Obama.on the other hand, would rather con
centrate the costs of the federal govern
ment's irresponsibility on the wealthy.
Under Obama's tax plan, 4X percent of
people will not pay any income tax and many
of these people will even receive a check
from the government. Those who earn more
than $250,000 will see their tax burden in
crease by 1 1 percent,even though the top one
percent already pay 40 percent of the na
tion's income taxes while earning 21 percent
of the nation's income, according to the Tax
Foundation.
But if Obama taxes the rich too much,
they are going to leave. Iliis is in essence
what has happened to California, as the
state's steep business taxes and highly pro
gressive income tax have caused many
wealthy people and businesses to move out
of the state or shelter their money. And now,
during the economic downturn, the state is
facing an even bigger shortfall since income
and business taxes are lower than expected.
That's the problem with relying so heavily on
the wealthy for revenue. When their pocket
books suffer, so does our government's
purse. Under Obama's plan, the financial fate
ot the wealthy and that of the nation will just
become even more entwined.
Gov. Schwarzenegger, President Bush
and President-elect Obama need to start ex
ercising their veto power and requiring that
legislatures spend within their means, with
out expanding their means. If people and
most businesses (except for those pleading
for bailouts) have to do it, so should the gov
ernment.
