# Steal This Column
## Cal sucks, so what's wrong with saying so? 
### 
Something has been
irrevocably lost with
the slogan change.

So we didn't heat USC. I have already
moved on.That loss is in the past. Let us
turn our faces forward to a more press
ing matter:
We really hurt Cal's feelings.
Last week, our very own Stanford Daily
broke the news that made my ears steam,
eyes bulge and gast flabber. Our beloved Cal
Sucks shirts (which hold a very dear place in
Steal This Column's heart), the shirts that
willed 11 men on the field and one coach
Footbaugh on the sidelines to victory in last
year's Big Game, are no more. The phrase
"Cal Sucks," however truthful it may be. has
been deemed too offensive, so production of
Big Game shirts with that slogan has been
discontinued.
In a valiant display of total disregard for
prioritizing and tackling any real issues, the
University of California, Berkeley, has
sprung into action, fought the good fight and
won the ultimate moral victory. Iliey took
away our right to use a word on a shirt. Boy,
must they be patting each other on the butt
right now.
In their reluctant acceptance of the deci
sion. the Stanford Store has had to come up
with a new catch phrase. And the winner is..
. ' Beat Cal?"
Beat Cal? Really? I lave we truly been re
duced to expressing our feelings toward our
biggest rival in the form of a suggestion?
I know, I know.The shirts this year are sell
ing like proverbial hotcakes. Early reports

suggested 12(H) preorders.with the final num
ber expected to be closer to 2000. They are
indeed more accessible to a wider audience.
But something has been irrevocably lost
with the slogan change. What's missing is the
humor. The clever insults. Hie witty under
handedness. In the process, we have been

stripped of that which made those shirts
great in the first place.
The messages on the back have been
toned down, too. What happened to idea that
we have the right — nay, the responsibility
— to make fun of our rival? What happened
to the spirit that could have made possible
shirts like."Stay tuned for the halftime show
in which the Cal Marching Band makes sac
rifices to their demon-lord and the players
bathe in their own feces"? (This, in all truth,
was considered for an early Cal Sucks design
back before the Stanford Store acquired the
rights.) That spirit is gone, friends. It has
ceased to be.
The offended parties claim that the phrase
"Cal Sucks" is not in the spirit of a sports
manlike rivalry, and thus had to be changed.
I admit. Cal Sucks shirts were not for every
one. Some of the designs toed the line of
good taste. But the entire mentality behind
the merchandise was done with the tongue
placed firmly against the cheek — even the
catch phrase itself. I know that Cal is a decent
school, even if I would never write that out
loud.
The point is: The shirts were funny. II any
thing, they added to the rivalry; they made it
between schools, not between the sidelines.
Those shirts helped get us fans fired up. We
are not only smarter than you, they said, hut
we're more clever, too. (And. if you believe
the shirts, less gassy.)
I agree that sportsmanship is a key ele

ment of having a rivalry, hut come on. We are
not live years old.To nitpick over such an in
nocuous word is absurd. In their complaint,
Cal has tried to remove something from this
rivalry. I think the something is a term called
"fun.'' I hope that word is not the next one to
be deemed too racy to use. But from the way
things are going, it sounds like it could.
I do not blame the Stanford Store for this
change; I know the people who run the store,
and they do a great job.They played the hand
that was dealt to them, and they've frankly
done quite well with it. as their sales have
shown.
I blame whoever decided that having a lit
tle harmless fun at Cal's expense is a problem
that must be immediately tackled, lest the
Golden Bears get a case of the blues as a re
sult.
In the end. of course, theT-shirt design will
matter much less than the outcome of this
Saturday's game at Cal. which I hope we will
all attend. Cal can take the shirts off our
backs, but they will never take ... our Axe.
Yet even with those shirts gone, the legacy
of Cal Sucks shirts will last as long as Lance
Armstrong has one more testicle than Cal:
forever.
Which, coincidentally, is exactly as long as
( a I will suck.
