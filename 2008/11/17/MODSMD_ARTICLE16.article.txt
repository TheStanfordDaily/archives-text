### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN 
Kresge Auditorium was more Pune
than Palo Alto on Saturday, as it played
host to a few hours of Indian culture,
complete with food, South Asian a cap
pella and stand-up comedy.
Asha Stanford, a student-run chapter
of the non-profit charity organization
Asha tor Education, put on a benefit con
cert called "V" 2(K)S, with all proceeds
going towards improving basic education
in India.
This is the second year the concert has
been held, and it featured a new line-up
ot performers. Ihe event began with
songs from the singing group Dhwani,
which performed last year, as did the
third group of the night. Raagapella,
Stanford's all-male, South-Asian a cap
pell a group.
"It's for a good cause," said Dhwani
soloist Shohini Banerjee, a second-year
master's student. "It's always a pleasure
to perform for Asha Stanford."
Also performing was popular stand
up comedian Samson Koletkar. Ihe con
cert program referred to him as "the
world's only known Indian Jewish stand
up comedian," and"The Indian
Seinfeld." The night concluded with
songs from VidvA. a popular new group
that fuses jazz with classical Indian music.
"This time, it's a different flavor," said
Vikram Sivakumar '08. one of last year's
Asha Stanford publicity coordinators.
"We're so happy to have all the groups
here."
The name of the concert. "V," is a cre
ative title that can represent many differ
ent things. Hie audience was given the
option of being involved in helping
choose the fluctuating meaning of "V"
for next year, with a contest running dur
ing the show to come up with a slogan for

"V" 2009.
"The word 'V' came from the word
variety," said Treasurer Varun Mittal, a
third-year Ph.D. student. "It's going to be
slightly different even,' year and we didn't
want to come up with something specific.
Last year, we had slightly different dance
groups and fewer musical groups."
I"he concert, which cost eight dollars
for students and $ 12 for non-students, also
featured Indian food from Athidhi Indian
Cuisine in Sunnyvale. Furthermore, pho
tographs by Indian artists were silently
auctioned off throughout the concert, giv
ing audience members multiple methods
of donating to Asha.
Asha for Education was founded in
1991 at UC-Berkeley, with the Asha
Stanford chapter established soon after
in 1992. Hie organization has since
spread to over 66 chapters across the
United States and has even created inter
national ties.
"The good thing about Asha Stanford
is that all the net proceeds go to charities
in India," Mittal said. "Many people can
relate to that."
Asha for Education's main goal is to
support grassroots education projects in
India. Asha Stanford currently funds 14
diverse projects, almost all of which have
the overall focus of supporting primary
education. Last year. Asha Stanford con
tributed almost $75,000 to its projects,
and as an organization. Asha for
Education donated over $4 million.
"We decide the projects," Mittal said.

"We get project proposals from India and
as a group decide which projects to fund.
After that, we monitor the projects and
make sure the money is being used prop
erly."
Asha Stanford puts on several
fundraising events each year, the most
popular of which celebrates the spring
holiday Holi, also known as the "Festival
of Colors." Thousands of people are
drawn to Stanford's Sand Hill Field from
across the nation, and the event typically
raises tens of thousands of dollars.
"It's going to take at least two to three
years, but I'm pretty sure it's going to get
there" SiVakumar said of the popularity
of "V" compared to the Holi festival.
Even though the audience was slight
ly diminished due to the Stanford-USC
football game, as well as the performance
of HMS Pinafore, those who attended
did enjoy the show.
"I've heard these groups before." said
audience member and second-year grad
uate student Aditya Mittal. "Overall, it's
good; the comedian was funny."
Varun Mittal estimated that half of
the audience was composed of students,
while the other half consisted of people
from across the Bay Area.
"Many Indian undergrads and grads
want to help give back to and connect to
their country." he said, "and at the same
time enjoy great music and food, too."
