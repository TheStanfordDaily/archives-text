## Yunus pushes microcredit 
### KAMIL DADA DESK EDITOR 
Nobel Peace Pri/e winner Muhammad Yunus
called for greater studenl involvement in public
service, increased microcredit programs and a
paradigm shift in business practices in a wide
ranging hour-long talk at Cubberley Auditorium
Friday afternoon.
Yunus. who was described as "one of the
world's greatest human beings" by George
Shult/.the former U.S. Secretary of State and dis
tinguished fellow at the Hoover Institution,
asked students to think independently and break
away from tradition.
In 1976. Yunus founded the Grameen Bank in
Bangladesh based on the premise that giving
loans and extending credit to poor people would
help them out of poverty. Grameen now oper
ates in 38 countries and provides collateral-free
loans to more than 7.5 million borrowers in
Bangladesh alone. Yunus and the bank were
jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2(XXS.
The 68-year-old champion of microcredit out
lined the development of Grameen by saying
that he began by approaching the traditional
banking system with a mindset that was in com
plete contrast to established banks.
"Conventional banks try to reach out to the
richest; we try to reach out to the poorest." he
said. "Conventional banks mostly try to reach to
men. We deliberately reached out to women, and
the poorest women. Conventional banks are all

about rich people. We made sure this bank was
owned by poor women. Conventional banks
require collateral. We dismissed collateral right
from day one."
In an emotional plea to the audience. Yunus
said that as citizens of the world, everyone has to
break down the barriers that stunt the growth of
poor individuals.
"Human beings are packed with unlimited
capacity, unlimited potential." he said."Poor peo
ple are as good of human beings as anyone else.
Society simply never gave them the opportunity
to unlock the gifts that each one of them is carry
ing."
When The Daily asked Yunus about the role
of college students in social justice, he said that
developing a good model was crucial to success.
"The amazing thing about social business is.
once you can develop the prototype, you develop
the seed," he said. "Then you can multiply the
seed.lTiat s the challenge to young people who
are at a school like Stanford. Design social busi
nesses. because that's where the future lies."
He added that classroom and textbook expe
rience was very important, but he felt the college
environment left out vital practical skills.
"One skill that is very important in this work
is to live with the people that you want to help."
he said. "Know the real people. That's a missing
part of university campus. (You] are good at
logic, abstractions and reasoning, but vou don't

know what the problem is all about.
Be there and understand what the
problem is. what real intervention is
needed and what impact it will make.
Live with them, communicate with
them."
Yunus also described how
Grameen aimed to have as many
women involved as possible, particu
larly as conventional banks in
Bangladesh focused exclusively on
men.

"|lt was a] difficult task to con
vince women to borrow money,"
Yunus said. "[One woman.] She said
I don't know anything about money,
don't give me money.' We never gave
up because we realized that this was
not her voice. It was the voice of his
tory that created her. All the fears,
indifference and pressures that were
put on her. She was hiding behind all
those layers of fears."
He referred to poor people as
metaphorical bonsai trees and said
that people assumed that a defect in
the seed led to the plant's limited
growth, when in fact, it just needed
more space to grow.
"Poor people are bonsai people,"

he said. "There's nothing wrong with
the seeds. Simply, society has been so
stingy with giving them the space to
grow, so they remain stunted."
Touching upon the current eco
nomic crisis in the world and the
recent turmoil in the U.S. markets.
Yunus pointed out that there were
still many positives to be seen.
"'lTiis financial crisis gives us an
enormous opportunity to redesign
and rebuild the financial system." he
said. "Let's fix it now so that nobody
is rejected from the system."
Furthermore, Yunus rebuked tra
ditional businesses and financial
institutions, arguing that a complete
mindset transformation was needed

if social justice was going to be
achieved. He said that human beings
are divided into two parts, the selfish
part and selfless part. In his opinion,
they are both equally strong instincts,
but the selfless part has been sup
pressed by society.
"Economics took only the selfish
part and made a whole theory out of
it. left out the selfless part," he said.
"Today, business means business to
make money. There is no other mean
ing to business. Our textbooks, our
theories, tell us that profit maximiza
tion is the definition of business."
Yunus emphasized that there did
not have to be a division between
philanthropy and business. He said
Grameen aimed to create social busi
ness bv design, very specifically, in
order to achieve particular outcomes.
He cited the example of Grameen
partnering with Dannon, the multi
national yogurt company.
"We produce yogurt in
Bangladesh for a very specific rea
son: millions of children in
Bangladesh are malnourished," he
said. "So they become an attractive
target for all kinds of diseases as they
grow up. That became our social
call."
Yunus explained that Grameen-
Dannon produces cheap yogurt with
added micronutrients so that the
children can become healthier. The
yogurt is produced cheaply because

it does not need elaborate containers
or expensive marketing strategies.
"Once you take off the profit
making glasses and put on the social
business glasses, amazing things hap
pen." he said. "All of a sudden, you
see you can reduce the costs tremen
dously."
When David Abernethv. professor
of political science emeritus, asked
Yunus how to reform businesses to
have a larger social impact. Yunus
argued that the first step was recon
sidering what constituted social help.
"Charity money only has one
life." he said. "It goes out. does the
job and never comes back. But if you
convert it into a social business, it
becomes a very powerful business
because the money is recycled."
Having experienced some of the
difficulties relating to setting up new
social businesses first-hand, Yunus
reminded the audience that the first
step to success was the power of
imagination.
"We can create the world that we
want." Yunus said. "The world we
would like to create is a world where
there will not be a single person who
is poor. If we can imagine such a
world, we create it. If we don't imag
ine it.it will never happen. Let's all
imagine for a better world."
