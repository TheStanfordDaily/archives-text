## Yunus pushes microcredit 
### KAMIL DADA DESK EDITOR 
Nobel Peace Pri/e winner Muhammad Yunus
called for greater studenl involvement in public
service, increased microcredit programs and a
paradigm shift in business practices in a wide
ranging hour-long talk at Cubberley Auditorium
Friday afternoon.
Yunus. who was described as "one of the
world's greatest human beings" by George
Shult/.the former U.S. Secretary of State and dis
tinguished fellow at the Hoover Institution,
asked students to think independently and break
away from tradition.
In 1976. Yunus founded the Grameen Bank in
Bangladesh based on the premise that giving
loans and extending credit to poor people would
help them out of poverty. Grameen now oper
ates in 38 countries and provides collateral-free
loans to more than 7.5 million borrowers in
Bangladesh alone. Yunus and the bank were
jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2(XXS.
The 68-year-old champion of microcredit out
lined the development of Grameen by saying
that he began by approaching the traditional
banking system with a mindset that was in com
plete contrast to established banks.
"Conventional banks try to reach out to the
richest; we try to reach out to the poorest." he
said. "Conventional banks mostly try to reach to
men. We deliberately reached out to women, and
the poorest women. Conventional banks are all

about rich people. We made sure this bank was
owned by poor women. Conventional banks
require collateral. We dismissed collateral right
from day one."
In an emotional plea to the audience. Yunus
said that as citizens of the world, everyone has to
break down the barriers that stunt the growth of
poor individuals.
"Human beings are packed with unlimited
capacity, unlimited potential." he said."Poor peo
ple are as good of human beings as anyone else.
Society simply never gave them the opportunity
to unlock the gifts that each one of them is carry
ing."
When The Daily asked Yunus about the role
of college students in social justice, he said that
developing a good model was crucial to success.
"The amazing thing about social business is.
once you can develop the prototype, you develop
the seed," he said. "Then you can multiply the
seed.lTiat s the challenge to young people who
are at a school like Stanford. Design social busi
nesses. because that's where the future lies."
He added that classroom and textbook expe
rience was very important, but he felt the college
environment left out vital practical skills.
"One skill that is very important in this work
is to live with the people that you want to help."
he said. "Know the real people. That's a missing
part of university campus. (You] are good at
logic, abstractions and reasoning, but vou don't
