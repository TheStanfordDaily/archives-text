## CARD OPENS WITH SPLIT Stanford tops U-of-M, upset by Baylor 
### ERIK ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
After reaching the NCAA title game last season and steam
rolling through exhibition play, Stanford was named the favorite of
the media to win the 2008-2009 Pacific-10 Conference title on Thurs
day.Two games into the season, that still looks like the right pick, but
things might be a bit more interesting now that the Cardinal is with
out Candice Wiggins '08.
Playing without Wiggins (the 2008 WNBA Sixth Woman of the
Year) or injured junior J. J. Hones, the No. 2 Stanford Cardinal (1-1)
started the season with a split, defeating No. 14 Minnesota at home
and being upset by No. 17 Baylor in Texas.
Hoping to build momentum after the opening win against Min
nesota. Stanford boarded a plane to Waco, Tex. for a Sunday mati
nee against Baylor. The Cardinal downed the Bears at Maples last
season 87-63 behind a 35-point effort from Wiggins. This year the
story was drastically different, however, as Baylor (2-0) cruised to a
81-65 victory behind senior Rachel Allison's 25 points — 20 of
which came in the first half and included four three-pointers.
Stanford looked out of sync for much of the game and struggled

to find any sort of
rhythm,but still managed
to get through the first
half trailing by just one.
36-35. But the Bears
pulled away in the sec
ond and the Cardinal
couldn't find an answer,
going just 9-30 from the
floor over the final 20
minutes.
The Bears had five
players reach double dig
its in scoring, including
center Danielle Wilson,
who stifled the Cardinal
in the paint with six
blocks. Sophomore
guard Jeanette Pohlen
was the only Stanford
player to reach double
figures with 14. and Og
wumike — playing with
friends and family from
her nearby hometown of
Cypress in attendance —
fouled out in the first half
after posting eight points
and five rebounds.

GAME NOTES: Stanford is hoping to rebound
from an upset loss to No. 1 7 Baylor yesterday
in Texas. The Cardinal entered the opening
weekend ranked No. 2, but that number will
likely fall after the weekend split. New Mexico
plays one more game before meeting the
Card, hosting DePaul tonight.

'I"he disappointing result at Baylor shows this Cardinal team may
have to work even harder this season to replicate the success of last
year. But if the Minnesota game is any indication, this team has the
tenacity to win even without its best stuff.
Early on. it looked like the Cardinal would run away in the sea
son opener against Minnesota (1-1). hut instead had to fight its way
to an ugly 68-55 victory. Both teams struggled to score in a first half
that ended with Stanford on top just 27-17.
"It felt like a heavyweight fight out there," head coachTara Van-
Derveer said. "We missed a lot of easy shots and had to keep bat
tling. We were getting great shots and just not making them."
"It was a battle all over the court "junior Jayne Appel agreed.
" lliey were hitting us. and we were hitting them. I didn't think we
played our best game, but it felt good to be able to fight through it
and get the win."
Stanford shot just 36.4 percent and Minnesota just 19.2 percent
in the first half, but both teams came out of the break firing.
The two squads traded baskets early in the second until standout
Gopher junior Katie Ohm connected on a three-pointer to cut the
Cardinal lead to 33-26, three and a half minutes in. The Cardinal
would respond with a pair of free throws from Appel. and from there
it became a duel between Ohm and redshirt junior Rosalyn Gold-
Onwude. Both made several key baskets down the stretch, including
a pair of momentum-changing three-pointers apiece.
"Ros is just a gamer; she hit several big threes for us." Van-
Derveer said.
"[Stanford] made the key plays down the stretch." Minnesota
head coach Pam Borton agreed."[Gold-Onwude] made a couple of

big threes—1 thought she hit the big
shots and that's what great teams do."
The Gophers fought to the end, and
Stanford's lead in the second half never
grew larger than the 13-point spread at
the final buzzer.
"We did not schedule an easy first
game," Vandeveer said. "Minnesota is
a very experienced and a very well
coached team. I thought we learned a

lot about our team ... this was just our
first game and we have a lot of work to
do.This was a physical game, and that's
how it's going to be in the tourna
ment."
Ohm finished with a team high of 15
points for the Gophers. Sophomore
Kayla Pedersen finished with a double
double, recording 14 points and 12
rebounds. Appel scored 14 as well, and
freshman Nnemkadi Ogwumike fin
ished with 11.
Wiggins attended the game in street
clothes and sat courtside. The nearly
3JS(X) in attendance gave her a standing
ovation after she was shown on the

scoreboard during a first-half timeout.
"I am so optimistic about this
team." Pedersen said after the game. "I
think we have the potential to be even
better than last year."
Even with the loss at Baylor, her
words ring true. Stanford certainly
looks to have the potential, especially
with a fully healthy roster.
The Cardinal will next take to the
court on Thursday night as New
Mexico visits Maples Pavilion.Tip-off is
set for 7 p.m.

Hoping to build momentum after the opening win against Min
nesota. Stanford boarded a plane to Waco, Tex. for a Sunday mati
nee against Baylor. The Cardinal downed the Bears at Maples last
season 87-63 behind a 35-point effort from Wiggins. This year the
story was drastically different, however, as Baylor (2-0) cruised to a
81-65 victory behind senior Rachel Allison's 25 points — 20 of
which came in the first half and included four three-pointers.

GAME NOTES: Stanford is hoping to rebound
from an upset loss to No. 1 7 Baylor yesterday
in Texas. The Cardinal entered the opening
weekend ranked No. 2, but that number will
likely fall after the weekend split. New Mexico
plays one more game before meeting the
Card, hosting DePaul tonight.

'I"he disappointing result at Baylor shows this Cardinal team may
have to work even harder this season to replicate the success of last
year. But if the Minnesota game is any indication, this team has the
tenacity to win even without its best stuff.
Early on. it looked like the Cardinal would run away in the sea
son opener against Minnesota (1-1). hut instead had to fight its way
to an ugly 68-55 victory. Both teams struggled to score in a first half
that ended with Stanford on top just 27-17.
"It felt like a heavyweight fight out there," head coachTara Van-
Derveer said. "We missed a lot of easy shots and had to keep bat
tling. We were getting great shots and just not making them."
"It was a battle all over the court "junior Jayne Appel agreed.
" lliey were hitting us. and we were hitting them. I didn't think we
played our best game, but it felt good to be able to fight through it
and get the win."
Stanford shot just 36.4 percent and Minnesota just 19.2 percent
in the first half, but both teams came out of the break firing.
The two squads traded baskets early in the second until standout
Gopher junior Katie Ohm connected on a three-pointer to cut the
Cardinal lead to 33-26, three and a half minutes in. The Cardinal
would respond with a pair of free throws from Appel. and from there
it became a duel between Ohm and redshirt junior Rosalyn Gold-
Onwude. Both made several key baskets down the stretch, including
a pair of momentum-changing three-pointers apiece.
"Ros is just a gamer; she hit several big threes for us." Van-
Derveer said.
"[Stanford] made the key plays down the stretch." Minnesota
head coach Pam Borton agreed."[Gold-Onwude] made a couple of

big threes—1 thought she hit the big
shots and that's what great teams do."
The Gophers fought to the end, and
Stanford's lead in the second half never
grew larger than the 13-point spread at
the final buzzer.
"We did not schedule an easy first
game," Vandeveer said. "Minnesota is
a very experienced and a very well
coached team. I thought we learned a

lot about our team ... this was just our
first game and we have a lot of work to
do.This was a physical game, and that's
how it's going to be in the tourna
ment."
Ohm finished with a team high of 15
points for the Gophers. Sophomore
Kayla Pedersen finished with a double
double, recording 14 points and 12
rebounds. Appel scored 14 as well, and
freshman Nnemkadi Ogwumike fin
ished with 11.
Wiggins attended the game in street
clothes and sat courtside. The nearly
3JS(X) in attendance gave her a standing
ovation after she was shown on the

scoreboard during a first-half timeout.
"I am so optimistic about this
team." Pedersen said after the game. "I
think we have the potential to be even
better than last year."
Even with the loss at Baylor, her
words ring true. Stanford certainly
looks to have the potential, especially
with a fully healthy roster.
The Cardinal will next take to the
court on Thursday night as New
Mexico visits Maples Pavilion.Tip-off is
set for 7 p.m.
