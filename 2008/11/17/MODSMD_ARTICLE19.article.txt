### DENIS GRIFFIN MANAGING EDITOR 
After romping through preseason
action under new head coach Johnny
Dawk ins, it's safe to say that the Stan
ford men's basketball team was itching
to get back on the court in the regular
season once again.The Cardinal, which
underwent a tumultuous offseason —
losing its twin big men, Brook and
Robin Lopez, to the NBA and former
coach Trent Johnson to LSU within a
matter of days — passed its first test in
its return to action, downing Yale on
the road. 75-67 on Friday.
Stanford (1-0, ()-() Pacific-10 Con
ference) made liberal use of its bench
in the win.with sophomore center Josh
Owens logging the most minutes on
the team with 32 and nine players log
ging 10 minutes or more. Yet the Bull
dogs dominated Stanford in bench
scoring, 23-7.
Yale hung with the Cardinal in the
first half after jumping out to a quick 4-
0 lead, thanks to a handful of missed
lay-ins and dunks by the Stanford men.
The Cardinal, however, began to take
control early in the second half, even
tually stretching its lead to nine points
with 11:34 remaining and a game-high

GAME NOTES: Although it is still very eorly in the
season, both Stanford and CSU-Northridge are
defending perfect records. The Cardinal will
play nine of its next 11 in Maples Pavilion and is
hoping to establish dominance on its home
court this season. Last year, the Card compiled a
16-1 record a* home.
13 points at the 3:27 mark.
"Give Yale a lot of credit." Dawkins
told The San Jose Mercury News after
the game. "They played hard in the
first half defensively and sped us up
some. We got a little bit too last earlv

on. As we started to get settled in the
second half, run our offense and space
the floor like we want to do, we were
able to get higher-percentage looks.
That was the key."
Stanford was paced offensively dur
ing its second-half run and all game
long by senior forward Lawrence Hill
and senior guard Anthony Goods. I lill
scored a team-high 22 points on an ef
ficient. 8-for-l I shooting. Hill also
pulled down 11 rebounds to notch his
first double-double of 200N and the
third of his Stanford career. Goods,
meanwhile, was 6-for-15 shooting and
4-for-7 from beyond the arc for 19
points in 31 minutes.
Fellow senior Mitch Johnson was
the only other (Ordinal player to finish
with double digits in points.The Cardi
nal's starting point guard was 3-for-K
from the field but 5-for-H from the
free-throw line, adding 11 points and,
perhaps more tellingly, six assists.
Johnson's ability to distribute the ball
effectively will be of key importance
this season as the loss of the Lopez
twins down low will likely necessitate
more ball movement for the Cardinal
offensively.
