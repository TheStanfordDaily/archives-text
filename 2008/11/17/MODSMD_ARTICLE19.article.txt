## Stanford wins on East Coast 
### DENIS GRIFFIN MANAGING EDITOR 
After romping through preseason
action under new head coach Johnny
Dawk ins, it's safe to say that the Stan
ford men's basketball team was itching
to get back on the court in the regular
season once again.The Cardinal, which
underwent a tumultuous offseason —
losing its twin big men, Brook and
Robin Lopez, to the NBA and former
coach Trent Johnson to LSU within a
matter of days — passed its first test in
its return to action, downing Yale on
the road. 75-67 on Friday.
Stanford (1-0, ()-() Pacific-10 Con
ference) made liberal use of its bench
in the win.with sophomore center Josh
Owens logging the most minutes on
the team with 32 and nine players log
ging 10 minutes or more. Yet the Bull
dogs dominated Stanford in bench
scoring, 23-7.
Yale hung with the Cardinal in the
first half after jumping out to a quick 4-
0 lead, thanks to a handful of missed
lay-ins and dunks by the Stanford men.
The Cardinal, however, began to take
control early in the second half, even
tually stretching its lead to nine points
with 11:34 remaining and a game-high

GAME NOTES: Although it is still very eorly in the
season, both Stanford and CSU-Northridge are
defending perfect records. The Cardinal will
play nine of its next 11 in Maples Pavilion and is
hoping to establish dominance on its home
court this season. Last year, the Card compiled a
16-1 record a* home.
13 points at the 3:27 mark.
"Give Yale a lot of credit." Dawkins
told The San Jose Mercury News after
the game. "They played hard in the
first half defensively and sped us up
some. We got a little bit too last earlv

on. As we started to get settled in the
second half, run our offense and space
the floor like we want to do, we were
able to get higher-percentage looks.
That was the key."
Stanford was paced offensively dur
ing its second-half run and all game
long by senior forward Lawrence Hill
and senior guard Anthony Goods. I lill
scored a team-high 22 points on an ef
ficient. 8-for-l I shooting. Hill also
pulled down 11 rebounds to notch his
first double-double of 200N and the
third of his Stanford career. Goods,
meanwhile, was 6-for-15 shooting and
4-for-7 from beyond the arc for 19
points in 31 minutes.
Fellow senior Mitch Johnson was
the only other (Ordinal player to finish
with double digits in points.The Cardi
nal's starting point guard was 3-for-K
from the field but 5-for-H from the
free-throw line, adding 11 points and,
perhaps more tellingly, six assists.
Johnson's ability to distribute the ball
effectively will be of key importance
this season as the loss of the Lopez
twins down low will likely necessitate
more ball movement for the Cardinal
offensively.

Senior Lawrence Hill reaches for the ball in an exhibition game last
week. Hill notched a double-double, scoring 22 and collecting 1 1
rebounds to pace the Cardinal.
Another player who will need to
step up to replace the production of
Brook and Robin Lopez also per
formed well in his first regular-sea
son action of 2008. as sophomore
center Josh Owens chipped in eight
points and pulled down six boards
in the first start of his collegiate
career. It was a solid start to the sea
son for Owens, who scored 30 points
and grabbed 26 rebounds in 105
minutes during his freshman year. It
was also the most work Owens had
ever received during his time on the
Farm, as he eclipsed his previous
high in time played in a single game
by 12 minutes.
Next up for the Stanford men is
Tuesday night's home opener
against Cal State-Northridge. The
Matadors won their season opener
73-62 over Cal Lutheran.
Northridge was led by guard Josh
Jenkins with 16 points, while Tony

Osunsanmi recorded 14 rebounds
off the bench. The Matadors fin
ished last season 20-10 playing in
the Big West Conference.
The game against CSU-
Northridge marks the beginning of
a heavy stretch of home competi
tion for the Cardinal, which will
host nine of its next 11 games.
Between now and Jan. 4. Stanford
will take on the Matadors, Air
Force, Colorado, Northern Arizona.
Northwestern. Texas Tech and
Hartford in non-conference compe
tition and open its conference
schedule with Arizona State and
Arizona at home. Stanford will also
be staying close to home in one of
its two road games over that span, as
the team takes on the Broncos in
Santa Clara. Calif, on Dec. 23. with
the team's only significant travel
before January coming in the form
of a Dec. 14 game at Colorado State.
Tip-off against the Matadors is
scheduled for 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday
at Maples Pavilion.
