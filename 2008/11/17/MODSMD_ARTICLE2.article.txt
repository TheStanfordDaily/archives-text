## Student protest of 8 continues Rally marches through Old Union, Tresidder, Bookstore 
### RYAN MAC STAFF WRITER Bay Area demonstrations 
More than a week after California voters
passed Proposition 8. which banned same-sex mar
riage. Stanford students showed they were not yet
ready to back down in the fight over the right of
same-sex couples to wed. Students demonstrated
on campus Friday, and several joined Saturday's
nationwide rallies.
On Friday at noon, a group of about 30 students
organized in White Pla/a and marched around
campus to voice the concerns of the LGBT com
munity. specifically focusing on the troubles of
queer youth. Dressed in black, demonstrators
staged performances across campus to portray the
negative messages associated with propositions
that banned gay marriage in California, Arizona
and Florida last Tuesday.
"One in three queer and questioning youth
attempt suicide," activist and organizer Laura
Wadden '09 said over a megaphone. 'What mes
sages are we sending our children?"
While the statistic may be debatable, the mes
sage was clear from organizers â€” there is an evi
dent problem with queer suicide attempts.
Speaking toThe Daily after the demonstration,
Wadden said that the point of the rally was to
demonstrate one of the many negative conse
quences that have been reaffirmed with the recent
ban on same-sex marriage.
"We've been reflecting a lot on how Prop. 8 has
had other consequences aside from the direct
ban." she said. "Coming out is so hard, and there
already is so much opposition against queer rights.
ITiese propositions send a clear message to these
youth: your life is invalid."
The march went across East Campus, stopping
everywhere from Old Union toTresidder Express
to Wilbur Dining to enact stage performances.
Marching under the name "The Emma Goldman
Society for Queer Liberation," the informal stu
dent group wanted to make it clear that they
would not stop in the fight for queer rights and
recognition.
Bethany Wylie '10 watched the demonstration
as it moved through Stern Dining.
"I think it's great that people are standing up
against Prop. 8," she said. "It will definitely send a
message when the issue comes up again, whether
it be in California or wherever, that people are
upset."
Director of Stanford Bookstore Kenneth
Bowers, though undecided on the issue, sympa
thized with the students' need to express them
selves. Speaking after the march moved through
the bookstore, Bowers reaffirmed the need for
open on-campus expression.
"The Stanford Bookstore is a great place for
students to express themselves, especially since
this demonstration was brief and well-organized."
he said. "Bookstores are places for the free flow of
ideas. This bookstore has been the site of various
demonstrations before and probably will be long
after."
As for on-campus L.C iBT activism, there seems
to be no drop off in terms of support after the Prop
8 decision. Laura Wadden echoed this sentiment.
