Though the final score may say
that the Cardinal lost to USC
this weekend. Stanford as a
whole lost to the Trojans on Saturday
afternoon.Two things about the game
thoroughly irked me long after the
final whistle blew.They irked me more
than the hordes of USC fans in the sta
dium. because they're there every
year — and really, who can stop them
from buying tickets. And they irked
me more than the intimidating, near
illegal physical play of USC that, in the
end, crushed Stanford in the second
half.
First, as a Stanford fan. it was dev
astating to see the USC marching
band get the best of our very own Le
land Stanford Junior University
Marching Band (LSJUMB). In the
pregame show, the Trojan band mock
ingly played a rendition of "All Right
Now," while their Song Girls pranced
around in Dollie fashion. Despite the
boos and heckling from the Red
Zone, the USC band did what they
wanted without retribution. After
wards, though their X-men getup was
quite impressive, the LSJUMB did a
relatively tame show about President
Bush's last days in office — no men
tion of last year's upset.no mention of
"Big Balls Pete" or any credit card
jokes.
I understand the LSJUMB is prob
ably underdose scrutiny,but the USC
band set the tone for Saturday's
match. And, throughout the game,
USC's band played its fight song over
and over, pumping up its fans, while
the LSJUMB could only manage to fit
in an occasional song. I don't know
about you. but I was simply sick of
hearing them play all game and drown
out our own band in our house. I was
sick ofThe Spirit ofTroy playing inces
santly all evening, as the lead slowly
slipped from our Cardinal's hands.
While the halftime show did poke
fun at last year's upset.it simply wasn't
enough. Could it hurt to have a wilder
band humiliate IJSCand help rally the
Cardinal fans in the crowd? How
about limiting the Trojan band from
playing all night in our stadium? I
know: don't sink to their level. We did
n't, but quite frankly, look at the final
score. USC had more energy the en
tire game, while Stanford was deflated
by the second half. Game: Trojans.
On the football side. Pete Carroll
and his staff out-coached Jim Har
baugh and his. As the saying goes, fool
me once, shame on you: fool me twice,
shame on me. On Stanford's first kick
off. Ronald Johnson returned for 66
yards, setting up a Trojan field goal.
Okay, so they got us once. I low about
two or three more times? Throughout
the game, Stanford simply refused or
was unable to kick the ball into the
endzone for a touchback.
In the second quarter, C.J. Gable
returned a kickoff for a 93-yard touch
down to tie the score at 17. A few min
utes later, USC opened the second
half with a 47-yard return, setting up
good field position for the Trojans,
which pinned Stanford in its territory
and led to a go-ahead touchdown.
While Stafon Johnson and Gable
punished our defensive line in the sec
ond half, the game MVP was USC's
kicker. David Buehler. USC had four
touchbackson the night,nullifyingour
running game and any chance of
breaking free for good field position.
As the final nail in the coffin.
Buehler's final touchback actually
cleared the endzone, begging the
question: Why was Stanford's kicking
game so unable to do that? Is there re
ally no one on the Stanford roster able
to kick the ball deep enough, consis
tently enough, to prevent that kind of
advantage?
Without the three long kickoff re
turns, USC probably would have en
tered the half down 17-7. Given last
year's upset, the lead would have
wreaked havoc in their locker room,
and Stanford might have emerged
from the half with a mental edge. In
stead. the score was tied, and Stanford
was left pressing the entire second
half, trying to ward off a relentless Tro
jan attack. Despite Toby Gerhart's
best efforts, it was Stanford's special
teams that really shot the team in the
foot in what seemed to be a winnable
game.
On the bright side, the Cardinal


Anthony
Nguyen
I
played a competitive game and
showed the football world what it
can do.The offense and defense were
both impressive in the first half, scor
ing more points than the Trojans had
allowed in their last five games com
bined and rendering Mark Sanchez
ineffective with constant pressure.
And despite a jarring hit in the first
quarter. Gerhart bounced back for
101 yards, including his HXX)th yard
of the season, as students chanted his
name in the Red Zone.
While USC may have stolen a
game at Stanford's house this week
end. Stanford's play gives me hope
for Saturday's Big Game. One more
game. One more chance to finish off
this season the rieht wav.

Anthony Nguyen really, really wishes
he could get that (JSC fight song out of
his head. Contact him at angiiyen9@
