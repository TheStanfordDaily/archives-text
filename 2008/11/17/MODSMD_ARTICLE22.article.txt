## No moral victories in Big Game Stanford needs to win, not just play well in the finale 
### JACK SALISBURY DESK EDITOR 
Coming into Saturday's game
against USC, Stanford head coach
Jim Harbaugh was quoted as saying
"there are no moral victories at
Stanford."
Harbaugh's comment came right
after a tough loss on the road at Ore
gon, and it cemented the idea that,
while it's great to see Stanford final
ly playing well, it doesn't mean much
if the Cardinal can't book a win at
the end of the day.
Along that line of thinking, the
Trojans' 45-23 win over Stanford on
Saturday was a devastating loss for
the Cardinal, a team which only
needs one more win to qualify for a
bowl game — and has one more
game to do it. But that's not how 1
viewed Saturday's outcome. Some
may have to forgive me for saying
this, especially the less-patient, but
Saturday's loss to USC was a victory
— "moral" or whatever you want to
call it — in a number of ways for the
Cardinal. Just take a look at the
numbers.
USC gave up 13 points in its pre
vious five games coming into Satur
day's match-up. Stanford scored 23.
The Cardinal dominated the line of
scrimmage in the first half, out
gaining USC 210 yards to 90. The
team would finish with 367 total
yards, the most anyone has put up
on the Trojans ail season. More than
200 of those yards came on the
ground, indicating a kind of physi
cality that hasn't been seen on the
Farm from the home team in some
time.
And. after all. the game was tied
going into halftime. If it weren't for a
93-yard kickoff return bv the Tro
jans' C.J. Gable with just four min
utes left going into the half, we may
have had another shocker on our
hands.
Here's the most important thing
to remember, though: all of this
came against a superior team, a Tro
jan squad that is bigger, stronger and
faster than the Cardinal across the
board.
To look at things away from the
field for a second, the stands were

filled on Saturday. Sure, there was
probably more cardinal and gold
than Cardinal and white, but Satur
day's game was something to be ex
cited about. "Excitement" and
"Stanford football" are two phrases
that have been mutually exclusive
for most of the past decade.
Win or lose, the Cardinal stood
tall on Saturday. The team traded
blow-for-blow with the Trojans, until
it ran out of gas in about the ninth
round. And. double-digit point loss
or not, there's always something
positive to take from an effort like
that.
Moral victories are never fun. but
Saturday's loss to the Trojans was
just that.The good thing about these
kinds of wins, or losses — whatever

AROUND THE PAC-10
S, 1. USC (9-1, 7-1 Pac-10) W 45-23 v. Stanford
The No. 6 Trojans rode a fourth-quarter offensive outburst to a win over Stanford
VBr that was a lot closer than the final score would indicate.
2. Oregon State (7-3, 6-1 Pac-10) W 34-21 v. California
ISjIA Suddenly, Oregon State looks like a real threat to win the Pac-10 title, but two
big games remain, at Arizona and against Oregon.
Q3. Oregon (8-3, 6-2 Pac-10) W 55-45 v. Arizona
Jeremiah Masoli's big day against the Wildcats, going 21-26 for nearly 300
' yards and rushing for three TDs, carried the Ducks to victory.

The Wildcats rode a strong second-half effort to make things close, but couldn't
overcome Oregon on the road.
S6. Stanford (5-6, 4-4 Pac-10) L 45-23 v. USC
Another heartbreaking loss for Stanford, which held tough with the best team in
the Pac-10 through three quarters of play before falling hard in the fourth.
7. Arizona State (4-6, 3-4 Pbc-10) W 31 -0 v. Washington State
There's a definite chance for the Sun Devils to win four in a row to end 2008 and
make themselves bowl-eligible. Next up is UCLA at home.

call it — in a number of ways for the
Cardinal. Just take a look at the
numbers.
USC gave up 13 points in its pre
vious five games coming into Satur
day's match-up. Stanford scored 23.
The Cardinal dominated the line of
scrimmage in the first half, out
gaining USC 210 yards to 90. The
team would finish with 367 total
yards, the most anyone has put up
on the Trojans ail season. More than
200 of those yards came on the
ground, indicating a kind of physi
cality that hasn't been seen on the
Farm from the home team in some
time.
And. after all. the game was tied
going into halftime. If it weren't for a
93-yard kickoff return bv the Tro
jans' C.J. Gable with just four min
utes left going into the half, we may
have had another shocker on our
hands.
Here's the most important thing
to remember, though: all of this
came against a superior team, a Tro
jan squad that is bigger, stronger and
faster than the Cardinal across the
board.
To look at things away from the
field for a second, the stands were

filled on Saturday. Sure, there was
probably more cardinal and gold
than Cardinal and white, but Satur
day's game was something to be ex
cited about. "Excitement" and
"Stanford football" are two phrases
that have been mutually exclusive
for most of the past decade.
Win or lose, the Cardinal stood
tall on Saturday. The team traded
blow-for-blow with the Trojans, until
it ran out of gas in about the ninth
round. And. double-digit point loss
or not, there's always something
positive to take from an effort like
that.
Moral victories are never fun. but
Saturday's loss to the Trojans was
just that.The good thing about these
kinds of wins, or losses — whatever

AROUND THE PAC-10
S, 1. USC (9-1, 7-1 Pac-10) W 45-23 v. Stanford
The No. 6 Trojans rode a fourth-quarter offensive outburst to a win over Stanford
VBr that was a lot closer than the final score would indicate.
2. Oregon State (7-3, 6-1 Pac-10) W 34-21 v. California
ISjIA Suddenly, Oregon State looks like a real threat to win the Pac-10 title, but two
big games remain, at Arizona and against Oregon.

Jeremiah Masoli's big day against the Wildcats, going 21-26 for nearly 300
' yards and rushing for three TDs, carried the Ducks to victory.
yO * 4. California (6-4, 4-3 Pac-10) L 34-21 v. Oregon State
I VTy After scoring just 24 points in the last two weeks, Col will go into Saturday's Big
Game looking to snap a two-game losing streak.
5. Arizona (6-4, 4-3 Pac-10) L 55-45 v. Oregon

overcome Oregon on the road.
S6. Stanford (5-6, 4-4 Pac-10) L 45-23 v. USC

the Pac-10 through three quarters of play before falling hard in the fourth.
7. Arizona State (4-6, 3-4 Pbc-10) W 31 -0 v. Washington State
There's a definite chance for the Sun Devils to win four in a row to end 2008 and

nHu The Cougars were shut out for the third time in four weeks on Saturday against
jKqIL the Sun Devils.

you want to call them — is that they
end up making a team better in the
long run.
Coach Harbaugh and co.can only
hope that will come into play next
week, when Stanford takes on Cal in
the program's most important game
—on multiple levels —in a long
time.
"It's never tough to get ready for
Cal." redshirt junior safety Bo Mc-
Nally said. "This game is bigger than
enormous for us and it's Cal."
1 forgot to mention one impor
tant thing about moral victories,
though: they don't apply when it
comes to the Bears.
