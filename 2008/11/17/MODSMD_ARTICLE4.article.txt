# Mental health report lags behind
## Stanford several years behind peer institutions in publicly analyzing mental health climate NEWS ANALYSIS 
### NIKHIL JOSHI DESK EDITOR 
This is the first in a five-part series this week by The Daily
focusing on campus mental health, specifically in light of the
University's report released last month. Further stories will
look at the changes being made in Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS) and Residential Education,
among other topics.

Stanford is several years behind peer
institutions in publicly examining and
reporting on campus mental health, with
its first published analysis having come out
last month.
Hie Student Mental Health and Well-
Feeing Task Force, convened by Provost
John Etchemendy in fall 2006. released an
88-page report on Oct. 1 detailing the cam
pus mental health climate and outlining
recommendations for future courses of
action. ITie report is the University's first
published, comprehensive examination in
response to recent trends in student men
tal health.
But other institutions released similar
reports years ago.

MIT completed a mental health report
in 2001. Harvard, Princeton and Cornell all
followed with their own reports in 2004,
and the University of California system
released a report in 2006.
In Etchemendy's fall 2006 charge letter
to the task force, he cited national and
Stanford-specific trends that point to a
growing number of increasingly complex
mental health issues.
"It is now well recognized that the
prevalence and complexity of student
mental health issues has grown in recent
years both nationally and here at
Stanford," Etchemendy wrote.
But if the deterioration of college men
tal health is in fact a national phenome
non. then Stanford's response to the prob
lem is far behind — the University did not
commission a task force until after MIT.
Harvard, Princeton. Cornell and the UC
system had all studied the issue and pub
lished reports.
Etchemendy did not provide comment
on his charge letter and the report's tim
ing, despite requests by The Daily.
Defending the report
At a meeting with The Daily three

weeks ago. University administrators
defended the report's comparatively late
release date.
"I don't consider this to be a race to see
who can come up with a report first, but
for our community, for our campus, it was
time for us to address this," said Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman.
Dr. Ira Friedman, director of Vaden
Health Center, agreed with Boardman.
"Issues do emerge at different universi
ties at different rates, and our desire was to
address it when we felt that we needed to."
Friedman said. "Also, I don't think it's fair
to say that we weren't looking at these
issues before. There was a lot of discussion
on campus, among administrators and stu
dent affairs professionals, on these issues."
According to Boardman. the
University's focus on mental health began
shortly after he was appointed Vice
Provost for Student Affairs in January
2006. At that time, Boardman began dis
cussing student mental health with
Friedman, as the administrators noticed
that mental health situations were increas
ing in complexity and frequency.
"There was not anything magical about
the time," Boardman said. "We were hav

ing issues, not unlike many other institu
tions."
Administrators did not point to partic
ular events precipitating the task force and
its timing, rather citing a general trend.
Notably, however, multiple suicides
occurred in the 2006-2007 school year.
According to Boardman, Stanford has
actually been ahead of the curve in cam
pus mental health efforts.
"To be honest with you. we had a very
strong safety net. we were probably fur
ther along [than other universities],"
Boardman said. "We may not have had a
report, but our practices, our support sys
tem ... many of those were already in
place, while 1 think that many other uni
versities actually looked to us for some
best practices."
Some universities that released reports
at the beginning of the decade were
indeed behind the rest of the nation.
In its 2001 mental health report, MIT
reported that it was the only school in a
group of nine peer institutions to not have
evening mental health office hours, and
had a lower mental health services utiliza
tion rate (12 percent) than peer institu-
tions (14-16 percent).
The numbers: Counseling services
A key indicator when gauging
how well a university is respond
ing to mental health concerns is
the ratio of students to mental
health staff. The International
Association of Counseling
Services (lACS) recommends
that one "full-time equivalent"
professional staff member be
retained for every 1.000 to 1,500
students.
In the Stanford report, the
task force found that the
University did not meet this
ratio, and recommended the
immediate hiring of additional
counselors. Since the report's
release, the University has hired
one new. full-time psychiatry
physician also serving as direc
tor. three new psychology Ph.D.s,
two new half-time psychiatry
physicians and one masters-level
case management social worker.
One psychologist position has
yet to be filled, according to
Friedman.
Stanford, as of 2008, now
meets the lACS recommended
ratio, according to Boardman.
At the University of
California, administrators also
found that they were not meeting
this critical ratio — in 2006.
When it released its report in
2004, Princeton identified a "best
practices" level of staff increases
at a cost of $I.K million, and then
recommended an increase of 1 1
additional "full-time equivalent"

University Health Services staff
members at an annual cost of
$935,000.
In its 2001 report, MIT identi
fied that its mental health stu
dent-to-staffing ratio was behind
peer institutions, and recom
mended that three to four full
time positions be added.
The numbers: Service utilization
Looking at trends in mental
health data can be a reliable, rela
tively bias-free way to quantita
tively assess the collegiate mental
health climate. But Stanford's
report, unlike that of several other
institutions, lacks basic data on
the level of utilization of campus
mental health resources.
The MIT report sets a bench
mark for an expected future level
of utilization (20 percent of stu
dents).
The University of California
published extensive data on past
and present psychiatric admis
sions, across the UC system. The
study found, worryingly, that psy
chiatric admissions were increas
ing at a rate higher than enroll
ment growth.
Nowhere in the Stanford report
is data on student utilization of
mental health resources.
Friedman told The Daily that
Stanford currently has a similar
utilization rate to MIT in 2001 —
with 10 to 12 percent of students
visiting CAPS each year. He
added, however. that the
University does not have a specif
ic target for utilization in mind,
rather pursuing efforts at preven
tion of issues that would lead a
student to CAPS.
Putting the report in perspective
According to ASSU Senator

Patrick Cordova '09, who was a
member of the task force, the
group's effort was important
because it forced a variety of top
administrators to look closely at
mental health.
"It's interesting that there has
been for years some administrators
that really understand it," Cordova
said. "There have -ah>o been more
high-ranking individuals who real
ly have not had it at the top of their
mind. Because this was such a
highly charged and well-funded
cause, it really has reached high
up."
University administrators
agreed that fact-finding was the
task force's main purpose, but
insisted that, like at some other
universities, action would follow
quickly.
"We already have had some
action with CAPS," Boardman
said. "We have had implementa
tion of QPR [Question, Persuade
and Refer], and that's going at full
force. Right now we are in the final
stages of adopting an oversight
committee, who will be assigned to
monitoring the progress."
The Daily will be covering
changes within CAPS later this
week.
But with the slow economy, and
the recent announcement of $45
million in University budget cuts,
the mental health task force's rec
ommendations may not be imple
mented right away.
"To be honest, the timing of
some this may be unfortunate with
the economy as it is, so we are
vying for resources that may or
may not be available," Boardman
said.

fied that its mental health stu
dent-to-staffing ratio was behind
peer institutions, and recom
mended that three to four full
time positions be added.
The numbers: Service utilization
Looking at trends in mental
health data can be a reliable, rela
tively bias-free way to quantita
tively assess the collegiate mental
health climate. But Stanford's
report, unlike that of several other
institutions, lacks basic data on
the level of utilization of campus
mental health resources.
The MIT report sets a bench
mark for an expected future level
of utilization (20 percent of stu
dents).
The University of California
published extensive data on past
and present psychiatric admis
sions, across the UC system. The
study found, worryingly, that psy
chiatric admissions were increas
ing at a rate higher than enroll
ment growth.
Nowhere in the Stanford report
is data on student utilization of
mental health resources.
Friedman told The Daily that
Stanford currently has a similar
utilization rate to MIT in 2001 —
with 10 to 12 percent of students
visiting CAPS each year. He
added, however. that the
University does not have a specif
ic target for utilization in mind,
rather pursuing efforts at preven
tion of issues that would lead a
student to CAPS.
Putting the report in perspective
According to ASSU Senator

Patrick Cordova '09, who was a
member of the task force, the
group's effort was important
because it forced a variety of top
administrators to look closely at
mental health.
"It's interesting that there has
been for years some administrators
that really understand it," Cordova
said. "There have -ah>o been more
high-ranking individuals who real
ly have not had it at the top of their
mind. Because this was such a
highly charged and well-funded
cause, it really has reached high
up."
University administrators
agreed that fact-finding was the
task force's main purpose, but
insisted that, like at some other
universities, action would follow
quickly.
"We already have had some
action with CAPS," Boardman
said. "We have had implementa
tion of QPR [Question, Persuade
and Refer], and that's going at full
force. Right now we are in the final
stages of adopting an oversight
committee, who will be assigned to
monitoring the progress."
The Daily will be covering
changes within CAPS later this
week.
But with the slow economy, and
the recent announcement of $45
million in University budget cuts,
the mental health task force's rec
ommendations may not be imple
mented right away.
"To be honest, the timing of
some this may be unfortunate with
the economy as it is, so we are
vying for resources that may or
may not be available," Boardman
said.

This is the first in a five-part series this week by The Daily
focusing on campus mental health, specifically in light of the
University's report released last month. Further stories will
look at the changes being made in Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS) and Residential Education,
among other topics.

Stanford is several years behind peer
institutions in publicly examining and
reporting on campus mental health, with
its first published analysis having come out
last month.
Hie Student Mental Health and Well-
Feeing Task Force, convened by Provost
John Etchemendy in fall 2006. released an
88-page report on Oct. 1 detailing the cam
pus mental health climate and outlining
recommendations for future courses of
action. ITie report is the University's first
published, comprehensive examination in
response to recent trends in student men
tal health.
But other institutions released similar
reports years ago.

MIT completed a mental health report
in 2001. Harvard, Princeton and Cornell all
followed with their own reports in 2004,
and the University of California system
released a report in 2006.
In Etchemendy's fall 2006 charge letter
to the task force, he cited national and
Stanford-specific trends that point to a
growing number of increasingly complex
mental health issues.
"It is now well recognized that the
prevalence and complexity of student
mental health issues has grown in recent
years both nationally and here at
Stanford," Etchemendy wrote.
But if the deterioration of college men
tal health is in fact a national phenome
non. then Stanford's response to the prob
lem is far behind — the University did not
commission a task force until after MIT.
Harvard, Princeton. Cornell and the UC
system had all studied the issue and pub
lished reports.
Etchemendy did not provide comment
on his charge letter and the report's tim
ing, despite requests by The Daily.
Defending the report
At a meeting with The Daily three

weeks ago. University administrators
defended the report's comparatively late
release date.
"I don't consider this to be a race to see
who can come up with a report first, but
for our community, for our campus, it was
time for us to address this," said Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman.
Dr. Ira Friedman, director of Vaden
Health Center, agreed with Boardman.
"Issues do emerge at different universi
ties at different rates, and our desire was to
address it when we felt that we needed to."
Friedman said. "Also, I don't think it's fair
to say that we weren't looking at these
issues before. There was a lot of discussion
on campus, among administrators and stu
dent affairs professionals, on these issues."
According to Boardman. the
University's focus on mental health began
shortly after he was appointed Vice
Provost for Student Affairs in January
2006. At that time, Boardman began dis
cussing student mental health with
Friedman, as the administrators noticed
that mental health situations were increas
ing in complexity and frequency.
"There was not anything magical about
the time," Boardman said. "We were hav

ing issues, not unlike many other institu
tions."
Administrators did not point to partic
ular events precipitating the task force and
its timing, rather citing a general trend.
Notably, however, multiple suicides
occurred in the 2006-2007 school year.
According to Boardman, Stanford has
actually been ahead of the curve in cam
pus mental health efforts.
"To be honest with you. we had a very
strong safety net. we were probably fur
ther along [than other universities],"
Boardman said. "We may not have had a
report, but our practices, our support sys
tem ... many of those were already in
place, while 1 think that many other uni
versities actually looked to us for some
best practices."
Some universities that released reports
at the beginning of the decade were
indeed behind the rest of the nation.
In its 2001 mental health report, MIT
reported that it was the only school in a
group of nine peer institutions to not have
evening mental health office hours, and
had a lower mental health services utiliza
tion rate (12 percent) than peer institu-
tions (14-16 percent).
The numbers: Counseling services
A key indicator when gauging
how well a university is respond
ing to mental health concerns is
the ratio of students to mental
health staff. The International
Association of Counseling
Services (lACS) recommends
that one "full-time equivalent"
professional staff member be
retained for every 1.000 to 1,500
students.
In the Stanford report, the
task force found that the
University did not meet this
ratio, and recommended the
immediate hiring of additional
counselors. Since the report's
release, the University has hired
one new. full-time psychiatry
physician also serving as direc
tor. three new psychology Ph.D.s,
two new half-time psychiatry
physicians and one masters-level
case management social worker.
One psychologist position has
yet to be filled, according to
Friedman.
Stanford, as of 2008, now
meets the lACS recommended
ratio, according to Boardman.
At the University of
California, administrators also
found that they were not meeting
this critical ratio — in 2006.
When it released its report in
2004, Princeton identified a "best
practices" level of staff increases
at a cost of $I.K million, and then
recommended an increase of 1 1
additional "full-time equivalent"

University Health Services staff
members at an annual cost of
$935,000.
In its 2001 report, MIT identi
fied that its mental health stu
dent-to-staffing ratio was behind
peer institutions, and recom
mended that three to four full
time positions be added.
