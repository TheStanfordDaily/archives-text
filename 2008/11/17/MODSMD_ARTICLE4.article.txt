# Mental health report lags behind
## Stanford several years behind peer institutions in publicly analyzing mental health climate NEWS ANALYSIS 
### NIKHIL JOSHI DESK EDITOR 
This is the first in a five-part series this week by The Daily
focusing on campus mental health, specifically in light of the
University's report released last month. Further stories will
look at the changes being made in Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS) and Residential Education,
among other topics.

Stanford is several years behind peer
institutions in publicly examining and
reporting on campus mental health, with
its first published analysis having come out
last month.
Hie Student Mental Health and Well-
Feeing Task Force, convened by Provost
John Etchemendy in fall 2006. released an
88-page report on Oct. 1 detailing the cam
pus mental health climate and outlining
recommendations for future courses of
action. ITie report is the University's first
published, comprehensive examination in
response to recent trends in student men
tal health.
But other institutions released similar
reports years ago.

MIT completed a mental health report
in 2001. Harvard, Princeton and Cornell all
followed with their own reports in 2004,
and the University of California system
released a report in 2006.
In Etchemendy's fall 2006 charge letter
to the task force, he cited national and
Stanford-specific trends that point to a
growing number of increasingly complex
mental health issues.
"It is now well recognized that the
prevalence and complexity of student
mental health issues has grown in recent
years both nationally and here at
Stanford," Etchemendy wrote.
But if the deterioration of college men
tal health is in fact a national phenome
non. then Stanford's response to the prob
lem is far behind â€” the University did not
commission a task force until after MIT.
Harvard, Princeton. Cornell and the UC
system had all studied the issue and pub
lished reports.
Etchemendy did not provide comment
on his charge letter and the report's tim
ing, despite requests by The Daily.
Defending the report
At a meeting with The Daily three

weeks ago. University administrators
defended the report's comparatively late
release date.
"I don't consider this to be a race to see
who can come up with a report first, but
for our community, for our campus, it was
time for us to address this," said Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Greg
Boardman.
Dr. Ira Friedman, director of Vaden
Health Center, agreed with Boardman.
"Issues do emerge at different universi
ties at different rates, and our desire was to
address it when we felt that we needed to."
Friedman said. "Also, I don't think it's fair
to say that we weren't looking at these
issues before. There was a lot of discussion
on campus, among administrators and stu
dent affairs professionals, on these issues."
According to Boardman. the
University's focus on mental health began
shortly after he was appointed Vice
Provost for Student Affairs in January
2006. At that time, Boardman began dis
cussing student mental health with
Friedman, as the administrators noticed
that mental health situations were increas
ing in complexity and frequency.
"There was not anything magical about
the time," Boardman said. "We were hav

ing issues, not unlike many other institu
tions."
Administrators did not point to partic
ular events precipitating the task force and
its timing, rather citing a general trend.
Notably, however, multiple suicides
occurred in the 2006-2007 school year.
According to Boardman, Stanford has
actually been ahead of the curve in cam
pus mental health efforts.
"To be honest with you. we had a very
strong safety net. we were probably fur
ther along [than other universities],"
Boardman said. "We may not have had a
report, but our practices, our support sys
tem ... many of those were already in
place, while 1 think that many other uni
versities actually looked to us for some
best practices."
Some universities that released reports
at the beginning of the decade were
indeed behind the rest of the nation.
In its 2001 mental health report, MIT
reported that it was the only school in a
group of nine peer institutions to not have
evening mental health office hours, and
had a lower mental health services utiliza
tion rate (12 percent) than peer institu-
