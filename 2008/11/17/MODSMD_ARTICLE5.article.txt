## USC avenges last season's miraculous victory 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
For 30 minutes, it appeared that
lightning might strike twice.
Stanford dominated No. 6 USC for
the first two quarters on Saturday, but
it was unable to sustain its perform
ance in the second half. The Trojans
scored 21 points in the fourth quarter
to win 45-23 and end the Cardinal's
bid for a repeat of last year's improb
able upset victory.
But Stanford still put forth a valiant
effort against the nation's best defense.
USC entered the contest allowing just
6.7 points and 77.8 rushing yards per
game. By the end of the first quarter,
Stanford had totaled 10 points and
over 1(K) rushing yards. Junior Toby
Cierhart finished with 101 yards and a
touchdown â€” pushing him over the
I.(MM)-yard mark for the season, mak
ing him the first Stanford player since

"Touchdown" Tommy Vardell in 1991
to surpass that benchmark.
Gerhart's backup, senior Anthony
Kimble, had a score of his own and
averaged 5.4 yards per carry. Even
redshirt senior quarterback Tavita
Pritchard, who is mobile but is not
usually relied upon to run. got into the
act with a 40-yard sprint on Stanford's
opening possession.
"We stick to what we're good at."
senior center Alex Fletcher said.
"We've been running the ball well all
year, and we weren't going to change
our game plan for them. All the offen
sive linemen and the running backs
knew we were able to run the ball."
The Cardinal asserted itself early.
On its first drive of the game, it moved
the ball rapidly, taking just four min
utes to move the length of the field for
Gerhart's four-vard touchdown run.

GAME NOTES! With a win in the 111 th Big Game,
not only would the Cardinal retain control of The
Stanford Axe, but it would achieve bowl eligibility
as well, Cal is having an ordinary season, but is
undefeated at home. Stanford has not won a Big
Game in Berkeley since 2000. This is the final
game of the season for Stanford; Cal plays once
more against Washington.
