# NOT THIS TIME
## USC avenges last season's miraculous victory 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
For 30 minutes, it appeared that
lightning might strike twice.
Stanford dominated No. 6 USC for
the first two quarters on Saturday, but
it was unable to sustain its perform
ance in the second half. The Trojans
scored 21 points in the fourth quarter
to win 45-23 and end the Cardinal's
bid for a repeat of last year's improb
able upset victory.
But Stanford still put forth a valiant
effort against the nation's best defense.
USC entered the contest allowing just
6.7 points and 77.8 rushing yards per
game. By the end of the first quarter,
Stanford had totaled 10 points and
over 1(K) rushing yards. Junior Toby
Cierhart finished with 101 yards and a
touchdown — pushing him over the
I.(MM)-yard mark for the season, mak
ing him the first Stanford player since

"Touchdown" Tommy Vardell in 1991
to surpass that benchmark.
Gerhart's backup, senior Anthony
Kimble, had a score of his own and
averaged 5.4 yards per carry. Even
redshirt senior quarterback Tavita
Pritchard, who is mobile but is not
usually relied upon to run. got into the
act with a 40-yard sprint on Stanford's
opening possession.
"We stick to what we're good at."
senior center Alex Fletcher said.
"We've been running the ball well all
year, and we weren't going to change
our game plan for them. All the offen
sive linemen and the running backs
knew we were able to run the ball."
The Cardinal asserted itself early.
On its first drive of the game, it moved
the ball rapidly, taking just four min
utes to move the length of the field for
Gerhart's four-vard touchdown run.

GAME NOTES! With a win in the 111 th Big Game,
not only would the Cardinal retain control of The
Stanford Axe, but it would achieve bowl eligibility
as well, Cal is having an ordinary season, but is
undefeated at home. Stanford has not won a Big
Game in Berkeley since 2000. This is the final
game of the season for Stanford; Cal plays once
more against Washington.

Stanford senior quarterback Tavita Pritchard is chased out of the pocket by three Trojan defenders. The Cardinal outplayed
USC in the first half, but a fourth-quarter explosion by the Trojans doomed Stanford in the end.
"The first half I thought was real
ly dominated by Stanford," USC
coach Pete Carroll said. "We hung
with it. but they did a really nice job
of running the ball and making some
plays."
But on the ensuing kickoff.
Ronald Johnson took the ball all the
way to Stanford's 22-yard line, which
led to a David Buehler field goal.The
Cardinal's special teams coverage,
which had been solid all year, was
one of the team's main weaknesses
throughout the game. In the second
quarter, CJ Gable returned a kickoff
for a score, and on the opening kick
of the second half, Johnson advanced
into Stanford territory.
As a result, despite the Cardinal's
superior play on both offense and de
fense, IJSC was still very much in the
game.TheTrojans went three and out
on all but one of their first-half
drives;at halftime,however,the score
was tied 17-17.
The third quarter was essentially a
draw — the teams combined for five
punts, one turnover and only one
score. But the fourth quarter may as
well have been a different game.
USC scored on all three of its posses
sions, and the Trojan defense, which
had been uncommonly average in
the first half, prevented Stanford
from doing anything on offense.
"They really tightened up their
defense in the second half, and they
really did a nice job of bringing that
extra guy in the box." Fletcher said.
But the Cardinal still had hope,
even with less than 10 minutes left on
the clock — like last year's 24-23 vic
tory, Stanford was down by two
scores, but had possession. 1 lowever.
with the ball at midfield and trailing
31-17, coach Jim Harbaueh elected

not to go for it on fourth-and-seven.
and instead chose to punt.
For two plays, his decision ap
peared to pay off. Two short runs
and a false-start penalty later, and
USC was facing third-and-13 from
its own seven-yard line. With a stop,
the Cardinal would still have life.
But then the Trojans delivered the
final blow — Stafon Johnson broke
away for a 43-yard run, and, on the
next play, quarterback Mark
Sanchez found Stanley Havili for a
touchdown that pushed the margin
to 21 points with only 7:35 remain
ing in the game.
"When we had them pinned on
their own 10-yard line and they go
that long run. then the big play touch
down pass after that, that was kind of
a heartbreaker, especially since we
had them stopped on first and second
down," redshirt senior safety Bo Mc-
Nallv said.
"|We] could have gotten a stop
there and got the ball back at mid
field," Harbaugh said. "Give them
credit for moving the ball the length
of the field."
Even with the game essentially
over, there was still quite a bit of ac
tion. USC scored once more to take a
45-17 lead with less than two minutes
left. Not content to simply run out the

GAME NOTES! With a win in the 111 th Big Game,
not only would the Cardinal retain control of The
Stanford Axe, but it would achieve bowl eligibility
as well, Cal is having an ordinary season, but is
undefeated at home. Stanford has not won a Big
Game in Berkeley since 2000. This is the final
game of the season for Stanford; Cal plays once
more against Washington.

Stanford senior quarterback Tavita Pritchard is chased out of the pocket by three Trojan defenders. The Cardinal outplayed
USC in the first half, but a fourth-quarter explosion by the Trojans doomed Stanford in the end.
"The first half I thought was real
ly dominated by Stanford," USC
coach Pete Carroll said. "We hung
with it. but they did a really nice job
of running the ball and making some
plays."
But on the ensuing kickoff.
Ronald Johnson took the ball all the
way to Stanford's 22-yard line, which
led to a David Buehler field goal.The
Cardinal's special teams coverage,
which had been solid all year, was
one of the team's main weaknesses
throughout the game. In the second
quarter, CJ Gable returned a kickoff
for a score, and on the opening kick
of the second half, Johnson advanced
into Stanford territory.
As a result, despite the Cardinal's
superior play on both offense and de
fense, IJSC was still very much in the
game.TheTrojans went three and out
on all but one of their first-half
drives;at halftime,however,the score
was tied 17-17.
The third quarter was essentially a
draw — the teams combined for five
punts, one turnover and only one
score. But the fourth quarter may as
well have been a different game.
USC scored on all three of its posses
sions, and the Trojan defense, which
had been uncommonly average in
the first half, prevented Stanford
from doing anything on offense.
"They really tightened up their
defense in the second half, and they
really did a nice job of bringing that
extra guy in the box." Fletcher said.
But the Cardinal still had hope,
even with less than 10 minutes left on
the clock — like last year's 24-23 vic
tory, Stanford was down by two
scores, but had possession. 1 lowever.

and instead chose to punt.
For two plays, his decision ap
peared to pay off. Two short runs
and a false-start penalty later, and
USC was facing third-and-13 from
its own seven-yard line. With a stop,
the Cardinal would still have life.
But then the Trojans delivered the
final blow — Stafon Johnson broke
away for a 43-yard run, and, on the
next play, quarterback Mark
Sanchez found Stanley Havili for a
touchdown that pushed the margin
to 21 points with only 7:35 remain
ing in the game.
"When we had them pinned on
their own 10-yard line and they go
that long run. then the big play touch
down pass after that, that was kind of
a heartbreaker, especially since we
had them stopped on first and second
down," redshirt senior safety Bo Mc-
Nallv said.
"|We] could have gotten a stop
there and got the ball back at mid
field," Harbaugh said. "Give them
credit for moving the ball the length
of the field."
Even with the game essentially
over, there was still quite a bit of ac
tion. USC scored once more to take a
45-17 lead with less than two minutes
left. Not content to simply run out the

For 30 minutes, it appeared that
lightning might strike twice.
Stanford dominated No. 6 USC for
the first two quarters on Saturday, but
it was unable to sustain its perform
ance in the second half. The Trojans
scored 21 points in the fourth quarter
to win 45-23 and end the Cardinal's
bid for a repeat of last year's improb
able upset victory.
But Stanford still put forth a valiant
effort against the nation's best defense.
USC entered the contest allowing just
6.7 points and 77.8 rushing yards per
game. By the end of the first quarter,
Stanford had totaled 10 points and
over 1(K) rushing yards. Junior Toby
Cierhart finished with 101 yards and a
touchdown — pushing him over the
I.(MM)-yard mark for the season, mak
ing him the first Stanford player since

"Touchdown" Tommy Vardell in 1991
to surpass that benchmark.
Gerhart's backup, senior Anthony
Kimble, had a score of his own and
averaged 5.4 yards per carry. Even
redshirt senior quarterback Tavita
Pritchard, who is mobile but is not
usually relied upon to run. got into the
act with a 40-yard sprint on Stanford's
opening possession.
