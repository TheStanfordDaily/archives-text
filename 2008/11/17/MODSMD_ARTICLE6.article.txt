# SPEAKERS & EVENTS
## Farmer widens AIDS issue to social justice PIH founder talks strategy, ways to affect social change 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
Dr. Paul Farmer, co-founder of Partners in
Health (Pill), returned to the Farm on Friday for
the third year in a row to speak at the opening event
of the FACE AIDS conference held over the week
end. The talk was hosted hv FACE AIDS. Dance
Marathon and the ASSII Speaker's Bureau.
In 2(H)6. Farmer gave his first address at the Farm
and inspired students to participate in service-relat
ed activities and hold the University accountable for
the amount of funding it allocates to nonprofit agen
cies. In 2(K)7. he came back and outlined PlH's plans
for its community-based healthcare model to
Rwanda. This year. Farmer's talk took on a more
strategic tone as he discussed effective ways to
champion social justice across the globe.
Speaking to a packed Kresge Auditorium. Farmer
praised social justice campaigns that address a vari
ety of issues, such as the right to healthcare, clean
water resources and availability of food, by focusing
on a single cause such as AlDS,malaria or tuberculo
sis.
"One of the most powerful things about FACE
AIDS is that we have chosen to focus on a specific
place and a specific need." he said. "And that has
served as a door though which we can move and do
more to address a lot of other problems."
Farmer explained that in the past, programs that
operate on "verticals" have been criticized for being
unsustainable because heavily focusing on interven
tion in one area can distort the amount of focus
given to other areas.
"But my response to this is that if you plan your
program correctly, you'll end up reinforcing other
ones, like primary health care, access to clean
water, etc.," he said.
Farmer described the idea of establishing com
munity health programs that focus only on one par
ticular need in poverty-stricken communities as
unrealistic.
"Imagine you're working in rural Rwanda, in the
middle of nowhere," he said. "I low would you like to
say to someone coming to you with a broken arm,
'Gee I'm sorry. I only take care of AIDS here — the
broken arm clinic is down the street"? What you
need to do is capture enthusiasm and interest and
move into programs that strengthen broader
approaches other than just healthcare. You need to
address other problems that people are
facing in poverty: education, food security,
adult literacy, clean water, etc."
Farmer also stressed the importance of
social justice organizations that imple
ment strategies which work through the
public sector. He said that the primary
benefits of working in the public sector
were increased opportunities for making a
change on a larger scale and conferring
rights on individuals.
"It's true that if you want to bring some
thing to scale, you have to work in the pub
lic sector," he said. "And after all. who con
fers rights? Stanford students cannot con
fer rights on Rwandans, nor can church
groups or NGOs. That's not how you con
fer rights to education and healthcare. It's
the public sector that does that."
In addition to discussing strategic
frameworks for action. Farmer urged pru
dent allocation of investments with regard
to community-based healthcare initiatives
championed by PIH, as well as global
health organizations such as the
President's Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief (PEPFAR). He was critical of the
debate among many organizations over
whether or not community health work
ers should be paid for their labor.
"It's a radical thing, paying poor peo
ple for their labor," he said. "Let's just say
we weren't hostile to that notion.

Someone like me gets paid a huge consul
tancy fee, whereas with a poor person, we
just want them to be volunteers. That's just
nuts. It's crazy, and if we're going to be
putting all this money in global health ini
tiatives, we have to have good programs,
and you don't have good programs if you
put all money into consultants for other
people and not helping local people help
their communities. That's not a prudent
investment of our billions of dollars."
Farmer praised students for the work
they'd done. In the past three years, FACE
AIDS has raised $1.4 million and since its
initial founding has led to the establish
ment of 190 chapters nationwide.
"I saw what you did, what you do in the
right way," he said. "Yes, there are tasks
before us to make this planet the kind of
place we want to be happy to pass on to
the next generation. This world is a beau
tiful place for some people, not so beauti
ful for others. But together we can make it
better for everyone."
As in previous years, students found
Farmer's talk very inspirational. But this
year, students also appreciated his strate
gic advice.
"I think he really drove home how the
AIDS struggle is being fought within the
broader context of rights, human rights
and social justice," said David Rvan "07,
the executive director of FACE AIDS, i

think that what PIH is doing is extremely
exciting and inspiring. The last two years.
Dr. Farmer has been trying to communi
cate to us his work in Rwanda. This year,
he really got across the message of how
the AIDS fight fits within the context of a
broader struggle."
Eugene Nho i() said that student
admiration for Farmer stemmed from
their respect for his ability to set aside
agendas for personal gain in order to fight
for the welfare of others.
"When he came in and after only
speaking one word, he got a standing ova
tion," Nho said. "The kind of applause he
gets is a different type of applause than
the kind people give to people like CEOs
of companies.
"I think this is because what people
like Dr. Farmer do isn't just making
money, or doing something glorious," he
continued. "People like him are willing to
do the grunt work to make this place a
better world. The welcome that he got
sends a strong signal to a lot of people, like
myself and some of my friends, that there
are so many opportunities to participate
in social business and making the world a
better place, as opposed to pursuing per
sonal interests."

In 2(H)6. Farmer gave his first address at the Farm
and inspired students to participate in service-relat
ed activities and hold the University accountable for
the amount of funding it allocates to nonprofit agen
cies. In 2(K)7. he came back and outlined PlH's plans
for its community-based healthcare model to
Rwanda. This year. Farmer's talk took on a more
strategic tone as he discussed effective ways to
champion social justice across the globe.
Speaking to a packed Kresge Auditorium. Farmer
praised social justice campaigns that address a vari
ety of issues, such as the right to healthcare, clean
water resources and availability of food, by focusing
on a single cause such as AlDS,malaria or tuberculo
sis.
"One of the most powerful things about FACE
AIDS is that we have chosen to focus on a specific
place and a specific need." he said. "And that has
served as a door though which we can move and do
more to address a lot of other problems."
Farmer explained that in the past, programs that
operate on "verticals" have been criticized for being
unsustainable because heavily focusing on interven
tion in one area can distort the amount of focus
given to other areas.
"But my response to this is that if you plan your
program correctly, you'll end up reinforcing other
ones, like primary health care, access to clean
water, etc.," he said.
Farmer described the idea of establishing com
munity health programs that focus only on one par
ticular need in poverty-stricken communities as
unrealistic.
"Imagine you're working in rural Rwanda, in the
middle of nowhere," he said. "I low would you like to
say to someone coming to you with a broken arm,
'Gee I'm sorry. I only take care of AIDS here — the
broken arm clinic is down the street"? What you
need to do is capture enthusiasm and interest and
move into programs that strengthen broader
approaches other than just healthcare. You need to
address other problems that people are
facing in poverty: education, food security,
adult literacy, clean water, etc."
Farmer also stressed the importance of
social justice organizations that imple
ment strategies which work through the
public sector. He said that the primary
benefits of working in the public sector
were increased opportunities for making a
change on a larger scale and conferring
rights on individuals.
"It's true that if you want to bring some
thing to scale, you have to work in the pub
lic sector," he said. "And after all. who con
fers rights? Stanford students cannot con
fer rights on Rwandans, nor can church
groups or NGOs. That's not how you con
fer rights to education and healthcare. It's
the public sector that does that."
In addition to discussing strategic
frameworks for action. Farmer urged pru
dent allocation of investments with regard
to community-based healthcare initiatives
championed by PIH, as well as global
health organizations such as the
President's Emergency Plan for AIDS
Relief (PEPFAR). He was critical of the
debate among many organizations over
whether or not community health work
ers should be paid for their labor.
"It's a radical thing, paying poor peo
ple for their labor," he said. "Let's just say
we weren't hostile to that notion.

Someone like me gets paid a huge consul
tancy fee, whereas with a poor person, we
just want them to be volunteers. That's just
nuts. It's crazy, and if we're going to be
putting all this money in global health ini
tiatives, we have to have good programs,
and you don't have good programs if you
put all money into consultants for other
people and not helping local people help
their communities. That's not a prudent
investment of our billions of dollars."
Farmer praised students for the work
they'd done. In the past three years, FACE
AIDS has raised $1.4 million and since its
initial founding has led to the establish
ment of 190 chapters nationwide.
"I saw what you did, what you do in the
right way," he said. "Yes, there are tasks
before us to make this planet the kind of
place we want to be happy to pass on to
the next generation. This world is a beau
tiful place for some people, not so beauti
ful for others. But together we can make it
better for everyone."
As in previous years, students found
Farmer's talk very inspirational. But this
year, students also appreciated his strate
gic advice.
"I think he really drove home how the
AIDS struggle is being fought within the
broader context of rights, human rights
and social justice," said David Rvan "07,
the executive director of FACE AIDS, i

think that what PIH is doing is extremely
exciting and inspiring. The last two years.
Dr. Farmer has been trying to communi
cate to us his work in Rwanda. This year,
he really got across the message of how
the AIDS fight fits within the context of a
broader struggle."
Eugene Nho i() said that student
admiration for Farmer stemmed from
their respect for his ability to set aside
agendas for personal gain in order to fight
for the welfare of others.
"When he came in and after only
speaking one word, he got a standing ova
tion," Nho said. "The kind of applause he
gets is a different type of applause than
the kind people give to people like CEOs
of companies.
"I think this is because what people
like Dr. Farmer do isn't just making
money, or doing something glorious," he
continued. "People like him are willing to
do the grunt work to make this place a
better world. The welcome that he got
sends a strong signal to a lot of people, like
myself and some of my friends, that there
are so many opportunities to participate
in social business and making the world a
better place, as opposed to pursuing per
sonal interests."
