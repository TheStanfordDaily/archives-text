## Even as winds calm, more californians flee wildfires So Cal residents flee fires 
### JUSTIN PRITCHARD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
More residents of Southern Cali
fornia were urged to leave their
homes Sunday despite calming
winds that allowed a major aerial at
tack on wildfires that have destroyed
hundreds of homes and blanketed
the region in smoke.
Fires burned in Los Angeles
County, to the east in Riverside and
Orange counties, and to the north
west in Santa Barbara County. More
than 800 houses, mobile homes and
apartments were destroyed by fires
that have burned areas more than 34
square miles since breaking out
Thursday.
No deaths have been reported,
but police brought in trained dogs
Sunday morning to search the rubble
of a mobile home park where nearly
500 homes were destroyed.They did
n't find any bodies after searching
about a third of the homes.
"This has been a very tough few
days for the people of Southern Cal
ifornia," Gov. Arnold Schwarzeneg
ger said after touring damage.
The smell of smoke pervaded
metropolitan Los Angeles. Down
town skyscrapers were silhouettes in
an opaque sky, and concerns about
air quality forced organizers to can
cel a marathon in suburban Pasade
na where 8,000 runners had planned
to participate.
Fierce Santa Ana winds that
fanned the fires on Saturday weak
ened Sunday morning, allowing fire
fighters to set backfires to prevent
flames from advancing to hillside
neighborhoods. Air tankers swooped
low over suburbs, red fire retardant
billowing from their bellies as they

painted defensive lines between
brushlands and homes. Big helicop
ters shuttled back and forth on water
drops.
The most threatening blaze had
scorched more than 16 square miles
in Orange and Riverside counties
after erupting Saturday and shooting
through subdivisions entwined with
wilderness parklands. Multimillion
dollar homes were threatened in Di
amond Bar in Los Angeles County as
the out-of-control fire pushed north
ward.
Fire officials on Sunday morning
ordered 1,400 more residents to
evacuate, in addition to 26,500 who
had already been told to leave.
Retired aerospace engineer Joe
Gomez, who has lived in his palm
tree-lined Diamond Bar neighbor
hood for 45 years, stayed put despite
being under a mandatory evacuation.
"I'm trying to use some logic
here," said Gomez, 72. trying to
gauge the direction of the wind and
flames. "I don't think it's going to
come down this way."
In the early morning, winds
pushed flames dangerously close to a
church and adjacent mobile home
park in the Olinda Village area north
ofYorba Linda, but firefighters were
able to beat it back. Only one mobile
home was lost.
On Saturday, the fire burned 119
homes in the communities of Coro
na. Yorba Linda and Anaheim. In ad
dition, 50 units of an apartment com
plex burned. Orange County fire
spokeswoman Angela Garbiso said.
