Iraq's Cabinet overwhelmingly
approved a security pact with the
United States on Sunday ending pro
longed negotiations to allow Ameri
can forces to remain for three more
years in the country they first occu
pied in 2003.
The deal detailing the conditions
of the U.S. presence still needs parlia
mentary approval, and lawmakers
could vote as soon as Nov. 24. For
Iraqis, the breakthrough was bitter
sweet because they won concessions
from the Americans but must accept
the presence of U.S. troops until
2012.
"It's the best possible, available
option," said government
spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh. He was
referring to the conflict between
Iraq's desire for full sovereignty and
control over security and its need for
American support and cooperation
to achieve that goal.
Al-Dabbagh described the pact
— intended to supplant the U.N.
mandate expiring Dec. 31 —as an
"agreement on the withdrawal of
U.S. troops." and Washington wel
comed the Cabinet's approval.
"While the process is not yet
complete, we remain hopeful and
confident we'll soon have an
agreement that serves both the
people of Iraq and the United
States well and sends a signal to

the region and the world that both
our governments are committed to
a stable, secure and democratic
Iraq." said Gordon Johndroe.
spokesman for the White House's
National Security Council.
There is a good chance parlia
ment will pass the agreement with a
large majority since the parties that
make up Prime Minister Nouri al-
Maliki's coalition government domi
nate the legislature.
The pact was due to be completed
by the end of July, but negotiations
stumbled over parts pertaining to
Iraqi sovereignty and judicial over
sight.
Al-Dabbagh said Iraq's govern
ment has received U.S. assurances
that the President-elect Barack
Obama would honor the agreement,
and pointed out that each side has
the right to repeal it after giving one
year's notice. Obama. who takes of
fice in January, has said he would pull

U.S. combat troops out of Iraq within
16 months of moving into the White
House — or May 2010.
Iraq's neighbors and U.S. adver
saries, Iran and Syria, oppose the
pact, arguing that the immediate
withdrawal of U.S. forces offered the
best option for Iraq.
The Iraqi government sought to
allay their fears, amending the docu
ment to prohibit the Americans from
using Iraqi territory to attack neigh
boring nations.
The Cabinet's decision was
made amid violence, despite a dra
matic improvement in security over
the past year. Fresh attacks under
lined doubts about whether Iraq's
nascent security forces can stand
without U.S. military support and
training.
Hours after the Cabinet vote,
seven people died and seven were
wounded in a suicide car bombing
at a police checkpoint in Diyala, a

turbulent province northeast of
Baghdad, according to police Col.
Ahmed Khalifa, chief of Jalula po
lice station.
The U.S. military said the attack in
Jalula occurred at a police station
and that four police and six civilians
died. There was no immediate expla
nation for the discrepancy in the re
ports.
Al-Dabbagh said all but one of 28
Cabinet ministers present in Sun
day's meeting, in addition to al-Mali
ki. voted for the pact.The sole vote of
dissent came from Minister of
Women's Affairs Nawal al-Samaraie,
a member of the Iraqi Islamic Party,
the country's largest Sunni Arab
party.
TTie Cabinet vote came a day after
Iraq's most influential Shiite cleric.
Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, indi
cated he would not object to the pact
if it passes by a comfortable majority
in parliament.
