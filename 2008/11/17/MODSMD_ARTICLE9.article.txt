Showdown looming in Congress over automaker rescue
Hardline opponents of an auto industry bailout branded the industry
a "dinosaur" whose "day of reckoning" is near, while Democrats pledged
Sunday to do their best to get Detroit a slice of the $700 billion Wall Street
rescue in this week's lame-duck session of Congress.
The companies are seeking $25 billion from the financial industry
bailout for emergency loans, though supporters of the aid for General
Motors Corp.. Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler LLC have offered to reduce
the size of the rescue to win backing in Congress.
A White House alternative would let the car companies take $25 bil
lion in loans previously approved to develop fuel-efficient vehicles and
use the money for more immediate needs. Congressional Democrats op
pose the White House plan as shortsighted.
Majority Democrats will need at least a dozen GOP votes in the Sen
ate to prevent opponents from blocking their measure — assuming all
Senate Democrats support it. Senate Republican Leader Mitch Mc-
Connell of Kentucky questioned whether there was sufficient Democra
tic support for an auto bailout in a statement released Sunday.
"The silence from the Democrat rank and file on this matter has been
deafening," McConnell said.
Japan's economy shrinks in third quarter, enters recession
Japan says its economy contracted in the third quarter, the second con
secutive quarter of decline, officially putting the world's No. 2 economy in
a recession.
Japan's gross domestic product fell at an annual pace of 0.4 percent in
the July-September period, following a 3.0 decline percent decline in the
April-June period, the Cabinet Office reported early Monday.
Japanese companies sharply cut back on spending amid the global
slowdown, the data showed.
Truck ban hampers supply line to U.S. in Afghanistan
Container trucks and oil tankers bound for U.S and NATO troops in
Afghanistan have suspended deliveries after militant attacks prompted
Pakistan to block a major supply line, highlighting the vulnerability of the
mountain passage.
The ban in northwest Pakistan,confirmed on Sunday, was intended to
allow for a review of security in the famed Khyber Pass. The convoys cur
rently have little to no security detail as they travel to Afghanistan with
vital food, fuel and other goods.
The suspension could be lifted as early as Monday with new procedures
in place, said Bakhtiar Khan, a No. 2 government representative in the
area.
Al-Oaida and Taliban fighters are behind much of the escalating vio
lence along the lengthy, porous Afghan-Pakistan border. Both
Afghanistan and Pakistan have accused each other of not doing enough to
stop militant activity, while U.S. missile strikes in Pakistani territory have
ratcheted up tensions further.
U.S. and NATO officials in Afghanistan have sought to downplay
threats posed to the convoys coming through Pakistan, but NATO has said
it is close to striking pacts with Central Asian countries that would let it
transport "non-lethal" supplies from north of Afghanistan.
Burlington, Vt. is healthiest city, CDC says
What's the healthiest city in America? It appears to be Burlington. Vt.
Vermont's largest city is tops among U.S. metropolitan areas by having
the largest proportion of people — 92 percent — who say they are in good
or great health.
It's also among the best in exercise and among the lowest in obesity, di
abetes and other measures of ill health, according to a recent report from
the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
This New England city of 40.000, on the shores of Lake Champlain, is
in some ways similar to the unhealthiest city — Huntington, W.Va. Both
are out-of-the-way college towns with populations that are overwhelming
ly white people of English. German or Irish ancestry.
