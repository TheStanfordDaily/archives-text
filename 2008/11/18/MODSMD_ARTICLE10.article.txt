## Dining pushes sustainable seafood Panel provides insight on risks of conventional seafood sources

As part of its commitment to nutritional sustain- I:
ability, Stanford Dining sponsored a Faculty Speaker 1
Education Series last week. A main component of I
Stanford's Seafood Sustainability Week, the lecture 1
series featured Meg Caldwell, director of the Center \
for Ocean Solutions at the Woods Institute for the
Environment, and key players in the seafood industry.
"The Faculty Speaker Series is intended to provide
the Stanford student community with a very tangible,
accessible and immediate way to benefit from the cut
ting-edge information emanating from faculty and cam
pus-based researchers involved in sustainability," said
Dining Executive Director Eric Montell in a press
release.
During Seafood Sustainability Week. Nov. 10 to 14,
Dining served sustainable seafood items and worked to
foster student awareness about the environmental toll
of their dining decisions.
Wednesday evening's panel included Michael Sutton
of the Monterey Bay Aquarium. Christopher Loss of the
Culinary Institute of America and Randy Rice of the
Alaska Seafood Marketing Institute. The informal dis
cussion covered the basics of seafood consumption —
where it comes from, how the supply chain works and
what sustainable seafood means. In addition.Thursday's
lecture featured Taras Grescoe. author of Bottomfeeder:
How to Eat Ethically in a World of Vanishing Seafood.
In seeking to define sustainability, Sutton chose a
simple approach.
"Everyone who has a bank account knows what sus
tainability means," Sutton said. "It means to use but to
not use up."
According to Sutton, a sustainable fishery has a
healthy population, does not pillage the ecosystem and
exercises good management. Rice added that sustain
ability in the context of fisheries includes an element of
prudent utilization.
Currently, the United States imports SO percent of its
seafood, often from countries that do not uphold sus
tainable practices. Decades of irresponsible fishing have
resulted in the commercial extinction of some species of
sea life. Consumers who enjoy eating certain fish, such
as tuna and shark, do not often realize that they con
tribute to the serial depletion of top predators.
Simultaneously, fishermen who respond to consumer
demand fish down the food chain and disrupt the
ecosystem.
One means of mitigating the negative consequences
of imprudent fishing focuses on awareness and con
sumer knowledge. For this reason, a key goal of Seafood

Sustainability
Week involved
increasing stu-

dent body knowledge about sustainable seafood.
"The main objective is education," Loss said. "When
education is the focus, it seems to be more credible."
In part, what Loss referred to is the need for reliable
sources on sustainability. Indeed, the U.S. government
does provide information regarding the sustainability of
its seafood supply, but its knowledge only extends to 20
percent of the fish provided to the public.
"For the most part,our fishery management has been
abysmal," Sutton said.
While acknowledging the validity of this statement.
Rice added, "the system that is in the U.S. is better than
what is in the [rest of the] world."
Essentially, the government cannot ensure sustain
able seafood practices on its own. This, in turn, suggests
the need for commercial incentives to change the way
seafood is supplied and harvested. And, consumer deci
sions seem to play a key role in actualizing this change.
A take-away point from the lecture series empha
sized how people's choices have repercussions all the
way up the supply chain.This requires consumers to sac
rifice appetizing, endangered seafood. It also means that
industries and the public alike need to be well-informed
about the pros and cons of popular practices such as
aquaculture and fish farming.
"Sustainability has really become a watchword for
Stanford Dining and for the food industry in general,"
Sutton said. "People are starting to think about where
their food is coming from."
For Sutton, knowing where the seafood we consume
originates is important because "we have a pretty inti
mate relationship with our food — it goes into our bod
ies."
The Sustainable Seafood Lecture Series is a manifes
tation of this concern.
"By engaging with students about why the food we
eat matters and how each of us can make sustainable
dining choices that are also delicious, we turn the fruits
of our research into a great evening." Caldwell wrote in
a press release.
