## Editorial Promotion, scheduling of Big Game tradition disappointing 
### 
Big Game is arguably the most hal
lowed tradition at Stanford.This year,
however, the University has failed to
give that tradition its dues by informing the
student body of consequential information.
The 111 th Big Game played between the
Cardinal and the Berkeley Golden Bears
will occur on Nov. 22 at Berkeley's Memori
al Stadium. Big Game is historically each
team's last game, but this year. Cai plays
Washington two weeks later.This, however,
is not the biggest scheduling error. Rather,
for Stanford students, this year's Big Game
falls on the first Saturday of Thanksgiving
break.
While the editorial board recognizes the
inherent difficulty of scheduling on the part
of the Pac-10/NCAA, the leagues and the
teams, we balk at the notion that a more suit
able date, even years in advance, could not
have been picked.Though Berkeley is still in
school next week. Stanford should have
fought for a date when more students would
be in town so as to avoid a significantly di
minished Big Game fan base.
Other aspects of Big Game planning
were similarly inadequate. The first email
Stanford Athletics sent regarding Big Game
on Oct. 15 simply advertised a rally bus and
did not warn students that Big Game falls on
Thanksgiving break. It did not even mention
that the game is at Cal. Only on Oct. 29, just
three weeks away from the contest, did the
Athletics Department send an email to stu
dents regarding "Cardinal Loyalty Points,"
explaining how students' admission to the
Big Game and the Nov. 15 USC game was
contingent upon these points. While we ap
preciate that admission to Stanford football
games is free unlike at other schools, stu
dents should have been notified earlier re

garding the policy
In addition, there was a notable absence
of communication to the upperclassmen re
garding the date. Small cards were sent to
the members of the freshmen class at the be
ginning of the school year, an effort we ap
plaud. Unfortunately, no such action was
taken to notify the rest of the school. Many
students booked their non-refundable plane
tickets to go home for Thanksgiving several
months in advance, only to later find out via
word-of-mouth that they would miss the
chance to attend Big Game.
Though effectively reaching out to the
school's entire student body is often a chal
lenge. an event of this magnitude warrants
particular note. Advertisement to the fresh
man class is always vital to the perpetuation
of long-tenured institutions, but simply fail
ing to contact roughly 75 percent of the un
dergraduate body is unacceptable.
As seen by a recent spate of emails, con
tacting all students is not that difficult: Ath
letics should be more proactive about its im
pressive email list-serve. The department
should also better coordinate with student
organizations that support fan sprit in order
to convey the information about future Big
Games and major sporting events. And
while the points system is a valuable tool to
foster fan enthusiasm, students should be
made aware of the system more than a few
weeks before the biggest game of the year.
The editorial board is looking forward to
Stanford's imminent victory over the Gold
en Bears. We simply wish there had been
greater outreach to the student body so
Stanford students could witness the rout in
person, and we hope that through better
communication, even more students are
able watch us quash Cal next year.
