## Choosing the right cabinet

weird to say that. It really does.)
transition, which is probably the most
watched in the past 25 years or so. We've
read — or at least 1 have — story after story
in the media reminding us of Bill Clinton's
supposedly disastrous transition, and how
Obama should avoid his mistakes. Obama.
who does seem to be moving quite a bit
faster than Clinton, selected his Chief of
Staff quickly. Rahm Emanuel, a centrist
once associated with the Democratic Lead
ership Council (DI.C) and serious policy
wonk,is an excellent choice for the job. I le's
also filled several other staff positions with
loyalists like Valerie Jarrett. Despite leftist
criticism. Emanuel's selection indicates
Obama's desire to govern from the center.
However, he has yet. as of this writing, to
make any cabinet selections. It does seem
that he will choose Hillary Clinton of all
people to be Secretary of State, but that is
not certain. While there is considerable de
bate over how much influence cabinet sec
retaries really have, they will become the
most visible faces of the Obama Adminis
tration and represent his policies both do
mestically and abroad. Choosing the right
group will be crucial.as Obama wants to get
moving quickly on major policy initiatives.
After more than three years of lethargy and
inaction from the Bush administration,
picking dynamic secretaries will jump-start
new policies.
The choice recently garnering the most
chatter is the likely prospect of Clinton as
Secretary of State. It seems, at first glance,
like a stunning choice. Senator Clinton's
strengths during the campaign tended to be
on the domestic-policy side: healthcare and
jobs. She's also considerably more hawkish
than Obama, adopting a firm stance regard
ing Iran, while being more outspoken in
support of Israel. It would be an interesting
selection in that while Clinton campaigned
for Obama and gave a great speech at the
Democratic National Convention, they
were never particularly close and had a
long, acrimonious campaign. Would she be
overshadowed by Vice President-elect Joe
Biden's foreign policy experience? How
much latitude would she have when meet
ing with foreign leaders?
Obama also has an interesting decision
to make regarding Secretary of Defense.
Current Defense Secretary Bob Gates has
been, by most accounts, doing a fantastic
job. He's been a strong advocate for more

money for the State Department and For
eign Service (maybe the only time we will
ever see the Pentagon actually wanting to
give another agency more money). Gates
has also worked to de-politicize the Penta
gon after six years of Donald Rumsfeld. It
seems likely that he will stay on for at least
a year, which would he unprecedented.
While cabinet secretaries occasionally do
survive presidential transitions, the Secre
tary of Defense never has. Gates, never a
registered Republican, has done more than
enough to stay on. Obania would be wise to
ask him to stay.
The biggest choice Obama has to make is
Secretary of the Treasury. A lot of names are
being bandied about, but the most intrigu
ing is Larry Summers.Treasury Secretary in
Bill C linton's second term and former pres
ident of I larvard. Summers has a blazing in
tellect, but his comments on gender and in
telligence. which were somewhat misinter
preted. have earned him many enemies. Se
lecting him would send a signal to investors
and foreign leaders that Obama is serious
about economic policy and does not intend
to engage in ideological reform. Summers is
pro-free trade: he would help reassure East
and South Asian allies that Obama does not
intend to be a protectionist.
We will already know a lot about the
Obama Administration and what policies it
will pursue before Inauguration Day.
Obama has shown a remarkable interest in
hearing opposing points of view from peo
ple close to him: this is an extremely rare
trait in a president. Picking Sen. Clinton is
the first big step in that direction. If his cab
inet reflects that attitude, then we'll be one
step closer to having the kind of presidency
that has been so lacking in the past eight
years, reaffirming why we voted for Obama
in the first place.
