# Executive Experiences
## Who let the dogs out? 
### 
One of the greatest things about the
Stanford experience is how it all but
induces a total regression to child
hood. You thought you were so poised and
mature when you first showed up here, and
then next thing you know you're dressed up
in a dinosaur costume doing the Macarena in
a bounce house, while your 40 new best
friends serenade you on kazoos.
1 think that's great. Darn right we should
appreciate Slip'n'Slides. pleather and Gush
ers in the faces of all those people who try to
act adult and don't know what they're miss
ing. Rag on these new campus party policies
as I might. I have infinite faith in the ingenu
ity and ridiculousness of this student body
to triumph over any attempt to make us
overly solemn. Nay, enemies of fun, we are
wearing face paint, and we shall not wash it
off.
These impulses to return to the child
hood I never had feel good to me. and I em
brace them. (I say "the childhood I never
had" because I spent most of my preschool
years crying in a corner because I was afraid
of noise and clowns, and my early elemen
tary school years dancing around a shrine I
had made to Athena — the goddess of wis
dom— in my backyard. Gosh. I sure am
glad 1 just confessed that in print.)
There is, however, one college-generated
childlike urge that I simply don't know how
to deal with. You may have noticed that we
aren't allowed to have pets on campus, ex
cept fish. And unless your idea of a pet is
some crappy floating insect that gurgles
around a tiny plastic castle before choking
on its own stupidity and decomposing in
your water filter, that's no pet.
I've tried having fish as pets, but no mat
ter how much love and care I give, I always
seem to fall short. One minute I'm cleaning
Thor Thundergod's tank while serenading
him with "Yellow Submarine," and the next
minute. I'm standing over my toilet, dressed
in black and singing "The Wind Beneath My
Wings" as I cradle his lifeless, Kleenex-em
balmed body.
No, friends, fish just won't cut it. I long,
rather, for the company of dogs, the true

American pets. 1 miss their funny dog harks
and their silly dog tails and the quirky dog
stuff they do that's endearingly annoying,
like chasing cars and eating Ping-Pong halls
and peeing on stuff as a display of affection.
I miss the fact that they will offer you undy
ing loyalty and companionship in exchange
for a squeaky toy shaped like a weasel.
And because there are only so many
times per month that I can run home and see
my own dog before my parents start to raise
their eyebrows. I am left with no other re
course than stalking the dogs of random
passersby. I can't help it.The mere sight of a
potential new furry friend will reduce me
into a cooing, drooling and distinctly creepy
parody of all things female.
I want to pet dogs,and not even I can stop
myself.
Like any good addict, I've cultivated a
strategy to help foster my mania, which I
would like to share with those of you who
are similarly afflicted.
The secret is to display your intentions
openly as you approach. "Ooh. what a beau
tiful dog," is a great opener — classic,
straightforward and irreproachable. Now
that you've flattered the dog's owner into
temporary acquiescence, you can follow up
with a question like "What's her name?" or
"I low old is she?"
The time that the owner takes to answer
is a great opportunity to si/e up the actual
dog. Some dogs, like some people, are not
sharing types and just don't want to be
touched. If the dog is wearing a sweater, for
instance, exercise caution — odds are
they've already been through enough trau
ma that day and don't need you making
things more difficult.
On a more abstract but equally impor
tant level, consider the dog's facial expres
sion and body language. If the dog bears an
uncanny resemblance to that shady kid in
your PWR section who spends the entire
class scowling and coloring his notebook
paper black, it's probably a no-go.
That said, if the owner is willing and
eager to brag about her sweet baby C'ock
apoo or Affenpinscher or Animal Rescue

I am left with no other
recourse than stalking the
dogs of random passersby.

Mult Special, like my own darling puppy,
and the dog seems relaxed and friendly, then
this is your moment to murmur some non
sensical combination of syllables and give it
a nice scratch behind the ears (the dog, I
mean — but maybe the owner, too. You
never know).The owner feels validated, the
dog feels contented and you have just taken
a hit of cuteness to help get you through the
day. Everyone wins.
Ambushing unsuspecting pedestrians
may not be your thing. But as we grind
through the last week of classes before
Thanksgiving, I hope you take ample oppor
tunity to indulge your own little quirks and
whims, whatever they may be. As Oscar
Wilde said,"Life is too important to take se
riously," by which I am sure he meant "L.et's
all go fountain hopping."
Release your inner child, or, failing that,
your inner weirdo. It just feels so good. Be
sides, once you've donned the dino costume,
it's a slippery slope from there.

Jenna will also offer yon undying companion
ship and affection in exchange for a squeaky toy
shaped like a weasel. Additionally, if you would
like to see her wrestle Kevin Webb, come to

times per month that I can run home and see
my own dog before my parents start to raise
their eyebrows. I am left with no other re
course than stalking the dogs of random
passersby. I can't help it.The mere sight of a
potential new furry friend will reduce me
into a cooing, drooling and distinctly creepy
parody of all things female.
I want to pet dogs,and not even I can stop
myself.
Like any good addict, I've cultivated a
strategy to help foster my mania, which I
would like to share with those of you who
are similarly afflicted.
The secret is to display your intentions
openly as you approach. "Ooh. what a beau
tiful dog," is a great opener — classic,
straightforward and irreproachable. Now
that you've flattered the dog's owner into
temporary acquiescence, you can follow up
with a question like "What's her name?" or
"I low old is she?"
The time that the owner takes to answer
is a great opportunity to si/e up the actual
dog. Some dogs, like some people, are not
sharing types and just don't want to be
touched. If the dog is wearing a sweater, for
instance, exercise caution — odds are
they've already been through enough trau
ma that day and don't need you making
things more difficult.
On a more abstract but equally impor
tant level, consider the dog's facial expres
sion and body language. If the dog bears an
uncanny resemblance to that shady kid in
your PWR section who spends the entire
class scowling and coloring his notebook
paper black, it's probably a no-go.
That said, if the owner is willing and
eager to brag about her sweet baby C'ock
apoo or Affenpinscher or Animal Rescue

I am left with no other
recourse than stalking the
dogs of random passersby.

Mult Special, like my own darling puppy,
and the dog seems relaxed and friendly, then
this is your moment to murmur some non
sensical combination of syllables and give it
a nice scratch behind the ears (the dog, I
mean — but maybe the owner, too. You
never know).The owner feels validated, the
dog feels contented and you have just taken
a hit of cuteness to help get you through the
day. Everyone wins.
Ambushing unsuspecting pedestrians
may not be your thing. But as we grind
through the last week of classes before
Thanksgiving, I hope you take ample oppor
tunity to indulge your own little quirks and
whims, whatever they may be. As Oscar
Wilde said,"Life is too important to take se
riously," by which I am sure he meant "L.et's
all go fountain hopping."
Release your inner child, or, failing that,
your inner weirdo. It just feels so good. Be
sides, once you've donned the dino costume,
it's a slippery slope from there.

ship and affection in exchange for a squeaky toy
