## CARD SMASHES BEARS Women inch closer to Pac-10 Title 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For the Stanford women's volleyball team,
revenge could not have come ai a better time.
Nor could it have come against a better team.
The N0.2 Cardinal avenged its Oct. 19 loss
on Friday night by sweeping N0.7 Cal (25-23,
25-16,25-20) in front of a crowd of nearly four
thousand in Berkeley, Calif. The win moved
Stanford within two wins of at least a share of
the Pacific-10 Conference regular season title.
The match was expected to be a slugfest:
Stanford was looking to get back at the Bears,
while the Cal squad looked to climb in the Pa
cific-l() Conference standings by knocking off
the Cardinal. Head coach John Dunning did
what he could to keep his team focused and
prepared while approaching the match like
any other conference battle.
"I don't look at games for revenge," Dun
ning said. "1 enjoy the rivalry with Cal. I like
the fun that is built around it.The huge crowd
was great for the athletes, and great for the
game. This spoi l deserves that kind of atten
tion."
Stanford's Ail-American hitters did not
disappoint the Cardinal faithful who made the
trip across the Bay. Seniors Cynthia Barboza
and Foluke Akinradewo continued their out
standing play as they accounted for 25 of the
team's kills. Sophomore Alix klineman also
chipped in. quietly collecting 11 kills. Their
success was due in large part to the play of
Cassidy Lichtman, who finished the match
with 38 assists.
But il was the Cardinal's defense — led bv
Akinradewo's six blocks — that dominated
most of the match. Cal hitter liana Cutura,
who torched Stanford with 25 kills in the
match earlier this year at Maples Pavilion, was
held to only nine kills on the night. Dunning
credited his defenders for keeping her in their
sights and preventing another offensive explo
sion.
"We keyed on [Cutura], were really ready
and knew what we needed to do," Dunning
said."lt's very hard to hold her and by doingso
means we did a great job on her. 1 think our de
fense should feel proud of its effort."
The first set looked like it would be a cake
walk for the Cardinal, as it marched out to an
8-3 lead. But as Stanford tried to finish the
match with a 24-16 lead, the Cardinal suffered
a minor collapse. Cal. behind Cutura's serve,
scored seven unanswered points to narrow
Stanford's lead to one. The Cardinal women

Golden Bears, sweeping the Cal women this time
around behind terrific matches from seniors Cynthia Bar

won the decisive point — but not before some
of their momentum was lost.
"We might have relaxed a little." Dunning
said of his team's near collapse in the first set.
"Cutura serves a really tough jump serve. It is
not something we are [usually] prone to. and
we were able to regain our composure and
keep the pressure on."
The Bears proved no match lor Klineman
in the second set. The sophomore slammed
four early kills to catapult Stanford lo a 5-2
lead.and the Cardinal hit .3N7 in the second set
while holding Cal to a mere .125. Erin Waller
served to finish the set, notching five consecu
tive points.
Stanford took the third set in similar lash
ion, once again marching out to an early lead.
Cassidv Lichtman earned her team-leading
19th ace of the year, and Stanford outhit Cal
.286 to . IKB on its way to another sweep.
The common denominator in all three sets
was Stanford's ability to pressure the Bears
early in the set. The Cardinal jumped out to an
early lead in each game and Cal did little to
slow Stanford's offensive onslaught. Berkeley
faced an uphill battle throughout the night.
Fast starts have been part of Stanford's
game-plan all year — just one of many rea
sons for the team's incredible season.
"We've played a really tough schedule this
year." Dunning said. "Our team has gotten
used to coming in ready to play. I think that

they are excited and want to reach for their
goals."
Although Friday's win was significant,
there is no rest for the Cardinal. M takes on a
pair ol talented and highly ranked Pac-1()
teams this weekend as No. 10 USC and No. 9
UCLA visit the Farm.The team's final homes
tand will also bring senior night, which will
commemorate the end of the legendary ca
reers of Cynthia Barboza and Foluke Akin
radewo in Maples Pavilion — as well as those

of their fellow seniors.
"Senior night is big and important to the
players," Dunning said."lt's a chance to recog
nize and honor them. Aside from being their
hist game, there's certainly a little motivation
in playing [two rivals] in USC and UCLA."

GAME NOTES: The No. 2 Stanford women go* their re
venge for an October upset suffered at the hands of the
Golden Bears, sweeping the Cal women this time
around behind terrific matches from seniors Cynthia Bar
boza and Foluke Akinradewo and sophomore Alix Kline
man. All three tallied double-digit kill totals on the night.
Next up, the Cardinal will travel to Southern California
for games Friday and Saturday against No. 10 USC and
No. 9 UCLA, respectively.

won the decisive point — but not before some
of their momentum was lost.
"We might have relaxed a little." Dunning
said of his team's near collapse in the first set.
"Cutura serves a really tough jump serve. It is
not something we are [usually] prone to. and
we were able to regain our composure and
keep the pressure on."
The Bears proved no match lor Klineman
in the second set. The sophomore slammed
four early kills to catapult Stanford lo a 5-2
lead.and the Cardinal hit .3N7 in the second set
while holding Cal to a mere .125. Erin Waller
served to finish the set, notching five consecu
tive points.
Stanford took the third set in similar lash
ion, once again marching out to an early lead.
Cassidv Lichtman earned her team-leading
19th ace of the year, and Stanford outhit Cal
.286 to . IKB on its way to another sweep.
The common denominator in all three sets
was Stanford's ability to pressure the Bears
early in the set. The Cardinal jumped out to an
early lead in each game and Cal did little to
slow Stanford's offensive onslaught. Berkeley
faced an uphill battle throughout the night.
Fast starts have been part of Stanford's
game-plan all year — just one of many rea
sons for the team's incredible season.
"We've played a really tough schedule this
year." Dunning said. "Our team has gotten
used to coming in ready to play. I think that

they are excited and want to reach for their
goals."
Although Friday's win was significant,
there is no rest for the Cardinal. M takes on a
pair ol talented and highly ranked Pac-1()
teams this weekend as No. 10 USC and No. 9
UCLA visit the Farm.The team's final homes
tand will also bring senior night, which will
commemorate the end of the legendary ca
reers of Cynthia Barboza and Foluke Akin
radewo in Maples Pavilion — as well as those

of their fellow seniors.
"Senior night is big and important to the
players," Dunning said."lt's a chance to recog
nize and honor them. Aside from being their
hist game, there's certainly a little motivation
in playing [two rivals] in USC and UCLA."
Hie Cardinal will take on USC on Friday
and UCLA on Saturday.
