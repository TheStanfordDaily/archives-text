# Barack to BCS: time for change
## 
### 
A 6O Minutes interview with
Barack Obama aired Sunday
night.
Wait, don't go! Ihis isn't a political
column. I promise.
Alter discussing more pertinent is
sues. Steve Kroft asked the President-
Elect, "As president of the United
States, what can you do. or what do
you plan to do, about getting a college
football playoff for the national cham
pionship?"
Obama's eyes lit up — he was
quick to respond in favor of a playoff
system.
"Eight teams.That would be three
rounds, to determine a national cham
pion. It would add three extra weeks
to the season. You could trim back on
the regular season. I don't know any
serious fan of college football who has
disagreed with me on this." he said.
"So, I'm gonna throw mv weight
around a little bit. I think it's the right
thing to do."
Obama was grinning — and
Michelle was laughing — throughout
his response, which calls into question
whether or not he was being facetious,
especially about the last part.
Nevertheless, it's time to heed
Obama's call. The IK'S needs to
change.
In January, I advocated for main
taining the current system, but drop
ping the conference affiliations for
each bowl. My reasoning was based on
the simple fact that a playoff system
would never be implemented.
I'm not sure if the odds of a change
happening are any greater now than
they were last season.The BCS Presi
dential Oversight Committee quickly
rejected Obama's proposed solution:

Between the lines

"We do not believe a playoff would be
in the best interest of the sport, the
student-athletes or our many other
constituencies," Oregon President
David Frohnmayer, the Chair of the
committee said.
Let's just say I doubt a switch is
happening at any point in the near fu
ture. Frohnmayer's explanation,
though, is tlawed.
Let's examine a hypothetical play
off system. Eight teams, with the No. 1
squad playing No. 8. No. 2 playing No.
7. and so on. The playoffs would last
three weeks, and in the end. we'd be
left with our champion. [Tie BCS
doesn't need to be eliminated — in
stead of the Coaches' or AP poll, it
could be the rankings system that de
termines the top eight teams — but it
shouldn't determine the title game.
It's that simple. Eliminate the
"BCS conference" status and manda
tory berths for the champions of those
six conferences. If Penn State wins the
Big 10, but is ranked ninth, sorry, but
that conference will not be represent
ed in the playoffs. I have little sympa
thy for a team that just misses the cut.
In the meantime, we won't be
faced with a situation like we will be
this year in which one of the top Big 12
teams will be left out of a BCS bowl
because of limits on the number of
teams per conference.
Now back to Frohnmayer's state
ment: is this in the "best interest of the
sport"? Absolutely it is.
The intrigue surrounding a playoff
system is dramatically more interest
ing than simply waiting through De
cember until the title game rolls
around. Why is March Madness so
beloved by sports fans everywhere?
Because teams like George Mason
have a shot at history and because
there are no guarantees for even the
top schools. It's a trial by fire — a real
life Survivor. At the end of the day.
there would be no controversy over
who was shunned from the title game
and who was not. since the winner
would have had to go through three
tough opponents to get there.

Is this in the "best interest of the
student-athletes?" Maybe — but it's
no worse than the current system.
I hate the argument that a playoff
format would take away from ath
letes' studies. Excuse my elitism, but
it's well-known that many of the
perennial college powerhouses are
NFL factories where the football
players just happen to be students as
well. And even for true student-ath
letes, the season is not being extended
infinitely — it's two extra weeks of
football, at the most. That's not very
long when you consider that the sea
son begins in August and camp begins
a month before that. What will an
extra 14 days do to seriously hurt a
student-athlete's academic standing?
In the meantime, they get to play a few
more weeks of football — a game
they (should) love — with the chance
of improving, making a national name
for themselves, and so on.
And finally, is this in the "best in
terest of our other constituencies"?
At least in part.yes.
Let's assume he's talking about
fans and money. To the first point,
Obama is right — there isn't a college
football fan I know who doesn't want
to see a playoff system implemented.
To the second, let's extrapolate a little
bit with some numbers. Sure, the con
ferences would lose out on the guar
anteed cash that comes to them by
way of their current bowl ties. But. you
could have a system where the money
is pooled and distributed accordingly.
The revenue from seven games would
surely be greater than the profits from
the five current games. And. as a result
of the first point (more intrigue), rat
ings are bound to maintain (if not sur
pass) their current height, too.
We are headed towards yet anoth
er winter of discontent. Of Texas.
Texas Tech and Oklahoma steaming
towards a game only two can play. At
least one school is going to be furious
in a few weeks. And that's likely just
the beginning.
The system is broken. It's time for
a fix.

Wynilam Makowsky hopes that /'resi
dent-F~ led Obama will be as wise in
making real decisions as lie is about col
lege football. Contact him at
