# Barack to BCS: time for change
## 
### 
A 6O Minutes interview with
Barack Obama aired Sunday
night.
Wait, don't go! Ihis isn't a political
column. I promise.
Alter discussing more pertinent is
sues. Steve Kroft asked the President-
Elect, "As president of the United
States, what can you do. or what do
you plan to do, about getting a college
football playoff for the national cham
pionship?"
Obama's eyes lit up — he was
quick to respond in favor of a playoff
system.
"Eight teams.That would be three
rounds, to determine a national cham
pion. It would add three extra weeks
to the season. You could trim back on
the regular season. I don't know any
serious fan of college football who has
disagreed with me on this." he said.
"So, I'm gonna throw mv weight
around a little bit. I think it's the right
thing to do."
Obama was grinning — and
Michelle was laughing — throughout
his response, which calls into question
whether or not he was being facetious,
especially about the last part.
Nevertheless, it's time to heed
Obama's call. The IK'S needs to
change.
In January, I advocated for main
taining the current system, but drop
ping the conference affiliations for
each bowl. My reasoning was based on
the simple fact that a playoff system
would never be implemented.
I'm not sure if the odds of a change
happening are any greater now than
they were last season.The BCS Presi
dential Oversight Committee quickly
rejected Obama's proposed solution:
