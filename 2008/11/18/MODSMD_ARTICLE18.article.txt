Stanford men's soccer completed its season Saturday
with a bitter 1-0 road loss to Cal. It was a fitting, if de
pressing. finish to a season that has been plagued by in
juries. hard luck and close finishes for the Cardinal.
In dropping the game to Cal (10-3-5,5-2-3 Pacific-10
Conference). Stanford (4-11-3, 2-6-2) suffered its ninth
one-goal loss this year, the highest single season total for
the program since 1971.
Stanford was once again kept in the game by its stingy
defense,but the lack of offensive production doomed the
team both for the game and the season. Cal scored its
lone goal in the 4Mth minute as Jacob Wilson rocketed a
10-yard rebound into the back of the net. Stanford failed
to put much pressure on the Bears.as the Cardinal could
n't come up with any dangerous scoring chances all game.

On the season Stanford only allowed a remarkable 21
goals in IK games, a very respectable 1.17 goals against
average. The problem, however, was that the team only
scored 14 goals in those same IS games. I he ( ardinal of
fense got valuable contributions from a number of
sources as 10 different players scored goals. Sophomore
Hobby Warshaw and Senior Tom Montgomery both fin
ished with three goals on the year, tying them for the
scoring title on the team.
It took a solid effort from the Cal squad, which is
ranked No. 12 in the nation according to the coaches'
poll, to beat Stanford. The Golden Hears' coach Kevin
Grimes praised the Cardinal after the game.
"Stanford is a very difficult opponent for any team."
he told GoStanford.com. "And today they proved why
we have to have the best of all our players, including our
seniors, in order to get the win."
After the loss, Stanford head coach Bret Simon stuck
to the message he has given his players throughout the
year: keep working hard and the wins will follow. But he
couldn't hide the disappointment he felt after yet anoth-

Junior goalkeeper John Moore and the Stanford defense continued their outstanding play, holding Cal to just one
goal on Saturday. Next year, the Cardinal will look to improve its offense that produced only 14 goals all season.
er game slipped away from his team
due to a laek of offensive production.
"The guys played valiantly," Stan
ford head coach Bret Simon said in
an interview with GoStanford.com.
"Our Junior captain. Michael Strick
land. played on an injury. It was a
close one. Unfortunately, it followed
the script of our earlier games."
That script is a painful read. Satur
day was the l()th time Stanford has
been shut out in 18 games. Only three
times this year did the Card score
more than one goal, and just once did
they score more than two goals. The
script also had Stanford fall 1-0 to

archnemesis Cal for the second time
this year. ITie first contest was per
haps the most painful loss of 2(X)8. as
Stanford suffered one of its two over
time defeats at home.
But there were also plenty of
bright spots for the 2(X)8 Cardinal
squad. Stanford finished the season
with a bit of momentum, putting to
gether a respectable 1-1-1 record in
their final three contests â€” including
a 4-2 route of Washington. Its nine
one-goal losses show that Stanford
was highly competitive. As the sea
son progressed and a number of ath
letes got injured, younger players
were asked to fill in and did so ad
mirably. The youth movement in
Stanford soccer is clearly well under
way and holds great promise for the
future.
Next comes spring training and

the class of 2013. Stanford will be los
ing a very deep and talented senior
class, but senior captains T.J Novak
and Evan Morgan have applied for
an extra year of eligibility due to in
juries sustained this season. Both
players could have a tremendous im
pact on Stanford's offense if they are
allowed to return to the Farm next
year. Morgan was the team's leading
scorer in the last full season he
played, tallying five goals in the 2006
season.
2008 was a year of close calls and
bad bounces for the Stanford men's
soccer team. The returning players
will resume workouts after a few
weeks of rest, eager to right the ship in
2(X)9.
