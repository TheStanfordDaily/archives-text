In one of the most anticipated
matches in NCAA men's water polo
this season. No. 3 Stanford lost to No. 1
USC 6-5 on Saturday at Avery Aquat
ic Center.The Cardinal jumped out to
a 4-1 lead but couldn't hold off a
strong second half comeback by the
Trojans. Stanford is now 21-4 overall,
and 5-2 in Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation play this season.
The loss comes in the wake of a
huge upset suffered at the hands of
No. 7 UC-Santa Barbara. The Gau
chos beat Stanford in a 5-4 contest
last weekend. The Cardinal needs to
finish near the top of the MPSF
standings to be considered for a spot
in the NCAA Tournament. Only four
teams are invited to the Tournament
— the MPSF champion automatical
ly qualifies and there is one at-large
bid. The NCAA Tournament will be
held at the Avery Aquatic Center on
December 6 and 7 this year.
Last season. Stanford failed to
qualify after losing out to California
and USC in the MPSF rankings.The
Cardinal next travels to Berkeley.
Calif, to face Cal on Nov. 22. It will be
the team's final regular season con
test and its last chance to improve its
conference record.
Playing in a jam-packed Avery
Aquatic Center on Saturday after
noon, the Card got off to a fast start in
the first quarter as junior Janson
Wigo — the team's leading scorer —
notched the first two goals of the
game. Wigo's first goal came on a six
on-five power play with four minutes
left in the first; the second was a per
fectly placed five-meter penalty shot,
coming off a USC penalty for bruis
ing senior two-meter man Will Hin
dle-Katel.
With the Cardinal up two goals to
none, USC's Matt Sagehorn an
swered by putting a shot past Stan

ford junior goalkeeper Jimmie Sand
man. Not to be outdone, though, jun
ior driver Sage Wright scored on a
volley to the left corner as the first
quarter came to an end.The Cardinal
was looking confident, despite a
number of dangerous opportunities
and narrow misses by the Trojans. Six
USC shots hit the goal post and
bounced out in the first half.
Stanford benefited from a few
close calls in the first half, but
pestered the USC offense with a con
trolled yet aggressive defense — with
head coach John Vargas frequently
directing the action from the side
lines. Stanford effectively rotated
players guarding USC star senior
J.W. Krumpholz.The Trojans' leading
scorer and 2008 US Olympian was
held scoreless on the day.
USC tied the game in the second
quarter with goals from Shea Buckn
er and Peter Kurzeka. Stanford re
sponded with another score from
Janson Wigo. and the teams went into
halftime locked in a 4-3 struggle.
Both teams were very aggressive
throughout the match,and each drew
a number of warning whistles from
the referees.
But the No.l team in the nation
could not be contained in the second
half, and USC eventually established
some offensive rhythm despite the
Cardinal's typically suffocating de
fense. The Trojans' Justin Rappel
scored the only goal in the third quar
ter, tying the game at four heading
into the final period.
In the final period. Rappel scored
again at the 2:43 mark to give the Tro
jans their first lead of the day, 5-4.
Kurkeza added the game-winning
goal at 1:28 to put USC up 6-4.
Down but not out. Stanford im
mediately responded with a clutch
goal from Sage Wright with just 1:12
left to play. Needing just one score to
tie.the Cardinal had two opportuni
ties to send the name to overtime: the

11/15 USC L, 6-5
UP NEXT
CALIFORNIA MfS
11/22 Berkeley, Calif.
GAME NOTES: The Cardinal men's water polo
team dropped a close contest to No. 1 USC
at Avery Aquatic Center on Saturday. Stan
ford could not hold on to leads of 3-1 and
4-3, as the Trojan offense proved too tough
to contain for four quarters. The Cardinal-is
0-3 against USC this season, although the
last two games were decided by only one
goal each.

first shot — with 48 seconds remain
ing — was blocked by a USC defend
er and the visitors recovered the
loose ball.
But while attempting to run down
the clock, the Trojans committed an
inexplicable mistake and were called
for an offensive foul. With 18 seconds
left on the clock. Stanford had anoth
er fine scoring chance with a power
play resulting from a USC ejection.
The final shot was on target, but
USC's Joel Dennerley saved the day
with a fine block.
Defense was the story of the game.
Dennerley finished with 12 saves on
the day while Sandman stopped six
Trojan shots. Each team held the op
ponent to well below its average
goals per game mark of 12 and 11
scores for USC and Stanford, respec
tively. Janson Wigo finished with
three goals, while Sage Wright scored
two.
The Trojans' late offensive surge
and Dennerley's clutch defense in the
closing minutes made the difference
in a match between the nation's two
best teams.
USC completes its first perfect
regular season with a record of 24-0.
Southern California is the first team
to do so since Cal went 31-0 in 1992.
Stanford will play its final regular
season match against No. 4 Cal at
Berkeley on Saturday, Nov. 22.
