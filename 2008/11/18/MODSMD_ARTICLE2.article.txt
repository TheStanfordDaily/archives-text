# Big Games 2008
## Students lament Game publicity Students note lesser presence; Athletics cites no change 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
With Big Game just days away, this
week promises to he filled with time
honored traditions such as yesterday's
Bearial at the Claw. Gaieties and the
campus-wide rally for the 111 th battle
between the Cardinal and the Golden
Bears. But this year, students have
reported seeing less publicity for the
game itself.
"Honestly, I've never seen any
emails from Big Game this year," said
Tenzin ChagzoetsangiO. "I don't think
the University has done a very good
job of publicizing it."
Other students feel like the prob
lem with Big Game this year is its
unfortunate timing. Many students
will be home for Thanksgiving before
kickoff.
i didn't know when Big Game
would happen until this weekend." said
Stephen Brown Ml. "Last year, there
were people everywhere talking about
it. I got a lot more emails about it. 1
think the fact that the game is on
Thanksgiving break is a reason [for
that], and also it's not at Stanford this

year,so not as many people will be able
to go."
Assistant Athletic Director for
Marketing Bob Carruesco told The
Daily that preparations for this Big
Ciame have been the same as in previ
ous years.
"I don't think there's anything dif
ferent from what we normally do," he
said. "There have been emails to Red
Zone, and there will be ads in the news
paper [this] week. I don't know what
accounts for that perception."
"Every week, there's an email that
goes out that alerts people on how
many points they have." Carruesco
added. "Whenever they come to a
game, they're entered into a Red Zone
database."
The Stanford athletic department
sent emails to Red Zone members four
times this year to remind students
about home games, and sent another
on Sunday about Big Game. Two more
emails about Big Game will be sent out
this week, making a total of seven
emails from the athletic department
this year.

In yesterday's Bearial at the Claw, an executioner impales a stuffed bear symbolizing Cal's
mascot, Oski the Golden Bear. The annual ritual opens the festivities of Big Game Week.
