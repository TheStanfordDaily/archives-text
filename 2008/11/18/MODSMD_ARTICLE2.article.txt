# Big Games 2008
## Students lament Game publicity Students note lesser presence; Athletics cites no change 
### MIKE DING STAFF WRITER 
With Big Game just days away, this
week promises to he filled with time
honored traditions such as yesterday's
Bearial at the Claw. Gaieties and the
campus-wide rally for the 111 th battle
between the Cardinal and the Golden
Bears. But this year, students have
reported seeing less publicity for the
game itself.
"Honestly, I've never seen any
emails from Big Game this year," said
Tenzin ChagzoetsangiO. "I don't think
the University has done a very good
job of publicizing it."
Other students feel like the prob
lem with Big Game this year is its
unfortunate timing. Many students
will be home for Thanksgiving before
kickoff.
i didn't know when Big Game
would happen until this weekend." said
Stephen Brown Ml. "Last year, there
were people everywhere talking about
it. I got a lot more emails about it. 1
think the fact that the game is on
Thanksgiving break is a reason [for
that], and also it's not at Stanford this

year,so not as many people will be able
to go."
Assistant Athletic Director for
Marketing Bob Carruesco told The
Daily that preparations for this Big
Ciame have been the same as in previ
ous years.
"I don't think there's anything dif
ferent from what we normally do," he
said. "There have been emails to Red
Zone, and there will be ads in the news
paper [this] week. I don't know what
accounts for that perception."
"Every week, there's an email that
goes out that alerts people on how
many points they have." Carruesco
added. "Whenever they come to a
game, they're entered into a Red Zone
database."
The Stanford athletic department
sent emails to Red Zone members four
times this year to remind students
about home games, and sent another
on Sunday about Big Game. Two more
emails about Big Game will be sent out
this week, making a total of seven
emails from the athletic department
this year.

In yesterday's Bearial at the Claw, an executioner impales a stuffed bear symbolizing Cal's
mascot, Oski the Golden Bear. The annual ritual opens the festivities of Big Game Week.
The Red Zone email goes out to
the entire freshman class, and. accord
ing to Senior Associate Athletic
Director Chris Hutchins. all freshmen
are automatically signed up for Red
Zone upon entering Stanford.
Upperclassmen. however, can only
receive the emails if they sign up for
Red Zone or give their email address
es to the database. After their fresh
man year. Stanford students are given
a choice of signing up for Red Zone by
themselves or taking their email
addresses off the list.
"We are able to work with the
freshman dean and to work with New
Student Orientation." Hutchins said.
"(That way], freshmen on campus can
be educated about all opportunities,
both academic and athletic."
Hutchins said the perceived
decrease in publicity for Big Game
may be because this year it will be
played at Cal. rather than Stanford.
"It's inherently going to be such
that we'll be marketing all home
games very aggressively" she said.
"When it's away, again, our marketing
is done in a sense of being able to offer
our fans the opportunity to purchase
away games, but our primary resources
and dollars [are used for] really push
ing for scheduled home games."
Hutchins said the majority of
efforts to reach out to the student

body, whether through the Big Game
bus rally or any of the Big Game activ
ities scheduled throughout this week,
are led and generated by the ASSU
and student leaders.
"The Axe [Committee]. ASSU and
all the other student group leaders are
responsible for a lot of the marketing
plans and initiatives," she said.
Axe Committee Chairman
Guillermo Huerta '09 said one reason
students might be sensing less publici
ty for Big Game this year is because
Axe Comm decided to stop posting
paper flyers advertising Big Game.
"Axe Command Cardinal Cheer
actually made a video to advertise Big
Game," he said. "This was forwarded
out to all the dorm lists, and I think
what happened is that it only got out to
a couple of dorms and not campus
wide."
"People are used to seeing fliers,"
Huerta added. "Because we didn't do
that and the email wasn't as effective,
there might have been less publicity
for the Big Game."
Even if students are less aware of
Big Game this year, the excitement
and importance of the match-up will
still undoubtedly coax Cardinal fans to
Berkeley.
"Even if the bowl game was
already in the bag. we're coming off of
breaking Cal's longest time with the
axe." Huerta said. "Ihey're definitely
going to want revenge and to defend
their name at their home stadium."
