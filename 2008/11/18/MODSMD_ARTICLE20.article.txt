## Harbaugh nears deal to stay at Stanford 
### Denis Griffin 
Stanford football Head Coach
Jim Harbaugh addressed concerns
that he could be leaving The Farm
following this season for an NFL
position or a job with another col
lege team, claiming that he and the
University were "close" to finaliz
ing an agreement on a contract ex
tension.
Speaking at a press conference
today. Harbaugh told reporters that
he was "1(X) percent committed to
Stanford University." Earlier this
season, rumors had surfaced that the
second-year Cardinal coach could be
a prime candidate to replace Interim
Head Coach Tom Cable with the
Oakland Raiders after this season.
Harbaugh has ties to the Raiders or
ganization. having worked with the
team as an assistant coach in the 2002
and 2(X)3 seasons.
Speaking at the same conference,
junior running back Toby Gerhart
was less sure of his future with the
Cardinal following this season. Ger
hart. a two-sport athlete who also
plays baseball for Stanford, said that
there was a chance he could leave to
pursue a career in MLB should he be
drafted high enough and offered
enough money in baseball's annual
first year player draft in June.
"The only way I'd leave is if some
thing extraordinary happens." Ger
hart told the San Jose Mercury News.
"It's bad to say, but it essentially
comes down to money, in a sense."
Recovering from a knee injury
suffered playing football last year.
Gerhart struggled early in the '08
baseball season. But the Cardinal
outfielder heated up as Stanford
charged into the College World Se
ries and hit .327 over his final 16
games.
Stanford football plays its final
regular season game of the year on
Saturday at Cal. with a possible bowl
game berth on the line. Kickoff is set
for 12:30 p.m.
