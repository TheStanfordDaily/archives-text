### JULIA BROWNELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A panel of Olympic athletes,
coaches, volunteers and observers
met last night to discuss the signifi
cance of this summer's Beijing
games at an event hosted bv
FACES.
The Forum for
American/Chinese Exchange at
Stanford (FACES) invited athletes
Matt Gentry '04 (men's wrestling),
Jason Dunford "09 (men's swim
ming), and Arantxa King '11
(women's track and field); coaches
Johnny Dawkins (USA men's bas
ketball) and Brandon Marcello
(USA softball conditioning coach):
sports columnist Jannv Hu of The
San Francisco Chronicle: Beijing
resident and School of Education
student Jing Li and Olympic volun
teer Caroline Schwanzer to talk
about their Olympic experiences
and their impressions of China.
The athletes and coaches stressed
that their events were their first pri
ority.
"You're there to compete,"
Gentry said pointedly.
Once that fact was established,
however. Chinese politics and the
organization of the Olympic event
quickly became the main focus in a
spirited debate showcasing what
FACES member Kevin Hsu '09
called the "tensions between what
people in Beijing and what people
outside of China thought."
Outsiders saw many of the
Chinese government's actions as an
unrepresentative portrait of the
country.
"I got the impression that we
were being shielded from the real
China," Dunford said.
Audience member Tricia Bolle,
an alumna of the Center for East
Asian Studies, voiced her own opin
ion from her experience as a specta
tor at the Olympics.
"It was a show." she said. "There's
real life that happens beneath that."
Li, however, spoke with pride of
China's accomplishment in showcas
ing the best of the country in these
Olympics.
"Everyone put much effort into
[the Olympics]," she said. "I think.

after this, we are more proud of our
selves and our people as a unified
country."
However, many of the political
issues underpinning the Olympic
Games quickly came to the surface.
The panelists spoke of the wide
spread restrictions imposed on
speech and information, particularly
on the banning of any protests on
hot-button issues like the politics of
Tibet and Darfur.
Gentry commented on how
strongly the Olympic committee for

bade any political demonstration as
part of the Olympic charter.
"If you were caught doing any
thing. they made it very clear that
you would be put on a plane and
sent home," he said. "I don't like
that they told me what I could or
could not do."
However, most of restrictions
discussed were those of the Chinese
government, not the Olympic com
mittee.
"We found out later that when
thev released the 'most-watched

list,' four people on our team were
on it," Marcello said. The four play
ers were a part of Team Darfur, and
therefore were tagged as possible
threats.
"I think most of the athletes were
a little hit scared to discuss any of
these [political] issues" Dunford
said. "1 think we got the impression
that you never know who's listen
ing."
Members of the press felt these
restrictions even more strongly. Hu
commented that, when reporting
from China, she did feel the pres
ence of the government.
"Your movements are pretty
much tracked," said Hu, who had to
show her press visa everywhere she
went. "They let the government
know that you're a journalist there."
"The issue of censorship did
come up a lot," she added. "A lot of
the locals didn't want to talk
because they were afraid."
Hu reminded the audience that,
as a journalist, she had to remember
that those talking with her who crit
icized the government would be the
ones facing repercussions.
"You have to protect your
sources." she emphasized.
However, though the restrictive
ness of the government was highly
criticized, most of the panelists
noted that China's rapid develop
ment to accommodate the Games
and modernize Beijing was astound
ing.
"Everything got done in half a
year." Li said. "It was pretty amaz
ing."
"You could tell how important
hosting was to them," Gentry added.
Finally, attention fell to environ
mental issues, especially pollution.
The outlook on that front was a lit
tle more hopeful because the gov
ernment poured so much money
into alleviating the problems for the
games, and"the seeds for environ
mental awareness are there now."
Hu said.
With the panel attracting about
25 Stanford community members,
FACES member Rachel Lee '11 said
the Olympics are still important to
talk about today.
"This was a huge milestone of
China moving forward," Lee said.
"These issues are not going away
because the Olympics are over."
