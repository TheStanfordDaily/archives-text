### NIKHIL JOSHI DESK EDITOR 
Jose Maria Aznar, prime minister of
Spain from 19% to 2004, knows first
hand the challenge of government tran
sitions. At Stanford Law School last
night. Aznar shared his experiences',
speaking to students about the global

political situation President-elect
Barack Obama will lace when he enters
office on Jan. 20.
In an hour-long talk. Aznar
addressed a variety of topics, ranging
from the global financial crisis to terror
ism. hut focused on the differences the
world will see come January, when the
A me ican presidency will undergo a
pivotal transformation.
"George W. Bush is my friend."
Aznar said as he began his speech.
When he was prime minister, Aznar
supported the American invasion of
Iraq, and saw his approval ratings plum

met as a result.
He then spoke of the vast differ
ences between Bush and his successor,
Obama. Aznar was particularly struck
by the immense popularity Obama
enjoyed — something Aznar said could
cause problems.
"Being too popular is also a prob
lem. believe me." Aznar said. "A leader
cannot make all the people happv all
the time. Barack Obama will need more
than special effects to walk on water."
Most of all. Aznar advocated a mod
erate, cautious stance, especially when
lookinc at Bush's lecacv.

"It is my belief that those who blame
Bush for all the problems in the world
are simply wrong, and will be disap
pointed when the new president comes
in January and things change slower
than they hoped." the former prime
minister said.
In fact. Aznar decried the notion of
radical change, saying a quick disman
tling of Bush policies would have a neg
ative effect on America and the world.
As he moved to a more specific dis
cussion of issues eoina forward. Aznar
paused to praise the United States,
emphasizing his belief that what the
U.S. does has a tremendous impact
on Europe and the entire world.
"I believe in the West," he said
on two occasions. "We need a strong
America, not a weak, introspective
one."
A/nar first discussed the global
financial crisis. As prime minister,
A/nar led Spain to adopt the Euro
and shepherded the country
through the tumultuous global
economy of the early 2()(M)s.
The former prime minister
emphatically told students that he
believed a rush to government
intervention and protectionism
would he disastrous, especially for
the world's poorer nations. Instead,
he advocated reforming the regula
tory bodies while promoting free
trade and free markets.
A/.nar then moved to matters of
foreign policy, discussing
Afghanistan, Russia and Iran.
He said Afghanistan, a country
Obama has labeled a focus of
American foreign policy, is of great
importance and will test European-
American relations. According to
A/nar, while the U.S. will look to
Europe to help shoulder the load in
Afghanistan, European nations are
questioning whether they have
interest in the Middle Eastern coun
try. He also emphasized that
Afghanistan must be looked at
within a regional framework, con
sidering countries such as Pakistan.
Russia, according to A/nar. is a
pressing concern for Europeans,
especially in Eastern and Central
Europe, and the recent conflict over
Georgia has given the Russia situa
tion urgency.
"What to do with Georgia is a
very divisive question for the
alliance," A/nar said, adding that
Georgia has been promised eventu
al admission to NATO.
A/nar noted that the possibility
of a U.S. missile defense installation
in the Czech Republic is further
complicating relations with Russia,
and will be a political flashpoint
with which Obama will have to con
tend.
Next. A/nar discussed the effect
a nuclear Iran would have on global

politics. He said a nuclear-capable
Iran would fundamentally change
the strategic landscape of the
Middle East, but that foreign inter
vention in the short run would not
successfully remedy the problem.
"Unless we find a better alterna
tive. we should be prepared to live
with a nuclear Iran in the mid
term." Aznar said.
A/nar wrapped up his prepared
speech by returning to the subject of
the Bush-Obama transition.
According to A/nar, the Obama
administration's biggest challenges
will be engaging China, managing

US-EU-NATO relations, working
toward energy security and dealing
with what he called "assertive
Islam."
Though he was optimistic that a
strong West is necessary for the
world, he exercised caution in lieu
of lavishing praise on Obama. When
speaking of how successful the
President-elect will be over the next
four years, Aznar was coy.
' I'm afraid we will have to wait
for the exit test to come," he said.
