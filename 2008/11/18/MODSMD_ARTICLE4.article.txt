## CAPS strains to meet health needs Despite staff additions, increased demand and limited resources plague CAPS NEWS ANALYSIS 
### ANDREW VALENCIA DESK EDITOR 
This is the second in a five-port series this week by The Daily focusing on campus men
tal health, specifically in light of the University's report released last month. Further sto
ries will look at the changes being made in Residential Education and the relationship
between alcohol trends and mental health issues.

Stanford Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS)
has undergone a major staff expansion and outreach program
this quarter in an effort to make it easier for students to
access counseling resources. Yet. despite the additional coun
selors on hand. CAPS resources are currently overwhelmed
by an enormous increase in student demand for psychologi
cal services.
Increasing accessibility
In the recent report issued by the Student Mental Health
and Well-Being (MHWB) Task Force, the various difficulties
being faced by the CAPS program were addressed at length.
Specifically, the report pointed out the unprecedented
demand for psychological services, coupled with the lack of
accessibility due to staff limitations. In an effort to increase
access to services, CAPS has added additional staff members
to the central office in Vaden Health Center — three new
psychology PhDs, two half-time physicians, a case manage
ment official and a new Director of CAPS. Ron Albucher.
also a full-time physician.
"With this additional staff, there is more opportunity to
spend more resources on education and outreach." said Greg
Boardman. vice provost for Student Affairs and chair of the
MHWB Task Force.
In a further effort to keep up with demands — and as a
way of screening students prior to scheduling appointments
— CAPS has come to rely on over-the-phone questionnaires
to assess the severity of a student's situation and determine
how immediate the problem must be dealt with. Also, a new
on-call entry system will allow students to be counseled right
when they call, if the counselor is available.
With these additions to the staff. CAPS officials hope the
program will be able to meet the needs of all of the students
seeking help.
Yet. at the same time that CAPS has been adding new
counselors and increasing accessibility, student demand has
grown at a far greater rate than staff development, so that
even with the new additions. CAPS is finding its resources
strained.
The pressures of student demand
According to Albucher. since the beginning of the quarter.
CAPS has had approximately 50 to 60 new students per week
coming in to seek psychological counseling and help. While
CAPS strives to accommodate the
influx of new students, Albucher
admitted that heavy demand is put
ting considerable strain on the pro
gram.
"We have to juggle them, the
resources," Albucher said. "If we
took in everyone who wanted to
come in, as opposed to triaging
things, we would be overwhelmed."
The phone-based entry system
which subjects students to a 15-
minute screening prior to scheduling
an appointment — is one way that
CAPS is trying to sort through stu
dents in ordyr to make sure that the
most at-risk individuals receive
counseling the same day. Students
who are evaluated as less at-risk may
receive an appointment the next day,
or possibly later. While there are two
clinicians on call each day at CAPS,
access to these short-notice services
may be greatly limited depending on
demand. And as resources have
become more and more strained, the
need to identify and treat the most
serious cases has taken priority over
everything else.
"in my mind, we want to do a few
things as absolutes and see where we

are beyond that," Albucher said.
"We have resources, but they're lim
ited, and we want to target them
toward the people who need
[them]."
Albucher has attempted to keep
CAPS afloat amidst this new wave of
demand, which has seen an increase
across the board in serious condi
tions, ranging from mood disorders
to clinical depression. With cases of
emotional and psychological disor
ders on the rise — and with coun
selors struggling to provide all of the
students with traditional therapy —
CAPS is seeing an additional
increase in the number of students
using medication for treatment. Just
this quarter, student visits to CAPS
to attain medication have increased
30 percent from last quarter.
Some come with prescriptions
already written by other doctors, but
many receive prescriptions upon
receiving counseling from CAPS.
"What happens here at CAPS is
that all of our psychotherapists carry
caseloads of medications," Albucher
said.
While the average student suffer
ing from a major psychological
episode receives approximately six
sessions with a trained counselor,
counselors are finding that medica
tion is a helpful supplement to coun
seling. Albucher admitted, however,
that some students on medication

may be able to receive adequate
treatment without medication. But,
at the same time, he has seen more
and more students whose psy
chopathology necessitates prescrip
tion medication as well as therapy.
The troubles of the average student
While the MHWB report and
CAPS officials recognize that there
is a greater demand for counseling
services on campus than ever before,
there is little authoritative consensus
— either on campus or nationwide
— as to why students in college are
increasingly seeking psychological
help.
Here at Stanford, CAPS officials
and those in charge of overseeing
undergraduate life have had to
become accustomed to dealing with
a broad range of mental health con
cerns affecting members of the stu
dent body.
"In my experience, these are
issues that run the full gamut," said
Wilbur Academic Director Glenn
Russell Brody Magid. He claimed he
has seen students facing mental dis
tress for everything from anxiety
over a midterm to issues with family.
At colleges and universities
across the country, the statistics have
shown that the situations other
schools are dealing with concerning
mental health services parallel the
situation at Stanford — nationwide,
more college students are finding it
necessary to find professional help
for psychological issues.
"It's not just a Stanford-specific
phenomenon," Albucher said.
"When we talk to people at our peer
institutions . .. this is common

across the board. I think we may be
seeing increases in psychopathology
as a whole."
Albucher also speculated that the
increase may at least partially be
explained by the greater availability
of effective treatments to young peo
ple, which could have made it more
possible for students affected by
mental disorders to gain admission
to Stanford and its peer institutions.
But among administrators and
other members of the MHWB Task
Force, the focus has remained large
ly on preventing mental distress on
campus through counseling and
measures aimed at relieving student
stress. In 2005, for example.
Thanksgiving break was extended to
a full week, with many hoping that it
would give students necessary rest
just before finals.
At an Oct. 29 meeting with Hie
Daily, task force members speculat
ed about the possibility of instituting
similar lull weeks oil near the end of
the winter and spring quarters. And
with services like the Bridge and
events such as Real World Stanford
during New Student Orientation,the
administration has been working to
help underclassmen handle the pres
sures of early college life.
"Freshmen are the most at risk."
said Health Services Administrator
Ira Friedman."Our data suggest that
freshmen don't use our services as
much as in the later years."
While the University has tried to
prevent students from becoming
overwhelmed, some members of the
student body actually fault their own
peers for allowing stress and anxiety
to endanger their mental health.

"I feel like Stanford makes a
good effort in making people feel
like they don't have to stress out on
things," said a Trancos Resident
Assistant (RA), who was granted
anonymity due to Residential
Education policy. '"But people here
tend to have high expectations of
themselves,and it's not really a place
where everybody can satisfy their
expectations."
Outreach and decentralization
In taking over as director of
CAPS. Albucher has set a two-phase
plan for this year to maximize the
benefits and efficiency of CAPS.
The first phase — increasing
accessibility to psychological servic
es — includes outreach efforts and
the establishment of "liaisons"
between the central CAPS office
and every residence and department
on campus. For these positions,
Albucher has turned to current full
time staff members who are willing
to be on the lookout for students
who show the warning signs of men
tal illness, and who would act as the
first level of support in the CAPS
hierarchy.
"Ensuring mental health on cam
pus is a bigger job than CAPS."
Albucher said. "We need the help of
everyone on campus to identify peo
ple who need help or who are at
risk."
The second phase, which
Albucher aims to complete during
winter quarter, will involve the cre
ation of specialized support groups
that will each address certain issues
— social isolation, dating problems,
etc. — through weekly group thera

py sessions that all students are wel
come to attend. Each group would
be overseen by a certified CAPS
counselor, who would work with
multiple students at a time in dealing
with specific problems, possibly
through particular therapeutic tech
niques such as cognitive therapy.
The end result of these reforms
and initiatives would be a highly
decentralized psychological support
system, in which students have
access to a wide range of support
services closer to their daily environ
ment. Students would still have
access to CAPS resources, but the
hope is that many students will be
able to find help without actually
having to schedule an appointment
at Vaden. In this way, Albucher
hopes to find an equilibrium
between the demand for counseling
services and the limits of CAPS
resources.
As CAPS works to institute the
recommendations of the MHWB
report, the University plans to estab
lish an oversight committee to see
that the recommendations are being
followed. While hopes are high that
CAPS can reconcile its finite means
with the ever-increasing number of
students seeking help, administra
tors are being pragmatic about what
they can accomplish in the short
term, especially considering the
economy.
"The reality that we found out is
that mental health is really the
responsibility of all of us,"
Boardman said.
