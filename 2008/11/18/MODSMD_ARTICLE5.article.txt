## Early apps reach record number Increase attributed to increased outreach, interviews 
### KATE ABBOTT 
'ITie number of college applicants is
increasing substantially each year, and this
year, Stanford's early application process is
no exception.
Approximately 5,360 students applied
under the Restricted Early Action option to
the University this year, according to
Director of Admission Shawn Abbott. This
number represents a 17-percent increase
from last year's early applicant pool, but
Abbott said the spike could not be attributed
to any single reason.
"I shouldn't speculate on what has caused
the increase," Abbott said in an email to'lTie
Daily."because I'm sure it is a myriad of fac-
tors.
These efforts include "enhanced
financial aid policies" that were
implemented last spring. Abbott said
current policies will be reviewed
again in January or February of next
year.
Both Stanford and Yale saw an
increase in overall applicants after
Harvard and Princeton eliminated
their early decision plans in the fall
of 2007, even though Stanford expe
rienced a decrease in early appli
cants last year. This year's increase
may also be due to Stanford's new
campus viewbook. redesigned Web
site and intensive outreach efforts,
according to Abbott.
Outreach efforts include a pilot
admission interview program
involving various alumni in six
cities. The interviews — an optional
component of the application
process — are offered in Atlanta.
Denver, London. New York City,
Philadelphia and Portland.
The cities were chosen based on
the availability of a diverse appli
cant pool and alumni network.
Alumni volunteers were trained
during the fall, and interviews will
run through the end of February,
according to Abbott.

viewed two Stanford hopefuls.
"I've really enjoyed it."he said.
"It's fun for someone like me. an
alumnus, to talk with these younger
people who want to he a part of the
Stanford community."
Jewell said his interviewees dis
cussed a hroad range of topics, from
dance to travel. He also stressed
that while the interviewers provide
a brief written report to the admis
sion office, the alumnus or alumna
ultimately has no say in the admis
sion decision.
The interview process creates
more of a personal connection
between the applicant and the
Universitv. Jewell added.

"Instead of students sending off
their applications to cyberspace and
not hearing anything until they get
their decision, they feel more per
sonally connected to Stanford in the
way that they do to our peer institu
tions," he said.
Many current students feel that
the interview adds a dimension to
the application process that the per
sonal essays do not.
"The interview is a great way to
give a better perspective on who
you are than just the essays," said
Andrea Fuentes '12, who applied
early to Stanford last year. "If you
haven't met anyone from the insti
tution. it establishes a connection.
With essays, you're limited to a
prompt, but in an interview, you can
express yourself however you
want."
Edie Constable '12 said
Stanford's switch to the Common
Application last year may be a fac
tor in the increase of early appli
cants, because it eases the overall
application process.
"I applied early because I
thought it would be easier to get in."
Constable said. "The supplement to
the Common Application was
demanding, but it also made sure
that you had other options if you
didn't get into Stanford."
Early application candidates will
receive their decisions in mid-
December.
