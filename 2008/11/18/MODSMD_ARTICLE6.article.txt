### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
Hie Stanford women's soccer
team is through to the NCAA
round of 16 for the
third straight year after beating
UC-Santa Barbara and Kansas
at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium this
weekend. The Cardinal got goals
from six different players over
the weekend and kept its oppo
nents scoreless.
"We played pretty well."
Stanford head coach Paul
Ratcliffe said. "Our commit
ment and determination were
fantastic and we showed great

character in both games."
The Cardinal women began
the weekend on Friday night
with their first round match
against UCSB. Both teams were
cagey in the opening 20 minutes
— not surprising given the win
or-go-home format of the
NCAA Tournament. The game
began to pick up around the
24th minute when sophomore
forward Christen Press came
close to putting Stanford on top
on two shots in a row. The
Gauchos quickly responded
when UCSB's Sarah Stoltz
curled a shot just over the cross
bar at the other end.

Sophomore forward Morgan Redman drives home Stanford's fifth
and final goal against Kansas on Sunday. The Cardinal won its first
two NCAA Tournament games by a combined score of 7-0.
Hut it was then that Stanford
began to dominate the match, put
ting relentless pressure on the Gau
cho defense. Press was the main in
stigator. and she finished the half
with seven of her team's 13 shots.
The Cardinal was unable to find a
goal though, and the game went to
halftime scoreless.
Press finally broke through and
scored just six minutes into the sec
ond half — although she received
some help from her opponents. The
Gaucho defense made a bad pass in
the penalty box and Press blasted
the loose ball into the back of the
net. giving Stanford the lead.
The Cardinal kept up the pres
sure and almost got another score in
the 7Xth minute when Press found
junior AM Riley on the counterat
tack. but the fullback's shot went
right at the keeper.
The second and final goal came
just one minute later, as senior cen
ter back Allison Falk headed in a
corner kick off the crossbar for her
second goal of the year. UCSB could
not break through the Stanford de
fense and the game ended 2-0.
The Cardinal's second round op
ponent was Kansas, who had beaten
Denver 2-1 on Friday night. Stan
ford had a much brighter start on
Sunday: although there were no
early scores, freshman forward
Lindsay Taylor, junior midfielder
Kristin Stannard and Press all had
scoring opportunities in the first ten
minutes.
The Jayhawks battled back into
the game, and neither team could
gain an advantage until the final ten
minutes of the half. In the 34th
minute, Taylor hit a header off a
Stanford corner kick that was
blocked by the Kansas keeper. But
the Jayhawks couldn't clear the ball
and it eventually bounced to Riley
on the right side. The junior defend
er passed the hall to classmate Kel
ley O'Hara, who unleashed a left
looted bullet from outside the box.
The ball found the upper-left corner
of the goal to make it I -0.
The Cardinal added another
score four minutes later. Riley again

GAME NOTES: The Stanford women's soccer
team rolled through the first Iwo rounds of
the NCAA Tournament over the weekend.
Despite a slow start, the Cardinal defeated
UCSB in the firs* round, 2-0. Stanford com
pletely dominated Kansas in round two on
Sunday, going up 3-0 by the end of the first
period and tacking on two more goals in the
second half. The Cardinal has now ad
vanced to the Sweet 16 for the third straight
year, and will use this week to prepare for a
physical Rutgers squad.
edge of the box. and this time she
found redshirt junior Hillary Heath
on the left just before the defender
closed in. Heath drilled a one-timer
past the diving Kansas keeper, bury
ing the ball in the near corner. It was
I Icath's first goal of the season.
The Stanford barrage continued
in the 42nd minute when freshman
midfielder Cami Levin once again
displayed her long-range shooting
ability, expertly lobbing a shot over
the keeper from 25 yards to make
the score 3-0.
The Cardinal attack didn't let up
in the second half though, and the
fourth goal came in the 65th minute.
Junior fullback Alicia Jenkins —
who was already having a stellar
game defensively — got into the act
on offense by releasing O'l lara with
a through ball that split the defense.
The forward saw her effort saved by
the Jayhawk keeper, but the Kansas
defense self-destructed again: the
goalie cleared the ball right to Press.
The sophomore exposed the keep

er's had positioning and sent in a
beautiful chip that dipped right
under the crossbar from 30 yards
out. Ratcliffe began subbing out his
starters shortly thereafter.
Stanford would get the game's
final tally with 13 minutes remain
ing. as senior forward Kelley Birch
headed a clearance from the Jay
hawks' goalie back towards the goal.
Sophomore forward Morgan Red
man raced to the ball, shrugged off a
defender and slotted it past the
keeper and into the low-near corner.
The goal made it 5-0 and completed
a comprehensively dominant per
formance from the Cardinal attack.
The team's offensive explosion
was even more impressive consider
ing the fact that freshman playmak
er Teresa Noyola did not play on
Sunday. The midfielder suffered a
knee injury in Friday's match and
Ratcliffe decided not to risk aggra
vating it against Kansas. Sopho
more Allison McCann got the start
at defensive midfield, while Stan
nard moved up to attacking mid
field. Noyola hopes to be ready for
this weekend's game.
While the five goals clearly
demonstrated the Cardinal's offen
sive capabilities, the defensive ef
fort was equally impressive. The
Stanford backline completely
snuffed out a determined Kansas at
tack. limiting the Jayhawks to only
two shots on goal, neither of which
troubled sophomore keeper Kira
Maker.
"They've been critical to our suc
cess all year," Ratcliffe said of his
defense. "Not only do they defend
well, but they also start up our at
tacks. And on Sunday they really
dictated the tempo."
"Overall, we're happy to get
through the first two rounds,but we
want to keep working hard and our
goal is to win a national title."
Stanford now moves on to the
Sweet 16. They will host Rutgers
next weekend — the match is
scheduled for Friday, 7 p.m. at
Caean Stadium.
