# WOMEN'S SOCCER NCAA TOURNAMENT
## SWEET 16- BOUND Cardinal women cruise to wins over UCSB and Kansas 
### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
Hie Stanford women's soccer
team is through to the NCAA
round of 16 for the
third straight year after beating
UC-Santa Barbara and Kansas
at Laird Q. Cagan Stadium this
weekend. The Cardinal got goals
from six different players over
the weekend and kept its oppo
nents scoreless.
"We played pretty well."
Stanford head coach Paul
Ratcliffe said. "Our commit
ment and determination were
fantastic and we showed great

character in both games."
The Cardinal women began
the weekend on Friday night
with their first round match
against UCSB. Both teams were
cagey in the opening 20 minutes
â€” not surprising given the win
or-go-home format of the
NCAA Tournament. The game
began to pick up around the
24th minute when sophomore
forward Christen Press came
close to putting Stanford on top
on two shots in a row. The
Gauchos quickly responded
when UCSB's Sarah Stoltz
curled a shot just over the cross
bar at the other end.
