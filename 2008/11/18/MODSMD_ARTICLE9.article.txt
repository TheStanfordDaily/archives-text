## Life off the Farm: THE
						OTHER FIVE PERCENT OF STANFORD UNDERGRADS 
### ANNE WARNER 
When choosing housing options, most
undergrads focus on which campus housing
to rank first, not whether to live on or off
campus. After all. Stanford is primarily a
residential university, with 95 percent of
undergrads living on campus and taking
advantage of the residential educational
resources available, according to Director of
Housing Assignments Sue Nunan.
That means the remaining five percent,
however, are making their way off campus.
Tim Gregory '09, who lives in a one-bed
room Palo Alto apartment for $1,050 a
month, argues that a sense of privacy is very
important to him. Drawing unpreferred last
year because many of his friends were
abroad or had graduated, he said that he
"would most likely have ended up in a one
room double with a stranger, and this was
not desirable."
Likewise, Brianna Wilson '09 attributes
her decision to live off campus to dissatisfac
tion with her housing assignment and "a
need for a change."
"Luckily, I had a good friend who lived in
a house off campus in East Palo Alto who
suggested I move in," Wilson said. "I
checked out the house, loved it and decided
to go with it. I'm very happy with my deci
sion."
She now shares a four-bedroom house in

East Palo Alto with three friends who have
graduated from college and pays $350 per
month in rent.
Yet Nunan claims that housing com
plaints aren't the only reason why students
opt to live off campus.
According to her, some are no longer
guaranteed housing because they are in
their fifth years or are returning after long
absences, and they may choose to live off
campus despite housing availability in
Escondido Village (EV). Others who are
married and have children may also turn
down EV options.
There are also students who are from the
area and decide to live at home. One such a
student, a junior who asked to remain
anonymous for privacy about his situation,
elected to live at his parents' house in Palo
Alto this quarter.
"I'm not taking many classes this quar
ter. so I'm only on campus two to three days
per week." he said. "It's cheaper to live at
home."
Although Nunan mentioned that the
undergrad trend of living off campus has
"perhaps decreased a little due to a tighten
ing in the off-campus market," she does not
deem this change significant and instead
believes that the proportions have remained
relatively stable throughout the years.
Gregory sees a number of advantages to
living off campus — including location.

"l live near California Avenue," he said.
"Ouiznos is better than Subway, MedWraps
is better than Olives. Hie Counter is better
than The Treehouse and the Chinese food
there is definitely better than the interesting
offerings at Tresidder."
In addition to the flexibility in his living
situation, Gregory appreciates the "real
world" element.
"While I enjoyed campus living for the
first couple of years, it's nice to be around an
ordinary sample of the population in real
life," he said.
Blake Masters '08 — who decided to live
off campus his junior year after being
approached by four friends who had space
in their Palo Alto townhouse —similarly
stressed that living off campus increased the
potential to have more meaningful relation
ships with others.
"Some folks might not do well socially
off campus, and that's understandable," he
said. "In my case. I'd built up a social net
work 1 was happy with, so I wasn't fright
ened by cutting the cord to campus.
Actually, it's a good way to really meet peo
ple as you identify and associate with folks
in some mutually meaningful capacity,
instead of doing so because they randomly
drew into your dorm or hall."
Wilson is also happy with the demo
graphics of her off-campus living quarters.
"Since I don't live with students, I feel
more balanced — like school isn't 24/7." she
said.
On top of that, having her own space is
another important element for Wilson.
"I have my own room and pretty much
my own bathroom." she said.
"Our house is deep in East Palo Alto, so
people always ask me if it is scary." Wilson

added. "It's really not — we live right next
to an elementary school and at the end of a
non-through street that is close to some
beautiful running trails that go right up to
the water of the Bay."
Yet along with having one's own space
comes the inevitable importance of taking
responsibility and "acting like an adult," in
Masters' words.
Actually finding a house is the first step
for students who don't have the luxury of
finding friends who have done so already.
"You may have to search for a while, and
Craigslist can be quite unforgiving."
Gregory said. "When something comes up.
you pretty much better sign the contract
then and there or it will get taken by the
next day."
According to the Craigslist listings, apart
ments and small houses can be rented any
where from $1,395 to $6.0(X) per month,
compared to the Stanford Office of
Financial Aid's 2008-2009 room and board
estimate of $11,182 for three quarters in a
dorm.
The less-expensive off-campus places
tend to be in East Palo Alto. Menlo Park or
Mountain View, but as students must take
the extended commute into account,
whether they save or lose money depends
on how they configure their living situa
tions. For instance, having multiple students
sharing a home in East Palo Alto is more
cost-efficient than living alone close to cam
pus.
The responsibilities don't stop once the
house has actually been acquired, either.
"You have to remember to pay bills!"
Gregory said. "There is no Stanford one
click Web site to take care of it all."
Food, furnishings, transportation, sched

uling — the list goes on after that, too.
Masters said that he had to get used to
his 15-minute commute and being perpetu
ally five minutes late to class. Because
Wilson lives in East Palo Alto, she has a 20-
minute commute.
"But I still think it's worth it.and usually
1 just come to campus in the morning, stay
on campus all day,go home at night," Wilson
said. "Sometimes I'll crash on a friend's
futon on campus. 1 probably wouldn't live
off campus if I wasn't a senior, but since I
feel like I'm already well-rooted on campus,
it works out great."
With a different situation — that is, living
with his parents — the anonymous junior
has a vastly different opinion. He noted the
difficulty of hanging out with friends spon
taneously and thinks that he misses out on
things because of where he lives.
"I miss being able to just walk out of your
dorm and go get involved in something." he
said. "I really miss living on campus, so I'm
going to be back for winter quarter."
But for Gregory, there are easy remedies
to scheduling inconveniences.
"If you really, really miss happy hour at
EBF or Wine and Cheese at Kairos, then
you can go back on campus if you don't plan
on getting trashed or you live close enough
to walk home," he said. "I usually prefer to
just stay in or visit my friends who live just
down the street."
"All in all. we get four years on campus,"
Masters said. "I could see how some would
want to stay on campus for all four. But I'm
glad I took a year and lived in a house off
campus — haven't regretted it once."
