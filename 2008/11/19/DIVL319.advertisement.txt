William Saroyan was born of Armenian-American parents in Fresno in 1908, and grew up
among Japanese, Irish, German, Assyrian, Chinese, and Armenian working class immigrants
in that town. He came on the literary scene as a short story writer, hut had his first big hit
with the play, "The Time of Your Life," which won the Pulitzer Prize in 1940 and made him
a household name to an entire generation.
Please join us for a celebration of Saroyan's life and work, featuring dramatic readings, and
performances of several of his stories directed by Professor Rush Rehm, and a special tribute
from celebrated Armenian-American poet and novelist David Kherdian.
