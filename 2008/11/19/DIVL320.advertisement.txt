At many levels, teachers must be prepared for both the expected
and unexpected. We not only teach future professionals to plan
and learn for typical situations; we also prepare them to improvise
and cope with surprises. Like teachers, others in professional
practice — whether they are physicians, lawyers, nurses, engineers,
or clergy — alternate constantly between performing routine
procedures and handling unpredictable challenges. Drawing on
research on professional teaching and learning at the Carnegie
Foundation and at Stanford, Lee Shulman will examine the
important lessons that are emerging about approaches to
teaching, learning, and the role of habit, judgment, and identity
in the formation of professionals.
SS Free and open to the public.
