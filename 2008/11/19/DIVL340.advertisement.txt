Purpose
The Invention Challenge Is designed to stimulate technology Innovation at Stanford University by BHHHMMMMHH
addressing real problems in areas ripe for invention. We challenge Stanford students and student
teams to develop new ways to prevent or mitigate bicycle Injury. Students and teams are expected
