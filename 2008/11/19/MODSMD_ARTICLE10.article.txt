Manning Marable, professor of
history at Columbia University and
director of the Institute for
Research in African-American
studies,delivered a lecture last night
in Cubberley Auditorium entitled
"Barack Obama. Racial Politics,
Faith and the Legacy of Malcom X."
Marable, who is currently work
ing on a biography of Malcom X,
emphasized the importance of
Obama's election within the context
of African-American racial history
and re-examined the views and con
tributions of Malcolm X to
American politics.
The Columbia professor por
trayed the election of Barrack
Obama as part of a political devel
opment that mirrored the spiritual
and political evolution of Malcolm

X. Starting with a brief history of
pivotal events in the civil rights
movement, Marable said that along
side the Montgomery Bus Boycott
and the Brown v. Board of
Education decision, the 1955 Asian-
African conference in Bandung,
Indonesia was pivotal in galvanizing
international solidarity against
racism.
Marable added that the Bandung
conference was critical in influenc
ing Malcolm X's political philoso
phy, and consequently had a central
role in creating a trans-national
voice for civil rights in American
politics.
"Representatives from 29 Asian
and African countries met to dis
cuss plans for future economic,
social and political cooperation,"
