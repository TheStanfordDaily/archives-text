### NIKHIL KAMAT STAFF WRITER 
Manning Marable, professor of
history at Columbia University and
director of the Institute for
Research in African-American
studies,delivered a lecture last night
in Cubberley Auditorium entitled
"Barack Obama. Racial Politics,
Faith and the Legacy of Malcom X."
Marable, who is currently work
ing on a biography of Malcom X,
emphasized the importance of
Obama's election within the context
of African-American racial history
and re-examined the views and con
tributions of Malcolm X to
American politics.
The Columbia professor por
trayed the election of Barrack
Obama as part of a political devel
opment that mirrored the spiritual
and political evolution of Malcolm

X. Starting with a brief history of
pivotal events in the civil rights
movement, Marable said that along
side the Montgomery Bus Boycott
and the Brown v. Board of
Education decision, the 1955 Asian-
African conference in Bandung,
Indonesia was pivotal in galvanizing
international solidarity against
racism.
Marable added that the Bandung
conference was critical in influenc
ing Malcolm X's political philoso
phy, and consequently had a central
role in creating a trans-national
voice for civil rights in American
politics.
"Representatives from 29 Asian
and African countries met to dis
cuss plans for future economic,
social and political cooperation,"
Marable said. " The final commu
nique of the conference called for
a global struggle against all mani
festations of racism, apartheid in
South Africa and ending discrimi
nation, which were all gross viola
tions of human rights."
Marable said that Malcolm X's
religious development, as a mem
ber of the Nation of Islam, was also
pivotal in influencing African-
American political discourse.
Marable cited Malcolm X's historic
trip to the Middle East in 1959 as
the catalyst for the black rights
activist's realization that Islam's
lack of racial distinctions amongst
believers carried with it a political
imperative to change the antago
nistic and dividing racial senti
ments that were at the core of the
Nation of Islam's ideology.

"Islam was, in theory, color-blind;
members of the Ummah could be
any nationality or ethnicity as long
as they believed in and practiced the
five pillars and other essentials of
faith." Marable said. "Malcolm came
to the full realization during his trip
that the Nation of Islam's pseudo-
Islamic concepts and practices
would have to be abandoned gradu
ally while at the same time accelerat
ing the assimilation of orthodox
Islam within the nation of Islam."
Marable continued his discus
sion with a comparison to the
development of contemporary
black politics. Starting in the 1980s
with Jesse Jackson's historic 1984
bid for the presidency, Marable
suggested that African-American
politics in the '80s and early '90s
was also driven by an agenda that
emphasized racial divisions.
"Many of us involved in the
national black assembly anticipat
ed at that time the establishment of
an all-black independent political
party separate from the Democrats

and the Republicans, where
African Americans would exercise
the greatest possible freedom
negotiating deals between the par
ties and institutions, because we
were convinced we could trust
none of them," Marable said.
Marable said that, like Malcolm
X, Barack Obama and his contem
poraries, such as Massachusetts
Governor Deval Patrick and for
mer L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley, tran
scended the politics of race in order
to emphasize a message of political
unity. Marable argued that it was
this message that contributed to
their success as politicians.
"In America's major cities, there
is no explicitly Latino strategy for
enhancing public transportation:
there is no African-American strat
egy to improve public health care;
there is no Asian-American strate
gy to go green or have environmen
tal justice," Marable said.
