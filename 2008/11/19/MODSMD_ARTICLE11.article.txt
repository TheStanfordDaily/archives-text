## Transfer student apathy on the rise Stanford tries to build community for transfers 
### KATE ABBOTT 
While the number of transfer stu
dents in universities is growing across
the nation, these students are also
becoming increasingly apathetic
toward their new colleges, according
to the newly released National
Survey of Student Engagement. The
study also found that more and more
universities are attempting to address
this issue.
The study, also known as "Nessie,"
found that 40 percent of seniors who
responded had transferred from one
university to another during their col
lege experience, and that these stu
dents generally lack involvement in
academics and campus activities
when compared to students who
attended a university for all four
years.
Over the last two years. Stanford's
acceptance rate of transfers has
stayed between one and two percent
— and the application of Nessie's
findings to Stanford's small number
of transfer students is questionable,
according to Coordinator of Transfer
Advising Sally Mentzer.
"I've noticed in the last two years
[that] what that small group does is
create a real sense of community,"
Mentzer said. "From my perspective,
I don't see any alienation, even [of]
those who live off campus."
The small group of incoming
transfer students reside together in
Kimball Hall, except for those older
students who opt to live off campus
— typically in nearby Escondido
Village.
Transfer students also participate
in New Student Orientation along
with the incoming freshman class, and
certain events during NSO cater
specifically to transfer student needs.

This outreach process continues
throughout all of a transfer's years at
Stanford.
"I choose advisors very carefully,"
Mentzer said. "I read all of [the stu
dents'] essays and choose [advisors]
based on academic experience, but
also personal experience. I choose
people who will be with [the trans
fers] no matter what and with them as
their interests change."
Nessie investigates the claim that
colleges across the country are work
ing to ease the transition for transfer
students, and Mentzer emphasized
Stanford's attentiveness to all stu
dents. including transfers, through
outreach programs and special
events.
"I see them involved in various
activities and winning fellowships and
going abroad." Mentzer said. "ITiere
needs to be something in place [for
transfers] at schools because they're a
very specific population and a fasci
nating one, too."
Peter Williams "()9 transferred to
Stanford as a sophomore from
Amherst. He said that while he
enjoys Stanford, during his sopho
more year he was, in fact, apathetic to
the experience. Williams attributed
his malaise to the treatment of fresh
men and transfers together at
Stanford and a "bad living situation."
'They catered to more of a fresh
man experience, and 1 didn't really
want to do that all over again," he
said. "What helped me the most was
not thinking of myself as a transfer,
but thinking of myself as a sopho
more. Not having the transfer as a
part of mv identitv has helped a great
deal."
Nessie also found that transfer stu
dents in general tend to communicate
less with faculty and are less likely to
work with their peers outside of the
classroom, yet levels of academic
challenge are indistinguishable.
Williams said that being a transfer did
not affect his academic preparedness

at all.
Mentzer believes that the transfer
students here do become attached to
the University because of the oppor
tunities it allows its students. The 2009
Princeton Review's ranking of
Stanford as No. 1 in "best classroom
experience" and No. 6 in student hap
piness reaffirms the notion that the
transfer experience on campus is
much more involved than at other
schools.
"Stanford has such a reputation,"
she said, "it's on many people's dream
list."
This is true for students who trans
fer from community colleges, as well.
According to Mentzer. almost half of
the transfers enrolled this year came
from a junior or community college.
She said that this and many other fac
tors. including "the style of Stanford
versus its sister schools," draw in
transfers and keep them on campus.
Kimball Resident Assistant
Dimitri Alves '10 said "missing out on
the freshman experience just sucks,"
but that Stanford offers plenty of
opportunities for transfer students to
get involved, if they are willing to do
so.
Alves transferred from the Air
Force Academy to a community col
lege. and from there to Stanford last
year. He helped to coordinate the
transfer events during NSO, including
a transfer-advisor lunch.
"With my experience, Stanford is
always there to help us feel more wel
come," Alves said. "When there's
something more we think they could
do. they're always open to feedback.
"I don't think the word 'apathetic'
is the word I would use to describe
myself or any of the transfers 1 know."
he added. "We're all really excited to
be here: we don't want to be consid
ered transfers at all. We just want to
be Stanford students."
