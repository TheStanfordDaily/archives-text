## Editorial Administrative Web sites fail to make cut 
### 
Enrollment for winter quarter classes
opened on Monday, and the editorial
board hopes that students will have a
little more luck registering on Axess than they
did this fall, just after Axess was upgraded
from People Soft 8.0 software to People Soft
9.0.
The newer version of Axess combines
what were previously several tabs into a new
"student center." Unfortunately, what was
meant as a simplification of the Web site has
only made Axess all the more complicated
and hard to use. This student center is signifi
cantly more confusing than the previous tab
system because it combines all of the previ
ously separate features into one cluttered sec
tion.
Additionally, when students go to register
for classes, they are now confronted with a
much more complex process than that which
faced them when registering for last spring
quarter's classes. Instead of being able to di
rectly enroll in a course, students must first
add classes to their "class picks," and then con
tinue to actual enrollment on the next Web
page.
Adding classes to "class picks," a category
that does not seem to serve much useful pur
pose,is highly counterintuitive,and it is easy to
see how many students were astounded to
find that they hadn't officially enrolled in fall
quarter classes — sometimes after the add
deadline.
Another change to the new Axess inter
face allows students to enroll in sections
through Axess, rather than only being able to
enroll in sections through Coursework, which
also fulfills several administrative functions
for classes. Some students and professors alike
felt blindsided when they eventually realized
that students must enroll in sections separate
ly. and a few students found themselves con
spicuously absent from the official lists of their
sections.
Coursework, of course, poses its own prob
lems as well. Many professors utilize Course
work to post important information about
their classes such as office hours and grades, as
well as to share class materials including lec
ture slides, exam reviews and syllabi. Addi
tionally, Coursework has a built in testing
component that professors can use for prob
lem sets or quizzes.
Unfortunately, this testing component has
not been working properly this fall, and the
Coursework homepage states that there have
been "intermittent scoring errors." particular
ly in the multiple-choice/multiple-selection
sections of online assignments.
It would be unfortunate if students were
forced to redo their assignments because of a
computer glitch, and it would be equally un
fortunate if all of their hard work were simply

tossed out t he window due to a Hawed grading
key.
Stanford is failing to provide its students
with useful, efficient technology that actually
helps streamline the administrative processes
so that students can focus on one of the most
important parts of their education: academics.
ITie academic administrative Web sites that
students find truly useful are, ironically, the
ones being run by students themselves.
Both www.stanfordcourses.com and
www.courserank.com are student-developed
sites that assist with finding classes. While the
Web sites use Stanford's secure Web login
procedures to ensure that only Stanford stu
dents are using the sites, neither is directly run
by the University.
Stanford Courses provides a course search
that allows students to search by specific crite
ria including what days of the week specific
classes meet and which requirements they ful
fill. It also lists hot courses, provides course
ratings, allows you to sell used books and has
a four-year planner that calculates GPA and
tracks GERs.
Courseßank. which is similar but more
aesthetically appealing, has three main tabs:
browse, plan and community. When students
want to browse, they can search courses, com
pare courses, find courses that fulfill specific
GERs and look up statistics. These statistics
provide further information about which
courses are rated the most highly, which are
reviewed the most often and which are the
most popular.The site boasts 134.000 evalua
tions and a tidy layout that presents the
course summary (when it's offered), average
grade, reviews and more, all on one page.
Courseßank also keeps track of students'
quarterly schedule, four-year plan (including
GPA and GERs) and requirements, in addi
tion to letting them post questions and sell
books.
Why can't Stanford, located in the heart of
Silicon Valley and alma mater of alumni who
have founded technological icons like Google
and Yahoo!, come up with something to
match sites created by students?The editorial
board is concerned that the most useful tech
nological tools for students are being devel
oped solely bv students, with little or no aid
from the University other than providing ac
cess to course information.
We urge the administrators of Stanford to,
at the very least, come up with a system that
efficiently matches the utility of tools for en
rolling in courses and managing assignments
that these student sites have achieved. Failing
that, we plead that the University hand such
projects over to student developers, who
would probably do a fantastic job at a much
lower cost, and fully support their develop
ment of the Stanford Web.
