Don't you get sick of being constantly
pummeled with advertising meant for
your demographic? I do. That's why I
sometimes opt for Maxim Magazine instead
of Elle or Cosmo — not only is it ridiculous
ly entertaining, hut I can also sit back and
enjoy the entertainment in comfortable as
surance that none of the ads are directed at
me.
For those unfortunate readers who have
not yet picked up a copy of Maxim. 1 he mag
azine is oriented towards your average bro
and slightly older men who wish they could
still act like bros:the lucrative. 18- 10 34-year
old male demographic. As a male-interest
magazine, most of the content has to do with
girls, cars, sports and gadgets. Yet there is an
other less obvious trend in the magazine that
shows up throughout the advertisements —
almost every other ad in the magazine is for
alcohol. In fact, the amount of times alcohol
is advertised in Maxim is quite similar to the
number of make-up ads in Cosmo, as if alco
hol were a product unique to the male iden
tity.
I don't know if my fellow Maxim readers
have noticed this, but I have to admit that,
from a male standpoint, the alcohol ads in the
magazine are extremely appealing. (Come
on guys, you know it doesn't take much more
than a sexy girl and some cool graphics to
catch your eye — especially when you're
reading the magazine to look for sexy girls
anyway). But there was one that especially
caught my eye in this month's issue. It was an
ad for Jim Bean Whiskey.a part of their"The
Stuff Inside" campaign. With a two-page
spread and the text printed in big,capital let
ters, it was hard to miss ... even with no hot
chicks in sight.
On the first page of the ad, the backdrop
is a rustic woodcarving of a bald eagle; on the

second, it is a bottle of Jim Bean bourbon.
The text of the ad is distributed across the
two pages, to be read in a left-to-right pro
gression: "President Truman drank a glass of
bourbon every day/llien he kicked the com
mies out of South Korea."
A short message follows at the foot of the
second page that emphasizes the essential
"American-ness" of bourbon and briefly
mentions the campaign's theme and title,
" The Stuff Inside." What exactly is "the stuff
inside?" On the ad campaign's Web site,
www.thestuffinside.com. Jim Bean an
nounces that its campaign is meant as a cele
bration of "people with true character." So
whom did the Jim Bean campaign pick to
showcase in their ad as the American with
the most exemplary character?
Why, President Truman, of course — be
cause he kicked the "commies" out of South
Korea.
The "us vs. them," anti-Communist logic
of this ad is so reminiscent of the Cold War
that it almost seems out of place, even alien
ating, in a magazine like Maxim. After all. the
median age of Maxim readers is 27 — men
born in the closing decade of the Cold War.
Hie worldview in this ad is simply not the
worldview of the Maxim generation ... or is
it?
Being a part of the majority group that
makes up the Maxim generation, Generation
Y. I grew up free of the 20th century Ameri
can antipathy towards communism.The ide
ological opposition of my generation was in
stead directed towards the new enemy of
democracy for the 21st century — religious
right-wing extremism, represented by a
group commonly known as "the terrorists."
We now treat this group with no-questions
asked animosity, much like the "commies"
were treated back in the day. So even though

we Gen-Y-ers may not get fired up at the
mention of communism, we are just like our
baby boomer parents in one important re
spect: we have been conditioned to support
the polarization between us and a group of
people that we barely understand.
With this mindset as our default, it's no
wonder that the Bush administration was
able to convince us that going to war was the
only solution to our problems. But because
we never took the time to properly under
stand our enemy, we are not even at war with
the people who attacked us in the first place.
So Maxim readers, maybe this ad does
have a rightful place in the pages of your
magazine — but it is also trying to manipu
late you. and not in the good, honest way of
using a good-looking woman. This ad wants
you to equate true male character with hawk
ishness by promoting the gender stereotype
that it is not masculine to "go soft" on issues
like war. Yet you are proud members of Gen-
Y, the generation that helped elect the na
tion's first African-American president.
Many of you had a hand in that achievement,
which makes me think that tolerance and
thoughtfulness may be just as masculine as
— dare I say it — fighting other men.
So why don't we show everyone that this
is the generation that won't let history repeat
itself? Gen-Y. let's go back to making in
formed decisions and viewing war as the very
last resort — let's choose to represent the
America that represents the best in us.

zine choices and want to form a support group,
