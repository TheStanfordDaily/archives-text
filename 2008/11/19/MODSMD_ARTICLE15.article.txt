## Where did all my friends go? 
### 
Even the most bitter, grumpy Luddites
among us cannot deny the fact that the
Internet brings people together.
Thanks to the likes of Facebook. MySpace,
AlM,Skype and 4chan.we can communicate
with more people and in more ways than
ever before.
Our new friends can be from places as far
flung as Helsinki, Finland or Tokyo. Japan.
They can be black or white, gay or straight,
living or dead. On sites like Catbook and
Fuzzster, these people don't even have to be
people.
Indeed, the Internet has forever changed
the nature of human — and non-human —
interaction.
Only on the Internet, after all. can two
grotesque, unemployed adult men living in
their mothers' basements come together and
convince each other that one is a lean, ripped
Abercrombie model with piercing blue eyes
and windswept hair and that the other is a pe
tite Russian dancer and lingerie model
named Natalia.
Only online can two racist pinheads from
entirely different parts of the country skip
their family dinners and come together on
some message board to make fun of other
people for hours on end.
And only because of the cinematic mas
terpieces strewn about the Web can a poor,
sad college freshman work up the courage to
ask his French teacher for "extra credit."
In the face of these wired, technological
ly enhanced super-relationships, it can be
easy to find fault with boring,ordinary real
life relationships. For instance, it's no big
deal to hold 10 or more conversations at
once online (frequent practice during the
"AIM hours" of our halcyon middle-school
days), but in real life, it's difficult to have
more than one.
And there are other problems, too.
Real life isn't searchable. Nor is it color
coded. In real life, you can't copy and paste
the content of a conversation with some guv
you know to the girl he likes. Nor can you
Photoshop away your zits. And, worst of all.
you can't be as mean as you can online

(someone might actually punch you).
The list goes on.
Many people deal with these shortcom
ings by turning their real-life relationships
into nothing more than conversations about
the latest happenings online (all the while
posing for Facebook pictures). This subordi
nation of the real world by the online world
is a laudable step, but I believe more can be
done.
With sites like slydial.com. we can begin
to extend the dirty, underhanded, antisocial
nature of the "social Web" to our actual so
cial lives. Not content to upset people by ex
cluding them from your MySpaceTop Eight,
you can wreak havoc with the help of this
wonderful new Web service.
Slydial is a voice messaging application
you can use on,say,your iPhone.that enables
you to connect directly to someone else's
voicemail. In other words, you can leave a
message without the risk of anyone actually
answering the phone.
The Web page for Slydial lists a number
of example uses, many of which seem rea
sonable. Quite a few, however, have to do

with avoiding awkwardness, like "Create
the illusion of communication" or "Just tell
your side of the story." This clearly allows
for an exciting expansion of the technologi
cally enabled dishonesty of the Internet into
real life.
A similar site is wakerupper.com. After
you enter a phone number, a time and some
text, Wakerupper will,at the designated time,
call the designated number and read your
text to the poor person answering. The free
service is supposedly intended to provide
handy reminders to do certain things at cer
tain times, but it's clearly much more useful
for anonymously telling Joe that Jane "total
ly wants to get with you."
While sites like Slvdial. Wakerupper and
inspot.org — a service that allows you to
send anonymous e-cards to people you may
have infected with STDs ("Roses are red.
Violets are blue. I have an STD. You may
too.") — may have some positive uses, they
are far more important as part of an encour
aging new wave of Web sites that allow you
to take underhanded shortcuts in your per
sonal life.
1, for one, can't wait for the inevitable
brave new era of human relationships her
alded by these sites — an era of sly tricks,
hurt feelings and lots of carpal tunnel.
