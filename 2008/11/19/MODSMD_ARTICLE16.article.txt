## MATADORS MAIMED Card wins home opener, 103-85 
### JACK SALISBURY DESK EDITOR 
If every game goes the way lues
day night's went. Johnny Dawkins is
going to like coaching at Stanford.
ITie new Cardinal head coach re
ceived a warm welcome in his first
game at Maples Pavilion — the Sixth
Man Club was even chanting his
name during the game's waning mo
ments — as Stanford passed the cen
tury mark in a 103-85 win over Cat
State-Northridge last night.
"It was great: 1 really enjoyed it,"
Dawkins said. "Our crowd was terrif
ic. I think they gave us energy, espe
cially at times when Northridge had
momentum. It was a great experience
for me."
Senior shooting guard Anthony
Goods led a balanced Cardinal at
tack, scoring 25 points on the night; 11
of them came from the charity stripe.
"Anthony is a scorer — he's not
just a shooter." Dawkins said."l think
he showed that tonight. He's a very
versatile player for a scorer, and I re
ally like what he's doing. I le's picking
his spots real well."
All five starters finished the game
with double digits in points, helping
Stanford fight off a pesky Northridge
squad that won 20games last year and
is picked to win its conference, the Big
West.
"The way our offense is built,
everybody's touching the ball."
Goods said of the team's balance on
offense. "Everybody's really un
selfish. We're all going to get our
chance to score."
"We have some guys that are ter
rific at what they do. but to be success
ful, you have to have a balanced of
fense," Dawkins said. "That showed
up tonight when you look at the box
score."
Dawkins said that the biggest dif
ference between last year's team and
this year's team would be the pace of
the offense. Judging from Tuesday
night, he kept his word.
Stanford had no problem putting
the ball in the hoop throughout the
game,scoring 52 points in the first half
and 51 in the second. Goods' perform
ance was backed up by junior wing

Landry Fields (18 points), senior for
ward Lawrence Hill (14 points),soph
omore center Josh Owens (14 points)
and senior point guard Mitch Johnson
(14 points).
L.ike Goods, the rest of the Cardi
nal starting five made its living at the
free throw line:TTie team shot 47 free
throws, making 40 of them.
Unlike last year's plodding of
fense. which relied on the one- (or
two-) dimensional attack of the
Lopez twins down low, the offense
Dawkins' squad showed Tuesday
night was based more heavily on ball
movement and dribble penetration.
Many believed that the Lopez twins'
departure would be devastating to the
Cardinal coming into the season; but,
as Goods explained, it may have actu
ally opened things up on offense.
"TTie twins clogged up a lot of
paint," he said. "We've got great spac
ing now. it opens up the driving lanes."
The win was not as easy as the
score might indicate, however.
Stanford jumped out to a 43-25
lead over the Matadors midway
through the first half, but the lead
would get no bigger. Northridge kept
pace with the Cardinal from that
point on. tying the game at 56 with 15
minutes left in the second half. Hie
game was later tied at 70. but the
Matadors were never able to take the
lead and an 11-2 Stanford run effec
tively put the game away.
Matador point guard Josh Jenkins
had his way with the Cardinal back
court. though, scoring 24 points. He
fouled out with five minutes to go and
his team down 13, however, and Stan
ford cruised to victory from then on
out.
All in all, Tuesday night's game
marked a smooth start to the
Dawkins' era on the Farm,as the Car
dinal faithful walked away pleasantly
surprised. Dawkins, however, was too
focused to hear the appreciation.
"I don't really catch those things as
well," he said of the student section
chanting his name. "When I'm into
the game, I get lost. I didn't really
catch them chanting my name."
