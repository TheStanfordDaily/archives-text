### JEFF LU 
The Stanford men's volleyball team
wrapped up its fall season this weekend in
Irvine. Calif. With a 2-2 tournament record
under its belt, the team now heads into the win
ter break in high spirits. Propelled by a strong
offensive effort, the Cardinal battled through
the UC Irvine Fall Invitational with wins over
fellow Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) teams UC-Irvine and UC-Santa Bar
bara, and with close losses to UC-San Diego

and CSU-Northridge.
On Saturday, Stanford opened its two-day
run at the tournament with a 3-1 (30-27,30-22,
22-30,30-26) rout of UC-Santa Barbara. Junior
Evan Romero hit 53 percent to lead the team
with 22 kills. He was supported on the other
end by a pair of outside hitters, junior Spencer
McLachlin and sophomore Jason Palacios,
who contributed six and five kills respectively.
Almost immediately thereafter, the Cardi
nal scrimmaged against last year's No. 11 team.
UC-San Diego, losing 28-30,25-30 in a best-of

three match. Junior lid Howell and sophomore
lan Connolly lead Stanford with eight and six
kills, respectively, but the Cardinal was unable
to overcome the Tritons.
Cal State Northridge, ranked No. 3 in the
MPSF last season, proved itself a worthy ad
versary once again this year.The MPSF Cham
pionship semi-finalist, which swept Stanford 3-
0 in the quarterfinals last April, triumphed
once again,albeit in a tightly contested 3-1 vic
tory. After losing the first set 25-30. Stanford
rallied to overwhelm Northridge, 30-28 in the

second set. Despite fine offensive efforts by the
front row, including another team-leading 11
kills by Romero and seven kills each by
McLachlin and senior Brandon Williams, the
Cardinal buckled under Northridge's offen
sive pressure, losing the next two sets in 28-30,
36-38 nail-biters.
"A very strong Northridge team beat us last
year, and this year their team is just as good if
not better," Stanford Head Coach John Kosty
