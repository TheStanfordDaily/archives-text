# MEN'S VOLLEYBALL
## Stanford men conclude fall season 
### JEFF LU 
The Stanford men's volleyball team
wrapped up its fall season this weekend in
Irvine. Calif. With a 2-2 tournament record
under its belt, the team now heads into the win
ter break in high spirits. Propelled by a strong
offensive effort, the Cardinal battled through
the UC Irvine Fall Invitational with wins over
fellow Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) teams UC-Irvine and UC-Santa Bar
bara, and with close losses to UC-San Diego

and CSU-Northridge.
On Saturday, Stanford opened its two-day
run at the tournament with a 3-1 (30-27,30-22,
22-30,30-26) rout of UC-Santa Barbara. Junior
Evan Romero hit 53 percent to lead the team
with 22 kills. He was supported on the other
end by a pair of outside hitters, junior Spencer
McLachlin and sophomore Jason Palacios,
who contributed six and five kills respectively.
Almost immediately thereafter, the Cardi
nal scrimmaged against last year's No. 11 team.
UC-San Diego, losing 28-30,25-30 in a best-of

three match. Junior lid Howell and sophomore
lan Connolly lead Stanford with eight and six
kills, respectively, but the Cardinal was unable
to overcome the Tritons.
Cal State Northridge, ranked No. 3 in the
MPSF last season, proved itself a worthy ad
versary once again this year.The MPSF Cham
pionship semi-finalist, which swept Stanford 3-
0 in the quarterfinals last April, triumphed
once again,albeit in a tightly contested 3-1 vic
tory. After losing the first set 25-30. Stanford
rallied to overwhelm Northridge, 30-28 in the

second set. Despite fine offensive efforts by the
front row, including another team-leading 11
kills by Romero and seven kills each by
McLachlin and senior Brandon Williams, the
Cardinal buckled under Northridge's offen
sive pressure, losing the next two sets in 28-30,
36-38 nail-biters.
"A very strong Northridge team beat us last
year, and this year their team is just as good if
not better," Stanford Head Coach John Kosty
said."Northridge is one of the many
strung teams in our league that we
need to learn to overcome in order
to have a shot at the championships."
In spite of its loss, the Cardinal
didn't lose its momentum. On Sun
day at noon, Stanford took on host
UC-Irvine in a heated match that
lead to a tiebreaker and a tough 3-2
(30-27,25-30,30-25,21 -30,15-13) win
for the Cardinal. Romero lead the
way once again with 20 kills,support
ed this time hy two freshmen as Brad
Lawson and Gus Ellis put up 12 and
eight kills respectively. Connolly also
chipped in with a 71 percent hitting
average and six kills.
Kosty was pleased with his team's
overall performance this weekend.
"I was very happy with how we
played this weekend," he said. "We
passed well over the weekend, and
that has been something we have
been inconsistent with in the past."
But the Cardinal coach still saw
room for improvement, citing the
team's serving as one area that need
ed work.
Just as significantly, Stanford's
freshmen squad of five widely recog
nized talents benefited greatly from
the on-court experience it accumu
lated over the course of the weekend.
Dylan Kordic. a freshman out
side/opposite hitter from Manhattan
Beach, contributed six kills in the
UC-San Diego match. Ellis, previ
ously the middle blocker for the
USA Boys Youth National team, hit
an impressive 57 percent for ten kills
during the match against North
ridge, and Lawson, a high school all-
American, notched 12 kills during
the UC-Irvine match. The freshmen
are already proving themselves ef
fective on the court — that, com
bined with the cumulative experi
ence of 15 returning veterans, makes
Kosty optimistic about the Cardi
nal's chances this season.
"We are a championship con
tender this year." he said.
Although the fall season is offi
cially over, the team will still play in
the Cardinal and White scrimmage
at Burnham Pavilion on Friday. At
tendance free to both students and
the general public.
