Stanford football is on an undeniable upswing.
Since Walt I larris was fired two years ago after
a l-l I 200bseason.the program has undergone
a renovation, starting at the top with head
coach Jim Harbaugh, and down through the
rest of the coaching and administrative ranks. Now. not

team never had more than five wins in a season.
But now. with Harbaugh at the helm, the Cardinal is
not only one win away from bowl eligibility for the first
time since the Willingham era. but Stanford's recruiting
is back near the top in the nation as well.The 2009 class
the first which Harbaugh has had complete control
over — is poised to be among at least the top 15 classes
in the nation, with an outside shot of cracking the top 10.
