Stanford football is on an undeniable upswing.
Since Walt I larris was fired two years ago after
a l-l I 200bseason.the program has undergone
a renovation, starting at the top with head
coach Jim Harbaugh, and down through the
rest of the coaching and administrative ranks. Now. not
even two years into their tenure on the Farm. I larbaugh
and his stall have elevated Stanford from the depths of
the Pac-10 —it not all of Division I—back to re
spectability.
Part of the redevelopment process deals with the ex
isting team: improving coaching, training and ultimate
ly the current players. Hut with an ever-changing roster,
new talent from the high school level must be constant
ly evaluated and courted. Recruitment is the frequently

unseen side of college football, and the process is as in
tricate as it is lengthy. In order to (re)build a program,a
coach must not only be able to manage his team in prac
tice and games — he must also be able to draw top ath
letes to his school.
Since the departure of Ty Willingham after the 2001
season, Stanford's recruiting has been mired in medioc
rity. I larris and his predecessor, Buddy Teevens, put to
gether classes that were ranked only as high as No. 26 in
the country, and fell as low as No. 43. Hie once-proud
Cardinal football team suffered accordingly. In the five
years that Teevens and Harris coached Stanford, the
team never had more than five wins in a season.
But now. with Harbaugh at the helm, the Cardinal is
not only one win away from bowl eligibility for the first
time since the Willingham era. but Stanford's recruiting
is back near the top in the nation as well.The 2009 class
the first which Harbaugh has had complete control
over — is poised to be among at least the top 15 classes
in the nation, with an outside shot of cracking the top 10.
This dramatic shift is the result of over two years of
continuous work on each recruiting class. As a result,
even though the 2007 and 200 X recruits were signed

when Harbaugh was the helm, he
was not with them throughout the
entire process.
"It doesn't happen overnight,"
said recruiting coordinator and de
fensive line coach Lance Anderson,
who came with Harbaugh from the
University of San Diego.
Indeed. Recruiting is a seemingly
endless endeavor, and one to which
countless man-hours are devoted; re
cruiting assistant Jordan Paopao es
timated the he works 12-15 hours a
day.
Harbaugh felt that this devotion
separated his staff from their prede

cessors.
"We put in a lot of man hours."
Harbaugh said.
It's not hard to see why:The staff
is frequently working on at least two
classes at a time.
"We're really focused on 2009
right now, and have some commits,"
Anderson said. "We're also doing a
lot to identify prospects from the
Class of 2010."
The recruiting process generally
begins in a player's sophomore year
of high school. Harbaugh, Anderson
and the rest of the staff start by pars
ing down a list of 3,000-4,000 high
school players per class who are con
sidered talented enough to play Di
vision-I football.
"High school coaches and Inter
net services recommend players,"
Harbaugh said. "We then identify
BCS caliber athletes."
After evaluating each player's
skill set — the football office has en
tire bookshelves filled with game
tapes — as well as the team's needs
and. perhaps most importantly, the
recruit's academic standing, the list is
whittled down to 100 players that the
staff will focus on. The coaches hope
to land around a quarter of those
athletes.
