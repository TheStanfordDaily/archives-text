# One going up, one going down

So Big Game is hack and bigger
than ever. Why? Well, probably
because this year it's actually
important. And not just in the Pacif
ic- 10 Conference standings or as the
Cardinal's chance at its first bowl
game since 2001.
No. Big Game is finally big again
because of what's at stake off the
field for Stanford and Cal in the
arena of public perception.
Believe it or not, this is probably a
down year as far as the overall star
power of the game is concerned.This,
despite the fact that for the first time
in years it looks like it will have actu
al significance beyond bragging
rights for both teams involved. But
beyond the coaches and Toby Ger
hart, there really aren't players in the
Marshawn Lynch-Trent Edwards-
Aaron Rodgers stratosphere of col
legiate stardom.
But regardless, this game could
represent a sea-change in the public
perceptions of both programs.
Stanford, a perennial doormat for
the last half -decade, has finally got
ten to the point where it is ready to
ascend to the realm of Pacific-10
Conference relevancy once again
make no mistake,a .500 record.a win
over Cal and a postseason bowl cou
pled with a quotable personality at
Head Coach like Jim Harbaugh
would mean you might even see
Stanford football on Sports Center
now and again next year.
And as for Cal? Well, let's just say
that after the halcyon days the Bears
found themselves in just a few short
years ago. the tumble from near the
top has been steep indeed. Once, Cal
was perceived as being just a short
step away from the top of the college
football world. Yes. there was I JSC to
overcome, but year in and year out
the Bears were considered the
biggest threats to the Trojans' domi
nance.
And now? The explosive offen
sive persona the Bears' once pos
sessed has been passed on. Teams
like Missouri and Florida run the
quirky, high-octane offenses now
that have pundits predicting future
glory for their programs while Cal
has become a west coast after
thought. Once, the perception was
that any year now. the Bears would
ascend to Pac-10 supremacy over the
crumpled form of their IJSC foes.
Now? The general consensus
seems more to be that we're watch
ing a Bears program that's gradually
slipping backwards. Meaning this
Saturday we'll be witnessing the con
vergence of a team on the rise with a
team in decline, meeting at the tip
ping point in a rivalry as old as the
sport itself.
A win for the Cardinal would
mean an even finish for the teams on
opposite sides of the Bay,as both Cal
and Stanford would end the year at
6-6. But make no mistake about it.
not all .500 records are created equal.
Don't believe me? Consider the
emotion that would be present on
the Stanford sidelines after a win
over the team's archrivals to capture
a bowl bid. ( onsider how that would
translate in terms of postseason cov
erage. in terms of extra practice for
the team, in terms of recruiting. Con
sider just how drastically perceptions
of a Stanford squad that was as low as
a major conference team could pos
sibly sink just two short years ago
would be on the rise.
And then consider how Cal would
feci about it. Another loss to Stan
ford would be a clear signal that the
Bears' window is closing or perhaps
already has. If Cal can't be the best
team in Northern California, what
hope docs it have of being the best
team in the Pac-10. where Southern
Cal, Oregon and Oregon State show
no signs of falling off any time soon.
And Stanford could return it's first
1,000 yard rusher in a decade and
pair him with its most highly touted
young quarterback since Trent Fid
wards next season as Andrew Luck
would be expected to step into the
foreground after redshirting his
freshman year.
No, Big Games have often been
big. but rarely have they offered such
a clear picture of two programs walk
ing the same path in opposite direc
tions and meeting in the middle. If
Cal can turn the tide, perhaps they

Griffin
Rants and Raves
can avert the end of its dominance in
Northern California for another
year or more. But if Stanford wins,
well, then the rout is officially on.

Denis Griffin is rather happy about
the state of the Cal and Stanford foot
hall programs. Chat with him about it
at djgriff@stanford.edu.
