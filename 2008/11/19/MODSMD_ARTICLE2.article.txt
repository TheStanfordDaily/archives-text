## ELECTION '08 Professors look at the election's place in history 
### JULIA BROWNELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Two weeks ago. on the day after the
Nov. 4 presidential election, students
tried their best to preserve the events of
the previous night in their memories.
Now. the question remains: How will
history remember the 2008 election?
Professor of Political Science Simon
Jackman and Hoover Institute Senior
Fellow Morris Fiorina are known to be
experts on elections, and offered "Hie
Daily their perspectives on the signifi
cance of this presidential campaign and
the future Obama administration.
Jackman thought Barack Obama's
status as the first black president alone
merits deeming this election a historic
one.
"I think the election of an African

American has so much significance in
and of itself that people will hold up the
'OS election and put it on a pedestal." he
said.
Fiorina, on the other hand, thought
the real significance of the election
won't be known until we find out how
Obama does once he is in office.
"Ultimately, he's got to deliver."
Fiorina asserted.
Both Fiorina and Jackman empha
sized that they believed a Democrat
would almost certainly win the election
after the last eight years under Cieorge
W. Bush's presidency. John McCain's
campaign, they said. had such a huge
hurdle to clear that the Arizona senator
barely had a chance.
"I've been saying forever. 'No
Republican can win this election,'"
Fiorina said.
"It was not so much embracing
Obama—l mean it's partly that —
but a lot of it's just a break with the
past eight years." Jackman added.
In addition to a desire for change
from the past eight years of govern
ment. both professors thought the
economy played a large role in the
outcome of this election. They felt
that the way the current financial cri
sis plays out will shape how history
looks back upon the campaign.
Fiorina put it simply.
"It's all about the economy," he
said.
Jackman looked forward to the
way in which the Obama administra
tion will handle the economy, espe
cially the concept of bailouts, which
Obama has come out in support of.
"I think there's a huge roll of the
dice coming in. trying to revive the
American economy," Jackman said.
Both professors recognized that
Obama is faced with incredible chal
lenges. but Jackman was much more
optimistic than Fiorina when dis
cussing the pace of change.
"He's actually going to be able to
get an awful lot done," Jackman said.
"He's going to have a lot of latitude
early on."
Hut Fiorina suggested that the far
left "will probably be disappointed
with the pace of change." I le believes
that during the first 1(H) days of the
administration,Obama will not move
quickly, but instead try to make small
steps towards effective change.

" Iliey will try to show incremen
tal progress." Fiorina said of Obama
and his cabinet.
The professor speculated that the
Obama administration will try to
take action on children's health pro
grams. and will also pursue foreign
contacts quickly.
Both Fiorina and Jackman said
Obama will face a period of time
early on in his administration during
which he will have fairly free reign to
try to implement change without fac
ing harsh criticism.
Fiorina thinks Obama "will have a
longer honeymoon than most," but
Jackman cautioned. "I don't know
when 'early on' stops."
After wide popularity that award
ed him a landslide victory, however.
President-elect Obama may very well
face a turbulent presidency that
could be harshly judged later on.
"At some point, he starts to own
these problems," Jackman said.
For a while. Jackman explained.
Obama could excuse the state of the
country by claiming he inherited the
problems. But soon enough, he
becomes the established president,
and the country will start to attach
problems to him.
Both Fiorina and Jackman were
struck by the severity of the problems
ihe nation faces today. While the elec
tion may be remembered as a mile
stone, both recognized that the
upcoming Obama administration
must deliver, simply because of the
urgency and scope of the problems
awaiting the new president's January
arrival in the White House.
"The true test is yet to come,
frankly." Jackman said.
