## COWBOYS CORRAL CARDINAL Stanford has mixed weekend results 
### ZOE LEAVITT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Wild West is hard to wrangle.
That's the lesson the Stanford
wrestling team learned on Friday,
when the Cardinal fell to Wyoming
despite notching three major wins.
Injuries are still crippling the Cardi
nal's lineup, forcing the team to for
feit their 184-pound and heavy
weight matches. After a final score
on Friday of 34-10, the Cowboy
Open tournament on Saturday gave
some Cardinal wrestlers a chance for
a comeback.
Sophomore Porfirio Madrigal ex
tended his winning streak by remain
ing undefeated in his two matches on
Friday, improving to 4-0 on the year
wrestling at 133 pounds. Despite fac
ing the Cowboy's only returning
NCAA qualifier. Cory VomÃŸaur,
Madrigal managed three takedowns
against his formerly undefeated op
ponent. He emerged victorious, scor
ing three points for his team.
"This year I feel more mat-savvy
and knowledgeable about my
wrestling situations," Madrigal said.
"The most exciting part of my match
was dominating in the third period."
The Cowboys won the next three
matches after Madrigal's, leaving
redshirt freshman Nick
Amuchastegui in a difficult position
for his 165-pound match as he
squared off against Eric Coxbill, the
Cowboys' lone senior.
"We didn't know how he would
respond, as a newer wrestler in that
state, but he didn't let things frustrate
him," Stanford Coach Jason Borrelli
said.
Coxbill took Amuchastegui down
twice in quick succession, bringing
the match scoreboard to 1-4. But the
Stanford freshman refused to sur
render, and scored a takedown in the
match's third period to take the win
with a l >-7 score.
Junior Jake Johnson scored the

Cardinal's only bonus points of the
match, and won an 11-1 major deci
sion against his opponent in the Im
pound weigh class. Since Stanford
forfeited the heavyweight match.
Johnson's was the last bout of the day
and he gave his team a strong finish.
Borrelli believed external factors
might have played some part in the
team's difficulties on Friday.
"The conditioning seemed a little
lackluster." he said."The air is differ
ent there, with the altitude and dry
ness. and it's hard to get acclimated
to the climate. Some guys were get
ting sick."

"This year I
feel more mat
savvy and
knowledgeable."

sophomore

Several young players, however,
showed nice potential for the future
of the team. Freshman Timmy Boone
made his collegiate debut on Friday
in the 141-pound weight class. He did
not perform as well as he had hoped
against Wyoming, falling by major
decision.
"My collegiate wrestling debut
didn't go well as I had planned it
should [have]" Boone said. "I felt 1
could have done much, much better
than I did. but things just didn't work
out right."
Boone more than redeemed him
self in the Cowboy Open on Satur
day by winning three difficult match
es.
"I was a little worried at first, but
he bounced back." Borrelli said.
After Boone's initial disappoint

ment on Friday, lie came out strong
in the Open, pinning his first oppo
nent from Northern Colorado in a
mere 59 seconds. He also won two
more matches over the course of the
day. another by a quick pin and one
by a technical fall.
"[The Cowboy match] definitely
fueled my desire to do better on Sat
urday in the tournament, because I
knew I had more in me than what I
showcased in my loss," he said.
The coaches considered Boone's
Saturday performances to be some
of the day's most exciting highlights.
"112 Ie has good stuff he developed
in high school, now we are trying to
fine tune it." Borrelli said.
Amuchastegui had dominated
the Cowboy Open, finishing 4-0. He
won his first two battles by major de
cision. reaching the semifinals and
heating an Air Force opponent 4-1.
In the finals. Amuchastegui came up
against No. 11 Tyler Sherfey, a Boise
State wrestler who has qualified for
the NCAA Championships three
times. Sherfey was Amuchastegui's
first nationally ranked opponent of
his career. Unfazed, Amuchastegui
defeated him 4-2 to win his first col
legiate title.
The Cowboy Open also brought
an opportunity for revenge to one
Cardinal wrestler,as sophomore Max
Rosefigura faced the same Wyoming
wrestler who had beaten him the day
before. The outcome was better for
Rosefigura the second time around
as he won a 5-4 decision against Cody
Chipperfield at 149 pounds after los
ing 4-0 the day before.
As the only upperclassmen
wrestling for the Cardinal in the
Open. Johnson stepped into a leader
ship role and placed fourth in his
weight class, finishing the day with a
4-2 record.
Overall, 10 wrestlers competed
for the Cardinal in the Open and
took 17 wins throughout the day.The
Cardinal will now look forward to
Sunday's home opener against No.
12 Northwestern in Burnham Pavil
ion. The dual is scheduled to begin at
noon.
