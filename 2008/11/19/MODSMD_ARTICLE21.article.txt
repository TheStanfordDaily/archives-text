face contact with the staff before his
senior year. High school athletes can
take an unlimited number of unoffi
cial visits.
This is where administrators, such
as Mike Eubanks.an assistant athlet
ic director and the director of Foot
ball Administration, make their im
pact on the recruiting process. Eu
banks, who estimates that he spends
95 percent of his time on recruiting,
tries to "make unofficial visits as
close to an official visit as we can."
This entails taking recruits to games,
showing them around campus and
"anticipat[ing] the things that are
going to be important to them."
"[Administrators] can't pick up
the phone and call these kids, and we
can't sit in their living room." Eu
banks said. "But we can be an extra
resource."

This is the groundwork stage of
the process — the sell comes after
July 1 of the summer between a re
cruit's junior and senior years of high
school. Coaches are then allowed to
visit and convince not only the play
er but also his parents that Stanford
is the right place for him.
"It's a trust," Harbaugh said."You
get to be a part of their family. You
have to pledge that you will return
their son as the same young man that
they left with you."
Each coach is assigned a different
area of the country to cover. For ex
ample, D.J. Durkin.the Stanford de
fensive ends and special teams
coach, covers Pittsburgh and At
lanta. while Clayton White, the de
fensive backs coach, covers Los An
geles and Texas. Additionally, when
the team has a road game, the coach
es generally recruit on the Friday be
fore the contest. When the Cardinal
faced TCU, for example, the staff
looked at recruits from Dallas; when
it played Notre Dame, they looked at
Indianapolis and Chicago.
"It's 30 hours a week for guys on
the road," Harbaugh said. And that is
in addition to regular coaching du
ties.
"We're on the road as much as we
can be," Anderson said.
Eubanks' white board proved as
much — at the time of his interview,
he had Harbaugh's flight details up

for a recruiting visit.
It's here that coaches will make
their pitch and try to convince re
cruits to make an official visit, when
Eubanks will, among other activities,
set up meetings with professors and
students.
If the recruit likes what he sees,
then he will make a non-binding ver
bal commitment. If another school
doesn't sway the player in the mean
time, then he will make his intentions
official come February's National
Signing Day.
It is then that the year's class is so
lidified. And not a moment later, the
coaches get back to courting the next
year's group of talent.
