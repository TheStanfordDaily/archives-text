## Water taste, odor impacted Algae blooms hit reservoir; drinkability not affected 
### CARLEE BROWN DESK EDITOR 
In an email sent to campus resi
dents on Friday, Stanford officials
notified students that the campus'
water provider had recently
received a number of complaints
regarding the taste and odor of
drinking water in the Peninsula
and South Bay area.
San Francisco Public Utilities
Commission (SFPIJC), Stanford's
water supplier, said algae blooms
in its Calaveras Reservoir affected
the water's taste and odor.
However, the drinking quality of
the water was not impacted, and
the blooms posed no health risks.
"We constantly monitor the sys
tem, but notice of the bloom came
from [customers'] taste and odor
concerns," said Betsy Lauppe
Rhodes, spokesperson for SFPUC.
Between 10 and 15 customers in
the East Bay and South Bay
regions reportedly filed taste and
odor complaints.
Algal blooms arise about once a
year on average, when warm
weather creates a ripe environ
ment for growth. Unseasonably
warm weather caused the recent
outbreak of algae, which presented
itself unusually quickly. The utility
company took action as soon as it
received taste and odor com
plaints.
"We re-routed the system in
order to not take water from the
reservoir." Lauppe Rhodes said.
According to the SFPUC Web site.
Calaveras is one of the smaller
reservoirs in the utility's system, so
the re-route did not decrease the
availability of water.
However, after a lack of calls
from concerned students, Marty
Laprote, Stanford's associate
director of Utilities for Water
Resources & Environmental
Quality, speculated that much of
the water from Calaveras may not
have made its way to campus.
"It's possible that a lot of the
water that was affected didn't get to
Stanford." Laporte said. "Or, it
might not have been a big bloom."
Laporte continued by saying
both factors may have contributed
to the low amount of taste and odor
complaints on campus, but the
exact reason is uncertain.
Nonetheless, she only received one
call from a concerned water cus
tomerâ€” and the call came from
Palo Alto, not Stanford.
Indeed, most students seemed
to have little concern with the taste
and odor notices they received in
emails from Housing.
"At first. I thought.'That's going
to be annoying,'" said Greg Katz
'09, "but 1 saw it was safe to drink,
so I didn't think it would be so
bad."
"I didn't notice any taste differ
ence." he added.
Danielle Brining 11 said that,
while taste and odor differences
may have bothered others, they did
n't concern her at all.
"I didn't really read [the email],"
she said, "because 1 don't drink
water from the tap."
