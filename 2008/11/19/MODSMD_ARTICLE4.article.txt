# ResEd addresses mental health
## Univ. points to strength of RAs, PHEs, RFs and RDs as responders, but looks to improve NEWS ANALYSIS 
### KAMIL DADA DESK EDITOR 
This is the third of a five-part series this week by The Daily focus
ing on campus mental health, specifically in light of the
University's report released last month. Further stories will look
at the relationship between alcohol trends and mental health
issues, as well as the problems facing students in overcoming the
stigma of mental health.

The Student Mental Health and Well-
Being (MHWB) Task Force released a com
prehensive report on campus mental health
last month, but Residential Education
(ResEd) was sparsely mentioned in the 88-
page document.
The roles of Resident Assistants (RAs) and
Peer Health Educators (PHEs) were brought
up. but there was a notable lack of recommen
dations on how ResEd could make further
improvements. Administrators, residence
deans (RDs) and RAs alike noted that this
was because the ResEd system is already very
strong and successful.
Ira Friedman. Associate Vice Provost for
Student Affairs and Director of Vaden Health
Center, co-chaired the WHWB task force's
policy and practice committee. He strongly
commended the existing role of Res Ed.
"One of the findings of the task force was

the strengths of the safety net in residences, in
the communities that exist" he said.
However, Friedman explained that the
impetus for the MHWB report partly came
due to an accumulation of new situations
ResEd has had to deal with.
"We have folks like RDs who are increas
ingly handling difficult student situations," he
said. "We have students coming in stressed
and overstressed. We have the PHEs who are
trying to deliver programs such as massage
workshops, meditation and distressing. We
know from those experiences ... that things
have gradually been changing."
Even with administrators heaping praise
upon Res Ed. the organization is looking to
make further improvements. Along with a new
director at the start of 2009. there will be more
RDs. enhanced RA training and increased
dorm-related programs put on by PHEs.
New programs
Interim Director of Residential Education
John Pearson said that in the last year. ResEd
received requests from Resident Fellows
(RFs) wanting to look into the issue of well
ness in their communities. As a result. ResEd
aimed to cater to the growing demand by put
ting on new programs.
"In response, there was a week of wellness
in Manzanita last year, which was well
received," he said. "This year, we are providing
pilot funds for FloMo East to have meditation

and yoga classes. [Such programs are] not that
unusual in the history of Res Ed. hut I think it
goes against the perception of what programs
happen in the dorm. So I think RFs are begin
ning to think about how they react in their
communities to the issue of student needs."
ResEd has also been in talks with Vaden
and PHEs about how to reduce students'
stress and live more fulfilling lives.
Carole Pertofsky. director of Wellness and
Health Promotion Services (HPS) at Vaden.
explained that the report's recommendations
tend to address the needs of those students
who face serious mental health problems and
chronic distress, such as depression, anxiety
disorders and despair. In her opinion, those
students benefit most from the clinical servic
es that Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) offers.
Instead, she focused on aspects of the
report that are relevant to the vast majority of
students on campus who are not chronically
distressed, but often feel that they are coping
with too much pressure and not enough fulfill
ment.
"They're good at riding the ups and downs
of the Stanford rollercoaster. but vaguely
know that they want to feel happier, healthier
and more secure." Pertofsky said. "My interest
is in helping the students who are tired of sim
ply "coping" and yearn for a greater sense of
