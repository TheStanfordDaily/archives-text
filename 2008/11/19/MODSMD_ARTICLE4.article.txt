# ResEd addresses mental health
## Univ. points to strength of RAs, PHEs, RFs and RDs as responders, but looks to improve NEWS ANALYSIS 
### KAMIL DADA DESK EDITOR 
This is the third of a five-part series this week by The Daily focus
ing on campus mental health, specifically in light of the
University's report released last month. Further stories will look
at the relationship between alcohol trends and mental health
issues, as well as the problems facing students in overcoming the
stigma of mental health.

The Student Mental Health and Well-
Being (MHWB) Task Force released a com
prehensive report on campus mental health
last month, but Residential Education
(ResEd) was sparsely mentioned in the 88-
page document.
The roles of Resident Assistants (RAs) and
Peer Health Educators (PHEs) were brought
up. but there was a notable lack of recommen
dations on how ResEd could make further
improvements. Administrators, residence
deans (RDs) and RAs alike noted that this
was because the ResEd system is already very
strong and successful.
Ira Friedman. Associate Vice Provost for
Student Affairs and Director of Vaden Health
Center, co-chaired the WHWB task force's
policy and practice committee. He strongly
commended the existing role of Res Ed.
"One of the findings of the task force was

the strengths of the safety net in residences, in
the communities that exist" he said.
However, Friedman explained that the
impetus for the MHWB report partly came
due to an accumulation of new situations
ResEd has had to deal with.
"We have folks like RDs who are increas
ingly handling difficult student situations," he
said. "We have students coming in stressed
and overstressed. We have the PHEs who are
trying to deliver programs such as massage
workshops, meditation and distressing. We
know from those experiences ... that things
have gradually been changing."
Even with administrators heaping praise
upon Res Ed. the organization is looking to
make further improvements. Along with a new
director at the start of 2009. there will be more
RDs. enhanced RA training and increased
dorm-related programs put on by PHEs.
New programs
Interim Director of Residential Education
John Pearson said that in the last year. ResEd
received requests from Resident Fellows
(RFs) wanting to look into the issue of well
ness in their communities. As a result. ResEd
aimed to cater to the growing demand by put
ting on new programs.
"In response, there was a week of wellness
in Manzanita last year, which was well
received," he said. "This year, we are providing
pilot funds for FloMo East to have meditation

and yoga classes. [Such programs are] not that
unusual in the history of Res Ed. hut I think it
goes against the perception of what programs
happen in the dorm. So I think RFs are begin
ning to think about how they react in their
communities to the issue of student needs."
ResEd has also been in talks with Vaden
and PHEs about how to reduce students'
stress and live more fulfilling lives.
Carole Pertofsky. director of Wellness and
Health Promotion Services (HPS) at Vaden.
explained that the report's recommendations
tend to address the needs of those students
who face serious mental health problems and
chronic distress, such as depression, anxiety
disorders and despair. In her opinion, those
students benefit most from the clinical servic
es that Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) offers.
Instead, she focused on aspects of the
report that are relevant to the vast majority of
students on campus who are not chronically
distressed, but often feel that they are coping
with too much pressure and not enough fulfill
ment.
"They're good at riding the ups and downs
of the Stanford rollercoaster. but vaguely
know that they want to feel happier, healthier
and more secure." Pertofsky said. "My interest
is in helping the students who are tired of sim
ply "coping" and yearn for a greater sense of
happiness and well-being."
In response to the report, a new
course entitled "Happiness and
Health" will he offered starting win
ter quarter. Taught by Pertofsky,
Friedman and Richard Luskin, stu
dents will study evidence-based, sci
entific methods to awaken deeper
happiness and well being. In addi
tion, a new workshop called
"Meditations from Around the
World" will be offered for free to
students in winter quarter.
Resident Assistants (RAs)
RA training teaches students to
look for specific signs relating to
mental health problems and ways to
deal with immediate problems.
While the MHWB report has little
mention of RAs, administrators
noted that they were particularly
important and effective in dealing
with mental health issues.
"Our strong team of residential
staff and RAs are key supports for
students in distress," Pearson said.
"They are the first point of contact,
and we are proud of how well they
do their jobs."
Josh Schiller, associate director of
Residential Education, explained
that student mental health and well
being has always been a major com
ponent of training for RAs.
"As is our current practice, we
will review all parts of RA training,
including sessions addressing mental
health and well-being." he said.
"While the report did not make spe
cific recommendations for changes
to RA training, 1 anticipate that
some aspects will change, but the
specifics of those changes will be
worked out in the coming year."
Schiller said that if RAs have
concerns about a student's mental
health, they are expected to consult
early and often with their RF, RD or
a CAPS consultant.
"Through training, RAs are
informed of the campus resources
that are best-equipped to handle a
wide range of mental health con
cerns." he said. "They are trained to
understand that these mental health
concerns are serious and require the
attention of professionally trained
staff."
Pearson echoed Schiller, empha

sizing that RAs are not medically
trained.
"We don't want them to make
diagnoses," he said. "One of the
things we try to work with RAs on is
to notice students who may need
assistance and then be referrers and
resources."
In interviews with The Daily, a
majority of RAs commented on how
the training provided them with suf
ficient tools to deal with mental
health concerns as an initial point of
contact. They said they are taught to
discuss problems with fellow staff
members and felt confident that
they were equipped to handle men
tal health problems.
Former Branner RA Alif
Khalfan "08 felt that ResF.d did a
good job with RA training.
"ResEd tried to do a comprehen
sive job at identifying the potential
problems, including mental health
problems, that you as an RA are
going to face," he said. "They gave us
many concrete ways to solve those
problems, and there were a lot of
role-playing scenarios. The stirdents
who failed the scenarios got assis
tance so they could learn how to
improve."
Khalfan added that training was
already very long and detailed, leav
ing the RAs with little free time, so
additional training could overbur
den some dorm staffers.
"Training involved two weeks of
straight back-to-back training ses
sions that lasted the whole day"he
said. "It was a lot of useful informa
tion to take in."
Marissa Klein'oB,a former RA in
FroSoCo, also agreed that the train
ing was adequate.
"As an RA. I would have been
comfortable with recognizing poten
tial problems and serving as an ini
tial point of contact for a student,"
she said. "I would have known who
to talk to or to whom I needed to
refer the student."
Pearson explained that there is
always room for improvement, and
that over the years. RA training has
changed. He pointed to the
Question, Persuade, Refer (QPR)
training introduced last fall, which
all new RAs go through. ITie OPR
method teaches RAs to learn how
to recognize the warning signs of a
suicide crisis and respond appropri
ately.
"We have had implementation of
OPR. and that's going at full force,"
said Vice Provost for Student Affairs

Greg Boardman.
Pearson further added that the
roles which RAs are required to play
must continue to change to keep up
with the needs of students.
"When 1 first came to Stanford in
the '80s, the role of the RA was
much mofe programmatic, much
more community building," he said.
"Now. in many ways, it has changed
to be working with the RFs and RDs
to be a support network for individ
ual students."
Not all dorm staff, however, felt
that the training adequately pre
pared them to deal with crises in
real-life situations.
"While we were given good train
ing, in practice, dealing with the
sheer number and complexity of
issues was different from simply
learning about them," said a current
Branner RA, who wished to remain
anonymous due to a ResEd policy
preventing active staff from com
menting about their roles.
Residence Dean Arcadio
Morales, who also serves as a
Resident Fellow in Twain and recog
nized the issues facing RFs, similarly
noted that there was a gap between
theory and practice.
"IFiink about your classes: It is
great when you learn it in theory, but
it is really scary when you actually
have to apply it when you are con
fronted with the situation," Morales
said. "It is very similar with the RAs.
But we train them in the best way we
can. We give them all the informa
tion."
Peer Health Educators (PHEs)
Pertofsky explained that PHEs
are central to ensuring residents'
mental health and play many roles in
a dorm. PHEs provide dorm-based
outreach programs and provide con
fidential one-on-one peer counsel
ing, coaching and resource referral
for individual students.
According to Pertofsky. PHEs
engage in intensive training in peer
counseling, coaching and resource
referral.
"They have as many training
hours as Bridge counselors," she
said. "Training includes an eight
hour. day-long training in counsel
ing and coaching skills, and three
hours of academic lectures by clini
cal psychologists on recognizing
signs of distress, followed by on
going role play and case study."
Peer Health Education
Coordinator Jarreau Bowen '07
agreed that PHE training was
extensive, covering a wide range of
issues, including mental health.
"PHEs take a class in the spring
in which they train on mental
health, suicide prevention, physical
health, sexual assault, sexual harass
ment. nutrition and how to deal with
disordered eating and eating disor
ders. peer counseling and coaching,
CPR. First Aid, alcohol education
and many other related health
issues," Bowen said.
Bowen added that the PHEs
meet regularly and have already
met to discuss new ways of respond
ing to the MHWB report. In the
future, PHEs will play a major role
in meeting the recommendations of
the task force for prevention and
outreach.
"They will continue their role as
health advisors on a one-on-one
basis," Pertofsky said. "However, a
new role will be that PHEs will part
ner with HPS to develop new train
ing skills and outreach programs
aimed at the majority of the student
population who want to experience
deeper satisfaction, awaken joy and
manage stress."
Residence Deans (RDs)
To aid PI lEs, RAs and RFs in the
caseload they face, Morales said
Residential Education is actively
considering increasing the number
of RDs on campus.
"One possibility is opening
Crothers for undergrads next year."
he said. "There would be an RD
there. Having one of us there on
hand, as a consultant, would be very
helpful."
Pearson explained that there
have already been a number of
practical changes for Residence
Deans.
"Beginning last academic year
'07-' OB, we added a sixth permanent
RD," he said. "This allowed the num
ber of students within any RD
cohort to be reduced. The addition
gave the RDs a little more time to
work with students and deal with the
increased cases and complexities."
While much is already being
done in terms of mental health,
ResEd is always looking to make
further improvements. Pertofsky
explained that when the new ResEd
director arrives in January. HPS
plans on creating even more specific
dorm-based PHE roles, programs
and services. Further, they are con
sidering additional staffing to imple
ment some of the report's recom
mendations. but it may not be possi
ble given the current economic situ
ation.
"We are clearly in tough budget
ary times, and until the economy sta
bilizes. it's not possible to address
this question," she said. "[However],
I am confident that the well-being of
our students is a University priority,
and, to that end, resources will be
dedicated toward that purpose."

health concerns as an initial point of
contact. They said they are taught to
discuss problems with fellow staff
members and felt confident that
they were equipped to handle men
tal health problems.
Former Branner RA Alif
Khalfan "08 felt that ResF.d did a
good job with RA training.
"ResEd tried to do a comprehen
sive job at identifying the potential
problems, including mental health
problems, that you as an RA are
going to face," he said. "They gave us
many concrete ways to solve those
problems, and there were a lot of
role-playing scenarios. The stirdents
who failed the scenarios got assis
tance so they could learn how to
improve."
Khalfan added that training was
already very long and detailed, leav
ing the RAs with little free time, so
additional training could overbur
den some dorm staffers.
"Training involved two weeks of
straight back-to-back training ses
sions that lasted the whole day"he
said. "It was a lot of useful informa
tion to take in."
Marissa Klein'oB,a former RA in
FroSoCo, also agreed that the train
ing was adequate.
"As an RA. I would have been
comfortable with recognizing poten
tial problems and serving as an ini
tial point of contact for a student,"
she said. "I would have known who
to talk to or to whom I needed to
refer the student."
Pearson explained that there is
always room for improvement, and
that over the years. RA training has
changed. He pointed to the
Question, Persuade, Refer (QPR)
training introduced last fall, which
all new RAs go through. ITie OPR
method teaches RAs to learn how
to recognize the warning signs of a
suicide crisis and respond appropri
ately.
"We have had implementation of
OPR. and that's going at full force,"
said Vice Provost for Student Affairs

Greg Boardman.
Pearson further added that the
roles which RAs are required to play
must continue to change to keep up
with the needs of students.
"When 1 first came to Stanford in
the '80s, the role of the RA was
much mofe programmatic, much
more community building," he said.
"Now. in many ways, it has changed
to be working with the RFs and RDs
to be a support network for individ
ual students."
Not all dorm staff, however, felt
that the training adequately pre
pared them to deal with crises in
real-life situations.
"While we were given good train
ing, in practice, dealing with the
sheer number and complexity of
issues was different from simply
learning about them," said a current
Branner RA, who wished to remain
anonymous due to a ResEd policy
preventing active staff from com
menting about their roles.
Residence Dean Arcadio
Morales, who also serves as a
Resident Fellow in Twain and recog
nized the issues facing RFs, similarly
noted that there was a gap between
theory and practice.
"IFiink about your classes: It is
great when you learn it in theory, but
it is really scary when you actually
have to apply it when you are con
fronted with the situation," Morales
said. "It is very similar with the RAs.
But we train them in the best way we
can. We give them all the informa
tion."
Peer Health Educators (PHEs)
Pertofsky explained that PHEs
are central to ensuring residents'
mental health and play many roles in
a dorm. PHEs provide dorm-based
outreach programs and provide con
fidential one-on-one peer counsel
ing, coaching and resource referral
for individual students.
According to Pertofsky. PHEs
engage in intensive training in peer
counseling, coaching and resource
referral.
"They have as many training
hours as Bridge counselors," she
said. "Training includes an eight
hour. day-long training in counsel
ing and coaching skills, and three
hours of academic lectures by clini
cal psychologists on recognizing
signs of distress, followed by on
going role play and case study."
Peer Health Education
Coordinator Jarreau Bowen '07
agreed that PHE training was
extensive, covering a wide range of
issues, including mental health.
"PHEs take a class in the spring
in which they train on mental
health, suicide prevention, physical
health, sexual assault, sexual harass
ment. nutrition and how to deal with
disordered eating and eating disor
ders. peer counseling and coaching,
CPR. First Aid, alcohol education
and many other related health
issues," Bowen said.
Bowen added that the PHEs
meet regularly and have already
met to discuss new ways of respond
ing to the MHWB report. In the
future, PHEs will play a major role
in meeting the recommendations of
the task force for prevention and
outreach.
"They will continue their role as
health advisors on a one-on-one
basis," Pertofsky said. "However, a
new role will be that PHEs will part
ner with HPS to develop new train
ing skills and outreach programs
aimed at the majority of the student
population who want to experience
deeper satisfaction, awaken joy and
manage stress."
Residence Deans (RDs)
To aid PI lEs, RAs and RFs in the
caseload they face, Morales said
Residential Education is actively
considering increasing the number
of RDs on campus.
"One possibility is opening
Crothers for undergrads next year."
he said. "There would be an RD
there. Having one of us there on
hand, as a consultant, would be very
helpful."
Pearson explained that there
have already been a number of
practical changes for Residence
Deans.
"Beginning last academic year
'07-' OB, we added a sixth permanent
RD," he said. "This allowed the num
ber of students within any RD
cohort to be reduced. The addition
gave the RDs a little more time to
work with students and deal with the
increased cases and complexities."
While much is already being
done in terms of mental health,
ResEd is always looking to make
further improvements. Pertofsky
explained that when the new ResEd
director arrives in January. HPS
plans on creating even more specific
dorm-based PHE roles, programs
and services. Further, they are con
sidering additional staffing to imple
ment some of the report's recom
mendations. but it may not be possi
ble given the current economic situ
ation.
"We are clearly in tough budget
ary times, and until the economy sta
bilizes. it's not possible to address
this question," she said. "[However],
I am confident that the well-being of
our students is a University priority,
and, to that end, resources will be
dedicated toward that purpose."

This is the third of a five-part series this week by The Daily focus
ing on campus mental health, specifically in light of the
University's report released last month. Further stories will look
at the relationship between alcohol trends and mental health
issues, as well as the problems facing students in overcoming the
stigma of mental health.

The Student Mental Health and Well-
Being (MHWB) Task Force released a com
prehensive report on campus mental health
last month, but Residential Education
(ResEd) was sparsely mentioned in the 88-
page document.
The roles of Resident Assistants (RAs) and
Peer Health Educators (PHEs) were brought
up. but there was a notable lack of recommen
dations on how ResEd could make further
improvements. Administrators, residence
deans (RDs) and RAs alike noted that this
was because the ResEd system is already very
strong and successful.
Ira Friedman. Associate Vice Provost for
Student Affairs and Director of Vaden Health
Center, co-chaired the WHWB task force's
policy and practice committee. He strongly
commended the existing role of Res Ed.
"One of the findings of the task force was

the strengths of the safety net in residences, in
the communities that exist" he said.
However, Friedman explained that the
impetus for the MHWB report partly came
due to an accumulation of new situations
ResEd has had to deal with.
"We have folks like RDs who are increas
ingly handling difficult student situations," he
said. "We have students coming in stressed
and overstressed. We have the PHEs who are
trying to deliver programs such as massage
workshops, meditation and distressing. We
know from those experiences ... that things
have gradually been changing."
Even with administrators heaping praise
upon Res Ed. the organization is looking to
make further improvements. Along with a new
director at the start of 2009. there will be more
RDs. enhanced RA training and increased
dorm-related programs put on by PHEs.
New programs
Interim Director of Residential Education
John Pearson said that in the last year. ResEd
received requests from Resident Fellows
(RFs) wanting to look into the issue of well
ness in their communities. As a result. ResEd
aimed to cater to the growing demand by put
ting on new programs.
"In response, there was a week of wellness
in Manzanita last year, which was well
received," he said. "This year, we are providing
pilot funds for FloMo East to have meditation

and yoga classes. [Such programs are] not that
unusual in the history of Res Ed. hut I think it
goes against the perception of what programs
happen in the dorm. So I think RFs are begin
ning to think about how they react in their
communities to the issue of student needs."
ResEd has also been in talks with Vaden
and PHEs about how to reduce students'
stress and live more fulfilling lives.
Carole Pertofsky. director of Wellness and
Health Promotion Services (HPS) at Vaden.
explained that the report's recommendations
tend to address the needs of those students
who face serious mental health problems and
chronic distress, such as depression, anxiety
disorders and despair. In her opinion, those
students benefit most from the clinical servic
es that Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) offers.
Instead, she focused on aspects of the
report that are relevant to the vast majority of
students on campus who are not chronically
distressed, but often feel that they are coping
with too much pressure and not enough fulfill
ment.
"They're good at riding the ups and downs
of the Stanford rollercoaster. but vaguely
know that they want to feel happier, healthier
and more secure." Pertofsky said. "My interest
is in helping the students who are tired of sim
ply "coping" and yearn for a greater sense of
happiness and well-being."
In response to the report, a new
course entitled "Happiness and
Health" will he offered starting win
ter quarter. Taught by Pertofsky,
Friedman and Richard Luskin, stu
dents will study evidence-based, sci
entific methods to awaken deeper
happiness and well being. In addi
tion, a new workshop called
"Meditations from Around the
World" will be offered for free to
students in winter quarter.
Resident Assistants (RAs)
RA training teaches students to
look for specific signs relating to
mental health problems and ways to
deal with immediate problems.
While the MHWB report has little
mention of RAs, administrators
noted that they were particularly
important and effective in dealing
with mental health issues.
"Our strong team of residential
staff and RAs are key supports for
students in distress," Pearson said.
"They are the first point of contact,
and we are proud of how well they
do their jobs."
Josh Schiller, associate director of
Residential Education, explained
that student mental health and well
being has always been a major com
ponent of training for RAs.
"As is our current practice, we
will review all parts of RA training,
including sessions addressing mental
health and well-being." he said.
"While the report did not make spe
cific recommendations for changes
to RA training, 1 anticipate that
some aspects will change, but the
specifics of those changes will be
worked out in the coming year."
Schiller said that if RAs have
concerns about a student's mental
health, they are expected to consult
early and often with their RF, RD or
a CAPS consultant.
"Through training, RAs are
informed of the campus resources
that are best-equipped to handle a
wide range of mental health con
cerns." he said. "They are trained to
understand that these mental health
concerns are serious and require the
attention of professionally trained
staff."
Pearson echoed Schiller, empha

sizing that RAs are not medically
trained.
"We don't want them to make
diagnoses," he said. "One of the
things we try to work with RAs on is
to notice students who may need
assistance and then be referrers and
resources."
In interviews with The Daily, a
majority of RAs commented on how
the training provided them with suf
ficient tools to deal with mental
health concerns as an initial point of
contact. They said they are taught to
discuss problems with fellow staff
members and felt confident that

plans on creating even more specific
dorm-based PHE roles, programs
and services. Further, they are con
sidering additional staffing to imple

This is the third of a five-part series this week by The Daily focus
ing on campus mental health, specifically in light of the
University's report released last month. Further stories will look
at the relationship between alcohol trends and mental health
issues, as well as the problems facing students in overcoming the
stigma of mental health.

The Student Mental Health and Well-
Being (MHWB) Task Force released a com
prehensive report on campus mental health
last month, but Residential Education
(ResEd) was sparsely mentioned in the 88-
page document.
The roles of Resident Assistants (RAs) and
Peer Health Educators (PHEs) were brought
up. but there was a notable lack of recommen
dations on how ResEd could make further
improvements. Administrators, residence
deans (RDs) and RAs alike noted that this
was because the ResEd system is already very
strong and successful.
Ira Friedman. Associate Vice Provost for
Student Affairs and Director of Vaden Health
Center, co-chaired the WHWB task force's
policy and practice committee. He strongly
commended the existing role of Res Ed.
"One of the findings of the task force was

the strengths of the safety net in residences, in
the communities that exist" he said.
However, Friedman explained that the
impetus for the MHWB report partly came
due to an accumulation of new situations
ResEd has had to deal with.
"We have folks like RDs who are increas
ingly handling difficult student situations," he
said. "We have students coming in stressed
and overstressed. We have the PHEs who are
trying to deliver programs such as massage
workshops, meditation and distressing. We
know from those experiences ... that things
have gradually been changing."
Even with administrators heaping praise
upon Res Ed. the organization is looking to
make further improvements. Along with a new
director at the start of 2009. there will be more
RDs. enhanced RA training and increased
dorm-related programs put on by PHEs.
New programs
Interim Director of Residential Education
John Pearson said that in the last year. ResEd
received requests from Resident Fellows
(RFs) wanting to look into the issue of well
ness in their communities. As a result. ResEd
aimed to cater to the growing demand by put
ting on new programs.
"In response, there was a week of wellness
in Manzanita last year, which was well
received," he said. "This year, we are providing
pilot funds for FloMo East to have meditation

and yoga classes. [Such programs are] not that
unusual in the history of Res Ed. hut I think it
goes against the perception of what programs
happen in the dorm. So I think RFs are begin
ning to think about how they react in their
communities to the issue of student needs."
ResEd has also been in talks with Vaden
and PHEs about how to reduce students'
stress and live more fulfilling lives.
Carole Pertofsky. director of Wellness and
Health Promotion Services (HPS) at Vaden.
explained that the report's recommendations
tend to address the needs of those students
who face serious mental health problems and
chronic distress, such as depression, anxiety
disorders and despair. In her opinion, those
students benefit most from the clinical servic
es that Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) offers.
Instead, she focused on aspects of the
report that are relevant to the vast majority of
students on campus who are not chronically
distressed, but often feel that they are coping
with too much pressure and not enough fulfill
ment.
"They're good at riding the ups and downs
of the Stanford rollercoaster. but vaguely
know that they want to feel happier, healthier
and more secure." Pertofsky said. "My interest
is in helping the students who are tired of sim
ply "coping" and yearn for a greater sense of
happiness and well-being."
In response to the report, a new
course entitled "Happiness and
Health" will he offered starting win
ter quarter. Taught by Pertofsky,
Friedman and Richard Luskin, stu
dents will study evidence-based, sci
entific methods to awaken deeper
happiness and well being. In addi
tion, a new workshop called
"Meditations from Around the
World" will be offered for free to
students in winter quarter.
Resident Assistants (RAs)
RA training teaches students to
look for specific signs relating to
mental health problems and ways to
deal with immediate problems.
While the MHWB report has little
mention of RAs, administrators
noted that they were particularly
important and effective in dealing
with mental health issues.
"Our strong team of residential
staff and RAs are key supports for
students in distress," Pearson said.
"They are the first point of contact,
and we are proud of how well they
do their jobs."
Josh Schiller, associate director of
Residential Education, explained
that student mental health and well
being has always been a major com
ponent of training for RAs.
"As is our current practice, we
will review all parts of RA training,
including sessions addressing mental
health and well-being." he said.
"While the report did not make spe
cific recommendations for changes
to RA training, 1 anticipate that
some aspects will change, but the
specifics of those changes will be
worked out in the coming year."
Schiller said that if RAs have
concerns about a student's mental
health, they are expected to consult
early and often with their RF, RD or
a CAPS consultant.
"Through training, RAs are
informed of the campus resources
that are best-equipped to handle a
wide range of mental health con
cerns." he said. "They are trained to
understand that these mental health
concerns are serious and require the
attention of professionally trained
staff."
Pearson echoed Schiller, empha

sizing that RAs are not medically
trained.
"We don't want them to make
diagnoses," he said. "One of the
things we try to work with RAs on is
to notice students who may need
assistance and then be referrers and
resources."
In interviews with The Daily, a
majority of RAs commented on how
the training provided them with suf
ficient tools to deal with mental
health concerns as an initial point of
contact. They said they are taught to
discuss problems with fellow staff
members and felt confident that
they were equipped to handle men
tal health problems.
Former Branner RA Alif
Khalfan "08 felt that ResF.d did a
good job with RA training.
"ResEd tried to do a comprehen
sive job at identifying the potential
problems, including mental health
problems, that you as an RA are
going to face," he said. "They gave us
many concrete ways to solve those
problems, and there were a lot of
role-playing scenarios. The stirdents
who failed the scenarios got assis
tance so they could learn how to
improve."
Khalfan added that training was
already very long and detailed, leav
ing the RAs with little free time, so
additional training could overbur
den some dorm staffers.
"Training involved two weeks of
straight back-to-back training ses
sions that lasted the whole day"he
said. "It was a lot of useful informa
tion to take in."
Marissa Klein'oB,a former RA in
FroSoCo, also agreed that the train
ing was adequate.
"As an RA. I would have been
comfortable with recognizing poten
tial problems and serving as an ini
tial point of contact for a student,"
she said. "I would have known who
to talk to or to whom I needed to
refer the student."
Pearson explained that there is
always room for improvement, and
that over the years. RA training has
changed. He pointed to the
Question, Persuade, Refer (QPR)
training introduced last fall, which
all new RAs go through. ITie OPR
method teaches RAs to learn how
to recognize the warning signs of a
suicide crisis and respond appropri
ately.
"We have had implementation of
OPR. and that's going at full force,"
said Vice Provost for Student Affairs

Greg Boardman.
Pearson further added that the
roles which RAs are required to play
must continue to change to keep up
with the needs of students.
"When 1 first came to Stanford in
the '80s, the role of the RA was
much mofe programmatic, much
more community building," he said.
"Now. in many ways, it has changed
to be working with the RFs and RDs
to be a support network for individ
ual students."
Not all dorm staff, however, felt
that the training adequately pre
pared them to deal with crises in
real-life situations.
"While we were given good train
ing, in practice, dealing with the
sheer number and complexity of
issues was different from simply
learning about them," said a current
Branner RA, who wished to remain
anonymous due to a ResEd policy
preventing active staff from com
menting about their roles.
Residence Dean Arcadio
Morales, who also serves as a
Resident Fellow in Twain and recog
nized the issues facing RFs, similarly
noted that there was a gap between
theory and practice.
"IFiink about your classes: It is
great when you learn it in theory, but
it is really scary when you actually
have to apply it when you are con
fronted with the situation," Morales
said. "It is very similar with the RAs.
But we train them in the best way we
can. We give them all the informa
tion."
Peer Health Educators (PHEs)
Pertofsky explained that PHEs
are central to ensuring residents'
mental health and play many roles in
a dorm. PHEs provide dorm-based
outreach programs and provide con
fidential one-on-one peer counsel
ing, coaching and resource referral
for individual students.
According to Pertofsky. PHEs
engage in intensive training in peer
counseling, coaching and resource
referral.
"They have as many training
hours as Bridge counselors," she
said. "Training includes an eight
hour. day-long training in counsel
ing and coaching skills, and three
hours of academic lectures by clini
cal psychologists on recognizing
signs of distress, followed by on
going role play and case study."
Peer Health Education
Coordinator Jarreau Bowen '07
agreed that PHE training was
extensive, covering a wide range of
issues, including mental health.
"PHEs take a class in the spring
in which they train on mental
health, suicide prevention, physical
health, sexual assault, sexual harass
ment. nutrition and how to deal with
disordered eating and eating disor
ders. peer counseling and coaching,
CPR. First Aid, alcohol education
and many other related health
issues," Bowen said.
Bowen added that the PHEs
meet regularly and have already
met to discuss new ways of respond
ing to the MHWB report. In the
future, PHEs will play a major role
in meeting the recommendations of
the task force for prevention and
outreach.
"They will continue their role as
health advisors on a one-on-one
basis," Pertofsky said. "However, a
new role will be that PHEs will part
ner with HPS to develop new train
ing skills and outreach programs
aimed at the majority of the student
population who want to experience
deeper satisfaction, awaken joy and
manage stress."
Residence Deans (RDs)
To aid PI lEs, RAs and RFs in the
caseload they face, Morales said
Residential Education is actively
considering increasing the number
of RDs on campus.
"One possibility is opening
Crothers for undergrads next year."
he said. "There would be an RD
there. Having one of us there on
hand, as a consultant, would be very
helpful."
Pearson explained that there
have already been a number of
practical changes for Residence
Deans.
"Beginning last academic year
'07-' OB, we added a sixth permanent
RD," he said. "This allowed the num
ber of students within any RD
cohort to be reduced. The addition
gave the RDs a little more time to
work with students and deal with the
increased cases and complexities."
While much is already being
done in terms of mental health,
ResEd is always looking to make
further improvements. Pertofsky
explained that when the new ResEd
director arrives in January. HPS
plans on creating even more specific
dorm-based PHE roles, programs
and services. Further, they are con
sidering additional staffing to imple
ment some of the report's recom
mendations. but it may not be possi
ble given the current economic situ
ation.
"We are clearly in tough budget
ary times, and until the economy sta
bilizes. it's not possible to address
this question," she said. "[However],
I am confident that the well-being of
our students is a University priority,
and, to that end, resources will be
dedicated toward that purpose."
