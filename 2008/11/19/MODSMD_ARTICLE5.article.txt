# STUDENT GROUPS
## Students pose as homeless to help cause 
### MARISA LANDICHO STAFF WRITER 
During lunchtime, two students oblivious
ly walked by a homeless woman dozing in
front of the Claw. Huddled behind a card
board sign and a loaded shopping cart, the
woman earned only a brief glance as the stu
dents resumed their conversation.
Hut the "homeless" woman was actually
student Lucy Litvak '11. Litvak was one of
approximately 25 students who volunteered
to portray the homeless as part of a joint proj
ect put on by Stanford Theatre Activist
Mobilization Project (STAMP) and Students
Taking on Poverty (STOP).
Throughout Monday and Tuesday, stu
dents bearing cardboard signs with the mes
sage. "Can you spare some real change?"

posted themselves at heavily trafficked loca
tions around campus. The "homeless" stu
dents were deployed to publicize Hunger and
Homelessness Awareness Week and the cor
responding STOP events planned for this
week.
At a training session beforehand, partici
pating students were given grungy clothes,
location assignments and. of course, new
identities. Organizers cautioned participants
that the goal was to raise awareness, not to
fool people. Collecting money was forbidden.
For the most part, though, student actors
expecting to make a difference were disap
pointed.
"People just completely ignored me," said
Shara F.sbenshade '12, who posed outside
Tresidder. "Even when I said I wanted 'real'
change, they would say. 'Oh. I don't have

time.'"
Casey Weston '09 had similar difficulties in
catching people's attention.
"The general reaction. I think 90 percent
of the time, was that people would look away
or say in hushed tones. 'Sorrv, I don't have
money,'" he said. Only around 10 people actu
ally talked with Weston during the hour he
was stationed in front of Arrillaga Sports and
Recreation Center.
Although a few people offered change, the
audience generally ranged from ambivalent
to fearful and outright hostile.
Both Weston and another student were
asked by the police to vacate the premises.
Another student was spit on by a biker pass
inn between Mever and Green Libraries.

Twenty-five students posed as homeless around campus on Monday and Tuesday to attract attention to the plight of the nation's poor. The actors brandished
cardboard signs asking passerbys if they could "spare some real change." But most students paid little attention to the volunteers, and one was even spat on.
