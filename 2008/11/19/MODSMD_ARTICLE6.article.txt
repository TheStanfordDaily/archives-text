# STUDENT GOV'T
## Funding cutbacks hit Senate Senators to focus on retaining projects, including 5-SURE 
### MARISA LANDICHO STAFF WRITER 
Ilic failing economy loomed over last
night's Undergraduate Senate as the alloca
tion of resources and the future of Stanford's
much-loved golf cart service. 5-SURE. were
extensively debated. ASSU Executives Jonny
Dorsey '09 and Fagan Harris '09 were in
attendance as the Senate preemptively tack
led broader administrative funding issues.
Spanning 40 minutes, the night's longer
discussion was rooted in the personal project
of Senator Stephanie Epps i(). who has been
drafting a possible Senate resolution in sup
port of 5-SURE. Epps currently works for
the program and was asked to compose the
resolution by her boss.
Started in 1979 as a rape elimination proj
ect. 5-SURE is a pick-up service for students
who request transportation late at night. Paid
drivers have been trained to handle situations
ranging from alcohol poisoning to sexual
assault.
Many of the golf carts have since broken,
and because the parts aren't made anymore,
new carts must be purchased for the pro
gram's continued survival. At around $6,000
for a baseline golf cart, the program might be
seen as too expensive for a I Jniversity admin
istration looking to reduce its budget by $45
million.
There are certain parts of the administra
tion who are questioning the need for 5-
SURE." Epps announced at the meeting.
Epps went on to say that the University
was looking to make cuts from the program
or even disband it entirely. 1 ler information
came from the manager of the program,
Director of Unions Jeanette Smith-Laws.
Senator Stuart Baimel '09 questioned the
validity of her information and whether the
program was actually in any danger of being
shut down.
"I am very concerned about setting a
precedent toward resolutions saying that we
support something that isn't actually in dan
ger." Baimel said. "I would need to be
convinced and see some agreement
between people in the know whether
this is actually in danger or not."
Baimel also requested to see the
operating budget of 5-SURE before
making any attempts at Senate advo
cacy.
Other senators contested the reso
lution because they argued that 5-
SURE was not as instrumental in pre
venting sexual assaults as other servic
es that are currently under-funded.
Senator Patrick Cordova '09. using
crime statistics from the past three
years, argued that the service was
effectively useless at preventing sexu
al assault by strangers outside of
dorms.
"You'll see in the forcible offences
that the number of sexual assaults was
four in 2(X)5, 10 in 2(X)6 and 12 in
2(X)7." Cordova said. "Each and every
one of these people was forcibly
offended against by people they knew
and principally in their dorms."
Cordova urged cuts from 5-SURE
so that money could be put toward
other rape prevention initiatives —
such as improving campus mental
health — that may be more effective.
Senator Yvorn "Doc" Aswad-
Thomas Ml and ASSU President

Dorsey weren't convinced that the
statistics invalidated the importance of
5-SURE. Dorsey likened the argu
ment to a "chicken and egg" situation.
Matt McLaughlin "08, ASSU finan
cial manager and CEO of Stanford
Student Enterprises, thought the issue
was much greater than one specific
program.
"Whether you guys are ready for it
or not, this Undergraduate Senate and
the next one are probably going to be
the most important senates in the last
10 years," he said. "You guys are the
stand for many programs that are
going to be cut or downsized."
Sen. Luukas lives '09 agreed that
the ASSU will become the frontline
for groups fighting for funding.
"Honestly, preventing things that
have been around for decades from
being axed is more important than
anything new we want to accomplish
this year," lives said.
lives then assured the Senate that,
for the rest of the year, he would harp
on that issue.
Dorsey and Vice President Harris
expressed their approval that the
Senate was considering the tight fund
ing situation. The executives stressed
that it is the job of the ASSU to push
the administration for group funding.
That brought the discussion to a
close, and Epps agreed to take the
Senate's suggestions into account and
revise her proposal.
Before debate could continue,
however. Sen. Cordova brought up an

unusual request.
"I was having a conversation with a
constituent recently who mentioned
that they were very upset last year by
the use of small toy bears as part of
this "kill bear' mantra," he said. "It's
not that I'm necessarily opposed to
the brutality, but can't we grow up and
donate these bears to some kids in
East Palo Alto for God's sake?"
FanatAXE representative Zach
Warma i 1 — also a member of The
Daily's editorial board — politely told
the senator that his organization was
not responsible for the mistreatment
of any toy bears.
Warma then introduced the next
item on the agenda — a budget modi
fication for FanatAXE, a new group
dedicated to publicizing lesser-known
athletics and increasing campus
enthusiasm for sporting events.
In the hauntingly familiar vein of
past senate controversies this year, the
FanatAXE purchased $ 1.2(H) worth of
shirts for Big Game, using money that
had not been approved for that pur
pose.
The Senate let out a collective
groan as the word "T-shirts" was intro
duced yet another time.
The executives, however, cut the
debate short by agreeing to float the
cost of the shirts until the formal budg
et modification was cleared through
the Appropriations Committee.

that the number of sexual assaults was
four in 2(X)5, 10 in 2(X)6 and 12 in
2(X)7." Cordova said. "Each and every
one of these people was forcibly
offended against by people they knew
and principally in their dorms."
Cordova urged cuts from 5-SURE
so that money could be put toward
other rape prevention initiatives —
such as improving campus mental
health — that may be more effective.
Senator Yvorn "Doc" Aswad-
Thomas Ml and ASSU President

Dorsey weren't convinced that the
statistics invalidated the importance of
5-SURE. Dorsey likened the argu
ment to a "chicken and egg" situation.
Matt McLaughlin "08, ASSU finan
cial manager and CEO of Stanford
Student Enterprises, thought the issue
was much greater than one specific
program.
"Whether you guys are ready for it
or not, this Undergraduate Senate and
the next one are probably going to be
the most important senates in the last
10 years," he said. "You guys are the
stand for many programs that are
going to be cut or downsized."
Sen. Luukas lives '09 agreed that
the ASSU will become the frontline
for groups fighting for funding.
"Honestly, preventing things that
have been around for decades from
being axed is more important than
anything new we want to accomplish
this year," lives said.
lives then assured the Senate that,
for the rest of the year, he would harp
on that issue.
Dorsey and Vice President Harris
expressed their approval that the
Senate was considering the tight fund
ing situation. The executives stressed
that it is the job of the ASSU to push
the administration for group funding.
That brought the discussion to a
close, and Epps agreed to take the
Senate's suggestions into account and
revise her proposal.
Before debate could continue,
however. Sen. Cordova brought up an

unusual request.
"I was having a conversation with a
constituent recently who mentioned
that they were very upset last year by
the use of small toy bears as part of
this "kill bear' mantra," he said. "It's
not that I'm necessarily opposed to
the brutality, but can't we grow up and
donate these bears to some kids in
East Palo Alto for God's sake?"
FanatAXE representative Zach
Warma i 1 — also a member of The
Daily's editorial board — politely told
the senator that his organization was
not responsible for the mistreatment
of any toy bears.
Warma then introduced the next
item on the agenda — a budget modi
fication for FanatAXE, a new group
dedicated to publicizing lesser-known
athletics and increasing campus
enthusiasm for sporting events.
In the hauntingly familiar vein of
past senate controversies this year, the
FanatAXE purchased $ 1.2(H) worth of
shirts for Big Game, using money that
had not been approved for that pur
pose.
The Senate let out a collective
groan as the word "T-shirts" was intro
duced yet another time.
The executives, however, cut the
debate short by agreeing to float the
cost of the shirts until the formal budg
et modification was cleared through
the Appropriations Committee.
