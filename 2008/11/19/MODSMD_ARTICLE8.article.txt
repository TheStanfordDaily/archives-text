Cheney, Gonzales indicted in South Texas
county
Vice President Dick Cheney and former Attorney
General Alberto Gonzales have been indicted on state
charges involving federal prisons in a South Texas
county that has been a source of bizarre legal and polit
ical battles under the outgoing prosecutor.
Guerra himself was under indictment for more than
a year and half until a judge dismissed the indictments
last month. Guerra's tenure ends this year after nearly
two decades in office. He lost convincingly in a Demo
cratic primary in March.
Cheney is charged with engaging in an organized
criminal activity related to the vice president's invest
ment in the Vanguard Group, which holds financial in
terests in the private prison companies running the fed
eral detention centers. It accuses Cheney of a conflict of
interest and "at least misdemeanor assaults" on de
tainees because of his link to the prison companies.
The indictment accuses Gonzales of using his posi
tion while in office to stop an investigation in 2006 into
abuses at one of the privately-run prisons.
