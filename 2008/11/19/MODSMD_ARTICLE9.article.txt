# LONGEST-SERVING REPUBLICAN SENATOR LOSES SEAT IN A TIGHT RACE
## Stevens loses senate race 
### MICHAEL R. BLOOD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Sen. Ted Stevens, the longest serving Republican in
Senate history, narrowly lost his re-election bid Tuesday,
marking the downfall of a Washington political power
and Alaska icon who couldn't survive a conviction on
federal corruption charges. His defeat by Anchorage
Mayor Mark Begich moves Senate Democrats within
two seats of a filibuster-proof 60-vote majority.
Stevens' ouster on his 85th birthday marks an abrupt
realignment in Alaska politics and will alter the power
structure in the Senate, where he has served since the
days of the Johnson administration while holding seats
on some of the most influential committees in Congress.
The crotchety octogenarian built like a birch sapling
likes to encourage comparisons with the Incredible Hulk,
but he occupies an outsized place in Alaska history. His
involvement in politics dates to the days before Alaska
statehood, and he is esteemed for his ability to secure bil
lions of dollars in federal aid for transportation and mili
tary projects. The Anchorage airport bears his name; in
Alaska, it's simply "Uncle Ted."
Tuesday's tally of just over 24,000 absentee and other
ballots gave Begich 150.728, or 47.76 percent, to 147.004.
or 46.58 percent, for Stevens.
A recount is possible.
Begich said the defining issue in the race was the de
sire for a new direction in Washington, not Stevens' legal
problems.
Alaska voters "wanted to see change," he told re
porters in Anchorage. "Alaska has been in the midst of a
generational shift — you could see it."
Stevens' campaign didn't immediately respond to
phone calls seeking comment.
Stevens' loss was another slap for Republicans in a
year that has seen the party lose control of the White
House, as well as seats in the House and Senate. It also
moves Democrats one step closer to the 60 votes needed
to overcome filibusters in the Senate and gives President
elect Barack Obama a stronger hand when he assumes
office on Jan. 20.
Democrats now hold 58 seats, when two independents
who align with Democrats are included, with undecided
races in Minnesota and Georgia where two Republicans
are trying to hang onto their seats.
Democrats have now picked up seven Senate seats in
the Nov. 4 election.
"With seven seats and counting now added to the De
mocratic ranks in the Senate, we have an even stronger

majority that will bring real change to America," Sen.
Charles Schumer. D-N.Y., chairman of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in a statement.
The climactic count came after a series of tumultuous
days for a senator who has been straddling challenges to
his power both at home and in his trial in Washington.
Notwithstanding all that turmoil. Stevens revealed Tues
day that he will not ask President George W. Bush to give
him a pardon for his seven felony convictions.
Stevens' future was murky at a time when newly elect
ed members of both the House and Senate were on Capi
tol Hill for heady receptions, picture-taking sessions and
orientation this week. Stevens, speaking earlier Tuesday
in Washington, said he had no idea what his life would be
like in January, when the 111 th Congress convenes.
"I wouldn't wish what I'm going through on anyone,
my worst enemy." he lamented to reporters. "I haven't
had a night's sleep for almost four months."
Last month just days before the election. Stevens was
convicted by a federal jury in Washington of lying on Sen
ate disclosure forms to conceal more than $250,000 in
gifts and home renovations from an oil field services
company.
His defeat could also allow Republican senators to
sidestep the task of determining whether to kick out the
longest serving member of their party in the Senate.

When counting resumed Tuesday, 1,022 votes divided
the candidates out of about 300,000 ballots cast. Most of
the those votes came from areas that had favored Begich
— the Anchorage vicinity and the southeastern panhan
dle around Juneau.
It is a testament to Stevens' popularity — he was once
named "Alaskan of the Century" — that he won nearly
half the votes, even after his conviction. He routinely
brought home the highest number of government dollars
per capita in the nation — more than $9 billion in 2006
alone, according to one estimate.
With Stevens gone "it's a big gap in dollars — billions
of dollars — that none of the other members of the dele
gation, Begich. whoever, could fill," said Gerald
Mcßeath. chair of the political science department at
University of Alaska Fairbanks. "There is no immediate
replacement for him."
Following the trial Stevens said he wanted another
term ''because I love this land and its people" and vowed
to press on with an appeal. Professing his innocence, he
blamed his legal problems on his former friend Bill Allen,
the founder and former chairman of VECO Corp., the
government's star witness.
In a state where oil and politics have always mixed, the
conviction came as part of a long-running investigation
into government corruption centered around VECO.
Begich will be the first Democrat to represent Alaska
in the Senate in nearly 30 years. He is the son of Nick Be
gich. Alaska's third congressman, who died in a plane
crash 1972 while running for re-election.
Stevens' lawyer demanded a speedy trial, hoping for
exoneration in time to fight the first serious threat to his
seat in decades. But the trial in Washington not only left
Stevens a felon.it deprived him of time to campaign in his
home state.
Stevens refused pleas from his own party leaders to
step down after the verdict, including Sen. John McCain,
the GOP presidential nominee who said the Alaska sen
ator had "broken his trust with the people."
Stevens' fall came shortly after another Alaskan, Gov.
Sarah Palin, emerged as a national figure on the Repub
lican presidential ticket. She had called for Stevens to
step aside at one point, but appeared to back away from
that the day after the election when returns showed
Stevens with an edge.
"The people of Alaska just spoke." she said.

mocrats closer to a 60-seat majority.
Sen. Ted Stevens, the longest serving Republican in
Senate history, narrowly lost his re-election bid Tuesday,
marking the downfall of a Washington political power
and Alaska icon who couldn't survive a conviction on
federal corruption charges. His defeat by Anchorage
Mayor Mark Begich moves Senate Democrats within
two seats of a filibuster-proof 60-vote majority.
Stevens' ouster on his 85th birthday marks an abrupt
realignment in Alaska politics and will alter the power
structure in the Senate, where he has served since the
days of the Johnson administration while holding seats
on some of the most influential committees in Congress.
The crotchety octogenarian built like a birch sapling
likes to encourage comparisons with the Incredible Hulk,
but he occupies an outsized place in Alaska history. His
involvement in politics dates to the days before Alaska
statehood, and he is esteemed for his ability to secure bil
lions of dollars in federal aid for transportation and mili
tary projects. The Anchorage airport bears his name; in
Alaska, it's simply "Uncle Ted."
Tuesday's tally of just over 24,000 absentee and other
ballots gave Begich 150.728, or 47.76 percent, to 147.004.
or 46.58 percent, for Stevens.
A recount is possible.
Begich said the defining issue in the race was the de
sire for a new direction in Washington, not Stevens' legal
problems.
Alaska voters "wanted to see change," he told re
porters in Anchorage. "Alaska has been in the midst of a
generational shift — you could see it."
Stevens' campaign didn't immediately respond to
phone calls seeking comment.
Stevens' loss was another slap for Republicans in a
year that has seen the party lose control of the White
House, as well as seats in the House and Senate. It also
moves Democrats one step closer to the 60 votes needed
to overcome filibusters in the Senate and gives President
elect Barack Obama a stronger hand when he assumes
office on Jan. 20.
Democrats now hold 58 seats, when two independents
who align with Democrats are included, with undecided
races in Minnesota and Georgia where two Republicans
are trying to hang onto their seats.
Democrats have now picked up seven Senate seats in
the Nov. 4 election.
"With seven seats and counting now added to the De
mocratic ranks in the Senate, we have an even stronger

majority that will bring real change to America," Sen.
Charles Schumer. D-N.Y., chairman of the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in a statement.
The climactic count came after a series of tumultuous
days for a senator who has been straddling challenges to
his power both at home and in his trial in Washington.
Notwithstanding all that turmoil. Stevens revealed Tues
day that he will not ask President George W. Bush to give
him a pardon for his seven felony convictions.
Stevens' future was murky at a time when newly elect
ed members of both the House and Senate were on Capi
tol Hill for heady receptions, picture-taking sessions and
orientation this week. Stevens, speaking earlier Tuesday
in Washington, said he had no idea what his life would be
like in January, when the 111 th Congress convenes.
"I wouldn't wish what I'm going through on anyone,
my worst enemy." he lamented to reporters. "I haven't
had a night's sleep for almost four months."
Last month just days before the election. Stevens was
convicted by a federal jury in Washington of lying on Sen
ate disclosure forms to conceal more than $250,000 in
gifts and home renovations from an oil field services
company.
His defeat could also allow Republican senators to
sidestep the task of determining whether to kick out the
longest serving member of their party in the Senate.

When counting resumed Tuesday, 1,022 votes divided
the candidates out of about 300,000 ballots cast. Most of
the those votes came from areas that had favored Begich
— the Anchorage vicinity and the southeastern panhan
dle around Juneau.
It is a testament to Stevens' popularity — he was once
named "Alaskan of the Century" — that he won nearly
half the votes, even after his conviction. He routinely
brought home the highest number of government dollars
per capita in the nation — more than $9 billion in 2006
alone, according to one estimate.
With Stevens gone "it's a big gap in dollars — billions
of dollars — that none of the other members of the dele
gation, Begich. whoever, could fill," said Gerald
Mcßeath. chair of the political science department at
University of Alaska Fairbanks. "There is no immediate
replacement for him."
Following the trial Stevens said he wanted another
term ''because I love this land and its people" and vowed
to press on with an appeal. Professing his innocence, he
blamed his legal problems on his former friend Bill Allen,
the founder and former chairman of VECO Corp., the
government's star witness.
In a state where oil and politics have always mixed, the
conviction came as part of a long-running investigation
into government corruption centered around VECO.
Begich will be the first Democrat to represent Alaska
in the Senate in nearly 30 years. He is the son of Nick Be
gich. Alaska's third congressman, who died in a plane
crash 1972 while running for re-election.
Stevens' lawyer demanded a speedy trial, hoping for
exoneration in time to fight the first serious threat to his
seat in decades. But the trial in Washington not only left
Stevens a felon.it deprived him of time to campaign in his
home state.
Stevens refused pleas from his own party leaders to
step down after the verdict, including Sen. John McCain,
the GOP presidential nominee who said the Alaska sen
ator had "broken his trust with the people."
Stevens' fall came shortly after another Alaskan, Gov.
Sarah Palin, emerged as a national figure on the Repub
lican presidential ticket. She had called for Stevens to
step aside at one point, but appeared to back away from
that the day after the election when returns showed
Stevens with an edge.
"The people of Alaska just spoke." she said.
