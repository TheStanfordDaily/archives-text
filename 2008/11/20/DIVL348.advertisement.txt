Dr. James Hansen
Director, NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies
The Threat to the Planet:
Global Warming and Intergenerational Inequities
Nov. 20, 2008
5:30 p.m., Annenberg Auditorium
James Hansen is widely regarded as the leading climate
change scientist in the country. He is best known for his
Congressional testimony on climate change in the 1980s. It was
that testimony that helped raise broad awareness of the global
warming issue. Hansen made international headlines again
recently when he publicly charged the Bush administration with
trying to silence his warnings about the urgent need to address
climate change.
In addition to directing NASA, Hansen is an Adjunct Professor at
Columbia University. In 2006, he was designated by Time
Magazine as one of the world's 100 most influential people.
