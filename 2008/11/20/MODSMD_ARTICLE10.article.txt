Last night, the Graduate Student
Council (GSC) discussed funding
policies and had Stanford Chief of
Police Laura Wilson give a presenta
tion about the police force and cam
pus safety.
Lan Wei, engineering graduate
student and Funding Committee
chair, led the funding section of the
meeting.
The Russian Students Association
received $1,150 for two events — the
first, a welcome-back party to be held
Dec. 6 for approximately 10() atten
dees, and the second an Orthodox
New Year celebration scheduled for
Jan. 17.
Comedy Club was given $1,500 to
fund three co-sponsored events. The
first two are tentatively scheduled for
early February, and both will feature
Indian and African-American
comics. The group also requested —
and was denied — an additional

s3,ooo (later amended to $2,CKK)) for
an end-of-thc-year event to be held in
Kresge Auditorium.
Wilson briefed the council about
the police force and the various at
tempts to create community out
reach programs on campus. Members
of the police force have given lectures
to students and staff on identity theft,
what to do when confronted or at
tacked. how to keep dorms secure
during social events and other topics.
In addition, she said that the po
lice force was not always the most ef
fective source of advocacy in terms of
informing and making recommenda
tions to the Stanford administration
about campus safety issues. A couple
of issues discussed included the nu
merous unlighted areas around cam
pus at night, increased thefts and the
lack of a truly effective way to pre
vent rape and sexual assault.
The GSC then approved supple
mental funding of $500 to the ASSU
Big Game busing effort, to include
the approximately 50 graduate stu

dents who had signed up to utilize the
service.
Justin Brown, a third-year geo
physics graduate student and pro
gramming coordinator, was granted a
$400 funding request from the GSC
to hold an information dinner event
on finance on Jan. 4. The plans are to
invite two representatives from ap
proximately 20 graduate student
groups and brief them on how cam
pus finances works, how to utilize var

ious funding sources and how to max
imize efficiency and fund usage by
co-sponsoring common events,
themes or holiday celebrations to
gether.
Finally, approximately five CiSC
members will be attending a "Web
site party" next Monday to rework
the council site.
