## Risk management course graduates 100 
### THOMAS YEH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In April 2006. 'Hie Stanford
Center for Professional
Development (SCPD), in its ongoing
effort to provide professionals with
valuable resources and course oppor
tunities, began the Strategic Decision
and Risk Management program.
Since then, this certificate program,
which offers courses geared toward
instilling good value metrics for an
organization or company's decision
making and risk-taking processes, has
successfully educated 1 (K) graduates.
The program is the result of a
partnership between the SCPD and
Strategic Decisions Group (SDCi), a
management consulting firm
renowned for both its strategic risk
management services and client edu

cation. Since its inception, the pro
gram has combined the two organi
zations and added experience to pro
vide a well-rounded curriculum cov
ering a variety of issues that include
decision analysis, strategic innovation
and enterprise risk.
"The partnership allows us to
bring both the practical applied
knowledge that SDCi has to offer
with the academic knowledge and
strong theoretical background of the
SCPD," said Hannah Winter, associ
ate program director and partner at
SDG.
The material covered in the cours
es stems largely from the work of
Management Science & Engineering
Prof. Ron Howard, a major pioneer
in the field of decision analysis.
Howard's work focuses on all kinds
of decisions, including financial deci
sions, and explores the notion of de
cision analysis in relation to risk and
strategy.
According to Joyce Rice, market
ing director at the SCPD. the courses
are directed primarily toward pro
fessionals in industry. Previous par
ticipants have come from Boeing.
Chevron, Cisco Systems and Genen
tech. though a few who have en
rolled are from entities like the De
partment of Homeland Security.
"We're targeting people who are
in a position to influence the strate
gic direction of any entity that they
represent," Rice said. "Essentially,
it's all about how you decide what
the right things are for your organi

zation. There's always a lot of op
tions, so how do you make decisions
amongst these options when very
few decisions have a really clear-cut
choice?"
The courses are offered on cam
pus in March. June and September,
but can also be taken on site or on
line via streaming video at any time.
Participants are able to enroll in in
dividual, 2.5-day courses, and will re
ceive a certificate upon completion
of six courses. The goal is to provide
participants with the ability to enroll
in a variety of courses that will teach
them to embrace risk, sift through
conflicting goals and essentially
learn how to make smart decisions
for the organizations they work for.
For SDG, the partnership with
SCPD to create the certificate pro
gram fits directly into their mission
statement.
"Strategic Decision Group's goal
from its inception has been to im
prove the quality of decision-making

worldwide," Winter said. "We have a
lot of ties at Stanford, and it was a re
ally great match for us to team up
with SCPD."
And in light of current events and
the ongoing credit crisis, this goal of
improved decision-making is shared
by many of the participants. The on
campus enrollment for September
occurred prior to the economic situ
ation at hand, but the number of par
ticipants taking the courses online
has increased visibly compared to
the previous years — a sign that in
dividuals are taking matters into
their own hands and are enrolling
because they believe the material is
worth the time and money. Winter
said.
Since its inception, the Strategic
Decision and Risk Management
program has enrolled more than 750
participants.
