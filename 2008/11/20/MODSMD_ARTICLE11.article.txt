### THOMAS YEH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In April 2006. 'Hie Stanford
Center for Professional
Development (SCPD), in its ongoing
effort to provide professionals with
valuable resources and course oppor
tunities, began the Strategic Decision
and Risk Management program.
Since then, this certificate program,
which offers courses geared toward
instilling good value metrics for an
organization or company's decision
making and risk-taking processes, has
successfully educated 1 (K) graduates.
The program is the result of a
partnership between the SCPD and
Strategic Decisions Group (SDCi), a
management consulting firm
renowned for both its strategic risk
management services and client edu

cation. Since its inception, the pro
gram has combined the two organi
zations and added experience to pro
vide a well-rounded curriculum cov
ering a variety of issues that include
decision analysis, strategic innovation
and enterprise risk.
"The partnership allows us to
bring both the practical applied
knowledge that SDCi has to offer
with the academic knowledge and
strong theoretical background of the
SCPD," said Hannah Winter, associ
ate program director and partner at
SDG.
The material covered in the cours
es stems largely from the work of
Management Science & Engineering
Prof. Ron Howard, a major pioneer
in the field of decision analysis.
