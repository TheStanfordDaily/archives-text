## Obama victory excites Ed. School Students, faculty have high hopes for Obama 
### ELLIOTT JIN 
President-elect Barack Obama's
recent victory and his plans for edu
cational reform have instilled wide
spread euphoria in the faculty and
students in Stanford's School of
Education. As a result, many are
optimistic about Obama's plan to
improve public education.
"I'm ecstatic, extremely happy
and hopeful on a lot of levels," said
Martin Carnoy, Vida Jacks Professor
of Education and Economics.
Prof. Carnoy told The Daily that
he supports Obama's initiatives,
including investing $29 billion
toward developing pre-schools,
improving the teaching force in
lower-income schools and providing

tuition tax benefits for parents send
ing their kids to universities.
"ITiese are all very good invest
ments," Carnoy said. "Twenty-nine
billion dollars is not big compared to
other investments [that Obama is]
going to make, and 1 think there's a
pretty big payoff to these."
Carnoy added that Obama
should invest in public education
right away.
"Ile shouldn't wait," Carnoy said.
"If he's going to run big deficits, he
might as well run it all over the place,
so that's what I'm hoping he'll do."
Many students in the School of
Education also approved of
Obama's education platform.
"I feel elated, absolutely elated."
said Jonathan Shemwell. doctoral
student in Curriculum Studies and
Teacher Education.
Shemwell especially likes
Obama's commitment to early child
hood education.
"I know he wants to put strong

support on that area, and I think
that's really important" Shemwell
said. "There tend to he big differ
ences in groups of children when
they are in higher poverty, and they
are way behind even as they come
into kindergarten. I certainly like the
commitment to early childhood, and
1 think there is a lot to be gained
from that."
Hayin Kim. doctoral student in
Administration and Policy Analysis,
emphasized the depth and detail of
Obama's plan.
"I'm pretty thrilled about
[Obama's victory]." Kim said. "The
Obama-Biden approach to really
thinking about these problems,
including education, is knowing that
difficult problems require very
nuanced and comprehensive under
standing."
"Public schools and education are
very easy talking points on the trail."
she added. "But if you have real
ideas and real knowledge of what it
takes to put those ideas into motion,
and even research that goes behind
it. then that's pretty exciting."
Kim had spent considerable time
examining presidential candidates'
plans. When asked about her overall
views on Obama's platform, Kim
replied,"l think that the basic ration
ale behind it is very comprehensive,
from pre-K through college, so it's
taking a very different approach
than just how most are thinking
about education."
At least one Stanford professor
will have a voice in Obama's educa
tion policies. Linda Darling-
Hammond, the Charles Ducommon
Professor of Education, served as an
education advisor to Obama's cam
paign and is now working with
Obama's transition team.
Students and faculty hope that
Darling-Hammond will continue to
be involved with the administration at
a high level, but have mixed feelings

about her potential appointment to
secretary of education.
"The Secretary of Education [posi
tion] is still highly politicized," Kim
said. "If Linda were appointed. I
would he really psyched, but I feel like
she could do a lot more if she could fly
a little under the radar, which she can't
do if she's Secretary of Education."
"Usually, the Secretary of
Education is a politician, not an aca
demic." Carnoy added. "I'm hoping
that Linda will be [in the administra
tion] as the Deputy Secretary or

Assistant Secretary, which is a very
powerful position in terms of making
policy."
Regardless of Darling-
Hammond's ultimate role within the
administration, students and faculty at
the School of Education remain excit
ed about Obama's victory.
"I think that [Obama] is the right
person to galvanize us and help us get
through [these times] as a country,"
Shemwell said.
