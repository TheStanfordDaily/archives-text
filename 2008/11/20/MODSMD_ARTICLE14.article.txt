## Editorial Stanford's sustainable building projects should remain a priority 
### 
From the iconic Palm Drive to the poet
ic archways of the Main Quad. Stan
ford's campus is one of the most beau
tiful on earth and arguably the most unique.
Here on the Farm, tradition collides with in
novation. and nowhere else is this reflected
more than in the University's construction
and architectural undertakings. In addition
to Frederick Law Olmsted's vision of a Mis
sion Revival style, Stanford's campus is now
defined by unprecedented sustainabilitv ini
tiatives in its architecture, evidenced by the
award-winning, new Y2E2 building and
other sustainabilitv initiatives that herald a
new era of environmental consciousness.
The editorial board praises Stanford's
commitment to sustainability in its building
projects, specifically with regard to the
Green Dorm project, and hopes that such ef
forts continue in light of recent financial con
cerns. budget cuts and costly proposals such
as undergraduate expansion.
Stanford's initial Capital Plan
forecasts $2.8 billion in construction and in
frastructure projects to be completed or
planned over the course of the next three
years, a 17-percent increase from the prior
year's budget of $2.4 billion. One of the
major programs of the Capital Plan is the
Sustainability at Stanford Program, which
pledges to improve the energy efficiency of
new buildings, existing buildings and utility
supply programs in an effort to "reduce Stan
ford's use of non-renewable resources and
minimize our environmental impact."
In February 2(K)S. Stanford increased sus
tainability standards for all new projects to
reduce energy use by 30 percent to below the
American Society of Heating. Refrigerating
and Air-Conditioning Engineers Standard,
as well as reduce water use by 25 percent
compared to existing campus buildings.
Sustainability at Stanford is responsible
for successful initiatives like the Energy
Retrofit Program, funded by reinvested util
ity cost savings, and the Energy Conserva
tion Incentive Program (ECIP). which offers
monetary incentives to building occupants
who reduce energy consumption.

The crown jewel of Stanford's sustainabil
ity efforts is the new Jerry Yang and Akiko
Yamazaki Environment and Energy Build
ing. Y2E2. The building is expected to use 56
percent less energy and 90 percent less
potable water than buildings of comparable
size and function. The structure was built
with recyclable materials, uncarpeted floors
and photovoltaic panels on its roof. Y2E2 is
the paradigm for sustainable growth and em
bodies Stanford's great efforts to remain on
the forefront of environmental innovation.
Despite the great efforts and huge steps
taken towards sustainability, there are other
important sustainability projects that are not
yet underway, most notably the Green Dorm
project. Originally envisioned out of a brain
storming session by the Department of Civil
and Environmental Engineering back in
2003. the Green Dorm would be a sustain
able dorm offering desirable campus hous
ing, economic sustainability and a living lab
oratory for research.
After a two-year delay in lundraising, the
Green Dorm project has yet to break
ground. The project, with an estimated cost
of $12.7 million, has been added to the Capi
tal Plan's list of forecasted projects, projects
that expect approval from the Board of
Trustees within the next three years. Due to
the heavy construction phase the University
is facing — with major projects like the
Munger Graduate Residences, the Stanford
Stadium renovation and the new Graduate
School of Business campus in the works —
the Green Dorm and other forecasted proj
ects have been delayed.
We commend Stanford's past efforts at
sustainable architecture and hope that future
projects like the Green Dorm will soon be re
alized. Sustainable projects such as this or
Y2E2 not only have a positive impact on the
overall aesthetic of our campus,but also keep
Stanford at the forefront of innovation. Stan
ford's efforts to lessen environmental impact
are commendable. We hope that despite cur
rent financial uncertainty, Stanford contin
ues its sustainable efforts and makes them a
priority.
