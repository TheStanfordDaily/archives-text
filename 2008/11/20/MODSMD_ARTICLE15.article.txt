# The 						Economics Of...
## The 						Facebook profile 
### 
While many of my friends spend end
less hours scouring Facebook for
men and women, I refrain entirely.
My lack of participation in this college ritual
does not stem from any superciliousness. On
the contrary. I think Facebook is an excellent
medium for meeting the opposite, or the
same, sex.
The truth is that I am technologically
inept. I am utterly incompetent. I do not
know how Facebook works: I do not under
stand its social conventions, its pseudo-hier
archies or its tagging and detagging.
How can this be,you ask. How can a mod
erately intelligent Stanford student not un
derstand Facebook? After all. Stanford is
the epicenter of technological innovation,
the birthplace of Silicon Valley. You would
think that just being here for four years and
breathing the air would have allowed me to
acquire a rudimentary understanding of so
cial networking.
But alas, 1 am a lost cause. I have tried,
and tried, only to fail miserably.
Recently, in fact, I met an attractive
young girl who. if I say so myself, was quite
enamored with me after our first encounter.
At the suggestion of a friend, I decided to do
some due-diligence and look up her Face
book profile. Unfortunately, I typed her
name in my "status bar" — I didn't even
know what the thing was — instead of the
search field. After repeatedly hitting search
and wondering why nothing was happening,
I concluded that Facebook was broken and
left it at that. Later in the day, a friend of
mine called me to ask me about my status. I
panicked, suffered a bout of hysteria and
then logged on to Facebook. It took me an
other 30 minutes to figure out how to delete
her name off of my status. As you can imag
ine, I have not met her since.
The point of all this, dear reader, is not to
engage in an exercise of egomania, insincere
as that may sound. See, while I may not un
derstand the new-age world of Facebook, I
do understand the world of finance. So let
me tell you how a financier (read: invest
ment banker) would navigate the treacher
ous online waters of Facebook profiles.
First, and foremost, know your target.
Any prospective investment should be thor
oughly researched.and you should start with
a lOKor lOQ.That means checking the Info
page. See what guidance or forward-looking
statements she has to give, what her past per
formance has been like and what her fa
vorite movies are. You can never know your
investment too well.
Second, look for value. As the greatest
investor ever. Warren Buffet, says,"Price is

what you pay. Value is what you will get." In
the stock market, a good metric for judging
value is price to earnings or P/E ratio. Sim
ilarly, you want to measure a Facebook pro
file by its own P/E ratio: photos to expo
sure.
Do not be fooled (or excited) by some
one who has a thousand pictures on display.
Analyze those pictures carefully. If all
you're getting to see is an up-close picture of
her face, be wary. She has an extremely high
P/E ratio, akin to a small technology compa
ny. She might turn out to be the next Google
or Ebay, but then she might also end up on
the pink sheets.
On the other hand, if you find a profile
that contains a good number of photos with
a diverse range of exposures, you've found
yourself something steady and bankable,
something that will do well in a boom and
weather a recession — a Wal-Mart.
You're never going to double your invest
ment overnight with a Wal-Mart, but at least
you know exactly what you're getting into.
Excellent disclosure policies and solid cor
porate governance means that there will be
no surprises when you actually meet.
Once you've scoured through prospec
tive investments and found value, you need
to start thinking about execution. There are
several ways to go along one of your portfo
lio watch list's members. It all comes down to
risk appetite. If you are extremely bullish on
a particular profile, then send a Facebook
message. While this is the riskiest strategy —
it might forever alienate your target and
label you a stalker — the reward, should it
work, is highest. Those of you who are slight
ly more risk averse might want to hedge
your message by throwing around a few
pokes at other profiles. II your message fails,
at least you have some pokes that might ma
terialize.
With these strategies and slightly more
competence than I possess, you are well on
your way to becoming a Facebook superstar
just remember to keep your hands off the
mouse.
