## Cal Sucks: a well-reasoned, articulate treatise 
### 
As obnoxiously loud air horns mark the
dwindling hours to Big Game. I decided
that it was time to write out everything
I have to say about Cal. In a previous column, 1
described Cal as "a known terrorist state,
founded by banshees and fueled by the anguish
of children."
Unfounded? Perhaps. Vitriolic? Undoubt
edly. But what it lacks in empirical evidence it
more than makes up for in my believing it to
be true.
Indeed, Cal has been our rival, the Vader
to our Han, the heroin to our Clapton, the
Urkel to our quality of the show Family Mat
ters, since literally the dawn of time. (I w ill say
it now: I have not exactly "done research" for
this article.)
Contrary to what you might expect. I have
been to Cal a number of times. Once. I saw a
man shooting up half a block from the police
station. Another time, a homeless man tried to
convince me I was a penguin. My friends at the
school assure me that this is normal.
But those are functions of the terrible city of
Berkeley, not the terrible school of Berkeley.
As you most certainly know. Berkeley was
once the central hub of the hippy movement, a
shower-free zone birthed out of the principles
of peace, drug use. love and more drug use. But
since then, Cal has been reduced to simply
being another hypercompetitive academic uni
versity with a marginally literate football team.
Oh. Cal. Sweet, simple, naive Cal. The few

Cal students who still care about driving social
change now work to bring it about through the
system, instead of by tearing the system down.
Which university does that sound like? Maybe
that college that had not one, but four Supreme
Court justices throughout most of the past 20
years. I 'm sure that Cal will soon learn working
through the system instead of against it is not
only more effective, it's also generally much,
much more profitable. Which is, of course, why
Cal students just don't protest like they used to.
But enough about culture shifts — I want
to take some cheap shots. Let's take a look at
Cal's faculty and alumni list. It includes such
notable figures as the Unabomber, the
Wicked Witch of the West and Scar from the
Lion King. (Those flying monkeys? Just one of
Cal's many experiments designed to flout all
reasonable standards of ethics.)
On a similar note, Cal's mascot is a bear
already really original — named Oski. Oski.
Honestly, it sounds like a Russian word for
vomit, as in: "Aw. no! Olga oski'd all over the
glasnost again!" And I'm not even mentioning
the fact that the bear looks like a children's TV
show reject with a bad case of scabies.
Now. to be fair,our mascot is a color. A pret
ty good color, but a color nonetheless. And in
protest to the lameness of our school's mascot,
the Stanford Band created their own mascot: a
tree. ('lTiey originally proposed the Robber
Barons as a mascot, but our alumni protested.
Since then, the campus sketch comedy troupe
has purloined the title.)
So, sure, maybe having a tree for a mascot
sounds lame. But I guarantee our tree rocks out
more than Oski ever will. Being the Tree is an
honor on our campus, while I imagine that
Oski's empty shell is filled by some socially

awkward outcast (mostly because I don't think
there's really any other kind of person who
goes to Cal). Most importantly, I doubt Oski
has ever been kicked out of an athletic event for
having a . 157 BAG Yeah, that was all Tree.
Here at Stanford, people often forget how
much Cal hates us. See, for all that we might
say. most of us are actually OK with Cal; many
of us have friends who go there. What we
never seem to get is why they don't like us;
we're smart, interesting, attractive and. above
all else.astoundingly humble. Cal students are
similar, except they are only allowed to have
two of those traits.
For whatever reason, though. Cal hates us
like it used to hate the Man. I once met a Cal
fan after Big Game my freshman year at In-N-
Out, who told me about the eight-story bonfire
Cal holds before Big Game. I le told me how he
was scared to go because it struck him as eeri
ly reminiscent of Nazi rallies. Strangely, he isn't
the only Cal fan I've met to draw this compar
ison.
And maybe that reflexivity shows that Cal
isn't all bad. Kids there are usually decently
smart (football team excepted), and really, a
good number of them probably weren't that
many applications away from getting in here.
Ilie only difference. I suppose, is that we're
going to come back to campus on Saturday
with the Axe.
Oh. and that Cal sucks.

Kevin will host a roundtable discussion of Cat's,
suckage with columnist/arch nemesis Jennu Re j
hack tonight at X p.m. in Campbell Recital Hall.
