## Big Game historical superlatives 
### 
Do you remember when your high school
yearbook assigned senior superlatives
like "most academic," "best dressed"
and "most likely to write a column in college"?
(I still don't know how I lost that last one.) Well,
in honor of my senior Big Game. I've plumbed
the Stanford Daily archives and compiled a list
of Big Game historical superlatives.
"Most lucrative" Big Game moment. 1X92
— Leading up to the first-ever Big Game,
Stanford football team manager (and future
President) Herbert Hoover printed a conser
vative 10,000 tickets for a 15.000-person ca
pacity stadium. When more than 15.000 fans
showed up to the game, Ifoover improvised a
collection of coins at the stadium gates to ac
commodate the unexpected enthusiasts. As a
result, Stanford football earned a total of
$30.(KX)and was thus well-financed for the en
tire following season.
"Most absent-minded" Big Game moment,
1892 — Hoover (and everyone else involved, it
seems) forgot to bring a. um. football to the
first-ever Big Game. Kickoff was delayed an
hour.
"Most tragic" Big Game moment (without a
doubt), 1900 — On Nov. 29, 1900. during the
eighth Big Game, Stanford and Berkeley

played in their traditional San Francisco venue.
1 kindreds of spectators piled onto the roof of
the S.F. and Pacific Glass Works building near
15th and Folsom Street for a bird's eye view of
the festivities.The roof of the building, howev
er. was not designed to sustain such a heavy
weight and collapsed.Thirteen people died and
nearly HH) more were injured in the collapse.
Most of these unfortunate victims, who were
kids aged six to 19, fell several stories onto blaz
ingly hot furnaces and glass vats.
"Best non-athletic feud" related to Big
Game, 1921 — In the years after World War I
and a return to normalcy. Stanford and Cal
launched a contest to see who could complete a
football stadium first. Stanford won by opening
Stanford Stadium for Big Game on Nov. 21,
1921 to 62,740 fans.The stadium cost $21 1,000
and was. at the time, the second-biggest venue
in the country. Memorial Stadium in Berkley
wouldn't open for another two years.
"Best winning streak to include" Big Game,
1926 — With coach Pop Warner (yeah, THE
Pop Warner) at the helm, the Stanford team
went 10-0-1. including a resounding 41-6 victo
ry over Cal and a tie with Alabama in the Rose
Bowl. At the end of the season, we were de
clared unofficial national football champions.

Those were the days.
"Worst refereeing" at Big Game, IW2 —
Enough said.
"Most business-savvy..." Big Game ma
neuver, 2(K)7 — Starting in 2(X)f>, the National
Football League began gobbling up every
phrase remotely associated with the Super
Bowl. Then they set their sights on the phrase
"Big Game" and the resulting upheaval of 4
century of tradition. Stanford and Cal objected
and the NFL relented in mid-2(K)7. And our
protestations were in good company: Wal-
Mart. Taco Bell. Pizza Hut, Anheuser-Busch,
Kellogg and Dell all objected to different parts
of the NFLs application to the Patent Office,
"Best personal experience" at Big Game,
2(M)7 — After years of bad football, losses and
student frustration, Stanford snapped the five
year losing streak at home. I rushed the field
and danced around in jubilation.
"Most embarrassing personal experience"
at Big Game, 2(X)7 — Dancing around in jubi
lation.
