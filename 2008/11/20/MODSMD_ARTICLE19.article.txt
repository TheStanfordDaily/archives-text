## Why America needs a recession 
### 
Tomorrow, when people go to work, they
will he fighting to keep their jobs. They
will be lighting against the imminent
and surging tide of consumer debt that is
threatening to engulf the nation. They will be
fighting to maintain ownership of their homes
or put food on the table. Some might be fight
ing to pay for basic utilities or cover a hospital
bill.
And, although it may seem unclear to
many, these same people are fighting against a
culture of apathy, isolation and competition
that has contributed to the destruction of so
cial capital and the creation of a divided
America.
Ilie last time something so destructive
shook our country was September 2(H) I .when
hijacked airplanes had just hit the World Trade

Center. But this time, there is no foreign
enemy to combat or interrogate. We are the
enemy. We have developed and nurtured a
culture that encourages all-but-fanatical capi
talism at the expense of our neighbors. We are
all responsible.
Every time we swiped our credit cards for
purchases we couldn't afford, every time we
made business decisions without looking past
the numbers and every time we checked work
email instead of playing with our children, we
blatantly ignored the humanity within all of
us. We ignored our limits, our feelings and our
beliefs. And we were never held accountable
for our neglect.
It's easy to quantify the damage done in
numbers and percents. One needs not look
further than the latest New York l imes. The
data is simultaneously astonishing and sober
ing. Rut these numbers could not possibly
quantify the true cultural damage that has sent
America reeling. We have erected a society
that values isolated virtual interaction over
family dinners, and stagnation over innova
tion. We have not pushed one another to suc
ceed, and we have failed to hold each other up
in llie face of opposition.The American econ

omy will recover with time,hut it will he an en
tirely different feat to reverse American apa
thy.
Although the staggering numerical statis
tics that crowd the front page of national
newspapers cannot portray the devastating
cultural damage, they do demonstrate that
Americans have gotten hit where it hurts:
their pocketbooks, retirement funds and in
vestments. All is definitely not well. What does
this mean? l irst and foremost, Americans are
learning the hard way that there is no such
thing as free money Second, they are learning
that it doesn't necessarily hurt to have a com
munity to fall back on. And third, they are
learning that their children depend on invest
ments in the future.
These investments take many forms:
money, public policy and governmental lead
ership. lint they also take on a more personal
form: social capital. 'Ilie future of our society
depends on the construction and maintenance
of personal connections that drive each of us
to be better, more mindful, more responsible
and kinder individuals. And we certainly have
