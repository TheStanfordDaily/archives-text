## Tennis travels to Hawaii 
### JOSH ALVAREZ 
The Stanford men's tennis team will con
clude its fall season with its annual dual match
at University of Hawaii on Nov. 25.The match
is part of an annual Thanksgiving trip to
Hawai'i that the team takes.
Last year's match was a very successful orfe
for Stanford. The Cardinal almost swept the
Rainbow Warriors, winning 6-1. However.
Hawai'i was undermanned and had to forfeit
a singles and doubles match.
The Rainbow Warriors' success this fall
season has been centered around one player:
sophomore Dennis Lajola. Lajola, ranked No.
89 in the nation, fell in the Round of 32 at the
Ail-American Championships earlier this
month. He is one of three ranked players on
the Hawai'i roster, joining No. 53 Sascha
Heinemann and No. 76 Andreas Weber.
"Hawai'i is going to be tough â€” we have to
be ready to play," head coach John Whitlinger
said. "They made the NCAA tournament last
year and lost to Pepperdine who we lost to as
well. They are a good team. Their top three
guys are solid and have been around for a
while.
"It's going to be nice [on] the islands, but
we have business to take care of," he contin
ued.
Fourth-ranked Alex Clayton will rejoin the
rest of the Cardinal squad after his first round
loss at the National Indoor Championships.
Clayton fell in a three-hour match against
Notre Dame's No. 25 Brett Helgeson 6-3, 7-
6(5), 7-5.
"Alex had kind of a rough time at [In
doors], but he had a great attitude after the
match." Whitlinger said. "I like how he's been
carrying himself during practice and. well,
things like this happen. Alex has been able to
hold himself up and have upbeat attitudes
even after tough losses."
Looking back on the fall season. Whitlinger
and his staff were pleased with the team's per
formance during practice and competitions.
"Fall went by really quickly. I am very
pleased with the work done during practice.
Doubles has become a priority and will be-

GAME NOTES: The Stanford men's tennis team will head
across the Pacific Ocean next week to take on the Uni
versity of Hawaii. The match is part of an annual trip to
Hawaii for the team over Thanksgiving break. A year
ago, Stanford beat the Rainbow Warriors 6-1, though
Hawaii did have to forfeit both a singles and a doubles
match.

come very important during the season. I'm
really pleased with the overall play of the
guys." he said.
After Hawai'i. the Cardinal will not meet
for practice or competition until after the win
ter holidays due to NCAA rules limiting the
amount of days teams can practice and com
pete.
"The guys need to understand that they
better he ready come January" Whitlinger
said. "I expect them to do as much as they can
during break because, as I've told them and
will tell them. January will be here quickly and
things will start pretty quick."
The Cardinal coach was emphatic in stress
ing to his team what it would take to stay com
petitive this season.
"We are really going to press on them that
they have to be in the weight room or hitting
tennis balls during the break," he said.
"There's nothing because of the NCAA we
can force them to do so all we can do is really
push them to prepare. I want them to enjoy
their holiday, but they need to be ready to go."
Stanford enters the match having struggled
through injuries to several players so far this
season. But the Cardinal looks to be on the
mend as the fall season winds down.
"The foreseeable issue that any coach has

to worry about is the injury factor," Whitlinger
said. "Our guys have gotten humped during
fall. [Freshman] Ryan Thacher hasn't played
yet. [senior Matt] Bruch is doing a good job.
but has had [injury] issues, and [freshman
Bradley] Klahn has his own. too. But the med
ical stall has done a great job with the guys and

we're looking to having everybody ready to
play this season."
The Cardinal's dual against the Rainbow
Warriors is scheduled for Tuesday, at 3 p.m.
PST.
