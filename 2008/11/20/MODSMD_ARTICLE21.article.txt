### CHRISTIAN L. TOM KENAN JIANG STAFF WRITERS 
The No. 2 Stanford men's swim team will be
heading to theTexas A&M Invite in College Station.
Texas for an early season tune-up against some of
the nation's best teams.The meet will take place for
three days over the Thanksgiving break and will be
an opportunity for the Stanford swimmers to gauge
where they are in their training and what they will
need to do to achieve NCAA championship meet
qualification times.
"I'm predicting some very fast swims," senior
captain Jason Dunford said."There will be some sur
prises â€” people going much faster than they expect

LSU,Texas A&M have all got a smattering of really
good swimmers; they'll all want to come out firing.
Overall, we are all fired up and getting ready for a re
ally great weekend."

Among other things, this trip should help familiarize

Texas finished second and Arizona finished first.

win the title this year, with perennial rivals Cal, Ari

possibility of making NCAA A or B cuts and con
tribute team points. Freshman Rob Andrews is an
Olympic Trials qualifier in several mid-distance
freestyle events and will also swim the 200-yard but

Freshman Bobby Bollier, a finalist in this sum

Cardinal in the longer 400 m IM. 2(X)m fly. and the
500 m freestyle. Sophomore Scotty Korotkin. also an
Olympic Trials qualifier in the 1500 m freestyle, will
swim the 5(X)m, l(XX)ni,and 1,650 m events for Stan
