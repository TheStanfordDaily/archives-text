# MEN'S SWIMMING
## Swim takes on Texas A & M Invite 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM KENAN JIANG STAFF WRITERS 
The No. 2 Stanford men's swim team will be
heading to theTexas A&M Invite in College Station.
Texas for an early season tune-up against some of
the nation's best teams.The meet will take place for
three days over the Thanksgiving break and will be
an opportunity for the Stanford swimmers to gauge
where they are in their training and what they will
need to do to achieve NCAA championship meet
qualification times.
"I'm predicting some very fast swims," senior
captain Jason Dunford said."There will be some sur
prises — people going much faster than they expect
ed. I think we'll have some good competition: SMU,
LSU,Texas A&M have all got a smattering of really
good swimmers; they'll all want to come out firing.
Overall, we are all fired up and getting ready for a re
ally great weekend."
Hie NCAA championships in March 2(X)*>will be
held this year at College Station: the same pool that
Stanford is going to be swimming in this weekend.
Among other things, this trip should help familiarize
the team with theTexas A&M facility.
While 14 members of the Stanford men's team
swam at the last NCAA championship meet with
the team finishing in third place, Stanford will now
have the support of a strong freshman recruiting
class while also benefiting from the experience last
year brought for the upperclassmen. At last year's
NCAA championships, Stanford narrowly edged
out fourth place Cal for the third place finish, as
Texas finished second and Arizona finished first.
Stanford is considered to be a strong contender to
win the title this year, with perennial rivals Cal, Ari
zona, Texas, Auburn and Michigan also vying for the
NCAA title.
Stanford this year is particularly strong in the dis
tance freestyles. In the event's training group. Stan
ford has seven top-notch swimmers who all have the
possibility of making NCAA A or B cuts and con
tribute team points. Freshman Rob Andrews is an
Olympic Trials qualifier in several mid-distance
freestyle events and will also swim the 200-yard but
terfly for the team.
Freshman Bobby Bollier, a finalist in this sum
mer's 2008 US Swimming Trials, will compete for the
Cardinal in the longer 400 m IM. 2(X)m fly. and the
500 m freestyle. Sophomore Scotty Korotkin. also an
Olympic Trials qualifier in the 1500 m freestyle, will
swim the 5(X)m, l(XX)ni,and 1,650 m events for Stan
ford throughout the season, hoping to make his first
NCAA championship meet. Freshman Chad La
Tourette is a World University Games
gold medalist even before starting his
Stanford career, and finished third
(one spot shy from an Olympic team
spot) in the 15(X)m freestyle at the Tri
als. La Tourette will focus on the 500 m
and 1,650 m freestyle this year.
Sophomore David Mosko, a re
turning All-American from last year
for the 800 m freestyle relay team, will
swim the 200 m, 500 m, 1650 m
freestyles and also the 2(X)m fly over
the course of the season. Freshman
Trevor Scheid is a versatile freestyle
swimmer that can swim anything from
the 100 m all the way to the 1,650 m and
has been used as mainly a distance
swimmer this season. Freshman
Michael Zoldos, an Arizona high
school state champion in the 200 m and
500 m, adds depth to the distance
squad and will swim the 500 m and
1,650 m throughout the season.
While a NCAA A cut time will au
tomatically enter a swimmer for the
championship meet, NCAA B cuts
will take the top remaining swimmers
according to the nations' best times for

consideration in eligibility to swim at
the big meet at the end of the season.
The Texas A&M meet will hopefully
be a place for some of the team's best
swimmers to contend for B cuts. With
the advent of new suit technology and
because of the significant improve
ment in swimming times seen in last
year's Olympic year NCAA meet,
NCAA A cuts have gotten significant
ly faster. Many A cuts could only have
five or six swimmers from the entire
nation achieve the time standard.
"I think we have a very balanced
team this year," senior Paul Kornfeld
said. "You always want to have both
experience from upperclassmen and
enthusiasm, especially from the fresh
men. Every class is going to contribute
this year at every level."
"We have a lot of people that are
training really well and are going to
surprise people with our depth," he
continued."We have the talent to be in
position for a national championship,
but this season is going to be about
constantly raising the bar and our ex
pectations so that we achieve our
goals."
