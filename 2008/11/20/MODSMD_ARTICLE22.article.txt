# CROSS COUNTRY
## Cross country gears up for NCAAs 
### DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford men's and women's cross
country teams are headed back to the
NCAA Championships. After taking sec
ond and third, respectively, at the NCAA
West Regionals last Saturday, the teams will
travel toTerre Haute. Ind. for the final race
on November 24.
"Considering the competition I thought
things went well," first year Head Coach
Jason Dunn said. Dunn, who was hired this
summer after serving as the head coach at
the University of Virginia, has done an ex
cellent job in his first season on The Farm.
His lineups have featured several fresh
men, yet the teams have had great seasons
thus far.
On the men's side, Stanford was led by
freshman Chris Derrick, who finished fifth
in the 10-kilometer with a time of 28:44.31.
Running smoothly in the middle of the pack
for almost the entire race. Derrick kicked it
in towards the end and out-sprinted a fresh

man from Oregon at the finish. It was his
first time running a 10-kilometer race.
"We are very lucky to have (Derrick],"
Dunn said. "I'm glad that he got this one
under his belt, [it was] a really positive race
for him. I think he's going to do really well
at Nationals."
Oregon, the No. 1 team in the nation,
won the West Regionals with 38 points.
Stanford, ranked No. 3, had 72 to secure the
second and final automatic bid to the
NCAAs. Senior Garrett Heath was the Car
dinal's second top-10 finisher, coming in
tenth with a time of 29:19.44. Senior Hakon
DeVries finished 13th. and sophomores El
liot Heath (younger brother of Garrett)
and Jacob Riley finished 21st and 23rd, re
spectively, rounding out a solid day for the
men with all scorers finishing in the top-25.
"(The race] went exactly how we wanted
it to," Garrett Heath said. "Regionals is just
about making it to [Nationals].
"|NCAAs] will be a great opportunity
for us. We want to be [at least] top three."
In the women's six-kilometer race. Stan

ford finished third and earned an at-large
bid to the NCAA Championships based on
the team's season-long performance. Here
it was another freshman leading the way for
the Cardinal, this time Laurynne Chetelat,
who finished ninth in 20:17.34. Senior Katie
Harrington narrowly missed out on a top
-10 finish, covering the course in 20:20.09 to
cross the line in 11th place. I larrington was
followed by two more top-25 finishers for
Stanford, senior Alicia Follmar (20th) and
junior Kate Niehaus (23rd).
"It was the best race women have run all
year," Dunn said.
The women's race was won by the top
team in the nation, Washington. The
Huskies competed without two of their best
runners but still scored only 25 points, best
ing No. 2 Oregon, which was second with 62.
The Cardinal finished with 91.
"Each race we have been able to put
forth more and more of what we are capa
ble of." said Harrington, who was part of
last year's National Championship
team. "We have a young team and
we have a lot of room for upward
growth. [NCAAs] will he a good
race for everyone."
It's a whole new ballgame now
that the squads move onto the
NCAA Championships. 31 teams
from across the nation will flock to
Terre Haute next Monday. The
Stanford women are the three time
defending NCAA champions,
though their task looks harder this
year with several teams running
very well. The men. who did not run
up to their potential at NCAAs last
year, are very capable of bringing a
trophy back to The Farm for a
fourth year in a row.
Though the favorites are Wash
ington on the women's side and
Oregon on the men's, there are still
many kilometers to run before a
winner can be crowned. The pre
meet favorites are, according to
Harrington,"going to have to hurt to
win it."
Hopefully Stanford will hurt just
enough to bring some hardware
back to The Farm. The women's
race is set for 9 a.m Pacific Time and
the men's will go off at 9:45 a.m.
