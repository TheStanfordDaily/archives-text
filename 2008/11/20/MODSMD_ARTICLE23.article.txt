# Girl signs baseball contract
## 
### 
You may not be able to use
the phrase "you throw like a
girl" as an insult anymore.
In fact, after what Eri Yoshida just
accomplished in Japan, it may one
day be hard to call it anything but a
compliment.
Yoshida. a 16 year-old school
girl. decided she wanted to learn
how to throw a knuckleball after
seeing a video of Boston Red Sox
pitcher Tim Wakefield several
years ago. She has since learned so
well that, come April, she will be
doing her best to baffle profession
al hitters with it.
No, she didn't win a contest and
this isn't some gimmick. The Kobe
9 Cruise — a newly formed expan
sion team — selected her in the
draft earlier this week, making her
the first female professional in the
Japanese League.
Hey, if it gets me a professional
contract. I'd be proud to throw like
a girl.
But why is this significant? It's
not like she is playing in the major
leagues or even the highest level of
baseball in Japan. She certainly
isn't the youngest professional
baseball player or even the first fe
male to ever get paid to play.
Most of these feats occurred in
the United States during the Sec
ond World War. when most regular
players were fighting overseas.
During that time, Joe Nuxhall be
came the youngest man to ever
play in the majors, debuting for the
Cincinnati Reds at age 15 in 1944.
And several women have pitched
in the minor leagues — eveii
against major league teams in exhi
bitions prior to the war. And. of
course, there was the All-Americart
Girls Professional Baseball League
(AAGPL), which ran from 1943 to
1954 and was featured in the 199?
film, "A League of Their Own."
So this isn't exactly a first-time
event. But what is significant about
Eri Yoshida is that she has crossed
the gender barrier in professional
sports at a time when real and last
ing progress of women into base
ball is an actual possibility.
Of the four major North Ameri«
can sports, baseball has always
been the one with the most realistic
chance of women competing di
rectly against men. In football',
hockey and even basketball, ath*
letes compete in direct physical op
position to each other — there i§
regular physical contact and they
directly use their strength and size
to tackle, check and otherwise im*
pede each other. This puts women
at a disadvantage and would alscj
be socially unacceptable to many. •
But in baseball the competition
is not physically direct. How an in
dividual's strength or speed com
pares directly to another's is much
less important. Baseball, instead, is
a game geared towards precision
and perception,and there are many
ways to be successful without using
brute strength.
Additionally Major League
Baseball, easily the most important
and influential baseball organiza
tion in the world, has recognized
this possibility and recently
amended its rulebook to allow for
women to compete. As part of the
league's annual rule updates and
changes, it inserted a clarifying
note in 2007, stating that any use of
the words "he. him and his shall be
deemed to be a reference to she,
her or hers where applicable." In
effect, the doorway for a woman to
play professionally in America
against the best players in the
world has already been opened.
But the most important factor
leading towards the possibility of
women in Major League Baseball
is obviously the ever-increasing
drive towards gender equality in
our society. When the AAGPL
broke up in 1954 there was no pos
sibility of its stars continuing to
play alongside men in MLB.Today
this window is there. Gender differ
ences have become much less im
portant in determining a person's
ability. Consider how close both
Sarah Palin and Hilary Clinton
came to the White House as the
most striking example of this
progress.

The Inside Pilch
If a major league general man
ager decides that a woman has the
capacity to improve his ball club,
she will get a chance. And if the
first is a success, more will follow.
For now the most likely (and prob
ably easiest) place for a woman to
break into the major leagues is as a
junk-balling reliever, like Eri
Yoshida. And perhaps there will
never be a woman that can consis
tently break 100 mph or hit 40
home runs, but that's not the only
way to make it as a successful base
ball player.

If a woman can pitch effectively,
or hit major league pitching and
play solid defense, why not let a
woman play? It is more than just
what's fair; it would be beneficial
to the game. It would sell more
tickets and expand the fan base:
two things baseball will always
pursue.
So maybe Eri Yoshida never
will make the jump across the Pa
cific and maybe her career will fiz
zle in Japan. But don't be surprised
if someday you see a woman wear
ing pinstripes under the bright
lights at a diamond near you.
