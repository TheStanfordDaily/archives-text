## Prof. Taylor addresses Senate Econ Prof. John Taylor advises Budget Committee 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
Yesterday morning, Stanford
Economics Prof. John B. Taylor
Ph.D. '73 testified before the U.S.
Senate Budget Committee about the
current international economic cri
sis. Specifically, Taylor addressed the
feasibility of a second fiscal stimulus
package similar to the stimulus pack
age passed earlier this year.
TTie Economic Stimulus Act of
2008. signed into law on Feb. 13.
awarded most American citizens tax
rebates between $300 and $1.2(X).
These tax rebates will cost the U.S.
government an estimated total of
approximately $300 billion over a
period of 10 years.
While the act was intended to
jumpstart a flagging economy by
providing Americans with more
expendable income, Taylor says in
his address to the Senate that the
measure was misguided.
"Policy makers need to be wary
of such short-term stimulus pro
grams," Taylor said in his address to
the senate subcommittee. "They are
unlikely to help the economy and
will increase the deficit and debt as
they did this past fiscal year."
To support his conclusion, Taylor
cited data indicating that Americans'
consumption of consumer goods did
not change appreciably after the
rebate checks were sent out in May
and June â€” in other words, that the
economy was not meaningfully stim
ulated.
In place of a second, similarly
designed stimulus package with
short-term goals, Taylor urged the
senators to adopt a more long-term
approach to the economic crisis.
"The mantra most often heard
during the debates about the first
stimulus was that it should be tempo
rary, targeted and timely "Taylor told
the subcommittee. "Going forward,
we clearly need a new set of princi
ples and a new mantra. Based on
recent and many past experiences, as
well as much economic theory, I rec
ommend an alternative mantra: per
manent. pervasive and predictable."
Within his suggested long-term

approach was a commitment to
keeping income tax rates where they
currently are and the implementa
tion of more responsible govern
ment spending in order to help the
U.S. government balance the budget.
Taylor told The Daily in a phone
interview that he was guardedly
optimistic about the senators' recep
tion of his testimony.
"The senators seemed to like my
new mantra and alliteration," he
said.
Taylor also described his mentali
ty going into his testimony in front of
the Senate.
"I tried to use basic economics

such as [what] we teach in Econ 1A
to show why the stimulus package of
last spring and summer did not
work." Taylor said. "I wanted the
senators to learn from this that such
temporary measures are unlikely to
be effective this time."
Taylor, who authored the text
book used in the Economics 1A
course, received his Ph.D. in eco
nomics from Stanford in 1973 and
has taught at the University since the
early 1980s. Since then, he has
received several teaching prizes.
Taylor has also been active in pol
itics throughout his career. He served
as the undersecretary of theTreasurv

Department during President
George W. Bush's first term, and was
a member of the President's Council
of Economic Advisers during the
administrations of Gerald R. F r ord
and George H.W. Bush.
In 1993, he proposed the Taylor
Rule, an economic principle that has
become fundamental to modern
monetary policy theory.
Taylor was reserved in his assess
ment of the current worldwide eco
nomic crisis and the world economy's
immediate prospects. He has indicat
ed. however, his approval of world
leaders' willingness to take action.
As an example, he cited the G-20

summit that took place this past
weekend among the leaders of the
20 most advanced nations in the
world to address the economic situa
tion.
"It is significant that the leaders
of the G-20 met at all." Taylor said.
"It is the first time this has hap
pened. and every leader came. They
focused on economics, not politics.
Their statement was broad rather
than specific, but they were forceful
in their support for open markets
and against protectionism."
