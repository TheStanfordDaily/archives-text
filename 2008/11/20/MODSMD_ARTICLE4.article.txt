# HOW SWEET IT IS
## Women's soccer in NCAA Sweet 16 
### NATE ADAMS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After starting off NCAA Tournament play with a
pair of impressive victories, the Stanford women's soccer
team has cracked the Sweet 16 for the third consecutive
year and will face off against Rutgers on Friday night.
The winner of that match will advance to the Elite Eight,
and a week later will play either Portland or James
Madison for a chance at the Final Four.
The Rutgers Scarlet Knights (14-6-1) have the sec
ond-lowest win total of any team still alive in the tourna
ment. ;ind were unranked and unseeded at its outset. Hut
they defeated two talented and ranked opponents (Penn

St.and No. 4 seed Oklahoma St.) to advance to the third
round, having lost by more than a goal only once this
year. The Lady Knights are riding the momentum of an
exciting penalty.-kick victory over Oklahoma State in
which every Rutgers player scored.
The Cardinal coaches and players take every oppo
nent seriously, regardless of their record. Head coach
Paul Ratcliffe, recently named the Pacific-10
Conference's coach of the year, knows that every team
in the Sweet 16 deserves to be there and recogni/es the
Scarlet Knights as a legitimate threat.
