# HOW SWEET IT IS
## Women's soccer in NCAA Sweet 16 
### NATE ADAMS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After starting off NCAA Tournament play with a
pair of impressive victories, the Stanford women's soccer
team has cracked the Sweet 16 for the third consecutive
year and will face off against Rutgers on Friday night.
The winner of that match will advance to the Elite Eight,
and a week later will play either Portland or James
Madison for a chance at the Final Four.
The Rutgers Scarlet Knights (14-6-1) have the sec
ond-lowest win total of any team still alive in the tourna
ment. ;ind were unranked and unseeded at its outset. Hut
they defeated two talented and ranked opponents (Penn

St.and No. 4 seed Oklahoma St.) to advance to the third
round, having lost by more than a goal only once this
year. The Lady Knights are riding the momentum of an
exciting penalty.-kick victory over Oklahoma State in
which every Rutgers player scored.
The Cardinal coaches and players take every oppo
nent seriously, regardless of their record. Head coach
Paul Ratcliffe, recently named the Pacific-10
Conference's coach of the year, knows that every team
in the Sweet 16 deserves to be there and recogni/es the
Scarlet Knights as a legitimate threat.

•'We've played lliem in the past," he said.
"They're a strong team, they're well-coached,
and they have some talented players. It will he
a good test for us."
Indeed, these two teams have squared off
twice before, both times with Ratcliffe at
Stanford's helm. Both games were Stanford
victories, the most recent coming in a 4-1 reg
ular-season win last year.
Stanford (20-1-1) earned its way to the
third round primarily thanks to its explosive
offense. Hie Cardinal women outscored their
opponents 69-7 in the regular season and led
the Pac-1() in every major offensive statistic.
In their two tournament games so far. they
dominated two talented opponents: UC
Santa Barbara by a 2-0 score, and Kansas by
an astounding 5-0 score. Still more impres
sive: every goal in the Kansas game was
scored by a different Stanford player.
Two of Stanford's key offensive players —
freshmen Lindsay Taylor and Teresa Noyola
— were honored last week with places on the
Pac-10 All Conference First Team. Taylor, the
Pac-10's leading goal-scorer, was named Pac
-10 Freshman of the Year and all three of Stan
ford s starting freshman (Noyola and Taylor,
along with midfielder Camille Levin) were
named to the conference's All-Freshman
team.
Given Stanford's prolific offense, it is easy
to overlook the significance of the zeroes at
the other end of the final scores in this tourna

ment. Both shutouts were products of an im
pressive defense that will prove crucial if
Stanford is to have success against the tourna
ment's tougher participants.
Defender Alison Falk. a senior and team
captain, is a member of the Pac-1() All-Con
ference Second Team and a major leader on
and off the field. She had several key blocks
and steals in both tournament victories, and
clearly has an appreciation for the impor
tance of stopping the other team this week
end.
"I think this weekend we defended well
not only as a backline, but as a team, which is
really important," she said. "The defending
starts up top with our forwards, and as the
tournament advances, defending together as
a team will become increasingly important."
There is no question that the Cardinal will
have to continue its stellar play on both sides
of the ball to do well both against Rutgers and
the rest of the NCAA field. 'ITie team's main
point of focus, however — and the potential
'x factor' that could push the Cardinal over
the top — is a bit more intangible in Falk's
eyes.
"The most important thing for us in the
tournament is to have the intensity and desire
to win every time we step on the field." she
said. "We have the talent to win. we just need
to make sure that we come out with a great
deal of energy."

GAME NOTES: The Stanford women's soccer team is back
to the NCAA Sweet 16 for the third straight year. The
Cardinal will take on Rutgers in hopes of advancing to
the Final Eight. Stanford has lost both prior Sweet 16
appearances, but is strong enough this year to come
out on top. Rutgers upset the No. 4 seed in Stanford's
side of the draw, Oklahoma State, to advance.

two weeks, the Cardinal will be glad to be
playing on its home turf — a perk that goes
along with being a No. 1 seed, and is as much
a privilege as it is a motivator, especially for
seniors like Falk.
"It has been great playing at home for the
tournament — I definitely wasn't ready for
our game against [Arizona State] to be my
last game on our home field," Falk said.
"Knowing that every game could be my last
game as a college player, and at home, only
drives me to bring my best every time I step
on the field, and do what I can to make sure
our team does as well."
Hie Sweet 16 match against Rutgers is set
for this Friday at 7 p.m. at Laird Q. Cagan Sta

pressive defense that will prove crucial if
Stanford is to have success against the tourna
ment's tougher participants.
Defender Alison Falk. a senior and team
captain, is a member of the Pac-1() All-Con
ference Second Team and a major leader on
and off the field. She had several key blocks
and steals in both tournament victories, and
clearly has an appreciation for the impor
tance of stopping the other team this week
end.
"I think this weekend we defended well
not only as a backline, but as a team, which is
really important," she said. "The defending
starts up top with our forwards, and as the
tournament advances, defending together as
a team will become increasingly important."
There is no question that the Cardinal will
have to continue its stellar play on both sides
of the ball to do well both against Rutgers and
the rest of the NCAA field. 'ITie team's main
point of focus, however — and the potential
'x factor' that could push the Cardinal over
the top — is a bit more intangible in Falk's
eyes.
"The most important thing for us in the
tournament is to have the intensity and desire
to win every time we step on the field." she
said. "We have the talent to win. we just need
to make sure that we come out with a great
deal of energy."
Regardless of what happens over the next

GAME NOTES: The Stanford women's soccer team is back
to the NCAA Sweet 16 for the third straight year. The
Cardinal will take on Rutgers in hopes of advancing to
the Final Eight. Stanford has lost both prior Sweet 16
appearances, but is strong enough this year to come
out on top. Rutgers upset the No. 4 seed in Stanford's
side of the draw, Oklahoma State, to advance.

two weeks, the Cardinal will be glad to be
playing on its home turf — a perk that goes
along with being a No. 1 seed, and is as much
a privilege as it is a motivator, especially for
seniors like Falk.
"It has been great playing at home for the
tournament — I definitely wasn't ready for
our game against [Arizona State] to be my
last game on our home field," Falk said.
"Knowing that every game could be my last
game as a college player, and at home, only
drives me to bring my best every time I step
on the field, and do what I can to make sure
our team does as well."
Hie Sweet 16 match against Rutgers is set
for this Friday at 7 p.m. at Laird Q. Cagan Sta
dium, where a full-capacity crowd is expected.
