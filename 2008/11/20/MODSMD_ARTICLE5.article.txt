## Stanford Labor Action Coalition questions contractors, living wage 
### MIKE DING SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Almost two years ago. the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition (SLAC) organized a hunger strike protest
ing the University's living wage policy for contracted
workers. Now. SLAC is alleging that the University
has failed to live up to the promises it made to end the
2006 hunger strike, and that employees still are not
paid enough to meet the high cost of living in the Bay
Area.
The preferred contractors list
SLAC President David Mitchell '09 said the
University had agreed, among other things, that all
University departments would receive a list of pre
ferred contractors by Sept. 1.2007. Each of those pre
ferred contractors must agree to pay all of their work
ers a living wage, regardless of any loopholes they
could exploit. Departments would then have to hire
contractors exclusively from that list, unless they had
extremely compelling non-financial or financial rea
sons to do so.
Bui Mitchell said the preferred contractors list had
not been accurate in the past.
"There have been contractors on the so-called pre
ferred contractors list that didn't pay their employees
a living wage." he said. "Right now. we're trying to get
the new. accurate contractor's list online."
"The University started making audits of all their
contractors in September, and one of the contractors
has already been discovered to have not paid some of
its employees a living wage." he added.

Mitchell said the problem with the preferred con
tractor list was that the University's letters to contrac
tors had not sufficiently informed them about the
requirements needed to be a preferred contractor.
"The University was basically sending out a letter
that didn't make it clear that companies would be
penalized — through not being prioritized in the con
tract bidding process — if they didn't agree to be pre
ferred contractors." he said.
Director of Purchasing Operations Stefani
Fukushima said the administration doesn't mandate
that only preferred contractors can do business with
the University, because this would discriminate
against small businesses.
One stipulation in the contractor compliance
agreement is that if the contractor's aggregate value of
contracts does not exceed $100,000 per year, then it
does not necessarily have to pay all of its employees a
living wage.
"We have to educate the University departments
about the contractors." Fukushima said. "But we don't
say 'No, you can't do businesses with somebody.'
Otherwise we'd be cutting out small businesses, many
of which are owned by minorities or women. We have
obligations to do business with small businesses that
have different concerns from bigger firms."
However. Fukushima emphasized that if contac
tors agree to be preferred contractors, they must agree
to pay all their employees a living wage, no matter
what. The preferred contract list is then distributed to
University departments as a recommendation — not
a requirement.
"The University can easily see
those who have already agreed to the
living wage terms." she said. "And yes.
there's an advantage to that."

With regard to the mistake on the
previous contractors list. Fukushima
said the Procurement Office had been
conducting extensive audits of all the
companies on the list, and the
University had discovered that one
company was paying one of its
employees less than the living wage
standard. However, Fukushima
assured The Daily that the problem
has been resolved and that the com

pany in question had paid full restitu
tions to the employee.
The living wage
Another one of SLAC's criticisms
of the University is that its current
standard for a living wage is too low.
According to the University's current
policy, the living wage minimum is
$11.15 per hour if health benefits are
provided, and $12.59 if no health ben

efits are provided.
According to Mitchell, SLAC
believes this wage level is too low to
allow Stanford's subcontracted
employees to subsist in the Bay Area.
SLAC compared the current living
wage at Stanford to the recommend
ed minimum living wage for raising a
family in California from a study con
ducted by the non-profit, non-partisan
organization California Budget

Project.
According to that study, the mini
mum wage needed for a Bay Area
family with two working parents is
$18.53 per hour for each parent. The
wage accounts for a variety of basic
needs such as housing/utilities, health
care, food and transportation. The
report, "Making Ends Meet: How
Much Does It Cost to Raise a Family
in California," surveyed a variety of

living expenses in Alameda. Contra
Costa. Marin, Napa. San Francisco.
San Mateo. Santa Clara. Santa Cruz.
Solano and Sonoma counties.
SLAC has conducted workshops
with subcontracted employees at
Stanford, and through these work
shops. Stanford contracted workers
have told stories about making ends
meet by living in cars, taking on addi
tional jobs that kept them from seeing
their families, moving in with other
households and even engaging in ille
gal activities such as tax evasion.
Executive Director of Human
Resources Diane Peck said in an
interview with The Daily that the
University reviews the living wage
every year and. at the same time, com
pares itself to other institutions in the
Bay Area who offer a living wage.
"You will find, as we have, that we
are the only employer outside of some
cities and counties in the Bay Area
who have stipulated a living wage." she
said. "1 think that speaks to the fact
that we took the issue seriously, we
decided that we wanted to establish a
basis for what should be a living wage.
We've taken that step, and I think that
is very much the right thing to do."
Peck said the current Stanford liv
ing wage is an average of seven to
nine other living wages offered by
public organizations in the Bay Area.
"We are able to identify seven to
nine Bay Area organizations that
have a living wage." she said. "All of
them at this point are government
agencies, such as the City of San
Francisco, the City of Oakland, etc.
We look at the Bay Area because
that's where we draw our work force
from. Our employees live in virtually
every one of the Bay Area counties."
SLAC has been critical of the
University's averaging methodology
for determining a living wage, citing
that it doesn't agree with the method
ologies of other local municipalities
and does not accurately reflect the
cost of living.
However, Peck said there really is
no definitive way of calculating a liv
ing wage through analysis of the living
costs associated with a particular
region.
"Of these seven to nine places that
have a living wage in place, none of
them has the same number," she said.
"Everyone has their own methodolo
gy for doing this."
Instead, Peck was critical of
SLAC's decision to base their criti
cism of the Stanford living wage sim
ply based on one study.
"1 have a lot more faith in looking
at seven or eight different data points,
rather than looking at just one data
point." she said. "Who knows if their
assumptions are correct, or if their
analysis is correct? I'd rather ltxik at a
variety of data points."
SLAC is currently engaged in
talks with the University regarding
the living wage issue. Mitchell said he
does not believe the group will have
to stage another fast.
"We're not planning any actions
for this week," he said. "We are try
ing to work within the channels that
the University wants us to work
with, meeting with people in the
administration. We've had pretty
good success with that, and until
they start giving us more grief, we're
trying to just come to the negotiating
table together."

"The University was basically sending out a letter
that didn't make it clear that companies would be
penalized — through not being prioritized in the con
tract bidding process — if they didn't agree to be pre
ferred contractors." he said.
Director of Purchasing Operations Stefani
Fukushima said the administration doesn't mandate
that only preferred contractors can do business with
the University, because this would discriminate
against small businesses.
One stipulation in the contractor compliance
agreement is that if the contractor's aggregate value of
contracts does not exceed $100,000 per year, then it
does not necessarily have to pay all of its employees a
living wage.
"We have to educate the University departments
about the contractors." Fukushima said. "But we don't
say 'No, you can't do businesses with somebody.'
Otherwise we'd be cutting out small businesses, many
of which are owned by minorities or women. We have
obligations to do business with small businesses that
have different concerns from bigger firms."
However. Fukushima emphasized that if contac
tors agree to be preferred contractors, they must agree
to pay all their employees a living wage, no matter
what. The preferred contract list is then distributed to
University departments as a recommendation — not
a requirement.
"The University can easily see
those who have already agreed to the
living wage terms." she said. "And yes.
there's an advantage to that."

With regard to the mistake on the
previous contractors list. Fukushima
said the Procurement Office had been
conducting extensive audits of all the
companies on the list, and the
University had discovered that one
company was paying one of its
employees less than the living wage
standard. However, Fukushima
assured The Daily that the problem
has been resolved and that the com

pany in question had paid full restitu
tions to the employee.
The living wage
Another one of SLAC's criticisms
of the University is that its current
standard for a living wage is too low.
According to the University's current
policy, the living wage minimum is
$11.15 per hour if health benefits are
provided, and $12.59 if no health ben

efits are provided.
According to Mitchell, SLAC
believes this wage level is too low to
allow Stanford's subcontracted
employees to subsist in the Bay Area.
SLAC compared the current living
wage at Stanford to the recommend
ed minimum living wage for raising a
family in California from a study con
ducted by the non-profit, non-partisan
organization California Budget

Project.
According to that study, the mini
mum wage needed for a Bay Area
family with two working parents is
$18.53 per hour for each parent. The
wage accounts for a variety of basic
needs such as housing/utilities, health
care, food and transportation. The
report, "Making Ends Meet: How
Much Does It Cost to Raise a Family
in California," surveyed a variety of

living expenses in Alameda. Contra
Costa. Marin, Napa. San Francisco.
San Mateo. Santa Clara. Santa Cruz.
Solano and Sonoma counties.
SLAC has conducted workshops
with subcontracted employees at
Stanford, and through these work
shops. Stanford contracted workers
have told stories about making ends
meet by living in cars, taking on addi
tional jobs that kept them from seeing
their families, moving in with other
households and even engaging in ille
gal activities such as tax evasion.
Executive Director of Human
Resources Diane Peck said in an
interview with The Daily that the
University reviews the living wage
every year and. at the same time, com
pares itself to other institutions in the
Bay Area who offer a living wage.
"You will find, as we have, that we
are the only employer outside of some
cities and counties in the Bay Area
who have stipulated a living wage." she
said. "1 think that speaks to the fact
that we took the issue seriously, we
decided that we wanted to establish a
basis for what should be a living wage.
We've taken that step, and I think that
is very much the right thing to do."
Peck said the current Stanford liv
ing wage is an average of seven to
nine other living wages offered by
public organizations in the Bay Area.
"We are able to identify seven to
nine Bay Area organizations that
have a living wage." she said. "All of
them at this point are government
agencies, such as the City of San
Francisco, the City of Oakland, etc.
We look at the Bay Area because
that's where we draw our work force
from. Our employees live in virtually
every one of the Bay Area counties."
SLAC has been critical of the
University's averaging methodology
for determining a living wage, citing
that it doesn't agree with the method
ologies of other local municipalities
and does not accurately reflect the
cost of living.
However, Peck said there really is
no definitive way of calculating a liv
ing wage through analysis of the living
costs associated with a particular
region.
"Of these seven to nine places that
have a living wage in place, none of
them has the same number," she said.
"Everyone has their own methodolo
gy for doing this."
Instead, Peck was critical of
SLAC's decision to base their criti
cism of the Stanford living wage sim
ply based on one study.
"1 have a lot more faith in looking
at seven or eight different data points,
rather than looking at just one data
point." she said. "Who knows if their
assumptions are correct, or if their
analysis is correct? I'd rather ltxik at a
variety of data points."
SLAC is currently engaged in
talks with the University regarding
the living wage issue. Mitchell said he
does not believe the group will have
to stage another fast.
"We're not planning any actions
for this week," he said. "We are try
ing to work within the channels that
the University wants us to work
with, meeting with people in the
administration. We've had pretty
good success with that, and until
they start giving us more grief, we're
trying to just come to the negotiating
table together."

Almost two years ago. the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition (SLAC) organized a hunger strike protest
ing the University's living wage policy for contracted
workers. Now. SLAC is alleging that the University
has failed to live up to the promises it made to end the
2006 hunger strike, and that employees still are not
paid enough to meet the high cost of living in the Bay
Area.
The preferred contractors list
SLAC President David Mitchell '09 said the
University had agreed, among other things, that all
University departments would receive a list of pre
ferred contractors by Sept. 1.2007. Each of those pre
ferred contractors must agree to pay all of their work
ers a living wage, regardless of any loopholes they
could exploit. Departments would then have to hire
contractors exclusively from that list, unless they had
extremely compelling non-financial or financial rea
sons to do so.
Bui Mitchell said the preferred contractors list had
not been accurate in the past.
"There have been contractors on the so-called pre
ferred contractors list that didn't pay their employees
a living wage." he said. "Right now. we're trying to get
the new. accurate contractor's list online."
"The University started making audits of all their
contractors in September, and one of the contractors
has already been discovered to have not paid some of
its employees a living wage." he added.

Mitchell said the problem with the preferred con
tractor list was that the University's letters to contrac
tors had not sufficiently informed them about the
requirements needed to be a preferred contractor.
"The University was basically sending out a letter
that didn't make it clear that companies would be
penalized — through not being prioritized in the con
tract bidding process — if they didn't agree to be pre
ferred contractors." he said.
