# SLAC challenges Univ.
## Stanford Labor Action Coalition questions contractors, living wage 
### MIKE DING SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Almost two years ago. the Stanford Labor Action
Coalition (SLAC) organized a hunger strike protest
ing the University's living wage policy for contracted
workers. Now. SLAC is alleging that the University
has failed to live up to the promises it made to end the
2006 hunger strike, and that employees still are not
paid enough to meet the high cost of living in the Bay
Area.
The preferred contractors list
SLAC President David Mitchell '09 said the
University had agreed, among other things, that all
University departments would receive a list of pre
ferred contractors by Sept. 1.2007. Each of those pre
ferred contractors must agree to pay all of their work
ers a living wage, regardless of any loopholes they
could exploit. Departments would then have to hire
contractors exclusively from that list, unless they had
extremely compelling non-financial or financial rea
sons to do so.
Bui Mitchell said the preferred contractors list had
not been accurate in the past.
"There have been contractors on the so-called pre
ferred contractors list that didn't pay their employees
a living wage." he said. "Right now. we're trying to get
the new. accurate contractor's list online."
"The University started making audits of all their
contractors in September, and one of the contractors
has already been discovered to have not paid some of
its employees a living wage." he added.

Mitchell said the problem with the preferred con
tractor list was that the University's letters to contrac
tors had not sufficiently informed them about the
requirements needed to be a preferred contractor.
"The University was basically sending out a letter
that didn't make it clear that companies would be
penalized — through not being prioritized in the con
tract bidding process — if they didn't agree to be pre
ferred contractors." he said.
Director of Purchasing Operations Stefani
Fukushima said the administration doesn't mandate
that only preferred contractors can do business with
the University, because this would discriminate
against small businesses.
One stipulation in the contractor compliance
agreement is that if the contractor's aggregate value of
contracts does not exceed $100,000 per year, then it
does not necessarily have to pay all of its employees a
living wage.
"We have to educate the University departments
about the contractors." Fukushima said. "But we don't
say 'No, you can't do businesses with somebody.'
Otherwise we'd be cutting out small businesses, many
of which are owned by minorities or women. We have
obligations to do business with small businesses that
have different concerns from bigger firms."
However. Fukushima emphasized that if contac
tors agree to be preferred contractors, they must agree
to pay all their employees a living wage, no matter
what. The preferred contract list is then distributed to
University departments as a recommendation — not
