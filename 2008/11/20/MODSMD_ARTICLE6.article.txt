						CLOSER LOOK AT FOOTBALL RECRUITMENT
## Making the Grade: Academics and the Pitch 
### BY WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
This week, the Daily examines Stanford football's recruiting procedure. The story is broken into
three parts: the process, the pitch and the academics and the players. This is part two: the pitch and
the academics.

Let's create a football player: Joe Receiver. Joe is the top high
school recruit in the nation. He's widely acclaimed as the next
Jerry Rice. But he's not a very good student: Joe has a 2.3 GPA
and a 900 composite on the verbal and math sections of the SAT.
It hardly matters, though â€”Joe is still NCAA-eligible, and all the
top collegiate powerhouses are trying to court him. Even schools that
have traditionally difficult admissions standards for regular students
are willing to look the other way. There are very few universities that,
despite Joe's outstanding athletic ability, won't give him the time of day.
Stanford is one of them.
"It doesn't matter if you can play." said Lance Anderson. Stanford's
defensive line coach and recruiting coordinator. "If you don't have the
grades, there's nothing we can do."
Per NCAA regulations, the program is forbidden to discuss specific
academic standards. However. Assistant Athletic Director and Director
of Football Administration Mike Eubanks was able to give a broad def
inition of what it takes to be a Stanford student athlete.
