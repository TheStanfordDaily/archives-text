# A 						CLOSER LOOK AT FOOTBALL RECRUITMENT
## Making the Grade: Academics and the Pitch 
### BY WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
This week, the Daily examines Stanford football's recruiting procedure. The story is broken into
three parts: the process, the pitch and the academics and the players. This is part two: the pitch and
the academics.

Let's create a football player: Joe Receiver. Joe is the top high
school recruit in the nation. He's widely acclaimed as the next
Jerry Rice. But he's not a very good student: Joe has a 2.3 GPA
and a 900 composite on the verbal and math sections of the SAT.
It hardly matters, though —Joe is still NCAA-eligible, and all the
top collegiate powerhouses are trying to court him. Even schools that
have traditionally difficult admissions standards for regular students
are willing to look the other way. There are very few universities that,
despite Joe's outstanding athletic ability, won't give him the time of day.
Stanford is one of them.
"It doesn't matter if you can play." said Lance Anderson. Stanford's
defensive line coach and recruiting coordinator. "If you don't have the
grades, there's nothing we can do."
Per NCAA regulations, the program is forbidden to discuss specific
academic standards. However. Assistant Athletic Director and Director
of Football Administration Mike Eubanks was able to give a broad def
inition of what it takes to be a Stanford student athlete.
"Everv kid who plays a sport here
goes through the same admissions
process that [regular students] do," he
said.
"Recruits need essays and recom
mendations," Anderson elaborated.
"Other schools just look at a tran
script, and you're in."

Indeed, by adhering to the same
admissions protocol that governs all
prospective Stanford students, coach
Jim Harbaugh's staff adds a whole
new dimension to the recruiting
process — the coaches must devote
around half of their time spent re
cruiting to reading transcripts and
calling guidance counselors, teachers
and principals.

"We have a lot more contact with
these types of administrators," An
derson said. "We spend more time
going through transcripts than going
through film.Transcripts are first, film
is second."
In the end, Stanford can only con
sider less than a tenth of the thou
sands of different prospects that
other programs can evaluate. And.
even after a list of academically qual
ified. Division I-caliber athletes has
been created (about 1(X) prospects a
year fit this criteria, according to Har-

baugh) it could still change. Recruits
are identified in their sophomore
year of high school, but if their grades
go down, they perform poorly on
standardized tests or if they don't
take difficult courses, then their
names can be removed from consid
eration.
"GPA puts you in the ball game,
and then we look at SATs and class

rigor," Harbaugh said. "Recruits gen
erally need two AP courses in their
senior year."
"You have got to take the right
classes," Anderson said.
If a recruit maintains his academic
standing throughout the process, then
he will be sent an application, but
even then admission is not guaran
teed. According to Eubanks. Dean of
Admission Richard Shaw reads every
application to see if the athletes are
on par with the rest of the student
body.
"Our only peers are Harvard. Yale
and Princeton," Eubanks said. "I be
lieve in that passionately."
Instead of treating such restric
tions as a burden, Harbaugh and his
staff flip it on its head, and make it
part of their pitch. They present what
Harbaugh called a "best of both
worlds" scenario, where the coaches
not only sell the recruits on the foot
ball program, but the scholastic side
of the University as well.
"We emphasize and stress aca
demics," Anderson said. "We also
stress the Pac-10 — this is right on
their minds."
"We're about winning Pac-10
championships and graduating our
players with Stanford degrees," Har
baugh added.
Many recruits know of Stanford's
academic prowess at the beginning of
the process, according to Harbaugh.
Those that want not only to play foot
ball, but to receive a stellar education
as well, may have an inherent lean to
ward Stanford.
"Some know, some you have to go
harder for." the second-year Stanford
coach said.
The pitch does not change, even
for recruits that are a bit harder to
land.
"You can go there.or you can go to
Stanford," Harbaugh said. "Stanford
will make you better for the next 40
years of your life, as opposed to just
the next four."
By stressing the scholastic side of
the University. Harbaugh and his staff
make academics their trump card. On
a purely football basis, Stanford,
which recruits from all over the na
tion, will compete with regional pow
ers throughout the country. A
prospect from New Jersey, for exam
ple. may have some reservations
about going to school thousands of
miles away from home when they can
play at an established East Coast pro
gram.
Academics then become key.
Being part of an up-and-coming foot
ball program is nice — and the coach
es do stress this — but Stanford is
hardly unique in that respect. Where
the University is unique is that it is the
top-ranked Division I school aca
demically. according to U.S. News and

World Report.This point becomes an
integral part of the sell.
"No Division I school can match
our academics" Anderson said.
Education and football, in the con
text of the Farm, are thus intrinsically
linked. Prospects won't be considered
without a strong scholastic back
ground. and Stanford may not be able
to land all of its recruits due to the
University's academic vigor.
But once athletes sign their letters
of intent with Stanford at the top,
players become part of both a proud
scholastic tradition and football tradi
tion.
"They can have it all," Anderson
said.

Freshman Chris Owusu is one of many athletes who has had to handle
Stanford's strict admission requirements. For football players and other
athletes alike, their natrual ability alone cannot get them into Stanford.
