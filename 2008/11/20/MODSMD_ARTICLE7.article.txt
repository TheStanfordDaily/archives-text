## Harbaugh signs to stay at Stanford 
### DENIS GRIFFIN MANAGING EDITOR 
After speculation in recent
weeks that Stanford football's Jim
Harbaugh could be in line to
replace Oakland Raiders irtterim
coach Tom Cable at the end of the
season, the second-year Cardinal
coach confirmed to reporters on
Wednesday that he would sign a
three-year contract extension after
the season. The deal, which would
extend Harbaugh's contract
through the 2014 season, is worth
more that $1.25 million per season,
according to ESPN, which cited an
anonymous source.
Harbaugh served as an assistant
coach with the Raiders in 2002-03
and reportedly still has a strong

relationship with Oakland's owner,
A 1 Davis. This made him a prime
candidate to replace Cable, who
replaced former lISC assistant
Lane Kiffin. after the season. The
contract extension, which is slated
to be formalized after the season
ends, will likely quell those rumors.
Harbaugh's initial contract with
Stanford was slated to expire in
2011 and was believed to be worth
around $5()(),()()() annually. The
extension helps alleviate concerns
that the coach could be moving on
to greener pastures after the season
— cutting short the rebuilding
process that he began just two years
ago.
"Another three years is what's
being talked about, that gets me to
six [years]," Harbaugh told The San
Francisco Chronicle, adding that his
goal is to get to 10 years with the
University.
Harbaugh wouldn't comment
much on the extension, saying his
focus was currently all devoted to
Saturday's Big Game.
"Right now it's Cal, Cal, Cal," he
told The San Jose Mercury News.
The extension does not necessar
ily ensure Harbaugh's continued
presence at the helm of the Cardinal
program, as college coaches routine
ly back out of deals in order to move
on to more lucrative or higher-pro
file positions. The move could, how
ever. indicate a shift in Stanford's
previous policy of paying coaches in
high-profile sports below market
value, as the deal will move Har
baugh's annual salary more in line
with the average for Pacific-10 Con
ference head football coaches.
Earlier this week, at the Big

Game press conference, Harbaugh
said he was "100 percent committed
to Stanford." After taking over for
Walt Harris following the 2006 sea
son in which the Cardinal went 1-11,
Harbaugh promptly led Stanford to
a 4-8 record in 2007 that included
wins over Cal and then-No. 2 USC in
Los Angeles.This season. Harbaugh
has brought the Cardinal to the
brink of its first bowl berth since
2001.
And with a core largely com
prised of underclassmen and a re
cruiting class that could be ranked as
high as the top 10 in the nation due
to come in this winter, the near fu
ture could be still brighter for the
Cardinal.
The lucrative extension for Har
baugh comes in the wake of last
year's reported $900,000 annual con
tract to new men's head basketball
coach Johnny Dawkins. Dawkins,
ironically, was signed after former
coach Trent Johnson left for LSU, re
portedly because he could not reach
an agreement on a contract exten
sion with Director of Athletics Bob
Bowlsby.
