## Harbaugh signs to stay at Stanford 
### DENIS GRIFFIN MANAGING EDITOR 
After speculation in recent
weeks that Stanford football's Jim
Harbaugh could be in line to
replace Oakland Raiders irtterim
coach Tom Cable at the end of the
season, the second-year Cardinal
coach confirmed to reporters on
Wednesday that he would sign a
three-year contract extension after
the season. The deal, which would
extend Harbaugh's contract
through the 2014 season, is worth
more that $1.25 million per season,
according to ESPN, which cited an
anonymous source.
Harbaugh served as an assistant
coach with the Raiders in 2002-03
and reportedly still has a strong

relationship with Oakland's owner,
A 1 Davis. This made him a prime
candidate to replace Cable, who
replaced former lISC assistant
Lane Kiffin. after the season. The
contract extension, which is slated
to be formalized after the season
ends, will likely quell those rumors.
Harbaugh's initial contract with
Stanford was slated to expire in
2011 and was believed to be worth
around $5()(),()()() annually. The
extension helps alleviate concerns
that the coach could be moving on
to greener pastures after the season
â€” cutting short the rebuilding
process that he began just two years
ago.
