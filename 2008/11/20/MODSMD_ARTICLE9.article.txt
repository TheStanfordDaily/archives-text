Showing up for class in a T-shirt and
sweats isn't just lazy — it can also be
a way to build community and a
form of self-expression.
With around 600 student groups on cam
pus, Stanford boasts a student population
with diverse interests. Students reflect this
passion for being involved in the community
even in the T-shirts they choose to wear. Ref
erences to music or dance groups, sports,
dorms or causes are among the many slogans
and logos on T-shirts that students are seen
wearing in their dorm rooms, to classes, at the
gym or just when hanging out.
Huven Tran' 12, a member of the Stanford
Taiko Team, thinks student group T-shirts
give students a sense of belonging, and en
hance their experience of being part of the
Stanford community in general.
"Wearing group T-shirts signifies that you
are a part of something integral; it gives you
a sense of pride in what you do. and it gives
you so many memories to look back on when
you've moved on," she said. "I'm always
going to remember the performances 1 wore
my 'Stanford Taiko' shirt to, and I would love
to go like/Hey, I wore that t-shirt to that per
formance 10 years ago' in the future."
With or without emotional significance

attached to group T-shirts, wearing them can
also be very serious.
Al-Karim Lalani '12, a member of the
Challenge Organizational Committee for
Gumball Capital, feels that group shirts give
students a sense of community.
"Wearing the Gumball Capital T-shirt
unites us in purpose," he said. "It's also a sort
of uniform for us that motivates us to work
harder. In general, I think group T-shirts re
mind you that you're a part of an organiza
tion — working as part of a team — and
that's very important for members of any stu
dent group to always remember."
Besides enriching the college experience
for students, T-shirts are also an important
means of self-expression. This is something
student group leaders often keep in mind
when designing their group T-shirt.
Mike Rodgers '08, co-facilitator of Side
bv-Side. a student community service group
that performs at various nursing homes in the
San Francisco Bay Area, thinks that T-shirts
should reflect the main activities of the
group.
"We have two logos on our T-shirt: on the
back is a sun with dancing figures in it, and on
the front is a row of stick figures holding
hands." he said."l think the sun and the danc
ing figures refer to a light-hearted, playful
and optimistic outlook on the world, and the
row of people holding hands speaks to the
importance of community. These ideas re
flect the attitude we try to bring to the nurs-

ing homes, where we
sing and dance in our
mission to connect
with, and spread joy to,
the elderly communi
ties in the area."
T-shirts may often
be worn to express a
cause or opinion. It is
common to see stu
dents donning shirts
designed to promote
a campaign.

Cris t in a
Munoz, a staff
member at the
Women's Com
munity Center

(WCC) is currently work-

ing on t-shirts that are going to be

part of a larger campaign the WCC is under
taking, called "The F Word".
"The shirts will say 'I'm not afraid to use
the F word' on the front,and 'FEMINIST ...
how about you?' on the back," Munoz said.
"The F word, or feminism, has been a contro
versial notion and word for decades. In the
past and today, feminism has also been
marred by definitively misogynist groups or
movements co-opting the label."
Through these T-shirts,'The F Word' cam
paign aims to make people at Stanford com
fortable with identifying with feminism, and
self-identifying as feminists. The WCC plans

to distribute the T-shirts to students for free
in hopes of seeing them worn in support of
the cause.
Some T-shirt designs also take on a differ
ent approach to reach out to the masses. The
Stanford Undergraduate Research Journal
(SURJ) gave out free T-shirts to students
during the beginning weeks of school.
"(Our shirts] are simplistic, yet have a
comedic approach to t-shirt design." said
Andy Ho '09, editor in chief of SU RJ.
The front of the T-shirt states: "If you're
pausing to read text this small then you
should submit to SURJ."
"We meant it to catch people's eyes and
force them to get up close to us to ask about
SURJ," Ho said.
Ho also thought group T-shirts were an
important way for students to express their
personalities.
"What we put on in the morning is a very
important, conscious choice we all make," he
said. "What we wear says a lot about who we
are."
Students certainly made this conscious
choice when they wore their Red Zone T-

shirts to the Saturday
game against USC. Christ

both young and old.juxtaposing a traditional
typeface with a modern transform. The de
sign celebrates and unites the richly diverse
Stanford students, student-athletes, alumni,
faculty, staff and community members that
cheer with joy and enthusiasm for Cardinal
victory."
And with Big Game right around the cor
ner. the idea that T-shirts can reflect group
pride, student motivation and a cause all at
once is particularly apparent. Because when
our shirts say "Come and get it," we mean it.

unites us in purpose," he said. "It's also a sort
of uniform for us that motivates us to work
harder. In general, I think group T-shirts re
mind you that you're a part of an organiza
tion — working as part of a team — and
that's very important for members of any stu
dent group to always remember."
Besides enriching the college experience
for students, T-shirts are also an important
means of self-expression. This is something
student group leaders often keep in mind
when designing their group T-shirt.
Mike Rodgers '08, co-facilitator of Side
bv-Side. a student community service group
that performs at various nursing homes in the
San Francisco Bay Area, thinks that T-shirts
should reflect the main activities of the
group.
"We have two logos on our T-shirt: on the
back is a sun with dancing figures in it, and on
the front is a row of stick figures holding
hands." he said."l think the sun and the danc
ing figures refer to a light-hearted, playful
and optimistic outlook on the world, and the
row of people holding hands speaks to the
importance of community. These ideas re
flect the attitude we try to bring to the nurs-

ing homes, where we
sing and dance in our
mission to connect
with, and spread joy to,
the elderly communi
ties in the area."
T-shirts may often
be worn to express a
cause or opinion. It is
common to see stu
dents donning shirts
designed to promote
a campaign.

Cris t in a
Munoz, a staff
member at the
Women's Com
munity Center

(WCC) is currently work-

ing on t-shirts that are going to be

part of a larger campaign the WCC is under
taking, called "The F Word".
"The shirts will say 'I'm not afraid to use
the F word' on the front,and 'FEMINIST ...
how about you?' on the back," Munoz said.
"The F word, or feminism, has been a contro
versial notion and word for decades. In the
past and today, feminism has also been
marred by definitively misogynist groups or
movements co-opting the label."
Through these T-shirts,'The F Word' cam
paign aims to make people at Stanford com
fortable with identifying with feminism, and
self-identifying as feminists. The WCC plans

to distribute the T-shirts to students for free
in hopes of seeing them worn in support of
the cause.
Some T-shirt designs also take on a differ
ent approach to reach out to the masses. The
Stanford Undergraduate Research Journal
(SURJ) gave out free T-shirts to students
during the beginning weeks of school.
"(Our shirts] are simplistic, yet have a
comedic approach to t-shirt design." said
Andy Ho '09, editor in chief of SU RJ.
The front of the T-shirt states: "If you're
pausing to read text this small then you
should submit to SURJ."
"We meant it to catch people's eyes and
force them to get up close to us to ask about
SURJ," Ho said.
Ho also thought group T-shirts were an
important way for students to express their
personalities.
"What we put on in the morning is a very
important, conscious choice we all make," he
said. "What we wear says a lot about who we
are."
Students certainly made this conscious
choice when they wore their Red Zone T-

shirts to the Saturday
game against USC. Christ
ian Tabing '09 — who also
serves as Web development

— ■ * — — 1
director for The Daily -
created the winning de
sign for the shirts.

"The Red Zone **
T-shirt design distills

o —
and refines the Cardinal spir

it into its purest and most classic

form," he said. "It speaks to an audience

both young and old.juxtaposing a traditional
typeface with a modern transform. The de
sign celebrates and unites the richly diverse
Stanford students, student-athletes, alumni,
faculty, staff and community members that
cheer with joy and enthusiasm for Cardinal
victory."
And with Big Game right around the cor
ner. the idea that T-shirts can reflect group
pride, student motivation and a cause all at
once is particularly apparent. Because when
our shirts say "Come and get it," we mean it.
