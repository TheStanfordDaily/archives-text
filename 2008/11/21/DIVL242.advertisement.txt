DEAR DR. PAUL,
It's Thanksgiving next Thursday, as you probably know. I
love everything about this holiday — the early morning Turkey
bowl, the time I spend with the family, stuffing and gravy and
especially my grandma's homemade sweet potatoes with marsh
mallows. The only thing is,
I think it must be the
beer and Late Nite. In any case, what's your advice? I don't dare
miss out on the pumpkin and pecan pies . . .
Dear Pumpkin Pounds,
In order to avoid gaining any weight, I suggest going on a strict diet of ice cubes and
celery, three days before and after your Thanksgiving dinner. Realistically, unless you plan on
eating for 20, one meal is not going to make or break your 15-pound weight gain. It's the left
overs that are going to make you pack on the pounds. Especially those pieces of pie that you
are determined to finish before you fly home. So do yourself a favor, and don't eat them.
Instead, go to the gym, or if you are lucky enough to live where it snows, go skiing. Freshman
year it was socially acceptable to gain 15 pounds, but now that you're a sophomore, it's
time to get back to your playing weight. So enjoy the turkey, gravy, mashed pota
toes, pies and wine, but remember that once the meal ends you
should probably run five miles. B
Got a burning question you can't ask anyone else? J
