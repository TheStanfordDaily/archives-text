# Cherry chapstick: Roxy kisses and tells
## 
### 
I kissed a girl. Or, rather, a girl kissed me.
When it happened, there was so much
champagne swirling around in this little
noggin of mine that all reflexes failed to

function properly. Instead, I thought to
myself, "Why not!?" and threw all inhibitions
to the wind. Afterwards, my hetero-con
science tapped me on the shoulder, hollering,
"But you're straight/" Oh ... yeah ... right.
But kissing a girl was so much fun! Dun
dun dun! (Enter Katy Perry's odious, angst
ridden pop hit for dramatic effect). She,
whoever she was, was a great kisser. Her face
wasn't covered in skin-scratching, sand- <
papery stubble. And she had on a killer pair
of heels... Well, she did! Aggressive male
libido was refreshingly absent, and in its

place was something new — something

feminine, soft, luscious; a delicious
treat in a sea of muscles and pick
up lines.
Don't get me wrong — I
adore men. I feed off of that
wonderfully alien hormone — i
testosterone. Men woo, ravage '
and protect me. They arc the yin

to my yang, the Bogey to my Baccall,
the pestle to my mortar . . . Kissing a mar
a marvelously dramatic experience — a

and then, I'd notice a hint of

knee-weakening fusion of masculine and
feminine.
Kissing a woman is an entirely different
enterprise. A strangely comforting intimacy
comes from locking lips with a member of
one's own sex. None of the explosive
dichotomies come into play. Instead, there's
an understanding of each other's bodies and
movements and a mutual appreciation of
female sensuality. And I'm just talking about
a kiss! No strings attached — just a little nib
ble, a taste. Yum yum!
When it was over, I fell back into the sea
of men, basking in our differences and the
thrill of being mysterious. A handsome fel
low managed to win me over and entertained
me for the rest of the evening. But every now

something sweet still lingering

on my lips, and the memory
of a naughty little kiss would
make me smile.
