WTiH
with actor Robert Pattinson
Once upon a time, two Stanford
girls had a fairy tale come true.
They were given the opportu
nity to sit down and chat with Robert
Pattinson, the star of sure-to-be block
buster "Twilight."
With a fairly short resume (which
includes the role of Cedric Diggory in
the "Harry Hotter" films), Pattinson is
making his star break as Edward
Cullen, the vampire Romeo of the
beloved, young adult "Twilight" series
of novels by Stephanie Meyer.
"Twilight" tells the tale of a teenage
girl, Bella Swan (Kristin Stewart), who
moves to rainy Washington and falls in
love with a teenage vampire, Edward
(Pattinson). These books are wildly
popular, with each in the series selling
millions of copies.
Because the books already have
such a huge fan base then, especially
among teenage girls, Pattinson was sure
to be a ready-made heartthrob, and he
hasn't disappointed. With sold-out
autograph signings, meet and greets
and near riots all around the globe,
intermission was lucky enough to get a
few words with him.
intermission (i): Did you read the
Twilight books before you auditioned
for the role of Edward?
Robert Pattinson (RP): Not before 1
auditioned. 1 did the audition, and I
like Kristen [Stewart] and Catherine
[Hardewicke, the director]. I read the
trilogy the weekend after my audition,
because I wanted the part, and I was
going to do what I needed to do.
[laughs]
i: Because the "Twilight" series has such
a huge following, did you find there
was a lot of pressure surrounding the
role of Edward?
RP: Not really ... when I went into it, I
had not heard of it. I was living in
England, and I hadn't heard anything
about it. I thought the role itself was
hard; the character breakdown was say
ing 'Edward is the perfect creature, blah
blah blah,' and that's quite tough. So I
put quite a bit of pressure on myself.
The fan thing was overwhelming once I

had already finished the movie, months
after ... If I had to shoot it now, it
would be absolutely terrifying.
i: The series is geared towards a
younger female demographic. What do
you think about guys that read and
enjoy "Twilight?"
RP: I got something from it. I thought
especially the second book ["New
Moon"] was really emotional, and I
didn't feel silly reading it. I just got
really sad reading the second one.
i: You are all over PerezHilton.com (a
prominent celebrity gossip blog) now.
How have you adjusted to all of this
instant fame and attention? Has it been
crazy?
RP: It's been crazy .. . Somebody sent
me an email about a signing I am doing
at the mall tonight, and there arc girls
there rioting, [laughs] It's completely
ridiculous! I don't know though. I've
been in this kind of "Twilight" bubble,
and everything I see is hotels and stuff.
Ever since I went to L.A. to do re
shoots, after I finished shooting in
Oregon, someone has come up to me
every single day and said "You're
Edward!" And if I go to a shopping
center or something, it's complete mad
ness.
i: There is a lot of action in this movie.
Did you do your own stunts?
RP: I tried to do my own stunts. I did

quite a lot of them in the beginning.
But they had hired a really good stunt
double, who is a professional, so I just
thought l I can do this and look lame, or
he can do it and nobody can tell it's not
me, and it will look cool.'
i: Do you believe in the love that
Twilight is famous for? The head-over
heels, I-can't-live-without-you kind of
love?
RP: I think ... I think you can get that
when you are a teenage girl. I don't
know ... I have never really felt like
that. I guess when people dump me, 1
always feel like that in hindsight,
[laughs]
i: What advice would you give for
aspiring actors?
RP: Don't back down too easily. Don't
act too desperate. As soon as you act
like you really, really want a job, you'll
never get it, and you'll look pathetic.
Just pretend that you don't. Get good
representation, that is probably the
most important.
"Twilight" is out in theatres nationwide
today.
