# Holiday concert puts eerie twist on poetry
## 
### 
Local composer Brian Holmes will premier his new
piece "Amherst Requiem," today at the Holiday
Concert in Memorial Church. The piece is a mixture of
the Latin mass for the dead and nine poems by Emily
Dickinson made for chorus. Dickinson's poems are spread
throughout seven movements that follow the progression of
the Latin requiem, as she explores her obsession with death
in relation to the Latin text.
The first movement of the piece is very chilling and aus
tere. It starts with a Dickinson poem about an inn that turns
out to be a graveyard. As the piece progresses to the requiem,
the chorus slowly rolls up and down the text, repeating each
line, reverberating with a plea for God to grant the dead eter
nal rest. The first movement ends with a children's chorus
singing "requiem aeternam," soothing the listener by offering
consoling support.
Next, the piece moves to a requiem that asks God to save
the dead from the torments of hell. It's opening tone is
lighter than the first movement, with the call "Domine lesu
Christe, Rex gloriae" — but the piece gets dark quickly as the
text discusses the torments of hell. 'lTic requiem is soon inter
rupted by Dickinson's poem "I heard a Fly buzz — when 1
died."
The most powerful movement of the piece is the fifth
movement, "Responsory." This movement includes the Day
of Judgment sequence of the mass for the dead, and is truly
haunting. The words of the Latin text resonate with shaking
heavens and earth, calamity, misery and fear. The chorus in
this section is loud and thunderous — accentuating every
syllable.
At first, the piece may not seem fitting for a holiday con
cert, with its messages of death, but Holmes looks to high
light a darker side of Christmas. In an interview with
Intermission, he pointed to the "pre-Christian celebration of
the winter solstice" and the words of the "Coventry Carol,"
which feature children slaying as evidence.
Also, despite the theme of death, many of the move
ments do have lighter sides. The children's chorus perform
ance is, according to Holmes, "uniformly consoling" and the
solo soprano offers a more joyful mood. Holmes is premier -
ing this piece at the holiday concert because of his high
regard for the groups who will be performing it.
Also on the program tonight is Leonard Bernstein's
"Chichester Psalms," which incorporates six psalms from the
Hebrew bible. Holmes said it is very similar to "Amherst
Requiem" and features moments of authoritative chorus
melodies. On the other hand, it has a very quirky air to it —
with shouting by the male chorus during particularly beauti
ful melodies. The third piece for the concert is Aaron
Copland's "Quiet City," a welcome change as it is very brassy
and instrumental.
Holmes has a profound understanding of the works of
Dickinson, and the merger of the requiem and her poems is
artfully done. For anyone who has never seen a choral con
cert in Memorial Church, the experience is overwhelming.
The acoustics are magnificent, and given the right chorus, the
halls and a»ches will reverberate the melodies gloriously. The
pieces might be too loud and powerful to accomplish the
magical acoustic effects of Memorial Church, but there is
definitely a potential for something great.
Performing tonight are the Stanford Symphonic Chorus,
Peninsula Symphony Orchestra and Vivace Youth Chorus of
San Jose, with Brian Holmes playing French horn in
"Amherst Requiem."Stanford Choral Director Stephen M.
Sano and Mitchell Sardou Klein will conduct the concert.
Tickets are $20 for adults and $ 10 for students, and the
shows will be at 8 p.m. tonight and 1:30 pm on Sunday.
