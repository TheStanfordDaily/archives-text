# Cal hatred
## commodified 
### 
The earliest expression of Stanford-Cal
rivalry emerged 100 years ago in the form of hand
made leather postcards. Hand-painted and stamped
into the leather were sayings of the same spirit as those on
our "Beat Cal" T-shirts: "Here's something to kick about!
Stanford 21, California 11." Students sent these postcards to
families back home in the spirit of the Big Game.

In more recent history, Cal hatred has been expressed in
more conventional and mass-produced ways. In the
19705, pin buttons became the newest fad and they fea
tured the then-mascot Stanford Indian. Buttons featuring
the Indian with the Axe, chasing a terrified Cal bear, or
sitting on an exhausted or sometimes even dead Cal bear
appeared. During the late '70s, while controversy over the
University's mascot grew, the pin buttons retained their
message. While some bore the Axe with the words "Beat
Cal" or the Tree engulfing a terrified bear, others showed a
Cardinal bird holding a stick with a hanging teddy.
In 1986, students on the Farm created "Beat Cal" hats.
The hats, boxy old-school baseball caps, read "Wienie
Roast" in capital letters next to "Cal," within a red circle
with a slash.
Though the Beat Cal hat has yet to make a comeback,
"Beat Cal" shirts have emerged as the most popular form
of rivalry expression in the past decade. In 1997, students
created a shirt that read (surprise) "Cal Sucks." The text
appeared below an illicit picture of a bear and a tree —

without going into too
much detail, the bear did
indeed "suck."
"I LOVE this shirt," said
Kory Jackson '96 on the
wall of a "Cal Sucks"
Facebook group. Though
the posted photo is of the

'97 shirt, Jackson said his is the same design, but from 1992.
"I still have it in the bottom of my drawer. Just couldn't
throw it away — though my wife has tried many times."
Other shirts over the past decade have preached various
hate Cal messages, ranging, from very vulgar to relatively
tame. Slogans have included "Friends don't let friends go to

Cal," "And on the Bth day, God created Cal, and he saw that it
sucked" or "Cal sucks... That's what she said."
While every year the Student Store sells its own
University-approved shirts, some students have capitalized
on the rivalry and used it as a launch pad for entrepreneurial
ventures.
Gavin Jenkins '08 created a shirt that read "We aren't
that different after all, we both got into Cal." Unmotivated by
Cal hatred, Jenkins' original plan was to sell the T-shirts for
profit. Unfortunately they didn't sell well.
"I still have a bunch of shirts lying around," he said.
In 2004, students in Donner, spearheaded by Sam
Fankuchen '08, created Cardinal shirts that read "Berkeley"
across the front. The backs of the shirts varied, carrying
punch lines such as "I'm sorry mom," "It's good for a public
school" and "Are you gonna smoke that?"
This year, Student Enterprises put a philanthropic twist
on newly revised "Beat Cal" shirts: five dollars of each
HIV/AIDS "Beat Cal" T-shirt sale was donated to fundraising
efforts in Africa.
"Three weeks ago, we were at a women's volleyball game
against Cal and they were partnered with a breast cancer
fundraising cause," said Bennett Hauser '10, general manager
of the Student Store. "And someone said, 'Beat Cal and
Breast Cancer!' And we thought it was such a great hook and
also a great way to support a cause."
"[The j primary purpose of the shirts is so that when we
go to Cal, we have school spirit," said Hauser, whose words
seemed to speak to all Cal-hate paraphernalia from over the
years. "If everyone has one of these shirts, we will most likely
win Big Game. It's science."
