# THEATRE REVIEW
## "Cal-fused" rails on Stanford, but all in the name of love 
### 
As predicted, Ram's Head's production of Gaieties is a
two-hour theatrical extravaganza of Cal-bashing, gra
tuitous nudity, sex jokes, student group mockery,
pelvic thrusts and jazz hands. Improbably and unexpectedly,
however, this year's show has actual theatrical merit. Due to a
solid and talented cast, excellent direction and a nuggetiof
sincerity hiding beneath the lovable and traditional sleaze,
"Dazed and CaJfused" transcends its role as a Big Game week
rally event to present an ultimately touching picture of why
we love our school.
This is not to imply that the usual nasties of Gaieties are
missing. The show indiscriminately bashes on Cal,
Harvard Law, France and women. When challenged by his
female friend, one male character zings, "At least 1 didn't need
a constitutional amendment to vote!" The writers admirably
fulfill their traditional duty of mocking student groups, and 1
was personally amused by the murder of a nosy Stanford
Daily reporter within the first three minutes of the show.
During a group LSD trip, no fewer than four fully nude
actors, one of whom is wearing a dinosaur mask, runs
through the scene. Every scene is rife with sexual misconduct
of every possible gender combination and fetish preference,
including some bizarre carrot/vegetable peeler role-play.
Gaieties is not high art; the script is always willing to aban
don logic to fit in a well-played sexual pun.
This year's Gaieties, however, has a few stellar compo
nents that pull the show out of its typical morass of sexual
confusion. Largely due to the script and junior Nick
DeWilde's direction, this show has greater focus and clarity

than previous years. Rather than filling up the stage with I
distracting gags, pulling focus from the actors and the
plot, DeWilde keeps the action centralized around the
main characters — ensemble members enter and exit for
their momentary roles, but each scene advances the plot
and the relationships between the characters.
Although the show has significant flaws, these are
largely technical. Wednesday night there were several
obvious glitches such as miscalled lighting cues and major
set failures. The sound was inconsistent, and I could rarely
hear the lyrics of the songs. Although their cameo appear
ances were charming and popular with the crowd, both
Dean Julie and President Hennessy forgot to hold for the
laughter of the crowd, so much of their amusing dialogue
was lost. A notable exception to the lackluster technical
elements was the excellent lighting design, a key element
in any spectacle musical.
The general fun and good feeling of Gaieties easily
smooths over these shortcomings, especially in the show's
rare moments of sincerity. In one moment, the male pro
tagonist Josh steps forward into a cheesy spotlight to sim
ply and earnestly argue that he has to save Stanford
because it is the first place he's ever wanted to call home.
The moment of honesty departs as quickly as the confidence
of a freshman in Chem. 35, but those seconds encapsulate
"Dazed and Calfused" and DeWilde's intent: Stanford is our
home, not just an institution that gives out degrees.

order to understand what they're saying, come dressed in full
rally gear or at least in a Stanford logo or three and sit with
your student group of choice so that you can all cheer when
the show ruthlessly attacks you. Enjoy, and beat Cal!
