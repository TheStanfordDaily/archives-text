# Cal sucks ARCHITECTURE
## 
### 
Few features of our hallowed school influence so much
of our pride and spirit in this university as the architec
ture and layout of our campus. With Big Game rivalry
spirit in mind, 1 set out to see how our campus stacks up
against Cal's in this important regard. Though our domi
nance on the athletic fields and in the classroom remains a
foregone conclusion, how might we rank against Cal in the
architectural arena? Which school has the better dormitories,
libraries, student center or overall aesthetic effect? With the
most unbiased attitude 1 could muster, I headed up to Cal to
see for myself, and objectively evaluated the campus and its
buildings. And I turned the same unbiased eye on our own
campus, to determine which of our buildings should be
praised, which should be lamented, and which should just be
torn down.
Before visiting the Berkeley campus, I spoke with the
interim director of Stanford's relatively young architecture
department, John Barton. Barton holds a unique position to
comment on the architectural merit of the two campuses —
he grew up on Stanford campus, earned a B.A. and a Masters
degree from Cal, and in addition to teaching architecture
back on the Farm, he formerly taught architecture as a mem
ber of our rival's faculty.
Barton remains fond of the Berkeley campus where he
has spent so much time. Still, he finds a great deal of merit in
the campus where he now teaches. When I asked him to
judge which institution has the better campus, Barton was
balanced and circumspect.
"Stanford and Cal arc hard to compare," he said. "It's a
bit like the old apples to oranges question."
"Stanford has a strong center that Cal lacks — Cal has
some formal buildings, but a less formal layout," he contin
ued. "The campus is defined by the creeks, full of park-like
settings like Faculty Glade — very different from Stanford
which is hard-paved and axial."
Indeed, Barton sees this distinction as one of the crucial
differences between the Stanford and Cal campuses, and their
resultant effects on the individual — Stanford's paved, built,
largely manmade environment versus Cal's grassier and more
natural setting.
The most beautiful campus of all
This quality is most explicitly seen in Stanford's Main
Quad, where the entire landscape surface is paved and all of
the plantings in the design, even the exotic plants and palm
trees that would seem to define the space, are elevated off of
the ground in concrete planters. Even the natural elements in
the plan are assumed into the manmade environment of

brick, stone and concretc. Barton, despite the conflict
between this aesthetic and the parkland of his alma mater,
said that "the Quad is wonderful."
The original Fredrick Law Olmstead plan defines the aes
thetic of the rest of the campus; from the unifying sandstone
and red tile material palette to the overwhelming predomi
nance of hardscape in campus public areas (Leland Stanford
had wanted a lawn in the center of the Quad — Olmstead
overrode him with his pavers and concrete planters). The
essential usefulness of the Quad, its compactness and func
tionality, make it a unique and successful architectural object
The Quad gathers together a huge variety of disciplines and
faculty under one roof, and explicitly represents the intellec
tual and spatial heart of the campus. Cal has no such unified
collected center, and the campus suffers for it. Score one, in
this column, for the Cardinal.
Hoover Tower is almost as defining a feature of this cam
pus as the Quad. It commands the campus, providing a con
tinual presence in the skyline. Its slightly squat proportions
and vaguely Art Deco style manage to maintain a coherence
and dialogue with the older Main Quad, by using the same
palette and tiling its crowning dome with the same red tiles.
While for some Hoover Tower stands alone in its detail,

intermission takes a critical look at how
Stanford's structures stack up against its rival's

impression and proportion to campus, Barton objects to the
structure, noting that "as a symbol, it is not in keeping with
the campus spirit, being that it represents a conservatism well
to the right of the University's approach."
Many of Stanford's newer buildings match the success of
its original scheme. Notably, the recent Y2E2 building near
the engineering quad effectively handles its interior space,
and its multiple atria deftly arrange the different functions
and objectives of the structure. Also, its impeccable environ
mental imprint and use of green building techniques pulls
Stanford ahead in the eco-friendly department.
Nearby, the David Packard Electrical Engineering
Building and the William Hewlett Teaching Center are excel
lent buildings by I.M. Pei, and classic examples of his aesthet
ic. Barton also pointed out a perhaps unnoticed gem of cam
pus architecture, Moonbeans coffee shop by Meyer Library.
"1 love Moonbeans — a little shelter, not trying to com
pete with anything, very modern," he said. "It has a tempo
rary/impermanent dialogue that works very well."
Moonbeans is an example of a new campus building
done right — though its corrugated aluminum walls and roof
and its glass windows would seem to clash both with the
1960s Meyer and the 1910s Green Library, its


pure functionality and striking juxtaposition set it apart and
allow it to simultaneously disappear and stand out.
Old Union — an excellent, if underused, example of
campus architecture — directly addresses the prevailing cam
pus style. Old Union's gables and mission towers echo the
presence of Hoover Tower in the middle skyline, a nod to a
prominent feature of the old campus. The building succeeds
because of its well-planned quadrangle, evocative arcades and
its intuitive interior/exterior relationship.
Pit falls of the Farm
Our campus isn't all roses and mission buildings under
sunny, blue skies, however. Tresidder Union is a boring and
confusing eyesore, and its interior is horribly compartmental
ized and labyrinthine. Likewise, the rear of Tresidder is a
jumbled and unfortunate junk pile, lacking any clear intu
itiveness or functionality. Across campus, the Gates
Computer Science Center, despite its fine Robert A.M. Stern
pedigree, disappears into blandness and uninventiveness. The
Law School is one of the ugliest buildings on campus. A sort
of Brutalist response to the established aesthetic of the Main
Quad, the Law School's similar arches and arcades, addressed
in poured and drilled concrete, create an uninviting (and
S X uninspiring) facade during the day and a dis-

tinctly ugly effect at night.
And then there's the
problem of Meyer Library.
Part hulking monolith, with
concrete grills minimizing the
windows and glass, part bas
tard child of Fascist architec
ture and the California
Mission style, part 1960s arti
fact and part obstacle, Meyer is
yet both protected and derided,
dear and hideous. Its coming
demolition is simultaneously
praised and mourned by a small
group of sympathizers.
Barton remembers the
library going up in the late '60s,
when he spent much of his time
on rampus with his father, a pro
fessor in the Law School.
"1 remember when it was
built, and I didn't like it then," he
said. "It has some interesting fea
tures inside, but really it's trying t
do some things Paul Rudolf had

done elsewhere, but less aggressively,
and therefore less successfully. Back

then, we used to call it the Undergraduate Library — UGLi
for short."
Meyer's shortcomings aren't only aesthetic — the
anachronism of its design is cute, in a way, and there are far
more objectionable buildings nearby. Barton sees the defect
as one of placement.
"The main problem with Meyer is its location — it's a
bad location," he said.
Indeed, Meyer takes up a huge area of airspace and sight
lines, and bulkily obstructs a pathway that would lead all the
way down Escondido Road and straight through to
Escondido Mall at the back of the Quad. This overwhelming
solidity and dominance makes Meyer objectionable, especial
ly when combined with its ugliness.
At the same time, that long avenue down the back of the
old campus might end up being equally oppressive, with so
much distance seen in one straight line. I might even say that
Meyer successfully, or at least happily, parcels off this enor
mous lihear space, and in morning sunlight it can create a
spectacular approach down Escondido. Barton also equivo
cated about Meyer.
"It brings up a central problem in campus planning —
it's only 40 years old," he said. "Maybe they made some bad
decisions, but at the same time you don't want a campus plan
that is so rigid that you can't adapt it to meet modern needs."
This adaptability has served our campus nicely — we
have a large, flat area in which to spread out and build, and
comfortably expand.
The other side: Cal
The problem with Cal's campus is its steep and difficult
site. Although in some parts of ihe campus this character cre
ates the shaded glens and hollows that Barton praised, in
other areas it ends up cutting off and isolating spaces into
useless and disconnected disappointments. Cal's campus is,




Cal Buildings - clockwise from left: the post-modern monstrosity aka the addition to the
Life Sciences Building; the poor man's Hoover Tower aka The Campanile, and the tasteful

in some ways, a series of amputated and
unrelated segments.
Barton sees the compartmentalization
differently.
"1 think each student discovers these

spaces over time,
and so the campus
unfolds very dif
ferently over a
long period of
time to each stu
dent," he said. "At
Stanford there is a
more singular
response."

One can see his point, though I would
rather live on an intuitive and immediate
campus than risk disorientation and discon
nection in favor of a more drawn-out journey.
The most obvious rival building is Cal's
own tower, the Campanile, and from halfway
up the sloping site it dominates the campus
in much the same way as our own. The
Campanile is much skinnier than Hoover
Tower, modeled on an Italian Gothic bell
tower, and for entirely different reasons is
really quite elegant. It works well with the
campus, especially on the approach up the
hill along the campus' main axis, where it
regally asserts itself over the other buildings.
The area that might be called the center
of the Berkeley campus, the oldest buildings
in the design by John Galen Howard,
includes a few beautiful buildings and main
tains a strong interrelation between its build
ings that other parts of the campus lack.
These are formal, Beaux Arts buildings, many
designed by architects Bernard Mayback and
Julia Morgan, of San Simeon fame. There is
California Hall, a solid and well-propor
tioned building of the highest quality, and

nearby, across a grassy amphitheatre, the
Valley Life Sciences Building, in a style lean
ing more towards Art Moderne.
Wonderful animal and stylized natural
motifs are carved in medallions on the

Library, a multi-decked, hulking, concrete
monster. Some of the planes of the balconies
are successful, but as a whole the building
clashes with its surroundings, horribly out of

facade, and cattle skulls and griffins flank the
Corinthian columns and faux-battlemented
entablature. The Valley building is covered in
wonderful Moderne ornamentation, almost
in a Secession-style aesthetic — leaf forms,
wave forms and flowering medallions
abound on the facade. It is taller, and larger
in scale, as many buildings are at Berkeley,
than here on Stanford's predominantly one
to three-storey campus.
Hilgard Hall is another Beaux Arts mas
terpiece, complete with pink sgraffito decora
tion, bull's head and cornucopia reliefs, and
medallions on rural themes. Cornucopias
and bowls of fruit overflow from the broken
pediment over the ornately grilled doorway.
Faux-Assyrian reliefs abutting the upper
entablature and Doric columns complete the
effect. Farther up the hill is University
Library, another quite successful, large Beaux
Arts building.
The bad of Berkeley
Unfortunately, the unity and clarity of
the buildings on this area of the campus are

place next to California Hall and the other
buildings around it, a Brutalist presence
asserting itself obnoxiously on the plaza.
Similarly, the Valley Life Sciences Building is
spoiled by the Life Sciences Addition, a jum
bled, weightless, ticky-tack postmodern mess
of flimsy square latticework and unorna
mented, undignified round columns worthy
of a corporate office park.
McCone Hall and Campbell Hall, near
by, are both strikingly unremarkable, the
same being true of Evans Hall, Le Conte, and
Tan Kah Kee. However, McLaughlin Hall and
its new addition O'Brien are fairly successful,
and the Chang Lin Tien Center for East
Asian Studies is an excellent, contemporary,
concrete and glass building with striking
bronze latticework over its glowing windows.
South Hall, a gorgeous 1873 brick building
with wonderful neo-Gothic and Victorian
detailing, looks a bit like the frightening
Victorian manor house on the hill we've all
wanted to live in.
True architectural character is found in
the incidental and additional buildings
tacked onto the original campus, and in how

"Back then, we used to call it the
Undergraduate Library—UGLi for short."

successfully they are thus integrated. No one
would dispute the grandeur and effectiveness
of the Main Quad or the Palm Drive
approach to Memorial Church, or the beauty
of Cal's Beaux Arts granite wedding cakes

and Campanile, but it
is in the relation of
buildings later added
to these powerful and
complete designs that
a campus earns or for
feits its architectural
worth.
In the end, com
paring the two cam-

puses is indeed like comparing apples to
oranges — one, an unavoidably flat campus
defined by a partial grid and a central quad,
paved and manmade; the other, a steep hill
side of glens, trees and creeks, with buildings
scattered throughout a natural setting.
Personally, 1 think that Stanford wins on
more counts than Cal, and provides a more
interesting and impressive architectural
effect. This is because, as Barton said,
"Stanford has done a better job setting some
guidelines for its buildings. There are very
few buildings here that look like they landed
from outer space. There's a few of those at
Berkeley."
Our campus is better integrated, and
therefore as a school and as a community we
are better propelled, driven by the good
architecture that surrounds us. Though we
have our fair share of ugly buildings, our
good buildings beat out Cal's good buildings,
and that's where things really count.
