# Cal sucks ARCHITECTURE
## 
### 
Few features of our hallowed school influence so much
of our pride and spirit in this university as the architec
ture and layout of our campus. With Big Game rivalry
spirit in mind, 1 set out to see how our campus stacks up
against Cal's in this important regard. Though our domi
nance on the athletic fields and in the classroom remains a
foregone conclusion, how might we rank against Cal in the
architectural arena? Which school has the better dormitories,
libraries, student center or overall aesthetic effect? With the
most unbiased attitude 1 could muster, I headed up to Cal to
see for myself, and objectively evaluated the campus and its
buildings. And I turned the same unbiased eye on our own
campus, to determine which of our buildings should be
praised, which should be lamented, and which should just be
torn down.
Before visiting the Berkeley campus, I spoke with the
interim director of Stanford's relatively young architecture
department, John Barton. Barton holds a unique position to
comment on the architectural merit of the two campuses —
he grew up on Stanford campus, earned a B.A. and a Masters
degree from Cal, and in addition to teaching architecture
back on the Farm, he formerly taught architecture as a mem
ber of our rival's faculty.
Barton remains fond of the Berkeley campus where he
has spent so much time. Still, he finds a great deal of merit in
the campus where he now teaches. When I asked him to
judge which institution has the better campus, Barton was
balanced and circumspect.
"Stanford and Cal arc hard to compare," he said. "It's a
bit like the old apples to oranges question."
"Stanford has a strong center that Cal lacks — Cal has
some formal buildings, but a less formal layout," he contin
ued. "The campus is defined by the creeks, full of park-like
settings like Faculty Glade — very different from Stanford
which is hard-paved and axial."
Indeed, Barton sees this distinction as one of the crucial
differences between the Stanford and Cal campuses, and their
resultant effects on the individual — Stanford's paved, built,
largely manmade environment versus Cal's grassier and more
natural setting.
The most beautiful campus of all
This quality is most explicitly seen in Stanford's Main
Quad, where the entire landscape surface is paved and all of
the plantings in the design, even the exotic plants and palm
trees that would seem to define the space, are elevated off of
the ground in concrete planters. Even the natural elements in
the plan are assumed into the manmade environment of

brick, stone and concretc. Barton, despite the conflict
between this aesthetic and the parkland of his alma mater,
said that "the Quad is wonderful."
The original Fredrick Law Olmstead plan defines the aes
thetic of the rest of the campus; from the unifying sandstone
and red tile material palette to the overwhelming predomi
nance of hardscape in campus public areas (Leland Stanford
had wanted a lawn in the center of the Quad — Olmstead
overrode him with his pavers and concrete planters). The
essential usefulness of the Quad, its compactness and func
tionality, make it a unique and successful architectural object
The Quad gathers together a huge variety of disciplines and
faculty under one roof, and explicitly represents the intellec
tual and spatial heart of the campus. Cal has no such unified
collected center, and the campus suffers for it. Score one, in
this column, for the Cardinal.
Hoover Tower is almost as defining a feature of this cam
pus as the Quad. It commands the campus, providing a con
tinual presence in the skyline. Its slightly squat proportions
and vaguely Art Deco style manage to maintain a coherence
and dialogue with the older Main Quad, by using the same
palette and tiling its crowning dome with the same red tiles.
While for some Hoover Tower stands alone in its detail,

intermission takes a critical look at how
Stanford's structures stack up against its rival's

impression and proportion to campus, Barton objects to the
structure, noting that "as a symbol, it is not in keeping with
the campus spirit, being that it represents a conservatism well
to the right of the University's approach."
Many of Stanford's newer buildings match the success of
its original scheme. Notably, the recent Y2E2 building near
the engineering quad effectively handles its interior space,
and its multiple atria deftly arrange the different functions
and objectives of the structure. Also, its impeccable environ
mental imprint and use of green building techniques pulls
Stanford ahead in the eco-friendly department.
Nearby, the David Packard Electrical Engineering
Building and the William Hewlett Teaching Center are excel
lent buildings by I.M. Pei, and classic examples of his aesthet
ic. Barton also pointed out a perhaps unnoticed gem of cam
pus architecture, Moonbeans coffee shop by Meyer Library.
"1 love Moonbeans — a little shelter, not trying to com
pete with anything, very modern," he said. "It has a tempo
rary/impermanent dialogue that works very well."
Moonbeans is an example of a new campus building
done right — though its corrugated aluminum walls and roof
and its glass windows would seem to clash both with the
1960s Meyer and the 1910s Green Library, its
