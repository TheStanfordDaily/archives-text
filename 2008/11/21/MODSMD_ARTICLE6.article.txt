# From the depths of Green: suggestions for Thanksgiving break
## 
### 
Without a doubt, the best part of
Web sites such as You Tube and
Amazon is the "related" feature;
the function that takes something you
already enjoy and recommends to you other
things that are similar, but not necessarily as
popular. Are you a "Lost" fan? Then you're
guaranteed to love "Cast Away!" The Web
site told you so. It's great.
Now, not only is the "related" feature
the key to procrastination, but it will espe
cially come in handy during Thanksgiving
break. After all, you've only got a week to
kick back and unlearn a full quarter's worth
of knowledge in time for finals, and you
want to make it count by exposing yourself
to as many fun new TV shows, movies and
books as possible. So don't do the pre
dictable thing and watch season two of "The
Office" yet again — instead, try some relat
ed items which are, of course, available at
Green Library.
If you like football, try ... "Friday Night
Lights"
Football is a Thanksgiving tradition
right up there with turkey and pretending
like the Pilgrims and Indians were best
friends. Yet are we really celebrating the true
spirit of football by watching a predictably

boring blowout that always seems to involve
the Detroit freaking Lions? No way. We like
our football raw, sexy and guaranteed to be
exciting. In short, what we want is fictional
football in the form of a show destined to
be underappreciated until it gets cancelled:
"Friday Night Lights."
"Friday Night Lights" is the story of a
Dillon, Texas high school football team and
the community that rises and falls with it.
Any given episode deals with an impressive
variety of issues ranging from race to reli
gion, from education to disability. Still,

somehow it hasn't caught on in a major
way, perhaps because these days it seems
that most Americans would rather use their
television time to deal with much simpler
topics like figuring out if they're smarter
than a fifth-grader.
Yet the refusal of "Friday Night Lights"
to become a niche locker-room drama is
what makes it truly great. Contained within
it is a show for everyone: a high school sex
capade, a politically charged class war, a bit
ing portrayal of small-town life (replete
with Applebees and meth labs) and, of
course, there are excellently produced foot
ball scenes that are very realistic, except for
the fact that they always seem to end on a
random, game-winning 50-yard touch
down.
But can't we all agree that football
would be better if every game ended with a
Hail Mary? Of course we can. The creators
of "FNL" know this, and that's why they've
created a show for the people. Now, if only
they could get some people to watch it.
"Friday Night Lights" is available on
DVD in the Green Library Media &
Microtext Center. The book and movie on
which it is based, which are also superb, can
be found in Green, too. In addition, every
episode of the show's first and second sea-

sons can be downloaded for free on
NBC.com.
If you like "The Office," try ... "Waiting for
Guffman"
The great thing about "The Office" is
that as wacky and irrational as its characters
and situations can get, its documentary
style format always lends the show the tinge
of realism it needs to connect with its audi
ence on a fundamental level. Yet as much as
the British and American "Office" have per
fected and popularized the "mockumen-

tary" style, they certainly did
not invent it.
That honor, most
would say, belongs
to Christopher
Guest, sort of the
Joseph Smith to '
Ricky Gervais'
Brigham Young, if you
will. You probably know
Guest from "Spinal Tap"
and "Best in Show," and
those movies are certainly
worth checking out. But
perhaps his mocknum
opus is the oft-ignored,
secretly hilarious 1996
movie, "Waiting for
Guffman."

"Guffman" tells the story of a
loving and loony community theater
in Blaine, Missouri as they put on a
show in honor of their town's 150 th
anniversary. Like the gang in "The Office,"
the characters in "Guffman" are composed
of just the right mix of normal people and
nutjobs, and at the center of it all is Corky
St. Clair, flamboyantly played by Guest him
self. Corky is one of those characters, like
the Godfather or Dr. Evil, that people still
do impressions of long after they've seen the
movie because he leaves such a mark. The
cast that surrounds him, which includes
Eugene Levy, Parker Posey and Fred Willard,
is equally charismatic and kooky.
Most impressively, all of the dialogue
for "Guffman" (as with all Guest movies) is
improvised. This, in addition to the mocku
mentary format, lends the movie its
bizarrely realistic flavor that keeps it as lov
able and watchable as the Scranton branch
of Dunder-Mifflin.
If you like "House," try ... The stories of
"Sherlock Holmes"
This recommendation might seem a lit
tle strange. After all, isn't Sherlock Holmes
much more famous a character than House?
Probably true, but the fact remains that
everybody has seen an episode of "House,"
whereas Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's "Sherlock
Holmes" novels are, much like "Tom
Sawyer" and the Bible, books that lots of
people think they've read, when in reality
they haven't.
Under the well-known Deerstalker cap
and behind the awesome mustache lies a
collection of quirky, intellectually stimulat
ing stories that appeal to the deductive logi
cian in all of us the same way that "House"
does. In fact, the character of House was
based very closely on Holmes, from his
name to his brilliant-but-rude nature to his

drug addiction (vicodin instead of cocaine).
Both characters even have a best friend who
is pretty normal, except for inexplicable
problems with women! Above all, like
House, Sherlock Holmes is a total cerebral
badass, and trying to figure out the solution
to cases such as "The Red-Headed League"
before he does is a severely difficult chal
lenge, even for the sharpest of Rubik's
Cube-solvers.
All of Holmes' adventures lay hidden
somewhere in the depths of the Green
Library stacks, and for the Stanfordite
shrewd enough to be able to figure out
where, fantastic rewards await.
If you like watching old movies on TCM
and AMC, try ... The Stanford Theatre
All right, so classic films on the big
screen and a bitchin' organ can't be found at
Green, but the Stanford Theatre on
University Avenue is too cool and too often
overlooked not to be mentioned in this
space. If you can't be with your family to eat
mashed potatoes this Thanksgiving, then
why not eat popcorn with Humphrey
Bogart? Plus, guys, even if you are a com
pletely creepy or lame person, you will still
seem like a total gentleman for taking a girl
to a black-and-white movie. lust something
to consider while you fire up that "300"
DVD for the 300 th time.

"Friday Night Lights" is available on
DVD in the Green Library Media &
Microtext Center. The book and movie on
which it is based, which are also superb, can
be found in Green, too. In addition, every
episode of the show's first and second sea-

sons can be downloaded for free on
NBC.com.
If you like "The Office," try ... "Waiting for
Guffman"
The great thing about "The Office" is
that as wacky and irrational as its characters
and situations can get, its documentary
style format always lends the show the tinge
of realism it needs to connect with its audi
ence on a fundamental level. Yet as much as
the British and American "Office" have per
fected and popularized the "mockumen-

tary" style, they certainly did
not invent it.
That honor, most
would say, belongs
to Christopher
Guest, sort of the
Joseph Smith to '
Ricky Gervais'
Brigham Young, if you
will. You probably know
Guest from "Spinal Tap"
and "Best in Show," and
those movies are certainly
worth checking out. But
perhaps his mocknum
opus is the oft-ignored,
secretly hilarious 1996
movie, "Waiting for
Guffman."

"Guffman" tells the story of a
loving and loony community theater
in Blaine, Missouri as they put on a
show in honor of their town's 150 th
anniversary. Like the gang in "The Office,"
the characters in "Guffman" are composed
of just the right mix of normal people and
nutjobs, and at the center of it all is Corky
St. Clair, flamboyantly played by Guest him
self. Corky is one of those characters, like
the Godfather or Dr. Evil, that people still
do impressions of long after they've seen the
movie because he leaves such a mark. The
cast that surrounds him, which includes
Eugene Levy, Parker Posey and Fred Willard,
is equally charismatic and kooky.
Most impressively, all of the dialogue
for "Guffman" (as with all Guest movies) is
improvised. This, in addition to the mocku
mentary format, lends the movie its
bizarrely realistic flavor that keeps it as lov
able and watchable as the Scranton branch
of Dunder-Mifflin.
If you like "House," try ... The stories of
"Sherlock Holmes"
This recommendation might seem a lit
tle strange. After all, isn't Sherlock Holmes
much more famous a character than House?
Probably true, but the fact remains that
everybody has seen an episode of "House,"
whereas Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's "Sherlock
Holmes" novels are, much like "Tom
Sawyer" and the Bible, books that lots of
people think they've read, when in reality
they haven't.
Under the well-known Deerstalker cap
and behind the awesome mustache lies a
collection of quirky, intellectually stimulat
ing stories that appeal to the deductive logi
cian in all of us the same way that "House"
does. In fact, the character of House was
based very closely on Holmes, from his
name to his brilliant-but-rude nature to his

drug addiction (vicodin instead of cocaine).
Both characters even have a best friend who
is pretty normal, except for inexplicable
problems with women! Above all, like
House, Sherlock Holmes is a total cerebral
badass, and trying to figure out the solution
to cases such as "The Red-Headed League"
before he does is a severely difficult chal
lenge, even for the sharpest of Rubik's
Cube-solvers.
All of Holmes' adventures lay hidden
somewhere in the depths of the Green
Library stacks, and for the Stanfordite
shrewd enough to be able to figure out
where, fantastic rewards await.
If you like watching old movies on TCM
and AMC, try ... The Stanford Theatre
All right, so classic films on the big
screen and a bitchin' organ can't be found at
Green, but the Stanford Theatre on
University Avenue is too cool and too often
overlooked not to be mentioned in this
space. If you can't be with your family to eat
mashed potatoes this Thanksgiving, then
why not eat popcorn with Humphrey
Bogart? Plus, guys, even if you are a com
pletely creepy or lame person, you will still
seem like a total gentleman for taking a girl
to a black-and-white movie. lust something
to consider while you fire up that "300"
DVD for the 300 th time.

Without a doubt, the best part of
Web sites such as You Tube and
Amazon is the "related" feature;
the function that takes something you
already enjoy and recommends to you other
things that are similar, but not necessarily as
popular. Are you a "Lost" fan? Then you're
guaranteed to love "Cast Away!" The Web
site told you so. It's great.
Now, not only is the "related" feature
the key to procrastination, but it will espe
cially come in handy during Thanksgiving
break. After all, you've only got a week to
kick back and unlearn a full quarter's worth
of knowledge in time for finals, and you
want to make it count by exposing yourself
to as many fun new TV shows, movies and
books as possible. So don't do the pre
dictable thing and watch season two of "The
Office" yet again — instead, try some relat
ed items which are, of course, available at
Green Library.
If you like football, try ... "Friday Night
Lights"
Football is a Thanksgiving tradition
right up there with turkey and pretending
like the Pilgrims and Indians were best
friends. Yet are we really celebrating the true
spirit of football by watching a predictably

boring blowout that always seems to involve
the Detroit freaking Lions? No way. We like
our football raw, sexy and guaranteed to be
exciting. In short, what we want is fictional
football in the form of a show destined to
be underappreciated until it gets cancelled:
"Friday Night Lights."
"Friday Night Lights" is the story of a
Dillon, Texas high school football team and
the community that rises and falls with it.
Any given episode deals with an impressive
variety of issues ranging from race to reli
gion, from education to disability. Still,

somehow it hasn't caught on in a major
way, perhaps because these days it seems
that most Americans would rather use their
television time to deal with much simpler
topics like figuring out if they're smarter
than a fifth-grader.
Yet the refusal of "Friday Night Lights"
to become a niche locker-room drama is
what makes it truly great. Contained within
it is a show for everyone: a high school sex
capade, a politically charged class war, a bit
ing portrayal of small-town life (replete
with Applebees and meth labs) and, of
course, there are excellently produced foot
ball scenes that are very realistic, except for
the fact that they always seem to end on a
random, game-winning 50-yard touch
down.
But can't we all agree that football
would be better if every game ended with a
Hail Mary? Of course we can. The creators
of "FNL" know this, and that's why they've
created a show for the people. Now, if only
they could get some people to watch it.
"Friday Night Lights" is available on
DVD in the Green Library Media &

which it is based, which are also superb, can
be found in Green, too. In addition, every
