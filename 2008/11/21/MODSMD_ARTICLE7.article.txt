# THEATRE REVIEW
## Sketch comedy hits the sweet spot 
### 
Fresh out of the cradle and finally stretching their tod
dler toes, Robber Barons Sketch Comedy (RBSC), one
of the newest groups on campus, just might be the
hottest thing to hit Stanford since Oprah Winfrey. Hilarious
and entertaining, their third show, "The Robber Barons: IN
HIGH-DEF!" is something you should be sorry you missed, if
you did, as the group had their one and only performance
last night in Campbell Recital Hall. Forget Gaieties or a cap
pclla group skits; if you're really looking for a hilarious and
entertaining sex-infused evening, the Robber Barons can cer
tainly keep it up — for an hour and a half, even. Now that's
what I call comedy!
The brain child of Brandon Silberstein '08, RBSC
TV PREVIEW

stemmed from his sophomoric desire to
see such a group established and his
chutzpa to make it happen through work
ing with grad student Dan Klein (founder
of the beloved improv group, SIMPS) to
create Drama 104: Intro to Sketch
Comedy. The course was offered for the
first time last winter quarter and upon
completion, members of the class were
coerced by Silberstein's Jewish charm to
stay on and form an official student
organization. The group was originally
dubbed Aaah! Sketch Comedy in attempt
to gain recognition by showing up as first
in all lists of organizations, but changed
its name to the Robber Barons upon its
first collaborated production outside of
class last spring.
During production, everyone in

the group writes sketches, everyone edits
together and the head writer and director have the final say.
The script for the "HIGH-DEF" show was more or less final
ized about two weeks ago, with some changes taking place as
inspiration occurred. The entire show is very collaborative,
with writers of all styles, "from absurd to vulgar, parody to
personality-driven," coming together, sharing ideas and learn
ing from one another.
"I've actually seen myself less as a person who writes all
the sketches and more as someone who supports everyone
else in developing their own," said Head Writer Kevin Webb
'09, who is also a Daily columnist. "My job was to make all of
our group's sketches funnier, without letting them lose their
unique comedic flavors."

Robber Barons keep it up (the comedy that is)
in their third show of the year

Speaking of flavor, the show is marinated in deliciously
disgusting and tantalizingly tear-jerking punch lines that will
leave you hyperventilating and cringing, even, probably like
those puns 1 just threw at you. The witty dialogue and physi
cal comedy makes the audience uncomfortable in all the right
ways. With the thematic elements of pornography, penis
humor, butt sex and object confusion binding the show
together, each skit adds new meaning to the phrase, "Lick my
balls." Maybe. 1 particularly enjoyed the group's use of gender
role reversals and racial stereotyping to bring out the humor
in everyday occurrences at Stanford.
The dance of the "fine woman of color" was probably my
favorite, and with good reason, as Olivia Harewood '09
played the role perfectly, dawning an unflinching smile and
badass dance moves that even Seinfeld's Elaine couldn't top.
Harewood, an actor in the show as well as director, has been
seen in many productions across campus and is always
remembered for her sass and comedic timing. But she is cer
tainly not alone in bringing laughter to the audience; the
entire cast offers a great range of stylistic humor and physical
comedy. Silberstein and fellow producer Cameron Poter '11,
as well as the rest of the group, grace the audience with their
on-point facial expressions and full-bodied vocal quality that
enhance each scene.
After you're done hitting yourself in the face for missing
the show, or pleasuring yourself appropriately for being
smart enough to attend, visit the RSBC website at www.rob
berbaronscomedy.com for more information, amusing videos
and sexual healing. Enjoy!
