# "24: RRDEMPTION." PUN INTENDED

### 
As any fan will tell you, "24:
Redemption" is an ironic title for the
prequel to the hit Fox show's seventh
season. After five seasons of catching the eyes
and destructive, dramatic imaginations of
people around the nation — and inspiring a

Chuck Norris rivalry — Jack Bauer and Co.
took a turn into the downright ridiculous
and melodramatic in season six.
For a show that always has a nut-job
politician, a sex scandal, a presidential con
spiracy and an imminent terrorist attack in
the plot line — and still has a large, dedicat
ed audience — it's quite an accomplishment
to alienate a fair share of your viewers by
becoming too preposterous. It was as if the
showrunners were trying too hard in season
six, and rather than elevating the material
above the stereotypic dreck it's been some
what fairly accused of, plowed "24" head
first into every possible combination of
melodrama and ass-kicking.
Enter "24: Redemption." Or maybe "24:
Do-over." Or "24: Please forget last season."
Any way you put it, this two-hour prequel,
which still utilizes the real-time format, has
quite a bit weighing on it: Fox execs looking
to stabilize a franchise; writers and actors
looking to get back into the running for
awards; TV viewers wondering if a full week
of Jack Bauer is time poorly spent; and a six
season history of character threads, plot
twists, betrayals and poor plotting decisions

that are now difficult to handle.
Enough of the drama, though. If any
thing, "24" in its current state is far from
being a disaster on the proportions of its
main conflicts. And that's exactly why it's
easy to get comfortable again in the "24"
world featured in "Redemption." While the
action may be far from the usual Los Angeles
city and suburbs, the prequel takes "24" back
to basics: a damaged hero, people in need,
crazy bad guys and government intrigue.
At the start of the movie, we find for
mer-Counter Terrorist Unit Agent Bauer
(Kiefer Sutherland) in Sangala, Gabon, on
the run from U.S. prosecution over his use of
torture (to save the nation) in season six.
He's trying to keep a low profile by helping a
friend, Carl Benton (Robert Carlyle), take
care of a group of young boys who would
otherwise be easy prey for Colonel Juma
(Tony Todd), a militant revolutionary look
ing for child soldiers.
Of course, trouble finds lack Bauer —
both in a U.S. official who issues lack a sub
poena and luma (surprise!) pursuing the
children for his attack on the government,
which happens to be ... well, right now. In
