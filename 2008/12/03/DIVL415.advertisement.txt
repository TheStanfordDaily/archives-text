DEAR DR. PAUL,
As you have probably heard, it's Dead Week on Stanford
campus, which means papers, projects and studying for
finals next week. I have a butt-load of stuff to do, and
am thinking about pulling a few all-nighters.
that will help me focus and keep me up?
Dear Future Addict,
In my experience, drugs are always the answer. In order for you to stay up all
night, you'll be wanting to get your hands on some stimulants, aka uppers. We'll
start with some basics.
Caffeine: found in coffee, green tea and energy drinks. A typical cup of coffee
has about 80-120 mg of caffeine, which should probably keep you running for a few
of those late-night hours, as long as you consume consistently.
Cocaine: used commonly by folks in the finance industry to stay up late and
create sub-prime mortgage packages. It will definitely keep you running all night
long, but don't be surprised if it makes you feel like you should go clubbing rather
than read another chapter out of your Math 51 book.
Adderall: score some from your friends that have ADHL). It does the same thing
as cocaine but since real doctors prescribe it, it isn't bad for you.
If you aren't willing to do what it takes and fill your
body with drugs, there is another option. My friend ■
T.J. likes to do push-ups to keep himself awake. Not 112
only does this technique give you ripped pecs, but it / , \

morning. Whatever you decide to do, remember 1 I W I 1-3

Got a burning question you can't ask anyone else?
