# Winter break movie fest from Fido to Hitler, films to watch (or not) this holiday
## 
### 
For us Stanford students who are also movie enthusi
asts, winter break is an extraordinarily important time.
Blessed with free time and proximity to movie theaters
for once, we can use our break to take advantage of every
holiday offering, from Oscar contenders to the awful-but
still-watchable movies that pretend to be Oscar contenders.
It really is the most wonderful time of the year.
"Doubt"
This screen adaptation of John Patrick Shanley's hugely
successful Broadway play about confusion and Catholicism
seems poised to mess with the minds of critics and audiences
alike. The story is gripping and the cast is loaded. Meryl
Streep stars as Sister Aloysius, a strict Catholic school nun
who becomes determined to excommunicate a popular priest
named Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) from the
school when she is told by a young teacher (Amy Adams)
that he may or may not have done inappropriate things with
a young black student, the school's first. There is absolutely
no proof to back up these claims — just tons of, well, doubt.
The biggest risk Shanley takes in transporting "Doubt"
from stage to big screen is the chance that his story might
lose its profound uncertainty. In the play, the conflict
between Aloysius and Flynn is treated in a very particular,
even-handed way — it is often said that the show's true "sec
ond act" was the hours people spent after seeing the play
debating what actually happened and which characters' side
they took.
In the movie's trailer, however, Streep's Aloysius comes

across as ruthlessly evil (definitely more "Devil Wears Prada"
in her character than "Mamma Mia" this time around), and
for this film to be successful and Oscar-worthy, it is impera
tive that Shanlcy the writer-director instill his movie with
lots of his title.
Best-case Scenario: The most potent mind-messing-up
movie since "Memento."
Worst-case Scenario: Two hours of Catholic school.
Oscar Potential: Best Picture, Shanley for Director,
Hoffman for Actor, Streep for Actress, Adams for Actress,
Viola Davis for Supporting Actress
Fun Fact: Natalie Portman was up for Amy Adams' role but
dropped out of consideration because she claimed she
couldn't understand someone choosing to be celibate.
Someone needs to teach Natalie about "acting."
"Valkyrie"
It would be easy to dismiss "Valkyrie" as just another
World War II movie (and there seem to be an unusually high
amount coming up), but here's what separates this one from
the rest: eye patch-wearing Tom Cruise vs. Hitler. Just think
about it for a while.
As the Indiana Jones movies prove, Nazis make the best
movie villains ever, and they should be well-utilized in this
true story of a German-led plot to assassinate Hitler.
However, while the movie is based on true events, what
should make it truly spectacular is that it doesn't seem like it
will stay true to history at all. After all, as seen in the trailer,

in playing Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, Cruise doesn't
even attempt any semblance of a German accent — he's just
doing the same brash, cocky Tom Cruise character he does in
all of his awesome movies, from "Cocktail" to "Top Gun" to
"A Few Good Men." So no one's expecting Oscars, but as a
purely badass thriller, "Valkyrie" is obviously in very capable
hands because it is helmed by "The Usual Suspects" director
Bryan Singer. While this movie probably won't amount to
much more than eye patch-wearing Tom Cruise vs. Hitler,
isn't that really all we want for Christmas?
Best-case Scenario: Another gleaming gem in the Cruise
canon.
Worst-case Scenario: Cruise is so ridiculous that Hitler
seems sympathetic by comparison.
Oscar Potential: Not really.
Fun Fact: Cruise chose the project because he felt that he
bore a striking resemblance to Stauffenberg.
"Marley & Me"
The main obstacle for "Marley & Me" to overcome is
that to become successful it must be more interesting than
the tabloid-y stories that surrounded its filming, stories
which included the budding romance of stars Jennifer
Aniston and Owen Wilson, as well as Wilson's shocking sui
cide attempt.
However, it seems virtually impossible that "Marley" —
the story of a naughty-but-lovable Labrador retriever that
brings a couple together — will be nearly as compelling as
the Us Weekly articles written about it. You can tell a lot
about the quality of a movie by the originality of its trailer,
and the previews for "Marley" are as generic as can be, fea
turing songs like "Chariots of Fire," the theme from"The
Good, the Bad and the Ugly" and perhaps most egregious of
all, "Bad to the Bone" — a song that hasn't been listened to
outside the context of a movie for probably 20 years. What's
most surprising is that the trailer didn't end with a narrator
saying, "No dogs were harmed in the making of this pic
ture."
When it comes right down to it, are people really going
to want to watch a movie completely about something no
one likes to do — training dogs? Everyone loves dogs, but
everyone hates dog doo, and it seems unreasonable to believe
that pooper-scooping will become interesting just because
Jennifer Aniston is the one doing it.
Best-case Scenario: The kind of inspiring movie that will
make the critics say cheesy things like,"Get up, stand up,
'Marley!'"
Worst-case Scenario: An insufferably annoying tearjerker
that proves once and for all that Jennifer Aniston is boring
and that Owen Wilson has lost his touch.
Oscar Potential: Pshaw.
Fuii Fact: Dave Barry is an extra. Whether or not this is a
"fun" fact is certainly debatable.
