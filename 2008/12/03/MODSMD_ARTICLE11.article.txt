## "Boogie Man" looks back on the life of musician-politician Lee Atwater 
### 
Lee Atwater, the infamous Republican strategist
who once called George W. Bush his "No. 1 soul
mate," died in 1991 under freakishly dramatic
circumstances that make his life seem, in retrospect,
rather more like fiction than reality. In the throes of a
high-power career marked by blind ambition and
ruthless tactics, Atwater was suddenly struck down at
age 40 by a fatal brain tumor that first made its symp-

e» / *
toms known during a brunch for Phil Gramm. Punishment
for Atwater's sins? Proof of the existence of God?
Though one might be tempted to joke (timidly) about
the semi-villainous Atwater's proportionately bitter demise,
it's impossible to watch director Stefan Forbes' engrossing
new documentary, "Boogie Man, without developing some
cautious compassion for Atwater, whose insecurities, ambi
tion and fervid guitar-playing all seem deeply human, and
inevitably sympathetic. But that's not to say that the docu
mentary pleads Atwater's case — impressively, the film
remainsJargely judgment-free, calmly splicing together pho
tos, primary footage and interviews.
Forbes' informative interviewees speak from a satisfying

variety of perspectives; Michael Dukakis, Mary
Matalin, Howard Fineman, Atwater's friends and
enemies recount anecdotes and opinions that
inform us equally about the man himself and
about the compulsive fascination surrounding
him. When these interviewees speak on a com-

Story
NOT RATED
Documentary
A conservative politician and
accomplished guitarist dies from a

mon subject, they so often
contradict each other (both in
statements of opinion and
fact) that it becomes increas
ingly futile to try to under
stand Lee Atwater. Instead,
we're left to marvel and gape
at the ample material with
which Forbes provides us.
Documentaries about
dead men are, understandably,
difficult to pull off. Unlike
biographical docs in which the
subjects are available for rivet-

ing interviews (think Robert McNamara in "The Fog of War"
or Bob Dylan in "No Direction Home"), "Boogie Man" has to
flesh out the Atwater narrative without the benefit of being
able to grill the man in person. But Atwater's life, perplexing
as it was, is no less fascinating for being told in the third per
son. If anything, Atwater's conspicuous absence heightens the
onscreen tension, reminding us constantly of how the whole
whirlwind story ended.
Although Atwater is best known for his energetic career
in the Republican party, "Boogie Man" contains a smattering
of details about Atwater's childhood and domestic life, nei
ther of which seem particularly happy. Born in Atlanta in
1951, Atwater had a younger brother who was scalded to

death at the age of three. Atwater later married and moved
eventually to D.C., where he worked in both the Reagan and
George H.W. Bush administrations, spending huge chunks of
time away from his family. The film sadly offers little insight
into Atwater's non-political life, though there is footage of the
family and kids at home.
Distracted and twitchy is what Atwater so often seems to
be in "Boogie Man" — distracted and twitchy with his family,
on the treadmill, even at press conferences with his soulmate
Dubya. As Newsweek's Howard Fincman aptly describes him,
he "had a vaguely marsupial look about him, always sniffing
the air." And while Atwater was so often a terrifying, marsupi
al boogie man in the political arena, he was also occasionally
a boogie man in the strictly musical sense — a talented singer
and guitarist who performed with manic energy at George H.
W. Bush's inaugural ball (Forbes incorporates riveting clips of
Atwater's frenzied performances). Contradictions abound.
Forbes's thorough coverage and well-paced interviews
build, ultimately, to a haunting conclusion; we see photos and
footage of Atwater, battling with cancer and chcmo, bloated
beyond recognition. Stories of Atwater's deathbed conversion
and humble apologies are told, although even the sincerity of
this sudden reform is speckled with doubt. As "Boogie Man"
so competently illustrates, it seems impossible that we'll ever
know (or that anyone ever knew) Atwater to any satisfying
degree. To the end, he remains an inscrutable specimen.
