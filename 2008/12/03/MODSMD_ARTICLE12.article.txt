## "Australia": Baz Luhrmann's attempt at an epic 
### 
Baz Luhrmann's "Australia,'*his first movie since 200 l's
"Moulin Rouge," promises to be a sweeping film in the
old Hollywood style: an ambitious epic that crams

adventure, war, romance, westerns and social com
mentary into two hours and 45 minutes (yet

feels more like four and a half hours).
Sounds great. But does "Australia" deliver
on its lofty aspirations or crumble under its
grandiose undertaking?
The sweeping story unravels in the
Great Southern Land of Australia (or the
"Land of Oz" as is alluded throughout the
film by Judy Garland's "Somewhere Over
the Rainbow"), on the verge of World War
11. An English aristocrat (Nicole Kidman),

though poorly suited for the region's rough edges, loosens her
corset laces to save her inherited cattle ranch from the greedy
fist of a monopolist with the help of a reluctant Australian
cowboy (Hugh Jackman). Along with some trusty and eccen
tric sidekicks, they risk their lives to take 2,000 heads of cattle
across the beautiful, yet unforgiving, terrain.
Visually, the film matches its epic aspirations. The movie
captures the magnificence of the Australian landscape and
lets the audience appreciate the beauty of the Land Down
Under. It is stunning from beginning to end: both at quiet
moments when the camera takes in the breathtaking land
scape or when it moves swiftly among a CGI stampede that
dares the audience not to be thrilled. This lavish style is
Luhrmann's expertise and here it conveys the magic of the
director's beloved land.
Kidman, however, is mediocre as Lady Sarah Ashley. She
tends to overdo her expressions as the uptight aristocrat,

the vital stats. , V

Drama
An English aristocrat takes 2000
cattle across the Australian outback. J

though she is much easier to watch after
Sarah lets her guard down. Jackman, as

Drover, does a good job with what he is given, which isn't
much. He is presented as a rugged outsider (for being friend
ly to the Aboriginals), but ultimately his character is thinly
developed and feels like an excuse to create some romantic
tension in the narrative. The real star in the movie is new
comer Brandon Walters who plays the half-caste orphan
Nullah and manages to convey more emotion and sincerity
than his A-list counterparts.
It is in its plotline where "Australia" becomes less than
magical. The movie tries to incorporate too many stories and
themes into its running time and thus feels bloated and
exhausting. It hammers the audience over the head with its
epic undertones. Unfortunately, this also reminds moviegoers
that "Australia" is an aspiring epic that never quite reaches
what it set out to achieve.
The movie draws from cultural influences like "Gone
With the Wind" and "Lonesome Dove" and thus loses the

originality that characterized Luhrmann's previous work. The
love story in "Australia" is more than predictable and gets in
the way of a much more interesting storyline regarding the
Stolen Generations (Australian Aboriginal children removed
from their families by the government) and the racial ten
sions that existed in Australia during the 19405. The movie's
banal narrative would not be problematic if the journey was
entertaining from beginning to end. However, after the first
act, the story meanders and just seems to be trying to fill the
prerequisite "epic" time commitment.
Much like the scene where Nicole Kidman attempts, but
fails, to correctly sing "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" to a
distressed Nullah, "Australia" attempts to be a magical movie,
but ultimately fails to make the leap over the rainbow.
