## "Slumdog" a window to India Boyle stacks this fantastic tale with colorful scenery and characters 
### 
Wrapped up in the cozy, comforting
bubble wrap of Stanford, it can be
easy to forget just how compelling
and crazy the rest of the world is. Consider
India. Our main taste of this fascinating
country and its cultures generally comes just
once a week in the dining halls, and even the

recent horrific attacks in Mumbai were easy
to miss — they've already been relegated to
the nether regions of the New York Times
website.
But not all hope is lost for the
Stanfordite who wants to get a slice of India
this winter break. This is because of

"Slumdog Millionaire," the latest
film from the underratedly bril
liant director Danny Boyle
("Trainspotting," "28 Days
Later"). The movie offers a sear
ing portrait of modern urban
India and in particular, the slums
of Mumbai — the largest in the
world (and arguably the grimi
est).
What's more, "Millionaire"
tells a legitimately great personal
story. The somewhat confusing
title refers to the film's protago
nist, 19-year old (amal Malik, an
orphan from the slums who finds

himself in the contestant's chair on the
Indian version of "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire?". At the start of the movie, we
find Jamal — who has made it all the way to
the very last 20 million rupee question -
being brutally interrogated and accused of
cheating. Yet through a series of flashbacks

over the course of the story we discover that
Jamal did not in fact cheat, but that the ques
tions he has been getting — though impossi
bly difficult for the average kid from the
slums — all correlate to his life in a very
peculiar way. For the next two hours, the
screenplay by Simon Beaufoy cleverly shifts

between threeplotlines: Jamais

progression on the show,
his post-show inter-

rogation, and

most

the vital stats. AS ~.

An Indian "slumdog" tells the tale
of how he arrived at the last
question on Who Wants to be a
. Millionaire?

memorably, the traumatic tribulations of his past.
"Millionaire" is at its most potent in these flashbacks. The young
actors who play Jamal, his older cockier brother Salim and their sweet
friend Latika don't seem like actors at all, but are strikingly childlike in
the way they switch so naturally and realistically from wide-eyed won
der to shocking cruelty. Furthermore, while the film's device of using
Jamais answers on "Millionaire" to unlock his painful flashbacks seems
tacky in theory, in reality these are the movie's most captivating and
surprising moments. A question about the famous Bollywood star Anil
Kapoor becomes a hilarious episode in which a young Jamal risks
swimming through a river of fecal matter in order to get Kapoor's auto
graph. Conversely, a question about the inventor of the revolver, as one
could assume, leads to a different kind of flashback altogether.
Yet as wonderful as the writing and the actors are, the real star of
the movie is India itself. Boyle shoots the movie using massively wide
angles and in the most vivid colors, as if to indicate that he doesn't
want to leave anything out. In addition, the different ftttings depicted
in the film, which run the gamut from wealthy to woeful, seem to tell
their own story of India. In one scene Jamal and Salim see people die
before their eyes in their grief-stricken slum, then just as quickly we
find them raking in the cash by stealing the shoes of tourists at the Taj
Mahal. By never staying in one region or storyline for too long, the
movie constantly stays fresh. And of course Boyle's grand homage to
India isn't complete without a little Bollywood, so at the end of the
movie — just after our emotions have been completely sapped dry —
we arc treated to the spirited and amusing dance number "Jai Ho," led
by Jamais and Latikas of all ages.
It is hard to find much criticism with a film that is so informative,
emotional, funny and uplifting. It could be argued that the movie is
perhaps too simplistic in its depiction of heroes and villains, and it is at
times needlessly disgusting and violent. It would also be problematic to
look at the movie's sweeping scale and assume that it is, in and of itself,
"India: the Movie." Still, those concerns aside, it cannot be denied that
Boyle's film succeeds in what it sets out to do: it introduces its audience
to the complex world of modern India while telling a story that is at
once harrowing, hilarious and triumphant. As a passage to India,
"Slumdog Millionaire" reigns supreme.
