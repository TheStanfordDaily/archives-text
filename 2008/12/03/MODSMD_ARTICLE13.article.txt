## "Slumdog" a window to India Boyle stacks this fantastic tale with colorful scenery and characters 
### 
Wrapped up in the cozy, comforting
bubble wrap of Stanford, it can be
easy to forget just how compelling
and crazy the rest of the world is. Consider
India. Our main taste of this fascinating
country and its cultures generally comes just
once a week in the dining halls, and even the

recent horrific attacks in Mumbai were easy
to miss — they've already been relegated to
the nether regions of the New York Times
website.
But not all hope is lost for the
Stanfordite who wants to get a slice of India
this winter break. This is because of

"Slumdog Millionaire," the latest
film from the underratedly bril
liant director Danny Boyle
("Trainspotting," "28 Days
Later"). The movie offers a sear
ing portrait of modern urban
India and in particular, the slums
of Mumbai — the largest in the
world (and arguably the grimi
est).
What's more, "Millionaire"
tells a legitimately great personal
story. The somewhat confusing
title refers to the film's protago
nist, 19-year old (amal Malik, an
orphan from the slums who finds

himself in the contestant's chair on the
Indian version of "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire?". At the start of the movie, we
find Jamal — who has made it all the way to
the very last 20 million rupee question -
being brutally interrogated and accused of
cheating. Yet through a series of flashbacks

over the course of the story we discover that
Jamal did not in fact cheat, but that the ques
tions he has been getting — though impossi
bly difficult for the average kid from the
slums — all correlate to his life in a very
peculiar way. For the next two hours, the
screenplay by Simon Beaufoy cleverly shifts

between threeplotlines: Jamais

progression on the show,
his post-show inter-

rogation, and

most

the vital stats. AS ~.
