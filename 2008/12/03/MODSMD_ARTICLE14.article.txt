# Echoes from the past, "Milk" cries for a call to action in the name of gay rights
## 
### 
Glossy, poctic biopics don't
always arrive at the right time
in the right place. Wrapping a
real, fallible individual in the soft
focus gauze of the silver screen, biog
raphical films can often dance per
ilously close to the Chasm of the
Saccharine or the Ravine of Deadly
Boredom.
But Gus Van Sant's artfully crafted
"Milk" has the good fortune to be the
right film at the right time, and it cer
tainly deserves to be taken seriously.
Yes, "Milk" envisions politician Harvey
Milk as a larger-than-life, tragic-hero
ic, wise-cracking gay icon whose every
move was seen from a flattering cam
era angle. But what's so wrong with a
little hero-making? Especially in these

teary Prop. 8 times, "Milk" delivers a
much-needed (if slightly maudlin)
injection of flaming, prancing, ludy
Garland-loving hope.
Harvey Milk (Scan Penn), the first
openly gay candidate to be elected to a
major American political office, served
just 11 months as a San Francisco city
supervisor before he and mayor
George Moscone (Victor Garber) were
assassinated in 1978 by fellow supervi
sor Dan White (Josh Brolin). Milk was
a groundbreaking activist and an ener
getic politician, but it's likely that most
of the Californian 20-somethings who
campaigned energetically against Prop.
8 won't have known very much about
Milk until "Milk." The film, which
blends some painless history lessons
with universally fine acting, is a victo
ry for the biopic genre, not least
because it successfully goes about the
business of resurrecting a semi-forgot
ten story that deserves remembering.
The Milk story has been cinemati
cally presented before, in Rob Epstein's
Oscar-winning documentary, "The
Times of Harvey Milk" ( Van

Sant's film echoes a great deal of the
archival footage, photos and audio
clips used in the documentary: TV
interviews with Milk are reenacted,
hippie wardrobes are meticulously
copied and street-fronts from 1970s
San Francisco are recreated with stun
ning accuracy. Everything is shot in
deep, dark color, with an emphasis on
dark; night scenes dominate, particu
larly the rally sequences, in which
striking, wide-angle shots hint at the
immensity and fervor of the crowds
that marched with Milk through the
streets of Frisco.
While covering documentary ter
ritory, "Milk" also adds semi-specula
tive insight into Harvey's personal life,
which fresh-faced screenwriter Dustin

Lance black laces skillfully throughout
the script. The film begins, tantalizing
ly, with the 40-year-old Milk chatting
up a much younger man in a New
York subway tunnel. That man, Scott
Smith (James Franco), becomes
Harvey's long-term partner, with
whom he moves to San Francisco,
where Harvey fashions himself as the
unofficial Mayor of Castro Street,
while Smith languishes quietly in the
background like an over-tasked First
Lady.
Penn might not seem like the
gayest of men, but he is after all an
actor, and he's working hard for the
money. Undergoing an astounding
physical transformation, Penn pitches
his voice upwards, miraculously loses
his husky smoker's rasp, picks up
Milk's Long Island lew intonations
and mirrors his boyish, upturned-lip
smile. Penn even cultivates some sur
prising onscreen tension with Franco
the whole thing is certainly sexier
than any grunting encounter from
"Brokeback Mountain." But maybe it
isn't too surprising that "Milk" con-

tains some convincing boy-on-boy
moments; after all, Van Sant has cer
tainly proved himself as a master of
the bromance genre (as in "Finding
Forrester," "Good Will Hunting," etc.).
The title of the Epstein documen
tary — "The Times of Harvey Milk"
— suggested, perhaps, that the "times"
were more important than the life.
And while Harvey is the charming,
magnetic center of "Milk," the Film's
focus is ultimately on the times — the
determined struggle of the gay move
ment that Harvey put before all else in
his short political career.
"Milk" opened just weeks after the
passage of Prop. 8 and just days before
the 30th anniversary of Harvey's
death. In these modern times, the Film

Drama
Sean Ptnn plays Harvey Milk, the
first publicly gay politician and gay

is spookily resonant; some of Harvey's
crowd-rousing speeches even echo our
president-elect: "I know that you can
not live on hope alone," Harvey said,
"but without it, life is not worth liv
ing." Like much of the Van Sant oeu
vre, the film is a stylized, heartstring
tugging, impossibly poetic rift on
human life, like some sort of
Christmas special for smart adults. Hut
it's also touching and well-executed
and, for certain audiences, frankly
inspiring. Luckily, "Milk" has arrived
at the right time.
