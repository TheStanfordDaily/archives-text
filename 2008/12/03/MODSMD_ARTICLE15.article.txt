## A&A with director Gus Van Sant and cast members of "Milk" 
### 
It's almost 1 p.m. on a Wednesday afternoon, and I'm
sitting next to a transvestite journalist in a tent at the
Ritz Carlton in San Francisco. The transvestite is read
ing The Economist while I'm watching Sean Penn put out
his cigarette in Gus Van Sant's water glass. Typical, really.
The day after the San Francisco premiere of "Milk,"
some of the illustrious cast, plus director Gus Van Sant
and screenwriter Dustin Lance Black, met the press, who
were bribed into docility with hella swag (sweatshirts!
bags! tiny bottles of Diet Coke!). The gays showed up in
joyous abundance, but even the straight journos seemed
thoroughly awed by the film — awed enough to preface
nearly every query with a compliment.
But even lavish praise wasn't enough to make our lit
tle tent very lively, and the beloved actors seemed slightly
down. Porquois? (A clue: Muffled mumblings were
exchanged about throbbing hangovers while Sean Penn
and Josh Brolin passed a cigarette back and forth behind
Van Sant's back, pre-conference).
"Milk" contains some unusually steamy man-on-man
action, and the press was wildly curious about the
onscreen romantic ties between Milk and his lovers Scott
Smith (James Franco) and Jack Lira (Diego Luna), both
of whom are played by straight actors.
Penn and Franco happily asserted that they had no
qualms about accepting gay roles. Penn mused, "I always
work on the 'It only hurts the first time' philosophy," to
which Brolin huskily replied, "Breathe ... breathe ...
breathe ..." With regards to his numerous smooching
scenes, Penn said that he was helped along by "the
Stanislavskian breath mints."
Although the onscreen chemistry between Milk and
his lovers is tangible and ample, Van Sant admitted that it
was largely the product of creative imagination.
"The artistic license takes over and you kind of make
it up, basically," he said. "I think even if we knew Scott
Smith and Harvey and Jack, if they were all alive today,
they wouldn't be able to act out today what they did in
the bedroom, and if they did ... you know ... it would
be weird."
But how to parse the good artistic license from the
bad?
"If it looks good," Van Sant said, "we keep it."
As we reporters whispered our timid questions, Penn
and Brolin taunted each other mischievously with flashes
of acerbic humor that pierced, lightening-like, through
the fogs of so many thespian hangovers. After a reporter
described Valencia Street as a former dyke hangout, Penn
whispered, "Did you notice that when you brought up the
name of the lesbian street that Josh Brolin real quick
scribbled it down?" Brolin leaned intently into the mic
and husked, "I hate Sean Penn."
In the midst of all the fun snarking, the actors (Penn,
Brolin, Allison Pill, James Franco and Emile Hirsch were
all present) were occasionally deadly serious, particularly
with reference to their unflagging allegiance to Harvey
Milk and his agenda. The press conference seemed to
serve double duty — it was simultaneously a James
Lipton-style artistic interrogation (How do you get in
character?) and a discussion of activism.
The 23-year-old Hirsch (who plays Milk's young
activist sidekick, Cleve Jones) expressed his generation's
solidarity with the gay movement.
"These inspirational figures are valuable to young people," he said, with reference to both Milk and Obama.
"It's not all about the Xbox 360, you know."
Van Sant, Black and the cast seemed just as vocally enthused about gay rights as they were about the film
itself. And it's clear that "Milk" was both a deeply political and an artistic venture; Black wrote the screenplay, he
said, partly to encourage political activism.
Pill talked about her character's hair (it's her real hair!); Hirsch talked about his character's hair (it's his real
hair!); Brolin talked about his penchant for playing villains (he finds them fascinating); and Van Sant talked
about finding Super-8 footage of the Castro and shooting on location.
But 1 only had eyes for the rumpled, chain-smoking Penn because — wait for it — he spoke to me. As I
grasped the mic and asked a question that crashed and burned, Penn made some "I can't hear you" faces and said
to me, "You just gotta get a little closer to it." Oh 1 will, Sean Penn. I will.
