# Not "harder, better, faster, stronger"
## "808s" takes an introspective turn 
### 
For many avid listeners across the coun
try, the next album from hugely popu
lar rap artist Kanye West was anticipat
ed to be the fourth in his "college"' series.
After his smash hit "Graduation" that came
out last year, the next album was supposed to
be entitled "Good Ass Job," because in theory,
that is what students get after completing
their college education.
Fans and listeners worldwide were in for
a surprise, however, with West changing the
sound, feel and theme of his new album

entirely.
West has had a very difficult year in
many respect: Donda West, his mother,
passed away from plastic surgery complica
tions; he was arrested twice after altercations
with paparazzi; and to add even more excru
ciating icing to the painful cake, West's
fiancee of 18 months, designer Alexis Phifer,
broke up with him. So instead of the inspira
tional, uplifting theme of the album "Good
Ass Job," fans were gifted with some insight
into Kanye's broken heart.

"808 sand Heartbreak" is full of loss,
despair, tragedy and, well, heartbreak. On the
track "Heartless," written in a spiteful tone
aimed at his ex, Kanye asks, "How could you
be so heartless?" On "Street Lights," a mourn
ful West sings, "I'm just not there ... life's
just not fair." These themes are repeated
throughout the entire album, bringing the
listener into Kanye's inescapable unhappiness
and despair.
While "808 sand Heartbreak" sounds
entirely melancholy and is not a particular
joy to listen to, Kanye makes sure to infuse
his signature creativity that has made him so
successful thus far. He incorporates ambient
sounds, disco beats, retro pop and 1970s
glam. The term 808 is a reference to the

Roland TR-808 drum machine that is persist
ent and relentless throughout the entire
album, a mainstay along with the use of
auto-tune, which creates the distorted robot
ic voice used frequently by Lil Wayne and T-
Pain.
For those expecting the bravado that has
been so long associated with Kanyc West,
"808 sand Heartbreak" will be a surprisingly
introspective album, which is not necessarily
a bad thing. He has become somber and
bashful, rather than regularly asserting that,
he is the "best rapper alive." One look at the <***
album cover, a saggy balloon in the shape of
a squashed heart, shows that this is going to
be different from the rest. However, different
isn't always bad. While "808 sand
Heartbreak" definitely isn't Kanye's best
work, it is still absolutely worth listening to
and appreciating — at least until Kanye has
the heart to pump out "Good Ass Job."
