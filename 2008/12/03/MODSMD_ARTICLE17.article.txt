# "Hope" strikes the same old (but good) note
## 
### 
Brett Denncn has been a minor name
on the indie circuit for a while now,
but his new record "Hope for the
Hopeless" represents a real effort to reach a
larger audience. Judging by the recording's
sheer pleasantness, his strategy very well
might work.
The 6-foot singer-songwriter, straight
out of Oakdale and oddly effeminate under
his mop of tousled red hair, fits pretty easily
into the highly melodic pop-rock pegholc,
complete with all the VVurlitzers and wistful
sentiment the genre requires. Still, he does
fuzz the edges a bit, nodding to other genres
both in content — Afro-beat favorite Femi
Kuti provides guest vocals on "Make You
Crazy — and in style. His voice, for instance,
sounds a little like Amy Winehouse with a
pair of testicles and a brain full of serotonin.
On "Heaven," one of the album's
strongest tracks, Dennen slurs and artfully
mumbles his way through swooping elisions
like "No law and no reeeeeeliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiijuuu
uuuuuuuuuuunnnnnn," clearly drawing back
the corners of his mouth in a smiling gri
mace, as rockers are prone to do. It's a sweet,
sloppy sound, and it balances neatly atop
both his laidback R&B-style guitar riffs and
offbeat tambourine jangles and the occasion
al bonier, finger-picking number.
His brand of lyrics often fits the style,
too. Dennen is clearly a clever writer, and the
man has a talent for finding felicitous

rhyming pairs that immediately evoke the
song's core tone. "Gonna buy me an old
Victorian/Down in the Lower Haight/Gonna
buy me an old accordion/And play for the
tourists on the Golden Gate," he sings in "San
Francisco," the album's opener. It's the sort of
assonance Ogden Nash might have thrown
around if he'd just smoked a bowl.
That being said, Dennen has a tendency
to be a little scattershot in the macrostruc
ture of his songs. "San Francisco" is expressly
about forgetting a woman, but the story
seems to sprawl out under the weight of its
own quirkily comprehensive vision of the
city. "It's a real good baseball town/but my
team is across the bay," he says, and even if
it's an astute commentary on the A's hipster
status, Dennen seems more like Donny
Osmond reaching for a rhyme than Leonard
Cohen equating a city's aura with a recent
breakup.
Even worse, many of the songs are sim
ply inoffensive, like the oddly unfocused pol
itics of "Make You Crazy." Maybe we should
have seen it coming in an album with a title
as consciously post-ironic as "Hope for the
Hopeless" (as if Modest Mouse had never
existed), packed full with songs named
"Follow Your Heart" and "Ain't Gonna Lose
You." It's often charming in its cliched sincer
ity, as if he were being so open with his audi
ence that he simply had no time for original
ity, but occasionally it gets hard to shake the

feeling that there's nothing more to it.
The long and the short of it is that
Dennen is a highly competent man. His
arrangements are tight, his musicianship is
relaxed and confident, and, when he stays on
topic, his lyrics are imaginative. This combi
nation of qualities should sell records, and
more power to him. Still, his style lacks a cer
tain innovative quality. Maybe it's just that it
all seems to come so easily to him, but
Dennen is, frankly, nothing new.
