# Britney's demise set straight?
## Spears attempts to come clean in MTV documentary 
### 
As the old adage goes, "the two things
that are most certain in life are death
and taxes." While that may be true,
there is one other thing that is always a given
in everyday life. If you are to open up a
tabloid or celebrity gossip website, Britney
Spears will most certainly grace the page.
Known for her marriage and divorce from
upstanding gentleman Kevin Federline, fre
quenting gas station bathrooms barefoot,
shaving her head, beating up paparazzi with
umbrellas and driving her car with her
infants sitting on her lap, Britney has had it
rough the last several years. Times are chang
ing, though. Britney has begun her "come
back," attempting to take the pop world by
storm, once again claiming her title of
"Princess of Fop."
So far, her comeback is looking to be
potentially successful. She recently walked
away with three Video Music Awards for her
video, "Piece Of Me." While it certainly was
not the best video of the year, it was the least
MTV could do to make up for last year's
embarrassing performance of' Gimme More,'
where the network clearly exploited Britney
for publicity, and used her when she was
unfit for public appearance. Still, an award is
an award. Her single' Womanizer' is breaking
chart records now, and its accompanying
video is a smart, sexy follow up to her smash
hit "Toxic."

Her new album 'Circus' was released on
Dec. 2, but the step Britney chose to take
before releasing her hopeful comeback record
was to allow MTV to follow her around for
60 days, documenting her back in action and
working on promotion of the album and her
new image. The documentary entitled
"Britney: For The Record" aired on Nov. 30
on MTV, with millions of viewers casting
their judgmental eyes on America's favorite
trainwreck.
MTV previewed the doc by counting
down its ten favorite Britney moments on
the network, ranging from her iconic per
formance of "I'm A Slave 4 U" with the snake
around her neck, to her legendary kiss with
Madonna. With a live studio audience sur
rounding her, Britney looked shy and a bit
wary on the preview show, though back in
shape and very well made up.
The documentary features Britney
speaking candidly to her interviewer in her
hotel room. She speaks without prompts, and
seems mentally present and aware of her sur
roundings, quite the improvement over pre
vious years. She muses, "I'm a smart girl...
what the hell was I thinking?"
Her honesty and perplexed nature is
very endearing to viewers, who begin to tcel
sorry for the girl who was thrust into the
spotlight at a very young age, and never given
the opportunity to gain real lite skills.

Along with Britney's interview, the doc
umentary shows glimpses into Britney's
rehearsal periods, downtime, cover shoots
and everyday life. At one point, over fifty cars
are following Britney's black Suburban. She
looks just like a deer in the headlights, whis
pering "I'm scared" to her bodyguards pack
ing her into the car, as paparazzi try to force
her to either stop or go off the road. It
becomes clear that there is a price with her
magnitude of fame. "I always wonder why I
didn't just up and leave L.A. and take me and
the kids back to Louisiana," Britney wonders.
"That would have been best for us. I don't
know why I didn't do that."
While coherent and professional now, it
is clear from the film that Britney isn't com
pletely happy with her life, and she regularly
asserts that she feels like a prisoner in her
own home. She says, "If I could do anything,
I would take me and my babies to an island,
and just relax for a long time. That's what I
would do." Well, she has the money to do
that, so why doesn't she? It clearly would be
best for her.
"Britney: For The Record" shows viewers
an honest side of Britney Spears, but it does
n't necessarily clear anything up. I didn't
leave the television understanding why she
married Kevin Federline, or why she refused
to attend court hearings regarding custody of
her children. Watching candid scenes of

Britney goofing around with her dad and
entourage was certainly endearing, and her
work on Circus looks like it will definitely
pay off, but all of it left some unanswered
questions. Still, it might be time for her to
take some time off to relax and be with her
family, instead of staging a comeback when it
doesn't look like she is quite ready for it yet.
Catch "Britney: For The Record" on Dec.
3 at 3 p.m. and 9 p.m., Dec. 4 at 10 a.m. and
Dec. 5 at 5 p.m. on MTV.
