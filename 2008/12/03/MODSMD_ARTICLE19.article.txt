# "Timbuktu to Cape Town" shows breadth and intricacy of African art
## 
### 
Beginning today, the leg
endary, faraway town of
Timbuktu will be just down
the road. Comprised of artifacts
from all over Africa, the Cantor Art
Center's exhibit "From Timbuktu
to Cape Town" is a treat for art, his
tory and anthropology lovers.
Walking into the show, visitors are
greeted by a set of magnificent
robes, which serve as both a symbol
of social status and authority and a
tribute to the superb craftsmanship
of dyeing, weaving and embroidery
originated from Western Africa. As
visitors begin to circulate around
the room, a pattern emerges from
the arrangement of the displays;
rather than being grouped by time
or place, objects in the exhibit are
placed together in terms of their
use.
"The works are grouped loose
ly around three categories —
objects that adorn the human body,
objects related to the home and
those created for ritual use —
although, in fact, their meanings
and utility overlap and converge,"
said Cantor Arts Center Director
Thomas K. Seligman, the curator
for the exhibit, in a press release.
"We designed this to expand
visitors' concepts and understand
ings of art in Africa," he added,
"and these works reveal media and
subject matter well beyond the fig
urative wooden sculpture and
masks that often typify displays of
African art."
One corner hosts an array of
20th century household objects,
including a wooden housepost
adorned with feminine symbolism
that hails from Burkina Faso, a
Nigerian terra cotta pot and a
wooden and metal door (complete
with a lock and crossbar) also from
Burkina Faso. A nearby case is
home to a South African spoon
carved from wood; a Namibian
baby basket creatively composed of
metal, leather, powdered bark and
fat pigment; and a set of elegant
elephant ivory Sudanese Kohl con
tainers — all signs of a lifestyle
intriguingly not so dissimilar from
our modern, Western practices.
Continuing their tour of the
African home across space and
time, viewers come across two fas
cinating stools in the form of
human shapes, one from 20th cen
tury Angola, and the other from
Cameroon. The Angolese stool has
an androgenous human form remi

niscent of ancient Greek Cycladic
figures as a base, while the other
displays a voluptuous female figure
holding a calabash.
Pulling themselves away from
these riveting figures, visitors to the
exhibition will be drawn towards a
display case featuring musical
instruments hailing from a range of
African cities, from Sierra Leone to
the Congo. These instruments,
including a trumpet carved from
an ivory tusk and a wooden whis
tle, are not only aesthetic art forms
in themselves, but shed light on the
multitude of expressive avenues for
African music, beyond the expected
stereotypical drums and vocals.
In fact, many of these objects
related to the home are surprising
in their applications. What at first
glance appear to be purely decora
tive objects, such as the stools and
Kohl containers, turn out to have
important household functions. A
gracefully shaped iron implement
ornamented with intricate engrav
ings, for example, served as a form

of currency in several 19th century
African communities. As iron was a
very rare element, various iron
objects could be bartered for grain
and other neccessities. A similarly
decorative-looking iron shape in a
nearby case is revealed upon closer
inspection (or upon reading the
label) to be a bellows, used
throughout Africa to bolster the
heat of fires in order to forge metal.
Of course, many objects in this
exhibit are deceptive in their
appearance. Due to the aesthetic
appeal of African craftsmanship,
viewers may assume that several
items are strictly ornamental.
However, all of the displays have
some functional value. As visitors
move away from the household
grouping, they begin to see items
created for ritual use. Votive figures
from all corners of Africa, a
Liberian helmet festooned with
horns meant for masquerading and i
a Tabwa figure emerging from a
gourd seem to emote a sense of
spirituality. The half-figure emerg-

ing from the gourd is particularly
interesting, as it is symbolic of
humans stemming from the spirit
world — represented by the
gourd — into the world of men
with which we are all familiar.
Similarly captivating are the
articles of clothing and jewelry
fashioned to adorn the human
body. A length of cloth spanning
the entirety of one of the exhibits
walls is actually a Congolese

woman's skirt brilliantly embroi
dered and dyed to serve as an
emblem of African beauty.
Astonishing necklaces, amulets and
women's neck rings fashioned from
bronze and gold are scattered
throughout the displays, accentuat
ed by modern photographs of peo
ple wearing the displayed items.
One of the strengths of this
exhibit is the way it puts all of its
elements into context. A video put
together by Dabney Lyles '08 allows
viewers to see the use and making
of various items in the display.
Interspersed with contextual pho
tos and accentuated by African
music in the background, the video
places a focus on the importance of
the exhbited items to individuals.
As Alison Roth, assistant to the
director of Cantor Arts Center as
well as an organizer of the exhibit,
explained, the video allows individ
uals to express their personal
attachment to items and why they
would want to collect them.
"We're really trying to make

this place a resource for Stanford
students," Roth said. "Seeing these
objects in person instead of on a
textbook page really adds some
thing to learning, really makes it
come alive."
Indeed, rather than focusing
on the ritual sculptures and masks
that so often characterize African
art, this exhibit endeavors to shift
the focus to a broader range of
media, giving viewers a sense of the
care and craftsmanship imbued in
even the seemingly mundane
objects on display. In this regard,
"From Timbuktu to Cape Town" is
a show that truly displays Cantor's
"Passion for Collecting."
Though the show officially
opens today, the museum will open
its doors this Thursday evening,
from 7 to 9 p.m., for students to
view the new addition, as well as
the recently opened "Diirer to
Picasso" exhibit. There will be spe
cial activities throughout the muse
um that promise to make the night
an exciting and enjoyable study
break.

COURTESY CANTOR ARTS
Beginning today, the leg
endary, faraway town of
Timbuktu will be just down
the road. Comprised of artifacts
from all over Africa, the Cantor Art
Center's exhibit "From Timbuktu
to Cape Town" is a treat for art, his
tory and anthropology lovers.
Walking into the show, visitors are
greeted by a set of magnificent
robes, which serve as both a symbol
of social status and authority and a
tribute to the superb craftsmanship
of dyeing, weaving and embroidery
originated from Western Africa. As
visitors begin to circulate around
the room, a pattern emerges from
the arrangement of the displays;
rather than being grouped by time
or place, objects in the exhibit are
placed together in terms of their
use.
"The works are grouped loose
ly around three categories —
objects that adorn the human body,
objects related to the home and
those created for ritual use —
although, in fact, their meanings
and utility overlap and converge,"
said Cantor Arts Center Director
Thomas K. Seligman, the curator
for the exhibit, in a press release.
"We designed this to expand
visitors' concepts and understand
ings of art in Africa," he added,
"and these works reveal media and
subject matter well beyond the fig
urative wooden sculpture and
masks that often typify displays of
African art."
One corner hosts an array of
20th century household objects,
including a wooden housepost
adorned with feminine symbolism
that hails from Burkina Faso, a
Nigerian terra cotta pot and a
wooden and metal door (complete
with a lock and crossbar) also from
Burkina Faso. A nearby case is
home to a South African spoon
carved from wood; a Namibian
baby basket creatively composed of
metal, leather, powdered bark and
fat pigment; and a set of elegant
elephant ivory Sudanese Kohl con
tainers — all signs of a lifestyle
intriguingly not so dissimilar from
our modern, Western practices.
Continuing their tour of the
African home across space and
time, viewers come across two fas
cinating stools in the form of
human shapes, one from 20th cen
tury Angola, and the other from
Cameroon. The Angolese stool has
an androgenous human form remi

niscent of ancient Greek Cycladic
figures as a base, while the other
displays a voluptuous female figure
holding a calabash.
Pulling themselves away from
these riveting figures, visitors to the
exhibition will be drawn towards a
display case featuring musical
instruments hailing from a range of
African cities, from Sierra Leone to
the Congo. These instruments,
including a trumpet carved from
an ivory tusk and a wooden whis
tle, are not only aesthetic art forms
in themselves, but shed light on the
multitude of expressive avenues for
African music, beyond the expected
stereotypical drums and vocals.
In fact, many of these objects
related to the home are surprising
in their applications. What at first
glance appear to be purely decora
tive objects, such as the stools and
Kohl containers, turn out to have
important household functions. A
gracefully shaped iron implement
ornamented with intricate engrav
ings, for example, served as a form

of currency in several 19th century
African communities. As iron was a
very rare element, various iron
objects could be bartered for grain
and other neccessities. A similarly
decorative-looking iron shape in a
nearby case is revealed upon closer
inspection (or upon reading the
label) to be a bellows, used
throughout Africa to bolster the
heat of fires in order to forge metal.
Of course, many objects in this
exhibit are deceptive in their
appearance. Due to the aesthetic
appeal of African craftsmanship,
viewers may assume that several
items are strictly ornamental.
However, all of the displays have
some functional value. As visitors
move away from the household
grouping, they begin to see items
created for ritual use. Votive figures
from all corners of Africa, a
Liberian helmet festooned with
horns meant for masquerading and i
a Tabwa figure emerging from a
gourd seem to emote a sense of
spirituality. The half-figure emerg-

ing from the gourd is particularly
interesting, as it is symbolic of
humans stemming from the spirit
world — represented by the
gourd — into the world of men
with which we are all familiar.
Similarly captivating are the
articles of clothing and jewelry
fashioned to adorn the human
body. A length of cloth spanning
the entirety of one of the exhibits
walls is actually a Congolese

woman's skirt brilliantly embroi
dered and dyed to serve as an
emblem of African beauty.
Astonishing necklaces, amulets and
women's neck rings fashioned from
bronze and gold are scattered
throughout the displays, accentuat
ed by modern photographs of peo
ple wearing the displayed items.
One of the strengths of this
exhibit is the way it puts all of its
elements into context. A video put
together by Dabney Lyles '08 allows
viewers to see the use and making
of various items in the display.
Interspersed with contextual pho
tos and accentuated by African
music in the background, the video
places a focus on the importance of
the exhbited items to individuals.
As Alison Roth, assistant to the
director of Cantor Arts Center as
well as an organizer of the exhibit,
explained, the video allows individ
uals to express their personal
attachment to items and why they
would want to collect them.
"We're really trying to make

this place a resource for Stanford
students," Roth said. "Seeing these
objects in person instead of on a
textbook page really adds some
thing to learning, really makes it
come alive."
Indeed, rather than focusing
on the ritual sculptures and masks
that so often characterize African
art, this exhibit endeavors to shift
the focus to a broader range of
media, giving viewers a sense of the
care and craftsmanship imbued in
even the seemingly mundane
objects on display. In this regard,
"From Timbuktu to Cape Town" is
a show that truly displays Cantor's
"Passion for Collecting."
Though the show officially
opens today, the museum will open
its doors this Thursday evening,
from 7 to 9 p.m., for students to
view the new addition, as well as
the recently opened "Diirer to
Picasso" exhibit. There will be spe
cial activities throughout the muse
um that promise to make the night
an exciting and enjoyable study
break.
