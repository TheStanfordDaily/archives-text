# GIFT CENTRAL
## Lazy man's gift guide 
### 
Think you're too lazy for holiday shopping?
Intermission's got you covered

Still got some juice?
" You're tired. But not tired enough that you can't
make one last trip to University Ave. before catching your
Super Shuttle back home. Okay, you want to get a salad at Sprout
and a new purple hoodie at American Apparel, too. That's beside the
point.

To please dad or big brother, check out the Sports Gallery, which is filled with
fine sports memorabilia, like a signed Hank Aaron baseball ($295). If you really
want to splurge, go for the signed Michael Jordan Chicago Bulls No. 23 jersey. It
could be hanging in your old mans den for a mere $3,195.
For slightly cheaper gift, head down the street to Longs Drugs. Your underage
brother will appreciate a case of Busch Light. You can pick up assorted Lipsmackers
and colorful nail polish for baby sister. It's possible you will regret the purchase when
the fumes from her Lincoln Park After Dark lacquer stink up the living room, but
her nails will be looking swanky and very emo.
For your grandmother, mother or adult sister, head to A View From the Terrace,
a newer shop off University. Pick up unique gift items like handmade
\AnnieGlass Handkerchief Votive Candles ($45 each) or Petite Essence air
scent in Golden Pomegranate ($4O). Any woman in your life will appre- >
ciate luxury soaps in Mediterranean Jasmine or Lemon Verbena /
v (from $18). /

Not leaving your room for anything? Not a chance?
Ironically, for the laziest of all, the most options arise. The gift and
curse of Internet shopping means all your material wants are just a few clicks
away. And looky here, your dad's credit card number is still saved on Amazon.com .
To put a philanthropic spin on your holiday season, visit BoGoLight.com. Purchase a
solar-powered flashlight (only $25!) for any camper or other person who may need a light.
For each flashlight purchased, another is donated to a person in a developing country. Talk
about lighting up someone's day.
For quirky recipients, try Fredflare.com where you can browse tons of strange and silly items
at affordable prices. Our favorites are the ducky ear buds ($l5), bacon band-aids and bacon floss
(nine dollars each), Juno cheeseburger phone ($26) and the snake bike lock ($34) — perfect for
your Stanford friends.
There are gifts aplenty for every giver, no matter how lazy or lame. There are no excuses for
skimping on gifts this year — not even the economy If you're really pressed for cash, check out
our do-it-yourself last-minute-gift idea on page two.

Y lis' the season for cheer,
eggnog lattes, potato latkes and,
of course, consumption. When finals
are getting you down, you can always
turn to your holiday shopping to pass the
time. But wait, you're way too tired to
actually do any real gift buying. Which is
why Intermission brings your our Lazy
Man's Gift Guide, with levels of lazi-
ness to match any burnt-out stu-
dent's wish list.

No way you're leaving campus?
While there aren't many on-campus options for gift buying, it is
possible to get creative if you put your mind to it. First stop, Jamba
Juice. Gift cards make lame gifts, but great stocking stuffers — and at only
five dollars each, you can afford one for the whole family and still have some
left over for a Caribbean Passion before Humßio lecture.
If your family is over Jamba, head over to the Y2E2 building and check out
the newly opened Coupa Cafe. Owned by the same family as the University Ave.
location, Coupa offers a selection of gourmet coffees and tasty candies that make
great hostess gifts. And, since so few people know about the brand new cafe, your
relatives might even think you went off campus to pick up these delights.
Finally, there's the Bookstore. Okay, you're thinking "Mom doesn't need
another 'Stanford Parent' sweatshirt," but the fact of the matter is, it is a book
store. Try an exotic coffee table book for your mom's living room, or a travel
book for the family jetsetter. A Moleskine journal makes an easy yet
k thoughtful gift for your overly introspective sibling.
