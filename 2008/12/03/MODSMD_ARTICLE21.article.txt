Mouth Melters: Roxy has her cake and
eats it too!
Urp. Excuse me while I rub my painfully full belly
and search the fridge for more leftovers. Hiccup.
Oooh, a half-empty bottle of wine! And the last
slice of pecan pie! Uhhh.
Indulgence rules the appetite this week, and
I'm not just talking about food. What better to
complement a warm slice of turkey than a little
sauce-making between the sheets? Food and sex
go together like (insert naughty analogy here!);
and in honor of our glorious gobble-day, I've
made a list of lip-licking edibles to garnish that
Thanksgiving feast (and each other!). Table man
ners not required.
Ice cream: With just a gazillion flavors to match
everyone's particular appetites, ice cream will
never cease to be exciting. The spiritual and
experimental can lap up Ben and Jerry's "Karamel
Sutra" in between contortions. Those who like a
little "icing" after the fact should head to Cold
Stone Creamery for a pint of "Cake Batter." Two
redheads doing the deed can laugh (and gasp in
ecstasy) over San Francisco treasure Bi-Rite
Creamery's "Double Ginger." Don't let your imagi-
nation stop there!
Chocolate: Yes, it's classic, but a deeper
look into the realm of cacao delights will
reveal a diverse bounty of forms and fla
vors to choose from. Spice up a cold
winter night with tongue-tingling
Mexican hot chocolate, or drizzle
home-made fondue in the places that
need warming up. Feed each other dainties out
of a box, or lace your kisses with Godiva chocolate
liqueur, and perhaps a spoonful of vanilla ice
cream.
Oysters: Resemblance to the female nether lips
isn't the oyster's only erotic allure. Oysters are also
high in zinc, which is necessary for sperm produc
tion. Casanova apparently chowed down on 50
raw oysters before breakfast. Plus, they're positive
ly delicious. Serve 'em up on a platter of ice with
freshly cut lemons, hot pepper sauce and a vine
gary mignonette sauce, and enjoy these briny
"mouthfuls of sea" — preferably beachside.
Raspberries: Screw strawberries. I'm sick of straw
berries. Raspberries are where it's at. Juicier, more
luscious and altogether more charming, raspber
ries are a graceful addition to a glass of cham
pagne — and a fun finale when that lajt sip of
golden elixir has met your lips. Pop one into your
partner's mouth and get his (or her) juices flow
ing, or dunk them into above-mentioned choco
late fondue and send your taste buds to the high
heavens.
Things on Skewers: Rawrrr ... The sheer thought
of big hunks of sizzling meat and
steaming veggies sandwiched
together on a big stick (and per
haps the imaginary hottie man
ning my imaginary grill) brings
out this one's inner tigress. Get
carnal by cooking in the nude
and feeding each other each
savory bite.

DEAR DR. PAUL,
As you have probably heard, it's Dead Week on Stanford
campus, which means papers, projects and studying for
finals next week. I have a butt-load of stuff to do, and
am thinking about pulling a few all-nighters.
that will help me focus and keep me up?
Dear Future Addict,
In my experience, drugs are always the answer. In order for you to stay up all
night, you'll be wanting to get your hands on some stimulants, aka uppers. We'll
start with some basics.
Caffeine: found in coffee, green tea and energy drinks. A typical cup of coffee
has about 80-120 mg of caffeine, which should probably keep you running for a few
of those late-night hours, as long as you consume consistently.
Cocaine: used commonly by folks in the finance industry to stay up late and
create sub-prime mortgage packages. It will definitely keep you running all night
long, but don't be surprised if it makes you feel like you should go clubbing rather
than read another chapter out of your Math 51 book.
Adderall: score some from your friends that have ADHL). It does the same thing
as cocaine but since real doctors prescribe it, it isn't bad for you.
If you aren't willing to do what it takes and fill your
body with drugs, there is another option. My friend ■
T.J. likes to do push-ups to keep himself awake. Not 112
only does this technique give you ripped pecs, but it / , \
also causes you to sleep through your alarm the next I I [ J 1
morning. Whatever you decide to do, remember 1 I W I 1-3
that you are young and everything that you put in Jq
your body will not have any long-term conse-
DP
Got a burning question you can't ask anyone else?
