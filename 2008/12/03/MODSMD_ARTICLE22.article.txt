Urp. Excuse me while I rub my painfully full belly
and search the fridge for more leftovers. Hiccup.
Oooh, a half-empty bottle of wine! And the last
slice of pecan pie! Uhhh.
Indulgence rules the appetite this week, and
I'm not just talking about food. What better to
complement a warm slice of turkey than a little
sauce-making between the sheets? Food and sex
go together like (insert naughty analogy here!);
and in honor of our glorious gobble-day, I've
made a list of lip-licking edibles to garnish that
Thanksgiving feast (and each other!). Table man
ners not required.
Ice cream: With just a gazillion flavors to match
everyone's particular appetites, ice cream will
never cease to be exciting. The spiritual and
experimental can lap up Ben and Jerry's "Karamel
Sutra" in between contortions. Those who like a
little "icing" after the fact should head to Cold
Stone Creamery for a pint of "Cake Batter." Two
redheads doing the deed can laugh (and gasp in
ecstasy) over San Francisco treasure Bi-Rite
Creamery's "Double Ginger." Don't let your imagi-

nation stop there!
Chocolate: Yes, it's classic, but a deeper
look into the realm of cacao delights will
reveal a diverse bounty of forms and fla
vors to choose from. Spice up a cold
winter night with tongue-tingling
Mexican hot chocolate, or drizzle
home-made fondue in the places that

need warming up. Feed each other dainties out

of a box, or lace your kisses with Godiva chocolate
liqueur, and perhaps a spoonful of vanilla ice

cream.
Oysters: Resemblance to the female nether lips
isn't the oyster's only erotic allure. Oysters are also
high in zinc, which is necessary for sperm produc
tion. Casanova apparently chowed down on 50
raw oysters before breakfast. Plus, they're positive
ly delicious. Serve 'em up on a platter of ice with
freshly cut lemons, hot pepper sauce and a vine
gary mignonette sauce, and enjoy these briny
"mouthfuls of sea" — preferably beachside.
Raspberries: Screw strawberries. I'm sick of straw
berries. Raspberries are where it's at. Juicier, more
luscious and altogether more charming, raspber
ries are a graceful addition to a glass of cham
pagne — and a fun finale when that lajt sip of
golden elixir has met your lips. Pop one into your
partner's mouth and get his (or her) juices flow
ing, or dunk them into above-mentioned choco
late fondue and send your taste buds to the high
heavens.
Things on Skewers: Rawrrr ... The sheer thought

of big hunks of sizzling meat and

steaming veggies sandwiched

together on a big stick (and per

haps the imaginary hottie man

ning my imaginary grill) brings

out this one's inner tigress. Get
carnal by cooking in the nude

and feeding each other each

savory bite.
