HOW TO

make a really cheap, but
really cool picture gift! Did
we mention it was free ?

Start with a picture you want to "frame."
Cut a piece of cardboard, leaving approxi
mately 1/4 inch extra around the photo.

Use a colorful piece of tissue or wrapping
or even newspaper and cover the cardboard
like you would a gift. Secure with glue or
clear tape.

Attach your photo to the front with tape or
glue. If you use the sticky stuff, make sure
to smooth out the paper so it doesn't crin
kle as it dries. Repeat steps I-3 f° r your
desired amount of pictures.

Hang your photos with colorful string,
ribbon or other crafty material. We rolled
strips of tissue paper to create this nifty
wall decoration. Voila!
