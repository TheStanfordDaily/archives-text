## editors' note 
### 
The new year is upon us, and
we have a lot to reflect on. It's
been a huge political year: a pri
mary season full of firsts, an his
toric presidential election, a heat
ed battle over Prop. 8 here in
California. There could not be a
more appropriate time for the
release of "Milk," a star-laced film
about Harvey Milk, the first openly
gay politician. Released last week,
"Milk" is receiving wide praise (see
our review on page nine) and has
been labeled a "call to action" for
the next great civil rights move
ment. The next year will surely tell

the direction of this important
issue and this important film —
we're guessing it will receive more
than a few Qscar nods.
On a lighter note, there are
many changes in the celebrity
scene as we head into '09: Kanye
West's new album (reviewed on
page 10) is uncharacteristically
dark, setting an unexpected stage
for the artist in the coming
months; and Britney Spears is
attempting to make a comeback
with the release of her new album,
"Circus," and MTV documentary
(page 11).

Back on campus, things go on
as usual. Cantor continues its
"Celebration Year" with the open
ing of a new exhibit on African art
(page 12) and Stanford welcomes
new face Dr. Daniel Levitin as a vis
iting professor in Humßio this win
ter (page five). We at The Stanford
Daily will move to our new building
near Old Union over the next cou
ple weeks — this is our last issue
ever to be produced in Storke.
Happy Dead Week, finals and
winter break. We'll see you in ohhh
nine!
