# Even sugar cookies can't sweeten up Dead Week
## 
### 
When I think of the term "Dead Week," I think of
two things: death and time. Admittedly, death and
time are never far from my mind to begin with. I
have all sorts of questions about them. Things like, "When
will I die?" and "Will today be the day that I die?" and "Wait,
is today Tuesday? What time is it?" Because of this, I've
earned a reputation for being exceptionally dark and brood
ing, which is awesome because women dig that stuff.
However, I have also received a very low section grade due to
my perpetual lateness, and that means that I really have to
shine on the final. Man, I need to study like crazy!
Now you must be thinking, "Wow, it must be hard for
someone so dark and brooding to deal with the stress of
Dead Week." Well, you're not wrong. All this studying for
finals completely wrecks me. 1 get anxious and stir-crazy. I
skip meals and then binge eat. I stop giving hi-fives altogeth
er. If things get really bad, I start getting nosebleeds and an
eye twitch that totally counteract the chick-magnetism of my
darkness and brooditude. Let me tell you. It is Lame City, the
capital of Too-Much-Workistan.
It doesn't help that this year my advent calendar starts
the first day of Dead Week. For those of you not fortunate
enough to celebrate the non-religious, über-commercial holi
day that my household calls "Christmas," an advent calendar
is just like a regular calendar, except that it starts on Dec. 1
and ends Dec. 25. Fach day is represented by a little flap or
door, and behind this is some kind of prize. As a child, my
advent calendars typically contained cheap milk chocolate. I

would eagerly rush downstairs to breakfast every morning so
that I could open that day's door and consume my treat. This
year, I am pretty sure that my advent calendar has been
stuffed with assignment due dates.
This sucks, because the whole "holiday season" thing is
usually what gets me through these tough times. I use the
holidays as a distraction. I love to put on a sweatshirt, walk
outside into the wintry Palo Alto air and pretend to shiver
like I've seen them do in the movies. I bake cookies. I drink
Coca-Cola and pretend that I am a polar bear. And even
though I do all of these things year-round, there is something
about December that makes them feel particularly special.
The last thing 1 want to think about is work.
But I realize now that what is really going to get me
through these last two weeks of the quarter — a quarter that
has honestly been exceptionally difficult for me — is not the
sweatshirts or the cookies or the pre-diabetic bears. It's the
magical sense of togetherness that comes with this season. We
arc all going to be stressed out in these next few days, but we
can find solidarity and support in each other. Someone is
always going to be there when you need a hug or a laugh or a
cry. Drop the dark and brooding act and try carrying mistle
toe. Trust me, it's like Full Moon on the Quad all over again.
Fa la la la la, la la la la.
