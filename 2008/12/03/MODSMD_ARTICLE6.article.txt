# "A Whole New World Inside"

FROM THE DESK OF

As one of the most popular memoirs of
recent years, Elizabeth Gilbert's "Eat,
Pray, Love" probably tells us more
about society at large than it does about her.
Her life was the stereotypical dream — mar
ried with a successful career and a nice house
— and it became the stereotypical American
nightmare as she encountered uncertainty
about her desires and a crushing depression.
What makes Gilbert's story unusual is that
she ditches everything about her comfortable
life and goes on a quest to find herself. What
makes her story riveting is that she is more
or less successful.
While spending a year traversing the
globe is a fantasy for most of us (Gilbert tells
us hers was made possible by a forward on
the resulting book — I doubt many people
could land such an opportunity), it is a lin
gering cultural ideal. Backpacking around
Europe is almost a synonym for carefree
young adulthood. The travel industry is
huge; walk into Stanford's bookstore and if

you slightly overshoot the stairs down to
textbooks, you will find shelf after shelf of
books offering advice on how to see the
world, and what to see in it.
So why is it so notable when somebody
does just that? What makes Gilbert's travels
so poignant is not that she gives herself a
year to see the world. It's that she gives herself
a year ... to see the world. She is in fact woe
fully inefficient at "seeing the world" from a
tourist checklist standpoint. During her stay
in India there is a critical point where she
forgoes her plans to tour the rest of the sub
continent in order to remain with a religious
community in a small, isolated town.
Great, she found herself. But what is this
"finding oneself" that we are so enthralled
by? More to the point, if it fascinates us so
much, why is it so rare? When 1 transitioned
back to campus after a summer of working
25 hours a week and seeing friends perhaps
twice a month, I began using the phrase
almost in self-defense. "What else did you
do?" was a surprisingly frequent follow-up to
"1 worked part-time on campus."
True, I slept more than 1 usually do, but
I don't think averaging nine hours a night is
so wrong. And the other suspected culprits
— email, Facebook, TV, movies ... I actually
spent less time on than I do when at school. I

barely even watched the Olympics, and I
could count the number of movies 1 watched
on two hands.
What I did do was start studying French.
I returned to Chinese and German. I read a
lot of books. 1 explored San Jose, Santa Clara,
Mountain View and Sunnyvale, largely by

simply wandering around. I worked on short
stories, mailing a few off. I even made it up
to San Francisco, to visit the DeYoung and
explore Golden Gate Park, savor a Ghirardelli
sundae and just walk the streets of the city
that brought me to the West Coast in the first
place.
I did the sorts of things I always tell
myself I will do if I have time, and of course
never give myself time to do. It was, in short,
an amazing time, and a far cry from unpro
ductive. When I even think of the word
"unproductive," I now cringe. We all got to
Stanford by being extremely driven people.
What does it even mean to be productive? As
the saying goes, it doesn't matter how fast
you're going or how good you're looking if
you're headed in the wrong direction.
College is meant to be a cushy environ
ment to aid us in the process of figuring out
what we want to do with our lives. And while
classes and activities certainly help that
process, in the end, we can't make any deci
sions for ourselves if we don't give ourselves
time to think through what we actually want.
Although, perhaps, that time should not
be finals week.
