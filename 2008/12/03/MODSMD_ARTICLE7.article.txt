## Q&A with writer Dustin Abraham 
### 
Trailing forensic scientists as they
uncover criminals in Las Vegas and
showing badass science demonstra
tions along the way, "CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation" is now in its ninth season on
CBS. Produced by Kim Steinhoff and Jerry
Bruckheimer, the show was originally created
by Anthony Zuiker in 2000 and rose to
acclaim by 2002, when it was named the
most-watched show on American television.
Since then, audiences have followed faithfully
through "CSI: Miami" and "CSI: New York"
in 2002 and 2004, respectively. But there will
always be a place in my heart for the show set
in Las Vegas, bubbling with outrageous char
acters in a surreal city.
I spoke with Dustin Abraham, writer for
"CSI." Among his many accomplishments, he
is one of the masterminds behind an early
stoner movie, "How High" (2001). Directed
by Jesse Dylan, this film follows two guys
who smoke something unusual and find
themselves mixed up in the Ivy League and
magical mystery.
Abraham, a personable and down-to
earth dude, talked with Intermission about
his writing, his history, his inspirations and,
of course, "CSI."
intermission: You write for "CSI" set in Las
Vegas. What do you like about it?
Dustin Abraham: The thing I really like
about Las Vegas is, we're Sin City. I really do
believe that Vegas has a little more of a dan
ger element that any other city in the coun
try, just for the fact that we're open 24 hours.
We have more drugs than everybody.
Prostitution is semi-legal. There's things to

do for people that arc doing drugs. And peo
ple come from all over the country to let
loose. There's always going to be murders
and crime in Las Vegas, so I think this show
will he going for a long time.
i: Do you do research for the science aspect
of the story? How does that work?
DA: I'll come up with scenarios and then we
have two guys here, Larry Mitchcl and Mitch
Caneloni [whol both were CSls. I'll just tell
them what I wanna do, you know. Like, for
this episode "Snakes," I wanna find a head in
a newspaper dispenser, in a box when you
open up the newspaper. So, they'll give me
forensics on how to track that back to the
body. So we definitely have guys here that
help us with that. I mean, a lot of us writers
come from storytelling roots. You wanna
think scientifically, but some of the writers
don't. I'm not that big on thinking scientifi
cally.
i: Has anything crazy ever happened on set?
DA: Not really crazy. A couple of months
ago, we didn't let it happen, but Sasha Baron-
Cohen wanted to come on our set as his
Bruno character and be a dead body. But we
were scared that he was just going to make
fun of us. So we were like, "No, we can't let
him do that. We'll end up in a movie, and
he'll end up completely messing with us and
we'll have to sue the guy." But we have tight
security on our set. The craziest stuff that
happens on set is what we've put in our sto
ries.
i: What's the most gruesome scene you've
ever written?
DA: I think [in) "Fannysmackin" where these
kids beat up these people. I mean, it was a
gang beating and they beat these people to a
pulp. And I remember on the autopsy table
they had to actually skin this guy. So on the
autopsy table he had no skin on, no skin on
his face. I don't know if you've ever seen a

person with the eyeballs still in place with no
skin on their face. But it looks really ... I
think that's the most gruesome that I've ever
seen a body on our show . ..
Before you work here, they make you go
to the coroner and see this stuff for real. And
it's not the look of it. I've been in an autopsy
room, where we're cutting up these bodies
and to me, it's not the visual that bothers me,
it's the smell. The smell really bothers me,
and I try to get the hell out of there as fast as
1 can.
i: L)o you have a favorite character? One you
like writing for?
AD: 1 like writing for George Bads, Nick.
That dude's gonna get an Emmy some day.
He brings an intensity and he cares so much
about his character and he'll do stuff that
everyone else can't do. I always [like to write]
where he's the main guy — like with
"Snakes" with the Mexicans and narcocorrido.
I just like pulling him into a world and let
ting him go off into it.
i: What's the difference between writing a
movie and writing a TV show? Which do you
like better?
AD: In TV, when you pitch a TV show, that
thing has got to be written in two weeks, and
they're shooting in three weeks. So it's com
pletely — it's like a race. And a movie, it's
more like, chill out.
They're equally as hard, they're just a
different animal. I'm a spaz, so the TV thing
works for me. And I do love the movies, too.
There's nothing like going to a movie. Going
to one that's not yours and seeing your pre
view come on. I mean, that's just like the
coolest feeling ever.
i: Where do you get your ideas from?
AD: They actually come from everywhere.
They can come from a newspaper article,
they can come from online, they can come
from thin air, you know. And (those 1 ideas

really end up becoming the ones you use.
[In j this episode, "Poppin' Tags," I did a
hip-hop episode. I knew I wanted to do
something on the MAGIC show in Las Vegas
— the men's apparel show. And whenever
that's in town, Las Vegas has a lot of rappers
in town. So I was like, "You know what, that's
a great world." And then I combined it with
this other story. The guys from "Girls Gone
Wild," where he was almost raped; some guys
made him put on a bikini so I just combo-ed
that.. .
Some people like to start from a charac
ter, and that's probably the best way to write,
you know. A movie should always start from
character and the character brings you into
that world. But I tend to find the world and
then create a character that will create the
most conflict in that world.
And finding emotional closure. These
crime scene investigators go out there and
find the killer for these people or these par
ents and they do, in real life, go into different
worlds all the time. They might have a crime
scene in a nightclub one night and might be
in the middle of the dessert with a bunch of
meth heads another time.
i: If you had to choose a way to die, what
would it be?
AD: I probably want somebody to either
push me off a building or inject me with
something. I don't want to die by fire or
drowning. Those two, just leave those two
out. I don't want my throat slit either. 1 don't
think I'd want to be stabbed to death. I'd take
a gun to the head. You can shoot me in the
head. Get the right spot.
