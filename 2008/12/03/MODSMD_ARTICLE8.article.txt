# The 						Psychology of Music 101
## New HumBio class from visiting Prof. Daniel Levitin looks promising 
### 
Dr. Daniel Levitin, a
former Stanford under
grad, rock star and record
producer — not to mention best
selling author — makes his return
to Stanford this winter with a new
course titled "Biology, Psychology,
and Evolution of Music in
112 lumans." Levitin currently directs
the Laboratory for Music
Perception, Cognition and
Expertise, but is more likely known
as the bestselling author of the
popularly acclaimed "This is Your
Brain on Music."
Levitin's winter course will be
based on of his second book, "The
World in Six Songs," which was
released in August. Although he has
been teaching cognitive psychology
for 10 years, this is his first class
taught by Levitin to exclusively
focus on this topic.
Levitin's ideas are both original
and somewhat controversial; in his
new book, he argues that "these
particular six categories of songs..

[help] us to

understand the role

that music played throughout the
evolutionary history of humans
and the formation of society build
ing" — positing, in essence, that
"music has played an underappre
ciated role in the history of
humankind."
First arriving at Stanford in
1974, Levitin studied both music
and psychology as an undergrad
before leaving prematurely to pur
sue a career in the recording indus
try. During his 15-year hiatus,
Levitin held executive positions at
Sony Records, as well as produced
albums for the likes of Stevie
Wonder. He was awarded over 14
gold and platinum records and two
of his projects received Oscar nom
inations.
Levitin returned to Stanford in
1990 to finish his bachelor's degree
so he could continue on to gradu
ate school. He recounted that for
mer President Donald Kennedy, a
previous professor of Levitin's, "did

a double take when he saw [him]
marching [at graduation] so many
years later."
Having earned a Ph.D. in cog-

nitive psychology from the
University of Oregon, Levitin has
taught at Stanford for over 10
years. He continues to play tenor
saxophone, guitar and bass, has
performed with everyone from
Rodney Crowell to Mel Torme to
David Byrne, and he recently per
formed with Sting over the sum
mer.
Intermission interviewed
Levitin about his research, his ideas
and his own musical prowess.
Below are a few excerpts from the
conversation:
intermission (i): When did you
start writing your latest book?
Daniel Levitin (DL): In a sense, 1
began it in 1997 after [Steven]
Pinker said that music was just
auditory cheesecake ... [but] the
actual writing of the book took
about eight months; the rewriting
took about a year and a half. The
version that was printed was draft
No. 51.
i: What do you think accounts for
difference in musical taste?
DL: It's certainly multi-dimension
al... We choose our music as a
form of social identity [and]
change these affiliative bonds

sometimes over the course of the
teenage years ... However, it's
unlikely that someone raised here
on Western tonal music would
develop a preference for Chinese
opera. Since all Western tonal
music — classical, hip-hop, jazz,
rock, etc — is all based on the same
twelve notes, their brain wouldn't
have knowledge of the new tonal
structures.
i: Why do songs get stuck in our
head?
DL: One thing you could say is
maybe they get stuck there because
they're meant to. Maybe evolution
hit upon songs because they're
more efficient. It points to the pos
sibility that they are a reliable
information-bearing medium. The
other thing is that, from what we
know about it, it just doesn't hap
pen indiscriminately. It tends to
happen when people are lonely or
stressed, perhaps when the brain is
tiying to comfort the individual
(though unsuccessfully).
i: What is your favorite perform
ance moment (for yourself)?
DL: There are a lot of memorable
ones .. . [One is] playing as a per
cussionist with the Alea2 music
ensemble when I was a student at
Stanford ... As part of my training
there, I had to learn a different
instrument than I normally played.

To play a new instrument and to be
a part of the premiere of a new
musical performance ... really took
me out of myself.
[Also], I played with Bobby
McFerrin over the summer, and 1
don't think I've ever played with
such a generous musician ... [and]
with someone who spent so much
time thinking about what the other
person was playing and reacting to
it.
i: Do you have perfect pitch?
DL: No — but it's actually not clear
that it's an advantage ... right now
we're doing some work on absolute
pitch and the understanding and
representation of melody.
i:What's another project that you
are currently exploring in your lab?
DL:The nature of musical experi
ence among individuals with
autism ... but currently there are
about 15 projects going on in the
lab.
Levitin's class, "Humßio 188:
Biology, Psychology, and Evolution
of Music in Humans," will be
Wednesday and Friday, 1:15-3:05
p.m., during winter quarter.
