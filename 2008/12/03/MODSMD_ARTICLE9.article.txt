The History of
Love
NICOLE KRAUSS
this novel uses a book - wit hin-a -
hook plotline to craft a story of
loss, longing and love.

Novelist and Stanford alumna Nicole
Krauss '96 recently received the 2008
William Saroyan International Prize
for Writing for her 2005 novel "The History
of Love." The award, created to honor
Pulitzer and Academy Award-winning writer
William Saroyan, was established to encour
age emerging writers. Krauss nabbed this
year's fiction prize and $12,500 bonus out of
more than 230 qualified entries.
"The History of Love" owes its themes
and styles to a whole used bookstore's worth

of literary legends. There is magical realism
by way of Borges and Marquez, Modernist
reflexivity by way of Calvino and Beckett,
Jewish realism by way of Bruno Schulz and
Isaac Babel. The literary winking runs Palin
thick throughout.
In honor of these greats, Krauss has out
lined an epic with a plethora of plot twists
and no fewer than four narrators. There is
Leo Gursky, an old Jewish locksmith who sits
around his New York apartment reminiscing
about his first and only love, Alma. Alma had
left Poland for the U.S. during the war, and
before Leo could join her there, she'd mar
ried another man. By that time, Leo had
written a book about her, itself called "The
History of Love," which was subsequently
stolen by a certain Zvi Litvinoff, another of
Krauss* novelist-protagonists, who published
it in Spanish under his own name.
Back in the present, Alma, a 14-year-old
girl named after every woman in the novel
within-a-novel, is trying to track down the
books actual author. Alma's brother, Bird, is

the most superfluous of the novel's narrators.
He believes himself to be a lamed vovnik,
one of the 36 righteous ones without whom,
according to the Talmud, the world would
end. This is ironic, as his presence in the
novel accomplishes exactly nothing.
If all of this sounds a little convoluted
for a 250-page book, it is. However, by the
end, the plots do come together satisfyingly,
in an alternating-page pas de deux between
the young Alma and Leo, who finally meet in
Central Park.
It is these two characters who give the
book some of its best moments. Leo is a
philosophical octogenarian, whimsical only
to the point of pathos, not ridiculousness.
Young Alma, Krauss' finest creation, nimbly
dodges the literary cliche of the whiz kid.
While intelligent enough, she moves through
the world with clumsy self-consciousness.
Plot twists fall into her lap as often as they
are turned up by her sleuthing, which makes
her quest to track down the author of "The
History of Love" believably haphazard.

But problems arise when we are finally given
a glimpse of that book itself.
The few chapters of the novel-within
the-novcl that we're allowed to see read like
the pages of "Invisible Cities" that Italo
Calvino left crumpled up on the tloor
beneath his desk. Each one provides a pat lit
tle metaphor for Gursky's love, sugarcoated
with magical realism. Most problematically,
there is no way that an entire book of these
fragments would be remotely plausible, as
each one is only a couple pages long, without
any narrative drive. Krauss hopes that by
forcing her characters to perpetually extol the
wonders of the book, we'll have no choice
but to find it brilliant. She would have been
much better off leaving it to our imagina
tions.
"The History of Love" — by which I
mean Krauss' novel, now — fails as metafic
tion for exactly this reason. The greatest
books in this vein — "If on a Winter's Night
a Traveler," "Cloud Adas," "Don
Quixote," "Slaughterhouse Five" — are all about the powers and dangers of imagination. But "The History of
Love" has different themes: loss, longing, love.
This is a novel of heartbreak, not of the power of storytelling— not to say there's anything wrong with a
novel of heartbreak. "The History of Love" provides a convincing and sympathetic cast of characters; I only wish
all the writing and writers hadn't crowded them so much.
