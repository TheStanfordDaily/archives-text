PAST HUMAN ENVIRONMENTS
Sk "Interested in sustainability, global change, and environmental policy? Why not start with past
S£> environmental crises? Archaeology has a unique perspective on human interactions with the
M environment over the long term, and the relevance of past lessons to contemporary problems has
never been more apparent. This course focuses on the perspectives, methods, and data that
oS archaeology can bring to such discussion."
ANTHRO 105/205
ANCIENT CITIES IN THE NEW WORLD
Did the movie Apocalypto pique your interest in the ancient civilizations of the New World?
SS Want to know what these people were really like? Here is a course that will help you find out!!
For the first time, most of the world's population now lives in cities, and understanding urban ways
of life has become a crucial research problem in all fields of social science, including anthropology
and archaeology. The ancient civilizations of Mesoamerica and South America~the Aztec, Inca,
Maya, and other peoples-built and lived in what were some of the biggest and most important cities
in the world in their day. This course examines key issues of urbanism using the ruins of these great SB
cities, and the discipline of archaeology, as the main points of entry.
ANTHRO 126 A
8| COMING OF AGE: YOUTH, POWER, AND PUBLIC CULTURE IN THE MIDDLE EAST
This course explores the afterlives of the Utopian socialist project. At the beginning of the twentieth
century, the Soviet Union appeared to be the site of experimentation where avant-garde architects
and planners could realize their visions for democratic and egalitarian cities. Students will learn how
these ideas were implemented, compromised or modified from the perspectives of both
administrators, and those who inhabited these spaces. Our objective is to investigate how the
socialist legacy of built urban environments has shaped and conditioned the ways in which post
socialist societies are remade under the terms of a market economy. Course materials include
academic scholarship and visual media such as film, photography, video, as well as Internet blogs.
ANTHRO 127 A (Same as MUSIC 152)
ANTHROPOLOGY OF SOUND, IDENTITY, AND PLACE
Sj£ What role does sound play in our experience of "culture"? How do sounds affect our senses of place 5k
and self? How can we examine sound, noise and silence cross-culturally? In this new course,
students will study and conduct ethnographic work in and through the medium of SOUND and
ok figure out what is involved in the process of documenting, representing, and interpreting music,
oS noise, environmental soundscapes, etc. Case study soundscapes will include Tibet, the New Guinea JSS
rainforest, South Africa, bells, and urban Ghana, among others. Course requirements include:
fieldtrips, listening journal, midterm, field recordings and a final project of your own design. ru
Enrollment limited. No prerequisites.
