### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
Irish president Mary McAleese
spoke at Arrillaga Alumni Center on
Dec. 12 as part of a breakfast hosted by
the Palo Alto-based Enterprise Ireland.
ITie event, which celebrated the
business connections between Ireland
and Silicon Valley, was attended prima
rily by tech executives and Irish entre
preneurs. professionals and immigrants.
University President John
Hennessy introduced President
McAleese, who in turn noted
I lennessy's own Irish roots.
"When Ireland's Hennessy clan
scattered, they clearly took with them
formidable brain-power." McAleese
said, "and il is a matter of great Irish
pride that a I lennessy heads up such a
prestigious institution as Stanford
University."
The Irish president emphasized the
positive aspects of the US-Ireland

business relationship, noting that both
countries benefit from such a relation
ship.
"The internationalization of our
business depends upon such networks,
and what is good for Ireland is also
good for the United States." she said.
"Many people know how vital U.S.
investment in Ireland has been to our
prosperity and how it has created some
jobs." McAleese added. "Less
well-known, though of great impor
tance. is the fact that, thanks to
Enterprise Ireland, there are over 2(X)
Irish companies in the U.S. employing
82.(XX) U.S. citizens."
President McAleese also drew a
comparison between her country and
the University. At Stanford, "the blend
of education and innovation trans
formed the orchards and suburban
garages of this area into a phenomenal
centre of global entrepreneurialism."
Likewise, she added. Ireland has uti
lized creativity and risk-taking to cast

off its poor and under-achieving past to
re-invent itself as a successful, open,
technologically advanced economy.
"It is that same ambition that per
meates the business ties between
Silicon Valley and- Ireland." McAleese
said.
The President also reassured the
audience that Ireland's economy would
survive the current turmoil.
"In these tough economic times, we
are not paralyzed by self-doubt or over
whelmed by the scale of the global
financial problems." she said. "We are
too busy, like you. looking for solutions
through the partnerships and collabo
rations."
President McAleese's stop at
Stanford was a part of a week-long trip
meant to strengthen trade, business and
cultural links between America and
Ireland.
