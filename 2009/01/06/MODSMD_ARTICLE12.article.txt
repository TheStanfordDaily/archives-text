The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) approved various budgets at
its Dec. 3 meeting,hosted representa
tives from Stanford Housing and dis
cussed other miscellaneous subjects.
Roger Whitney, executive director
of Student Housing, and Jessica
Engelson, manager of Graduate
Housing Assignments, were present
to explain the three rounds of hous
ing assignments that occur in May of
each year.
They fielded a wide variety of
questions covering the lottery
process, reassignment procedures,
disability arrangements, the off-cam
pus subsidized housing program and
the new Munger building.
According to the two administra
tors, all of the living rooms in
Blackwelder and approximately a
fourth of those in Quillen will be
made into bedrooms, converting the
units into two-room efficiencies.
Both Blackwelder and Quillen are
high rises located in Escondido
Village.

The rates for the Munger resi
dences are projected to take a premi
um in comparison to other graduate
housing options on campus, but they
will still include furnishings and utili
ties, and feature larger room capaci
ties. In general, however, overall rent
increases for graduate housing this
coming year will be less than increas
es from the last few years.
Also during the meeting, the GSC
granted the Mexican Students
Association $2.<545 in funding for
assorted cultural and academic
events, particularly providing talks
with the Mexican consulate along
with conferences featuring Mexican
researchers and government officials.
GSC members also approved
funding the Romanian Student
Association $4(K) for both food and
logistical costs to hold a celebration
party for the Romanian National
Day.
Stanford Comedy Club also pre
sented a funding request at the meet
ing, asking for $1,5(X) to finance its
year-end comedy event, which is slat
ed to feature three comedians and a
hypnotist.

llie GSC concluded the meeting
with a long dialogue about whether
to maintain a "Big Events" line item
in its budgetary provisions. 'ITiis dis
cretionary category was. in the eyes
of some, being taken advantage of by
several groups as a means to fund
poorly budgeted events. Many mem
bers believed the category was unfair
and unclear, and the council voted by
consensus to strike the line item from
its funding policies.
Members also agreed that the
multi-group line item — also known
as co-sponsorship — should be
increased from $ 1 (),(K)() to $2().(KK). as
the former amount has proven to be
insufficient.
It was also determined that no
clear set of criteria should be utilized
to settle which budget requests will
have access to this line item and
which should ultimately be granted
it. Both levels of approval will contin
ue to be left to the GSC funding com
mittee and the GSC voting members,
respectively.
