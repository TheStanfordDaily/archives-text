## Gaza civilian toll rises; diplomats seek truce 
### IBRAHIM BARZAK JASON KEYSER THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
GAZA CITY, C.aza — Israel
ignored mounting international
calls for a cease-fire and said it
won't stop its crippling 10-day
assault until "peace and tranquili
ty" are achieved in southern Israeli
towns in the line of Palestinian
rocket fire.
Israeli forces seized control of
high-rise buildings Monday and
attacked smuggling tunnels and
several mosques in a relentless
campaign against Hamas militants
that took an increasing toll on

civilians. The United Nations said
at least 500 people have died in the
Gaza fighting, about a quarter of
them civilians.
In fighting that raged early
Tuesday morning, at least 18 peo
ple were killed in shelling up and
down the strip, local hospital offi
cials said. Only two could he
immediately confirmed as mili
tants.
Israel also suffered casualties.
Late Monday, three Israeli soldiers
were killed by what Israeli officials
said was an errant tank round from
one of its own guns.
Shortly after sunrise Tuesday,
three rockets fired from Gaza fell
in southern Israel, hut there were
no reported casualties.
Arab delegates met with the
U.N. Security Council in New
York, urging members to adopt a
resolution calling for an immedi
ate end to the attacks and a per
manent cease-fire. At the same
time, diplomats and European
leaders traveled the region in an
effort to stop Israel's expanding
ground and air offensive.
In a serious urban clash. Israeli
troops and Hamas militants fought
a gunbattle on the outskirts of the
crowded Ga/a City neighborhood
of Shajaiyeh. Israeli defense offi
cials said. Details also emerged of
an unsuccessful attempt by Hamas
fighters to capture Israeli soldiers
hours after the ground operation
began Saturday with a withering
round of artillery fire.
Military spokesman Brig. Gen.
Avi Benayahu told Israeli TV the
assault was going according to
plan with forces sweeping through
Palestinian rocket launching loca
tions near the border.
Despite Israeli claims that
casualties have been heavy among
militants, no injured Hamas fight
ers were seen Monday by an
Associated Press reporter at Shi fa
Hospital, the Gaza Strip's largest.
Instead, the hospital was over
whelmed with civilians. Bodies
were two to a morgue drawer, and
the wounded were being treated in
hallways because beds were full.
At least 20 Palestinian children
were killed during the day
Monday, said Dr. Moaiya
Hassanain, a health official. Most
confirmed deaths have been civil
ians.
Three brothers died in an
attack on a town outside Gaza
City, a Gaza health official said.
They were carried to a cemetery in
an emotional funeral. One of
them, Issa Samouni, 3. was
wrapped in a white cloth, showing
only his pale, yellow face. A man
delicately placed him in a dark
grave cut into the earth.
Overnight, six civilians were
killed when a shell fired by an
Israeli ship hit their house on the
Gaza shore, hospital officials said.

Local residents said the gunboat
apparently fired at a group of
Islamic Jihad militants next to the
house who were preparing to
ambush advancing Israeli troops.
Two of the militants were killed in
the blast.
Palestinians said Israeli attacks
intensified before dawn Tuesday
and at least 10 more civilians were
killed when shells hit houses on
the edge of Gaza City and in the
Jebaliya refugee camp, north of
the city.
Later, five civilians were killed
when a shell fired by an Israeli
ship hit their house on the Gaza
shore, hospital officials said.
Palestinians said Israeli attacks
intensified before dawn Tuesday.
Gaza health officials reported
that since the campaign began on
Dec. 27 more than 550 Palestinians
have been killed and 2,500 wound
ed, including 200 civilians. U.N.
humanitarian chief John Holmes
put the Palestinian toil at 500, with
about 125 of them civilians.
Holmes called the Gaza strife
an "increasingly alarming"
humanitarian crisis, directly con
tradicting Israeli denials that its
offensive caused the growing
problem. He said Gaza is running
low on clean water, power, food,
medicine and other supplies since
Israel began its offensive. Israeli
leaders have maintained there is
no humanitarian crisis, and that
they have been delivering vital
supplies.
Late Monday, the Israeli mili
tary said three soldiers were killed
and 24 others wounded by friend
ly fire when a tank shell hit their
position outside Gaza City. The
military said a colonel who com
manded an infantry brigade was
among the injured.
Israeli defense officials said
earlier that one soldier was killed
when soldiers fought off an
attempt by Hamas fighters to cap
ture Israeli soldiers hours after the
ground operation began.They said
the infantrymen were advancing
up a strategic hill before dawn
Sunday when militants emerged
from a tunnel and tried to drag
two Israeli infantrymen inside.
Hamas already holds one
Israeli soldier, captured in June
2006. and another would be an
important bargaining chip.
