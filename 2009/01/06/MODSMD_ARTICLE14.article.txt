## Editorial Stanford community must share budget burdens 
### 
Facing what Provost John Etchemendy
described as the "tightest financial out
look we have seen in decades," the I Uni
versity is about to make some painful deci
sions. Based on revised estimates of the health
of Stanford's investments and finances, the
administration now believes it may have to
cut the $S(K) million general funds budget by
up to $1(H) million over the next two years.
Fiverv member of the Stanford community
will have to share the burden in these lean
budgetary times, and we are pleased with
many of the University's efforts to ensure this.
For instance, the Provost has asked each unit
of the University for "budget reduction sce
narios" of five, seven and 10 percent. We be
lieve this is an important step to diffusing the
impact of Stanford's drastic budget cuts. Fur
thermore, such a step allows those best aware
of what programs are least necessary to make
cut suggestions, rather than higher-level and
less-connected administrators.
Layoffs, according to the Provost, are an
"unavoidable" result of the budget cuts. The
administration is already taking positive steps
to prevent extensive layoffs. Ilie University
may ask some employees to work fewer
hours, implement hiring freezes and develop a
retirement incentive program in order to min
imize outright layoffs.
Preventing as many layoffs as possible
should be a top priority of the budget cuts, and
these efforts will help prevent the burden
from falling on individuals whose livelihoods
depend on Stanford. As divisions recommend
budget cuts, they must remember that unde
sirable pay and programming cuts are still
preferable to throwing devoted employees
into the worst job market in history.
We are also proud that both Etchemendy
and President John Hennessy voluntarily
clipped their salaries by 10 percent, and that
each of the school's deans has also volun
teered to take a pay cut.These are commend
able efforts of top administrators to show that
they too will bear the burden of the economic
crisis, and we applaud all who made this deci
sion.
Still, this is one commendable effort that
alone will amount to a mere symbolic gesture.
The same day The Daily announced these
salary cuts, it published another article look
ing at the salaries of Stanford's highest-paid

employees CHarbaugh close to signing
deal"),several of whom earn twice as much as
1 lennessy. While we understand that many of
these employees receive such high pay to
keep them away from competing institutions,
we cannot refrain from pointing out that the
Provost's and President's pay cuts will only
amount to a drop in the bucket.
It Stanford hopes to diffuse the impact of
the economic crisis, those persons and divi
sions forced to make cutbacks will also have to
approach the budget cuts with an open mind.
We do not want the already-painful budget
cutting process to descend into a struggle be
tween departmental units lor dwindling gen
eral funds and precious construction priority.
Ilie editorial board feels that frequent and
substantial communication from the Provost
and other financial officers can be a powerful
antidote to this potential problem. Hennessy
and Etchemendy, in their Oct. 30 email to the
Stanford community addressing the financial
crisis, promised to keep in touch and inform
students and faculty about developments in
the budgetary process. In November, the edi
torial board lauded the email as a step in the
right direction towards greater community in
volvement in major decisions, and we now re
iterate our keen interest in hearing more from
the administration in the new year about the
upcoming decisions.
We do not propose that complicated and
painful budgetary choices should be put to an
up-or-down vote among Stanford students,
faculty and stall or that the administration
should lose its autonomy over the budget. In
stead, we suggest that better communication
and the solicitation of feedback can be assets
in diffusing the tension surrounding the budg
et cuts. Most importantly, those affected by
budget cuts are more likely to understand and
make the most necessary concessions it they
have direct input and involvement in the
process.
Ensuring that everyone shares fairly in this
sacrifice will be a I lerculean task for the
Provost and those who must manage the
budget,as they decide which programs should
be prioritized and which ones can afford the
steepest cuts. We have faith that under even
the most dire economic circumstances, people
at Stanford will look out for interests other
than their own.
