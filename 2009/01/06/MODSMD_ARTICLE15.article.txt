## The 						difference between discrimination and telling the truth about Prop. 8 
### 
A gay person's decision to come out of
the closet is difficult. An opponent of
gay marriage's decision to voice sup
port for an apartheid system of unequal rights
is apparently not difficult enough. As Allysia
Finley's error-ridden and offensive column in
The Daily's Dec. 3 issue demonstrated, gay
marriage opponents still think they have a le
gitimate argument (see "The Right Angle:
Prop. S opponents need to show tolerance").
It's time for them to realize they're wrong.
It's also time for them to stop drawing equiv
alencies between the oppression faced by the
queer community and intolerance they feel as
"out" bigots.
Finley's words and attitude are the frame
work for a culture that has denied gay people
basic civil rights and a sense of belonging for
years. Although Finley claims that gay people
"are not discriminated against in employment
and education," no federal protection against
discrimination exists for gay employees, and
30 states fail to include LGBT workers as a
protected class in nondiscrimination statutes.
Most companies enumerate a list of
groups they will protect regardless of state
laws. But guess which group is still absent
from the lists of 28 Fortune S(X) companies
despite several years of lobbying? I'll give
you a hint â€” this group of people can no
longer adopt kids in Arkansas, thanks to the
efforts of the same forces who passed Prop. 8
in California.
Obstacles to LGBT inclusion in education
are slightly more subtle because we take het
eronormativity for granted. I've worked in
LGBT rights since 11th grade, and I still make
mistakes. Before my house's special dinner
last year. I asked a new resident what "lucky
lady he'd be taking to our party. I felt like an
ignorant jerk when he responded with, "I'm
gay"
Forget malicious intent for a second. (lay
youth feel pressure to deny their sexuality be
cause the people around them innocently as

sume everyone's straight.Too many students
find something disgusting, uncomfortable, an
noying or stupid and label it "gay. not realiz
ing the associations they are creating. Even
well-meaning people at Stanford ignore,gloss
over or marginalize gay people's identities on
a daily basis. Those who deny the educational
challenges LGBT youth face are deluding
themselves.
When we factor in the overt prejudices and
discrimination gay people face, its no wonder
gay youth without supportive parents, peers
and teachers are far more likely to suffer from
depression and commit suicide than their
straight counterparts.
Despite these realities. Finley still wants to
compare her suffering as a Prop. <S supporter
to the suffering in the gay community.There is
a big difference, however, between the I .GBI
minority in the I Inited States and the anti-gay
marriage minority at our university.
One group is defined by sexual orienta
tion.a personal characteristic they force on no
one. The other group, the anti-gay marriage
faction, is defined by a public stance used to
deprive gays of equal treatment under the law
and maintain apartheid marriage in Califor
nia. I wish, as Finley contends in her article,
that views on gay marriage were "private be
liefs." But political donations and votes that
deprive people of legal benefits are about as
private as my disdain for Finley's column.
There is no non-bigoted reason to oppose
same-sex marriage. Arguments about defini
tions are thinly veiled disguises for the belief
that gay people are inferior in some way. You
can't coherently reason that you like gay peo
ple and believe in equal rights for Americans
but don't support gay marriage. At the federal
level, civil marriage guarantees couples 1,138
benefits. In most states, married couples re
ceive over I,(XX) additional benefits. Legisla
tion like Proposition N deprives gay people of
privileges guaranteed to other Amer
icans.
Calling a Prop. 8 supporter a bigot
is neither narrow-minded nor cruel.
It's the truth. I'd call a supporter of
Jim Crow laws, unequal pay for
women and the Nazis a racist, sexist
and anti-Semite, respectively. These
labels, far from being prejudicial, all
describe an evaluation of character
based on someone's behavior. Like
the fight for black equality was 40
years ago, gay marriage is a simple
question of civil rights. Until gay mar
riage opponents renounce the cruelty
they have inflicted on the LGBT
community, I will call their bigotry
what it is.
