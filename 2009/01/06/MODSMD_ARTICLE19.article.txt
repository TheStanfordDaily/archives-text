Stuart Baimel's latest column had a prom
ising title (see "Stu's Views: Starting a debate
about graduate and faculty diversity," in the
Dec. 3 issue of The Daily), yet the article
added little to the perennial student discus
sion concerning diversity efforts.
The article makes a completely unjusti
fied leap in concluding that four anonymous
quotes and 360 signatures on a (Jraduate Stu
dent Council petition supporting diversity ef
forts are a sign that "many students do not
support this initiative [to increase graduate
and faculty diversity]."
The petition never received an extensive
publicity campaign, a point well illustrated by
the fact that as of Jan.4,an additional 585 stu
dents had signed the petition in response to
Baimel's article, bringing the total to nearly a
thousand signatures. As signature No. 361, I
can attest that the most 1 had heard about the
petition was from Baimel's article itself.
The article further claims that many stu
dents are "uncomfortable" with diversity ini
tiatives, but afraid to speak up for fear of

being labeled racists. But what exactly is the
value of a "comfortable" debate about diver
sity initiatives? Efforts to increase diversity
deal with the thorny issues of privilege anil
systematic racism, the existence of which
should make us severely uncomfortable. A
debate about diversity that preserves the
comfort levels of all involved is a debate that
has glossed over underlying issues to the
point of irrelevance.
I would like to see The Stanford Daily
publish more op-eds on this subject â€” even
it those op-eds offend the fine sensibilities of
some students. Comfort is a small price to pay
for the goal of a meaningful debate.

In your article "Clean like heck and smell
like heaven" (Dec. 3, 2(M)8), chemical engi
neering lecturer Dr. John Moalli was quoted
as saying,"| while | there is a tremendous mar
ket opportunity for toxin-free products. con

sumer perception on what contains toxins is
often misguided ... For example, the alleged
toxin in baby bottles is bisphenol A. and all of
the most recent toxicological studies show
BPA to be benign, despite what some in the
press are writing."
Unfortunately, much of the public's mis
guided perception about the toxicity of prod
ucts stems from misleading statements such
as Dr. Moalli's. Several recent studies have
demonstrated evidence that bisphenol A
(BPA) is potentially harmful. One such study
published in the Journal of the American
Medical Association in October 2(H),S showed
a correlation between BPA concentration
and rates of diabetes, liver abnormalities and
heart disease. In another. September 2(H)S
study, the National Toxicology Program ex
pressed some concern that BPA may affect
the brain, prostrate and behavior of fetuses,
infants and small children.
