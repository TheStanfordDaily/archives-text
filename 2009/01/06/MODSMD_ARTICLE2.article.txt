## Students argue for extended pool hours Athletics department cites budgetary concerns amidst calls for expansion 
### LIZ STARK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Following a successful petition this fall to
move evening recreational swim hours back to
Avery Aquatic Center, the ASSU. the Graduate
Student Council (GSC) and Alex llirsch CiSB 10

continue to lobby the athletic department to
expand Stanford's swim hours. Though these
groups cite the importance of matching the
aquatic resources offered by peer schools, the
department has indicated that it is currently
unable to commit to increasing swim hours due
to budgetary concerns.
This fall. Stanford Athletics moved evening
swim hours from Avery to Roble after granting
an outside group access to Avery during those
hours. Concern arose, however, over Roble being
"a 25-yard, five-lane pool with less than a quarter
of the previous capacity." as the petition stated.

With more than 950 signatures on the peti
tion. evening swim hours returned to Avery on
Oct. 13. Yet. despite the administration's
response. I lirseh and many other signatories still
believe Stanford's swim offerings are insuffi
cient.
"The amount of swim time and space being
offered is inadequate." llirsch said. "We've col
lected an enormous amount of data comparing
Stanford to other institutions, and Stanford was
ranked last on everv list vou can imagine."

Swimmers play water polo at Avery Aquatic Center. Access to the center for faculty and student recreational swim has become a point of contention as stu
dents join up with the ASSU and the GSC to lobby for extended hours that equal those of similar universities.
