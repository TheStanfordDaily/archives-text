## Students argue for extended pool hours Athletics department cites budgetary concerns amidst calls for expansion 
### LIZ STARK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Following a successful petition this fall to
move evening recreational swim hours back to
Avery Aquatic Center, the ASSU. the Graduate
Student Council (GSC) and Alex llirsch CiSB 10

continue to lobby the athletic department to
expand Stanford's swim hours. Though these
groups cite the importance of matching the
aquatic resources offered by peer schools, the
department has indicated that it is currently
unable to commit to increasing swim hours due
to budgetary concerns.
This fall. Stanford Athletics moved evening
swim hours from Avery to Roble after granting
an outside group access to Avery during those
hours. Concern arose, however, over Roble being
"a 25-yard, five-lane pool with less than a quarter
of the previous capacity." as the petition stated.

With more than 950 signatures on the peti
tion. evening swim hours returned to Avery on
Oct. 13. Yet. despite the administration's
response. I lirseh and many other signatories still
believe Stanford's swim offerings are insuffi
cient.
"The amount of swim time and space being
offered is inadequate." llirsch said. "We've col
lected an enormous amount of data comparing
Stanford to other institutions, and Stanford was
ranked last on everv list vou can imagine."


AGUSTIN RAMIREZ/The Stanford Daily
Swimmers play water polo at Avery Aquatic Center. Access to the center for faculty and student recreational swim has become a point of contention as stu
dents join up with the ASSU and the GSC to lobby for extended hours that equal those of similar universities.
Currently, between the Avery
and Roble pools. Stanford offers
seven weekday hours of swim.
According to Hirsch. that number
is less than the hours offered at
every other top-10, Pac-I() and Big
10 school. MIT holds as many as 17
hours, and no Pac-10 school has
fewer than nine.
Stanford's total number of swim
hours has alternated between six
and seven since at least 2000.
I iirsch said.
This fall, two hours of recre
ational swim from 7 to 9 a.m. were
available at Roble Pool, but
Stanford has discontinued these
morning hours for winter quarter
due to underuse. Stanford is the
only school not to offer morning
swim hours.
As of now, Hirsch, along with
Shelly Gao '11 and psychology
graduate student Nanna Notthoff.
have met thrice with Avery Aquatic
Center Manager Rebecca

Carpenter and Senior Associate
Athletic Director Eric Stein. Gao
serves as deputy chair of the under
graduate senate, and Notthoff is
the financial officer for the gradu
ate student council (GSC).
"What we're advocating is offer
ing a full, 50-meter pool for recre
ational swim and extending
evening swim to three hours,"
I lirsch said.
According to Carpenter, the
most significant obstacle to adding
swim hours is the cost of staffing
the Avery facility.
"We're waiting to hear back
from the heads of the athletic
department," she said. "When you
propose this addition, it's hard to
add more money in when we're try
ing to cut back with the budget.
That's the biggest thing we're run
ning into."
Since the petition, the ASSU has
been active in advocating for
Hirsch.
"We think that it's really impor
tant to maximize access for
Stanford students," Gao said, "and
that this is really critical, particular
ly to the University's commitment
to promoting wellness."

Though no expansion of swim
hours is planned for winter quarter,
llirsch is still pushing for morning
swim hours. He added that varsity
teams do not use Avery pools
Tuesday and Thursday mornings
and that, on the days they do. prac
tices end by 8 a.m.
(iiven the number of swim hours
and space available, some swim
mers have reported crowded lanes
during available pool hours.
"At night. [Avery] is pretty
crowded, and they set up the pool
for the 25-meter length." said
Rachel Kalmar. a fifth-year gradu
ate student in neurology. "But it's
such a pleasure to swim in it when
it's the full Olympic length."
Both Hirsch and Gao have said
they are positive about the prospect
of expanding swim hours and space
in the coming year.
"I'm actually very optimistic
about this initiative." Gao said.
"Both sides recognize that these
changes need to be implemented in
the long term, and we are working
toward that gradually."
