## Jobs, with hormone imbalance, addresses health 
### DAWN C. CHMIELEWSKI JESSICA GUYNN THE LOS ANGELES TIMES 
SAN FRANCISCO — Apple
Inc. Chief Executive Steve Jobs broke
with his usual code of secrecy
Monday to explain his health prob
lems. but his admission that a hor
mone imbalance was causing his
noticeable weight loss probably will
do little to tamp down concerns about
his well-being.
Medical experts said that a hor
mone imbalance in a pancreatic can
cer survivor raises red flags about a
possible recurrence. Jobs said in 2(H)4
that he had undergone surgery to
treat a rare form of the disease.
Although Jobs. 53. is one of the
nation's most private corporate lead
ers, he issued an open letter Monday
in which he tried to assure Apple
investors and customers that he was
healthy enough to lead the tech com
pany he co-founded.
Jobs said his doctors discovered
his condition has been "robbing" his
body of proteins needed for good
nutrition. He is undergoing treat

ment, which he described as simple
and straightforward. He did not men
tion cancer in his letter.
"I've said more than 1 wanted to
say, and all that I am going to say,
about this," Jobs wrote.
Three medical experts, who had no
access to his patient records, said
problems other than cancer could
have caused his hormone imbalance.
For example, the surgery to remove
his tumor could have left Jobs with a
pancreas that's too small to produce
the necessary enzymes.
Yet hormonal imbalances are
common in people who have an
active neuroendocrine tumor, not in
people who have been cured of the
cancer, said Dr. Selwyn M. Vickers.
chairman of the department of sur
gery at the University of Minnesota.
An Apple spokesman declined to
comment. The board said it would
give Jobs its "complete and unwaver
ing support" while he recovered.
Jobs noted that he spent this holi
day season with his family, rather than
preparing for Tuesday's keynote
address at the annual Macworld
Conference & Expo. He'll miss the

speech for the first time since 1997. In
years past, he has used it to announce
such industry-changing products as
the iPhone and iTunes.
Jobs has been inextricably linked
to his company's fortunes since he
helped revive the Mac computer and
spurred a digital renaissance with the
iPod and iPhone. Jobs didn't do it
alone, hut continued anxiety over his
health suggests that the company has
yet to persuade investors or
Macolytes that Apple could survive
without him.
"Why is everybody obsessed with
Steve? 1 think the answer is very sim
ple." said Paul Saffo, a technology
forecaster who teaches at Stanford
University. "Apple has not yet con
vinced the world that Apple without
Steve will continue with the same
powerful vision."
Hie Cupertino, Calif., company's
announcement last month that Jobs
would not give the Macworld presen
tation triggered speculation that he
was gravely ill. At the time, Apple,
which is pulling out of the trade show
after this year, said his participation
"doesn't make sense."
In his letter. Jobs made light of the
"stories of me on my deathbed" and
said he would remain chief executive
while he recuperates. He said he
expects to regain his lost weight by
late spring.
"I will be the first one to step up
and tell our Board of Directors if I
can no longer continue to fulfill my
duties as Apple's CEO." Jobs wrote.
"I hope the Apple community will
support me in my recovery and know
that I will always put what is best for
Apple first."
Jobs began lookini* unusually thin

and drawn in June, when he intro
duced the latest generation of
iPhones. Investors called for him to
come clean about his health.
Bloomberg, the financial news
service, mistakenly published Jobs'
obituary in August. And a false
account on a CNN Web site claiming
Jobs had suffered a heart attack
caused Apple stock to plunge.
As recently as last week, the popu
lar technology blog Gizmodo citied a
source who claimed that Jobs' health
was "rapidly declining." Hie account
knocked Apple share prices down for
part of a day.
Patrick McGurn, special counsel
at shareholder advisory company
Risk Metrics Group, faulted Apple for
responding only when it was "clear
there would be a feeding frenzy."
"They can argue that they didn't
have a final diagnosis to point to and
a treatment regimen in place, and 1
can buy that to a degree." McGurn
said. "But the fact of the matter is that
there was a prior history here. This is
not the first time Apple has gone
through this drill. It should have just
bitten the bullet and announced it
would provide regular updates on
Steve Jobs' health because the com
pany knows the issue is important to
investors."
Investors heaved a sigh of relief.
Apple's shares gained $3.83 to $94.58.
"Lack of information is the worst
thing for investors," said Michael
Obuchowski. chief investment officer
of First Empire Asset Management
Inc., which holds Apple stock. "This
made Apple investors very happy."
Others reacted more cautiously.
"I am not doctor, but it certainly
doesn't give you the comfort that
nothing is wrong with him," said

Enhancement Group, which owns

duties as Apple's CEO." Jobs wrote.
"I hope the Apple community will
support me in my recovery and know
that I will always put what is best for
Apple first."
Jobs began lookini* unusually thin

and drawn in June, when he intro
duced the latest generation of
iPhones. Investors called for him to
come clean about his health.
Bloomberg, the financial news
service, mistakenly published Jobs'
obituary in August. And a false
account on a CNN Web site claiming
Jobs had suffered a heart attack
caused Apple stock to plunge.
As recently as last week, the popu
lar technology blog Gizmodo citied a
source who claimed that Jobs' health
was "rapidly declining." Hie account
knocked Apple share prices down for
part of a day.
Patrick McGurn, special counsel
at shareholder advisory company
Risk Metrics Group, faulted Apple for
responding only when it was "clear
there would be a feeding frenzy."
"They can argue that they didn't
have a final diagnosis to point to and
a treatment regimen in place, and 1
can buy that to a degree." McGurn
said. "But the fact of the matter is that
there was a prior history here. This is
not the first time Apple has gone
through this drill. It should have just
bitten the bullet and announced it
would provide regular updates on
Steve Jobs' health because the com
pany knows the issue is important to
investors."
Investors heaved a sigh of relief.
Apple's shares gained $3.83 to $94.58.
"Lack of information is the worst
thing for investors," said Michael
Obuchowski. chief investment officer
of First Empire Asset Management
Inc., which holds Apple stock. "This
made Apple investors very happy."
Others reacted more cautiously.
"I am not doctor, but it certainly
doesn't give you the comfort that
nothing is wrong with him," said
Adam Harter. an analyst at Financial
Enhancement Group, which owns
more than 30,000 shares.
As Jobs steps away from the spot
light. Apple is pushing other execu
tives forward to demonstrate that the
$32 billion company is more than a
one-man show. Philip Schiller,
Apple's senior vice president ol prod
uct marketing, is giving Tuesday's
kevnote.
