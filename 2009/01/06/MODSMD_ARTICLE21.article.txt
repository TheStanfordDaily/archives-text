## Card third at College Cup Women's soccer sets records but falls to Notre Dame in semis 
### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
Women's soccer's quest for its first-ever
NCAA title fell just short on Friday, as the team
lost 1-0 to Notre Dame in the College Cup semi
final in Cary. N.C. Despite the final score, it was
a game that the Cardinal dominated for large
stretches, hut in the end. luck was not on Stan
ford's side as it failed to advance against the
Irish.
"I feel like it was a tough game, a well-fought
game." Cardinal coach Paul Ratcliffe said in the
post-game press conference. "Notre Dame is a
very strong team, and I give them credit. In the
second half, 1 thought we came out very strong,
and we deserved more than the 1-0 loss. I
thought we created some good chances, and we
just couldn't break the ice. But overall I thought
it was a good game, a high-level game, and I'm
proud of my team's effort."
The first 10 minutes of the match were un

eventful, with Stanford content to feel out Irish
keeper Kelsey Lysander with long-range efforts
and Notre Dame not taking any shots. But the
Irish got the game's first big chance in the 13th
minute. 2006 NCAA Player of the Year Kerri
Hanks put fellow forward Melissa Henderson
clean through on goal, hut sophomore goal
keeper Kira Maker made a brilliant point-blank
save to keep the ball out.
Maker could do nothing two minutes later
though, when she again found herself in a one
on-one situation after Henderson had played in
Courtney Barg. who slotted the ball past her
diving grasp to give the Irish an early lead.
Henderson almost doubled the advantage in
the 21st minute. The forward found herself un
marked in the box on a Notre Dame free kick
but hit her volley just over the net. From that
point on. though, the game was dominated by
the Stanford women.
