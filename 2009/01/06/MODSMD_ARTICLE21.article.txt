## Card third at College Cup Women's soccer sets records but falls to Notre Dame in semis 
### SAM SVOBODA STAFF WRITER 
Women's soccer's quest for its first-ever
NCAA title fell just short on Friday, as the team
lost 1-0 to Notre Dame in the College Cup semi
final in Cary. N.C. Despite the final score, it was
a game that the Cardinal dominated for large
stretches, hut in the end. luck was not on Stan
ford's side as it failed to advance against the
Irish.
"I feel like it was a tough game, a well-fought
game." Cardinal coach Paul Ratcliffe said in the
post-game press conference. "Notre Dame is a
very strong team, and I give them credit. In the
second half, 1 thought we came out very strong,
and we deserved more than the 1-0 loss. I
thought we created some good chances, and we
just couldn't break the ice. But overall I thought
it was a good game, a high-level game, and I'm
proud of my team's effort."
The first 10 minutes of the match were un

eventful, with Stanford content to feel out Irish
keeper Kelsey Lysander with long-range efforts
and Notre Dame not taking any shots. But the
Irish got the game's first big chance in the 13th
minute. 2006 NCAA Player of the Year Kerri
Hanks put fellow forward Melissa Henderson
clean through on goal, hut sophomore goal
keeper Kira Maker made a brilliant point-blank
save to keep the ball out.
Maker could do nothing two minutes later
though, when she again found herself in a one
on-one situation after Henderson had played in
Courtney Barg. who slotted the ball past her
diving grasp to give the Irish an early lead.
Henderson almost doubled the advantage in
the 21st minute. The forward found herself un
marked in the box on a Notre Dame free kick
but hit her volley just over the net. From that
point on. though, the game was dominated by
the Stanford women.

Junior Kristin Stannard and the Cardinal attack out-shot the Irish 20-12, but lost to Notre Dame in the semifinals of the College Cup.
The Stanford women set school records for wins and goals scored in a single season.The entire front line returns next season.
One minute later, junior Kelley
O'Hara had the Card's first great
chance of the match. O'Hara outran
two defenders to get onto a long ball
by freshman Lindsay Taylor, but
saw her attempt to poke the ball be
tween Lysander's legs saved by the
Notre Dame keeper.
O'Hara was once again at the
center of the action in the 27th
minute, when she nutmegged her
defender on the left, passing the ball
between her opponent's legs, and
sent in a hard cross right to Christen
Press. But the sophomore's header
was right at Lysander.
Stanford would come close one
more time before halftime, with
freshman midfielder Cami Levin
hitting the crossbar on a chip from
outside the box in the 39th minute.
Although the Cardinal was down, it
certainly was not yet out.
The second half was almost com
pletely dominated by the Cardinal,
as the team went in search of the
crucial equalizer.
" The first half I thought we were
a little impatient in our build-up
play and we didn't get enough num

bers in the attack." Ratcliffe said.
"In the second half, we wanted to
get our outside backs involved in
the attack, and get our midfielders
more involved and maybe make
one or two more passes than we
were making in the first half."
Ten minutes into the half. Press
made a run down the right wing and
swung in a cross. Although the ball
was deflected. O'Hara rose high to
meet it, but could not get her head
er down on goal.
With 15 minutes remaining,
Stanford threw everything it had at
the Irish goal. First O'Hara once
again got her head on a cross, this
time from junior fullback Alicia
Jenkins, but could not get enough
power on the header to get it past
the keeper.
Then Stanford's other junior full
back. Ali Riley, worked her way
down the left flank and sent a cross
right to Taylor, who saw her header
saved. One minute later, senior de
fender Allison Fa Ik won a header off
a Taylor free kick, but once again the
shot went right at Lysander. No mat
ter who was shooting for the Cardi
nal, the results were the same, as the
Stanford women just couldn't quite
get the ball across the goal line.

GAME NOTES: The Stanford women footballers finished the 2008 season with o disappointing 1 -0
loss to Notre Dame in the semifinals of the College Cup. Notre Dame scored less than 15 min
utes into the contest, and although the Cardinal women controlled the ball for most of the game
thereafter, they could not manage a score. The frustrating end does little to cloud the amazing
accomplishments the Stanford squad achieved this year. The women finished with a record of
22-2-1, setting school records for wins and goals scored in a season. Stanford's only losses
came against UCLA and Notre Dame — both of whom also advanced to the Final Four - and
it tied the National Champion Tar Heels in the teams' only meeting. The Cardinal loses only two
starters to graduation and should compete for a national title again in 2009.

was Stanford's last shot of the
match — there would be no late

mined to keep the ball as far away
from their goal as possible and man
aged to hang on for the victory.
"It's been a spectacular season,
the team has played great soccer the
entire year and I'm proud of every
one of them." Ratcliffe said. "We're
happy to be in the Final Four, but we

really wanted to win the national

It was a frustrating end to what
was a fantastic season for the Cardi

not only made it to its first College
Cup in 15 years, hut did so while
playing some of the most exciting
soccer in the country. While their
season did not end with a trophy, the
women left Cary with the nation's

Women's soccer's quest for its first-ever
NCAA title fell just short on Friday, as the team
lost 1-0 to Notre Dame in the College Cup semi
final in Cary. N.C. Despite the final score, it was
a game that the Cardinal dominated for large
stretches, hut in the end. luck was not on Stan
ford's side as it failed to advance against the
Irish.
"I feel like it was a tough game, a well-fought
game." Cardinal coach Paul Ratcliffe said in the
post-game press conference. "Notre Dame is a
very strong team, and I give them credit. In the
second half, 1 thought we came out very strong,
and we deserved more than the 1-0 loss. I
thought we created some good chances, and we
just couldn't break the ice. But overall I thought
it was a good game, a high-level game, and I'm
proud of my team's effort."
The first 10 minutes of the match were un

eventful, with Stanford content to feel out Irish
keeper Kelsey Lysander with long-range efforts
and Notre Dame not taking any shots. But the
Irish got the game's first big chance in the 13th
minute. 2006 NCAA Player of the Year Kerri
Hanks put fellow forward Melissa Henderson
clean through on goal, hut sophomore goal
keeper Kira Maker made a brilliant point-blank
save to keep the ball out.
Maker could do nothing two minutes later
though, when she again found herself in a one
on-one situation after Henderson had played in
Courtney Barg. who slotted the ball past her
diving grasp to give the Irish an early lead.
Henderson almost doubled the advantage in
the 21st minute. The forward found herself un
marked in the box on a Notre Dame free kick
but hit her volley just over the net. From that
point on. though, the game was dominated by
the Stanford women.

Junior Kristin Stannard and the Cardinal attack out-shot the Irish 20-12, but lost to Notre Dame in the semifinals of the College Cup.
The Stanford women set school records for wins and goals scored in a single season.The entire front line returns next season.
One minute later, junior Kelley
O'Hara had the Card's first great
chance of the match. O'Hara outran
two defenders to get onto a long ball
by freshman Lindsay Taylor, but
saw her attempt to poke the ball be
tween Lysander's legs saved by the
Notre Dame keeper.
O'Hara was once again at the
center of the action in the 27th
minute, when she nutmegged her
defender on the left, passing the ball
between her opponent's legs, and
sent in a hard cross right to Christen
Press. But the sophomore's header
was right at Lysander.
Stanford would come close one
more time before halftime, with
freshman midfielder Cami Levin
hitting the crossbar on a chip from
outside the box in the 39th minute.
Although the Cardinal was down, it
certainly was not yet out.
The second half was almost com
pletely dominated by the Cardinal,
as the team went in search of the
crucial equalizer.
" The first half I thought we were
a little impatient in our build-up
play and we didn't get enough num

bers in the attack." Ratcliffe said.
"In the second half, we wanted to
get our outside backs involved in
the attack, and get our midfielders
more involved and maybe make
one or two more passes than we
were making in the first half."
Ten minutes into the half. Press
made a run down the right wing and
swung in a cross. Although the ball
was deflected. O'Hara rose high to
meet it, but could not get her head
er down on goal.
With 15 minutes remaining,
Stanford threw everything it had at
the Irish goal. First O'Hara once
again got her head on a cross, this
time from junior fullback Alicia
Jenkins, but could not get enough
power on the header to get it past
the keeper.
Then Stanford's other junior full
back. Ali Riley, worked her way
down the left flank and sent a cross
right to Taylor, who saw her header
saved. One minute later, senior de
fender Allison Fa Ik won a header off
a Taylor free kick, but once again the
shot went right at Lysander. No mat
ter who was shooting for the Cardi
nal, the results were the same, as the
Stanford women just couldn't quite
get the ball across the goal line.
