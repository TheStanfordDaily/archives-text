# Let them play, or, foul play
## 
### 
A slipshod year of NFL offici
ating has come lull circle.
In week two, a terrible call cost
ihe S.in Diego ( 'hargers a game: in
the wild-card round of the playoffs,
the same team was given new life in
overtime because of a yellow flag.
Back in September, the Charg
ers led the Denver Broncos — a di
visional foe. making Ihe officiating
error all the more egregious — by
seven points late in the fourth quar
ter. Denver quarterback Jay Cutler
fumbled on the Chargers' one-yard
line with just over a minute left.The
ball was recovered by San Diego,
which should have been the end of
the game. But referee Ed Hochuli's
inadvertent whistle caused the play
to be blown dead, even though Cut
ler had clearly fumbled and the
Chargers had clearly recovered.
Hochuli, to his credit, admitted his
mistake — something plenty of ref
erees refuse to do — but it was of
no solace to the Chargers. Denver
scored on fourth down, and the en
suing two-point conversion won
the game.
Hochuli didn't necessarily hand
the Broncos a win, since San Diego
did have chances to stop them twice
more and then once again on the
two-point conversion. But it clearly
never should have got to that point
— the Chargers should have been
able to kneel down after the fumble
recovery to escape with a win.
It was a bad call from one of the
league's best referees, and San
Diego fans took the misguided step
of sending Hochuli death threats.
This was a year in which every
team could.at one point or another,
gripe about at least a few calls, and
not of the typically petty variety.
Defensive ends were literally put in
chokeholds, but without a holding
call. Yet even the slightest, most in
cidental contact between an end
and a quarterback — in the mil
liseconds after a throw — was
ruled as roughing the passer. Con
sistency was hard to find, but at the
very least, with the exception of the
San Diego-Denver game, there
weren't many notable cases where
a call snatched defeat from the jaws
of victory, or vice-versa — that is,
they weren't monumental.
Fast forward to last weekend's
wild-card matchup between the
Chargers and the Indianapolis
Colts, where the refs had to make
their presence known and spoil an
otherwise memorable game. It was,
for the most part, a rough contest.
The unnamed defensive end I men
tioned above could, in this case, be
the Colts' Dwight Freeney.who was
held on play after play with no call.
But so be it — the refs called a
below-average total of nine penal
ties in regulation.They were letting
the players play, which I, as a fan
with no horse in this race, appreci
ated. It was also surprising, since
referee Ron Winter's crew has a

reputation for throwing the most
penalty Hags in the league.
Then came overtime. The
Chargers won the toss, and pro
ceeded to march down into Colts
territory. But the Indianapolis de
fense held on third down and eight
— or so it seemed. Instead, the refs
whistled cornerback Tim Jennings
for defensive holding on what was,
at best, a marginal call. Both the re
ceiver and Jennings had initiated
contact, and it was within five yards
of the line of scrimmage. It was the
type of call that had been over
looked throughout the rest of the
game, a ticky-tack throw of the yel
low flag that gave the Chargers new
life.
It was like being fined for jay
walking. Flie good cop doesn't ar
rest or issue citations for every bor
derline infraction he sees;similarly,
the good ref hardly ever makes that
call, and especially not in overtime
of a playoff game.
Instead of punting on fourth
down and giving NFL MVP Peyton
Manning the ball, San Diego was
given a first down, and a few plays
later, they won on a 22-yard scam
per by Darren Sproles.
The refs didn't hand San Diego a
win, and Indy still had opportuni
ties to stop the Chargers, yet a
pulled facemask and a worn-down
defense could do little to keep San
Diego out of the end zone. But, the
refs call irreversibly changed the
game; the Chargers' drive had
stalled, and yet here it was allowed
to continue.
The cynic in me thinks that the
NFL finally, after nearly four
months, paid the Chargers back for
handing them a loss in a game they
had wrapped up. But really.it is just
incompetence — something Win
ter knows plenty about.

eree of another wild-card game, this
one between the New York Giants
and San Francisco 49ers. Long story
short:The Giants lined up for a 112 ield
goal to win the game with two sec

holder Matt Allen decided to at
tempt a pass instead. Rich Seubert.
an offensive lineman, had lined up
as an eligible receiver, and raced to
ward the end zone. I le was knocked
to the ground by a 49ers defender
— a clear pass interference penalty
— but was instead whistled for
being an ineligible receiver down
field. Instead of the New York get
ting the ball at the 49ers eight-yard
line because of the would-be penal
ly — a chip-shot field goal for any
NFL kicker — the game was de
clared over. The commissioner at
the time, Paul Tagliabue, apolo
gized profusely to the Giants, but it
was of no use — the game was de
cided.
Referees are human, and unless
a QuesTec system is applied univer
sally. mistakes will continue to hap
pen. And. particularly in the NFL.
with so much happening at once
and so much contact being made.

Between the lines
it's especially hard to make the cor
rect call all the time. But with so
much on the line, especially in the
playoffs, these mishaps persist, and
they are no better than the ultimate
failure of the referees and their su
periors.

Wyndam Makowsky is the head refer
ee for Stanford intramural flag foot
ball and has never missed a call. Con
