the final IS seconds of the game — ensured the
Cardinal's first visit to the finals since its 2005

championship game against UCLA, when the Bru
ins edged Stanford 10-9 in overtime. Although
LMU goalie Andy Stevens saved 14 shots on the
night, junior Janson Wigo set up Schwimer for a
strategically placed shot right over Stevens' head.
The goal put Stanford ahead 6-5.

scores in [crucial] situations," said redshirt senior
Steven Wright.
In the last 14 scconds.l.MU attacked on a 6-on
-5 power play advantage. Despite the advantage,
Sandman made one final save off a point-blank
shot from LMU's Brian Benedetti. Stanford — al
