championship game against UCLA, when the Bru
ins edged Stanford 10-9 in overtime. Although
LMU goalie Andy Stevens saved 14 shots on the
night, junior Janson Wigo set up Schwimer for a
strategically placed shot right over Stevens' head.
The goal put Stanford ahead 6-5.
"[Schwimer] always seems to be the one who
scores in [crucial] situations," said redshirt senior
Steven Wright.
In the last 14 scconds.l.MU attacked on a 6-on
-5 power play advantage. Despite the advantage,
Sandman made one final save off a point-blank

count for Iwo thuds of the Cardinal's total losses. The good news:
Stanford returns all but four players to make for what should be anoth
er dominant team in 2009.
— ensured its dominance with
strong defense, including 10 saves
from Sandman.
"All that mattered was that we
scored more on them than they did
us," junior Drac Wigo said.
The Cardinal, indeed, did just
that. Drac Wigo started the scoring
on a power play as he launched a
backhand shot in the first 2:25 to
take the early 1-0 lead. But LMU
retaliated 14 seconds later as
Benedetti put one in for the Lions.
Capitalizing on power plays
seemed to be the game strategy for
both teams. LMU took the 2-1 lead
with 3:05 remaining in the first as
Tim Hummel snuck a shot past
Sandman. Stanford redshirt sopho
more Cody Wiesen struck with 5:56
left in the half to even the score.
With both teams playing a tactical
offense, LMU claimed the lead
again as Benedetti notched his sec
ond goal of the night. Senior Will
I lindle-Katel added a goal with just
over three minutes left in the half,
and the teams went to the break
tied at three.
"I just kept telling myself to
focus on great defense and counter
hard," Drac Wigo said. "This has
been our strategy for close games."
LMU's Tim Heafner scored just
53 seconds into the second half to
give the Lions the lead. Stanford
tied it up with a shot from junior
Sage Wright that found the back of
the net. The Lions' determination
proved strong as Andrew Aki
scored with 4:08 in the third to re
claim the lead.
Stanford shut down the LMU of
fense for the rest of the night, caus
ing turnovers and blocking shots. In
the fourth period. Stanford's of
fense came through in the form of
Drac Wigo — he blasted a shot past
Stevens with just under seven min
utes to play.
After Drac Wigo missed a five
meter penalty shot. Schwimer
broke the tie for the 6-5 victory and
a shot at the championship.
With USC's perfect record and
three previous wins over the Cardi
nal. Stanford knew it had to bring its
best game against the Trojans. The
Cardinal mustered five goals, but it
wasn't enough — the Trojans put
seven past Sandman.
The Cardinal took the lead earlv.
After a Sandman save. Drac Wigo
took advantage of a 6-on-5 power
play and scored just 1:28 into the

first period. Sandman blocked shots
from USC's J.W. Krumpholz and
Shea Buckner, but the Trojans ral
lied and Buckner scored on a 6-on
-5 power play with 4:27 left in the
quarter. Going into the second peri
od, the score was tied at one.
"We came out with so much
emotion we jumped on them, but
they answered back and for some
reason or another dominated us for
a quarter," Janson Wigo said. "If we
can play at the same tempo
throughout the entire game, we will
win NCAAs next year."
Stanford would not back down
and Schwimer fired a quick shot
past USC goalie Joel Dennerly with
2:56 left in the period. The Trojans
then held the Cardinal scoreless
until the third period as they blast
ed in four unanswered goals, with
Buckner leading the charge once
again. Buckner converted on a five
meter penalty shot just 57 seconds
into the second period, and Jordan
Thompson and Justin Rappel
added a goal each to give USC a 4-2
lead at the half.
Sandman played tough and
blocked a number of shots, includ
ing the first attempt of the second
half. But Buckner's third shot of the
night came off the post and into the
net to set the Trojans at 5-2. Kyle
Sterling followed suit and scored on
a 6-on-5 advantage with 1:12 to
play.
The Cardinal responded as Ryan
McCarthy put a shot into the goal
just over Dennerly's head. Jan
son Wigo then got into the action,
scoring on a power play and short
ening the gap to 6-4 with 4:43 re
maining.
USC's Krumpholz added a back
hand goal with 3:17 left, increasing
the Trojan lead to 7-4 and leaving
little hope for a Cardinal comeback.
But Sage Wright sparked the Stan
ford men with 1:36 remaining by
scoring on a power play.
With little time left, the Stanford
offense attempted to get within
striking distance. But the final shot
was stopped by Dennerly, handing
the Cardinal a 7-5 loss and crowning
USC as the NCAA champions.The
long road to the NCAA champi
onship game ended in bittersweet
fashion for the Cardinal.
"It would have been great to go
out on top as a senior, but the last
two years we missed qualifying for
the tournament at all." Steven
Wright said. "It was a great experi
ence to be able to play in NCAAs at
home."
