Men's basketball stayed busy over the break,
playing eight games — six against a slew of non
conference opponents. But it wasn't until Ari

truly tested.

GAMF NOTES: Stanford men's basketball started out 2009 by
showing great resiliency. The Cardinal bounced back from a
30-point thrashing at the hands of ASU to handily beat the
Arizona Wildcats, 76-60. On Friday, ASU's Jeff Pendergraph
ripped the Stanford defense for 31 points and guard James
Harden added 1 7; only one Stanford player scored in double
figures. Sunday, the Cardinal defense held the Wildcats to just
60 points — and 0-for-8 shooting from beyond the arc —
while three Stanford players scored in double digits, including
an impressive 19-point effort from Landry Fields. The Cardi
nal travels to Seattle to battle the Huskies on Thursday.

As first-year head coach Johnny Dawkins said
after his team's 76-60 win over Arizona on Sun
day, "sometimes a tough lesson is the lesson you
learn the best."That certainly appeared to be the
case as the Cardinal rebounded in its second Pa
cific-10 Conference matchup of the season after
being drubbed by Arizona State just two nights
earlier. 90-60.
The Cardinal had rolled into its showdown


JFFF KEACHER/The Stanford Daily
Landry Fields had a huge game against Arizona on Sunday, notching his first collegiate double-double
Stanford hopes to learn from Friday's 30-point beatdown by ASU when it travels to Washington this week
with the No. 17 Sun Devils (12-2. 1-
1 Pac-10) on a high, having won
every one of its 10 games up to that
point. Moreover, after winning by
narrower margins to start the year,
Stanford had trounced Texas Tech.
111-66. less than a week earlier on
Dec. 28.
But ASU forward Jeff Fender
graph rolled over the Cardinal
frontcourt for 31 points and 11 re
bounds in just 28 minutes. Star Sun
Devils sophomore James Harden
chipped in 17 points and 10 assists.
The Cardinal trailed the whole
game, and was down 13 points at the
half and the full 30 with 5:39 re
maining.
"That wasn't the team we're try
ing to be," said senior Lawrence
Hill, who led the Cardinal with 14
points. "We've been put on a front.
We're going out there, having a little
swagger, and we think we're capa
ble of being a good team, but that's
not going to happen if we don't do
it. We come in here talking to the

media and we come out and say
'we're capable' and this and that,
but it's all about playing."
After dropping its first game of
the season and falling to 10-1 and 0-
1 in the conference, the Cardinal
came to play against Arizona (9-5,
0-2) on Sunday night. As junior for
ward Landry Fields explained, it
was the pain of that first loss that
helped drive the Cardinal to its win
over the Wildcats.
"We just came together after that
kind of left a sour taste in our
mouth." he said. "We decided we
were going to take some pride when
we play, especially at home."
Fields put up some of his best
numbers ever as a member of the
Cardinal, scoring 19 points and
grabbing 11 boards for his first ca
reer double-double, but refused to
celebrate too much after his big
night, deferring much of the credit
to his teammates.
"I don't like to think of it as a ca
reer game, because I never want to
be too high and I never want to be
too low." Fields said. "With our of
fense, I just made reads on re
bounds. different cuts. Just playing
basketball, you know, and under
standing the game and what you can

get from people like ([senior An
thony] Goods) when he's taking his
shots."
The win marked Stanford's
fourth in a row over Arizona as a
swarming, persistent defense put
plenty of pressure on the Wildcats
— Stanford notched 20 turnovers
for the fifth time this season.
Dawkins. who has stressed the
importance of defensive play to his
team all season, was pleased with
the effort displayed by the Cardinal.
"I thought our guys played well
tonight from the standpoint of. de
fensively. we were able to really de
fend the ball well," he said. "I
thought we made every possession
more difficult. 1 thought we re
sponded from the game we had the
other night by defending well and
rebounding well: that's what we
have to hang our hat on. and that's
what they were able to do tonight."
Seniors Hill and Goods joined
Fields in double figures for the night
— Hill scored 14 and Goods 13,
knocking down three from beyond
the arc. But perhaps most impres
sive of all was the way the Cardinal
rebounded mentally from the dev
astating loss to the Sun Devils.
"Friday was one of our worst

performances of the season." Goods
said. "Just watching the tape today,
everybody on the team had kind of
a chip on their shoulder, so we real
ly wanted to come out and have a
better performance in this game."
Dawkins spoke after the game
about how he prepared his team to
bounce back from its first loss of the
season.
"I thought it was very important
we came back last night and met in
here in Maples with the lights off.
and just talked," he said. "I kind of
talked about my story. Believe it or
not. I've had some big losses in my
life. too. so we talked about how you
respond in those situations. And our
guys, to their credit, they rebounded
and came out inspired tonight."
The Cardinal men will look to
build a new winning streak starting
on Thursday when they travel to
Seattle to take on the Huskies.
Washington is currently 10-3 on the
year and 1-0 in the Pac-10 after de
feating Washington State 68-48 on
Saturday, lip off is scheduled for
7:30 p.m. and the game will be
broadcast live on CSN Bav Area.

The Cardinal had rolled into its showdown


JFFF KEACHER/The Stanford Daily
Landry Fields had a huge game against Arizona on Sunday, notching his first collegiate double-double
Stanford hopes to learn from Friday's 30-point beatdown by ASU when it travels to Washington this week
with the No. 17 Sun Devils (12-2. 1-
1 Pac-10) on a high, having won
every one of its 10 games up to that
point. Moreover, after winning by
narrower margins to start the year,
Stanford had trounced Texas Tech.
111-66. less than a week earlier on

But ASU forward Jeff Fender

chipped in 17 points and 10 assists.
The Cardinal trailed the whole

Men's basketball stayed busy over the break,
playing eight games — six against a slew of non
conference opponents. But it wasn't until Ari

truly tested.

GAMF NOTES: Stanford men's basketball started out 2009 by
showing great resiliency. The Cardinal bounced back from a
30-point thrashing at the hands of ASU to handily beat the
Arizona Wildcats, 76-60. On Friday, ASU's Jeff Pendergraph
ripped the Stanford defense for 31 points and guard James
Harden added 1 7; only one Stanford player scored in double
figures. Sunday, the Cardinal defense held the Wildcats to just
60 points — and 0-for-8 shooting from beyond the arc —
while three Stanford players scored in double digits, including
an impressive 19-point effort from Landry Fields. The Cardi
nal travels to Seattle to battle the Huskies on Thursday.

As first-year head coach Johnny Dawkins said
after his team's 76-60 win over Arizona on Sun
day, "sometimes a tough lesson is the lesson you
learn the best."That certainly appeared to be the
case as the Cardinal rebounded in its second Pa
cific-10 Conference matchup of the season after
being drubbed by Arizona State just two nights
earlier. 90-60.
The Cardinal had rolled into its showdown


JFFF KEACHER/The Stanford Daily
Landry Fields had a huge game against Arizona on Sunday, notching his first collegiate double-double
Stanford hopes to learn from Friday's 30-point beatdown by ASU when it travels to Washington this week
with the No. 17 Sun Devils (12-2. 1-
1 Pac-10) on a high, having won
every one of its 10 games up to that
point. Moreover, after winning by
narrower margins to start the year,
Stanford had trounced Texas Tech.
111-66. less than a week earlier on
Dec. 28.
But ASU forward Jeff Fender
graph rolled over the Cardinal
frontcourt for 31 points and 11 re
bounds in just 28 minutes. Star Sun
Devils sophomore James Harden
chipped in 17 points and 10 assists.
The Cardinal trailed the whole
game, and was down 13 points at the
half and the full 30 with 5:39 re
maining.
"That wasn't the team we're try
ing to be," said senior Lawrence
Hill, who led the Cardinal with 14
points. "We've been put on a front.
We're going out there, having a little
swagger, and we think we're capa
ble of being a good team, but that's
not going to happen if we don't do
it. We come in here talking to the

media and we come out and say
'we're capable' and this and that,
but it's all about playing."
After dropping its first game of
the season and falling to 10-1 and 0-
1 in the conference, the Cardinal
came to play against Arizona (9-5,
0-2) on Sunday night. As junior for
ward Landry Fields explained, it
was the pain of that first loss that
helped drive the Cardinal to its win
over the Wildcats.
"We just came together after that
kind of left a sour taste in our
mouth." he said. "We decided we
were going to take some pride when
we play, especially at home."
Fields put up some of his best
numbers ever as a member of the
Cardinal, scoring 19 points and
grabbing 11 boards for his first ca
reer double-double, but refused to
celebrate too much after his big
night, deferring much of the credit
to his teammates.
"I don't like to think of it as a ca
reer game, because I never want to
be too high and I never want to be
too low." Fields said. "With our of
fense, I just made reads on re
bounds. different cuts. Just playing
basketball, you know, and under
standing the game and what you can

get from people like ([senior An
thony] Goods) when he's taking his
shots."
The win marked Stanford's
fourth in a row over Arizona as a
swarming, persistent defense put
plenty of pressure on the Wildcats
— Stanford notched 20 turnovers
for the fifth time this season.
Dawkins. who has stressed the
importance of defensive play to his
team all season, was pleased with
the effort displayed by the Cardinal.
"I thought our guys played well
tonight from the standpoint of. de
fensively. we were able to really de
fend the ball well," he said. "I
thought we made every possession
more difficult. 1 thought we re

have to hang our hat on. and that's
