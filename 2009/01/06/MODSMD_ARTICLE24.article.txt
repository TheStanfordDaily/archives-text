Men's basketball stayed busy over the break,
playing eight games — six against a slew of non
conference opponents. But it wasn't until Ari
zona State came to town that the Cardinal was
truly tested.

GAMF NOTES: Stanford men's basketball started out 2009 by
showing great resiliency. The Cardinal bounced back from a
30-point thrashing at the hands of ASU to handily beat the
Arizona Wildcats, 76-60. On Friday, ASU's Jeff Pendergraph
ripped the Stanford defense for 31 points and guard James
Harden added 1 7; only one Stanford player scored in double
figures. Sunday, the Cardinal defense held the Wildcats to just
60 points — and 0-for-8 shooting from beyond the arc —
while three Stanford players scored in double digits, including
an impressive 19-point effort from Landry Fields. The Cardi
nal travels to Seattle to battle the Huskies on Thursday.

As first-year head coach Johnny Dawkins said
after his team's 76-60 win over Arizona on Sun
day, "sometimes a tough lesson is the lesson you
learn the best."That certainly appeared to be the
case as the Cardinal rebounded in its second Pa
cific-10 Conference matchup of the season after
being drubbed by Arizona State just two nights
earlier. 90-60.
