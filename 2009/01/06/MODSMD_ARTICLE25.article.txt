## Steelers' Harrison named Defensive POY Linebacker edges DE Ware and S Reed to win the award 
### BARRY WILNER THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
NF.W YORK - Kent State once sent a linebacker to
the Pittsburgh Steelers who epitomized everything
the Steel Curtain was about.
That was Jack Lambert.
The current version of the hard-hitting, versatile
and dynamic former Kent Stater in Steel City is
James Harrison.The Associated Press 2008 Defen
sive Player of the Year.
The linebacker, who had a career-high 16 sacks
to set a team record and led the NFL with a career
high seven forced fumbles, beat Dallas' DeMarcus
Ware in balloting by a nationwide panel of 50sports
writers and broadcasters announced Monday. Pitts
burgh was the league's stingiest in total defense,
pass defense and points allowed. Harrison was its
main hammer.
"That's something that everybody in the league
would love to have,to be voted the top player in the

league for that year." I larrison said. "In my mind, I
think I do - and it's going to sound horing - what the
defense allows me to do and what my teammates
allow me to do."
I larrison earned 22 votes to 13 for Ware.
Baltimore safety lid Reed, the 2004 winner, got
eight votes. Tennessee defensive tackle Albert
Haynesworth had five and Harrison's teammate,
safety Troy Polamalu.got two.
"It couldn't happen to a better guy." Steelers
veteran receiver Mines Ward said, "lie's worked
his tail off to get to where he is. You appreciate it
more,considering where he came from and how he
got here."
Harrison credited defensive coordinator Dick
Le√üeau's schemes with allowing him.an undrafted
free agent who was cut several times by Pittsburgh
and once by Baltimore, to eventually become a
star.
" ITie defense is built to play with 11 guys, and if
all 11 guys are on the same page, playing the same
defense on the same play, there's nothing that can
go wrong and that's just how we feel about it," Har
rison said.
But fellow linebacker James Farrior, who has
seen Harrison develop from a backup to Joey
Porter into one of the game's biggest playmakers,

sees Harrison as the key.
"His whole attitude about football, I think he
works harder than anybody else in this locker
room," Farriorsaid."He has a great work ethic. I le's
very tuned in to what he has to do to make himself
better. Iliat s all he strives for. to try to be better
than anybody else, and you can see his determina
tion when he's out there on the field.
"We've got good players on this team, and every
team has good players,but he seems to be - this year
and last year - making the plays that made the dif
ference in the game."
Harrison is the fifth Steelers player to win the
award, including three Hall of Famers from the
original Steel Curtain: Joe Greene (1974). Mel
Blount (1975) and Lambert (1976). In 1993, Rod
Woodson was AP Defensive Player of the Year,
and he's eligible for the I lall for the first time this
year.
ITie Steelers didn't allow a l(K)-yard rusher or
3(K)-yard passer in 2(X)K. Harrison didn't limit his
work to that stingy unit, though: Harrison also had
12 special teams tackles.
"People said I couldn't do this or couldn't do
that," he noted. "I was too short, too slow. Basically,
I play and prepare myself in the offseason with the
thoughts of what people said I couldn't do."
