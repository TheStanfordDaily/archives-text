## Mr. Holt goes to Washington 
### TIM BOOTH THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SEATTLE - Still stinging from an 0-12 season,
Washington fans probably wouldn't mind if the
Huskies became "USC North."
Washington's new coaching staff is certainly
starting to take on that look.
After USC offensive coordinator Steve Sarkisian
was snagged to be the Huskies' new head coach,
Sarkisian plucked away the Trojans' defensive coor
dinator on Monday, hiring Nick Holt to hold the
same position with the Huskies.
Holt will replace Ed Donated, who was not re
tained after Sarkisian was hired in early December.
"This is very exciting for Husky football," Sark
isian said in a statement. "I don't think we could
have found a more qualified or successful defensive
coordinator anywhere in the country."
Holt's hiring was announced by the school Mon
day afternoon. He was expected to be formally in
troduced at a news conference on Tuesday, and will
become the third former USC staff member to join
Sarkisian's new Huskies' staff, with a handful of as
sistant spots still to be filled.
Demetrice Martin and Jared Blank have also
been hired to the UW staff.
"Coach Sarkisian has been working tirelessly to
recruit and to hire coaches." Washington athletic di
rector Scott Woodward said. "This hire is a clear re
inforcement of the confidence I have in him to put
together a top-notch coaching staff."
Holt has served as the Trojans' defensive line
coach and defensive coordinator for the last three
seasons. His unit was the strength of USC's 12-1
record this past season, leading the country in total
defense (206 yards per game).scoring defense (7.75
points), pass defense and pass efficiency defense.
But the lure to Washington may have been Holt's
ability to run the show with Washington. While
holding the title of defensive coordinator at USC.
he often shared some of those duties with head
coach Pete Carroll, a noted defensive guru.
Holt's task appears quite significant. Last sea
son's Washington defense was the worst in school
history, giving up 451.8 yards and nearly 39 points
per game. But he will inherit some talent with po
tentially 10 starters returning, including a large
number of underclassmen who saw significant play
ing time last season.
Holt. 46, also has Pacific Northwest ties, serving
as head coach at Idaho in 2004 and 2005. Aside from
his 5-18 stint as the Vandals' head coach. Holt has
been on the Trojans' staff since 2001. He also served
as an assistant at UNLV. Idaho and Louisville.
