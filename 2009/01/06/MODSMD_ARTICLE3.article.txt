## Senior class pres. replaced Whitney Martin fills vacant seat in four-person senior class presidency 
### ALEX HOLTZMAN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Whitney Martin 'W was named to the senior class presi
dency at the end of fall quarter, after Jessica Lu — elected
senior class president in April 2(X)8 — decided to take a quar
ter off for what she said were "personal, private reasons."
"It was a hit unexpected," said l.u. adding that she decid
ed to take time away from Stanford at the end of the summer.
She now lives off campus and works in San Francisco.
Lu's decision to resign created an apparently unprecedent
ed succession issue.
"I think it was an unusual situation," said Jordan Goldberg
one of the three class presidents, "and so I don't think
there were specific guidelines for dealing with this because
I'm not sure it has ever happened before."
Applicants for the president's seat were interviewed by
Goldberg, the two other senior class presidents (Dimitar lliev
*()9 and Johnny MeCormick '09). as well as ASSIJ President
Johnny Horsey '09 and advisors for the senior cabinet from
the Alumni Center.
"We wanted to make sure the process was transparent."
Goldberg said, "so we went through the University and we
considered the opinion of people important in the ASSU."
At a senior cabinet meeting, the class presidents asked
interested cabinet members to apply for the vacancy. l our
expressed interest and interviewed for the position.
Martin comes to the senior presidency with significant
extracurricular and community service experience at
Stanford, but limited involvement in student government.
"In high school, I loved serving the community las a mem-
her of student council]," Martin said,
"and I continued to do that at Stanford,
just through different groups."
According to Martin, two of her
most significant accomplishments at
Stanford came through Dance
Marathon and the Bridge Peer
Counseling Center. She served as
recruitment chair for Dance Marathon
during her sophomore year and has
been involved with the Bridge hoth as a
staffer and as a live-in counselor. These
same qualities impressed the panel.
"Whitney is awesome," Goldberg
said. "Anyone who knows her knows
she would make an amazing class pres
ident."
Dorsey sat in on the interviews but
was not a part of the final decision. Still,
he had nothing but praise for Martin.
"She complements the other [class
presidents] very well," the ASSU presi
dent said. "She's phenomenal."
l.u also supported Martin's applica
tion though she did not participate in
the final decision.
It remains unclear whether Martin's

"She complements

presidents very
well."
— JOHNNY DORSEY '09
selection will bring about any signifi
cant change in policy direction or allo
cation of responsibilities among the
senior presidents. Formerly, as sopho
more and junior class presidents,
Goldberg and lliev took on specific
projects and formed committees. Iliis
year, they instead decided to work as a
unit.
Still. Martin appears to favor return
ing to a clear division of responsibilities

among the presidents. She also plans to
foster communication among class
presidents about effective strategies.
According to the 2008 ASSU
Elections Handbook. "Each Class
President Slate (Sophomore, Junior
and Senior) represents the concerns
and needs of its class by providing pro
gramming and advocacy on issues per
taining to its respective class. Examples
include planning class formals. holding
alumni mentoring events and imple
menting class spirit activities."
In addition to these duties shared by
all class presidents, senior class presi
dents plan Senior Nights and share stu
dent input with the University presi
dent on the graduation speaker.
Traditionally, slates of approximate
ly four candidates run for the class pres
idency in an April ASSU election.
Goldberg, Lu. lliev and McCormick
ran unopposed as the Axe Effect slate
in April of last year.
