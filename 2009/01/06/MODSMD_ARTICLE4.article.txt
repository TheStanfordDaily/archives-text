hall teams started the 2008 season ranked Nos. I
and 2 in the country and began the postseason
the same way. The top two teams in the nation
clawed their way through the NCAA
Tournament to meet in the championship match
on Dec. 20.
In the end. it was the Nittany Lions who com
pleted their record-breaking season in perfect
fashion, sweeping Stanford for the 2008 NCAA

match but could not muster enough points,
falling 25-20.26-24.25-23.

career come to a close with 11 kills and 15 digs
on the night. Fellow senior Foluke Akinradewo
finished with eight kills and six blocks, while
sophomore Alix Klineman led the Cardinal with
15 kills. Penn State's Megan I lodge — the tour
nament's Most Outstanding Player — led all
players with 16 kills.
it was a season-low hitting night for both
teams, with Penn State edging out Stanford. .177
to .142. Penn State's hitting average was over
.400 on the season and Stanford's was over .300.
It was a hard-fought match, but Penn State was
tougher serving and had more digs than the
Cardinal (64-54). making it tough for the
Stanford women to knock down kills.

we gave them a battle tonight." head coach John
