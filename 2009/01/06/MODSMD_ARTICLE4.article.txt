### DANNY BELCH DESK EDITOR 
The Penn State and Stanford women's volley
hall teams started the 2008 season ranked Nos. I
and 2 in the country and began the postseason
the same way. The top two teams in the nation
clawed their way through the NCAA
Tournament to meet in the championship match
on Dec. 20.
In the end. it was the Nittany Lions who com
pleted their record-breaking season in perfect
fashion, sweeping Stanford for the 2008 NCAA
title. The Cardinal kept it close throughout the
match but could not muster enough points,
falling 25-20.26-24.25-23.
Senior Cynthia Barboza saw her Stanford
career come to a close with 11 kills and 15 digs
on the night. Fellow senior Foluke Akinradewo
finished with eight kills and six blocks, while
sophomore Alix Klineman led the Cardinal with
15 kills. Penn State's Megan I lodge — the tour
nament's Most Outstanding Player — led all
players with 16 kills.
it was a season-low hitting night for both
teams, with Penn State edging out Stanford. .177
to .142. Penn State's hitting average was over
.400 on the season and Stanford's was over .300.
It was a hard-fought match, but Penn State was
tougher serving and had more digs than the
Cardinal (64-54). making it tough for the
Stanford women to knock down kills.

we gave them a battle tonight." head coach John

Stanford said goodbye to its phenomenal senior class after losing to
the Nittany Lions in the NCAA Final for the second straight year. Penn
State was undefeated on the season.
Dunning said after the match. "If you
take a look back at a match like this,
there are a few plays that are differ
ent ... a few plays can make a differ
ence in the match."
"I don't think it was the prettiest
match to determine the national
championship." Penn State head
coach Russ Rose said. "But it was a
match that was played very hard by
both teams."
Stanford has now finished as na
tional runner-up for the third consec
utive year and the second time in a
row to Penn State. Stanford finishes
its season 31-4, while the Nittany
Lions finished a perfect 38-0, a feat
only four teams have ever accom
plished. Penn State also becomes just
the sixth team in history to win back
to-back NCAA titles.
Barboza and Klineman were
named to the Final Four All-Tourna
ment team along with Penn State set
ter Alisha Glass and hitter Nicole
Fawcett,Texas hitter Destinee Hook
er and Nebraska hitter Jordan Lar
son. It was the second straight All-
Tournament award for Klineman.
Though the Cardinal could not

come out with a championship, it was
an unbelievable ride to the final.
'ITieir semifinal victory over No. 3
Texas was one of the most exciting
matches in Stanford history and had
volleyball fans across the country
buzzing.
After playing below its potential
for the first two games, Stanford found
itself in a 2-0 deficit and 25 points away
from getting sent home. Akinradewo
and Barboza were quiet through the
first two sets, and they needed to get
going if Stanford was going to have
any hope of achieving a victory. After
the teams came out from the break,
the Cardinal had new life.
Barboza scored 15ofher 19 kills in
the final three sets, sophomore Alix
Klineman pounded 20 kills, Akin
radewo had 17 and Stanford roared
back to take the next three sets and
the match. The Cardinal dominated
the Longhorns after the break, look
ing like a completely different team
from that in the first two sets. Bar
boza slammed a kill to end the match,
and Stanford became the only team
in Final Four history to come from
behind to win after being down 2-0.

Not overshadowed by the tough
end to Stanford's season, two Stan
ford seniors finished their eareers
with some incredible achievements.
Akinradewo finished with 579 blocks
in her four-year career — ninth all
time in the Pacific-10 Conference and
third in school history. She also fin
ished with 1,682 career kills, good for
eighth all-time at Stanford.
Barboza finished her career with
1.639 kills, just behind Akinradewo
on the career rankings at Stanford.
She also finished sixth in digs (1,241)
and ninth in service aces (115).
Sophomore libero Gabi Ailes fin
ished the season with 491 digs, third
all-time at Stanford for a single sea
son. Ilie achievement is more re
markable because of a rule change
this season that shortened each game
from 30 to 25 points.
But perhaps the biggest achieve
ment belonged to Akinradewo. who
finished her career as the NCAA's
most efficient hitter. She hit .446 over
her four years, the best career per
centage ever by a female collegiate
volleyball player.
Although Stanford's seniors leave

the Farm with three NCAA runner
up finishes, they will not let that de
fine their volleyball experience.
"Penn State is a great team; they
have a really big block and great de
fense behind it,so it is hard to get kills
on them," Akinradewo said after the
match. "But. I think our team did an
amazing job on them. We kept fight
ing and never gave up. It's tough los
ing. but at the same time I am so
proud of my teammates."
For fellow graduating senior Bar
boza. her four years have garnered
quite a bit. even if that doesn't in
clude a national championship.
"This season has been unbeliev
able for me in terms of what I have
learned about myself, what it means
to be a team and what it means to
fight," Bshe said. "I can't cry about
the outcome of that match, but you
can hear me choking up starting to
talk about my teammates. It's not
about that outcome;it's about the en
tire process.This year was absolutely
incredible for so many reasons."

The Penn State and Stanford women's volley
hall teams started the 2008 season ranked Nos. I
and 2 in the country and began the postseason
the same way. The top two teams in the nation
clawed their way through the NCAA
Tournament to meet in the championship match
on Dec. 20.
In the end. it was the Nittany Lions who com
pleted their record-breaking season in perfect
fashion, sweeping Stanford for the 2008 NCAA
title. The Cardinal kept it close throughout the
match but could not muster enough points,
falling 25-20.26-24.25-23.
Senior Cynthia Barboza saw her Stanford
career come to a close with 11 kills and 15 digs
on the night. Fellow senior Foluke Akinradewo
finished with eight kills and six blocks, while
sophomore Alix Klineman led the Cardinal with
15 kills. Penn State's Megan I lodge — the tour
nament's Most Outstanding Player — led all
players with 16 kills.
it was a season-low hitting night for both
teams, with Penn State edging out Stanford. .177
to .142. Penn State's hitting average was over
.400 on the season and Stanford's was over .300.
It was a hard-fought match, but Penn State was
tougher serving and had more digs than the
Cardinal (64-54). making it tough for the
Stanford women to knock down kills.
"[Penn State is) really, really good — 1 think
we gave them a battle tonight." head coach John


CHRIS SEEWALD/The Stanford Daily
Stanford said goodbye to its phenomenal senior class after losing to
the Nittany Lions in the NCAA Final for the second straight year. Penn
State was undefeated on the season.
Dunning said after the match. "If you
take a look back at a match like this,
there are a few plays that are differ
ent ... a few plays can make a differ
ence in the match."
"I don't think it was the prettiest
match to determine the national
championship." Penn State head
coach Russ Rose said. "But it was a
match that was played very hard by
both teams."
Stanford has now finished as na
tional runner-up for the third consec
utive year and the second time in a
row to Penn State. Stanford finishes
its season 31-4, while the Nittany
Lions finished a perfect 38-0, a feat
only four teams have ever accom
plished. Penn State also becomes just
the sixth team in history to win back
to-back NCAA titles.
Barboza and Klineman were
named to the Final Four All-Tourna
ment team along with Penn State set
ter Alisha Glass and hitter Nicole
Fawcett,Texas hitter Destinee Hook
er and Nebraska hitter Jordan Lar
son. It was the second straight All-
Tournament award for Klineman.
Though the Cardinal could not

come out with a championship, it was
an unbelievable ride to the final.
'ITieir semifinal victory over No. 3
Texas was one of the most exciting
matches in Stanford history and had
volleyball fans across the country
buzzing.
After playing below its potential
for the first two games, Stanford found
itself in a 2-0 deficit and 25 points away
from getting sent home. Akinradewo
and Barboza were quiet through the
first two sets, and they needed to get
going if Stanford was going to have
any hope of achieving a victory. After
the teams came out from the break,
the Cardinal had new life.
Barboza scored 15ofher 19 kills in
the final three sets, sophomore Alix
Klineman pounded 20 kills, Akin
radewo had 17 and Stanford roared
back to take the next three sets and
the match. The Cardinal dominated
the Longhorns after the break, look
ing like a completely different team
from that in the first two sets. Bar
boza slammed a kill to end the match,
and Stanford became the only team
in Final Four history to come from
behind to win after being down 2-0.

Not overshadowed by the tough
end to Stanford's season, two Stan
ford seniors finished their eareers
with some incredible achievements.
Akinradewo finished with 579 blocks
in her four-year career — ninth all
time in the Pacific-10 Conference and
third in school history. She also fin
ished with 1,682 career kills, good for
eighth all-time at Stanford.
Barboza finished her career with
1.639 kills, just behind Akinradewo
on the career rankings at Stanford.
She also finished sixth in digs (1,241)
and ninth in service aces (115).
Sophomore libero Gabi Ailes fin
ished the season with 491 digs, third
all-time at Stanford for a single sea
son. Ilie achievement is more re
markable because of a rule change
this season that shortened each game
from 30 to 25 points.
But perhaps the biggest achieve
ment belonged to Akinradewo. who
finished her career as the NCAA's
most efficient hitter. She hit .446 over
her four years, the best career per
centage ever by a female collegiate
volleyball player.
Although Stanford's seniors leave

the Farm with three NCAA runner
up finishes, they will not let that de
fine their volleyball experience.
"Penn State is a great team; they
have a really big block and great de
fense behind it,so it is hard to get kills
on them," Akinradewo said after the
match. "But. I think our team did an
amazing job on them. We kept fight
ing and never gave up. It's tough los
ing. but at the same time I am so
proud of my teammates."
For fellow graduating senior Bar
boza. her four years have garnered
quite a bit. even if that doesn't in
clude a national championship.
"This season has been unbeliev
able for me in terms of what I have
learned about myself, what it means
to be a team and what it means to
fight," Bshe said. "I can't cry about
the outcome of that match, but you
can hear me choking up starting to
talk about my teammates. It's not
about that outcome;it's about the en
tire process.This year was absolutely
incredible for so many reasons."
