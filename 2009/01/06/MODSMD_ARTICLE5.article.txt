# Early admit number drops
## Limited space leaves many early applicants out 
### KATE ABBOTT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After receiving a record-num
ber 5.363 single-choice early appli
cations in the fall. Stanford's
Office of Admission has accepted
659 prospective freshmen to the
Class of 2013. An influx of applica
tions combined with the need to
cut back on admission offers by
100 makes this season's early
admission rate the lowest in the
University's history.
Director of Admission Shawn
Abbott wrote in an email to The
Daily that the newly admitted stu
dents are similar to Stanford's cur
rent freshman class.
"There are not significant
quantifiable differences with
regard to our admitted students
this year." Abbott said. "The aca
demic profile, gender breakdown,
etc. of the students we've admitted
thus far is remarkably similar to
last year."
According to Abbott, the 12.8
percent early acceptance rate is
primarily attributed to the
University's anticipation of a high
yield rate, or a high percentage of
admits accepting their admission
offers.
"Because more students have
accepted Stanford's offer of
admission at unprecedented rates
in the last two years, we need to be
considerably more conservative
with our admission decisions this
year." the director said.
According to a press release
from the admission office. 25,000
applications are expected by the

Jan. 1 regular decision deadline.
Students are applying from
around the world, and Stanford
ranks in the top 10 of private
research universities enrolling stu
dents from the lowest socio-eco
nomic backgrounds.
"Our applicant pool is now a
robust international one. and those
who ultimately made the cut are
distinguished on a worldwide
scale," said Richard Shaw, dean of
admission and financial aid. in a
press release.
Abbott noted that an intensive
outreach program is in place to
increase the socio-economic diver
sity on campus. Among the Class
of 2012. for instance. 17 percent of
students are the first in their fami
lies to attend college.
Although schools across the
nation anticipated a decline in
applications this year due to the
recession, private universities
including Yale and Duke also saw
an increase in early applicants.
Shaw attributed this trend to a
higher availability of financial aid
programs.
"Stanford's new financial aid
programs, which provide tuition
free assistance to those families
who make below $100,000 a year
(and have typical assets of such
families), should enable every one
of those students who has been
offered admission to attend
Stanford in the fall," he said.
Although some universities.
Harvard and Princeton included,
have ended their early application
