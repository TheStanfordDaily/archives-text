instructor Scott Herndon's cozy, book
filled, closet-sized office. After staying up
until 6 a.m. decoding video for his latest
film, Herndon is somehow still full of life,
already joking with one of his Boothe
Prize-winning students over coffee.
Given Herndon's success as an aca
demic, artist and instructor, it's really no
surprise that he's packed with energy,
even on less than three hours of sleep.
He's an author of two books, coach of
four Boothe Prize winners and producer
of films that have become Sundance
finalists and made it to festivals such as
the International Feature Project (IFP) in
New York.
But the secret to his success lies
beyond his vibrant persona. Guiding both
his art and his teaching, Herndon has an
underlying philosophy that both artist
and student should work, in his words,
"over a void of uncertainty."
Herdon's philosophy was largely
inspired by Spanish artist Federico
Garcia Lorca and his hero, filmmaker Jim
Jarmusch.
"My love is Lorca and his notion of
'duende' — it's the idea that the artist
should court failure and be open to fail
ing." he said. "If you aren't on the brink of
failure, you aren't really doing art.
Jarmusch calls this amateurism. The idea
of the amateur for Jarmusch is that you
don't really know what you're doing but
you're doing it anyway. You're working
out over a void of uncertainty."
Herndon's tendency to take risks in
both his art and his teaching make him
what he describes as a bullfighter.

"We can understand duende in the
terms of a bull fighter," he said. "If you
aren't getting near the bull, you're not
really bull fighting."
Over the last 10 months, Herndon has
been engaged in producing his dark com
edy film,"Darker Everyday," often work
ing 60 hours a week on top of teaching
and having a baby.
"It was a deeply independent film."
Herndon said. "So basically I had a hand
in everything. I was the location manager,
the editor, the props designer — more or
less everything."
The film is a study on bad counseling.
It centers around a counselor who winds
up projecting his fantasies onto the mem
bers going through therapy at an addicts
meeting.
"The script grows out of a discomfort
I've always had in confessional meet
ings," Herndon said. "There's always
been something about the confessional
form that's false to me. Whenever I'm in
a meeting where confessionals are hap
pening. I invariably start wandering a
kind of mental space."
The hour-and-a-half movie is shot in a
real-time frame, and takes place over the
course of one meeting. As the members
of the meeting talk through their therapy,
Karl, the counselor, is daydreaming about
his own life and the life of the most beau
tiful woman in the room.
It's a twist on the classic film noir plot.
"We wanted to try to tell the story of
the noir in the form of a counselor rather
than a detective, where the counselor is
trying to pin down the mystery of who
this woman was in the most unprofes
sional way," Herndon said. "In the end
there isn't really anything mysterious
about this woman. All of the mystery and

all of the problem is in the counselor."
Herndon co-wrote and co-directed the
film with his friend Aaron Peters.
"We're kind of like stepbrothers;
we've been working together since col
lege," he said. "We don't really write with
each other, we write over each other. It's
a very violent process. I write 20 pages, he
takes it and changes it willy-nilly."
Herndon and Peters only allowed
themselves to write four or five drafts
before bringing the script to life.
"The escape hatch for our particular
method is that we create unscripted holes
for improvisation for our actors, and that
allows us to surprise ourselves," Herndon
said.
His affinity to risk is also reflected in
his casting. Of Herndon's 10 actors, only
one had acting experience.
"The essential idea of the movie was
that the whole movie would be per
formed art," he said. "So we put out a
casting call on Craigslist and said we'd
cast the movie in one day."
Herndon operated over the void of
uncertainty in both preproduction and
production. This, however, was paired
with the careful fine-tuning of editing.
The film was finished in late March, but
the editing process is still ongoing, with 15
drafts of the movie already made.
"I think it's an interesting dynamic
where we want an avant-garde improvi
sation and a courting of chaos when the
idea is being expressed and created, but
then it takes the rigor of a scientist and a
madman to chisel that thing into a prod
uct that doesn't seem like it was impro
vised." Herndon said. "And that's really I
think the magic of the artist — to trans
form the chaos of an initial idea into
something that appears as if it was

planned all along."
Herndon teaches PWR courses
"Strange Art. Stranger Fiction." "The
Ugly American" and "Stand Up." All his
classes have an artistic facet.
"The essay is an art form," he said.The
only way for it to blossom into an art
form is to lavish that kind of attention to
its details. Our movie certainly would be
illogical if it hadn't been subjected to that
rigorous examination by editing."
It is this type of creativity and scrutiny
that Herndon tries to teach his students
to approach in their writing.
"I think the aesthetic of the movie is as
close as I can get to the thinking I strive
to foster in mv classes," he said.
