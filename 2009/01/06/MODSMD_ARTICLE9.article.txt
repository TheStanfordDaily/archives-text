# Seis-ing up quakes — WITH LAPTOPS
## 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS 
Amateur earthquake enthusiasts,
rejoice! A collaborative team of seis
mologists led by Stanford professor
Jesse Lawrence and UC-Riverside
(UCR) Professor Elizabeth Cochran
has spearheaded a groundbreaking
project that allows laptop users to
join a global volunteer earthquake
detection crew.
The project, called the Quake-
Catcher Network (QCN), connects
internally supported accelerometer
laptops to an online server that
receives and aggregates seismic

movement data from individual
users' laptop accelerometers, or sen
sors.
If enough people worldwide con
nect to the network, the QCN will
have a grid of low-cost, low-sensitivi
ty at-home seismic stations that
spans the globe.
Lawrence and Cochran's idea for
the QCN was developed while the
two were post-docs at the Scripps
Institute of Oceanography at UC-
San Diego. Cochran was using a soft
ware widget called "SeisMac" — a
Mac application that provides an on
screen display of your computer's

accelerometer activity in seismo
graph form — when she realized that
SeisMac could be used to colled
rather than just display seismic
motion.
The two used start-up research
funds from Stanford and UCR to
improve the SeisMac software so
that it could collect seismic data from
laptop accelerometers. They then
used the open-source software
Berkeley Open Infrastructure for
Network Computing (BOINC) to
connect all the volunteer computers
to the network.
And with that,the QCN was born.
There are eurrently about 1,500
participating computers in the QCN.
But the QCN team is actively work
ing on improving technology for
USB-connectable accelerometers
that will bring desktop computers
into the QCN system.
"These palm-sized sensor devices
use the same accelerometer technol
ogy of a Wii controller but have

heightened sensitivity," Cochran
explained.
So far, Lawrence said that the
team has spent about $15,000 on soft
ware development equipment and
on I.(KK) USB accelerometers to be
sent out to K-12 schools for use in the
classroom.
Still, according to Lawrence, there
remains much work to be done.
"Right now. we have lots of seis
mometers out there, but it's a big
earth." he said. "If we really want to
get a good image of how the earth
quake is rupturing from initiation
through termination of the rupture,
we need to be able to have lots of
seismometers really up close. We also
need them to be fairly low-sensitivity
sensors because the high sensitivity
sensors go off scale if they're right on
top of the earthquake. So these USB
accelerometers are really ideal for
figuring out how earthquakes work."
Three-axis accelerometers, the
kind that the QCN is developing.

show three directions of motion
side-to-side, up-and-down, front-to
hack — just like a regular seismome
ter would.
" Ibese are essentially no different
from normal seismometers except
that they are extremely cheap,"
Lawrence explained. "Whereas the
two different accelerometers that we
use — one costs $30 and one costs
$ 150 — a regular seismometer would
cost more than $6,000. The trade-off
is that they don't go down to as low
sensitivity St) while we can't record
an earthquake as far away, we can
have a lot more sensors out there."
Because the QCN is still in its ini
tial phases of development,
Lawrence noted that all the integral
pieces are in order hut the network
has not been really tested.
"We don't have enough sensors
out there to do really high-quality
verifiable detections of large earth
quakes," he said. "[Laptop
accelerometers) are not sensitive to
the magnitude 1.0 or 2.0 that USGS
can record, so we need to wait until
the 4.0 earthquake to really test the
system. Once we get these USB
accelerometers, we'll be able to do
lots of tests and make the network
really work."
Yet. so far the QCN has worked.
For instance, the QCN was suc
cessful in detecting the 5.4 magnitude
temblor that rattled Los Angeles in
late July 2(X)8.
Eventually, the QCN team hopes
to partner with local governments to
transmit earthquake warnings right
before they hit.
"Right now, our aim is to detect
an earthquake as rapidly as possible
and digitally transmit the informa
tion about a big earthquake to sur
rounding areas before the energy of

the earthquake can expand outward
to those areas." Lawrence said. "In
that way, you can provide a few sec
onds warning before the energy actu
ally hits."
He explained that the software
detects the earthquake from the ini
tial vibrations through numerous lap
top-connected sensors near the
source of rupture. The system would
then proceed to transmit warnings
digitally to the people where the
energy has yet to hit.
"Because digital information trav
els virtually at the speed of light, the
warning can arrive before the actual
energy from the earthquake does,"
Lawrence said.
ITiis early-warning aspect of the
QCN drew Angie Chung, a first-year
Stanford graduate student in geo
physics. to work with Lawrence on
the project.
"T"he fact that the QCN can con
tribute to a type of early warning sys
tem that wiil in the future partner
with local governments is really
exciting," she said. "In the future,
when the software is more devel
oped. hopefully the network will be
able to notify local governments so
that people can get away from win
dows or under tables and provide a
crucial few seconds of prior notice."
To reach this stage, however, the
number of volunteer users must be
expanded.
"We would love it if every person
hooked up to the network —it
would make science better and glob
al safety that much better," Lawrence
said.

improve the SeisMac software so
that it could collect seismic data from
laptop accelerometers. They then
used the open-source software
Berkeley Open Infrastructure for
Network Computing (BOINC) to
connect all the volunteer computers
to the network.
And with that,the QCN was born.
There are eurrently about 1,500
participating computers in the QCN.
But the QCN team is actively work
ing on improving technology for
USB-connectable accelerometers
that will bring desktop computers
into the QCN system.
"These palm-sized sensor devices
use the same accelerometer technol
ogy of a Wii controller but have

heightened sensitivity," Cochran
explained.
So far, Lawrence said that the
team has spent about $15,000 on soft
ware development equipment and
on I.(KK) USB accelerometers to be
sent out to K-12 schools for use in the
classroom.
Still, according to Lawrence, there
remains much work to be done.
"Right now. we have lots of seis
mometers out there, but it's a big
earth." he said. "If we really want to
get a good image of how the earth
quake is rupturing from initiation
through termination of the rupture,
we need to be able to have lots of
seismometers really up close. We also
need them to be fairly low-sensitivity
sensors because the high sensitivity
sensors go off scale if they're right on
top of the earthquake. So these USB
accelerometers are really ideal for
figuring out how earthquakes work."
Three-axis accelerometers, the
kind that the QCN is developing.

show three directions of motion
side-to-side, up-and-down, front-to
hack — just like a regular seismome
ter would.
" Ibese are essentially no different
from normal seismometers except
that they are extremely cheap,"
Lawrence explained. "Whereas the
two different accelerometers that we
use — one costs $30 and one costs
$ 150 — a regular seismometer would
cost more than $6,000. The trade-off
is that they don't go down to as low
sensitivity St) while we can't record
an earthquake as far away, we can
have a lot more sensors out there."
Because the QCN is still in its ini
tial phases of development,
Lawrence noted that all the integral
pieces are in order hut the network
has not been really tested.
"We don't have enough sensors
out there to do really high-quality
verifiable detections of large earth
quakes," he said. "[Laptop
accelerometers) are not sensitive to
the magnitude 1.0 or 2.0 that USGS
can record, so we need to wait until
the 4.0 earthquake to really test the
system. Once we get these USB
accelerometers, we'll be able to do
lots of tests and make the network
really work."
Yet. so far the QCN has worked.
For instance, the QCN was suc
cessful in detecting the 5.4 magnitude
temblor that rattled Los Angeles in
late July 2(X)8.
Eventually, the QCN team hopes
to partner with local governments to
transmit earthquake warnings right
before they hit.
"Right now, our aim is to detect
an earthquake as rapidly as possible
and digitally transmit the informa
tion about a big earthquake to sur
rounding areas before the energy of

the earthquake can expand outward
to those areas." Lawrence said. "In
that way, you can provide a few sec
onds warning before the energy actu
ally hits."
He explained that the software
detects the earthquake from the ini
tial vibrations through numerous lap
top-connected sensors near the
source of rupture. The system would
then proceed to transmit warnings
digitally to the people where the
energy has yet to hit.
"Because digital information trav
els virtually at the speed of light, the
warning can arrive before the actual
energy from the earthquake does,"
Lawrence said.
ITiis early-warning aspect of the
QCN drew Angie Chung, a first-year
Stanford graduate student in geo
physics. to work with Lawrence on
the project.
"T"he fact that the QCN can con
tribute to a type of early warning sys
tem that wiil in the future partner
with local governments is really
exciting," she said. "In the future,
when the software is more devel
oped. hopefully the network will be
able to notify local governments so
that people can get away from win
dows or under tables and provide a
crucial few seconds of prior notice."
To reach this stage, however, the
number of volunteer users must be
expanded.
"We would love it if every person
hooked up to the network —it
would make science better and glob
al safety that much better," Lawrence
said.
