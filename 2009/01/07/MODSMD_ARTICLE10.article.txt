Gaza truce proposed after Israeli shell kills 30
France and Egypt announced an initiative to stop
the fighting in Gaza late Tuesday, hours after Israeli
mortar shells exploded near a U.N. school sheltering
hundreds of people displaced by the onslaught on
Hamas militants. At least 30 Palestinians died, staining
streets with blood.
The Egyptian and French presidents didn't release
details of their proposal, saying only that it involved an
immediate cease-fire to permit humanitarian aid into
Gaza and talks to settle the differences between Israel
and the Islamic militants of Hamas who rule the small
coastal territory.
They said they were awaiting a response from Israel.
Israeli officials in Jerusalem declined immediate com
ment on the announcement, which came amid diplo
matic efforts by the U.S. and other nations to resolve a
conflict that has seen 600 people killed in 11 days.
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice welcomed the
initiative, but cautioned that no agreement would suc
ceed unless it halted Hamas rocket attacks on Israel
and arms smuggling into Gaza.
Earlier in the day. President-elect Barack Obama
broke his silence on the crisis, saying that "the loss of
civilian life in Gaza and in Israel is a source of deep con
cern for me." He declined to go further, reiterating his
stance that the LIS. has only one president at a time.
