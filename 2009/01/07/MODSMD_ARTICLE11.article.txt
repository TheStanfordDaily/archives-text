Roland Burris failed to capture President-elect Barack
Obama's old Senate seat Tuesday in a wild piece of politi
cal theater, hut the Democrats' opposition cracked when a
key chairwoman said seating him was simply the legal
thing to do.
Democratic leaders,set to meet with Burris on Wednes
day, were searching for a way to defuse the dispute before
it further overshadows the 111 th Congress. Knowledge
able Senate officials of both parties widely predicted that
the saga would end with Burris being seated. They spoke
on condition of anonymity because they were not author
ized to speak publicly.
Seating Burris seemed more likely late Tuesday, when
Sen. Dianne Feinstein rejected the reasoning that all of the
chamber's Democrats, herself included, had cited in a let
ter last week â€” that corruption charges against Burris' pa
tron, Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich, tainted his appoint
ment.
"Does the governor have the power, under law, to make
the appointment? And the answer is yes," said Feinstein,
chairwoman of the Senate Rules Committee, which judges
the credentials of senators.
Burris marched into the Capitol earlier Tuesday, declar
ing himself "the junior senator from the state of Illinois."
But Secretary of the Senate Nancy Erickson rejected his
certification, as he knew she would,saying it lacked Illinois
Secretary of State Jesse White's signature and the state
seal.
Late Tuesday. Feinstein urged the Senate to settle the
matter.
"If you don't seat Mr. Burris, it has ramifications for gu
bernatorial appointments all over America,"the Califor
nia senator said. "Mr. Burris is a senior, experienced politi
cian. He has been attorney general, he has been controller,
and he is very well-respected. I am hopeful that this will be
settled."
A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid
did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Earlier, Reid had said. "Mr. Burris is not in possession
of the necessary credentials from the state of Illinois."
Burris, meanwhile, pivoted from his rejection at the
Capitol to the Illinois Supreme Court, asking it to order
White to certify his appointment.
Burris was expected to meet with Reid on Wednesday.
It would be his second appearance at the Capitol in as
many days. His first included an escort by Capitol police of

ficers to Erickson's third-floor office for what was de
scribed as a highly cordial, 21 -minute meeting.
Burris, 71, then led a small mob of lawyers, consultants,
police and reporters across the street in pouring rain, to a
news conference which Burris aides said Reid had tacitlv

allowed.
Erickson, Burris reported, had advised him that "I
would not be accepted, and I will not be seated, and I will
not be permitted on the floor."
The former Illinois attorney general said he was "not
seeking to have any type of confrontation" over taking the
seat. In addition to his court filing late in the day in Illinois,
Burris said he was considering a federal lawsuit to force
Senate Democrats to seat him.
It was a distraction for majority Democrats eager to
project an image of progress with Obama on an economic
stimulus package estimated to cost as much as $8(X) billion.
Democrats and Obama have said that the corruption
charges against Blagojevich would strip credibility from
anyone he appointed to the seat.
Blagojevich denies federal accusations that he tried to
sell the seat Obama has given up for the presidency.
In a written statement Tuesday, the governor said alle
gations against him shouldn't be held against Burris, whom
he called a "good and decent man."
"The people of Illinois are entitled to be represented by
two senators in the United States Senate," Blagojevich
said.
