## Editorial Admission office handles early applications well 
### 
The editorial board would like to extend
its congratulations to the 689 high
school seniors admitted early to the
Class of 2013. Your accomplishments — aca
demic, extracurricular and otherwise — are
surely incredible, and we are so excited to
have you join us next year. We hope that,
when you come to visit our campus during
Admit Weekend in late April, you feel as
much at home here as we do. Stanford Uni
versity has an incredible amount to offer you,
and we look forward to welcoming you into
our student body next September.
This fall, the Office of Undergraduate Ad
mission received 5,363 single-choice early
applications — more than ever before. De
spite the assuredly overwhelming number of
highly qualified applicants, staff at the Office
of Admission were able to read through the
broad pool and select only the finest for our
university. We appreciate all of their work at
soliciting and reading applications, as well as
all the long hours they surely pulled in No
vember and December.
Additionally, we would like to commend
the Office of Undergraduate Admission for
wisely accepting the smallest percentage of
early applicants—l2.B percent — to date.
While accepting the smallest percentage of
applicants at first may seem like an odd thing
to praise — the addition of fewer, rather
than more, promising students to our com
munity — this record low number of admis
sions is. in fact, based on sound decision mak
ing.
Stanford cannot risk admitting too large a
number of students come April 1 and wind
up over-admitting students. Stanford's yield
rate has risen over the last few years, and the
school has found itself with more students
than it intended. Several Ivy League schools,
however, admitted a lower number of stu
dents than Stanford and utilized their wait
lists to fill extra spots last year.
The Office of Undergraduate Admission
made a laudable decision by taking fewer
rather than more students in light of the cur
rent financial crisis and budget situation. If
the number of matriculated students contin
ues to rise. Stanford will find itself overbur
dened. The University would be forced to
contend with expanding freshman course of
ferings and most importantly, coping with an
even tighter housing crunch. Last year. Bur
bank was converted to an all-frosh dorm
when the largest-ever percentage of admit
ted students enrolled.
In addition, the University's endowment
and ability to provide aid has shrunken re
markably after Stanford announced a broad,
new financial aid policy last year. We are
proud of Stanford's continued commitment
to this program in spite of the budget crisis.

but this makes keeping the admission rate in
check all the more important. Stanford must
ensure that it can extend its aid package to all
admitted students who qualify before it
thinks of increasing the freshman class size.

"Stanford cannot risk
admitting too large a
number of students
come April 1."

In light of this, the editorial board cau
tions the Office of Admission to stick to its
current course and not admit an overwhelm
ing number of students for the Class of 2013.
While the editorial board encourages the ad
ministration and student body to engage in a
thorough discussion about potentially in
creasing the availability of a Stanford educa
tion to more students, over-enrollment with
out a clear strategy is undesirable to the well
being of the University. Should Stanford
choose to expand the size of the undergradu
ate student body, the plan should be carried
out only in a methodical and thoughtful man
ner.
Though we strongly suggest the Office of
Admission prevent over-enrollment as much
as possible, we are also strongly in favor of
keeping the single-choice early action pro
gram. Despite the abolishment of similar
programs at peer universities in the last sev
eral years, we feel that the early action pro
gram provides an inestimable opportunity
for students for whom Stanford is clearly the
first-choice school to declare as such.
While some have argued that an early ac
tion program favors those at the higher end
of the socio-economic spectrum, we feel that
Stanford's commitment to increased socio
economic diversity negates any potential
negative effect this may have. The single
choice early action program truly allows stu
dents to demonstrate a committed interest,
and, for those accepted, to feel a decrease in
their stress levels as they complete the re
mainder of their applications.
With this in mind, the editorial board
would like to praise the Office of Admission
for doing a fantastic job with early decisions.
We hope they continue this trend in the
spring and for years to come.
