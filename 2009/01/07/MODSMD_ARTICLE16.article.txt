# Executive Experiences
## The 						new (gotcha) media 
### 
-2(X)8 was a banner year for what is now ap
parently being called "citizen journalism."
I"he existence of water on Mars was publi
cized not by NASA, but by Twitter — as were
the earthquakes in China. Television journalist
Tim Russert's death was first announced not on
his employing network NBC as had been pro
tocol in such circumstances, but by an anony
mous edit to his Wikipedia page, made before
his family was alerted of his passing.
It is self-evident that as traditional media
outlets (read: print newspapers) continue to
downsize their staff and technological advances
make the dissemination of current events a col
lective endeavor, the barrier between plebe and
reporter becomes increasingly obsolete.
We are all journalists.and in a way that seems
both sensible and appropriate. If a citizen jour
nalist witnesses an important event before a
bona fide professional,then why shouldn't he or
she share it? And al a moment of debatably un
surpassed political engagement in America, the
democratization of news gathering is an effec
tive way to maintain this fervor.
The paradigm shift from journalism as the
duty of the privileged few to journalism as a
free-for-all has occurred so rapidly as to seem
both inevitable and inviolate. Still, we can sense
when a line has been crossed; the announce
ment of Russert's death could have been de
layed for two hours with no consequences for
the public, especially when compared to the
consequences for his family.
Itie argument that standards must be put
into place for new media reporting, along with
the companion argument about the impossibil
ity of enforcing such standards, is an old one.
What has not been sufficiently discussed is
whether this brave new reporting is not. in cer
tain situations, self-defeating.
Citizen journalism promises unprecedented
immediacy; we therefore assume that it will en
courage greater candor and richer discourse. In
particular, we hope it will bring us closer to those
who lead us, whose opinions and actions we are
so anxious to know.
But citizen journalists, armed with all the
privilege of old-school reporters and none of
the ethical obligations, only drive us further
from this possible synergy. Continuously poised

to make even the most off-handed comment a
viral spectacle, citizen journalists simultaneous
ly demand communication with politicians and
discourage them from speaking frankly.The re
sult is an inundation of dialogue paired with a
scarcity of substance that has already been evi
denced in the recent presidential election and
will no doubt characterize the way we interface
with our leaders — or don't — for a long time.
Consider one of the more ambiguously ethi
cal uses of citizen journalism over the past year:
Mavhill Fowler attended a private dinner in
support of Barack Obama this past April. It was
at this event that Obama made his now infa
mous comment about those heartland Ameri
cans who "cling to guns and religion," which
Fowler duly noted and published on Huffington
Post.
Traditionally, members of the press have
been obligated to declare themselves as such
when appearing at any sort of public gathering.
Fowler declined to do so. yet her experience of
the event was utilized to shape a news story
about Obama's comment on what media serv
ice company Technorati recently ranked as the
most popular blog on the Internet.
It has been argued that Obama 4'd not de
serve protection from Fowler. Obama made his
comment in front of a group.after all, and poten
tial voters elsewhere have a right to additional
information that would give them a sense of
who they may be endorsing.
Such contentions are valid until studied in a
larger context. [Obama thought he was speak
ing to a group of supporters in confidence, and
he directed his speech towards them.) Was the
insight that an undecided voter gained from this
sound bite worth the price of increased recalci
trance on Obama's part overall?
Obama is constantly engaging with the
media (in the month following his election, he
set the record for number of press conferences
held by a President-elect), but his appearances
are so tightly managed as to make the endeavor
all but worthless.The Washington Post suggest
ed that the journalists who interviewed Obama
in the wake of his election may have been "pre
selected by his aides."The New York Times has
quoted several of Obama's advisors as acknowl
edging that their strategv for media manage

ment parallels that of the Bush administration
in its structure and rigorousness.
We can all agree that politicians as a group
talk too much and do too little, but the vigilance
of millions of bloggers and Twitterers necessi
tates an unprecedented level of information
control. The desire of citizen journalists to cir
cumvent the bureaucracy inherent in tradition
al journalistic practices is understandable, but
their methods are self-defeating. The harder
they press, the more elusive Obama and his ilk
become,generating a continuous feed of babble
all the while.
In the act of running for public office, politi
cal leaders implicitly agree to be forthright and
responsible in all their dealings, and to make
themselves available to public scrutiny. The
media is integral to guaranteeing the ethicality
of politicians; as such, it should not have to rely
on fraudulent techniques to do so.
We've already seen how, in the announce
ment of Russert's death, citizen journalism can
violate ethical boundaries — and how, on a
pragmatic level, it threatens to further erode the
quality of political discourse.
There is. of course, no way to guarantee that
everyone with a story and an Internet connec
tion considers the implications of his or her ac
tions. As such, it falls to those who provide a
forum for new media reporting to punish those
who act inappropriately.
The person who updated Russert's
Wikipedia entry early was fired from his or her
job at Internet Broadcasting Services (in spite of
— or should I say. because of — pleading igno
rance at the implications of the gesture). If I iuff
ington would hold her contributors to similar
standards, that would be a good place to start.
When Governor Sarah Palin complained
about the "gotcha media." we all laughed at her.
Journalists worth their salt ask hard questions,
fact-check and follow up But good journalists
also respect themselves and their readers
enough to do the task with integrity, while doing
it well, and the rest of us could learn from them.
The future of political discourse depends on it.

both sensible and appropriate. If a citizen jour
nalist witnesses an important event before a
bona fide professional,then why shouldn't he or
she share it? And al a moment of debatably un
surpassed political engagement in America, the
democratization of news gathering is an effec
tive way to maintain this fervor.
The paradigm shift from journalism as the
duty of the privileged few to journalism as a
free-for-all has occurred so rapidly as to seem
both inevitable and inviolate. Still, we can sense
when a line has been crossed; the announce
ment of Russert's death could have been de
layed for two hours with no consequences for
the public, especially when compared to the
consequences for his family.
Itie argument that standards must be put
into place for new media reporting, along with
the companion argument about the impossibil
ity of enforcing such standards, is an old one.
What has not been sufficiently discussed is
whether this brave new reporting is not. in cer
tain situations, self-defeating.
Citizen journalism promises unprecedented
immediacy; we therefore assume that it will en
courage greater candor and richer discourse. In
particular, we hope it will bring us closer to those
who lead us, whose opinions and actions we are
so anxious to know.
But citizen journalists, armed with all the
privilege of old-school reporters and none of
the ethical obligations, only drive us further
from this possible synergy. Continuously poised

to make even the most off-handed comment a
viral spectacle, citizen journalists simultaneous
ly demand communication with politicians and
discourage them from speaking frankly.The re
sult is an inundation of dialogue paired with a
scarcity of substance that has already been evi
denced in the recent presidential election and
will no doubt characterize the way we interface
with our leaders — or don't — for a long time.
Consider one of the more ambiguously ethi
cal uses of citizen journalism over the past year:
Mavhill Fowler attended a private dinner in
support of Barack Obama this past April. It was
at this event that Obama made his now infa
mous comment about those heartland Ameri
cans who "cling to guns and religion," which
Fowler duly noted and published on Huffington
Post.
Traditionally, members of the press have
been obligated to declare themselves as such
when appearing at any sort of public gathering.
Fowler declined to do so. yet her experience of
the event was utilized to shape a news story
about Obama's comment on what media serv
ice company Technorati recently ranked as the
most popular blog on the Internet.
It has been argued that Obama 4'd not de
serve protection from Fowler. Obama made his
comment in front of a group.after all, and poten
tial voters elsewhere have a right to additional
information that would give them a sense of
who they may be endorsing.
Such contentions are valid until studied in a
larger context. [Obama thought he was speak
ing to a group of supporters in confidence, and
he directed his speech towards them.) Was the
insight that an undecided voter gained from this
sound bite worth the price of increased recalci
trance on Obama's part overall?
Obama is constantly engaging with the
media (in the month following his election, he
set the record for number of press conferences
held by a President-elect), but his appearances
are so tightly managed as to make the endeavor
all but worthless.The Washington Post suggest
ed that the journalists who interviewed Obama
in the wake of his election may have been "pre
selected by his aides."The New York Times has
quoted several of Obama's advisors as acknowl
edging that their strategv for media manage

ment parallels that of the Bush administration
in its structure and rigorousness.
We can all agree that politicians as a group
talk too much and do too little, but the vigilance
of millions of bloggers and Twitterers necessi
tates an unprecedented level of information
control. The desire of citizen journalists to cir
cumvent the bureaucracy inherent in tradition
al journalistic practices is understandable, but
their methods are self-defeating. The harder
they press, the more elusive Obama and his ilk
become,generating a continuous feed of babble
all the while.
In the act of running for public office, politi
cal leaders implicitly agree to be forthright and
responsible in all their dealings, and to make
themselves available to public scrutiny. The
media is integral to guaranteeing the ethicality
of politicians; as such, it should not have to rely
on fraudulent techniques to do so.
We've already seen how, in the announce
ment of Russert's death, citizen journalism can
violate ethical boundaries — and how, on a
pragmatic level, it threatens to further erode the
quality of political discourse.
There is. of course, no way to guarantee that
everyone with a story and an Internet connec
tion considers the implications of his or her ac
tions. As such, it falls to those who provide a
forum for new media reporting to punish those
who act inappropriately.
The person who updated Russert's
Wikipedia entry early was fired from his or her
job at Internet Broadcasting Services (in spite of
— or should I say. because of — pleading igno
rance at the implications of the gesture). If I iuff
ington would hold her contributors to similar
standards, that would be a good place to start.
When Governor Sarah Palin complained
about the "gotcha media." we all laughed at her.
Journalists worth their salt ask hard questions,
fact-check and follow up But good journalists
also respect themselves and their readers
enough to do the task with integrity, while doing
it well, and the rest of us could learn from them.
The future of political discourse depends on it.
