## Geico: So simple, a Stanford student didn't get it 
### 
How would you like it if all the money
you could have saved on your car in
surance was a bundle of cash that con
stantly watched you with an ever-so-slight
smile, your own personal green bundle of
buyer's regret?
In the typical far-fetched style of Geico's
advertising — a caveman ordering gourmet
food at a restaurant, a talking gecko with a
cockney accent — this is exactly the scenario
explored in their newest ad campaign, recent
ly launched in December. And that very bun
dle of money, named Kash. is the latest and
greenest mascot to join the likes of the gecko,
the cavemen and the various other faces of
Geico ads that have amused and entertained
us for years.
Yet unlike the concept of the beloved
Geico gecko, which is based on a somewhat
clever wordplay, the concept of Kash does not
even make an attempt at wit. Kash is just a
wad of, well, cash, with two googly eyes that
stare mutely at potential Geico customers like
the Ghost of Christmas Past, an eerie re
minder of the savings that could have been if
they had only switched to Geico.
In one of the released commercials featur
ing Geico's new star, a woman giggles inanely
at Kash while she's on a date with someone
else, flirting more with the silent bundle than
her actual date. When the waiter tells her that
Kash is the money she would have saved with
Geico, the woman replies, "I know," with an
expression of regret that is just as vacuous as
her giggle. Then a shot of Kash staring at the
camera is accompanied by a remake of Rock
well's 19K4 hit "Somebody's Watching Me," a
song whose lyrics describe the fear of being
watched by entities such as the neighbors, the
mailman and even the IRS — in short, con

sumer paranoia at its finest.
The idea behind the commercial is the
Geico premise in its most uncomplicated
form: Kash, literally the $500 that Geico al
legedly saves its customers, "watches" all the
suckers who haven't been savvy enough to
jump on the Geico bandwagon. Mike Lear,
the associate creative director at the firm han
dling Geico's advertising,The Martin Agency,
neatly summarized their marketing strategy:
"We just dumbed it down to the most basic
thing in the world, i want more money.'" Of
course, this idea has technically been the foun
dation of Geico's marketing for years — ex
cept now, instead of sending the message cre
atively, it seems that Geico has decided that
people nowadays are just too flighty (or too
thick) to understand anything more than wav
ing cold, hard cash right in front of their eyes.
So what's the problem with launching an
ad campaign that is so elementary it practical
ly insults one's intelligence? Unfortunately
for Geico, our brains have evolved — and
after leading us to expect cleverness from
their ads,Geico has now launched a campaign
so plain and simple that it leaves us scratching
our heads and thinking, "What the hell was
that?"
Well, it is certainly not anything we would
have seen coming — especially since it poses
such a stark contrast to the earlier Geico cave
man concept, an ad campaign so wildly suc
cessful it even snagged its own ABC spinoff
"Cavemen" in 2007.Those ads featured cave
men who were well-spoken, social and intelli
gent beings, participating in enough tennis and
therapy to rival any self-respecting WASP.
When confronted by the new Geico slogan.
"Geico: So easy, a caveman could do it," they
were insulted and outraged because they were

actually more moneyed and cultured than
most modern-day people.The concept was ab
surd enough to he hilarious.
Yet in this new Geico commercial, the
woman flirting with Kash is neither bizarrely
intellectual nor proud of her circumstances;
rather, she comes off as inconsiderate, irre
sponsible and, frankly, stupid. She is aware
that she is potentially losing money by not
switching to Geico, but all she can do about it
is flirt with the wad of cash like some air-head
ed gold digger trying to strike it big. Instead of
making cavemen seem smarter than they
should be. this new ad bafflingly makes people
seem stupider than they should be. Is choosing
Geico so easy that a human can't even manage
to do it?
It may be true that we Americans do not al
ways use our higher brain functions, and that
we have not always been smart about money
— mistakes for which we are now paying in
full. Yet it is also grossly unfair to assume that
we have completely lost our taste for appreci
ating a bit of ingenuity in the advertisements
that are thrown at us daily. We arc not mind
less drones with dollar signs rattling around in
our otherwise empty skulls. The human brain
just happens to be the most sophisticated one
on the planet, which certainly affords us the
ability to value even the least bit of sophistica
tion in return.
So. to conclude with a brief message to
Geico: Stop being lazy — and for God's sake,
come up with something that shows at least
one iota of thought behind it before expecting
us to trust you with our money.
