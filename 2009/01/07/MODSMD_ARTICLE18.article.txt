## Israel's unfortunate last resort 
### 
In order to fairly pass judgment on Is
rael's recent strike on Gaza, one must
chronicle the events and context leading
up to it and the military intent of each side.
In 2006. after Israel handed the com
plete civilian control of Gaza to Palestinian
authorities, Hamas terrorists crossed into
mainland Israel and kidnapped 19-year-old
Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, and continue to
hold him captive today.
Hamas, whose charter specifically delin
eates its intent to exterminate the Jewish
state, has showered southern Israel with
over 5.000 Qassam rockets aimed at
schools, hospitals and houses in Beersheva,
Sdetot, Ashkelon and other Israeli cities in
the south, including attacks that violated a
six-month ceasefire in November.
The provocation? Not Israeli military
control. Not Israeli occupation. Not Israeli
settlements.These were all removed in Sep
tember 2005, when Israel withdrew its oc
cupancy from Gaza. There's only one mo
tive and Hamas is very candid about it: Is
rael's very existence.
I lamas must be condemned for the little
to no value that it places on human life,
even that of its own Palestinian citizens,
llamas is notorious for strategically locat
ing its weapons, rockets and explosive
stockpiles in its most densely civilian popu
lated areas. By using its civilians as human
shields, Hamas ensures that when Israel is
provoked into attacking these weapons tar
gets, a disproportionate amount of Pales
tinian civilians are inevitably killed, gener
ating overwhelming international sympa
thy and support in favor of Hamas and
against Israel.
Hamas exploits the West's sense of
morality as a tactic against Israel, and
forces Israel to decide between enduring

rocket attacks on its own citizens or inad
vertently inflicting pain on Palestinian
civilians by acting to stop the assault. In ad
dition. Hamas' Qassam rocket attacks are
aimed at civilians with the intention of
killing civilians.
Conversely, Israel takes precautionary
measures to minimize civilian casualties.
The Associated Press has reported that
thousands of Gazans received Arabic-lan
guage cell phone messages from the Israeli
military before the strike began, urging
them to leave homes where militants might
have stashed weapons. These warnings,
aimed at saving Palestinian lives, have the
unintended consequence of revealing vital
information to Hamas on Israel's intended
targets, compromising Israel's mission.
Note that while Israel's strike on Gaza
was ongoing, Uganda-based rebels massa
cred over 400 civilians, abducted over 20
children, forced over 30.000 more to flee
their homes and raped and pillaged the
northeastern Congo. This crisis was barely
reported by the mainstream media, which
was more intent on scrutinizing Israel than
reporting all necessary stories in a fair and
proportionate manner.
Unlike the Ugandan rebels. Israel acted
in self-defense and with concern for civil
ians on both sides. If rockets were raining
down on San Diego from the border, the
United States would act quickly and deci
sively to end it, and would not settle for an
untenable cease-fire. As President-elect
Barack Obama proclaimed, "If somebody
was sending rockets into my house where
my two daughters sleep at night. I would do
everything to stop that, and would expect
Israel to do the same thing."
