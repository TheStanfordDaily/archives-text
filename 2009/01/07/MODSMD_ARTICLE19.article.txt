## No rest for Card Stanford completes a packed December 
### NATE ADAMS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While most other Stanford students were recuperating
from fall quarter and celebrating the holidays, the Cardinal
women's basketball team had a busy winter break, playing
in a total of seven games in three different time /ones. After
a stellar 6-1 start, the Cardinal showed some weaknesses for
the first time this season but continued its overall strong
play. After going 5-2 against tough opponents over the
break.the Cardinal dropped from N0.5 to No. 11, going 11-
3 on the year, including wins in its first two conference
matchups.
Fresh off final exams, the Cardinal women started their
"break" with a l(X)-62 blowout of Fresno State, which had
upset then-No. 22 TCU only a week before. Freshman
Nneka Ogwumike, who replaced injured senior Jillian Har
mon in her first start.had a huge game with 19 points. Ogwu
mike now has 14<) points on the season, good for fourth on
the team.
Stanford head coachTara VanDerveer was pleased with
her team's fast start after the longest break of the season.
"1 thought our team really came out excited to play after
being off for two weeks."she told GoStanford.com."l'm re
ally pleased with how Nneka came right into our starting
lineup."
The Cardinal, then N0.3 in the country.left California for
its next three games, making a sweep through the Southeast
against teams that looked a bit more like NCAA Tourna
ment contenders: Duke. South Carolina and Tennessee.
Stanford suffered a tough loss against then-No. 8 Duke,
who improved 53-4 in non-conference games at home in the
past eight seasons with the win.The matchup was scheduled
by VanDerveer, who was looking to get the Cardinal some
valuable regular season experience against a high-profile
opponent.
The Blue Devils made a huge comeback after a sluggish
start, and ultimately pulled ahead of Stanford. The Cardinal
was trailing just 54-52 with over a minute left.but a set of free
throws — including one generated by an impressive re
bound by Karima Christmas — gave the Blue Devils a four
point lead with under 20 seconds left, sealing the victory for
Duke.
Stanford bounced back in a dominant 78-47 victory over

South Carolina. The women out-rebounded the Game
cocks 53-21. and sophomore Kayla Pedersen and junior
Jayne Appel each had double-doubles.
Tennessee, then No. 11. handed the Cardinal its toughest
loss of the season after taking Stanford to overtime, winning
7y-69.The game was a rematch of last year's national cham
pionship — the outcome was the same.
Lady Vol Shakinna Stricklen, who had been suffering
from a debilitating stomach virus only a few days earlier,led
her team with 25 points, including eight after regulation ex
pired. Appel and sophomore Jeanette Pohlen each posted
double-doubles for a second consecutive game, but Van-
Derveer was disappointed with how her team performed
overall.
"We missed a lot of five-foot shots and we missed a lot of
free throws," she said. "You can't make those mistakes. We
paid for it."
Stanford dropped to No. 11 after the loss, and after
Christmas headed back to the Farm for its final non-confer
ence match, against UC-Davis. Despite drubbing the scrap
py Aggies 84-49.and having four players score over a dozen
points, the Cardinal looked offensively uncoordinated for
most of the game. The Stanford women attempted nine
three-point tries in a row to start the game.and tried 36 shots
from behind the arc overall, but only netted nine of those
shots.
The Aggies, meanwhile, nearly doubled Stanford's accu
racy from beyond the line, hitting 11 threes on 45.8 percent
shooting. Following the game. Appel was named the U.S.
Bank Pacific-10 Conference Player of the Week for the sec
ond time this season.
The sloppy win over Davis was evidently an adequate
tune-up for conference play, however, as the Cardinal came
out of its first Pac-10 matchups — on the road against Ari
zona State and Arizona — with two victories.
Against Arizona State. Harmon led the team with 18
points and 10 rebounds en route to a 64-61 victory over the
Sun Devils, dropping ASU to 8-5. Stanford trailed 31-24 at
halftime and was at one point down 40-26: the women were
able to rally back behind Harmon and Pedersen. who had
17 points of her own. It was the first victory for the Cardinal
after trailing at the half.

Sophomore Kayla Pedersen and her Stanford teammates began the new year
by knocking off their first Pac-10 opponents, Arizona and Arizona State. The
Cardinal has its home opener this weekend against the Washington schools.
Stanford improved to 2-0 in Pac-10
play with a 70-61 win over Arizona two
days later, dominating the game most of
the way. Stanford had four players with
double-digit point totals (Pohlen.Ogwu
mike, Appel and Harmon), and at one
point led by 25 points.
As the Cardinal gets into the full
swing of its Pac-10 schedule, the Stan
ford women have made it clear that thev

are legitimate contenders with depth
and resiliency. They've come back from
each loss with a big win by at least 30
points and have begun to compensate
for the loss of their starting point guard,
junior JJ. Hones, who is out for the sea
son with a torn ACL and had surgery on
her knee just before the new year.
The Cardinal will play its first Pac-10
games at home this week, hosting Wash
ington and Washington State on Thurs
day at 7 p.m. and Saturday at 2 p.m., re
spectively.

7y-69.The game was a rematch of last year's national cham
pionship — the outcome was the same.
Lady Vol Shakinna Stricklen, who had been suffering
from a debilitating stomach virus only a few days earlier,led
her team with 25 points, including eight after regulation ex
pired. Appel and sophomore Jeanette Pohlen each posted
double-doubles for a second consecutive game, but Van-
Derveer was disappointed with how her team performed
overall.
"We missed a lot of five-foot shots and we missed a lot of
free throws," she said. "You can't make those mistakes. We
paid for it."
Stanford dropped to No. 11 after the loss, and after
Christmas headed back to the Farm for its final non-confer
ence match, against UC-Davis. Despite drubbing the scrap
py Aggies 84-49.and having four players score over a dozen
points, the Cardinal looked offensively uncoordinated for
most of the game. The Stanford women attempted nine
three-point tries in a row to start the game.and tried 36 shots
from behind the arc overall, but only netted nine of those
shots.
The Aggies, meanwhile, nearly doubled Stanford's accu
racy from beyond the line, hitting 11 threes on 45.8 percent
shooting. Following the game. Appel was named the U.S.
Bank Pacific-10 Conference Player of the Week for the sec
ond time this season.
The sloppy win over Davis was evidently an adequate
tune-up for conference play, however, as the Cardinal came
out of its first Pac-10 matchups — on the road against Ari
zona State and Arizona — with two victories.
Against Arizona State. Harmon led the team with 18
points and 10 rebounds en route to a 64-61 victory over the
Sun Devils, dropping ASU to 8-5. Stanford trailed 31-24 at
halftime and was at one point down 40-26: the women were
able to rally back behind Harmon and Pedersen. who had
17 points of her own. It was the first victory for the Cardinal
after trailing at the half.


MASARU OKA/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore Kayla Pedersen and her Stanford teammates began the new year
by knocking off their first Pac-10 opponents, Arizona and Arizona State. The
Cardinal has its home opener this weekend against the Washington schools.
Stanford improved to 2-0 in Pac-10
play with a 70-61 win over Arizona two
days later, dominating the game most of
the way. Stanford had four players with
double-digit point totals (Pohlen.Ogwu
mike, Appel and Harmon), and at one
point led by 25 points.
As the Cardinal gets into the full
swing of its Pac-10 schedule, the Stan
ford women have made it clear that thev

are legitimate contenders with depth
and resiliency. They've come back from
each loss with a big win by at least 30
points and have begun to compensate
for the loss of their starting point guard,
junior JJ. Hones, who is out for the sea
son with a torn ACL and had surgery on
her knee just before the new year.
The Cardinal will play its first Pac-10
games at home this week, hosting Wash
ington and Washington State on Thurs
day at 7 p.m. and Saturday at 2 p.m., re
spectively.
