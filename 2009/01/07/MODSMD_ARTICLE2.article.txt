## Students petition Jamba Juice 
### JENNY REMPEL STAFF WRITER 
Over 1.6(X) Stanford affiliates signed a peti
tion initiated last quarter to end the use of
Styrofoam cups and packaging materials by the
Jamba Juice on campus. But the store now has
a new manager, and the group's efforts may be
thwarted at the corporate level.
Theo Ciibbs "11 initiated the petition along
with Students for a Sustainable Stanford (SSS).
The petition highlights several of the "environ
mental health hazards" caused by expanded
polystyrene, or Styrofoam. and appeals to the
notion that the Stanford campus should set an
example by becoming more environmentally
friendly.
Ciibbs said inspiration for the petition came
from several sources, but she was particularly
motivated by similar bans on Styrofoam in San
Francisco and Oakland.
The previous manager of Stanford's Jamba
Juice agreed that if S(X) students signed a peti
tion regarding the use of Styrofoam. the store
would attempt to change their packaging to a
fiber-based material instead.
Through her work with SSS and several
other environmental groups on campus. Ciibbs
was able to realize the importance of student
activism in promoting small changes.
"The previous manager said that if there
was significant student support demonstrated,
they could consider it and try to change the
packaging material." she said. "Students really
have a unique power to make a difference on
college campuses."
A link to the online petition was sent out to
many Stanford email lists in an effort to attract
signatories. Since then, hundreds of students

"it was just an email spam tnat i cnecKeu
out." said Doug Witt '09. "I'm just a big believ
er in doing the little things in life to make the
world a better place. I saw the petition and it
made sense to me, so I signed it."
This may. however, be more difficult than
the petition's creators thought it would be.
The Jamba Juice manager whom Gibbs
contacted is no longer with the store, and rep
resentatives at the corporate office contacted
bv I"he Daily were not even aware of the peti
tion.
"I don't know anything about [the peti
tion]." said Dunia Flores, the new manager,
"and my position is such that, even if I wanted
to make this change. 1 couldn't."
Despite this setback, Gibbs is still optimistic.
"It's a little bit discouraging, but I think it's

" i wouiu love to see tne same initiative
rolled out in the Axe and Palm." said petition
signatory Belinda Chiang" lO.'i abhor their use
of Styrofoam for their take-out boxes and for
their water cups."
Despite the demonstrated enthusiasm.
Ciibbs said she is wary of sending out too many
petitions for fear that the movement would
lose impact if the necessary groundwork is not
already in place. Still, she remains optimistic
not only about the petition but also future sus
tainability measures.
"There's still a lot more that needs to be
done." she said."and Stanford can still take the
leading edge on many of these environmental
issues."
