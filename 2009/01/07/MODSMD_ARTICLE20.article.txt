# Dawkins lights up the Farm

Sometimes it's tough to admit when
you're just fiat out wrong. I know
this to be true! perhaps more than
most. When you predict, to a diehard
Florida fanatic.thatTimTebow is sure to
win his second Heisman Trophy in as
many years only to watch moments later
as Sam Bradford accepts the award,
that's bad. When you call the Detroit
Lions a major sleeper candidate in 2(X)8.
that's worse.
Okay.so I've actually only done half
of those things. But at one point last year
I also berated the Stanford establish
ment in this very column for letting
Trent Johnson walk. We'd already lost
the Lopez twins. I reasoned at the time,
and now we're adding instability at head
coach to the mix? A surer recipe for dis
aster I couldn't fathom at the time.
But this time around.it's much easier
to be wrong. Because while Johnson cer
tainly had his merits, as he demonstrated
here, at Nevada and is currently doing at
LSU (the Tigers are 12-2), I feel confi
dent in saying the Cardinal got the bet
ter of last offseason's coaching carousel.
Granted, it's still incredibly early in
the Johnny Dawkins era. Granted, we
are less than a week removed from the
Cardinal falling by 30 in an absolute
blowout loss in its first real test of the
season. Granted, there are many more
tests ahead before we can officially
anoint Dawkins a Stanford legend in the
making.
But in just 12 games,the rookie head
coach has shown me something. Be
cause, while Johnson performed reason
ably well with players Mike Mont
gomery recruited and the God's-gift-to-
Stanford-basketball-7-foot-tall Lopez
twins, it was becoming clear that there
could be dark days ahead for the Cardi
nal. Believe it or not. a pair of big-nien
phenoms like that doesn't come along
just every day,and s(x>n we would all see
exactly what Johnson had in him as a
coach.
We will never know whether he
would have succeeded or not with a
roster devoid of 7-foot serendipity and
only his own recruits to call on. But
Dawkins is succeeding, right now, in the
situation that had Stanford fans decid
edly nervous even before the old coach
