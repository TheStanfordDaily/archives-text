# Dawkins lights up the Farm

Sometimes it's tough to admit when
you're just fiat out wrong. I know
this to be true! perhaps more than
most. When you predict, to a diehard
Florida fanatic.thatTimTebow is sure to
win his second Heisman Trophy in as
many years only to watch moments later
as Sam Bradford accepts the award,
that's bad. When you call the Detroit
Lions a major sleeper candidate in 2(X)8.
that's worse.
Okay.so I've actually only done half
of those things. But at one point last year
I also berated the Stanford establish
ment in this very column for letting
Trent Johnson walk. We'd already lost
the Lopez twins. I reasoned at the time,
and now we're adding instability at head
coach to the mix? A surer recipe for dis
aster I couldn't fathom at the time.
But this time around.it's much easier
to be wrong. Because while Johnson cer
tainly had his merits, as he demonstrated
here, at Nevada and is currently doing at
LSU (the Tigers are 12-2), I feel confi
dent in saying the Cardinal got the bet
ter of last offseason's coaching carousel.
Granted, it's still incredibly early in
the Johnny Dawkins era. Granted, we
are less than a week removed from the
Cardinal falling by 30 in an absolute
blowout loss in its first real test of the
season. Granted, there are many more
tests ahead before we can officially
anoint Dawkins a Stanford legend in the
making.
But in just 12 games,the rookie head
coach has shown me something. Be
cause, while Johnson performed reason
ably well with players Mike Mont
gomery recruited and the God's-gift-to-
Stanford-basketball-7-foot-tall Lopez
twins, it was becoming clear that there
could be dark days ahead for the Cardi
nal. Believe it or not. a pair of big-nien
phenoms like that doesn't come along
just every day,and s(x>n we would all see
exactly what Johnson had in him as a
coach.
We will never know whether he
would have succeeded or not with a
roster devoid of 7-foot serendipity and
only his own recruits to call on. But
Dawkins is succeeding, right now, in the
situation that had Stanford fans decid
edly nervous even before the old coach


Denis
Griffin
Rants and Raves
left last year.
Philosophically, Stanford couldn't
ask for a better fit than Dawkins. The
former Duke assistant stresses things
that the Cardinal actually has a chance
to build on long-term — sound, harass
ing defense and accurate shooting. Add
those two elements to the post presence
the team had last year, and UCLA
wouldn't be the reigning Pacific-10
Conference champions this year. The
Stanford men have already forced 20 or
more turnovers in five contests this year
after averaging just over 12 per game
last season — no matter who they've
played, that's an impressive turn
around.
The point is that Dawkins' basket
ball blueprint is sustainable here. The
odds of a Stanford coach being able to
go out and recruit well enough to pro
duce the kind of low-post presence the
Cardinal has had in recent seasons
consistently aren't very good. But
shooters and guys who can put pres
sure on the ball? Yes. you can find
those guys, even with the stricter aca
demic constraints all Stanford coaches
face in recruiting.
And what's more, there already
seems to be a building sense of belief in
this team akin to what Jim Harbaugh
has instilled in the football team in re
cent years. Just watch senior Anthony
Goods and redshirt junior Landry
Fields discuss their most recent win
over Arizona on You Tube and you can
sense the confidence building. The
team is playing with an attitude that
seems to say "You didn't think we could
do it without the big guys, huh? Well,
just watch." And that attitude is deliver
ing the wins.
Who knows whether that will trans
late into more Pac-10 victories for the
Cardinal down the line? But for now,
things are better than most dared hope.
Far from conference cellar-dwellers.
Stanford looks as if it could be in for a
season of lurking in the middle of the
conference, on the edge of contention.
It's a position the average fan would
have gladly accepted, without hesita
tion. before the season started.
So. Johnny Dawkins. I was wrong.
But if the Cardinal keeps playing like
this. I certainlv won't be sorrv.

Denis Griffin also predicted that Bernie
Madoff woidd win Investor of the Year.
