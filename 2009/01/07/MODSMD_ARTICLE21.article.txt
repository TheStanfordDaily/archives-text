### ZOE LEAVITT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford wrestling faced a rude
awakening in the first days of 2(X)9.suf
fering three losses on Jan. 3. At the
Lonestar Duals in Arlington. Texas,
the Cardinal fell to Harvard (24-21),
Army (31-13) and to Oklahoma (35-
3). Faced with several forfeits, many
highly ranked opponents, and several
absent team members, including fre
quent point-scorer sophomore Por
firio Madrigal, the Cardinal wrestled
for a tough 12 hours but was unable to
emerge victorious.
The Cardinal fought a grueling bat
tle against Harvard, trading the lead
back and forth and only falteringin the
final seconds. Stanford faced its East
Coast academic rival emboldened by a
full lineup for the first time in this sea
son— previously, injuries had
dragged the team down and forced
them to forfeit several matches. Ibis
time, Stanford t(x>k a six-point lead
just by stepping on the mat as Harvard
forfeited its 125-pound match.
Harvard's three wrestlers, ranked
among the nation's best, would heat
up the scoreboard quickly. Ihe Crim
son tied the score in the next two
matches, aided by second-ranked
Corey Jantzen. Stanford Sophomore
Max Rosefigura wrestled hard at 149
pounds, but his opponent pinned him
to give Harvard a 12-61ead.Teammate
redshirt sophomore Lucas Espericue
ta lost a tough bout to his third-ranked
opponent. 9-1.
The Cardinal, however, was not
about to let the Crimson wrestlers
coast to victory. Redshirt freshman
Nick Amuchastegui needed just 1:45
to pin his opponent in the 165-pound
match. With a re-energized team,
sophomore Kyle Barrett won 5-1 to
carry Stanford to within a point of
Harvard. With a 16-15 score, the Crim

son's I xniis Caputo, ranked No. 5 na
tionally, fought to maintain Harvard's
lead. He beat Stanford freshman Vic
tor Haug by technical fall for five more
points.
But senior captain Luke Feist an
swered for the Cardinal, pinning his
freshman opponent in 6:01. His win
tied up the meet with only one match
left to determine the day.and moved
within a single pin of Stanford's all
time single-season top-10 list. Junior
Jake Johnson wrestled as a heavy
weight in the team's last match, but
was overpowered by the Crimson con
tender. and I larvard gained the vital
points needed to win the match.
Only a few hours later. Stanford
squared off against Army and faced an
even steeper uphill battle.Though with
fewer high-ranked individuals than
Harvard. Army scored several pins

throughout the match and took ad
vantage of Stanford forfeiting the
heavyweight class as Haug did not
wrestle, and Johnson took his place in
the 184-pound class. Army came out
strong on the mats and dominated the
first four matches. Finally with the
Cardinal down by 19 points. Esper
icueta rallied and won the 158-pound
match 8-5. Continuing the rally,
Amuchastegui pinned his second op
ponent of the day to win the next
match. Johnson dominated his match
12-2. but Stanford was unable to make
up for its lost points — the meet's last
two matches ended in disappointment
for the Cardinal as Army's top
wrestler. No. 9 Richard Starks, edged
out Feist and Army t(X)k the heavy
weight win by forfeit.
At 8 p.m.Stanford dropped its final
match of the day to No. 11 Oklahoma

State. With a lineupstocked with seven
ranked wrestlers, Oklahoma barely al
lowed Stanford onto the scoreboard.
Amuchastegui scored the only Cardi
nal victory of the meet, leading to a
final score of 35-3. Amuchastegui pro
pelled Stanford through the day.
rounding off the Lonestar Duals with
a string ol three victories.including two
pins. With the team's best record at 9-2.
Amuchastegui leads the team in
points with 38.
The late December Reno Tourna
ment of Champions proved to be
more fruitful for the Cardinal. At 197
pounds. Feist finished second in the
tournament. Riding a tidal wave of
momentum. Feist dominated the mats
and pinned his first three opponents in
fewer than 4 and a half minutes each.
He then defeated No. 14 Riley Orozco
of Cal State-Bakersfield to reach the
title match in his class, where he even
tually 105t,6-3. However, his three pins
brought him up to an impressive ca
reer total of 21. Iliis ties him with Scott
Lx)escher at sixth place on Stanford's
all-time chart.
Espericueta also placed in the tour
nament with a 6-2 record. After a de
moralizing loss to the highest-ranked
157-pounderin the nation, he rallied in
the consolation bracket to win fifth
place. Johnson was the Cardinal's third
wrestler to place, taking sixth after up
ending a ranked wrestler for the first
time in his career. Adding to the excite
ment. this was the first time for each
wrestler to place in the Reno tourna
ment. Amuchastegui scored three
wins, redshirt sophomore Cameron
Teitleman scored two. I laug. Barrett
and sophomore Max Rosefigura also
