## Searching for a BCS solution 
### 
When Florida and Oklahoma
take the field tomorrow in
the BCS National Champi
onship, it will he the culmination of
yet another year of controversy sur
rounding the college football postsea
son format.
'ITie Bowl Championship Series â€”
five games that pit the champions of
the six "major" conferences, as well as
four at-large teams, against one an
other in supposedly the most impor
tant bowls, tends to be the center of
the controversy. The problems with
the NCAA's football postseason go a
lot deeper than just the BCS. though,
revealing an outdated hierarchical
structure that no longer meets the
goal of establishing which teams are
the best in the country.
Public criticism for the BCS is cer
tainly not unfounded. Both Okla
homa and Texas, which defeated Ohio
State on Monday in the Fiesta Bowl,
have one loss, with the Sooners' loss
coming to the Longhorns. It is Okla
homa. however, that will be playing
for the National Championship to
morrow.
Fixing the BCS would not fix col
lege football. College football's prob
lems range past the 11-year-old sys
tem and into the bowl game format.
The first issue is the loss of tradi
tion. In an entirely profit-geared
scheme, the NCAA has continued to
add more bowls that tarnish the sig
nificance of making a bowl game.
Gone are the days in which college
football fans eagerly anticipated New
Year's Day to watch the Cotton Bowl,
the Rose Bowl, and the Orange Bowl.
Instead the first of the year is just
another day in a string of games
whose names don't even try to sound
important. What kind of tradition fol
lows from the Papajohns.com Bowl,
or the Gaylord Hotels Music City
Bowl?
All it takes to make one of the sec
ond-tier bowls is a 6-6 record. Win
ning half your games should not earn
you such a prize.
The ACC is the perfect example of
this. It sent ten teams to bowls this
year, which was not a reward for being
the best conference, but instead lor
being the most mediocre. No team in
the conference had less then four loss
es, but because so many teams were so
average, football fans were stuck
watching the ACC in bowl games for
three weeks.
The ACC's conference champion,
Virginia Tech. was 9-4. but it earned a
trip to the Orange Bowl, because,
along with the Big Ten. Big 12. Big
Fast. Pac-1(), and SFC conference
champions, plays in a "major confer
ence." Until the 1 lokiesbeat an equal
ly under-qualified Big East champion
Cincinnati in the Orange Bowl, the
ACC had not won a BCS bowl in 10
years. Despite that abysmal record,
the mandate that one ACC team par
ticipate annually remains.
The Big Ten is a similar offender.
Let us all, as football fans, be thankful
we aren't going to be subjected to a
third consecutive drubbing of Ohio
State in the National Championship
game tomorrow. The Big Ten used to
be the class of college football, but
times have changed and anyone
should be able to see it.
It's time for this system to change
as well. The Big Ten, like the ACC. is
awarded a lot of bowl games in large
part because of its schools' recogniza
ble names. But the conference's
shortcomings go past Ohio State in
BCS bowls, as the conference went I
-6 in bowls this year.
The NCAA, the BCS, and the gen
eral public need to start giving equal
clout to other conferences and stop
the old tradition of favoring those six
conferences.
Utah is prime example of this in
2008-09.The Utes are the only team in
the country without a loss, having just
defeated SEC darling Alabama hand
ily in the Sugar Bowl. They will not
win a national title, nor did they ever
have any real chance at it.
The Utes play in the Mountain
West, which is not one of the big six
conferences, but was arguably better
than at least three of those confer
ences this season. But because of tra
dition. the Mountain West will never
have a national champion in this sys
tem.
The right solution to the problem
isn't clear. Critics of a college football
playoff system say it takes away 112 rom
bowl tradition. The tradition, howev
er, has been severely damaged by the
expanded howl season and the inabil
ity to get a consensus on which are the
best teams in the country. Whether
playoffs are the answer, I don't know,
but what I do know is that there is
problem that needs to be fixed.
