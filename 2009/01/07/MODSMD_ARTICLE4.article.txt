### RYAN MAC STAFF WRITER 
Former Vice Mayor Peter Drekmeier was elected Mayor
of Palo Alto for 2(XW in ;i unanimous vote Monday night by
the city council. Drekmeier. a council member since 2(X)6,
was elected by acclamation while Councilman Jack Morton
was selected for vice mayor over fellow councilman Pat Burt
in a split. 5-3 vote.
The former vice mayor, age 45. was widely expected to
take the position following the end of outgoing Mayor Larry
Klein's one-year term. Klein, who nominated Drekmeier,
explained his decision to The Daily.
"Peter is a very good candidate, an excellent office hold
er and creative leader with well-established goals." Klein
said."! Ic reaches out to the community and has a very well
founded belief in local action."
Drekmeier hopes to build on the city's relationship with
the University during his term.The son of two Stanford pro
fessors. he believes that Palo Alto and Stanford can work
together to create sustainable envi
ronments.
"I consider myself to have a vested
interest in Stanford," the mayor said.
"The University is a model for conser
vation. and there has been progress is
the past few years, something we'd
expect and that we are obviously see
ing. Sustainability is a future goal of
any development."
A lifelong green activist and com
munity organizer. Drekmeier's imme
diate goals as mayor focus around fos
tering environmentally friendly
lifestyles.
"Mv personal theme is regional
cooperation for self-reliance as well as
preparing our community to make it
more sustainable locally." he told The
Daily. "This can be achieved by mak
ing local energy, conserving water or

purchasing locally produced food."
Among the projects that
Drekmeier cited for achieving this
goal is the maintenance of a local
composting plant, as well as the move
ment toward new composting tech
nologies to process yard and food
waste.
Still. Drekmeier's ambitious plans
will run into the nationwide recession.
With an expected city budget deficit of
$2.5 million in 2()08 and $5.3 million in
2009. the newly elected mayor dis
cussed a need to ease certain areas of
city spending.
"With the state of the current
economy, the city council is looking
for ways cut expenses and find addi
tional revenue." he said. "For example,
the city is expecting to build a new
police building that will cost $5 mil
lion. We need to look at this project
and ask: Are these the right plans, and
is this the risht time?"
