# ASSU debates budget cuts
## Special joint session of GSC, Senate called 
### MARISA LANDICHO STAFF WRITER 
Last month's announcement of a dra
matic decrease in the endowment's invest
ment returns, resulting in budget cuts of
more than SKKJ million, sent ASSU leaders
scrambling to protect funding for important
programs. To survey the new budgetary
landscape, a joint session of the Graduate
Student Council (GSC) and Undergraduate
Senate was called at the end of fall quarter
to pinpoint areas for internal budget cuts.
After much discussion, it was made clear
what was to be saved, but student leaders
struggled to recommend any meaningful
cuts to the budget.
Executives Jonny Dorsey '()9 and Fagan
Harris '09 called the special joint session on
Dec. 6 and tasked members of the two
groups with providing student input for the
upcoming budget cuts.
The senators and council members brain
stormed, bickered and referenced input
from various constituents, but eventually left
with five principles to preserve the quality of
life on campus: retaining community centers
and recreational facilities, preserving aca
demic standards, promoting campus health
and saving the jobs of staff members who
interact directly with students.
The joint session was prefaced with the
gloomy truth that all departments would be
facing an approximate 10 percent budget
cut. Over winter break, however, that figure
grew. According to a Jan. 5 email sent to stu
dents by Dorsey and Harris, general funds
for the University will be cut by 15 percent

over the next two years.
To cut the budget down to size, student
leaders suggested restructuring dining and
dorm budgets, minimizing funds for Admit
Weekend and Parents' Weekend and hiring
students instead of contract workers for
campus jobs.
But any cut requires a tradeoff â€”
Dorsey reminded the group that decisions
such as hiring students for campus jobs
would involve firing current employees.
Still, the group appeared to lean toward
the students rather than current workers.
"As an academic institution, students are
the foremost priority." said Senator Prachi
Priyam '11. "Unfortunately, considering
that. I would put students* concerns and
their preferences over those who can be eas
ily replaced."
Otherwise, the only concrete suggestions
for paring down the budget were firing bike
police and cutting excessive grounds main
tenance.
"Don't water in the rain," joked chemical
engineering graduate student and GSC
member Rvan Peacock, "or on the side
walks for that matter."
In the end. the assembly decided to
refrain from advocating specific cuts, as they
lacked what Harris called an "eagle-eye
vision."
But the meeting was certainly not with
out controversy.
At one point. Harris had to institute
hand-raising to keep the meeting civil after
Senator Patrick Cordova '09 and Senator
