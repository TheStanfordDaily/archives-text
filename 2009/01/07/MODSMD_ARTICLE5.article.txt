# ASSU debates budget cuts
## Special joint session of GSC, Senate called 
### MARISA LANDICHO STAFF WRITER 
Last month's announcement of a dra
matic decrease in the endowment's invest
ment returns, resulting in budget cuts of
more than SKKJ million, sent ASSU leaders
scrambling to protect funding for important
programs. To survey the new budgetary
landscape, a joint session of the Graduate
Student Council (GSC) and Undergraduate
Senate was called at the end of fall quarter
to pinpoint areas for internal budget cuts.
After much discussion, it was made clear
what was to be saved, but student leaders
struggled to recommend any meaningful
cuts to the budget.
Executives Jonny Dorsey '()9 and Fagan
Harris '09 called the special joint session on
Dec. 6 and tasked members of the two
groups with providing student input for the
upcoming budget cuts.
The senators and council members brain
stormed, bickered and referenced input
from various constituents, but eventually left
with five principles to preserve the quality of
life on campus: retaining community centers
and recreational facilities, preserving aca
demic standards, promoting campus health
and saving the jobs of staff members who
interact directly with students.
The joint session was prefaced with the
gloomy truth that all departments would be
facing an approximate 10 percent budget
cut. Over winter break, however, that figure
grew. According to a Jan. 5 email sent to stu
dents by Dorsey and Harris, general funds
for the University will be cut by 15 percent

over the next two years.
To cut the budget down to size, student
leaders suggested restructuring dining and
dorm budgets, minimizing funds for Admit
Weekend and Parents' Weekend and hiring
students instead of contract workers for
campus jobs.
But any cut requires a tradeoff â€”
Dorsey reminded the group that decisions
such as hiring students for campus jobs
would involve firing current employees.
Still, the group appeared to lean toward
the students rather than current workers.
"As an academic institution, students are
the foremost priority." said Senator Prachi
Priyam '11. "Unfortunately, considering
that. I would put students* concerns and
their preferences over those who can be eas
ily replaced."
Otherwise, the only concrete suggestions
for paring down the budget were firing bike
police and cutting excessive grounds main
tenance.
"Don't water in the rain," joked chemical
engineering graduate student and GSC
member Rvan Peacock, "or on the side
walks for that matter."
In the end. the assembly decided to
refrain from advocating specific cuts, as they
lacked what Harris called an "eagle-eye
vision."
But the meeting was certainly not with
out controversy.
At one point. Harris had to institute
hand-raising to keep the meeting civil after
Senator Patrick Cordova '09 and Senator
Stephanie MO disagreed over
campus construction projects.
Not 10 minutes later, comments
by Senator Luukas lives '09, who
wanted to shift the discussion from
advocacy to general principles and
methodology, forced the executives
to call a one-minute recess for all sen
ators and council members to cool
down.
"I think we should focus on where
we have programs that are inefficient
and not doing a good job," lives
argued. "We should look at function
ally where there is a duplication of
the substance and redundancy in
administration costs."
The rest of the assembly, with the
lone exception of Cordova, disagreed
because of student time frame and
knowledge.
"Isn't there a sort of no-shit kind
of thing there?" asked mechanical
engineering graduate student and
CISC Co-Chair Polina Segalova. "I
mean, that's what they are doing any
way."
"Quite frankly, from a student
perspective, you and I have no
idea what departments are effi
cient and which ones are not nec

essary," she added.
In defense of lives, Cordova called
for an end to the "witch hunts" for
funding cuts, prompting laughs from
Segalova and comparative literature
graduate student and GSC Co-Chair
George Bloom.
The executives wrapped up the
argument hy choosing to stress a
broader, program-by-program dis
cussion rather than looking for ineffi
cient departments. After breaking
into smaller groups, the assembly had
more success with narrowing down
specific interests.
Dorsey and Harris have present
ed the five points to the University's
assistant provosts, and will be meet
ing with Provost John Etchemendy
later this week. Budget negotiations
will proceed through the next quar
ter, according to Harris.
Stanford is under no obligation to
heed the input of the ASSU. and the
student government's backing does
not guarantee the survival of specific
programs. Still. Dorsey and Harris
have made it their goal to be as
involved as they can in the budget
reorganization process.
"We're going to continue to push
very hard throughout so that we can
ensure that student views are repre
sented," Harris told The Daily.
