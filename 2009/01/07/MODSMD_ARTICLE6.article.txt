## Stanford rejects new SAT Score Choice program 
### JULIA BROWNELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Score Choice, a new College Board
program that will allow applicants to
select the SAT scores they send to col
leges, isn't flying with the Stanford Office
of Undergraduate Admission. The
University has announced that it will not
participate in the program and will con
tinue to consider all of an applicant's SAT
scores.

Stanford is not the only school reject
ing Score Choice. Though schools includ
ing Harvard and the University of
Chicago have publicly accepted the poli
cy. Stanford is joined by USC, Penn,
Cornell and Pomona in continuing to
require all SAT scores from their appli
cants.
Director of Admission Shawn Abbott
told The Daily that Stanford will not
accept Score Choice because it encour
ages students to "overdo" the SAT.

"We want to discourage students from
taking the SAT more than once or twice,
and believe that programs like Score
Choice encourage applicants with
resources to take the SAT excessively to
improve their scores." Abbott said.
The College Board, however, claims
that the program will relieve the pressure
of taking standardized tests.
Score Choice is "designed to reduce
student stress and improve the test day
experience" according to the College

Board website. "[Score Choice] will allow
students to put their best foot forward on
test day by giving them more flexibility
and control over their scores."
However. Abbott insisted that taking
the SAT too often increases pressure on
students.
"I wouldn't agree with the notion that
Score Choice relieves pressure or stress."
he said. "I would argue instead that such
programs only encourage students to
take more tests to improve their
scores at all costs."
But some students feel differently.
Adrian Ferrari, a junior at local
Catholic high school Sacred Heart
Prep, will be applying to colleges
next year, including Stanford, and
feels that Score Choice would relieve
some of his stress.
"With all of the pressure of apply
ing to college, the ability to send in
my best score would be a huge
relief." he said. "Certainly not
enough of a relief to feel at-ease
about the college application process
in general, but at this point, I'll take
anything."
Susan Dean, dean of college
counseling at Castilleja School, the
prestigious Palo Alto all-girls private

high school, argued that the program
will not only increase stress, but will
actually give wealthier students fur
ther advantage over lower-income
students.
"Allowing Score Choice will, in
the end. only ratchet up the frenzy
over test scores, as those students in a
financial position to take the test
numerous times, and to undertake
expensive and time-consuming test
prep courses, will do so in an attempt
to achieve as high a score as possi
ble," Dean said.
Abbott, like Dean, criticized
Score Choice for exacerbating socio
economic discrepancies in the appli
cation process.
"(Score Choice] is also a disad
vantage to low-income students who
may not have resources to test more
than once or twice." he said.
But Alice Kleeman, a college
counselor at Menlo-Atherton High
School, a local public school, did not
see as much of a socio-economic
problem with the program at her

school, citing fee waivers and equal
counseling access as equalizers.
"A small minority of students
game the system." she said. "I don't
think at my high school right here
that we're going to see a big differ
ence between students with means
and those without."
In addition to the possible socio
economic concerns, critics have
alleged that the College Board is
implementing the policy to keep up
with the ACT, which already has a
similar score choice policy.
"My hunch is that the College
Board is losing their market share of
test-takers, with increasing competi
tion from the ACT, which offers a
program that is similar to Score
Choice." Abbott said. "Re-introduc
ing Score Choice enables the College
Board to offer students the same
options they have with the ACT."
Dean heard so herself at the
College Board Western Regional
Forum last February.
"1 heard a College Board repre

sentative admit that the move to
Score Choice was driven in some
measure by the need to increase rev
enue," Dean reported, "and they
were losing market share to the ACT,
which does allow score choice."
Stanford also does not accept the
ACT score choice program.
As to the implications of the poli
cy, no one seems quite sure. Both
Dean and Kleeman will be advising
their students to submit all scores to
all of their schools. However, Abbott
is not sure whether Stanford's
approach to Score Choice will affect
the number of applicants next year.
"Hard to predict," he said.
"However, we are hopeful that can
didates will understand that a com
pletely transparent process is the
best way to approach applying to col
lege. and that, in our evaluation,
absolutely all information is consid
ered in rendering a judgment."
