# STUDENT GOV'T
## ASSU execs look back on fall quarter Dorsey, Harris tell The Daily about what they've done in office, what is in the works 
### MARISA LANDICHO STAFF WRITER 
When Jonny Dorsey '09 and Pagan Harris '09 ran for ASSU presi
dent and vice-president last spring, they spoke of transforming the
concept of what a student government does. Instead of bike lights and
foosball tables, they talked about campus mental health and diversity.
ITieirs would be an ASSU focused on big. complex problems facing
the student body.
Now. the duo has been in office for a full quarter — the honey
moon period is over, and it is time to see what has been done, and
what still needs doing.
In an hour-long interview with The Daily at the end of fall quarter,
Dorsey, a member of Sigma Nu and founder of FACE AIDS, and
Harris, a Branner RA and campus public service leader, spoke at
length about their accomplishments
this quarter, what they plan to do
later in the year and how they are
adjusting to their new jobs.
Of the five major policy areas the
executives promised to address when
they were campaigning, concrete ini
tiatives have been completed in
three. Much more, Dorsey and
Harris promise, is yet to come.
Changing student government
With an around-the-clock work
ethic and a large network of student
staff, Dorsey and Harris have built
their office to resemble a small com
pany rather than a student govern
ment. The executives said that a large

part of their first quarter in office was
spent building a strong foundation,
upon which a number of initiatives
will be launched in the next two
quarters.
Foundation building isn't glam
orous, but Dorsey and Harris say it is
absolutely necessary to build a suc
cessful student government not only
for this year, but for successive
administrations as well.
Dorsey has attended almost every
Graduate Student Council meeting
since he took office, and Harris has
been spending a lot of time with the
Undergraduate Senate. The execu
tives hold legislative office hours
every week. And the two also meet
regularly with a host of University
administrators and employees —
everyone from the trustees to janito
rial staff.
Both worked through
Thanksgiving break, and Harris has

n't been to his native Baltimore since
last Christmas.
"I think the reality is we put in a
ton of hours — so does our team"
Dorsey said.'T wouldn't say it's com
ing easy, hut it's coming in as fast as
we want."
And it is talk of their team that
got Dorsey and I larris glowing.
More so than in past administra
tions, the executives are relying on a
staff that they say is much larger than
in previous years. Dorsey and Harris
said that they are so confident in the
capabilities of the chairs of their pol
icy areas that they are comfortable
letting them take ownership of big
initiatives.
The issues
During the spring campaign sea
son. Dorsey and Harris laid out an
ambitious plan — they pledged to
move beyond traditional student
government fare and tackle the big
issues. Their initial agenda had five
pieces: sustainability. campus health,
public service, diversity and student
life.
Realistically, though, a couple of
their promises, namely in public serv

ice and diversity, have been pushed
back due to timing, resources and
student priorities. Many of their com
pleted projects deal with student life,
including running the Big Game
buses and launching a pilot program
for online course readers.
"We realize these things matter to
the student body and we want to
retain our 'street cred' on the public
service stuff," Harris said. "We recog
nize it's important, and so we do it
and we do it well."
Most students are unaware of the
complexities that hinder quick
action.
Even the seemingly simple task of
turning the infamous red plastic cups
"green" involved cooperation from
dining staff and the creation of an
online ASSU Green Store. The
Green Store is up and running and
even delivers the biodegradable and
recyclable cups to residences at a
reduced cost.
Another substantial initiative has
been the planning of a Wellness
Room. Harris said the area is a non
stigmatized space where students
could access mental health resources
without being self-conscious.

Now that they have a strong foun
dation and a couple of successful ini
tiatives under their belt, the executives
are optimistic that they will make sig
nificant progress in all of their policy
areas by the end of their term.
The two were especially excited
about a public service summit
planned for later this year. Dorsey
and Harris hope that the summit will
become a focal point for a new
University commitment to opening
up opportunities within public serv
ice, and will inspire students to con
sider service.
According to the executives, sup
port for the summit is coming from
the highest echelons of the
University — they are collaborating
with the CDC, Haas Center and
administrators like President John
Hennessy.
The executives have also come
across several new issues that they
must face.
Dorsey saw recent problems such
as a rise in alcoholism and restrictive
party regulations as a threat to cam
pus diversity. He was unconcerned
about extra wristbands, but worried
that the restrictions would result in

an insular social life.
"(The Row houses] become
closed door organizations, where it
becomes just the Greek life partying
with the Greek life," he said. "Then
that's sad."
Dorsey cautioned that there was
no quick fix for the issue.
"It's a combination of cops versus
management police," he said.
The challenges
With the end of their first quarter,
Dorsey and Harris now face an
obstacle that few would have imag
ined in the spring — a recession, and
University budget cuts.
The cuts, which Provost John
Etchemendy has reported may reach
$100 million over the next two years,
have forced the entire ASSU to pri
oritize what projects truly need to get
done. The Undergraduate Senate has
been tasked with making a concrete
list of programs for which the ASSU
will fight.
"We're doing everything we can
to work with the financial manager
to insulate the ASSU endowment
from this economic crisis," Harris
said. "We're trying very hard to make
sure student groups can get that hard
cap money to throw that such and
such event."
Moreover. Harris wasn't bothered
about the fact that the student body
does not always recognize the work
the executives put into the budget.
"As long as they're not feeling it.
that they can get that money and not
even think twice about it. then that's
a great thing." he said.
Dorsey stressed that, pragmati
cally. there will be cuts and student
leaders will have to fight to retain
existing programs, much less fund
new ones. But he remained opti
mistic that when they decide that an
initiative is of clear importance —
for example, adding a full-time nutri
tionist to the campus health staff —
it will get funding. Also, 5-SURE, the
much-loved golf cart shuttle service,
is said to be safe.
For Dorsey and Harris, the last
quarter has been a busy one. as they
have built their team, created a
strong operational foundation and
launched several initiatives. But both
executives have ignored one key task
— their homework.
"We haven't done that great in
school." Dorsey said.
"I'm pretty sure I'm a myth in
class," Harris joked.
