## Student organizes carpool matching 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Over the winter break, Andy Ho
'09 created a carpool match-making
program called Rideshare to help
students transport between the air
port and campus.
"The idea came to fruition prob
ably during Thanksgiving break
when I noticed all the Rideshares
and Super Shuttles that were literal
ly double-parked on Escondido,"
Ho said. "It wasn't so much of a per
sonal experience, but it was more of
what I heard was going on around
campus."
The program, which does not
offer rides itself, is currently set up
as a Tumblelog where students can
post travel itineraries and simulta
neously search for others who may
have similar travel plans. Ho
believed students could more easily
find a means of transportation if
they could reach beyond the realm
of their dorm email lists.
"Oftentimes, the lists that stu
dents email — for example, their
dorm chat lists — might not have
the same number of people as their
dorm chat lists," Ho said. "But when
you open up the network to all of
Stanford, then the chances of finding
a match for a set of people to find a
ride is much greater."
Rideshare debuted at the end of
winter break in a series of campus
wide emails. Though many students
posted on the blog, only a few actu
ally made use of the program and
found rides.
"It needs a better layout," said
Tripp Leavitt '11, "and it could prob
ably help by making people fill in

details on a form so the site can tab
ulate it all, instead of basically hav
ing a disorganized blog."
Still, most of those who posted on
the Rideshare blog believed the
concept was promising. Some sug
gested that the reason the blog did
not perform as well was the fact that
not very many people were aware of
its existence.
"I think that once more people
become aware of the program, more
and more people will start to take
part in it," said Jordan Arellano '12.
"It is a great way to foster the sense
of community felt at Stanford."
Ho has been in talks with the
ASSU regarding funding options to
expand "the program. Plans for
improvement begin with transform
ing the blog-like format of the cur
rent Web site into a database that
has a form for students to complete
with their travel plans. The site
would then use the inputted infor
mation to provide the student with a
list of other students who have simi
lar arrival and departure times.
Ho noticed that most posts were
from students requesting a ride
rather than offering one. As a result.
Rideshare's expansion also includes
providing prospective drivers with
incentives, such as gas money.
"It will be much easier to operate
and navigate because I know many
students were confused about how
the system worked " Ho said.
Ho hopes to have the Rideshare
program fully updated in order to
accommodate a larger demand by
the end of winter quarter.
