## New PA mayor eyes issues Drekmeier and Stanford plan to address housing, environment issues 
### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN CONRIBUTING WRITER 
The following is the second of two reports on Palo
Alto's newly elected mayor. The first ran in yesterday's
issue of The Daily.
Recently elected Palo Alto Mayor Peter
Drekmeier, who was unanimously chosen at
Monday's city council meeting, will be working exten
sively with Stanford in his upcoming year-long term.
Although Stanford is technically within the juris
diction of Santa Clara County, parts of campus are
still under the jurisdiction of Palo Alto.
"The rule of thumb is that the residential portions
of Stanford are not in Palo Alto." said former mayor
Larry Klein. " The money-making portions are within
the city limits."
The areas of campus that generate revenue include
the Stanford shopping center and its hospitals, both of
which are under plans for expansion. Because they
fall outside of Santa Clara County, Stanford must turn
to the City of Palo Alto for expansion approval.
"Stanford is looking to expand the hospitals by 1.3
million square feet," Drekmeier noted.
He went on to outline the potential issues sur
rounding the development: "How do we address the
issue of increased traffic and increased demand for
housing? Will Stanford be required to build some
housing for new employees?" These issues will be
explored in tomorrow's issue of The Daily.
Drekmeier, whose parents were both professors at
Stanford and who received his B.A. in political sci
ence from UC-Berkeley, cites Stanford as a paradigm
for environmentally safe practices.
"Stanford is a real role model for green buildings,
energy efficiency and water conservation," the mayor
said. "There are a lot of opportunities to take advan
tage of the know-how at Stanford. I'm very eager to
do that."
Drekmeier has many years of experience in envi
ronmental awareness. He formed an environmental
organization called Bay Area Action in 1990, which
later merged with the Peninsula Conversation Center.
Together, the two groups formed the non-profit
organization Acterra.
Acterra annually selects businesses within the
community to be recipients of their prestigious busi
ness environmental awards. Last year, Stanford
Dining received one such award.
â€¢ The things that the dining services are doing are
very impressive," Drekmeier said. "It was a very easy
decision."
The mayor noted that his formation of Bay Area
Action had its roots at Stanford. Stanford's "You Can
Make a Difference" conference in 1989 celebrating
the 20th anniversary of Earth Day brought
Drekmeier back to Palo Alto after working for an
environmental group in Marin County.
In addition to working with Stanford on environ
mental issues and expansion plans, Drekmeier said
Palo Alto will be partnering with the University on
other community events in the near future.

"We're partnering with the Senior Games this
year," he said. "They're going to he coming to Palo
Alto and Stanford in August, and it brings a lot of
attention to our community."
"We've been partnered with Stanford in the past,
which was incredibly successful," the mayor added.
Klein, who works on the national level with coun
cil members from cities housing major education
institutions, agreed that the relationship between the
University and the city is a healthy one.
"From hearing people around the country, I would
say that the relationship between Stanford and Palo
Alto is better than average," the former mayor said.
Klein added that the main problem other cities
have with nearby colleges is student drinking.
This coming Saturday, the Palo Alto City Council is
holding its council priority session, which will deter
mine the priority of issues for the coming year. Last
year, the main topics were economic sustainability,
environmental protection, infrastructure improve
ment and civic engagement. According to Drekmeier,
Saturday will determine whether or not the council
will retain these same priorities.
Still, both Drekmeier and Klein stressed that the
city's current financial situation will certainly be a top
priority, especially in the midst of budget deficits and
a struggling national economy.
"For all of us, whether you want it to be a priority
or not, it's going to be a priority," the mayor said.
