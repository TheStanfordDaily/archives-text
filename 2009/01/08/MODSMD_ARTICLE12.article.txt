## Stem cell scientists find niche 
### MARVIN SHU 
Researchers at the Stanford
School of Medicine have recently iso
lated stem cells that transform into
bone and cartilage. These cells devel
op into the niche for blood formation,
an environment that harbors blood
forming stem cells and makes blood.
"We managed to grow the stem
cell environment of the blood stem
cell, which is usually in the bone mar
row of regular limb bones, in an envi
ronment that does not contain any
blood stem cells — the kidney," said
Charles Chan, a graduate student in
developmental biology.
The study was conducted by Chan
and Ching-Cheng Chen, a post-doc -
toral scholar in pathology in the lab of
Dr. Irving Weissman, the director of
the Stanford Institute for Stem Cell
Biology and Regenerative Medicine.
I"he paper was published on Dec. 10 in
Nature, a top scientific journal.
Weissman's lab specializes in
blood-forming stem cells, which can
mature to become any kind of blood
cell. Blood formation occurs in the
bone marrow in areas called niches,

where stem cells reside and grow into
blood cells.
"If you think of the stem cells as
seeds, then the niche is the soil the
seeds require to grow," Chan said.
In the study, Chan transplanted
fetal mouse bone not yet developed
for blood-forming capacity under the
kidney of another mouse. In a few
weeks, the bone supported blood for
mation.
Afterward, Chan was able to iso
late the cells responsible for the cre
ation of the niche, which turned out to
be stem cells that form bone and car
tilage, marking the first time this spe
cific stem cell has been isolated.
This scientific discovery has raised
numerous possibilities, one of which is
the use of the bone and cartilage stem
cell to speed the recovery of bone
fractures.
"Maybe we can use them to repair
or regenerate bone or cartilage
defects or accidents or diseases,"
Weissman said.
In addition, the aging of bones as
well as osteoporosis, the weakening of
bones, can be examined at the cellular
and genetic levels by observing differ

ences in bone and cartilage stem cells
in young and old people.
"If we were looking at these old
bone stem cells and young bone stem
cells, then we could get an idea of what
growth factors are missing that we can
supply to older people to rejuvenate
the blood stem cells," Chan said.
The Weissman lab will continue to
examine the niche and attempt to iso
late the actual niche cell that develops
from the bone and cartilage stem cells.
If they succeed, scientists may be able
to grow blood in the lab instead of
relying on blood drives, and they
could gain insight into leukemia by
examining why the niche harbors and
guides normal stem cells but allows
cancerous stem cells to go rampant.
"If we can get the niche cells to
interact with leukemia cells, we can
see if they directly regulate the
leukemia cells," Weissman said, "or, if
they don't, what it is about them that
regulates normal blood-forming stem
cells but doesn't regulate leukemia
cells."
