## TTYL, but not on Facebook Students choose not to use the popular social networking site 
### VINEET SINGAL 
erhaps nothing exemplifies the life
p of a college student better than
L/ Facebook. The popular, free social
networking — and usually procras
-JL. tination-aiding—Web site devel
oped by Mark Zuckerberg currently has
over 140 million users worldwide.
The Web site's Stanford network contains
over 45,000 members, including current
undergraduates, graduate students, staff and
alumni, as well as over 100 people enrolled in
Prof. B.J. Fogg's "Creating Engaging
Facebook Apps" course last fall.
But while Facebook's popularity at
Stanford — one of the first campuses to start
using it in 2004 — is undeniable, a small but
significant number of people on campus still
haven't jumped on the bandwagon.
Caitlin Tharp M 2, for example, does not
have a Facebook, explaining that Facebook
"takes up too much time."
"I am just not willing to commit to it." she

said. "There are other things I'd rather do
with my time."
Pondering the consequences of an online
profile doesn't seem to be one of them.
"At the end of the day. I think I would just
think myself to death about the implications
of a virtual self if I possessed Face book." said
David Keeler MO. "I would find no power in
an edit function — only self-consuming con
flict."
And Scott Frank M 1 feels that Facebook
is quite overrated in college life.
"I don't find it to be a necessary tool for
survival within our current social environ
ment" he explained. "I don't think about
Facebook much, and certainly my exclusion
from its benefits doesn't keep me up at night.
It is just something that I don't desire to par
ticipate in."
Frank also believes that Facebook is a
philosophically flawed concept since "it
would feel like selective voyeurism to create
a profile" and "degrade any scant sense of
self that I claim to possess."
"I feel that it is just another layer that we

use to avoid the possibility of actually con
necting with somebody" he said. "Facebook
is just a modern expression of the same
process of alienation and self-loathing that
has been the status quo for quite some time."
Indeed, the principal objection against
Facebook seems to be the absence of true
human interaction.
For Keeler, "Facebook cheapens the value
our society gives to direct human interaction.
It also enables us to have social lives without
actually developing social skills, which I
believe is detrimental."
Surprisingly, the fact that Facebook could
be a distraction from schoolwork does not
seem to be the issue.
"My academic life wouldn't suffer if I had
a Facebook account." Keeler said. "And any
way, I can distract myself from work without
Facebook."
Frank agreed.
" ITiere are enough distractions on the
Internet to be a placeholder for Facebook's
ability to devour time and energy." he
claimed.
Yet he did note that Facebook seems to be
a preferable way to waste time over sites like
You Tube because "it at least engages you in
the imagined campus community that sur
rounds us."
By the same token, students who choose
not to use Facebook are still willing to admit

that there are certain advantages to using it.
Keeler explained that with Facebook. it is
"easy to keep in touch and organize events
with friends and share pictures."
While Frank agreed that there might be
some benefit to having an at-your-fingertips
ability to keep in touch with friends, he
feared "that 'keeping in touch with old
friends' on Facebook may be trumped by the
desire to have as many 'Facebook' friends as
possible."
"A computer has to remind you how
many friends you have," Keeler said.
As such, this alleged emphasis on quantity
over quality can turn off some people from
Facebook. The Web site contains a counter of
how many friends one has and. until recently,
listed the number of one's wall posts —
friends' comments on a user's profiles.
And when it comes to social networking,
Facebook-less individuals don't generally use
alternative sites. While that might seem to
create some obstacles in terms of catching up
with old friends, there are other options.
Tharp admitted that while there may be
some practical benefits to Facebook, she
prefers an alternate method of communica
tion: the cell phone.
"Using the phone seems like a more per
sonal means of communication, and I like
that better," she said.
"[I have] long conversations with friends

every couple of months and definitely make
sure I see them when I'm in town." Frank
said.
Some, however, just prefer to see old
friends face to face.
"When individuals communicate over the
phone, for instance, all of the body language
cues are lost, and over instant message-style
communication, even vocal inflections are
lost," Keeler said. "Whenever my friends and
I are in the same town, we'll usually arrange
to meet up and hang out."
Not using Facebook can also have other
advantages, such as making for an all-the
more special get-together with a friend after
a long separation.
"It makes reunions much more sweet and
much more for the moment since we both
don't have expectations based what we per
ceive the other's life to be like through their
Facebook albums and such." Frank said.
Furthermore, even though Facebook has
nifty tools and applications, such as the abili
ty to cyber poke or high-five a friend, these
seem to be frivolous distractions for non-
Facebook users.
"Poking someone just doesn't make me
feel like I am actually taking a vested interest
in the lives of people that are important to
me," Frank said.

"My academic life wouldn't suffer if I had
a Facebook account." Keeler said. "And any
way, I can distract myself from work without
Facebook."
Frank agreed.
" ITiere are enough distractions on the
Internet to be a placeholder for Facebook's
ability to devour time and energy." he
claimed.
Yet he did note that Facebook seems to be
a preferable way to waste time over sites like
You Tube because "it at least engages you in
the imagined campus community that sur
rounds us."
By the same token, students who choose
not to use Facebook are still willing to admit

that there are certain advantages to using it.
Keeler explained that with Facebook. it is
"easy to keep in touch and organize events
with friends and share pictures."
While Frank agreed that there might be
some benefit to having an at-your-fingertips
ability to keep in touch with friends, he
feared "that 'keeping in touch with old
friends' on Facebook may be trumped by the
desire to have as many 'Facebook' friends as
possible."
"A computer has to remind you how
many friends you have," Keeler said.
As such, this alleged emphasis on quantity
over quality can turn off some people from
Facebook. The Web site contains a counter of
how many friends one has and. until recently,
listed the number of one's wall posts —
friends' comments on a user's profiles.
And when it comes to social networking,
Facebook-less individuals don't generally use
alternative sites. While that might seem to
create some obstacles in terms of catching up
with old friends, there are other options.
Tharp admitted that while there may be
some practical benefits to Facebook, she
prefers an alternate method of communica
tion: the cell phone.
"Using the phone seems like a more per
sonal means of communication, and I like
that better," she said.
"[I have] long conversations with friends

every couple of months and definitely make
sure I see them when I'm in town." Frank
said.
Some, however, just prefer to see old
friends face to face.
"When individuals communicate over the
phone, for instance, all of the body language
cues are lost, and over instant message-style
communication, even vocal inflections are
lost," Keeler said. "Whenever my friends and
I are in the same town, we'll usually arrange
to meet up and hang out."
Not using Facebook can also have other
advantages, such as making for an all-the
more special get-together with a friend after
a long separation.
"It makes reunions much more sweet and
much more for the moment since we both
don't have expectations based what we per
ceive the other's life to be like through their
Facebook albums and such." Frank said.
Furthermore, even though Facebook has
nifty tools and applications, such as the abili
ty to cyber poke or high-five a friend, these
seem to be frivolous distractions for non-
Facebook users.
"Poking someone just doesn't make me
feel like I am actually taking a vested interest
in the lives of people that are important to
me," Frank said.
