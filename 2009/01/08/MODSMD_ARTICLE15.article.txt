## Editorial Anti-smoking petition overreacts and overreaches 
### 
It is beyond a doubt that smoking tobacco
is a dangerous and addictive habit, and
that second-hand smoke can cause harm
even to non-smokers. The editorial board
supports reasonable efforts to reduce the ex
posure of the Stanford community to sec
ond-hand smoke and to provide assistance
to smokers who want to quit. At the same
time, however, the editorial board feels that
the petition to make Stanford a "smoke
free" campus is an unnecessarily strong
measure that unfairly ostracizes cigarette
smokers.
Compared to the rest of the country,
Stanford is already a relatively smoke-free
environment. According to the American
Heart Association, 23.9 percent of American
men and 18.1 percent of American women
ages 18 and older are smokers. Anecdotal
evidence suggests that number is far lower
among Stanford students.
In fact, the 2007 Stanford Health and
Lifestyle Assessment revealed that only four
percent of 1.088 employees surveyed over a
two-year period smoke.The petition's claim
that an entirely "smoke-free" campus is nec
essary to protect "the freedom of non-smok
ers to move around campus without expo
sure to second-hand smoke" is a dispropor
tionate response to the problem of smoking
on campus.
Apart from these concerns about the real
necessity of a "smoke-free" campus, the pe
tition brings to mind serious questions of
hypocrisy and enforceability. For those 18
and older, smoking is still a perfectly legal
activity â€” as opposed to. for instance, un
derage drinking and marijuana use.
It borders on humorous to imagine stu
dents leading a campus-wide campaign to

banish legal cigarette smokers while turning
a blind eye to illicit alcohol and drug use,
which also pose serious public health risks.
Furthermore, the editorial board would ven
ture a guess that those smoking marijuana
are somewhat more likely to violate policies
about smoking indoors than tobacco smok
ers. Finally, if illegal underage drinking oc
curs on such a widespread basis, how will the
proposed cigarette ban be enforced, particu
larly in a time of serious budget cuts?
The editorial board believes that the best
solution to the problem of smoking on cam
pus is to place greater emphasis on the pro
grams and restrictions that are already in
place. Consistent with California law.smok
ing is not allowed inside or within 20 feet of
a building. Better compliance with this poli
cy by those on campus who do choose to
smoke and better enforcement of it by resi
dential staff and campus security would pre
vent the harmful effects of second-hand
smoke around dorms and classrooms.
Most importantly, the Stanford commu
nity needs greater awareness about the pro
grams available to help smokers who want
to quit. The Stanford Benefits program and
Health Improvement Program provide edu
cation.counseling and nicotine-replacement
products to faculty and staff. Similarly, Well
ness and Health Promotion Services also
provides individual consultation and work
shops regarding alcohol, tobacco and other
drug abuse prevention.
The editorial board applauds these pro
grams and hopes that all Stanford communi
ty members who wish to quit smoking can
find the tools to succeed. A "smoke-free"
campus, however, is not the appropriate
method for achieving that goal.
