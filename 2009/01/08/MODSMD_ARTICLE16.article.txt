## Can we even take the Senate seriously anymore? 
### 
Our 2008 presidential election was bliss
fully free of the court battles that
marred, and de-legitimized, the 2000
presidential election. The Senate, however,
has not been so lucky. We now have two ridicu
lous Senate-seat battles that do not benefit the
dignity of the World's Most Deliberative
Body, in New York and Illinois. I don't think
that Minnesota's Florida-like legal battle be
tween Al Franken and Norm Coleman is
ridiculous, because that is at least an election.
Colorado and Delaware also have appointed
Senators, but those have at least been far less
controversial than New York and Illinois.
First, we have New York, where it seems
that Caroline Kennedy is waging a one
woman campaign for one man's vote — the
Governor, David Paterson, who has the
power to appoint Secretary of State-desig
nate Miliary Rodham Clinton's replacement.
The whole process has been marked by a
complete lack of legitimacy. Paterson himself
has never been elected as Governor, as he
only replaced Eliot Spitzer in March 200 X in
the wake of a personal scandal. Caroline
Kennedy has been allowed to wage a public
campaign for Paterson's selection, while
other candidates have been unable to pub
licly state their intentions.
Kennedy will likely get the nod: to me. it
seems that she was selected long ago and her
"campaign" is just to accustom New York vot
ers to her. She's never had a public or policy
making role in anything before, other than
working as a fundraiser for New York public
schools. At least Colorado Governor Bill Rit
ter. replacing Ken Salazar, picked the super
intendent of Denver public schools.
Second, we have the circus that is Illinois.
Governor Rod Blagojevich, under a
firestorm of criticism and legal prosecution,
for alleged attempts to sell the Senate seat to
the highest bidder, picked the state's former
attorney general. Roland Bun is. Hie Senate
refused to seat Burris, turning him away dur
ing the swearing-in ceremony for new sena
tors in a spectacularly distasteful piece of po
litical theater. While Blagojevich is certainly
absurdly corrupt, the Illinois legislature has
been unable to remove him and he's still the
sitting governor. Burris should not be reject
ed solely because a tainted governor appoint
ed him.
Will the Senate create other reasons to not
seat a Senator? When does "corrupt" become
"too corrupt to appoint a Senator"? The Sen
ate is currently setting a dangerous precedent
in which it can reject members simply be
cause Democrats do not want to associate
themselves with a corrupt governor. Senator
Dianne Feinstein has raised these objections
recently.and it is possible that Senate Democ-

Will the Senate create
other reasons to not
seat a senator?

rats will reverse course and allow Burris to be
seated after all. While it would certainly be
nice for Burris to claim his seat, refusing him
the first time has deeply damaged the legiti
macy of the Senate.
The U.S. Senate loses legitimacy when
some its prominent members — the ones fol
lowing in Hillary Clinton and Barack
Obama's distinguished footsteps — are ap
pointed in a undemocratic and highly non
transparent fashion. Add to it Colorado and
Delaware, and this year's Senate alone has
four seats occupied by people who were not
elected to them. Many other Senators, like
Alaska's Lisa Minkowski, owe their "safe"
seats to an appointment in the middle of
someone else's term. Allowing governors to
appoint senators is an anachronism.
The Blagojevich case shows that gover
nors will not necessarily appoint a senator in
the state's interest. If a senator fails to finish
his or her term,governors should be required
to immediately call a special election to be
held in maybe 90 days. Many states already
require this, but certainly not all of them. If
states no longer allowed their governors to
appoint senators, then we wouldn't have a
long series of media circuses that come when
a new president starts picking off senators for
his or her cabinet. Not only will the Senate
look more legitimate as a result, but also the
incoming senator will have the legitimacy and
authority that only a democratic election can
bring.
