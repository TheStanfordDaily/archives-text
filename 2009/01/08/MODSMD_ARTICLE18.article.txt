Now I know what you're thinking: I'm cop
ping out of writing a legitimate column be
cause I was far t(X) hung over after the new
year's celebrations. I'm doing one of those "Year in
Review" things that column writers do to get by
the first week of January.
Well.you're absolutely right. My head is throb
bing and I'm pretty sure that I'm coming down
with something I contracted a few nights ago.
But before you throw this paper down in dis
gust, or close your browser and then hurl your
laptop across the room, because I've just wasted
10 seconds of your life, let me say this: 2(X)8 was
not the most mundane of years, economically
speaking.
It was actually quite exciting. In the way that
jumping of a cli ff with no parachute or dri vi ng a air
into a wall can be quite exciting.
Housing bubbles were burst, oil prices sky
rocketed and then plummeted, two of America's
oldest financial institutions disappeared and the
largest fraud ever was uncovered. I also dated
someone briefly. It was just one of those wild, un
explainable years.
Here are the five events that I thought were
most important in 2(X)8:
5. Move over Georgia
Russia's attack on Georgia was perhaps the
most overlooked economic event of2ooB. Few re
alize the tactical significance th;it Georgia plays in
Europe's energy security. One of Europe's main
natural gas pipelines runs through Georgia and
the invasion by Russia reminded the Europeans
of the tenuous ground on which they stand.The
ongoing dispute with Ukraine is further evidence
of the fragility of Europe's energy sources. As nat
ural gas reserves dwindle, global prices will scx>n
reach the highs of this past August once gain, crip
pling Western Europe's already struggling
economies
4. Bye, bye Iceland
Last year,a comprehensive UN study conclud
ed that the Icelandic people enjoyed the highest
standard of living in the world. In 2009. the Ice
landic economy is expected to contract a stunning
I ((percent with inflation as high as 75 percent.
What the hell happened?
The countrv borrowed and borrowed heavily.

In the second quarter of 2(X)8. Iceland's external
debt was approximately 50 billion Euros com
pared to annual GDP of 8.5 billion Euros. That's
right — the country was levered up X) percent!
Things were so bad that the government didn't
have the revenues to bail out Iceland's three major
banks — the country was practically bankrupt.
Eventually, the IMF intervened and provided a
loan to the nation. Amid all this turmoil, applica
tions for state provided Christmas gifts increased
bv 30 percent. Ah. Scandinavia.
3.The name's Madoff. Bernie Madoff
More than anything, the Madoff scandal
brought to light the amadng financial intercon
nectedness of the world in the 21st century. Span
ish banks. Latin American billtonaires.French aris
tocracy. North East Universities and Bay Area
charities were all affected by the now notorious
Ponzi scheme.
Free flow of capital around the world is defi
nitely agood thing. It has made financial markets
more efficient and provided greater access to
funding for developing nations. Left unabated
and unregulated, though, it can lead to catastro
phes such as the Madoff fiasco. Hopefully, the
powers that be realize this and reign in all the
feeder fund fun.
2. Bailout Mania
Markets are Darwinian. That's what makes
them beautiful (to people who get off on stuff like
that — like me). But more importantly.that's what
makes them work. The unsuccessful are purged
and the best survive, making us all better off as a re
sult. Government intervention prevents this natu
ral process from occurring.
You didn't see Mother Nature handing out
stimulus packages when the dinosaurs were going
through that horrible time in the Cretaceous peri -
od did you? So an asteroid hit the Earth and they
were extinct. Well, tough — that's what happens
when you're unintelligent and cold-blooded.
Which. 1 m sorry to say. is what you are when buy
ing low rated slices of securities tied to low rated
slices of securities backed by sub-prime mortgages
with 30 to one leverage.
And if you were making cars in Detroit instead
of buying the financial equivalent of sewage, then
vou're more Dodo than dinosaur. A delicious,

flightless bird that waddles around a small island. 1
mean seriously, whose idea was the Dodo? Proba
bly the same people that thought of building pick
up trucks when gas was four dollars a gallon.
1. Funeral for Wall Street
An apparent fact about Wall Street is that it be
gins at a C'hurch and ends at a Grave Yard.This is
supposed to be a metaphor for "life on the street."
People are born ready to work there and die in its
service.
Ask all the people at Lehman Brothers what
they think about that metaphor. I'm sure they'll
have plenty of expletive-laden things to say.
It is shocking to think that in the space of six
months, three of America's most well-known and
well-respected financial institutions had disap
peared. Bear Stearns was handed to J P Morgan by
the Federal Reserve. Lehman Brothers filed for
bankruptcy and Merrill Lynch sold itself to Bank
of America to prevent a similar fate. The two re
maining Wall Street firms. Goldman Sachs and
Morgan Stanley, converted to banks and submit
ted themselves to the mercy of Federal Reserve.
This is t.ie end of an era. Not in the nostalgic,
whose going to buy bottles at strip clubs now way,
but in the realization that the broker/dealer mi Kiel
of financial markets will largely disappear. Invest
ment banks will no longer have the sole power,
given arbitrarily to them by politicians way back
when, to provide liquidity for financial products.
Instead, there will be a democratization of finan
cial markets. Several firms will compete to provide
liquidity, most likely on exchanges or via clearing
houses,eliminatingthe systemic risk that caused so
much of the pandemonium this year.
And the investment banks? Ihev'll go back
to doing what they used to do before all this sales
and trading stuff began: providing firms with ad
vice, wealth management and two hour lunches
at the Cipriani — downtown, of course, and on
the terrace, please.
