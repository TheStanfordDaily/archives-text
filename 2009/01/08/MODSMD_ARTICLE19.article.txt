## Adventures in secondhand smoke 
### 
I had a relatively smoke-free upbringing;
no one in my immediate family smoked
and I grew up in the smoke-free suburbs
of the Bay Area. I knew about the hazards of
secondhand smoke, but they were never real
to me. I didn't become aware of my own sen
sitivity to smoke until 1 came to Stanford.
Freshman year was full of firsts for all of us.
and for me it was the first time I discovered
the effect it had on me; even brief exposures
left me light-headed.
Since it always seemed like I was the only
one bothered by it. I resigned myself to rela
tive silence. I was certainly bothered by the
inconvenience it caused me: having to find al
ternate entrances, avoiding walkways on
campus, making silly semi-circles around in
dividuals who were smoking, keeping my
windows closed, holding my breath during
conversations and at parties.
There were times when avoiding it wasn't
an option. Coming back from class to where
I locked my bike, there'd be someone smok
ing ;it the bike rack. Waiting at the Mar
guerite stop could be awkward for me, too
(how far away from someone could I stand
without seeming rude?).
But as I began to have conversations with
my peers and with faculty. I realized that I
was not the only one bothered by the pres
ence of smoke on campus. For fear of antag
onizing dorm-mates or creating tension in
my residence, many have asked their R As to
remind residents that state law requires out
door smoking to take place at least 20 feet
from buildings, liven then, getting to the en

trance of their dorms still means walking
through plumes of smoke.
Most people advocating for a smoke-free
campus mean well; no one wants to alienate
other students just for smoking, and the char
actor judgments people who smoke are sub
jected to on a regular basis are hardly fair.
Now that scientific research overwhelm
ingly points to the real health hazards caused
by passive exposure to secondhand smoke,
which include increased incidence of heart
attack and stroke, we shouldn't be asking
members of our community to simply "get
used to" smoke when it's an issue of health.
And let's not forget the real problems it pres
ents to individuals with respiratory disease
and conditions such as asthma, allergies and
cystic fibrosis.
Conversations about secondhand smoke
at Stanford have remained under the radar
until now. The purpose of the petition to
make Stanford smoke-free is to bring these
concerns out into the open. Supporting a
smoke-free Stanford does not mean support

ing the further stigmatization of students, fac
ulty and staff who smoke â€” most of whom
are trying to quit. It also does not mean deny
ing individuals the choice to smoke.
The petition's existence means there are
students, faculty and staff who believe that
the health benefits of a smoke-free Stanford
are worth serious consideration. If in the
process.it provides further incentive for indi
viduals to quit smoking or prevents individu
als from starting, then Stanford is doing its
job to promote healthy living. Whether Stan
ford becomes the first elite university to im
prove the quality of life in its community by
going smoke-free is up to us. Stanford's addi
tion to the growing number of smoke-free
campuses across the country would send a
powerful message to our peer institutions
and carry profound health meaning beyond
our campus community.
