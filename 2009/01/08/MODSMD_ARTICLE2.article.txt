# Students petition smoke-free
## SCAC leads campaign for smoke-free campus 
### BY LIZ STARK CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford Colleges Against

Cancer (SCAC) recently
circulated a petition to /

make Stanford a smoke
free campus. Since its In-

ternet release last week,
the petition has been
met with both vigorous

support and opposition.
Presently featuring more

than 350 signatures, the petition asserts that
"the freedom of non-smokers to move around
campus without exposure to second-hand
smoke is a fundamental right."
SCAC defines a smoke-free campus as one
that "designates the entire campus as smoke
free" with the exception of a few remote loca
tions. prohibits tobacco sales and advertising on
campus and offers tobacco cessation programs
to those members of the community wishing to
quit.
"We are interested in learning what support
exists at Stanford for going smoke-free," said
Jamie Tarn MO. SCAC president and primary
author of the petition."lf Stanford goes smoke
free. the message of health it would send to our
peer institutions ... would be ground-break
ing."
Stanford's current smoking policy bans
smoking indoors and within 20 feet of all build
ings, consistent with California state law.
Cigarettes are available for purchase at
Tresidder Express and at the Valero gas station
on Campus Drive.
Since Sept. I of last year, the Stanford Bene
fits program and Health Improvement Pro
gram (HIP) have been providing free educa
tion, counseling and nicotine patches and gum
to Stanford faculty and staff tr\ing to quit
smoking.
Tain also noted that the petition was partial
ly inspired by the School of Medicine's adop
tion of a smoke-free policy in September 2007.
Dr. Robert Jackler, professor of otorhino
laryngology, supported the new policy at the
medical school and has worked with SCAC on
their initiative to make all of Stanford smoke
free.
"I was very pleased and proud that students
have come up with an initiative and were
thoughtful about it," Jackler said. "I would em-


CRIS BAUTISTA/
The Stanford Daily
phasize this is not about depriving
smokers of anything; this is about
allowing people to breathe clean
air."
Jackler also added that a switch to
a smoke-free campus would benefit
smokers, citing studies reporting that
"if you make it inconvenient for peo
ple to smoke, it helps them to quit."
According to Jackler. though
both Stanford Hospital and the
I.ucile Packard Children's Hospital
currently have one outdoor smoking
area each, the hospitals are consider
ing becoming smoke-free as well.
Many signatories of the petition
cited health concerns as their main
reason for supporting the initiative.
"Everyone knows that smoking is
a harmful behavior," said signatory

Kyle Evaldez '09. "If it discourages
people from smoking, I'm personally
for it, and if it steps on people's toes
who do smoke, it's probably worth
it."
Still, many students, smokers and
non-smokers, disagree.
"I'm disturbed at the mere fact
that such a petition exists," said Jeff
Gilliland '09, "as it seems to me to be
a clear violation of the rights of an
adult person."
"I don't think it should be up to a
small minority of students signing a
petition to decide the availability of
smoking products for everyone on
campus," added Stephen Hibbs '11.
"I also don't think that throwing
how-to-quit pamphlets at smokers is
going to convince many, if any, stu
dents who smoke."
SCAC Vice President Daniel
Scott-Smith '11 responded to these
criticisms by emphasizing that a
smoke-free campus does not mean a
smoking ban.

"[The petition] doesn't say we
want to ban smoking on campus," he
said. "We felt it was our responsibili
ty to fight for some kind of policy
that would curb Stanford's support
of the tobacco industry, and that
somehow we could campaign for the
health of our students."
"The writers of the petition agree
with people's rights to choose to
smoke," Scott-Smith added.
Jackler echoed this sentiment.
"It's not about depriving anyone
of that privilege," he said. "We're try
ing to put [the designated smoking
areas] where people who choose not
to smoke are not going to be influ
enced by the choices [of smokers]."
Kimberlee Vagadori, as college
project coordinator at the California
Youth Advocacy Network, a non
profit funded by the state of
California, has supported SCAC's
petition and efforts across the state
to prevent smoking on college cam
puses.

"Stanford has all this great
research about the danger of tobac
co use and second-hand smoke
exposure," she said, "and yet the pol
icy is pretty weak compared to other
college campuses."
Vagadori noted that private uni
versities in California are only
required to ban smoking indoors
and have lagged behind policy
changes at public universities.
Only four public universities in
California still sell tobacco products
on campus.
"On campuses who adopt these
policies, a couple years after, the
social norm changes and there's less
smoking," Vagadori added. "Overall,
it takes a while for that to happen."
Here at Stanford, students seem
to disagree about the amount of
smoking on campus.
"Every day at Stanford, 1
encounter people smoking around
my dorm, the Quad and Tresidder,"
said Alicia Kriewall *11.

On the other hand. Jane Heyes
"11 finds the amount of smoking on
campus non-intrusive.
"1 have yet to be bothered by
someone smoking on campus,"
Heyes said. "Right now. the popula
tion is too small for me to worry
about."
According to Jeff Wachtel. senior
assistant to President John
Hennessy. the final decision on mak
ing Stanford smoke-free lies with the
president.
"We'd want to make sure it was
discussed pretty broadly within the
Stanford community, with the
Committee on Health and Safety
and the Faculty Senate, for exam
ple," Wachtel said.
The ultimate decision on the peti
tion and a smoke-free campus may
affect another recent controversy as
well.
According to Dr. Stephen
Fortmann. professor in disease pre
vention at the medical school, the

Faculty Senate voted down a pro
posal that would ban research fund
ed by the tobacco industry at
Stanford in the spring of 2007.
Hennessy and Provost John
Etchemendy also rejected the pro
posal.
"There was no evidence that the
Faculty Senate would have support
ed a smoke-free campus at that
time." Fortmann said. "Wide sup
port. particularly from students,
might persuade the administration
to see if they could come up with a
viable plan."
Though he is happy with the
response to the petition, Scott-Smith
said he recognizes that a verdict on
these efforts will take time.
"It's hard to forecast when or if
this will pass." he said, "but this cur
rent reaction, people talking, is a
good sign."

dents who smoke."
SCAC Vice President Daniel
Scott-Smith '11 responded to these
criticisms by emphasizing that a
smoke-free campus does not mean a
smoking ban.

"[The petition] doesn't say we
want to ban smoking on campus," he
said. "We felt it was our responsibili
ty to fight for some kind of policy
that would curb Stanford's support
of the tobacco industry, and that
somehow we could campaign for the
health of our students."
"The writers of the petition agree
with people's rights to choose to
smoke," Scott-Smith added.
Jackler echoed this sentiment.
"It's not about depriving anyone
of that privilege," he said. "We're try
ing to put [the designated smoking
areas] where people who choose not
to smoke are not going to be influ
enced by the choices [of smokers]."
Kimberlee Vagadori, as college
project coordinator at the California
Youth Advocacy Network, a non
profit funded by the state of
California, has supported SCAC's
petition and efforts across the state
to prevent smoking on college cam
puses.

"Stanford has all this great
research about the danger of tobac
co use and second-hand smoke
exposure," she said, "and yet the pol
icy is pretty weak compared to other
college campuses."
Vagadori noted that private uni
versities in California are only
required to ban smoking indoors
and have lagged behind policy
changes at public universities.
Only four public universities in
California still sell tobacco products
on campus.
"On campuses who adopt these
policies, a couple years after, the
social norm changes and there's less
smoking," Vagadori added. "Overall,
it takes a while for that to happen."
Here at Stanford, students seem
to disagree about the amount of
smoking on campus.
"Every day at Stanford, 1
encounter people smoking around
my dorm, the Quad and Tresidder,"
said Alicia Kriewall *11.

On the other hand. Jane Heyes
"11 finds the amount of smoking on
campus non-intrusive.
"1 have yet to be bothered by
someone smoking on campus,"
Heyes said. "Right now. the popula
tion is too small for me to worry
about."
According to Jeff Wachtel. senior
assistant to President John
Hennessy. the final decision on mak
ing Stanford smoke-free lies with the
president.
"We'd want to make sure it was
discussed pretty broadly within the
Stanford community, with the
Committee on Health and Safety
and the Faculty Senate, for exam
ple," Wachtel said.
The ultimate decision on the peti
tion and a smoke-free campus may
affect another recent controversy as
well.
According to Dr. Stephen
Fortmann. professor in disease pre
vention at the medical school, the

Faculty Senate voted down a pro
posal that would ban research fund
ed by the tobacco industry at
Stanford in the spring of 2007.
Hennessy and Provost John
Etchemendy also rejected the pro
posal.
"There was no evidence that the
Faculty Senate would have support
ed a smoke-free campus at that
time." Fortmann said. "Wide sup
port. particularly from students,
might persuade the administration
to see if they could come up with a
viable plan."
Though he is happy with the
response to the petition, Scott-Smith
said he recognizes that a verdict on
these efforts will take time.
"It's hard to forecast when or if
this will pass." he said, "but this cur
rent reaction, people talking, is a
good sign."

Stanford Colleges Against

Cancer (SCAC) recently
circulated a petition to /

make Stanford a smoke
free campus. Since its In-

ternet release last week,
the petition has been
met with both vigorous

support and opposition.
Presently featuring more

than 350 signatures, the petition asserts that
"the freedom of non-smokers to move around
campus without exposure to second-hand
smoke is a fundamental right."
SCAC defines a smoke-free campus as one
that "designates the entire campus as smoke
free" with the exception of a few remote loca
tions. prohibits tobacco sales and advertising on
campus and offers tobacco cessation programs
to those members of the community wishing to
quit.
"We are interested in learning what support
exists at Stanford for going smoke-free," said
Jamie Tarn MO. SCAC president and primary
author of the petition."lf Stanford goes smoke
free. the message of health it would send to our
peer institutions ... would be ground-break
ing."
Stanford's current smoking policy bans
smoking indoors and within 20 feet of all build
ings, consistent with California state law.
Cigarettes are available for purchase at
Tresidder Express and at the Valero gas station
on Campus Drive.
Since Sept. I of last year, the Stanford Bene
fits program and Health Improvement Pro
gram (HIP) have been providing free educa
tion, counseling and nicotine patches and gum
to Stanford faculty and staff tr\ing to quit
smoking.
Tain also noted that the petition was partial
ly inspired by the School of Medicine's adop
tion of a smoke-free policy in September 2007.
Dr. Robert Jackler, professor of otorhino
laryngology, supported the new policy at the
medical school and has worked with SCAC on
their initiative to make all of Stanford smoke
free.
"I was very pleased and proud that students
have come up with an initiative and were
thoughtful about it," Jackler said. "I would em-

phasize this is not about depriving
smokers of anything; this is about
allowing people to breathe clean
air."
Jackler also added that a switch to
a smoke-free campus would benefit
smokers, citing studies reporting that
"if you make it inconvenient for peo
ple to smoke, it helps them to quit."
According to Jackler. though
both Stanford Hospital and the
I.ucile Packard Children's Hospital
currently have one outdoor smoking
area each, the hospitals are consider
ing becoming smoke-free as well.
Many signatories of the petition
cited health concerns as their main
reason for supporting the initiative.
"Everyone knows that smoking is
a harmful behavior," said signatory

Kyle Evaldez '09. "If it discourages
people from smoking, I'm personally
for it, and if it steps on people's toes
who do smoke, it's probably worth
it."
Still, many students, smokers and
non-smokers, disagree.
"I'm disturbed at the mere fact
that such a petition exists," said Jeff
Gilliland '09, "as it seems to me to be
a clear violation of the rights of an
adult person."
"I don't think it should be up to a
small minority of students signing a
petition to decide the availability of
smoking products for everyone on
campus," added Stephen Hibbs '11.
"I also don't think that throwing
how-to-quit pamphlets at smokers is
going to convince many, if any, stu
dents who smoke."
SCAC Vice President Daniel
Scott-Smith '11 responded to these
criticisms by emphasizing that a
smoke-free campus does not mean a
