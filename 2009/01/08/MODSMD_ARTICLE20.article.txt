### JACOB JAFFE 
The Stanford men's volleyball team looks
to back up its high preseason ranking with a
fast start to the regular season.
After a remarkable turnaround last year
and a final. No. 9 national ranking, the Cardi
nal was recently ranked No. K by the Ameri
can Volleyball Coaches Association. The
players see it as a clear sign of good things to
come in 2009.
"It's very exciting; it shows how far we've
come." said junior setter Kawika Shoji, an
All-American in 2008. "It means a lot to fi
nally be ranked in the top-10 in preseason."
The ranking has not, however, been met
with universal acclaim, even on a team that
won just three games two seasons ago.
"All the same, we feel a little slighted," Shoji
added. "We feel it could be higher. It'll be a
good challenge for us to work our way up."
"It was a fair assessment I think," head
coach John Kosty said. "But we want to
prove we're better than that."
Regardless of ranking, the team feels con
fident about its prospects for this season.
"I feel really good about this team." Kosty
continued. "This recruiting class helped to
upgrade many of our positions, and now we
have depth in all positions, which is some
thing we've really missed."
The freshman class is projected as one of
the best in the nation. Outside hitter Brad
Lawson was the top recruit in the country last
year, while middle blocker Gus Ellis and
libero Erik Shoji were the highest recruits in
their respective positions. Outside hitter
Dylan Kordic and setter Evan Barry are both
expected to compete for playing time and
have immediate impacts on the team. The
team can already see the talent level has im
proved. and is looking forward to the season.
"I'm really happy with the way we've pro
gressed during the fall season," Shoji said."lt
not only gives experience for the freshmen,
but it helps all of us work together."
Despite the talent, the players still feel
teamwork will need to be one of their biggest
assets if they are to succeed in a tough
league.
"I think team cohesiveness is our biggest
strength," said middle blocker Brandon
Williams, one of four returning seniors. "We

UC-SANTA BARBARA ELEPHANT BAR
INVITATIONAL
1/9-10 Santa Barbara, Calif.
GAME NOTES: The Cardinal men will open their season at
the Santa Barbara tournament ranked No. 8 nationally.
Stanford's first match of the year will come against No. 9
BYU, in what should be a tough test early to start the new
year. The Cougars racked up a 25-5 record in 2008,
but graduated a pair of Ail-Americans in middle blocker
Russell Holmes and outside hitter Ivan Perez. The Cardi
nal, meanwhile, returns All-American junior setter Kawi
ka Shoji and adds the top recruit in the nation in fresh

do a great job of playing together as a team."
But the Cardinal knows it has a lot of
work to do in order to contend in both the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF)
and in the nation.
"Serving is always something to improve
on." Williams said. "Also defense â€” block
ing and digging behind the block is really im
portant. If we can turn those into points, we'll
succeed."
Stanford is going to need to live up to the
lofty expectations in order to make it
through a brutal league. The Cardinal plays
in the MPSF. which is by far the most talent
ed conference in the country: 11 of its 12
teams are ranked in the top-20 in the nation.
With tough league play and daunting non
conference games at Ohio State and versus
Lewis, the Cardinal knows this will not be an
easy year.
"Our league is always strong," Williams
said. "We expect it to be difficult. We just
have to take it one week at a time, and it goes
really quickly."
To start off the season, the Cardinal will
participate in the Elephant Bar Invitational
at UC-Santa Barbara this weekend. Jan. 9-
10. The first match of the season is against
preseason No. 9 BYU on Friday at 1 p.m.. fol
lowed by either Long Beach State or UC-
Irvine later that night. These tough matches
aren't scaring the Stanford team, though.
"It should be a really good challenge for

us," Shoji said. "It will be the perfect oppor
tunity to see how we compare to some of the
best teams in the country."
The Cardinal will indeed see how it stacks
up against the best teams, with seven of the
eight teams competing at the tournament
ranked in the top-15. Despite the difficult

opponents. Kosty was extremely clear when
asked his team's goal for the tournament.
"We're looking to win it."he said."All the
experience and figuring stuff out is done.
From here on out. everything counts."
