# Cardinal's '09 looks bright
## 
### 
I know those of you who have
been following The Inside Pitch
since it began some months ago
are aware that 1, possibly more
than any other writer in The
Daily's history, like to squeeze in
stories and columns about hockey
as much as possible. I also know
that many of you here in the win
terless land of coastal California
(don't tell me 50 degrees and rainy
constitutes winter) have no partic
ular love of hockey and I appreci
ate you sticking with me while I let
my Minnesota side exercise its
homesickness.
But this week, despite how per
fect it would be to write about the
Winter Classic or how amazingly
successful the Sharks have been at
home (I'm saving that one), I will
spare you all by writing about only
Stanford sports.
Don't worry; this won't be a dull
"year in review" piece. Rather. I
would like to start the year by
looking forward in a sort of "year
in preview," if you will. So now,
without further ado. The Inside
Pitch presents a sampling of things
the Cardinal faithful have to
dream about in 2009.
Double the Madness
Both men's and women's bas
ketball are already underway and
both have entered the conference
portion of their seasons witli solid
records. Could both make noise in
the NCAA Tournament this year?
The women should qualify and be
highly seeded. The men are ex
ceeding everyone's expectations
after the loss of Trent Johnson and
the Lopez twins. Two teams in the
Sweet 16 would certainly make
winter quarter dead week livelier.
Tennis on Top
Men's and women's tennis re
turn to action next week after the
holiday break and conference plav
is just over a month away. Each
team ended last season in the top
-25 of the national rankings and
both should compete for this year's
Pac-10 crow n.The men specifically
have some new freshman that
could definitely make some noise.
Dual national champions would
certainly he a lot to ask. but it's not
impossible. And the point of this
column is to dream about all the
good things 2009 could bring,
right?
A Return to Rosenblatt
The Cardinal exceeded every
one's expectations (except its own)
on the diamond last season. After
falling just short of reaching the fi
nals of last year's College World
Series, the national media is taking
notice. The "Collegiate Baseball
