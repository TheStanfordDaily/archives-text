# Cardinal's '09 looks bright
## 
### 
I know those of you who have
been following The Inside Pitch
since it began some months ago
are aware that 1, possibly more
than any other writer in The
Daily's history, like to squeeze in
stories and columns about hockey
as much as possible. I also know
that many of you here in the win
terless land of coastal California
(don't tell me 50 degrees and rainy
constitutes winter) have no partic
ular love of hockey and I appreci
ate you sticking with me while I let
my Minnesota side exercise its
homesickness.
But this week, despite how per
fect it would be to write about the
Winter Classic or how amazingly
successful the Sharks have been at
home (I'm saving that one), I will
spare you all by writing about only
Stanford sports.
Don't worry; this won't be a dull
"year in review" piece. Rather. I
would like to start the year by
looking forward in a sort of "year
in preview," if you will. So now,
without further ado. The Inside
Pitch presents a sampling of things
the Cardinal faithful have to
dream about in 2009.
Double the Madness
Both men's and women's bas
ketball are already underway and
both have entered the conference
portion of their seasons witli solid
records. Could both make noise in
the NCAA Tournament this year?
The women should qualify and be
highly seeded. The men are ex
ceeding everyone's expectations
after the loss of Trent Johnson and
the Lopez twins. Two teams in the
Sweet 16 would certainly make
winter quarter dead week livelier.
Tennis on Top
Men's and women's tennis re
turn to action next week after the
holiday break and conference plav
is just over a month away. Each
team ended last season in the top
-25 of the national rankings and
both should compete for this year's
Pac-10 crow n.The men specifically
have some new freshman that
could definitely make some noise.
Dual national champions would
certainly he a lot to ask. but it's not
impossible. And the point of this
column is to dream about all the
good things 2009 could bring,
right?
A Return to Rosenblatt
The Cardinal exceeded every
one's expectations (except its own)
on the diamond last season. After
falling just short of reaching the fi
nals of last year's College World
Series, the national media is taking
notice. The "Collegiate Baseball


Erik
Adams
The Inside Pitch
Newspaper" has ranked Stanford
No. 5 in its preseason poll, and with
a returning core of young players
and veteran coach Mark Marquess
at the helm, another trip to Omaha
is a real possibility.
More Penna Perfection
If you have yet to see Missy
Penna of the Softball team pitch in
a game, this is your last chance.The
senior has thrown four no-hitters
in her career at Stanford and has a
legitimate shot at recording anoth
er each time she steps into the cir
cle. She is an amazing athlete to
watch and everyone interested in
softball. or baseball for that mat
ter. should bike across campus and
take a look. Will she throw a per
fect game in her final season on the
Farm? Could she throw two?
Postseason Puck

Okay, 1 lied. Hockey snuck in
here ... I got 500 words in and
couldn't resist any longer. But it is
worth getting excited about. The
Stanford club is having one of its
best seasons in years and has a real
chance at making the Pac-8 tour
nament next month. Wouldn't it be
fun to be able to boast to your USC
buddies that Stanford has a better
hockey team? Plus they have the
coolest logo of any Stanford team.
That angry tree is just awesome.
Bowl Eligibility
Sure this is on the other side of
summer, but it is still a part of 2009.
The football team keeps improv
ing and last year they just missed a
bowl game. 2009 could be the year
that the Cardinal finally gets to
play after Christmas again.
There are plenty more things I
can think of that would be fun to
see happen on the Farm in 2009.
but there just isn't room. And 1 am
sure many exciting things will hap
pen that I couldn't have thought
of. But the point is that the year is
young, and when you are a sports

fan at a school that wins the Direc
tor's Cup every year, you should
have lofty dreams for your teams.
Stanford athletes will do great
things this year, but that shouldn't
surprise anyone. Just sit back and
enjoy the show.

We 're betting it killed amateur Nos
tradamus Erik Adams that he was
n't able to preview Friday's Min
nesota-North Dakota hockey
grudge match, lint if yon ask nicely,
he'd probably fill you in. Contact
him at ekadatns@stanford.edu.
