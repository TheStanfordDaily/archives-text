### KENAN JIANG CHRISTIAN L. TOM STAFF WRITERS 
After a two-month layoff, the Stan
ford men's swimming team will com
pete against Pacific this Saturday for its
first competition of the new year.
"This meet will be a good gauge of
where we are at this point in the sea
son." senior captain Jason Dunford
said. "We re working towards our end
goal with huge enthusiasm, which has
built since our performance at Texas
Since then, we've been training really
well, guys have looked really good in
the water â€” so there is a lot of excite
ment to get into taper phase, get some
rest and swim fast."
Since its last meet, the Nov. 23 Texas
A&M invite, the second-ranked Cardi
nal has trained through the holiday
break in preparation for the ultimate
goal of winning the Pacific-10 Confer
ence Championships in March, and
then trying to bring home a national
title. Under the guidance of head coach
Skip Kenney. Stanford has won a record
27 Pac-10 titles in a row. Last year. Stan
ford finished third at NCAAs behind
winner Arizona and runner-up Texas
Stanford has not won the NCAA title
since the 1997-98 season but has not fin
ished worse than fourth since.
"The whole team is excited to start
swimming meets again," senior captain
Paul Kornfeld said. "We've been train
ing for two months, so it is fun to enter
the college dual meet season. We're ex
cited to start racing again and just to
keep getting better as the season goes
on."
With depth in all events, the Stan
ford team seems poised to make anoth
er serious run at the national champi
onship. The meet against Pacific will be
a good indicator of where the swimmers
are in their training and will also high
light the things that they will need to
work on in the next three months

FIRST PLACE
UP NEXT PACIFIC

So far, Stanford has achieved five
"A" cut qualification times and 35 "B"
cut qualification times for the NCAA
Championships. "A" qualifiers cam- an
automatic berth to the championships
while "B" qualifiers fill out the rest of
the spots not occupied by "A" qualifiers
in each event. After the advent of new
suit technology in the lead-up to the
2008 Olympics by big swim companies
like Speedo,Arena,Tvr and BlueSeven
tv, the "A" qualification times have been
significantly lowered. Many events this
year may possibly only have three to
four "A" qualifiers with the rest of the
participants having "B" times.

Dunford has recorded the fastest time
for the Cardinal, clocking in at 19.44.

seems likely to swim the 2(X) free. 500
free, 200 fly and 8(X) free relav for the

Cardinal in the coming meets. Fresh

mate NCAA contender in the 1650 free
