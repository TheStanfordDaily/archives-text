# Owens and Stanford exceed expectations
## 
### BY HALEY MURPHY STAFF WRITER 
A lot has changed in Stanford men's basketball
since the start of last winter quarter. This in
cludes the disappearance of every substantially
contributing frontcourt member aside from
Lawrence I lilt. With the gaping 14 (cumulative)-
foot hole that was left down low by the N'BA-bound Lopez
twins, the roster's shortcomings would have been daunting
for any coach, not to mention a new one.
But. in only a few months of work with the team. Johnny
Dawkins may have found the answer to the post problem: 6-
foot-8 sophomore Josh Owens. Or. at least. Owens is well on
his way to becoming that answer.
"Bv and large. I think he's getting better." Dawkins said of
Owens."He's understanding what we want, and I can say he's
facing some of the best big men in this country, not just in the
Pac-10.1 think he's doing a really good job with it. He keeps
coming back, he keeps battling, and that's all you can ask for."
Owens spent last year playing opposite the Lopez twins
during training sessions. But with only a few minutes' worth
of game experience prior to this season, his work in practice
wouldn't necessarily translate to game situations. It is for this
reason that Dawkins was able to approach Arizona State cen
ter Jeff Pendergraph's 31-point performance against Owens
as a to-be-expected step in his development. And why he
could hope that Owens would return to the floor to nearly
halve his next opponent's success, as he did on Jan. 4 against
Arizona's Jordan Hill (held to 17).
"Every time we face an opponent like |Pendergraph], for
Josh, it's an opportunity to grow." Dawkins said. "The guys
that he's facing have amazing experience and they're talent
ed. Any time he's able to see what they're capable of doing
with their abilities, he can figure things out about our own
game that you can't always teach in practice.That experience
of him being out on the floor is invaluable at this time."
In fact, after Owens averaged just 5.8 minutes per game
last year, senior point guard Mitch Johnson said he considers
Owens a "true freshman." With or without this misnomer, the
freshest face in the Cardinal lineup is learning fast.
Perhaps more importantly, though, he wants to learn.
Scholastically, Owens proved himself serious about learning
long before he arrived at the Farm. According to Johnson,
during his recruiting visit to Stanford. Owens spent his down
time memorizing 100 Chinese characters for an exam in "In
troduction to Chinese." instead of discovering the campus so
cial scene, as usually happens on such visits. This desire to
learn has carried over to life at Stanford, w here Owens plans
to major in economics.
Likewise, that thirst for growth is ever-present on the
court. When Owens was asked what aspect of his game need
ed the most improvement, his answer came in the form of a
modest "everything."
Coach Dawkins correspondingly has little doubt that
Owens' improvement will come as a result of this strong work
ethic and intense passion.
"Before we went to plav Yale. 1 just happened to see him
at a table, and I went and sat with him," Dawkins said. "I told
him that I thought he could be a very good college player.
Then I asked him. Well, how good do you want to be?" If you
could've seen the passion in his eyes when he told me.'l want
to be really good, coach." you would know who Josh is. The
way he said it. I'll never forget it: it sent chills up m\ body ac
tually. I said.'Wow. I've heard kids say things before, but the
passion you said it with was special.' And that's who he is.
"It's a process for him,and [he's] not going to accomplish
