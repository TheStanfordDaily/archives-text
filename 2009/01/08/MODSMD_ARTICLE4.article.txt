## No. 11 Card set for home-opener vs. Huskies 
### ERIK ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
When the Cardinal opened its season with an
extremely physical victory over Minnesota
nearly two months ago, the emphasis was on ag
gressiveness and team toughness. Fourteen
games later, nothing has changed.
After sweeping last weekend in Arizona. No.
11 Stanford (11-3, 2-0 Pacific-10 Conference)
will look to win its first conference game in
Maples Pavilion tonight against Washington (5-
6, 1-0 Pac-10). Again, the focus is on physical
play.
"We need to play more aggressive than we
did at Arizona." senior forward Jillian Harmon
said."We need to always work to improve as in
dividuals and as a team if we want to win. We
weren't aggressive enough [last weekend], and
that has to change."
If the Cardinal can increase the physicality
without sacrificing other areas of their game, it
certainly doesn't look like Washington stands
much of a chance.Hie I luskies have been incon
sistent so far this season.as their record shows. In

their last five games.the team is 2-3 and has been
outscored by an average of 11 .b points per game.
But those numbers are a bit deceptive; they
are heavily influenced by a 109-51 blowout loss
against top-ranked Connecticut. The Huskies
are fresh off a 71-5N victory over rival Washing
ton State last weekend.
Additionally. Washington boasts several le
gitimate scoring threats on its roster, which the
Cardinal will need to neutralize. Junior for
ward/center Laura McLellan leads the team
with 11.5 points per game. Junior guard/forward
Sami Whitcomb is averaging 11 points per game
and is a defensive threat as well, ranking third in
the Pac-lOwith 2.5 steals per game.
Still. Stanford has every reason to be confi
dent. The Cardinal is averaging a full 10 points
more per game than Washington and has five
players (not counting the inured J.J. Hones) av
eraging over nine points per game.The I luskies
have just two. Washington shoots just over 39
percent from the floor as a team, and Stanford
has held its opponents to just 3b percent.
