## No. 11 Card set for home-opener vs. Huskies 
### ERIK ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
When the Cardinal opened its season with an
extremely physical victory over Minnesota
nearly two months ago, the emphasis was on ag
gressiveness and team toughness. Fourteen
games later, nothing has changed.
After sweeping last weekend in Arizona. No.
11 Stanford (11-3, 2-0 Pacific-10 Conference)
will look to win its first conference game in
Maples Pavilion tonight against Washington (5-
6, 1-0 Pac-10). Again, the focus is on physical
play.
"We need to play more aggressive than we
did at Arizona." senior forward Jillian Harmon
said."We need to always work to improve as in
dividuals and as a team if we want to win. We
weren't aggressive enough [last weekend], and
that has to change."
If the Cardinal can increase the physicality
without sacrificing other areas of their game, it
certainly doesn't look like Washington stands
much of a chance.Hie I luskies have been incon
sistent so far this season.as their record shows. In

their last five games.the team is 2-3 and has been
outscored by an average of 11 .b points per game.
But those numbers are a bit deceptive; they
are heavily influenced by a 109-51 blowout loss
against top-ranked Connecticut. The Huskies
are fresh off a 71-5N victory over rival Washing
ton State last weekend.
Additionally. Washington boasts several le
gitimate scoring threats on its roster, which the
Cardinal will need to neutralize. Junior for
ward/center Laura McLellan leads the team
with 11.5 points per game. Junior guard/forward
Sami Whitcomb is averaging 11 points per game
and is a defensive threat as well, ranking third in
the Pac-lOwith 2.5 steals per game.
Still. Stanford has every reason to be confi
dent. The Cardinal is averaging a full 10 points
more per game than Washington and has five
players (not counting the inured J.J. Hones) av
eraging over nine points per game.The I luskies
have just two. Washington shoots just over 39
percent from the floor as a team, and Stanford
has held its opponents to just 3b percent.

NOTES; The No. 7 Cardinal women tri
umphed against Arizona State and Arizona
on the road to open the Pac-10 season
and face their first conference foe at home
tonight. The Huskies are led by a pair of
juniors offensively in forward Laura McClel
lan and guard Somi Whitcomb, who are
averaging 1 1.5 and 11 points per game,
respectively. Washington has dominated its
opposition in the turnover categories this
season, notching 122 while its opponents
have combined for just 93.

The No. 11 Cardinal went 4-2 over winter break, but won its first two Pac-10 games of the season
against Arizona and ASU. Stanford opens its home conference schedule tonight against Washington,
The Cardinal has history firmly in
its corner as well, holding a 34-14
record all-time against Washington —
Stanford hasn't lost at home against
them since 1999.
But Stanford certainly isn't taking
anything for granted. Injur)' troubles
have left the Cardinal with a short
bench, and there really is no room for
error.
"We need everybody at their best
this year," sophomore guard
Jeanette Pohlen said. "With only 10
healthy players, everyone has to be
ready — everyone needs to work
hard on their shooting, their defense
and their free throws."
So far. the injuries haven't slowed
Stanford down in the win column,
largely because so many different
players have contributed.
Junior center Jayne Appel is in the
top-50 nationally in field-goal per-

"We want to win
every single home
game, all year."
JULIAN HARMON,
senior forward

centage, rebounds per game and
blocked shots per game. Freshman
forward Nnemkadi Ogwumike is sec
ond in the Pac-10 in shooting percent
age and Pohlen is second in three
point baskets per game. Ogwumike
and Harmon also each posted their
first double-doubles of the season last
weekend in Arizona.
If the Cardinal keeps getting that

diversity and level of production from
its roster and can increase its aggres
siveness, it will remain a very difficult
team to beat, especially on its home
court.
Stanford is IK6-12 all-time against
the Pac-10 in Maples Pavilion and has
won 103 of its last 110 home games.
"We want to win every single home
game, all year." Harmon said. "That is
one of our goals."
A win tonight would not only run
their home record this season to 6-0.
but start the in-conference home win
ning streak for 2009.
ITie game tonight is scheduled to
begin at 7 p.m.The Cardinal will con
tinue this weekend against Washing

ond in the Pac-10 in shooting percent
age and Pohlen is second in three
point baskets per game. Ogwumike
and Harmon also each posted their
first double-doubles of the season last
weekend in Arizona.
If the Cardinal keeps getting that

diversity and level of production from
its roster and can increase its aggres
siveness, it will remain a very difficult
team to beat, especially on its home
court.
Stanford is IK6-12 all-time against
the Pac-10 in Maples Pavilion and has
won 103 of its last 110 home games.
"We want to win every single home
game, all year." Harmon said. "That is
one of our goals."
A win tonight would not only run
their home record this season to 6-0.
but start the in-conference home win
ning streak for 2009.
ITie game tonight is scheduled to
begin at 7 p.m.The Cardinal will con
tinue this weekend against Washing
ton State on Saturday at 2 p.m., also at
