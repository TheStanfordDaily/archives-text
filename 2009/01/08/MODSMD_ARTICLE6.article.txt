## POLITICS Chu chosen as new Sec. of Energy Obama appoints former Stanford professor to head Dept. of Energy 
### RYAN MAC STAFF WRITER 
Steven Chu, former head of the physics
department at Stanford, has been nominated by
President-elect Barack Obama to be Secretary
of Energy. When he takes office later this month,
Chu. a renowned scientist and the 1998 Nobel
laureate in physics, will be expected to tackle
what many science professionals and political
analysts are calling a national energy crisis.
Chu had served on the Stanford faculty from
1987 to 2004, chairing the Physics Department
from 1990 to 1993 and from 1999 to 2001. At the
time of his cabinet selection. Chu was the direc
tor of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
(LBNL) as well as a professor at UC-Berkeley.
The President-elect explained his choice last
month.
"Dr. Chu is uniquely suited to be our next
energy secretary." Obama said in a press release
from Lawrence Berkeley Labs."He's been work
ing at the cutting edge of our nation's efforts for
cleaner forms of energy."
"The scientists at our national labs will have a
distinguished leader at their helm." he added.
At Stanford, former students and colleagues
applauded Obama's decision. Among them is
Prof. Patricia Burchat. chair of the physics
department.
"When Steve went to LBNL as director, he
took on a major leadership role in renewable
energy and energy efficiency," Burchat wrote in
an email to The Daily. "He has supported exist

ing programs, started new initiatives and become
a national figure on energy issues."
"I believe Steve Chu is not only qualified for
the top energy position in the country, but he is
very likely to shake things up in energy research
and in the support of basic research in the phys
ical sciences." Burchat added.
While at Stanford. Chu was not only chair of
the physics department but also a pioneering
developer of an interdisciplinary project now
known as Bio-X. Chu. who is a molecular and
cellular biologist in addition to being a physi
cist. along with current Prof. James Spudich,
presented this notion of an interdisciplinary sci
ence collaboration to then-Provost
Condoleezza Rice in the early 19905. Today,
Bio-X is a renowned on-campus program that
unites the disciplines of biology, physics, chem
istry, engineering, computational sciences and
clinical sciences to tackle complex, interrelated
problems.

Spudich, the original director of the Bio-X
program, believes Chu's wide-ranging scientific
background can only assist him in making com
plex energy decisions.
"Steve is an incredibly talented individual
who. among other things, has a deep interest in
energy issues for the future," Spudich said.
"Solving our energy crisis will demand an inter
disciplinary approach, and, of course, the Bio-X
program exemplifies just that."
Former student and current engineering pro
fessor Steven Quake echoed this sentiment.
"I was fortunate to be able to work in [Chu's
lab through Bio-X], and it made an indelible
impression on me." Quake said. "1 think it is a
good sign for the country that a scientist of
Steve's caliber is willing to take on the challenge
of a cabinet appointment."
Prof. Chu could not be reached for comment.
