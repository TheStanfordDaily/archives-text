## GSC debates Univ. budget cuts 
### DAISY CHEN STAFF WRITER 
Last night, the Graduate Student Council (GSC)
made various funding approvals, reviewed staffing issues
and discussed University budget cuts.
Andy Hernandez, assistant dean of students, provid
ed GSC members with a brief overview of upcoming,
winter quarter graduate family events. The council
approved $2,500 to fund the Graduate Family Ice
Skating and Graduate Family Bowling events, to be held
on Jan. 17 and Feb. 21, respectively.
Fen Zhao, a graduate student in applied physics, led a
discussion to flesh out the funding details for the
Graduate Student Programming Board (GSPB) co
sponsored Winter Party. Since the graduate formal was
moved to spring quarter, funding is available for a win
ter quarter party for graduate students.
Currently, the only co-sponsored event planned this
quarter is the Valentine's Party, which is tentatively
scheduled to take place in the Graduate Community
Center (GCC) Havana Room. In addition, the Sandy
Greenfield Group (acoustic rock and hip hop). Hey
Young Believer (indie pop-rock), feature group Brad
Wolfe (acoustic rock) and the Moon are slated to per
form live.
Ultimately, the GSC decided to upgrade certain
drinks and increase funding for the Winter Party by $600
to $2,(KX).
GSC members also lobbied for their favorite film on
the Flicks winter roster to determine which Sunday
would be graced with GSC-sponsored Krispy Kreme
donuts. "Milk," featuring Sean Penn as the gay rights
activist and politician Harvey Milk, won a tie-breaker
vote with comedy "Zack and Miri Make a Porno."
The GSC equipment reservation and rental, which is
electronically managed by the GSC, was lacking person
nel controlling the inventory and check-out of equip
ment. Co-Chair Polina Segalova, a graduate student in
mechanical engineering, solved the problem by offering
the possibility of a salary, and three GSC members
expressed interest.
Finally, the GSC discussed the University budget
cuts. ASSU Executive Jonny Dorsey '09 informed the
GSC that budget-cut talks during the final week of fall

quarter were productive, and that he is looking forward
to a meeting with Provost John Etchemendy and Vice
Provost Timothy Warner
Despite the threat of impending budget cuts, GSC
members had difficulty finding programs with signifi
cant graduate community components that were thor
oughly unnecessary.
"Shifting funding sources temporarily this time is not
an option," wrote President Hennessy in response to
Segalova and Co-Chair 112 Jeorge Bloom's email detailing
a list of programs the graduate students wanted to main-
tain. "Prepare a list of programs where
benefits-to-costs ratios are low."
Some argued that superfluous
funding should be cut in numerous

smaller areas, while others found it
necessary to spend less time with
smaller allocations and focus on cut
ting larger programs.
Finally, Bloom pointed out that it
was meaningless to debate the impor
tance of various programs without
more transparency and awareness in
University budgeting and funding al
locations.

"I think it's great that [Hen
nessv] was so blunt to come out and
say that." Dorsey said in response to
the president's remark. "We should
take advantage of that to get more
data, more clarifying of the budget
ing."
