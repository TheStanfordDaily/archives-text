Dear Ski Bunny,
It is in fact true that consuming alcoholic beverages at high elevation will get you drunker faster. Another snow trip-related
quagmire is the use of mysterious hot tubs at rental condos and motels. Not only will soaking in foreign waters make you dehy
drated if you're boozing, jacuzzis are breeding grounds for bacteria and other nasties. I have a friend, let's call him Adam, who
developed a devilish rash on his you-know-what after his snow trip. His girlfriend wouldn't touch him for three weeks. Needless
to say, while it may be tempting to play footsie under the bubbles with your new flame, I would strongly recommend keeping
the heat between the sheets and out of the tub.
DP
Got a burning question you can't ask anyone else?
