# PAGE 2 on the road
## intermission editor's note 
### 
Happy New Year, devoted readers. Oh Nine came in with a bang: the recession is in full force, there are
bombs over Gaza and the Stanford Daily moved into a new building behind Old Union. For us seniors,
this year's ball drop signaled the year of our alleged graduation from college, and with the "real world"
in its current state, it's even harder to imagine leaving the Farm. Luckily, Mae took this winter break as
an opportunity to see the world before it implodes. This page features heartwarming photographs she
took in Israel and Egypt. We hope they will inspire you to go somewhere new, to take an artsy picture
or at the very least, to keep reading intermission every week.
Loyally,
kelsey & mae
