# FiLM REVIEW
## "Revolutionary Road" leads an all-star team to nowhere 
### 
This holiday movie season has been
unusual in that so many of the most
talked-about films have actually lived
up to the hype. "Milk" is just as socially con
scious and inspiring as its ads make it out to
be, "Doubt" provides a ton of what its title
promises, and"The Curious Case of
Benjamin Button" makes for just the right
combination of Forrest Gump and Roald
Dahl.
Yet sitting amongst these high-concept
projects and heart-rending performances is a
giant fraud. It certainly looks like an Oscar
winner and sounds like an Oscar winner, and
it may well end up being an Oscar winner,
but that doesn't necessarily make it a good
story.
It's true that Paramount Vantage's
"Revolutionary Road" seems like a sure thing.
When taking a cursory look at the movie on
Wikipedia or IMDb, there is much to be
excited about. Of course there is the cast,
which for the first time reunites the

the surface yet who in reality loathe their lives
and each other.
And yet, despite all the movie has going
for it, it fails to deliver. From start to finish,
the film — like the Wheelers' marriage — is

DiCaprio and Kate Winslet (not to
mention the unsinkable Kathy
Bates). Then there's a proven
director in Sam Mendes
("American Beauty") telling his
type of story. Finally, the subject
matter is undeniably compelling:

urbanites whose marriage seems perfect on This much is evident right from the opening

scene, a long argument on the side of a road
between Frank and April that becomes very
intense very quickly. It's a bold start to the
story, and an interesting attempt at a hook by
screenwriter Justin Haythe. Yet the scene

itself, which takes place before the audience
knows anything about the characters, is
remarkably tedious. After all, the audience
does not know the Wheelers yet, they don't

like the Wheelers yet, and they don't particu
larly care about the Wheeler's problems. All
the scene really amounts to is fifteen minutes
or so of "acting."
From that scene onward, the film is clear
to the point of being heavy-handed in sug
gesting that its story is universal, a searing
portrayal of the quintessential 50's American
couple. Yet in its attempt to capture the dis
satisfied spirit of that entire generation, the
movie quickly becomes bland and trite.
Frank and April constantly spout vague, vir
tually meaningless cliches about how unhap
py they are deep inside, and when the other
characters try to make them feel better by
saying things like, "You're special," or, "You're
the Wheelers," there is simply no emotional
resonance. The audience hasn't been given
any reasons to like the leads or even see
what's unique about them. The Wheelers do
not surprise or endear themselves to their
viewers in the least; in fact, it seems that all
they really do the entire movie is have awk
ward dinners, carry on illicit affairs, and
throw furniture. Just like the trailer — only
two hours longer!
Of course, with all the talent involved,
"Revolutionary Road" is not a complete fail
ure. The film's soundtrack, costumes and cin
ematography for instance, are spot-on. In
addition, some of the performances and
scenes do meet their mark — Bates' turn as
chatty neighbor Helen Givings, for instance,
and the movie's memorable final scene and
