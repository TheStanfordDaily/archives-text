# For classic Jack, tune in to "24"

After striving for "Redemption" back in
November — and in the end, merely
setting the stage — it is now time for
"24" to truly redeem itself.
Any fan of the real-time epic will tell you
it's good just to sec Jack Bauer (Keifer
Sutherland) kicking some terrorist ass again.
After more than a year of delays — partly
due to the writers' strike and partly due to
concerns about the decreasing quality of the
show — season seven of "24" finally pre
mieres with two back-to-back episodes this
Sunday at 8 p.m., followed by another two
hours on Monday.
Aside from the relief of a new season,

though, "24" fans have been looking for the
series to return to its roots: nonstop action
that only takes a break for some tense drama,
along with stylish direction. And from the
first few minutes, it seems the producers have
it under control. A kidnapping, a legal hear
ing for Bauer, feuding in the White House
and a threat to air traffic control systems are
so tightly packed in the first two hours it's as
if the creators are almost trying too hard.
But that's not necessarily a bad thing. So
far, there's none of the outrageous melodra
ma that crippled season six, including over
the-top terrorist situations or Jack Bauer's
family baggage.

Instead, season seven begins with a con
tinuation of the events in "Redemption," but
with a few months passed. Bauer is back in
the U.S., facing a Senate hearing on the
human rights violations of the now-disband
ed Counterterrorism Unit (CTU), and
President Allison Taylor (Cherry Jones) is
facing a genocide in Sangala, while her hus
band investigates the mysterious death of
their son.
At the same time, America is under
attack by a group who has gained access to
air traffic control. When Bauer is brought on
board by the FBI to investigate — interrupt
ing his Senate hearing to be revisited at the
end of the day/season — he finds that old
friend and former CTU agent Tony Almeida
(Carlos Bernard), who Bauer thought was
dead, is supposedly behind the attacks.
Refusing to believe that Almeida has turned
sides in the fight against terrorism, Bauer
agrees to help the FBI find him in hopes of
learning the truth.
FBI agent Renee Walker (Annie
Wersching) has him on a tight leash, though,
and with a Senate ready to crucify him,
Bauer's pursuits become all the more difficult

as he has to weigh his loyalties, his duty to
his country and the escalating consequences
of his old habits as an agent.
It's exactly this kind of drama that has
made "24" a hit, and it hopefully means sea
son seven is on good footing. Beside an
excellent few plotlines, the premiere features
some crackling dialogue and clever direction
that only "24" could deliver.
It's a lean, mean version of "24," which is
exactly the way it should be. Once series reg
ulars like computer-whiz Chloe (Mary Lynn
Rajskub) appear, and a few of the plotlines
begin to intertwine (of course, there's a con
nection between Almeida's doings and the
