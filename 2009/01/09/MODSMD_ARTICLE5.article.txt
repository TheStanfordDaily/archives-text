# The
						sculptures in the Shadows

### 
Amidst the Palni trees and the well
manicured flowerbeds, Stanford's
campus is scattered with outdoor
sculptures. Pieces in the Papua New
Guinea sculpture garden and the Rodin
sculpture garden receive much attention
from students and tourists alike, but many
other sculptures exist outside of the lime
light. These less visited sculptures are still
famous works of art, such as Henry
Moore's "Large Torso: Arch" outside the
Art Library and Joan Miro's "Bird" near
the entrance to Annenberg Auditorium.
The beauty of outdoor sculptures is
their ability to exist in a space outside of a
museum. At once integrated into but also
responsible for the campus aesthetic,
Stanford's sculptures surprise the unaware
audience that lounges in the grass beneath
them. Art has infiltrated their everyday life
— as if these sculptures are museum fugi
tives hiding among branches and in the
shade, waiting to be noticed.
"Column 1" towers high above the
ground. This column, composed of three
different elements placed on top of each
other, can be found between Meyer and
the Law Library. It is sheltered by trees,
and often overlooked as students trudge to
the library or travel back home. However,
this sculpture is a beautiful abstract piece,
created out of steel planes positioned at
different angles. Throughout the day, the
progression of the sun's rays along the
sculpture allow each plane of metal to
reflect white light, or bend with warm grey
shadows.
The artist, James Rosati (1911-1988)
was an American abstract sculptor from
Pennsylvania. Rosati's sculptures are most
ly done in stone or steel, and almost always
deal with abstract forms in space. One of
his most famous sculptures was the stain
less steel "Ideogram" (1972) that was in the
plaza between the World Trade Center
towers in New York City, and unfortunate
ly destroyed in the events of 9/11. On the
Stanford Campus, "Column I" is particu
larly intriguing because of its placement
on a grass lawn underneath a tree that

towers above it. Many of Rosati's sculp
tures exist in urban environments sur
rounded by similar materials of stone and
steel. Instead, "Column I" provides a con
trast to its green natural neighbors and
raises questions about the tensions
between natural and man-made materials.
Down the path form Rosati's
"Column I" is an intricate arrangement of
rods and steel wires entitled "Mozart 1"
< 1982) by Kenneth Snelson. Snelson's
works involve the common basic elements
of steel rods strung together with tension
wires. Beyond the work's impressive engi
neering, there are elements of balance,
compression and tension that portray his
philosophy of forces. Snelson believes that
all of the forces of push and pull are essen
tial to the harmony of his works, as these
same "essential forces" arc also reflected in
the harmony of everyday life.
He creates a physical representation of
the balances of energies in our universe.
He speaks about this balance also in terms
of music, and has been quoted saying "the
wires and metal tubes are my keyboard, on
which I play my three-dimensional spatial
ghme." Because both music and abstract
art create ideas and evoke emotions with
out relying on the portrayal of objects,
music is often inspiration for abstract
artists.
The first artist credited by art histori
ans with creating these types of represen
tations in art was the Russian painter
Wassily Kandinsky. Kandinsky used certain
colors to represent tones and a lyrical line
to emote the rhythm of music. Here, with
"Mozart 1," Snelson focuses instead on the
philosophical connections between music
; and sculpture. Mozart's symphonies were
created with an exquisite level of balance
— each instrument was an element that
added to the harmonic whole. In the same
way, each one of Snelson's rods reflects the
same symphonic balance of forces in his
v sculpture. Remove one of the rods and the
sculpture collapses: the symphony is
destroyed.
On the opposite side of campus next

to the David Packard Engineering build
ing, sits a black slab of granite with a thin
layer of water that spills over its edges. A
system of overlapped circles and notches
on the granite tells time through different
revolutions that happen every minute,
hour and year. This sculpture, "Timetable,"
was done by Maya Lin — an artist popu
larly known for Washington DCs Vietnam
memorial, designed when she was still an
undergraduate at Yale University.
"Timetable" is both an engineering feat
and beautiful new take on the common
clock. With its face to the sky, this archi
tectural clock requires people to walk
towards it and hover as they tell time. In
contrast to the frantic glances that other
clock faces receive, this clock creates a
place of tranquility and peace, allowing
time to slow down for its visitors.
There are many sculptures on all parts

of the Stanford campus that are over
looked as students zoom past on their
bicycles. Take the time in the beginning of
this quarter to visit some of these sculp
tures, before the power of deadlines over
takes you. These outdoor sculptures repre
sent many important movements of art
history — and beyond the history of art,
the philosophies that these sculptures por
tray comment on pertinent elements in
our everyday lives.
