# Smell ya later: Roxy opposes the right to be stinky
## 
### 
■ n Halloween weekend I visited a girlfriend
I 1 of mine at her adorably quaint apartment.
But the minute I walked through her
door, I sensed, with my acutely sensitive schnoz, that some
thing was wrong.
Sniff... Sniff...
Somebody — somebody smelly was here .. . but who?
"Hiiii!" my friend squealed, wrapping me in a deli
cious bundle of feminine warmth. Then HE appeared. "This is
Jake," cooed my friend. "We traveled together in India two
years ago."
I feel terrible for saying this, but Jake smelled awful. I
cringed. Would he try to hug me? God granted me a hand
shake.
"Nice to meet you, Jake!" I said as cheerily as 1 could
while breathing through my mouth.
Bathing regularly and wearing deodorant were clearly
not high on Jake's daily To-Do list. He himself was a cool dude
— quirky, sarcastic, smart, conversant. An enormous bushy
beard and generally grungy appearance gave him a Sam Beam
crossed-with-Rip Van Winkle-y look. He'd spent the last five
months leading trail groups through the wilderness and sleep
ing on the ground. He'd read a lot of books. When we washed
dishes, he refused to use paper towels. All of this, however,
could not make up for the dreaded cloud of body odor that
loomed ominously about his disheveled person.
By letting one's bodily flavors ooze untamed from the
skin, sit and fester in all of the body's dark sweaty orifices, one

produces smells that are, for lack of a better word, GROSS! If
the average person can't stand the way you smell, your chances
of success in any kind of relationship are going to be slim.
"What's so bad about going au naturale? We're humans. That's
how we smell" the 8.0. advocate might say. But, NO!! That's
where they're wrong!! That's NOT how we smell because, dear
readers, we, the general public, wear deodorant.
At breakfast, Jake said, "I wonder if my time spent in
the wilderness has made me more socially awkward. I can't
seem to charm girls the way I used to."
"Or maybe it's the fact that you don't wear deodor
ant," my friend chuckled.
"That could be it, but I figure the girls who care aren't
right for me anyway."
What a pity that "the girls who care" make up the
majority of the female population. The truth is, seemingly
insignificant lifestyle choices — from sporting dreadlocks, tat
toos, a Ralph Lauren polo, or a body-shield of cologne or per
fume — narrow the spectrum of human beings a person
attracts. So before you throw away the deodorant, think hard
about the consequences! Is it really worth it to prevent future
relationships from starting, simply to smell a certain way?
Trust me, there are BETTER ways to stick it to the man.
