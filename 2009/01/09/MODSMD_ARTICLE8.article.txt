ST&M
with Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway
Opening today, Anne Hathaway's and Kate Hudson's
new movie deals with a problem so unsolvable
that I doubt it has been dealt with in any Stanford
class to date. What do you do when you and your very best
friend plan your weddings for the exact same day? This is
the premise for "Bride Wars," a romantic comedy starring
this dynamic duo of actresses. "Bride Wars" tells the story
of Emma (Hathaway) and Liv (Hudson) who have been
best friends since they were little, and have always dreamed
of having their respective weddings at the Plaza Hotel.
After extensive planning on each woman's part, they arc
informed that their weddings are planned for the exact
same day — and neither is willing to back down. This sets
the stage for exactly what the title predicts; a battle between
two formerly friendly, and now rabid, brides. The Stanford
Daily was lucky enough to be a part of a conference call
with Hathaway and Hudson. Here are just a few highlights
from the enlightening conversation.
Stanford Daily: Kate, you are listed as a producer for Bride
Wars. Do you have a particular method for choosing which
movies you're interested in producing? Anne, do you have
an interest in producing in the future?
Kate Hudson: No. In terms of movies that I have in devel
opment now, they run the gamut of all different types of
genres. I felt that this one was, because of the nature of
people and how people like to make comedies, and this
being such a really nice concept, high concept comedy, this
one was sort of really a nice one out the bat for me to be
able to get going. But it was really a long process. It was a
five-year development process, and now 1 think we're about
six and a half years of this movie being in process.
Anne Hathaway: I think it's something, theoretically, I find
appealing, but I've never felt compelled to do it up until
now. I think, like Kate was saying, it's a long process pro
ducing something, developing something, so I'd like to
make sure that it's a story I want to tell. To be honest, if I

produce, I most likely wouldn't act in it though.
Texas Woman's University: Most little girls fantasize and
plan exactly how they want their wedding day to be. What
were your fantasies as little girls?
KH: My fantasy when I was growing up was always more,
my parents weren't married, and we were always like, why
aren't you married? And we had it so ingrained in us that
you didn't need to sign a piece of paper to say that you're a
family or that you love each other. So that was how we
were programmed. Then, of course, I meet Chris [her now
ex-husband], and I'm like, "I'm getting married!" And then
all of a sudden I got really excited about it. So for me it was
really more about who was going to be the guy that I
would spend the rest of my life with, who would be my
partner. And then when I met that partner, I was very
excited about possibly calling up Vera Wang and seeing
what she could do for me.
AH: I think that I, in my fantasy, was like, well, Leonardo
DiCaprio and I will meet at some point, and he'll just see
me walking down the street and fall in love with me, and
that'll be that.
KH: Careful what you wish for!
AH: It was kind of a vague notion, and I just assumed that
Leo and I would find some kind of happy medium
between our two aesthetics, and have a glorious wedding. It
doesn't look like that's going to happen, however. So my
fantasies have taken a left turn. I actually have never really
planned my wedding, but like Kate, I was kind of more
thinking about the guys.
Baylor University: Both of you in interviews seem like real
ly likable, laidback women, but you have to tap into your
inner Bridczilla for the film. How did you do that?

AH: Imagination. We're human beings so I think we
understand what it's like to be jealous. What it's like to be
competitive or catty. Maybe we don't indulge those feel
ings. Maybe we try not to live in that world, but I think
those urges are understandable. So I think having experi
ence with that kind of helps. But also, the script was so
great in providing a logical emotional back story for the
characters to explain why they go off the deep end the way
that they do, why this war was in some ways a long time
coming, and so there was a certain freedom that the script
gave us because it was grounded in truth.
KH: I tapped into my inner Bridezilla by, I think, acknowl
edging and watching some of my friends go through some
stuff, and understanding the stress of it myself when I got
married, and 1 think the other thing is just as females, we
all know. We get really worked up. We're very emotional
creatures. And sometimes you can get a little carried away.
So for me, with this movie, it was so fun to be able to make
fun of ourselves. I think girls get crazy, but we can also
laugh at ourselves really well. We don't get the opportunity
to do that very often in movies, so it was really fun to be
able to do it with something as important as your wedding
day to a lot of women, as it should be. It is the day that
you're going to spend the rest of your life with, hopefully,
the man that you're marrying. So for me, it just felt sort of
like you can tap into all of those things from all of the
things you've learned as a girl throughout the years. For
me, it wasn't friends though — there is that girl who would
probably go to those lengths, and I just run as far away as I
can from girls like that. It's like uh-oh! I really think you
can smell it like a mile away. You can smell that girl who
would probably do things to start sabotaging your life.

now. I think, like Kate was saying, it's a long process pro
ducing something, developing something, so I'd like to
make sure that it's a story I want to tell. To be honest, if I

produce, I most likely wouldn't act in it though.
Texas Woman's University: Most little girls fantasize and
plan exactly how they want their wedding day to be. What
were your fantasies as little girls?
KH: My fantasy when I was growing up was always more,
my parents weren't married, and we were always like, why
aren't you married? And we had it so ingrained in us that
you didn't need to sign a piece of paper to say that you're a
family or that you love each other. So that was how we
were programmed. Then, of course, I meet Chris [her now
ex-husband], and I'm like, "I'm getting married!" And then
all of a sudden I got really excited about it. So for me it was
really more about who was going to be the guy that I
would spend the rest of my life with, who would be my
partner. And then when I met that partner, I was very
excited about possibly calling up Vera Wang and seeing
what she could do for me.
AH: I think that I, in my fantasy, was like, well, Leonardo
DiCaprio and I will meet at some point, and he'll just see
me walking down the street and fall in love with me, and
that'll be that.
KH: Careful what you wish for!
AH: It was kind of a vague notion, and I just assumed that
Leo and I would find some kind of happy medium
between our two aesthetics, and have a glorious wedding. It
doesn't look like that's going to happen, however. So my
fantasies have taken a left turn. I actually have never really
planned my wedding, but like Kate, I was kind of more
thinking about the guys.
Baylor University: Both of you in interviews seem like real
ly likable, laidback women, but you have to tap into your
inner Bridczilla for the film. How did you do that?

AH: Imagination. We're human beings so I think we
understand what it's like to be jealous. What it's like to be
competitive or catty. Maybe we don't indulge those feel
ings. Maybe we try not to live in that world, but I think
those urges are understandable. So I think having experi
ence with that kind of helps. But also, the script was so
great in providing a logical emotional back story for the
characters to explain why they go off the deep end the way
that they do, why this war was in some ways a long time
coming, and so there was a certain freedom that the script
gave us because it was grounded in truth.
KH: I tapped into my inner Bridezilla by, I think, acknowl
edging and watching some of my friends go through some
stuff, and understanding the stress of it myself when I got
married, and 1 think the other thing is just as females, we
all know. We get really worked up. We're very emotional
creatures. And sometimes you can get a little carried away.
So for me, with this movie, it was so fun to be able to make
fun of ourselves. I think girls get crazy, but we can also
laugh at ourselves really well. We don't get the opportunity
to do that very often in movies, so it was really fun to be
able to do it with something as important as your wedding
day to a lot of women, as it should be. It is the day that
you're going to spend the rest of your life with, hopefully,
the man that you're marrying. So for me, it just felt sort of
like you can tap into all of those things from all of the
things you've learned as a girl throughout the years. For
me, it wasn't friends though — there is that girl who would
probably go to those lengths, and I just run as far away as I
can from girls like that. It's like uh-oh! I really think you
can smell it like a mile away. You can smell that girl who
would probably do things to start sabotaging your life.
"Bride Wars" opens in theatres nationwide on January 9th.
