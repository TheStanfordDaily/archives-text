## Editorial Wellness Room only a small step in solving mental health crisis 
### 
At the end of the month, the ASSU will
unveil its new Wellness Room, a space
on the second floor of Old Union allo
cated to providing a calm, relaxing environ
ment for students to relax, unwind and obtain
resources on how to deal with mental health
issues.
While we laud the ASSU leadership for
making wellness and mental health a priority,
the editorial board believes a Wellness Room
is a feeble and inadequate solution to a seri
ous mental health crisis plaguing the Stanford
campus. We believe the funds and efforts
going towards the Wellness Room could be
much more efficiently allocated towards
more effective measures to combat mental
health.
As described by ASSU Chair of Mental
Health Angelina Cardona, the space "will be
a very relaxing, chill place" offering activities
like Sudoku, bean bag chairs, silly putty and
hula hoops, and perhaps occasional massage
therapy (See "XXXXX" in today's issue of
The Daily). As Cardona puts it.'i magine Jack
Johnson-style music, a good aroma and posi
tive decorations on the walls."
While these are good ways to unwind, the
idea of a Wellness Room seems too inade
quate and abstract in the wake of the mental
health crisis detailed in the 88-page report re
leased by the Student Mental Health and
Well-BeingTask Force in October 2(X)8. The
report highlighted significant weaknesses in
Stanford's mental health resources, most sig
nificantly the failure to meet the Internation
al Association of Counseling Services (I ACS)
recommended ratio of one full-time equiva
lent professional staff member for every
1 ,(XX) to 1,500 students and the failure to rec
ognize that academic success does not neces
sarily indicate sound mental health.
It is clear that the Wellness Room is a
brave effort to confront recommendations
generated by the report such as improving
the flow of information about mental health
and working to lessen the stress levels of stu
dents. High stress levels and depression are
important issues that should be addressed,
and the room will do much to build visibility
for mental health issues. We are also hopeful
that student volunteers will provide neces
sary mental health outreach and that students
will come to use the room in part as a mental

health resource.
Unfortunately, our concerns about the
room's practicality outweigh its potentially
positive benefits. The idea that Stanford
needs to create a small space in Old Union
because Students lack sufficient places to de
stress. hang out and relax is almost silly â€” it
could be accomplished almost anywhere,
from a cafe to the Oval to the Bender Room
in Green Library. Our beautiful campus al
ready offers so many de-stressing resources,
from our world-class athletic facilities to fun
courses like social dance and wine tasting.
And let us not forget that we have the Bay
Area and San Francisco right at our
doorsteps. Is a cramped room in Old Union
really the only way to get students to relax?
We recognize that the Wellness Room is
not meant to deal with the brunt of the Uni
versity's mental health problems. Nonethe
less, expecting a room offering yoga and mas
sages to make a significant dent in the mental
health crisis on campus does not take the
problem seriously enough.The ASSU should
use every campus resource as effectively as
possible and address more directly the areas
of weakness the report pointed out. Indeed,
the room will likely do little to reach out to
the students in need of mental health re
sources the most, as students struggling with
mental health stigmas will not want to be seen
rifling through brochures in the Wellness
Room.
The editorial board believes there are
other important recommendations in the
task force's report that should be addressed
by the ASSU. For example. Recommendation
12 calls for expanding programs and re
sources to support development of personal
relationships between students "so that they
feel connected and valued in their communi
ties." Recommendation 13 urges encouraging
and affirming diversity and reaching out to
members of the community whose "personal
background may make them more vulnera
ble to isolation and disconnection from their
peers and the wider community," such as first
generation college students, members of the
LGBT community or students of color.
Working to address these recommenda
tions would be a much better way for the
ASSU and the University to allocate funds
and effort. ASSU-sponsored initiatives pro-
