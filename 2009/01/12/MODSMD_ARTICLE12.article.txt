Dear President Hennessy.
In these troubling economic
times, I know you are facing
many hard, unpopular decisions
about which departments and pro
grams you can "give the axe." (Get
it? It's like what we say during —
eh,never mind.) Well, I recently had
to choose between buying an exter
nal hard drive or some DVDs I
wanted, so I can relate to the tough
choices that lie ahead for you.

Now. I know what you're wonder
ing: Who is this ruggedly handsome
kid spewing such sage, helpful ad
vice? Fair, though the fact that you
don't remember me is a little hurtful,
because we met on frosh move-in
day last year. I was dressed like a
clown, and you were dressed like a
guy in a suit. We shook hands, and it
was one of the highlights of my life.
But don't worry, I don't hold
your forgetfulness against you. In
fact, I am so not grudging that I am
giving you a lot of solutions for solv
ing the budget crisis, which I am
even prepared to let you take cred
it for.
Now. if I were you, the first thing
I would excise would be Stanford
Dining. This is nothing personal —
Dining is made up of a lot of dedi
cated. hard-working people who try
their best to give us the food we
need to be not hungry. However,
Stanford Dining is not In-N-Out,
and this is a fault I have yet to for
give them for.
I would also axe the guys who di

rect bicycle traffic around the
roundabouts. If freshmen can't get
into accidents at the former Inter
section of Death, how will they
learn that it's bad to get into bike
accidents? These are the kinds of
questions that haunt me when I am
trying to sleep.
Additionally, I'd get rid of any
department that does things that I
do not understand, on the basis that
people in those departments are al
ways using words that they might be
making up and. worse, that they
rarely discuss the television show
"The Office."
Examples of these departments
include astrophysics, regular
physics, astrobiology, astrology, gas
tronomy. metallurgy, witchcraft and
any department that routinely uses
the phrase "postmodern" in a non
ironic sense.
I'd also cut Otero. In addition to
harboring terrorists and transients,
Otero is an eyesore that I'm sure is
decreasing the property values of
the general Wilbur area. I advise
knocking it down immediately, and
when your crews are done, you can
direct them to Branner. I estimate
that this will save the school no less
than 73 million dollars.
Finally, I'd get rid of this cold
weather. "What are you talking
about?" you might ask. Come off it,
Hennessy. We both know that
weather that routinely dips below
40 has no place in California. Save
your horribly expensive weather
changing experiments for a lesser
state, like Nebraska, or lowa, or
Vermont, or Texas or any other
state in the Union, really. I'm tired
of wearing so many layers.
But, if I may be frank with you,
sir, we don't have to cut corners to
thrive in these tough times. Look at
the examples of FDR, Reagan and
future Obama — if we spend more
money than we have, it'll pour re
sources into the economy, thereby
creating jobs, products and free

money that we're only kind of tak
ing away from our children. Much
of this money could come back to us
via processes that my economist
friends assure me are real.
On a less technical note, I can
promise you that spending money is
much more fun than not spending
it. Do you really want to be the
president who oversaw cutting the
anthropology budget by five per
cent? Why not be the president who
oversaw building a giant ice skating
rink under Meyer?
And that's only the tip of the ice
berg (if English gets cut, we will all
have to use more cliches to save
money on original expressions).
You could turn Lake Lag into an
imitation savannah, complete with
elephants, giraffes and man-eating
lions. You could build a rollercoast
er around Hoover Tower, or you
could buy each dorm a fighter jet.
You could even construct a giant
laser to do science for us. If we build
one big enough, I estimate that we'll
be able to produce at least 15 per
cent more science than we current
ly do. That's a lot of science.
Better yet, you could invest in in
vesting itself. I offer a small consult
ing service, and while my fees have
been called blindingly high, I can
promise you that I will maintain the
high quality of advice you have al
ready seen in this letter/article.
I sincerely hope you will consid
er these possibilities, Mr. President.
As a student and a highly effective
consultant, I consider myself just as
invested in the school's success as
you are.That said. I'm glad I'm not
the one to tell the metallurgists
their department's being cut. ITiat
sounds rough.
Professionally yours,
Kevin Webb '
Oh. and if you're curious, I went
with the hard drive.

the one to tell the metallurgists
their department's being cut. ITiat
sounds rough.
Professionally yours,

Oh. and if you're curious, I went
with the hard drive.
