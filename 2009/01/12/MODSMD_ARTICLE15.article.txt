# Worshiping the diploma

In the Bush-Palin-Ann Coulter po
litical calculus, markers of the in
tellectual elite — those who write
hooks or proudly attend fancy univer
sities like Stanford — are seen as in
herently bad. To them, "real Ameri
cans" don't drink lattes or have
Ph.D.'s or read certain newspapers.
Intellectualism is the enemy. But is
the pendulum swinging the other way
in the post-Obama political climate?
Do markers of intelligence and elite
intellectual status now mean every
thing?
Possibly. Overtones of this swing
appeared in Obama's 2(XW campaign,
but Caroline Kennedy's maladroit
bid for the Senate is the best example.
When asked by The New York Times
why she wanted to be appointed the
new senator from New York,
Kennedy could barely articulate a
case for herself. She did say that she
was qualified because, "I've written
seven books — two on the Constitu
tion, two on American politics."
Then. Maureen Dowd.a Kennedy
supporter and New York Times
columnist, defended Kennedy by
writing,"People complain that the 51-
year-old Harvard and Columbia Law
School grad and author is not a glib,
professional pol who... hasn't spent
her life glad-handing, backstabbing
and logrolling. I say, thank God."
Kennedy's bid — and Dowd's
weak argument in favor of it — drips
with an undemocratic sense of entitle
ment and privilege rationalized by
her impressive degrees. Sure, she has
sparkling credentials, but how is
Kennedy — who has never been

elected to public office — more qual
ified to represent the 19.3 million res
idents of New York (in a time of eco
nomic calamity and two wars) than,
say. the hundreds of thousands of
other mild-mannered lawyers and au
thors?
Ilie Democratic tendency to focus
on educational background is no
doubt a reaction to the populist, anti
elitist rhetoric of the modern GOP
But the danger of degree worship is
that education becomes an end unto
itself and not a means to further ac
complishment.
Moreover, intellect often has little
to do with democratic leadership.The
two are not mutually exclusive —
America's founding fathers were seri
ous thinkers and scholars. But, con
trary to Dowd's comments, democra
cy is all about the messiness of elec
tions and campaigns, built on leaders
persuading the voters of their vision.
It's about serving the American peo
ple, who, for better or worse, don't
vote based on SAT scores or Stanford
diplomas.
The treatment of Sarah Palin last
year further demonstrated this up
surge in degree mania. Clearly Sarah
Palin was painfully inarticulate and
lacked the skill to be Vice President.
(Reading transcripts of her answers is
groan-inducing.) But she also en
dured a public assault on her educa
tional qualifications — a fractured
college career, her time as a beauty
queen, her backwater lifestyle. It
often seemed that she was rejected so
vehemently because she lacked the
sort of educational pedigree that

would get her wedding space on The
New York Times' "Weddings and Cel
ebrations'* page. (I can see the blurb
now: "Ms. Palin. daughter of a lowly
science teacher,attended several non
prestigious universities before gradu
ating from University of Idaho with
out honors or accolades.")
Many of her critics, however, con
veniently overlook the fact that Palin
has been successful in the arena of ac
tual democratic politics, which is more
than you can say about Caroline
Kennedy.
In the end. it's time that the Palin
crowd stop rejecting certain segments
of society based on educational back
ground. But its also time that the
Maureen Dowd crowd stop worship
ping at the alter of the educational
pedigree.
Indeed, if there is one thing that
American elites should have learned
over the past decades, it's that degrees
don't equal wisdom and leadership.
Just ask the former Bear Sterns CEO
Alan Schwartz (Duke University),
General Motors CEO Kick Wagoner
(Duke, I larvard), key architect of the
invasion of Iraq Paul Wolfowitz (Cor
nell, University of Chicago) or
George W. Bush (Yale. I larvard).
