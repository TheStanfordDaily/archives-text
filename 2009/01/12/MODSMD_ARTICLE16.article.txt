## FINAL MINUTE MELTDOWN Cardinal men fall short against Cougars, 55-54 
### DENIS GRIFFIN MANAGING EDITOR 
It wasn't at all the Pacific-10 debut that first-year basketball
coach Johnny Dawkins was looking for, but after a pair of narrow
defeats up north, the Stanford men will have to settle for a 1-3
start in conference play, and work their way up from there.
"Coach [Johnny Dawkins] says you are what you continually
do." senior Lawrence Hill told the San Francisco Chronicle.
"Right now. we're at the bottom of the Pac-10, just like the pre
season [predictions] said we would be."
The Cardinal's descent to near the bottom of the conference
standings follows back-to-back losses by just one point each on
the road, as Stanford (11-3,1-3) fell to the Huskies 84-83 on Thurs
day night before losing 55-54 on Saturday to Washington State (9-
6.1-2). Now. after a l()-game winning-streak to start the season.
Stanford finds itself tied with Oregon State at ninth in the Pac-l()
standings.
Saturday's matchup against the Cougars was a low-scoring af
fair. but Hill wouldn't even allow his team to take the credit for

their defensive efforts
on Saturday.
"WSU wasn't
shooting well," Hill
told The San Jose
Mercury News after
the game. "It wasn't
because of our de
fense."
Indeed. Washing
tun State, amazingly,
managed to win de
spite a team field-goal
percentage that was
even worse than the
Cardinal's — 34.8
percent compared to
37 percent for Stan
ford. In the first half,
the Cougars went just
4-for-20 shooting
from the field and
trailed the Cardinal

GAME NOTES; The Stanford men fell by a single
point for the second time in three days, as the
Cougars' Taylor Rochestie one-upped the Car
dinal with 1 7 seconds remaining. Senior for
ward Lawrence Hill led Stanford with 15 points
and eight rebounds on the night, while senior
guard Anthony Goods also added 15 points
but saw his last-second shot from 30 feet out
fall short as time expired.

30-22 at halftime. But with the game on the line in the second pe
riod. Washington State's shooting average rose to 46.2 percent.
The Cougars scored 33 points after the break, led by guard Taylor
Rochestie. who recorded 16 of his 21 total points in the second
half.
Most importantly, though, it was Rochestie who scored the
winning points for the Cougars with just 17.4 seconds remaining,
pulling up for a jumper from eight feet out to put WSU on top for
good. Rochestie scored the only points for either team in the
game's final two minutes of play on that bucket. Senior guard An
thony Goods' lavup with six seconds left was blocked bv DeAn
gelo Casto, sealing Stanford's fate.
Dawkins still hopes that his team can grow into the kind of
squad that can regularly take over games late, but Thursday and
Saturday showed that the Stanford men aren't there yet.
"We were in position to make game-winning plays at the end
both games." Dawkins told The Chronicle, "and that comes with
experience."
Guard Klay Thompson scored 13 points on the night for the
Cougars, pairing with Rochestie as WSU's only two players to
reach double-figures. Meanwhile, the Cardinal was led offen
sively by Goods and Hill, who each scored 15 points on the
night. Hill also pulled down eight boards to aid the Stanford
cause. Notably absent from the Cardinal's starting lineup for
the first time this season was sophomore forward Josh Owens,

who was replaced in the lineup by sophomore Will Paul.
Dawkins stressed that the lineup change was not disciplinary in
nature.
"It was a coach's decision," he told The Mercury News. "Will
deserved a shot."
Paul played 22 minutes and scored three points on the night.
Owens logged 15 minutes in the second half, including a devastat
ing stretch with under two minutes remaining, in which he missed
three shots in quick succession, each of which could have put the
Cardinal up by three and kept the game out of reach for Washing
ton State.

Stanford will have a longer than usual break to think about

the heartbreaking losses,as the Cardinal will not play a game on
Thursday before hosting archrival California. The Bears, under
former Cardinal coach Mike Montgomery,are currently leading
the Pac-10 with a 4-0 conference record and are 15-2 on the sea
son. Following their matchup with Cal, the Stanford men will
play at home against Oregon and Oregon State and on the road
at USC and UCLA before the end of the month in a stretch of
Pac-10 play that could either sink or save their postseason
hopes. Tip off against Cal is scheduled for 5 p.m. Saturday at
Maples Pavilion.
