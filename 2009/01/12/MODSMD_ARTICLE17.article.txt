Harbaugh reportedly testing NFL waters
After agreeing to a three-year extension to his
contract with Stanford, reports surfaced late last
week that Cardinal football coach Jim Harbaugh has
interviewed for the vacant head coaching position
with the New York Jets.
Michael Lombardi, a former Raiders executive
and cofounder of NationalFootballPost.com wrote
Friday that "[Thursday], after meeting with Cardi
nals assistant head coach Russ Grimm in Phoenix,
[the Jets] met with Stanford coach Jim Harbaugh,"
under the "Five Things I Know" heading of his col
umn. Lombardi's partner in founding the website
was Jack Bechta, 112 larbaugh's agent.
The extension with Stanford would keep Har
baugh under contract for the next six years at an av
erage salary of approximately $1.2 million per year.
But it is. as yet. unsigned, and with recruits making
campus visits, rumors of the coach's possible depar
ture could become an issue for a program that seems
to be on the rise.

Both Stanford Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby
and Bechta indicated to various media outlets, how
ever, that the extension was very close to being final
ized.
