# Patience a virtue in the NFL
## 
### 
We're now two weeks into the
NFL's annual rite of awe
someness known as the
playoffs and I think it's safe to say
that no one has any clue what's hap
pening anymore. I should know. I'm
someone, and I have no clue. I'll ex
trapolate that to include everyone
else because it makes for a better way
to start a story.
Anyway, we all thought we knew
what was happening when these
playoffs started. This was the year
when the divisional format of the
league was robbing the fans of the
show that should have rightfully
been theirs to behold. The Cardinals,
playing in the worst division in foot
ball. nay in all of sports, had stolen a
spot from the more deserving Cow
boys. Or maybe it was the Bears. Or
maybe it was the Patriots over in the
other conference, except that in their
case everyone said it was the Charg
ers doing the stealing. No matter
we were robbed!
But then a funny thing happened:
the Chargers, the Cardinals, Balti
more. and Philadelphia — unherald
ed teams that snuck into the postsea
son because they played in a weak di
vision or managed to barely edge out
the aforementioned high-profile
teams for a wild card spot — they
started to play like contenders. San
Diego thumped the media-darling
Colts and Peyton Manning in the
playoffs' opening round while Balti
more beat Miami, the team that kept
New England out of the playoffs, be
fore moving on to edge out the top
seeded Titans.
In the NFC, the shockwaves pro
duced by the Cardinals were even
harder to miss. Beating the Falcons
and rookie OB Matt Ryan was one
thing, but taking that show on the
road to absolutely crush the Panthers
without their best player in the line
up? That was nothing short of aston
ishing.
It seems that in 2008-09, the foot
ball gods have decided to turn the
world upside-down for all of us. Need
proof? Your Super Bowl winning
quarterback in 2009 could be Kurt
Warner (a veteran long thought to be
washed up). Joe Flacco (a rookie
from Delaware, of all places) or
Donovan McNabb (who was
benched in favor of Kevin Kolb just a
few short weeks ago). Not exactly a
rundown of your typical All-Pros at
the position, is it?
Of course, by now you may realize
what I've been leaving out up until
now — there's one team that we all
expected to be there in mid-January
that still is. One quarterback, coach
and team that could be Super Bowl
bound that would've surprised no
one at all at the start of the season.
Yes, the Pittsburgh Steelers are back
where they've always been, right in
the thick of the championship hunt.
It seems so easy from the outside
looking in: hire a tough, defensive
minded head coach; find a steady
stream of strong, physical defenders
who can rush the passer and stuff the
run; build a culture of hard-nosed de
termination: repeat. But you know
what it really takes to build a team
that's as consistently good, like the
Steelers? Patience.
The Steelers didn't hire head
coach Mike Tomlin following the
2006 season so that he could win
them the Super Bowl in 2007, despite
the fact that they had a team capable
of going far into the postseason
they hired him because they thought
that he was the right person to lead
the team in the long run, present be
damned. So what if his rookie inex
perience cost them a few games?
Years later, they'd be glad they tried
to hire their guy too early, rather than
too late.
It's an attitude that goes beyond
the Tomlin hire, though. Do you
know how many years Bill Cowher
coached the Steelers before winning
his first (and only) Super Bowl with
the team? 13. And that included six
consecutive trips to the postseason
to start his career followed by a three
year playoff drought from '98-'OO.
If Cowher had been the coach of
a franchise like Dallas, or New York
(take your pick. Giants or Jets), he
wouldn't have survived all six of
those first years because he clearly
