# Reacting to Gaza
## Student groups concerned with the violence, take action 
### NIKHIL JOSHI MATT SERNA 
At a protest on Friday, students
supporting both Palestine and Israel
filled White Plaza with signs crying,
"The Real Terrorists U.S.-Israel" and
"Ceasefire Now." as well as numerous
Israeli tlags. Evident that day and
many others recently, campus groups
on both sides have been galvanized by
Israel's recent campaign in Gaza and
are quickly taking action.
Though the Stanford Jewish com
munity shares the global community's
regret for civilian casualties, many feel
that Israel's actions are justified as self
defense. Justin I lefterT 1 .vice president
of the Stanford Israel Alliance (SIA).
shares this view.
"It's terrible when there's a war for
any reason, and it's also terrible that
innocent civilians are dying, which is
hard to deal with for anybody who
cares about human life." Hefter said.
"The thing is. Israel has been pushed

into the situation after enduring eight
years of rocket fire, and anyone who
values human life and dignity under
stands that. No country should have to
endure something like that."
SI A President Lexi Shechtel iOsees
the recent conflict as a necessary last
resort to dealing with Hamas attacks.
"I wish there was a diplomatic
solution, but Hamas's charter is sworn
to the destruction of Israel," she said.
"It's impossible to negotiate when you
have nothing to offer but your own
destruction."
Nada Ramadan '10. president of
the Muslim Students Awareness
Network (MSAN), is very disturbed
by the events in Gaza.
"Right now. I support the
Palestinian people." she said."l am just
worried about the human rights of
every civilian. Almost half of the
Palestinians who have died are women
and children who have no responsibil
ity in the actions of Hamas."
Fadi Quran "10, president of

Students Confronting Apartheid by
Israel (SCAI). was home in the West
Bank when the fighting began.
"I saw a lot of things unfold, and
the saddest of them all was how peo
ple were being treated in Gaza,"
Quran said. "I have friends and fami
lies that work for the NGOs. and
none of them were getting in. Foreign
journalists were not allowed into
Gaza, but Palestinian journalists were
taking footage of the action. The bru
tality of it made me very sad and
afraid for the people in Gaza."
Taking Action
Humanitarian efforts, though sup
ported by both camps, are coming
along slowly due to difficulties in
delivering aid to Gaza.
"We know that even organizations
like the Red Cross are having trouble
delivering resources to the
Palestinians." Ramadan said. "Our
