# Reacting to Gaza
## Student groups concerned with the violence, take action 
### NIKHIL JOSHI MATT SERNA 
At a protest on Friday, students
supporting both Palestine and Israel
filled White Plaza with signs crying,
"The Real Terrorists U.S.-Israel" and
"Ceasefire Now." as well as numerous
Israeli tlags. Evident that day and
many others recently, campus groups
on both sides have been galvanized by
Israel's recent campaign in Gaza and
are quickly taking action.
Though the Stanford Jewish com
munity shares the global community's
regret for civilian casualties, many feel
that Israel's actions are justified as self
defense. Justin I lefterT 1 .vice president
of the Stanford Israel Alliance (SIA).
shares this view.
"It's terrible when there's a war for
any reason, and it's also terrible that
innocent civilians are dying, which is
hard to deal with for anybody who
cares about human life." Hefter said.
"The thing is. Israel has been pushed

into the situation after enduring eight
years of rocket fire, and anyone who
values human life and dignity under
stands that. No country should have to
endure something like that."
SI A President Lexi Shechtel iOsees
the recent conflict as a necessary last
resort to dealing with Hamas attacks.
"I wish there was a diplomatic
solution, but Hamas's charter is sworn
to the destruction of Israel," she said.
"It's impossible to negotiate when you
have nothing to offer but your own
destruction."
Nada Ramadan '10. president of
the Muslim Students Awareness
Network (MSAN), is very disturbed
by the events in Gaza.
"Right now. I support the
Palestinian people." she said."l am just
worried about the human rights of
every civilian. Almost half of the
Palestinians who have died are women
and children who have no responsibil
ity in the actions of Hamas."
Fadi Quran "10, president of

Students Confronting Apartheid by
Israel (SCAI). was home in the West
Bank when the fighting began.
"I saw a lot of things unfold, and
the saddest of them all was how peo
ple were being treated in Gaza,"
Quran said. "I have friends and fami
lies that work for the NGOs. and
none of them were getting in. Foreign
journalists were not allowed into
Gaza, but Palestinian journalists were
taking footage of the action. The bru
tality of it made me very sad and
afraid for the people in Gaza."
Taking Action
Humanitarian efforts, though sup
ported by both camps, are coming
along slowly due to difficulties in
delivering aid to Gaza.
"We know that even organizations
like the Red Cross are having trouble
delivering resources to the
Palestinians." Ramadan said. "Our

of Stanford Israel Alliance (SIA) also attended the protest, handing out information pamphlets on the Israeli cause.
Palestinians," Ramadan said. "Our ulti
mate goal would be to try to meet those
basic needs."
According to Hefter, SIA is work
ing with MSAN and the Coalition for
Justice in the Middle East (CJME) on a
charity drive.
Educating the community is also a
priority of both sides. And due to what
many are saying is a lack of media cov
erage. campus pro-Palestine groups
consider outreach very important.
"Since not a lot of journalists have
gotten in to Gaza, it should be our duty
to educate people," Quran said. "I
believe people on campus are under
informed."
Quran said he was concerned that
students aren't getting the whole story.
"Especially since there are no jour
nalists in Gaza, and the media here in
the U.S. believes that Israeli sources are
more reliable, they propagate more of
the Israeli propaganda machine." he
claimed.
Quran was most supportive of an
unorthodox news source â€” Comedy
Central TV host John Stewart, who has
come out strongly against Israel's
actions in Gaza.
Stanford's pro-Israeli community is

also seeking to educate.
"We want people to know how to
deal with situations where they hear
hateful or untrue things about Israel."
Hefter said. "Our goal is to get people
to leave Stanford with a more nuanced
understanding of the Middle East, and
educate people about Israel's contribu
tions to global society as a whole."
Several film screenings are also
being planned by campus groups.
Stanford Says No to War plans to host
a film screening and discussion of the
documentary "Death in Gaza."
Students for an Open Society
(SOS), a Stanford student organization
dedicated to educating the Stanford
community on oppressive Middle East
political movements, is organizing a
joint movie screening with MSAN of
"Islam vs. Islamists," a documentary
that deals with how moderate Muslims
are persecuted by Islamic extremists in
the Middle East.
"Our main focus is to spread aware
ness about radical Islam and how fail
ure to recognize the danger of radical
Islam impairs the safety of all open
societies," said Jonathan Gelbart '11,
president of SOS.
There are other ways campus
groups hope to make an impact. SCAI
is currently seeking divestment from
companies that are manufacturing the
weapons used by Israel in Gaza.
"Most of the weapons that have
been used are weapons that have been

given to Israel from the U. 5.," Quran
said. "We need to let people know
about that, and most importantly we
need to continue with our effort to
comply with what it is on paper [in
regards to investment responsibility]."
Frayed Relations
Relations between pro-Israel and
pro-Palestine groups on campus are
seriously frayed, and the recent events
in Gaza haven't helped, but members
of both groups insist that personal
relations between students remain
intact.
On Friday, SCAI organized a
protest against Israeli actions in the
Gaza region, while SIA members
arrived to hand out pro-Israel informa
tion sheets to onlookers during the
event.
"SIA has said it does not want to
associate with SCAI," Quran said. "On
an organizational basis, we haven't spo
ken that much, but on a personal basis,
we have spoken. We are friends."
Hefter asserts that the SCIA "pro
motes inflammatory rhetoric," and that
the SIA "[doesn't] want to associate
themselves with a group like that."
"If they softened their rhetoric and
behaved more amicably toward other
student groups, it would be easier to
work with them," Hefter added. "But
by nature, our goals conflict."
SCAI has partnered with one
Jewish organization in the past.

"We have interacted with the Jewish
Coalition for Human Rights, and we
meet with them sometimes and we dis
cuss some issues, and we plan events,"
Quran said. "Last year, we planned a
whole series of events about a Jewish
woman who was protesting what Israel
was doing."
SIA is partnering with two Muslim
groups. MSAN and CJME, for the
charity drive.
Though members of the Stanford
Arab and Jewish communities disagree
on a number of issues, their interactions
have remained civil throughout the cri
sis.
"We're trying to work with the
Muslim groups because we're all stu
dents. we're all rational people and we

shouldn't lei this come between us as
human beings and as individuals,"
Hefter said.
Looking to the Future
With all the attention surrounding
Gaza and the incoming Obama admin
istration, student leaders from both the
pro-Israel and pro-Palestine sides said
they expect that the situation could
soon improve.
"America unrelentingly supports
Israel and doesn't question the reasons
it does," Ramadan said. "Hopefully the
new Obama administration can bring
some change in its policy toward
Israel."
"I think the Obama administration
is going to push really hard for a cease

fire," Hefter said, "and I think that
would provide the U.S. a lot of positive
opportunities to broker a ceasefire."
Mostly, students are eager to see
how the situation will evolve once
Obama takes office.
"I'm apprehensive to see what the
new administration's policy would lie."
Shechtel said. "1 would love if there
were negotiations with Palestinian
leadership and a viable two-state solu
tion was proposed. I don't know how
likely that is when the negotiating part
ner is Mamas, but I'm eager to see what
Obama does."
