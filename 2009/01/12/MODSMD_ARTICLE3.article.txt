# Word for word, but not just an imitation
## Lively Arts brings company back for stories by Wolff

I read three of Tobias Wolffs short stories in
PWR2: "Sanity," "Down to the Bone" and
"Firelight."There, debates raged over
details, characters and interpreta-
However. Word
for Word Performing Arts
Company's take on the
very same stories in
Saturday's Lively Arts W
event "More Stories Irom Tobias
Wolff" left no room for excessive
thought. Instead, the series of short plays packed a
solid punch, leaving the audience a little too breath
less to think.
FOunded in IW3 by Susan Harloe and JoAnne
Winter. Word for Word Performing Arts Company
stages short stories, performing every word the
author has written, even the"he said" and "she said"
often attached to dialogue. By splitting up prose nar
ration between characters. Word for Word bridges
the gap between prose and play, imbuing the original
text with new interpretations and meanings. They
did just that in last weekend's performance — the
company's second Lively Arts show of the year.
For me, the transition from written word to per
formed word was startling, even a little uncomfort
able at first. After all. as a reader, you're at liberty to
select whatever reality you want to believe in. You
have fixed images of the characters in your mind, of
what they look and sound like. You can downplay
the significance ol those that annoy you. pay atten
tion to the ones you like, attach moods to turns of
phrase or even to the whole story — melancholy,
nostalgic, humourous.
The trick with Word for Word, however, is to real
ize that they stage a completely different genre. As
Wolff himself mentioned in the post-performance
discussion, what Word for Word stages isn't what
goes on in the theater of his imagination. Instead, it
is "something new, something remade." 1 folding on
too tightly to the prose version defeats Word tor
Word's purpose.
The acting was strong, evident in the way the
actors switched roles effectively and with ease —
five played at least three roles each. A standout was
Jeri I ynn Cohen, who executed a precise Mother in
"Firelight." Cohen delivered lines with an emotional
ambiguity that is hard to achieve, straddling dual,
even opposing emotions with a single tone ol voice.
The show's lighting was also masterful, setting
much of the contrasting mood in "Down to the
Bone" with alternate uses of flood and backlights.
The stark wash used in much of "Sanity" also stood
out; it created a surreal artificiality that juxtaposed
well against the tension between characters Claire
and April.
I only found one thing awkward: Word for Word
reading the text ascomedic when I preferred it to he
poignant. While the humor was surprising and, in
places, certainly effective, it was sometimes over
bearing. The strength of the three stories' plots and
language lies in their potential to
convey an electrifying, uncanny sad
ness. This sadness was overshadowed
on occasion, which lessened the drive
and eventual impact of the perform
ance.
Still. I remain a big fan of Word
for Word. ITieir innovation — and
the quality of their innovation —
was an enormous factor in creating a
wonderful evening show.
