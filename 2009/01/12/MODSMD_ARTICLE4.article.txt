With unemployment looming at 7.2 percent.
President-elect Barack Obama took strides last week to
ensure the passage of his economic stimulus package
before the Feb. 13 congressional recess. The President
elect recently added a proposal for $300 billion in tax
cuts to his recovery plan.
But Stanford economics professors John Taylor and
John Shoven have questioned the wisdom of some
details of Obama's economic plans.
Although aspects of the proposal are still under
development, the tax cuts are projected to include tax
credits for middle- and lower-income workers, tax cred
its for businesses hiring new employees and more imme
diate write-offs for businesses.
The centerpiece of the proposal is the tax relief provi
sion for individuals, which appears to be a preliminary
step toward enacting the "Making Work Pay" plan cham
pioned by Obama during his presidential campaign. In
effect, the tax cuts give credits of $500 to individuals and

$1,000 to family house
holds.

business side of the plan

companies can receive write-offs for losses sustained in
2008 and 2009 during the current tax season, thereby
providing them with quicker access to cash. Businesses
can also earn one-year tax credits for hiring new work
ers. Coupled with government spending on infrastruc
ture investment, the $300 billion lax cuts could place the
price tag of Obama's stimulus package at $775 billion
over the next two years, according to business media
reports.
As consumers look to the government for assistance
in anticipation of a worsening recession, the feasibility of
the President-elect's tax cuts has come under question in
academic circles.
Taylor, the Mary and Robert Raymond professor of
economics, has been a long-time skeptic of discretionary
fiscal policy, as exemplified by Obama's tax cut proposal.
Citing the temporary tax rebates of 2001 and 2008 as
examples of unsuccessful government efforts to stimu
late the economy. Taylor believes the proposed tax cuts
are not the best approach for reviving an ailing economy.
