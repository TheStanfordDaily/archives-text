## POLITICS Economics Profs. John Taylor and John Shoven are critical of Obama's tax plan

With unemployment looming at 7.2 percent.
President-elect Barack Obama took strides last week to
ensure the passage of his economic stimulus package
before the Feb. 13 congressional recess. The President
elect recently added a proposal for $300 billion in tax
cuts to his recovery plan.
But Stanford economics professors John Taylor and
John Shoven have questioned the wisdom of some
details of Obama's economic plans.
Although aspects of the proposal are still under
development, the tax cuts are projected to include tax
credits for middle- and lower-income workers, tax cred
its for businesses hiring new employees and more imme
diate write-offs for businesses.
The centerpiece of the proposal is the tax relief provi
sion for individuals, which appears to be a preliminary
step toward enacting the "Making Work Pay" plan cham
pioned by Obama during his presidential campaign. In
effect, the tax cuts give credits of $500 to individuals and

$1,000 to family house
holds.

business side of the plan

companies can receive write-offs for losses sustained in
2008 and 2009 during the current tax season, thereby
providing them with quicker access to cash. Businesses
can also earn one-year tax credits for hiring new work
ers. Coupled with government spending on infrastruc
ture investment, the $300 billion lax cuts could place the
price tag of Obama's stimulus package at $775 billion
over the next two years, according to business media
reports.
As consumers look to the government for assistance
in anticipation of a worsening recession, the feasibility of
the President-elect's tax cuts has come under question in
academic circles.
Taylor, the Mary and Robert Raymond professor of
economics, has been a long-time skeptic of discretionary
fiscal policy, as exemplified by Obama's tax cut proposal.
Citing the temporary tax rebates of 2001 and 2008 as
examples of unsuccessful government efforts to stimu
late the economy. Taylor believes the proposed tax cuts
are not the best approach for reviving an ailing economy.
"To the extent that they're one
time payments, they're not going to
do much good," Taylor said. "The
evidence comes from the package
last summer when rebate checks
were sent to individuals, and they
just put it away."
Of particular concern to Taylor
is the temporary nature of the tax
cuts. According to him. the
Economic Stimulus Act of 2008
foundered because temporary
increases in income do not cause
substantial increases in consump
tion. After the government issued
Si 15 billion worth of rebates,
Americans simply saved the
money or paid off their debts —
few opted to spend the money. As a
result, the rebates did little to
encourage consumption, increase
aggregate demand or galvanize the
economy.
Although the spending and tax
cut package works as a compromise
to appease both Democrats and
Republicans.Taylor concludes that it
is "not beneficial to the purpose,
which is to get the economy moving."
Instead. Taylor advocates a
recovery plan that is permanent,
pervasive and predictable. Among
his suggestions is a permanent

worker's tax credit amounting to 6.2
percent of wages up to $8,000. With
the assurance of a long-term credit,
Taylor argues, Americans will be
more likely to pour money into the
economy again.
"The first thing is to find out
what we need long-term and don't
think of it as a stimulus package,"
Taylor said. "The best thing for
[Obama] to do is to propose some
thing that will work and to get as
many people to support it as possi
ble."
Shoven, the Charles Schwab pro
fessor of economics, similarly
believes that Obama's proposal is
not structured as well as it could be
to stimulate the economy.
"Certainly anybody that's
sophisticated doesn't necessarily
feel better off when the government
is borrowing money to give you
money," Shoven said of tax cuts to
individuals. "As taxpayers, you're
going to have to repay that loan."
As an alternative. Shoven is par
tial to the idea of instituting a 10
percent investment tax credit.
"Let's say that the federal gov
ernment said, for the next IS
months, businesses which make new
investments can get a 10 percent
investment tax credit, over and
above the depreciation that'd they
normally get." Shoven suggested.
"What that would do is basically put
all investments on sale in the United
States. Government would basically

pay 10 percent of the costs.
[Americans] will re-time their
investments — their purchases of
trucks, their purchases of buses,
their purchases of computers and so
forth —in order to get the 10 per
cent off sale."
According to Shoven. the busi
ness tax cut is inefficient because it
fails to directly stimulate demand.
"It doesn't directly cause firms to
go out and buy something" he
emphasized, "so that's why I say an
investment tax credit would be a
good deal."
While both Shoven and Taylor
doubted the success of the tax cuts,
they provided differing opinions
when it came to Obama's plan to
increase government spending on
infrastructure.
"In terms of the spending side of
it. that sounds more long-term and
permanent." Taylor said, "but there
is little evidence that it will help."
He pointed out that President
Eisenhower's decision to build the
Interstate Highway System in the
1950s did little to shorten the reces
sion.
In contrast. Shoven found some
potential in the spending side of
Obama's stimulus package.
"It's clear that there are plenty of
infrastructure projects that are valu
able. that would create jobs, that
would create demand." Shoven said.
He was quick to note, however,
that the spending side of the recov

ery plan is complicated.
"You've got to plan and be care
ful on how you spend." Shoven said.
"The only problem with the infra
structure [approach] is that the
relief doesn't quite get there as fast
as you would like in a recession."
But with circumstances expected
to get worse before they can get bet
ter. Americans are looking for a
rapid recovery. Shoven predicts that
the economy will continue to weak
en for the next six months, with
employment climbing beyond eight
percent. However, according to
Shoven. the silver lining to this
financial crisis might be the
President-elect's leadership.
"A recession like this is quite
largely a psychological problem,"
Shoven said. "1 think it's good that
Obama is on the case."
He anticipates that the positive
effects of stimulus actions undertak
en by Obama. the Federal Reserve
and the Treasury will emerge this
coming fall.
"1 would think that the positive
impact of those things will begin to
be felt roughly in nine months,"
Shoven said. "TTiis is a recession, but
it's not going to last forever. 2010
could be a year of an improving
economy, and 2011 might be the
year when we really say.'Times are
good again."'
