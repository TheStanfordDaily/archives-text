## Wellness Room in the works Located in Old Union, room to be for relaxation, mental health resources 
### JULIA BROWNELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Wellness Room, an ASSU-sponsored project on
the second floor of Old Union, is slated to open at the
end of the month as part of a campus initiative to com
bat the reported mental health stigma.
With relaxing activities like Sudoku. silly putty and
hula hoops — as well as comfortable chairs and bean
bags — the Wellness Room will provide a calm, encour
aging atmosphere, as ASSU Mental Health Chair
Angelina Cardona "11 described.
"Imagine Jack Johnson-stvle music, a good aroma and
positive decorations on the walls." she said. "[The room]
will be a very relaxing, chill place."
In addition to everyday activities,
however, the Wellness Room will
also hold larger events, such as yoga,
meditation and massage therapy
sessions, according to Cardona.
Yet with all this programming, it
is still uncertain how many students
will ultimately take advantage of the
room.
"We're optimistic," Cardona said.
"Our main target is the middle
ground people," added Marcus
Jamison, executive fellow to the
ASSU chair of Mental 1 lealth."['l"he
room] is for the common, day-to-day
stresses."
Cardona and Jamison are work
ing on opening-day events and a
marketing campaign to increase
awareness of the room.
"1 would use it." said Sheldon
Chang '12. "I'm interested in medi
tation. and it would be nice to have
something that's easily accessible."
Others said they aren't sure.
"1 might or might not use it," said
Sarah Loomis "12. "I have other
ways to relax."
Students will be able to use the
room when it opens in late January
or early February. By then, the
search for the Wellness Room coor
dinator will be completed, and the
new hire will have a chance to begin
a concrete plan for managing the
room.
Among those tasks is the organi
zation of student volunteers who
will be the room's primary staffers.
Volunteers will be available when
ever the room is open and will be a
cornerstone of the room's effective
ness.
"[The volunteers' role] will be to
be a good source of information
about and referral to campus
resources, and to talk with their
peers about well being," said
Christine Griffith, associate vice
provost in the Office of the Vice
Provost for Student Affairs.
"Students helping students and
learning from each other is a critical
part of this initiative."
In addition to student volunteers,
the room will have available
brochures and further information
on campus mental health resources.
While the Wellness Room might
draw parallels to the Sexual Health
Peer Resource Center at Vaden.

Cardona emphasized that the Old
Union location is not just a resource
center.
"We don't want it to be a resource
center," she said, "but we want it to
be a portal."
As such. Griffith explained how
the room will work in conjunction
with other resources already avail
able on campus.
"The idea was developed to com
plement existing resources, not to
replace them," the associate vice
provost said. "I believe the most
effective outreach occurs when you
take the resources and information
to students —to the places where
they live and where they gather to
study, meet and socialize."
Cardona believes the room will
also increase visibility for mental
health issues on campus, as well as
provide a place to deal with those
issues.
"Our goal is making [mental
health issues] more visible, making
them more talked about," she said.
"People feel a pressure to fit a mold
of a perfect Stanford student, and
there needs to be recognition of the
fact that we're all human."
