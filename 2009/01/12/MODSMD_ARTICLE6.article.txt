GIULIO GRATTA/The Stanford Daily
Rosalyn Gold-Onwude and the Cardinal women demolished Washington State on Saturday to push their
conference record to 4-0 on the season. Next up is archrival Cal on Saturday.
Washington State, though, was not
without its chances. Stanford and WSU
had an equal number of scoring oppor
tunities in the first half, hut by the break,
the Cardinal led 45-20. Part of the dis
parity can be attributed again to the
Cardinal defense; the Cougars were
held to eight of 33 field-goal attempts in
the opening half, and ultimately shot
only 37 percent from the field.The Car
dinal also snagged 26 defensive boards,
limiting the number of second chances
for WSU.
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer
was happy with her team's effort, espe
cially on defense.
"I was really pleased with how peo
ple came out.and how people finished."
she said."Jayne [ AppelJ and Jeanette
[Pohlen] really showed how to do
things, and the defense came out ag
gressive. which helped us out."
Stanford's defensive effort allowed
their conference-leading offense to do
what it does best: put on a show.
With nine minutes remaining in the
first half,junior Rosalyn Gold-Onwude
took a rebound away from several leap
ing Cougars and made a court-length
pass to Appel, who plucked the arcing
ball out of the air and made a smooth
lay-up.The crowd went wild as the Car
dinal took a 26-13 lead. Gold-Onwude
finished with five steals and a game
leading six assists, just one fewer than
Washington State's total as a team.
VanDerveer praised Gold-On
wude's play on Saturday, especially her
passing.
"I was pleased with how Rosalyn got
the ball to Jayne," VanDerveer said.
"She's taken huge steps forward at
guard."
The Cardinal — which leads the
Pac-10 in scoring at 78.1 points per
game and is the only team in the confer
ence with over I,(HH) total points —
reached Iriple-digits for the second
game in a row and for the third time this

season.This offensive dominance didn't
go unnoticed by the Cougars' bench.
"|Stanford| was as good as adver
tised." said Washington State head
coach June Daugherty after the game.
"They showed us the reason why they
were in the national championship
game last year, and obviously it was a
difficult game for us. We lost our poise a
bit. but this was a good team to learn
against. We have to stop making excus
es and learn."
Daugherty also noted that her team
was weak against the Cardinal's aggres
sive man-to-man defense.
Stanford's offensive explosion, as in
the game before it,allowed VanDerveer
to make a lot of early substitutions and
give inexperienced members of the
Cardinal valuable playing time.
A total of six non-starters played for
the Cardinal, four of whom were in for
more than 17 minutes. One of them,
sophomore Michelle Harrison, had 12
points in the second half to finish with
16.
VanDerveer appreciated the oppor
tunity.
"It's good for team morale," she said,
"it's good for confidence in young play
ers, and it's good to rest players a bit."
"It was a blast to see everyone get
play," added Appel. who was benched
more than usual to let her teammates
get on the court. "This is what we work
so hard in practice for."
Stanford's next game is at California
(12-2,3-0) on Sunday. As of Jan. 11. the
Golden Bears share a spot with Stan
ford and USC atop the Pac-10. Appel is
looking forward to the game, but knows
it will be tough.
" ITiey've had some good games in
the past, and we're both on a bit of a roll
right now," she said. "They'll be coming
out ready for us."
