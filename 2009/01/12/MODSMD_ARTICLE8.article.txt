## Bush, Obama near agreement on requesting other $350 billion Further stimulus on tap 
### ANDREW TAYLOR PHILIP ELLIOTT THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON â€” Senate Democ
ratic leaders said a vote could come
as early as this week on providing a
second $350 billion for the financial
industry, after assurances Sunday by
President-elect Barack Obama and
one of his top economic advisers that
the money would be better moni
tored and spent.
The Bush administration and the
incoming Obama team have under
taken a tag-team effort to obtain the
money from reluctant lawmakers, to
have it waiting for Obama when he's
sworn in Jan. 20.
President George W. Bush would
request the additional money for the
Troubled Asset Relief Program, or
TARP. but the incoming administra
tion would allocate it. Obama's eco
nomic adviser. Larry Summers,
briefed lawmakers Sunday on the
bailout and on the incoming admin
istration's plan for roughly $800 bil
lion in spending and tax breaks to
spur the economy.
Senate Banking Committee
Chairman Christopher Dodd. D-
Conn., said Sunday that lawmakers
were assured there would be fuller
accounting of the money spent on
the bailout. Banks and other finan
cial institutions have received bil
lions from the government with few
rules, and most won't say where the
money has gone.
Obama. in a taped interview aired
Sunday on ABC's "This Week,"
promised to see that more money
goes directly to distressed homeown
ers. "When you look at how we have
handled the home foreclosure situa
tion and whether we've done enough
in terms of helping families ... we
haven't done enouah." he said.

"Larry Summers made a very
strong argument tor why it's impor
tant and critical for the overall recov
ery," said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.
"And I think that's an argument that
most senators understand."
Summers sought to win over Sen
ate Democrats even as the GOP
leader of the House John Boehnerof
Ohio, warned that any effort to re
lease the additional money would
"be a pretty tough sell." Boehner ap
peared on CBS' "Face The Nation."
A formal request to spend the
second half of the $700 billion
bailout would force a vote within
days on whether to block the fund
ing. but the deck is stacked in favor
release of the money. Congress can
pass a resolution disapproving the

request, but the White House could
veto the resolution: then, just one
third of either chamber would be
needed to uphold the veto and win
release of the money.
Senate leaders would prefer to
win a majority vote. Dodd said.
The idea is to make the money
available to the new administration
shortly after Obama takes office Jan.
20. The unpopular bailout has fea
tured unconditional infusions of
money into financial institutions that
have done little to reveal what
they've done with it.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paul
son originally promised the money
would be used to buy up mortgage
related securities whose falling val
ues have clogged up credit markets

and brought many financial institu
tions to the brink of failure.
Senate Majority Leader Harry
Reid indicated Sunday that Bush and
Obama officials are near agreement
on submitting notice to Congress
about using the remaining $350 billion.
"We're waiting to hear from Pres
ident Bush and or President-elect
Obama as to what, if anything,
they're going to do," said Reid, D-
Nev., "and that's occurring as we
speak."
