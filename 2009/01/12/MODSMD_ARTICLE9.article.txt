## Winter housing crunch worse than usual 
### THOMAS YEH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
All undergraduate students who
were guaranteed housing this winter
have been accommodated, fulfilling the
Housing Assignment Office's promise
of providing for all guaranteed students
by the end of the quarter's first week.
But for some students returning
from abroad, the first week back on
campus was a bit rough.
Andrea Cantu '10, returning from a
quarter in Australia, lived out of her
suitcase all of last week, with boxes of
her possessions left unpacked in a
friend's dorm room.
"I've been staying on the floors of
my friends' rcxmis and mcx)ching off
their meal plans," Cantu said. "It's kind

of ridiculous to have to find your own
accommodations for the first week of
school. I can't get to my towel without
inconveniencing everyone."
Like Cantu, a number of students
coming back from abroad experienced
some difficulty getting assigned to
housing this winter quarter, according
to Student 1 lousing.
Due to the combination of this
year's large freshman class and a small
er number of students taking leaves of
absence during this particular winter,
the number of students requiring hous
ing this quarter went up significantly
compared to previous years. A total of
360 returning students applied for
housing â€” approximately one hundred
more spaces to till than last year, said
Rodger Whitney, executive director of

Student Housing.
Winter quarter has always been a
difficult one for housing.but renovation
plans this year have made the winter
housing crunch more severe than in
previous years.
"In the past, we have used Crothers
I lall for overflow space for undergrad
uate students in winter quarter,"
Whitney explained. "This year,
Crothers and Crothers Memorial are
offline to renovate these buildings."
Despite the re-opening of Xanadu,
rooms for returning students were still
scarce.
"Most of the [Xanadu] spaces were
filled by students living in Crothers dur
ing autumn quarter," said Marie
Oamek, manager of Information and
Assessment for Stanford Housing. "In

order to meet demand for autumn
quarter, we created a Crothers autumn
quarter and Xanadu winter and spring
quarters combination. There were
[only) a few spaces offered in Xanadu
to returning students."
TTie overflow was resolved with off
campus and graduate housing, an alter
native that Student I lousing began to
push early on but did not mandate.
Students who were willing to opt for
such arrangements were assured a
chance to move back into undergradu
ate housing in the spring.
"We leased 30 apartments at Oak
Creek for sixty students and placed
forty students in Escondido Village,"
Whitney said. "Students in these areas
