# HOUSING
## Winter housing crunch worse than usual 
### THOMAS YEH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
All undergraduate students who
were guaranteed housing this winter
have been accommodated, fulfilling the
Housing Assignment Office's promise
of providing for all guaranteed students
by the end of the quarter's first week.
But for some students returning
from abroad, the first week back on
campus was a bit rough.
Andrea Cantu '10, returning from a
quarter in Australia, lived out of her
suitcase all of last week, with boxes of
her possessions left unpacked in a
friend's dorm room.
"I've been staying on the floors of
my friends' rcxmis and mcx)ching off
their meal plans," Cantu said. "It's kind

of ridiculous to have to find your own
accommodations for the first week of
school. I can't get to my towel without
inconveniencing everyone."
Like Cantu, a number of students
coming back from abroad experienced
some difficulty getting assigned to
housing this winter quarter, according
to Student 1 lousing.
Due to the combination of this
year's large freshman class and a small
er number of students taking leaves of
absence during this particular winter,
the number of students requiring hous
ing this quarter went up significantly
compared to previous years. A total of
360 returning students applied for
housing — approximately one hundred
more spaces to till than last year, said
Rodger Whitney, executive director of

Student Housing.
Winter quarter has always been a
difficult one for housing.but renovation
plans this year have made the winter
housing crunch more severe than in
previous years.
"In the past, we have used Crothers
I lall for overflow space for undergrad
uate students in winter quarter,"
Whitney explained. "This year,
Crothers and Crothers Memorial are
offline to renovate these buildings."
Despite the re-opening of Xanadu,
rooms for returning students were still
scarce.
"Most of the [Xanadu] spaces were
filled by students living in Crothers dur
ing autumn quarter," said Marie
Oamek, manager of Information and
Assessment for Stanford Housing. "In

order to meet demand for autumn
quarter, we created a Crothers autumn
quarter and Xanadu winter and spring
quarters combination. There were
[only) a few spaces offered in Xanadu
to returning students."
TTie overflow was resolved with off
campus and graduate housing, an alter
native that Student I lousing began to
push early on but did not mandate.
Students who were willing to opt for
such arrangements were assured a
chance to move back into undergradu
ate housing in the spring.
"We leased 30 apartments at Oak
Creek for sixty students and placed
forty students in Escondido Village,"
Whitney said. "Students in these areas
w ill be given priority to return to tradi
tional undergraduate housing as vacan
cies occur."
Housing assignments for winter
quarter started early in the fall, with
students abroad being prioritized by
the numbers previously assigned to
them during the regular annual draw
held last academic year. For Robert
Pothier i() and Chris Hanson '10, who
drew into Soto together, the process
was simple enough.
"I didn't get housing the first round,"
Pothier said. "1 was put on the waiting
list, but so was most everyone I knew,
studying in Beijing. Then, we filled in
another form to have a proxy attend a
walk-in meeting for us at Stanford, and
we got our housing in that next round.
It took a lot of time, but it eventually
worked out, so it was fine."
Cantu, with a draw number in the
2 I XX)s. was not as lucky. Despite qualify
in" for "first-level status" as a student

returning from a Stanford-sponsored
program who listed her willingness to
live in any on-campus dorm, limited
spaces prevented her from being taken
off the waitlist until the first few days of
school. Even after notification of hav
ing been assigned to Mirrielees, howev
er. Cantu was told she could not move
into her new room until the end of the
week and would have to find some
where else to stay for the time being.
"Some students do not notify us
that they are not returning until after
the quarter begins," Oamek said. "In
this case, some students are not able to
move into their new assignments until
the space has been vacated and
cleaned."
Openings are being offered to stu
dents as they become available, and as
of last Thursday, most of the issues had
been resolved.
"All guaranteed students have
received housing — females were all
offered a space by [the quarter's first]
Monday, and the last of the guaranteed
males were assigned the following
Thursday," said Sue Nunan. director of
Housing Assignments. "According to
our guarantee to undergraduates, we

have until Friday of the first week of
school to place all guaranteed stu
dents"
Of course, there are still a number
of applications that are on hold. Some
latecomers without guaranteed hous
ing are still waiting for news about
whether or not there will be spaces
available for them.
Steve Henderson '11 came out of
the Harold Modular at the end of last
week shaking his head _ the last walk _
in meeting had passed without a hous
ing opening for the sophomore. Three
new openings were available at co-ops,
but he respectfully declined those, not
ing that he doesn't have time for the
chores those co-ops entail.
But Henderson wasn't worried. For
now, he is staying with an aunt in Menlo
Park, and after coming back from two
years in Cambodia, he joked that he is
already very used to encountering
issues with finding housing.
"It looks like they're working pretty
hard to get us all in if they can,"
Henderson said.
