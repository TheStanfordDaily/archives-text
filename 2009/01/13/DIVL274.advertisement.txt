There are some financial firms where technology doesn't take a
back seat. The D. E. Shaw group is a highly successful investment
and technology development firm with an international reputation
and a decidedly different approach to doing business. We offer a
stimulating work environment and colleagues from the strongest
technical programs in the world. They're not conventional
"financial types," but then again, neither are we.
The firm currently has openings in quantitative analysis, software
development, information technology, computer architecture, and
computational chemistry. Our work environment is challenging
but surprisingly flexible —from the clothes you wear to the time you
get to the office, it's pretty much up to you. And we compensate our
extraordinary people extraordinarily well.
Application deadline January 14
Computer Forum Job Fair January 14
On-campus interviews February 3
The D. E. Shaw group will attend the Computer Forum Job Fair
