## Editorial Energy initiative a bold step for Stanford 
### 
Yesterday, Stanford proved that it has
not forgotten about energy in the
midst of the worst financial crisis in
half a century. Thanks to the contributions of
several generous donors, the University
plans to launch a $100 million energy insti
tute (see "$lOO million Precourt energy in
stitute announced" in today's issue of The
Daily). The editorial board applauds such a
valuable effort.
The depletion of energy resources is one
of the most pressing challenges of our gener
ation, affecting everything from climate sta
bility to national security.The editorial board
is proud that the University is making energy
research a priority and recognizing the sever
ity of the problem. We also send our thanks
to the donors for this valuable project, in
cluding Jay Precourt '59; Thomas Steyer
MBA 83; Kat Taylor JD '85. MBA '85: Dou
glas Kimmelman '82: Michael Ruffatto '68:
and the Schmidt Family Foundation. Your
generous donations will make not only a dif
ference to our university, but also to the
world.
The Precourt Institute for Energy will
forge ahead with alternative energy re
search at a time when such initiatives could
easily be pushed aside as the country focus
es on more immediate financial challenges.
We are pleased that the institute's donors
recognize that it is essential to devote more
dollars to energy research even in the cur
rent budget cutbacks nationwide. Stanford
thus sets an important precedent in moving
forward with the project.
We are also pleased to see that the insti
tute will focus on both micro and macro as
pects of the problem, from hard science to
involvement in a national push for sustain
able energy. Only when we understand ener
gy challenges on both of these levels can we
tackle the challenges of the coming century.
The editorial board hopes and expects
that the institute will bring together some of
the brightest minds in the world to work on
energy research and is pleased to see the cre
ation of new faculty positions and fellow
ships. The University is setting a high stan
dard for job creation in the energy sector,
and we hope that other schools and organi
zations will follow suit.
Improvements in the undergraduate and

graduate energy curriculum expected as a
result of the institute's creation are also
promising, likely drawing some of the most
intelligent scientific minds into energy stud
ies. Pushing more people to pursue such
studies is a key strategy for improving the
United States' enerijy efficiency.

Yesterday, Stanford
proved that it has not
forgotten about energy
in the midst of the
worst financial crisis in
half a century.

Stanford should commend itself for this
noble project. The Precourt Institute, how
ever, is only the beginning. In November, the
editorial board called on the University to
bolster its sustainable construction projects
even during the widespread budget cuts (see
"Stanford's sustainable building projects
should remain a priority" from Nov. 20).
Similarly, we hope that the University's com
mitment to energy research continues well
beyond the development of this institute.
For the coming years, we eagerly anticipate
our university's work as a tour de force in en
vironment and energy research. So far, Stan
ford has proven itself equal to the task.
