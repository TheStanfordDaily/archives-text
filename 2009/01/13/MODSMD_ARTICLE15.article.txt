GAME NOTES: The Stanford wrestlers lost twice and tied
once this weekend at the annual Stanford Duals in Burn
ham Fbvilion. A number of Cardinal miscues put the
Cardinal grapplers in a deep hole. A strong comeback
from the Stanford heavyweights wasn't enough, resulting
in the team's fourth consecutive dual meet defeat. Stan
ford continued to fight, wrestling Drexel to a tie but falling
again in the final match, a 28-12 loss to UC-Davis. The
Cardinal looks to get back on its feet with a win when it
travels to Air Force on Friday.

Davis and Cal State-Bakersfield. each went
undefeated on the day.
The Cardinal suffered several slip-ups in
its first match against Columbia, eventually
putting the match out of reach. With a final
score of 22-18, the match came down to a few
important bouts.
"In the technical aspect, we're still be
hind," Stanford coach Jason Borrelli said.
"Eight of our 10 weight classes are freshmen
or sophomores, and we have many personal
highlights, but we haven't got to the point
where we're clicking as a team."
Freshman Matt Sencenbaugh started off
strongly in the first match of the day. leading
2-1 going into his final period. He slipped just
before the finish, allowing his opponent to
gain the advantage and three more points to
take the win for the Lions.
In the next match at 141 pounds, redshirt
sophomore Cameron Teitleman also suffered
a frustrating loss to put the Cardinal down 0-

12. With the score tied at five. Teitleman in
curred a penalty to give an extra point to his
opponent, Shane Strumwasser. The Colum
bia wrestler scored again to finish the match
7-5.
Sophomore Max Rosefigura gave hope to
the Stanford squad, beating an NCAA quali
fier to bring the Cardinal its first three points.
But shortly thereafter. Columbia senior
Derek Sickles rallied and slammed redshirt
sophomore Lucas Espericueta onto his back
in the 157-pound bout.The match lasted only
19 seconds.
"1 was thinking too hard about what to do
next, and before I knew it the ref was blowing
his whistle; I was on my back." Espericueta
said.

Now down by 15 points, Stanford's heavy
weight classes buckled down and began to
score. Redshirt freshman Nick Amuchastegui
continued last week's hot streak and won his
match 8-2. and freshman Victor Haug was
handed a victory by forfeit. Jake Johnson bat
tled for a 6-3 win to narrow the scoreboard to
a three-point divide. Senior Luke Feist came
from behind to win his match in the final
minute, tying up the score and earning his
72nd career win.The victory tied him for l()th
on Stanford's career win chart, an honor he
has been leading up to all season.
Freshman Matt Winterbourne's first colle
giate match proved to be a trial by fire as he
came up against the nation's 15th-ranked
heavyweight. Taking the match. Columbia

scored a 22-IS final.
Winterbourne, however, looked on his
match as an opportunity to gain valuable ex
perience.
"I didn't feel any pressure," he said. "I
knew I could learn a lot from my first match.
He handled me pretty good, hut now I can
watch the videos, see where I messed up."
Winterbourne said he has healed from the
back injury that had prevented him from
wrestling thus far this season, and can now
consistently hold down the heavyweight class
for Stanford. But as Stanford's only heavy
weight. he still has a long way to go.
"I'm the only heavyweight in the room in

end. The 125-pound freshman has faced particularly tough competition this year, gaining valuable experience along the way. Stanford hopes to
translate that experience into a win over Air Force this Friday.
