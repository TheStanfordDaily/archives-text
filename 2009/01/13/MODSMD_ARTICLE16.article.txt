### CHRISTIAN L. TOM KENAN JIANG 
The No. 2 Stanford men's swimming and
diving team was back in action over the week
end, posting some solid performances and a
multitude of first-place finishes. The divers
competed at the Bruin Invitational in UCLA,
while the swimmers won handily against Pacif
ic at Avery Aquatics Center.
On the diving side, Stanford won all three
competitions. The Cardinal was led by senior
Dwight Dumais, who won both the one- and
three-meter springboard events. Dumais
edged California's Tom Henninger by less than
a point to take the one-meter title with a score
of 323.90. Senior Casey Weston finished sixth,
sophomore Brent Eichenseer finished seventh
and freshman Taylor Sishc finished ninth.
Dumais also won the three-meter spring
board with a score of 338.70, edging out
Eichenseer who finished with 304.55 — good
enough for second place. Weston was fifth and
Sishc came in seventh. Eichenseer went on to
win the platform competition — his best event
— with 342.15, and Sishc finished second in
284.35.
At Avery Aquatic Center on Saturday, the
Cardinal swimmers took on Pacific and beat
them convincingly — almost doubling the
Tigers' score with a final tally of 124-69. The

Cardinal men registered the fastest times in all
events; Pacific was no match for the second
ranked Stanford squad.
