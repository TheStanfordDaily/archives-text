# Time to hang 'em up, Brett

Sometimes, players just need to
know when to leave the gridiron
behind.
Jerome Bettis and Michael Stra
han knew how to go out on top
they left the game as Super Bowl
champions who were still contribut
ing to their squads and maybe even
had a little left in the tank.
Brett Favre? Not so much. So
allow me to offer one of my childhood
idols some much-needed advice: Re
tire. Please. Right now. Spare us an
other off-season of Favre-mania. Go
back to Mississippi, like you've always
wanted to do, and let the game go.
Leave us in peace.
Favre has had a career that most
can only dream of. He's a first-ballot
Hall of Fame lock, a man immortal
ized for his cavalier style of play and
the records that came with it. But he is
no longer the quarterback he once
was. nor is he the presence that he
once was — so much can happen in a
year.
In January 2008. he was in the
midst of a career resurgence. After
putting up mediocre numbers in his
2005 and 2006 campaigns, he returned
to his old self—he was racking up
yardage and tossing frequent TDs,
and his Green Bay Packers were on
the verge of a Super Bowl berth. But
after throwing his final pass in the
NF C Championship game —an in
terception to the New York Giants'
Corey Webster that set up a game
winning field goal — the 2007 ride
was over.
Shortly after the season. Favre an
nounced his retirement. It was an
emotional affair — the longtime
great wept and the media eulogized
the career of a titan. He hadn't gone
out entirely on top. like Bettis or Stra
tum. but he had little left to accom
plish in his career. Super Bowl?
Check. MVP? Check. Broken
records? Check. He would ride off
into the sunset as a hero, a man who
had given the game his all. It was
classy, it was well-orchestrated, it was
right.
And we all know what happened
next: Favre got cold feet and decided
to come back, only to get into a very
public fight with the Packers' manage
ment and subsequently be traded to
the New York Jets for a single draft
pick. His image took a beating as he
was perceived to be holding the Pack
ers hostage. His public persona never
rebounded in New York: I le allegedly
tipped off the Detroit Lions about
Green Bay's game plans and, while he
was the Packers' unquestionable
leader, his disputes with his Jets team
mates surfaced as the 2008 season
neared its conclusion.
His play wasn't much better. Favre
led the league in interceptions
thrown, and he crumbled late in the
year, tossing nine picks and only two
touchdowns over the Jets' last five
games. In the process, he led New
York — a team considered to be a
contender for a playoff bye after a
Week 12 win over then-undefeated
Tennessee — to a 1-4 record over the
home stretch, playing the Jets straight
out of postseason contention alto
gether.The man who made a career by
being a gunslinger couldn't thread the
needle as well as he once could
Webster's interception last year
proved to be a fair indicator of what
was to come.
Meanwhile, the youngster who re
placed him in Green Bay. Aaron
Rodgers, played well enough to war
rant a large contract extension, and
the man he replaced in New York.
Chad Pennington, won Comeback
Player of the Year honors with Miami.
Which brings us back to the pres
ent. Favre asked for and was granted a
few weeks to make a decision about
whether or not to come back. Despite
the quarterback's play, Jets owner
Woody Johnson said that he would
welcome Favre back to New York in
2009. Why? lt'ssimple:A new stadium
is being built in the Meadowlands,and
Johnson has to sell personal seat li
censes, suites and so on. Even though
he's in the white dwarf stage of his ca
reer, Favre still brings home the
bacon.
But Johnson is too caught up in the
monetary side of the sport to actually
stand up to his quarterback. As it

Between the lines
stands, the Jets have little direction.as
they fired their head coach after the
season. Now. while in the midst of a
coaching search, they must deal with
an unsure quarterback situation,
which directly impedes the progress
of the hunt. Carl Banks, a former line
backer and current Sirius NFL talk
show host, said that the two things a
new head coach needs and thus looks
for are good management and a quar

terback. As of now. with Favre taking
his sweet time to make a decision and
Johnson refusing to urge him along,
the incoming Jets coach would have
neither.
Favre does no good for himself or
the Jets by delaying the inevitable —
even if he returns, it will only further
diminish his great career and keep his
team stuck in a miserable rut.
It's time to go, Brett, and now.
We'll see you in Canton in five years.

Wyndam Makowsky just called Brcti
Favre a white dwarf. We always thought
that was Jeff' Garcia. Contact him at
