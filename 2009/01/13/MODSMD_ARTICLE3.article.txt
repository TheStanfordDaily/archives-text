# $100 million Precourt
## energy institute announced 
### NIKHIL JOSHI JULIA BROWNELL 
Flanked by a group including
Silicon Valley titans and renowned
energy scientists. University President
John Hennessy appeared in Memorial
Auditorium yesterday to announce
the launch of Stanford's $ 1 (K) million
Precourt Institute for Energy.
The grant, which Hennessy called
one of the University's largest ever
"program gifts." will fund faculty hir
ing, graduate student support and
energy research. Many of the key
details of the institute were revealed
yesterday, though more should
become clear as work begins.
The institute will create five new
endowed professorships and sponsor
20 new graduate students. In addition,
it will provide research funding, begin
ning with a competition this spring for
$2 million of capital towards a new
project.

Highlighting how the Precourt
Institute "will establish relationships
with other interdisciplinary energy
programs on campus," Hennessy also
described how the program will work
with the current Precourt Center for
Energy Efficiency, the Woods Institute
for the Environment and the Global
Climate and Energy Project (GCEP).
The president was joined on stage
bv Google CEO Eric Schmidt; noted
venture capitalist John Doerr: Jane
Woodward, president of energy
investment firm MAP: Jim Sweeney,
director of the Precourt Center for
Energy Efficiency; and Sally Benson,
director of GCEP Lynn Orr. who will
direct the new institute, moderated a
discussion on energy by the panelists.
Introducing the institute. Hennessy
applauded the instrumental donors —
Jay Precourt '59, who gave $50 million,
and husband and wife Thomas Stever
MBA '83 and Kat Taylor J.D. '85,
MBA '85 who gave $40 million — for

making the University's new focus on
energy possible in the midst of a reces
sion.
"Even in these difficult times, we
can move forward." Hennessy said.
"Certainly energy is one of the most
difficult problems that we face.
Fortunately, we found two sets of
founding donors who not only were
willing to support the effort, but urged
us to develop a comprehensive pro
gram that has shaped our direction."
Hennessy then left the stage, and
the attention shifted to the six pan
elists. Starting with Schmidt, each took
five minutes to deliver respective takes
on the energy problem.
Schmidt spoke of his experience at
Google, and how he quickly realized
that energy efficiency and profit can
go hand in hand.
"So far, none of the energy initia
tives that we have phased have cost
us." Schmidt said as he pointed out that
his energy plans fit in with "good, solid,
conservative CEO principles."
Sweeney — who directs the current
Precourt Center for Energy Efficiency,
which will be incorporated into the new
institute — related America's energy
problem to anti-smoking efforts of
years past, in that although people real
ize smoking, or say carbon emissions,
are harmful, it takes parallel coordinat
ed efforts to mobilize people to curb
smoking or emitting. Like Schmidt.
Sweeney emphasized that economic
efficiency is a necessary condition for
solutions to the energy problem.
Benson, director of GCEP, followed
with a more scientific take on energy.

"There is no shortage of energy
resources on earth." she said. "The chal
lenge is to make that energy available
when and where we need it."
Benson told the audience about
technological developments in the areas
of solar energy, wind, electricity grid
management and biofuels.
She was particularly enthusiastic
about wind-generated power, which she
noted is rapidly gaining market share,
and solar power, which is becoming
more and more efficient through nan
otechnology.
Woodward, who has long taught
courses on energy at Stanford, followed
and was easily the most enthusiastic of
the group.
"I hope there are hundreds, if not
thousands, of you in this audience who
feel like 1 do. which is.'This is one of the
best days of my life"' she said. "1 am so
excited about what these donors are
doing for Stanford, and what the institu

tion is prepared to do."
Woodward, who was involved in
energy long before it became the red
hot field it is today, told the audience
about her experiences teaching courses
on energy.
"Twenty years ago, when 1 started
teaching, I was worried that students
wouldn't even know how to spell ener
gy." she said."! hired an airplane to drag
around a sign saying. Take Energy!'"
Now. the story is different.
Enrollment in energy-related classes is
growing at a nearly exponential pace,
and a number of new degree options
relating to energy issues are opening.
"Today, we have an explosion of
interest." Woodward said.
Last to speak was John Doerr. the
Kleiner Perkins venture capitalist
who has funded companies including
Amazon.com. Sun Microsystems and
Google. Now, Doerr has become pas
sionate about funding energy startups.

"Energy is a $6 trillion economy, and
there are four billion users of electrici
ty," Doerr said. "I like to say that energy
is the mother of all markets. It could be
the largest economic opportunity of the
21st century."
He went on to condemn the current
methods of energy production.
"Borrow, buy. bum —every part of
that has got to stop." Doerr said.
At the same time, however, he was
not at all confident that the energy rev
olution would come from the United
States. Doerr said five of his energy
investments are. in fact. German com
panies. Of the top 30 leading companies
in solar, wind and batteries. Doerr said
only six are American.
He spoke of the battery market as
an example.
"Batteries are a holy grail of green
technology," he said. "The battery is the
foundation of technology for advanced
automobiles.'lhe U.S. is not even in that

race right now — we buy them from
Asia. We are not in the game."
Dt>err is hopeful the new institute
will help America become competitive
in the green arena.
"The way to get it done is to get this
institute going at Stanford, make sure
we make the right investments and
then have the right incentives so that
we accelerate innovation." he said.
After hearing from each of the pan
elists. the audience was allowed to enter
the fray and ask questions, along with
the moderator. Orr.
Doerr and Schmidt were asked
about what advice they are giving to
the government as it positions itself to
address the energy problem. Schmidt is
currently advising the Obama transi
tion team, and Doerr recently testified
to Congress about energy issues
Doerr listed a number of specific
proposals that he included in his
Congressional briefings, ranging from

partnering with utilities to making
investments in education.
He also talked about promising
technologies in which he is investing.
Solar energy excited him in particular.
"There are 100 solar startups in
Silicon Valley," Doerr said. "We might
sit here in a decade or two and call this
thing Solar Valley."
Talking about the opportunities he
is relaying to President-elect Barack
Obama. Schmidt described the need
for quick action — something Stanford
is now pursuing with its $100 million
initative.
"A crisis is a terrible thing to waste."
Schmidt said. "The energy industry
moves slowly — compared to where 1
come from — and it needs to move a
lot faster."

"So far, none of the energy initia
tives that we have phased have cost
us." Schmidt said as he pointed out that
his energy plans fit in with "good, solid,
conservative CEO principles."
Sweeney — who directs the current
Precourt Center for Energy Efficiency,
which will be incorporated into the new
institute — related America's energy
problem to anti-smoking efforts of
years past, in that although people real
ize smoking, or say carbon emissions,
are harmful, it takes parallel coordinat
ed efforts to mobilize people to curb
smoking or emitting. Like Schmidt.
Sweeney emphasized that economic
efficiency is a necessary condition for
solutions to the energy problem.
Benson, director of GCEP, followed
with a more scientific take on energy.

"There is no shortage of energy
resources on earth." she said. "The chal
lenge is to make that energy available
when and where we need it."
Benson told the audience about
technological developments in the areas
of solar energy, wind, electricity grid
management and biofuels.
She was particularly enthusiastic
about wind-generated power, which she
noted is rapidly gaining market share,
and solar power, which is becoming
more and more efficient through nan
otechnology.
Woodward, who has long taught
courses on energy at Stanford, followed
and was easily the most enthusiastic of
the group.
"I hope there are hundreds, if not
thousands, of you in this audience who
feel like 1 do. which is.'This is one of the
best days of my life"' she said. "1 am so
excited about what these donors are
doing for Stanford, and what the institu

tion is prepared to do."
Woodward, who was involved in
energy long before it became the red
hot field it is today, told the audience
about her experiences teaching courses
on energy.
"Twenty years ago, when 1 started
teaching, I was worried that students
wouldn't even know how to spell ener
gy." she said."! hired an airplane to drag
around a sign saying. Take Energy!'"
Now. the story is different.
Enrollment in energy-related classes is
growing at a nearly exponential pace,
and a number of new degree options
relating to energy issues are opening.
"Today, we have an explosion of
interest." Woodward said.
Last to speak was John Doerr. the
Kleiner Perkins venture capitalist
who has funded companies including
Amazon.com. Sun Microsystems and
Google. Now, Doerr has become pas
sionate about funding energy startups.

"Energy is a $6 trillion economy, and
there are four billion users of electrici
ty," Doerr said. "I like to say that energy
is the mother of all markets. It could be
the largest economic opportunity of the
21st century."
He went on to condemn the current
methods of energy production.
"Borrow, buy. bum —every part of
that has got to stop." Doerr said.
At the same time, however, he was
not at all confident that the energy rev
olution would come from the United
States. Doerr said five of his energy
investments are. in fact. German com
panies. Of the top 30 leading companies
in solar, wind and batteries. Doerr said
only six are American.
He spoke of the battery market as
an example.
"Batteries are a holy grail of green
technology," he said. "The battery is the
foundation of technology for advanced
automobiles.'lhe U.S. is not even in that

race right now — we buy them from
Asia. We are not in the game."
Dt>err is hopeful the new institute
will help America become competitive
in the green arena.
"The way to get it done is to get this
institute going at Stanford, make sure
we make the right investments and
then have the right incentives so that
we accelerate innovation." he said.
After hearing from each of the pan
elists. the audience was allowed to enter
the fray and ask questions, along with
the moderator. Orr.
Doerr and Schmidt were asked
about what advice they are giving to
the government as it positions itself to
address the energy problem. Schmidt is
currently advising the Obama transi
tion team, and Doerr recently testified
to Congress about energy issues
Doerr listed a number of specific
proposals that he included in his
Congressional briefings, ranging from

partnering with utilities to making
investments in education.
He also talked about promising
technologies in which he is investing.
Solar energy excited him in particular.
"There are 100 solar startups in
Silicon Valley," Doerr said. "We might
sit here in a decade or two and call this
thing Solar Valley."
Talking about the opportunities he
is relaying to President-elect Barack
Obama. Schmidt described the need
for quick action — something Stanford
is now pursuing with its $100 million
initative.
"A crisis is a terrible thing to waste."
Schmidt said. "The energy industry
moves slowly — compared to where 1
come from — and it needs to move a
lot faster."

Flanked by a group including
Silicon Valley titans and renowned
energy scientists. University President
John Hennessy appeared in Memorial
Auditorium yesterday to announce
the launch of Stanford's $ 1 (K) million
Precourt Institute for Energy.
The grant, which Hennessy called
one of the University's largest ever
"program gifts." will fund faculty hir
ing, graduate student support and
energy research. Many of the key
details of the institute were revealed
yesterday, though more should
become clear as work begins.
The institute will create five new
endowed professorships and sponsor
20 new graduate students. In addition,
it will provide research funding, begin
ning with a competition this spring for
$2 million of capital towards a new
project.

Highlighting how the Precourt
Institute "will establish relationships
with other interdisciplinary energy
programs on campus," Hennessy also
described how the program will work
with the current Precourt Center for
Energy Efficiency, the Woods Institute
for the Environment and the Global
Climate and Energy Project (GCEP).
The president was joined on stage
bv Google CEO Eric Schmidt; noted
venture capitalist John Doerr: Jane
Woodward, president of energy
investment firm MAP: Jim Sweeney,
director of the Precourt Center for
Energy Efficiency; and Sally Benson,
director of GCEP Lynn Orr. who will
direct the new institute, moderated a
discussion on energy by the panelists.
Introducing the institute. Hennessy
applauded the instrumental donors —
Jay Precourt '59, who gave $50 million,
and husband and wife Thomas Stever
MBA '83 and Kat Taylor J.D. '85,
MBA '85 who gave $40 million — for

making the University's new focus on
energy possible in the midst of a reces
sion.
"Even in these difficult times, we
can move forward." Hennessy said.
"Certainly energy is one of the most
difficult problems that we face.
Fortunately, we found two sets of
founding donors who not only were
willing to support the effort, but urged
us to develop a comprehensive pro
gram that has shaped our direction."
Hennessy then left the stage, and
the attention shifted to the six pan
elists. Starting with Schmidt, each took
five minutes to deliver respective takes
on the energy problem.
Schmidt spoke of his experience at
Google, and how he quickly realized
that energy efficiency and profit can
go hand in hand.
"So far, none of the energy initia
tives that we have phased have cost
us." Schmidt said as he pointed out that
his energy plans fit in with "good, solid,
