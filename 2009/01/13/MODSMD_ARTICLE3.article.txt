energy scientists. University President
John Hennessy appeared in Memorial

The grant, which Hennessy called
one of the University's largest ever
"program gifts." will fund faculty hir
ing, graduate student support and
energy research. Many of the key
details of the institute were revealed
yesterday, though more should
become clear as work begins.
The institute will create five new
endowed professorships and sponsor
20 new graduate students. In addition,
it will provide research funding, begin
ning with a competition this spring for
$2 million of capital towards a new
project.

Highlighting how the Precourt
Institute "will establish relationships
with other interdisciplinary energy
programs on campus," Hennessy also
described how the program will work

Hennessy then left the stage, and
the attention shifted to the six pan

Schmidt spoke of his experience at
