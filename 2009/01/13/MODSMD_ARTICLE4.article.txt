# ON CAMPUS
## Sirens to debut on campus Alarm system will alert of imminent danger at seven locations on Farm 
### JULIA BROWNELL CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford will soon install a new emergency-siren alert
system that will he able to alert the entire campus if a sit
uation arises.
Seven sirens will be located throughout the school
grounds to make sure the alert can be heard everywhere.
Three sirens will be placed on 50-foot poles along
Arboretum Road. Gerona Road and Stanford Avenue.
Four will be installed on the roofs of the Lyman
Graduate Residences, the Beckman Center, the Hoskins
mid-rise in Escondido Village and Meyer Library.
'ITie system will be used in life-threatening emergen
cies. This could include a range of events from an armed
gunman on campus — much like the incident at Virginia
Tech in 2007 — to wildfire in the Stanford foothills.
Representatives from Public Safety can activate the
system, along with the provost, the president and repre-
sentatives from the communica
tions office. The sirens are meant to
be a simple alarm, and will there
fore emit a single alert tone. Those
who activate it also have the ability
to follow the alert tone with a voice
over message.
"We need to let people know
right away when there are positive
steps they can take to improve their
personal safety," said Keith Perry,
training and communications man
ager from the Environmental
Health and Safety Office and coor
dinator of the project. " ITie idea of
the siren system is to alert people to
an emergency they need to get
more information about."
The siren system will supple
ment the AlertSlJ system already in
place, which can reach students and
families through email, text mes
sage and phone.
"We realized that no one single
technique is perfect in reaching
everyone." Perry said. "The siren
system is ideal for reaching people
outdoors."
The siren tones will be audible a
certain distance from the Stanford
campus and. as Perry explained, the
University will be working with the
surrounding communities on how
to respond.

"The siren system
is ideal for
reaching people
outdoors."

and Safety Office

"We will engage in an outreach
program with Palo Alto and Menlo
Park." he said. The program will
outline responses to be used for the
tests and actual emergencies.
To ensure the siren system's suc
cess. Perry added that it will be test
ed during and immediately after
installation. Following permanent
implementation, it will be tested
twice annually, once in April and
once in October.
In describing the project. Perry
also hinted that, however effective,
the siren system is not without cost,
calling it "a significant investment
on the part of the University."
In a time of budget cuts, any
large expenditure of the University
is scrutinized.
"I think the money could proba

bly be diverted to other things," said
Chi Nguyen '09. "I feel like the sys
tems already in place are suffi
cient."
In comparison, however, similar
siren systems already exist at many
other schools. The University of
Washington, Washington State and
UC-Berkeley already have such
systems installed, and UCLA
recently implemented its own.
Depending on permits, construc
tion could start as early as the end
of January. Perry, added, however,
that construction will not interrupt
everyday life on campus and that
any problems would be temporary
and related to placing the sirens on
the roofs of buildings.
Ishan Nath '12 favors the siren
system and isn't upset about the
construction.
"I'm not really worried about the
construction impacting daily life,"
he said. "It seems like there's vari
ous construction projects going on
all the time that don't really affect
anybody."
"Besides, I think the end result of
the construction will be worth any
inconvenience," Nath added.
