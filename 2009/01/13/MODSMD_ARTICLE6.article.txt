The Stanford men's volleyball team kicked off its
Pacific-10 Conference season with an auspicious
start this weekend, soaring to the finals of the UC-
Santa Barbara/Elephant Bar Invitational over No. 4
Long Beach State and No. 9 Brigham Young
University (BYU). Despite a 3-1 loss to No. 5 Cal
State-Northridge in the finals, the Cardinal proved
itself a viable contender in the upcoming season.
On Friday, the No. 8 Cardinal (2-1 Pac-10) shut
out three-time National Champion BYU (30-25,30-
24. 30-18) in its season opener. ITie win was due in
part to exceptional passing and serving. Freshmen
Brad Lawson and Erik Shoji were among Coach
John Kosty's starting squad, which also included
Erik's brother kawika, a junior setter.
A vital contributor in Stanford's victory over
BYU, Kosty praised the senior Shoji for being able to
"spread out Ihe offense very well and [get] the mid
dles involved early." A number of Stanford players,
both middles and outside hitters, got in on the action
due to Kawika's superb sets.
