## MEN'S VOLLEYBALL PLAYS WELL IN SOCAL 
### JEFF LU 
The Stanford men's volleyball team kicked off its
Pacific-10 Conference season with an auspicious
start this weekend, soaring to the finals of the UC-
Santa Barbara/Elephant Bar Invitational over No. 4
Long Beach State and No. 9 Brigham Young
University (BYU). Despite a 3-1 loss to No. 5 Cal
State-Northridge in the finals, the Cardinal proved
itself a viable contender in the upcoming season.
On Friday, the No. 8 Cardinal (2-1 Pac-10) shut
out three-time National Champion BYU (30-25,30-
24. 30-18) in its season opener. ITie win was due in
part to exceptional passing and serving. Freshmen
Brad Lawson and Erik Shoji were among Coach
John Kosty's starting squad, which also included
Erik's brother kawika, a junior setter.
A vital contributor in Stanford's victory over
BYU, Kosty praised the senior Shoji for being able to
"spread out Ihe offense very well and [get] the mid
dles involved early." A number of Stanford players,
both middles and outside hitters, got in on the action
due to Kawika's superb sets.

Junior Garrett Werner helped lead No. 8 Stanford to wins
over two top-10 teams last weekend in Long Beach, Calif.
The Card begins a five-game road trip on Wednesday.
After an initial setback, the Stanford men
proceeded to nab their second win of the day,
battling Long Beach State to a semifinal vic
tory (28-30, 30-27, 30-20, 30-28). Freshman
Gus Ellis made his first collegiate start along
side veterans Spencer McLachlin and Garrett
Werner. The trio combined to create a block
ing wall that stymied the Long Beach offense
all evening.
The team's five freshmen are off to a great
start this season, according to Kosty.
"They have truly integrated themselves
into the team," he said. "This is one of those
teams where it has become hard to recognize
a senior or a freshman;everyone is focused on
the team concept and becoming the best team
in the country."
Saturday evening, the Cardinal found it

self facing a familiar opponent — Cal State-
Northridge. The Matadors had previously de
feated the Cardinal 3-1 at the UC-Irvine Fall
Invitational last November and swept the
team out of last year's Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSF) quarterfinals. De
spite 18 kills and a .317 hitting percentage by
junior Evan Romero. Stanford crumbled at
the hands of Northridge. falling once again in
four sets (30-21,20-30.27-30,20-30).
"CSUN is a very good team that does not
make unforced errors." Kosty said. "Their
serving game in particular made the differ
ence in the match.They did not serve well in
the first game but significantly improved [in
the next three] and put a lot of pressure on
our sideout game."
ITie Cardinal did put up a spectacular re
sistance against Northridge's offensive play,
including 16 digs by Erik Shoji and 12 kills by
McLachlin. Ultimately, even a combined 13
blocks from Lawson and Ellis were unable lo
stop Northridge's offense. The Matadors
were led by first-team All-American Eric

Vance, who managed a match-high 20 kills.
Vance was subsequently named MVP for the
tournament, with Stanford's Shoji brothers
earning spots on the eight-member all-tour
nament team.
Stanford's weekend performance fol
lowed a No.B preseason ranking by the Amer
ican Volleyball Coaches Association (AVCA)
poll. The Cardinal was also picked to finish
seventh in the 12-team MPSF.
With seven nationallyranked teams, the
UCSB/Elephant Bar Invitational is regarded
as one of the toughest tournaments in the
country, and the Cardinal's strong perform
ance in Santa Barbara proved that the team's
turnaround from a dismal 3-25 finish in 2007
to a NCAA contender in 2009 is almost com
plete.
"We had a good weekend." said Kosty.
adding that he believes the team's perform
ance last weekend is a good sign for the fu
ture. "We knew going into the tournament
that we were playing well, but we wanted to
see how we matched up with MPSF' oppo

nents.
"I think being picked seventh in the pre
season poll was a fair assessment without see
ing any team play," he continued. "I think it
would be tough to put us higher in the first
poll with having such a young team."
After hauling in what were arguably the
best recruiting classes in the nation for each of
the past two years — including the past two
national high school players of the year in
McLachlin and Lawson — there is little
doubt that Kosty has assembled the ingredi
ents to build a team capable of contending for
a national championship. The expectations
will be high for the up-and-coming Stanford
squad as it begins an extensive road trip visit
ing Pacific, Ohio State, Hall State, USC and
rival Pepperdine.
The Cardinal will host Long Beach State
and UCSD in its home opener during the
weekend of .lan. 30-31. Attendance is free to
both students and the general public.

the past two years — including the past two
national high school players of the year in
McLachlin and Lawson — there is little
doubt that Kosty has assembled the ingredi
ents to build a team capable of contending for
a national championship. The expectations
will be high for the up-and-coming Stanford
squad as it begins an extensive road trip visit
ing Pacific, Ohio State, Hall State, USC and
rival Pepperdine.
The Cardinal will host Long Beach State
and UCSD in its home opener during the
weekend of .lan. 30-31. Attendance is free to
both students and the general public.
