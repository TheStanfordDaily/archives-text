## LOUNGE HOPPING

new trend is about to hit campus. It's
112 \ like fountain hopping for academics.
LA and it's called lounge hopping.

On my first lounge-hopping trip. I found I I
joy in disrupting students of all years and I I
majors who were trying to get just a little bit I I
of work done. I I
1. Psychology Lounge I I
A very pretty space with wooden book- I I
shelves and deep, cushioned chairs, the I I
Psychology Lounge offers a peaceful I I
space for reading or working. It's easy to I I
access on the first floor of bldg. 420. * I
"It's somewhere where I can't find "
any of my friends around and can study without running
into anyone I know." said Abdel Khaleq i 1. toying with
his computer mouse. "And of course, there's the coffee
machine."
Even with those amenities, though, psychology
majors like T'amar Kreps '09 have yet to utilize the
space.
"I always thought the lounge was for department
parties and grad students." she said. "Nothing wrong
with it."
Communication/Urban Studies Lounge
Located on the second floor of bldg. 120. this lounge
features a dark and quiet study space, complete with a
black leather couch.TTiere's also a small kitchenette, but
no students — except for the guy who walked in on his
cell phone, ready to microwave his Spaghetti-os.
3. Building 160
What department is this? Not really sure. And does it
even have a lounge? It's hard to tell in bldg. 160 at 11 in
the morning.
"We could call it an academically sterile lounge," said
Melissa Bishop "09. settling into a cushioned seat.
The space is more conducive to quick tasks and
group meetings than afternoons of studying. Although
Bishop has utilized the space, she is much more inclined
towards the Psychology Lounge and other more com
fortable places.
4. English Lounge
The English department was easily the most enthusi
astic about its lounge. Colleen Boucher, a receptionist,
explained that the graduate student lounge on the
fourth floor was strictly for graduate students and
required a code for entry. The undergraduate lounge on
the second floor, however, provided an open working
space for faculty and students.
"The vision was for it to be a community space, some
where for people to go between classes," said Katie
Dooling. student services coordinator. "Not a lot of our
classes are taught in one place, but it's a physical space,
and students use it often. It's a public space intentional
ly. We want people to feel welcome and free to go in and
out. Faculty, too."
Ryan Heuser, first year Ph.D. student in English, has
taken advantage of the cozy area.

"I've been here a couple of times, reading and probably
munching on something." he said, flipping through his
paperback idly. "This one's nice: it's got comfy chairs,
tables, a window. There are no windows in the grad
lounge, but nicer furniture."
Topping the list, though, is the English department's
Briggs room, which is rarely used and requires a keypad
password to get into.
5. Math Lounge?
Well, it doesn't actually exist. But the math library
has a patio perfect for finishing problem sets just in the
nick of time, as well as tables ideal for napping. While it
might not be as conducive to conversation or collabora
tion as an actual lounge, it is certainly up to par.
The only student present who wasn't fleeing the
library, sleeping or participating in a research study was
Tristan Collins, a senior from the University of British
Columbia (ÜBC).
"I like this compared to the four enormous libraries
[at ÜBC]. which are newer, but include more subjects
and are always more crowded." he said, quietly, as to not
disturb the nappers.
Biology Lounge?
I slowly approached the engineering quad around 1
p.m.. and I began with a visit to the biology department,
which has no student lounge.
Jennifer Mason, student services officer, explained
that with labs occupying not just the entirety of Gilbert
hall, but space in more than five other buildings, the
department simply could not fit a lounge.
"I envy the departments that do." she said. "I wish we
could offer that to all students."
1. Packard Building
The Packard Electrical Engineering Center offers
the Bytes Cafe and what Dan Haynam, a graduate stu
dent in electrical engineering (EE), confirms is "the sec
ond-floor kitchenette space."
"This space is open," said Behram Mistree. a first
year Ph D student in EE. "It doesn't have a whiteboard
or anything."
Mistree and his cohorts in the second-floor kitch
enette agree that libraries and the great outdoors are
better alternatives.
O. Anthropology Lounge
A quick jaunt through the inner Quad turned up two
promising lounges. The Anthropology Lounge is small,
but quiet — conveniently set just inside bldg. 60.
between Memorial Church and the edge of the Quad.
Sadly, this lounge is held under tight lock. Even dur

ing daytime hours, undergraduate students must
request that an administrator let them in.
Q. Religious Studies Lounge
On the opposite side of the church is the Religious
Studies Lounge. This space features a comfortable set of
furniture, a small writing surface and kitchenette.
Perhaps it is the plentiful natural light or the wall of
books that make this lounge inviting.
Lounges in the Quad, though, have limited hours.
Except for the English department's open and welcom
ing undergraduate lounge, the rest of the lounge doors
are locked around 5 p.m.. even when other parts of the
building are open until 9 p.m.
10 . [Classified]
Next stop's no longer a secret. The next leg of my
lounge-hopping tour took me to the statistics building,
between Hewlett and the Math Corner of the Quad.
This lounge was poorly marked and also locked, and I
don't think either of these occurrences was accidental.
When I interrupted Shaun Maguire. a second-year
master's student in statistics. I told him I was writing an
article for The Daily about lounges on campus.
"I don't want to give away the secret." he said, throw
ing me a suspicious look.
Although he joked that I should refer to the Statistics
Lounge simply as "an undisclosed lounge on the
Stanford campus." he couldn't help but brag about the
great literature available, and the ability to speak with
faculty casually.

"We have books and some not-so-scientific journals
in here, which I think people actually sit down and read
from time to time," Maguire said.
The lounge also serves as a gathering area for events,
or eating areas during lunchtime.
"Whenever we have events, like colloquiums, or our
Halloween party, we hold it in here," Maguire said. "On
Oct. 31. we [got] to see all of our profs, in costume, hav
ing a good time. And they eat their lunch, or do work in
here."
11. Green Library
Finally, Green. Graduates, undergraduates and psych
and English majors alike gravitate towards Green
Library. Aside from "outside" and "random places."
Heusner, Mistree. Khaleq and Maguire all cited it as a
favorite place to study. The spaciousness of the first
floor, the coziness of study rooms and. of course, the
mystery of the stacks are alluring.
After all that lounge hopping, though. I found the
real advantage in going from lounge to lounge is that
you don't have to do any of the studying — When it
comes down to it. studying is. well, studying.
"There's no favorite place to study, because studying
can't make me happier in any place or another." Khaleq
said with a shrug. "I guess I prefer studying in Green
because I can concentrate there in the dark cubicles on
the second floor."
