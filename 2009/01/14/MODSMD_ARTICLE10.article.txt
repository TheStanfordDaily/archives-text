### TERRY COLLINS THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
SAN FRANCISCO—The for
mer Bay Area Rapid Transit po
lice officer who fatally shot an
unarmed man on an Oakland
train platform was arrested in
Nevada 12 days after the shoot
ing.
A Douglas County jail staffer
said that 27-year-old Johannes
Mehserle was in custody Tuesday
night under a fugitive warrant is
sued from California. The person
spoke on condition of anonymity
because the arrest had not been
announced.
Karen Boyd, a spokeswoman
for Oakland Mayor Ron Del
lums, confirmed the arrest and
said the mayor's office had been
informed of it earlier Tuesday
night.
Alameda County District At
torney Tom Orloff was expected
to announce details of the
charges on Wednesday.
Witnesses say Mehserle fired
into the back of 22-year-old
Oscar Grant while the man was
lying facedown on a train plat
form at a BAR! station in Oak
land. Grant and others had been
pulled off a train after reports of
fighting, as New Year's Eve revel
ers were shuttling home after
midnight.
The shooting was captured on
several cell phone cameras and
widely viewed on the Internet.
John Burris, the attorney for
Grant's family, said he talked to
Grant's mother, Wanda Johnson,
on Tuesday night and she was de
lighted with the news.
"However it does not bring
her son back." Burris said. "But
she is happy and pleased that an
arrest has occurred."
Grant's family has also filed a
$25 million legal claim against
BART.
A message left late TUesday
night at the office of Mehserle's
attorney, Christopher Miller, was
not immediately returned.
The shooting has inflamed
long-running tensions between

law enforcement authorities and
many African-American resi
dents in Oakland. Hundreds of
protesters have taken to the
streets calling for the prosecution
of Mehserle, with one rally last
Wednesday spiraling into vio
lence and resulting in more than
100 arrests and dozens of busi
nesses damaged.
About 1,000 people were ex
pected at another protest on
Wednesday to call on Orloff to
file criminal charges.
Dereca Blackmon. the co
tounder of the Coalition Against
Police Execution, which is organ
izing Wednesday's protest, said
she was pleased Mehserle was ar
rested but still wanted to know
more details.
"We're disappointed that it
took him feeling the state in
order for the law to take some ac
tion," she said. "Honestly this sit
uation brings more questions
than answers. Why was he flee
ing?"
Douglas County is 15 miles
south of Carson City in north
western Nevada and includes
Lake Tahoe and Carson Valley.
Mehserle refused to talk to
BART investigators before re
signing his position last week.The
transit authority passed on de
tails of its internal investigation
to Orloff s office on Monday. Ilie
case also is being investigated by
the Oakland Police Department.
State Attorney General Jerry
Brown has assigned a prosecutor
to monitor the case, and the U.S.
Department of Justice has dis
patched mediators to help avert
violent protests such as one in
Oakland last week.
BART board member Carole
Ward Allen said she was pleased
to hear the news about the arrest.
"I want to know why he did
it," she said. "We've heard from
everybody else but him. While I
can't speak for the entire BART
board, we want to make this
process as transparent as possi
ble."
