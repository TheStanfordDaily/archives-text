# STUDENT GOV'T
## ASSU reflects on public perception 
### MARISA LANDICHO STAFF WRITER 
ITic l()th Undergraduate Senate is fed up with
its bad reputation. After pursuing initiatives vary
ing from increased funding for Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS) and anti-
Proposition K advocacy, the lack of student recogni
tion has left the Senate feeling underappreciated.
Newly appointed Senate Chair Shelley Gao "II
and Senators Prachi Priyam Ml, Yvorn "Doc"
Aswad-Thomas Ml and Patrick Cordova '09 met
with The Daily to discuss the good and the had
from fall quarter.
On one hand, the Senate has embraced advoca
cy along with funding as its main realm of influence.
The effectiveness of this newfound advocacy has
been hampered, however, by a persistent belief
held by many students that the ASSIJ is incompe
tent.
Aswad-Thomas pointed to the coverage of
Senate meetings as being skewed.
"It's the larger, collective things that we do in
these meetings that are sometimes shown as bad. or
slander or dramatic, like we're our own reality TV
series," Aswad-Thomas said. "Sometimes, those

"We haven't had favorable
publicity and yet we find it
[in ourselves] to persist."

things actually make a Senate move."
Gao added that the Senate was evolving
through this process and would be set to transition
in the spring without the typical loss of institution
al memory.
"We're not looking for 'thanks' or anything in
return." Priyam said. "We want to let (the students]
know that we are there."
The concrete accomplishments of the Senate as
a whole are harder to pinpoint than. say. those of

the Executives, since much of what the Senate does
is on an individual basis rather than through unified
agenda points.
Aswad-Thomas explained that senators were
elected to pursue their individual platforms, and
that they joined the body to gain leverage for their
specific goals and also to help other members in
their pursuits.
On a whole, the Senate made progress last quar
ter with supporting student groups, either through
funding or political support.
In the beginning of the year, the Senate passed a
resolution in opposition to Prop. 8 and also promot
ed the mega-phone bank organized to combat the
legislation, lliis effort, though, was overshadowed
by the debate over whether to fund $4.(XX) in pur
ple shirts used for the marriage equality campaign.
Less controversially, the Senate also supported
an increase in recreational swim hours and lobbied
the administration to save the most valued pro
grams in the upcoming budget cuts.
"We're showing the student body how the
ASSU can be used as an avenue to progress their
own initiatives," Gao said.
