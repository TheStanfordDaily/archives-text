## Farm demands more computing power 
### AMY HARRIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Scientific researchers at Stanford
are running into a new problem — a
lack of computing capacity at cur
rent on-campus data centers. IT
Services has listened to researchers
calling for increased computing
power and capacity, and is currently
in the process of looking into possi
ble multi-million dollar solutions for
these data centers.
Nancy Ware, director of Strategic
Planning and Communications in IT
Services, said a major project is being
analyzed by IT Services and Dean of
Research Ann Arvin proposes build
ing a centralized research data center
at the SLAC National Accelerator
Laboratory, in addition to retrofitting
the existing data centers to meet
researchers' computing needs.
While these proposals are only in

their initial cost-benefit stages and
must be green-lighted by both the
provost and the board of trustees.
Ware said the team is hard at work
trying to find the best way to tackle
the issue.
"We're looking at the tradeoff
between what should be invested
into current facilities and how much
time that will buy us vis-a-vis invest
ment in something new." Ware said.
She added that researchers are
simply making use of the facilities
they have now. using the few. isolated
spaces on campus that have been
retrofitted to accommodate their
high-performance machines. But
with some of the logistical draw
backs of retrofitting. Ware wondered
if it is enough.
"We are looking at ways to retro
fit the current data center so that it
can accommodate research needs,
but it can onlv so so far." she said.

"We're trying to anticipate at what
place we run out of that capacity."
Ware explained that there were
numerous benefits to having a new
data center.
"With the new data center at
SLAC in one concentrated place,
you achieve economy of scale sav
ings, whereas you wouldn't by
building smaller data centers with
in new and old campus facilities,"
she said. "Additionally. Stanford's
intranet networking infrastructure
(its Internet pipeline) is already
run at SLAC, which saves on hav
ing to enlist someone like AT&T to
run it."
While the new data center may
achieve savings. Ware estimated
that projected costs could range
between $20 million and $30 mil
lion. Still, she noted, the initial
investment would be paid back
within 15 to 20 years.

Stanford is looking to make the
proposed data center a viable long
term investment project, enlisting
IDC Architects, an international
green design firm that specializes in
sustainable design, to brainstorm
ideas for the new data facility at
SLAC.
One innovative proposal for the
SLAC data center is to rely primari
ly on ambient air for cooling the data
servers rather than air conditioning,
which is currently used.
As they exist now. data centers —
the facilities that house servers and
data volumes — must run around
the-clock air-conditioning systems to
keep the ambient air temperature
from rising, which can cause equip
ment malfunction.
"The architects have provided
desiens which use fans to circulate
the cool ambient air with a signifi
cantly reduced demand for electrical
energy to power the fans," Ware
said. "ITiis contributes to our envi
ronmental sustainability goals as
well as produces cost savings."
Still, no decisions on either the

extent of retrofitting existing data
centers or plans for the new data
center at SLAC have been finalized.
"We are incredibly conscious of
the current economic situation, and
we want to make sure that we are
doing the very best thing for the
Stanford dollar," Ware said. "We
don't want to spend money if we
don't have to spend money."
