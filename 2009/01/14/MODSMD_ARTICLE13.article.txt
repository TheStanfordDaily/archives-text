## Editorial Praise for a revived Senior Night 
### 
rplie first days of winter quarter mark the
beginning of the end for the Class of
JL 2(X)9. With just five months left at Stan
ford, the finish line is just beyond the horizon
and the future is promising with unforgettable
spring break plans, the beauty that is spring
quarter and finally walking across the gradua
tion stage.This week also marks the return of
Senior Night, the tradition that was cancelled
in November when multiple irresponsible stu
dents were hospitalized and others vomited
on buses (See "Seniors regain Pub privileges"
in today's issue ofThe Daily).
The editorial board is happy to see the re
instatement of Senior Night and also glad to
see that the appropriate measures have been
taken to improve the experience for all those
who attend. We applaud both the senior class
presidents and the Office of Student Activities
(OSA) regarding their new plans for how to
avoid future Senior Night problems.
The plan for the revival of Senior Night, in
formally known as Pub Night, was discussed
in an email from Senior Class President John
ny McCormick on Tuesday night. McCormick
warned students that 1) Overly intoxicated
students will not he allowed onto the buses, 2)
Getting sick on a bus carries a $S(X) fine,and 3)
Overly intoxicated individuals with no one to
take him/her home may be escorted by the po
lice and may spend time in the drunk tank.The
class presidents also mentioned that sober
monitors will be playing a larger role on the
buses and making themselves more visible.
These policy clarifications not only force
those who were unable to follow the pre-set
guidelines to take responsibility for their ac
tions, but also call on the remainder of the sen
ior class to hold their peers accountable. This
reminder will hopefully compel seniors to en
sure that events of Pub Nights past do not re
peat themselves.
When the news of the cancellation came
out in November, many seniors complained
that they were not given enough notice of Se
nior Night potentially being cancelled or of
the fines that could be enforced. With the
email, the signed agreements and the im
proved flow of information surrounding Se
nior Night, there is essentially no excuse for
continued misbehavior.
McCormick's email also served as a re
minder to students who took Senior Night for
granted. References to budget cuts and admin

istrative funding acted as a sharp reminder
that Senior Night is a privilege, not a right, and
should be treated as such. It is uncomfortable
to think about a group of seniors who get heav
ily subsidized social events like Senior Night,
but cannot drink and/or act responsibly, while
Stanford employees are facing layoffs.
It is embarrassing to think of how the ac
tions of a few have drawn a negative stigma to
wards the entire Stanford community and
have caused certain companies to no longer
want to do business with us. It is our hope that
the Stanford community holds itself to a high
er standard, and all parties involved begin to
reflect that standard. The undergraduate stu
dent body owes it to the administration that
foots the bill for these events, as well as our
selves, to act accordingly.
For those who were outraged by the deci
sive end of Pub Night last quarter, the re
minder of cuts being made across the board
should put more pressure on those seniors
who have the tendency to be a little heavy
handed with the bottle to act responsibly or
stay at home this Thursday night. Similarly, it
should put more pressure on seniors to make
sure that their friends don't get out of line.
Going a little over the top with alcohol was
mildly amusing freshman year, but as students
reach the end of their time at Stanford, we
must hold them to a greater level of maturity.
The inability to make sound choices with alco
hol is not the celebration of one's seniority but
rather alludes to greater problems like alcohol
abuse, an issue of which Stanford needs to be
more aware.
Considering the immature nature of the
actions that led up to this point, much thanks
needs to be given to the OSA for the way in
which it decided to handle the matter.The fact
that we are given a second chance without the
imposition of drastic new measures shows
faith in the senior class, our leadership and our
ability to learn from our mistakes.
The administration and the senior class
presidents have done their commendable part
and put the ball in the seniors' court. It is now
up to the Class of 2(X)9 to determine how it
wants the rest of its senior year to be. As Mc-
Cormick stated in his email, the editorial
board hopes that you too decide that the re
maining Senior Nights will be filled with
"more thrills,and (hopefully) less vomit."
Drink responsibly.
