## Musharraf and the Stanford student 
### 
Ihave now received an impressive 14 emails
inviting me to attend former Pakistani Pres
ident Pervez Musharrafs speech at Stanford
on Friday. I can only assume that I will receive
another 20 by the time the speech occurs, mean
ing it might almost be worth it to make a special
"Musharraf filter on my email program. It is
unclear why students think that somehow, there
are hundreds of students on only one email list
and if they do not hit every single list, those hun
dreds of students cannot possibly know that
THE FORMER PRESIDENT OF PAK
ISTAN IS SPEAKING ON FRIDAY.
I'm also not sure that all of the students for
warding that "e-flyer" have more than a one
sentence understanding of who Musharraf is
and why he is important. I was gushing to a good
friend of mine about how I managed to secure
myself a spot in the student Q&A before the
speech, and went on and on about how excited
I was to ask a tough question until I realized that
he was only pretending to know whom I was
talking about. And I am sure he is not the only
one.
It's instances like this and the absurd email
barrage of that past few days that make me ques
tion the average Stanford student's awareness
level of even the most basic issues in foreign pol
icy and international affairs. All of the emails I
have received about the speech were forwarded
without comment.suggesting that students don't
really know much about him.
Musharrafs record of spectacular corrup
tion. military rule and flagrant misuse of valu
able U.S. anti-terror dollars, in my opinion,
would certainly make for an interesting O&A
— that is, if students even know who he is. But it
seems they don't. The appeal of Musharraf is
being driven solely by the fact that he is a former
head of state of an important country, rather
than anything particular to him.
It's unfortunate that the only issues outside
of our borders that get students interested are
those limited to interest groups: Pro-Israel and
pro-Palestine elements will wage their own
proxy battle in the form of Daily op-eds, a tradi
tion as long-lived and intractable as the Israel-
Palestine conflict itself. Human rights activists
urge us all to support American or IJ.N. inter

vention in Darfur, while turning around and de
manding that we leave Iraq immediately. Stu
dents seem to mistake activism for knowledge,
yet most of the pressing issues in international
affairs are not ones that involve human rights —
which seems to be the main criterion for stu
dents getting involved in an issue. FACES, the
main U.S.-China group on campus, tries valiant
ly to get students interested in China. No one
seems to realize that the relationship wit h China
is one of the most important issues facing the
United States, however, and turnout at FACES
events is disappointingly low.
Considering the low level of student engage
ment or knowledge of foreign policy issues, it is
unclear what Stanford in Government's inten
tions are in bringing Musharraf to campus. The
group has had a mixed record, bringing in some
real heavyweights, like former Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright, and some light
weights. like John Edwards and Ralph Nader.
SIG is promoting this as its annual "Big Speak
er" without making a case for why Musharraf is
a"BigSpeaker."Simplyequatinga head of state
with a "Big Speaker" is not the way to bring
more political discourse to Stanford undergrad
uates.
In a sense, this reminds me of Columbia Uni
versity's spectacularly misguided decision to
bring Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadine
jad to campus While I am all for a discourse and
respect of controversial speakers, it does not
seem that Stanford students are properly
equipped to critically assess his record.
I really do encourage all of you to read up on
Musharraf and attend the talk on Friday, I just
don't have high expectations for the talk,or the
undergraduates' reaction to it.
