## Dunkin' Donuts attempts to inspire America 
### 
Ringing in the new year with this partic
ularly daunting new year in mind.
Dunkin' Donuts has just released a
new ad that says,"You 'kin do it" to all the dis
gruntled (and coffee-drinking) Joe Six-Packs
out there.
The ad features a selection of ordinary
Americans who have found themselves up to
their necks in ordinary troubles. One man at
tempts to shovel his driveway in four feet of
snow while it continues to snow all around
him; another is baffled by the instructions to
put together a children's swing set. On the
feminine front, a frazzled mother struggles
with her screaming brood of quadruplets as
her professional counterpart faces a moun
tain of paperwork in the office.
All of these characters are certainly de
signed to be relatable for the average viewer,
if not exactly enviable. Yet each and every one
of them remains optimistic about their mun
dane and overburdened existences, simply
because they all have access to the Holy Grail

of inspiration — a steaming hot cup of
Dunkin' Donuts coffee. It is this small hut sig
nificant item that allows each of them to say "I
'kin do it" to the frustrating duties of daily life.
Now, being a coffee addict myself, I under
stand the value of a good cup of joe just as
well as the next person. But there's something
more than just the fulfillment of the caffeine
addiction promised in this ad; whether it is the
lofty superhero music playing in the back
ground, or the way the deep-voiced narrator
addresses his motivational message to "those
who keep America running," something
seems to be operating on the national rather
than personal level.
Part of the reason for this may be the fact
that the slogan of the ad — "With a cup of
Dunkin' Donuts coffee, you 'kin do it" — re
minds one almost simultaneously of the
phrases "We can do it!" and "Yes we can,"
both patriotic slogans that have been used to
galvanize the American people during times
of national need. The former indubitably calls

to mind the well-known image of Rosie the
Riveter, probably the prettiest harbinger of
economic stimulus America has ever seen.
And as for the latter... well, if there's a per
son who doesn't immediately think of Presi
dent-elect Barack Obama, then he or she
probably does not buy coffee from Dunkin'
Donuts anyway.
The coffee franchise could have done far
worse in picking a politician for a motivation
al allusion, since it's fair to say that Obama is
a reigning expert on how to pull a needle of
optimism out of a haystack of financial prob
lems. But besides capitalizing on Obama's tal
ent for inspiring people to look towards a
brighter future, a reference to his trademark
slogan and presidential candidacy also carries
a very distinct connotation — namely, the
salience of the foundering state of America's
economy. And. as the cheaper coffee alterna
tive to the ritzier Starbucks, it's no wonder


Sandy
Nader
that Dunkin' Donuts would like to
remind people, as often as possible,
that no one really has money to buy
five-dollar Frappuecinos nowadays.
Just as it was in the case of Obama's
candidacy, the failing economy is now
Dunkin" Donuts' biggest selling
point.
Yet it isn't as if Dunkin' Donuts
has tried to keep this a secret: In
their most recent press release.
Dunkin' Donuts brand Marketing
Officer Frances Allen said that
"Dunkin' Donuts will continue to
fuel (hard-working Americans']
busy day[s] and provide a bit of hap
piness without blowing the lid off
their budget." Just bv being a little

thrifty and buying a cup of Dunkin'
Donuts coffee, the characters in the
ad are all able to retain a sense of op
timism in the face of their potential
ly overwhelming situations — all of
which are microcosms for the larger,
overwhelming problem of our plum
meting economy. It is exactly the
kind of reassurance that we cash
strapped, coffee-addicted con
sumers need right now. an affirma
tion that there will still be a bit of
caffeinated enjoyment left to us in
the hard times ahead. This ad sug
gests that maybe—just maybe —
life in a recession won't be so terri
ble after all. especially when con
sumers still have economical op
tions.
This style of feel-good advertising
has flooded the first group of 2(X)9
ads, with some coming out as more
digestible than others. The feat that
Dunkin' Donuts has achieved over

its peers is rationality. It oozes opti
mism, but only because the con
sumers in the ad are actually easing
their situations by spending less
money and buying cheaper coffee.
Senseless optimism and empty
promises, no matter how attractive
they may seem, cannot be the new
year's resolutions offered to the
American people — and certainly
not from a coffee seller, let alone any
politician. For the year ahead, we
need to be inspired in a way that
keeps our feet on the ground and our
chins up. propelled by motivation
that encourages us to think practical
ly as well as sanguinely.
And of course, a little hit of coffee
on the wav wouldn't hurt either.

Sandy is probably drinking another
cup of coffee right now. To help her
