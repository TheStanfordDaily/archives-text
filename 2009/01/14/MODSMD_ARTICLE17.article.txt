## Dunkin' Donuts attempts to inspire America 
### 
Ringing in the new year with this partic
ularly daunting new year in mind.
Dunkin' Donuts has just released a
new ad that says,"You 'kin do it" to all the dis
gruntled (and coffee-drinking) Joe Six-Packs
out there.
The ad features a selection of ordinary
Americans who have found themselves up to
their necks in ordinary troubles. One man at
tempts to shovel his driveway in four feet of
snow while it continues to snow all around
him; another is baffled by the instructions to
put together a children's swing set. On the
feminine front, a frazzled mother struggles
with her screaming brood of quadruplets as
her professional counterpart faces a moun
tain of paperwork in the office.
All of these characters are certainly de
signed to be relatable for the average viewer,
if not exactly enviable. Yet each and every one
of them remains optimistic about their mun
dane and overburdened existences, simply
because they all have access to the Holy Grail

of inspiration — a steaming hot cup of
Dunkin' Donuts coffee. It is this small hut sig
nificant item that allows each of them to say "I
'kin do it" to the frustrating duties of daily life.
Now, being a coffee addict myself, I under
stand the value of a good cup of joe just as
well as the next person. But there's something
more than just the fulfillment of the caffeine
addiction promised in this ad; whether it is the
lofty superhero music playing in the back
ground, or the way the deep-voiced narrator
addresses his motivational message to "those
who keep America running," something
seems to be operating on the national rather
than personal level.
Part of the reason for this may be the fact
that the slogan of the ad — "With a cup of
Dunkin' Donuts coffee, you 'kin do it" — re
minds one almost simultaneously of the
phrases "We can do it!" and "Yes we can,"
both patriotic slogans that have been used to
galvanize the American people during times
of national need. The former indubitably calls

to mind the well-known image of Rosie the
Riveter, probably the prettiest harbinger of
economic stimulus America has ever seen.
And as for the latter... well, if there's a per
son who doesn't immediately think of Presi
dent-elect Barack Obama, then he or she
probably does not buy coffee from Dunkin'
Donuts anyway.
The coffee franchise could have done far
worse in picking a politician for a motivation
al allusion, since it's fair to say that Obama is
a reigning expert on how to pull a needle of
optimism out of a haystack of financial prob
lems. But besides capitalizing on Obama's tal
ent for inspiring people to look towards a
brighter future, a reference to his trademark
slogan and presidential candidacy also carries
a very distinct connotation — namely, the
salience of the foundering state of America's
economy. And. as the cheaper coffee alterna
tive to the ritzier Starbucks, it's no wonder
