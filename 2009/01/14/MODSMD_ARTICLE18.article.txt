## Defending the Wellness Room 
### 
In the Jan. 12 editorial "Wellness Room
only small step in solving mental health
crisis," the editorial board undermines the
significance of small steps forward, overesti
mates the available resources in our time of
economic crisis and picks and chooses quota
tions from the Student Mental Health and
Well-Being Task Force Report, which sup
port the editorial board's view that this is not
an effective intervention.
The Wellness Room is the outcome of nu
merous discussions with members of the task
force, detailed analysis of their report, con
versations with Vaden staff and student
stake-holders and leaders across campus.
Collectively, we have the utmost faith in this
initiative.
The "serious mental health crisis plaguing
our campus" that the board describes is real.
But by describing the Wellness Room as an
"inadequate solution," it is letting great be

the enemy of good. Will this initiative fix the
problem entirely? No, absolutely not. But in
conjunction and coordination with the vari
ety of other effective campus interventions
— Vaden. The Bridge, Stanford Peace of
Mind.etc. — it will help push back this rising
tide of depression. Additionally, this is a
small, first step. This is a two-quarter pilot
program, which will expand should the stu
dents and administration deem it a success.
Ilie University is facing a massive finan
cial challenge. The reality is that many staff
will be let go, and this is a bad year to lobby
for new full-time employees, especially given
the extensive staff expansion made to CAPS
last year. We are fighting to protect that ex
pansion. but we also need to think more cre
atively about how to address all aspects of
this crisis.
The VPSA funds allocated for the Well
ness Room are 1/35 of the cost of hiring one

additional full-time psychiatrist. The Well
ness Room is funded by $5,000 from the Of
fice of the Vice Provost of Student Affairs,
while the median salary of a psychiatrist in
the U.S. was $175,461 in 2008. The room ad
dresses a different, hut vitally important part
of the challenge, one which your editorial un
dervalued: campus culture.
The editorial referenced two recommen
dations in the proposal that the hoard feels
the Wellness Room does not address. While
neither are the primary target of this initia
tive, we feel our office is making strides on
each:
"Recommendation 12 calls for expanding
programs and resources to support develop
ment of personal relationships between stu
dents'so that they feel connected and valued
in their communities,'" the board writes.
We believe the room will be traf
ficked by a critical mass of students,
resulting in relationship formation.
The room, the student-volunteer
staff and workshops held within will
certainly help people meet each
other and feel included in the com
munity.
"Recommendation 13 urges en
couraging and affirming diversity
and reaching out to members of the
community whose 'personal back
ground may make them more vul
nerable to isolation and disconnec
tion from their peers and the wider
community,' such as first-generation
college students, members of the
LGBT community or students of
color," the board also notes.
The Daily is aware of our forth
coming Community Center Collab
oration Fund — the entire goal of
which is to increase interaction be
tween diverse groups on campus and
affirm diversity. Additionally, we will
certainly reach out to all groups
across campus and encourage partic
ipation and will encourage interfac
ing this initiative with the Wellness
Room.
Now, the recommendations the
Wellness Room addresses:
Recommendation 1: Ensure

broad and long-term commitment to
understanding, supporting and en
couraging student mental health and
well-being.
This is a visible commitment that
ingrains mental health as a major
area of concern for the ASSU, ensur
ing that focus stays on addressing
this crisis. We're excited for this pilot
to be successful and to become a sus
tained piece of our campus and the
ASSU.
Recommendation 11: Expand the
University's efforts in prevention,
early intervention and risk-reduc
tion in the area of mental health.
Expansion of psychological serv
ices is extremely important, but this
editorial pays too little attention to
prevention.The Wellness staff will be
available to talk through the day-to
day troubles like stress and home
sickness. Student staff will also be
trained to make referrals to the
Bridge or CAPS when and if neces
sary.
By having this resource for stu
dents to learn about and engage in
living a healthier, more relaxed and
balanced life we foresee an outcome
of increased early intervention and
risk-reduction. As Steven Crane '11
of Stanford Peace of Mind noted.
"Sure, CAPS needs more resources
to deal with the load, but maybe the
load wouldn't be so great if people
had more of a chance to de-stress
and take care of their problems be
fore they become pathological in the

first place."
Recommendation 16: Provide op
portunities for students to broaden
their attitudes and expand their
knowledge and skills that support
their mental health and well-being.
This will certainly be a major ele
ment of the room.Trainings that pro
mote wellness are core to the model,
and our team has already spoken
with the Bridge, CAPS, Stanford
Peace of Mind, Mirror, BeWell,
among others to bring more wellness
to our lives with the room as the cat
alyst and the means. We believe the
editorial board grossly underesti
mates the value of meditation and
massage — both quantifiably effec
tive tools for promoting wellness.
We respect the role The Daily
plays on campus, and the usually
constructive pressure placed on the
ASSU. But it is disappointing to read
an editorial denouncing this project
without the data to support these
claims.The 14 applicants we received
for the position of Wellness Room
Coordinator is a clear indication that
people are excited and see the po
tential to have an impact, and we be
lieve the overall well-being of the
student body will benefit from our
efforts on this front and others on
the hori/on.
