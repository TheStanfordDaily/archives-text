## Defending the Wellness Room 
### 
In the Jan. 12 editorial "Wellness Room
only small step in solving mental health
crisis," the editorial board undermines the
significance of small steps forward, overesti
mates the available resources in our time of
economic crisis and picks and chooses quota
tions from the Student Mental Health and
Well-Being Task Force Report, which sup
port the editorial board's view that this is not
an effective intervention.
The Wellness Room is the outcome of nu
merous discussions with members of the task
force, detailed analysis of their report, con
versations with Vaden staff and student
stake-holders and leaders across campus.
Collectively, we have the utmost faith in this
initiative.
The "serious mental health crisis plaguing
our campus" that the board describes is real.
But by describing the Wellness Room as an
"inadequate solution," it is letting great be

the enemy of good. Will this initiative fix the
problem entirely? No, absolutely not. But in
conjunction and coordination with the vari
ety of other effective campus interventions
— Vaden. The Bridge, Stanford Peace of
Mind.etc. — it will help push back this rising
tide of depression. Additionally, this is a
small, first step. This is a two-quarter pilot
program, which will expand should the stu
dents and administration deem it a success.
Ilie University is facing a massive finan
cial challenge. The reality is that many staff
will be let go, and this is a bad year to lobby
for new full-time employees, especially given
the extensive staff expansion made to CAPS
last year. We are fighting to protect that ex
pansion. but we also need to think more cre
atively about how to address all aspects of
this crisis.
The VPSA funds allocated for the Well
ness Room are 1/35 of the cost of hiring one

additional full-time psychiatrist. The Well
ness Room is funded by $5,000 from the Of
fice of the Vice Provost of Student Affairs,
while the median salary of a psychiatrist in
the U.S. was $175,461 in 2008. The room ad
dresses a different, hut vitally important part
of the challenge, one which your editorial un
dervalued: campus culture.
The editorial referenced two recommen
dations in the proposal that the hoard feels
the Wellness Room does not address. While
neither are the primary target of this initia
tive, we feel our office is making strides on
each:
"Recommendation 12 calls for expanding
programs and resources to support develop
ment of personal relationships between stu
dents'so that they feel connected and valued
in their communities,'" the board writes.
