## Axess grinds down to a halt Many students unable to access transcripts over winter break 
### JENNY REMPEL STAFF WRITER 
Axess, the University's online
portal for courses and financial mat
ters. frustrated students at the end of
fall quarter with a series of clashes
and delays.
"We experienced significant per
formance issues during and after
finals week due to the number of
students requesting transcripts," said
Sameer Marella. technical director
of Student, HR and Middleware
Systems, in an email to The Daily.
Marella, who works in
Administrative Systems, said that
during peak times. Axess can receive
over 10.0CK) requests in one day.
leaving the program unable to han
dle student requests in a timely
manner. The problem was compli
cated by the fact that professors
were using the same system to sub
mit grades before approaching
deadlines.
Like a number of students. Elena
Carano '12 experienced repeated
difficulties when trying to view her
unofficial transcript online.
"I tried to load [my transcript],
and it said it would work the next
day," Carano said. "I tried several
days in a row and it never worked."
Carl Case' 11 was similarly dissat
isfied with the sheer amount of time
it took to generate an unofficial
transcript.
"It takes like five minutes, which
is absurd." Case said. "It's a simple
database query, which shouldn't be
that hard."
The program also crashed several

times during finals week and over
winter break, prompting Marella's
department to entirely remove
access to online unofficial tran
scripts for two days while they
worked with Oracle, Stanford's
database managing vendor.
"Since Oracle was unable to pro
vide an adequate solution quickly,
our Application Support team was
able to tune the transcript process
and decrease transcript processing
time from 20 minutes per transcript
to under 20 seconds per transcript,"
Marella said. "We are continuing to
work with Oracle to come up with
additional performance tuning and a
longer-term fix."
But apart from the more recent
delays and problems, students also
complain of larger annoyances with
Axess.
"The whole thing is just horribly
set up." said Matt Wujek '12."It's not
intuitive. It can take some work to
figure out how to do what you want
to get accomplished. They should
just scrap it and set up a new sys
tem."
Hannah Lynch T1 thinks the
process of registering for classes can
be confusing since students have to
either know the exact course num
ber or be willing to scroll through a
long list of possible classes.
"The interface just makes you
want to cry," she said.
Anticipating complaints like
Lvnch's. Marella told The Daily that
the University hopes to soon allow
course registration through the pop
ular Course√üank and iStanford
interfaces.
This would certainly make fresh
man Shahryar Malik happy. His take
on Stanford's online portal? "Axess
cannot be accessed."
