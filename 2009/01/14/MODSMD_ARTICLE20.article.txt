## READY TO RUN Cardinal set to open season at Washington 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA STAFF WRITER 
Hie Stanford men's and women's track and field teams will
return to action this weekend, as both squads feature young,
yet talented and deep teams with some of the top names in
their respective events.
Both the women's and men's teams are coming off a strong
2008 season, finishing second and third, respectively, at the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Championships and fifth
and seventh nationally.
The women's distance medley relay was especially impres
sive, posting a third-place finish with the second-fastest time in
Stanford history. The team consisted of current fifth-year sen
ior Lauren Centrowitz, current seniors Idara Otu and Alicia
Follmar and Arianna Lambie '08.
The men's distance medley relay finished in an impressive
fourth place last season, led off by current fifth-year senior
Hakon DeVries. followed by current sophomore Andrew
Dargie, current senior Jacob Evans and Garrett Heath, who
ended his indoor collegiate season in 2008, but will be return
ing for a final outdoor season with the Cardinal in 2009.
Fortunately for the Cardinal, most of its talented runners
will be returning this season. Aside from Otu. Follmar and
Centrowitz, sophomore Arantxa King will look to hold down
a key spot among the Cardinal's women runners. In addition
to these four, the women boast numerous other top finishers
and talented athletes. While the women will miss two of their
top athletes, two-time National Champion. American junior
record-holder. 12-time All-American and 2008 Olympian
Erica McLain '08 and American record-holder and 14-time
All-American Lambie. they still feature plenty of depth.
The men boast a few veterans with national experience and
All-American titles under their belts, namely DeVries and sen
iors Jacob Evans and Hari Mix. DeVries — one of three men's
team captains — praised the team's depth, citing in particular
the arrival of several talented freshmen, singling out sprinter
Amaechi Morton, miler Dylan Ferris, thrower Geoffrey Tabor
and cross country All-American Chris Derrick. According to
DeVries. all have the chance to "make an immediate impact."
"The team is,overall, younger than previous track and field
teams I've been a member of." he said. "That only makes what
is coming in the next few months more exciting."

GAME NOTES; The Stanford men's and women's track and field teams will kick
off their 2009 seasons this weekend at the UW Indoor Preview. The Cardinal
will compete against athletes from all over the western United States, and
western Canada as well. The teams hope to replicate their success from last
year's UW Indoor Preview, where the women achieved three automatic na
tional marks and one provisional time, while the men achieved four new na

Fellow captain and senior Myles Bradley agreed.

indoor season.
The team itself has also experienced some changes in terms
of the coaching staff, which has proved both challenging and
beneficial for the athletes. Adjusting to new coaching styles
can be difficult, but the captains spoke highly of the new addi
tions to the staff, praising their compatibility with the team.

last year, bringing in three talented additions who all have ad

"The coaching staff has set some lofty goals for both the
men's and women's teams this indoor season," DeVries
