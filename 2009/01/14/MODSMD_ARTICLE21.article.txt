# Off and running in transition
## Stanford men adjusting to Dawkins' style 
### JACOB JOHNSON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford men's basketball returns home this
week after a 0-2 Washington road trip. The
bad news is that the Cardinal has lost three of
its last four and is now 1-3 in Pacific-10 Con
ference play. Only Oregon has a worse Pac-10
conference record at 0-4.
The good news is that last weekend's losses came by
a combined two points. The Stanford men have a
chance to redeem themselves when former Cardinal
head coach Mike Montgomery returns to the Farm at
the helm of the No. 22/23 California Golden Bears this
weekend.
For now, Stanford's Johnny Dawkins seems opti
mistic about his team. The Cardinal's first-year coach
called the Washington games "tough losses," but also
highlighted that his team is making progress.
"We just fell a little short," Dawkins said on Mon
day. adding that it was important for his team "to un
derstand that [it] did more good things [than bad]."

Johnson's offense was centered
around getting the ball to Lopez
[...] Dawkins has his players
running a more up-tempo game

"Of course we're disappointed," he said. Neverthe
less, Dawkins went on to say he was happy with his
team's ability to compete so well in two hostile road
environments."(lt] says a lot about our kids."
The ability to successfully transition to a new coach
also speaks volumes about the Stanford squad, specif
ically its strong senior leadership. Senior and starting
point guard Mitch Johnson has experienced the ups
and downs of the Pac-10 season before. He knows that
his team has dug itself into an early-season hole by los
ing three of its first four Pac-10 contests, but sees no
reason to panic because the season is still young.

Senior Lawrence Hill is the second-leading scorer for the Cardinal with 13.9 points per game. Hill
and his teammates are transitioning to a new style under new head coach Johnny Dawkins.
