# Off and running in transition
## Stanford men adjusting to Dawkins' style 
### JACOB JOHNSON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford men's basketball returns home this
week after a 0-2 Washington road trip. The
bad news is that the Cardinal has lost three of
its last four and is now 1-3 in Pacific-10 Con
ference play. Only Oregon has a worse Pac-10
conference record at 0-4.
The good news is that last weekend's losses came by
a combined two points. The Stanford men have a
chance to redeem themselves when former Cardinal
head coach Mike Montgomery returns to the Farm at
the helm of the No. 22/23 California Golden Bears this
weekend.
For now, Stanford's Johnny Dawkins seems opti
mistic about his team. The Cardinal's first-year coach
called the Washington games "tough losses," but also
highlighted that his team is making progress.
"We just fell a little short," Dawkins said on Mon
day. adding that it was important for his team "to un
derstand that [it] did more good things [than bad]."

Johnson's offense was centered
around getting the ball to Lopez
[...] Dawkins has his players
running a more up-tempo game

"Of course we're disappointed," he said. Neverthe
less, Dawkins went on to say he was happy with his
team's ability to compete so well in two hostile road
environments."(lt] says a lot about our kids."
The ability to successfully transition to a new coach
also speaks volumes about the Stanford squad, specif
ically its strong senior leadership. Senior and starting
point guard Mitch Johnson has experienced the ups
and downs of the Pac-10 season before. He knows that
his team has dug itself into an early-season hole by los
ing three of its first four Pac-10 contests, but sees no
reason to panic because the season is still young.

Senior Lawrence Hill is the second-leading scorer for the Cardinal with 13.9 points per game. Hill
and his teammates are transitioning to a new style under new head coach Johnny Dawkins.
When asked if there was any
added pressure on the Cardinal after
losing in Washington, Johnson said,
"Pressure's not the right word ... We
look at it as a race."
Although Stanford has gotten
out of the blocks slowly, the Cardi
nal's only focus now is trying to keep
pace with the teams ahead of it.
In 2009, this means finding a way
to replace the production of Brook
and Robin Lopez, not to mention
key role players like Fred Washing
ton "08 and Taj Finger '08 who were
so instrumental to Stanford's suc
cess last year. It also means adapting
to a new coach, whose preferred
style of play is much different than
Trent Johnson's, who is now head
coach at LSU.
Where Johnson's offense was
centered around getting the ball to
Brook Lopez in the post, Dawkins
has his players running a more up
tempo game. Last year, more than 40
percent of Stanford's total offense
came from the Lopez brothers
alone. The 2009 Cardinal squad has
made up for that and then some.

scoring six more points per game
(up from 70.1 to 76.1).
This year's team has more play
ers scoring in double figures, as jun
ior Landry Fields and sophomore
Josh Owens have helped fill the
front-court void left by the depar
ture of the twins. Senior Lawrence
Hill has also been instrumental in
the Cardinal's success in 2009. Last
year he averaged 8.6 points and 4.8
rebounds per game; this season, he
is putting up 13.9 points and 6.3
boards. Johnson has been success
ful running the fast new offense,
and senior sharpshooter Anthony
Goods is averaging 17.1 points per
game — up from 10.0 in 2008.
Defensively, Stanford has strug
gled. As one would expect.opposing
offenses are having more success
penetrating and getting to the hoop
without the imposing inside pres
ence of twin 7-footers. Both Brook
and Robin averaged over two blocks
per contest; Owens leads this year's
team with only one per game.
But there are bright spots on the
Cardinal defense. Stanford defend
ers are guarding the ball with more
intensity this season. Last year, op
posing teams attacked Stanford
from the perimeter with consider
able success — not in 2009. Last
year, the Cardinal limited opposing

teams to .349 shooting from the
field, hut gave up an average of 5.3
three pointers per game on .333
shooting. Dawkins' insistence on
tough perimeter defense has limited
opponents in 2009 to just .284
shooting from beyond the arc —
less than four made threes per
game. The only problem is that
Stanford is also allowing opponents
to shoot .464 overall. .115 higher
than in 2008.
Hill thinks that the team's recent
struggles are due to a lack of focus.
"We've done a 180 in some
ways," he said. "We're starting to
relax in things we were doing well."
Overall, the Dawkins era is off to
a promising start. The Stanford men
have shown that they are capable of
transitioning to a new system, and
their coach has done a great job of
utilizing his players' talents. The
Cardinal's recent struggles need to
be remedied soon. But if you listen
to the team's senior leaders, there is
plenty of confidence in the Stanford
locker room. Just ask Hill.
"We still have the opportunity to
be the team we want to be," he said.
For a team looking to rebound,
this is all that can be hoped.

Hill has also been instrumental in
the Cardinal's success in 2009. Last
year he averaged 8.6 points and 4.8
rebounds per game; this season, he
is putting up 13.9 points and 6.3
boards. Johnson has been success
ful running the fast new offense,
and senior sharpshooter Anthony
Goods is averaging 17.1 points per
game — up from 10.0 in 2008.
Defensively, Stanford has strug
gled. As one would expect.opposing
offenses are having more success
penetrating and getting to the hoop
without the imposing inside pres
ence of twin 7-footers. Both Brook
and Robin averaged over two blocks
per contest; Owens leads this year's
team with only one per game.
But there are bright spots on the
Cardinal defense. Stanford defend
ers are guarding the ball with more
intensity this season. Last year, op
posing teams attacked Stanford
from the perimeter with consider
able success — not in 2009. Last
year, the Cardinal limited opposing

teams to .349 shooting from the
field, hut gave up an average of 5.3
three pointers per game on .333
shooting. Dawkins' insistence on
tough perimeter defense has limited
opponents in 2009 to just .284
shooting from beyond the arc —
less than four made threes per
game. The only problem is that
Stanford is also allowing opponents
to shoot .464 overall. .115 higher
than in 2008.
Hill thinks that the team's recent
struggles are due to a lack of focus.
"We've done a 180 in some
ways," he said. "We're starting to
relax in things we were doing well."
Overall, the Dawkins era is off to
a promising start. The Stanford men
have shown that they are capable of
transitioning to a new system, and
their coach has done a great job of
utilizing his players' talents. The
Cardinal's recent struggles need to
be remedied soon. But if you listen
to the team's senior leaders, there is
plenty of confidence in the Stanford
locker room. Just ask Hill.
"We still have the opportunity to
be the team we want to be," he said.
For a team looking to rebound,
this is all that can be hoped.
