### Sam Svoboda 
Its season has yet to begin,
hut the Stanford men's gymnas
ties team is already exactly
where it wants to he: ranked No.
1 in the country.
The Cardinal is the over
whelming top choice in the
Gym Info Coaches' Preseason
Poll. The team received 10 first
place votes, eight more than sec
ond-ranked Oklahoma Universi
ty. No. 3 Ohio State also received
one first-place vote, as did No. 7
California, but it is clear that
Stanford is considered the team
to beat to start the season.
The Cardinal lost four of its
six All-Mountain Pacific Sports
Foundation (MPSF) selections
from last season (including
Olympic Trialist David Sender
'08) but there is still plenty of
talent left to go around. Red
shirt seniors Jason Shen and
Sho Nakamori are the two re
turning All-MPSF gymnasts,
and twelve other athletes from
last year's team are returning as
well.The squad also added four
standout recruits in the fresh
man class: John Martin, Gabriel
Alvarado, Cameron Foreman
and Jordan Nolff. All received
numerous accolades in high
school and are expected to help
the team right away.
As Stanford chases its fourth
national title, it will have to get
the bitter taste of last year's
season out of its mouth. The
Cardinal came into last year's
national championships ranked
No. I in the nation, but was
edged out by No. 2 Oklahoma
by just .450 points.This year, the
men are determined translate
their No. 1 ranking into a na
tional title.
The team begins its season
on Friday with a rivalry
matchup as it faces Cal at
Berkeley. The Cardinal will
then host the Stanford Open on
Jan. 24.
