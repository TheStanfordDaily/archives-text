# Card has to keep Harbaugh
## 
### 
Let this be a memo to Athletic
Director Boh Bowlsby. That
three-year contract extension
for head football coach Jim Har
baugh that you've been talking
about for months? Get it signed.
Now. Not tomorrow, not next week
and definitely not after the Feb. 4
signing day for new recruits, but
right this very minute.
Stanford fans and recruits alike
are growing weary of the rumors
swirling around Harbaugh's future.
His name has been linked to coach
ing vacancies with the Oakland
Raiders and the New York Jets —
the latter of the two he interviewed
for this past Thursday, as reported
by NationalFootballFost.com. a site
which was cofounded by Jack Bech
ta. Harbaugh's agent.
If Harbaugh — the first man to
bring hope to the Stanford football
program since Tyrone Willingham's
departure to Notre Dame after the
2001 season — is allowed to scurry
away from the Farm to the NFL. it
will undoubtedly cause severe back
lash toward Bowlsby. One of the
main reasons Bowlsby was brought
in was to fix a vulnerable football
program that suffered for five years
during the coaching reigns of Buddy
Teevens and Walt Harris.
It would be tough for Bowlsby to
overcome losing Harbaugh after an
already tough year. Beloved former
basketball coach and assistant to the
athletic director Mike Montgomery
was able to bolt from Stanford to the
rival Cal Bears just days before
Trent Johnson left Stanford for FSIJ
because of a similar inability to
agree to a contract extension. Los
ing Johnson, the man who brought
the Lopez twins to the Farm; Mont
gomery. perhaps the most popular
coach at Stanford since Bill Walsh;
and Harbaugh in the same year
might also mean a huge loss of fan
support, not to mention recruit in
terest.
The effects of Harbaugh's linger
ing contract situation can already be
felt in the recruiting world. Wide re
ceiver Jamal Patterson, who has
made a verbal commitment to Stan
ford. told Scout.com last week that
he'd heard rumors that Harbaugh
was leaving and that he is now con
sidering making a visit to Clemson,
just in case the Cardinal's coach
does find his way to the NFL.
Signing day for college football
recruits is less than a month away,
and if Harbaugh hasn't made it clear
he will be back at Stanford next year
and for years to come. Stanford will
risk losing some of the recruits that
have its class ranked 16th in the na
tion by Scout.com. a class that is
shaping up to be Stanford's best re
cruiting class in years by far. The
longer it takes for an extension to
get signed, the less likely it becomes
that undecided recruits considering
Stanford, like Manti Te'o and Jelani
Jenkins (two of the top linebackers
in the country) will come to the
Farm.
Harbaugh has instilled energy
into the student body, which identi
fies him as the man who is turning
Stanford football around. In his first
year as head coach, the Cardinal
beat IJSC and Cal — the first win in
five years over the archrival Golden
Bears. This year, the Cardinal was
one win away from bowl eligibility.
Stanford has a beautiful new stadi
um that fans and students are finally
coming out to. and the effects of
Harbaugh's potential departure on
the psyche of this population cannot
be understated.
We've been hearing for weeks
that this contract extension will be
signed any day, but throughout the
process, Bowlsby and Jack Bechta,
Harbaugh's agent, have not seemed
as if they were on the same page, at
least publicly. As each day passes, it
feels more and more as if I iarbaugh
could actually depart for the NFL.
Harbaugh is being approached
by the Raiders, and their owner Al
Davis has a reputation for making
sure he gets what he wants. It is pub
lic knowledge that Davis is fond of
Harbaugh. and that the feeling is


Daniel
Bohm
mutual, stemming from Harbaugh's
two years as a Raiders assistant ear
lier this decade.
Additionally, with the recent
success of Harbaugh's brother
John, head coach of the Baltimore
Ravens. Jim's popularity and noto
riety is only rising.
Whatever blame can be placed
on Bowlsbv for not finalizing this
contract must also be shared, at
least somewhat, bv Harbaugh him
self. however. It took Harbaugh far
too long to issue a public statement

regarding the rumors in question,
only just last night promising that
he intends to return to Stanford. In
addition. Harbaugh is said to have
interviewed for the Jets job just a
day ahead of 20-plus recruits visit
ing Stanford — not exactly the best
message to be sending athletes try
ing to decide if they should come to
the Farm.
Despite that, the onus is on
Bowlsby to get this deal finalized,
and the repercussions of its failure
would be devastating. So please Mr.
Bowlsby. on behalf of all Stanford
fans, get this extension signed.

Daniel Bohm is nervous. Really nerv
ous. Tell him to relax at bohmd@stan
ford. edit.
