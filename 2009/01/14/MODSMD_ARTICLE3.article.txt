## Gao claims chair, replaces Chapa Deputy chair narrowly beats Ilves in 8-6 vote 
### MARISA LANDICHO STAFF WRITER 
In a pivotal and possibly volatile
Undergraduate Senate meeting, the
ASSU body selected Senator
Shelley (iao 'II to fill the recently
vacated senate chair seat. But the
final moments showed the senators
more disgruntled with the negative
perceptions of the ASSU rather
than the transition of office.
After a generally courteous
question-and-answer session, Gao
defeated Senator Luukas lives '09
in an 8-6 vote for the chair.
Previous Senate Chair Tiq Chapa
'09 stepped down at the end of last
quarter, leaving the Senate leader
less just as budget issues came to a
head.
Over the past five weeks, the sen
ators have been debating the selec
tion of a new chair, and with no
clear succession plan in the bylaws
or constitution, senators disagreed

on how to handle the unprecedent
ed situation.
The Senate agreed to hold the
voting process under the same
guidelines as the election in spring.
Candidates were nominated from
the Senate, and an anonymous vote
selected the winner.
ASSU Vice President Pagan
Harris '09 acted in place of chair
and directed last night's meeting.
Portentously, the elections both
opened and closed with scorn for
the ineffectual image of the ASSU.
"Whatever this body decides,
please let's avoid the political and
do what's in the best interest of the
student body," Harris said prior to
the nominations. He stressed stu
dent perceptions and the need for
unity and maturity in the election.
Throughout nominations and
questioning, senators mentioned
the exaggerations and bias in the
coverage of previous Senate meet
ings. lives particularly critiqued cov
erage of the funding debates over
the Welcome Back BBQ and T-shirt
controversies.
"Damn public perception," lives
exclaimed during a passionate
response. "We won't always look
good, people won't always get it.
hut we do what we have to do."
lives praised previous budget
discussions and ran with the goals
of continuing policy debates and
strong leadership through the
budget cut process, lie also called
lor a clarification of smaller house
keeping items such as senate seat
ing arrangements, nameplates and
formal titles.
Gao. who has served as deputy
chair under Chapa since spring,
originally declined the nomination
by Senator Jonathan McMaster Ml.
"I've actually decided that I can
implement a lot of the changes I
want as deputy chair, so I decline
the nomination of chair," Gao
announced to a shocked Senate.
Ten minutes later, she changed
her mind and accepted the second
call for nomination.
Gao questioned lives' time com
mitment as a senior and pointed to
her experience working under
Chapa.
Harris brought the heaviest crit
icism of both candidates, question
ing lives' partisan ideology and
Gao's ability to accomplish con
crete tasks. But the rest of the body
was mostly complimentary to Gao.
who won the seat K-6.
Senator Patrick Cordova '09 ran
unopposed for deputy chair and
won handily with 12 votes and two
abstentions.
The main thread of the election,
however, remained the negative
portrayal of the ASSIJ. Alter the
votes were counted, cabinet mem
ber Andy l.omeli '09 commended
the Senate's actions and disparaged
"various news outlets."
"It's easy to get lost in what's
reported and what's disseminated
to the public." he said. "Despite
what is said in various news outlets,
your actions will speak louder than
what any person will say on your
work."
lives agreed and said their
recognition would come in due
time. Senators were generally
unhappy with the focus of past
media coverage on solely disagree
ments and controversy.

Still, the senators mentioned at
various times the need for more
transparency.
Notably. Cordova received com
plaints from students about the
selection of a replacement senior
class co-president, which was done
without a vote by the actual senior
class.
Several senators urged for
increased transparency through an
up-to-date Web site and posted
committee minutes.
While the election occurred
peacefully, the body itself showed
other signs of strain. Internal divi
sions seemed to be increasing as
calls for politeness and maturity
were repeated.
Senator Stephanie Chan Ml
began the meeting with a public
apology to Senator Stuart Baimel
'09 for impropriety in an email.
The email, which personally
attacked and rebuked Baimel. was
originally only sent to the
Appropriations Committee and
later forwarded to the entire sen
ate list by lives.
Senator Orr Keshet '09 also bit
terly criticized the conduct of the
Appropriations Committee.
Keshet, a member of the committee
co-chaired by Chan and Senator
Stephanie F.pps '10. claimed his
emails were never responded to.
"I feel like my input has been
silenced." Keshet said. "Things are
obviously not being resolved in the
Appropriations Committee."
The senators on the committee
agreed to discuss the matter in their
next meeting.
Chan then raised a complaint on
possible information leaks in the
Senate.
"When our former chair
announced his resignation, he said
that he didn't want it publicized for
a few days." she said. "1 was disap
pointed to see it in The Daily the
next day."
lives and Gao. who were both
quoted in the article, defended their
actions by claiming they were con
tacted after Chapa already granted
an interview with The Daily.
Other items on the agenda
included a call for more oversight in
new construction projects — such
as following investments from pri
vate donors and the expansion of
Crothers — and a resolution to
remember the late Thorn Massev.

The main thread of the election,
however, remained the negative
portrayal of the ASSIJ. Alter the
votes were counted, cabinet mem
ber Andy l.omeli '09 commended
the Senate's actions and disparaged
"various news outlets."
"It's easy to get lost in what's
reported and what's disseminated
to the public." he said. "Despite
what is said in various news outlets,
your actions will speak louder than
what any person will say on your
work."
lives agreed and said their
recognition would come in due
time. Senators were generally
unhappy with the focus of past
media coverage on solely disagree
ments and controversy.

Still, the senators mentioned at
various times the need for more
transparency.
Notably. Cordova received com
plaints from students about the
selection of a replacement senior
class co-president, which was done
without a vote by the actual senior
class.
Several senators urged for
increased transparency through an
up-to-date Web site and posted
committee minutes.
While the election occurred
peacefully, the body itself showed
other signs of strain. Internal divi
sions seemed to be increasing as
calls for politeness and maturity
were repeated.
Senator Stephanie Chan Ml
began the meeting with a public
apology to Senator Stuart Baimel
'09 for impropriety in an email.
The email, which personally
attacked and rebuked Baimel. was
originally only sent to the
Appropriations Committee and
later forwarded to the entire sen
ate list by lives.
Senator Orr Keshet '09 also bit
terly criticized the conduct of the
Appropriations Committee.
Keshet, a member of the committee
co-chaired by Chan and Senator
Stephanie F.pps '10. claimed his
emails were never responded to.
"I feel like my input has been
silenced." Keshet said. "Things are
obviously not being resolved in the
Appropriations Committee."
The senators on the committee
agreed to discuss the matter in their
next meeting.
Chan then raised a complaint on
possible information leaks in the
Senate.
"When our former chair
announced his resignation, he said
that he didn't want it publicized for
a few days." she said. "1 was disap
pointed to see it in The Daily the
next day."
lives and Gao. who were both
quoted in the article, defended their
actions by claiming they were con
tacted after Chapa already granted
an interview with The Daily.
Other items on the agenda
included a call for more oversight in
new construction projects — such
as following investments from pri
vate donors and the expansion of
Crothers — and a resolution to
remember the late Thorn Massev.
