## Gao claims chair, replaces Chapa Deputy chair narrowly beats Ilves in 8-6 vote 
### MARISA LANDICHO STAFF WRITER 
In a pivotal and possibly volatile
Undergraduate Senate meeting, the
ASSU body selected Senator
Shelley (iao 'II to fill the recently
vacated senate chair seat. But the
final moments showed the senators
more disgruntled with the negative
perceptions of the ASSU rather
than the transition of office.
After a generally courteous
question-and-answer session, Gao
defeated Senator Luukas lives '09
in an 8-6 vote for the chair.
Previous Senate Chair Tiq Chapa
'09 stepped down at the end of last
quarter, leaving the Senate leader
less just as budget issues came to a
head.
Over the past five weeks, the sen
ators have been debating the selec
tion of a new chair, and with no
clear succession plan in the bylaws
or constitution, senators disagreed

on how to handle the unprecedent
ed situation.
The Senate agreed to hold the
voting process under the same
guidelines as the election in spring.
Candidates were nominated from
the Senate, and an anonymous vote
selected the winner.
ASSU Vice President Pagan
Harris '09 acted in place of chair
and directed last night's meeting.
Portentously, the elections both
opened and closed with scorn for
the ineffectual image of the ASSU.
"Whatever this body decides,
please let's avoid the political and
do what's in the best interest of the
student body," Harris said prior to
the nominations. He stressed stu
dent perceptions and the need for
unity and maturity in the election.
Throughout nominations and
questioning, senators mentioned
the exaggerations and bias in the
coverage of previous Senate meet
ings. lives particularly critiqued cov
erage of the funding debates over
the Welcome Back BBQ and T-shirt
controversies.
