## Registrar faces GPA rounding errors 
### LIZ STARK STAFF WRITER 
The Office of the University
Registrar has confirmed that stu
dent grade point averages (GPAs)
reported on Axess and unofficial
transcripts for the summer and
fall quarters were incorrectly
rounded up from the thousandths
place due to software faults.
"The method that was used for
calculating GPAs for active stu
dents in summer and fall terms
does not agree with the method
previously in use," said University
Registrar Thomas Black in an
email to The Daily. "When we
moved to the latest version of the
student information software in
mid-August, the setup for the
GPA calculation was incorrect."
This incorrect setup rounded
up from the thousandths place to
the nearest tenth, though signifi
cant figures for the GPA
remained in the thousandths
place.
For instance, sophomore
Michael I lammersley's unofficial
transcript reports that his GPA is

3.SIM). But manual calculation by
University methods reveals a
CiPA of 3.797.
Hammersley didn't make too
much of the error.
"It's a bit weird that, if they
have the three final digits to the
thousandths place, it would be
rounded like that." Hammersley
said. "But that said, the difference
for me was three thousandths, and
in that scheme of things, it doesn't
make too much of a difference."
Black said the software has
been fixed and returned to its
original format.
"With respect to those who are
affected now. we will correct the
records as soon as possible." he
added. "I don't have a date as of
yet."
Still, the difference in GPA
remained inconsequential for
some. Upon learning that her
(i PA was rounded from 3.445 to
3.450, Ifessa Fompa '12 said this
was the first time she had even
looked at her (iPA.
"At my high school, we never
knew our (iPAs," Pompa said.
"Letter grades themselves are
more universally understood than
the (IPA. which varies so much in
calculation from school to
school."
"I don't think [the rounding]
matters all that much." added Ali
McKinney '12, whose GPA was
rounded from 3.908 to 3.91 on
Axess. "In a job application situa
tion. most people would round their
GPAs up to the tenths place any
way."
Other students interviewed were
generally surprised hy the situation
and confused as to how it came
about.
"Whether the rounding is signifi
cant or not. there's something to be
said for the fact that this went unno
ticed for several months and has yet
to be corrected." Pompa said.
