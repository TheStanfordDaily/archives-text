# Seniors regain Pub privileges
## More sober monitors in place on trips; seniors given another chance 
### DAN HUANG 
Senior Night, more commonly referred to as
Pub Night, will resume tomorrow night despite its
sudden suspension during fall quarter for alcohol
related incidents.
The decade-old Stanford tradition was put on
hold last quarter following several hospitalizations
and fines incurred for vomiting on buses. Since
then, the senior class presidents have met with
university officials to develop new guidelines in
order to make future Senior Nights safer and
cleaner.
According to Associate Dean and Director of
Student Activities Nanci Howe.
the underlying cause of the fall incidents was a
small number of people who made poor decisions
with respect to alcohol.
"'flie emphasis is on a fairly small group of
people." she said. "Some of the problems that have
occurred are that we have had to take people to
the hospital, and the bus companies are almost at
the point of refusing Stanford University students
[transportation] services at all."
Senior class presidents Johnny McCormick "09
and Dimitar Iliev "09 sat down with The Daily yes
terday to discuss changes in policy for winter quar-

ter Senior Nights. According
to the two presidents, old rules
will still be in place and more
actively enforced.
In an email to the senior
class yesterday, McCormick
reminded seniors that overly
intoxicated people will not he
allowed on the buses, and that
vomiting on a bus carries a
$500 line. In addition, new

measures will be put in place.
such as improving the effectiveness of sober mon
itors on trips.
"We're going to have more sober monitors for
[longer] trips." McCormick said. "And we'll have a
bigger presence on the buses."
Although the Senior Night policy was changed
slightly, the senior class presidents and Howe
agree that the largest changes will come from the
senior class itself.
"People are expecting more from each other,"
McCormick said."and people will hold each other
more accountable w hen they are out of line."
McCormick stressed this in yesterday's email,
noting to seniors the increased scrutiny of the
University.

"The events and behavior that
went down last quarter have left us
with little wiggle room moving for
ward." he wrote. "The University
heavily subsidizes Senior Nights,
and in light of budgetary pressures,
our class needs to send the signal
that their money is being well
spent."
As an adviser to the senior class

presidents. F lowe believes the Class of 2(H)9
will step up to what could otherwise become
a blemish on the senior class and Stanford at

large.
"I don't think the senior class wants to have an
event that poorly represents Stanford off-cam
pus." she said. "If we can get [students] that are
behaving responsibly to encourage their peers to
be appropriate and safe, we feel we'll be fine."
lliev was also optimistic that seniors will step
back in line.
"It seems that we are all on the same page
now." he said. "That's a good feeling to have, and
we have a good feeling about our class going into
this quarter."
Thursday's Senior Night will be at Illusions on
California Ave.
