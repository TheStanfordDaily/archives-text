## Harbaugh commits to Stanford Harbaugh issues statement to quell NFL rumors 
### Sam Svoboda Denis Griffin 
After nearly a week of rampant specula
tion regarding the coaching future of
Stanford football's Jim Harbaugh. the
Cardinal head coach issued an official state
ment through Stanford Athletics' official Web
site. GoStanford.com:
"1 would like to unequivocally state that 1
am 100 percent committed to Stanford and I
look forward to leading this football program
for years to come." Harbaugh said.
"Due to the complete physical and emo
tional investment that has been made by
everyone associated with our program. I
believe we are building a program that will
contend for the Pac-10 championship.
"1 have no desire to coach anywhere
besides Stanford at this time." Harbaugh con
cluded.
Rumors largely centered around a report
posted on NationalFootballPost.com last
Friday that alleged Harbaugh met with New
York Jets officials regarding their vacant head
coaching position the day before. The story
was reported by Michael Lombardi.a former
Raiders executive and founder of the site.
Lombardi's cofounder. Jack Bechta. is
Harbaugh's agent.
Harbaugh has plenty of roots in the NFL
as a former quarterback for the Chicago
Bears. Indianapolis Colts. Baltimore Ravens
and San Diego Chargers. Harbaugh's brother.
John, is a first-year head coach with the
Ravens and has led his team to the AFC
Championship game, to be played this
Sunday.
Harbaugh has vet to sign a three-year
extension with Stanford that would keep him
under contract for the next six years with the
University and reportedly pay him an aver
age of $1.2 million per year.
College coaching contracts, however, are
rarely enforced as a means of keeping a coach
at a particular institution, as coaches annually
migrate from lower- to higher-profile college
jobs and the NFL with little repercussions.
Indeed. Boston College recently made head
lines for firing head coach Jeff Jagodzinski
after he interviewed with the Jets in a rare
move to enforce the contract he was under
with the university.
Harbaugh has compiled a 9-15 record with
Stanford since taking over following a disas
trous 1-11 campaign in 2()(>h. His tenure
includes notable wins over arch-rival
California and USC in 2(H)7. and he is report
edly close to hauling in one of the highest
ranked Cardinal recruiting classes in decades
this offseason.
