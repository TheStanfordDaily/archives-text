## Israeli forces storm Gaza City neighborhood 
### IBRAHIM BARZAK CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip â€” Terrified resi
dents ran for cover Tuesday in a densely pop
ulated neighborhood of Gaza City as Israeli
troops backed by tanks thrust deeper into the
city and sought Hamas fighters in alleyways
and cellars.
On the diplomatic front, Egyptian media
tors pushed Hamas to accept a truce propos
al and, in a hopeful sign, Israel sent its lead
negotiator to Cairo for "decisive" talks on a
cease-fire. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki
moon also headed for the region to join
diplomatic efforts.
Israeli military officials say that depend
ing on what happens with what they de
scribed as "decisive" talks in Cairo, Israel will
move closer to a cease-fire or widen its offen
sive. They spoke on condition of anonymity
because they were discussing sensitive policy
matters.
Asked if Israel's war aims had been
achieved, Israeli Defense Minister Ehud
Barak said: "Most of them, probably not all
of them,"
Israeli troops now have the coastal city of
400,000 virtually surrounded as part of an of
fensive launched Dec. 27 to end years of
Palestinian rocket attacks on its southern
towns.
Early Wednesday an Israeli warplane
fired a missile at the former Gaza city hall,
used as a court building in recent years, wit
nesses said.The 1910 structure was destroyed
and many stores in the market around it were
badly damaged, they said.
Palestinian medical officials reported at
least 42 deaths from the conflict on Tuesday
throughout Gaza.
The Israeli military said three soldiers
were wounded, including an officer who was
searching a northern Gaza house when a
bomb exploded.
Palestinian hospital officials say more
than 940 Palestinians, half of them civilians,
have been killed in the fighting. A total of 13
Israelis, 10 of them soldiers, have died.
Palestinian rocket fire has dropped signif
icantly since the offensive was launched.
Some 15 rockets and mortar shells were fired
toward Israel Tuesday, causing no injuries,
the army said.
Fireballs and smoke plumes from Israeli
bombing have become a common sight in the

territory of 1.4 million people, who are effec
tively trapped because of blockaded border
crossings. Recent fighting has focused on
Gaza City, where Israeli soldiers could be in
creasingly exposed to the treacherous condi
tions of urban warfare.
The operation in Tel Hawwa neighbor
hood. one mile (1.5 kilometers) southeast of
downtown, matched fast-paced forays into
other areas designed to avoid Israeli casual
ties. Residents said troops entered overnight,
reconnoitered the area,and then pulled back
to more secure positions.
One Israeli military officer told The Asso-

dated Press that Hamas lighters often oper
ate in small groups of up to four and have
largely refrained from confronting Israeli
troops at close range.
"Their strategy has mainly been to use
lots of booby-traps, shooting guns and mis
siles from afar," the Israeli officer said on
condition of anonymity because he was not
authorized to speak to the media.
"Soldiers are taking lots of precautions,
they are being more careful than the army
has ever been before in any war," he said.
"Soldiers shoot at anything suspicious, use
lots of firepower, and blast holes through

walls to move around."
Gabi Ashkenazi, chief of staff of the Is
raeli military,said Hamas militants also have
put on Israeli military uniforms to try to ap
proach troops and carry out suicide bomb
ings.
Ahead of the U.N. chiefs arrival. Israeli
U.N. Ambassador Gabriela Shalev wrote him
a letter charging that Hamas is "deliberately
endangering civilians" in Gaza. She claimed
that Hamas operates a command center
under Shifa Hospital, Gaza's largest,and mil
itants "routinely fire from inside the houses
of civilians who are held as hostages, prevent-

Ed by Hamas from leaving."
Hamas, which is hacked by Iran, cannot
hope to score a battlefield victory over the
powerful Israeli military, but mere survival
could earn it political capital in the Arab
world as a symbol of resistance to the Jewish
state. Lebanon's Hezbollah, another Iran
backed group, largely achieved that goal in
its 2006 war with Israel.
On Tuesday, a Gaza resident said he saw
Hamas militants in civilian clothing firing
rockets from the southeastern corner of the
territory. He spoke by telephone and re
quested anonymity because of the sensitivity
of the information.
Israel says it will push forward with the of
fensive until Hamas ends all rocket fire on
southern Israel, and there are guarantees the
militant group will stop smuggling weapons
into Gaza through the porous Egyptian bor
der.
Hamas has said it will only observe a
cease-fire if Israel withdraws from Gaza.
"We will not allow our enemy to gain any
political achievement from this war on
Gaza," said Salah Bardawil, a Hamas envoy
in Egypt.
Much of the ongoing diplomacy focuses
on an area of southern Gaza just across the
Egyptian border that serves as a weapons
smuggling route, making Egypt critical to
both sides in any deal.
Israel wants smuggling tunnels along the
border sealed and monitored as part of any
deal, and has bombed suspected tunnel sites
throughout its campaign.
One resident. Khader Mussa.said he fled
his house while waving a white Hag as Israeli
forces advanced. He spent the night huddling
in the basement of a relative with 25 other
people, including his pregnant wife and his
parents.
"Thank God we survived this time and got
out alive from here. But we don't know how
long we'll be safe in my brother's home,"
Mussa,3s,said by telephone.
The Israeli military said it carried out
dozens of airstrikes on squads of gunmen,
rocket launching sites and smuggling tunnels
along the Egyptian border.
The Gaza fighting has raised tensions
around the region and galvanized anger to
ward Israel throuizhout the Arab world.
