# Clinton vows to revitalize U.S. diplomacy

### ROBERT BURNS ANNE FLAHERTY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHINGTON — Hillary Rodham Clinton said
Tuesday that she intends to revitalize the mission
of diplomacy in American foreign policy, calling
for a "smart power" strategy in the Middle East
and implicitly criticizing the Bush administration
for having downgraded the role of arms control.
At a daylong confirmation hearing before the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, President
elect Barack Obama's choice for secretary of state
sailed smoothly through an array of non-con
tentious questions until two Republican commit
tee members pressed her to take additional steps
to ensure that former President Bill Clinton's
global fundraising work does not pose even an ap
pearance of conflict with her role as the chief U.S.
diplomat. She balked, saying disclosure rules al
ready in place were carefully crafted and adequate
to avoid any conflict.
Clinton appeared headed for easy confirma
tion. She encountered no challenges to her basic
vision for foreign policy.
Clinton, who will relinquish her seat in the Sen
ate when confirmed, spoke confidently of
Obama's intentions to renew American leader
ship in the world and to strengthen U.S. diplomacy.
"America cannot solve the most pressing prob
lems on our own, and the world cannot solve them
without America," she said, her daughter Chelsea
seated behind her in the audience. "The best way
to advance America's interest in reducing global
threats and seizing global opportunities is to de
sign and implement global solutions. This isn't a
philosophical point. This is our reality."
In laying out a general outlook for American
foreign policy under Obama, Clinton spoke in a
clear, unhurried voice and looked at ease. She
made it plain,citing policy themes that were famil
iar from Obama's presidential campaign — and in
many cases her own — that the incoming Democ
ratic administration wants to elevate the role of
diplomacy. She and Obama contend that the Bush
administration relied too heavily on the military to
carry out foreign policy and that it leaned too
much on ideology and too little on pragmatism.
The Foreign Relations Committee planned to
vote on Clinton's nomination on Thursday. If it ap
proves her,she could gain full Senate confirmation
as early as Inauguration Day.
The Foreign Relations committee's top Repub
lican. Sen. Richard Lugar, praised Clinton, calling
her "the epitome of a big leaguer" whose presence
could open new opportunities for American diplo

macy.
But Lugar also raised questions about the issue
of Bill Clinton's fundraising work and its relation
to her wife's new post. Lugar said that the only way
for Clinton to avoid a potential conflict of interest
due to her husband's charity is to forswear any
new foreign contributions. The Indiana senator
said the situation poses a "unique complication"
that requires,"great care and transparency."
Before the hearing, Lugar made four sugges
tions to Hillary Clinton's staff on how to improve
transparency in her husband's charitable fundrais
ing, said the senator's spokesman, Andy Fisher.
But in her testimony, Hillary Clinton made
clear that the Obama administration would accept
only one of the proposals — that the foundation
provide a clear picture of its annual donations.
Fisher said.
Lugar also wanted the foundation to immedi
ately disclose donations of $S().(HH) or more; alert
ethics officials when such sizable donations are
pledged; and apply the same stringent require
ments to foreign businesses.The current plan only
subjects foreign governments to scrutiny by State
Department ethics officials and would not require

a review of contributions by foreign businesses —
a loophole that could easily be exploited, Lugar
warned.
She also was pressed by Sen. David Vitter, R-
La.. who said the Clinton fundraising posed "real
and perceived conflict issues" for his wife.
Few others on the committee pursued the con
flict-of-interest issue and it did not appear to be a
likely impediment to her confirmation.
In discussing the problem of peacemaking in
the Middle East, Clinton referred to her husband's
extensive, though ultimately unsuccessful, efforts
to strike a comprehensive peace deal.
"As intractable as the Middle East's problems
may seem and many presidents, including my hus
band. have spent years trying to help work out a
resolution, we cannot give up on peace," she said.
"We must also actively pursue a strategy of
smart power in the Middle East that addresses the
security needs of Israel and the legitimate political
and economic aspirations of the Palestinians." she
said.
