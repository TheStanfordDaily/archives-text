## Editorial Admission office right to stand against Score Choice 
### 
Getting into college is no longer as sim
ple as filling out an application. Many
students feel that they must feed into
the multi-million dollar test prep industry if
they are to receive an acceptance letter from
their dream school. Stanford alone cannot
turn the tide against the college application
frenzy, but it has taken a small step bv reject
ing College Board's new Score Choice pro
gram for the SAT (see "Stanford rejects new
SAT Score Choice program" in the Jan. 7
issue of The Daily).
The editorial board applauds the Office
of Undergraduate Admission's decision to
require all SAT scores from students. Tradi
tionally, all SAT scores are sent by College
Board to colleges, but with Score Choice, uni
versities will only see students' highest
scores. We agree with Stanford that taking a
stand against Score Choice is a way of pre
venting students from trying to game the col
lege admission system.
While College Board argues that Score
Choice will help assuage students' anxieties
about having a bad SAT score appear on
their records, we believe it will only con
tribute to the anxiety of high school students
nationwide. Students likely will feel in
creased pressure to retake the test numerous
times and improve their scores as much as
possible and this will by no means be a stress
free process.
Such behavior contributes to a culture in
which students focus on gaming tests to get
into college, not on their genuine interests. A
student who scored 1430 and 1450 on two
versions of the SAT under the old system
may have accepted that a college would real
ize this was how he or she generally scored.
But with Score Choice, that student may take
the test a dozen times until he or she finally
gets over a 1500. Meaningful extracurricular
pursuits are suddenly replaced by countless
hours of testing and test preparation.
We also agree with Stanford that Score
Choice provides an advantage to wealthier
students, who can afford to take the test more
than one or two times. College Board coun
ters that low-income students can apply for
fee waivers. But students who did not grow
up in a world where families spend thou
sands of dollars on test preparation and test
ing are less likely than wealthy students to
put themselves through the trouble. Rural

students, furthermore, are unlikely to take
advantage of taking the SAT multiple times
if testing sites are inconveniently located.
Most importantly, well-off students have
more resources to prepare for the SAT and
improve their scores. An upper-middle-class
student has the opportunity to improve a se
ries of low scores with expensive test prepa
ration, while a low-income student does not.
With Score Choice, the disparity between
these groups — and even between well-off
families who are willing to shell out test
preparation funds and those who aren't —
will be exacerbated.
College Board, ironically, had a similar
policy to Score Choice between 1993 and
2002 for the SAT Subject Tests, according to
The New York l imes. When this practice was
discontinued, the organization cited the
complexity of releasing scores and unfair
ness to low-income students for ending the
program. We expect the same problems to
persist.
Score Choice not only contributes to text
anxiety and economic disparities, but also to
an unhealthy culture in which students de
mand perfection of themselves. College
Board argues that Score Choice helps out
students who may have a bad test day. Uni
versities. however, are likely to disregard
fluke low scores even without Score Choice.
College Board is instead sending the mes
sage to students that minor slip-ups are
something we should hide if at all possible.
There is no Score Choice for life. We can
not remove bad grades from our transcripts,
take back harsh words or hide mistakes on
the job. High school students taking part in
the anxiety-inducing test-prep culture need
to accept that a small failure is not the end of
the world. Otherwise, students go through
life thinking they need to game the SA T into
an elite college,then game their way into per
fect grades, a top graduate school and the
perfect job. The cycle only ends with disap
pointment. So many of us need to learn that
it's okay to make mistakes.
We're proud that Stanford has taken a
stand against this anxiety-feeding culture.
Now all we can do is wait and hope that the
stressed-out high school students excessively
worrying about improving their SAT score
just one more time will see the value in Stan
ford's message.
