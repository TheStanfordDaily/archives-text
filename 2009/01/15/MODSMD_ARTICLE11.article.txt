# The 						Economics Of
## The 						economics of 2009 
### 
Last week I wrote about the five most
important economic events of 2008.
This week. I have selected the five eco
nomic events that I think will he most inter
esting and relevant in the upcoming year.
I lore they are (in no particular order):
1. Auto Industry Survival
The auto industry finally got the govern
ment bailout it was so desperately seeking.
They now have enough cash to keep them
afloat until, would you believe it. March.
Maybe April, if we were being generous.
The big question is: What happens next?
The littler questions are: Will the United
Auto Workers union make the concessions
that automakers ask? Will automakers final
ly revamp their fleets and start making
smaller, more fuel-efficient cars? Will the
quality of cars made in Detroit match those
of their foreign competitors? Will someone
actually buy a Chevrolet Impala instead of a
Toyota Camry? What if I told you you'd get
zero percent APR financing on the Impala?
And a free upgrade to leather seats — it's
the post-holiday season's biggest blow-out
sale!
2. TARP Round II
Round I of this fight was dominated by
the financial crisis.Treasury Secretary Hank
Paulson went into his corner bloodied from
another wave of massive write-downs and
bruised from the continued deterioration of
credit markets. In fact, things have become
st> bad in that corner that they're sending out
someone new for the next round.
Round II will involve new Treasury Sec
retary Timothy Geithner vs. Hie Financial
Crisis. Geithner will be armed with the re
maining $350 billion of TARP money while
The Financial Crisis will charge out of its
corner with abysmal consumer spending,
continued weakness in housing and in
creased defaults on bank loan portfolios.
It will be interesting to see what (ieithner
does with the TARP funds. Paulson's strate
gy of blindly injecting capital into the coun
try's largest banks has proven largely unsuc
cessful. Banks have hoarded the majority of
this capital because they've been uncertain

of future credit conditions. As a result, bank
lending remains scarce and credits markets
frozen.
A better solution involves getting regula
tors to force write-downs on banks before
in jecting capital.This would stop banks from
hoarding cash against future write-downs
and get them to start lending to each other,
in turn thawing the credit markets back into
action.
3. Russia-Ukraine Dispute
Just when things looked like they were
going to be resolved. Russia and the Ukraine
started pointing fingers at each other again.
This time, Russia claimed that the Ukraine
didn't send the appropriate paperwork to
recommence gas pumping.
Seriously? I can't believe that a disrup
tion of this magnitude is being prolonged by
the absence of paperwork. Paperwork! And
you thought the I)MV was a bureaucratic
organization.
Silliness aside, this spat is likely to have
grave geopolitical consequences. Russia
could very well take military action against
the Ukraine, exacerbating the instability in
political relations among Eastern bloc
states. Fearing such instability and the in
evitable disruption of natural gas. Europe
will begin looking for new sources in the
near future. One possibility is increasing the
use of liquefied natural gas, which can be
procured from more reliable sources in the
Middle East and Southeast Asia.
4. Frugal China
Chinese consumers' unwillingness to
spend has been generally lauded, llieir high
savings have allowed for greater levels of in
vestment and fueled China's export-driven

growth over the past 20 years.
But with global growth as weak as
it is and the mighty Chinese econo
my finally faltering, the world (and
China) are hoping Chinese con
sumers will at last abandon their
miserly ways. Increased consump
tion in China will prevent the Chi
nese economy from going the way of
Western economies by boosting do
mestic production. It will also give a
boost to foreign production, since
more spending by Chinese con
sumers will likely mean more spend
ing on foreign goods.
The hope is that this boost in for
eign production will prevent global
growth from falling too precipitous
ly and prop up the faltering
economies of the U.S. and Europe. It
would also be the first step in cor
recting the massive trade deficits
that the U.S. and. to some extent, the
EU have run up against China in

years gone by.
5. US Fiscal Deficit
In just three months of the cur
rent budget year, the federal govern
ment has amassed the largest fiscal
deficit ever: $485.2 billion. The Trea
sury Department estimates a $1.2
trillion deficit for the entire year —
without accounting for President
elect Obama's proposed $800 billion
stimulus package. That means we
could be looking at a fiscal deficit of
$2 trillion.
The possibility of a $2 trillion
deficit, quite obviously, raises a few
questions. First among these is
whether the US government can
continue borrowing to finance this
deficit?
On the one hand, the global na
ture of the financial crisis has caused
panicked investors to flock to the
safest of securities — U.S. treasuries.
This has allowed the Treasury to
issue copious amounts of new debt at
very attractive borrowing rates. With
the financial crisis showing few signs
of letting up, there is nothing to stop
the U.S. government from continu

ing to pile on the debt.
On the other hand, the U.S. gov
ernment's high levels of borrowing
coupled with economic instability
have caused many to question the
sacrosanctity of U.S. treasuries. In
fact, there is quite an active market
for investors to bet on the U.S. gov
ernment defaulting. At the moment,
that market thinks that a U.S. gov
ernment default is more likely than a
German default.

hoarding cash against future write-downs
and get them to start lending to each other,
in turn thawing the credit markets back into
action.
3. Russia-Ukraine Dispute
Just when things looked like they were
going to be resolved. Russia and the Ukraine
started pointing fingers at each other again.
This time, Russia claimed that the Ukraine
didn't send the appropriate paperwork to
recommence gas pumping.
Seriously? I can't believe that a disrup
tion of this magnitude is being prolonged by
the absence of paperwork. Paperwork! And
you thought the I)MV was a bureaucratic
organization.
Silliness aside, this spat is likely to have
grave geopolitical consequences. Russia
could very well take military action against
the Ukraine, exacerbating the instability in
political relations among Eastern bloc
states. Fearing such instability and the in
evitable disruption of natural gas. Europe
will begin looking for new sources in the
near future. One possibility is increasing the
use of liquefied natural gas, which can be
procured from more reliable sources in the
Middle East and Southeast Asia.
4. Frugal China

growth over the past 20 years.
But with global growth as weak as
it is and the mighty Chinese econo
my finally faltering, the world (and
China) are hoping Chinese con
sumers will at last abandon their
miserly ways. Increased consump
tion in China will prevent the Chi
nese economy from going the way of
Western economies by boosting do
mestic production. It will also give a
boost to foreign production, since
more spending by Chinese con
sumers will likely mean more spend
ing on foreign goods.
The hope is that this boost in for
eign production will prevent global
growth from falling too precipitous
ly and prop up the faltering
economies of the U.S. and Europe. It
would also be the first step in cor
recting the massive trade deficits
that the U.S. and. to some extent, the
EU have run up against China in

years gone by.
5. US Fiscal Deficit
In just three months of the cur
rent budget year, the federal govern
ment has amassed the largest fiscal
deficit ever: $485.2 billion. The Trea
sury Department estimates a $1.2
trillion deficit for the entire year —
without accounting for President
elect Obama's proposed $800 billion
stimulus package. That means we
could be looking at a fiscal deficit of
$2 trillion.
The possibility of a $2 trillion
deficit, quite obviously, raises a few
questions. First among these is
whether the US government can
continue borrowing to finance this
deficit?
On the one hand, the global na
ture of the financial crisis has caused
panicked investors to flock to the
safest of securities — U.S. treasuries.
This has allowed the Treasury to
issue copious amounts of new debt at
very attractive borrowing rates. With
the financial crisis showing few signs
of letting up, there is nothing to stop
the U.S. government from continu

ing to pile on the debt.
On the other hand, the U.S. gov
ernment's high levels of borrowing
coupled with economic instability
have caused many to question the
sacrosanctity of U.S. treasuries. In
fact, there is quite an active market
for investors to bet on the U.S. gov
ernment defaulting. At the moment,
that market thinks that a U.S. gov
ernment default is more likely than a
German default.
