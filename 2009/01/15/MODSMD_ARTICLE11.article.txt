# The

## The

### 
Last week I wrote about the five most
important economic events of 2008.
This week. I have selected the five eco
nomic events that I think will he most inter
esting and relevant in the upcoming year.
I lore they are (in no particular order):
1. Auto Industry Survival
The auto industry finally got the govern
ment bailout it was so desperately seeking.
They now have enough cash to keep them
afloat until, would you believe it. March.
Maybe April, if we were being generous.
The big question is: What happens next?
The littler questions are: Will the United
Auto Workers union make the concessions
that automakers ask? Will automakers final
ly revamp their fleets and start making
smaller, more fuel-efficient cars? Will the
quality of cars made in Detroit match those
of their foreign competitors? Will someone
actually buy a Chevrolet Impala instead of a
Toyota Camry? What if I told you you'd get
zero percent APR financing on the Impala?
And a free upgrade to leather seats â€” it's
the post-holiday season's biggest blow-out
sale!
2. TARP Round II
Round I of this fight was dominated by
the financial crisis.Treasury Secretary Hank
Paulson went into his corner bloodied from
another wave of massive write-downs and
bruised from the continued deterioration of
credit markets. In fact, things have become
st> bad in that corner that they're sending out
someone new for the next round.
Round II will involve new Treasury Sec
retary Timothy Geithner vs. Hie Financial
Crisis. Geithner will be armed with the re
maining $350 billion of TARP money while
The Financial Crisis will charge out of its
corner with abysmal consumer spending,
continued weakness in housing and in
creased defaults on bank loan portfolios.
It will be interesting to see what (ieithner
does with the TARP funds. Paulson's strate
gy of blindly injecting capital into the coun
try's largest banks has proven largely unsuc
cessful. Banks have hoarded the majority of
this capital because they've been uncertain

of future credit conditions. As a result, bank
lending remains scarce and credits markets
frozen.
A better solution involves getting regula
tors to force write-downs on banks before
in jecting capital.This would stop banks from
hoarding cash against future write-downs
and get them to start lending to each other,
in turn thawing the credit markets back into
action.
3. Russia-Ukraine Dispute
Just when things looked like they were
going to be resolved. Russia and the Ukraine
started pointing fingers at each other again.
This time, Russia claimed that the Ukraine
didn't send the appropriate paperwork to
recommence gas pumping.
Seriously? I can't believe that a disrup
tion of this magnitude is being prolonged by
the absence of paperwork. Paperwork! And
you thought the I)MV was a bureaucratic
organization.
Silliness aside, this spat is likely to have
grave geopolitical consequences. Russia
could very well take military action against
the Ukraine, exacerbating the instability in
political relations among Eastern bloc
states. Fearing such instability and the in
evitable disruption of natural gas. Europe
will begin looking for new sources in the
near future. One possibility is increasing the
use of liquefied natural gas, which can be
procured from more reliable sources in the
Middle East and Southeast Asia.
4. Frugal China
Chinese consumers' unwillingness to
spend has been generally lauded, llieir high
savings have allowed for greater levels of in
vestment and fueled China's export-driven
