# Hungry for change
## 
### 
Like many of you. I care a lot about
food. I spend more time thinking
about food than I do my future, to the
point where the choice between searching
for a great job and searching for a grilled
cheese isn't really a choice at all.
And so it is with a heavy heart and an un
happy tummy that I write this column, dear
readers.Today, at approximately 5 p.m., I was
near Tresidder and wanted literally nothing
more (yes, including a hovercraft) than a sub.
Being logical, 1 then walked to Subway, only
to discover that Subway is now for some rea
son closed on weekends.
Well, this was unacceptable. Fixated on
having a sub. 1 biked to Quiznos and had one
of the most delicious meals of my life.
But time passed, and I got hungry again. I
live in Suites, and so I have an open kitchen.
The problem with an open kitchen, though, is
that if I don't want to subsist on a diet of
Cheez-Its (not a terrible fate,but still), I have
to cook for myself.
And the problem with cooking for myself
is that I am a terrible chef. For example, 1 just
ingested a quesadilla I tried to make without
a microwave. Somehow, I managed to both
undercook and burn it. but because I spent so
much time and energy on the food-shaped
object, I determinedly ate the entire thing,
chunks of charcoal and all.
So if I'm not alive by the time this column
comes out Wednesday, that's probably why.
This all brings me to the issue of Stanford
Dining. The issue I have with Dining is not
how hard people work or even the variety or
quality of food; the issue is that Dining works
hard to control a system it shouldn't need to.
As it stands, if you're on a meal plan, you
pay several thousand dollars for 10-18 meals
a week (a few of which you probably miss
each week).and il vou get fewer meals.you

receive one Cardinal Dollar for every three
real dollars or so you put in. (When your
dorm takes trips, it gets reimbursed a little
less than three bucks for every meal, worth
roughly $10. that you miss). Why do you get
so little money out? The three dollars reflect
the raw cost of food — the rest is lost in over
head and employee expenses.
This means that a three-Cardinal dollar
slice of pizza at Stern late night effectively
costs nine real dollars, because you're paying
for labor twice. (This might be fair with Stern
Late Nite. though, as a policy, food isn't sold
unless it's been re-cooked a few times).
And if you aren't on a meal plan, you're
probably using an eating club or a house chef.
These systems might cost less, but they limit
your food options at each meal, they usually
leave several meals a week chef-less and
when the open kitchen runs out.you're out of
luck.
My proposal is this: Stanford should set a
standard amount of money — say, $2000
that students should expect to spend on food
per quarter. (Setting this amount is impor
tant for scholarship and parental reasons.)
This money would be placed on a Stan
ford card, which could be used at literally any
food-serving organization on campus, the
Treehouse included, lleck. maybe it could
even be used at restaurants in Palo Alto. It
would work on the same principle as a debit
card.
After all. we aren't children — we can
budget our own food money, and at a school
that has been accused of coddling its stu
dents. having a restrictive dining plan won't
help matters any.
On the food production side, if Stanford
were a little more flexible, maybe we could
have a variety of restaurants open up — all
run by different people, all offering different

foods for different prices and all setting their
own hours — to respond to the needs of stu
dents. Producing food in response to demand
— rather than trying to anticipate it —
would reduce waste and increase satisfac
tion.
Imagine, for example, if Tresidder had a
range of such stores, which would attempt to
respond to student demands. There could be
vegetarian, hamburger or even haggis shops
— so long as students spend enough to keep
the stores in business, the stores could stay.
And if we students don 't eat there, something
we like more could move in.
The dining halls would still have their
place on campus — they could offer buffet
style food for a reasonable price to students
who want to eat by their dorms.
And houses could benefit trom this sys
tem, too — rather than asking for a check for
food, they could simply deduct the necessary
amount from the meal plan. People living in
the houses would then be able to spend the
rest of their Cardinal Dollars on other
restaurants during weekends.
Look at the example of the Treehouse
it's independently run.and despite not ac
cepting Cardinal meal plan dollars (it does
accept the Cardinal Dollars your parents can
put on), it provides some of the best food on
campus. Why not let people spend their meal
points where they want to? Why not dupli
cate a system that works well?
At the very least.can we get Subway open
on weekends again? I can't be trusted to
make my own food this Saturday.

restaurants during weekends.
Look at the example of the Treehouse
it's independently run.and despite not ac
cepting Cardinal meal plan dollars (it does
accept the Cardinal Dollars your parents can
put on), it provides some of the best food on
campus. Why not let people spend their meal
points where they want to? Why not dupli
cate a system that works well?
At the very least.can we get Subway open
on weekends again? I can't be trusted to
make my own food this Saturday.

Email Kevin at ktwehb@stanfbrd.edii if you
have any great names for a haggis shop.
