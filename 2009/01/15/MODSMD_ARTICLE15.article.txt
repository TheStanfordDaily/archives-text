## DIVIDE AND CONQUER Women head to Sin City, Indian Wells 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last year, the Stanford women's tennis
team was ranked No. 2 heading into the sea
son, shocking head coach Lele Forood who
felt that it was too high for a young Cardinal
squad. This year, Stanford comes in at No. 5
in the latest preseason polls with no first
place votes, leaving much to prove for a team
two years removed from its last national title.
"I think that it's okay." Forood said of the
ranking. "We have to start winning some
matches this weekend to justify our ranking
given that we have very few people ranked in
individual singles and doubles. This is the
coach's vote so they feel that we have enough
returning players to he a top-5 team entering
the dual match season."
After losing only one senior from the
starting lineup, the Cardinal still has the fire
power to contend among the elite programs
in the nation.
"We're confident enough to have that
ranking." Forood added. "We'll see how
we're doing in a month when Indoors come."
The first big test of the season comes this
weekend at the Freeman Memorial Women's
Tennis Championships in Las Vegas and the
National Collegiate Tennis Classic (NCTC)
in Indian Wells, CA.

McVeigh, and freshmen Logan Hansen and
Courtney Clayton, where they will face some
of the toughest players in college tennis.
"The draw at Las Vegas is very, very tough
this year as I saw yesterday." Forood said.
" l"here will be top players from Baylor. Geor

It's going to be quite a tough tournament."

The women's tennis team, ranked fifth in the country, will play two tournaments simultaneously
this weekend, when part of the team travels to the south, while another group goes to Las Vegas.
Last year, the Cardinal took home
two doubles titles and a singles
consolation title. Four players
made it into the quarterfinals of
the main draw, and one to the
semifinals.
"Last year we had a lot of good
performances in the early January
tournaments and we had people on
the court ready quickly," Forood
said. "Hopefully we'll start moving
up those individual rankings."
After a phenomenal freshman
campaign, sophomore Hilary
Barte will headline the group of
players headed to Indian Wells, in
cluding junior Lindsay Burdette.

sophomore Jennifer Yen and
freshman Veronica Li.
"The tournaments are pretty
much the same," Forood said. "Hi
lary played in Las Vegas last year,
and she wants to see what the tour
nament in Indian wells is like."
With a relatively light fall sea
son. Stanford finds itself dropped in
the individual rankings. Barte and
Burdette come in at No. 26 and No.
97, respectively. Barte and Burdette
are also the only Stanford doubles
team ranked, at No. 41. Nguyen,
who sat out most of the fall season,
fell out of the rankings.
" They completely go by how you
play in the fall," Forood said. "We
didn't play much, we sent no one to
the Indoors, and that hurts you in
the rankings."
Next week, Stanford will begin
its dual-match season as thev host

UC-Davis. Last year, their opener
against the Aggies was postponed
until April because of rain.
"We'll be really excited to play
our first real dual match." Forood
said. "We look forward to seeing
Davis on the 22nd. It'll be a preview
match before playing the indoor
qualifying events."
With the heart of a long season
just around the bend. Stanford is
hoping for an auspicious start be
ginning this weekend.
"We pretty motivated," Forood
said. "We couldn't officially prac
tice until yesterday, which is a bit of
a hindrance. But we're hitting the
ball pretty well, and I expect to see
some good performances this
weekend."
