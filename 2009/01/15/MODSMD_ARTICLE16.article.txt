## Suit technology causes collegiate controversies 
### KENAN JIANG STAFF WRITER 
For better or worse, the biggest controver
sy in the swimming world recently has been
the advent of suit technology and how much it
has affected swimmers' performance. FINA.
swimming's international governing body, will
make a decision on the suits and the nature of
their use in a month, and then, based on
FINA's ruling, the NCAA committee will
make its own conclusion on the use of high

tech suits in college swimming. ( urrently, the
LZR. Speedo's high-tech suit, has been
banned from NCAA competition, but a host
of other high-tech suits, like the Blue Seventy.
have not.
Speedo first revealed the revolutionary suit
that started it all — the LZR — in February
2008, an opportune time because the Aus
tralian and U.S. Olympic Trials were just
around the corner, along with the 2008
Olympics in Beijing. The LZR's technology
means that swimsuits are skintight, increase

buoyancy and are purported to allow a swim
mer to move more efficiently in the water.
Soon, a host of problems arose from the
LZR's presence in the market, including Tyr's
lawsuits against Speedo involving a number of
high-profile swimmers, as former athletes
signed bv Tyr switched to Speedo because of
the increase in performance of the suits.
"[The new technology] really changes
swimming in a big way." Stanford men's senior
captain Jason Dunford said. "The regulation
right now really is quite lax. the rulings are

very vague, so basically anything goes. The
suits help some more than others — [it| un
levels (sic) the playing field. Suddenly the im
provements are not because of training."
Dunford, who swam at the Beijing
Olympics without the lull benefits offered by
the new technology, has a unique perspective
on the changes the suits have brought to the
sport.
"It is distorting the face of the sport; [there

isj lots of disgruntlement," he said.
"Was I at a disadvantage compared
to full-body suits? Hard to say, be
cause the lull-body suits didn't lit me
well."
The suits have also enraged many
in the swimming community be
cause there have been a dispropor
tionate number of world records
coming from swimmers who, before
the advent of suit technology, were
unheard of. lON swimming world
records have been broken since the
creation of the LZR suits, and while
many of the records have been ac
knowledged due to hard work of
swimmers training extra hard in the
"Olympic year." other world records
are viewed with suspicion as seem
ingly huge improvements having
been made in hardly any time bv a
large range of swimmers, many of
whom would not even have made
their own respective national teams
before 2008. Whether the improve
ment in swimming is due to the suits
or because of better training meth
ods or both is a matter of debate in
the swimming world.

"We use the BlueSeventys," sen
ior captain Paul Kornfeld said.
"[BlueSeventy is] a triathlon compa
ny, [so] the material is a little thicker.
Usually less [material], the better;
now the more material on body, the
faster. Older coaches used to shave
[the body] to go fast."
"If going with more efficiency,
you're getting there faster [with the
new suits]." Kornfeld added. "[The
suits are] definitely changing the
sport —don't know il it's for the bet
ter. but it's the new reality. I think it's
unfair if a full-body [suit] was versus
a brief one. It's a pretty distinct ad
vantage. proven to be that way. It is a
disadvantage for not fully funded
programs."
Ille suits have affected college
swimming teams across the nation as
the NCAA swimming committee
continues to await the decision of
FINA for the next couple months.
For the Stanford men's swim team,
its official sponsor, Nike, has already
decided to pull out of the swimming
apparel market, as Nike has not in
vested in making high-tech suits and
its consumer base has shrunk signifi
cantly since the arrival of the high
tech suits. The team currently wears
suits by Blue Seventy, which was
originally an open-water body-suit
company that has since expanded its

base into the pool racing suit market,
and makes high-tech suits to com
pete with Speedo. Tyr. Arena and
Mi/.uno.
Perhaps the biggest controversy
has come in the pricing of these suits.
The LZR is priced at about $500 on
the market, but it cannot stand up to
high usage because of its tightness
around the body. Many have report
ed LZRs ripping after only a few
uses and have questioned the value
of $500 for such a limited-use prod
uct.
Additionally, the high cost of the
suit technology has led to specula
tion on whether economically disad
vantaged people who cannot afford
to wear the suits would be at a prac
tical disadvantage come major com
petition time. While the LZR was
lent out to everyone who wanted to
wear one during the U.S. Olympic
Trials, many other countries includ
ing France and South Africa did not
have such a deal.
For this litany of monetary and
performance reasons, debate over
enhanced suit technology will con
tinue to rage throughout all levels of
the swimming world — that is. until
FINA makes its final decision.
