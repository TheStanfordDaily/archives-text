# Cardinal flies high in Cancun
## Gymnastics take first in season opener, besting two ranked teams 
### KENAN JIANG STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's gymnastics team came out of its season
opener with a win in the Cancun Classic on Jan. 2. The Cardinal
faced solid competitors in BYU, Denver and Oregon State, who
all participated in last year's NCAA postseason.
The No. 5 Cardinal won the meet by scoring 195.6 points, beat
ing No. 9 Oregon State (194.575.) No. 14 Denver (193.825) and
BYU (189.125) over four evenings at the Hilton Beach and Re
sort Spa. Stanford had the highest scores on all events — bar,
vault, beam, floor, all-around — except the floor in which the Pi
oneers narrowly edged out the Cardinal.
"Our long term goal is of course to be competing on the last
day of year for the NCAA title," sophomore Gretchen O'Henley
said. "But we have a whole season ahead of us, so oftentimes we
set short term goals for the upcoming meet to improve from the
last competition so that we can reach that long term goal."
"A goal at every meet is to hit all of our routines," she contin
ued. "We also focus on performance, stuck landings, and "saving
tenths,' meaning having each person try and fix just one little de
tail in each of their routines."
In the all-around, junior Carly Janiga finished first with a
39.275. Janiga,a 2007 Ail-American in the all-around, tied for first
on the vault against two other girls from Oregon State. On the
bars. Janiga finished first with a 9.90, and on the beam, senior
Heather Purnell finished first with a 9.85, followed by junior All
yse Ishino and sophomore Danielle Janiga with 9.825. While Den
ver's Amanda Johnson finished first on floor, sophomore
Danielle Ikoma came close at 9.80.
It was a nice beginning for the Stanford women's team, which
announced its emergence as one of the nation's elite college gym
nastics squads with a emphatic third place finish at the NCAAs
last year, and will seek its third straight "Super Six" appearance at
national championships. Under head coach Kristen Smyth, Stan
ford has so far had many impressive accomplishments, such as
winning three conference titles in the past five years. In the last
four years, Stanford has had two top three NCAA finishes as
Smyth has coached 12 gymnasts to 56
All-American awards since her first
year in the 20()2 season.
"We are coming off one of our
best seasons in school history after
winning the Pac-10 title and finishing
3rd at the NCAA Championships,"
Smyth said. "We had a preseason
ranking of sth and competed in our
first competition last weekend where
we started the year off strong."
Despite losing 14-time All-Amer
ican Tabitha Yim and three-time Pac
-10 champion Liz Tricase to gradua
tion. Stanford returns four All Amer
icans in senior Kelly Fee. Janiga. sen
ior Nicole Ourada and junior Blair
Ryland. Ourada and Janiga have Ail-
Around All-American distinction.
The Cardinal will also seek contribu
tion from its newly recruited fresh
man class including Canadian
Olympic alternate Alyssa Brown.

"We are coming

coach
Nicole Pechanec. and junior U.S. Na
tional Team member Catherine
Nguyen. Ishino. Fee. and Janiga have
competed for the US national teams
while Brown was Canada's top all
around performer at the 2007 World
Championships.
While Ourada and Nguyen sat out
the Cancun Classic with injuries,
Brown, Alexander, and junior Blair
Ryland have stepped up to fill in for
their teammates' absences so far in
the all-around which, along with the

bars and beam, are arguably Stan
ford's deepest events.
Yet despite all their success and
hard work, the gymnasts have never
lost sight of one of Smyth's most im
portant coaching philosophies.
"The girls on the team are what
mean the most to me," O'Henley
said, 'it's definitely much more than
a team for me, it's a family. We work
together, have fun together, and
everything we do we do for each
other, not just ourselves."
"We have the mentality in the
gym and at competitions that we al
ways have each other's backs." she
continued. "But with these girls it ex
tends far beyond that and I don't
think I could find that level of friend
ship or commitment anywhere else."
Stanford faces its next competi
tion on Jan. 16 against Washington
University, Seattle Pacific and Sacra
mento State, while its first home meet
will be on Jan. 22 at 7pm at Burnham
Pavilion against No. 24 Arizona
