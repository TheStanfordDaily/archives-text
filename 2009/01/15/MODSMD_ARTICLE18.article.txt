# Sharks the Bay's best show
## 
### 
In collegiate hockey, where the
schedule is broken into two
game series each weekend, the
adage goes "sweep at home and split
on the road." Any team that does
this is hound to have enough points
to qualify for the postseason when
the time comes.
The same goal holds true in the
NHL, although the schedule is hit
more hectic. Games aren't neatly
packaged into series, but the season
is still broken down into home
stands and road trips. Win every
home game and at least a handful ol
the 41 on the road and you are in
good shape.
Of course, this saying is more of
just an ideal to shoot for, not some
thing realistically achievable. But
the San Jose Sharks, one of the
NI 11/s elite teams so far this season,
seem to be taking it literally.
.lust one game past the halfway
point, the Sharks are a remarkable
20-0-2 in home games.That's 20 wins
in 22 games. And both losses came in
overtime, making them worth a
point each. In fact, dating back to
last season, the Sharks haven't lost
in regulation at the "Tank" since
Feb. 14. Six more home games with
out a loss in regulation and they will
make it an entire calendar year of
earning at least one point in every
home game.
But they aren't just winning at
home. This season the Sharks are 12-
5-3 on the road, securing 27 of the 40
possible points so far. In total they
have only failed to record a point five
times the entire season. Their 67
points through the first half of the sea
son is the best start by any team since
the 1944-45 Montreal Canadiens.
Maybe their motto should be
"just win everyday,everywhere."
If you're not a hockey fan, now
may be a good time to start, l ake the
Caltrain down to lIP Pavilion and
catch a game, because these guys are
playing first class hockey on a night
ly basis. No Friday class? Try tonight,
when they take on Calgary.
But the point is that, so far, the
Sharks are having a historical sea
son. Of course it won't matter much
if they can't keep winning in the
postseason, as has been the problem
with this team in years past.
Fortunately though, fans will
soon get a chance to see this team
match up against some of the com
petition it will likely see in the play
offs.
On Saturday Detroit and their
30-7-6 overall record visit the Bay
Area. At the end of the month
Chicago, which is just 24-10-7 but
has one of the most dangerous of
fenses in the league, will come to
play as well.
And. in a match up of the two
best teams ol the first half and possi
ble Stanley Cup Final preview, the
Sharks will travel east to play
Boston on national TV on Feb. 10.
The Bruins are 32-7-4, just one point
behind San Jose for the best mark in
the league, and have both scored the
most and allowed the least goals of
any team. Definitely circle this one
on your calendar.
if the Sharks show they can skate
with these three teams, and there is
no reason to believe they won't, they
will go deep into the postseason.
I'm not prepared to tell you that
they will bring the Cup to the Bay,
because anything can and does hap
pen on the ice once May arrives. But
there is every reason to hope.
This team has almost no chinks in
its armor: only the third and fourth
lines have any room for improve
ment. But they are still mostly solid,
and the top two are so good that it
doesn't matter if they are perfect.
To put it simply, the Sharks are
just about as dominant as any team
can be right now and we are lucky to
have a local team with such ability.
So, if you haven't yet, join me and
jump on the bandwagon now.
For years I couldn't stand west
coast hockey, and Anaheim still
makes me cringe. But the Sharks
have won me over. They are one of
the most exciting things in sports
this winter and it's time we all paid
attention.
