### DAISY CHEN STAFF WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council (GSC)
reviewed funding requests, upcoming social
events and Diversity Week logistics at its
weekly meeting last night.
Lan Wei. graduate student in electrical
engineering, led the session.
The Persian Student Association received
$2,550, Spicmacay was granted $3,7fX) and the
Stanford Taiwanese Student Association had
$1,%0 approved for its New Year
Celebration. Adam Sciambi, graduate
student in the natural sciences, updated the
GSC on (irad Formal preparation.
' Hie venue is charging the same amount
as last year." Sciambi said. "We will have
access to everywhere [at the venue], and
there are two stories, two ballrooms, a nice
lobby, a patio and its own parking lot."
The venue, the Computer History
Museum in Mountain View, has charged the
GSC $ 1 ().()(K) for the reservation and is allow
ing attendees full access to the building,
including exploration of the museum's vari
ous exhibits, during the event.
Courtney Bonam. graduate student in psy
chology. asked GSC members for outreach
suggestions to present to the Stanford
Alumni Association at its upcoming meeting.
Ryan Peacock, graduate student in chemical
engineering, suggested that recent graduates
be more active in interactions with alumni.
"in terms of how you connect with a stu
dent." Peacock said, "there should be more
emphasis on getting grad students to work
with people who were here exclusively for
grad school."
"| The association] can invite speakers or
graduates of Stanford to come," Polina
Segalova. GSC co-chair, added. "It would be
a great way to introduce alumni to current
students."
Bonam updated the GSC on the Diversity
Committee initiatives.
Planned events for Diversity Week include
a moderated dialogue with a researcher on
the benefits of diversity in higher education, a
talk given by Stanford administrators about
efforts to increase diversity and a lunch with

organizations to talk about what students can
do to help the respective causes.
Regarding the graduate student equip
ment rentals, Mary van der Hoven, graduate
student in geological and environmental sci-
ences, was chosen to facilitate the
physical process of checking equip
ment pieces out to students. The
salary for her temporary position
will be taken from the GSC's gener
al discretionary fund, which is
