# Students face job concerns
## Economic downturn intensifies job-hunting JOB WANTED 
### ROBERT TOEWS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With stock markets sagging, large cor
porations filing for bankruptcy, massive
layoffs, and a 7.2 percent unemployment
rate (the highest in 16 years), not even
Stanford students are immune from the
job slump.
"We're definitely seeing a slowdown
in recruiting activity." said Lance Choy.
director of the Career Development
Center (CDC). "During the fall, there
were companies that used to recruit but
no longer existed. As another example,
some investment banks reduced the
number of interview rooms they
reserved by over fifty percent."
So far this quarter. 125 interviews
have been scheduled through Cardinal
Recruiting, an on-campus employer
interview program operated by the
CDC.This time last year, there were 171.
Some seniors are viewing the current
unpromising employment climate as an
added incentive to stay in school longer
by pursuing higher degrees.
"1 have many friends who have elect
ed to continue their education by double
majoring, co-terming or attending anoth
er graduate school after this year instead
of working for a few years and then com
ing back to school," said Dan Priestley
'09, who is planning to stay an extra year
toco-term in Mechanical Engineering or
Computer Science.
Manv others who plan on entering

the workforce are finding that they need
to reassess their expectations.
"I am definitely broadening my
search as a result of the economic down
turn," said Jessica Marie Walker '09. who
is currently searching for a job in the
entertainment industry. "1 used to only
consider applying to very specific, top
ranked companies, but now I am re-eval
uating this and thinking that really. 1
need a job, and 1 might have to stop
being picky."
Seniors are not the only students
affected by the lackluster job environ
ment — sophomores and juniors are
also finding it more difficult to find sum
mer internships.
Stephen Foster '09. who is recruiting
for a summer internship with an invest
ment bank this summer, savs internships
are still available, but more competitive
to obtain.
"Deal flow in all the investment
banks is low right now." Foster said.
"While getting a full-time job will be
hard, getting an internship will be harder
— but not impossible."
"1 definitely think I'm at a disadvan
tage to people that applied in past
years," he added."But firms don't see the
recession as lasting for more than a year
or two. and since they rely on bringing
fresh new talent into the firm to get the
job done, they will still recruit summer
interns."
