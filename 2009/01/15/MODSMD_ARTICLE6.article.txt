# STUDENT LIFE
## Students hold vigil, remember Thom Massey 
### VERONICA LANDA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Over the past two weeks, students, fac
ulty and other members of the Stanford
community have come together to remem
ber Thorn Massey. associate dean of stu
dents and Naranja resident fellow (Rl ).
Massey. who held bachelor's and master's
degrees from Stanford, passed away Jan. 1
after having a heart attack.

On Tuesday afternoon, a memorial
service was held in Memorial Church, fol
lowed by a reception at the Black
Community Services Center. Speakers
included Harold Boyd, associate dean of
students emeritus, Sally Dickson, associate
vice provost for student affairs and
Reverend Joanne Sanders of the Office of
Religious Life.
A traditional prayer and music were
offered in remembrance, as well as reflec

tions from William Dement, professor of
psychiatry and behavioral sciences and
psychology: Warren Hayman MA '67: the
Naranja House staff; Winona Simms. asso
ciate dean and director of the Native
American Cultural Center; and Massey's
son Tajai Massey *97.
Thorn Massey began his 40 years at
Stanford as a student and athlete, and
eventually as a pillar for diversity on cam
pus. He received a bachelor's degree in

psychology in 1969 and a master's degree
in administration policy in higher educa
tion in l l )72. His remarkable contributions
helped shape the way Stanford embraces
diversity and community, and in fitting
fashion, the celebrations of his life reflect
ed that core value he strove to uphold.
The group gathered at Memorial
Church was so large that many stood for
the hour and a half at the back of
the room, listening to comforting
messages and heartwarming sto
ries. Speakers commented on how
touched Massey would be to see
such a large and diverse group of
people come together in his honor.
The mood was light and rever
ent inside the church. Kiah
Williams *08, former Naranja staff
member, said Massey would want
others to continue his activism
regarding diversity.
"1 think that Thom would not
want us to dwell on his unfortunate
passing," Williams said."lnstead, he
would challenge us to challenge
ourselves, reevaluating our
assumptions about race, culture
and ethnicity."
The crowd laughed with every
joyful memory related in the
church, and reflected on comments
about his lasting legacy and tireless
work. Williams stated, "Thorn's
legacy is hundreds of staff and stu
dents whose lives he impacted," a
sentiment reflected by nearly all

speakers at the memorial service.
Elizabeth Heimbaugh *11, for
mer resident of Naranja praised
Massey's peaceful nature. "His
presence was one of strength and
guidance and concern," she said. "It
is the spirit of non-conflict, of mak
ing brotherhood and peace and
understanding from strife that I
carry in my memories of Thorn. It is
an important legacy, quietly and
endlessly inspiring."
One of the most repeated mem
ories of Massey was the unique way
by which he lived his life.
"Thorn not only taught others to
strive for moral ideals, such as
equality, acceptance and peaceful
mediation, but he also lived by
those ideals," said Sumil Thapa '10,
a former Naranja resident.
Also on Tuesday evening, a can
dlelight vigil was held in Lagunita
Courtyard.The lawn was filled with
many who came together to
remember that, as Simms stated at
the Memorial Church service. "We
are the essence of Thorn's legacy."
and that Massey will always be, as
Dement said, Stanford's "knight in
white football shoes."
