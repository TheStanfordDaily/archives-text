# CARD FACES COLORADO TESTS
## Stanford seeks success on the road 
### ZOE LEAVITT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
From the beginning of the sea
son. coach Jason Borrelli has been
looking forward to the day when
Cardinal wrestling would be able
to put forward a full lineup and
present every wrestler in their
optimal class. That day is finally
here.
Several lingering injuries have
forced Stanford into difficult deci
sions during the first half of the
season â€” the team has been faced
with either forfeiting matches or
shuffling around wrestlers so that
they are outweighed in their
matches. For the first time this
year. Stanford will be able to wres
tle in all 10 weight classes on the
road against Air Force and
Northern Colorado this Saturday.
Coming off several tough losses
over the past two weekends, the
team is trying to keep a positive
attitude going into Saturday's
match.Though Air Force (1-5) and
Northern Colorado (I-S-l) hold
records comparable to Stanford
(3-10-1), Borrelli cautioned against

putting too much stock in statistics.
"I don't like to use records as a
gauge" Borrelli said. "Both these
teams have gone up against real
competitive teams, and this is
going to he a really competitive
match. You look at our record, and
we've gone up against some tough
teams, lost some matches pretty
closely. I'm excited, the guys are
excited to go up against a more
evenly matched team."
Air Force achieved its first win
of the season last Saturday against
Cal Baptist, and Northern
Colorado's only victory came
against Portland State. Stanford
beat Baptist in November. 25-IN,
but the Cardinal has not yet faced
the Vikings.
But while the Cardinal, Falcons
and Bears seem evenly matched
overall, several standout wrestlers
from the Falcons and the Bears
could spike up the difficulty level
for Stanford. Two NCAA quali
fiers, Stephen Crozier and Tyler
French, highlight the Air Force
lineup. French, at 174 pounds, is the

defending NCAA West Regional
champion, and Crozier, at 165
pounds, holds his team's best record
at 5-1.
While the Bears have a team on
the younger side, like Stanford, they
return junior Kenny Hashimoto,
who took a year off to train for the
Olympics in judo. Hashimoto will
wrestle in the 141-pound weight
class. The Bears also have junior
Tony Mustari, who ranks 17th na
tionally in the 125-pound weight
class. He'll face Matt Sencenbaugh,
one of the few true freshmen in
Stanford's lineup.
"Matt has had a super hard
schedule already, probably the
toughest schedule of all our guys as a
weight class," Borrelli said.
Sencenbaugh picked up his first
victory last Saturday against Drexel.
Since the Cardinal has not wres
tled either of these teams in several
years, they "do not have much back
ground to work with," Borrelli said.

"We normally have a lot of game
plans, but we don't have a ton of
footage on these guys."
But do the other teams view this
informational void in the same way?
"They see us as an opportunity to
get some wins so they're going to
come out ready to wrestle," Borrelli
said. "Both teams have great coach
ing staff, they're going to be hungry."
The opportunity will pay off for
whichever team can take advantage
of it first.
As the season enters its second
half, the team looks towards staying
healthy, preserving its newly healed
players, and preparing for the end
of-season championships. While the
coaches have recently picked up the
intensity of training, they will take a
week off after this weekend's match
es. The team will go through two
more cycles of training and rest be
fore the final run-up to NCAA
Championships.
"Our guys are pretty banged up

right now; we've even trained
through some competitions," said
Borrelli of the Cardinal's training
schedule.
He cited this lack of rest before
competitions as a possible reason for
some of the team's struggles.
"We do what we have to do to get
ready for the end of the year, and if
that takes training through a few
competitions, then we will," Borrelli
said.
But after this weekend, the two
weeks without another match
should be a welcome reprieve for
the team.
Stanford's weekend kicks off at
Air Force on Friday at 7 p.m. Moun
tain Time and continues Saturday
against Northern Colorado. The
Cardinal's next opponents will be
Oregon State, Portland State and
Princeton on Jan. 30.
