### ZOE LEAVITT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
From the beginning of the sea
son. coach Jason Borrelli has been
looking forward to the day when
Cardinal wrestling would be able
to put forward a full lineup and
present every wrestler in their
optimal class. That day is finally
here.
Several lingering injuries have
forced Stanford into difficult deci

road against Air Force and

"I don't like to use records as a
gauge" Borrelli said. "Both these
teams have gone up against real

match. You look at our record, and
we've gone up against some tough
teams, lost some matches pretty
closely. I'm excited, the guys are
excited to go up against a more
evenly matched team."
Air Force achieved its first win
of the season last Saturday against
Cal Baptist, and Northern
Colorado's only victory came
against Portland State. Stanford
beat Baptist in November. 25-IN,
but the Cardinal has not yet faced
the Vikings.
But while the Cardinal, Falcons
and Bears seem evenly matched
overall, several standout wrestlers
from the Falcons and the Bears
could spike up the difficulty level
for Stanford. Two NCAA quali

French, highlight the Air Force
lineup. French, at 174 pounds, is the

Colorado, teams that have also had a hard time finding success this season and are seeking needed wins.
