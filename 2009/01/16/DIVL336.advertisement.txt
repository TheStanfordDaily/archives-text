The BlowUpDollz are not your average campus band. Recently headlining at the famous Whiskey a Go Go on the
Sunset Strip (pictured prominently above), The Great American Music Hall in San Francisco and the 2008 VMA
pre-party. Not too shabby for a band that got together a year ago. Right now they are finalists in this year's ®
CampusMusicFest and they need your help. The final day to vote for your favorite band is today and, as of 10:53 on
Thursday night, they are one step away from first place. So if you want some Stanford representation in the music
world, check out http://www.campusmusicfest.com/ and VOTE! Do it for intermission. Or the BlowUpDollz.
