DEAR DR. PAUL,
I've heard that in certain parts of the backside of campus, the Southwest part to be
precise, a new fad has suddenly become super popular. I know this sounds crazy, but
I've heard folks say that taking can get
you drunk ... I wanted to ask you if this method could help me sterilize my tailpipe.
Dear Southern Explorer,
As it happens, alcohol is absorbed by your large colon, rapidly getting you drunk by filtering the alcohol directly into your
blood stream. Now in order to take a shot from the other side, there arc a couple logistical problems that you must over
come. First, you have gravity. As Newton once said, liquid that goes up must come out. Thus, an inverted position is neces
sary. Second you must have an excellent and open-minded spotter to assist your "taking" the shot down your anal sphinc
ter. Possible side effects include intense burning for up to half an hour after, as well as what professionals refer to as the
"reverse pour." If you follow these steps and advice, I can ensure that you will not only "sterilize your tailpipe," you'll also
get a good buzz goin' on. Bottom's up!
Got a burning question you can't ask anyone else? â„¢
