# On display now: paintings inspired by studies in London
## Sara sisun 
### 
When Sara Sisun '09 transferred from Vassar, a school
with a distinguished art program, to Stanford, it
was an "odd choice for an art student." But being
here at Stanford, an intersection of diverse academic interests
and hobbies has made Sisun's creativity endless and her art
even more unique and interesting. With her wide range of
interests, Sisun is everything but a conventional artist, paving

the way for contemporary art. In an interview with intermis
sion, Sisun described her newest collection on display at the
CoHo, as well as her inspirations.
intermission: What inspires you?
Sara Sisun: I like reading about painting. I like looking at art
forums, contemporary art and flash art. I like being in studio
classes with other students because almost always people will
interpret assignments completely differently. All of these
things 1 like to do inspire me and give me new ideas for proj
ects. It's like having a dream — different images pop up and I
get to decide which ones are the most interesting.
i: What is this particular collection that will be on display at
the CoHo like? How is it different from your past works?
SS: Most of the stuff at the CoHo are paintings I did while I
was abroad in London over summer and during the fall quar
ter. In London, I studied at the Slaed School, where some of my
favorite artists have gone. This experience definitely changed
my style. It made me think about the way I paint and changed
what I've been taught. I learned to question the 'rules' that I've
been taught.
So in this particular collection, you will see me more will
ing to experiment with colors and shadowing. Also, figures are
a recurring theme. I like painting dancers, faces and portraits.
But you also want to challenge yourself by painting new
things. So I have some random things in this collection, such
as a painting of a pelican skeleton. And also, a painting of a
foot that is on an 8-foot-by-10-foot Tyvek (heavy-duty con
struction industrial paper used for building houses].
i: In your painting, there is a strong contrast of colors. How do
you decide the color palette of your paintings?

SS: Color changes from painting to painting. I decide on how
I want it to look before I start a painting. In all of my paintings,
1 want to make sure light is connected and that it is in the
painting. I use colors to play up the shadowing, which I like
because I think shadowing is dramatic. 1 like drama [laughs].
i: Are you more influenced by classical or contemporary styles
of art?
SS: 1 have a strong background in art history and I like classi
cal art, but I would like my art to be more contemporary
because I think it's more important. Today, we really need to
deserve to have art that speaks to what is happening in the
world today and represents us today.
i: Why do you think, as an artist, art is important?
SS: I know why art is important to me. It's always been an out
let and reflective of how I'm feeling. It's a way for me to
describe how it feels to be me at a given time. It creates a record
so that I can go back to it and see how I was feeling at that
point in my life.
i: Do you plan on pursuing your artistic interest professional
ly, perhaps after Stanford?
SS: I do. I plan to get my MFA [Master's of Fine Arts]. I would
like to be a painter. I don't think I'll ever really have a iob. If I
sell a lot of paintings, I will. If I don't, I don't [laughs]. But I
like to paint, and I will be able to paint. That's what matters.
