# Old Union: a "Student Arts District"
## 
### 
Plans are underway to transform Old Union,
Tresidder, the CoHo and eventually all of
White Plaza into student art centers, offering
increased gallery space for the often underrepre
sented and underappreciated campus arts scene.
Indeed, until this year, student artists had little or no
space to display their work.
"There are essentially no gallery spaces avail
able for student artists unless they're art majors or
enrolled in studio art classes," said Sarah Woodward
'09, visual art coordinator for the Student
Organizing Committee for the Arts (SOCA), the
group leading the movement. "We're envisioning
that the student arts district will be the go-to place
for student exhibitions and installations to supple
ment the art department."
SOCA began its efforts last quarter by display
ing student art in the CoHo. The revamped eatery
and coffee house featured large oil paintings on its
otherwise black walls.
Last night, SOCA — with the logistical help of
Stanford Concert Network — expanded its efforts
to include Old Union. Hundreds of students crowd
ed into Old Union and the CoHo to view art, min
gle with friends and snack on cheese and bread.
Thirteen artists presented their work on large dis

play boards squeezed in between the couches and
tables. Old Union featured a range of art pieces,
including abstract oil paintings, candid photo
graphs and graphic design drawings. The eventual
hope is that the art will be removed from these
boards and hung on the walls of the first floor of
Old Union, finally adding color to the blank, beige
space.
"The Old Union is committed to showcasing
student art," said lanette Smith-Laws, director of
Old Union and Tresidder Union. Her hope is to
institutionalize a rotating art selection process by
establishing a student art curator position and an
art selection committee.
"This is a great event," Stuart Baimel '09, a Daily
columnist, said. "This should happen more often."
If SOCA, Old Union and the CoHo have any
thing to say about it, his wish will come true.
