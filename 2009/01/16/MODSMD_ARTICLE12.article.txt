# PASSAGES FOR LIGHT
## 
### 
Yoko Ono is nothing if not well
known. "Yoko Ono is one of the most
recognizable names in art today,"
explained Professor Gordon H. Chang, direc
tor of the Asian-American Art Project, dur
ing his introduction for Ono's visit to cam
pus on Wednesday. Whether her name recalls
her music, filmmaking, performance art,
activism or her marriage to lohn Lennon, her
renown is indisputable. Ono's lecture, titled
"Passages for Light," was made possible by
the Stanford Institute for Creativity and the
Arts (SiCa), and brought in an audience so
large that tickets were gone only a few hours
after being made available.
Once Ono had sauntered onto the stage
in her iconic hat and sunglasses, she had to
use a stepstool to be seen over the podium.

At 75, her energy seems
to have refused to dwin
dle over the years. She
introduced the first part
of the program: old Bmm
film clips from her child
hood. Her parents, espe
cially her mother, were
keenly interested in cap
turing young Yoko on
film, and decades later,
audiences were able to
view the legend in some

of her earliest moments: crawling, taking a
bath with her mother, imitating her father
playing golf on the front lawn and dancing.
The most precious images showed Ono
alongside her father; him in a stiff stance and
her, half his size, dancing in place with reck
less abandon — already showing the free
spirit for which she is so famous today.
Ono, born in Tokyo in 1933, moved to
San Francisco with her family when she was
two years old. The videos showed the city in
the mid-'3os: cable cars, old buildings, the
unfinished Golden Gate Bridge, etc., to which
Ono commented with a laugh that "It just
shows that I was there before you." As other
footage showed Ono immaculately dressed
and always wearing a hat, she joked, "Now I
know where my hat thing comes from."
Reflecting on images of her childhood, Ono
brought the audience into her life's experi
ences from the very beginning.
Next, she skipped forward to recent
years and showed the audience a video about
her two newest projects of light, love and
interaction. Onochord and the Imagine Peace
Tower both tie into the lecture's title of
"Passages for Light" by using light to convey
human emotion and unity. Onochord, a
project that is characteristically Onoesque
with its simple yet poignant message, is a way
to flash the message "I love you," using light:
first flashing the light once, then twice, then
three times, and repeating. She explained it
as a way to share the message, easily and with
everyone, and as she flashed the message to
the audience, they flashed it back, creating a
twinkling sea of lights within the auditorium.
Compared to Onochord, the Imagine

Peace Tower takes the same concept but
expands it to a much larger scale: It sends the
message of peace with light — except instead
of a tiny flashlight, it's a 10-meter-wide base
that projects a 4000-meter beam of light into
the sky. Situated in Reykjavik, Iceland, and
running on geothermal energy, the tower is
dedicated to John Lennon and was unveiled
in 2007. All the wishes from the Wish Trees
that Ono brings to her appearances are
buried at the base of the tower, sending their
energy up with the light into the universe.
Ono fondly recounted the inspiration behind
the tower: When she first met Lennon, he
asked her about her plans to build a "house
of light," not realizing that the idea had been
just a conceptual idea and not a real house,
and four decades later, she has built for him a

building made of light, just as he
originally had wanted.
Moving on to her perform
ances and art, Ono then showed
video clips of some of her work
over the years, describing her
belief that "the simplicity of life

gives you power." The films certainly reflect
ed the concept: "Freedom" was simply a
woman trying to rip off her brassiere in slow
motion, and "Cut Piece," one of her most
famous performances, showed Ono sitting
on stage while audience members filed by
and cut off her clothing with scissors.
Her most intriguing performance of the
night, however, was shown live: Without
explanation, Ono brought a wooden chair
out on stage, and after announcing, "I don't
know this chair, but I'm going to try to have
a relationship with it," proceeded to do just
that. She examined it, turned it on its side,
crawled on the ground and entangled herself
with its legs (showing surprising agility for
her age), threw it passionately to the side,
only to pick it up and cradle it — showing us
that no matter how long she's been around,
Ono always has surprises for her audiences.
Even through the last two videos, "It's
Time for Action" and "Outtro," Ono was full
of energy; despite the dimmed lights and the
audience's attention directed at the screen
rather than at her, she danced across the
stage to the music in the videos. "1 was danc
ing," she explained after the videos had fin
ished, "because I think it's important to
dance rather than to march through life —
it's easier, safer" — a perfect example of why
Professor Chang introduced her as someone

who fully embodied the assimilation of art
into life.
The second half of the evening com
prised of a question-and-answer session. The
topics ranged from her art to her childhood,
and she answered some honestly, and some
with a sharp, no-nonsense response. For
example, when asked, "What is the subtle,
sneaky, important reason that you are a
human being and not a chair?" she laughed
and simply responded, "I'll leave it up to a
critic like you to decide." Never one to be
fazed by others, Ono spoke candidly about
her reasons behind "Cut Piece," explaining
that "In life, we try to give what we want to
give, but instead, we give what they want to
take." When discussing her 2003 reprise of
the original 1965 performance, she explained

that she wanted to use it to
show her trust of those
around her by exposing her
self in such a vulnerable
position.
Ono also touched on her

background and family; when asked
when she first realized
she was ah artist, 1
she answered
instead about
her father — _
a banker, who,
according to Ono,
spiraled down into drinking in his
later years because he never realized
his repressed potential as a musician.
As for her childhood, she remarked
that as a result of always being under
the eye of the camera from a very
young age, she developed a "very pri
vate" side of herself that she could hide
away from her exposed self.
Throughout the question-and
answer session, Ono shared small, sim
ple pearls of wisdom regarding her
unique take on life. When asked about
her art's inspiration from life, she
replied, "I don't separate art and life. My
life is art, my art is life," and later,
described how she conquered life's
obstacles by dancing: "Dancing is a way
of dealing with life," she explained.
"Through life, you should be dancing
very carefully." She recounted a tale of a
Japanese dancing warrior, who, outnum
bered by eight enemies, fought off all their

sword blows not with his own sword, but by
moving his body nimbly so that each blade
never managed to cut him — in this way,
dancing his way out of danger.
As a final crowning moment, a large pic
ture of a vase about five feet tall was brought
onto stage along with a pile of vase shards.
Ono explained that all the shards were once
part of a vase much like the one pictured,
and that everyone in the audience should
take a piece, hold on to it, and in ten years
return to rebuild the vase together. Practical?
Not likely. Idealistic and naive? Perhaps. But
if nothing else, "Passages for Light" taught
audiences that Yoko Ono is as spirited as she
ever was, and regardless of personal opinion
about her work, should be universally
admired for her courage, energy and deter
mined faith in the human power of love.
