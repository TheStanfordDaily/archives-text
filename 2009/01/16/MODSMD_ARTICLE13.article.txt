## Ono stays in the picture 
### 
Yoko Ono does not, apparently, sleep.
The acclaimed artist, musician, inter
national peace activist and educator
spoke this week, of course, but so did she set
up her traveling Wish Tree installation, bring
the John Lennon Educational Tour Bus to
campus, and apparently have more than
enough work left over to warrant a panel dis
cussion. Once described as "the world's most
famous unknown artist" by none other than
her husband, John Lennon, it would be hard
to make the same claim now.
The fact is, while movements have come
and gone, there has always been something
charming about the simple optimism and
naivete that marks her work. Not infrequent
ly, she seems like the only figure in the mod
ern art world with an absolute faith in art's
ability to make people happy. How else can
we explain her seminal "Box of Smile" —
nothing but a box with a mirror inside it? Or,
more recently, her Wish Trees?
Installed at Tresidder and in White

Plaza, these pieces, which Ono has exhibited
from Tokyo to Finland, are simply trees on
which she encourages passersby to tie their
wishes. The idea is childish, uncomplicated,
but the results are striking: corporeality is a
word that is often used to characterize her
work, and it certainly applies here. The dwarf
trees bending under the weight of the white
scales of written desire makes a surprisingly
poignant emotional statement, even if such
an interpretation is perhaps more negative
than Ono would like.
This is not to say that everything Ono
has done since the '60s has achieved the same
measure of timelessness. Much of her music,
in particular, has aged less than gracefully as
a consequence of her ill-advised embrace of
the disco and '80s dance scenes (see, for
example, the 1985 music video for "Hell in
Paradise" for a classically unfortunate combi
nation of thin ties, canned African
polyrhythms, porn groove and midgets).
Nevertheless, as was explained at the panel

discussion Monday afternoon, her influence
on both popular and avant-garde music has
been consistently underestimated. The
Beatles' notorious "Revolution 9," for exam
ple, often cited as the most avant-garde track
ever to appear on a pop album and a classic
of the musique concrete genre, is at least par
tially Ono's brainchild. Lennon's well-known
pioneering of the scream in popular music,
the panelists argued, also owed a great deal to
his wife's interest in "raw sonic energies."
Some even went so far as to identify Ono as a
precursor to the punk movement.
Regardless of her exact contributions to
music, she has at the very least continued to
foster others' involvement in the art form
through her support of the trailblazing John
Lennon Educational Tour Bus, which visited
campus earlier this week. This remarkable
touring recording/production facility, which
packs two state-of-the-art studios and a stage
into a vehicle normally notable only for not
providing seatbelts, has as its mission the

extension of artistic opportunities to young
people and organizations that would normal
ly find it impossible to gain access to even the
most rudimentary editing equipment.
Consistently melding social conscience,
art and an enthusiasm for whimsy, Ono has
carved herself a place in the art pantheon,
whether by flashing out "Love" with a flash
light as in her "Onochord," screaming into a
mic as part of the Plastic Ono Band, or with
her most ambitious recent work — her
memorial to Lennon, the Peace Tower. Here,
at its location in Reykjavik, Iceland, she has
buried the wishes from her Wish Trees, of
which there are more than 700,000 so far,
according to her website, thereby infusing the
structure with the "energy" of the partici
pants. The idea is New Agey, slightly silly, and
undeniably winning. In short, Onoesque.
