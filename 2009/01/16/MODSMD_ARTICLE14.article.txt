# intermission? Q & A with Yoko Ono
## 
### 
Despite her busy schedule, Ono made time to
speak with writer Ellen Huet over the phone
about her trip to the Farm, her campaign for
peace and how she is transmitting that message
through light.
intermission: I would just like to thank you
so much for giving us a chance to talk about
your upcoming visit to Stanford. Do you
think you could give The Stanford Daily
some background about the projects you'll
be covering in your lecture?
Yoko Ono: [laughs] I'd prefer not to explain
about it just yet — they'll be covered in the
lecture.
i: You're going to be talking about the

Onochord and the Imagine Peace Tower.
Could you talk about the inspiration for
these two projects?
YO: Well, when you come and you sec the
stuff that I'm going to present, then you'll see
the reason why I call it "Passages for Light,"
and it has to do with several things: Imagine
Peace Tower, which is a light tower, and the
Onochord, which is a way to express — well,
a way to touch each other with light. And
through that we start to become more
together and united.
i: What do you hope these projects might
achieve in the future? What is your long-term
goal for their message?
YO: Well, it's a very, very difficult situation in
the world right now — so much violence in
the world and everything. And so, the kinds
of things I'm doing, well, most people think
that it's a little bit naive or something like
that, but what's the alternative? We have the
option of either solving problems by vio
lence, or to do the other! And I try to do the
other.

i: What kind of steps do you think the
Stanford community can take to help your
visions achieve their goals?
YO: Well, 1 think that most people who ask,
"What can we do?" — I just think that more
people — well, so there's two kinds of people
in the world: the people in the war industry,
well, believe in war — solving problems by
war or violence. And they understand each
other so much that they don't even need to
discuss it. Whereas the peace industry people
are always saying, "My way is the right way,
and your way is not quite right" — a lot of
arguments and discussion. And if they could
get together without criticizing each other
and want to make this world a peaceful
world, then we could do it. As long as we
argue about it, we can't, and until the peace
industry is as large as the war industry ...
[pause] Individual effort is very important.
And each person should think about ways to
do it. And I think it's a very interesting and
exciting age where we can all be creative, and
we have to be. And it's an age where you can
do something; and in a way, each one of us

has been given the chance to.
i: Do you envision the messages of Onochord
and the Imagine Peace Tower having an
effect on world situations like the Gaza-Israel
conflict? How can your message reach those
across the globe?
YO: Well, I'm planting the seed wherever I
go, and I go to places wherever I'm request
ed. And I do — I go to many places. I proba
bly go to 20 cities every year, and I try to
spread the message and stimulate people into
doing what they will do. I don't think that
this is a time when people can be followers.
Each person has to be really doing something
to better the world in his or her own way.
i: So you really see it as an individual
approach?
YO: If you're doing something in a corner of
the world, it affects all of us — it's affecting
everybody. And it does. Everything that we
do affects all of us. And in that sense, it's giv
ing when you do something really good, even

if it's just something small, and it does affect the whole world. You may
not exactly see the result right away, but that's how it works. And the
thing that's very nice about this, is that there's so many people in the
world, especially now, in an overpopulated world, so that you don't really
have to do everything yourself. You do what you can do. And if all of us
do what we can do — Voil&! I mean, it's just going to create a peaceful
world. It's that simple, and most people don't know that it's that simple.
i: What do you see as the most pressing issue for the world today?
YO: Well, the most pressing thing in the world is the fact that we, all of
us, are followers. Whenever something is said in the newspaper, or by a
politician, we either accept or criticize, but criticizing is also being
involved in that game and following what is being said. We don't look
into ourselves, and actually, when we look into ourselves, that's where an
incredible power lies. Each one of us is superwoman and superman. And
we don't really know that because we don't even try to find out about
that. And if we stop and look into ourselves and into our powers, it's just
going to be fantastic! [laughs] I mean, it's just going to be, okay, billions
of supermen and superwomen. It's just going to be beautiful. The most
important thing is to realize what we are and to realize how to tap into
our power and bring out things within us.
i: Some of your most well-known work takes a heuristic and instruction
al approach to interactive art. What instructions would you give to the
world to follow?
YO: [laughs] Well, I'm not giving a sort of an all-encompassing one
instruction to people. I am saying, "imagine peace." Well, imagine peace
— can we do more than that? Just think about that: If you are focusing
totally on imagining peace, at that moment, you cannot be violent or kill
people. And it's just, you know, if the whole world imagines peace, just
now, just for a little bit, it's the end of violence.
i: That's beautiful. I just wanted to thank you again; it was a great to have
this opportunity to talk with you.
YO: You're welcome; I'll see you [at the lecture].
