# First-year MFA students shine in
## first exhibit of the year 
### 
-» a school so prestigious for its aca
demic endeavors, it would seem that its

.X_ art program would suffer. However,
Stanford's Master's of Fine Arts program,
Art Practice, admits only five students
each year for intensive and intimate train
ing in four disciplines: painting, sculpture,
photography and new genres. The pro
gram allows its artists to explore each one
and as Juan Luna-Avin, a first-year student
said, "encourages you to explore."
"Very Close to Far Away," an exhibit
of work by four first-year MFA students, is
running from lan. 13 to Feb. 22 at the
Thomas Welton Stanford Art Gallery. The
students, Jeremiah Barber, Juan Luna-
Avin, Jamil Hellu and Armando Miguelez,
each present very different pieces that rep
resent all four of the disciplines that the
Art Practice program covers.
The first piece you see when entering
the gallery could be Miguelez s "Tower," a
grid of skyscrapers and tall buildings from
around the world. The piece is powerful and
overwhelming, mirroring the subjects of
each picture. None of the towers has any

relation to another, except in the fact that they
are all towers.
"Regardless of the buildings' conditions,"
Miguelez explained, "they speak of the rise
and fall of power in a broad sense."
Luna-Avin presents a series of pieces that
incorporate his Mexican background and his
love for music. Luna-Avin said that this is
typical of his usual work, because he usually
"doesn't find distinctions between culture
and life." One of his pieces is a collection of
digital prints that resemble fliers for Mexican
rock concerts. They are colorful and full of
spirit and provide a glimpse into the world
Luna-Avin grew up in. One of my favorite
parts of the exhibit was reading the names of
all the groups, be they real or fake.

Barber's piece, "In Extremis," is a video
of him and his wife dragging each other
through Death Valley. The piece is meant to
represent the common struggles of a rela
tionship, especially when one person feels
that they are doing all the work. Each person
pulls the other along the sand until they can
no longer move and then they switch places.
It is a very special representation of the rocky
times in relationships and it gives inspiration
because when one person feels like they can
no longer continue, the other takes their
place to make the relationship work.
In a conversation with the artist, I was
alerted to another interpretation of the piece.
The dragged figures seem lifeless, and so the
struggle can represent the burden of carrying
the loss of a loved one. Either way, the piece

is a novel concept and definitely shows
promise for the young artist.
Finally, Hellu presents a series of photo
graphs that deal with stereotypes in our cul
ture of men showing each other affection.
The piece is called "Subjects Unknown" and
features two men in different positions look
ing at the camera and is meant to conjure up
the viewer's own assumptions of the men's
sexualities and identities.
The exhibit is very interesting and it is
great to see the artistic side of Stanford. It's
pretty quick to walk through and can be visited
in an uncomfortable gap between classes.
Though only first-year student work is
on display, the Art Practice MFA program is
two years long. One thing that makes
Stanford's program really special, Barber said

is the ability for each of the first- and
second-year students to have their
own studio. As opposed to other pro
grams, these studios are completely
exclusive and provide each artist with
an environment where their creativity
can truly flourish without the inter
ference of other artists.
The program boasts an impressive five
professors (and is looking at hiring
another), meaning a very intimate fac
ulty-student interaction provides each
of the 10 total students very personal
and constructive feedback on each of
their projects. Students have the power
to start projects that take a substantial
amount of time, and because the stu
dents each have their own studio, these
projects can continually be worked on
over the course of the program without
any hindrance or interruption.
According to Luna-Avin, "the time just
flows better."
In addition to the focused attention
on students, the program has the

ability to invite many famous and inspira
tional artists and critics to help the students
become immersed in the art world. This
week, the talks include Brett Reichman and
Clarence Morgan. This is great because it
allows each artist to see what his or her artis
tic futures could be. Not surprisingly, many
of the artists plan to continue studio work in
the future. Luna-Avin is planning to apply for
some fellowships, although he joked, "I hope
they'll still be around with the economy the
way it is." Though many aspire to be artists,
most of the students would like to teach art
in the future, whether in elementary schools
or in upper education.
