# Caribbean spice... and laid-back service
## 
### 
During a dreary Stanford winter,
sunny skies and warm weather can
seem like a far-too-distant fantasy.
For a brief respite from the reality of cold,
rain and work, a tempting place to visit
might be Mango Caribbean Bar and
Restaurant in Downtown Palo Alto. Despite
being only a block off of University Avenue,
the quiet location at 435 Hamilton Avenue
seems far off the beaten path.
The space does a good job of creating a
distinctly Caribbean atmosphere with fish
nets hanging from the ceiling, tropical
themed decor on the walls, beach umbrellas
and a bar that would fit in on the shores of
some exotic island. The colorful shirts worn
by the cheery staff also complement the
atmosphere.
Mango offers food and drink menus
with a number of tempting options appro
priate for the island theme. Drinks include
mixed classics like Pina Coladas and
Daiquiris, as well as Red Stripe beer from

Jamaica. Food offerings include a number of
easily sharable appetizers as well as soups,
salads, sandwiches and entrees which run up
to $17. Common themes throughout the
menu include jerk chicken, avocado, mango,
shrimp and other seafood.
Our friendly waitress took our drink
orders in a timely manner, but the drinks
took inexplicably long to arrive considering
we were in sight of the bartender who did
not have a backlog on an obviously slow
Tuesday night. When the drinks did arrive,
they were hardly worth the wait. The most
obvious ingredient in the banana daiquiri
did not seem to be banana nor rum nor
sugar, but ice. It had just enough banana to
avoid being sent back, but that is hardly a
lofty standard.
After ordering food, the appetizer also
took a surprisingly long time to arrive.
Although the codfish fritters ($6.50) provid
ed a generous serving of fish that was
extremely well-spiced on the inside, they

were vaguely soggy and lacked a good, crispy
exterior.
The sandwiches also had their pros and
cons. Priced around seven dollars and served
with salad and rice and beans, the price was
hard to beat. The jerk chicken in one of the
sandwiches was good, and while the mango
chicken in the other tasted fine, it was
unclear what relationship it had to mango.
Furthermore, the meat being served at or
slightly above room temperature left me to
wonder whether or not the lack of heat was
intentional.
Sadly, the avocado, which was a key
ingredient in both sandwiches, was in short
supply, and the three layers of sourdough
bread seemed fresh out of the bag from
Safeway — lacking even an attempt at toast
ing or any other distinguishing qualities. But
to give credit where credit is due, the rice and
beans on the side were excellent and the
greens in the salad were well-selected and
dressed lightly but sufficiently. Of course, this

plate, like the drinks and fritters, took far too
long to arrive.
Going into Mango, I really wanted to
like it. It has a fun, relaxed atmosphere, the
people are friendly and it offers a relatively
unique menu. But combining the mediocre
drinks with soggy fritters and cold sandwich
es topped off by excruciatingly slow service
left my desire to like it as nothing more than
a desire. With its good prices and colorful
decor, it's probably not impossible to have a
good dining experience at Mango, but I will
not be rushing back.
