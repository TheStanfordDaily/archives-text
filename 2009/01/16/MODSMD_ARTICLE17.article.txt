# FiLM REVIEW
## Is wrinkly romance a no-go? "Harvey" almost seems to think so 
### 
cc -w- ast Chance Harvey" is the sort of
bland romantic flick you wouldn't
watching on an airplane,
slightly buzzed on icky, in-flight Chardonnay.
Even if your complimentary headphones were
to screw up the audio, the dialogue is so quo
tidian and miss-able that you could easily fill
it in yourself. But at least you'd get to watch
Emma Thompson and Dustin Hoffman —
two infinitely delightful pros — make the
most of a dull script as they add some sparkle

to writer/director Joel Hopkins' plod
ding plot: Two oldies fall in love,
despite the odds!
Deep in the winter of his discon
tent, our hero Harvey Shine
(Hoffman) is a silver-haired
American jingle-writer who once
dreamed of being a jazz pianist, but
couldn't hack it. In the midst of job
troubles, Shine flies to London for his
estranged daughter's wedding, where
he's required to make nice with his
ex-wife and her smooth new spouse.
Harvey is hapless, tired, fond of the
booze and pretty much alone. Poor
Harvey! Poor Dustin! (It should be
noted, incidentally, that the 71-year
old Hoffman is wearing his age very
well.)
Meanwhile, the London-dwelling
Kate Walker (luminous British screen
goddess Thompson) is busy placating
her needy, paranoid mother (Eileen
Atkins) and handing out passenger

questionnaires at Heathrow. For no dis
cernible reason, Kate is still single and stuck in
a mind-numbing job, despite the fact that
she's brainy, witty and completely gorgeous.
We know she's unique and imaginative, too,
since she's taking a creative writing class on
the side. (This clearly points to deep depths in
her soul.)
But alas, life's a persistent bitch. Kate gets
stuck on a humiliating blind date with a sev
eral-decades-younger gentleman, while
Harvey shows up at his daughter's rehearsal

dinner in a wrinkly white linen suit, pesky
anti-theft tag still attached. Though both
Harvey and Kate clearly deserve better, they're
each floundering in a sea of people who hard
ly appreciate them, so it's a relief when the two
finally, inevitably connect with each other
over drinks at an airport bar.
Hoffman and Thompson make a strange,
but not entirely repellant, screen couple; she
towers over him, there's a 20-year age gap
between them, and they don't quite have the

sex chemistry thing going. But their respective
thespian-genius talents are nevertheless at
play in this film, despite the fact that both
actors are largely under-challenged and
under-utilized. British screenwriter/director
loel Hopkins ("lump Tomorrow") reportedly
tailor-wrote these roles for Hoffman and
Thompson, but it seems like Hopkins is some
thing of a cataract-plagued tailor equipped
with an erratic sewing machine.
But no matter how oddly matched this
couple is, it's clear where "Last Chance

Harvey" is headed. Of course, of course, of
course Harvey and Kate are going to cross
paths, match wits, fall head over heels and end
up ambling dreamily along the Thames
together forever and ever. Why, otherwise,
would we be watching these two later-in-life
singletons? Since Harvey and Kate's couple
hood is a foregone conclusion, we're meant to
enjoy the ride, but "Last Chance Harvey" is
often slightly depressing.
The film sets itself up as a grand old

romantic comedy, com
plete with an oddball
couple, wacky mother
in-law, bitchy ex-wife,
hilarious airport deba
cles, hints of kismet, etc.
But "Last Chance
Harvey" castrates itself,
humor-wise, by slapping
a wistful, irritating

soundtrack on top of almost every risible
moment. Plus, the whole movie is shot in dis

tinctly mature colors — one is reminded of a
dark, joyless Pier 1 aesthetic. Why must a
romance of the autumn years be shot in
autumnal shades?
Almost every potentially exuberant, gig
gly or sexy scene is gunned down by the
gloomy soundtrack, dusty color palate or
zombie-style droning screenplay. Have the
elderly no hope? Is this truly, in the immortal
words of Donna Summer, the last chance for
romance? Does being older and desperate

obviate the potential for witty, quirky,
charming dialogue? Apparently so.
Respites from the dullness include
Kate's attempt to teach Harvey about
the Brits' stiff upper lips, plus an 80-
something man in Kate's writing class
who reads from his gory "psychosex
ual" thriller, plus Kate and Harvey's
endearing dress-shopping scene, fol
lowed by their tripping the light fan
tastic at Harvey's daughter's wedding.
How joyous! If only the whole film
could be this way.
Unfortunately, the movie spends
most of its 92 minutes trying to hit
obligatory plot points and explain
how two slightly wrinkled souls can
knit their destinies together within
the space of a weekend. The film
spans only a few days, as though
Hopkins were eager to get the whole

thing over with, but one wishes it
would skip along through a few
weeks — maybe then, we'd be
privy to some more charming
conversations. But at least, in
spite of it all, we can revel in
Hoffman and Thompson's ample
screen time. These two thespian
greats, even when they're fed
bland, oatmeal-y dialogue, are
always — thank goodness — a
miraculous pleasure to watch.

moment. Plus, the whole movie is shot in dis

tinctly mature colors — one is reminded of a
dark, joyless Pier 1 aesthetic. Why must a
romance of the autumn years be shot in
autumnal shades?
Almost every potentially exuberant, gig
gly or sexy scene is gunned down by the
gloomy soundtrack, dusty color palate or
zombie-style droning screenplay. Have the
elderly no hope? Is this truly, in the immortal
words of Donna Summer, the last chance for
romance? Does being older and desperate

obviate the potential for witty, quirky,
charming dialogue? Apparently so.
Respites from the dullness include
Kate's attempt to teach Harvey about
the Brits' stiff upper lips, plus an 80-
something man in Kate's writing class
who reads from his gory "psychosex
ual" thriller, plus Kate and Harvey's
endearing dress-shopping scene, fol
lowed by their tripping the light fan
tastic at Harvey's daughter's wedding.
How joyous! If only the whole film
could be this way.
Unfortunately, the movie spends
most of its 92 minutes trying to hit
obligatory plot points and explain
how two slightly wrinkled souls can
knit their destinies together within
the space of a weekend. The film
spans only a few days, as though
Hopkins were eager to get the whole

thing over with, but one wishes it
would skip along through a few
weeks — maybe then, we'd be
privy to some more charming
conversations. But at least, in
spite of it all, we can revel in
Hoffman and Thompson's ample
screen time. These two thespian
greats, even when they're fed
bland, oatmeal-y dialogue, are
always — thank goodness — a
miraculous pleasure to watch.
