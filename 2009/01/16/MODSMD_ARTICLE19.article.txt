# "The Powder Room"

The first play of three, "The Powder Room," confronts a potentially touching rela
tionship between a rich golfer and his well-educated chauffeur, but fails to con
vey the full impact of its own plot. The script, written by Samantha Toh, is torn
between two possibilities: a scandal-ridden farce set in a ritzy men's bathroom at the
local country club, or an analysis of how social classes keep us apart. By attempting to
accomplish both, the production doesn't entirely deliver on either option.
The script opens in a full blast of comedy, with the low-brow but giggle-worthy
urination jokes one expects from a play called "The Powder Room." Steve (Wyatt Roy)
runs witty circles around his companion, Jesse (Jamio Cornejo), as they ponder who

would build such a needlessly fancy
room for men, and why Steve's per
fect society wife has an overwhelm
ing desire to involve kitchen utensils
in their sex life.
The jokes are funny, but the seri
ous discussion of secrecy at the end
of the play rings hollow, lacking sym
pathetic characters and a solid back
ground. If "The Powder Room" were
told as a pure farce without an awk
ward moral, or if it revealed from the
beginning its intentions of social jus
tice, the story would be far more
compelling. In his director's note,
Kip Hustace writes,"[The play] asks:
What should you hide from others?
How much can you hide from oth
ers? And ultimately, why does it have
to be this way?" The play hints at, but
never quite answers his questions.
