# An early draft of Obama's inaugural speech

My fellow citizens,
Today we celebrate the greatness of America. We celebrate
the greatness of democracy. We celebrate the greatness in
ourselves. We are a great people. You are a great person.
Everyone here is great. How are you feeling? Great. Me
too. This is so great. Gee, what a great day.
The historic nature of this event does not escape me.
I am well aware of the significance this holds for many
Americans, many of whom have waited half a century or
more to see this day come. This is truly one of the most
historic moments of our time. Let's not shy away from it.
Let us come together and make more history.
1 have seen the lack of history in the making. I have
seen people go to frequently visited spots and perform
common or routine activities. I have seen people almost
file a complaint, but then check their email and forget to
do so. I have seen people watch a lot of mediocre televi
sion. lam not speaking figuratively. For my 11th birthday
I received a telescope.
This was not the America I thought I knew. This was
not the America of George Washington or Abraham
Lincoln, those great pillars of history. This was not the
America that Martin Luther King Jr. dreamed about.
Martin Luther King dreamed of an America where little
children held the hands of other little children without
regard for their gender or skin color. He dreamed that
America would endure a massive geological disturbance,
turning valleys into hills and leveling mountains com-

pletely. He dreamed that Mississippi would be completely
flooded. This was a historic vision, much of which has
already come to pass. (As for the rest, we should all
update our earthquake kits and prepare for massive evac
uations.)
Now this is my vision, America: that one day all
Americans and un-Americans will live in harmony with
nature and each other. In my dream, most of the cars only
have three wheels except for a few which have six. China
has built many cities underwater. Juggling is extremely
popular.
But I am only one man, and I can only do the dream
ing of one man. We must all ask ourselves, now more
than ever, what is a dream that I have for my country?
What is a dream that I have for myself? What is your
dream, America? Speak up. Let it ring from every hill and
molehill. Let it ring from every mountainside. Tell us
about your dreams of being a doctor. Tell us about your
dreams of renewable energy. Tell us about your dreams of
flying, or the one where you wind up at work with no
clothes on. Tell us about that time you were backpacking
across New Zealand and unexpectedly ran into your fifth
grade teacher, as well as the entire cast of "Friends."
Can we dream of a new America? Can we make these
dreams a reality? Yes and yes, America. We can and we
can.
