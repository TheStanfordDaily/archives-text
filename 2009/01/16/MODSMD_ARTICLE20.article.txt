# "Heat"
## 
### 
In telling the story of a pregnant Hispanic teenager from L.A. with an unfeel
ing older sister, an incarcerated boyfriend, an angry father and no mother at
all, it is understandably easy to stray into stereotype. "Heat," pleasingly, avoids
this trap when telling a story rife with these pitfalls. Instead, it presents Gaby (the
pregnant teen, played by Grace Mandler) and her sister Tania (Grace Um) sym
pathetically, especially in showing Tania's conflicted emotions over her sister's
pregnancy.
The story is not entirely smooth â€” once or twice a plot twist is introduced
with no warning, and the characters tend to vacillate between wild extremes of

emotion, inducing sympathetic
whiplash in those watching. One of
the most touching moments of the
play, however, is an unexpected
twist, as the father of the unborn
child reads aloud a letter he's written
to her mother. Despite every predic
tion within the play, and every
stereotype of incarcerated fathers
to-be, Edgar (Avinash Achaibar)
promises to come home and start
their family as soon as he gets out of
jail, and predicts that their child will
be a girl. Though it's perhaps an
overly hopeful view of how Gaby's
life will be, "Heat" creates genuine
goodwill towards its characters, and
I found myself believing that Gaby
and Edgar would transcend their
stereotype and succeed.
