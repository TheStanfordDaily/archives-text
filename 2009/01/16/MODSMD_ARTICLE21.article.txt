# "Bloodsong"
## 
### 
CC T ts a choreo-poem," Liesl Spitz, producer of the
I One Acts, told me when I asked her about
.1. Bloodsong. The piece defies definition, so a short
description will have to suffice: Six women will be shot
tomorrow morning for ill-defined "war crimes." Over the
course of the show, they collectively and individually
describe their ideas about fighting and war. Speaking and
moving in unison, they present a front of women against a
world of masculine fighting. Identified only by their roles,
the Oracle and the Gypsy sing us the Bloodsong — a song
passed down in our blood from our ancestors, but also a

song about bloodshed. The piece is breathtaking: incredi
bly well written, choreographed, acted and sung. Though
not a standard one-act by any stretch, the piece is a fasci
natingly well-crafted exploration of women and war.
Each woman speaks to us individually, usually to tell
us why she began fighting the status quo. The Student tells
us that she ignored the terror as it began to grow in her
country, claiming that she was "hiding in libraries, on side
walks, in the velvet underbelly of the opera house." She
joins the freedom fighters to assuage her guilt at her own
blindness.
The Oracle, who is physically blind, tells us that she
was born knowing that the people she had come to save
would eventually put her to death. The Gypsy says little

but sings the Bloodsong at the end of the play, and the end
of her life.
Every woman has a unique story, all of which they
share over their last night alive. When dawn is breaking,
the Anarchist wonders if her motivation of love justifies
her acts of violence. When great evil is confronted with
great love, she asks us, "How can there be any other
choice?" She means her question seriously, not rhetorically
— when facing her death, she wants to know if there was
any other course of action she could have taken. In the
most disturbing moment of the evening, the play hears her
desperation but fails to answer her. She dies with her com
rades, taking her questions with her.
