# It may be cold outside, but it's getting hot in here!
## Roxy encourages readers to turn up the heat this winter 
### 
Baby, it's cold outside — time to heat up under the covers
with another smolderingly sexy body. Winter is without a
doubt my favorite time of year. There's nothing like a
cutie and a Hot Toddy to get me feeling particularly cozy (espe-

dally if one serves me the other in bed ... ). Steaming
things up between the sheets is a marvelous replace-

ment for that nasty heating bill, and leagues more
fun. And the warming effects of alcohol provide a
convenient excuse to empty that second bottle of

wine — it's survival!
The need to stay toasty is a lovely impetus
for intimacy, and dorm ski trips are notori
ous for stirring up that primal desire in
weekend revelers. Wet and freezing from a day

of plummeting down snowy mountains, deliri
ous from exhaustion, desperate to get out of those

sopping garments, students fall under the blankets and
are bound to discover the toe-curling benefits of a night com-

panion. Shivering, an unsuspecting couple inches closer and
closer ... an arm wraps around a waist... lips touch ... bodies
press .. . the temperature rises ... and — voila! — clothes are

no longer necessary for warmth! Add just the right amount of
collegiate intoxication, and this winter love fest cannot be
stopped. Why ski when so much pleasure is to be had indoors?
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow!

So while some may be missing the shirtless hunks and
bikini-clad hotties of summer, remember that chilly

weather makes it that much easier to lure a willing
victim into your bed and give "coming in from
the cold" a whole new meaning. Add some addi-

tional sizzle with a bathtub soak and hot oil
massage, or heat up some "hot chocolate" for
yummy foreplay. Outerwear may not seem
alluring at first, but all of those layers make for a
delightful striptease! You never know what deli-

cious lacy thing may be hiding beneath that big,
wool trench coat.
