"Coming of Age," hosted by the Stanford
African Students Association (SASA).
"This is the first time SASA has ever
had a film festival," said Organizing

show different aspects of being
young, figuring out your identity
and how much culture influences
that identity."
An enthusiastic audience of stu
dents and community members
gathered in the cozy setting of the
Bechtel International Center to
enjoy snacks and a big screen. Many
expressed interest in returning for
later showings.
SASA collaborated with a num
ber of departments and student
groups, and after much deliberation,
five films, one each from Morocco,
South Africa, Sierra Leone, Burkina
Faso and Mauritania have been
selected for screening between lan.
15 and Feb. 5. Most of the films will
be aired at the Bechtel International

Center, but in a special arrangement
with FLiCKS, the film "Sarafina" will
play this Sunday night, lan. 19, at 7 p.m.
in Memorial Auditorium.
"If you've never seen an African
film, 'Sarafina' is a classic," Teklu said.
The movie, a musical from South Africa,
stars Whoopi Goldberg and chronicles
the lives of students involved in the
Soweto Riots, in opposition to apartheid
during the 19705.
Admission is free, and snacks are
provided at all of the screenings. Each

movie is followed by a brief panel led by
student and faculty moderators from
various departments.
"Anyone and everyone who wants
to learn more about African issues,
including culture, society, anything
should come," Teklu said.
