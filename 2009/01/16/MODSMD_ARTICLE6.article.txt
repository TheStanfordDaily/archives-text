# If you are preppy...

Try pairing a classic pencil skirt that is fitted
through the hips and legs, with a colorful sweater to
brighten up a traditional outfit. If it's chilly out,

like it may be in the Bay Area, layer with
a fitted blazer. Add strappy heels to
elongate your legs and move into
spring.
This season, you can't go wrong
with nautical prints. Red, white and
blue in a slim A-line outfit with big
gold buttons is exactly what this sea
son's prepsters are looking for. White
I shoes will make your outfit pop, and
this spring, find cutout booties to
pair with any nautical piece. Jewelry

with an anchor motif is also something
big on the trendy horizon.
