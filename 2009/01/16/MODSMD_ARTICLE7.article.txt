# If you are girly...

Get used to winter's feminine Victorian
trend, as it's going to stick around through
spring as well. Pull out a lacy or ruffled top and
layer with thin, pastel, cotton tanks. Pair with
washed and very worn denim, whether it be a
skirt, shorts or jeans. The lighter the wash, the
better. Holes are entirely acceptable, if not
encouraged. Belt your baggy denim with a pretty
ribbon, and throw on a blazer or breezy trench
coat. Floral accessories go incredibly well with
this look.
Florals arc also a staple in this season's
repertoire. Floral, breezy skirts paired with a
light, loose tank are nothing but flirty and femi
nine. Pastel-colored sneakers add a laidback,
sweet touch. Accessorize with heart-shaped jew
elry and floral bags.
