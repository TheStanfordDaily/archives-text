Looking ahead to spring, neon is back.
But why not start setting trends early? Try
combining two trends at once; pair bright col
ors with the active look. Use a classic khaki
skirt (ideally with pleats) to contrast a big,
baggy neon green sweater. Pair with neon
socks and springtime sneaks (i.e. Keds) and
you have an '80s throwback look that is
incredibly hip. This trend isn't exclusively for
spring; brighten up gray winter with these
neon colors.
Funk-chic is going back to its roots this
season. Studs are perfect to accessorize with
denim and a basic top. Whether it is a studded
bracelet, necklace or chunky belt, studs aren't
reserved for the frequenters of Hot Topic any
more. However, make sure to not go over
board. Pick your studs accordingly. Make your
outfit pop with splashes of red, and if you
want to go all out, splurge on a pair of black,
edgy heels or wedges.

For any and all fashion types-
Try transitioning your winter pieces into spring easily with these tips.

1 â€¢ Wear your new, open-toed heels with dark socks, keeping your feet warm and showing off your new shoes.
2. When wearing a new spring dress, include a pair of maroon tights. The new color is fresh, and more flattering than black.
3. If you are wearing a short skirt, or new pairs of shorts, wear a pair of tall boots with knee socks underneath, peeking out at the top.
