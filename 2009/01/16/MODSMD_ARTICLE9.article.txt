Take a leaf out of the punky girl's look. Whether
going to the gym, or out to browse University
Avenue, bright colors are eye-catching and definitely
something to wear this winter and spring. Look for
baggy sweatshirts in pastels (easily found at stores
like American Apparel) and wear over running tights
of any color. If you can find neon or highlighter, be
bold and go for those. Wear with fun sneakers of any
color. Make it super-hip by finding metallic sneakers.
A way to look classically cute and show off your
personality, while staying comfortable and looking
athletic, is to wear your favorite sports team tee (Go
Cardinal!) with a fitted pair of boot-cut jeans. Layer
your tec over a thermal of any color to add a pop to
your simple outfit, stand out and stay warm. A great
addition is a pair of cute sneakers that have some
flair. If you don't feel like showing team spirit, any
screen-print tec with a message or picture will make
your outfit a statement.
