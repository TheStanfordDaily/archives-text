Rebecca Slayton
Lecturer in the Science, Technology, and Society Program and
PAffliate of the Center for International Security and Cooperation
Rebecca Slayton researches and writes about the sociological history of science and
technology. She conducted her doctoral research and writing in physical chemistry, and
has worked as a science journalist, so our conversation will range across very different
types of writing. Her current research focuses primarily on how technical judgments
are generated, taken up, and given significance in international security contexts. She is
currently working on a book Proving Improbability: Physics, Computing, and Missile
Defense, 1949-89 and an article "Laser-Sharp Visions? Precision, Futurism, and Laser
M Development in the United States, 1958-1988." Publications in Science and Technology
Studies (STS) include "Speaking as Scientists: Computer Professionals in the Star Wars
Debate," "Discursive Choices: Boycotting' Star Wars' Between Science and Activism,"
and "Revolution and Resistance: Rethinking Power in Computing History." As a physical
chemist, she developed ultrafast laser experiments in condensed matter systems and
published several articles in physics journals.
