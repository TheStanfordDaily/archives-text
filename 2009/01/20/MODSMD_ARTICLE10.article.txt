## Editorial Stanford, Musharraf and the value of discourse 
### 
This past Friday at Memorial Auditori
um, the ASSLJ Speaker's Bureau and
Stanford in Government — in con
junction with a host of other campus organi
zations — presented Pervez Musharraf, the
former Pakistani head of state, for their an
nual "Big Speaker" series. Following his con
tested rise to presidency in 2001. Musharraf
played a central role in global counter-ter
rorism efforts and Indian-Pakistani rela
tions, at the same time drawing controversy
in international politics.
After delivering a nearly 55-minute
speech that highlighted the importance of
combating terrorism, resolving political
strife in the Middle East and South Asia and
other issues, Musharraf faced a question
and-answer session with the Stanford com
munity. No sooner had the microphones
been turned on did the cat-calls start flying.
Enraged Indian nationalists and other emo
tionally charged students questioned every
thing from the legitimacy of Musharrafs
rule to the inherent corruption of the Pak
istani government. The end result was ulti
mately a back-and-forth between strong
willed, would-be inquisitors and an equally
defiant, finger-wagging Musharraf.
This event is but the most recent manifes
tation of the problem with enlightened and
civil discourse on campus. As one of the
leading educational institutions worldwide,
Stanford is a repository for diverse opinions,
ideologies and global outlooks. Oftentimes,
as evidenced by the Musharraf question
and-answer session, these beliefs conflict in
less-than-subtle ways.
As far removed as the Farm seems from
events in the real world, too often do issues
of national and global import trickle down
into fiery dorm list exchanges. The recent
strife in Gaza has highlighted the uneasy re
lationship between Israeli- and Palestinian
leaning student organizations on campus.
The 2008 election cycle deeply shook the
psyche of student life, from the accusations
of viciousness in the Democratic primaries
to the outrage over the passage of Prop. 8.

Many hold particularly strong beliefs on
these issues, yet the climate has not always
been conducive to certain parts of the popu
lation effectively articulating positions not
shared by a majority of the student body.
The editorial board in no way advocates
the curtailing of dissent or an environment
that values diluted, politically correct tripe as
a means to address complex issues. Rather, in
coordination with the educational mission of
this university, we endorse a campus culture
that provides for the free and civil exchange
of varied beliefs in a non-threatening setting
that encourages intellectual stimulation and
growth. Too often do we find tumultuous
subjects reduced to shouting matches, in
which each side tries to drown out the other
in a sea of impassioned remarks.This does lit
tle to perpetuate an atmosphere in which dis
agreement is celebrated.
The University is often held up as a cen
tral place where personal beliefs are chal
lenged and redefined, where exposure to di
verse ways of thinking expands one's per
spective. It is thus ironic that many students
interested in civil discussion may shy away
from thorny topics for fear of instigating
conflict in the dining hall, on the chat list or
in emails to The Daily. Shouting matches,
electronic or otherwise, not only contribute
little to debate but also create an intellectu
ally stifling atmosphere for those hoping to
foster authentic debate.
Musharraf is no doubt an immensely con
troversial figure, and his presence should
have rightfully sparked an intense and
thoughtful discussion on the state of South-
Asian geo-politics and the current state of
counter-terrorism. Just as the Gaza conflict
and the presidential election have brought
opposite ideologies to a head, we should not
balk at the prospect of lively debate. If we
prize our reputation as a world-class institu
tion, it is incumbent upon us a student body
to argue for our beliefs, but in a way that is
more in line with the values of Stanford and
less comparable to cable television news sta
tions.
