## Why is the inauguration so important? 
### 
All over Facebook and my email
inbox, everyone seems to be either
attending or hosting some sort of an
inauguration party or event. Stanford stu
dents seem thrilled at the prospect of watch
ing the elaborate political theater that we're
all going to see today. Some students are even
in Washington. D.C for the inauguration.
The inauguration marks the last day of
the Obama insurgency. From this day for
ward. he becomes the Man, the Establish
ment. For Stanford students as well, today is
the final day to celebrate the Change and
Hope that took down the Clinton machine
and the Republicans. From this day forward,
promises will be broken, Obama will disap
point at times and he will govern (thankful
ly) from the center. Environmentalists will
be disappointed as cap-and-trade takes a
backseat to health care, the economy,
Afghanistan and a host of other issues. Pro-
Palestinian activists will be disappointed
that he will support Israel to the level that
previous presidents have (Jimmy Carter ex
cluded). Free traders ... well, let's hope he
signs the Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement
(KORUS FTA) before the economy gets
any worse. The St. Petersburg Times has col
lected 498 promises he made on the cam
paign trail. If he even fulfills a third of them,
that will be an accomplishment.The inaugu
ration is the true beginning of Obama as a
political figure.
It is apparent to me — and it seems to no
one else on this campus — that Obama is a
politician. Yes, he might be exceptionally
bright and talented, but he's still a politician.
The inauguration is a political event, like
most everything else he has done and will do
in office. He wants to get re-elected in 2012.
He wants to keep the big Democratic ma
jorities in Congress. Obama's rhetoric of bi
partisanship since being elected has been
impressive and inspiring, but he will only be
bipartisan as long as it suits him politically.
Once Republicans see opportunities to give
him political defeats, they will do so and un
leash vitriol on a level comparable to what
Obama said during the campaign against
Republicans.
What concerns me most about Stanford
students' obsession with the inauguration is
what concerned me most about their atti
tude toward Obama in the first place.
Obama supporters seemed to have such a

fervent belief that Obama, upon election,
would solve all of the country's problems.
Witness the hundreds of students who had
that red-and-blue Obama picture as their
Facebook profile photo, or the endless repe
tition of the word "change." It was Obama as
a symbol, not Obama as a politician.
Stanford students engaged in a low-level
form of politics — fervently supporting a po
litical candidate — without engaging in any
thing more sophisticated, such as criticizing
Obama, realizing his limitations or taking po
sitions in opposition to his platform. Stanford
students really did have an absolute belief in
Obama as the man who would fix all of the
wrongs. The inauguration, then, represents
the final, dramatic transference of the trust
and support of Stanford students to Presi
dent Obama. He is now President of the
United States: mission accomplished. He can
take it from here. Now that we have wit
nessed his ascendance to power, we can stop
paying attention to politics because he will
solve every problem for us.
This thinking cannot be any more wrong.
Obama alone cannot solve this country's
problems. I was proud to vote for Obama in
this election, but I also know that he will not
solve everything, and may not solve prob
lems in the way that I want them solved. We
must have our own political beliefs and keep
them separate from President Obama's
agenda.The inauguration, then.should mark
our treatment of Obama as a president,
rather than a candidate.
The inauguration will be a great piece of
political theater, to be sure, and I will be
watching it along with everyone else. Hut the
election of my favored candidate is not an
excuse to stop paying attention to politics or
blindly support what he does. Even worse, it
is not an excuse to think that political theater
is anything more than that. We must put
Obama in perspective, for our sakes as well
as his.
