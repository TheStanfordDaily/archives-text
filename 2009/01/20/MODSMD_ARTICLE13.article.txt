## Getting out of the Bubble 
### 
The feeling doesn't happen right after
you return, but it's bound to sneak up
on you when you're not expecting it. At
first you are not sure entirely how to interpret
it, but you know something seems slightly
amiss. You feel like somehow the world has
changed while you were gone, but you soon re
alize that it was the other way around. The
world stayed the same, but you are different.
I was fortunate enough to spend last March
to September abroad in Berlin, and I had the
time of my life. The exposure to a new culture
and people.as well as the newfound connection
I forged with the city, country and my paternal
grandparents, will remain forever with me.
I expected coming back to Stanford this
past fall would be difficult, mostly because
everyone I spoke to told me it would be. There
is no doubt the adjustment has been a signifi
cant one, and for a number of reasons, return
ing to campus has been a surprisingly enjoy
able experience. There is still something miss
ing, however, and it took me a while to discov
er what that something is.
During Thanksgiving Break, I was hanging
out with my friend Jake, who had studied in
Florence from January to June (and with
whom I had various escapades throughout Eu
rope during our overlapping time there). As
our conversation turned to our time abroad,
Jake said something that struck me.
"What I miss most about being gone "Jake
said, "was that the entire time I was abroad. I
felt like I was on an adventure. And now, even
though I'm still in college, in a strange way the
adventure feels over."
And just like that, Jake had pinpointed it.
That was it.That was the feeling.
Life at Stanford is, all things considered.

easy. Yes, we do have to worry about problem
sets, midterms and finals; we have our student
groups,and we all have our personal issues. But
for the most part, we attend Camp Stanford.
Sometimes, though, easy isn't what you
want. Sometimes, you feel like you would
rather just get away from it all, if only for a few
moments, and get on the other side of the Stan
ford Bubble, where real challenges, real adven
ture and a real feeling of being alive await you.
The issue, of course, is inertia. Stanford has
provided us with everything we need for our
four-year sojourn. You want food? Here's a
dining hall. You want exercise? Campus drive
surrounds you. A job? A bevy of opportunities
await. Starting a new club? Just sign here, and
there is your pile of money. A party? Here is
the same one masked behind different cos
tumes, every single week.
We use the term "bubble" generously here
at Stanford, but perhaps that is because there is
an element of truth to it. California presents us
with some of the greatest assortments of natu
ral (and in some parts of Southern California,
disturbingly unnatural) beauty in the world.
Crissy Field in San Francisco, the beaches of
Half Moon Bay and Santa Cruz, the wharf in
Monterey, the romance of Carmel. the nature
of Yoscmite and the fake breasts of Los Ange
les all abound. And yet, even with all these op
portunities for adventure, the only place Stan
ford students go with any regularity is Tahoe
(mostly, of course, because Stanford sponsors
the trip and provides the buses). More often
than not, we spend our free time and weekends
within the confines of our little Stanford world,
never realizing that the wonder of greater Cal
ifornia is just waiting to be explored.
Of course, not all students own cars, and

those that do may not care to spend all that
money on gas, even with prices as low as they
currently are. With this understanding. I am
hopeful that the Stanford administration
might consider putting together a series of trips
that expose us students to the rich culture of
the state that surrounds the Bubble — a state
which, as a California native. I have grown to
love for its unparalleled diversity of experience
and complexity, and one I wish more of my
classmates could truly discover for themselves.
But until that happens, my buddy Jake and
I have developed our own solution.That night
during Thanksgiving Break, we decided we
would not allow California to slip through our
hands any longer, and so we formed a group.
We call it JAMPAC — the Jake and Mark
Public Adventure Coalition. It is unrecog
nized, receives no funding and frankly only ex
ists because Jake and 1 say it does. But our sen
timent is real, and our premise simple: every
week, we go on a new adventure somewhere in
California. So far. we have two members. But
anyone can join, and we are looking to grow.
Some claim that you have to take advan
tage of college before the real world hits. But
coming back from my time abroad has made
me realize that it is the real world you have to
take advantage of before you no longer have
the time.
