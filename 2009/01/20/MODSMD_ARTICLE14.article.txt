## Terrorism and the duplicity of Mr. Musharraf 
### 
When the ex-"president" of Pakistan
Pervez Musharraf spoke last Friday
at Stanford, he called for a holistic
understanding on the root causes and solu
tions to terrorism. He claimed that terrorism
has its origins in illiteracy, poverty and politi
cal conflicts in the Muslim world. He said that
the solution to terrorism lies in alleviating
these problems, in addition to combating ter
rorists through military campaigns.
As a Stanford student who has lived in
Pakistan and is currently researching the psy
chological and political roots of terrorism
under Prof. Robert Sapolsky, I feel com
pelled to point out disagreements between
Musharraf s explanations for terrorism and
the academic literature on the subject. And
despite the many well-intentioned proposi
tions Musharraf gave on Friday, it is impor
tant to expose the blatant hypocrisy of such
claims with his own political record.
Throughout his talk, Musharraf consis
tently emphasized that the root of terrorism
lies in illiteracy and poverty. And while illiter
acy and poverty may certainly contribute to
terrorism, an explanation based on these fac
tors alone offers an over-simplification of the
terrorist phenomenon. A more appropriate
account of terrorism stems from understand
ing it as violent form of political protest, and
not an ideology that uneducated people are
"brainwashed" into. In general, the victims of
poverty are too busy figuring out how to get
by from day to day to act upon any indigna
tion they may harbor as a result of their
socio-economic predicaments.
According to a wealth of political litera
ture, it is actually the elite who have driven
political uprisings in the past given their in
creased access to resources, time and ability
to strategically analyze socio-economic in
justices. Indeed, the leadership of groups
such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC), Hamas, Irgun and
Weatherman consisted of highly educated
and wealthy individuals. The same is true of
the masterminds and perpetrators of the 9/11
attacks, Madrid train bombings and London
subway bombings. Surprisingly, Musharraf
acknowledged this phenomenon in his
speech as well, but failed to elaborate on the
inherent contradiction such a fact poses to his
"illiteracy/poverty" argument.

Paradoxically, Musharraf also acknowl
edged the inherent socio-political nature of
terrorism. Musharraf accurately described
the historical intervention of the United
States and Soviet Union in Muslim countries
as causing the rise of Islamist terrorism, most
famously with Osama bin Laden during the
Afghan-Soviet War. However, he blatantly
ignored the effects of socio-political repres
sion and dictatorial regimes in Muslim coun
tries that have also fueled terrorism, and ac
tually criticized those who make such claims.
The strongest predictor for terrorism in
academic literature is interestingly socio-po
litical repression and lack of civil liberties. In
tuitively, countries such as Pakistan that lack
peaceful modalities for protest would seem
to tend towards violence. An elaborate 2006
study by Prof. Indra de Soysa of the Norwe
gian University of Science and Technology
showed that the level of political terror in a
country is statistically correlated to its level
of political repression. In this light, is it really
a surprise that the perpetrators of the 9/11,
Madrid and Mumbai attacks all emerged
from dictatorial and corrupt regimes in Saudi
Arabia, Syria, Egypt and Pakistan?
Analyzing Musharraf's rule from the start
of its 1999 military coup provides further in
sight into the role dictatorial policies play in
fueling terrorism. During his rule, Musharraf
suspended the constitution, removed the
chief justice of the supreme court and dis
solved the Parliament not once, but twice. He
justified his actions on Friday by saying that
the Supreme Court was hindering the legisla
tive branch of government and impeding
democratic progress.
What he failed to mention was that the
supreme court was actually moving against
his own autocratic rule, as an army general is
not permitted to serve as the constitutional
president of Pakistan. Even if Musharraf was
protecting future democratic interests, why
did he subsequently dissolve the parliament,
imprison opposition leaders and arrest
human rights lawyers in the November 2007
state of emergency?
Furthermore, Musharraf signed the Na
tional Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO) in
October 2007 that dropped all corruption
charges against past politicians. He claimed
that he aimed to allow parties led by alleged

ly corrupt politicians, such as the Pakistan
People's Party,to regain power without crim
inal investigation. To bring the absurdity of
this home, imagine dropping the charges
against Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich be
cause it would ease the way for political
progress. It doesn't really make a lot of sense.
It is quite comprehensible as to how a dic
tatorship leads to members of the educated
middle class to terrorism as a means of fight
ing socio-economic injustice, in the absence
of any other means of protest under such op
pressive and dictatorial conditions.
In his closing arguments, Musharraf made
further contradictory claims in addressing a
solution to terrorism. He asserted that sepa
rating the ethnic Pashtuns from their neigh
boring Taliban elements is the only way to
win the War on Terror and sway the hearts of
indigenous people away from terrorism. Yet
at the same time, Musharraf repeatedly
claimed that the response to terrorism still
requires military might â€” despite the fact
that such actions have galvanized the Pash
tun populations into launching their own ter
ror campaigns. Statistics provide even more
harrowing prospects. A September 2008
RAND study showed that between 1%8 and
2006, only seven percent of terrorist groups
had been defeated through military cam
paigns.
Overall, it is important to realize that ter
rorism's solution will not be fast and easy. In
the short term, it would be wise to employ in
tricate policing campaigns and political deal
ings that have had an 83 percent success rate
in defeating terrorism, according to the
RAND study. In the long term, combating il
literacy and poverty, though a noble goal, will
not hinder the use of terrorism. Instead, we
must look to resolve the political conflicts
plaguing the Muslim world, and also reduce
our support for corrupt and dictatorial
regimes.
Lastly, I must agree with Musharraf that
blaming the nation of Pakistan for propagat
ing terrorism is both wrong and counterpro
ductive. I contend, however, that Musharraf's
hypocritical rhetoric and contradictory poli
cies towards fighting terrorism don't warrant
much merit either.
