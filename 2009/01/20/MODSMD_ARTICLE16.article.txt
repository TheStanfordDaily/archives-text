## JUST MISSED Card women fall at Cal 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
It was an unusual Sunday after
noon in Berkeley. No. 9 Stanford
shut down Ashley Walker. No. 11
California's biggest offensive
threat. Both sophomore Kayla Ped
ersen and junior Jayne Appel near
ly had double-doubles. The Cardi
nal out-shot and out-rebounded the
Golden Bears. And yet, Stanford
headed back to the Farm on the
wrong side of a 57-54 score, drop
ping its first game at Haas Pavilion
in 15 years.
The reason? Alexis Gray-Law
son, the smallest player on the Cal
squad. The junior guard lit up the
Cardinal for a career-high 37 points
on 12-20 shooting, including 5-7
from three. Her two free throws at
the 1:09 mark gave the Golden
Bears their final lead, and her sub
sequent lay up with 21 seconds left
forced Stanford to take its final shot
from beyond the arc. Both Peder
sen and senior forward Jillian Har
mon missed in the waning seconds,
and Cal capped off a wild game that
— at least for the time being —
shifts the power of the Pacific-10
Conference to the North Bay.
Stanford has long been the con
ference's powerhouse, a mainstay
even when other teams went
through rebuilding cycles. The Car
dinal is coming off its fifth straight
Pac-10 championship, evidence of
its staying power. But the Golden
Bears have begun nipping at Stan
ford's heels since Cal coach Joanne
Boyle arrived at Berkeley in 2005.
By last season. Cal was sporting a
top-10 NCAA ranking. However.
Stanford reasserted itself in last
March's conference championship
game — the Cardinal dismantled
Cal to the tune of 56-35, holding off
the Bears for another season.
But with Sunday's win, Cal drew
first blood in this year's rivalry. The
Bears have overtaken Stanford in
the national rankings (No. 8 v. No.
11) and now sit alone and undefeat
ed at the top of the Pac-10 standings.
"I thought it was a great game by
both teams," Boyle said. "It came
down to the wire. Give credit to
Stanford. They know us so well:
they had a great game plan. They
tried to take away our big game.
Fexi and our guards just stepped
up."
"It was one of those games where
you had to gut it out down the
stretch," she continued.
The Bears' victory came on the
back of Gray-Lawson, who carved
through the normally impenetrable
Cardinal front line to drain every
thing from three-pointers to mid
range jumpers to layups in traffic.
With Walker neutralized by Appel,
Pcdersen and the rest of Stanford's
forward rotation. Gray-Lawson's
role expanded exponentially.
"They knew that we'd been run
ning on Ashley a lot most of the
year," Boyle said. "Alexis is capable
of having games like this day in and
day out. They took our posts out of
it. Lexi stepped up and had the kind
of game that we really needed her
to have. She can do this every
night."

GAME NOTES: A day after Stanford men's bas
ketball pulled out an upset victory over the
Bears, the N0.9 Cal women returned the
favor. The N0.7 Cardinal women's basket
ball team lost a close contest in Berkeley on
Sunday, 57-54. The Cardinal fought back
from an eight-point deficit in the closing min
utes of the first half to narrow the margin to
three, but the Stanford women simply could
n't control Cal's Alexis Gray-Lawson. The
junior guard shredded the Cardinal defense,
scoring 37 points on 60 percent shooting.
She also knocked down five of seven threes
to go along with four rebounds. The Cardi
nal looks to bounce back from the bitter loss
when it travels to Oregon and Oregon State
this weekend.

"Once she starts making it.the
basket keeps getting bigger and big
ger," Appel said of the Cal guard.
Grey-Lawson was literally the
only offensive threat for the Bears
— no other player scored more
than six points, and she accounted
for 65 percent of Cal's production.
At the same time, Stanford's
guards could not find much success
of their own. Redshirt junior Ros
alyn Gold-Onwude shot 25 percent
from the field, and sophomore

Jeanette Pohlen was only 2-11 from
the floor. Harmon, a forward, net
ted only three baskets on 12 shots.
"We didn't have much of an of
fensive flow." Cardinal coach Tara
VanDcrveer said.
Yet Stanford — which trailed by
three at halftime — was able to as
sert itself later in the game. Appel
and Pcdersen carried the brunt of
the load for the Cardinal, who went
on a 20-9 run over the last five min
utes of the first half and the first five
minutes of the second half to tem
porarily change momentum. By the
7:29 mark, the Cardinal had an
eight-point lead. But the margin
was quickly made up by two Gray-
Lawson three-pointers. From there,
the game remained close until the
final buzzer.The Cardinal, down by
three points, inbounded the ball
with 11 seconds left, which meant
one thing: get the ball to Pohlen.
"That play was designed for
Jeanette and the play got jumbled,"
said Pedersen. who found herself
with the ball instead.
With eight seconds left, she at
tempted a three from the left side,
which ricocheted out to Harmon.
Ilie senior launched a shot of her
own. but it was off the mark.The ball
instead bounced harmlessly into the
arms of Cal's Kelsey Adrian, and the
Bears' celebration began.
Stanford travels to Oregon this
weekend for a two-game road set.
The Cardinal women head to Fu
gene on Thursday to play the Ducks,
followed by a Saturday showdown
with the Beavers in Corvallis. Both
games are set for 7 p.m. starts.

GIULIO GRATTA/The Stanford Daily
Redshirt junior Rosalyn Gold-Onwude has been a leader for the Stanford
women's basketball team this season, but she and her teammates struggled
to find the basket on Sunday. The team shot just 36.7 percent from the field.
