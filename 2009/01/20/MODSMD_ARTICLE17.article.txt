## Barte shines at Indian Wells 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Over the three-day weekend, the
No. 5 Stanford women's tennis :eam
went to work at its first tournaments of
2009.
file Cardinal women had mixed re
sults with split squads at the Freeman
Memorial Tennis Championships in
Vegas, Nev. and the National Colle
giate Tennis Classic (NCTC) in Indian
Wells, Calif.
At the NCTC Classic, sophomore
Hilary Barte overwhelmed her compe
tition. reaching both the singles and
doubles finals in Indian Wells. IJnfortu
nately, Barte could not capture either
title. She fell to No. I ranked Maria
Mosolova of Northwestern in a 6-3,6-
7(K). 7-5 battle for the singles crown; in
doubles, Barte teamed up with junior
Lindsay Burdette to reach the champi
onships before falling 9-8(4) to UCLA's
Andrea Remynse and Yasmin
Schnack.
"I lilary had a very gcxxl tournament

in singles and doubles, and I'm sure
she'd like to have back that finals
match." head coach Lelc Forood said.
"But obviously she was in a position to
win it, and she couldn't quite finish off
Mosolova."
Burdette also dropped a close 7-6
(6). 2-6,6-3 decision to Schnack in sin
gles play, while sophomore Jennifer Yen
fell to Southern California's Amanda
Fink 6-2,6-4.
"Jennifer played the number one
girl from I JSC and gave her quite a bat
tle," Forood said.
Across the desert at the Freeman
Championships, the Cardinal faced an
impressive draw composed of some of
the best players from around the na
tion.
"It was a mixed bag there,"-Forood
said."[The] draw over the course of the
last few years has gotten tougher and
tougher. It was a very tough draw there
— most competitive I've seen in all
[the | times we've gone there. Wins any
where in that draw are definitely a good
thing."

Sure enough, wins were difficult to
come by in the Vegas desert.
After a shortened fall season,senior
Jessica Nguyen returned with a 6-2,7-5
victory over Georgia Tech's Christina
Ngo in the first round, before dropping
a 6-2, 7-6 decision to Arizona State's
Michaels Hein. Nguyen would fall 6-7.
7-6,6-0 to KatrinaTsang of top-ranked
North Carolina in an added singles
match.
With three other Stanford women
falling in the first round of the draw.
Nguyen's lone victory was a good sign
that the senior is returning to form.
"Overall, Jessica started to get back
in her game," Forood said. "It was a
tough one she lost in three sets toTsang
who plays for No. I North Carolina.
She's really starting to find her form,
which is why we're there."
Despite having more losses than
wins. Stanford's young squad is matur
ing in the line of fire. With more than six
underclassmen on the squad, the young
players got a taste of the best competi
tion in the NCAA.
"For the freshmen, they might have
been in slightly over their heads playing
in the top flight at the moment, but it's
good exposure to the level of play up
there," Forood said. "They got a chance
to realize how good the play is, especial
ly with players that are one through
three from some of the bigger pro
grams in the country."
With so many new faces on the
team, the Stanford doubles will need to
brush-up on their games in the next few
weeks. Barte and Burdette are the only
pairing to make the latest Intercolle
giate Tennis Association (ITA) rank
ings, coming in at No. 41.
"We have to work on a lot of dou
bles," Forood said. "Since we have a lot
of new players, we're going to have to
work on our overall level of doubles
and meshing people together to what
ever the teams are going to be, which is
not really clear either."
Even with the first dual match less
than a week away, the lineup has yet to
be finalized.
"Thursday's match, we'll put out a
lineup there that won't necessarily rep
resent what we'll be a month from now

when we head to the Team Indoors,"
Forood added.
For now, the only thing holding
Stanford back is a lack of experience —
and it showed this weekend. With time,
the Cardinal women think that the mo
mentum will swing in their direction.
"At this point in the season, you can
call the glass half-full or half-empty,and
we're going to take all the opportunity
we have there and realize that with
more practice and match play, we're
going to convert on the chances we
couldn't pull through [this weekend],"
Forood said. "It's going to take some
time for this thing to come together, for
us to get up to speed with where we
need to get to."
Stanford returns to the courts on
Thursday afternoon, when it hosts UC-
Davis at the Taube Family Tennis Cen
ter. The young Cardinal squad will use
this competition to tune-up for the ITA
Indoor Qualifying matches on Jan. 30th
and 31 st. Stanford's sights are set on the
2009 National Team Indoor Champi
onships held in Madison, Wise, in mid-
February. Forood knows that the
team's development over the next
month will be crucial in determining
their success on the National level.
"Hopefully over the next month
we'll build towards a competitive
group," she concluded.
