# Arizona Cardinals: Super Bowl Champs?
## 
### 
First, it was the Tampa Bay Rays.
Now it's the Arizona Cardinals.
It's been an odd few months in
professional sports, as traditional
doormats rose to the top — despite
nearly everyone's insistence that they
would collapse. If not this week, then
surely the next; if not then, well, they
can't hold off fate forever.
And yet. the Rays became the
creme de la creme of the American
League before falling in the World
Series. The Cardinals have now
reached the same plateau in the NFL
and have a shot to do what the Rays
could not: finish the job. That's right,
the Cardinals have the chance to win
a Super Bowl.
No. I can't believe it either.
But perhaps it shouldn't be so
shocking. As the last two years — and
plenty before them — have proven,
regular season records and rankings
mean next to nothing in the playoffs.
If the New York Giants' run last year
didn't prove this.surelv the Cardinals'
similar trek to the championship
game does.
Let's be clear about the team
we're discussing here: Arizona lost by
21 to the Jets, got manhandled at
home by the Vikings and was blown
out in Philadelphia (48-20) and New
England (47-7). The Cardinals beat
up on the weakest conference in the
NFC — and arguably in all of foot
ball — and won only three out-of
conference games. They have a high
scoring offense, but their defense was
28th in the NFL in points allowed.
Was this the best team in the NFC?
No. not by a long shot.
But that was the regular season.
This isn't college football, where the
two (supposed) teams from Septem
ber to December play for the champi
onship. In the NFL,once January rolls
around and the playoffs commence, a

new year has truly begun. Even if
you're the top seed, you can't afford
to take a game off— if you come out
flat, you get to enjoy the rest of the
playoffs from your living room. Like
wise, even a sixth seed that has to play
three road games to reach the Super
Bowl can rally and knock off jugger
nauts — resilient teams that can han
dle the postseason pressure perse
vere, no matter what their record.
Arizona reminds me of the 2(K)3-
()4 Carolina Panthers, except with a
better offense and worse defense —
they both won weak divisions and
didn't fare well against other oppo
nents. But once the playoffs started, it
was as if a new team had taken the
field — the offense clicked, the de
fense found its mojo, and after some
hard-fought postseason battles, they
were off to the races.
Such is the case for the Cardinals.
We didn't take notice after their
opening-round win over the Atlanta
Falcons — many people pointed to
rookie quarterback Matt Ryan's
three turnovers to explain the narrow
victory. Lost in the blame game,
though, was Arizona's defensive per
formance. Despite giving up 24 points,
the Cards held the Falcons to just 250
total yards, and stifled running back
Michael Turner — who ran wild over
the NFL all season — to the tune of a
2.3 yards-per-carry average.
It was much of the same in Caroli
na the following week, despite the
Cardinals being tabbed as serious un
derdogs: the Panthers were held to 269
total yards. Jake Delhomme turned
the hall over half a dozen times, and
the dynamic running back duo of Jere
my Stewart and DeAngelo Williams
was held to just 75 yards on the
ground. Meanwhile.even without An
quan Boldin, Kurt Warner passed at
will against the Carolina defense and

Larry Fitzgerald was simply sublime.
Then came Philly, and everyone
knows what happened next. Some
writers, such as ESPN's Gene Woj
ciechowski. didn't even want to play
the game —just send Philly toTampa
and get it over with. Instead, the Car
dinals jumped out to a 24-6 halftime
lead. Despite an impressive Eagles
run in the third quarter. Arizona shut
down Philly's main weapon. Brian
Westhrook (71 total yards) and even
tually forced a turnover on downs to
seal the game. The defense wasn't
great, hut it did its part: Warner and
Fitzgerald did the rest.
Now. with the Super Bowl two
weeks away, people are discounting
them again. line Cardinals are heavy
underdogs despite a quarterback-re
ceiver combo that is playing as well as
anyone ever over a three game stretch
— Fitzgerald has already set the post
season record for receiving yards, and
he still has another contest left — and
a defense that has finally wokVn up.
Count Arizona out at your own risk:
Pittsburgh, its Super Bowl opponent,
surely won't.The Steelers' last champi
onship. in 2(K)6, came after an impres
sive and historic run through the play
offs that began when the team barely
made it to the postseason and was slot
ted as the sixth and lowest seed in the
AFC. It ended with Bill Cowher hoist
ing the I ,ombardi Trophy.
The Steelers will do everything
they can to stop the Cardinals' magi
cal postseason from progressing any
further. But Arizona has already re
minded us what we should have
known bv now: it's anyone's game.

total yards, and stifled running back
Michael Turner — who ran wild over
the NFL all season — to the tune of a
2.3 yards-per-carry average.
It was much of the same in Caroli
na the following week, despite the
Cardinals being tabbed as serious un
derdogs: the Panthers were held to 269
total yards. Jake Delhomme turned
the hall over half a dozen times, and
the dynamic running back duo of Jere
my Stewart and DeAngelo Williams
was held to just 75 yards on the
ground. Meanwhile.even without An
quan Boldin, Kurt Warner passed at
will against the Carolina defense and

Larry Fitzgerald was simply sublime.
Then came Philly, and everyone
knows what happened next. Some
writers, such as ESPN's Gene Woj
ciechowski. didn't even want to play
the game —just send Philly toTampa
and get it over with. Instead, the Car
dinals jumped out to a 24-6 halftime
lead. Despite an impressive Eagles
run in the third quarter. Arizona shut
down Philly's main weapon. Brian
Westhrook (71 total yards) and even
tually forced a turnover on downs to
seal the game. The defense wasn't
great, hut it did its part: Warner and
Fitzgerald did the rest.
Now. with the Super Bowl two
weeks away, people are discounting
them again. line Cardinals are heavy
underdogs despite a quarterback-re
ceiver combo that is playing as well as
anyone ever over a three game stretch
— Fitzgerald has already set the post
season record for receiving yards, and
he still has another contest left — and
a defense that has finally wokVn up.
Count Arizona out at your own risk:
Pittsburgh, its Super Bowl opponent,
surely won't.The Steelers' last champi
onship. in 2(K)6, came after an impres
sive and historic run through the play
offs that began when the team barely
made it to the postseason and was slot
ted as the sixth and lowest seed in the
AFC. It ended with Bill Cowher hoist
ing the I ,ombardi Trophy.
The Steelers will do everything
they can to stop the Cardinals' magi
cal postseason from progressing any
further. But Arizona has already re
minded us what we should have
known bv now: it's anyone's game.
