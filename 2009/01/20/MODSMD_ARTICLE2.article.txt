Causes of Terrorism
While Musharraf explained that terrorism may be
caused by both poverty and illiteracy, he acknowledged
that many of the terrorists involved in the 9/11, London
and Madrid bombings were neither illiterate nor poor.
Instead, he cited an environment of political alienation,
injustice and deprivation that arose from "unresolved
political disputes."
"The anger and frustration among Muslim youth is

exploited by groups with perverse ideologies of their
own, following misrepresented views of Islam,"
Musharraf said. "These are the people who pick on frus
trated youth and indoctrinate them to be terrorists and
suicide bombers."
The former president argued for a holistic approach
to extremism, likening global terrorism to a tree whose
leaves are individual terrorists and whose branches are
terrorist organizations.
"We always talk of clearing the leaves and branches,
but we never talk of the root." Musharraf said. "We must
address the root causes with sincerity and a lot of vigor,
which one doesn't see."
Pakistan "Abandoned"
Musharraf offered an insightful and often biting
analysis of the history of terrorism in Pakistan, noting
that Pakistan had recently played a significant role in the
fight against al-Qaeda and the Taliban. He pointed to the
early rise of the Taliban in 1979. when the Soviet Union
invaded Afghanistan. Cheered on by the United States,
Pakistan supported the Taliban and armed up to 30.000
