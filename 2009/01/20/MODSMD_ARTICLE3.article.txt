## Bike flyers put students on notice Officials report no real change in distribution of orange flyers 
### CARLEE BROWN DESK EDITOR 
Across campus, orange flyers warning of
bicycle parking violations are not uncommon in
front of the most popular destinations. But
despite the Ã¼biquitous nature of these flyers,
some students have observed a marked increase
in the number posted in recent weeks.
"There have been a lot of flyers, mostly by
bike racks at Tresidder and Axe & Palm," noted
Anaya Hall '10.
While other students echoed Hall, citing an
increase in flyers on bikes in the Quad and at
Hewlett, Public Information Officer Bill Larson
from the Department Public Safety (DPS) indi
cated that the department had not purposefully
increased the number of flyers across campus.
"To my knowledge, enforcement has been
relatively consistent in the Main Quad," Larson
said in an email to The Daily.
However, certain areas can come under
scrutiny if staff who manage the building area
request additional surveillance, as was the case
at Hewlett.
"Yhe building manager [at Hewlett) had
recently requested we warn bicyclists with the
flyers not to park in areas around the building
that will obstruct or prevent passage of pedestri
ans," Larson said, "and especially those who are
mobility impaired."
Officials at both DPS and Parking &
Transportation Services (P&TS) noted the
importance of the notices for ensuring compli
ance with the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) and general pedestrian safety.
"All bikes should be parked in the designated
bike racks," said Ariadne Scott, bicycle program
coordinator for P&TS. "The main reason behind
this is we don't want to block any stairways or
walkways that would impede wheelchair access
or affect ADA accessibility or impede pedestri
an access."
The legal requirements of the ADA allow
bikes to be removed if they block wheelchair
access ramps or stairways. Larson said DPS has
not had reason to remove bikes as of yet due to
a high level of compliance from bicyclists.
Still, some students believe the flyers are not
always warranted.
"I got one on my bike fairly recently," said
Betty Pham '09. "I was parked at Tresidder. but
I wasn't obstructing anything. It kind of seems
like* they're going around, trying to piss stu-
