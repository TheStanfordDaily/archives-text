## Bike flyers put students on notice Officials report no real change in distribution of orange flyers 
### CARLEE BROWN DESK EDITOR 
Across campus, orange flyers warning of
bicycle parking violations are not uncommon in
front of the most popular destinations. But
despite the übiquitous nature of these flyers,
some students have observed a marked increase
in the number posted in recent weeks.
"There have been a lot of flyers, mostly by
bike racks at Tresidder and Axe & Palm," noted
Anaya Hall '10.
While other students echoed Hall, citing an
increase in flyers on bikes in the Quad and at
Hewlett, Public Information Officer Bill Larson
from the Department Public Safety (DPS) indi
cated that the department had not purposefully
increased the number of flyers across campus.
"To my knowledge, enforcement has been
relatively consistent in the Main Quad," Larson
said in an email to The Daily.
However, certain areas can come under
scrutiny if staff who manage the building area
request additional surveillance, as was the case
at Hewlett.
"Yhe building manager [at Hewlett) had
recently requested we warn bicyclists with the
flyers not to park in areas around the building
that will obstruct or prevent passage of pedestri
ans," Larson said, "and especially those who are
mobility impaired."
Officials at both DPS and Parking &
Transportation Services (P&TS) noted the
importance of the notices for ensuring compli
ance with the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) and general pedestrian safety.
"All bikes should be parked in the designated
bike racks," said Ariadne Scott, bicycle program
coordinator for P&TS. "The main reason behind
this is we don't want to block any stairways or
walkways that would impede wheelchair access
or affect ADA accessibility or impede pedestri
an access."
The legal requirements of the ADA allow
bikes to be removed if they block wheelchair
access ramps or stairways. Larson said DPS has
not had reason to remove bikes as of yet due to
a high level of compliance from bicyclists.
Still, some students believe the flyers are not
always warranted.
"I got one on my bike fairly recently," said
Betty Pham '09. "I was parked at Tresidder. but
I wasn't obstructing anything. It kind of seems
like* they're going around, trying to piss stu-
dents off."
Gaurav Jain, a graduate student in electrical engi
neering, said that though he walks, he has noticed
crowded bikes in some areas of campus.
"Mostly, I have classes around Gates, and I see a
lot of bikes parked around there," he said.
Jain said the lack of bike racks at his new resi
dence, Munger. has driven students to other parking
options.
"Many people have to take bikes in their rooms,"
Jain said.
While bike parking at Munger may be limited by
ongoing construction, other bike rack space on cam
pus is constrained for varying reasons. Stanford's
Planning department works with P&TS to find new
parking space, but due to future projects and limited
area, more bike racks aren't always feasible.
Sometimes, officials direct students to parking in

areas away from congested building fronts.
"I have worked on-site at Encina Hall to encour
age people to use the empty bike racks clearly visible
at Hoover just across the path," said Carole Lee, bike
abatement manager for DPS, in an email to The
Daily. Currently, Lee added, P&TS is working with
Planning to determine if there is a way to add bike
parking at the Encina West entrance.
More bike space is freed up by the bike abate
ment program that removes abandoned bikes from
racks on campus, a program which Lee heads. For the
2007-2008 school year, 1,313 bikes were impounded
as abandoned.
Hall, who said she used to bike on campus but
now chooses to walk, said one of the reasons she
stopped biking was to avoid dealing with bike racks
themselves. To help those who still choose to bike to
class, Hall suggested that the University look at its
parking options.
"They should come up with a better system." Hall
said. "People will keep going to those [high traffic]
places, so it's better to come up with a solution."
