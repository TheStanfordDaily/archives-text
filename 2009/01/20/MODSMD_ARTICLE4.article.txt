# CARD UPSETS CAL
## HILL HELPS SPOIL MONTGOMERY'S RETURN WITH 25 POINTS 
### DENIS GRIFFIN MANAGING EDITOR 
A revered hardwood coaching leg
end. returning in the enemy's colors. A
long downtrodden opponent, suddenly
on the rise and nationally ranked. A
home team with its back to the wall
after losing two conference matches in
heartrending fashion just a week
before.
As far as Bay Area rivalries go. it
rarely gets any better than this. And for

the Cardinal fans who packed Maples
Pavilion as Mike Montgomery and the
No. 22 California men came to campus
to battle Stanford (12-3. 2-3 Pacific-10
Conference), the result was as sweet as
the storylines coming into the contest,
with the Cardinal walking away on a
75-69 victory.
"I thought the crowd. Sixth Man.
everyone involved was amazing," said
first-year Stanford coach Johnny
Hawkins of the spirited atmosphere at
Maples. "To see the Sixth Man out

there, strong as they were and cheering
as loud as our fans were. I loved it. And
I really appreciated it."
In front of a crowd of 7,329. most of
whom were wearing Cardinal and
white. Stanford kept pace with the
Bears (15-3, 4-1) for most of the game
before pulling away with roughly five
and-a-half minutes remaining.
Stanford's perimeter defense again was
key. as senior Mitch Johnson seemed to
give Cal guard Jerome Randle trouble
all night long at the point.
"We just wanted to stay in the pass
ing lanes and deny entry passes, and
once they caught [them] we wanted to
get up into them and trust our help."
senior guard Anthony Goods said.
"Because we knew they were the best
three-point shooting team in the
nation, we wanted to limit their looks
as much as possible and Mitch
[Johnson| did a great job up top. and
me and Landry [Fields] just tried to
stay in the lanes and make it easier for
him, and they had to go to their second
and third and fourth options."
Stanford was led offensively by a
career night from senior forward
Lawrence Hill, who scored 25 points on
11-15 shooting, and on the boards by a
surprising effort from freshman Jeremy
Green, who grabbed eight rebounds in
just 22 minutes.
While there was plenty of drama
throughout the game, the action really
seemed to heat up at the eight-minute
mark as Green hit a three-pointer from
the baseline to put the Cardinal up by one.

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal men's basketball team
pulled out a huge win over Cal on Saturday, end
ing Stanford's two-game losing streak and spoil
ing former Stanford coach Mike Montgomery's
return to the Farm. The Bears came to Maples
Pavilion having won their previous nine contests.
Cal's Jamal Boykin scored 22 points, but the
Cardinal defense was solid and limited the Bears
to 69 points — the 12th time in 15 games that
Stanford has held its opponent under 70.
Lawrence Hill erupted for a career-high 25 points
on 11 -of-15 shooting, while Goods added 19
and was 2-for-4 from three. Stanford continues
Poc-10 play on Thursday, when it welcomes the
Oregon Ducks to Maples Pavilion.

Senior forward Lawrence Hill was a major factor in Stanford's victory over No. 22
Cal on Saturday. The Cardinal continues Pac-10 play in Oregon this weekend.
one, 54-53. Cal answered back with
a layup, but Johnson responded
with a pull-up jumper from 10 feet
out to put Stanford back on top.
Green and Johnson then stole the
ball on the two ensuing Cal posses
sions, as Stanford went up 60-55.
The Cardinal's lead was not re
linquished for the rest of the game
and at one point grew to as much as
10 points.
"There was a stretch where the
game was either tied or we were up
one or down one," Goods said of the
tumultuous game. "We kept getting
stops but we'd turn it over or it
would just be something stupid. But
you kind of knew we'd had our
chances to blow it open, but we just
had to stay solid and keep defend
ing, and that's what we did. Jeremy
[Green] was huge on the boards for
us and everyone was crashing, and
we showed a lot of heart towards
the end."
Goods and junior Landry Fields
also" had big games for the Cardi
nal— scoring 19 and 15 on the
night, respectively. However, an
other big man proved difficult for
Stanford to stop, as the Bears'
Jamal Boykin went 10-13 and
racked up 22 points. Still, despite
flashing dominance at times, the
Bears and Montgomery left
Maples having missed out on a
golden opportunity to take sole
possession of first place in the Pac
-10, as UCLA fell 61-58 to Arizona
State.
"It's disappointing because I did
n't think we had a good week of
practice," Cal's Montgomery said.
"In my gut, it felt like we were head
ed for a comeuppance, and I
thought maybe that's kind of what
happened to us."
But the former Stanford coach
was quick to point out that his team
had faced a quality opponent at
Maples:
"I thought Stanford was very
well prepared," he said. "They have
the advantage of really having four
perimeter guys that can switch
everything, and they're all pretty
athletic and can all switch the point
of attack.
"Stanford is a good basketball
team,"Montgomery continued. "I

have felt that way from the get-go. You didn't know for
sure from [the] preseason schedule because it wasn't as
challenging. That wasn't Johnny's issue because it was
what they had to play."
And despite a raucous greeting during pregame intro
ductions, Montgomery praised the Stanford community
for the warm welcome he received on his return, now
cohching his former employer's archrival.
"People were great, everybody was very gracious,"
Montgomery said. "They booed like they should have
when we were introduced and all that kind of stuff, but
relative to me they were very gracious as I should've ex
pected. I went over to get my coffee at Jimmy V's and
they let me in the door and didn't charge me, as usual."
Stanford may not have charged Montgomery for cof
fee, but the Cardinal wasn't nearly so gracious in giving
out points — or a win.
NOTES: Lawrence Hill was named the U.S. Bank Pac-1()
Player of the Week for his efforts against the Bears, as the
Stanford senior matched a career high with 25 points on
Saturday ... Forward Josh Owens played for just 11 min
utes against Cal. pulling down two offensive rebounds
and going 0-3 from the floor as he has continued to see his
role reduced in the Stanford rotation ... Stanford is cur
rently seventh in the Pac-10 standings, but hosts cellar
dwellers Oregon (6-12,0-6) and Oregon State (6-10,1-5)
on Thursday and Saturday, respectively.

on the rise and nationally ranked. A
home team with its back to the wall
after losing two conference matches in
heartrending fashion just a week
before.
As far as Bay Area rivalries go. it
rarely gets any better than this. And for

the Cardinal fans who packed Maples
Pavilion as Mike Montgomery and the
No. 22 California men came to campus
to battle Stanford (12-3. 2-3 Pacific-10
Conference), the result was as sweet as
the storylines coming into the contest,
with the Cardinal walking away on a
75-69 victory.
"I thought the crowd. Sixth Man.
everyone involved was amazing," said
first-year Stanford coach Johnny
Hawkins of the spirited atmosphere at
Maples. "To see the Sixth Man out

there, strong as they were and cheering
as loud as our fans were. I loved it. And
I really appreciated it."
In front of a crowd of 7,329. most of
whom were wearing Cardinal and
white. Stanford kept pace with the
Bears (15-3, 4-1) for most of the game
before pulling away with roughly five
and-a-half minutes remaining.
Stanford's perimeter defense again was
key. as senior Mitch Johnson seemed to
give Cal guard Jerome Randle trouble
all night long at the point.
"We just wanted to stay in the pass
ing lanes and deny entry passes, and
once they caught [them] we wanted to
get up into them and trust our help."
senior guard Anthony Goods said.
"Because we knew they were the best
three-point shooting team in the
nation, we wanted to limit their looks
as much as possible and Mitch
[Johnson| did a great job up top. and
me and Landry [Fields] just tried to
stay in the lanes and make it easier for
him, and they had to go to their second
and third and fourth options."
Stanford was led offensively by a
career night from senior forward
Lawrence Hill, who scored 25 points on
11-15 shooting, and on the boards by a
surprising effort from freshman Jeremy
Green, who grabbed eight rebounds in
just 22 minutes.
While there was plenty of drama
throughout the game, the action really
seemed to heat up at the eight-minute
mark as Green hit a three-pointer from
the baseline to put the Cardinal up by one.

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal men's basketball team
pulled out a huge win over Cal on Saturday, end
ing Stanford's two-game losing streak and spoil
ing former Stanford coach Mike Montgomery's
return to the Farm. The Bears came to Maples
Pavilion having won their previous nine contests.
Cal's Jamal Boykin scored 22 points, but the
Cardinal defense was solid and limited the Bears
to 69 points — the 12th time in 15 games that
Stanford has held its opponent under 70.
Lawrence Hill erupted for a career-high 25 points
on 11 -of-15 shooting, while Goods added 19
and was 2-for-4 from three. Stanford continues
Poc-10 play on Thursday, when it welcomes the
Oregon Ducks to Maples Pavilion.

Senior forward Lawrence Hill was a major factor in Stanford's victory over No. 22
Cal on Saturday. The Cardinal continues Pac-10 play in Oregon this weekend.
one, 54-53. Cal answered back with
a layup, but Johnson responded
with a pull-up jumper from 10 feet
out to put Stanford back on top.
Green and Johnson then stole the
ball on the two ensuing Cal posses
sions, as Stanford went up 60-55.
The Cardinal's lead was not re
linquished for the rest of the game
and at one point grew to as much as
10 points.
"There was a stretch where the
game was either tied or we were up
one or down one," Goods said of the
tumultuous game. "We kept getting
stops but we'd turn it over or it
would just be something stupid. But
you kind of knew we'd had our
chances to blow it open, but we just
had to stay solid and keep defend
ing, and that's what we did. Jeremy
[Green] was huge on the boards for
us and everyone was crashing, and
we showed a lot of heart towards
the end."
Goods and junior Landry Fields
also" had big games for the Cardi
nal— scoring 19 and 15 on the
night, respectively. However, an
other big man proved difficult for
Stanford to stop, as the Bears'
Jamal Boykin went 10-13 and
racked up 22 points. Still, despite
flashing dominance at times, the
Bears and Montgomery left
Maples having missed out on a
golden opportunity to take sole
possession of first place in the Pac
-10, as UCLA fell 61-58 to Arizona
State.
"It's disappointing because I did
n't think we had a good week of
practice," Cal's Montgomery said.
"In my gut, it felt like we were head
ed for a comeuppance, and I
thought maybe that's kind of what
happened to us."
But the former Stanford coach
was quick to point out that his team
had faced a quality opponent at
Maples:
"I thought Stanford was very
well prepared," he said. "They have
the advantage of really having four
perimeter guys that can switch
everything, and they're all pretty
athletic and can all switch the point
of attack.
"Stanford is a good basketball
team,"Montgomery continued. "I

have felt that way from the get-go. You didn't know for
sure from [the] preseason schedule because it wasn't as
challenging. That wasn't Johnny's issue because it was
what they had to play."
And despite a raucous greeting during pregame intro
ductions, Montgomery praised the Stanford community
for the warm welcome he received on his return, now
cohching his former employer's archrival.
"People were great, everybody was very gracious,"
Montgomery said. "They booed like they should have
when we were introduced and all that kind of stuff, but
relative to me they were very gracious as I should've ex
pected. I went over to get my coffee at Jimmy V's and
they let me in the door and didn't charge me, as usual."
Stanford may not have charged Montgomery for cof
fee, but the Cardinal wasn't nearly so gracious in giving
out points — or a win.
NOTES: Lawrence Hill was named the U.S. Bank Pac-1()
Player of the Week for his efforts against the Bears, as the
Stanford senior matched a career high with 25 points on
Saturday ... Forward Josh Owens played for just 11 min
utes against Cal. pulling down two offensive rebounds
and going 0-3 from the floor as he has continued to see his
role reduced in the Stanford rotation ... Stanford is cur
rently seventh in the Pac-10 standings, but hosts cellar
dwellers Oregon (6-12,0-6) and Oregon State (6-10,1-5)
on Thursday and Saturday, respectively.
