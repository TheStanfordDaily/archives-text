# CARD UPSETS CAL
## HILL HELPS SPOIL MONTGOMERY'S RETURN WITH 25 POINTS 
### DENIS GRIFFIN MANAGING EDITOR 
A revered hardwood coaching leg
end. returning in the enemy's colors. A
long downtrodden opponent, suddenly
on the rise and nationally ranked. A
home team with its back to the wall
after losing two conference matches in
heartrending fashion just a week
before.
As far as Bay Area rivalries go. it
rarely gets any better than this. And for

the Cardinal fans who packed Maples
Pavilion as Mike Montgomery and the
No. 22 California men came to campus
to battle Stanford (12-3. 2-3 Pacific-10
Conference), the result was as sweet as
the storylines coming into the contest,
with the Cardinal walking away on a
75-69 victory.
"I thought the crowd. Sixth Man.
everyone involved was amazing," said
first-year Stanford coach Johnny
Hawkins of the spirited atmosphere at
Maples. "To see the Sixth Man out

there, strong as they were and cheering
as loud as our fans were. I loved it. And
I really appreciated it."
In front of a crowd of 7,329. most of
whom were wearing Cardinal and
white. Stanford kept pace with the
Bears (15-3, 4-1) for most of the game
before pulling away with roughly five
and-a-half minutes remaining.
Stanford's perimeter defense again was
key. as senior Mitch Johnson seemed to
give Cal guard Jerome Randle trouble
all night long at the point.
"We just wanted to stay in the pass
ing lanes and deny entry passes, and
once they caught [them] we wanted to
get up into them and trust our help."
senior guard Anthony Goods said.
"Because we knew they were the best
three-point shooting team in the
nation, we wanted to limit their looks
as much as possible and Mitch
[Johnson| did a great job up top. and
me and Landry [Fields] just tried to
stay in the lanes and make it easier for
him, and they had to go to their second
and third and fourth options."
Stanford was led offensively by a
career night from senior forward
Lawrence Hill, who scored 25 points on
11-15 shooting, and on the boards by a
surprising effort from freshman Jeremy
Green, who grabbed eight rebounds in
just 22 minutes.
While there was plenty of drama
throughout the game, the action really
seemed to heat up at the eight-minute
mark as Green hit a three-pointer from
the baseline to put the Cardinal up by one.
