## Profs., fellows share views on Middle East Intellectuals on campus discuss Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
### LIZ STARK STAFF WRITER 
While the American media spent much of
the weekend preparing for Barack Obama's
inauguration and the beginning of a new era in
American politics, in the Middle East, Israel and
Hamas declared individual cease-fires and the
apparent end to a three-week war between the
two.
This latest chapter in the conflict between
Israel and Hamas, the Islamist organization and
majority political party in the Palestinian legis
lature, began when Israel launched what it
described as a defensive military campaign,
titled Operation Cast Lead, against Hamas on
Dec. 27.
The offensive came on the heels of the end of
a six-month cease-fire between Israel and
Hamas that ended on Dec. 19.
Though Stanford students were on winter
break for the majority of these developments.
Stanford faculty and Hoover fellows specializ
ing in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have been
following the events closely. Their reactions and
ideas for the future, however, vary.
Koret Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the
Hoover Institution Dr. Boaz Ganor described
the recent conflict as "the outcome of the uni
lateral decision of Hamas to end the ceasefire."
"From the Israeli point of view, this is a self
defense operation against this war of contrition
created by Hamas," Ganor said. "The Israeli-
Palestinian conflict has come to a situation in
which there is no possible horizon for peace
between the two sides because of the fact that
Hamas will not recognize the right of Israel to
exist as a Jewish state."
W. Glenn Campbell National Fellow at the
Hoover Institution Amichai Magen said that
Hamas, by "launching 70 rockets into Israel"
following the end of the cease-fire, "deliberate
ly provoked Israel."
"I think that there's no doubt that Hamas
and Iran chose to initiate this conflict." he said.
"There's a wealth of evidence to suggest that
the Israelis. Egyptians and other moderate ele
ments in the Middle East took steps to prevent
this conflict."
According to History Prof. Joel Beinin,
"(Israel's] planning for this attack on the Gaza
strip began at the same time the negotiations
for the cease-fire were being held last June."
"Neither side 1 (K) percent kept the cease
fire." Beinin said in reference to the cease-fire
from June to December. "Israel escalated viola
tions to the cease-fire [before it ended on Dec.
19], which made Hamas unwilling to
accept a cease-fire."
On the latest cease-fire, Beinin
said, "The fighting will stop, but I
don't think they're going to lead to
any kind of resolution or any steps
in the direction of peace."
"In my view, the current (Israeli]
government really has not been
interested in peace," he added.
In describing Israeli control of
Gaza's borders with Israel. Beinin
said, "In all significant effects, Israel
continued to control the Gaza strip
[following formal withdrawal in
2005), which was effectively an
open-air prison. It was not a with
drawal to make peace because that
yvould h;ive required talking about a
Palestinian state and removing
refugees."

Both Ganor and Magen suggest
ed that a peace agreement between
Israelis and Palestinians would
require new leadership in Palestine.
"The only hope for the region in
my view is that the Palestinians will
wake up and realize that, of the
Fatah and I lamas models, as long as
they hold Hamas, there will be no
peace in the region." Ganor said.
"Mahmoud Abbas is the first
Palestinian leader to understand
that terrorism and violence are
unproductive," Ganor added.
"(Palestinians] should choose him
or anybody else but Hamas."
Magen emphasized the impor
tance of a "responsible sovereignty"
in Palestine.
"Hamas has shown itself to be
completely callous in its use of the
Palestinian population in Gaza,
using them as human shields,"
Magen said. "The question becomes
whether I lamas can be the responsi
ble sovereign, and I don't know the
answer, but I think on the basis of

"Neither side
100 percent kept
the cease-fire."
JOEL BEININ,
history professor
history, Hamas has shown itself to
be irresponsible, and that does not
bode well for the future."
Beinin cited the negotiations in
the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002 as
"an acceptable place to start." This
initiative proposed that Israel with
draw to its 1967 borders with
Palestine, that Jerusalem is named
the capital of the Palestinian state,
that the issue of Palestinian refugees

be resolved in accordance with
international law and that Arab
states recognize Israel.
Still, according to Beinin, "both
Israel and the United States have
ignored this proposal."
Ganor also spoke of a two-state
solution.
"You need a partner for such an
agreement that you can trust." he
said of the option. "The internation
al community should make clear to
Palestine that they should vote dem
ocratically for a party that is ready
to recognize the right of Israel in
exchange for a Palestinian state."
"I believe that I'm not jumping
to conclusions bv saying that more
than HO percent of the Israelis not
only want to end the conflict but are
willing to create a Palestinian state
in the West Bank and Gaza and to
coexist peacefully." he added.
Magen agreed that the process is
reliant on the electoral choices of
the Palestinians.
"Israel, the U.S. and the EU will

not negotiate with Hamas until it
denounces violence and announces
the right of Israel to exist," Magen
said."! think really the ball is in the
Palestinian court to decide what
they want. You can't have it both
ways — you can't use terror and
violence and expect to be part of a
political process."
Beinin, Ganor and Magen were
all hopeful that the new Obama
administration will usher in a more
active peace-making role in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, though
Beinin noted that the President
elect has not offered any particular
ly new sentiments.
"On one occasion. [Obama] said
he was concerned about the loss of
civilian life, but that's hardly a polit
ical position." Benin said. "The
incoming Obama administration
has not done anything markedly dif
ferent."

lature, began when Israel launched what it
described as a defensive military campaign,
titled Operation Cast Lead, against Hamas on
Dec. 27.
The offensive came on the heels of the end of
a six-month cease-fire between Israel and
Hamas that ended on Dec. 19.
Though Stanford students were on winter
break for the majority of these developments.
Stanford faculty and Hoover fellows specializ
ing in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have been
following the events closely. Their reactions and
ideas for the future, however, vary.
Koret Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the
Hoover Institution Dr. Boaz Ganor described
the recent conflict as "the outcome of the uni
lateral decision of Hamas to end the ceasefire."
"From the Israeli point of view, this is a self
defense operation against this war of contrition
created by Hamas," Ganor said. "The Israeli-
Palestinian conflict has come to a situation in
which there is no possible horizon for peace
between the two sides because of the fact that
Hamas will not recognize the right of Israel to
exist as a Jewish state."
W. Glenn Campbell National Fellow at the
Hoover Institution Amichai Magen said that
Hamas, by "launching 70 rockets into Israel"
following the end of the cease-fire, "deliberate
ly provoked Israel."
"I think that there's no doubt that Hamas
and Iran chose to initiate this conflict." he said.
"There's a wealth of evidence to suggest that
the Israelis. Egyptians and other moderate ele
ments in the Middle East took steps to prevent
this conflict."
According to History Prof. Joel Beinin,
"(Israel's] planning for this attack on the Gaza
strip began at the same time the negotiations
for the cease-fire were being held last June."
"Neither side 1 (K) percent kept the cease
fire." Beinin said in reference to the cease-fire
from June to December. "Israel escalated viola
tions to the cease-fire [before it ended on Dec.
19], which made Hamas unwilling to
accept a cease-fire."
On the latest cease-fire, Beinin
said, "The fighting will stop, but I
don't think they're going to lead to
any kind of resolution or any steps
in the direction of peace."
"In my view, the current (Israeli]
government really has not been
interested in peace," he added.
In describing Israeli control of
Gaza's borders with Israel. Beinin
said, "In all significant effects, Israel
continued to control the Gaza strip
[following formal withdrawal in
2005), which was effectively an
open-air prison. It was not a with
drawal to make peace because that
yvould h;ive required talking about a
Palestinian state and removing
refugees."

Both Ganor and Magen suggest
ed that a peace agreement between
Israelis and Palestinians would
require new leadership in Palestine.
"The only hope for the region in
my view is that the Palestinians will
wake up and realize that, of the
Fatah and I lamas models, as long as
they hold Hamas, there will be no
peace in the region." Ganor said.
"Mahmoud Abbas is the first
Palestinian leader to understand
that terrorism and violence are
unproductive," Ganor added.
"(Palestinians] should choose him
or anybody else but Hamas."
Magen emphasized the impor
tance of a "responsible sovereignty"
in Palestine.
"Hamas has shown itself to be
completely callous in its use of the
Palestinian population in Gaza,
using them as human shields,"
Magen said. "The question becomes
whether I lamas can be the responsi
ble sovereign, and I don't know the
answer, but I think on the basis of

"Neither side
100 percent kept
the cease-fire."
JOEL BEININ,
history professor
history, Hamas has shown itself to
be irresponsible, and that does not
bode well for the future."
Beinin cited the negotiations in
the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002 as
"an acceptable place to start." This
initiative proposed that Israel with
draw to its 1967 borders with
Palestine, that Jerusalem is named
the capital of the Palestinian state,
that the issue of Palestinian refugees

be resolved in accordance with
international law and that Arab
states recognize Israel.
Still, according to Beinin, "both
Israel and the United States have
ignored this proposal."
Ganor also spoke of a two-state
solution.
"You need a partner for such an
agreement that you can trust." he
said of the option. "The internation
al community should make clear to
Palestine that they should vote dem
ocratically for a party that is ready
to recognize the right of Israel in
exchange for a Palestinian state."
"I believe that I'm not jumping
to conclusions bv saying that more
than HO percent of the Israelis not
only want to end the conflict but are
willing to create a Palestinian state
in the West Bank and Gaza and to
coexist peacefully." he added.
Magen agreed that the process is
reliant on the electoral choices of
the Palestinians.
"Israel, the U.S. and the EU will

not negotiate with Hamas until it
denounces violence and announces
the right of Israel to exist," Magen
said."! think really the ball is in the
Palestinian court to decide what
they want. You can't have it both
ways — you can't use terror and
violence and expect to be part of a
political process."
Beinin, Ganor and Magen were
all hopeful that the new Obama
administration will usher in a more
active peace-making role in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, though
Beinin noted that the President
elect has not offered any particular
ly new sentiments.
"On one occasion. [Obama] said
he was concerned about the loss of
civilian life, but that's hardly a polit
ical position." Benin said. "The
incoming Obama administration
has not done anything markedly dif
ferent."
