## Profs., fellows share views on Middle East Intellectuals on campus discuss Israeli-Palestinian conflict 
### LIZ STARK STAFF WRITER 
While the American media spent much of
the weekend preparing for Barack Obama's
inauguration and the beginning of a new era in
American politics, in the Middle East, Israel and
Hamas declared individual cease-fires and the
apparent end to a three-week war between the
two.
This latest chapter in the conflict between
Israel and Hamas, the Islamist organization and
majority political party in the Palestinian legis
lature, began when Israel launched what it
described as a defensive military campaign,
titled Operation Cast Lead, against Hamas on
Dec. 27.
The offensive came on the heels of the end of
a six-month cease-fire between Israel and
Hamas that ended on Dec. 19.
Though Stanford students were on winter
break for the majority of these developments.
Stanford faculty and Hoover fellows specializ
ing in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have been
following the events closely. Their reactions and
ideas for the future, however, vary.
Koret Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the
Hoover Institution Dr. Boaz Ganor described
the recent conflict as "the outcome of the uni
lateral decision of Hamas to end the ceasefire."
"From the Israeli point of view, this is a self
defense operation against this war of contrition
created by Hamas," Ganor said. "The Israeli-
Palestinian conflict has come to a situation in
which there is no possible horizon for peace
between the two sides because of the fact that
Hamas will not recognize the right of Israel to
exist as a Jewish state."
W. Glenn Campbell National Fellow at the
Hoover Institution Amichai Magen said that
Hamas, by "launching 70 rockets into Israel"
following the end of the cease-fire, "deliberate
ly provoked Israel."
"I think that there's no doubt that Hamas
and Iran chose to initiate this conflict." he said.
"There's a wealth of evidence to suggest that
the Israelis. Egyptians and other moderate ele
ments in the Middle East took steps to prevent
this conflict."
According to History Prof. Joel Beinin,
"(Israel's] planning for this attack on the Gaza
strip began at the same time the negotiations
for the cease-fire were being held last June."
"Neither side 1 (K) percent kept the cease
fire." Beinin said in reference to the cease-fire
from June to December. "Israel escalated viola
tions to the cease-fire [before it ended on Dec.
