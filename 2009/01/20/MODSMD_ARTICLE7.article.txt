## They won the inaugural ticket Three Stanford students in Washington D.C. today to watch Barack Obama's inauguration 
### VINEET SINGAL 
A few lucky students get to spend
this morning watching a new political
era unfold as Barack Obama steps
onto the inaugural stage. While most
Stanford students plan to view the
proceedings on TV or online —or
simply sleep through them—some
have chosen to go up-close and per
sonal by attending the inauguration
itself.
Erica Emmons '10 is one Stanford
student heading to D.C.
"It's a historic opportunity that,
regardless of what happens next, will
be remembered." she said.
Emmons' tickets were part of a
larger University Presidential
Inauguration Conference (UPIC).
"There are [over] 4,(XX) of us that
will take part in a five-day conference
consisting of keynote speakers —
such as Colin Powell and A 1 Gore —
and culminating in the inauguration
and a gala," Emmons said.

Lincoln Liburd i2. a native of the
United States Virgin Islands, got his
tickets through the Virgin Islands'
Delegate to Congress. He is going to
the inauguration with his sister and
father, and is looking forward to
being at the site where history is
made.
"[I want] to one day be able to tell
my children and grandchildren that I
was there when the first black presi
dent of the United States was sworn
in." he said. "I am going to bring my
cameras and video camera, and hope
to get some good footage of all the
festivities."
Earning a ticket to the inaugura
tion isn't necessarily a serious affair.
Amani Green '08 won his through a
dose of creativity.
"I wrote a rap and sent it into a
contest that my congressman. Rep.
Mike Honda [D-Calif.] was holding,"
Green said.
While it's easy to assume that
attendees are fervent Obama sup

porters, the attitudes these students
have towards the President-elect dif
fer widely.
Green, who is from Egypt, could
not actively show his support while
there. When he returned to the States,
however, he went straight to work.
"I phone banked and went guerril
la flyering from 11 p.m. to 3 a.m. on
the morning of the election for
Obama and [for] No on Props. 4 and
8," he said.
Emmons, on the other hand, sup
ports Obama "insofar as he has the
potential to do great things."
"I have high hopes for the oppor
tunities in front of this nation, but
honestly, I think I sat on the fence,"

she said.
In recent weeks, the President
elect has made numerous choices
regarding his cabinet, the most promi
nent of them being the choice of
Hillary Clinton as Secretary of State.
Views on these choices among the
three attendees vary.
"There are some of his policies
that I like and dislike," Emmons
explained. "It is an intelligent move to
surround yourself with experienced
parties, but it worries me that they're
all from the same camp. Perhaps we
needed to redefine what 'change'
meant."
Green, on the other hand, was
extremely pleased with Obama's cab

inet.
"It is a fresh and totally different
group of people than before," he said.
"I'm excited to see what changes they
will bring to Washington."
Going to the inauguration, while
perhaps a once-in-a-lifetime opportu
nity, can still take valuable time away
from classes.
Emmons, for example, will be
missing two days of classes. A chemi
cal engineering major, she has done
quite a bit of work in advance, and
has a backup plan.
"[l've] lined up a few friends to
borrow notes from when I get back."
she said. "I'm taking my tablet with
me so that I can electronically hand in

my problem sets on time."
Liburd will be missing three days
of classes.
"I'm not concerned about missing
physics and calculus," he said, "112 hut J I
will be taking my books along with
me."
And if it's any consolation for the
three attendees, even professors must
admit that the inauguration is worth
missing a lecture or two.
"I talked to my professors and
most of them have said that it would
be a wonderful experience, and that i(
was line for me to go," Green said
