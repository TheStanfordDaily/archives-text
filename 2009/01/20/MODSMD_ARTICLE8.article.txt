## Student raps to inauguration 
### MEGAN DOHENY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For most, getting tickets to the inauguration of
President-elect Barack Obama can depend on a
first-come-first-served basis, but Amani Green M 2
is going based on a creative rap video she made in
her dorm room.
Inspired by the way in which Obama engaged
the public over the Internet. Congressman Mike
Honda of California's 15th District (which encom
passes Silicon Valley) decided to allocate tickets to
constituents through two online programs. One
program focused on educational initiatives and
another on Faceb(X)k. which Green won by submit
ting her video.
"Originally. I had planned on granting a pair of
tickets to the most deserving entry from each of the
two programs," Honda said in a letter to con
stituents published on his Web site. "As the creativ
ity and thoughtfulness of these submissions from
my Silicon Valley constituents became evident. I
realized it would be impossible to choose just one
entry from each program. In the end. I provided
tickets to 10 constituents who submitted entries."
Green was one of the competitors who stood
out in the competition for a rap song she wrote in
10 minutes.
"My name is Amani. It means aspirations. I'll
tell vou why I want to go to the inauguration."

"I wanted
to do something
creative."
— AMANI GREEN '12,
inauguration ticket winner
Green sang in her rap.
Green s inspiration came from an unconven
tional source: her screen idol, Rupert Grint of
"Harry Potter" fame, who won his role with a rap
song.
"I wanted to do something creative, so I was
thinking about what could make me stand out from
the other entries." Green said. "I am in love with
Rupert Grint. who plays Ron Weasley in "Harry
Potter." He actually wrote a rap for his audition.

and he got the part, so I thought. 'It
worked for him. I should try it."'
Though Green made it clear that
the rap video was "a one-time thing."
she could not be more thrilled to
attend today's historic event.
"I can be proud of America and its
renewed faith in its people," Green
said, referencing the sentiment that
was reflected in several lines of her
contest entry.
"I saw him on TV. I saw him on the
debates, "and whenever I saw Barack
Obama. I couldn't wait, to get back to

the U.S.. and yell and scream and
shout. Barack Hussein Obama is what
this country is all about," Green sang.
Three of the other ticket winners
submitted entries on how to improve
the woes of the education system in
the U.S. Honda says he will consider
incorporating those ideas into legisla
tion.
"The legislation would create an
'Educational Innovation Board' as
part of the economic stimulus pack
age," Honda said on his site. "The
board would award $10 million in
grants for innovative designs or ideas
to help improve the nation's schools
across five categories.
