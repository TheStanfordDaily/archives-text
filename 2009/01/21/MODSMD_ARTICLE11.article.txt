## Senate considers costs of ASSU projects 
### MARISA LANDICHO STAFF WRITER 
With several references to murky bylaws and
a constitution in flux, the Undergraduate Senate
struggled last night to justify the funding for cap
stone projects eight months in the making.
Initiatives for student campaign finance
reform and the ASSU Executive-sponsored
Wellness Room and Bystander Campaign
showed significant progress, but the Senate was
divided on how to pay for the programs in this
era of budget cuts. Moreover, some senators
questioned if these programs, which have been
in the works for over six months, were even nec
essary.
Elections Commissioner Briana Tatum '11
presented the public financing plan, which will
give $750 to each executive slate running for
ASSU office. Qualifying students would receive
the money from the ASSU on the condition that
they would not use personal funds during the
campaign.
Tatum added that the program would include
strict oversight, conducted through her own
office.
All present agreed on the necessity of finance

rules.
"Anyone should be able to able to run for stu
dent body president and vice president, and that
should not be a function of your socio-economic
status," said ASSU Vice President Fagan Harris
'09. "That's not right, and that's not fair."
Costs for campaigning have escalated in
recent years with the introduction of advertising
through T-shirts. Last year, executive slates
(including current executives Dorsey and Harris)
spent as much as $3,5(30 printing shirts to attract
voters. More spending was required for other
advertising methods.
"You need T-shirts to win," said Senator
Stuart Baimel '09, "and if you don't have T-shirts,
you are at a significant disadvantage."
Baimel contended that the program would
create two types of candidates — one group pub
licly financed and another group with the ability
to spend thousands in personal funds. He then
detailed a doomsday scenario where a candidate
would purchase a million shirts to beat the com
petition.
Harris argued that the public financing would
prevent the executive race from becoming an
"arms race."
Senator Luukas lives "09 turned the discussion

from Baimel's game theory to sources of public
funding. Although the Senate as a whole support
ed the theory of public funds, lives was unable to
find a constitutionally approved category to pay
for campaign spending.
"It's an implicit rule that you are not sup
posed to use public financing for shirts," he said,
alluding to the shirt controversy from last quar
ter involving purple anti-Prop. 8 shirts. lives, with
significant knowledge of the bylaws, said the pro
gram would not fit into the Senate budget, the
political budget, special fees or general funds.
In short, he advised the body to create a spe
cial avenue to pay for elections outside of the
current government rules. Further complicating
the process was the fact that the bylaws have
been in the process of revision since last quarter.
Two executive projects, the Wellness Room
and the Bystander Campaign, also faced opposi
tion during the two-and-a-half-hour meeting.
The Wellness Room. Dorsey and Harris'
major mental health initiative, will be a non-stig
matized space where students can get access to
various health resources. Dorsey and Harris
committed to opening the room in Old Union by
the end of winter quarter, but some
senators expressed doubts about the
room's purpose.
"What we should not be doing is
starting programs that may not con
tribute to the problem." Baimel said.
"The one thing we cannot do is panic
and start throwing money around."
Harris defended the project and
said in no way was it thrown together.
The project has been in development
since July, and leaders from Vaden
and other campus health groups have
been consulted. Harris said.
Newly elected Senate Chair
Shelley Gao '11 assured Harris that
the Senate was not withdrawing sup
port. but merely engaging in neces
sary debate.
The second executive initiative,
the Bystander Campaign, will be tar

geted at "bystanders" — those who
see crimes committed, but take no
action. The program is intended to
battle sexual assault, alcohol abuse,
physical violence, eating disorders
and other health issues on campus.
Senators Ana Diaz-Hernandez i 1
and Y vorn " Doc" Aswad-ITiomas i 1,
who worked with the executive cabi
net on the proposal, enumerated pub
licity stunts planned for mid-
February. To raise awareness, they
plan to hold a rally in White Plaza and
coordinate with the Stanford Theatre
Activist Mobilization Project
(STAMP).
Diaz-Hernandez said in the long
term, they were hoping Bystander
would model itself as a briefer
AlcoholEdu.
Although the newly reorganized
Senate debated tough issues and
opened with a strictly business tone,
they could not completely eliminate
the distractions which have plagued
meetings this year.
A Daily column written by Baimel
regarding diversity was originally
included in the agenda, prompting an
exclamation by Baimel and general
uproar amongst the senators.
"I like to keep my roles separate
as opinion leader and opinion
maker," Baimel said.
The columns relevance was never
clarified and Harris had to call the
meeting back on track.
Notably, in her first meeting as
Senate Chair. Gao emphasized
greater transparency and communi
cation within the Senate and to the
student body. She is actively working
on updating the ASSU Web site and
starting a Senate blog.
