## Precourt Institute to launch soon 
### JULIA BROWNELL STAFF WRITER 
At the end of this quarter, the
newly announced Precourt Institute
for Energy will begin work on its
mission to find solutions to the
national energy problem. The
Institute's $100 million of funding
was widely applauded and publi
cized last week, but the exact role of
the Institute isn't yet widely known.
Lynn Orr. director of the new
Precourt Institute for Energy, said
the program is still in the planning
stages.
"It's very much a work in
progress," he said.
However, Orr went on to
describe how the Institute will wrap
together the Global Climate and
Energy Project (GCEP) and exist
ing Precourt Center for Energy
Efficiency projects, as well as create
its own new research center.

The institute will work similar to
the Woods Institute for the
Environment on campus, Orr
explained.
"[The Woods Institute] has a fla
vor that involves bringing people
together to work on solutions for
big environmental problems," he
said. "You can think of [the
Precourt Institute] as a parallel and
a complement to what Woods does,
but with an energy focus."
The Woods Institute does some
energy programming, but as Orr
explained, it is just one of many
environmental programs. The
Precourt Institute will address the
need for extensive energy-specific
research and faculty and graduate
student funding. There should only
be peripheral overlap. Orr assured.
Like Woods, it will approach the
issue of energy from an interdisci
plinary perspective. When Orr
made a list of possible faculty, it

included 137 faculty from 21 differ
ent departments. He speculated that
like Woods, the faculty will hold
joint appointments with their
respective departments and with
the Precourt Institute.
"We will use this huge, strong,
very capable base of faculty." Orr
said."lf you don't have that, none of
this is possible."
However, the recruitment of cur
rent faculty and hiring for new posi
tions cannot begin until the
Institute is recognized as an inde
pendent organization on campus,
according to Orr. And the Institute
is still in the process of getting certi
fied.
ITie Institute will also be able to
support some graduate students
with funding, which will be awarded
in a traditional style involving a
competition among students to
