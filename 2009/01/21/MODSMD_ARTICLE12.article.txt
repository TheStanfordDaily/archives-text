## Precourt Institute to launch soon 
### JULIA BROWNELL STAFF WRITER 
At the end of this quarter, the
newly announced Precourt Institute
for Energy will begin work on its
mission to find solutions to the
national energy problem. The
Institute's $100 million of funding
was widely applauded and publi
cized last week, but the exact role of
the Institute isn't yet widely known.
Lynn Orr. director of the new
Precourt Institute for Energy, said
the program is still in the planning
stages.
"It's very much a work in
progress," he said.
However, Orr went on to
describe how the Institute will wrap
together the Global Climate and
Energy Project (GCEP) and exist
ing Precourt Center for Energy
Efficiency projects, as well as create
its own new research center.

The institute will work similar to
the Woods Institute for the
Environment on campus, Orr
explained.
"[The Woods Institute] has a fla
vor that involves bringing people
together to work on solutions for
big environmental problems," he
said. "You can think of [the
Precourt Institute] as a parallel and
a complement to what Woods does,
but with an energy focus."
The Woods Institute does some
energy programming, but as Orr
explained, it is just one of many
environmental programs. The
Precourt Institute will address the
need for extensive energy-specific
research and faculty and graduate
student funding. There should only
be peripheral overlap. Orr assured.
Like Woods, it will approach the
issue of energy from an interdisci
plinary perspective. When Orr
made a list of possible faculty, it

included 137 faculty from 21 differ
ent departments. He speculated that
like Woods, the faculty will hold
joint appointments with their
respective departments and with
the Precourt Institute.
"We will use this huge, strong,
very capable base of faculty." Orr
said."lf you don't have that, none of
this is possible."
However, the recruitment of cur
rent faculty and hiring for new posi
tions cannot begin until the
Institute is recognized as an inde
pendent organization on campus,
according to Orr. And the Institute
is still in the process of getting certi
fied.
ITie Institute will also be able to
support some graduate students
with funding, which will be awarded
in a traditional style involving a
competition among students to
draw the most talented into the
program.
However, the Institute will not,
at least initially, offer any specific
energy degrees. The purpose of the
Precourt Institute will be to con
centrate and focus faculty, students
and funding for energy issues.
"The Institute is an opportunity
to capitalize on the strength of exist
ing faculty," Orr said, "and to make
the whole thing more visible."
Orr hopes the new visibility will
draw in different funding and
donors, as well as engage students
in the energy questions faced by the
world.
As for the funding of the
Institute, it will begin with the pri
vately funded endowment, but in
the end will come from some pri
vate, some corporate and some gov
ernment funding, according to Orr.
"It will inevitably be a mix," he
said.
Many of those interested in
energy at Stanford are very excited
about the Institute. "By
endowing the faculty and getting
the endowment to support students
as well, we'll be able to stay in there

for the long course," University
President John Hennessy told The
Daily. "The new Precourt Institute
will help integrate a lot of our activ
ities in energy, particularly in the
areas of energy efficiency and
GCEP."
Excitement about the Institute is
already trickling down to the
undergraduate level.
Kirsten Goodsell '12 thinks it
will be especially beneficial for
those already involved in energy
programs on campus. However, she
herself is only "kind of interested"
in energy, and hopes there will be
some way for people like her to also
get involved.
"I hope that [the Precourt
Institute] has programs for people
who aren't necessarily part of
research or majoring in an energy
related program," she said, citing
last Monday's energy panel as an
excellent example of the kind of
programming she would like to see.
When asked why Stanford is a
good place for this kind of program,
Orr talked about the involvement
and excitement evident in faculty
and students.
"It comes down, as much as any
thing, to the fact that we can put
good players on the field," he said.
