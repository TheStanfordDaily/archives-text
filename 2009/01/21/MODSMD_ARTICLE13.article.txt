## EDITORIAL A 						new president, a new political activism 
### 
Yesterday's inauguration of Barack
Obama as the 44th President of the
United States and first black com
mander-in-chief marked not (inly a historic
moment in American history, but also a giant
step towards a new era.The $150 million in
auguration festivities did not overshadow
the overall meaning and significance of the
event as highlighted by President Obama in
his 18-minute speech: a call for responsibility.
The editorial board hopes that we on the
Farm, regardless of political leanings or feel
ings about our new president, are able to
hear this call and continue the same spirit of
political activism that began during the cam
paigns.
While the inauguration was a joyous and
significant event for millions of Americans
and people around the world, the overall
tone of Obama's message was sober: There is
much work to be done. Our society is far
from perfect. We face an economic down
turn. international terrorism, environmental
destruction and a host of other issues we

can't even begin to enumerate.
Even though we look to our government
and our political leaders to carry out the will
of the people, we as citizens must also do our
part and we as students at one of the greatest
universities in the world are in a unique posi
tion to take the lead. We have access to al
most unlimited opportunity, from a wide net
work of Stanford students, alumni and facul
ty to the technological, intellectual and edu
cational resources our University provides.
We have the tools to help make a difference
and we must not waste them.
Getting this work done will require a cer
tain amount of cooperation. We may not all
agree politically, but Obama reminded us
that "our patchwork heritage" is not a weak
ness. but our greatest strength. Republicans,
independents, third parties and Obama skep
tics are important parts of the next steps to
wards economic recovery, foreign policy and
all aspects of our political system.
We need opposing views, alterna
tive perspectives and critics to keep our
government balanced. And as Obama
reminded us: "The question we ask
today is not whether our government is
too big or too small, but whether it
works." 1 ,et s put aside hard-line and ir
relevant party ideology and work to
build an economy and government
that serves the population.

To do this, we must remain politi
cally active. Getting involved, voicing
opinions, advocating, campaigning
and supporting causes are all impor
tant parts of the democratic process.
Obama's usaservice.org is just one
way the new administration is reach
ing out to citizens to help remake our
nation. The site offers email updates
on local service opportunities and
different ways to get involved with
philanthropies in order to give back.
The Weh site's ethos."Renew Amer
ica Together," represents a new.
proactive take on political activism,
where what you do and what vou

stand for matter far more than for
whom you voted or to whom you
gave money.
As we look forward to the next
four years, the editorial board not
only looks forward to the new face of
American politics, with a new presi
dent. hut also to a new energy and
vigor to take the reins of our political
future. Obama's rhetorical skills are
undoubtedly masterful, and his
heartfelt but focused speech Tuesday
morning was undeniably moving. We
must not just appreciate his words for
their eloquence, but also for their
meaning.
