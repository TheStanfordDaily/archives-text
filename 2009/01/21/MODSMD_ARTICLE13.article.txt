						new president, a new political activism 
### 
Yesterday's inauguration of Barack
Obama as the 44th President of the
United States and first black com
mander-in-chief marked not (inly a historic
moment in American history, but also a giant
step towards a new era.The $150 million in
auguration festivities did not overshadow
the overall meaning and significance of the
event as highlighted by President Obama in
his 18-minute speech: a call for responsibility.
The editorial board hopes that we on the
Farm, regardless of political leanings or feel
ings about our new president, are able to
hear this call and continue the same spirit of
political activism that began during the cam
paigns.
While the inauguration was a joyous and
significant event for millions of Americans
and people around the world, the overall
tone of Obama's message was sober: There is
much work to be done. Our society is far
from perfect. We face an economic down
turn. international terrorism, environmental
destruction and a host of other issues we

can't even begin to enumerate.
Even though we look to our government
and our political leaders to carry out the will
of the people, we as citizens must also do our
part and we as students at one of the greatest
universities in the world are in a unique posi
tion to take the lead. We have access to al
most unlimited opportunity, from a wide net
work of Stanford students, alumni and facul
ty to the technological, intellectual and edu
cational resources our University provides.
We have the tools to help make a difference
and we must not waste them.
Getting this work done will require a cer
tain amount of cooperation. We may not all
agree politically, but Obama reminded us
that "our patchwork heritage" is not a weak
ness. but our greatest strength. Republicans,
independents, third parties and Obama skep
tics are important parts of the next steps to
wards economic recovery, foreign policy and
all aspects of our political system.
