# Like a Rock
## All Sung Out 
### 
I am not a fan of a cappella. For those of
you who (somehow) don't know, a cap
pella is the tradition of taking perfectly
good songs and rearranging them so that
people sing all the parts that our forebears'
designed instruments do much, much better.
Stanford (somehow) has nine of these
groups.
Based on science, a cappella began in the
time of cavemen, when our primitive ances
tors would harmonize their rudimentary
caveman utterances into a sound so vile that
it could take down a stegosaurus from 50
paces. How were cavemen and stegosaurus
es, creatures separated by 150 million years,
around at the same time? Ask Testimony.
(For those of you who play drinking
games to my columns, "Testimony" should
be the top "buzzed-word" on your list for
today.)
Now, some may say that my dislike of a
cappella stems from the fact that my own
singing voice sounds like a cross between
Bob Dylan's and some sort of cat pinned

down by a tractor. However, my sense of
jealousy accounts for no more than 15 per
cent of my antipathy. From two songs into
the first Fleet Street performance I saw at
Admit Weekend, I knew that 1 disliked a
cappella. with its overdramatic soloists and
its progressively less ironic use of beatbox
ing.
But unfortunately, a cappella has bur
rowed itself deep into the intestines of Stan
ford like no other system of groups here
have. Take, for example. The O Show — a


Kevin
Webb
ceremony that essentially serves as a
showcase for all nine a cappella or
ganizations and one or two other
performance groups. Not only is
having such a show unfair to the
hundreds of other groups we have
on this campus, it's also unfair to the
hundreds of innocent freshmen who
sit through it in an already very busy
orientation week.
Additionally, whenever dorms
need someone to perform for par
ents, dorm shows or ProFros, a cap
pella groups are normally at the top
of their lists. Why not a dance
troupe, or, much cooler, a rock
hand? At least with a rock band, you
can stand up and dance; with a cap
pella shows, you try to remember
the songs as you once loved them as
you pray for the whiskey you snuck
in to hit soon.
More frightening, unless you stop
them, a cappella groups will multi
ply. For every singer given a spot in a
group, three others are jilted (This is
an estimate. No one wants to fess up
to being rejected by Mixed Co.).
Nursing their wounds, these mem
bers regroup into an even worse a
cappella troupe, calling themselves
something revolting like "the Har
monics."
Now. this is not an attack on
members of a cappella groups — I
count many (or, at least, once count
ed many, depending on how many
people read this column) as friends,
and I'm happy to see people really
enjoying themselves in performanc
es after spending countless hours
charting and learning to sing diffi
cult songs. But why do we need nine
different a cappella shows every
quarter? Why can't groups do more
collaborative shows? The number of
new songs these groups come up
with per quarter is not particularly
high, and 1 think sharing shows
might help whittle down the best
material from each.

On a more social level. I can as
sure you from experience that noth
ing kills a party quite as fast as the
Mendicants drunkenly belting
"Brown-Eyed Girl." Actually, I take
that back — I can only imagine how
terrible a party would be if an inebri
ated Talisman started singing a 40-
minute rendition of the national an
them. And anything by Testimony. 1
fear, would be much, much worse.
1 guess 1 don't really know what I
want to come out of this column,
though I have a few ideas. Maybe we
could see a couple groups merge, or
better yet. we could create a school
wide ban on a cappella group prolif
eration. (If we don't do something
now. our children may be forced to
attend a Stanford with an "'Bos
video game theme music" group, a
"songs of Neil Diamond" group or
maybe even a "jazz-infused Kabbal
ah praise" group.)
Or maybe I'd like to see other
groups on this campus more propor
tionately involved in school events.
We could have fewer rollouts with
Fleet Street singing in the lounge,
and more with Stanford Taiko
pounding the hell out of drums.
That's sure to put a kick in any fresh
man's morning.
Maybe we could even see a day
where a cappella shows engage au
dience members, instead of expect
ing them to pay for admission and sit
through up to 90 minutes of songs
they have mostly heard before.
i think what I want most of all.
though, is to be able to say openly "I
don't really care for a cappella,"
without making it personal. When
the topic comes up. 1 don't want to
have to see if anyone easily offend
ed is around.
I want to be able to state my dis
like proudly, because it means that I
have discovered something about
my personal tastes, which, really, is
what the arts community we need
here should be about: self discovery
through interaction with art. So if
you like a cappella or if you're a
member of a group, that's fantastic
I hope you'll keep doing what
you love and won't hate me for writ

ing this. But if you don't fall into ei
ther of those categories, know that
it's OK not to like every thing.
Even Testimony.

group, three others are jilted (This is
an estimate. No one wants to fess up
to being rejected by Mixed Co.).
Nursing their wounds, these mem
bers regroup into an even worse a
cappella troupe, calling themselves
something revolting like "the Har
monics."
Now. this is not an attack on
members of a cappella groups — I
count many (or, at least, once count
ed many, depending on how many
people read this column) as friends,
and I'm happy to see people really
enjoying themselves in performanc
es after spending countless hours
charting and learning to sing diffi
cult songs. But why do we need nine
different a cappella shows every
quarter? Why can't groups do more
collaborative shows? The number of
new songs these groups come up
with per quarter is not particularly
high, and 1 think sharing shows
might help whittle down the best
material from each.

On a more social level. I can as
sure you from experience that noth
ing kills a party quite as fast as the
Mendicants drunkenly belting
"Brown-Eyed Girl." Actually, I take
that back — I can only imagine how
terrible a party would be if an inebri
ated Talisman started singing a 40-
minute rendition of the national an
them. And anything by Testimony. 1
fear, would be much, much worse.
1 guess 1 don't really know what I
want to come out of this column,
though I have a few ideas. Maybe we
could see a couple groups merge, or
better yet. we could create a school
wide ban on a cappella group prolif
eration. (If we don't do something
now. our children may be forced to
attend a Stanford with an "'Bos
video game theme music" group, a
"songs of Neil Diamond" group or
maybe even a "jazz-infused Kabbal
ah praise" group.)
Or maybe I'd like to see other
groups on this campus more propor
tionately involved in school events.
We could have fewer rollouts with
Fleet Street singing in the lounge,
and more with Stanford Taiko
pounding the hell out of drums.
That's sure to put a kick in any fresh
man's morning.
Maybe we could even see a day
where a cappella shows engage au
dience members, instead of expect
ing them to pay for admission and sit
through up to 90 minutes of songs
they have mostly heard before.
i think what I want most of all.
though, is to be able to say openly "I
don't really care for a cappella,"
without making it personal. When
the topic comes up. 1 don't want to
have to see if anyone easily offend
ed is around.
I want to be able to state my dis
like proudly, because it means that I
have discovered something about
my personal tastes, which, really, is
what the arts community we need
here should be about: self discovery
through interaction with art. So if
you like a cappella or if you're a
member of a group, that's fantastic
I hope you'll keep doing what
you love and won't hate me for writ

ing this. But if you don't fall into ei
ther of those categories, know that
it's OK not to like every thing.
Even Testimony.
