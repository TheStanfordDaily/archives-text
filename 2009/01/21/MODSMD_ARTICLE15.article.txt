# Like a Rock
## All Sung Out

I am not a fan of a cappella. For those of
you who (somehow) don't know, a cap
pella is the tradition of taking perfectly
good songs and rearranging them so that
people sing all the parts that our forebears'
designed instruments do much, much better.
Stanford (somehow) has nine of these
groups.
Based on science, a cappella began in the
time of cavemen, when our primitive ances
tors would harmonize their rudimentary
caveman utterances into a sound so vile that
it could take down a stegosaurus from 50
paces. How were cavemen and stegosaurus
es, creatures separated by 150 million years,
around at the same time? Ask Testimony.
(For those of you who play drinking
games to my columns, "Testimony" should
be the top "buzzed-word" on your list for
today.)
Now, some may say that my dislike of a
cappella stems from the fact that my own
singing voice sounds like a cross between
Bob Dylan's and some sort of cat pinned

down by a tractor. However, my sense of
jealousy accounts for no more than 15 per
cent of my antipathy. From two songs into
the first Fleet Street performance I saw at
Admit Weekend, I knew that 1 disliked a
cappella. with its overdramatic soloists and
its progressively less ironic use of beatbox
ing.
But unfortunately, a cappella has bur
rowed itself deep into the intestines of Stan
ford like no other system of groups here
have. Take, for example. The O Show â€” a
