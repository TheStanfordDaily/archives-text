# Leaner, Meaner Seniors
## Let me watch Al Jazeera 
### 
I'm sick of the big three and of buying
American. CNN, Fox News and MSNBC
are blurring together and I need a
change. Is anyone else tired of the news tick
ers where celebrity mishaps and the disap
pearance of small, blond children are the
most trumpeted stories over and over
again?
On political coverage, sure. MSNBC and
Fox have used partisan commentators to
generate some entertaining stuff. We are
now able to find out who the "worst person
in the world" is and learn about cooking at
home with Sarah Palin. But I want more
than just gimmicks, waving Hag animations
and spirited yelling matches about who is
the more corrupt political hack.
CNN's less bombastic but fairly pre
dictable coverage isn't doing it either. In
cluding Anderson Cooper in half of the pro

grams is not a long-term solution. Really, he
can't cover everything himself.
The U.S. needs to legalize A 1 Jazeera
English, launched in 2006 as the self-ex
planatory offshoot of the Qatar-based Ara
bic news channel.
Technically. I guess it is legal. But accord
ing to Al Jazeera's Web site and a New York
Times article on Jan. 12. the channel is only
available on three local cable providers in

the entire U.S. — hardly accessible
for casual viewing. Though it is
slightly comforting to know that one
of the providers is in Washington,
D.C. the other two locations are the
burgeoning metropolises of
Burlington. Vermont and Toledo,
Ohio.
Who cares about Al Jazeera?
Isn't it the TV station of terrorists
out to get the U.S.? The conservative
advocacy group Accuracy in Media
even has an entire documentary de
voted to this evil called "Terror Tele
vision: The Rise of Al Jazeera and
the Hate America Media."
For perspective. Accuracy in
Media also has a Web page called
the Obama Truth Campaign with
fun tidbits like "Obama's childhood
mentor was a member of the Com
munist Party USA and filled
Obama's head with anti-American
thoughts." Cool-headed analysis all
the way.
Back to Al Jazeera, though, the
interesting thing about its anti-
American rap is that when it started.
Arab critics labeled it as a U.S.
mouthpiece because of its penchant
for covering issues like human rights
and democracy in a region without a
great record on either. A New York
Times article from July 4. 1999, 30
months after the original Al
Jazeera's launch.detailed how Saudi
Arabian officials were already
grumbling ominously (they would
eventually ban the channel) and
how the Algerian government actu
ally turned off electricity in several
major cities during an Al Jazeera
segment on the civil war there.
Only after Al Jazeera's coverage
of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan
was less than flattering did Ameri

cans like Donald Rumsfeld start to
accuse it of aiding al Qaeda and
having a singular agenda of bashing
the U.S.The channel has frequently
shown videos made by Osama bin
Laden and similar bad guys, but it
has never, as critics often claim,
shown videos of Western hostages
being decapitated.
And showing what Bin Laden
and others have said is not necessar
ily a bad thing, even though U.S. of
ficials have ealled the channel a
"mouthpiece" for extremists. If only
Rumsfeld or anyone had actually
listened to Al Jazeera's first inter
view with Osama bin Laden when it
aired way back in 1999. they might
have noted his plan, which he de
scribed publicly and in great detail,
of luring the U.S. into a war of over
reaction in the Middle East, which
would bog it down and sap its re
sources. Oops.
Along with condemning Al
Jazeera (and at one point expelling
its reporters from Iraq) the LJ.S. has
"accidentally" bombed its offices
twice according to news reports and
the Committee to Protect Journal
ists (CPJ) — first in Kabul on Nov.
13, 2001, and then in Baghdad on
April 8, 2003. In each instance, the
office location was well-known and
Al Jazeera said it had provided the
coordinates of the offices to the U.S.
military ahead of time to avoid such
a mishap. I know our intelligence
has been bad. but two bombings of
the same news organization in two
different war zones? More suspi
ciously, a Freedom of Information
Act request filed by CPJ that sought
more information on the Baghdad
attack was denied bv the Pentagon
in late 2006.
Even if Al Jazeera does have an
anti-American slant, that is no rea
son to bomb it.and no reason to ban
it here — particularly the new Eng
lish version which is now broadcast
in 100 other countries. It's the cover

age that other networks lack that
make Al Jazeera worth watching.
Sometimes seeing the footage of
what happens after a U.S. (or Israeli)
bomb hits the wrong building is im
portant for the public, even if un
pleasant. And when there is cover
age of bin Laden or interviews with
people that hate the U.S., great. Isn't
it better to learn more about this
point of view than to black it out and
pretend it doesn't exist?
A debate at Stanford last week
organized by the Ethics in Society
program was focused on seeking
middle ground between liberals and
libertarians. Both sides noted free
dom of information and expression
as one of their most important
shared values. So what about con
servatism? In Saudi Arabia, this
might be an ideology of censorship,
but it's not here. Few conservatives
would tell you they don't believe in
freedom of speech, press or opinion.
Why then, do cable providers
stand so fearful of a negative reac
tion if they include the channel?
"The idea that certain channels
would effectively be banned is me
dieval." the channel's managing di
rector Tony Burman. a Canadian,
told the New York Times in May
2008. And he's right. Again, think
Saudi Arabia.
Last summer in Burlington, Ver
mont. the city-owned cable compa
ny was petitioned to drop Al Jazeera
English, flow can so many people
(or at least enough to mobilize a pe
tition) demand censorship of some
thing they probably wouldn't watch
anyway? Those of us who do want to
watch it deserve the opportunity.
For now, at least, there's always
You Tube.

Michael started watching AJE while
working abroad last summer. Has
anyone else seen it? He and his co
columnist Sagar Doshi can be reached

it here — particularly the new Eng
lish version which is now broadcast
in 100 other countries. It's the cover

age that other networks lack that
make Al Jazeera worth watching.
Sometimes seeing the footage of
what happens after a U.S. (or Israeli)
bomb hits the wrong building is im
portant for the public, even if un
pleasant. And when there is cover
age of bin Laden or interviews with
people that hate the U.S., great. Isn't
it better to learn more about this
point of view than to black it out and
pretend it doesn't exist?
A debate at Stanford last week
organized by the Ethics in Society
program was focused on seeking
middle ground between liberals and
libertarians. Both sides noted free
dom of information and expression
as one of their most important
shared values. So what about con
servatism? In Saudi Arabia, this
might be an ideology of censorship,
but it's not here. Few conservatives
would tell you they don't believe in
freedom of speech, press or opinion.
Why then, do cable providers
stand so fearful of a negative reac
tion if they include the channel?
"The idea that certain channels
would effectively be banned is me
dieval." the channel's managing di
rector Tony Burman. a Canadian,
told the New York Times in May
2008. And he's right. Again, think
Saudi Arabia.
Last summer in Burlington, Ver
mont. the city-owned cable compa
ny was petitioned to drop Al Jazeera
English, flow can so many people
(or at least enough to mobilize a pe
tition) demand censorship of some
thing they probably wouldn't watch
anyway? Those of us who do want to
watch it deserve the opportunity.
For now, at least, there's always
You Tube.

I'm sick of the big three and of buying
American. CNN, Fox News and MSNBC
are blurring together and I need a
change. Is anyone else tired of the news tick
ers where celebrity mishaps and the disap
pearance of small, blond children are the
most trumpeted stories over and over
again?
On political coverage, sure. MSNBC and
Fox have used partisan commentators to
generate some entertaining stuff. We are
now able to find out who the "worst person
in the world" is and learn about cooking at
home with Sarah Palin. But I want more
than just gimmicks, waving Hag animations
and spirited yelling matches about who is
the more corrupt political hack.
CNN's less bombastic but fairly pre
dictable coverage isn't doing it either. In
cluding Anderson Cooper in half of the pro

grams is not a long-term solution. Really, he
can't cover everything himself.
The U.S. needs to legalize A 1 Jazeera
English, launched in 2006 as the self-ex
planatory offshoot of the Qatar-based Ara
bic news channel.
Technically. I guess it is legal. But accord
ing to Al Jazeera's Web site and a New York
Times article on Jan. 12. the channel is only
available on three local cable providers in

the entire U.S. — hardly accessible
for casual viewing. Though it is
slightly comforting to know that one
of the providers is in Washington,
D.C. the other two locations are the
burgeoning metropolises of
Burlington. Vermont and Toledo,
Ohio.
Who cares about Al Jazeera?
Isn't it the TV station of terrorists
out to get the U.S.? The conservative
advocacy group Accuracy in Media
even has an entire documentary de
voted to this evil called "Terror Tele
vision: The Rise of Al Jazeera and
the Hate America Media."
For perspective. Accuracy in
Media also has a Web page called
the Obama Truth Campaign with
fun tidbits like "Obama's childhood
mentor was a member of the Com
munist Party USA and filled
Obama's head with anti-American
thoughts." Cool-headed analysis all
the way.
Back to Al Jazeera, though, the
interesting thing about its anti-
American rap is that when it started.
Arab critics labeled it as a U.S.
mouthpiece because of its penchant
for covering issues like human rights
and democracy in a region without a
great record on either. A New York
Times article from July 4. 1999, 30
months after the original Al
Jazeera's launch.detailed how Saudi
Arabian officials were already
grumbling ominously (they would
eventually ban the channel) and
how the Algerian government actu
ally turned off electricity in several
major cities during an Al Jazeera
segment on the civil war there.
Only after Al Jazeera's coverage
of the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan
was less than flattering did Ameri

cans like Donald Rumsfeld start to
accuse it of aiding al Qaeda and
having a singular agenda of bashing
the U.S.The channel has frequently
shown videos made by Osama bin
Laden and similar bad guys, but it
has never, as critics often claim,
shown videos of Western hostages
being decapitated.
And showing what Bin Laden
and others have said is not necessar
ily a bad thing, even though U.S. of
ficials have ealled the channel a
"mouthpiece" for extremists. If only
Rumsfeld or anyone had actually
listened to Al Jazeera's first inter
view with Osama bin Laden when it
aired way back in 1999. they might
have noted his plan, which he de
scribed publicly and in great detail,
of luring the U.S. into a war of over
reaction in the Middle East, which
would bog it down and sap its re
sources. Oops.
Along with condemning Al
Jazeera (and at one point expelling
its reporters from Iraq) the LJ.S. has
"accidentally" bombed its offices
twice according to news reports and
the Committee to Protect Journal
ists (CPJ) — first in Kabul on Nov.
13, 2001, and then in Baghdad on
April 8, 2003. In each instance, the
office location was well-known and
Al Jazeera said it had provided the
coordinates of the offices to the U.S.
military ahead of time to avoid such
a mishap. I know our intelligence
has been bad. but two bombings of
the same news organization in two
different war zones? More suspi
ciously, a Freedom of Information
Act request filed by CPJ that sought
more information on the Baghdad
attack was denied bv the Pentagon
in late 2006.
Even if Al Jazeera does have an
anti-American slant, that is no rea
son to bomb it.and no reason to ban
it here — particularly the new Eng
lish version which is now broadcast
in 100 other countries. It's the cover

age that other networks lack that
make Al Jazeera worth watching.
