# Leaner, Meaner Seniors
## Let me watch Al Jazeera 
### 
I'm sick of the big three and of buying
American. CNN, Fox News and MSNBC
are blurring together and I need a
change. Is anyone else tired of the news tick
ers where celebrity mishaps and the disap
pearance of small, blond children are the
most trumpeted stories over and over
again?
On political coverage, sure. MSNBC and
Fox have used partisan commentators to
generate some entertaining stuff. We are
now able to find out who the "worst person
in the world" is and learn about cooking at
home with Sarah Palin. But I want more
than just gimmicks, waving Hag animations
and spirited yelling matches about who is
the more corrupt political hack.
CNN's less bombastic but fairly pre
dictable coverage isn't doing it either. In
cluding Anderson Cooper in half of the pro

grams is not a long-term solution. Really, he
can't cover everything himself.
The U.S. needs to legalize A 1 Jazeera
English, launched in 2006 as the self-ex
planatory offshoot of the Qatar-based Ara
bic news channel.
Technically. I guess it is legal. But accord
ing to Al Jazeera's Web site and a New York
Times article on Jan. 12. the channel is only
available on three local cable providers in
