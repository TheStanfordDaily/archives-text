## Debugging Microsoft's advertising 
### 
With a recently released commercial
that once again features the beloved
"Mac" and "PC"' characters, Apple
has decided to twist the knife a little deeper
into the heart of Microsoft's most obvious
shortcoming — its lack of compelling advertis
ing in comparison to the genius of Apple's
marketing.
By now. the premise of Apple's ongoing
"Mac-PC"' ad campaign should be a familiar
one: The pasty, staid figure of the PC (John
I fodgman, a contributing writer to "The Daily
Show" and The New York Times Magazine)
acts as a foil to the quirky, charismatic figure of
the Mac (Justin Long, an actor better known
for these commercials than his actual movies)
in their perennial competition for computer
retail supremacy.
In this particular commercial. PC" sits at a
desk allegedly allocating funds for the Mi
crosoft budget. Meaning, for every five bun
dles of money put in the formidable "Advertis
ing" pile, he puts only one in the meager "Fix
Vista" pile that lies neglected on the other side
of the table. When Mac asks him if he really
thinks that amount of money is going to help
fix Vista. PC' admits that Mac is right.and shov
els the entirety of the funds over to the "Adver
tising" pile in a gesture of defeat.
The idea is. of course, that improving Win
dows Vista is so hopeless that the only thing left
for Microsoft to do is pump more money into

advertising. And while there is no doubt that
Microsoft spends more money in a fiscal year
on advertising than Apple, the disparity is en
tirely due to the fact that Microsoft is a much
bigger corporation, n fact, it almost seems hyp
ocritical for Apple to criticize Microsoft for
having a sizable advertising budget, when
Apple itself spent a whopping $486 rqillion on
advertising this past fiscal year alone. Given
that Apple is actually better known for its ad
campaigns, could this commercial be read as
just another instance of the pot calling the ket
tle black?
I wouldn't waste time comparing the two
corporations' budgets;oddly enough, the num
bers themselves would be irrelevant. When it
comes to advertising, it is not the amount that
is spent, but the way in which it is spent that re
ally matter. And when it comes to that, this
commercial can be read as an outright mock
ery of the fact that, no matter how much
money Microsoft pours into its advertising, it
will not make a difference until the Microsoft
marketers learn how to use it properly.
In fact. Microsoft's previous campaigns for
Vista could very well be compiled into a book
on what not to do when designing a commer
cial. The first Vista ad. launched in November
2(XJ6, was more PowerPoint presentation than
television commercial, not to mention com
pletely alienating for all non-business PC' users
(the '80s elevator music pulsing in the back

ground didn't help much either). Later, a sec
ond Vista commercial dubiously compared the
feeling of seeing the first rocket launch into
space with the feeling one would get when
opening Windows Vista — a shaky premise at
best, considering I don't know anyone who
says "Wow" when booting up a computer, no
matter what operating system is running.
Nowadays. Microsoft has thankfully taken
a page from Apple's advertising portfolio —
namely, abandoning all mention of the oper
ating system and just giving people a good
show.These new ads feature spritely interac
tions between comedian Jerry Seinfeld and
Bill Gates himself, during which it is fascinat
ing to watch the animated Seinfeld act along
side the understated Gates (whose sickly pal
lor suggests that this may be his first time out
of the house in years). But no matter how
many jokes Seinfeld cracks, there is still some
thing missing that keeps these commercials
no more than mediocre; because although
they actually surpass the Apple ads in terms
of entertainment, that entertainment does
not works towards making you want to own a

PC. For all intents and purposes, you
might as well just be watching an old
rerun of Seinfeld.
This is probably because, whether
appealing to people's needs or to
their senses of humor, Microsoft
continues to miss the crux of all ad
vertising — people's desires. Their
marketers may have meant to show
case Bill Gates as the richest man in
America in the new ads, but they also
failed to link owning a PC with that
kind of achievement. And unfortu
nately for Microsoft, Apple's adver
tising excels at this exact feat of link
ing the intangible to the tangible.
Apple commercials sell the Mac not
as a product, but a personality — the
mysterious summation of what it
means to be a friendly, likeable per
son. By buying a Mac, we are also im
plicitly offered something that can
not be bought, which is also, of
course, what everyone wants — an
identity.
Creating a sense of self for a prod
uct in 30 seconds or less may seem like
a little too much to ask of a computer
commercial. But in today's cutthroat
marketplace, one must keep up with
the competition. And if Apple has an
offer on the table like that, then Mi
crosoft has no choice but to try and
match it.
Whether they will succeed —
well, for Microsoft's sake, let's hope
history won't repeat itself.
