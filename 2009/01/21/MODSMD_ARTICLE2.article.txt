## Students watch as Obama is sworn in Lucky few head to Washington for inauguration 
### LIZ STARK KATE BARBER 
Most students watching yesterday's inauguration
from the comfort of their dorm lounges, or perhaps at
parties at the CoHo or Women's Community Center,
knew they were witnessing history in the making. But
for some students, watching yesterday's inauguration
activities was even more significant.
Chiara Essig" 12 made the trip to Washington. D.C.
to watch the inauguration in person with two other
members of her dorm.
"I love Obama. and it was just sort of a given that
I would go," Essig said. "1 planned it before he was
even elected, assuming he would be elected, and I got
my tickets a couple of days after the election."
Essig added that the environment in Washington.
D.C. was as powerful an experience as the inaugura
tion itself.
"It's a historic moment, and it's really cool that I
got to be there," Essig said. "The environment is
insane.There are so many people everywhere you go."
She cited an experience in the D.C. subway as an
indication of the city's climate yesterday. Essig had wit
nessed a fight on the crowded Metro that was settled by
a reference to Obama. A mere mention of the new
president could instantly calm crowds in the capital city.
"Maybe you have to be here to understand how
crazy it is," she said.
Eli Pollak '12, who also attended the inauguration
festivities, said the trip was easy for him to arrange as
a resident of D.C.
"For inauguration, we got there at 1:30 in the
morning and camped out in the freezing weather on
the mall, the closest you could get [to the inaugura
tion podium] without a ticket." he said.
Pollak also said that he woke up at 4 a.m. on
Sunday to attend the concert at Lincoln Memorial,
and that he worked the coat check at an inaugural
ball Sunday night, where he saw celebrities such as
Samuel 1.. Jackson, Oprah Winfrey and Chris Tucker.
"I think that one of the coolest things was how

[the inauguration] resonated with different people
in different ways." Pollak said. "Behind us, there
were three black women who were really into the
religious aspect of it and for whom it was some
thing they may well have thought they would never
see."
The inauguration of America's first black presi
dent also moved Pollak. who described the experi
ence as "visceral."
"There were two million people there, and every
one of them was there for a different reason." Pollak
said.
Ashwin Mudalair '09, president of the Stanford
Democrats, couldn't make it to Washington, but
watched yesterday's events with great interest from
the jam-packed CoHo. Mudalair has been involved in
the campaign process for months, if not years.
"It was a civilized affair compared to Election
Night," Mudalair said. "The atmosphere was more
deferential toward what was happening on television.
Specifically, people listened to the speech. It was the
highlight of the ceremony."
Although the choice of Obama for the Democratic
nominee seems obvious now. Mudalair said he wasn't
always an Obama supporter.
"I started to support Obama on Feb. 5, Super
Tuesday," Mudalair said. "His message of change res
onated very strongly with the American people. He
was the best person for the job "
Although the busiest period is over for the
Stanford Democrats, the group will continue to have
low-key policy talks and lunches to stay involved
until the next campaign begins in 2010.
Volleyball player Spencer McLachlin "11 watched
Obama yesterday with special interest. Just weeks
ago during winter break, he played a game of basket
ball with the new President.
McLachlin's dad coached a young Obama on the
Punahou School's 1979 Hawaii state championship
