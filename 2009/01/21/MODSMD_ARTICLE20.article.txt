## Change at last after 45 years of disillusionment 
### 
On November 25. 1963, I sat on my
mother's lap in our living room. I"he
funeral cortege hearing the body of
John F. Kennedy was on TV. My mother, a
strong and stoic lowan, began to weep. Just
six years old. I had understood in a rudimen
tary way that a terrible thing had happened.
But my mother's tears, so infrequent as to
be remarkable, marked for me the gravity of
a nation in mourning. Remembering that
day. I now understand that it was the begin

ning of a terrible grief that would be com
pounded over and over again in my lifetime
— a stark loss of idealism.
Five years later, when I was 11 and just be
ginning to come of age. Martin Luther King,
Jr. was shot, then Robert F. Kennedy. Viet
nam was burning, Cambodia was decimated.
This country was seething with race riots and
anti-war demonstrations; the news and print
media poured out the horrors of war every
single day. It was a fiery and unstable world in
which to grow up.
I love the United States and I believe
deeply in the ideals of liberty and democracy,
of personal responsibility and the ability of
human beings to effect positive change by
the exercise of their wills. But a lifetime of
problems — Watergate, Reaganomics, the
Gulf War, Clinton/Lewinksy and eventually
eight years of a presidency I found personal
ly abhorrent — 45 years of disillusionment
had brought me to a place of political cyni
cism and disappointment in my country.

Yesterday, watching the inauguration of
Barack Obama. I felt something about my
country that I have not felt since I was a very
small child: hope. Not the hope of political
sloganeering, but the hope, as Hmily Dickin
son wrote, that has wings. Hope that things
can change for the better, that in a world be
sieged by hatred, violence and intolerance,
"the better angels of our nature" can rise to
the surface. Hope that we can survive the cur
rent economic mire, learn from our mistakes
and come out stronger on the other side.
Hope that the intelligence and the capacity
for curiosity inherent in human beings will
enable us to employ sustainable, renewable
ways of living on this magnificent and irre
placeable planet.
In my lifetime, I have seen a man stand on
the steps of a university and attempt to use
his political power to bar the entrance of
African-American students. Yesterday, I saw
an African-American man mount the steps
of the United States Capitol and take the

oath of office as President of the United
States. My mother didn't live quite long
enough to see this wonderful inauguration.
She would have loved it.and I guarantee she
would have cried again. I did. Yesterday, for
the first time in a very long time, I was incred
ibly proud of my country.
