# Campus surprisingly uninvolved in police brutality case
## 
### 
The inauguration of President Barack
Obama has many people from all
across the political spectrum declaring

that we have entered a "post-racial Ameri
ca," where the color of one's skin no longer
determines the course of one's life. While I
love the beautiful Bay Area. I feel that recent
events in this region have proven decisively
that we have not even begun to move beyond
race.
Months ago, in late October, we witnessed
Palo Alto Police Chief Lynne Johnson make
remarks that seemed to condone racial pro
filing by Palo Alto police officers, officers
whose patrols literally surround our campus.
After mass outcry in response to her re
marks, Johnson eventually decided to resign
from her position as police chief. Her deci
sion was motivated in no small part by stu
dent activism on this issue and responses
from official University channels, which
made it clear to the police department and to
Johnson that such discrimination and viola
tion of Constitutional rights would not be tol-
erated.
More recently, we witnessed the
shooting of Oscar Grant by BART
police officer Johannes Mehserle.
For those who missed this headlining
story. Grant was a black Hayward
resident riding home on the BART
in the early hours of Jan. 1, 2009.
After fighting with another passen
ger, Grant was detained by BART
police officers at the Fruitvale Sta
tion in Oakland.The officers pushed
him down on the floor and re
strained his arms, then Mehserle
pulled out his pistol and shot the un
armed Grant in the back.
While police brutality against
young men of color is not uncom
mon and frequently goes unpun
ished. Grant's death was different
because the incident was recorded
by a number of witnesses who then
uploaded the videos to Youtube and
released them to the media. Outrage

at the videos led to protests in Oak
land that soon turned violent, and
eventually compelled Alameda
County District Attorney Tom
Orloff to charge Mehserle with mur
der. Mehserle was finally arrested on
Jan. 13, nearly two weeks after the
shooting.
While this tragic case is a clear vi
olation of Grant's civil rights and
more evidence of a trend of police
brutality against men of color, we
have yet to see the kind of uproar
that was generated by Chief John
son's remarks. Perhaps because this
did not occur in the city adjacent to
us, we believe that we are not direct
ly affected by it. If so, we are very
mistaken. Stanford students fre
quently use public transportation in
the area,and are no more immune to
an incident like this than any other
resident of the region.
Our response to Chief Johnson
showed that we are aware of our po
tential to act collectively and shape
the environment in which we live
and go to school. What we must rec
ognize, however, is that one outcry is
not enough: we must sustain our ac

tivism as events like these continue
to occur.
Though Mehserle has been
charged, this issue is by no means
concluded. Police carry guns to en
sure the safety of the citizens they
protect and themselves, and as such
must be trained in the appropriate
use of lethal force. With three such
cases having occurred in recent
years, BART police practices are in
need of significant revision and
modification. Overall, police in the
area must be held accountable for
their actions and must understand
that illegal violence against resi
dents of any background will be
punished.
We cannot allow another death
like Oscar Grant's to occur, and we
cannot rely on a witness with a video
camera to ensure that it does not. In
stead, we as a university and a stu
dent body must continue to mobilize
against injustice and create an envi
ronment of equality in this region we
call home.
