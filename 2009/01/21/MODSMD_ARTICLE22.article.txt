"We played pretty well " Muller said. "We both
served and volleyed well. We played well together."
It was one of the few times Muller and Wire had
teamed up in doubles. After defeating the defend
ing national doubles champions, the duo might be
here to stay.
"Coach [John Whitlinger] is pretty happy with
what (Richard and Ij did down there," Muller said.
This was the second straight Sherwood finals ap
pearance for Muller, who advanced to last year's dou
bles final before losing to a team from Baylor. This
year, however. Muller was able to get the victory.

fell to Farah. 7-5, 6-2. Clayton made the seventh

sophomore Greg Hirshman, and Muller all won
their opening round matches. Freshman Ted Kelly,
junior Richard Wire, freshman Ryan Thacher and
junior Matt Bruch all suffered first round defeats.
