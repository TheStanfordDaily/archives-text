## Cardinal splits matches in the Rockies 
### ZOE LEAVITT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a weekend of polar opposite finishes, Stan
ford wrestling de-feathered the Air Force Fal
cons with a crushing 32-7 victory, but fell to the
claws of the Northern Colorado Bears 25-7.
Wrestling with a full lineup and with every
wrestler in their correct weight class for the first
time this season, the Cardinal came together to
roll over Air Force in eight of 10 matches. The
eight wins were the most that Stanford has post
ed in any match this year, and the 25-point mar
gin of victory is by far the season's largest.
"Our guys were excited about getting a full
lineup together," coach Jason Borrelli said.
"Maybe because of our youth, when the guys are
excited, they are more likely to win."'
Redshirt senior Luke Feist scored his ninth
pin of the season, bringing his total up to 23 for his
career. One more pin will bring him to fifth place
on the Stanford career chart. Redshirt freshman

Nick Amuchastegui — on a hot streak that does
n't appear to be cooling in the least — scored two
more wins this weekend. I ie has shut down eight
opponents in a row and climbed from the 10th
most-winning freshman in history on Friday to
the ninth most-winning on Saturday.
Amuchastegui's victory over Air Force's
Stephen Crozier also made him the third Stan
ford wrestler to reach 20 wins this season, along
with junior Jake Johnson and redshirt sopho
more Lucas Espericueta. Last year,only five Car
dinal wrestlers achieved that record over the
course of the season. Under the tutelage of assis
tant coach Matt Gentry, who himself achieved
one of Stanford's best ever rookie seasons in
2002, Amuchastegui seems on course to replicate
Gentry's rookie season path.
Fellow freshman Matt Winterbourne, who
wrestled in his collegiate debut last weekend,
achieved his first win on Saturday. Anchoring the
team's previously empty heavyweight position,
Winterbourne defeated his Air Force opponent

9-3.Two difficult opponents last weekend, includ
ing 15th-ranked Columbia wrestler Ryan Mores,
prepared him to overcome the more typical com
petition on Saturday.
In another first, junior Tyler Parker returned
to competition for the first time since February
2(X)7. earning a victory over Air Force's Alec
Williams at 149 pounds. Max Rosefigura, who
had been holding the 149-pound spot so far this
season.took it back to battle Northern Colorado
the next day.
Having two potential starters at 149 pounds
creates the kind of competition that the coaching
staff hopes to foster.
"Any time you've got the heat of battle in the
room.that sa good thing," Borrelli said."We had
planned to trade them off this weekend so they
both could get matches in. depending on who will
be our starter. Tyler performed great under the
tough circumstances."
Hie weekend started off on a downbeat for
the Cardinal, as freshman Matt Sencenbaugh

GAME NOTES: The Stanford men's wrestling team comes
home after splitting its road trip in Colorado, where it beat Air
Force 32-7 and then lost to Northern Colorado 25-7. The
Cardinal will host three different teams in one day next Friday,
beginning with conference rival Oregon State at noon.

could not hold onto his lead and lost the first
match.
"Though we lost the first match. Matt fought
hard and still scored some points." Borelli said.
"ITlhat fired us up."
That fire blazed for the next five
matches, carrying Stanford far into the
lead. Sophomore Porfirio Madrigal
took the second match by a nine-point
margin, achieving the first of the team's
six bonus-point victories throughout
the day. Redshirt sophomore Cameron
Teitelman scored his first major deci
sion win of the year, and after Parker's
victorious debut, Espericueta contin
ued the glory by scoring the team's sec
ond bonus-point victory.
Amuchastegui then defeated one of
the Falcons' two NCAA qualifiers,
Stephen Crozier.
"I'd wrestled him before so it was
interesting," Amuchastegui said.
"When they know how you beat them
the first time ... you have to try to beat
them a different way the second time."
He did so, taking the lead quickly and
holding on for the win.
Freshman Victor Haug fell to the
Falcons' second NCAA qualifier,Tyler
French, but three more victories by
Johnson, Feist and Winterbourne se
cured the Cardinal win.
However, Northern Colorado
turned the tables to crush Stanford 25-
7 the next day. The elevation also
proved an unexpected obstacle that af
fected the team's fitness level and abil
ity to perform.
"The elevation really got to us, and
there's no way to train for that,"

Amuchastegui said.
"The guys got winded more easily,
and it was really dry," Borrelli agreed.
"We couldn't prepare for that other
than hoping you're in good enough
shape to rise above it."
The Bears won the first five match
es of the day. Madrigal suffered only his
second dual loss of the season, while
Espericueta lost his lead in the final
three seconds of his match. At 165
pounds, Amuchastegui continued his
winning streak, ending the Bears'
streak in the process.
"It kind of fires me up when we're
getting our butts kicked." Amuchastegui
commented on his victory.
Feist, at 197 pounds, achieved the
Cardinal's only other victory of the
day. He defeated freshman Patrick
Carey to bring Stanford's score up to
seven.
"I am disappointed in certain parts
of the match," Borrelli said. "I don't
think we wrestled that bad against Col
orado. but we lost four matches in the
last 30 seconds. [Those] four matches
could easily have gone the other way."
The coach took it as a learning ex
perience.
"That's the credit to [Northern Col
orado] for knowing how to win the
close matches," he said."[W]e still need
to figure that out."
The Cardinal now takes a week off.
before returning to the home mats on
Jan. 30 to face Oregon State. Portland
State and Princeton.
