## Cardinal splits matches in the Rockies 
### ZOE LEAVITT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
In a weekend of polar opposite finishes, Stan
ford wrestling de-feathered the Air Force Fal
cons with a crushing 32-7 victory, but fell to the
claws of the Northern Colorado Bears 25-7.
Wrestling with a full lineup and with every
wrestler in their correct weight class for the first
time this season, the Cardinal came together to
roll over Air Force in eight of 10 matches. The
eight wins were the most that Stanford has post
ed in any match this year, and the 25-point mar
gin of victory is by far the season's largest.
"Our guys were excited about getting a full
lineup together," coach Jason Borrelli said.
"Maybe because of our youth, when the guys are
excited, they are more likely to win."'
Redshirt senior Luke Feist scored his ninth
pin of the season, bringing his total up to 23 for his
career. One more pin will bring him to fifth place
on the Stanford career chart. Redshirt freshman

Nick Amuchastegui — on a hot streak that does
n't appear to be cooling in the least — scored two
more wins this weekend. I ie has shut down eight
opponents in a row and climbed from the 10th
most-winning freshman in history on Friday to
the ninth most-winning on Saturday.
Amuchastegui's victory over Air Force's
Stephen Crozier also made him the third Stan
ford wrestler to reach 20 wins this season, along
with junior Jake Johnson and redshirt sopho
more Lucas Espericueta. Last year,only five Car
dinal wrestlers achieved that record over the
course of the season. Under the tutelage of assis
tant coach Matt Gentry, who himself achieved
one of Stanford's best ever rookie seasons in
2002, Amuchastegui seems on course to replicate
Gentry's rookie season path.
Fellow freshman Matt Winterbourne, who
wrestled in his collegiate debut last weekend,
achieved his first win on Saturday. Anchoring the
team's previously empty heavyweight position,
Winterbourne defeated his Air Force opponent

9-3.Two difficult opponents last weekend, includ
ing 15th-ranked Columbia wrestler Ryan Mores,
prepared him to overcome the more typical com
petition on Saturday.
In another first, junior Tyler Parker returned
to competition for the first time since February
2(X)7. earning a victory over Air Force's Alec
Williams at 149 pounds. Max Rosefigura, who
had been holding the 149-pound spot so far this
season.took it back to battle Northern Colorado
the next day.
Having two potential starters at 149 pounds
creates the kind of competition that the coaching
staff hopes to foster.
"Any time you've got the heat of battle in the
room.that sa good thing," Borrelli said."We had
planned to trade them off this weekend so they
both could get matches in. depending on who will
be our starter. Tyler performed great under the
tough circumstances."
Hie weekend started off on a downbeat for
the Cardinal, as freshman Matt Sencenbaugh
