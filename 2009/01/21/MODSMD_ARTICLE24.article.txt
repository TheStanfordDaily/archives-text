ry. "When he's consistent, we're in good shape. He's easy to set
to, and he makes my job easy."
"Evan had a good weekend for us," head coach John Kosty
said. "He played at a consistently high level."
In the third set. the Cardinal staved off three set points before
a pair of freshmen, middle blocker Gus Ellis and outside hitter
Brad Lawson, combined for the block on match point.

first match in the stadium since they won the national title game
there against UCLA in 1997.

JACLYN TANDLER/The Stanford Daily
The Stanford men's volleyball team soared to a pair of wins this
weekend to dispatch No. 1 4 Ohio State and No. 1 3 Ball State
on the road. The Cardinal swept both matches 3-0.
ago, we only had 12 guys. Now we
have a 20-man roster, and any guy
eould lead the team in kills on any
night."
The Cardinal used this depth for
defense as well, holding Ball State
under .200 hitting in each set.
"Spencer and Brad and the libero
Erik [Shoji] had tremendous ball
control," Kosty said. "They put a lot
of pressure on Ohio State and Ball
State in both siding out and scoring
points. We were in system a lot more
than they were, and it gave us many
more point-scoring opportunities."
Despite a rare 10 hitting errors in
the second set alone, the Cardinal hit
.314 for the match and cruised to vic
tory in both the first and third sets. In
the second set. though, Romero had
a clutch block on set point for Ball
State that helped the Cardinal rally
to take the set.
The win was the first match for
Stanford in Muncie since the Cardi

nal lost the national championship
game to Pepperdine there in 1992.
The Cardinal hopes to use the
momentum from these two convinc
ing wins in its upcoming conference
matches. After facing a 20-below
zero wind chill in the Midwest, the
Cardinal now returns to California,
only to face two of the top teams in
the country. On Friday, Stanford will
travel to Los Angeles to take on No.
6 USC. The next night, the Cardinal
will head over to Malibu to face No.
4 Pepperdine.
"This is the weekend," Kosty said.
"This is when the true rankings start
coming out, the real start of the
MPSF season. It should be a good
eauge to see where we truly are in
the MPSF."
The players echoed their coach's
excitemeni about their upcoming
games.
"Last season we got swept on the
same road trip," McLachlin said.
"We'd like to come back with a cou
ple of 'W's, but they are both really
good teams, so it'll be a tough trip."
"This weekend is huge," Kawika
Shoji said. "We're facing two hostile
crowds and two good teams, and it

would be great to come out with two
wins. It would really legitimize the
rankings."
These rankings recently slid Stan
ford ahead of Pepperdine for the No.
3 spot, but the Cardinal players know
this means nothing unless they can
back it up on the court.
"We're getting rewarded for
some good wins," Shoji said. "Hope
fully we continue to rise, but we still
have room to improve, which is ex
citing."
"It's a good feeling, but it's how we
finish that matters," McLachlin said.
"No one will remember the standings
in the second week of January, but
everyone will remember the stand
ings in the second week of May, and
that's what we're shooting for."
In order to maintain these rank
ings, the Cardinal must beat the top
teams, and it will have many oppor
tunities. Nine of its next 10 matches
are against teams in the top 10.
The Cardinal returns home lor its
opener on Jan. 30 against Long
Beach State.
