## Fast start for track and field 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA STAFF WRITER 
I"he Stanford men sand women's track and Held teams got
off to a great start this weekend with their season opener at
the I Iniversity of Washington.
Hie women — who hegan the weekend ranked No. 17 in
the nation — were led by sophomore Brittni Dixon-Smith,
who finished third in the long-jump with a leap of 19-8 3?4,
and fourth in the prelims of the 60 meters with a time of 7.75
seconds. Also competing in the 60 meters, in her season debut,
was freshman sprinter Joy ()"l lare.who finished seventh with
a time of 7.91 seconds. In the 60-meter hurdles, the women
featured senior Idara Otu and freshman Jordan Merback,
who finished third and fourth with times of 9.13 seconds and
9.25 seconds, respectively.
The No. 25 men were led by an impressive first place finish
by senior Myles Bradley. Bradley led the way in the 60-meter
hurdles with a NCAA pre wisional time of 7.85 seconds,a mere
seven hundredths of a sect >nd off his own school record 0f7.78
seconds, set during the last season. Bradley also ran the 60
meter race, finishing third with at time of 6.92 seconds.
Another hurdler for the Stanford men was junior J.J. Jack
son. who qualified for the finals with a time of 8.39 seconds.
Sophomore Casey Roche provided another NCAA provi
sional mark, winning the pole vault with a height of 17-1. 112 el
low sophomore Corey Dysick finished in fourth place with a
mark ofl6-1 1?4.
Another incredible race for the men featured junior Ryan
Pisicaro, who won the men's 60 meters with a time of 6.85 sec
onds. I isicaro. who had been injured on and off for the past
two seasons, made an amazing comeback, not only winning
the event, but also notching a time barely short of senior
Wopaino Osaisai's school record of 6.83 seconds. Bradley, a
team captain,commented on I isicaro's performance.
"I lis personal record and win in the 60 meters moves him
from not being in the top 10 to No. 2 all-time for Stanford in
the 60 meters," said Bradley.'He is just
.02 off of the school record."
The ability to achieve provisional
marks and near-record times this early
in the season gives the team hope that
2009 could be another big year for the
program.
"The meet went great this week
end," Bradley said. "Most people were
on the distance medley relays, which
were a lot of fun and a great way for
runners to make the transition from
cross country to track season or for the
younger athletes to get their first taste
of indoor track.
"There were also some great early
performances that made us optimistic
about the coming season," he contin
ued. "Casey Roche's provisional mark
and win in the pole vault was a high
light ... Our team is closer than I've
ever seen it, and that unity will hopeful
ly be reflected to success on the track."
One newcomer looking to make a
big impact this season on the women's
side is redshirt freshman Shataya Hen
dricks, who will make her Stanford
debut this coming weekend. The en
thusiastic athlete has had a difficult
time containing her talent and energy
for an entire year as she dealt with frus
trating injuries, but now Hendricks is
looking forward to finally showcasing
her skills en route to some Cardinal
wins.
"Since my injury 1 have been work
ing hard to realize how to get back on
the track, and now 1 am so excited that
the time has finally come for me to get
the chance to run this weekend," she
said. "We have a great team this year
and my goal is to contribute to the suc
cess of the team in the sprint events."
In high school, Hendricks was the
Florida state 3A champion in the 1(X)
meters, 200 meters. 4xl (X) meter relay
and 4x4(X) meter relay. A U.S. Junior
National Team Member and a High
School All-American. Hendricks
should play a big role in the upcoming
success of the team with her raw ener
gy and speed.
This weekend. Stanford track and
field will continue its early-season slate
of competition as it heads to Albu
querque, NM for the New Mexico Sil
ver and Cherry Classic.
