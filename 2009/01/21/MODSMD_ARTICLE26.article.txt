# Obama's sporting ties
## 
### 
In honor of yesterday's inauguration
of Barack Obama as the 44th presi
dent of the United States, I think it's
time to take a look at Obama in the con
text of the sports world.
Obama's election has a layered rela
tionship to sports, whether it is through
his much publicized love for basketball,
his disdain for the BCS or his continua
tion of the dream of equal rights cham
pioned by great athletes past and pres
ent.
As the first black president. Obama
has further bridged the racial divide in
the United States,a gap that athletes and
sports had previously helped to narrow.
Whether through Jesse Owens' four
gold medals in the 1936 Berlin Olympics
in front of a Nazi audience or Jackie
Robinson braving bigotry to break
baseball's color barrier in 1947, sports
have continually been a means to
achieving the type of equality that has
eventually allowed for the election of
Barack Obama as president.
Before separate but equal was
deemed unequal by the Supreme Court,
white and black athletes participated to
gether on the same fields and courts.
White youths were introduced to black
athletes on the radio, in the newspaper
and through the love of competition, as
black athletes themselves eventually
came to be seen as players,and not black
players.
While sports are not. by any means,
the reason for Barack Obama's presi
dency, they are undoubtedly a contribut
ing factor to the continuing civil rights
movement.
On a lighter note, Obama himself is a
man of sport. I le played basketball at
Punahou High School in Hawai i, and
was actually pretty good. If you don't be
lieve me, try a quick You Tube search
and you'll see the silky smooth lefty in
action back in high school.
Obama continues to play basketball
regularly, including on Election Day
with some of his staff. He also made a
visit to the University of North Carolina,
where he played a little with the Tar
1 leels basketball team on the campaign
trail last year.
Sports have also made their way into
()bama's policy discussions. 1 le has pub
licly called for a college football playoff
system. His idea would be a three
round, eight-team playoff to replace the
Bowl Championship Series. I le. at one
point in his campaign, said t hat changing
the BCS was something he aimed to do
as president.
1 le has since tempered that discus
sion.stating that there are more pressing
issues facing the country — details, real
ly, like fighting two wars and the worst
economic crisis in years. But try telling
that to fans at l Itah,Texas and l S(
Obama is not the first president to
take an interest in or to try to have an
impact upon sports. In fact, there is a
long tradition of sports-related presi
dencies.
Teddy Roosevelt saw the impor
tance of sports in American culture, as
he was once quoted as saying,"C)nly ag
gressive sp<>rtscan create the brawn, the
spirit, the self-confidence,and quickness
of men essential for the existence of a
strong nation."
I lis successor, William Taft, forever
left his mark on the sports world by cre
ating— accidentally, mind you — the
seventh inning stretch in baseball. Taft
was a big guy. and when he attended
baseball games, which he did regularly,
he had to stand and stretch during the
game. Out of respect for the president,
everyone else in the stadium would
stand with him.
I xiter. President I •Eisenhower created
the President's Council on Physical Fit
ness and Sports in order to ensure that
American students were exposed to
physical education classes as children.
Hopefully Obama will continue this
legacy, as physical education classes are
struggling to receive ample funding na
tionwide.
Both President C ieorge W. Bush and
his father have sp< >rts connections. Bush
41 captained the Yale baseball team to
two College World Series appearances,
and his son is a former owner of the
Texas Rangers.
Maybe it is the competitive nature of
sports and the competitive nature of
politics, or maybe it is just dumb luck,but
sports and politics will forever be inter
twined. And maybe more than ever this
time around.

Daniel liohm is pretty sure presidential
elections would he more interesting if there
were a hall involved. ( ontaet liim at
