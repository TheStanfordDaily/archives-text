## Women's gymnastics readies for Sun Devils at home opener 
### 
The Stanford women's gymnas
tics team will host its home opener
against Arizona State this Thursday
at Burnham Pavilion starting at 7
p.m. The meet will be a good indica
tor of the women's progress through
their heavy training this season.
The women's team, under the di
rection of head coach Kristen Smyth,
has been steadily on the rise in the
college scene. Stanford has had back
to-back Super Six placements (com
peting on the last day of NCAA
Championships for the national
title), two top-three NCAA finishes
in the last five years and three Pac-10
titles in the last five years, with Smvth

coaching 12 All-Americans since the
beginning of her eight-year tenure.
"This team gets better all the time
and they want to get better at each
practice," Smyth said. "What I'm
learning this year is that their goal is
to get better and better every week
end. We've finally established a con
tinuity and team tradition and I think
that is really important to our suc
cess.
"We've really created something
to build on from here on out," she
continued. "All of us have really
worked hard to get to this place and
the athletes have a lot of pride in this
program. 1 think that is what it really
means to be a Stanford gymnast."
