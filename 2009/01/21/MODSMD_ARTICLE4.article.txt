## Professors analyze inauguration Kennedy, Rakove and Fiorina talk Obama 
### JENNY REMPEL STAFF WRITER 
Barack Obama's inauguration yes
terday will surely go down in the histo
ry books of tomorrow. To put the
events into a meaningful historical con
text, The Daily spoke with History

Profs. David Kennedy and Jack
Rakove and Political Science Prof.
Morris Fiorina about their thoughts on
the day.
Kennedy, who has commented
widely in the press about Obama's
election and inauguration, spoke about
the meaning of the event.
"One of the things that we forget
about in all the excitement is that this is
a ritual that happens on a regular cal
endar schedule every four years," he
said. "It's one sign of our constitutional

stability. In the World War II era. Great
Britain suspended elections for the
duration of the war — that's the
world's oldest democracy — and we
did not. I think that's a really remark
able thing about our constitutional sys
tem."
Kennedy thought Obama's inaugu
ration speech struck a good balance
and was an appropriate start for his
presidency.
