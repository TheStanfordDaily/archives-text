## Professors analyze inauguration Kennedy, Rakove and Fiorina talk Obama 
### JENNY REMPEL STAFF WRITER 
Barack Obama's inauguration yes
terday will surely go down in the histo
ry books of tomorrow. To put the
events into a meaningful historical con
text, The Daily spoke with History

Profs. David Kennedy and Jack
Rakove and Political Science Prof.
Morris Fiorina about their thoughts on
the day.
Kennedy, who has commented
widely in the press about Obama's
election and inauguration, spoke about
the meaning of the event.
"One of the things that we forget
about in all the excitement is that this is
a ritual that happens on a regular cal
endar schedule every four years," he
said. "It's one sign of our constitutional

stability. In the World War II era. Great
Britain suspended elections for the
duration of the war — that's the
world's oldest democracy — and we
did not. I think that's a really remark
able thing about our constitutional sys
tem."
Kennedy thought Obama's inaugu
ration speech struck a good balance
and was an appropriate start for his
presidency.
"The inaugural is not a State of the
Union; it's not a time to go in to detail
about policy," he said. "It's a time
when presidents try to set a tone, and
I thought he set a very good tone. It
was very sober, it was composed, it
wasn't over the top."
Much of the buzz surrounding
Obama's election has centered on the
historical significance of swearing in
the first black president, but Kennedy
applauded Obama's understated way
of handling the racial significance of
the moment.
"He's underplayed the race factor
the whole way through; it speaks for
itself," Kennedy said. "The whole
world knows — all you have to do is
look at the guy. But what was
remarkable is what he said, that this
country went from truly deeply racist
and formally legally segregated soci
ety to the pretty much open society
that it is today in two generations,
and that's a remarkable achievement
for any society."
Kennedy believes Obama's presi
dency has the unique potential to be a
turning point in history.
"I thought the single most striking
thing he said that caught my ear was
when he said we're a young nation,
but the time has come to set aside
childish things." Kennedy said. "That
bespoke a certain sense of history that
I find quite intriguing. He seems to
think that we've reached a phase in
our long evolution where we have to
start doing things substantially differ
ently— it can't be just business as
usual."
Rakove, who talked with The
Daily from Oxford, England, spoke
with the same cautious historical per
spective as Kennedy.
"As a historian, I want to be cau
tious about conflating a dramatic,
highly visible event like this with all
of the decisions and all the politics
that will come out of it out in the
next two to four years." he said. "The
historian in me says however much
pageantry there is, however many
people turn out, whatever mood it
sparks, the reality of politics is the
details of making decisions and
developing policies and seeing how
well they are executed."
But Rakove, who compared
Obama's election to that of John F.
Kennedv, was also struck bv the

excitement of the moment.
"It's almost impossible for anyone
— scholar to casual observer, even at
this distance [being in England] —
not to be struck by the amount of
emotional energy that Americans in
general have invested in this
moment," he said.
When asked about the historical
significance of the new President's
race. Rakove spoke of Martin Luther
King, Jr.
"1 think the best way to push the
American story forward is to say the
inauguration is not about the sym
bolism of race or the politics of race,
it's about the content of Obama's
character —to use the famous
phrase from Martin Luther King,"
Rakove said.
Fiorina gave ITie Daily a political
scientist's perspective on the inaugu
ration.
"For the larger population, it's a
chance for a new beginning — this
population has gotten tired of the
unnecessary conflict that we've been
experiencing for the last couple
decades, and Obama's whole
approach to politics is exactly what
they are looking for," he said. "It's a
ray of optimism that we can only
hope is justified."
Taking responsibility was one of
the themes of Obama's inaugural
address, and Fiorina said it has been a
growing theme of the Democratic
Party.
"TTie Democratic Party as a whole
got in trouble in the '70s and "80s and
early ,( X)s as not emphasizing respon
sibility enough," he said. "It's bringing
the Democratic Party more in line
with traditional American values in
that respect. I think that given the
economic difficulties of the time. I
think he's trying to set expectations
correctly — there are no magic bul
lets: we have to take responsibility for
our own selves."
While the inaugural events are
largely ceremonial by nature, Fiorina
said the pomp and circumstance of
the day is important.
"There are rituals and there are
symbols that are important, and I
think it reminds us that we are one
people," he said. "If you just look at
the faces of people and just how many
tears are shed. 1 think the rituals are
important to society."
