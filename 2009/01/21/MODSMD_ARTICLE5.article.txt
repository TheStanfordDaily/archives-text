## STANFORD CELEBRATES INAUGURATION 
### STACIE CHAN STAFF WRITER 
On a campus where students typical
ly consider waking up for a 9 a.m.
class an excruciating punishment,
dozens of students congregated as
early as 8 a.m. to tune in to the
inauguration of President Barack Obama.
ITiough the majority of the Stanford communi
ty could not make the long trek to Washington
D.C., nor get tickets, there were many alterna
tives to watch the historic inaugural address.
From East Campus to West Campus, organ
izations, dorms, communities and groups of
friends were glued to television screens, taking
in every minute of the festivities, from the
entrance of high-profile individuals to the
humbling of Obama's presidential oath of
office (due to a slip-up bv Chief Justice John
Roberts) to Reverend Joseph Lowery's roll
call of colors.
Caught up in inauguration fever, residents
scrambled to lounges and even congregated in
dining halls to witness history.
"I never get up this early, but this is worth
it," said Olivia I iaas'l I. who attended an inau
guration party in the Grove Lasuen lounge.
"This is a momentous occasion, and since I
can't be in D.C., I want to watch it live to make

sure I don't miss anything. I even want to take
pictures of the TV as if I were there!"
This excitement seemed contagious to
many Stanford students and administrators as
well. Dean Julie Lythcott-Haims'B9, a dedicat
ed volunteer for the Obama campaign, also
threw a party at her home in Palo Alto as a way
to ring in the new president.

"I wanted to provide a way for local people
to come together and share this historic event
in the same spirit that Obama's campaign had
been — strangers coming together for a com
mon purpose," she said. "While we weren't in
D.C. we could share the experience and feel
the exhilaration that happens when you do
come together and join with other people."

The Women's Community Center (WCC)
also held an inauguration viewing, with the
same open spirit in mind, welcoming everyone
into the Fire Truck House. All couch space and
chairs were occupied, with people continuous
ly streaming in. devoting whatever few minutes

they had before class to catch a
glimpse of the live inauguration
footage. To accompany the viewing,
the WCC offered bagels, coffee and
other pastries to attendees. But the
free food, usually the highlight of
many Stanford events, took a back
seat to the highly anticipated inaugu
ration.
"It's so great to see the spirit of
political interest among Stanford
students," said Maryam Liaqat '09, a
WCC staff member. "I think
Obama's presidency sort of res
onates with us as academics and
intellectuals because of his academic
background, which is really fresh
after eight years of President Bush.
This inauguration finally reflects a
new era that 1 thought would never
happen: not just Bush leaving, but
someone amazing entering the
White House."
Over in Old Union, both flat
screen TVs were monopolized to
maximize viewing capacity, and the
Muslim Student Awareness Network
(MSAN) also held a viewing party.
Approximately 50 students at the
CoHo watched with the same inten
sity, gasping in complete disbelief
when one of the TVs went out. Not
wanting to miss a minute of footage.

students rapidly shuffled toward the
other TV rather than waste precious
time waiting for it to be fixed.
And at all these locations through
out the morning, students' cheers
and applause could be heard for Vice
President Joe Biden and President
Obania as if the students were
amongst the roaring crowd at the
Capitol.
Though the daily routine of class
es seemed to interrupt much of the
inauguration viewing, some profes
sors even continued the discussion of
the inauguration well into their class
time. English Prof. Michele Elam led
a toast in her lecture course
"Introduction to African and
African American Studies," which
spent an hour discussing the implica
tions and rhetoric of Obama's inau
gural address.
"It's so rare to recognize that we
are in history," she said.
The partying even continued
hours later at the Black Community
Services Center's "inaugural Ball: A
Toast to Change, Hope and the New
President."
Co-sponsored by nine other
organizations, the Inaugural Ball was
"also a way to get the ethnic commu
nities to come together and unify.

which means a lot to us," said Natie
Ermyas Ml, program coordinator of
the Black House. The Ball began
with a replay of President Obama's
inauguration address, then featured
a speech and formal "Toast to
Change" from Jan Barker-
Alexander, director of the Black
House and Resident Fellow (RF) of
Ujamaa.
With glasses of sparkling cider in
hand, fans of Obama even had the
chance to take a picture with a card
board cutout of the new President.
The committee members wanted to
"keep it classy," insisting that every
one come dressed in their best to
simulate an actual D.C. ball, accord
ing to Ruby Garrett MO, the other
program coordinator of the Black
House.
"This is just a way to celebrate in
a fun, festive, classy way," Ermyas
said. "But at the same time, it's a
time to internalize that he really is
our president and this is history in
the making."

the exhilaration that happens when you do
come together and join with other people."

The Women's Community Center (WCC)
also held an inauguration viewing, with the
same open spirit in mind, welcoming everyone
into the Fire Truck House. All couch space and
chairs were occupied, with people continuous

Participants relaxed at the Black Community Services Center before the Inaugural Ball. The event featured a replay of Obama's inaugural address
a cardboard cutout of Obama and dressed up-students.
they had before class to catch a
glimpse of the live inauguration
footage. To accompany the viewing,
the WCC offered bagels, coffee and
other pastries to attendees. But the
free food, usually the highlight of
many Stanford events, took a back
seat to the highly anticipated inaugu
ration.
"It's so great to see the spirit of
political interest among Stanford
students," said Maryam Liaqat '09, a
WCC staff member. "I think
Obama's presidency sort of res
onates with us as academics and
intellectuals because of his academic
background, which is really fresh
after eight years of President Bush.
This inauguration finally reflects a
new era that 1 thought would never
happen: not just Bush leaving, but
someone amazing entering the
White House."
Over in Old Union, both flat
screen TVs were monopolized to
maximize viewing capacity, and the
Muslim Student Awareness Network
(MSAN) also held a viewing party.
Approximately 50 students at the
CoHo watched with the same inten
sity, gasping in complete disbelief
when one of the TVs went out. Not
wanting to miss a minute of footage.

students rapidly shuffled toward the
other TV rather than waste precious
time waiting for it to be fixed.
And at all these locations through
out the morning, students' cheers
and applause could be heard for Vice
President Joe Biden and President
Obania as if the students were
amongst the roaring crowd at the
Capitol.
Though the daily routine of class
es seemed to interrupt much of the
inauguration viewing, some profes
sors even continued the discussion of
the inauguration well into their class
time. English Prof. Michele Elam led
a toast in her lecture course
"Introduction to African and
African American Studies," which
spent an hour discussing the implica
tions and rhetoric of Obama's inau
gural address.
"It's so rare to recognize that we
are in history," she said.
The partying even continued
hours later at the Black Community
Services Center's "inaugural Ball: A
Toast to Change, Hope and the New
President."
Co-sponsored by nine other
organizations, the Inaugural Ball was
"also a way to get the ethnic commu
nities to come together and unify.

which means a lot to us," said Natie
Ermyas Ml, program coordinator of
the Black House. The Ball began
with a replay of President Obama's
inauguration address, then featured
a speech and formal "Toast to
Change" from Jan Barker-
Alexander, director of the Black
House and Resident Fellow (RF) of
Ujamaa.
With glasses of sparkling cider in
hand, fans of Obama even had the
chance to take a picture with a card
board cutout of the new President.
The committee members wanted to
"keep it classy," insisting that every
one come dressed in their best to
simulate an actual D.C. ball, accord
ing to Ruby Garrett MO, the other
program coordinator of the Black
House.
"This is just a way to celebrate in
a fun, festive, classy way," Ermyas
said. "But at the same time, it's a
time to internalize that he really is
our president and this is history in
the making."

glued to the television, rather than sleeping or going to class.
