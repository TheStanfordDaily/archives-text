## STANFORD CELEBRATES INAUGURATION 
### STACIE CHAN STAFF WRITER 
On a campus where students typical
ly consider waking up for a 9 a.m.
class an excruciating punishment,
dozens of students congregated as
early as 8 a.m. to tune in to the
inauguration of President Barack Obama.
ITiough the majority of the Stanford communi
ty could not make the long trek to Washington
D.C., nor get tickets, there were many alterna
tives to watch the historic inaugural address.
From East Campus to West Campus, organ
izations, dorms, communities and groups of
friends were glued to television screens, taking
in every minute of the festivities, from the
entrance of high-profile individuals to the
humbling of Obama's presidential oath of
office (due to a slip-up bv Chief Justice John
Roberts) to Reverend Joseph Lowery's roll
call of colors.
Caught up in inauguration fever, residents
scrambled to lounges and even congregated in
dining halls to witness history.
"I never get up this early, but this is worth
it," said Olivia I iaas'l I. who attended an inau
guration party in the Grove Lasuen lounge.
"This is a momentous occasion, and since I
can't be in D.C., I want to watch it live to make

sure I don't miss anything. I even want to take
pictures of the TV as if I were there!"
This excitement seemed contagious to
many Stanford students and administrators as
well. Dean Julie Lythcott-Haims'B9, a dedicat
ed volunteer for the Obama campaign, also
threw a party at her home in Palo Alto as a way
to ring in the new president.

"I wanted to provide a way for local people
to come together and share this historic event
in the same spirit that Obama's campaign had
been â€” strangers coming together for a com
mon purpose," she said. "While we weren't in
D.C. we could share the experience and feel
the exhilaration that happens when you do
come together and join with other people."

The Women's Community Center (WCC)
also held an inauguration viewing, with the
same open spirit in mind, welcoming everyone
into the Fire Truck House. All couch space and
chairs were occupied, with people continuous
ly streaming in. devoting whatever few minutes
