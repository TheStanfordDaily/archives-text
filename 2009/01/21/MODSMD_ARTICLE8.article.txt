# STUDENT LIFE
## Society for Queer Liberation rallies 
### KATE BARBER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
While it certainly didn't compare to the animated pre-election
Obama and No-on-Prop.-8 rallies of fall quarter, yesterday's noon
Inaugural rally by the Emma Goldman Society for Queer
Liberation showed that students are still concerned about queer
rights.
The rally was sparsely attended, but those who converged on
the Claw were enthusiastic, as cheers could be heard all the way
at Tresidder.
With a theme of "What did Obama promise you?," the rally
had organizers asking students passers by to write what they
believe the new president has promised them on posters placed
on the Bookstore steps. The posters contained student-written
messages of hope for queer liberation as well as universal health
care, improved public education and defense of the Constitution.
Amanda Gelender '10, an organizer of the rally, said the
poster exhibit had been up since 8 a.m. and would remain up
until 4 p.m., allowing students to add messages throughout the
day.
"We're asking students to write what they're fighting for over
the next four years," Gelender said. "The rally will be about
Obama's agenda of equality."
Jenna Queenan '1 l.also an organizer,said she had canvassed
for Obama, but that this rally emerged from the campaign
against California's Proposition 8, which passed in early
November.
"Today is about Obama's promises," Queenan said. "He
made a lot of promises, and that is why a lot of us are behind
him."
Though the rally focused on the aspirations of the Queer
community in the new administration, Queenan acknowledged
that it had larger implications.
"The rally is not all about queer rights," she said, noting that
"many student groups" were involved. "Today is about coalition
building."
And in the spirit of hope and unity fitting for yesterday's new
beginning, a rally speaker called for "not red or blue states, but
united states."
