Before a jubilant crowd of more than a million.
Barack Hussein Obama claimed his place in history
as America's first black president, summoning a
dispirited nation to unite in hope against the "gather
ing clouds and raging storms" of war and economic
woe.
On an extraordinary day in the life of America,
people of all colors and ages waited for hours
Tuesday in frigid temperatures to witness a young
black man with a foreign-sounding name take com
mand of a nation founded by slaveholders. It was a
scene watched in fascination by many millions —
perhaps billions — around the world.
"We gather because we have chosen hope over
fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord." the
nation's 44th president said.
The presidency passed to Democrat Obama from
Republican George W. Bush at the stroke of noon,
marking one of democracy's greatest gifts: the peace
ful transfer of power.
But a stark transfer all the same. In one of the new
administration's first acts, Obama ordered federal
agencies to halt all pending regulations until further
review.
And even though new White House aides strug
gled to find offices and work intercoms, an over
hauled www.whitehouse.gov Web site was running
under Obania's banner within minutes of his swear
ing-in. "Change has come to America."it declared.
Obama plunges into his new job in earnest on
Wednesday after capping inaugural festivities at a
national prayer service in the morning, meeting with
his economic team and Iraq advisers and welcoming
a stream of public visitors into the White House
while Congress gives his economic revival plan a
going-over and takes up the nomination of Hillary
Rodham Clinton to be secretary of state. Her confir
mation has been held up for now by Republican con
cern over the foundation fundraising of her husband,
the former president.
The new president had been buoyant and relaxed
through the three days of preinaugural festivities. But

he seemed somber as he stood on the Capitol steps,
placed his left hand on the Bible used by Abraham
Lincoln and repeated the inaugural oath "to pre
serve. protect and defend" a Constitution that origi
nally defined blacks as three-fifths of a person. A
deafening cheer went up.
"What is required of us now is a new era of
responsibility — a recognition, on the part of every
American, that we have duties to ourselves, our
nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudg
ingly accept but rather seize gladly," Obama said.
"This is the price and the promise of citizenship."
On the inaugural parade route, Obama and his
wife, Michelle, climbed out of the heavily armored
presidential limousine and walked a few blocks along
famed Pennsylvania Avenue, waving to adoring
crowds under the watchful eyes of security agents.
Hours later, they put the day's formality behind
them to swirl through 10 inaugural balls. With the
president in white tie and the first lady in a white
one-shouldered gown by 26-year-old New York
designer Jason Wu. their first dance was to Beyonce
singing the Etta James classic "At Last."'"Tonight, we
celebrate. Tomorrow, the work begins," Obama said
at the Commander in Chief Ball.
Throughout his inaugural address, an 18-minute
sermon on civic duty. Obama wove a thread of per
sonal responsibility and accountability. A liberal
Democrat proposing billions of dollars in new spend
ing, Obama nonetheless spoke of the limits of gov
ernment.
"It is the kindness to take in a stranger when the
levees break, the selflessness of workers who would
rather cut their hours than see a friend lose their job
which sees us through our darkest hours." he said. "It
is the firefighter's courage to storm a stairway filled
with smoke, but also a parent's willingness to nurture
a child, that finally decides our fate."
Obama's 10-year-old daughter, Malia, aimed a
camera at her father as he spoke. Michelle leaned
onto the edge of her seat, body tensed and brow knit
ted.
"Starting today, we must pick ourselves up. dust
