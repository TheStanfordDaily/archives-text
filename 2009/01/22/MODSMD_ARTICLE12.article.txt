## Common flu virus invades dorms 
### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Norovirus, the contagious stomach flu
like infection, has made an appearance on
campus. A few residents in Faisan in
Florence Moore Hall (FloMo) and Roble
Flail have experienced symptoms similar to
those of the virus, which also hit the
University of Southern California (USC)
last semester.
"We have PHEs [Peer Health Educators]
in the dorms who keep Vaden informed of
any outbreaks of infectious illnesses on cam
pus. with a confidential online reporting sys
tem," said Vaden Director of Medical
Services Robyn Tepper in an email to Hie
Daily
"When we are alerted to a significant
cluster of 'stomach viruses," which happens
periodically, we have the staff pyst hand
washing and hygiene flyers, deploy misting
disinfectant with instructions, make sure they

have an adequate supply of clean-up kits and
check adequacy of housekeeping services,
including weekend coverage, if needed,"
Tepper added.
The virus can spread from person to per
son through direct contact or through expo
sure to infected feces or vomit. One can also
contract the disease bv ingesting foods or
drinks that have been contaminated.
According to Medicine.net, the Norovirus
infection typically starts quickly.
Persons infected with the Norovirus often
experience nausea, vomiting, watery non
bloody diarrhea and stomach cramps, though
vomiting is more common in children than
adults. Sometimes, a low-grade fever can also
develop. Additional symptoms include chills,
headache, muscle aches and a general sense
of tiredness.
Hie Web site indicates that 30 percent of
Norovirus cases are asymptomatic infections,
meaning that while the person is infected, he
or she shows no symptoms of the virus.

Efforts to prevent the
Norovirus are especially impor
tant in student dorms, where
person-to-person contact and
food and drink sharing is preva
lent among students

"Students can often prevent illness
by getting preventive immunizations
when indicated (i.e. flu vaccine), covering
their cough when they are ill to prevent
spread and getting adequate sleep and good
nutrition to keep up their immune systems,"
Tepper said.
Other techniques for combating infection
include disinfecting dorm rooms, disinfecting
clothing, washing hands thoroughly and fre
quently, washing foods such as fruits and veg
etables before consumption and staying dis
tant from people who are already ill. .Students
should also be wary of sharing food, drinks
and utensils.
If severe symptoms do arise, students are
advised to go to Vaden I lealth Center or con-

suit their own
personal chx'tor.
"The majority of
cases do not need
medical treatment
and [are] resolved on

their own," Tepper
noted. 'II students become
severely dehydrated or symptoms persist, they
will come to Vaden for treatment or go to the
emergency room when Vaden is closed."
When the Norovirus hit USC last semes
ter, 330 students became infected with the
virus in just five days, according to The Los
Angeles Times. So far, Stanford has avoided
an outbreak of that magnitude.
"We have not seen many cases at Vaden."
Tepper said. "With the help of our well
trained PHEs, we have been able to keep
most of these cases well-contained."
