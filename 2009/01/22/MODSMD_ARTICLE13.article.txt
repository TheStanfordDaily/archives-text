## Editorial New RIAA policy fairer but imperfect 
### 
The editorial hoard would like to com
mend the Recording Industry Associ
ation of America (RIAA) for its new
policies regarding file sharing, which shift
away from litigation and towards a more fair
warning system (See "Recording industry
alters piracy policy" in the Jan. 16 issue of
The Daily). The new RIAA policy, which
features Internet Service Provider (ISP)
partnerships, aims to provide warnings of il
legal conduct directly to users instead of
slapping them with pre-litigation settlement
fees or filing law suits.
The RIAA plans to provide cooperative
ISPs with the IP addresses of illegal file shar
ers. The ISPs will then alert their clients of il
legal activity and ask them to stop. If illegal
file sharing continues beyond two warnings,
the ISP will revoke Internet access from the
user. We appreciate this more forgiving sys
tem that targets habitual users rather than
infrequent violators or unsuspecting indi
viduals unaware of the possibility of incur
ring fines.
While the editorial board thoroughly ap
preciates the three-strike policy as an alter
native to immediate fines and litigation, we
fail to see how this policy could possibly be
beneficial for. or enticing to, ISPs. As the
RIAA policy currently stands, violators are
confronted directly and the ISP loses noth
ing. But by striking a deal with the RIAA
that involves revoking Internet access, the
ISPs are essentially agreeing to harm their
own business.
Though Stanford may understandably
wish to protect its students and therefore be
willing to serve as the go-between for stu
dents and the RlAA.such a policy does not
make sense for other ISPs, who stand to lose
nothing from direct RIAA action. Askinn

ISPs to serve as a middleman is at best inap
propriate.
Despite the fact that the editorial board
doesn't fully understand the use of general
ISPs as go-betweens, we are appreciative
that Stanford is willing to serve in this role
for the protection of its students. Because
Stanford does not lose paying Internet cus
tomers by revoking Internet access from
certain students, Stanford has less to lose
than a regular ISP. Stanford does, however,
have more to gain by protecting the well
being of its students and keeping them out of
legal trouble.
The editorial board suggests that the
University, which benefits from this new pol
icy significantly more than other ISPs, adopt
it and a partnership with the RIAA whole
heartedly. Despite the inappropriate nature
of serving as a go-between, the three-strike
policy is monumentally more fair than the
previous method of litigation, which more
often than not caught those not savvy
enough to game the system (See "RIAA de
mands fines from 15 students" in the Jan. 24.
2008 issue of The Daily). Stanford students
hopefully will be able to avoid financially
devastating settlements, especially in such a
down economy.
The editorial board would like to note,
however, that despite the new and improved
policies, we have little hope that illegal file
sharing on campus and across the country
will decrease significantly. Students will al
ways find ways to escape the Rl AA's watch
ful eye, and this new policy is unlikely to
eradicate file sharing if litigation did not.
Nevertheless, we are strongly in favor of the
new policies, and can only hope that students
become more cautious and responsible with
regards to their file sharing tendencies.
