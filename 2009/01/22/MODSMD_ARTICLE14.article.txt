## Anish Mitra Setting aside childish things 
### 
President Obama delivered an inaugu
ral address this week that eschewed
soaring rhetoric in favor of a clear
eved description of the troubles that await
the nation. The speech may not have had a
touchstone that will resonate in history
(Franklin Delano Roosevelt's "the only
thing we have to fear is fear itself" comes to
mind), but I was struck by the line "the time
has come to set aside childish things."
Our country has faced tremendous prob
lems over the last few years: wars on two
fronts, an economy that refuses to recover,
foreclosed houses on every block. Neverthe
less, no one in government has felt the need
to call upon the American people to sacri
fice. Rather than being exhorted to tighten
our belts, we were encouraged to be patriot
ic by shopping. Rather than chipping in to
help equip our troops, we were told that we
could have tax cuts while our fellow citizens
fought abroad. Rather than reining in an
out-of-control deficit, we were assured that
we could put it on our tab. We were told to
hope that our creditors would not come to
collect. As the adult world closed in around
us. we clung to our toys.
Yet it seems unfair to blame a cultural
predilection toward irresponsibility on one
administration. Indeed, our unwillingness to
accept the realities engendered by our ac
tions stretches far beyond negligence in our
government. We live in a society in which
most of us spend a tremendous amount of
energy to avoid growing up.
Consider college, particularly at a school
like Stanford. TO the extent that most of us
are engaged in work, we are working to im
prove our own futures. We may complain
about readings and problem sets, yet we
know that we will benefit from them in the
end. Many of us engage in community serv
ice. to be sure, but it seems honest to assert
that many consider such activities to be just
another line on a resume. While we are en
gaged in this largely self-serving work, we si
multaneously take great pains to carve out
as much time for recreation as possible:
rushing through problem sets to get to par
ties. or skipping section just to throw a I ris
bee with friends.To the extent that we find a
week to be bad or busy, with no time for Cafe
Night or Wine and Cheese, we are, more
often than not,just consumed with work that
will better our individual futures. While a bit
cliched.it remains true: A bad week at Camp
Stanford is an unimaginably fantastic week

in the history of humanity.
To say this, of course, is to nevertheless
recognize those individuals holding down
several jobs to pay their way through school;
those working long hours to support a fami
ly: those who are tremendously involved in
the community and who could care less
about how it might help them. But most of us
are not these individuals.

"We live in a society in
which most of us spend
a tremendous amount
of energy to avoid
growing up."

So what's to be clone? We don't have to
eut everything fun from our lives. It is time,
however, to take a good, hard look at the
lives we lead. Pundits often east our genera
tion as apathetic, asking why we are not
more like the youths of the '60s and '70s who
were involved in the nation and vocally
protested against the Vietnam War. In truth,
though, the students of the era were not all
that active until the cruel realities of adult
hood intruded on their lives in the form of
the draft and social injustice. These students
took on the responsibility of adulthood only
when the possibility of childhood was re
moved. While it is the prerogative of youth
to avoid adulthood, we cannot afford to
allow the challenges of the adult world to
come to us before we act.
President Obama took a brave stand in
choosing to speak the realities of our current
situation, calling for collective responsibility
instead of coddling our childish national psy
che. The time has come for us to follow his
lead.
