## The 						first black president: A victory for Republicans and Democrats alike 
### 
Tuesday was not President Bush's day. It
marked the end of a rocky and heavily
criticized presidency and the begin
ning of a new administration intent on strik
ing down Bush policies concerning Iraq, stem
cell research. Guantanamo. healthcare, ener
gy and much more. But on this remarkable
occasion, most noteworthy because of the
election of America's first African-American
president, much can be said of what George
Bush and the Republican Party did to lay the
foundation for Barack Obama's success.
The Democrats deserve particular praise
in delivering America's first African-Ameri
can president just a few decades after sys
temic discrimination against African-Ameri
cans characterized large parts of the US. But
Wednesday also marked a day of triumph for
the Republican Party, a day signifying the in
fluence Republicans have had in advancing
the position and possibilities of African-
Americans.
The Republican Party is most often seen
as the more restrained of the two major par
ties when it comes to extending a hand to
African-Americans. The Grand Old Party
has not been at the forefront of attempts to
rectify African-American social and eco
nomic disadvantages since Abraham Lin
coln's famous proclamation in 1K65 and the
Reconstruction that followed. Indeed, while
Democrats have shewn eagerness to extend
an open hand and heart to African-American
communities over the past 50 years. Republi
cans have shown little interest in even ap
pearing to care about the needs and cares of
this marginalized community. One might re

call George Bush's speech to the NA ACF in
July of 2006. declaring it a "tragedy" that
Abraham Lincoln's party let go of its historic
ties with the African-American community.
But the story of Barack Obama's success
ful candidacy is not a story of success in spite
of the antecedent Republican rule, but rather
of success as the next step in a tide begun by
the Bush administration. Through admitted
ly through more subtle and less democratic
avenues, with the selection of Collin Powell,
and then Condoleezza Rice, as Secretary of
State, covering the entire span of his eight
years in office, George Bush advanced the
position, respect and credibility of African-
Americans in this country. Before the ap
pointments of Powell and Rice. Americans
had not seen African-Americans in such high
positions, and the leadership of both Powell
and Rice helped acclimate a hesitant Ameri
can electorate to a changing political estab
lishment. one that became open to a much
wider and more diverse set of aspirants to our
highest offices.
Collin Powell and Condoleezza Rice have
made headlines around the world over the
past eight years and have acted as the Presi
dent's chief emissaries, representing the
United States abroad. In this sense, they be
came the face of the nation. When Barack
Obama first announced his candidacy, many
said that America was not ready to elect a
black president and that he could not garner
the votes necessary to defeat first the Demo
cratic favorite. I lillary Clinton,and later John
McCain in a nationwide election.
But these "cynics" — as Obama would

call them — underestimated the American
populace's readiness to elect a president of
the most marginalized race in U.S. history.
This phenomenon surprised Democrats and
Republicans alike, while dispelling the
doubts of not only Americans, but of people
all across the globe. How could an election
that even Americans thought impossible be
so suddenly realized?
The answer to this question is certainly
not limited to the precedent set by having
Colin Powell and then Condoleezza Rice
serve as Secretary of State these past eight
years. There were a myriad of factors that
helped bring about this accomplishment —
not least of which was Obama's long and
hard-fought campaign, illustrating his char
acter. judgment and ability to trigger the
imaginations of millions of Americans and
instill in them tremendous confidence in his
leadership.
But some level of comfort with the idea of
an African-American assuming the highest
office was no less crucial to Obama's success.
This comfort was delivered in large part by
the precedent of two consecutive African-
American Secretaries of State, a precedent
set not only by their appointments but also
the confidence President Hush placed in
them. At a time in which we celebrate the
tremendous step taken by the U.S. in assuring
all its citizens that this society does not bar
any race from ascending to its highest office,
it is fitting to note that this is a victory both
sides of the aisle can take pride in.
