# Praise for Obama's recognition of non-believers
## 
### 
On Jan. 20.1 watched the inauguration
of Barack Obama.the 44th President
of the United States. As an Ameri
can. I was amazed by the peaceful transfer
of power. As a supporter of Barack Obama.
I was pleased to see the person I thought
most ready to lead our country step into t hat
role.
But I want to address how I felt as an
atheist.
"For we know that our patchwork her
itage is a strength, not a weakness." Obama
said."We are a nation of Christians and Mus
lims, Jews and Hindus â€” and non-believers."

These words, midway through ihe inaugu
ral address.marked the first time in my mem
ory when a president of the United States has
acknowledged the presence of non-believers
in our country. It's not uncommon to hear our
public officials speak to the nation in non-de
nominational religious language, eschewing
ideas specific to their faith in order to appeal
to people of all faiths. Rarely, if ever, are
those without faith recognized. We're expect
ed to sit quietly through prayer and sermon,
not make a fuss, while believers act as though
perhaps, someday, we'll see that faith is the
wav to truth.

The presence of atheists, agnostics and
other non-believers is not a great American
tragedy. We will not disappear if you ignore
us. We are not un-American.
But I'm not telling you anything you don't
already know. Everyone likes to he recog
nized. F.vervone likes to he included. I'm glad
we now have a president who understands
that.
