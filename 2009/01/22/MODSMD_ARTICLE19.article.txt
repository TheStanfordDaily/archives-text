## DEVILS, 'CATS LURK IN 'ZONA 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After a resounding, expected win against Uni
versity of the Pacific two weekends ago, the No. 3
Stanford Men's swim team is back in heavy train
ing to prepare for their next dual meet against Ari
zona State and Arizona this weekend in the Cop
per State.
The season is in full swing and these next few

weeks of training will help show where the Cardi
nal will ultimately fall in March's NCAA Champi
onships. Last year, the Cardinal finished 3rd be
hind winner Arizona and runner up Texas with a
predominantly sophomore and freshmen team.
This year, the team is expected to challenge for the
title against perennial contenders No. 1 Texas, No.
2 Michigan. Arizona, Auburn. Cal and Tennessee.
As for the conference. Stanford has won 27 con
secutive Pacific-10 Conference championships.

and aims for yet another under head coach Skip
Kenney.
Arizona State is a feel good story in the aquat
ic world. During the summer, it was announced
that the school's men's swimming program would
be cancelled as part of budget cuts for the school.
After several months of intense fundraising. up
roar in the swimming community and a strong
coalition of support including many Stanford affil
iates, the program was reinstated for this season.

'ITie Sun Devils have produced swimming greats
like Nick Brunelli and many other All Americans
so the loss of Arizona State would have had a mas
sive impact on the swimming community.
The Sun Devils are relatively young this year,
returning no swimmers from the NC'AA champi
onships. CJ Nuess. a multiple Ail-American who
won the Pac-1() last year in the 1,650 freestyle,
graduated last year and the only returning part of
their squad who went on to the NCAA champi
onships is diver Mickey Benedetti. While the Car
dinal should have no problem winning the overall
meet, the Sun Devils, like Pacific before them,
should provide a test of where the team is in its
training, and how much work it has left to do be
fore it can rest and taper for the Pac-1() champi
onships.
Arizona, however, poses a serious challenge
for the Cardinal — the Wildcats are serious con
tenders every year for the NCAA crown, which
they won last year under head coach Frank Busch.
"We're looking for some fast swimming." Stan
ford senior captain Paul Komfeld said. "Arizona
came into Stanford last year and beat us in our
pool and we want to go into their pool and do the

Stanford will look to make a number of NCAA cuts on the road this weekend against Arizona and Arizona State. "A" cuts guarantee a slot in the
NCAAs, while "B" cuts mean that a swimmer will be on the outside looking in, and will take any spots that are available at the end of the season.
same.
"There will he fast times on Satur
day against good competition," Korn
feld added. "They're a good team, it
should be a good battle."
Arizona returns Jean Basson. a
South African finalist in the 200 free at
the Olympic games and a strong fa
vorite for the national title in the 2(H)
and 500 free this year.
"Arizona has a few Olympians who
have just returned after taking off the
fall, so they [Arizona] will be stronger
than they looked previously," senior
captain Jason Dunford said. " Hiere
will be good matchups across the
board."
For the Wildcats, Nicholas Nilo.
Jack Brown. Bryan O'Connor and
Jake Tapp are all returning upper class
men with serious experience in all
events, giving them depth in many of
the sprint-to-middle distance events.
Freshman AJ Tipton has been a sur
prise for Arizona, and owns the third
fastest 200 fly time in the nation this
year.
The Stanford swimmers will be ex
pected to swim good times, but will
also try to get their NCAA cuts. At
Texas A&M in November, many of
the Cardinal swimmers were suited
with high tech suits for the meet and
swam remarkably fast times. I lowev
er. a costly mistake by Texas A&M's
time measuring unit invalidated all the
results on the first day, and severely cut
into the NCAA cuts consideration. So.
Stanford will enter this weekend con
tinuing to aim for the "A" cuts, which
guarantee a spot in the NCAA cham
pionships. and "B" cuts, which will fill
all the remaining spots that "A" cuts
have not filled. Due to suit technology
and swimmers generally getting faster
over recent years, the "A" cuts have
been significantly lowered, with many
anticipating only a handful of "A" cuts
in each event.
Stanford will face off against Ari
zona State on Saturday and then will
travel to Arizona on Sunday.
"Arizona is the defending champs;
there will be good competition." Korn
feld said. "If you look at ours guys and
you look at theirs... there will be lots
of fast races."
