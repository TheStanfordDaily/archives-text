### CHRISTIAN L. TOM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After a resounding, expected win against Uni
versity of the Pacific two weekends ago, the No. 3
Stanford Men's swim team is back in heavy train
ing to prepare for their next dual meet against Ari
zona State and Arizona this weekend in the Cop
per State.
The season is in full swing and these next few

weeks of training will help show where the Cardi
nal will ultimately fall in March's NCAA Champi
onships. Last year, the Cardinal finished 3rd be
hind winner Arizona and runner up Texas with a
predominantly sophomore and freshmen team.
This year, the team is expected to challenge for the
title against perennial contenders No. 1 Texas, No.
2 Michigan. Arizona, Auburn. Cal and Tennessee.
As for the conference. Stanford has won 27 con

Arizona State is a feel good story in the aquat

won the Pac-1() last year in the 1,650 freestyle,
graduated last year and the only returning part of
their squad who went on to the NCAA champi
onships is diver Mickey Benedetti. While the Car
dinal should have no problem winning the overall
meet, the Sun Devils, like Pacific before them,
should provide a test of where the team is in its
training, and how much work it has left to do be
fore it can rest and taper for the Pac-1() champi
onships.
Arizona, however, poses a serious challenge
for the Cardinal â€” the Wildcats are serious con
tenders every year for the NCAA crown, which
they won last year under head coach Frank Busch.
