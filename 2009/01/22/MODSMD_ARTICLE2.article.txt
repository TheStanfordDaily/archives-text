# Students against athletic cuts
## 
### 
News came out Tuesday, via
the Associated Press, that
due to budget concerns
caused by the sliding econ
omy, the Stanford athletic department
will see a $5 million decrease in rev
enue over the next three years, pre
sumably because of the present eco
nomic situation. As a result, the de
partment will be looking to cut staff,
find ways to limit travel expenses and
possibly consider cutting some athlet
ic programs.
All I can say is this: Don't do it!
I understand that thiseconomicsit
uation is difficult for everyone, and 1
don't profess to be an economics whiz,
but there must be a way to avoid elim
inating any of our teams. The primary
focus of the athletic departments
needs to be to find additional revenue
streams and cut the budget without
cutting programs.
A hugely important part of Stan
ford is its athletics and cutting a pro
gram is no different than cutting a
major from the academic curriculum.
It needs to be an absolutely last resort,
and any and all efforts must be made
to avoid it.
Yes. I know 1 am a sports w l iter and
all-around fanatic when it comes to
competitive athletics and I can't speak
without bias, but this should matter to
everyone. Sports are part of what
Stanford is and what makes this a
great place.
There is no better school in the
world for pre-professional athletics
and only a handful of institutions that
can compare academically to Lejand
Stanford Junior University.The Cardi
nal earns the Director's Cup year after
year while Stanford is consistently rec
ognized as one of the best places to get
an education.
lliis mix of athletic and academic
excellence is the cornerstone of what
Stanford is. F.lite athletes come be
cause they want to get the best educa
tion possible while competing in their
sport at the highest level. Here they
have the best of both worlds. Students
who haven't been an athletic champi
on since I-ball but love sports come
here because thev want to have access
