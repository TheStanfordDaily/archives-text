# Students against athletic cuts
## 
### 
News came out Tuesday, via
the Associated Press, that
due to budget concerns
caused by the sliding econ
omy, the Stanford athletic department
will see a $5 million decrease in rev
enue over the next three years, pre
sumably because of the present eco
nomic situation. As a result, the de
partment will be looking to cut staff,
find ways to limit travel expenses and
possibly consider cutting some athlet
ic programs.
All I can say is this: Don't do it!
I understand that thiseconomicsit
uation is difficult for everyone, and 1
don't profess to be an economics whiz,
but there must be a way to avoid elim
inating any of our teams. The primary
focus of the athletic departments
needs to be to find additional revenue
streams and cut the budget without
cutting programs.
A hugely important part of Stan
ford is its athletics and cutting a pro
gram is no different than cutting a
major from the academic curriculum.
It needs to be an absolutely last resort,
and any and all efforts must be made
to avoid it.
Yes. I know 1 am a sports w l iter and
all-around fanatic when it comes to
competitive athletics and I can't speak
without bias, but this should matter to
everyone. Sports are part of what
Stanford is and what makes this a
great place.
There is no better school in the
world for pre-professional athletics
and only a handful of institutions that
can compare academically to Lejand
Stanford Junior University.The Cardi
nal earns the Director's Cup year after
year while Stanford is consistently rec
ognized as one of the best places to get
an education.
lliis mix of athletic and academic
excellence is the cornerstone of what
Stanford is. F.lite athletes come be
cause they want to get the best educa
tion possible while competing in their
sport at the highest level. Here they
have the best of both worlds. Students
who haven't been an athletic champi
on since I-ball but love sports come
here because thev want to have access

to world-class athletics and a great
education al the same time. This mix
gives us the diversity in experience
and excellence that makes this uni
versity such a great and unique place.
Yes money needs to be saved, hut
not in a way that makes Stanford ...
well, not Stanford anymore.
If the belief is that this isa situation
tied to the economy that will be alle
viated when market conditions im
prove. consider tapping into the en
dowment to plug the hole for the next
few years while ways to increase rev
enue are explored, if the situation im
proves in two. three or four years just
stop that cash How and go back to
business as usual. There wouldn't
even be a dent in the endowment.
Try asking alumni for donations.
I'm sure there are plenty of them, es
pecially former Stanford athletes
who have "made it" professionally
of which there are more than a few -
who could together make up $5 mil
lion in three years without breaking a
sweat.
Or what about the old fallback for
whenever anything that involves
money needs to happen? You know,
that Arrillaga guy? Maybe we could
even get him to donate money each
year to attach his name to some of the
teams themselves. Everything on
campus is already named after him
anyway, and who doesn't like the
sound of the "Stanford University
Frances C. Arrillaga Synchronized
Swimming Team."
Seriously though, cutting athletic
programs just isn't an option. Ihis
university has the money to survive a
financial rough patch without tossing
the things that make it special. Stan
ford's athletic teams need to be pro
tected. and shouldn't be on the table
when budget cuts come along.
Write your ASSU senators and
ask them to start a dialogue with the
athletic department, because they
need to know how we feel about the
Cardinal. If you have ideas for how
the athletic department can better
market itself and increase revenue,let
them know.
Stanford is full of great athletes,
great minds and great people. I know
that we, as a community,can and will
find a way to save our programs. We
just have totrv.

hrik Adams must be feeling political,
but who doesn't like the thought of
flooding the ASSU with pleas to save
our sports teams? We know they'd
enjoy it. Contact Erik at
