# Hurling
## Cardinal and Cal make history 
### ZOE LEAVITT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It's been called the fastest game
on grass, aerial field hockey, the
grandfather of ice hockey and
lacrosse. It predates Christianity by
over 12(H) years and provided mili
tary victory for ancient Irish kings.
And now, it is the latest step in the
Stanford-Cal rivalry and a first for
college sports in North America.
This ancient Irish game is hurl
ing, and the first collegiate match
on the North American continent
is set to take place between Stan
ford and Cal this Saturday.
Hurling originated in Ireland
before recorded history and trav
eled to America with Irish immi
grants in the 18(X)'s. Players use a
hurley, or wooden, axe-shaped
stick, to hit a small ball called a slio
tar either past a goalkeeper into a
net for three points, or over a cross
bar above the goal for one point.
Besides hitting the ball either
through the air or on the ground,
players can also catch the ball and
run with it for three steps, or run
balancing the ball on the hurley.
Hurling remains widely popu
lar in Ireland, but in America it tra
ditionally stayed within the demo
graphic of Irish immigrants. As im
migration slowed and children lost
the traditions of their parents,
teams have dissolved and leagues
have broken up. But now. a small
group at Stanford hopes to revital
ize the sport in the Bay Area and
beyond.
The Stanford hurling team,
which gained official club status in
the spring of 2(X)8. had been the
brainchild of John Mulrow '08 for
three years beforehand. From an
Irish family, Mulrow had seen the
game as a child but never played
before,
"In spring of 2(X)(i I taught a stu
dent initiated course on Irish-
American culture," Mulrow said,
"and we took a field trip to San
Francisco and I met the GAA
[Gaelic Athletic Association] rep
resentative, and he asked if I want
ed to start a hurling team and I said
'Hell yeah!'"
The team, however, had hum
ble origins. "We started playing on
the Sigma Nu lawn,"said Mulrow,"
and our goal would be to try to hit
the ball onto the Muwekma lawn,
all the way at the other end of the
row."
When Mulrow went abroad,
campus interest all but evaporated.
But last year, inspired by a Stan
ford Daily article describing Mul
row s efforts, two Loro freshmen
brought it back. Current sopho

more and Daily editor Sam Svobo
da contacted Murlow and asked
him about starting a team.
"My friend Sam approached
me and I took one look at the stick
he was holding and I knew I had to
try it," sophomore Ben Arevalo
said. Arevalo now serves as the
team's financial officer.
The team gained their first play
er with more experience in Eoin
Buckley, a faculty member at Stan
ford.

"We will turn
some heads."

"I saw some guys playing hurl
ing out on Wilbur field [while driv
ing home one day last summer]
and knew I wanted to play again."
he said.'i played as a kid till I was
sixteen, so I gave them a bit of
coaching but they seemed to know
what they were doing."
With a core group of six players,
the team gained Stanford club sta
tus last spring. Now a group of
fourteen players has gained legiti
macy, and official equipment, from
the NAGAA (North American
Gaelic Athletic Association).
Despite only two members of
the team having played the game
before, they feel ready to compete
this Saturday.
"I think the philosophy has
been really good in that Eamonn
[the NAGAA representative] has
said to just play.and we'll figure out
the rules as we play,"' Mulrow said.
"Cal is learning too."
"It's basically a hodgepodge of
many other sports that are popular
in America," Mulrow added. "So
the learning curve is really fast,sur
prisingly."
"I think we will turn some heads
in our match against Cal," said
Arevalo.
The team continues to recruit
more players and hopes the match
against Cal will bring them publici
ty throughout campus. Simply
playing in the public space of
Wilbur field is one of their strate
gies to spread the hurling passion.

Pervez Musharraf, when he visited
Stanford campus last week," driv
