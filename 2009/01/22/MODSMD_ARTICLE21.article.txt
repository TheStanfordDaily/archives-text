## Offensive line coach Chris Dalman steps down 
### 
Even though they won't play their
next game for another eight months,
Stanford football suffered a tremen
dous loss on Wednesday. Offensive
line coach and running game coordi
nator Chris Dalman resigned from
the team, leaving the Farm after two
years as one of Jim 112 farbaugh's top as
sistants.
The highly-regarded Dalman tu
tored a Cardinal offensive line that
led the way for one of the Pac-10 most
potent rushing attacks this year, as
Stanford averaged 199.6 yards per
game on the ground — the Cardinal
compiled the second-best rushing
total in school history in Dalman's
zone blocking scheme.
Harbaugh explained the motives
behind Dalman's resignation in a
statement issued yesterday.
"Chris Dalman has made the deci
sion to leave the Stanford University
football program in order to spend
more time with his family." I larbaugh
said. "Coach Dalman has contributed
greatly to the foundation of champi
onship football at Stanford Universi
ty. Chris will be missed, and we wish
him well in his future endeavors."
Dalman is a Salinas native and
Stanford alumnus who played on the
line for the Cardinal from 1989-1992.
After graduation, he joined the pro
fessional ranks — he played with San
Francisco from 1993-1999. and won a
Super Bowl as a part of the 49ers'
1994 championship team. Before
coming back to Stanford, Dalman
coached the offensive line for the At
lanta Falcons for two years, during
which time Warrick Dunn and
Michael Vick combined for three
1 .(MK)-yard seasons.
"We appreciate Chris's contribu
tion to Stanford University, previous
ly as an outstanding student-athlete
and the past two years as a coach,
leader and Iriend." 1 larbaugh said.
The search is now on for Dalman's
replacement, who theoretically
should be in place in time for the be
ginning of spring practices in late Feb
ruary.
