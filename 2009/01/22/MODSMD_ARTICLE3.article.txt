After an enormous win over Pacific
-10 Conference leader California on Sat
urday. the Stanford men's basketball
team returns to Maples Pavilion for the
start of another weekend home stand.
'[Tie Cardinal will first face Oregon at
7:30 p.m. today.
'ITie Ducks (6-12) arrive looking for
an upset. After finishing the 2007-08 sea
son tied for third in the Pac-10 with an
11 -7 conference record. Oregon has sud
denly found itself in a hole deeper than
any other team in the conference: an un
likely 0-6 start to league play. Stanford,at
12-3 overall, looks only moderately bet
ter off. At 2-3 in conference play, Car
dinal clings to the hope of a win to help
propel it back into the thick of the Pac-10
race.
Hie Ducks are looking to do the
same, making them dangerous oppo
nents. according to senior forward
Lawrence Hill.
" ITiey're not coming in thinking,
"We're 0-6,'" 1 lill said. "They're going to
come in to get the one down [on their
record]."
Leading the charge for the Ducks will
be their top-scorer, junior Tajuan Porter,
who averages 13.2 points per game and

NOTES; Oregon ranks last in rebounding in the
Pac-10, and shoots only 40.8 percent as a team
from the field. Lawrence Hill was named confer
ence player of the week for his performance
against Cal on Saturday. Stanford has won eight
of its last 10 meetings with the Ducks, and is 85-
43 all-time in the series.

shoots better than 90 percent from
the line. Coach Johnny Dawkins
knows not to sell short the quality of
Oregon coach Ernie Kent's squad.
"Oregon is well-coached,"
Dawkins said. "They have a good
team, and I think they're young.
Tajuan Porter is a good little guard:
he's quick, he's fast and he's a capable
scorer. I'm sure they'll be prepared.
[They've gotten] off to a tough start.

and started battling. But, I know their
coaches; I know they're going to
compete."
The youth of the Oregon team has
had a number of negative ramifica
tions over the course of the season.
For one, the Ducks have struggled to
contain opponents, giving up an av
erage of 76.9 points per game. How
ever, little is made up that for on of
fense: Oregon shoots only 40.8 per
cent from the field. Only two players
average in double digits for scoring:
Porter and redshirt sophomore LeK
endric Longmire (10.6).
In the post, both freshman center
Michael Dunigan and junior center
Joevan Catron offer little relief to
the lackluster offense: neither aver
ages even 10 points per game, al
though Dunigan barely plays more
than a half per contest.The big men's
rebounding ability also leaves much
to be desired, as they've contributed
directly to Oregon's last place con
ference standing in rebounding.
In fact, the only category in which
Oregon or one of its individual play
ers ranks first in the Pac-10 is in
steals, where the team averages 8.7
per game.
While Stanford by no means

takes the meeting lightly, the focus
has turned inward onto the Cardi
nal's own game.
Junior Landry Fields, for one, rec
ognizes the importance of this game
in Stanford's season.
"These games are big for us, too, if
we want to stay in the Pac-10 race,"
be said.
Hill agreed, noting that the Cardi
nal's three losses have already jeop
ardized the postseason for Stanford.
"We have no room for error right
now," Hill said. "We've already used
that three times."
Hill will be an integral part of the
Cardinal's plan for success. Deemed
Pac-10 Player of the Week for his
performance against Cal, Hill is not
only Stanford's second leading scor
er (14.7 points per game), he also em
bodies the leadership and experi
ence that Oregon lacks.
"Lawrence is playing well,"
Dawkins said. "He's playing with a
lot of confidence; he's playing with a
lot of poise â€” a lot of poise. I was re
ally pleased in watching him, not just
in the Cal game, but [also] in the
games prior to that. He's been play
ing like a senior leader."
However, Hill will by no means

be alone in taking on the un-mighty
Ducks. The now-duo in the post of
sophomore Josh Owens and redshirt
sophomore Will Paul should hardly
falter against Dunigan and Catron,
despite their own youth. Senior
guards Mitch Johnson and Anthony
Goods will aim to keep Porter at
bay.
Dawkins attributed much of
Stanford's victory against Cal to
Johnson's multifaceted play.
"I thought, in our game, Mitch
was terrific," Dawkins said. "I
thought he controlled the game, he
ran our team. Our execution was the
way it was because he was at the
helm ... I think he's been playing
well all season long. He's improved
in a number of areas and I'd just like
to recognize that."
Despite the toughness of Pac-10
play. Dawkins' confidence in his expe
rienced players leaves little doubt
about his expectations for Thursday
night. With less than a week since a
win over Cal, there are few people
who don't share these same expecta
tions.
