# WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
## ROAD REBOUND Stanford looks to get back on track in Beaver State 
### ERIK ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
After a tough loss against its archrival last Sun
day, the Stanford women's basketball team is in the
Pacific Northwest this weekend for conference
games against Oregon tonight, and Oregon State
on Saturday.
The Cardinal (13-4.4-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
is planning to regroup after its five-game winning
streak was snapped at Cal. With that loss, Stanford
fell to No. 11 in both national polls and slid into sec
ond place in the conference behind the Golden
Bears.
Now. each game within the conference becomes
even more important ii Stanford wants to capture
its ninth straight Pac-10 title, but the Cardinal is as
confident as ever.
"Our backs are against the wall." head coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "If we want to have a shot at
winning the regular season Pac-10 title, we need to
play well up in Oregon. And I know that we will."
After scoring just 54 points in Berkeley — fol

lowing record-breaking offensive performances
two weeks ago against the Washington schools —
perhaps the largest area of focus for Stanford this
weekend is establishing an offensive presence
early and maintaining its pace throughout the
game.
"We want to play a more up-tempo [game]."
VanDerveer said. "That is one of the biggest things
that I felt like we didn't do last week. We did not
push the ball in transition and we had no tempo.
That is something we are working hard on."
It may he especially important to develop that
tempo early against the two Oregon schools, both
of which have proven to be dangerous.
Hie Oregon Ducks have struggled at
times this season and failed to win a single game in
the month of December. But since conference play
began this month, the Ducks are 4-2. including a
dominating 17-point road victory over UCLA.
Ihey are led by guards Micaela Cooks' and Taylor
Lilley's 14.8 and 12.0 points per game, respectively.

NOTES: The Cardinal is coming off a 57-
54 loss on the road to Cal that dropped
Stanford from the top of the Pbc-10
standings. Guards Micoela Cooks and
Taylor Lilley lead the Ducks in scoring,
with a combined 26.8 points per game.
Beavers' center Alex Mitchell currently
owns a 57 percent shooting percentage.
But, as redshirt junior Alexis Gray-Lawson demonstrat
ed last weekend, focusing too closely on the opponent's
star players can backfire.
TTie Beavers (11-5,2-4) have had essentially the oppo
site season from the Ducks. After winning nine of their
first 10, OSU is just 2-4 in the conference and has only
scored more than 54 points twice in that span — in each
of the two victories. But the Beavers have several danger
ous players,including guardsTalisa Rhea (14.9 points per
game) and Brittney Davis (12.1 points per game). Center
Alex Mitchell is shooting over 57 percent and could cause
problems for Stanford junior center Jayne Appel in the
paint.
But. as is always the case with Stanford, the focus isn't
on the opponent's abilities, hut what the Cardinal itself
can do to play the best game possible.
"We need to establish an identity of how we are going

to play." VanDerveer said. "Right now ... we don't run.
hut we run sometimes. We shoot really well, and then we
brick other times. We need to find things we can do every
game: we've got to push the ball every game, we need to
rebound every game and we need to play great defense
without fouling."
Ibis Stanford team has great talent — it it can devel
op this consistency,and can play at its highest level for all
40 minutes of every game, it will be very difficult to beat.
Hut that has always been the goal for the Cardinal: to
be playing the best basketball possible when March ar
rives. Getting back in the win column in the Beaver State
is the next step.
Both games are scheduled to start at 7 p.m. and can be
heard live on KZSU MO. I FM.

Lindy La Rocque will try to help right the Cardinal's ship after last weekend's loss in the final moments to Cal. The women
will do so on the road versus the Oregon schools, both of whom are tough, yet beatable opponents.
