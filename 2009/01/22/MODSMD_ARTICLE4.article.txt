## ROAD REBOUND Stanford looks to get back on track in Beaver State 
### ERIK ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
After a tough loss against its archrival last Sun
day, the Stanford women's basketball team is in the
Pacific Northwest this weekend for conference
games against Oregon tonight, and Oregon State
on Saturday.
The Cardinal (13-4.4-1 Pacific-10 Conference)
is planning to regroup after its five-game winning
streak was snapped at Cal. With that loss, Stanford
fell to No. 11 in both national polls and slid into sec
ond place in the conference behind the Golden
Bears.
Now. each game within the conference becomes
even more important ii Stanford wants to capture
its ninth straight Pac-10 title, but the Cardinal is as
confident as ever.
"Our backs are against the wall." head coach
Tara VanDerveer said. "If we want to have a shot at
winning the regular season Pac-10 title, we need to
play well up in Oregon. And I know that we will."
After scoring just 54 points in Berkeley — fol

lowing record-breaking offensive performances
two weeks ago against the Washington schools —
perhaps the largest area of focus for Stanford this
weekend is establishing an offensive presence
early and maintaining its pace throughout the
game.
"We want to play a more up-tempo [game]."
VanDerveer said. "That is one of the biggest things
that I felt like we didn't do last week. We did not
push the ball in transition and we had no tempo.
That is something we are working hard on."
It may he especially important to develop that
tempo early against the two Oregon schools, both
of which have proven to be dangerous.
Hie Oregon Ducks have struggled at
times this season and failed to win a single game in
the month of December. But since conference play
began this month, the Ducks are 4-2. including a
dominating 17-point road victory over UCLA.
Ihey are led by guards Micaela Cooks' and Taylor
Lilley's 14.8 and 12.0 points per game, respectively.
