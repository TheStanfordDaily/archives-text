GAME NOTES; Stanford is currently undefeated on the
season, despite only having four seniors on its squad.
Although Arizona State comes first, the main contest
this weekend will be against Arizona, the reigning
NCAA Champions. The weekend begins a string of
five straight dual meets for the Cardinal.

ating a winning environment.
"We do have four captains." Duckworth
said."l lowever. Ido have to say that every
one steps up as a leader in their own way
either through cheering on the sidelines or
through example by working hard and
swimming fast at practice."
Stanford, although deep into the
season, has barely touched the wa
ters of Pacific-10 dual meets. The
team won its two conference
matchups in October, beating Ore
gon State and Washington in con
vincing fashion. The Cardinal has
also been impressive in non-confer
ence meetings, beating perennial
powerhouses Florida and Michigan
earlier in the season.
Led by two Beijing medal win
ners, juniors Julia Smit and Elaine
Breeden. Stanford has accumulat
ed momentum heading into this
weekend's meets, which kick off a
string of five straight Pac-10 dual
meets.
Arizona State, a team that has
been relatively disappointing this
year, continues to lurk just outside
of the top 25.The meet with the Sun
Devils is expected to be a warm up
of sorts for th£ Cardinal, which
looks to avoid exhaustion in prepa
ration for the highly anticipated
meet with Arizona.

Duckworth says the team will
still swim hard against the Sun Dev
ils, but continues to look ahead to
the matchup with Arizona.
"[Arizona State] does have good
swimmers," she said. "We will still
swim our best events to practice
racing with them. We have to take it
one day at a time."
With that being said, many of the
top swimmers may have a smaller
load, or may remain sidelined for
the meet altogether. Back-to-back
meets come with the potential for
fatigue, a risk that Stanford cannot
afford to take.
The young members of the Stan
ford team may understand the im
portance of taking their season day
by day, but they are undoubtedly
excited for what could be the most
difficult matchup of the year, against
Arizona.
Freshman Betsy Webb, who
swims backstroke and freestyle for
the Cardinal, was smiling at the
thought of competing against the de
fending national champions.
"I think it's going to be a fun
meet." Webb said. "It will be very
competitive. When you are compet
ing against a team like Arizona, it
makes everyone swim their best."
With the Pac-10 Championships

in Seattle only about a month away
and the NCAA Championships
close behind, Stanford hopes to con
tinue to improve and stay focused
heading down the stretch.
Duckworth and Webb, along with
their fellow freshmen swimmers, rec
ognize that they are in a very unique
place — swimming for a team with
the potential to win a national cham
pionship in their first collegiate sea
son.
"It's really exciting," Duckworth
said. "I'm really excited to see how
we can swim at the end of the season.
Being so young and seeing the ex
citement from the swimmers on one
of the best Stanford teams in years is
great."
"I think its fun just to be able to
be on the team with a lot of girls that
are going to push you to make you
your best." added Webb.
Both Duckworth and Webb agree
that the most important thing to re
member heading into the final
stretch is to "remain mentally
tough."
The Stanford women's swim
team takes on Arizona State on Fri
day. and Arizona on Saturday.
