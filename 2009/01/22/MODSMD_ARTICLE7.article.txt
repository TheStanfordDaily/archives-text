### JOANNA XU DESK EDITOR 
The global economic recession
has taken a significant toll not only
on Stanford's endowment but also on
funds of the Stanford Graduate
School of Business (GSB). On Jan.
13, the GSB announced a compre
hensive plan to reduce spending
across the board, a plan which
includes laying off approximately 12
percent of the GSB staff.
According to a published press
release by Barbara Buell, director of
communications at the GSB. declin
ing revenue sources have created a
$15 million, or 10 percent, shortfall in

the current year budget.
Senior Associate Dean for
Operations Dan Rudolph empha
sized that as the full impact of the
decline in asset values is recorded
over the coming months, the endow
ment is likely to shrink.
"We're essentially looking at an
endowment revenue decline for three
years," he said in the press release.
Part of the plan to reduce expens
es involves laying off 49 staff mem
bers. or approximately 12 percent of
the GSB staff. In addition, eight
employees were put on a reduced
schedule, and 12 further contractor
or fixed-term positions were elimi
nated. Travel, food, library services.

marketing activities and printing
expenses were also cut off.
"This was the most painful deci
sion 1 have had to make in my nearly
10 years as dean." said Dean of the
GSB Robert Joss in the press release.
Joss told Hie Daily that layoffs
were the absolute last option, and
that "faculty and many staff man
agers, including student services
managers" were consulted on how
best to handle the budget reductions.
The GSB students and faculty
have been "supportive and under
standing, given the environment,"
Joss added in his email to The Daily.
The University previously
announced that all employees who

will be laid off between now and June
30 will receive an enhanced sever
ance package, which will be calculat
ed based on length of service and
include five months of outplacement
job search support.
This policy also applies to the staff
members who will be laid off.
Joss said that at the moment, there
are no plans for further budget
reductions.
"While there are no absolute
guarantees, this was intended as a
one-time layoff." the dean said. "We
may take further expense, as
opposed to staff, reductions next
year."

According to the press release

academic priorities including student
programs, the new MBA curriculum,
financial aid. the Sloan Master's
Program, faculty research and the
PhD program will he protected as
part of the strategic budget process.
"Academic programs were a pri
ority for preservation," Joss said.
"Resources for career services |will
also be] maintained."
Overall, the Stanford endowment
is expected to be down by 20 to 30
percent by Sept. L.said Provost John
Etchemendy in an interview with the
Stanford News Service.
