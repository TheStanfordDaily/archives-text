## GSC reviews events, funding Council discusses socials; funding, equipment requests 
### MIKE DING DESK EDITOR 
The GSC reported last night at its weekly
meeting that programming for the graduate
student formal is going well despite challenges
with the reservation system.
In a half-hour meeting, earth sciences grad
uate student Justin Brown said that students
trying to reserve equipment and rooms have
found it difficult to get the equipment or room
they want.
"The requests for room and equipment
reservations often fail to get to the people in
charge" he said."and the housing office in the
GCC now only deals with lockouts and emer
gencies through an outside-contracted compa
ny. so it cannot be a backup for room or equip
ment distribution."
Brown said the GSC Web site has now been
updated to keep grad students updated on
equipment rental contacts.
Several student groups also approached the
GSC for additional funding.
The Black Student Association (BSA)
requested $4,340 for monthly meetings to
check in with members of the Stanford com
munity. periodic meetings between current
PhDs and speakers who have gone through the
PhD experience and a closing barbeque for
family and friends of the organization. The
GSC approved $3,840 to the BSA.
The Stanford Medical Students Association
received $2,431 in funding from the GSC for a
reception with students and faculty on Jan. 27
aimed at fostering mentor-student relation
ships between faculty and students.
The Stanford India Association will host an
evening of dinner and a movie and will receive
$1,950 in total funding for the event.
The Stanford Journal of Civil Rights and
Civil Liberties requested funding for its main
event of the year, a symposium on "Gender,
Parenting and the Law," and received $1,100 in
funding from the GSC.
