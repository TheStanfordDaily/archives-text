DEAR DR. PAUL,

This morning, after practice, I came down with something nasty. Normally I would say
it's food poisoning, but these symptoms are way worse—
feel really weak, and my stomach hurts big time. Any
chance you know what it is? Is there something I can take to make it stop?
Dear Projectile Pat,
Thank you for the very thorough description of your symptoms. It just so happens that several cases of norovirus have
recently broken out on campus. While the illness isn't contagious, it is hella gross. Norovirus is transmitted feacally through
contaminated food or water. You can also catch it through intense body-to-body contact, which I'm guessing is how you
picked up your little bug. Since you mentioned practice, I'm going to rule out a raunchy bedroom sesh and guess that
you're a wrestler. There's not much I can prescribe, other than to rest up and drink plenty of liquids—all that pooping and
vomiting could leave you dehydrated and ill-prepared for your next match.

Got a burning question you can't ask anyone else? I
