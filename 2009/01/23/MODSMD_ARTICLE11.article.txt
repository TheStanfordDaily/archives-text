# Bed, bang and beyond! Roxy Sass leaves the bed behind...

Beds are wonderful places for sleeping — I adore diving
beneath a mountain of covers, then sinking slowly into the
haze of dreamland. But when it comes to sex, beds can be
limiting. Push your sexual boundaries by venturing beyond the
linens — preferably in the bulging arms of a young gentleman —
to explore other, more thrilling, realms.
Though I am always game for traditional horizontal bed

sex, there's something toe-curlingly urgent and down
right naughty about doing it upright, especially when

conditions are just a little bit dangerous. Try the

wet steamy confines of the shower, taint the
domestic innocence of a kitchen pantry (and

why not incorporate the food around you?) or
hit the emergency button on a vacant elevator

for a quickie between floors (just straighten

his tie afterwards). Exhibitionists may find

themselves a deserted park or dark alleyway in
which to fully explore the delicious badness and

spontaneity of this lusty enterprise.

Having sex standing up is not easy. Both people
have to work a lot harder physically, making the act much

more of a workout (a perk I always enjoy taking advantage

of). The more heavy breathing, sweat and taut muscles, the bet
ter! If heights don't quite match up, stand on something stable

that will bring you up to his eye level. If Mr. Man attends the gym
regularly (this should be his incentive!), he may be able to lift you
up entirely — in this case put your arms around his neck and
wrap your legs tightly around his hips. Or have him thrust you
against a wall or countertop to give his thighs a break and both of
you better leverage.

Mattresses squeak, and if you happen to live in a shared
space, noisiness can be a problem. Lose the racket and

amp up the amusement by making yourselves a love

nest on the floor. Put pillows under knees for com-

fort, and take advantage of the silence and firmness
of the ground beneath you. Nobody home? Make

up the kitchen table or living room couch for a
change of scenery. Or gather inspiration from

"Lady Chatterly's Lover" and venture outside —

beware of beaches, however (sand and sex rarely
mix well).

Don't get me wrong — 1 do not reject the bed.

Wonderful sex can take place within its comfy folds. But

don't let it box you in — moving beyond the sheets can be

positively rejuvenating. You may discover pleasures you never
knew were possible.
