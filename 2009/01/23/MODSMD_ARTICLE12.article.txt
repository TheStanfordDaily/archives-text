# Not at all tongue tied, Bird drives "Noble Beast" with playful wordsmithing
## 
### 
Andrew Bird is a bit of an exception,
even among indie artists — quite a
statement if you consider that the
artist's creed is based on being the exception
to the rule. His very first album wasn't a
smashing debut that launched him onto the
independent scene; it was an instrumental
only collection that highlighted his violin
playing. His style has transformed significant
ly since then, but his years of classical training
and his degree in violin performance contin
ue to shine through his musically complex yet
lighthearted works, most recently with "Noble
Beast," released this past Tuesday.
Multi-instrumentalist Bird makes ample
use of his skills, pairing violin with guitar,
glockenspiel and some highly impressive
whistling. Add to that list a nuanced and
expressive voice, virtuosic songwriting skills
and pervasive wordplay, and you've encapsu
lated "Noble Beast." The limited-edition
release of the album also includes a bonus
nine-track companion instrumental disc,
"Useless Creatures." Unlike his previous
release, "Armchair Apocrypha," "Noble Beast"
focuses less on catchy tunes and more on
experimentation, both musically and lyrically.
Bird, known for his lyrics' forays into sci
entific paradoxes and other uncommon top
ics, seems here to sacrifice thematic content
for linguistic exploration, as he consistently
takes the lyrical antics on "Noble Beast" to a
higher level than any of his previous works.

His plaintive voice tosses around and slips
into phrases such as "calcified arithmetists,"
"flailing fetal fleas" and "vestments of translu
cent alabaster" without even a hiccup.
While the effect might have come across
as heavy-handed from anyone else, Bird's
smooth delivery sugarcoats the extravagant
vocabulary so that it goes down without a

hitch — even
pleasantly. In fact,
though some may
argue that the
heightened word
gymnastics may be
overused, the
phrases are so
inventive and infec
tious that one can't
help but grin when
Bird croons softly ;
about "the seem- i
ingly innocuous j
plecostomus
though posthu- !
rnous" with such ;
nonchalance that

those words seem somehow suited for every
day conversation.
Bird also employs his creative musical
chops to great effect throughout the album,
expanding into different genres but never sac
rificing the effortless and playful feel of each
song. "Masterswarm" opens in his characteris

tic indie-folk sound but morphs into bossa
nova. Both "Ouo" and "Unfolding Fans" are
short, instrumental transition tracks, which
are surprisingly helpful in maintaining and
carrying the album's pace. "Not a Robot, But a
Ghost," however, proves to be "Noble Beast's"
most musically intriguing track: Bird's voice
swoops and warbles over a rhythmic, percus-

sive background,
with certain
moments almost
reminiscent of
Thom Yorke and
Radiohead.
This isn't
to say that
"Noble Beast"
forsakes the lilt
ing, playful
music that made
Bird such a suc
cess. "Fitz and
the Dizzyspells"
captures it all in
one track with a
carefree tune

that dances around shimmering whistles and
handclaps; "Oh No" also channels this feeling
with a bit more of a laidback approach, inter
spersing "ooh, ooh" with floating melodies.
Near the end of the album, the last few tracks
mellow down, with "Souverian" ending as a
slow lament. The very last track, "On Ho!,"

makes a palindromic play with the opening
"Oh No." The titles themselves are palin
dromes, and the instrumental "On Ho!' fea
tures violin in a sound reminiscent of the
ethereal opening of "Oh No" — a tidy way to
bookend the album.
As with anything from Andrew Bird,
"Noble Beast" is imaginative and original, and
though it doesn't break far away from his pre
vious work, there's no real need to veer too lar
from a sound that carries such established
success. Although a few of his song lyrics
make an attempt at deeper themes and social
commentary, in the end, Bird seems here to
care much more about the joys of alliteration
and tongue-twisters than global issues. And
with such an effervescent and intricate album
to show for it, it's hard to find reason to com
plain.
