# Creative costumes and sets don't compensate for flat acting in "Twentieth Century"
## 
### 
On Jan. 17, the Mountain View-based
theater company Theat reWorks
debuted the latest installment of its
2008-2009 season — "Twentieth Century."
The campy comedy set in the 1930s tells the
story of Oscar Jaffe (Dan Hiatt), a flailing
Broadway producer trying to get back on his
feet by convincing his former lover, film star
Lily Garland (Rebecca Dines), to star in a new

hit. Unfortunately for Jaffe, his next hit has yet
to be written and the project lacks financial
backing. Add in Lily's jealous lover — a
deranged pharmaceutical giant who has
escaped from an asylum — plus an anxiously
adulterous doctor and mistress and a troupe
of German actors, put them all on a the
Twentieth Century Limited train from
Chicago to New York, and it would seem

you've got a recipe for an evening of screwball
fun.
However, Director Robert Kelley's staging
of "Twentieth Century" doesn't quite live up
to expectations. Odd casting and somewhat
suspect directorial choices dog the play
through its entirety, with jokes falling flat and
the'3os milieu going largely ignored. Previous
productions of "Twentieth Century" often
focused on the battle of the sexes, a theme that
is nearly absent from the Theatre Works ver
sion.
While Bay Area theater veteran Hiatt does
justice to the role of Jaffe, often evoking the
zany energy of Gene Wilder, Dines misses the
mark in her interpretation of Lily Garland.
Dines never quite commands the presence
that her role requires to fuel the tension of the
play. Dines improves in the second act, but
questionable directorial choices, including
having Garland descend into child-like histri
onics and bizarre changes in accent, hurt her
overall performance. To be fair, my disap
pointment may have been my own fault —
early on in the show I decided that only
Madeline Kahn in her prime could do justice
to the role of Lily Garland and I found myself
wishing that the show were cast like a Mel
Brooks film.

Though touted as a screwball comedy,
"Twentieth Century" lacks the pace and
charisma necessary to drive a comedy of
errors. TheatreYVorks' characteristically
remarkable set — train compartments set in a
slip stage, which creates the sensation of
movement — and impressive costuming can t
make up for the show's lack of dramatic ten
sion and stuck-on-one-speed pace. Stanford
theatergoers, you might be better off just
going to Green Library and renting the origi
nal film version of "Twentieth Century," star
ring John Barrymore and Carole Lombard —
at least it would be free.
