# Weirdest historical inaugural moments...
## 
### 
1. Don't mess with the pigeons
On the day of Richard Nixon's 1973 inauguration,
Pennsylvania Avenue was piled with sickly and dead
pigeons. Apparently Nixon didn't want the pesky
creatures to fly over the parade route, so his commit
tee spent 13,000 bucks to hose down the street with
chemical bird repellent. Hypothetically the chemical
was just supposed to make the birds' feet itch so they
wouldn't roost in the trees. Whoops.
2. Almost rained out
The weather was so horrible at Lincoln's second inau
guration that onlookers who couldn't swim were cau
tioned to stay away from the rain-soaked streets. Walt
Whitman, albeit he's always a bit dramatic, referred to
the storm as "slanting rain, full of rage."
2. Coat check gone awry
Ulysses S. Grant's ceremony in 1989 ended with fights
in the coat check line. According to The Washington
Post, the check was manned by illiterates, who could
n't manage to read the coat claims.
