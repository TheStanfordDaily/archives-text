# The 						next pop star? Girls, get ready for Alex J. Rich
## introducing alex rich 
### 
In the current environment of economic
anxiety, it's little wonder that many
Stanford students are pursuing academic
paths that they believe will bring them job
security. However, there are always those gutsy
few who decide to make their passions their

professions — regardless of the economic
risks. Alex Rich '08, aspiring" and practicing
music artist, is a case in point.
Rich started his musical career at the age
of seven when he auditioned for the Naples
Philharmonic Youth Chorale. He decided to
definitively choose a career in music when, at
the recommendation of his voice teacher, he
took a two-week seminar for young music
artists who want to break into the music
industry.

"The seminar opened my eyes to the true
magic of the music business, both dark and
light," Rich said in an interview with the Daily.
Inspired and consequently determined,
he began working with songwriter Penny
Framstad, who introduced him to producer
Dre Bowman. With Bowman, Rich created his
first single, "Love Like This," under his stage
name: Alex J. Rich. Afterwards, Rich collabo
rated with Randy Emata on his subsequent
three singles "Can't Get Back to Yesterday,"
"Don't Tell me Your Name" and"I Don't Want
To."
Instead of taking the more traditional
route — finding a steady job and creating
songs during his free time — Rich has decid
ed to make music his top occupational prior
ity.
"Like every Stanford student, I have con
templated a variety of careers," he said. "[But
when) I think about my future now, music is
really the only career that will be satisfying for
me. I know that I at least have to try to pursue
a career in music or I will always wonder what
could have been and regret not having tried."
Rich's style consists of catchy melodies,
rhythms reminiscent of R&B and lyrics which
he admitted are inspired mainly by past girl
friends, though he promised, "I'm trying to
branch out."

When it comes to categorizing himself,
however. Rich has a little more trouble.
"One of my friends in the music business
once told me that the 'pop' genre includes any
song played on the radio, anything that is
popular," he said. "I used to shy awy from
saying that my music was 'pop' because I
believed there was a negative connotation of
shallowness associated with it."
But Rich isn't afraid of embracing the
genre anymore.
"Now, when asked, I say that my music is
pop," he continued. "I think popularity is a
sign of accomplishment and those artists that
are on the radio are widely recognized as
being the best in the business."
While still working hard on his own
breakthrough, Rich had words of encourage
ment for those struggling to balance their
artistic passions with practical necessity.
"I know it's cliche, but I think most stu
dents know where their interest and passion
lies and, if that place is music, then they need
to go for it,"he said. "[The] world can always
use more music."
