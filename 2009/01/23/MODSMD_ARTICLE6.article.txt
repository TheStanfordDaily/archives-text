# From von Furstenberg-inspired frocks to products with purpose
## introducing Karen lum 
### 
Vibrant colors. Interesting cuts. Surprising details.
Pieces of junior Karen Lum's collection debuted
at last year's Charity Fashion Show to much
acclaim. It seemed as though she had been designing
and crafting her entire life. And she has, almost.
When she was 13, Lum took an art class with her
mom at a local community college and learne'd how to
sew. She "didn't learn a whole lot," but took an interest
in sewing and subsequently took to her machine at
home and mastered the art through experience.
Lum started with inspiration from other designs,
making imitations of pieces she wanted but couldn't
afford, or altered versions of pieces she wasn't com
pletely happy with. Now, while she still gets some
inspiration from watching the New York Fashion Week
videos and perusing through fashion magazines, her
designs come largely from her own imagination.
"Now I think of things, and sew them to see how
they will turn out," Lum said. "It has become much
more of an artistic pursuit."
Except when it comes to Diane von Furstenberg
(DVF). The renowned designer, credited with the cre
ation of the hallmark "wrap dress," and currently
known for her feminine, flirty designs, is Lum's
favorite: "I love Diane von Furstenberg. She is my
biggest inspiration. She just makes amazing, beautiful
clothing all the time."
One dress that Lum designed for Charity Fashion

Show was inspired by a DVF dress.
"I saw it in a boutique near my house," she said. "I
really liked the trapeze shape, but it was hot pink; it
had ruffles more toward the bottom; it looked like a
Barbie dress. I wanted to make it a little less cheesy."
Lum's design is black fabric, with subtle dot detail
ing. It's a trapeze dress — a dress that is skinny on top
and flares out toward the bottom — beautifully accent
ed by ruffles of different lengths that start at the hem
and come up. The frock is finished off by a bow at the
neck. The dress was a hit at last year's Fashion Show,
and still garners comments on Lum's Facebook page.
In spite of the acclaim, Lum does not see designing
dresses as a career. Instead, she wants to design prod
ucts.
"I want to design products to help people — prod
ucts with a social purpose," Lum said. "There was an
engineer who designed a merry-go-round that pumped
water to irrigate a field and generate electricity; an
engineer who designed a straw that acted as a filter for
drinking out of rivers and streams. I want to design
those kinds of products — products geared toward a
certain purpose, geared toward solving a particular
problem."
Fortunately for her fans, though, Lum will continue
to design clothing as a hobby.
"Fashion is something I will always do," she said, "if
only on the side."
