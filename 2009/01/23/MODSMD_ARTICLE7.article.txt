# Defying gravity, Stanford students star in STREB
##

Walking in, it seems like a regular
rehearsal: a bunch of laidback men
and women dressed in sweats and
workout clothes, chatting off-handedly and
stretching, preparing their bodies for practice.
Taking in this scene, I have no anticipation of
the shocking performance that is yet to come.
After a quick warm-up, they take to the
mat. Right off the bat, the dancers and gym
nasts start shouting off seemingly random
commands, taken as cues to leap into the air
and land flat on their stomachs â€” visually
face-planting into the mat with a loud and
jolting smack. My immediate thought is "how
painful," but lo and behold, this is what these

students have been trained to do.
The Stanford dancers and gymnasts are
preparing a piece for the highly lauded
"STREB v. Gravity" Lively Arts performance
this Saturday in Memorial Auditorium. These
athletes have been given the incredible oppor
tunity to be a part of the world-renowned
dance tour imagined and created by dance
visionary Elizabeth Streb, and have been
training for weeks to take the stage this week
end. Though the performers were not able to
incorporate their routine with the busy pro
fessional group, they will be featured in their
own segment of Saturday's show, executing
choreography taught by a member of STREB.
Once called the Evel Knievel of dance,
Elizabeth has redefined the word "dance" to
mean something entirely unconventional. She
calls her specific genre, "Pop Action," and it

seems to be a combination of dance, boxing,
gymnastics, stunt work and any other strenu
ous physical activity that can be performed
with a certain grace. According to Diane
Frank of the Stanford dance department,
"STREB vs. Gravity," Streb's newest show,
"tells the story of the natural laws that rule
our world: acceleration, momentum, velocity,
mass, speed ... the implementers of action."
The show has been described by critics as
"Jackass meets Cirque du Soleil," and Streb's
choreography has been said to be "carrying
dance into a new dimension."
"[Streb] is really interested in the founda
tional work of addressing and investigating
physical laws that are non-negotiable," Frank
said, "like gravity, centrifugal force and resist
ance."
"She constructs these amazing environ

merits," he continued, "and does aerial work
and things where dancers are suspended or
crashing into walls or diving in between cin
derblocks... you will see a tremendous
amount of activity."
Just from watching rehearsals alone, I
would say that is an understatement.
So how did our own Cardinal dancers get
the chance to be involved in such a widely
renowned tour, filled with stunts and profes
sional dancers? When Lively Arts at Stanford
booked the STREB company to perform on
campus, Frank and the dance department
approached Ms. Streb with the idea of chore
ographing a piece for Stanford students to
perform on stage with the rest of the show.
"Stanford Lively Arts did a great job
bringing in artists," Frank said, "and the whole
point of this is to present an innovative artist
