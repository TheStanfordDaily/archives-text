# Defying gravity, Stanford students star in STREB
## 
### 
Walking in, it seems like a regular
rehearsal: a bunch of laidback men
and women dressed in sweats and
workout clothes, chatting off-handedly and
stretching, preparing their bodies for practice.
Taking in this scene, I have no anticipation of
the shocking performance that is yet to come.
After a quick warm-up, they take to the
mat. Right off the bat, the dancers and gym
nasts start shouting off seemingly random
commands, taken as cues to leap into the air
and land flat on their stomachs — visually
face-planting into the mat with a loud and
jolting smack. My immediate thought is "how
painful," but lo and behold, this is what these

students have been trained to do.
The Stanford dancers and gymnasts are
preparing a piece for the highly lauded
"STREB v. Gravity" Lively Arts performance
this Saturday in Memorial Auditorium. These
athletes have been given the incredible oppor
tunity to be a part of the world-renowned
dance tour imagined and created by dance
visionary Elizabeth Streb, and have been
training for weeks to take the stage this week
end. Though the performers were not able to
incorporate their routine with the busy pro
fessional group, they will be featured in their
own segment of Saturday's show, executing
choreography taught by a member of STREB.
Once called the Evel Knievel of dance,
Elizabeth has redefined the word "dance" to
mean something entirely unconventional. She
calls her specific genre, "Pop Action," and it

seems to be a combination of dance, boxing,
gymnastics, stunt work and any other strenu
ous physical activity that can be performed
with a certain grace. According to Diane
Frank of the Stanford dance department,
"STREB vs. Gravity," Streb's newest show,
"tells the story of the natural laws that rule
our world: acceleration, momentum, velocity,
mass, speed ... the implementers of action."
The show has been described by critics as
"Jackass meets Cirque du Soleil," and Streb's
choreography has been said to be "carrying
dance into a new dimension."
"[Streb] is really interested in the founda
tional work of addressing and investigating
physical laws that are non-negotiable," Frank
said, "like gravity, centrifugal force and resist
ance."
"She constructs these amazing environ

merits," he continued, "and does aerial work
and things where dancers are suspended or
crashing into walls or diving in between cin
derblocks... you will see a tremendous
amount of activity."
Just from watching rehearsals alone, I
would say that is an understatement.
So how did our own Cardinal dancers get
the chance to be involved in such a widely
renowned tour, filled with stunts and profes
sional dancers? When Lively Arts at Stanford
booked the STREB company to perform on
campus, Frank and the dance department
approached Ms. Streb with the idea of chore
ographing a piece for Stanford students to
perform on stage with the rest of the show.
"Stanford Lively Arts did a great job
bringing in artists," Frank said, "and the whole
point of this is to present an innovative artist

— and Streb is groundbreaking, both literally and metaphori
cally."
But it wasn't that easy, Frank explained: "When we asked
her for a small [amount of] time on stage, she was hesitant. We
needed students who were talented enough tor the level of skill
and commitment this choreography demands."
In addition to the inclusion of students in this weekend's
show, members of the Stanford community participated in
several Streb-related activities this week, including a dance
master class, a design workshop on set building and a talk
given by Ms. Streb herself.
"Whether you arc interested in extreme sports, engineer
ing or just being entertained, this isn't the kind of dance that
you need to analyze or think about," Frank said. It is what it
is, and you just enjoy it."
What may be the most interesting facet of this opportuni
ty is the inclusion of the Stanford students, despite their
diverse dance backgrounds. Stanford does not offer any majors
in dance — only a minor — and Frank handpicked the per

formers for the show.
Brittney Broadwater '09 said that the choreography was
something that came naturally to her since she has been "doing
gymnastics since 1 was four and cheerleading throughout mid
dle school and high school." Watching her practice, you would
think that she was a professional dancer, rather than a regular
student with a background in dance.
Student performers Linda Phung'll and Zach D'Angelo
'11 are taking advantage of the minor in dance. Phung dances
six times a week, in addition to participating in other activities.
D'Angelo, an engineering major with a minor in dance,
claimed, "No matter how busy I get, I'm not going to get rid of
dance."
But the dancers and gymnasts had a new skill to master in
perfecting this show: trust. Sliding across a mat underneath
another high-flying dancer requires immense self assurance
that the dancer above you will not land on top of you by acci
dent. At one point, a specific move is designed so that a dancer
flips and lands directly on top of another person, mimicking

extreme impact. When asked about the intensity of the tasks,
Phung said, "It just takes practice. Obviously, you can't just
start by throwing yourself on the mat."
"You just have to mentally prepare yourself for the
impact," D'Angelo added, "and make sure you understand and
arc comfortable smacking into the mat with no reservations."
This type of performance, while seemingly inconceivable
to me, is a great time for these Stanford students. As
Broadwater said, "It's hard work, but it's definitely fun."
To catch these high flyers in a performance your eyes
won't believe, get to Memorial Auditorium at 8 p.m. on
Saturday. Lively Arts is offering specially priced tickets to
Stanford students for only $10.
