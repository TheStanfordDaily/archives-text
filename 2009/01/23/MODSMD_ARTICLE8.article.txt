# They put the "sketch" in sketchy grad student

### 
There is a small tray by Carissa Carter's desk filled with
machined wooden balls of varying sizes. She rolls
them idly as we talk.
"I haven't figured out yet what I'm going to do with
these," she says. "But feel free to try them out."
I do, sticking my hand in and smoothly moving them
around the box. It's an oddly pleasing sensation, like collect
ing grapes on the space shuttle, but 1 can't imagine what use
they could have. "I figure if 1 leave this here long enough,
something will come to me," she explains, smiling brightly.
Carissa Carter is a third-year Ph.D. student in Stanford's
engineering-design program, which, as she explains it, is the
year you can "do whatever you want." It's an interesting sort
of mission, one that could, admittedly, result in an explosion
of eclecticism, sending a designer off onto a thousand diver
gent paths, dispersing her talent. I look around Carter's
workspace, noting the painted redwood blocks that she's used
to construct a typological alphabet ("reducing the concept of
a pixel to its bare bones"), the stacks of colored maps, the
magnetic tiles she uses to construct articulated idea flow
charts. Is that what's happening here? I feel lost in the eye of
this conceptual explosion. I'm pretty sure, however, that this
is what she wants.
Carter's work, for all its diversity, is really quite focused,
always seeming to come back to what might be termed
knowledge transfer between components and the whole. Her

work with awkwardness, for instance, segues nicely from my
awed behavior in the eminently relaxed atmosphere of the
product design loft.
She leads me to a portfolio, explaining that she's "always
loved awkwardness." Who doesn't? It's one of the great sym
bols of the modern age — the slow, subtle encroachment on
the acceptable, always teetering between an unplaceable sense
of unease and a full-blown Judd Apatow film. Hut Carissa
Carter holds an interest in the embarrassing that might be
cruel if she weren't so pleasant about it. Naturally, then,
rather than use design to eliminate the phenomenon, Carter
has chosen to accentuate it.
What she's done is tentatively map out the three imme
diate sources of social awkwardness — violations of the self,
others or public space — and target each of these with a
product unlikely, perhaps, to be mass-marketed any time, but
nevertheless effective. Perhaps the most aggressive of these
was her proposed concept for the understatedly titled
"Awareness Chairs" — a pair of seats intended, in her words,
"specifically for first dates." Via an array of motion and heat
sensors, the two chairs would be linked, such that every
motion in one cushion would be translated and felt in the
other. Every nervous twitch or discomfited shift would be
broadcast electronically to your partner's buttocks. She
describes this, and I think back to a first date in high school,
at a small purple-walled Thai restaurant with hard wooden
chairs that, every three minutes or so, caused me to slide for
ward and down into a slouch with alarming rapidity. In an
Awareness Chair, 1 might as well have been punching my
date's thighs.
"When you spend enough time in elevators, they start to
seem like living beings." Carter turns the page to a picture of
a hoodied man standing in the middle of the Terman eleva
tor, looking at his feet. He's looking at a "Plinko Floor" she
installed — a transparent surface beneath which a collection
of tiny spheres could be seen rolling freely. Flexing slightly
beneath the man's weight, the floor would cause the balls to
roll to wherever he was standing, indicating his presence.
"People normally just stand, looking straight forward, not
moving," she points out, but this automatic tendency to
ignore other elevator riders becomes more difficult when the
balls underneath you roll to greet the next person to step in.
At least, this was her intent — simply a subtle way of indicat
ing your fellow elevator-rider's presence. Instead, the elevator
doors would open and the people waiting outside would see
three or four passengers moving around intently, fascinated
by the movement of the balls. She deems this an unqualified

success. "Now, I get even more excited about awkwardness
when I see it, thinking about how I can recreate it."
Something about these iterative developments is particu
larly appealing to Carter, and much of her work is devoted to
exposing the processes that cause a concept to eventually
resolve itself into a product, often through what have been
called "deep" or "rich" maps. Her "Spin Theory" project
examines this process at its most basic — through the cre
ation of successive generations of tops. Starting with a "basic
top setup with a tad of flair," meaning pipe cleaners, as it is
described on her concept map, she would first spin the top,
record reactions to the top, build a new top based directly on
the comments she had received, and repeat.
In the comprehensive map she's since compiled, outlin
ing the taxonomy of her toys, spectacular changes begin
appearing quite quickly. One top called "Dada," a complex
and asymmetrical acrylic construction, birthed "Pre-turned
Wood," an unfinished block of wood clamped to top point.
"Alien Nutjob" gives way to a wooden egg, which later leads,
somehow, to a spinning trashcan. "We can't go straight from
ideas to making things. We make prototypes, and it's impor
tant to know what they mean," she explains, pointing to pho
tos of the enormous rearrangeable map she eventually con
structed to tell her development narrative. "Maps tell you
where you should go, what holes you should try to fill."
It's a hole in the world of maps themselves that she's try
ing to fill now with her "Emergent Design" concept. She
believes that, while you can get information on the Internet
about anything, perspective remains elusive, particularly per
spective married to geography. She's looking for a qualitative
database. I ask if she means a large-scale way of collecting
personal data. "No," she replies, laughing nervously. "That
sounds invasive. I'd say I'm looking for stories." Using
Amazon's Mechanical Turk — a service normally used for
outsourcing brief tasks to remote workers — Carter has sent
out requests for personal stories and opinions, hoping to
incorporate them into a digital map. She calls this "world
ethnography," and views it as a toolset for anyone who makes
decisions about large groups. It's a way of decentralizing
agency in data collection, of giving a voice to those small
components of the whole.
This is a lofty goal, but, after all, it's these sorts of ideals
that brought her to design from her undergraduate major in
geology. "It gives you an opportunity to have an impact," as
she puts it, "but with a faster turnaround than as a scientist."
Her hand moves again to the balls in the tray. "It's about tak
ing the little things and bringing them out."


Minjeong Mm comes to the design school trom a
distinctly different background of the art world;
And not merely as a UC Berkeley undergraduate,
but as a 2nd-grade art teacher — the one that rolls around
the school with a cart piled high with acrylics, construction
paper and 4B pencils, occasionally pulling out a binder full of

potential class projects.
"There are a lot of theories on the 'right' way to draw a
tree," she says, "but I didn't want to give them specific direc
tions. I'd just tell them to trace the line with their eyes and
not look at the paper, and we'd end up with 20 magnificent
trees, each completely different."
This reintroduction of the human touch has become
something of a mission for Kim, particularly in the often
sterile world of Silicon Valley culture. The importance of an
object's basic physicality compels her, she explains, hefting
the bones of a clock — the motor and hands, stripped of
numbers — that she plans to arrange into a clicking,
whirring array.
As an undergraduate, Kim leaned much more towards
the abstract, to the point that she briefly attempted double
majoring in the twin paragons of academic purity: physics
and art. Nevertheless, in her early work, the roots of the more
handmade aesthetic she brings to design can be seen. Her ele
gant and comical "Headrest," for instance, is a curvilinear,
organic cardboard construction meant to aid the "sleep
deprived college student, who must fall asleep during lecture,
but does not want to be obvious." Placed around the wearer's
head, the basketlike structure provides comfortable, surrepti
tious neck support for the drowsy. Even more theoretically

consistent with her new message is the "6-minute Tart": in
this short piece, the audience is presented with a video mon
tage of a tart being baked. As soon as the video is over, the
artist comes from behind the screen and serves the tart. Here,
the goal is to, as she says, "bring the art out of the studio."
In some ways, the first year of the design program does
not cater to this vision. The Stanford design method, which
has a certain scientific rigor to it, bears more relation to her
experiences as an architecture intern in Seoul than anything
else. She does not remember those days fondly: "It was," she
says, "a discouraging experience." Nevertheless, the constant
demand to produce more and more projects is something she
acknowledges a designer has to get used to — "everyone has a
deadline," as she puts it.
Still, her more recent projects have maintained a certain
air of hominess that remains unobscured by the rapidity of
the production cycle. High in the Design Loft, a portable
emergency shelter she and several classmates designed earlier
this year is visible: it is a slightly disheveled bivouac made of
what appears to be PVC piping and a waterproof fabric that
nevertheless maintains an attractive homespun stability that
implies the presence of the human hand, both of the maker
— and this is Kim's expressed larger intent — and that of the
future user.

I meet with David Goligorsky in "The Chat Room." In this
tiny alcove of the expansive d.school the walls are pat
terned aggressively with black curlicues, nicely framing
the nattily attired man saying, "The mark of a true designer is
trying to design everything about their lives." He looks
around. "I'm not sure who designed this place."
Goligorsky is a first-year student in the school of project
design and a clear East Coast transplant. My hiking boots,
jeans and faded T-shirt feel vaguely inappropriate in the light
of his impeccable corduroys, sweater and tie — a Woody
Allen-cleaned-up sort of look no less clean for having spent

the last few hours attempting to grind pink foam into the
shape of an alpha-helix.
He is currently in the middle of the oddly abstract and
interdisciplinary demands made by the first year program. In
Goligorsky's articulate, aphoristic phrasing, "You can't dig
new holes by digging old holes deeper." And so, the pink
foam. No one, it is safe to say, has worked in pink foam
before. Goligorsky, in fact, has his background in piezoelec
tric ceramics and other "smart" materials used in aerospace
engineering — a job that, he says, "didn't really take into
account what people need or want."
Not to say this past wasn't useful. Rather, the d.school's
goal is to bring students from any number of disciplines into
contact with one another, and, even if the demands of the
designing life aren't exactly equivalent to those of his previ
ous work, "the most important thing you can get out of an
engineering degree is the knowledge that you can do any
thing."
Which, arguably, is why he's spending his free hours
carefully beveling the edges of a pink block, following his
computer models of varyingly pitched helices. His assign
ment is to implicitly communicate the notions of "open" and
"closed." Though a narrow assignment, and one of the funda
mental courses students must take before throwing them
selves fully into projects that personally interest them, this
concept of implicit narrative does mesh nicely with
Goligorsky's own design interests.
Perhaps more illustrative of this desire than any of
Goligorsky's recent work, even if it does not fit as neatly into
the genre of "design" as some of his more physical pieces, is

the "Gentleman's Whisky and Chat"he organized in Boston's
Union Square last March. As he explains it, Goligorsky would
read Hemingway and Fitzgerald as he walked to work every
morning, and slowly began to realize — his own dress
notwithstanding — that the life of the gentleman as espoused
by these two icons of proper masculinity was in danger of
falling by the wayside. He felt "this mixture of opulence and
scarcity," propriety and self-reliance exemplified by, for
instance, the noirish but debonair Gary Grant persona, had
something to offer modern society. In the interest of explor
ing this possibility, he began organizing a low-key affair — a
parlor-room-style party in which formal clothing and urbane
conversation would be encouraged. Slowly, however, as the
date approached, more and more people gained interest in
the project. Local shop owners and bands got involved, and a
representative from Bushmills Whiskey even offered to pro
vide the drinks free of charge. Soon, Goligorsky found his
private event featured on yelp.com.
That this clear and successful creation of a very specific,
immediately identifiable narrative — that of the turn-of-the
ccntury male — has any direct relationship to the grinding
Goligorsky is about to return to as soon as I leave seems fan
tastic. Nevertheless, the connection is there. "There is," he
says as we walk back to the Design Loft, "a difference
between, say, designing a new mp3 player and giving people a
soundtrack for their lives."
