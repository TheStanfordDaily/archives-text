# They put the "sketch" in sketchy grad student

There is a small tray by Carissa Carter's desk filled with
machined wooden balls of varying sizes. She rolls
them idly as we talk.
"I haven't figured out yet what I'm going to do with
these," she says. "But feel free to try them out."
I do, sticking my hand in and smoothly moving them
around the box. It's an oddly pleasing sensation, like collect
ing grapes on the space shuttle, but 1 can't imagine what use
they could have. "I figure if 1 leave this here long enough,
something will come to me," she explains, smiling brightly.
Carissa Carter is a third-year Ph.D. student in Stanford's
engineering-design program, which, as she explains it, is the
year you can "do whatever you want." It's an interesting sort
of mission, one that could, admittedly, result in an explosion
of eclecticism, sending a designer off onto a thousand diver
gent paths, dispersing her talent. I look around Carter's
workspace, noting the painted redwood blocks that she's used
to construct a typological alphabet ("reducing the concept of
a pixel to its bare bones"), the stacks of colored maps, the
magnetic tiles she uses to construct articulated idea flow
charts. Is that what's happening here? I feel lost in the eye of
this conceptual explosion. I'm pretty sure, however, that this
is what she wants.
Carter's work, for all its diversity, is really quite focused,
always seeming to come back to what might be termed
knowledge transfer between components and the whole. Her

work with awkwardness, for instance, segues nicely from my
awed behavior in the eminently relaxed atmosphere of the
product design loft.
She leads me to a portfolio, explaining that she's "always
loved awkwardness." Who doesn't? It's one of the great sym
bols of the modern age — the slow, subtle encroachment on
the acceptable, always teetering between an unplaceable sense
of unease and a full-blown Judd Apatow film. Hut Carissa
Carter holds an interest in the embarrassing that might be
cruel if she weren't so pleasant about it. Naturally, then,
rather than use design to eliminate the phenomenon, Carter
has chosen to accentuate it.
What she's done is tentatively map out the three imme
diate sources of social awkwardness — violations of the self,
others or public space — and target each of these with a
product unlikely, perhaps, to be mass-marketed any time, but
nevertheless effective. Perhaps the most aggressive of these
was her proposed concept for the understatedly titled
"Awareness Chairs" — a pair of seats intended, in her words,
"specifically for first dates." Via an array of motion and heat
sensors, the two chairs would be linked, such that every
motion in one cushion would be translated and felt in the
other. Every nervous twitch or discomfited shift would be
broadcast electronically to your partner's buttocks. She
describes this, and I think back to a first date in high school,
at a small purple-walled Thai restaurant with hard wooden
chairs that, every three minutes or so, caused me to slide for
ward and down into a slouch with alarming rapidity. In an
Awareness Chair, 1 might as well have been punching my
date's thighs.
"When you spend enough time in elevators, they start to
seem like living beings." Carter turns the page to a picture of
a hoodied man standing in the middle of the Terman eleva
tor, looking at his feet. He's looking at a "Plinko Floor" she
installed — a transparent surface beneath which a collection
of tiny spheres could be seen rolling freely. Flexing slightly
beneath the man's weight, the floor would cause the balls to
roll to wherever he was standing, indicating his presence.
"People normally just stand, looking straight forward, not
moving," she points out, but this automatic tendency to
ignore other elevator riders becomes more difficult when the
balls underneath you roll to greet the next person to step in.
At least, this was her intent — simply a subtle way of indicat
ing your fellow elevator-rider's presence. Instead, the elevator
doors would open and the people waiting outside would see
three or four passengers moving around intently, fascinated
by the movement of the balls. She deems this an unqualified

success. "Now, I get even more excited about awkwardness
when I see it, thinking about how I can recreate it."
Something about these iterative developments is particu
larly appealing to Carter, and much of her work is devoted to
exposing the processes that cause a concept to eventually
resolve itself into a product, often through what have been
called "deep" or "rich" maps. Her "Spin Theory" project
examines this process at its most basic — through the cre
ation of successive generations of tops. Starting with a "basic
top setup with a tad of flair," meaning pipe cleaners, as it is
described on her concept map, she would first spin the top,
record reactions to the top, build a new top based directly on
the comments she had received, and repeat.
In the comprehensive map she's since compiled, outlin
ing the taxonomy of her toys, spectacular changes begin
appearing quite quickly. One top called "Dada," a complex
and asymmetrical acrylic construction, birthed "Pre-turned
Wood," an unfinished block of wood clamped to top point.
"Alien Nutjob" gives way to a wooden egg, which later leads,
somehow, to a spinning trashcan. "We can't go straight from
ideas to making things. We make prototypes, and it's impor
tant to know what they mean," she explains, pointing to pho
tos of the enormous rearrangeable map she eventually con
structed to tell her development narrative. "Maps tell you
where you should go, what holes you should try to fill."
It's a hole in the world of maps themselves that she's try
ing to fill now with her "Emergent Design" concept. She
believes that, while you can get information on the Internet
about anything, perspective remains elusive, particularly per
spective married to geography. She's looking for a qualitative
database. I ask if she means a large-scale way of collecting
personal data. "No," she replies, laughing nervously. "That
sounds invasive. I'd say I'm looking for stories." Using
Amazon's Mechanical Turk — a service normally used for
outsourcing brief tasks to remote workers — Carter has sent
out requests for personal stories and opinions, hoping to
incorporate them into a digital map. She calls this "world
ethnography," and views it as a toolset for anyone who makes
decisions about large groups. It's a way of decentralizing
agency in data collection, of giving a voice to those small
components of the whole.
This is a lofty goal, but, after all, it's these sorts of ideals
that brought her to design from her undergraduate major in
geology. "It gives you an opportunity to have an impact," as
she puts it, "but with a faster turnaround than as a scientist."
Her hand moves again to the balls in the tray. "It's about tak
ing the little things and bringing them out."
