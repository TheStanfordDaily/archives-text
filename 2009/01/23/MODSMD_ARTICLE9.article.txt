"Cold Souls"
"Cold Souls" is a delightful and beautiful
film in the tradition of such comedic matter
of-fact science fiction as Woody Allen's
"Sleeper" and "Being John Malkovich."
It stars Paul Giamatti as himself as he
suffers while performing "Uncle Vanya."
Caught in a deep draught of listlessness and
depression, Giamatti can't bear the weight of
his soul. On the strength of a New Yorker
article, he enlists the Soul Storage Company
to extract it for him. The Company promises,
upon the completion of the procedure, that
Giamatti will be free of the burden of his
soul, and that he'll feel so much lighter not
having to carry it around anymore. He'll be
able to perform "Uncle Vanya" without the
crushing depression and entangling involve
ment that previously accompanied the role.
"When you're soulless," says the director
of the Company (David Strathairn), "things
just make so much more sense." Trouble is,
though Giamatti doesn't immediately see it,
not having a soul leaves him, well, a bit
empty: He becomes a loudmouth and a dis
gusting bore at dinner, can't make love to his
wife and certainly can't play Uncle Vanya,
though his confidence grows and grows and
his rehearsals are less painful.
"Cold Souls" has many great moments,
but none better than Giamatti's post-proce
dure rendition of the scene we saw him do
earlier in his depression. Never have 1 seen a
more horrendous version of "Vanya," or a
funnier rendition. It's a sign of great skill that
Giamatti can act so badly on purpose — and
then switch back on and play the role to the
best of his ability, all the while inhabiting his
own character. Giamatti eventually realizes
that he needs his soul back out of storage to
act, but the Soul Storage Company has lost it.
Actually, it's been stolen and taken to Russia
to be implanted in the body of a Russian tro
phy wife with dreams of being a soap opera
actress. In addition to the company's

Manhattan operation, apparently, Soul
Storage has a seedier side: black-market soul
trafficking. An operation in Russia extracts
souls and sends them to New York, illegally,
by way of "soul mules." Nina (Dina Korzun)
happens to be slated to take Giamatti's soul,
and they enjoy a drag-out adventure through
Russia to try to get it back.
"Cold Souls" is a razor-sharp yet gentle
skewering of our age: When the company
eventually goes under as a result of the
Russian black-market scandal, for example,
the unclaimed souls are bought up by a
hedge fund. In its satire, it pulls no punches,
but nevertheless has deeper things to say
about art, the artist and the human need for
some kind of suffering — that inflicted by
the weight of a soul or otherwise. The soul
extraction machines look like MRIs with
glass cones and needles and lights inside; the
soul comes out, in its various forms, in a jar
that looks a bit like a bottle of Voss water.
Where "Cold Souls" really comes through is
in its dry delivery and patient, blase accept-

ance of a wall of bottled-up human souls,
even as the flabbergasted Giamatti grows just
as incredulous as the audience.
"The Carter"
Whenever Lil Wayne is involved, strange
and genius things start to happen. Everything
the rapper touches seems to turn to gold, or
at least to diamond-encrusted Jacob chains.
Adam Bhala Lough's new documentary,
which premiered at Sundance, is no excep
tion.
Easily the most anticipated film of the
festival, the film's midnight opening on
Saturday was one of the strangest screenings
I've ever been to. The 1,000-plus seat Eccles
Theatre crackled with electric energy as the
line spilled around the block with a rowdy,
slightly drunk crowd — far from the stodgy
Park City natives and all-business film execu
tives found at most of the other screenings.
T.l. was in attendance, and 50 Cent's after
party drew a following of shiny Escalades
and Lamborghinis with huge rims. Not bad

for a sleepy ski town in a largely conservative
Mormon state whose general population
would not approve of the hip-hop lifestyle,
not to mention the content of Lil Wayne's
songs and the film itself.
Still, for all the hype, "The Carter" was a
bit disappointing as a documentary. Though
Lil Wayne is ceaselessly entertaining on
screen, reeling off quote after quote of siz
zurp-swilling wisdom, the documentary
doesn't delve deeply enough into the past of
the rapper, or the circumstances that led to
his rise to fame and nearly unprecedented
domination of the musical scene. The film
would have been more successful to explain
his beginnings, his desires, his meaning.
Instead, "The Carter" offers Lil Wayne as he
is — not at all an easy thing to accomplish.
Where the film is most valuable is in its
unvarnished window into the rapper's
recording process — the enthralling shots of
Lil Wayne rapping into his portable studio
with a breathtaking intensity. We see the
artist in grand hotel rooms, on his tour bus,
