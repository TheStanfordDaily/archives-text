"Cold Souls"
"Cold Souls" is a delightful and beautiful
film in the tradition of such comedic matter
of-fact science fiction as Woody Allen's
"Sleeper" and "Being John Malkovich."
It stars Paul Giamatti as himself as he
suffers while performing "Uncle Vanya."
Caught in a deep draught of listlessness and
depression, Giamatti can't bear the weight of
his soul. On the strength of a New Yorker
article, he enlists the Soul Storage Company
to extract it for him. The Company promises,
upon the completion of the procedure, that
Giamatti will be free of the burden of his
soul, and that he'll feel so much lighter not
having to carry it around anymore. He'll be
able to perform "Uncle Vanya" without the
crushing depression and entangling involve
ment that previously accompanied the role.
"When you're soulless," says the director
of the Company (David Strathairn), "things
just make so much more sense." Trouble is,
though Giamatti doesn't immediately see it,
not having a soul leaves him, well, a bit
empty: He becomes a loudmouth and a dis
gusting bore at dinner, can't make love to his
wife and certainly can't play Uncle Vanya,
though his confidence grows and grows and
his rehearsals are less painful.
"Cold Souls" has many great moments,
but none better than Giamatti's post-proce
dure rendition of the scene we saw him do
earlier in his depression. Never have 1 seen a
more horrendous version of "Vanya," or a
funnier rendition. It's a sign of great skill that
Giamatti can act so badly on purpose — and
then switch back on and play the role to the
best of his ability, all the while inhabiting his
own character. Giamatti eventually realizes
that he needs his soul back out of storage to
act, but the Soul Storage Company has lost it.
Actually, it's been stolen and taken to Russia
to be implanted in the body of a Russian tro
phy wife with dreams of being a soap opera
actress. In addition to the company's

Manhattan operation, apparently, Soul
Storage has a seedier side: black-market soul
trafficking. An operation in Russia extracts
souls and sends them to New York, illegally,
by way of "soul mules." Nina (Dina Korzun)
happens to be slated to take Giamatti's soul,
and they enjoy a drag-out adventure through
Russia to try to get it back.
"Cold Souls" is a razor-sharp yet gentle
skewering of our age: When the company
eventually goes under as a result of the
Russian black-market scandal, for example,
the unclaimed souls are bought up by a
hedge fund. In its satire, it pulls no punches,
but nevertheless has deeper things to say
about art, the artist and the human need for
some kind of suffering — that inflicted by
the weight of a soul or otherwise. The soul
extraction machines look like MRIs with
glass cones and needles and lights inside; the
soul comes out, in its various forms, in a jar
that looks a bit like a bottle of Voss water.
Where "Cold Souls" really comes through is
in its dry delivery and patient, blase accept-

ance of a wall of bottled-up human souls,
even as the flabbergasted Giamatti grows just
as incredulous as the audience.
"The Carter"
Whenever Lil Wayne is involved, strange
and genius things start to happen. Everything
the rapper touches seems to turn to gold, or
at least to diamond-encrusted Jacob chains.
Adam Bhala Lough's new documentary,
which premiered at Sundance, is no excep
tion.
Easily the most anticipated film of the
festival, the film's midnight opening on
Saturday was one of the strangest screenings
I've ever been to. The 1,000-plus seat Eccles
Theatre crackled with electric energy as the
line spilled around the block with a rowdy,
slightly drunk crowd — far from the stodgy
Park City natives and all-business film execu
tives found at most of the other screenings.
T.l. was in attendance, and 50 Cent's after
party drew a following of shiny Escalades
and Lamborghinis with huge rims. Not bad

for a sleepy ski town in a largely conservative
Mormon state whose general population
would not approve of the hip-hop lifestyle,
not to mention the content of Lil Wayne's
songs and the film itself.
Still, for all the hype, "The Carter" was a
bit disappointing as a documentary. Though
Lil Wayne is ceaselessly entertaining on
screen, reeling off quote after quote of siz
zurp-swilling wisdom, the documentary
doesn't delve deeply enough into the past of
the rapper, or the circumstances that led to
his rise to fame and nearly unprecedented
domination of the musical scene. The film
would have been more successful to explain
his beginnings, his desires, his meaning.
Instead, "The Carter" offers Lil Wayne as he
is — not at all an easy thing to accomplish.
Where the film is most valuable is in its
unvarnished window into the rapper's
recording process — the enthralling shots of
Lil Wayne rapping into his portable studio
with a breathtaking intensity. We see the
artist in grand hotel rooms, on his tour bus,


on street corners and in parking lots yelling
devilish rhymes into the microphone —
headphones on, utterly focused on his craft
and always moving on to the next track. He
never stops recording, just as he ceaselessly
lights blunts (one or two in every scene) and
downs the cough syrup out of his doubled
Styrofoam cups.

The film also gives us a plain and com
plex understanding of Wayne's motivations.
Here is an artist compelled, with the same
addictive intensity with which he consumes
codeine syrup and marijuana, to record, to
create, at all times. "The Carter" shows us the
fire in Wayne's eyes, that behind his huge
sunglasses and diamond grill he burns with a

compulsive intensity more than any artist of
our generation, seeking to be the best and to
record the most — utterly dedicated to never
slow down or stop.
"Sin Nombre"
"Sin Nombre" is a revelation, an unex
pectedly fresh film from a largely untested
director and cast, a film of escape and strug
gle set within the hardscrabble and deadly
worlds of illegal immigration and Latin
America's Mara Salvatrucha gang.
Casper (Edgar Flores) is a soldier in the
Mara who runs afoul of the gang's rigid and
brutal code when he neglects some of his
duties and visits the girl he loves. Taken on a
last-chance mission to rob a train with the
clica's leader, Casper runs into Sayra, a
Honduran girl on the way to America with
her family (Paulina Gaitan). Sayra's family
and hundreds of other immigrants to Mexico
and the North ride dangerously on top of the
train at the mercy of bandits, gang members

and border patrol, desperately lighting oil
sleep to keep from falling off the rickety cars.
When Casper saves Sayra's life and kills Lil®
Mago, his divorce from the gang is complete,
and now "greenlighted" and marked, he must
run and keep running.
Director Gary Fukunaga strove for the
highest authenticity, casting native non
actors, gaining the trust of the gang and its
prison-based hierarchy and even making the
immense train journey himself before
attempting the film. Fukunaga's painstaking
work pays off. "Sin Nombre" represents an
epic achievement: claustrophobic and sus
penseful in the hot and dirty conditions of
the immigrant train, it is an exploration of
the moral soul mated to an almost Western
style shoot-'em-up.
Tense and at times shockingly violent,
the film's main topic is displacement —
Casper and Sayra are both "without a name"
and without an identity; Casper has given his

The September Issue" was the hottest
ticket at Sundance, and with good rea
son. Producer/Director R.J. Cutler's
beautifully made documentary focuses on
one of the most powerful and fascinating
women in the world — legendary Vogue
Editor in Chief and fashion maverick Anna
Wintour.
In the constantly evolving world of fash
ion, Wintour and her power are a constant.
As Cutler said in a Q&A after the film, "You
can create computer software without the
approval of Bill Gates, you can deliver a great
film without the approval of Steven
Spielberg, but you cannot succeed in the
fashion world without the approval of Anna
Wintour ... if Anna gets behind something,
it sells." Indeed, as the documentary reveals,
Wintour is the foremost leader in the fashion
world. In fact, "The September Issue" even
argues that, seeing as Wintour is the single
most important figure in the over $300 bil
lion fashion industry, she may just be the
most powerful woman in the United States.
Or, as one fashionista explains in the film,
"fashion is a religion and (Wintour) is the
Pope."
Those who go to "The September Issue"
hoping to see a repeat of "The Devil Wears
Prada" (of which Wintour was the "purport
ed" inspiration) may be disappointed. While
there are certainly many scenes in "The
September Issue" that carry an uncanny

resemblance to "Prada," the documentary
doesn't set out to paint Wintour as a villain
or play into the übiquitous stereotypes and
rumors surrounding her. Rather, the focal
point of the film is to document the nine
months leading up to the printing of the
September issue of Vogue, the most coveted
and authoritative Vogue issue every year.
During the process, viewers are treated to a
behind-the-scenes look at Wintour's life and
work. We follow her to France and Italy,
where she travels regularly for runway shows.
We watch her lead closed-door staff meet
ings, critique seemingly perfect models and
photos and demand re-shoots and intimidate
staff members and designers to the point at
which they become speechless.
However, Cutler also reveals a side to
Wintour that doesn't fit with her "Devil" per
sona. We watch her interact with her daugh
ter at home and see her genuine pride in a
personal interview as she talks about her
children. We see her as a mentor, providing
advice to young designer Thakoon, and
glimpse her genuine excitement for him after
his fashion line for Gap is unveiled. One of
the most poignant moments of the film is
when Wintour is asked to describe how her
family views her job, and it seems for a brief
moment that she is almost embarrassed of
her work in an industry that some consider
superficial and inconsequential when she

mentions almost sheepishly that her family
finds her job "amusing." This same (dare I
say) vulnerability resurfaces while she dis
cusses the fashion industry with her daugh
ter, who asserts that caring so much about
fashion and style is "silly" and "pointless."
While every aspect of the film is well
done and every scene engaging and highly
entertaining, perhaps the most interesting
facet of "The September Issue" is the depic
tion of Wintour's relationship with Vogue
Creative Director Grace Coddington. While
most Voguettes and industry heavyweights in
the film are deferential to Wintour and never
question her authority, Coddington is not
afraid to challenge Wintour and does so reg
ularly. As Coddington says, "You have to
learn the way to beat your path through to
make yourself felt and make yourself neces
sary." The constant tension between
Wintour's and Coddington's opinions on
what is best for the magazine and their
sometimes clashing aesthetics and constant
tug-of-war relationship makes for an inter
esting dramatic viewing experience, since we
finally see Wintour being forced to defend
herself and her decisions and even ... com
promise.
"The September Issue" is expertly

filmed; each frame
is saturated with
style, fashion and

color and a cool, funky electro-pop sound
track adds to the already glamorous vibe.
Watching how an incredibly sawy, decisive
and powerful woman manages her power
and her personal life and glimpsing all the
personalities, stresses, excitement, glamour,
grit and hard work that goes into creating
what is considered the "Bible" of the fashion
industry is a wildly fun ride. What's more,
Wintour delivers several quotable (and some
times unintentionally hilarious) sound bites,
such as "What I often see is that people are
frightened of fashion, and because it scares
them or makes them feel insecure they try to
put it down ... Just because someone wants
to wear Carolina Herrera instead of some
thing from K-Mart, doesn't make them a
dumb person."
"The September Issue" will likely be a hit
at the box office and with critics. Wintour is
fabulously dynamic and makes for the per
fect subject of study, and Cutler provides a
sleek and stylish glimpse into a world that
many dream about but few experience.

name and his life to the Mara
Salvatrucha while Sayra is another
invisible immigrant fleeing to
America. Both are cut off and dis
connected, with no place to go —
their existence is solely confined to
a rattling train in the jungles and
farms of southern Mexico. Their
past is destroyed and irrecoverable,
their future along the tracks in
front of them threatened with
death sentences and fogged with
uncertainty. Still, Casper and Sayra
struggle on, and it is this anony
mous struggle that gives the film its
potency and makes Fukunaga's
debut such a moving and engaging
spectacle.
"The Missing Person"
"The Missing Person" stars the
brooding, brazen Michael Shannon
as alcoholic, sardonic, damaged
detective John Rosow, who fills his
martini glass again and again while
tailing a man and a boy from
Chicago to L.A.
Most actors, when they attempt
a scene of drunkenness or take on
the role of an alcoholic character,
overplay the boisterousness or bel
ligerence of their subjects and pro
duce an unconvincing portrait of
inebriation — the caricature of a
drunk, and not the real thing.
Shannon avoids the pitfalls of "act

ing drunk" with graceful, witty steps.
He creates a fascinating and real
mixture of Rosow's alcoholism, the
grief of the detective's recent past
and his overarching intelligence and
humor.
Full of delightful idiosyncrasies
and memorable moments, "The
Missing Person" ended up being my
favorite film of the festival.
Director Noah Buschel shoots the
film beautifully in a slightly green
ish palette resembling the glass of
the minibar bottles of Tanqueray
that Rosow gulps down with alarm
ing frequency. Shuffling and
squinting, half-smiling, Rosow
winds his way south through
California and the seedy nightlife of
Los Angeles and eventually to
Tijuana, where it appears that his
mysterious employers are not what
they seemed, and that the "missing
person" he has been tailing may be
the victim rather than the faulted
criminal. The film multiplies in
complexity as he is drugged, beat
en, kidnapped and put back out on
the case again for more money.
For fear of spoiling the later
developments, and the scarily mun
dane motivations of Rosow's
employers, I'll end the description
here. Suffice it to say that "The
Missing Person" is no less than a
"Sunset Boulevard," a "Double
Indemnity" or a "Maltese Falcon" of

our time, set in an America where
everyone is running away from the
events of a September morning
nearly seven-and-a-half years ago.
The seediness of the private eyes and
their nightlife scenes and their dan
gerous women has not changed —
neither has the gin or the wayward
goose-chases. And what has changed
isn't the power of money, but its uses
and the scarred souls of the people
who throw it around.
"Rudo y Cursi"
Directed by Carlos Cuaron,
"Rudo y Cursi" represents the finest
piece of Mexican cinema since the
director's brother, Alfonso Cuaron,
brought us "Y Tu Mama Tambien."
Executed in a similar style, but
altogether different in content and
spirit, "Rudo y Cursi" is a comic
movie about futbol with a dark
and seedy undercurrent, a film
about two brothers and the delu
sions brought on by their fame.
The two leads, Gael Garcia Bernal
and Diego Luna, brought together
here for the first time since "Y Tu
Mama," are rural banana farmers
that play soccer every day on the
dirt field in their village — Tato
(Bernal) as striker, and Beto (Luna)
as goalie.
One day, a big-shot talent scout
has his car break down in the vil-

lage, and spots the talent in the two
brothers. He can only take one,
though, and the matter is decided
accidentally in Tato's favor by a
penalty kick and Beto's mixing up
his left and his right. Taken up to
the big leagues, Tato quickly
becomcs a star and is given the nick
name Cursi. Soon an opening comes
up for a goalie and Beto makes it to
big time too, nicknamed Rudo.
Cursi soon has everything he wants
— cars, a television star girlfriend,
fame — while Rudo spends his new
found wealth on gambling and
cocaine. Eventually, both self
destruct, and the three lives —
Rudo's, Cursi's and the talent agent's
— come to a point of decision at
another penalty kick, in a game

Rudo has agreed to throw in order
to pay off his debts.
The film resonates with satire
of contemporary Mexican society,
with a near-Biblical expression of
the power of sibling rivalry and a
caution to follow one's given talent.
Cuaron's script bubbles with dry
wit and simultaneous dramatic
power. The director's decision to
focus on shots of the fans and
interested parties reacting to the
developments on the field — rather
than the soccer itself — results in a
supremely tense and draining film.
