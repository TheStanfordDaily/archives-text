States may gain power over emissions
standards
President Barack Obama is poised to let California and
other states set their own auto emission standards in their
drive to slash greenhouse gases, an official familiar with the
decision said Sunday.
The move is significant on two fronts: It could empower
states to set tougher standards in targeting emissions, which
are blamed for contributing to global climate change; and it
would be another swift reversal by Obama of Bush adminis
tration policy, this time on energy.
Iraq to reopen notorious Abu Ghraib prison
Iraq will reopen the notorious Abu Ghraib prison next
month,but it's getting a facelift and a new name, a senior jus
tice official said Saturday.
The heavily fortified compound of gray, stonewalled
buildings and watchtowers has come to symbolize American
abuse of some prisoners captured in Iraq after photos were
released showing US. soldiers sexually humiliating inmates
at the facility.
The renovated facility will be called Baghdad's Central
Prison because the name Abu Ghraib has left a "bitter feel
ing inside Iraqis' hearts," deputy Justice Minister Busho
Ibrahim said.
Bolivians back new, pro-indigenous constitution
Bolivian voters embraced a new constitution Sunday that
promises more power for the poor indigenous majority and
grants leftist President Hvo Morales a shot at remaining in
office through 2014.
But the charter's low support in Bolivia's lowland east
which controls much of the nation's wealth and fiercely op
poses Morales' plans to empower long-suffering highland
Indians â€” leaves the racially torn country as divided as
ever.
Its passage nevertheless marked a historic transition in a
nation where the oldest voters can still recall when Indians
were forbidden to vote.
