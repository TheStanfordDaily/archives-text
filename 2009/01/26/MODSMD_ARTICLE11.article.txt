## Editorial Public ASSU election financing laudable, but too pricey 
### 
As wc revel in the prospect of a new
era in American politics, we must not
forget that the 2008 election was the
most expensive electoral exercise in this na
tion's four-century history. The hundreds of
millions of dollars pumped into the race
should stand as a stark reminder of the
leverage connected to financial clout.
Hereon the Farm, our electoral process is
similarly affected hv the power of money.
Last year's ASSU elections exemplify this
point. While only a few senate candidates ac
tually spent more than $100 on their race,
the executive race was a good,old-fashioned
financial free-for-all.
Not including the fallacious $2,000 listed
by Barrack Obamma 'OS, the six slates spent
over $10,000 dollars on the election. What
should come as little surprise to any casual
follower of politics is that the amount each
slate spent came extraordinarily close in
predicting its electoral success.
The top two slates, Dorsey-Harris and
Go-Go Gobaud Goldgof. shelled out close
to $7,500 combined, financially dwarfing the
amounts spent by the third- and fourth
place finishers, Doshi-Hon ($1,834.14) and
Sharma-Cackler ($1,265.33). While a very
successful argument can be made that our
current executives were elected based on
their mass appeal and clarity of vision,
money also ruled the day last spring.
Given the critical role money has played
in past elections, the editorial board applauds
the current executives for supporting cam
paign finance reform. Fagan Harris summed
up his position eloquently at last week's sen
ate meeting, decrying the inherent inequity
that now plagues the system. Indeed,running
as an executive slate requires financial capi
tal many students do not possess.
I"he plan currently being floated by the

executives and the current elections com
missioner, however, will do little to halt Ihe
sizeable infusion of funds into our elections.
The plan on the table, also discussed at last
week's meeting, calls for a voluntary opt-in
program that will have the ASSU, and thus
students, subsidize campaigns for up to $750.
This well-intentioned plan sadly has far
too many flaws to make it a worthwhile en
deavor. Given that the fourth-place finisher
in last year's elections spent nearly double
the amount, $750 will in no way even the
electoral playing field. Sadly, for public fi
nancing to be actually successful, the dollar
amount should be closer to $1,750, not $750.
In addition, there are currently no pro
scribed means of paying for the plan at a
time when the ASSU is faced with tight fi
nances. While public financing is a laudable
goal, perhaps the ASSU should wait until
the economic crisis passes.
Other options exist, and should be ex
plored. though there seems not to be a single
cure-all for our problems. Perhaps public fi
nancing could be put on the special fees bal
lot — allowing students to decide whether
to support the initiative — so that the fund
ing would not be shifted away from other
initiatives or student groups.
Regardless of what plan is ultimately un
dertaken. we need to take a hard look at our
key goals for student life. While making com
petitive elections accessible to all is a noble
endeavor, in a time where student services
are taking a major hit. spending several
grand on T-shirts is not the best prioritization
of student funds. We hope that the ASSU
continues dialogue on this issue and explores
potential options for campaign finance re
form. We expect them to do so with the
greater public good in mind, both in terms of
political efficacy and fiscal responsibility.
