## Allysia Finley California: Golden no longer 
### 
Talk about a dysfunctional state. If
you thought your home state had
problems, perhaps you haven't lived
in California long enough. California cur
rently has the worst credit rating of any
state in the US. It has the third-highest un
employment rate in the nation. According
to the Governor's office, its debt is increas
ing at the rate of $1.7 million per hour. And
it has no leadership. Governor
Schwarzenegger and the Democratic legis
lature are perennially at loggerheads,
which doesn't make much sense since
they're flip sides of a one-sided coin. Both
are donkey tails.
Two weeks ago. the state controller an
nounced that the state may have to issue
promissory notes — a fancy name for
lOUs — to businesses and taxpayers, be
cause it cannot afford tax refunds. Local
governments and students receiving grants
from the California Student Aid Commis
sion may also find themselves receiving
lOUs. It's the best alternative to a lump of
coal in your mailbox.
California court-appointed lawyers,
judges, legislators and their staff may not
get paid either. Considering that legislators
don't seem to do much besides quibble
over how to best disguise a tax increase,
they don't deserve more than a lump of
coal. While this may sound ridiculously bit
ter and cynical, California's situation is
ridiculous, if not plain pathetic.
Its deficit is projected to reach $41.6 bil
lion by the middle of next year, according
toThe Los Angeles Times. And the best the
Democratic legislature could muster up
was $7.3 billion in spending cuts and $9.3
billion in tax increases. This was without
the support of Republicans who refuse to
sign onto the Democrats' sham budget,
which violates the California constitution
al requirement that a two-thirds majority
approve tax increases. The Democrats
called their illegal plan "innovative" and
"creative" toThe Times. Nice euphemisms.
Next time you get caught speeding or
rolling a stop sign, perhaps you should try
telling the police officer that you weren't
doing anything illegal. You were just driv
ing creatively.
The least the Democrats could have
done was make spending cuts equal tax in
creases. But that would have required
them to offend their cherished union con
stituencies and donors. The California De
mocrats' motto: We'll hurt taxpayers be

fore we hurt unions.
Meanwhile. Gov. Schwarzenegger has
been his same old capricious self, support
ing the Democrats' budget before he de
cided to oppose it on the grounds that the
legislature didn't make enough spending
cuts, open construction projects to'private
contractors or relax environmental laws
(of course, he had earlier supported many
of these environmental laws). But
Schwarzenegger is only part of the prob
lem. not the solution. Under Schwarzeneg
ger. spending has increased by 40 percent,
according Investors Business Daily, even
though he was voted into office on his
promise to cut spending.
And two weeks ago. Schwarzenegger fi
nally came out against the budget because
of the tax increases. Maybe Californian
Republicans gave him a smack-down,
telling him that he had better shape up, or
else "hasta la vista, baby." Or perhaps he fi
nally realized that California's system of
tax,spend and borrow is bankrupt. Accord
ing to the Governor's Budget, the top one
percent of Californians pay 4K percent of
income taxes. Taxing the wealthy even
more is just going to drive more businesses
and wealth out of the state. Yet increasing
regressive taxes like the sale tax won't go
over well with the middle class. And with
debt up to its ears, the state can't borrow
any more. As Schwarzenegger aptly noted
to The London Times, California is facing
"financial Armageddon."
In such dire straits, there's only one
thing left to do. Plead to Uncle Sam for a
bail-out. or if you prefer euphemisms, a
stimulus package. Schwarzenegger has
proposed other solutions like cutting five
days from every school year and putting
government workers on unpaid furlough.
But he hasn't gotten the legislature to
agree to many of his ideas. Maybe the ideas
are just not innovative or creative enough.
Ultimately, all of this budget finagling
was just an attempt to buy time until
Obama became president. In his speech at
George Mason University, Obama an
nounced that "we'll help struggling states
avoid harmful budget cuts."The legislature
and the governor are just crossing their fin
gers that Obama will keep his word.
And why shouldn't he? If bankrupt, dys
functional companies can get bailed-out,
why not bankrupt, dysfunctional states?
