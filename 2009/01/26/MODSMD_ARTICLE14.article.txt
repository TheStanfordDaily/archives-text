# Executive Experiences
## Come together, right now 
### 
This column originally ran on Nov. //, 2008.
Let me tell you about the collegiate so
cial scene at Northwestern, where I
started my college career. A zero-toler
ance alcohol policy dissuaded most student
groups from throwing parties.The few parties
that did happen were held by fraternities.To
prevent overcrowding, guests needed to be
invited personally.
The rest of us plebes had to content our
selves by partying behind closed doors,or by
carting off to random sketchy bars in town. It
was so awesome that 1 transferred.
My first weeks at Stanford were a breath
of fresh air. The first Saturday night after
classes started, some friends and I were
walking down the Row, where a number of
houses had their doors open. Everywhere we
went, groups of people were hanging out,
and they invited us to join them.
This was everything I wanted in a social
scene: fun, inclusive and diverse.There was a
plethora of social events happening simulta
neously, and I floated between them, en
countering a cross-section of campus in the
process. Finally. I was at a university where
students actually partied as a community.
Two years later. I am a veritable Julius
Caesar, stabbed in the heart by the advent of
increasingly strident party policies here.
Suddenly, every get-together "needs" more
security guards than Fort Knox, and every
party is a fire hazard due to perceived over
crowding. Houses get in trouble for throwing
parties, which deincentivizes them from
doing so again in the future. Then there are
fewer parties, and — guess what? — they're

even more crowded than before. In fact,
they're so crowded that not even all of the
people at these parties are our own.
Dear Palo Alto I ligh School students: We
don't want you here past your bedtime. As a
94301-native myself. I insist that you spend
your post-adolescent weekend nights just
the way I did — hanging out with that dude
who makes the balloon hats at Pizza My
Heart. XOXO. Jenna "Big Guns" Reback.
1 understand and respect the rationale of
the Univesity's increasingly strict party poli
cies. If someone gets injured or ill as the re
sult of excessive alcohol consumption at one
of these overcrowded parties, it is the Uni
versity. not the individual, that stands to be
victim to a massive lawsuit — and. in a flash,
there goes your free T-shirt money (and our
reputation). The ante only gets upped if the
"someone" in question is a rando who could
potentially harm real Stanford students, or
themselves.
That being said, I'm worried that we're
headed in the direction of Northwestern,
where hosting more than four people in a
room, even if no one is drinking, constitutes
an illegal party. Et tu. Brute?
The road to party hell — or. at least, to a
severe degradation in the quality of campus
life — is paved with the University's good
intentions — our safety is top priority. But
the admirable goals that guide these new
policies are negatively impacting this cam
pus, and 1 fear the worst is yet to come.
It's no surprise that already there are far
fewer parties on campus this year than last.
And whenever there is an all-campus party,
people swarm it. Not only does this increase

the risk of a negative incident, but it makes it
a lot easier for high-schoolers driving
around in their moms' Volvos to find us. too.
So what happens if you choose not to go
to the one party being thrown on any given
weekend, or if there isn't even an all-campus
party being thrown? You end up sitting
around in your lounge with the same 10 peo
ple you see every day.That sure is the kind of
horizon-expanding experience that drew me
here.
On the other hand, maybe you and your
10 friends decide that you're going to find a
party, but you're not sure you'll be able to get
a drink there. You each pound a few shots
before heading out. thereby saluting Stan
ford's new social policies for helping you
make healthy decisions.
Stanford affords a wide variety of forums
in which we can come together as a commu
nity — sports events, theatrical performanc
es and so,on — but I'd like to know whatev
er happened to good old unstructured fun.
I'm not arguing that we need more all-cam
pus parties because I have a lot of free time,
or because I'm a particularly big drinker
(quite the contrary). But. 1 feel strongly that
Stanford's current party policies are anti
thetical to the spirit we try to foster on this
campus.
"TTie right to party seems frivolous, but it
impacts the way we interact with each other
and the way we celebrate our school. We de
serve to enjoy ourselves while enjoying each
other's company.
