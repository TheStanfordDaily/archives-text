## THE 						BEAVERS DAMMED Card women overtake OSU, 69-54 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY DESK EDITOR 
In what has practically become rou
tine. the "Jayne Appel Show" continued
on Saturday night, as No. 11 Stanford's
junior center recorded her l()th double
double of the year to lead the Cardinal to
a 69-54 victory over a gritty Oregon State
squad.
Coming off another double-double
Thursday night against Oregon. Appel
led all piayers with 18 points and 12 re
bounds. and came alive in the second half
to spark a Stanford comeback. Indeed,
the Cardinal found itself in an unfamiliar
position, trailing an overmatched
Beavers team by a point at halftime.
Even when Stanford (15-4,6-1 Pacific-10
Conference) opened up an eight-point
lead near the start of the second half,
Oregon State (11-7.2-6) was able to rally
and prevent the Cardinal from pulling
away, and with just over lOminutesleft in
the contest, the Beavers were able to tie
the score.
But Stanford took over from there —
a 19-2 run put the game out of reach, as
the defense clamped down with an array
of steals, blocks and forced turnovers.
"We went into a little bit of a trap, just
to change our defense up a little bit."
Cardinal coach Tara VanDerveer said.
"We made some shots, and we had some
good stops, and that was key. Our team is
working hard on defense; 1 was really
pleased with that."
"I thought my team played really hard
for 35 minutes of the game," Beavers
coach LaVonda Wagner said.
The defensive performance in the sec
ond half forced Oregon State into a num
ber of unenviable scoring situations —
the Beavers shot only 32.3 percent in the
final 20 minutes.as opposed to 50 percent
in the first half.
But Oregon State had been able to
make life difficult for Stanford through
out the first 30 minutes of play. The Car
dinal was able to open up a 14-7 lead to
start the game, but the Beavers were able
to knot up the score at 20 apiece, and
Oregon State went into the locker room
at halftime leading 28-27.
The Beavers found success by spread
ing the ball around on offense, working it
through both their guards and posts to
find the basket. While the Cardinal was
able to largely stymie Talisa Rhea.OSU's
leading scorer, the squad had trouble
with sophomore Alex Mitchell, a usual
starting forward, but a reserve in Satur
day's contest. Mitchell led the Beavers
with 14 points on 6-11 shooting.
But Mitchell, along with forward
Kirsten Tilleman and center Tiffany
Ducker. got into foul trouble in the sec
ond half, which allowed Appel and for
wards freshman Nnemkadi Ogwumike
and sophomore Kayla Pedersen to take
over the post, while senior forward Jil-

GAME NOTES: The Stanford women's basketball
team handily defeated Oregon State Saturday
night. Junior Jayne Appel put up a game-high 18
points and 12 rebounds, leading the Cardinal
post to shoot nearly 70 percent in the contest.

lian Harmon contributed from the wing.
"Nnemkadi came off the bench for us
and really did a lot; she scored, rebound
ed and she was just a real spark for us,"
VanDerveer said. "Jillian also made
some big layups for us when we needed
them."
In total, five Cardinal players reached
double digits, as VanDerveer used a
shorter bench than usual — her starters,
along with Ogwumike, played the vast
majority of the game.Those that did play
made good use of their time on the court
— the team's four posts. Appel, Ogwu
mike. Pedersen and freshman Sarah
Boothe shot nearly 70 percent from the
field.
The forwards and posts also spread
the ball amongst each other, with Har
mon. Appel and Pedersen each register
ing four assists to lead the team, and Og
wumike adding three of her own. It all
added up to an offensive performance
that relied not on the outside shot, which
Stanford has sometimes resorted to. but
instead on physical play down low.
"They are big and they play really
tough." Wagner said.
For the Beavers, the weekend homes
tand against Stanford and No. 6 Cal
proved fruitful, even though they ulti
mately emerged winless. Oregon State
offered the Cardinal stiff competition,
and lost bv only five to the Golden Bears.
For a team that was 12-19 and finished in
a tie for last place in the Pac-10 confer
ence last season, that's progress.
"It definitely shows that we can play
with anybody if we run our plays and get
stops, and we do the things we are sup
posed to be doing," said Oregon State
guard Mercedes Fox-Griffin, who fin
ished with nine points. "If we do that we
can match up against anybody. We just
need to close out games, that is the most
important thing." Stanford will next see
action at home on Thursday against USC
and then again on Saturday against
UCLA, as the Cardinal's Pac-10 sched
ule nears its midway point.
