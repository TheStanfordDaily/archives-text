end. first taking a 156-99 victory over Arizona
State on Friday, and then dominating defend
ing national champion No. 4 Arizona on Satur
day afternoon by a score of 191-107. Given
that the team was swimming on little rest and
coming off of a period of heavy training, the
Cardinal put up some incredible times in both
meets.
Senior captain Jason Dunford and junior
Eugene Godsoe each won two individual
events on Friday — Dunford took the 200 free
in 1:39.38 and the 200 fly in 1:49.62, while God

48.22, and won the 1 (X) free in 45.29.

showdown with the talent-laden Wildcats. In
the end. though, the Cardinal outmatched the
Arizona squad (3-2, 2-2 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) to stay a perfect 5-0 for the season, and
3-0 in the Pac-10.
Stanford started off by winning the 400-
vard medley relay in 3:08.40. good for an
NCAA B' standard time. The relay consisted

tain Paul Kornfeld in breaststroke.sophomore
Austin Staab in fly. and Dunford in free. God
soe, Staab and Dunford each nearly replicated
their splits from the NCAA Championship
last year. The team felt that this explosive be
ginning was critical for its overall success on
the day.
"We all knew that that first relay would set
the tone for the meet." Godsoe said. "Getting
that first relay off to a good start really helped
carry us through the meet."

"Momentum is a huge factor," Kornfeld
agreed. "Once it gets rolling, it helps us keep
improving."
Improve Stanford did. posting the fastest
times in all 12 individual events. Dunford said
he believes that the sheer number of Stanford
triumphs caught Arizona by surprise.
"We just turned out ready to race," Dun
ford said. "They didn't have any idea of the
sort of depth we have in our team. This gives us

a huge amount of confidence — it was incred
ible."
Godsoe agreed, saying that the confidence
was tangible for swimmers in subsequent
events.
"Every event, I knew I would look over and
one of our guys would touch the wall first,"
said Godsoe."From the freshmen to the senior
