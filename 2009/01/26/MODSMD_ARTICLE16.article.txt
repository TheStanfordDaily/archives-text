### KENAN JIANG CHRISTIAN L. TOM STAFF WRITERS 
The No. 2 Stanford men's swim team won a

end. first taking a 156-99 victory over Arizona
State on Friday, and then dominating defend
ing national champion No. 4 Arizona on Satur
day afternoon by a score of 191-107. Given
that the team was swimming on little rest and
coming off of a period of heavy training, the
Cardinal put up some incredible times in both
meets.
Senior captain Jason Dunford and junior
Eugene Godsoe each won two individual
events on Friday — Dunford took the 200 free
in 1:39.38 and the 200 fly in 1:49.62, while God
soe swam to an easy victory in the 100 back in
48.22, and won the 1 (X) free in 45.29.
Traveling to defending champions Arizona
the next day. Stanford was prepared for a
showdown with the talent-laden Wildcats. In
the end. though, the Cardinal outmatched the
Arizona squad (3-2, 2-2 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) to stay a perfect 5-0 for the season, and
3-0 in the Pac-10.
Stanford started off by winning the 400-
vard medley relay in 3:08.40. good for an
NCAA B' standard time. The relay consisted
of Godsoe at leadoff backstroke, senior cap
tain Paul Kornfeld in breaststroke.sophomore
Austin Staab in fly. and Dunford in free. God
soe, Staab and Dunford each nearly replicated
their splits from the NCAA Championship
last year. The team felt that this explosive be
ginning was critical for its overall success on
the day.
"We all knew that that first relay would set
the tone for the meet." Godsoe said. "Getting
that first relay off to a good start really helped
carry us through the meet."

"Momentum is a huge factor," Kornfeld
agreed. "Once it gets rolling, it helps us keep
improving."
Improve Stanford did. posting the fastest
times in all 12 individual events. Dunford said
he believes that the sheer number of Stanford
triumphs caught Arizona by surprise.
"We just turned out ready to race," Dun
ford said. "They didn't have any idea of the
sort of depth we have in our team. This gives us

a huge amount of confidence — it was incred
ible."
Godsoe agreed, saying that the confidence
was tangible for swimmers in subsequent
events.
"Every event, I knew I would look over and
one of our guys would touch the wall first,"
said Godsoe."From the freshmen to the senior

to go so fast in-season. when we're
tired and we've had all this tough
training," Staab said. "We're really
excited about what's to come. If right
now we're nearly as fast as last year,
it kind of makes you think, "Where
am I going to be at the end of this
season?'"
Dunford agreed, saying that the
season was a building process.
"We want to build off this into the
next three dual meets after this, then
into Pac-lOs," he said. "The end goal
is always in sight, and right now, it
seems we are on the right track."
Next up for the Cardinal are Cal

meet as senior Dwight Dumais fin

meter events, with scores of 299.33
and 360.30, respectively.
The meet meant even more to the
Cardinal when seen as a marker for
the whole season.
"It was really awesome to be able
to go so fast in-season. when we're
tired and we've had all this tough
training," Staab said. "We're really
excited about what's to come. If right
now we're nearly as fast as last year,
it kind of makes you think, "Where
am I going to be at the end of this
season?'"
Dunford agreed, saying that the
season was a building process.
"We want to build off this into the
next three dual meets after this, then
into Pac-lOs," he said. "The end goal
is always in sight, and right now, it
seems we are on the right track."
Next up for the Cardinal are Cal
State Bakersfield and USC. who
Stanford will host at the Avery
Aquatic Center on Feb. 6 and 7.
