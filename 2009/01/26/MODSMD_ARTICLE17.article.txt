# Sunday's tale of two teams
## 
### 
Before we get started this week,
there are some things I should
go over with you, the reader:
Yes, this is a Super Bowl column.
No, I'm not apologizing for it. Why?
Because this is the last shining beacon
of sports before the dark. pre-Mareh
Madness abyss of February, and I'm
going to enjoy this last opportunity I
have.
Parenthetically, yes, I hate Febru
ary Asa month in the sports calendar,
it's roughly equivalent in entertain
ment value to watching Bob Costas
competing against Tom Cruise in a
slam-dunk competition — it's really
all about who swallows his pride first
and breaks out the step-ladder. It
seems like a clunky analogy until you
realize that you're playing the role of
Costas/Cruise, and you'll just have to
either keep coming up short in terms
of finding entertaining sports to
watch, or you'll have to stretch for
midseason NHL. NBA or college bas
ketball action.
But I've been over the woes of
February in previous years. That's
why this is a Super Bowl column, be
cause for so long there's going to be
so little else. For me, at least, the post
NFL season is one of waiting for
pitchers and catchers to report and
watching Stanford basketball while
waiting for the Madness of March.
And I'm not even a little ashamed of
it. And when you look at where this
NFL season has taken us, I don't
think you can blame me.
On Sunday, you'll see one fran
chise that's about as steeped in histo
ry as you can get. line Steelers are. in
a lot of ways, the dynasty that never
really died.They had a glorious run of
four Super Bowl Championships in
the 1970'5, and while the team fell off
in the' Bos and '90s, it was still compet
itive, winning a handful of division
championships and even appearing in
one Super Bowl against the Dallas
Cowboys in 19%.
Now. in this decade, the Steelers,
you may have noticed, are back.
They've already won one ring with
former head coach Bill Cowher and
current OB Ben "Hardest Name to
Spell in the NFL" Roethlisberger.and
now they're going for another with
Big Ben and second year head coach
Mike Tomlin. A win Sunday against
the Arizona Cardinals would make
the Steelers, by some standards, the
best franchise of the modern era, as
Pittsburgh would be the first fran
chise to achieve six Super Bowl
Championships.
And in this other corner, some
where in the desert, we have the
aforementioned Cards, who have suf
fered through one of the most futile
histories in all of professional sports.
We've seen Bad and Ugly, but rarely
any Good. Until now at least. When
the most openly religious. Cinderella
storied quarterback in all of football,
Kurt Warner, suddenly won a starting
job after fading back into obscurity
following his marvelous three-year
run with the Rams.
Making it all the better are the
personal tidbits surrounding the
game. Cardinals head coach Ken
Whisenhunt learned as an assistant in
Pittsburgh before migrating to Ari
zona — ditto for assistant head coach
Russ Grimm. Making matters more
interesting still is the rumored rift be
tween Roethlisberger and Whisen
hunt. Suffice to say there's a lot of his
tory between these two franchises.
And meanwhile, Warner, has led
the long-suffering Cardinals to the
promised land ... a franchise that
suffered the longest in St. Louis,
where Warner previously led the
slightly less suffering Rams to glory.
And if you don't think there's at least
a little bit of angst about that in St.
Louis, where Marc Bulger imploded
this year, then you probably aren't en
tirely aware of the fact that in some
places, Cardinals owner Bill Bidwell's
name is synonymous with absolute
ineptitude and failure.
Say what you want about Warner,
but if he wins this game, he will have
the coolest career of any pro-athlete
in this generation. Adapi the script of
the classic Robert Redford flick,"The
Natural," so that it stars a football
player rather than a pitcher-turned
right fielder and that's basically
Warner's story, except it happened
