GAME NOTES: The Stanford men's basketball
team dropped to 3-4 in conference play with a
loss to Oregon State on Saturday. The Card
shot only 24 percent from 3-point range and
turned the ball over 16 times, allowing the
Beavers to take an early 16-2 lead from which
Stanford never recovered.

New Oregon State head coaeh
Craig Robinson and company gave
Stanford an executive order to stay out
of the way on Saturday night in Maples
Pavilion. The Beavers opened the
game with a 16-2 run, and vetoed any
chance of a Cardinal comeback, finally
winning 77-62.
Less than a week after watching the
presidential inauguration of his broth
er-in-law. Barack Obama, Robinson
arrived in the Bay Area with an agenda
of his own: to hoist his team back into
Pacific-10 Conference contention.
And. like his brother-in-law, Robinson
used this week to take bold action
down a new path. The result? For the
first time since the 1992-1993 season,
the Beavers swept both California and
Stanford on their home floors.
"I think a lot of people get them
confused with the team from last year,
but that's not the case," senior guard
Anthony Goods said. "They're under a
new coach, they're binding to that sys
tem, and they're playing really well."
Based on Saturday's performance,
few people will continue to confuse the
Beavers (8-10, 3-5 Pac-10) with their
last year's selves, whose 0-18 confer
ence record left nowhere to go but up.
Now, with the same number of confer
ence wins as both Stanford and
Washington State, OSU has jumped
into the thick of mid-conference com
petition practically overnight.
Oregon State missed just one of its
first nine field goals. In shooting 62 per
cent from the tloor for the game, the
Beavers never quite seemed to cool
down. Stanford coach Johnny Dawkins
saluted the competitiveness and consis
tency of the Oregon State team, which

State. The Card fell flat against a 1-3-1 zone by the Beavers and went 8-33 from long range.
seemed to drain even the most un
likely of shots — like a fade-away
jumper at 17:40 by center Roeland
Schaftenaar, with no time left on the
shot clock.
"I thought that defensively, at
times we were putting on good pres
sure, and they just made tough
shots," Dawkins said. "As the game
goes on, of course you feel maybe
(they'll cool off]... I'd like to get on
my guys for not being in the right
place, but sometimes they were, and
[Oregon State] just hit the shot. So,
it's a tough night for us, but I think
[the Beavers] played really well."
Even more than Schaftenaar, who
posted 18 points and three steals,
sophomore guard Calvin Haynes led
the Beaver offense and all scorers
with a career-high 25 points. Junior
guard Seth Tarver chipped in with
another 19 points and six rebounds
— all this from players who don't
even rank among the conference's
top-20 scorers this season.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal offense
struggled with Oregon State's 1-3-1
zone defense, and had trouble
matching the Beavers' scoring pro
duction. In the ongoing game of
catch-up. even long-distance shoot
ing couldn't save the Card, and the
team went 8 for 33 from beyond the

arc, including 12 consecutive misses
to end the contest.
Goods, usually Stanford's leading
sharpshooter, went only 3 for 12
from long range, but still managed a
team-best 15 points. Perhaps more
noticeable was junior Landry Fields,
whose contribution of 12 points and
11 boards marked his second career
double-double.
"The first half, we were just stand
ing there too much," Goods said.
"We let their zone get us thinking
too much. We weren't contesting
their passing, and we weren't con
testing their offense effectively."
The biggest trouble.though.came
with Stanford's turnovers. The
Beavers turned the 16 Cardinal mis
takes into 23 points. In this respect.
Stanford sorely missed senior point
guard Mitch Johnson, who was out
for his second consecutive game
with a right calf strain. Goods,
though, said that the responsibility
should have shifted to the rest of the
team, but instead Stanford all-too
literally dropped the ball.
"It's always tough to play without
a senior leader like Mitch, but we
just didn't take care of the ball," he
said. "That was on everybody — it
wasn't just on the point guard, it was
one through five. Everybody had

their share of turnovers, and that's
what shot us in the foot."
Dawkins agreed about the team
sharing responsibility with Johnson
unavailable.
"Of course you miss him,"
Dawkins said of Johnson. "He's a
senior point guard, a four-year
starter in this program. His presence
would've been great. Unfortunately,
he couldn't play. So. for us, guys have
got to step up and make plays in his
absence, and that's what we were
looking for."
No one stepped in, though, leav
ing Stanford unable to cut a once 17-
point deficit to fewer than five at any
point in the second half. Unable to
make practically any defensive
stops, the Cardinal could at best
trade buckets, and allowed the
Beavers to run away with the game
for the last 11 minutes of play. In
short, a visibly disappointed Stan
ford squad was outplayed on its
home court.
"They played with more energy
and more confidence than we did."
Goods said. "They came out and
threw the first punch, and they
played tough for 40 minutes."
