GAME NOTES: The Stanford men's basketball
team dropped to 3-4 in conference play with a
loss to Oregon State on Saturday. The Card
shot only 24 percent from 3-point range and
turned the ball over 16 times, allowing the
Beavers to take an early 16-2 lead from which
Stanford never recovered.

New Oregon State head coaeh
Craig Robinson and company gave
Stanford an executive order to stay out
of the way on Saturday night in Maples
Pavilion. The Beavers opened the
game with a 16-2 run, and vetoed any
chance of a Cardinal comeback, finally
winning 77-62.
Less than a week after watching the
presidential inauguration of his broth
er-in-law. Barack Obama, Robinson
arrived in the Bay Area with an agenda
of his own: to hoist his team back into
Pacific-10 Conference contention.
And. like his brother-in-law, Robinson
used this week to take bold action
down a new path. The result? For the
first time since the 1992-1993 season,
the Beavers swept both California and
Stanford on their home floors.
"I think a lot of people get them
confused with the team from last year,
but that's not the case," senior guard
Anthony Goods said. "They're under a
new coach, they're binding to that sys
tem, and they're playing really well."
Based on Saturday's performance,
few people will continue to confuse the
Beavers (8-10, 3-5 Pac-10) with their
last year's selves, whose 0-18 confer
ence record left nowhere to go but up.
Now, with the same number of confer
ence wins as both Stanford and
Washington State, OSU has jumped
into the thick of mid-conference com
petition practically overnight.
Oregon State missed just one of its
first nine field goals. In shooting 62 per
cent from the tloor for the game, the
Beavers never quite seemed to cool
down. Stanford coach Johnny Dawkins
saluted the competitiveness and consis
tency of the Oregon State team, which

Senior Lawrence Hill added only eight points in Stanford's lackluster meeting with Oregon
State. The Card fell flat against a 1-3-1 zone by the Beavers and went 8-33 from long range.
