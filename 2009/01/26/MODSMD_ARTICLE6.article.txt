# Students give input on budget
## ASSU addresses program concerns at Town Hall 
### ZOE RICHARDS 
Students poured into Old Union for
the ASSU Town Hall on Friday evening,
armed with questions and concerns
regarding cuts in the University's gener
al funds budget. The meeting was the
first of a string of sessions that will allow
students to discuss and prioritize stu
dent programs, which may have to
shave costs in the coming months.
Although ASSU President Jonny
Dorsev '09 specifically said students
would not know "what's on the chop
ping block" for some time, students can
expect to see cuts to Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education (VPUE)
programs. Much of VPUE's funding is
provided through the endowment,
which is expected to fall 20 to 30 percent
by Sept. 1 of this year.
"Nothing will be insulated." Dorsey
and Vice President Fagan Harris '09
noted, as $100 million is cut over the
next two vears. However. ASSU

Financial Manager Matt McLaughlin
took the opportunity to address repre
sentatives from student groups present
that student group funding is securely
held in bonds and that special fees will
not face cuts insofar as they remain a
measure voted upon and paid for by
students.
With this clarification. Dorsey and
Harris stressed that the "student body
should speak clearly about what [its]
values are" in order to sustain other
aspects of the University that most
enrich the student experience. They
asked attendees to discuss with others
at the meeting their priorities and then
submit them on a provided index card
from which the ASSU executives will
develop a "consensus" in the time
before their Thursday meeting with
Provost John Etchemendy, who serves
as budgetary officer for the University.
"Let's hone out where we disagree "
