# Students give input on budget
## ASSU addresses program concerns at Town Hall 
### ZOE RICHARDS 
Students poured into Old Union for
the ASSU Town Hall on Friday evening,
armed with questions and concerns
regarding cuts in the University's gener
al funds budget. The meeting was the
first of a string of sessions that will allow
students to discuss and prioritize stu
dent programs, which may have to
shave costs in the coming months.
Although ASSU President Jonny
Dorsev '09 specifically said students
would not know "what's on the chop
ping block" for some time, students can
expect to see cuts to Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education (VPUE)
programs. Much of VPUE's funding is
provided through the endowment,
which is expected to fall 20 to 30 percent
by Sept. 1 of this year.
"Nothing will be insulated." Dorsey
and Vice President Fagan Harris '09
noted, as $100 million is cut over the
next two vears. However. ASSU

Financial Manager Matt McLaughlin
took the opportunity to address repre
sentatives from student groups present
that student group funding is securely
held in bonds and that special fees will
not face cuts insofar as they remain a
measure voted upon and paid for by
students.
With this clarification. Dorsey and
Harris stressed that the "student body
should speak clearly about what [its]
values are" in order to sustain other
aspects of the University that most
enrich the student experience. They
asked attendees to discuss with others
at the meeting their priorities and then
submit them on a provided index card
from which the ASSU executives will
develop a "consensus" in the time
before their Thursday meeting with
Provost John Etchemendy, who serves
as budgetary officer for the University.
"Let's hone out where we disagree "
Harris told the audience, adding that
students would be surprised by the
many areas in which they do agree.
Dorsey later told The Daily that
the intent of the town hall meetings,
which will likely be held weekly, is to
"share and hear as much from the
student body as possible."
The ASSIJ will act as a vehicle to
voice the concerns of students as
budgeting talks continue this
Thursday and after.The student gov
ernment has already named four
areas of priority for budget advocacy
— academics, wellness, community
centers and front-line staff — and
expects 'to add on to and further
define these in the coming days and
weeks.
To that end. Dorsey and Harris
encouraged concerned students to
contact their senate representatives
and share their opinions in one-on
one conversations with fellow stu
dents. This, according to Harris, will
allow the student body to build con
sensus and "do advocacy within the
levers we have."
"1 think we're all more on the
same page now about collective
organizing," said Li la Kalaf '10, co
chair ofASSU Health Initiatives, in
response to the large turnout —
over 100 students — on Friday. "1
am inspired."
Equally amazed by the number
of students that participated in a
truly sobering Friday evening event.
Dorsey described the excitement of
seeing the student body and the
ASSU work together to take posi
tive action.
"It's a difficult time now." noted
attendee Jack Cackler *09,"but diffi
cult times are where we grow the
most."
The ASSU executives agreed that
the University is reluctant to make
budget cuts, and drove home the
point that "no one is intent on mak
ing euts Uo anything." Harris
explained that along these same
lines, the Board of Trustees is intent
on securing the University for years
down the line, and securing its place
as an elite institution.
Sarahi Constantine '11 was satis
fied with the meeting.
"It's great to have a forum to tell
your execs what you feel." she said.
"To ask a question and get a

response is the ultimate reward."
Dorsey and Harris will meet with
Etchemendy, as well as Vice Provost
for Budget and Auxiliaries
Management Tim Warner and the
Budget Committee, this Thursday to
discuss areas of priority, as well as
those with potential for cutting.
"It is easy to feel powerless right
now because we are not the ones
signing the check," Harris said.
He added that students are the
critical mass, and student voices are
of utmost importance.
Perhaps most frustrating to stu
dents who are trying to come up
with resourceful strategies to save
the University money is the ear
marked dollars that cannot he
reshuffled or re-designated to val
ued areas of student life. Pointing
out the palm trees as a "brand" of
the University. Dorsey addressed the
concerns of students who felt that
that such an indulgence should be
reduced in order to maintain more
crucial aspects of the school's
appeal.
Other students present raised
concerns over initiatives such as
mental health, graduate student and

faculty diversity and fair wages for
workers, but the executives assured
that they would work to maintain
the values of the student community
while facing the realities of the econ
omy.
A teleconference during the town
hall with Marshall Ganz, professor
at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government and and experienced
community organizer from the civil
rights movement and the United
Farm Workers of America, sought to
give students a road map for organ
izing. Ganz urged students to figure
out whom is in power and utilize
connections in voicing concerns.
In the end. Dorsey called the
meeting a "coup" because he and
Harris could not do collective organ
izing alone. Rather, it must be done
with the support of fellow students.
"'Hie budget is tight." I larris said,
"but our capacity to give as individ
uals is infinite."

"share and hear as much from the
student body as possible."
The ASSIJ will act as a vehicle to
voice the concerns of students as
budgeting talks continue this
Thursday and after.The student gov
ernment has already named four
areas of priority for budget advocacy
— academics, wellness, community
centers and front-line staff — and
expects 'to add on to and further
define these in the coming days and
weeks.
To that end. Dorsey and Harris
encouraged concerned students to
contact their senate representatives
and share their opinions in one-on
one conversations with fellow stu
dents. This, according to Harris, will
allow the student body to build con
sensus and "do advocacy within the
levers we have."
"1 think we're all more on the
same page now about collective
organizing," said Li la Kalaf '10, co
chair ofASSU Health Initiatives, in
response to the large turnout —
over 100 students — on Friday. "1
am inspired."
Equally amazed by the number
of students that participated in a
truly sobering Friday evening event.
Dorsey described the excitement of
seeing the student body and the
ASSU work together to take posi
tive action.
"It's a difficult time now." noted
attendee Jack Cackler *09,"but diffi
cult times are where we grow the
most."
The ASSU executives agreed that
the University is reluctant to make
budget cuts, and drove home the
point that "no one is intent on mak
ing euts Uo anything." Harris
explained that along these same
lines, the Board of Trustees is intent
on securing the University for years
down the line, and securing its place
as an elite institution.
Sarahi Constantine '11 was satis
fied with the meeting.
"It's great to have a forum to tell
your execs what you feel." she said.
"To ask a question and get a

response is the ultimate reward."
Dorsey and Harris will meet with
Etchemendy, as well as Vice Provost
for Budget and Auxiliaries
Management Tim Warner and the
Budget Committee, this Thursday to
discuss areas of priority, as well as
those with potential for cutting.
"It is easy to feel powerless right
now because we are not the ones
signing the check," Harris said.
He added that students are the
critical mass, and student voices are
of utmost importance.
Perhaps most frustrating to stu
dents who are trying to come up
with resourceful strategies to save
the University money is the ear
marked dollars that cannot he
reshuffled or re-designated to val
ued areas of student life. Pointing
out the palm trees as a "brand" of
the University. Dorsey addressed the
concerns of students who felt that
that such an indulgence should be
reduced in order to maintain more
crucial aspects of the school's
appeal.
Other students present raised
concerns over initiatives such as
mental health, graduate student and

faculty diversity and fair wages for
workers, but the executives assured
that they would work to maintain
the values of the student community
while facing the realities of the econ
omy.
A teleconference during the town
hall with Marshall Ganz, professor
at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government and and experienced
community organizer from the civil
rights movement and the United
Farm Workers of America, sought to
give students a road map for organ
izing. Ganz urged students to figure
out whom is in power and utilize
connections in voicing concerns.
In the end. Dorsey called the
meeting a "coup" because he and
Harris could not do collective organ
izing alone. Rather, it must be done
with the support of fellow students.
"'Hie budget is tight." I larris said,
"but our capacity to give as individ
uals is infinite."
