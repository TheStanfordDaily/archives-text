## Univ. safe from housing crunch Professors discuss impact of economic crisis on their homes 
### THOMAS YEH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
National housing prices have been reported at
record lows this past month, marking their greatest
drop in at least 18 years, according to various gov
ernment reports. In light of the ongoing housing
slump, university faculty living in and around
Stanford have speculated on the impact national
trends may have on their own housing circum
stances.

For Nir Jaimovich.
assistant professor in *
economics, mapping the
national housing trend a

is simple.
"We just look
up the Case-Shiller 4
index." Jaimovich
said. "That's what
people usually use
for housing prices."

The Case-Shiller Home

Price Index, a number CRIS BAUTISTA/
calculated quarterly from The Stanford Daily
data collected on the
repeat sales of single-family homes in the United
States, tracks historical housing prices relative to
the base year 2000. After reaching an all-time high
in 2006, the index has declined every quarter since,
with the recent statistic for December 2008 record
ed as the largest-ever year-to-year drop.
But what does this mean for the faculty living at
Stanford?
According to Betty Oen. associate director of
Stanford Faculty Staff Housing (FSH), "the houses
on campus track pretty much the market of similar
houses in the immediate area off campus."
However, regardless of its association with the
University, the land around Stanford and Palo Alto
has in fact experienced a noticeable amount of
insulation from these broader national trends.
"The Case-Shiller index is based only on certain
urban areas, and the real estate market around
Stanford is very different than around anywhere
else." said Assistant Professor of Economics Jakub
Kastl. "The land is so valuable here that the slump
of the housing market hasn't been as severe as it has
been in sav. Sacramento, or even East Palo Alto.
