## Univ. safe from housing crunch Professors discuss impact of economic crisis on their homes 
### THOMAS YEH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
National housing prices have been reported at
record lows this past month, marking their greatest
drop in at least 18 years, according to various gov
ernment reports. In light of the ongoing housing
slump, university faculty living in and around
Stanford have speculated on the impact national
trends may have on their own housing circum
stances.

For Nir Jaimovich.
assistant professor in *
economics, mapping the
national housing trend a

is simple.
"We just look
up the Case-Shiller 4
index." Jaimovich
said. "That's what
people usually use
for housing prices."

The Case-Shiller Home

Price Index, a number CRIS BAUTISTA/
calculated quarterly from The Stanford Daily
data collected on the
repeat sales of single-family homes in the United
States, tracks historical housing prices relative to
the base year 2000. After reaching an all-time high
in 2006, the index has declined every quarter since,
with the recent statistic for December 2008 record
ed as the largest-ever year-to-year drop.
But what does this mean for the faculty living at
Stanford?
According to Betty Oen. associate director of
Stanford Faculty Staff Housing (FSH), "the houses
on campus track pretty much the market of similar
houses in the immediate area off campus."
However, regardless of its association with the
University, the land around Stanford and Palo Alto
has in fact experienced a noticeable amount of
insulation from these broader national trends.
"The Case-Shiller index is based only on certain
urban areas, and the real estate market around
Stanford is very different than around anywhere
else." said Assistant Professor of Economics Jakub
Kastl. "The land is so valuable here that the slump
of the housing market hasn't been as severe as it has
been in sav. Sacramento, or even East Palo Alto.

Around Stanford, the supply is fairly
fixed, so even if the demand does
decline, there's not going to be much
downward movement in price."
Wendy Mao. an assistant profes
sor in geological and environmental
sciences, is very content with the
condo she bought off campus in a
new Palo Alto housing develop
ment.
"In the present market, I'm
relieved to have bought in Palo Alto,
since the prices do not seem to have
fallen at all," Mao said."lt seems like
the great public schools have kept
the demand up in my area."
"My friends in Mountain View do
not seem so fortunate," she added.
"The current low interests rates are
also a big plus, since I am now refi
nancing my place, and I should be
able to get an almost two percent cut
in my rate."
Stanford FSH reports about 30
percent of active faculty live on cam
pus. opting for houses and apart
ments in Residential Subdivision, an
area bordered by Junipero Serra
Boulevard. Campus Drive and Page

Mill Road. For Mao. the decision to
live off campus involved a careful
consideration of the pros and cons
associated with these properties.
"Mv No. 1 consideration during
my housing search was proximity to
the University, so I definitely consid
ered living on campus," Mao said.
"There were not that many on-cam
pus offerings during the time I was
looking, and while the housing on
campus is less expensive than a com
parable property just outside the
University, there is also a smaller
group of prospective buyers, and
people were telling me the houses
appreciate less."
The current price cushion offered
in certain areas around Stanford
bears good news for residents like
Mao, but reflects just the opposite
for those who have attempted to
move in.
After earning her PhD at the
University of Southern California.
Maria Ogneva joined the Graduate
School of Business in 200K as an
assistant professor of accounting, but
was unable to find affordable hous
ing nearby. She is currently renting a
house in Cupertino.
"I was planning to buy a house
close to campus, but even in the cur
rent market downturn, houses in
good school districts are not afford

able," Ogneva said. "1 still have to
save several years for the down pay
ment given the housing prices
around campus."
