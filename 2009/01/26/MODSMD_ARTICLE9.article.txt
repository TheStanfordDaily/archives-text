Instantly opening a rift among New
York Democrats, Rep. Kirsten Gilli
brand — a little-known, pro-gun Demo
crat from a rural Republican district —
won appointment Friday to the Senate
seat left vacant by Hillary Rodham Clin
ton.
Gov. David Paterson announced his
choice a day after presumed front-run
ner Caroline Kennedy — a woman with
considerably more star power but less
experience — mysteriously dropped out
of contention in an embarrassing turn of
events that touched off sniping between
the governor and the Kennedy camp.
Gillibrand, at 42, will be the youngest
member of the Senate and one of 17
women in the chamber.The second-term
congresswoman will assume the seat
once held by Kennedy's uncle Robert F.
Kennedy as well as by Daniel Patrick
Moynihan.
"For many in New York state, this is
the first time you've heard my name and
you don't know much about me," said
Gillibrand (pronounced JILL-ih
brand). '"Over the next two years, you
will get to know me. And. more impor
tantly. I will get to know you."
Before the governor even took the
podium to introduce Gillibrand. anti
gun crusader Rep. Carolyn McCarthy
said she would challenge Gillibrand in
the Democratic primary next year, or
find someone who would. Gillibrand has
a 100 percent voting record with the Na
tional Rifle Association.
McCarthy, a Long Island Democrat
who ran for Congress after her husband
was shot to death and her son wounded
in the 1993 Long Island Rail Road mas
sacre. said someone with such a record
should not be the next senator from New
York.
"The majority of New Yorkers be
lieve in trying to reduce gun violence."

she said.
Her complaint was echoed by New
York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, a De
mocrat-turned-Republican-turned-in-
dependent who has been one of the na
tion's most vocal gun control advocates.
In a statement, the mayor noted his
"strong disagreement with one area of
her record as a member of Congress: il
legal guns."
Bloomberg and McCarthy said Gilli
brand co-sponsored legislation to deny
information cities and police need to
track illegal gun use. The legislation
passed in the House but was never con
sidered by the Senate, McCarthy said.
At the news conference. Gillibrand
commended McCarthy for her "out
standing leadership in fighting against
gun violence and keeping our children
safe " and added: "I pledge to work with
her on her signature bill for updating
background checks to keep guns out of
the hands of criminals." Gillibrand said
she would support gun control "but also
protect our hunters' rights."
The Senate appointment lasts until
2010. when a special election will be held
to fill the final two years of Clinton's
term.
In picking Gillibrand, the governor
passed over a number of better-known
and more accomplished politicians, in
cluding New York City Rep. Carolyn
Maloney and New York Attorney Gen
eral Andrew Cuomo.
Paterson cited Gillibrand's work
ethic, background as a securities lawyer
and knowledge of issues important to
New York. He stressed that he didn't
choose her because she was a woman or
from upstate New York.
Paterson "has likely engendered the
wrath — privately, if not publicly — of a
great number of prominent Democratic
officials who would have liked the job
themselves," said Steven Greenberg. a
Siena College pollster.
President Barack Obama issued a

statement praising the choice, saying
Gillibrand would be a "strong voice for
transparency and reform in govern
ment."
Clinton, whose nomination for secre
tary of state was confirmed by the Sen
ate on Wednesday, also offered praise
for Gillibrand. who worked on Clinton's
2000 Senate campaign.
"Kirsten is an intelligent and dedicat
ed public servant and a dear friend. I'm
pleased that this seat, which has been my
great honor to hold ... will be in such ca
pable hands." Clinton said.
Meanwhile, the "personal reasons"
that Kennedy cited in dropping out of
contention remained a mysterv.

A friend of Kennedy's who was in
volved in the selection process said
Kennedy had a "minor issue with a
nanny" that the governor's staff found to
be irrelevant. The friend, who spoke on
condition of anonymity because of the
sensitivity of the situation, also said
Kennedy had a $615 city tax lien that was
settled in 1994 but no other tax prob
lems.
