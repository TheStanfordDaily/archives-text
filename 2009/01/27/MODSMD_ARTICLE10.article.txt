## Editorial ASSU's involvement in budget crisis praiseworthy 
### 
In the face of looming budget cuts, differ
ent parts of the University have sized up
expenditures and were forced to make
some tough decisions. 'ITie athletic depart
ment. hampered by revenue shortfalls, is
contemplating cost-saving measures like re
duced travel schedules in its effort to save all
35 of Stanford's varsity teams.The Graduate
School of Business (GSB) decided to lay off
about 12 percent of staff in what the dean
called his most difficult decision in 10 years
at the post. President John Hennessy,
Provost (and chief budgetary officer) John
Etchemendy and the rest of the school's
deans volunteered for a 10 percent pay cut.
Finally the ASSI! is entering the picture,
making a splash with a praiseworthy attempt
to bring students together to discuss the
budget cuts, what programs deserve saving
- and which we can afford to lose.
I .ate Friday afternoon,around a hundred
students congregated in Old Union to at
tend the ASSU's biggest town hall meeting
in recent memory. ASSU Executives Jonny
Dorsey '09 and Fagan I larris '09 worked to
ward fulfilling a major campaign promise —
they pledged increased communication with
students and frequent town hall-style meet
ings to encourage feedback — and made a
laudable effort to foster a campus dialogue
among students.
Attendants were solicited for questions,
advice and even given index cards to record
their preferences for programs to be saved.
This represents a major step forward for
ASSU visibility and effectiveness, and we
hope students' advocacy will be carried for
ward when the executives meet with Provost
Etchemendy on Thursday.
The editorial board endorses prioritizing
the "five principles" that emerged from this
month's joint session of the Graduate Stu

dent Council (GSC) and ASSU Senate —
"retaining community centers and recre
ational facilities, preserving academic stan
dards. promoting campus health and saving
the jobs of staff members who interact di
rectly with students" (see "ASSU debates
budget cuts" in the Jan. 7 issue ofThe Daily).
We support the ASSU's belief that academ
ic programs are the top priority during what
could be a painful round of cuts.
Preserving jobs is an important second pri
ority, but might not be possible in all instances.
We applaud the earnest attempts of Universi
ty officials to make the layoffs as painless as
possible, including the institution of generous
severance packages and the inclusion of out
placement job search support, as was the case
with the GSB's recent staff cuts.
But students must remember that they
may not know as much about the intricacies
of the budget and. unlike University budget
officials, are not working full-time to make
these decisions. TTie University is not a
democracy, and the administration is not a
representative government — the adminis
tration may make decisions that the student
body does not support.
Nevertheless, students' input is valuable,
and their surprisingly enthusiastic involve
ment is impressive and beneficial to the Uni
versity. The editorial board hopes that the
ASSU builds on Friday's well-attended
meeting and proactively seeks to create a
student consensus with real weight. While
the administration does not have to listen to
a word the ASSU executives say Provost
Etchemendy and other budget officers will
be much more inclined to consider their
input if they are backed by a vibrant student
community that understands the impending
budget cuts and cares about those programs
which face impending termination.
