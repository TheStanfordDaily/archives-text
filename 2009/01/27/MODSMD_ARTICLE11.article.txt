## The 						Politics of Stimulus 
### 
President Obama has made it clear that
ihe early days of his presidency will he
focused on passing his massive $<S()()
billion stimulus package. It's his first test of
legislative mettle, and not surprisingly, his
first test of bipartisan mettle. Due to big De
niocratic majorities in both the House and
Senate, Obama would not have any prob
lems forcing it through with his own party's
votes alone. Hut it does seem that Obama
genuinely wants to have bipartisan legitima
cy to the program and is willing to uegotiate.
The House Republican leadership, for its
part, does not seem to want to. and is de
manding that the entire package consist of
various forms of tax cuts.
Ihe impetus for a stimulus of this size
seems to be what happens in a democracy
during or immediately following a crisis —
politicians need to show that they are doing
something to keep the people from rioting
or throwing them out of office at the first op
portunity. Alter 9/11, the Bush Administra
tion flailed around for years trying to prove
it was on top ol the situation. Within two
years, it created the massive and ridiculous
Department of Homeland Security (DHS),
invaded Iraq, mismanaged Afghanistan and
wasted billions of dollars propping up the in
competent and autocratic Pervez Mushar
raf. In retrospect, our initiatives on DHS,
Iraq. Afghanistan and Pakistan all made the
terror situation worse, not better.
The Bush Administration's response to
the financial crisis was also haphazard. Dur
ing the most chaotic days of banks teetering
on the brink of oblivion. Paulson and
Bernanke seemed to announce a massive
new program every other day. They saved
Bear Sterns, but let Lehman Brothers (and
only Lehman, really) go under, sparking
widespread panic. Lven the Troubled Asset
Relief Program (TARP) has been appalling
ly planned with essentially zero oversight or
transparency. When historians look back on
this phase of the crisis, we cannot help but
look awful.
What Obama has not answered is what
happens if the stimulus package fails. If the
economy does not get better in early 201().it
will be clear that the stimulus package did lit
tle to actually simulate the economy,and we
will be sitting on another $800 billion worth
of debt. The Bush Administration had al
ready been running huge deficits before the
current economic crisis, and now we have to
add the Troubled Asset Relief Program, for
$700 billion, along with the $800 billion stim
ulus package and a host of other initiatives.
And this does not even take into account
new massive spending programs like
Obama's health care proposal, through

which he promises to tackle the issue within
his first two years in office. Tax receipts are
already beginning to decline as consumers
stop spending money, and millions are being
laid off. The American government of 2015
will be so burdened under the debt accrued
during 2008-2010 that it will be feckless to
take on anything new.
We consequently cannot afford to have
this stimulus package be haphazard, like our
responses to September 11 and the early
days of the financial crisis. Obama may want
to negotiate with Republicans, but it cannot
come at the cost of a well-thought-out pack
age. If the Republicans are too obstinate and
want to change the intent of the program,
then Obama should go ahead and just force
the legislation through on the back of
Speaker Nancy Pelosi. He will obviously be
rewarded for it if it succeeds — he can claim
credit for reviving an economy that col
lapsed under his Republican predecessor
but will be punished if it fails. The risk of bi
partisanship is that Obama will make many
concessions to Republicans but get little in
return, for whether it succeeds or fails, the
people will look to the president first, not the
minority party in Congress. Obama would
be well-advised to not sacrifice his vision of
the stimulus package to the obstinate and
ideological House and Senate minority.
