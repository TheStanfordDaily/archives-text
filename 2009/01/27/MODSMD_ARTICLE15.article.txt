The Stanford women's swimming and div
ing team continued to walk along the path of
perfection last weekend, defeating two oppo
nents in its tour of the Grand Canyon State.
The Cardinal rode a wave of momentum to
continue its undefeated season by dominating
Arizona Slate. 167.5-113.5 and narrowly de
feating N0.7 Arizona, 150.5-147.5 on the road.
The victories boosted Stanford's record to an
impressive 17-0 on the season and extended
its Pacific-10 Conference winning streak to 16
meets. On the whole, the women swimmers
and divers have now won 38 of their last 39
dual meets, an impressive though often over
looked statistic in a sport that places a premi
um on NCAA titles.
As expected. Friday's meet at Arizona
State proved to be little more than a warm-up

for the Cardinal. Stanford breezed by the Sun
Devils in impressive fashion with its superb
freshman class leading the way. Freshman Jes
sica Rodriguez ignited the Cardinal bv win
ning the 1.000-meter freestyle by an eleven
second margin.
"Our freshman class is truly amazing," said
fellow frosh Angela Duckworth, a distance
swimmer for the Cardinal.
Duckworth and classmate Betsy Webb also
churned out outstanding performances in the
500- and 50-meter freestyle races. Each fin
ished second in her respective event â€” Duck
worth in the 500 and Webb in the sprint.
Not to be outdone, the Stanford divers kept
pace with the swimmers at Friday's meet. Ju
nior Carmen Stellar continued her fantastic
season by sweeping both diving events. She
tallied a 285.68 on the I -meter and a 288.15 on
