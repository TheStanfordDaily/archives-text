The Stanford women's swimming and div
ing team continued to walk along the path of
perfection last weekend, defeating two oppo
nents in its tour of the Grand Canyon State.
The Cardinal rode a wave of momentum to
continue its undefeated season by dominating
Arizona Slate. 167.5-113.5 and narrowly de
feating N0.7 Arizona, 150.5-147.5 on the road.
The victories boosted Stanford's record to an
impressive 17-0 on the season and extended
its Pacific-10 Conference winning streak to 16
meets. On the whole, the women swimmers
and divers have now won 38 of their last 39
dual meets, an impressive though often over
looked statistic in a sport that places a premi
um on NCAA titles.
As expected. Friday's meet at Arizona
State proved to be little more than a warm-up

for the Cardinal. Stanford breezed by the Sun
Devils in impressive fashion with its superb
freshman class leading the way. Freshman Jes
sica Rodriguez ignited the Cardinal bv win
ning the 1.000-meter freestyle by an eleven
second margin.
"Our freshman class is truly amazing," said
fellow frosh Angela Duckworth, a distance
swimmer for the Cardinal.
Duckworth and classmate Betsy Webb also
churned out outstanding performances in the
500- and 50-meter freestyle races. Each fin
ished second in her respective event — Duck
worth in the 500 and Webb in the sprint.
Not to be outdone, the Stanford divers kept

athletes combined to win nine
events.
After winning with ease on
Friday. Stanford appeared ready to
take on the defending NCAA cham
pion Wildcats. The match was
expected to be tight, but nobody
anticipated the drama that unfolded
on Saturday.
Stanford got off to a very shaky
start in the most highly anticipated
and challenging meet of the year.
ITie Cardinal fell into a 29-7 hole
after only two events — a position in
which many teams would despair.
But not the Stanford swimmers.
The Cardinal women maintained
their composure and cut the deficit
down to just two points heading into
the final event, the 400-meter
freestyle relay. The members of this
relay group proved to be nothing
less than heroic by defeating

Arizona's "A" team by .16 seconds.
llie 4xloo team — the heart and
soul of the Stanford squad —is
composed of sophomore Kate
Dwelley, freshman Sam Woodward
and 200(S Olympians Elaine Breaden
and Julia Smit. Each leg of the race
was strong, hut it was Smit's anchor
leg that proved to be the difference:
the junior edged out Arizona's
Taylor Baughman by .78 seconds.
"The team was so ecstatic."
Duckworth said. "We were all so
proud to be Stanford swimmers with
our [come-from-behind] win. I think
it gave our team a huge confidence
boost that we could beat [Arizona]
this year."
Beating Arizona will surely gen
erate more talk about Stanford as
the best team in the land. The
Cardinal is uncharacteristically deep
for an elite NCAA team, a quality
that is not taken for granted by its
members.
ITie 12th event of the Arizona
meet showcased Stanford's depth at
the expense of the Wildcats. In the
100-meter butterfly, the Cardinal
notched 15 of a possible 19 points.
"We have so much confidence, and
we all believe as a team that we can

win the NCAA fChampionships],"
Duckworth said. "Our team spirit and
talent can definitely come together to
win."
The Stanford divers rose to the
occasion once again, sweeping both
the 1-meter and 3-meter competi
tions. Stellar won the 1-meter spring
board with a career-best score of
292.50. She finished 30 points ahead
of the field. Sophomore Meg
Hostage completed the diving sweep
by winning the 3-meter competition
with a score of 285.15.
Stanford has little time to rest as it
takes on Pac-10 rivals UCLA and
Southern California this Friday and
Saturday. Duckworth hopes that
both events will draw large groups of
fans to Avery Aquatics Center as the
Cardinal makes a serious run toward
a NCAA title.
"We will just continue getting
excited and having fun." Duckworth
said.
Saturday's contest will be the
Cardinal's last home meet. Both
contests are scheduled to start at I
p.m.
