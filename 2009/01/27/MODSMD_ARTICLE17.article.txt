# Controlling the Court
## 
### 
Point guard is a unique position, unlike
any found in the other major sports.
The point guard is the captain of the
hardwood — plays run through him. and it
is his duty to ensure that tlie game plan is
executed smoothly on both offense and de
fense. Like a closer in baseball,point guards
take a different mindset than any other po
sition on the court.They have to know both
their teammates' and coach's tendencies,
and control the How of the game according
ly. They distribute, they direct, they find
ways to win.
The closest comparison to a point guard
would be quarterback, but if a OB has a
good (or bad) game, it will generally show
up in the stat line. Point guard? Not neces
sarily.
Let's throw out some numbers: 7.7
points and 4.6 assists per game. Those are
senior Mitch Johnson's season averages.
Nothing special, but they don't even begin
to illustrate how important he is to the Car
dinal. Without him. Stanford's offense lacks
the kind of consistency necessary to win on
a regular basis.
Johnson missed the Cardinal's last two
games against the Oregon schools with a
strained right calf. It was the first time he
had missed a contest in his entire Stanford
career.
If you look at a stat line from the Cardi
nal's 77-55 win over Oregon on Thursday, it
would seem that Stanford did just fine with
out Mitch. The team shot at a 50 percent
clip and was rarely threatened by the
Ducks' attack. But don't let that fool you:
the offense wasn't the same.
Oregon looks like a historically bad
squad this year — I wouldn't be the least
hit surprised if they went winless in confer
ence play. Ilie Ducks are a team that Stan
ford should slaughter completely, yet the
Cardinal allowed them to hang around well
into the second half. Oregon even made a
little run and cut the lead down to just 13 at
one point. It wasn't that anything went es
pecially wrong, or that Johnson's backups
— senior Kenny Brown and junior Drew
Shiller — did a poor job, but Stanford's at
tack lacked the gusto that had become
commonplace since the start the season.
The flow sputtered at times, and against a
better or even mediocre opponent, the Car
dinal likely would have run into trouble.
That's exactly what happened on Satur
day night, when an upstart Oregon State
team crashed Maples and pulled off a sur
prising and dominant 77-62 upset. From the
beginning of the game, the Cardinal lacked
any rhythm whatsoever. Stanford had fa
vorable matchups with the Beavers' big
men. but the ball-handlers couldn't work
