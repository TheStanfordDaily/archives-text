rely on the three-point shot, which failed
them time and time again.

those instances were few and far between,
as the Cardinal's points seemed lost when
ever Oregon State turned up the pressure.
Once the Beavers smelled blood, they
never relented.
This isn't to say that Brown and Shiller
aren't good basketball players. Iliey are.
But Brown isn't a natural point guard
he's used mostly as the Cardinal's long
range bomber — and Shiller is a more shot
oriented point guard than Johnson.
Which brings us back to Mitch. Stan
ford's erstwhile leader. His play wasn't al

over the point guard duties. Among his
teammates. Johnson doesn't always stand
out — he isn't the most athletic person on
the squad, he doesn't have the best shoot
ing touch, nor is he the best defender
(though his lockdown performance on
Cal's Jerome Randle was a sight to behold).
But he is the master of the intangible as
pect of the game, the part that can't be
measured on stat sheets. Without question,
and without anyone even nipping at his
heels, he is the Cardinal's best in-game co
ordinator and facilitator, the one guv on
the team who can make sure that every
thing is running smoothly and that every
one is fulfilling their role exactly as they're
supposed to.
Johnson's importance to Stanford can't
be stated enough, and with a road trip to
Los Angeles on the horizon, with perennial
power UCLA and the dangerous Southern
California on tap. the Cardinal's hopes rely
on Johnson,strained calf and all.
