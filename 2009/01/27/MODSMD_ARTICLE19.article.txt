Two Stanford Footballers Selected in WPS Draft

Stanford seniors Marisa Abegg and Allison
Falk were selected in the inaugural Women's
Professional Soccer league draft on Jan. 16.
Falk. a center hack with a listed height of 6
feet, was taken in the second round (l()th over
all) by the Los Angeles Sol. Abcgg. an outside
defender who moved to center back last sea
son, was picked by FC Gold Pride in the fourth
round (26th overall).
The Pride will represent the Bay Area and
play home games at Santa Clara's Buck Shaw
Stadium.
Both players were four-year starters on the
Farm and led the team to four Sweet 16 appear
ances and one trip to the Final Four this fall.
Abcgg and Falk have developed a close rela
tionship both on and off the field. They even
live together â€” in adjacent rooms, no less
on campus.
"I was in my room," Falk said, recalling the
morning of the draft. "I got really excited, got
up and went into Marisa's room . . . Wc
watched the rest of the draft together."
"I saw that |Falk] got drafted in the second
round, and I got really excited and started
banging on her wall." Abegg added.

coaches. Falk has played for Sol head coach
Abner Rodgers in two previous summers.
