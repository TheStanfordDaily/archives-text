Two Stanford Footballers Selected in WPS Draft

Stanford seniors Marisa Abegg and Allison
Falk were selected in the inaugural Women's
Professional Soccer league draft on Jan. 16.
Falk. a center hack with a listed height of 6
feet, was taken in the second round (l()th over
all) by the Los Angeles Sol. Abcgg. an outside
defender who moved to center back last sea
son, was picked by FC Gold Pride in the fourth
round (26th overall).
The Pride will represent the Bay Area and
play home games at Santa Clara's Buck Shaw
Stadium.
Both players were four-year starters on the
Farm and led the team to four Sweet 16 appear
ances and one trip to the Final Four this fall.
Abcgg and Falk have developed a close rela
tionship both on and off the field. They even
live together — in adjacent rooms, no less
on campus.
"I was in my room," Falk said, recalling the
morning of the draft. "I got really excited, got
up and went into Marisa's room . . . Wc
watched the rest of the draft together."
"I saw that |Falk] got drafted in the second
round, and I got really excited and started
banging on her wall." Abegg added.
Both players are familiar with their new
coaches. Falk has played for Sol head coach
Abner Rodgers in two previous summers.
while Abegg is even more familiar
with her new boss, Albertin
Montoya — last season, he served
as a volunteer assistant coach for
the Stanford women.
"Albertin is a really good coach,"
Abegg said. "I really like his style of
coaching and play."
Falk is a California native and
was happy to stay relatively close to
home. Likewise, Abegg was pleased
to be selected by the Pride.
"I was really excited to be draft
ed by the Bay Area team so I can
stay around here." she said.
Although both players said they
had no expectations going into the
draft, they enjoyed sharing the
experience.
"It was a great experience to be
sitting next to the person who I
spent my whole college career with
and I'm so close with." Falk said of
Abegg.
The Women's Professional
Soccer league kicks off on Mar. 29.
when Falk and the Sol take on the
Washington Freedom at the Home
Depot Center in Carson. Calif. FC
Gold Pride also plays its inaugural
match at home, taking on the
Boston Breakers on Sunday. April 5.
