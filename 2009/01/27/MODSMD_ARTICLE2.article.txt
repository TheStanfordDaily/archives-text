# FDA approves human stem cell research
## Menlo Park firm takes lead in human testing 
### JULIA BROWNELL STAFF WRITER 
Last Friday, the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) approved the first
human trial of a therapy derived from human
embryonic stem cells (hESC), and authoriza
tion was given to Geron Corporation, a
biotechnology firm in Menlo Park, to begin
testing.
Geron is led by CEO Thomas Okarma
M.D. '72, who was also a professor at the
Stanford School of Medicine from 1980
through 1985.
The trial will involve injecting patented
neurological cells derived from hESC into
patients with recent severe spinal injuries
causing paralysis. Called GRNOPCI. the spe

ciali/ed cells are an early form of glial cells,
which repair the damaged myelin around the
spinal chord nerves and restore a degree of
function to the lower body.
â– "'lTiis is path-breaking." said Christopher
Scott, professor of biomedical ethics at the
School of Medicine and author of Stem Cell
Now.
"[The trial) will be the dawn of a new era of
medical therapeutics," Okarma added. "It
offers a permanent cure as opposed to simply
treating symptoms."
The FDA approved Geron's
Investigational New Drug (IND) application
three days after the inauguration of President
Barack Obama.
Okarma firmly indicated that he saw no
evidence of direct political involvement in the
FDA's decision. Still, he explained that circum
stantial evidence was abundant.
"There was probably lots of indirect influ
ence that made it a lot harder for the FDA to
judge the IND application." he said. "There's
no question that eight years under Bush has

dramatically slowed progress in this field."
Daniel Kraft M.D/%, an instructor in stem
cell biology and regenerative medicine, was
slightly more convinced that the timing of the
approval was politically motivated.
"1 suspect that there were political reasons
why [the FDA approval] was delayed." he
said.
Regardless of politics, the F DA's authoriza
tion was delayed in part due to traditional
steps of investigating the safety of the trial.
"This was the longest, largest IND that the
FDA ever received." Okarma said regarding
Geron's 22.(XX)-page application.
line FDA. he continued, considered "lots of
issues, mostly around safety issues."
Kraft explained that there are many vari
ables that could be dangerous.
" Ihere are issues of potential tissue rejec
tion." he said, citing the fact that the cells come
from a different individual. "By [the trial's)
very nature, it has some inherent risk."
Scott was also extremely wary of safety
issues surrounding the trial.

"Embryonic stem cells are very, very pow
erful." he said. "They divide endlessly; they
might cause cancer."
However, since the trial uses secondary
cells only made from hESC, the risk of tumors
comes only from the possibility of stray hESC
left behind in the neurological cell samples.
Scott also explained that the FDA has to
make sure the cells will be pure and free of
viruses that could infect the patient and wors
en his or her condition.
Phillip Yang, professor of cardiovascular
medicine, has worked with Geron on projects
involving stem cells and cardiovascular mus
cle. He stressed that this round of therapy is
more of a trial run to check for dangerous
tumors or side effects rather than to achieve
results.
"It's a safety test to see if there's any dan
ger in putting neural cells derived from embry
onic stem cells into the human body." Yang
said.
Still, he described Geron as a good compa
ny for the job.

"[Geronj is very thoughtful and very care
ful," he said. "They're one of the more
advanced companies in the area."
Okarma thought this project was a good
chance to convince the FDA to approve
embryonic stem cell-based therapy because of
the extensive animal testing done to corrobo
rate the evidence of possible potency in
humans.
"We had a validated animal model of
spinal injury that we were able to tap into
early" he explained.
In the animal testing, rats were injured
under anesthesia to simulate human spinal
trauma and treated with the GRNOPCI cells.
Very few problems were observed. Cieron did
the testing in .collaboration with Hans
Keirstead. associate professor of anatomy and
neurobiology at UC-Irvine.
The actual therapy will involve injecting
the GRNOPCI cells into the spinal cord of
patients with seven- to 14-day-old spinal
injuries. 'I"his type of injury leads to
complete loss of function below the
point of damage and has no hope for
recovery. The patients will he asked
for their informed consent to join the
trial after a secure diagnosis.
The injury does not involve com
plete severing of the spinal cord, how
ever. The GRNOPCI cells repair
damaged myelin, which serve as a
protective coating for the neurons'
axons. Once the myelin sheath is
treated, the neural impulses can once
again be carried down the spinal cord
to increase coordination and function
in the lower body.
No current therapy can restore
such function.
However, true breakthroughs are
not the focus of this initial trial. The
authorized therapy is known as a
Phase 1 trial, meant simply to verify
the safety of the method.
ITiough the primary role of the
trial is to ensure the therapy isn't dan
gerous. improved mobility and other
positive results would be a huge boon
for the entire science community,
including Stanford's.
"We haven't had anything to hang
our hat on." Scott said. "[Success] is
going to make a lot of political wran
gling go away. What politician would
face their constituents and tell them,
no. you can't use that?"
"Any show of improved function
would be a huge win." Kraft added.
"The lessons learned from this trial
will lead to real clinical outcomes."
In addition. Okarma said Geron
has new findings indicating that the
GRNOPCI cells could also lead to
increased neural functioning and con
nectivity. Ihis finding means the cells
could possibly be used to treat other
neurological disorders.
"The OPCI cell does much more
than merely myelate," Okarma said.
"[This finding] opens the door for the
OPCI cell to be used for other degen
erative neural diseases such as multi
ple sclerosis, Alzheimers and stroke."
However, researchers were also
quick to stress that the therapy was
not the only chance for hESC thera
pies.
"If the Geron trial doesn't work,
there will be other attempts." Scott
said. "It's really a matter of time."
In order to really get research
going, Okarma stressed that govern
ment funding must be given to aca

demic institutions like Stanford to
pursue research.
"The Bush era dried up funding
for academics," the CEO said. "There
needs to be new money allocated to
stem cell research in academia."
I fowever. the funding shouldn't be
limited to universities, he added.
"There's a reason that companies
in biotech don't have any revenues."
Okarma said.
Geron is not yet a profitable com
pany, having lost $S(X) million since its
beginning. And. according to The
New York limes. Geron paid approx
imately $45 million to get the FDA's
approval.
Geron and Stanford have worked
together in the past, but Okarma
stressed that the company goes where
the best researchers are. regardless of
the institution.
"The proximity of Stanford and
my history there is pretty irrelevant."
he noted.
However, Kraft stressed that
Stanford is already on the cutting
edge of stem cell research on its own,
citing the Stanford Institute for Stem
Cell Biology and Regenerative
Medicine as a prime example of a
breakthrough research facility.
Still, according to ()karma, success
is generally a result of collaboration
of efforts.
"It comes from a partnership
between the business world and aca
demia."
