## Stanford competes in recycling challenge 
### JENNY REMPEL STAFF WRITER 
For the next two months, Stanford will be partic
ipating in Recyclemania. an international competi
tion designed to promote recycling and waste man
agement.
Iliis is Stanford's third year of involvement in
the program, which has now expanded to include
510 colleges and universities across the globe.
"It's really important to know how much trash
you. as a community, recycle and produce." said
Shila Soni. a eoterminal student who has interned
with the Stanford Recycling Center. "One of the

benefits that people don't often realize is that it's
kind of a motivator for future interventions."
Campuses participate in five waste management
categories: Grand Champion. Per Capita Classic.
Waste Minimization, the Gorilla Prize and Targeted
Materials.
Hie total amount of recycled material and trash
produced by the campus is recorded for each week
of the 10-week competition. For the Grand
Champion and Waste Minimization categories, this
data is tabulated on a per-person basis.
"Last year, we won the Gorilla Pri/.e because we
recycled the most." said Lauren Finzer'o9.co-presi
dent of Students for a Sustainable Stanford (SSS).

"It isn't the greatest prize."
While the Grand Champion prize takes into
account the school's recycling rate and its overall
waste generation, the Gorilla Prize is awarded to the
school with the largest total amount of waste recy
cled.
While this may at first seem impressive. Nick
Enge '09 pointed out that the Gorilla Prize does not
necessarily reflect a victory for sustainability.
"You could go out and buy more bottled water
and help the competition." Enge said,"which seems
like a strange thing to be promoting."
