## Stanford competes in recycling challenge 
### JENNY REMPEL STAFF WRITER 
For the next two months, Stanford will be partic
ipating in Recyclemania. an international competi
tion designed to promote recycling and waste man
agement.
Iliis is Stanford's third year of involvement in
the program, which has now expanded to include
510 colleges and universities across the globe.
"It's really important to know how much trash
you. as a community, recycle and produce." said
Shila Soni. a eoterminal student who has interned
with the Stanford Recycling Center. "One of the

benefits that people don't often realize is that it's
kind of a motivator for future interventions."
Campuses participate in five waste management
categories: Grand Champion. Per Capita Classic.
Waste Minimization, the Gorilla Prize and Targeted
Materials.
Hie total amount of recycled material and trash
produced by the campus is recorded for each week
of the 10-week competition. For the Grand
Champion and Waste Minimization categories, this
data is tabulated on a per-person basis.
"Last year, we won the Gorilla Pri/.e because we
recycled the most." said Lauren Finzer'o9.co-presi
dent of Students for a Sustainable Stanford (SSS).

"It isn't the greatest prize."
While the Grand Champion prize takes into
account the school's recycling rate and its overall
waste generation, the Gorilla Prize is awarded to the
school with the largest total amount of waste recy
cled.
While this may at first seem impressive. Nick
Enge '09 pointed out that the Gorilla Prize does not
necessarily reflect a victory for sustainability.
"You could go out and buy more bottled water
and help the competition." Enge said,"which seems
like a strange thing to be promoting."
tinge emphasized that a high recy
cling rate must be coupled with low
waste generation in order to promote
a truly sustainable campus.
"I think [Recyclemania] is great
for raising awareness, but as a fair
competition to show w ho is the most
sustainable, it's seriously Hawed," he
said. "We compete in five different
competitions as a part of
Recyclemania, four of which provide
perverse incentives."
Julie Muir, manager of Stanford's
Recycling Program, is working with
SSS to promote the contest and
encourage recycling on campus. She
hopes Recyclemania will help bring
about an increased focus on recycling.
"I was a bit reluctant at first

because I didn't think that the campus
would be that excited about the con
test." Muir said.
Despite the competition's some
what mixed message. Muir has been
impressed with Stanford's perform
ance the past two years and is still
optimistic about Recvclemania's
effects.
"The Gorilla Prize shows that we
are comprehensive and we are seri
ous about taking care of our material
in an environmental way." she said.
Muir said she hopes the campus
will rally to the challenge and beat
Harvard and Yale in the Waste
Minimization category this year,
which is the only event Stanford lost
to the two schools last year.
"We do recycle a lot. but we also
waste a lot." Muir said. "I'm trying to
focus on that this year."
