## Dalai Lama gives to new altruism center 
### AN LE NGUYEN CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford School of Medicine
recently announced the creation of a
new Center for Compassion and
Altruism Research and Education
(CCARE). which aims to study the
neural, mental and social foundations
of compassionate and altruistic behav
iors.
The formal creation of CCARE
was made possible thanks to private
funding and a $ 15().( KK) donation from
the 14th Dalai Lama. Ten/in Gyatso.
However, the earliest ideas for the
center emerged back in 2(X)5. follow
ing a visit to Stanford by the Dalai
Lama himself.
For Bill Mobley, John E. Cahill
Family Professor in the School of
Medicine, the 2(X)5 visit represented a
pivotal starting step for the project.
"It was one of the early intercon
nections between typical neuroscience
and contemplative neuroscience"
Mobley said. "Buddhists contempla
tives. in general, think about what they
think about, and we neuroscientists
typically watch the brain work, so it
was an interesting bridge-building
experience."
Mobley and Jim Doty, clinical pro
fessor of neurosurgery, are the current
co-directors of CCARE. According to
Doty, the center aspires to develop "an
understanding of neuroanatomic
processes in the context of compas
sion."
Elaborating. Mobley noted that the
research conducted by the center is
characterized by two goals.
"The first is to understand what
brain circuits are activated in compas
sionate thinking and behavior."
Mobley said."and the second is [to see
if] we can train people — children and
adults — to practice behaviors that
will encourage compassion."
According to Doty, the Dalai Lama
shares the goal of promoting altruism,
and in fact has an interest in neuro
science as a way of understanding this
compassionate behavior.
Additionally. Doty said, the Dalai
Lama "agreed immediately" to speak
at Stanford again in order to share his
views on the importance of altruistic
behavior.
The center will target several issues
in the study of altruism. For instance,
researchers aim to explain why chil
dren become bullies and to find tech
niques to discourage prison inmates
from recommitting offenses. They also
attempt to discover a means of elimi
nating "compassion fatigue" experi
enced by clergy and hospital person
nel.
Still, Doty acknowledged that
many complexities come into play
when scientists try to unravel how the
brain deals with issues of compassion

and altruism.
"We understand that it's not one
anatomic kx'us." he said. "It is actually
a number of areas of the brain that are
integrated that then result in a per
son's acting in a compassionate fash
ion."

But Doty and his col
leagues hope that, in due
time, they will gather

enough knowledge to create
a set of mental exer-

cises that can

encourage
individuals
to become
more svm
pathetic |
toward
one another.

"It was an
interesting
bridge-building
experience."
— BILL MOBLEY
Professor, School of Medicine
"There's already work done in
psychology and cognitive neuro
science that focuses on higher brain
function." Mobley said, "so in a way
we're very well equipped to take on
this new problem."
In this sense, the CCARE appears
to be a natural outgrowth of the
research that is being conducted with
in the School of Medicine. But Mobley
also said the center's success partly
depends on engaging more of the
Stanford academic community
"I think that the thing we need now
is to begin a dialogue with our under
graduates that will help them under
stand what role they might play in this
center and. more generally, how they
might energize the center with their
insights," Mobley said.
He also welcomed collaboration
with other universities and organiza
tions.
"My guess is that we're going to
find colleagues across the country and
across the world who are going to
want to be a part of this," he added.
