DESK EDITOR
<% tarting tonight, ideas will be exchanged, stu-
S dents will network and the beginnings of start
ups will form. The Business Association of
Stanford Entrepreneurial Students (BASES) is
hosting its annual E-Challenge and Social-E
Challenge kickoff in the Fisher Conference Center at
the Arrillaga Alumni Center from 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m.
The event will begin with a Q&A between modera
tor Ryan Kottenstette MBA '09, co-vice president of the
E-Challenge, and a panel of entrepreneurs and
investors. Audience members will later break into four
groups for discussion, depending on their interests.
"Two panelists represent the E-Challenge, and two
represent the Social-E Challenge. These are people who
have a lot of experience in their field." said Alvin Tse
"10. Co-vice president of the E-Challenge. "The kickoff is
an opportunity for people to see what kinds of things
others have in mind, and find whether there's a team
they want to join."
And thus will begin two competitions that challenge
participants to intertwine business, technical and social
knowledge into a feasible business plan. The prize:
$100,000 to help propel winning ideas forward.
The E-Challenge
The E-Challenge and Social-E Challenge are organized
similarly. There are three rounds, beginning with an online
submission of a two-page executive summary. About 30 of
the 90 submissions advance to round two, where teams
submit a full business plan of around 20 pages and deliver
a 10-minute pitch to a group of judges. The most promising
teams will make the final round, which involves a revised
business plan and a 15-minute presentation, followed bv a
Q&A with the most qualified judges.
In particular, the E-Challenge is geared toward for
profit businesses and incorporates four main industries:
healthcare/biotech. cleantech, information technology
(IT) and Web. The executive summaries must include

factors such as business competition, financial model
and risk factors. All of the judges are venture capitalists
(VCs) or entrepreneurs.
"Since Stanford doesn't have many entrepreneurship
classes for the undergraduate community, the E-
Challenge provides a platform for students to experi
ence what it's like to be an entrepreneur," Tse said.
"Mainly, they'll get business plan experience and learn
how to form teams, see why an idea is feasible, etcetera."
Sumona Nag '09, a graduate student in biomechani
cal engineering, and her team won first place in last
year's competition. They designed their product — a
laproscopic suturing tool for the School of Medicine —
in a class on medical device design.
"A lot of that class was about completing the techni
cal process and choosing a design." Nag said.
"Afterwards, we decided we'd go for it and file for our
provisional patent."
As a result. Nag and her team created Logimed. Inc..
a biotech startup.

It's important to note that entering the competition
does not require much business experience. The compe
tition itself often gives students their first exposure to
entrepreneurship •
"At the beginning, we learned everything on our
own — we looked online to see what needs to be in a
business plan, and used Stanford resources." Nag said.
"Every time we presented, it got better and better.The
VCs gave us feedback on what needs to be in a pitch,
what makes it strong and what VCs want to hear. You
take them and learn from them, and that takes it one
step further."
And there's always a chance that a project may turn
into the next Google or Genentech. Logimed is working
on its second prototype, and Voltage Security, a previous
winner, is now managing $100 million of revenue.
"We have teams who have graduated from the com
petition that are very successful right now." Tse said.
"You never know when an idea will reach mainstream
consumers."
The Social-E Challenge
The most important criterion that differentiates the
Social-E Challenge from its counterpart is its focus on
an idea's social return on investment.
According to the challenge's Co-Vice President
Silvia Loica-Mersa '()«S. the companies can be for profit
and nonprofit, but they have to effect social or environ
mental change.
"Most of our entries come from cleantech, health
care, community development, microfinance and educa
tion," she said.
To help foster communication between potential par
ticipants. the competition will host mixers to allow stu
dents to pitch their ideas and form teams.
"Even if students aren't confident that their ideas
will materialize into something that gets millions, it's
important to just come out and get exposed to all the
potential there is to affect social change." said Roxna
Irani "10, co-vice president of the Social-E Challenge.
There will also be workshops and a mentorship pro
gram that will help contestants put proposals together at

each step of the 1
process.
"It's a good forum
for people to try ideas,"
Loica-Mersa said. "At
the very least, it's good
to hear feedback about
projects from people
who are very knowl-

edgeable in their field."
Rahul Panicker 'OS.
who earned his Ph.D. in

electrical engineering, was
part of the winning team that created Embrace, a $25
incubator designed to save premature and low birth
weight infants.
The idea for the project came out of an entrepre-.
neurial design joint class between Stanford's design and
business schools. Initially. Panicker's team was chal
lenged to create an incubator that cost less than half of
those currently used in hospitals.
"We traveled throughout India, and what we found
was that a lot of the babies that were dying were rural
babies," Panicker said. "Building a cheaper version of a
traditional incubator won't do because you need some
thing that will work in the local context of a rural set
ting. Most babies there aren't even born in hospitals."
Instead, the team designed a much cheaper incubator
that acted as a sort of "sleeping bag" to keep the haby
warm at a constant temperature. The device is portable,
easy to use and runs on water rather than electricity.
Right now, Embrace Global is working toward
becoming a sustainable nonprofit organization. The
$35,000 won at the Social-E Challenge certainly helped
its launching, but Panicker cites the type of thinking and
credibility gained as integral to its survival.
"While preparing materials for the competition,
we are forced to answer hard questions and think
through everything, because we are heing pitted
against other people in the field," he said. "It's also a
