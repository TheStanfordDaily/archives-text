### SIJIA WANG 
Jittery students congregated in the Lagunita
parking lot, some laden with duffel bags and
others toting hefty suitcases. A few snow
hoards could he spotted amidst the expansive
luggage piles that were scattered on the concrete.
Everyone antsy for the long-awaited ski
trip to Lake Tahoe to begin. The sun was oppres
sively hot, and the students looked like an oxy
moronic bunch, standing around in sunglasses and
winter coats.
After what seemed like a monumental wait, the
crowd finally boarded the buses and embarked on
the voyage to Heavenly Ski Resort, located to the
south of Lake Tahoe. The guys unceremoniously
took command of the DVD player on the bus.
playing goofy movies like "Old School" and
"Pineapple Express." Some students slept soundly
against the window panes, oblivious to the beauti
ful mountainous scenery outside. Others attempt
ed to play cards or classic road trip games designed
to defeat monotony.
About seven hours later, the buses finally
arrived at Lakeland Village, the complex of condo
miniums residents would be staying at for the next
two days. The students were divided into eight
houses of 1 1 or 12 people each, and as they hauled
their bags through the fresh snow, the scheming
and colluding began.
"Hey guys, where's the party tonight?"
"Alright, if your house throws the party tonight,
we'll throw it tomorrow night."
"Does anyone know if there's a hot tub?"
Once inside, there was a mad dash upstairs â€”
housemates began claiming beds as if they were
conquistadors racing to capture the New World.
Upon exploration, the house wasn't exactly
what they had expected. The students had envi
sioned staying in a rustic log cabin, complete with
shaggy rugs and a romantic fireplace. Instead, the
place had a contemporary feel, with a tight spiral
staircase leading to upstairs sleeping areas. It was
spacious, well-mirrored and had an electricity
powered fireplace.
Some students party-hopped before settling
down to sleep. Others decided to catch up on read
ing or hobnob with small groups of friends. In any
case, almost everyone crawled into sleeping bags
early, resting for an action-packed day of snow
related activities.
On the Slopes
While some of the ski-trippers chose to spend
the day relaxing in the house, the majority braved
the cold and headed for the mountains.
"We woke up at seven o'clock in the morning
and were on the mountain by eight o'clock," said
Rebecca Hecht T2. "It was gorgeous because
everywhere we went, there were panoramic views
of Lake Tahoe. We kept on stopping to take pic
tures. I usually ski in New England, so I'm accus
tomed to icy conditions. But here, it wasn't as icy.
and there was so much snow."
Experienced skiers and snowboarders headed
solo toward black diamond slopes, cutting and carv
ing the powder with expertise. Others stuck with
(he easier green circles, hoping to learn the ropes.
"There were some parts of [the day] when I was

seared, because I didn't really know a good way to
stop myself." said Andrew Nepomuceno'l()."Once
I learned how to control my speed, skiing became
a lot of fun."
A group of students went tubing for the first
time, and left with fond, though bumpy, memories.
"I had never even touched snow before," remi
nisced Alex Quach '12. " Tubing was a lot of fun,
especially with friends because you can watch
them go down. It was kind of like a waterslide or a
roller coaster. One of my friends crashed quite a
few times; he fell backwards and forwards out of
the tube."
And even expert tubers couldn't pull it off
gracefully.
"[Our friend] told people,' This is how it's done,'
and proceeded to fall out of the tube in front of
everyone."added Leo Alterman '12."1t was pretty
funny."

Joshua Frost '12 summed up his first tubing
experience aptly.
"I flipped. I slipped and 1 fell on my face, and it
was still fun." he joked.
But a day on the slopes is bound to leave stu
dents sore with black and blue in unsightly places.
Unfortunately, these ski- and snowboarding-relat
ed injuries dampened the mood at times.
"I hadn't seen the snow for three years, and I
got way too overexcited," lamented Hyungsoo
Kim '(R "I got up onto the slopes, and I guess the
snow wasn't as powdery ns I expected it to be. It
didn't provide much of a cushion for falls."
"I fell and skidded along the snow and barged
my knee on the ground," he added. "I thought it
was a minor bruise at first and didn't really notice
it. But the next day.it swelled like crazy. I think my
right knee cap is messed up."
But even with the snowboarding injury, Kim

looks forward to future trips to Tahoe.
"I'm going to try to go again on President's Day
weekend." he said.
Non-Skiers Make the Most of a Heavenly Day
Those who opted to skip out on skiing and
snowboarding decided to unwind in the houses in
the morning. When too much rest became much
too boring, a group of students headed for
I leavenly Village, a shopping complex with unique
specialty stores and a small ice-skating rink.
ITiey immediately spied the gondolas, which
promised to take visitors up to the mountain's
observation deck on cable lines.
Mouths dropped as the ride took the students
above a generous speckling of pine trees and
snow-covered terrain. When the gondola inched
