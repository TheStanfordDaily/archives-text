HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY ABOUT STANFORD?
Join The Stanford Daily editorial board as an at-large member!
WHAT: Analyze, form opinions, and write about the big issues facing Stanford students.
WHO: Three former Daily staffers, three at-large members (one of whom could be you!) and a Daily editor who serves
as chair.
TIME COMMITMENT: Once-a-week meetings plus up to two or three hours each week of writing time.
WHY: Because this is your chance to discuss important issues with fellow students, stand up, and make your voice heard.
SENDTOEIC@DAILY.STANFORD.EDU:
H Your name, year in school and major
H An approximately 250-word summary of activities, interests, reasons for joining, and how you think you could
contribute to the board
SEE YOURSELF IN PRINT!
Write a weekly column for The Stanford Daily!
SENDTOEIC@DAILY.STANFORD.EDU:
| Your name, year in school and major
| An approximately 1 50-word description of why you'd like to write a column, what it would be about, etc.
A short list of potential column topics
|AT LEAST one sample column (around 750 words) preferably TWO!
Why write a column? To be funny. To share your wisdom. To give your perspective on campus life, national politics, or global issues. Or just
to see yourself in print!
What are we looking for? We like columnists who have a theme to their writing (politics, the environment, etc.) and ones that tackle a
variety of issues. We enjoy both serious and lighthearfed columns as long as they show intelligence, tact, and a unique voice. Most
importantly, we like columnists who talk about campus issues and student life, provoke people to think, and entertain Daily readers.
