## Editorial ASSU should follow rules of openness and transparency 
### 
Of all the values a newspaper holds
dear, freedom of the press ranks right
at the top of the list.This in mind, sen
ators should have foreseen The Daily's con
stitutional challenge after a Daily reporter
was ousted from last night's Undergraduate
Senate meeting.
Tuesday night, the Undergraduate Senate
went into closed session to meet with Chief
Housing Officer Rodger Whitney and Senior
Associate Vice Provost for Residential and
Dining Enterprises Shirley Everett about
major changes concerning student housing.
But according to the ASSU Constitution, the
assembly can only close a meeting for a list of
specific reasons and must give 72 hours of ad
vanced. public notice. (See "Senate hears new
Housing, Draw plans" in today's issue of The
Daily.)
Ilie Daily was right to demand reentry to
the meeting. The Senate clearly violated its
own rules in attempting to close the meeting.
Members, particularly the new Senate Chair.
Shelley Gao '11. should have been better
aware of constitutional policy. In accepting
their mistake and finally admitting The Daily
to last night's meeting, senators should admit
they need to be better aware of their own con
stitutional provisions, furthermore, the Sen
ate's lack of awareness on this issue suggests
that senators need to do a better job studying
the constitution. If this violation occurred,
what other constitutional oversights might he
taking place?
This lack of awareness of its own rules re
flects badly 011 the Senate's professionalism,
and stifling the freedom of the press does little
to improve its image. Hie editorial board does,
however, applaud Senator Luukas lives '09
for pointing out to the Senate, in an email as
the events unfolded, that the procedures for
holding a closed meeting were not followed.

While the Senate may have a list of valid
reasons for closing a weekly Senate meeting,
last night's meeting with administrators about
housing plans does not fall on the list.The sen
ators were acting in an official capacity, com
menting on a matter deeply relevant to stu
dents— housing reform —in their tradition
ally open weekly meeting. If they are acting as
official representatives of student interests,sen
ators should comment on important matters in
the open, where they can he held accountable.
Imagine the press outcry if the United
States Senate violated its rules and suddenly
closed down a purportedly public meeting be
cause members decided they did not want
their opinions on certain matters made public.
Similarly, undergraduate senators should not
be able to conduct official business without the
oversight of the press, and most importantly,
the oversight of the students they represent.
The editorial board also questions why
1 lousing officials approached the Senate in this
manner. While senators may have opinions of
their own. they should not be commenting in
their capacity as public officials in a private set
ting, and I lousing officials should understand
these limitations. If senators wanted to com
ment on housing reforms, they would be free to
do so on their own time and in an unofficial ca
pacity.
The editorial board looks forward to evalu
ating the merits of any coming changes to resi
dential life on campus. Certain aspects of a
three-tiered draw appear promising, and we
look forward to further assessing the feasibility
of reshuffling all-frosh and upperclassmen
dorms. As administrators unveil their master
plans, we hope for a public discussion that en
gages the entire student body. We expect that
senators agree with these aims, and expect that
they will better follow their own bylaws in the
future.
