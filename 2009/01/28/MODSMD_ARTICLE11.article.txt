## Miller High Life asks for one second of your time 
### 
The Super Bowl. We all know that it
only takes one second of this epic loot
hall smackdown to change the entire
course of the game — but can a one-second
commercial change what kind of beer you'll
want to be drinking when that happens?
Behold Miller High Life's one-second
Super Bowl commercial: Instead of paying
three million dollars for one 30-second
block during the game, the company will
simply air a one-second clip of its spokesper
son. "the deliveryman," saying something
quick and simple about his favorite beer
(some suggestions in the recently released
pilot commercial include outbursts such as
"High Life!" "Sweet Deal!" "Wallet
Lovin'!" and. my personal favorite. "C'hub
bly Bubbly!"). Why? Il seems that it all
comes to down to frugality — because, ac
cording to the practical deliveryman, "Who
got three million dollars?"
Besides saving the company a ton of
money, this campaign will also serve to
prove an important point: namely, that by
saving so much money on advertising during
one of the biggest television events of the
year. Miller I ligh I .ife will be able to invest
more of its resources into delivering the best
and cheapest beer product possible. This
strategy is purposely in pointed contrast to
competitors such as Budweiser. whose
Super Bowl commercials always appear in
creative, and expensive, abundance.
At first.it might seem counterintuitive for
a beer company called "High Life" to aim
low when il comes to spending — unless, of
course, that company's slogan happens to be
"Common sense in a bottle." That concept is
further elaborated on the Miller High Life
Web site as a rebellion against "all the non
sense in the world that says bigger is better,
wider is better, blinger is better." And consid
ering that the phrase "the champagne of
beers" is printed on every bottle. Miller I ligh
Life is indeed doing all it can to cultivate the
feeling of luxury for its customers while in
curring as little cost to them as possible.
Keeping this in niind.it is undeniable that
the penny-pinching rationale behind the
one-second commercial is in complete har
mony with the Miller I ligh I ife philosophy.
Yet besides being an attempt to relate to
consumers by acknowledging the necessity
of saving money in these hard times, the one
second ad campaign also raises an interest
ing question about the nature of television
advertising. We all love commercials that
make a particularly vvilty use of the 30-sec
ond block — I've certainly done my fair
share of criticizing the ones that fall short of
my expectations for cleverness. But when I
went to the Miller I ligh Life one-second ad
website (lsecondad.com) and saw some of
the possibilities for the ad that will air during
the Super Bowl.it made me wonder what

is the point of having a 30-second long com
mercial. when it seems that one second
might do just fine?
To answer that question, you first need to
imagine what exactly a one-second commer
cial would look like. In the case of Miller
High Life, the commercial contains a very
distinct and rapid visual along with the deliv -
eryman's catch phrase: The Miller High Life
banner waving over an entire stockroom of
Miller High Life beer. When watched apart
from any other programming, it just seems
like a freeze frame of a Miller High Life
warehouse, uninteresting and ordinary. Yet
when wedged in between normal,full-length
Super Bowl commercials. I have a feeling it
will seem much different — something
more like, as former President Bush would
say, a "subliminibal" message.
We've heard a lot about subliminal mes
sages. whether in an advertising context con
cerning James Vicary's movie theater experi
ment in the 50s (although he later admitted
his data was fabricated) or the famed "sub
liminal" death mask Hashed during the movie
"The Fxorcist." Loosely defined.it is any sig
nal or message that is incorporated into a
medium so that it passes under the radar of
human consciousness, but still affects the sub
conscious mind and subsequent related be
havior And whether or not you believe that
these messages exist, or are effective, the fact
is that the human brain has the ability to pick
upon the quickest of stimuli. So during Miller
High Life's one-second commercial, a one
second flash of the Miller I ligh I ife logo may
be all that it takes for your later beer-buying
decisions to be affected.
I'm sure this is not exactly what Miller
High Life had in mind when designing the
one-second ad campaign; rather, it seems
more likely that the philosophy behind the
commercial is what they really want their
customers to take home with them. After all.
by admitting that it cannot afford a three
million-dollar price tag. Miller I ligh I ife will
certainly bring its image closer to the heart
of the average beer drinker.
But if Miller High Life sales are indeed
boosted after the Super Bowl, the question
must be asked: Is it the company's forthright
practicality that influences consumer choice
or something infinitely more simple and
subtle than all that marketing rhetoric?
