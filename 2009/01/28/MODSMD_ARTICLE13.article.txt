## The
						clothes make the (wo)man 
### 
If it's true that all clothing makes a state
ment. then most Stanford students are per
petually affirming that they haven't had
time to do laundry in the past month.
Meanwhile, public figures,equipped as they
are with assistants and beauty teams, presum
ably put thought into what they wear.
F r airly or not. we seem to find this a note
worthy topic. We not only scrutinize their
clothing, but also spend countless hours ana
lyzing the significance of their sartorial deci
sions. Who could forget Rachael Rays appar
ent flirtation with terrorism last year — be
cause of an unfortunate scarf choice? Or. dur
ing the recent presidential election, the accusa
tions that President Obama was unpatriotic
because he was not wearing an American Hag
pin?
I won't be the first to say that both of these
"controversies" were ridiculous.
I do recognize, however, that if we are con
stantly inundated with unprecedented quanti
ties of images of public figures, these debates
won't be the last of their kind.
It's a safe bet that many such discussions
about the implications of a fashion statement
will involve Michelle Obama in the near fu
ture. Less than a week into her husband's pres
idency.she is being lauded as the new Jackie O.
— the best hope for promoting American
fashion and boosting retail sales in a terrible
economy. Already, her ability to make a cloth
ing item a must-have, or a relatively obscure
designer a household name, has been demon
strated on multiple occasions.
Because women are so attuned to what
Michelle is wearing (for better or for worse, the
Obamas have been inexorably reduced to
first-name basis.as though we were all besties).
and because of her title as First Lady, every
fashion choice she makes is imbued with a spe
cial political significance beyond that of a mere
celebrity.
All this hoopla seems to beg some ques
tions. When we talk about the new First Lady's
fashion, are we merely indulging in escapism,
or are we talking about something more pro

found? And if we do continue to extract signif
icance from what Mrs. Obama chooses to
wear, what level of scrutiny is appropriate?
Unlike her husband. Michelle Obama is not
an elected official. She doesn't get to do cool
things like shut down Guantanamo, enable
family planning education abroad or smack
Rahm Emmanuel's wrist with a ruler when
necessary.
Still, few would debate Michelle's cache as
a both cultural icon and. yes. a role model. For
those women among us who felt insulted by
Sarah Palin's ignorance and couldn't quite
identify with Hillary Clinton's abrasiveness.
Mrs. Obama is someone we actually want to
emulate.
She's a highly educated, successful profes
sional who also has a family and what certain
ly looks like a great marriage. She comes across
as both competent and appealing, thus tran
scending the dichotomy that polarized the pre
viously mentioned women.
So. the fact that Michelle looks great mat
ters. It proves that attractiveness can be paired
with — and augmented by — intelligence,
confidence and power. It demonstrates that
looking professional and age-appropriate can
be more alluring than dressing like Ashley
Dupree (though most of today's celebrities
would have you believe otherwise).
Furthermore, the First Lady's choices in ap
parel have, in many instances, brought her clos
er to the common American woman. Given
the financial circumstances in which most
Americans lives right now. her decision to
dress affordably is not only respectful, but also
inspirational. Who knew you could look good
while spending less than $150.(MX)?
Yet it would be impossible to maintain this
role without disappointing at least some peo
ple some of the time. Neither of the designers
who made Michelle's inauguration dresses
were African-American —a fact that has
since sparked a lively, if inconclusive, debate in
various online forums about the relationship
between fashion and ethnicity.
I go back and forth on whether this is a fair

point to make. On one hand, no black designer
has ever created an inaugural gown, and the
First Lady could have broken this barrier.The
world of high-end fashion is notoriously white,
and as a black woman whose appeal tran
scends race, Michelle's endorsement of a black
designer for this occasion could have been sig
nificant.
On the other hand. Mrs. Obama chose to
support a young Asian-American designer
(who happens to use a lot of fur in his collec
tions. but that's a story for another day) and
looked beautiful.
We wouldn't study Michelle Obama's
wardrobe so much if it weren't so chic (can you
remember anything Laura Bush wore for the
past eight years?). But beyond that, the sad
truth is that we wouldn't find the new First
Lady quite so fascinating and accomplished if
she didn't also look good.
In a perfect world, we could appreciate the
First Lady's accomplishments without gush
ing over her toned arms and elegantly cut
dresses in doing so. But if I learned anything
this past year, it's that women in the public
sphere are defined by their sexual appeal, or
lack thereof.
If this isn't going to change any time soon,
let's at least put women out there who have
more to offer than just their appearance.There
may be too much emphasis placed on what
Michelle Obama is wearing, but I'm certain
she's a better role model than Paris Hilton
where both fashion and life skills are con
cerned.
The interest in the new First Lady may be
mostly skin-deep, but it may enable a new gen
eration of women to embody Michelle's best
attributes — her confidence, her intelligence
and yes, her stvle.
