# SWEPT IN SOCAL
## Men's volleyball can't handle USC, Pepperdine 
### JACOB JAFFE 
After an impressive start to the season, the No. 6
Stanford men's volleyball team ran into a pair of buzz
saws in conference play.
Fresh off successive road sweeps of Ohio State and
Ball State, Stanford (5-3. 1-2 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) came hack to California to face No. 6 USC
and No. 4 Pepperdine over the weekend. On Friday.
USC swept the Cardinal 30-22,31-29.30-23.
Junior opposite Evan Romero once again led the
way for Stanford with 11 kills in a losing cause. Fresh
man outside hitter Brad Lawson added nine kills to
keep the Cardinal close at times.
"Brad had moments of brilliance, which we hadn't
seen so far this year." freshman libero Erik Shoji said.
But USC kept the Cardinal on its heels all match
long with a hitting percentage of .371. including two sets
well over .400. Three Trojans — sophomore opposite
Murphy Troy, freshman outside hitter Tony Ciareili and
sophomore middle blocker Austin Zahn — combined
for 43 kills, more than the entire Stanford team. The
Cardinal attributed the Trojans' success to their passing.
"Their ball control was on point," Shoji said. "When
their ball control is on. they can set to any option. That
helped them fool our blockers and our defense."
Meanwhile. Stanford's hitters had a much more dif
ficult time fooling the USC defense. As a team, the Car
dinal hit only .230. with 16 fewer kills than the Trojans.
After the disheartening loss, the Cardinal headed
over to Malibu.and was swept by Pepperdine 30-25.30-
26,30-26. The loss was Stanford's 22nd straight to Pep
perdine. a streak dating back to 1997.The Cardinal was
led by Romero and sophomore outside hitter Spencer
McLachlin, who had 15 kills apiece.
"Spencer played really well against Pepperdine,"
said Shoji. who led the Cardinal with 15 digs from the

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal will look to rebound from last weekend's

Friday night and then UC-San Diego at Burnham Pavilion on Satur
day night.

libero position. "He asserted himself as one of our best
offensive threats."
Shoji's brother, junior Kawika Shoji. added 13 digs
and 40 assists from the setter position.
"Erik Shoji was our most consistent passer and de
fender over the weekend." freshman middle blocker
Cius Ellis said.
These performances, however, were not enough to
carry the Cardinal to victory, due once again to poor de
fensive play. Pepperdine hit an astounding .405 as a
team, led junior outside hitter Paul Carroll's 19 kills.
Pepperdine's success was largely a result of its balance.
"They spread their offense equally," said Ellis, who
had 10 kills and no errors over the weekend. "They did
not have any tendencies for the
blockers to pick up on. and every at
tack [was] different."
The Cardinal hitters did not find
the same success, as they hit .234 as a
team, while getting blocked 12 times.
"Their defense picked up on our
tendencies," Ellis said. "They
blocked us out of the gym."
On the other hand. Stanford had
just 11 blocks in the two matches
combined, with only one being a solo
block. The Cardinal knows it needs
good blocking to compete in the
tough MPSF.
"Our blocking needs to improve
a lot." Ellis said. "We were especially
hurt bv their middle attackers, so

we're already taking the necessary
steps to correct our mistakes."
"We aren't the biggest team, so
we need to be quick." Erik Shoji
added. "We need to force teams to
get past our blocks."
Even though the Cardinal had
some physical problems during its
matches, the team feels its main
problems were emotional.
"We need to compete harder."
Erik Shoji said. "It felt like we
backed off when it was close — we
need to be persistent and learn to
win."
The team is not content to play
like it did last weekend and is still
working to improve.
"We learned a lot about our
mindset and how it plays into our
performance," Ellis said. "We are al
ready starting to approach practice
with more focus and emotion."
With this new mindset, the C'ardi

nal is gearing up to face Long Beach
State in its home opener this Friday.
The match starts at 7 p.m. in Maples
Pavilion and all fans are encouraged
to attend.
