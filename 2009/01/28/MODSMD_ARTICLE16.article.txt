# Show the Cardinals some love
## 
### 
I doubt I'm the only sports fan
struggling to get excited for this
Sunday's Super Bowl. Cardinals-
Steelers? Really? This is supposed to
he America's secular holiday, 90 mil
lion viewers, and this is what we get?
Anyone who went to Vegas back in
August and bet on this match-up just
earned themselves an early (and
wealthy) retirement.
Given the difficulty in mustering
enthusiasm for Sunday's big game, I
am going to provide you. with a few
reasons why you should watch this
game and root for the Cards (because,
hey,you might as well pick someone).
Unless you're from Pittsburgh or
Phoenix. I'm guessing you could use
the help.
The George Mason Effect: Remember a
few years back when George Mason
made that improbable run to the
NCAA Basketball Final Four, capti
vating Americans nationwide? Well,
the Cardinals being in the Super Bowl
is even more improbable.
ITie Cardinals have existed since
IK9B and won just one NFL Champi
onship. way back in 1947. That was
when the team was still based in
Chicago, and before the Super Bowl
even existed. Just think, the Chicago
Cubs have won more World Series
championships in the last 110 years
than the Cardinals have won NFL
Championships.ln fact.until thisyear.
the Cubs had more World Series titles
in that span than the Cardinals had
total playoff wins (two) since their
1947 championship.
Who doesn't love an underdog, es
pecially one that has been written off
as inadequate to be in the playoffs to
begin with? In many ways, the Cardi
nals embody the 1 lth-seeded George
Mason mentality.They are only in the
playoffs because they played in a
weak division, yet continue to sneak
up on teams that the public expects
will roll them over.
The Local Bias: Ihis pertains to you,
Niners fans. The NFC West was the
worst division in football this year. It
was quite possibly one of the worst di
visions in the history of the NFL. as its
