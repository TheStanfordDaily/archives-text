# Show the Cardinals some love
## 
### 
I doubt I'm the only sports fan
struggling to get excited for this
Sunday's Super Bowl. Cardinals-
Steelers? Really? This is supposed to
he America's secular holiday, 90 mil
lion viewers, and this is what we get?
Anyone who went to Vegas back in
August and bet on this match-up just
earned themselves an early (and
wealthy) retirement.
Given the difficulty in mustering
enthusiasm for Sunday's big game, I
am going to provide you. with a few
reasons why you should watch this
game and root for the Cards (because,
hey,you might as well pick someone).
Unless you're from Pittsburgh or
Phoenix. I'm guessing you could use
the help.
The George Mason Effect: Remember a
few years back when George Mason
made that improbable run to the
NCAA Basketball Final Four, capti
vating Americans nationwide? Well,
the Cardinals being in the Super Bowl
is even more improbable.
ITie Cardinals have existed since
IK9B and won just one NFL Champi
onship. way back in 1947. That was
when the team was still based in
Chicago, and before the Super Bowl
even existed. Just think, the Chicago
Cubs have won more World Series
championships in the last 110 years
than the Cardinals have won NFL
Championships.ln fact.until thisyear.
the Cubs had more World Series titles
in that span than the Cardinals had
total playoff wins (two) since their
1947 championship.
Who doesn't love an underdog, es
pecially one that has been written off
as inadequate to be in the playoffs to
begin with? In many ways, the Cardi
nals embody the 1 lth-seeded George
Mason mentality.They are only in the
playoffs because they played in a
weak division, yet continue to sneak
up on teams that the public expects
will roll them over.
The Local Bias: Ihis pertains to you,
Niners fans. The NFC West was the
worst division in football this year. It
was quite possibly one of the worst di
visions in the history of the NFL. as its

teams combined for a .343 winning
percentage.Take away the Cardinal's
six wins against their bottom-feeding
NFC West opponents, and Arizona
was 3-7. making its long playoff run all
the more unlikely.
This, however, is a chance for vin
dication for the NFC West, and most
notably those second place
Having the Super Bowl champion
come out of your division automati
cally brings your team some sense of
legitimacy — something that has
been lacking for some time in the
NFC West. Seeing a division foe win a
championship simply means you
were losing to the best team all year.
So Niners fans, have some division
pride and root for those Cardinals.
The Anti-History: This also pertains to

you, Niners fans. The Steelers, Cow
boys, and San Francisco have each
won five Super Bowls. If the Steelers
win on Sunday, they will become the
single most successful football fran
chise ever. That means second place
for the 49ers and Cowboys. Nobody
wants to be second, so Niners fans
(and Cowboys fans) go by the old
adage that the enemy of your enemy
is your friend, and root for the Cardi
nals. Fansof Pittsburgh'sAFC foes, do
you really want the hated Steelers to
be the winningest football franchise
ever? I doubt it.
Hercules: Also known as Larry Fitzger
ald. The man is like a Greek god with
dreadlocks and football pads. He has
easily been the best player through
out the playoffs, and is quickly be
coming an unstoppable force at wide
receiver.
Everyone on the planet knew the
Cardinals were going to throw him
the ball in the NFC Championship
*»ame, yet he still managed to catch

three touchdowns in the First half
alone, and against one of the league's
best secondaries nonetheless. In three
playoff games, Fitzgerald has com
piled 519 receiving yards and five
touchdowns.
Fitzgerald is the most exciting
player on either team in the Super
Bowl,and what football fan doesn't
en joy seeing one player completely
take over a game? Seeing what
Fitzgerald is able to do against the
league's premier defense is the
most intriguing match-up in this
game.
The Cardinals have long been a
forgotten team in NFL lore, but come
Sunday, put on that Cardinal red, kick
back, and enjoy. Monday morning, we
all could be celebrating a most im
probable champion.

Dan Bohm and Larry Fitzgerald both
may want to flee this week if they see a
long-haired Samoan safety in black
and gold headed their way. Email Dan
