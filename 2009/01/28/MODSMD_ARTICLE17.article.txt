# Track and Field
## A 						new mark in New Mexico 
### ANARGHYA VARDHANA STAFF WRITER 
Last weekend's New Mexico
Cherry and Silver Invitational in
Albuquerque proved successful for
the Stanford track and field team,
as the Cardinal collected several
top finishes and even broke a cur
rent school record.
Hie men were led by senior
Mvles Bradley, who broke his own
school record in the 60-meter hur
dles. winning the event with a time
of 7.71 seconds. Bradley's new
time,though an NCAA provisional
time, barely fell short of the auto
matic qualifying standard of 7.68.
As of Jan. 17, Bradley was
ranked ninth in the nation with a
time of 7.85. while the first and sec
ond placeholders were at 7.58 and
7.72 seconds respectively. Given
Bradley's most recent run.he
might potentially be placed even
higher in the rankings in the com
ing weeks.
"My goal for this weekend was
to hit the automatic qualifying time
for NCA As,which at altitude is 7.68
seconds." Bradley said. "My race in
the prelims was very poor, so there
was more weight on the final than
normal, but I'm very happy to have
been able to perform well."
"The race felt great, but there's
definitely room for improvement,"
he added."To be competitive at the
national championship meet in
March. 1 need to run fast consis
tently and when it matters."
While Bradley led the way in the
hurdles, his teammate, junior J.J.
Jackson, also had a career-best per
formance. Jackson took second
place in the event with a time of
8.07 seconds, giving the Stanford
hurdling duo the top two positions
in the race.
"I was particularly happy for
both Myles and J.J. this past week
end for what they accomplished in
the hurdles," junior Ryan Fisicaro
said. "Myles with a school record,
and J.J. with a huge personal
record."
Fisicaro himself, who ran an
amazing comeback race last week,
again demonstrated his prowess on
the track: he finished in fourth
place in the 60-meter sprint with a
time of 6.89 seconds, barely off the
provisional standard of 6.72.
Fisicaro's recent success has
been a key asset for the program
that has been known nationally for
its spectacular distance runners in
the past few years, but has been less
remarkable in the sprints. Alter

arena.

"1 think this meet was a great
opener to real competition," fifth
year senior and women's team cap
tain Claire Thielke said of the meet
as a whole. "Meets down south tend
to feature schools that specialize in

the sprints, jumps, and relays. So it's
good for us to go down there and get
a piece of that action so we can he
better prepared for what we'll face
at Nationals. Our freshmen also did
a great job under'pressure running
on a banked track for the first time,
which is a really tough transition."
Thielke had a chance to shine as
an inspirational leader in the meet,
as she was stepped on during the
4x400 relay and had to finish running
the race with blood seeping through
her shoe. Thielke spent two days on

crutches but hopes to be back in ac
tion this coming weekend.
The Cardinal will take part in the
UW Invitational this coming week
