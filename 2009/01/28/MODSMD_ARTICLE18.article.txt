## Card takes second at Stanford Open 
### JENNY PETER 
The No. 6 Stanford men's gymnastics team finished
second behind No. 2 California last Saturday at the
Stanford Open in Burnham Pavilion. 355.3 to 356.45,
with No. 9 Nebraska placing third at 334.7. A "sold out"
sign was placed on Burnham s front doors as nearly
1.500 fans packed the gym for a close-up view of the
event.
Stanford started off well on the floor exercise, hitting
five out of six routines. I ligh scores from redshirt junior
GregTer-Zakhariants (15.6) and sophomore Josh Dixon
(15.55) were the highlights of the night on the apparatus,
earning them first and second place, respectively.
The Cardinal had a .95 lead over Nebraska and a 2.1
lead over Cal going into the second rotation, until the
team hit a rough patch on the pommel horse. Cal
outscored the Cardinal by nearly seven points on the
event,s9.os to 52.15.as the Cardinal was forced to count
four falls toward the team score. Because it is still early
in the season, the team decided to debut new and ex
tremely difficult routines with the majority of competi
tors having start values of over 16.0 on their routines.
"In reality, pommel horse is our best event." redshirt
senior Sho Nakamori said. "This meet, we wanted to
challenge ourselves because we didn't want to settle for
normal routines. We were trying to add a bunch of diffi
cult skills so that we can raise our start value scores."
When it comes time to go with more consistent, sure
fire routines. Stanford has three returning All-Ameri
cans on pommel horse that it can rely on. Nakamori,
