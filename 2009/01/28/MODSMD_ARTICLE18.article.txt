## Card takes second at Stanford Open 
### JENNY PETER 
The No. 6 Stanford men's gymnastics team finished
second behind No. 2 California last Saturday at the
Stanford Open in Burnham Pavilion. 355.3 to 356.45,
with No. 9 Nebraska placing third at 334.7. A "sold out"
sign was placed on Burnham s front doors as nearly
1.500 fans packed the gym for a close-up view of the
event.
Stanford started off well on the floor exercise, hitting
five out of six routines. I ligh scores from redshirt junior
GregTer-Zakhariants (15.6) and sophomore Josh Dixon
(15.55) were the highlights of the night on the apparatus,
earning them first and second place, respectively.
The Cardinal had a .95 lead over Nebraska and a 2.1
lead over Cal going into the second rotation, until the
team hit a rough patch on the pommel horse. Cal
outscored the Cardinal by nearly seven points on the
event,s9.os to 52.15.as the Cardinal was forced to count
four falls toward the team score. Because it is still early
in the season, the team decided to debut new and ex
tremely difficult routines with the majority of competi
tors having start values of over 16.0 on their routines.
"In reality, pommel horse is our best event." redshirt
senior Sho Nakamori said. "This meet, we wanted to
challenge ourselves because we didn't want to settle for
normal routines. We were trying to add a bunch of diffi
cult skills so that we can raise our start value scores."
When it comes time to go with more consistent, sure
fire routines. Stanford has three returning All-Ameri
cans on pommel horse that it can rely on. Nakamori,

mentum. The Cardinal hit six solid routines with the
high score from sophomore Tim Gentry at a 15.1, earn
ing him a first-place finish. Oi and redshirt sophomore

with another strong performance, landing all six difficult
vaults and scoring a 15.3 or better on each. Gentry had
the highest score of the meet with a 16.05 and performed
the most difficult vault of the night: a front handspring
onto the horse into a front double flip. Oi wowed the
crowd and judges as well, with hisTsuk double full twist
off the vault and a stuck landing, securing a 15.8 for the
Cardinal and a second-place finish.

mount. ending the Cardinal's meet
on a hi ah note.

Though the men's team beat Cal
on four of six events, it was not
enough to come back from the sev
ent-point deficit after subpar per
formances on the pommel horse and
parallel bars.The Stanford men know
they will have to fair better on these
events in order to continue their rise
to the top.
"Overall, we could be a lot clean
er on pommel horse and [parallel
bars]." Nakamori said.
Stanford did notch a large. 17.6-
point win over Nebraska, who strug
gled on pommel horse (50.55) and
parallel bars (54.25) and whose best
all-around competitor was out of the
