# Senate hears new Housing, Draw plans
## 
### NIKHIL JOSHI MARISA LANDICHO 
The Undergraduate Senate breached pro
tocol last night by attempting to discuss pro
posals from members of the Housing Draw
Task Force in closed session.
After gaining entry into the meeting. The
Daily learned that the Task Force plans to
recommend a three-tiered draw system, with
possible considerations for class standing,
along with a move away from the priority sys
tem. In addition, the new proposed Housing
Master Plan would have major effects on the
composition of houses on campus — for
example, a change in Branner's all-freshman
status.
The Daily will have complete coverage on
all of the Task Force's recommendations in
Friday's issue.
Housing administrators requested that
last night's meeting with the Senate be closed
to the public because of the sensitive nature
of the topics discussed.
"We didn't want to have the media here

because then we don't get open and honest
feedback from the Senate," said Shirley
Everett, senior associate vice provost of resi
dential and dining enterprises. "I wanted this
to be closed, so we could really get students'
opinions."
But the Senate is a public body, and
according to the ASSU Constitution, it must
give 72 hours notice in declaring a meeting
closed to the public, and must also provide
reasons for the closed session.
Although the Housing administrators
were promised by the Senate a closed meet
ing days before. Senate Chair Shelley Gao' 11
failed to comply with the constitution's 72-
hour rule, and when prompted bv I"he Daily,
was forced to re-open the meeting after
about 30 minutes of improper closed session.
Senator Luukas lives '09. who was not
present at the meeting, noted in an email that
declaring a closed session halfway through a
meeting was inappropriate, and urged the
senators to allow the public back in.
"We knew that 1 lousing was interested in
making a presentation, but we weren't very

much aware of the 72-hour regulation," Gao
said.
The Housing administrators asked the
Senate for feedback on the proposals, and the
senators were eager to offer their opinions.
Several senators urged the administrators
to consider that not all students wish to go
abroad during their junior.year, that many
students' preferences are complicated by res
idential staffing and that some students wish
to draw with members of different classes.
Notably, the senators were polled about
their preferences for three specific versions
of the proposed three-tiered draw system.
The majority of voting senators supported a
version that would allow sophomores to pick
which of the lowest two tiers of housing they
wish to draw into, and allow juniors and sen
iors to choose from any of the three tiers.
Director of Residential Education
Deborah Golder then asked the senators for
their views on the necessary components of
the Stanford experience.
"From my experience. Resident Fellows
don't do anvthine," said Senator Stuart

Baimel '09, claiming their lack of visible pres
ence in dorm affairs.
Baimel said the problems of the RF posi
tion came from the dual role of residential
and teaching staff.
Colder agreed with Baimel's criticism,
while ASSU Executive Fagan Harris respect
fully disagreed.
"In defense of \Mf) work, their manag
ing staff is critical." Flarris said. "It's largely
thankless work, and I think we have to con
textualize our perspective on it."
Gao wanted a shift away from dorm-onlv
programming.
"1 think, especially for freshman dorms,
which have a substantial amount of program
ming, there is a greater need for sensitivity,"
Gao said. "I feel that sometimes [freshmen]
might feel pressured to engage in those dorm
activities."
The two-and-a-half-hour mark of the
meeting came as Baimel announced his own
departure, leaving eight senators out of 14 —
and. according to Baimel. a lack of quorum.
Without quorum, the Senate would not be

able to vote on any issues.
The details of the bylaws, however, were
questionable. Attending Graduate Student
Council member Ryan Peacock noted that
the relevant section of the Constitution men
tioned a 16-member Senate — two over the
current Senate's composition.
Referencing the outdated bylaws, and
against Baimel's protests, the Senate asserted
it still had quorum with eight members, and
the meeting continued.
Harris introduced the new members of
the executive cabinet, including an opera
tions manager whose job description includes
looking for corruption within the ASSU
Executive branch.
Harris said the position was necessary to
introduce oversight for the discretionary
budget, and the findings would be released in
both a Daily op-ed and a formal report at the
end of winter quarter.
After Deputy Chair Patrick Cordova '09
thoroughly questioned the merits and staff
qualifications of the planned
Wellness Room. Gao was finally
able to call the three-and-a-half
hour meeting to an end.
