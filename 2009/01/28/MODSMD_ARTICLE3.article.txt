## Religion, gay rights discussed Black Community Center hosts dialogue on Prop. 8 
### MATTHEW SERNA 
Students and community members
gathered Tuesday evening in the Black
Community Services Center for a tense
but productive dialogue regarding
Proposition 8 and the gay rights move
ment from the perspectives of religion
and race.
The event, titled "Real Talk: Race.
Religion, and (Whose?) Rights," was co
sponsored by the Black Community
Services Center. Black and Queer
Students .it Stanford (BIaQS) and the
Office of Religious Life.
"Real Talk is a new initiative by
BIaQS to create a safe place for open
conversations about controversial top
ics." explained Corey Quinn '10, co-presi
dent of BIaQS. "We specifically want to
reach out to those who may not have felt
heard. 1 think that a lot of [people] might
have felt villain-ized by the rigor that
people approach the discussion with."
"Real Talk" featured a structured dia
logue between Dr. Reverend Ricky
Williams of St. John Missionary Church
in East Palo Alto, who supported the
proposition, and USC Associate
Professor of Law Kareem Crayton, who
was against it.The dialogue was moderat
ed by former Superior Court Judge
LaDoris Cordell, who is openly gay.
In her introduction, Cordell discussed
the rising tensions between the gay and
black communities.
"While we did not determine the
Prop. 8 outcome, a whopping 70 percent
of African Americans who did vote threw
their support to Proposition 8," she said.
"Since then, an undercurrent of distrust
has been swirling in the community. Gays
wonder why black voters, who have suf
fered so much in civil rights struggles of
their own, are so opposed. However,
blacks in support of Prop. 8 disagree with
the comparison of the gay rights struggle
to the black rights struggle."
Throughout the conversation, the two
speakers found little common ground.
Crayton anchored his argument for gay
marriage to the legal concept of equal
protection.
"If you are like other people, you
should be treated equally," Crayton said.
"II same-sex couples are not fundamen
tally legally different from non same-sex
couples, they should not be treated differ
ently under the law."
Williams, on the other hand, articulat
ed the perspective held by many
