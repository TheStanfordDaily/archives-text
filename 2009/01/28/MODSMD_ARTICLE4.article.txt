## Dr. Eboo Patel preaches acceptance Interfaith leader speaks out for religious pluralism 
### ZOE RICHARDS 
Dr. Eboo Patel, founder and direc
tor of Interfaith Youth Core (IFYC),
spoke last night about the importance
of religious pluralism at the annual
Roger W. Heyns Lecture on Religion
and Society in Cubberley Auditorium.
Scotty McLennan, dean of
Religious Life, explained the speaker
choice on behalf of the Haas Center
for Public Service. Office for Religious
Life and ASSIi Speakers Bureau.
"He represents what I think a
Stanford education needs for the 21st
century â€” religious literacy, under
standing of the role religion plays in
the world and the ability to relate to
people of other traditions with empa
thy and work with them," McLennan
said.

In the wake of President Barack
Obama's inauguration. Patel described
the inspiration of the new president's
diverse heritage and applauded
Obama's emphasis on the patchwork
multicultural heritage of the U.S.
"It is that very patchwork heritage
that is a force for peace in the world,"
he said.
Patel described how watching peo
ple of all faiths praying together for the
nation in the Presidential Inaugural
Prayer Service is what America needs
to embody for the current century.
Patel added that although remark
able. America's heritage is not without
blemishes. He urged the audience to
become interfaith leaders who embody
a vision, knowledge base and skill set
that can promote religious pluralism.
In response to a question posed
about the perception of conservatives
as part of the extremist tradition, Patel
insisted on the need to bring people of
all persuasions into interfaith discus
sion.

"If we're leaving them out, we're
having liberal cocktail parties." he said.
Patel offered a similar response to a
student who asked about the role of
nonbelievers in the movement for reli
gious pluralism by saying that secular
humanists are quick to quote from
Whitman and Thoreau and still have a
particular path that leads toward plu
ralism.
In the ultimate fight against extrem
ists and to answer to those who claim
religious homogeneity is most effi
cient. Patel stressed that pluralists have
to organize and use the same rhetorical
tactics as the extremists to convey their
message.
"If [extremists] have their knowl
edge base at the tips of their tongues,
then [pluralists] have to have our
knowledge base at the tips of our
tongues," he said. "If we don't, we for
feit the terrain."
Speaking on the War on Terror.

Dr. Eboo Patel, the founder and director of Interfaith Youth Core (IFYC), told students in Cubberley Auditorium about the
importance of acceptance and religious pluralism in today's world in a lecture sponsored by the Office of Religious Life.
Patel emphasized that one subtext of
America's approach is a lack of
knowledge about the enemy's identi
ty. According to Patel. the enemy is
neither Americans nor the Muslim
world, and the war is not between
Christians and Muslims. Rather, he
said, the real conflict is between plu
ralists and extremists.
The first thing a leader must do is
define reality, he added. Interfaith
leaders must do this by re-defining
the concept of "us" versus "them."
This will redress the idea that reli
gions can't co-exist.
Fadl Saadi '10 found the speech
helpful to those interested in inter
faith issues.
"Dr. Patel's speech was helpful
because 1 am interested in building
interfaith bonds, and he gave practi
cal ways to sustain impact on this
issue," Saadi said. "He gave this
movement a name and unified
vision. It was helpful to hear that
view. It gave the sense that you are
not alone."
Patel told The Daily that when
coming into his own identities and
reconciling his Muslim. American
and Indian selves, he started by "rec
ognizing that there were huge shared
values that are not mutually exclu
sive but mutually enriching."
"There is a centrality of pluralism
in Indian. American and Muslim tra

ditions," he said.
Hannah McConnaughay, pro
gram associate for IFYC, explained
that IFYC is bringing in new leaders
for religious pluralism.
"[IFYC is] catalyzing leaders
wherever they are." she said.
When asked by The Daily to
describe how he came into interfaith
work. Patel responded by talking
about his youth.
"I came of age in the 1990s when
someone killing someone in the
name of God was common," he said.
He then began asking himself.
"Why isn't there a movement chan
neling the religious, spiritual and
moral energies of people towards
pluralism?"
IFYC was Patel's answer to this
question, and the organization has
led him to become an Ashoka Fellow
for social entrepreneurship.
Patel also told The Daily that in
order to forge reconciliation in Gaza,
the same ideas of religious pluralism
have to be applied.
"We have to channel our energies
toward peace, security and dignity
for both sides," he said. "Too often,
discourse falls to, 'Do you support
the Palestinians or the Israelis?' But
neither will reach peace unless we
begin to ask whether we are for or
against a solution."
Students will continue the inter
faith discussion about religious plu
ralism in workshops with IFYC
today.
