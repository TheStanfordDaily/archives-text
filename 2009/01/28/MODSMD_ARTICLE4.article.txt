### ZOE RICHARDS 
Dr. Eboo Patel, founder and direc
tor of Interfaith Youth Core (IFYC),
spoke last night about the importance
of religious pluralism at the annual
Roger W. Heyns Lecture on Religion
and Society in Cubberley Auditorium.
Scotty McLennan, dean of
Religious Life, explained the speaker
choice on behalf of the Haas Center
for Public Service. Office for Religious
Life and ASSIi Speakers Bureau.
"He represents what I think a
Stanford education needs for the 21st
century â€” religious literacy, under
standing of the role religion plays in
the world and the ability to relate to
people of other traditions with empa
thy and work with them," McLennan
said.

In the wake of President Barack
Obama's inauguration. Patel described
the inspiration of the new president's
diverse heritage and applauded
Obama's emphasis on the patchwork
multicultural heritage of the U.S.
"It is that very patchwork heritage
that is a force for peace in the world,"
he said.
Patel described how watching peo
ple of all faiths praying together for the
nation in the Presidential Inaugural
Prayer Service is what America needs
to embody for the current century.
Patel added that although remark
able. America's heritage is not without
blemishes. He urged the audience to
become interfaith leaders who embody
a vision, knowledge base and skill set
that can promote religious pluralism.
In response to a question posed
about the perception of conservatives
as part of the extremist tradition, Patel
insisted on the need to bring people of
all persuasions into interfaith discus
sion.

"If we're leaving them out, we're
having liberal cocktail parties." he said.
Patel offered a similar response to a
student who asked about the role of
nonbelievers in the movement for reli
gious pluralism by saying that secular
humanists are quick to quote from
Whitman and Thoreau and still have a
particular path that leads toward plu
ralism.
In the ultimate fight against extrem
ists and to answer to those who claim
religious homogeneity is most effi
cient. Patel stressed that pluralists have
to organize and use the same rhetorical
tactics as the extremists to convey their
message.
"If [extremists] have their knowl
edge base at the tips of their tongues,
then [pluralists] have to have our
knowledge base at the tips of our
tongues," he said. "If we don't, we for
feit the terrain."
Speaking on the War on Terror.
