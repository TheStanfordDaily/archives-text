### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Martin S. Indyk,a key Middle East expert and ambassa
dor to Israel during the Clinton administration, delivered a
lightly publicized talk at Stanford on Tuesday night. He
expressed regret over his unsuccessful diplomacy during
the Clinton years and offered praise of President Barack
Obama's handling of the Gaza crisis.
Although his role in the Obama administration is not

yet clear. Indyk will like
ly exert significant influ
ence over new Secretary
of State Hillary Clinton's
thinking.
Indyk served as the
top Middle East advisor
on President Bill
Clinton's National
Security Council in the
19905, when he outlined
his "dual containment"
policy regarding Iraq
and Iran. He also recent
ly advised Hillary
Clinton's presidential
campaign.
Indyk praised President
Obama's strong pledge to
restart efforts toward a
comprehensive Arab-
Israeli peace deal after
years of "war-making"
under former President
Bush. However, he
simultaneously offered
criticism of Clinton's

actively interventionalist doctrine, labeling the approach as
arrogant and naive.
"They both failed because of naivete and innocence,"
Indyk said. "There was the feeling that there was a special
mission to go in and change things during both presiden
cies. There was ignorance of the deep differences between

us and them and the atavistic, trib
alistic nature of the people in these
ancient lands."
Indyk recounted that his team of
negotiators narrowly failed to
finesse a peace deal between Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad and
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
due to poor timing. Both individual
ly agreed to a peace agreement —
although at different moments in
late 1999 and early 2000.
Indyk repeatedly called on the
Obama administration to seize the
opportunity, if possible, to complete
the unfinished task of bringing
Syria into the coalition of Western-

allied Arab countries and out of the
orbit of Iran, which he unequivocal
ly regarded as hostile.
Iran poses a threat not simply
because of its aspirations toward
regional dominance. Indyk said, but
also because of the "potent message
it sends to Arab Street: that our way
— violence, terror, defiance of the
international community —
works."
Indyk has publicly blamed the
recent crisis and the Israel-Hamas
ceasefire's collapse on Palestinian
militants in Gaza. He remains a
steady proponent of the two-state
solution that has lost currency
amidst the bleak outlook after the
devastation of the Gaza war. It is
Obama prerogative, Indyk said, to
"re-inject hope" into the viability of
the proposal.
Bv the time he served Clinton.

Indyk had already worked as a
research director at the American
Israel Political Action Committee
and founded the pro-Israel
Washington Institute for Near East
Policy, a personal history that
undermined Clinton's appearance
of objectivity during the peace
negotiations, critics noted at the
time.
The Kresge Auditorium talk was
scheduled to promote "Innocents
Abroad." Indyk's memoir of Bill
Clinton's peace efforts, out this
month. Hie event was sponsored by
the Stanford-Israel Alliance in con
junction with Hillel at Stanford.The
audience included few students;
mostly elderly community members
attended.
