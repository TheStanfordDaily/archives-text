## Coalition fights for sweat-free Stanford 
### AMANDA ZHANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hie Sweat-Free Stanford Coalition met
last night to continue its light to ensure
that Stanford apparel is not made in sweat
shops, drawing more than 30 student atten
dees.
Ilie Coalition's immediate goal is for
Stanford to join the Designated Suppliers
Program (DSP), which consolidates facto
ries that manufacture university apparel,
develops a factory approval process and

grants these factories guaranteed con
tracts.
Since the DSP is not yet public, it is
heavily dependent on the support of uni
versities that hold the licenses to their
names and that therefore have the power
to create change.
So far. 41 universities have issued pub
lic statements backing the DSP â€” among
them are Columbia, Brown. Cornell and
all I Jniversity of California campuses.
"Wc brought up the DSP at our first
meeting with the administration two wars

ago, and have been bringing it up continu
ously since then," said Dan Shih '09. who
presented at the meeting along with Pahua
ChaMO.
Susan Weinstein, the director of trade
mark licensing at Stanford, believes
Stanford has already taken steps to ensure
workers' rights.
"Stanford decided to implement a pro
gram that supports our belief that workers
are entitled to a healthy, safe, secure and
fair working environment," Weinstein said.
"Our implementation of this program...

was the result of
our collabora
tion with the
very committed
Coalition mem
bers to explore ant

understand the issues and our
options."

In the past two years. Stanford
has joined the Fair Labor Association

and the Worker Rights Consortium



BECCA DEL MONTE/
The Stanford Doily
(WRC). and adopted a Code of
Conduct that requires all companies
which manufacture products with the
Stanford brand to use factories that
follow fair labor standards.
"I organized a task force consist
ing of my counterpart at a number of
universities across the U.S."
Weinstein said, "and we are now in
the process of developing and imple
menting a set of procedures which
will allow universities to understand
whether their licensees are capable of
complying with their contractual
obligations to ensure their products
are manufactured in a fair and safe
working environment."
Still, the Coalition believes that
these changes are encouraging, but
not enough.
"Stanford itself has, 1 believe,
3,460 factories around the world pro
ducing Stanford apparel in some
capacity." Shih said."and that's all on
all seven continents, except
Antarctica."
Due to the Coalition's efforts two
years ago, Stanford is currently a part
of WRC. which performs unan
nounced investigations of factories.
"They find violations almost
invariably in every place they go to,"
Shih said. "For example, they
released a report of 35 factories that
they investigated, and all 35 had labor
violations. Seven of those factories

were actually Stanford factories."
"In those factories, there were
abuses in terms of preventing free
dom of association, physical abuse,
emotional abuse and sexual abuse,"
he added.
It is almost impossible to routine
ly check up on every factory around
the world, which is why the Coalition
believes in the need for the DSP.
According to Shih. each worker
makes an average of 25 cents per
sweatshirt, and merely doubling that
to 50 cents would result in a living
wage.
"Our plan is for Stanford to [sup
port] the DSP by the end of the
year," said Cynthia Liao '09, the pres
ident of the Coalition.
'Hie Coalition will meet again on
Thursday at 7 p.m. at the Asian
American Activities Center, next to
Old Union. It is also planning a rally
for the following week.
