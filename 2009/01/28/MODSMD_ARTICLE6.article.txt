## Coalition fights for sweat-free Stanford 
### AMANDA ZHANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Hie Sweat-Free Stanford Coalition met
last night to continue its light to ensure
that Stanford apparel is not made in sweat
shops, drawing more than 30 student atten
dees.
Ilie Coalition's immediate goal is for
Stanford to join the Designated Suppliers
Program (DSP), which consolidates facto
ries that manufacture university apparel,
develops a factory approval process and

grants these factories guaranteed con
tracts.
Since the DSP is not yet public, it is
heavily dependent on the support of uni
versities that hold the licenses to their
names and that therefore have the power
to create change.
So far. 41 universities have issued pub
lic statements backing the DSP â€” among
them are Columbia, Brown. Cornell and
all I Jniversity of California campuses.
"Wc brought up the DSP at our first
meeting with the administration two wars

ago, and have been bringing it up continu
ously since then," said Dan Shih '09. who
presented at the meeting along with Pahua
ChaMO.
Susan Weinstein, the director of trade
mark licensing at Stanford, believes
Stanford has already taken steps to ensure
workers' rights.
"Stanford decided to implement a pro
gram that supports our belief that workers
are entitled to a healthy, safe, secure and
fair working environment," Weinstein said.
"Our implementation of this program...

was the result of
our collabora
tion with the
very committed
Coalition mem
bers to explore ant

understand the issues and our
options."

In the past two years. Stanford
has joined the Fair Labor Association

and the Worker Rights Consortium
