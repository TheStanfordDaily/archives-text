## President meets with GOP about economic stimulus bill Obama visits Hill Republicans

On the eve of a key vote. Presi
dent Barack Obama privately prom
ised Republicans he stands ready to
accept changes in the $825 billion
economic stimulus legislation, in
voked Ronald Reagan to rebut con
servative critics and urged lawmak
ers to "put politics aside" in the inter
est of creating jobs.
"The American people expect ac
tion " Obama said Tuesday as he
shuttled between closed-door meet
ings with House and Senate Republi
cans on a trip to the Capitol that
blended substance with political
symbolism.
Republicans who attended the
sessions said the president did not
agree to any specific changes but did
pledge to have his aides consider
some that GOP lawmakers raised
dealing with additional tax relief for

businesses.
Prodded to budge on another
point.Obama said that despite oppo
sition. he will insist on giving relief to
wage-earners who pay Social Securi
ty taxes but do not earn enough to
owe income tax.
In a measure of the complex polit
ical dynamic in Congress. House Re
publican leaders urged their rank
and file to oppose the stimulus meas
ure hours before Obama arrived.
One Republican later quoted the
president as saying any changes
would have to come after the House
gives what is expected to be largely
party-line approval Wednesday to
the Democratic-backed bill. Debate
began late in the day on the measure,
which includes about $550 billion in
spending and roughly $275 billion in
tax cuts. Democrats made one small
change, voting to delete $20 million
intended for renovating the National
Mall. Republicans had criticized the

expenditure as wasteful.
In the Senate, traditionally more
bipartisan than the House, a com
panion bill grew to roughly $900 bil
lion. That included a new tax break
for upper middle-income taxpayers,
at a one-year cost of $70 billion.
Democratic leaders in both hous
es have promised to have legislation
ready for Obama's signature by mid-
February. and Tuesday s develop
ments coincided with fresh evidence
of deterioration in a national econo
my seemingly growing weaker by the
day.
Housing prices tumbled by the
sharpest annual rate on record in No
vember, according to a closely
watched private report released dur
ing the day.and a measure of con
sumer confidence dropped to a his
toric low.
Separately, the Treasury Depart
ment announced distribution of $386
million to 23 troubled banks, the first

awards from the federal bailout fund
since Obama took office a week ago.
Obama traveled to and from the
Capitol in a snowy motorcade on
Tuesday, far different from the inau
gural parade seven days earlier. This
was a business trip, marking his sec
ond reach across party lines in as
many days in keeping with a pledge
to seek bipartisan solutions to major
problems.
One Republican senator, speak
ing on condition of anonymity, said
the president pledged to Sen. John
Ensign. R-Nev., to have aides review
two specific proposals. One would
affect businesses that pav down their
debt.
