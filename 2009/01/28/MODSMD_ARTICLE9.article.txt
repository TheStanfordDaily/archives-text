Israeli warplanes hit Gaza tunnels
Israeli warplanes pounded smuggling tunnels
under the Gaza-Egypt border early Wednesday, a
day after a Palestinian bomb killed an Israeli sol
dier and the Israeli military vowed to respond
harshly to any further attacks.
The border flare-up — 10 days into an informal
cease-fire — came just hours before President
Barack Obama's new Mideast envoy was due to
meet Israeli leaders. The soldier was killed on Is
raels frontier with the Gaza Strip by a roadside
bomb planted on the Gaza side and set off by re
mote control, the military said. Three other mem

hers of the Israeli squad patrolling the border were
injured.
FBI tapes played for Illinois impeach
ment trial
Gov. Rod Blagojevich was hundreds of miles
away, but his voice captivated the Illinois Senate
Tuesday as impeachment prosecutors played FBI
wiretaps of conversations in which he seems to de
mand campaign contributions in exchange for
signing legislation.
One person on the recordings assures Blagoje
vich that a horse-racing track owner "is good for
it"and just has to decide "what accounts to get it
out of." Another assures him the track owner

knows he must keep his "commitment" soon.
Blagojevich replies with comments like
"good" and "good job." Legislation sought by the
racing industry had been sent to the governor's
desk, and on the tapes, he says to reassure a racing
lobbyist he hopes "to do this, so we can get togeth
er and start picking some dates to do a bill-sign
ing."
Senators conducting the trial, which Blagoje
vich is boycotting though it could remove him
from office within days, listened intently as the
fuzzy, indistinct telephone conversations echoed
through the room — the heating system, reporters
typing on laptops and the occasional cough ac
counting for the onlv other noise.
