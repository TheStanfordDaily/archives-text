## Regular decision applications increase by 20% Total of 30,349 applicants apply to enter Stanford's Class of 2013 
### KATE ABBOTT 
The Stanford Office of Admission received a record
high 30,349 applications for the Class of 2013, represent
ing a 20 percent increase from last year's cycle.
Although applications to universities across the coun
try were expected to rise this application season, the num
ber of students competing for a spot in Stanford's next
freshman class is the largest in the University's history,
said Director of Admission Shawn Abbott in an email to
The Daily.
A University press release published earlier this
month noted that 25,000 students were expected to apply
by the regular decision deadline.
"The overall response to our outreach was clearly pos
itive if you look at application numbers alone," Abbott
said. "My hunch, however, is that Stanford's new financial
aid policies were the likely cause of such a surge in appli
cations."
Brown. Harvard, Duke and the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology also saw applicant pools increase
by more than 10 percent from last year. According to a
Bloomberg article, students are embracing the ease of a
common form by submitting applications to more univer
sities than in the past.
Stanford became a user of the Common Application
site in 2006, though applicants are also required to submit
a supplemental application form.
Ari Andersen, a senior at Malibu High School in
Southern California, applied to Stanford via regular deci
sion in addition to nine other schools. He said applying to
at least 10 colleges was normal for students in his senior
class, but applying to various institutions for fear of not
getting in is not a big issue.
"I applied to some University of California schools I
wouldn't necessarily have applied to if it wasn't for their
financial aid programs," Andersen said."l applied regular
decision [to all schools] because I wanted to keep my
options open."
Andersen speculated that the Stanford application
seems more appealing because of its availability and the
range of questions asked, including "questions about reg
ular life."
"The application process is repetitive, but [Stanford's]
application takes the whole student into account." he said.
In addition to Stanford's streamlined financial aid pro
gram. an updated outreach program including a pilot
interview process in six cities was implemented this
admission year. Abbott said it is "too early to tell" what
the impact of the optional interview process will be. but
that this and other outreach programs will be reevaluated
in the spring.
Although the applicant pool has increased substantial
ly this season, Abbott said even fewer students would be
offered a spot in next year's freshman class in an effort to
avoid over-enrolling, as the admission office did the past
two years.
"We will be very conservative with our admission
offers this year because we cannot over-enroll the fresh
man class this year." Abbott said. "We expect to admit
fewer students than we did last year."
"If we are under our enrollment target we will admit
students from the wait list." the admission director added.
