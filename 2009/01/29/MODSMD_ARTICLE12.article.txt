## Editorial Education funding desperately needed 
### 
On Wednesday, the House of Represen
tatives passed President Obama'ssBl9
billion economic stimulus package.
The package included $150 billion for educa
tion spending.an enormous increase for a fed
eral government that has traditionally dele
gated education funding to state and local
governments. Although this may seem like a
drastic measure, the editorial board supports
the increased funding for education and be
lieves it is necessary for the long-term security
of our economy.
First of all, t he st i m ulus package will direct
ly impact the lives of some Stanford students
by providing a $16 billion increase in funding
for Pell (irants.a financial aid program for stu
dents with the greatest economic need. At a
time when it is increasingly difficult to be com
petitive in the job market, the government
must do all that it can to help Americans af
ford higher education.
According to the Department of Educa
tion web site, the average Pell Grant currently
is only about $3(X H) — barely enough to make
a dent in the cost of a college education. An in
crease for this program is desperately needed,
and will help more students afford college as
well as assist universities such as Stanford in
maintaining their own commitments to finan
cial aid. The stimulus package will also pro
vide support to other college financial aid and
work-study programs.
The bulk of the education stimulus money,
however, will provide assistance to public pri
mary and secondary schools throughout the
country. Although they will not directly im
pact Stanford students, the editorial board is
equally supportive of these funding measures.
According to The New York Times, one
point of contention about the education stim

ulus is that it will provide funding for construc
tion projects meant to rebuild the infrastruc
ture of many public schools. 'ITiese sorts of
physical improvements have traditionally
been funded through state and local tax and
bond measures. However.given the recent de
cline in property values and the budget
crunches being faced by state and local gov
ernments, the editorial board supports the de
cision of the federal government to help fix
our crumbling schools. School renovations
also have the capacity to create jobs in the
construction industry.
ITie stimulus package also appropriately
targets education funding towards the most
vulnerable students. It will increase funding
for Title I programs for low-income students,
as well as special education and I lead Start.
These programs too often disproportionately
suffer from budget cuts.and although newspa
per headlines continue to focus on the down
fall of Wall Street tycoons and large invest
ment hanks, the burden of the bad economy
falls hardest on families who are already
struggling. Ensuring that students from low
income families continue to have educational
opportunities is surely a good use of the stim
ulus dollars.
The New York Times also pointed out that
several provisions in the package provide
windfall benefits to student lending compa
nies. Hie editorial board hopes that members
of Congress and President Obama will do
their best to eliminate needless measures and
corporate welfare from the stimulus package.
As a whole, however, we believe that the in
crease in education funding is necessary and
appropriate, and we hope that the legislation
is passed by the Senate and signed into law as
soon as possible.
