## A 						Super Bowl ad stimulus proposal 
### 
Punch Karl Rove in the nuts. I'm not
gonna lie. I really, really want to see Karl
Rove, or at least a Karl Rove imperson
ator, get punched in the cajones on Sunday. I
can see why you are confused, even though
you find yourself nodding in agreement. Alas,
you will soon understand.
In case you haven't noticed — and honest
ly. you probably haven't, given the recent
media focus on the economy, as well as our
newest President.the great Irishman O'Bama
(taken, of course, from the Gaelic phrase
meaning "the candidate who probably did not
get a single white vote in Alabama") — come
Sunday, the Super Bowl will once more be
upon us.
Last year's Super Bowl between the
would-be champion New York Giants and
New England Patriots was a TV ratings
dream. One team hailed from the city owning
the No. 1 media market in the United States,
and the other was aiming for a perfect season,
19-0. It was only natural that the game ended
up as the second-most-watched show in tele
vision history.
This year? Not so much.The football teams
hail from such media "powerhouse" cities as
Phoenix and Pittsburgh. For most of us who
are not football fanatics, or natives of these
two cities, there is little incentive to watch the
game for the game itself.
ITiank God. then, that the Super Bowl is
more than just a game. It has become the
Greatest Annual Spectacle in America. The
fireworks. Hie pomp.The pageantry.The pre
dictability of broadcaster Joe Buck suddenly
turning into Ben Stein crossed with a nar
coleptic at the height of the game's dramatic
tension (who could forget last year's "Man
ning gets away ... airs it down the field ... it is
... caught by Tyree"). 'lliese are all things we.
the fair-weather fans, anticipate with every
bone in our body.
Well, that and the commercials. Last year,
the Super Bowl ads did not live up to expecta
tions, [here were certainly some of them that
elicited a giggle here, or a muffled guffaw
there. Will Ferrell in '70s basketball booty
shorts got a rise out of me (so to speak). But
nothing truly memorable that will stand the
test of time, forever going down in Super Bowl
commercial lore, came out of last year's group.
In other words, a dancing Robert Goulet ruin
ing his co-workers'days and kicking over their
files was nowhere to be found.
Iliis is the year for the ads to make a come
back. In that spirit. I humbly propose my three
dream Super Bowl ads.all of which,in the spir
it of the times, are political in nature. There will
be those of you who claim, after reading this
column, that it is unlikely anyone will be able
to tie these ideas to a real product.and that the

ad wizard who decides to spend three million
dollars (yes, that's the cost this year) airing any
of them will likely get fired. Of course, you are
correct. Now, be quiet and stop raining on my
imagination's parade.
Now, hack to my original point: I want to
see Karl Rove get punched. Below the belt
and between the legs. 1 know it can't really
happen on national television, but we can all
dream — or. at least, we can all hope that a
Karl Rove impersonator will be willing to sac
rifice his pride for 30 seconds of fame. I cannot
tell you why this is so important to me. It sim
ply is. If this happens, 1 will buy out the entire
stock of whatever product the commercial is
selling. You hear that.Etrade?
I also feel a strong desire to see a "Big
Lebowski" takeoff commercial in which John
Goodman walks atop the inauguration plat
form, picks up a wheelchair-ridden, black hat
wearing Dick Cheney, and confidently pro
nounces to America,"l've seen a lot ofspinals.
America, and this guy's a fake." I don't care
what the commercial is for. You can show me
that and then just Hash the Anheuser-Busch
icon for 25 seconds and I guarantee you I am
still laughing when the commercial ends. And
then I'm going out and buying a beer.
Of course, both sides of the political aisle
must be considered fair game, lest the televi
sion advertisers, or this columnist, be ratted
out as having pro-hope bias. Now. I may have
my political views, but 1 know that fairness re
quires you to give as good as you get. So. I
begin my final submission with a simple ques
tion: What happens when you combine a bur
rito with a taco?
I'll give you five seconds.
Still haven't got a clue?
You get a Burraco.
Not just any Burraco, though. Imagine how
your stomach feels 15 minutes later, and you
get the idea.That's right: you just ate a Burra
co Bomber.
You see that "c" I just drew in the air and
circled? That means this idea is copyrighted.
It's a guaranteed cash cow. but I'm willing to
sell it for the right price.
Yes. I 'm looking at vou.Taco Bell.
