## STANFORD'S STALWART For nearly two decades, Luke Feist and the wrestling mat have been one 
### ZOE LEAVITT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For Luke Feist. 74 wins throughout his col
lege career have him nearing ninth place on
Stanford's all-time wins rankings. But the sen
ior captain already has a much longer
wrestling career than any record could show.
When he was five years old. Feist followed
his brother to watch a friend wrestle, and it
was his first experience with the sport he'd
come to call his own.

"My older brother thought it was cool."
Feist said."so I thought it was cool."
That day sparked a passion now in its 19th
year. Together with his brother and several
other kids. Feist joined a team, and they re
mained together all through middle school
and high school.
"By the time we were juniors and seniors
in high school, it was really pretty special."
Feist said. "We all grew up together, so that
was a hard thing to leave behind in college."

Pac-10.1 lis 15-9 record so far this season can
not convey both the growth and consistency
of performance he has experienced through
his four years. After redshirting his first sea
son. Feist burst onto the scene in 2005-2006 to
win his first dual match 8-0. His 17 victories
that season included an upset of the 2005 Pac
-10 Champion at University Nationals, and he
also tied for second on the team in pins. Pin
ning opponents would prove to be one of
Feist's most valuable skills.

In his second season of competition. Feist
earned 25 wins and scored 41 points in dual
matches, third-best on the team. He won two
prestigious distinctions, a Pac-10 All-Acade
mic Honorable Mention and NWCA All
- honors. Furthermore, for placing
fourth individually in the Pac-10, Feist gained
one of nine wildcard spots in the NCAA
Championships.

Since winning his first dual match in 2005-2006, senior Luke Feist has put together an enviable resume, including All-American honors and NCAA Championship-qualifying performances.
NCAA Championships and this
time he won his first match. He also
continued to climb the Pac-10 lad
der. I laving placed fifth in the Pac-10
Championships his freshman year
and fourth his sophomore year. Feist
reached third place in 2008, achiev
ing a 3-1 record in the tournament.
In retrospect. Feist chalks up his
improved performance to confi
dence. and hopes to continue his
climb toward Pac-10 and NCAA
glory this season.
"There's really no reason two
years ago I couldn't have won a
championship match, [but mentally]

I wasn't ready." he said. "Last year. I
came back thinking. ' This isn't that
big a deal.'"
11l at mentality helped Feist im
prove and win an NCAA match.
Now he knows that mastering the
psychological aspect of the sport is
just as important as physical practice.
"Pretty much everyone knows
how to wrestle at this point in col
lege," Feist said. "It really all comes
down to confidence ... with experi
ence. confidence boosts."
Feist, in his second year as a team
captain, applies this philosophy of
mental strength to the entire team.
I lis leadership as captain is especial
ly important this year, as almost the
entire team consists of freshmen and
sophomores. One of the underlying
issues of the team so far this season
has been how to draw together so

many young wrestlers and create a
cohesive lineup.
"The thing with freshman is that
sometimes they come in. really tal
ented. and suddenly they get heat
and their confidence gets shaken to
the floor" Feist said. "Through my
four years, it's been [about] realizing
that [importance of confidence]."
As the team now enters the sec
ond half of the season with a full
lineup, thanks to healed injuries,and
individual wrestlers start to im
prove. Feist looks forward to the
near future as a crucial turning
point.
"We're a really young team but I
don't think that necessarily hurts
us." he said. "A lot of guys are really
close to turning the corner. 4-5 loss
es that could have been 5-4 wins.
Hopefully, once we get to the con

ference championships, those
matches will be 8-0,"
Needing only five more wins to
reach fifth place on Stanford's all
time career win chart and one more
pin to reach fifth on the career pin
chart. Feist has a lot to look forward
to over the remainder of the season.
"This year. I know the only thing
that can come between me and my
goals is me." he said.
For the redshirt senior from
Standpoint, his last year on the Farm
could be his best. ITiere's only one
step left to take, and after four years
of drawing closer and closer to a
conference championship and post
season glory, this year. Feist has the
confidence to net there.
