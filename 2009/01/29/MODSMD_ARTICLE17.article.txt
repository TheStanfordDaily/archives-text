## Cardinal does away with Davis Women shut out Aggies in first dual-match 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After garnering no first-place
votes in the first ITA polls, the No. 5
Stanford women's tennis team has
responded in resounding fashion.
A day after the men's team rout
ed Sacramento State 7-0. the Cardi
nal women followed with its third
straight shut-out of UC-Davis to
open its dual-match season.
Stanford had an auspicious start,
quickly capturing the doubles point
with all three wins by a score of 8-0.
8-2 and 8-1.
"We tried to set a statement in the
double." head coach Lele Forood
said. "We wanted to come out very
aggressive, hitting the ball hard early
and hopefully putting them on their
heels. We were able to do that and
that carried over into singles."
And in singles. Stanford did not
disappoint.
Coming off a close loss to top
ranked Maria Mosolova of North
western in the finals of the NCTC.
sophomore Hilary Barte cruised
with a 6-2. 6-2 victory. After leading
the Cardinal at the top of the lineup
last season, Barte continues to set the
tone for the squad.

"It felt awesome." Barte said. "I
was excited about getting out there.
We haven't had a dual match in for
ever and I saw the men play which
made me more excited to get back
out with the team."
Stanford's No. 2. senior co-cap
tain-Jessica Nguyen, shutout her op
ponent 6-0. 6-0. Rounding off the
top-half of the lineup, fellow co-cap
tain, junior Lindsay Burdette won 7-
6.6-1.
"Lindsay ran into a girl who did a
really good job in the first set with
pressure, and it took her a little
longer to get control of her match."
Forood said. "But everyone did a
nice job from the onset."
Meanwhile, sophomore Carolyn
McVeigh prevailed 6-0. 6-2, and
freshmen Veronica Li and Courtney
Clayton won their first career dual
matches. 6-0.6-1 and 6-1. 6-0 respec
tively.
By inserting two freshmen in the
lineup so early in the season, Forood
showed much confidence in her
young squad.
"It's nice to get that first match
out of the way. not just from the play
ing standpoint but from the proce
dural standpoint." Forood said. "It's
so much different from playing a
tournament. It's important to get
everyone acclimated to what the tim
ing of everything is â€” warm-ups are
totally different, team meeting and
going over the other team."
