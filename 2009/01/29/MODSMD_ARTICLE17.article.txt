## Cardinal does away with Davis Women shut out Aggies in first dual-match 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After garnering no first-place
votes in the first ITA polls, the No. 5
Stanford women's tennis team has
responded in resounding fashion.
A day after the men's team rout
ed Sacramento State 7-0. the Cardi
nal women followed with its third
straight shut-out of UC-Davis to
open its dual-match season.
Stanford had an auspicious start,
quickly capturing the doubles point
with all three wins by a score of 8-0.
8-2 and 8-1.
"We tried to set a statement in the
double." head coach Lele Forood
said. "We wanted to come out very
aggressive, hitting the ball hard early
and hopefully putting them on their
heels. We were able to do that and
that carried over into singles."
And in singles. Stanford did not
disappoint.
Coming off a close loss to top
ranked Maria Mosolova of North
western in the finals of the NCTC.
sophomore Hilary Barte cruised
with a 6-2. 6-2 victory. After leading
the Cardinal at the top of the lineup
last season, Barte continues to set the
tone for the squad.

"It felt awesome." Barte said. "I
was excited about getting out there.
We haven't had a dual match in for
ever and I saw the men play which
made me more excited to get back
out with the team."
Stanford's No. 2. senior co-cap
tain-Jessica Nguyen, shutout her op
ponent 6-0. 6-0. Rounding off the
top-half of the lineup, fellow co-cap
tain, junior Lindsay Burdette won 7-
6.6-1.
"Lindsay ran into a girl who did a
really good job in the first set with
pressure, and it took her a little
longer to get control of her match."
Forood said. "But everyone did a
nice job from the onset."
Meanwhile, sophomore Carolyn
McVeigh prevailed 6-0. 6-2, and
freshmen Veronica Li and Courtney
Clayton won their first career dual
matches. 6-0.6-1 and 6-1. 6-0 respec
tively.
By inserting two freshmen in the
lineup so early in the season, Forood
showed much confidence in her
young squad.
"It's nice to get that first match
out of the way. not just from the play
ing standpoint but from the proce
dural standpoint." Forood said. "It's
so much different from playing a
tournament. It's important to get
everyone acclimated to what the tim
ing of everything is — warm-ups are
totally different, team meeting and
going over the other team."
While their nerves might seem
like those of seasoned veterans, even
Barte can remember what it was like
to play the first dual match of her ca
reer.
"1 know when I was a freshmen
for my first match 1 was so nervous,"
Barte said. "I think they handled it
well, and I'm excited to see what
they'll do in the future."
The match was not without some
friendly rivalry. UC-Davis' head
coach. Bill Maze, is a former Stan
ford player and good friend of
Forood.

"As long as he's been coaching,
we've always tried to play," Forood
said."We've known each other for 35
years since our freshman year. We're
good buddies and we like to get a
match on our schedule as much as
possible."
Last year. Stanford was sched
uled to open their season against the
Aggies as well. But constant rain de
lays pushed the matchup to April,
their last regular season match.
This year, with a glimmer of sun
shine, Stanford took the opportunity
to warm up before their ITA Nation
al Team Indoor Qualifying match.
"It was nice because 1 wanted to
get this match played before the In
door qualifiers," Forood said. "We
both wanted to get this match
played sooner rather than a few

months later in the season. It was
good for both of our teams to play
today."
Stanford will host Colorado on
Friday afternoon. Though not much
is known about the Cardinal. Stan
ford showed that it can compete
with the best in the nation.
"The top of our lineup is very ex
perienced and has had a lot of suc
cess," Forood said. "I think we're as
good as anyone in the country, per
haps better at those spots."
With the competition facing
them in Madison.Wl, the Cardinal is
aware that only it's best efforts will
be accepted.
