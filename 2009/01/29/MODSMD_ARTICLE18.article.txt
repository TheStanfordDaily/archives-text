# Pleading for some mercy
## 
### 
Last week Micah Grimes, the
head coach of a girls' high
school basketball team in Dal
las. found himself in a difficult situa
tion. His team from the Covenant
School was scheduled to play the Dal
las Academy, a school with a total en
rollment of around 20. which hadn't
won a basketball game in years.
Clearly, this was a guaranteed win
for Covenant.The problem was decid
ing how to coach in a game that was
sure to be a blowout. Running up the
score against such a small school
would not only make Covenant look
bad. it would just plain be mean.
Unfortunately for Grimes, he was
n't able to find this balance.
When the game ended Dallas
Academy was still trying to get on the
score sheet. The final score? 1 (K)-().
The game made national news, hut
not because a high school team had
won by 100 points. The story was the
lack of sportsmanship on the part of
Grimes for allowing his team to run up
the score to that point. People who
were at the game said,even after hold
ing a 59-0 lead at the half, that the
Covenant players continued to steal
the ball, take three-pointers and occa
sionally use a full-court press.
On Friday Covenant school offi
cials issued a public apology to Dallas
Academy and formally requested that
they be able to retroactively forfeit the
game. On Sunday Grimes posted his
own statement online indicating that
he disagreed with the apology and that
he "played the game as it was meant to
be played" and did not intentionally
run up the score.
Later that same day the Covenant
School fired Grimes, but refused to
comment on if it was because of his
public disagreement over the apology.
The message to take from this story
is that there needs to be a "mercy rule"
in all sports below the college level. If
the athletes are still children, there
needs to be a mechanism to deal with
lopsided games like this.
Hut the reason this needs to hap
pen is not solely to protect young ath
letes from embarrassment.This is im
portant at this level of sports, but it is
just as important to protect the win
ning team as well.
If a mercy rule had been in place
Grimes would not have had to make a
decision on how to coach the game
and his players would not have been
involved in this. If Grimes had decided
to hold his players back, the game
would just end. Covenant would have
been declared the wiriner.and this en
tire situation would have been avoid
ed. Also. Grimes, who built the pro
gram from 2-19 four years ago to a
top-level program today, would still
have a job.
It doesn't matter how exactly the
mercy rule works: the game could end
if either team is ahead by at least 50 in
the second half or. as was the case
when I played youth basketball, the
scoreboard could simply be turned oil
when one team opened an insur
mountable lead near the end. I'll let
you guess which side of that lopsided
score my team was usually on.
Hut the point is that a 100-0 game
when the athletes are not profession
als. college students or even adults is
not fun for anyone involved. Sure, one
could argue that Dallas Academy
could have just forfeited the game part
way through, but this would have
added unnecessary embarrassment
and been against the traditions of
sportsmanship.
There needs to be protection for all
participants. Maybe Grimes didn't
handle it in the best possible way. but
his team did score only 12 of their 100
points in the fourth quarter. Did he de
serve to lose his job? Would it have
been better lor him to tell his players
to not run. not rebound, and not con
centrate on their shots?
rhere needs to be a mercy rule,
and after this event maybe more
leagues will institute one.There is no
national governing body for high
school or other youth athletics, so
each organization will need to deal
with this issue on its own. Hopefully
more leagues will institute such a rule
before something like this happens
again.
