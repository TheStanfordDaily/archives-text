NOTES Mitch Johnson, who missed the Ore
gon games lost weekend, will play against
the Los Angeles schools. The Trojans could
be without their top two offensive players, Taj
Gibson and Dwight Lewis, both of whom are
nursing injuries and illnesses The Cardinal's
3-4 conference record puts it in a tie for sixth
in the Pac-10.

For the second time in 2009, the
Stanford men's basketball team will
have to take its show on the road in
the Pacific-10 Conference. Recent
outcomes would suggest that this
doesn't bode well for the Cardinal.
Stanford (13-4, 3-4 Pac-10)
opened its conference road schedule
three weeks ago to disheartening re
sults, dropping a pair of games at
Washington and Washington State
by just one point each. Stanford then
returned home for two weeks and
looked to be on the rebound, drop
ping then-No. 22 California 75-69 on
Jan. 17 and drubbing conference

doormat Oregon a week ago. 77-55.
But then, red-hot Oregon State
came to town. The Beavers (8-10,3-
5). who had just defeated Cal them
selves. walloped the Cardinal. 77-62.
And so the Stanford men find
themselves with their backs to the
wall once again.Their 3-4 conference
record puts them in a tie for sixth in
the Pac-10 standings, just below both
of the Southern California opponents
they will meet in the coming days, as
USC (13-6, 4-3) currently ranks fifth
in the conference and UCLA (15-4,5-
2) is in a three-way tie for second.
This weekend marks the midway
point of Stanford's Pac-10 season
after Saturday's matchup with
UCLA, the Cardinal will have
played nine conference games with
nine to go.
But perhaps more importantly
for a team that isn't vet out of the

running for a spot in the NCAA
Tournament, this weekend marks a
crucial opportunity to impress the
selection committee with a road vic
tory over quality conference oppo
nents. Including this weekend's pair
of games. Stanford has just seven
road contests left in its regular sea
son.
"It's important for a lot of rea
sons. including that." Johnson said to
The Mercury News regarding this
weekend. "But it's important just he
cause this league is a race and right
now we're at the bottom of it. trying
to keep pace with a lot of teams that
are playing better than us. It's defi
nitely going to be an extremely diffi
cult challenge (this weekend].but we
need to pull things together."
One big step toward the Cardinal
