Cardinal program have not matched the success of the
championship-winning Stanford
teams of the past. But with good
young talent and seasoned veterans,
this year's Stanford team is ready to
get back to being the winning pro
gram it has been for much of its histo
ry-
ITie first match ot the mini-tour
nament will be the top-seeded Stan
ford against No. 4 Boise State fol
lowed by No. 3 Vanderbilt versus No.
2 Auburn. The winners of the two
matches will face each other on Sun

the ITA Indoor Tournament.
Boise State is 3-1 on the season,
ranked No. 37 in the nation.They beat
No. 14 Pepperdine this season on the
road, hut fell to No. 4 UCLA two days
later. They feature senior Clancy
Shields, the No. 22 ranked player in
the nation and No. 85 Stanley Sara
panich. Stanford defeated Boise
State last year in a rain-delayed
marathon dual match. 4-3.
Vanderbilt, ranked No. 2/ in the
country, has no currently ranked sin
gles players, but Adam Baker and
Alex Zotov are the No. 32 ranked
doubles team in the nation
Auburn is ranked No.29,and features
AlexeyTsyrenov, ranked No. 48.They
also have two highly ranked doubles

teams:Tsyrenov and 11m Puetz at No.
10 in the nation, and Lukas Marsoun
and Alexander Stamchev at No. 19.
Neither Vanderbilt nor Auburn
has played a dual match this season.
"(Boise State] has always wanted
us to play up there," Whitlinger said.
"This is going to be a big deal for
them. They are going to have a ton of
energy, have the crowd rolling. It will
be as tough of a match as we will have
all year long as far as everything in
volved."
"We [have to] come out with ener
gy, if we don't match their energy
we'll be in a little trouble."
Stanford has already a great win
this year, as senior Blake Muller was
named the Pac-10 Player of the Week
for his efforts in the Sherwood Cup
two weekends ago. Muller then
teamed up with junior Richard Wire
to win the doubles title last weekend,
knocking off the No. 2 doubles team
in the nation. It is the first weekly
award win for Muller.
Muller and his teammates will
take their best efforts up north this
weekend to try and qualify for the In
door Championships. It will not be
easy, but Whitlinger does not seem
too concerned.
"The goal is to win two matches up
there," he said." It's going to be a chal
lenge. But I have a pretty good team
to handle it."
