## STANFORD'S MAPLES MAGIC Cardinal seeks perfection at home 
### ERIK ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
Fresh off of a road sweep of the
Oregon schools last weekend. Stan
ford will return to Maples Pavilion
tonight to wrap up the first half of
conference play. The Cardinal will
face USC at 7 p.m. tonight, followed
by UCLA this Sunday at I p.m.
For No.Stanford (15-4.6-1 Pa
cific-10 Conference) the games will
be the first at home since the series
against the Washington schools
three weeks ago in which the Cardi
nal scored over 100 points in each
contest and defeated Washington
State by a Stanford- and confer
ence-record 77 points.
The Cardinal is perfect at home
so-far this season (7-0). has reached
100 points three times in those
seven home games and holds an av
erage margin of victory at Maples of
over 40 points (compared to just
over 10on the road).
"We defend Maples very well,"
junior center Jayne Appel said.
"Having the home crowd and sleep
ing in our own beds makes things
easier, but it is mostly a matter of
pride. We don't want to let anyone
come into our gym and take it from
us."
Neither USC (11-7. 5-2) nor
UCLA (14-4.5-2) has been particu
larly successful on the road this sea
son — the Trojans are 2-3 and the
Bruins are 3-3 — but that doesn't
mean victories will come easily for
the Card.
Both teams are 5-2 within the

conference, and sit just one game
behind Stanford and two behind
Pac-1() leader Cal. which is ranked
No. 7 nationally.
The Bruins have had a fairly soft
schedule so far and. outside of USC
and Arizona State, have only faced
the bottom of the Pac-1(). But they
have still piled up the wins and
their 14-4 overall record is just a
half-game behind Stanford's. The
Trojans struggled in December,
going just 3-4, but have won five of
their last seven and managed to
take No. 3 Duke to overtime before
falling 97-89.
Both teams are extremely ath
letic and. in I JSC's Camille LeNoir
and UCLA's Doreena Campbell,
boast some of the best guards in the
conference.
"This week will be a very big
challenge for us." head coach Para
VanDerveer said. "We will have to
handle the ball well and rebound
well to be successful. And LeNoir, I
think, is the best point guard in the
league — she's quick, she shoots
and passes well and just does it all.
And Campbell, she's just a sopho
more. but she is in the top five
[guards in the league] as well."
One advantage Stanford will
clearly possess, though, is in the
paint. Appel is the current U.S.
Bank Pac-1() Player of the Week
after averaging 20 points per game
last weekend and shooting an as
tounding 84.2 percent from the
floor in the series. It is the third time
she has been given the honor this
season, which leads all players.

NOIES: Stanford is perfect at home this sea

Appel is the reigning U.S. Bank Pac-10 Play
er of the Week and has won Ihe award three
times on the yeor. Both USC bnd UCLA sit
just one game behind Stanford in the confer
ence standings.
"Jayne was really efficient last
wee k e nd." Van De rvee r said. "She is
making her moves quickly, reading
the defense well and playing with a
lot of power. She gets to the free
throw line, doesn't back down and
plays physical. A lot of our team is
how Jayne does, and she is very de
pendable."
But the Cardinal knows that
Appel won't always be able to shoul
der the load on her own.
"We don't want
anyone to come
into our gym and
take it from us."
— JAYNE APPEL,
junior
"I want to see more contributions
from more people," VanDerveer
said. "When Jayne is getting doubled,
we will need to knock down perime
ter shots. The plan is to expand our
rotation."
If Stanford can get that done.
IJSC and UCLA will have to play
nearly flawless games to break up the
Card's perfect record in Maples.
These games are very important
for Stanford, as two games against
teams in the top of the conference al
ways are. But for the Cardinal play
ers. they are personal, as the team
still remembers last year's disastrous
Los Angeles road trip, when Stan
ford went 0-2.
"We still owe them from last
year," Appel said. "We lost down
there, and we still owe them some
thing."

NOIES: Stanford is perfect at home this sea
soaand has reached 100 points in three out
of its seven games Cardinal center Jayne
Appel is the reigning U.S. Bank Pac-10 Play
er of the Week and has won Ihe award three
times on the yeor. Both USC bnd UCLA sit
just one game behind Stanford in the confer
ence standings.
"Jayne was really efficient last
wee k e nd." Van De rvee r said. "She is
making her moves quickly, reading
the defense well and playing with a
lot of power. She gets to the free
throw line, doesn't back down and
plays physical. A lot of our team is
how Jayne does, and she is very de
pendable."
But the Cardinal knows that
Appel won't always be able to shoul
der the load on her own.
"We don't want
anyone to come
into our gym and
take it from us."
— JAYNE APPEL,
junior
"I want to see more contributions
from more people," VanDerveer
said. "When Jayne is getting doubled,
we will need to knock down perime
ter shots. The plan is to expand our
rotation."
If Stanford can get that done.
IJSC and UCLA will have to play
nearly flawless games to break up the
Card's perfect record in Maples.
These games are very important
for Stanford, as two games against
teams in the top of the conference al
ways are. But for the Cardinal play
ers. they are personal, as the team
still remembers last year's disastrous
Los Angeles road trip, when Stan
ford went 0-2.
"We still owe them from last
year," Appel said. "We lost down
there, and we still owe them some
thing."
