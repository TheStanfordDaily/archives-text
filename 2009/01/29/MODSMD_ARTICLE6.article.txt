## Mamet talks worldview Playwright questions educational values, audience 
### LIZ STARK STAFF WRITER 
Playwright and screenwriter David Mamet struck a
strange chord at Wednesday night's speaker event in
Memorial Auditorium. While titled "Art, Politics,
Judaism and the Mind of David Mamet," his speech
instead questioned the values of a university educa
tion. as well as the worldview of audience members.
Mamet's formal speech, which he noted he had writ
ten that morning, challenged his audience to examine
their "prejudices" and critiqued what he termed "the
coterie of the academic world."
"A liberal arts education, while it may theoretically
teach skills, also delays the matriculation of the adoles
cent into society." Mamet said.
He also attributed this phenomenon to the world of
show business.
"There's no way to approximate failure in front of a
paying audience." Mamet said. "Actors and writers stay
in school to spare themselves that lesson. They stay in
school because they don't know any better."
He went on to compare students learning from pro
fessors at universities to rats pulling levers for pellets
of food.
"In the wider world, the path to food is a little bit
more demanding, and it can't be learned inside the lab,
because you can't keep pulling the lever once the lab
workers are gone." Mamet said. "Why then should I.
raised in captivity, even question the content that got
me food?"
Mamet then connected this concept of pellets as
food to "group recognition symbols" that divide
humanity into distinct groups politically.
"Power can allow one to state a vision of the world
which can be reduced to a bumper sticker." Mamet
noted.
During the question and answer session, he echoed
this sentiment again: "Someone puts up a good enough
bumper sticker, and we say. you know what, take my
money."
Mamet also connected this to incorrect, empty con
ceptions of intelligence, kindness and justice.
"We're pulling the lever of reward for the right
answer, and we feel more intellectual because we give
a [homeless man] two dollars, and we know Thomas
Jefferson was an adulterer." Mamet said of the conven
tional definition of kindness.
"If we identify every interaction as having a victim
and an oppressor, and we get a pellet when we find the
victims, we're training ourselves away from the ability
to see cause and effect." he added. "Is there, in fact,
another view of the world in which not everything
need be reduced to victim and oppressor?"
Mamet emphasized the importance of confronting
one's biases and developing a capacity for original
thought.
"Society functions in a way much more interesting
than the multiple-choice habit we've been learning in
school." he said. "You're not going to learn it in school,
and you're not going to start until we start to discount
our own prejudices."
Continuing with his metaphor. Mamet said. "The
way of life is not to choose the right lever, but to learn
how to support ourselves when there aren't any
levers."

The tenor of Mamet's responses in the question and
answer session was noticeably different, distinguished
by his candor and his struggle to hear audience mem
bers.
Mamet's critique of higher education was more
pointed in his responses, as he said. "I don't know why
people are paying money to discuss [the issues] at col
lege.
"1 think the purpose of college is to learn a trade to
support yourself." Mamet added.
Responding to a question about the "psychological
depth" of his work, he said, "Psychological depth is a
huge pain in the ass: it's vastly overrated."

Mamet's attitude towards theatre also became more
apparent when asked about the work of current play
wrights, and which he might read and enjoy.
"1 don't go to the theatre because I can't leave ... il
I go to a play and I don't like it.it drives me crazy," he
said. "Read a J. Crew catalog, because you're always
going to find something new."
Mamet's personal insights — "I'm a bad liar," "I sit
by myself all day,""I don't really talk to people" and
"natural social discourse 1 never really learned" —
were consistent with an explanation of his own writing.
