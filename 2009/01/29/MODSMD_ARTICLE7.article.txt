## Fundraising high despite economy 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
In spite of the recent economic
downturn. Stanford remains on pace
to meet the goals of its ambitious
Stanford Challenge fundraising cam
paign. The University-wide cam
paign, announced by President John
Hennessy in October 2006, seeks to
raise $4.3 billion over the course of
five years.
At the beginning of the current
school year, the campaign had
already raised $3.8 billion. That fig
ure now exceeds $4 billion — the
most money ever raised by a
University in a single campaign.
In recent years, Stanford has been
the most successful fundraising uni
versity in the nation, raising $785 mil
lion from 72.217 donors in the last fis
cal year, and $832 million the year
before. Both years, it topped the list
of university fundraisers.
"This success comes down to our
extraordinarily loyal alumni and
their strong endorsement of the ini
tiatives the University is pursuing."
said Provost John Etchemendy. "We
could not succeed if alumni didn't
value what they received from
Stanford, or if they didn't like where
the University is going."
The program was instituted to
seek solutions to pressing global
challenges and to enhance the educa
tion of future leaders.
"The scope and complexity of
social and scientific challenges has

grown immensely in recent decades."
Hennessy said at the time the
Stanford Challenge was announced.
"Our goal for The Stanford
Challenge is nothing short of build
ing a university for the 21st century
and beyond — a university that will
better serve the world through the
quality, impact and vision of its
research, and through the new gener
ation of leaders it will produce."
The challenge has three compo
nents. First, multidisciplinary initia
tives aim to make advances in
human health, environmental sus
tainability and international affairs.
The program also seeks to sustain
Stanford's standard and breadth in
teaching and research through
annual giving. Finally, other initia
tives seek to strengthen undergradu
ate programs, engage students in the
arts through exhibitions and per
formances and improve K-12 educa
tion.
Still, just like almost every other
aspect of the economy, Stanford's
fundraising is sure to be adversely
affected by the nationwide recession.
"Of course the recession will slow
down our fundraising," Etchemendy
noted. "When people see their per
sonal assets decline by 30,40 percent
or more, they can't afford to be as
generous in their giving, however
much they want to support the
University. We understand that."
