DEAR DR. PAUL,
I've been having trouble lately getting my boyfriend to have an orgasm.
This is my first boyfriend and I don't really have much experience.
Dear Sandwich Hands,
I sympathize with your dilemma. Sometimes it can be very difficult ad challenging to get a man to climax. As they say the
male orgasm is a vicious and strange beast. Here is my step by step approach for success:
Step one: First find the penile organ. Sometimes this can be difficult due to an excessive quantity of pubic hair. However,
after you have found the penis things are pretty much downhill from there.
Step two: Get the penis erect. This can be accomplished in a number of ways but generally is not too complicated. Most
often a simple makeout session will do the trick. Although for those men that are more experienced some drastic measures
may need to be taken, like blowing in his ear or telling him that he has the biggest Johnson you've ever felt.
Step three: This is what I call the money step. After the erect penis has been adequately stimulated, you have two choices.
Either go for the home run and milk the prostate or stay with the boring old hum drum hand job. To milk the prostate
simply stick one of your digets in the man's anus and gently massage. Take it from me this is guranteed to work.
Step four: clean up. After you have given your man the greatest pleasure he has ever known in both sphincter and mind,
you need to destory the evidence so you roommate doesn't fond out what you've just done. I find that a t-shirt works best
especially an old one because they are more absorbant than a whole role of bounty.
Cumgradulatioms. Victory is yours.

Got a burning question you can't ask anyone else?
