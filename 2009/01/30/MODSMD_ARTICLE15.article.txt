# MUSiC REVIEW
## Recent EP a promising follow-up for Bon Iver 
### 
In their 2008 debut album,"For Emma, Forever Ago," Bon
lver exploded onto the indie music scene with one of the
most haunting sounds that listeners have heard for a very
long time. The album was characterized by Justin Vernon, the
singer and songwriter behind Bon lver, utilizing intense and
complex emotions mixed with interesting, creative and
dream-like vocals. "For Emma, Forever Ago" was wildly pop
ular, becoming a mainstream crossover embraced by lovers of
all types of music.
Most recently, Bon lver has released a new EP entitled

Animal Collective's "Merriweather Post Pavillion" is
undoubtedly the group's best work and likely one of
the best albums of the year. The group's ninth album
is a true masterpiece in which Animal Collective finally tran
scends genre barriers that have held it down for so long.
Since their first album, "Spirit They're Gone, Spirit
They've Vanished," Animal Collective have been recognized
for their talented musicians and unique pop experimenta
tion. Unfortunately, the noise pop genre has always been on
the fringes of the indie rock radar, and it took them many

"Blood Bank." "Blood Bank" borrows many characteristics
and techniques used on the last album, in a way that almost
makes the four songs on the EP sound like outtakes from
"For Emma, Forever Ago," but not necessarily in a "these were
excluded from the album for a reason" sort of way. Rather,
these newly released songs, which were recorded over a cou
ple of years and in many different locations, are an enhance
ment to any Bon Iver fan's collection, and make an excellent
addition to the already phenomenal debut album.
Three out of the four tracks on "Blood Bank" are very
similar to the sounds already used in "For Emma, Forever
Ago." The title track is arguably the best on the El'. With its
dark and wintry sound, the lg evokes images of a shim
mering forest with snow lightly falling around barren tree
branches. It's this feeling, combined with interesting lyrics
and an understated percussion instrumentation, that make
this track stand out.
"Beach Baby" adds an element of the country sound,
paired with a waltz rhythm, making this short song an inter
esting, yet soothing, addition to Bon Iver's repertoire. The
track "mibys" slows the EP down with a lush ballad, combin
ing Vernon's signature falsetto vocals with a strangely insis
tent piano, making the combination both pleasant and unset
tling for the listener.
The strangest track, and that which strays farthest from
the sound of "For Emma, Forever Ago" is definitely "Woods."
It is this song where Vernon takes the largest artistic leap and
utilizes the programming so popular on Kanye West's "808s
and Heartbreak:" Auto Tune. This device automatically cor
rects pitch and can be used to warp vocals in a very distinct

own albums and drumstick hits that make your brain go
crazy — but in a good way!
I can honestly not stop glowing about this album. There i
is not a song on the album in which the full potential of
Animal Collective's musical abilities has not been reached.
And they do so without trying to conform to a singly 1
melody-oriented theme, as can be seen in the fifth song, 1
"Daily Routine," which features an ambient drone and a min
imalist drumbeat that drops out after the two-minute mark.
-One of the most interesting pieces is probably "Lion in a i

manner. Auto Tune and repetitive lyrics discreetly referencing
Vernon's time spent alone, writing in an abandoned
Wisconsin cabin, make this last track wonderfully strange. It
is left a cappella, with Vernon layering his own vocals and
harmonies over the same chorus, completely enveloping the
listener in vocals.
This experiment, along with the other three tracks that
comprise the "Blood Bank" EP, make a very successful and
interesting prelude to a sophomore full-length album for Bon
Iver. In fact, if you loved "For Emma, Forever Ago," (and seri
ously, who didn't?) the "Blood Bank" EP is definitely a neces
sary sampling of more of Justin Vernon's genius that needs to
be checked out.

Coma," the album's ninth song. It maintains the experimen
tal mixture of sounds that Animal Collective has repeatedly
employed, starting off with a didgeridoo and constantly mix
ing meter that starts out as seven-eight time. The song seems
to oscillate back and forth between a hectic chorus and mel
low verses that bring to mind the crashing of waves onto a
beach (possibly because there are some sounds that resemble
waves).
Normally I would try to pick a favorite song, but I actu
ally like every one on this album. They are very diverse —
