# Animal Collective gets it right on every track

### 
years before they developed a substantial following. In
fact, I had never heard of them before their successful
seventh album, "Feels,", which features one of my
favorite songs ever — "Grass."
But, good news! "Merriweather Post Pavillion" will
finally put the veteran group at the forefront of the
indie rock scene. The album has the same special intri
cacies that have always made Animal Collective attrac
tive and unique, but there is an added dimension of
melody that will attract evep less curious listeners. And
surprisingly, the album even hints at songs that you can
dance to, something I've never seen from them.
For instance, the album's final track,
"Brothersport," features a fantastic synthesizer jingle
that unwittingly makes your foot start to pat. By the
middle of the song, you are hit with a tidal wave of psy
chedelic insanity that makes every part of your body
want to move in different directions until full-out
dancing is inevitable. But don't worry. You'll love to
embrace this newfound sense of movement. There is a
magical interplay between the original melody; a siren;
a bass drum; some of those great swirling static noises
that band member, Panda Bear, has made famous in his

jumping from traditional Animal Collective experi
mentalism to dance-y pop to relaxed ambience in a
mellifluous yet wisely ordered way. 1 recommend this
album to everyone. It's so good, that if you don't like
this type of music, you should learn to. Just kidding.
But, this album will easily find a special place in the
-hearts of any curious music listener and, oddly
enough, mashup lover (although don't expect Sisqo's
"Thong Song" to show up anywhere on the album).
Nine stars, for sure!
