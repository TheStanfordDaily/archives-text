# Franz Ferdinand: Always sleazy, never easy
## 
### 
If Archduke Franz Ferdinand had been as hip
as his Glasgow successors, World War I
would have been decided in a dance-off.
Alas, old people are just never cool enough —
and the quartet's new record, "Tonight: Franz
Ferdinand," debuts just shy of 95 years too late.
(Better late than never?)
Historical fantasies aside, Scottish thumpers
Franz Ferdinand have returned to the rock club
and disco hall alike with their first album since
2005's sophomore effort, "You Could Have It So
Much Better." At a time when bands left and
right are turning to bass-heavy, pop-crossover
dance-alongs (see: ColdplayV'Vida la Vida,"The
Killers' "Fluman"), Franz Ferdinand's rockers
from Glasgow outgroove them all with a record
that often has more in common with house
music and techno than with their earlier rock
'n'roll hallmarks "Take Me Out" and "Do You
Want To."
So ... how did we get from hi-hat abusin',
left-foot movin' Franz to body-grindin', comput
er-minded Franz?
The story of "Lucid Dreams" can help us fig
ure out just what exactly is going on with this

album. Late last year, the band released the single "Lucid
Dreams" as an early teaser. The tune was classic Franz: mildly
danceable art rock, seductive melodies and a handful of Alex
Kapranos's ever-sexy yelps.
Enter "Tonight," and a new version of "Lucid Dreams."
Once a four-minute rock song, "Lucid Dreams" has trans
formed into an eight-minute acid-disco-house remix of its
former self; gone is the catchy, upbeat chorus, replaced by a
slithering, bass-driven exploration into quasi-psychedelic tex
tures. Where the original song ended, the new version plunges
into a three-minute synthesizer orgy that's pure house music,
through and through, with a little drums thrown in for good

measure.
"Can't Stop Feeling" picks up where the new "Lucid
Dreams" stops, with a keyboard riff that would make even
the prissiest dance-hall queen want to grind her hips into

the always sleazy but never easy boys of Glasgow.
In a sense, the transformation of "Lucid Dreams" illus
trates what has happened to Franz Ferdinand since we last
heard from them in 2005. The rough garage-rock element of
their first two albums has given way to polished but aggressive
synthesizers, blended with the core elements of that classically
sexy Franz sound.
Album opener "Ulysses" exploits the Archduke's new

groove in style, with an extra dose of seductive
whispering on Kapranos' part for good meas
ure ("Come on, let's get hiiiiiigh" and "Last
night was wiiiiiild"). "Twilight Omens"
rewrites the basics of 2004's "Auf Ausch;" this
time, Kapranos abandons themes of frustrat
ingly unrequited love to croon about writing
his hook-up's name on the back of his hand,
and even typing it upside-down on his calcula
tor like a dirty word.
Yet Franz preserves some of the softer and
sweeter elements of their last album, replacing
"You Can Have It'"s "Eleanor" with the can
didly tender "Katherine Kiss Me" and the first
minute or so of "Bite Hard." But if you're look
ing for a bunch of "Hey There, Delilahs," you
won't find them in this solid collection of
sweaty Scottish disco-rock tunes.
If Archduke Franz were alive today, there's
no doubt about what he would be like. He'd be
