# Yves Saint Laurent Exhibit at De Young: when fashion is the art
## 
### 
Yves Saint Laurent once said that his only
regret in life is that he did not invent
jeans. Because everything else there is in
the contemporary woman's outfit — from the
female tux Lc Smoking to the safari style and
the revolution in the silhouette of a dress — we
owe to him.
The 40-year retrospective at the De Young
Museum in San Francisco is dedicated to the
death of one of the last maestros of the daz- *
zling generation of couturiers, which includes
Coco Chanel, Christian Dior and Christobal
Balcnciaga. Saint Laurent stands proudly
among these geniuses due to his contributions
to the field of fashion, having taken clothing to
a new level and turned it into intellectual art.
The exhibit, which is set up like a giant
catwalk with bright lights targeting the visitor
in contrast with the dim lighting of the cloth-
I ing displays, takes one through the most sjgnifi-
I cant revolutions of Yves Saint Laurent. The
I exhibit contains more than 120 treasures that
I have created his brand's signature look. The
I evening gowns, which allowed women to reveal
their tender sensuality without appearing vul
gar, open the show and immediately bring the
visitor's attention to a long black lace dress with
two freshly pink satin bows planted at the top
of the hip and a wide cut which starts at the
I waist to expose the graceful leg in its entirety.

One of the couturier's
quotes on the wall —
"Nothing is more beautiful
than a nude body" — offers
a key to his successes with
the female audience as he
freed their bodies from the
traditional constraints of
clothing, making fashion
serve women instead of vic
timizing them through
uncomfortable styles.
By contrast, the natural

femininity of the gowns is offset by the design
er's androgynous tuxedos from the 19605, the
next portion of the exhibit, which for the first
time introduced women's pantsuits as legiti
mate eveningwear. Yves Saint Laurent's image
of 1966 — high-waist Bermuda shorts paired
with a long tuxedo jacket with a noticeable silk
bow, all black — was controversial. Women
wearing this outfit, most notably Nan
Kempner, were barred from entering restau
rants at the time. What contemporary women
take for granted was unheard of at the moment
of Saint Laurent's creations, and his genius lies
in offering generations of women an outfit that
symbolizes their emancipation.
But if the first part of the exhibit's gar
ments is dominated by a somber or mono-

chromc color scheme, the second part uncovers
the global palette of Yves Saint Laurent — the
artist — in its totality. This section of the show
presents his multicultural view on fashion by
juxtaposing the'haute couture African collec
tion of ultra-short dresses entirely knit of
wooden beads, and the Spanish-influenced
provocative female toreador costume and
bright red gypsy skirts, with the Russian collec
tion of boyar-stvled, gold embroidered, heavy
fabric outfits. Brought together, all these cul
tures reveal the extent of the couturier's imagi
nation which did not have borders, making
him a truly international creator.
The grand finale of the walk-through of

Saint Laurent's fashion palette is his
art-inspired creations: jewel-like
hand-beaded jackets in tribute to

Van Gogh's "Irises" and "Sunflowers;" a long
black skirt which bears the imprints of
Matisse's multi-colored leaves; a stellar fuchsia
tunic, strapless, with a wide-winged Braque
flamingo as its collar, evening harlequin ensem
bles taken from Picasso's Rose Period art with
their tender pink skirts in satin patchwork and
striking wide-sleeved, see-through blouses.
As a prominent art collector and an intel
lectual, Yves Saint Laurent could not help pro
jecting his cultural knowledge onto his works,
creating fashion that was also intellectual art.
