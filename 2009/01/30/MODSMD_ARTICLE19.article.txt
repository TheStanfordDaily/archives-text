"24" vs. "Lost" is one of the great
debates of our time. On the surface, it's cer
tainly a very competitive and compelling
match-up. Both shows have rabid fan bases,
start their seasons in January and star
badasses named Jack who never sleep or go
to the bathroom. It's an extremely close call,
right? Well, only one gimmicky serialized
drama can be king. In order to crown a
champion, let's look at this match-up com
pletely blindly and objectively — Pepsi chal
lenge-style. Here is a summary of a typical
episode of each program (with the names
taken off, of course). Let's see which one
sounds more interesting.
Show A: A bunch of people sit around
on an island waiting for something to hap
pen. They are all unrealistically good-looking
except for a fat guy with gross hair. There is a
flashback about a boring character's boring
life. Another character, someone who none ol
the viewers at home were really too invested
in, gets killed. Then everyone discovers
something TOTALLY SECRET AND REALLY
IMPORTANT. An old guy says something
philosophical.
Show B: A certain awesome government
agent runs around kicking ass. "Kicking ass"
can mean several different things, from play
ing a mean game of Russian Roulette to cut
ting several people's limbs off to biting a bad
guy in the carotid artery. Meanwhile, intrigu
ing subplots go on that involve the President,
terrorists, hackers, moles and assorted B-list
celebrities. And oh yeah, the whole thing
happens in reai time. Except for traffic.
Traffic just gets ignored.
Now, after that completely impartial
analysis, it becomes overwhelmingly clear
that Show B is the superior program — the
Pepsi if you will. The winner is, of course,
"24," and really it's no contest. Now, the aver
age "Lost" fan is sure to be infuriated by this
truthful assertion. "What about the unpre-

dictability of' Lost?"' they'll say. What about
the uncertainty and tension that each new
clue, each new theory brings to the show?
Isn't that the mark of truly gripping televi
sion?
Well, the fact that the events on "Lost"
arc extremely difficult to predict is precisely
the show's Achilles heel. In a perpetual
attempt to one-up themselves, the show's
writers and producers are always introducing
contrived new villains, plot twists and secrets
to conveniently explain away whatever needs
explaining. Supposedly it's all building up to
one shocking climax, but come on — it's
growing ever clearer that the whole series is
going to end up being some eight-year-old's
dream or something.
The genius of "24" lies in its rigidity. The
show has its one gimmick — real-time —
but within that familiar structure, it plays by
the rules of satisfying storytelling. lack always
works out inventive, MacGyver-esq,ue ways of
killing his enemies while constantly grunting,
"Dammit!" and,"There's no time!" Chloe
always rolls her eyes. Bill Buchanan always
says something soothing and Papa Bear-ish.
And of course, something jaw-dropping
always happens in the final 10 seconds. A cer
tain measure of predictability is comforting,
and when getting hooked on a season of
"24," it's nice to know not what will happen,
but simply that whatever happens will be
exciting and well-earned within the context
of the plot.
More often than not, "24" can consis
tently be relied on for heart-pounding
action, the right balance of realism and pre
posterousness, and the bizarre ability to turn
its viewers into torture-loving neo-cons for
one hour a week. The show knows exactly
what it provides and its fans demand it.
Ultimately, we love and crave "24" because it
always involves us in the stories and in the
action, and because it never leaves us feeling
lost.

When Oceanic flight 815 crashed in
late September of 2004, my life
changed almost as much as John
Locke's did. As the intricate world of "Lost"
unfolded week after week, I, along with mil
lions of Americans, was hooked. When 1 met
Kate Austin, I forgot all about Kim Bauer.
Now don't get me wrong, I like "24." I've
been watching it for years, and often 1 like
nothing better than turning my brain off, sit
ting down and watching Jack Bauer kick some
terrorist ass. What I really look forward to
every week, however, is the new episode of
"Lost." Even the cliffhanger-happy "24" (oh
great, another disaster at five minutes to the
hour, see you next week) can't match the
sheer anticipation felt in a room with "Lost"
addicts waiting for their fix.
"Lost" and "24" are as different as a
shoot-'em-up action show with a real-time
gimmick and a character-driven drama on a
secret island can be. What makes "Lost" spe
cial is the extreme care taken by the writers to
weave together an (eventually) coherent sto
ryline through each season. Every flashback,
every four-toed statue and, yes, every flight
number is inserted for a specific reason, even
if we are not to find out for a long time. We
grow attached to all of the characters as we
learn about their past and how they arc using
it to cope with their newfound castaway sta
tus, and just enough of them are killed off to
keep us from becoming too complacent.
The storytelling style of each show con
trasts the other nicely. "24" remains grounded
in real-time (Bauer's ability to cross down
town L.A. at rush hour during a short com
mercial break notwithstanding), while the
"Lost" narrative adheres to much looser tem
poral laws. The series mixes in flashbacks and
flash-forwards with the events of the "pres
ent," that is, the 2004 crash of Oceanic 815,
and if the premiere of the fifth season is any
indication, we're headed for a few more tem
poral surprises. While effective, the real-time

account of Bauer's day, season after season,
becomes cumbersome and leaves little room
for further innovation.
As lack Bauer begins his seventh 24-hour
terrorist-killing spree in as many years, the
familiar plotlines begin to rear their heads.
Terrorists have a nuke/chemical weapon/nerve
gas/virus in L.A./Washington, D.C. They (for
some reason) kidnap someone close to lack.
The planned attack is linked to high govern
ment officials. There are multiple members of
Bauer's CTU organization in league with the
bad guys. A politician's life is in danger. Bauer
saves the day anyway using unorthodox meth
ods, often at high personal cost.
"Lost" is never this predictable. We are
kept at the edge of our seats as the castaways
explore the myriad mysteries of their island.
Each character's storyline is carefully inter
woven with the rest of the cast's storylines
hinting at the underlying reasons for each of
them to be there. The enigmatic Others keep
us guessing at their purpose, while countless
hours have been spent debating the Dharma
Initiative's true intentions. These discussions
pull us even further into the "Lost" mytholo
gy. "Lost" succeeds in exactly what it intends:
It makes you pay attention to every detail in
hopes of solving the island before Sayid,
Desmond, Sawyer ct al.
Because anyone remotely connected to
Bauer dies or randomly decides to betray him,
we have little stake in the events of the show.
We know Bauer is going to limp his way
through this one, albeit after being shot a half
dozen times and pulling the bullets out with a
Swiss army knife and some vodka in a hotel
bathroom, which might as well not even have
a toilet since Bauer's godlike bladder seems to
allow him to hold it for 24 hours at a time.
I'll take Jack Shephard performing an
appendectomy on himself over that any day.

pull us even further into the "Lost" mytholo
gy. "Lost" succeeds in exactly what it intends:
It makes you pay attention to every detail in
hopes of solving the island before Sayid,
Desmond, Sawyer ct al.
Because anyone remotely connected to
Bauer dies or randomly decides to betray him,
we have little stake in the events of the show.
We know Bauer is going to limp his way
through this one, albeit after being shot a half
dozen times and pulling the bullets out with a
Swiss army knife and some vodka in a hotel
bathroom, which might as well not even have
a toilet since Bauer's godlike bladder seems to
allow him to hold it for 24 hours at a time.
I'll take Jack Shephard performing an
appendectomy on himself over that any day.

"24" vs. "Lost" is one of the great
debates of our time. On the surface, it's cer
tainly a very competitive and compelling
match-up. Both shows have rabid fan bases,
start their seasons in January and star
badasses named Jack who never sleep or go
to the bathroom. It's an extremely close call,
right? Well, only one gimmicky serialized
drama can be king. In order to crown a
champion, let's look at this match-up com
pletely blindly and objectively — Pepsi chal
lenge-style. Here is a summary of a typical
episode of each program (with the names
taken off, of course). Let's see which one
sounds more interesting.
Show A: A bunch of people sit around
on an island waiting for something to hap
pen. They are all unrealistically good-looking
except for a fat guy with gross hair. There is a
flashback about a boring character's boring
life. Another character, someone who none ol
the viewers at home were really too invested
in, gets killed. Then everyone discovers
something TOTALLY SECRET AND REALLY
IMPORTANT. An old guy says something
philosophical.
Show B: A certain awesome government
agent runs around kicking ass. "Kicking ass"
can mean several different things, from play
ing a mean game of Russian Roulette to cut
ting several people's limbs off to biting a bad
guy in the carotid artery. Meanwhile, intrigu
ing subplots go on that involve the President,
terrorists, hackers, moles and assorted B-list
celebrities. And oh yeah, the whole thing
happens in reai time. Except for traffic.
Traffic just gets ignored.
Now, after that completely impartial
analysis, it becomes overwhelmingly clear
that Show B is the superior program — the
Pepsi if you will. The winner is, of course,
"24," and really it's no contest. Now, the aver
age "Lost" fan is sure to be infuriated by this
truthful assertion. "What about the unpre-

dictability of' Lost?"' they'll say. What about
the uncertainty and tension that each new
clue, each new theory brings to the show?
Isn't that the mark of truly gripping televi
sion?
Well, the fact that the events on "Lost"
arc extremely difficult to predict is precisely
the show's Achilles heel. In a perpetual
attempt to one-up themselves, the show's
writers and producers are always introducing
contrived new villains, plot twists and secrets
to conveniently explain away whatever needs
explaining. Supposedly it's all building up to
one shocking climax, but come on — it's
growing ever clearer that the whole series is
going to end up being some eight-year-old's
dream or something.
The genius of "24" lies in its rigidity. The
show has its one gimmick — real-time —
but within that familiar structure, it plays by
the rules of satisfying storytelling. lack always
works out inventive, MacGyver-esq,ue ways of
killing his enemies while constantly grunting,
"Dammit!" and,"There's no time!" Chloe
always rolls her eyes. Bill Buchanan always
says something soothing and Papa Bear-ish.
And of course, something jaw-dropping
always happens in the final 10 seconds. A cer
tain measure of predictability is comforting,
and when getting hooked on a season of
"24," it's nice to know not what will happen,
but simply that whatever happens will be
exciting and well-earned within the context
of the plot.
More often than not, "24" can consis
tently be relied on for heart-pounding
action, the right balance of realism and pre
posterousness, and the bizarre ability to turn
its viewers into torture-loving neo-cons for
one hour a week. The show knows exactly
what it provides and its fans demand it.
Ultimately, we love and crave "24" because it
always involves us in the stories and in the
action, and because it never leaves us feeling
lost.

When Oceanic flight 815 crashed in
late September of 2004, my life
changed almost as much as John
Locke's did. As the intricate world of "Lost"
unfolded week after week, I, along with mil
lions of Americans, was hooked. When 1 met
Kate Austin, I forgot all about Kim Bauer.
Now don't get me wrong, I like "24." I've
been watching it for years, and often 1 like
nothing better than turning my brain off, sit
ting down and watching Jack Bauer kick some
terrorist ass. What I really look forward to
every week, however, is the new episode of
"Lost." Even the cliffhanger-happy "24" (oh
great, another disaster at five minutes to the
hour, see you next week) can't match the
sheer anticipation felt in a room with "Lost"
addicts waiting for their fix.
"Lost" and "24" are as different as a
shoot-'em-up action show with a real-time
gimmick and a character-driven drama on a
secret island can be. What makes "Lost" spe
cial is the extreme care taken by the writers to
weave together an (eventually) coherent sto
ryline through each season. Every flashback,
every four-toed statue and, yes, every flight
number is inserted for a specific reason, even
if we are not to find out for a long time. We
grow attached to all of the characters as we
learn about their past and how they arc using
it to cope with their newfound castaway sta
tus, and just enough of them are killed off to
keep us from becoming too complacent.
The storytelling style of each show con
trasts the other nicely. "24" remains grounded
in real-time (Bauer's ability to cross down
town L.A. at rush hour during a short com
mercial break notwithstanding), while the
"Lost" narrative adheres to much looser tem
poral laws. The series mixes in flashbacks and
flash-forwards with the events of the "pres
ent," that is, the 2004 crash of Oceanic 815,
and if the premiere of the fifth season is any
indication, we're headed for a few more tem
poral surprises. While effective, the real-time

account of Bauer's day, season after season,
becomes cumbersome and leaves little room
for further innovation.
As lack Bauer begins his seventh 24-hour
terrorist-killing spree in as many years, the
familiar plotlines begin to rear their heads.
Terrorists have a nuke/chemical weapon/nerve
gas/virus in L.A./Washington, D.C. They (for
some reason) kidnap someone close to lack.
The planned attack is linked to high govern
ment officials. There are multiple members of
Bauer's CTU organization in league with the
bad guys. A politician's life is in danger. Bauer
saves the day anyway using unorthodox meth
ods, often at high personal cost.
"Lost" is never this predictable. We are
kept at the edge of our seats as the castaways
explore the myriad mysteries of their island.
Each character's storyline is carefully inter
woven with the rest of the cast's storylines
hinting at the underlying reasons for each of
them to be there. The enigmatic Others keep
us guessing at their purpose, while countless
hours have been spent debating the Dharma
Initiative's true intentions. These discussions
pull us even further into the "Lost" mytholo
gy. "Lost" succeeds in exactly what it intends:
It makes you pay attention to every detail in

dozen times and pulling the bullets out with a
Swiss army knife and some vodka in a hotel
bathroom, which might as well not even have
a toilet since Bauer's godlike bladder seems to
allow him to hold it for 24 hours at a time.

appendectomy on himself over that any day.
