# Valentine's Day: Roxy Sass calls for a revamp...

Sigh. It's time to start thinking about the birds and the bees,
moonlight, champagne under the stars ... L.O.V.E!!
Valentine's Day is coming up, which means lovers are plan
ning away while the unattached roll their eyes in chagrin.
Restaurants are booked; jewelry stores are swarmed ...
Celebrators are struggling to battle the onslaught of commercial

pressures looming on every TV screen and in every shop-

ners, diamonds, fancy hotels — are they all really

necessary to show someone you care? Most would
agree that they aren't, yet credit cards are being
swiped away as we speak. The stickiest part for

hetero couples is the lopsided nature of
Valentine's Day — who usually does the buy
ing? Bingo if you guessed the guy!
What is the male gift equivalent to flow-

ers and chocolate? "Steak and Blowjob Day" was
recently created as a snarky male counterpart to the
female patronage of the famous red and pink holiday.

Funny? Die-hard romantics find the day to be crude and
insulting while others look at it with a more amused point of
view:
"I think it's both hilarious and gross," says an anonymous

sophomore girl. "I probably just think it's gross because 1 think
blowjobs are gross. On the other hand, if guys really hate watch
ing chick flicks as much as they say they do, maybe fair is fair ...
Sophomore Conor Trujillo, looks at the matter simply.
"Women love flowers and chocolates," he said. "Men love steak
and blowjobs. It's only fair that we each get a day to enjoy them."

But aren't the dichotomies demonstrated by these two
holidays dated and sexist? Do all women really want

flowers and chocolates? Do all men loathe romance?
Certainly not — which is why I proclaim a new and
progressive alternative to cliche Valentine's Day
traditions. Sex is the answer! It brings us together,

it evens the score! Everyone loves it!
Forget about "Steak and Blowjob Day" ... for
get about the chocolates! Put away the credit cards
and all of the tedious preconceived notions that

you've ever had about Valentine's Day. Such a special
day shouldn't involve going through a set of motions estab

lished by Hallmark and See's Candy. Instead, make it your
)wn. Stay in and cook together. Make each other's mouths water

with foods that you both love. Go wild! Indulge in lingerie, kinky
accessories, bubble baths, your favorite cocktails, naughty new
fantasies! And maybe you can indulge your man in a blowjob.
