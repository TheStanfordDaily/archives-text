# PAGE 2 PEACE OUT...
## intermission editors' note 
### 
Alice Hyun suffered a heart attack
yesterday when QuarkXpress quit
unexpectedly for the fifth time in a
row. Though she had survived many
such incidents before, it is believed
that Alice was overcome by grief by
this particular crash. It is said that
she was working on the Best.
Layout. Ever. The daughter of crafty
Korean parents, Alice was known for
her cute Asian aesthetic and
adorable hand motions. She died
only weeks before her father's 60th
birthday. Alice had planned to fly
home to Korea to surprise the old
man in a tailor-made custom dress.
Tear.

Mae Diana Ryan died last night
while editing her last photo. She
was 21 years old. A lover of perfect
exposure and innovative composi-.
tion, Mae was known by all as a
dedicated photographer who con
sistently gave up Happy Hour and
Pub Night to create hundreds of
different-sized images for the Daily
website. Though her personal work
has been celebrated in venues all
over campus, Mae will be most
remembered for her manipulation
of photographs poached from the
Internet. Her ability to convert files
to TIFF format was uncanny.

Kelsey Mesher was found uncon
scious last night on the floor of the
Lorey Lokey Daily Building. Though
cause of death is unknown, it is
rumored that Kelsey died of a bro
ken heart. Though she complained
about her time at the Daily on a
daily basis, those close to her knew
that she was dreading giving up
Intermission. Intermission writers will
miss the ingenuous amount of
emails she sent, and her terribly
cheesy headlines and puns. She is
survived by her dedicated writers,
the Paloma freshmen she neglected
and Duran "Duranimal" Alvarez. In
lieu of flowers, please make a mone
tary donation to Rho Theta Tao.

We're not actually crazy...we swear. We're wear
ing 3D glasses, which we received free for this
weekend's Dream Works' "Monsters vs. Aliens"
3D Superbowl event. Let's be honest. We won't
be watching the game this Sunday, we'll be
mourning the end of Volume 234, which con
cludes today. That's right, dear readers, this is
our last issue of Intermission. We've given up
our friends, our social lives, sleep and perhaps
our dignity (see accompanying photo) to crank
out fifteen glorious issues. We started the vol
ume out fresh with a new design and vision for
where we wanted to take the magazine. Our
goal was to revitalize coverage of the many and
varied arts on campus while continuing to deliv
er interesting and in depth film, music and food
reviews. We leave our beloved publication in
the hands of a new Intermission army: Joanna
Xu, Kate Hayes and our frosh fellow, Annika
Heinle. We wish them good luck...they might
need it. That's all. Happy Friday!
XOXO,
Kelsev and Mae and Alice
