# STAMP brings mental health issues out of obscurity
## 
### 
In its most recent effort to promote posi
tive social change on campus, the
Stanford Theater Activist Mobilization

Project (STAMP) presents "Out of
Sight, Out of Mind," a candid look at
the mental health issues of Stanford
students. Last October, the
University's Student Mental Health
and Weil-Being Task Force released a
report looking at the campus climate,
insufficient resources and the mis
guided notion that good academic
performance reflects good mental
health.
While the Stanford administra
tion has taken some steps in response
to the report, STAMP'S production
seeks to put a human face on
Stanford's mental health problems by
incorporating the testimonies of
Stanford students into an engaging
performance piece. "Out of Sight, Out
of Mind" began as a call for anony
mous submissions on the subject of
mental illness. Twenty-four students
offered their stories, which were then

edited into monologue form and selected by
actors in the STAMP troupe, some of whom
specifically chose texts which resonated with
their own personal struggles. Monologues'
subjects run the gamut from common,
though by no means trivial, issues such as
depression and eating disorders to bipolar

and anxiety disorders. Likewise, the tone of
selections ranges from the hopelessly bleak to
optimistic.

A skill STAMP cultivates is applying
form to function, often using different stag
ing tactics to reach its specific audience. To
generate awareness for the current project,
each night during the past week, STAMP
directors took small groups of actors to dorm
lounges across campus. Following the per-

formance, directors offered audiences a
chance to engage in discussion with actors,
RAs and other students. Friday and Saturday

nights' shows at the Women's Community
Center will feature a similar format, though
with an extended selection of monologues at
each show and some panelists from outside
the theater group conducting post-perform
ance talks on their personal struggles with
mental illness. STAMP artistic director Liesl

Spitz '11 said that dorm performances have
generated fruitful discussions, and provided a
forum for some students to open up about

their own mental health battles.
Overall, Uut of Sight, Out of
Mind" admirably straddles the line
between education and theater. The
STAMP actors do an impressive job
delivering their heavy material, and
the content of the monologues them
selves is extremely moving. The per
formances contain a raw, often fright
ening honesty which is normally lack
ing from theater which tries to pro
mote health or mental health aware
ness. Making the words all the more
powerful is the audience's remem
brance that the struggles presented to
them are not only real, but belong to i
fellow Stanford student. If mental
health is an issue you've seldom dealt
with personally, "Out of Sight, Out of
Mind," offers a chance to gain a better
understanding of many members of
the Stanford community, as well as to
confront tough questions about the

treatment of mental illness, the threat of
somatization and the role of mental health
on our campus.
