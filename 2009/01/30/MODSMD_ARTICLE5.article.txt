# The
						So-Called "Maestro of Klez Funk" comes to Stanford

### 
It may have been freezing outside on Tuesday night, but
within the cozy confines of the CoHo, visiting artist
Socalled's show received a pleasantly warm reception. Put
on by Stanford Lively Arts as part of the Artist Show & Tell
Series, the event made for a truly unique night of entertain
ment.
Hailing from Montreal, Canada, artist Josh Dolgin (or
Socalled, as he's called) gave the crowd a salient sampling of
what it means to be truly creative. Relying mainly on his
music-mixing machine and copious amounts of charisma to
run the show, Socalled incorporated a wide range of musical
influences into his work.
From 1920s Yiddish Theater music to the sounds of
Motown, he used it all to enhance his performance, which was
already replete with piano, vocals and even accordion-playing.
"It's amazing what you can take up, mash up, put into
[the machine] and get out of it again," Socalled explained. "I
just try to find things 1 won't get sued for."
However unlikely a combination, the traditional strains of
Klezmer music set to catchy modern beats taken from a vari
ety of sources, including House tracks, gave Socalled's musical
numbers a distinctive and strangely intriguing feel that had
the audience tapping their feet in time.
Having previously worked with artists of all backgrounds,
Socalled is no stranger to the huge spectrum of musical tastes
present among even a small audience. Fortunately, Tuesday
night, he employed all mediums to engage everyone in the
audience — rap fans and lovers of classical music alike. In one
memorable tune, Socalled gave a performance of a "Big L" rap

accompanied by a Rodgers and Hammerstein track on the
piano. Another enjoyable moment of the night found guest
performers Todd Reynolds on violin and David Krakauer on
clarinet joining forces with Socalled and voices from the audi
ence on the refrain for a song titled "The Good Old Days."
For the more visual audience members, Socalled showed a
brilliantly executed music video of a track off his album
"Ghettoblaster" entitled "You Are Never Alone."
At a couple points in the night, Socalled even took the
opportunity to display his magical prowess. The first trick
found him cutting a rope into three even lengths and subse
quently pulling them out of his palm again, revealing that they
had been transformed into three very uneven strands. The sec
ond trick was possibly of more interest to readers, as he used a
copy of our very own Stanford Daily as a prop. Ripping the
paper into shreds and displaying them to the audience, he
nonchalantly proceeded to unfold it, whole and unscathed
again.
In fact, the ease with which Socalled managed to repro
duce live such heavily produced, complex tracks was nothing
short of magical, and made for a wonderfully captivating per
formance.
