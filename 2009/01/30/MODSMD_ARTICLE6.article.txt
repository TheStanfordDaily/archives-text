# Student group Artspan helps kids through art therapy
## 
### 
Friday is a cheerful day at Achieve Kids School in East
Palo Alto. The classrooms fill with soothing music,
multicolored art equipment, rocks, feathers, drums,
vegetables and a group of Stanford students determined to
introduce their vision of art and enthusiasm for service to an
unusual audience. Achieve Kids services over 200 children and
young adults from the Bay Area with varying degrees of
developmental and emotional disabilities. Most of the chil
dren there find it hard to perform daily tasks; almost none of
them have had an art class before. Nonetheless, they seem to
genuinely enjoy the weekly lessons with Stanford volunteers,
who call their project Artspan.
Artspan is a student-initiated outreach program created
in collaboration with the Haas Center for Public Service. Its
mission is to extend art and arts education to underprivi
leged youth in East Palo Alto. Directed by a group of students
passionate about the visual arts, Artspan now encompasses
four independent outreach programs with the Boys and Girls
Club, the Rosaline Rondu Center, one local high school and
Achieve Kids.
Yun Liang '10, who volunteers at Achieve Kids, described
her work there as one of the most challenging and invigorat
ing in her experience as a community service provider. While
the children sometimes have trouble expressing themselves,

Artspan volunteers try to help focus their energy into creat
ing art. One technique they learn is pointillism. Under the
guidance of a volunteer, the kids learn to make colorful dots
on the paper while thumping their fists to music. The blank
page is spattered with bright continuous dots — a piece
brimming with post-impressionist flavor.
The theory behind pointillism is simple — repetition
goes a long way in helping to develop the children's crucial
cognitive abilities. By performing repeated actions, the kids
gain a sense of order. Though initially some kids have diffi
culty even applying dots on the paper by themselves, the
music helps to facilitate the action of painting and create a
calming environment.
Even the weekly presence of the Stanford volunteers is
therapeutic to the kids who are often confused and frustrated
by the complexity of the world they face. The ongoing art
classes help them understand regularity.
"lust being there for them helps," Liang said.
Apart from pointillism, Artspan has designed a rich and
enchanting syllabus for Achieve Kids students, with course
themes including printmaking, collages, mosaic and clay
molding. Each session aims not only to bring the pleasure of
art to the kids, but also to train them in skills vital to their
future.
Through an upcoming session called Dymensions, vol
unteers hope to demonstrate the different artistic possibilities
of shifting an object from one dimension to another. The
actual content of the class can be as challenging as creating 3-
D shapes out of paper for higher-level kids, or as simple as
distinguishing a painted box from a real box for lower-level
kids. Through creating the virtual image of a solid, physical
box, the kids learn to grasp the boundaries between represen

tation and reality.
"Many of the kids we work with have no art programs at
their schools — they've been cut due to a lack of funding,"
said Artspan manager Otto Leinsdorf'o9. "Or they simply
have nothing to do after school, and with working parents, or
potentially unstable family situations, Artspan provides them
with an enjoyable alternative."
