# Digital style: student designed iPhone apps push the envelope
## 
### 
Stanford's computer science faculty has taken notice of
the next big programming opportunity for students —
Apple's iPhone, which features a highly customizable
interface that allows independent programmers to design
applications for the device.
Last quarter, Stanford offered CSI93P, called iPhone
Application Programming. The students had the opportunit

to design their very own application for the iPhone and
distribute it online via Apple's App Store.
Vikram Oberoi '09 took the class and designed an appli
cation called Site Saver, which allows users to download
entire Web pages and store them to the iPhone for later
viewing. Oberoi said this type of application is particularly
helpful for people who are on the go and may not always
have an Internet connection to download content.
"If you want the Caltrain schedule on the go and you
don't have an internet connection, it's awesome," Oberoi
said. "If you want to keep a cache of the things that you
read online every day, you can go to a blog that you read,
cache it and read your blog without an internet connec
tion."
Although many of the applications, including Oberoi's,
are still waiting approval from Apple before they can be
I distributed online, Oberoi has developed a Web site to
publicize the applications developed in the course.
Recently, an online technology blog in the Netherlands
took notice of his application and praised it for its utility
to commuters.
CSI39P students James Anthony'o9 and Edward Marks
'09 designed a recreational application called Air Guitar,
which allows users to play different chord progressions on
the phone using its touch-screen interface. Users choose four
different chords in the application's menu, allowing them to
play synthetic guitar chords to their favorite songs.
"We thought that at first, people who couldn't play guitar
nor had any knowledge of music could get four notes," Marks
said. "If you know a little bit something about music, you can
rock out."

According to Anthony, the program development process
was not without hurdles. While the program only took three
days to write, perfecting the user interface to make the appli
cation more visually appealing took much longer.
Moreover, one of the most challenging tasks was teach
ing new users to properly use the application.
"When you hand it to someone for the first time and
they don't have a notion of how it's supposed to work, it can
be really tricky to write documentation, instructions or
You Tube videos so that people can understand it and get
enjoyment of it," Anthony said. "Some people get really lost
and think the app is broken."
Anthony and Marks said the class even offered them the
opportunity to learn a few business skills. In order to manage
the profits from the application, the duo started a limited lia
bility corporation based in Wyoming. They now hope their
application, which is available online, follows in the footsteps
of other lucrative iPhone applications.
"It is a tempting thing — they call it the 'iLotto,'" Marks
said. "Some apps like iFart grossed $150,000 in two weeks,
and the iShoot made hundreds of thousands of dollars."
