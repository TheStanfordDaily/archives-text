# Dear Fraiche, we like you now, not like before
## 
### 
We've made a huge mistake, cher
ished readers! The mistake goes
like this: Nearly 16 months ago,
we wrote about Fraiche, the then-newly
opened frozen yogurt shop on Emerson
Street in Palo Alto. And we gave it a tempes
tuous review, in which we trashed the decor
and made fun of Palo Alto mommies who
wear leggings like they're going out of style
(which is funny, because ...).
Needless to say, Fraiche didn't use any
pull-quotes from our review for their public
ity material. After all, phrases like "A curious
smoky undertone!" or "Stainable pillows!" or
"Pretentious French name!" could hardly
have been used to great PR advantage, but
the embarrassing thing is this: We really like
Fraiche now. What's more, we realized that

our first impressions had been tainted by the
fact that we ordered disgusting stuff— Greek
yogurt topped with chocolate shavings?
Appalling. Unconscionable.
But now, so far as things go in our Palo-
Altonian yogurt world, Fraiche is nothing
less than a fro-yo haven for gentlemen and
scholars. Consequently, we're unspeakably
thankful that Fraiche has opened up shop in
Tresidder. This arrival, plus the opening of
the ambrosial Coupa Cafe in Y2E2 has made
us feel substantially better about the taste
level of our university — this is Princeton
quality stuff.
Located across from Subway, Fraiche
deals primarily in fat-free and low-fat frozen
yogurt, plus Greek yogurt, hot coftee, iced
coffee, coconut water, steel-cut oatmeal
(because we know how much bronze-cut
oatmeal sucks) and kombucha (it's sweet tea,
people — just calm down!). The whole point,
though, is obviously the fro-yo, which comes
in "natural," soy and chocolate flavors, and is
priced between $2.95 and $6.75, depending
on the size of the cup and the number of
toppings. We sampled and enjoyed all three
flavors, but we'd recommend that initiates
begin with the "natural," which is more tangy
and delightful than any mainstream frozen

yogurt, a la Mister Softee.
The Greek and frozen yogurts are made
locally, using Clover organic milk, and every
thing is very low-fat and fairly low-cal, so
don't feel terrible about eating the stuff. It is
simply a delight, and you won't get sick of
sampling it weekly or even daily. As far as
toppings go, we recommend any of the fol
lowing: almonds, strawberries, raspberry
coulis, shaved chocolate, blueberries, pome
granate seeds and something exotic called
olallieberry (doesn't it sound like the name
of an Australian child?). For now, avoid the
mangos, since they're out of season. Also, the
brownie chunks were prohibitively crunchy.
Since our Tresidder-based Fraiche just
opened, they're still training staff and work
ing out kinks, but they seem to be coping
well with their long lines, and the employees
with whom we dealt were helpful and courte
ous (and they take meal plan points!). Nearly
all the patrons we spied upon were lining up
for frozen yogurt, although the coffee is also
very good. But the coconut water is not good
— leave it alone.
We're honestly delighted that Fraiche has
come to Stanford. Now, we have a whole
quartet of truly quality eateries on campus
(the other three are, obviously, Coupa,

Cantor's Cool Cafe and Moonbeans).
Fraiche, we are sorry we were so mean to you
before. You deserve love and customers. You
are a nice store. Thank you for being you.
Fraiche is open from 8 a.m. to 10:30
p.m. on Mondays through Thursdays, 8 a.m.
to 11 p.m. on Fridays, 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. on
Saturdays and 10 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. on
Sundays. More information can be found at
