# Melt your stress away
## 
### 
Stanford students love to complain
about the fact that Palo Alto seems to
offer a lot of Persian rugs, but not a
whole lot of fun. So, it is always promising
when there is a new addition to the nightlife
scene in town. In November of last year, that
scene became slightly more sophisticated
with the opening of Melt Ultra Lounge on
Emerson Street.
Though only steps away from the classic
Rose & Crown, Melt could not be more dif
ferent. It is not your average pub, nor is it a
disgusting, crowded club. Rather, Melt pro
vides a high-end lounge atmosphere ideal tor
relaxing over a few drinks and perhaps some
light food. The relatively small bar is lit pri

marily by artistically abstract chandeliers and
is surrounded by lounge seating that lends
itself well to small groups. The comfort level
of the furniture varies from elegantly uphol
stered benches with pillows to metal stools
that look like they're stolen from the set of a
bad sci-fi movie. Overall, though, the well
decorated interior is comfortable and
appealing.
Melt offers a full bar with beer, cocktails
and wine by the glass or bottle. The list of
specialty cocktails includes numerous tempt
ing and exotic combinations such as the sap
phire margarita, which owes its blue name to
a generous pour of Curasao. With most of
these cocktails breaking double digits in

terms of price, they re not
the best way to get a cheap
buzz. They are, however,
generously sized, tasty and
appropriately priced for
the environment.
If you're looking for a bite
to eat, Melt offers a num
ber of appetizers for a
snack with friends or even
a light dinner. Influences
range from East to West
from potstickers to the
once classless (but now
trendy) phenomenon of
sliders. The prawn tacos
were excellent — combin
ing a nice serving of spicv

and crispy shrimp with a creamy chipotle
flavor and good toppings to balance things
out.
It should be noted that the experience at
Melt will probably vary substantially
depending on the day and time. In order to
get this review to press in time, it was neces
sary to go on a Tuesday night when the
lounge was nearly empty. One bartender
seemed to be the only one working there,
and he seemed reluctant to come to a table
to take an order. If you're looking for the
hottest place in town, Melt might not be
your local, but it was a perfectly good place
to meet up with a friend after a long day.

The all-night happy hour prices on Tuesdays
(four-dollar well drinks, three-dollar beers,
half-price food) didn't hurt either. Thursday
into the weekend, the atmosphere would
probably feel more like a club, with D)s
working the turntables on two dance floors
— upstairs and down. It's not entirely clear,
however, how great Melt would be as a place
to dance with very little suitable space down
stairs, and a small (though sufficient) dance
floor by the bar upstairs.
But in the realm of bars and cocktails
lounges, Melt does a good job. Its food and
drink offerings are quite good, and the envi
ronment is classy and potentially a lot of fun
though dependent on the crowd — which
will, of course, vary in size and type depend
ing on when you go.
