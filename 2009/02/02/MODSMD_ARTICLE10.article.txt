# GOP leader doubts stimulus will pass
## Sen. Mitch McConnell says stimulus bill could fail in Senate 
### DOUGLASS K. DANIEL THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said
Sunday the massive stimulus hill backed by President
Barack Obama and congressional Democrats could go
down to defeat if it's not stripped of unnecessary
spending and focused more on housing issues and tax
cut.
The Senate version (if the bill, which topped out at
nearly $900 billion, is headed to the floor for debate.
The House bill totaled about $819 billion and earned
no Republican votes, even though it easily passed the

Democratic-controlled House. At some point lawmak
ers will need to compromise on the competing ver
sions.
McConnell and other Republicans suggested that
the bill needed an overhaul because it doesn't pump
enough into the private sector through tax euts and al
lows Democrats to go on a spending spree unlikely to
jolt the economy. The Republican leader also com
plained that Democrats had not been as bipartisan in
writing the bill as Obama had said he wanted.
"I think it may be time ... for the president to kind
of get a hold of these Democrats in the Senate and the
House, who have rather significant majorities, and
shake them a little bit and say.'Look, let's do this the
right way,"' McConnell said. "I can't believe that the
president isn't embarrassed about the products that
have been produced so far."
For his part, Obama said he is confident Republi

cans will come around to support the final version of
the legislation. He and Vice President Joe Biden will
meet with congressional leaders at the White I louse on
Monday afternoon.
"I am confident that by the time we have the final
package on the floor that we are going to see substan
tial support, and people are going to see this is a serious
effort. It has no earmarks. We are going to be trimming
out things that are not relevant to putting people back
to work right now." Obama said.
However, he declined to predict how many Senate
Republicans might switch parties. Biden. a former sen
ior member of the Senate before his election, similarly
declined to offer predictions last week in an interview
despite his personal phone calls for former colleagues.
