Senator: Appointment wouldn't affect Senate
makeup
President Barack Obama is expected to pick a Republican
senator. Judd Gregg of New I lampshire.as his commerce sec
retary soon. But officials expect the state's Democratic gover
nor. John Lynch, to fill Gregg's Senate seat with another Re
publican.
"In other words, whoever is appointed lo replace him
would caucus with Senate Republicans, so I think it would
have no impact on the balance of power in the Senate." Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate's minority leader, told
"Face the Nation"on CBS.
If a Republican is appointed, the Democrats will be no
closer to their goal of holding 60 Senate seats, enough to cut
off Republican filibusters if all Democrats vote together.
They now have 56 votes.Two independents usually vote with
the Democrats, giving them 5N votes. The outcome in a still
disputed Senate election in Minnesota could bring that to 59
votes.
The Republican expected to get the seat until a new elec
tion is held in two years is Bonnie Newman, who served as
Gregg's chief of staff when Gregg was in the I louse. She is a
veteran of the Reagan White I louse. Under the deal that has
been worked out, she will not run in the 2010 election.
