# Steelers win their sixth Super Bowl
## 
### BARRY WILNER THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
The winning play of the Super Bowl
w as right out of a schoolyard.
Scamble right, scramble left, find
someone open.
The perfect unscripted ending to a
game of improbable swings.
Their Steel Curtain shredded. Ben
Roethlisberger and Santonio Holmes
improvised the 6-yard touchdown with
35 seconds left that gave the Pittsburgh
Steelers a record-setting sixth Super
Bowl victory. 27-23 over the Arizona
C "ardinals on Sunday night.
"Great players step up in big-time
games to make plays," said Holmes, the
game's MVP. He said he told Roethlis
berger that he "wanted to be the guy to
make the plays for this team."
And he was.
Holmes grabbed the ball with both
irms stretched fully above his head in
the back right corner of the end zone,
lis toes barely dragging inbounds. He
'ell. sat up and cradled the ball like the
->ri/e it was.
[his thriller certainly matched last
ear's upset of the New Kngland Patri
>ts by the New York Giants that ended
vith Plaxico Burress'TD catch — with
15 seconds left. too.
But this one was even wilder. With
he last tension-packed seconds ticking

away, a kneeling Roethlisberger held
coach Mike Tomlin's hand as Kurt
Warner led one last, but futile, drive.
The Steelers (15-4). winning their
second Super Bowl in four seasons, led
20-7 in the fourth quarter, only to see
Warner and the Cardinals stage a re
markable rally to go in front 23-20 with
2:37 remaining.
Fitzgerald could only watch from
the sideline as Roethlisberger engi
neered a 78-yard drive to win it in what
resembled Heinz Field South. With
waves of twirling Terrible Towels turn
ing Raymond James Stadium into a
black-and-gold tableau — Steelers
fans supporting their beloved team, the
economy be damned — Pittsburgh's
offense rescued the title.
"1 knew it was a touchdown 100 per
cent." Holmes said, even though it had
to withstand a video review. "My feet
never left the ground. All I did was
stand up on my toes and extended my
hands."
And hauled in the pass that punctu
ated another Pittsburgh championship,
adding to those won in the 1974. '75.
'78.'79 and '05 seasons.
The stunning swings overshadowed
Pittsburgh linebacker James Harri
son's record 100-yard interception re
turn for a touchdown to end the first
half. That looked like the signature
play until the final quarter, when both

teams shook off apparent knockout
punches to throw haymakers of their
own.
Hig lien and Holmes struck the last
blow, and when Warner fumbled in the
final seconds, the Cardinals' dream of
winning their first Ni l. crown since
1947 were gone.
"I'm disappointed for our team."
said Cardinals coach Ken Whisenhunt.
the offensive coordinator in Pittsburgh
when the Steelers won the 2005 title.
"This is a group of men that I'm very
proud of. They played very hard in cir
cumstances where nobody believed in
them.
Harrison, the defensive player of
the year, stepped in front of Boldin at
the goal line, picked off Warner's throw
and began a journey down the right
sideline that ended as the longest play
in Super Bowl history.
Harrison ran past or through most
of the Cardinals, nearly stepped out of
bounds at one point, and was dragged
down by Fitzgerald as he fell to the goal
line. The play was reviewed as several
Cardinals knelt on one knee.exhausted
from lhe chase and disheartened by the
result.
"Those last couple of yards were
probably tougher than anything I've
done in my life, but probably more
gratifying than anything I've done in
football." Harrison said.
