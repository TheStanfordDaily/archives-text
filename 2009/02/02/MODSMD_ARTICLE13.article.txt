## Free the Children launches in the U.S. Kielburger speaks at first branch in Palo Alto 
### AMY HARRIS 
Children, not champagne, herald
ed the official Palo Alto launch of
Free the Children Friday, a Toronto
based charity that mobilizes youth
to stop child exploitation.
Craig Kielburger founded the
million-member strong group when
he was just 12 years old. and spoke
to hundreds of Bay Area children,
parents and educators at the cele
bratory youth rally, which was held
at the Lucie Stern Community
Center.
"If you really want to leave a
legacy, shape how kids view the
world." Kielburger said. "We are the
generation we've been waiting for.
and children are going to make the
difference."
Free the Children, now in its 14th
year, empowers youth on a domestic
level to be agents of change for
international development.
"We're trying to combat a gener
ation of passive bystanders by really
engaging the youth." Kielburger
said. "We can't tell young people to
close their eyes to poverty —
instead, we show them how they can
make a difference."
Free the Children uses funds
raised on a domestic level to finance
programs like Adopt a Village, a
four-pronged approach to funding
education, healthcare, alternative
income projects and water and sani
tation facilities in more than 16 dif
ferent countries.
Megha Malpani, a 7th grader
from the Girl's Middle School in
Mountain View, decided to help a
Kenyan girl receive an education
through Free the Children.
"This girl my age said that the
one thing she wanted in the world
was an education." Malpani remem

bered.
Malpani resolved to grant the
Kenyan girl her wish, so she baked
cookies and sold them from her
driveway until she raised $5,000,
enough to build a well in Kenya.
Access to clean water reduces the
burden of chores placed on girls like
Malpani's friend so that they can go
to school.
ITianks to Malpani and the thou
sands of other engaged youth,
whose donations account for 65 per
cent ot free the Children's funding,
2007 marked the construction of.
Free the Children's 500 th school,
giving educational access to more
than 50.000 children every day.
Eva Haller. now on the group's
U.S. Board of Directors and official
"grandmother" of Free the
C hildren. has been with the organi
zation since it began in the base
ment of the Kielburger's home. She
was teary-eved as she explained that
the opening of a U.S. office was fur
thering "the dream of a 12 year-old
that became truth."
"When Craig came to me. he had
no money, no image, no brand."
Haller recalled.
All Craig Kielburger had was a
mission: to stop child labor. When
Kielburger was 12 years old. he
came across an article in The
Toronto Star about Iqbal Masih. a
young Pakistani boy who had been
sold into slavery, kielburger knew
he had to help, so he rushed to his
7th grade class, assembled his 11
friends, and Free the Children was
born.
Haller and others helped
Kielburger to expand Free the
Children from just 12 members to
the now more than a million partici
pants. Friday's move to Palo Alto
marks Free the Children's commit
ment to solidify its U.S. presence.
