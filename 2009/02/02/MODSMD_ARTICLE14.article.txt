## Editor's Welcome 
### 
A little over four months ago, at the
start of Volume 234, I wrote in my
"Editor's Welcome"about how much
of my journalism career has been a "mis
take" — from filling an accidental hole in my
high school class schedule with Journalism 1
all the way to working here at The Stanford
Daily.
I made a resolution, though, not to let Vol
ume 234 be an accident or mistake. I ran for
editor in chief with a purpose, and every day
I spent working was going to be for a reason
— whether that was for the good of the Stan
ford community, for the sake of The Daily
tradition or for the opportunity to work with
and get to know the many other students in
volved with The Daily.
But last Thursday at 11 p.m., I made a big
mistake.
When Andrea Fuller, our then-editorial
board chair, asked where my "Editor's
Farewell" piece was, I paused, realizing that it
had completely slipped my mind — that I
had been thinking all week what 1 wanted to
say at the end of the volume, but I ended up
not even writing my farewell. It was far too
late to get started, unless 1 wanted to hold up
the entire night's production,so I just accept
ed it and moved on.
Whether or not it was an "accident" per se
... well. I don't really know.Thinking about
saying goodbye to 65 issues of hard work,
summing up my experience and sharing what
1 had learned was, quite literally, too difficult
to put into words. Maybe, then, it wasn't such
an accident that the writing "slipped my
mind."
At this moment.however. I'm finding that
writing another "Editor's Welcome" instead
is much easier. I'm happy to be returning for
another four months as editor in chief, pick
ing up where 1 left off and working to im
prove this publication with the help of an in
credible staff. While I'm amazed at how far
this paper and its staff have come since Sep
tember. I'm only more astounded by our po
tential as we continue to develop with Vol
ume 235.
And much like myself last Thursday at 11
p.m., I recognize that, at times. The Daily
makes mistakes. As student journalists, we
learn each day how to better approach and
encompass the many issues facing the Stan
ford community, tell its many stories and

serve as a center for campus conversation
and record. At times, we may not fulfill the
expectations of others — much less our own
— but we do fulfill a need.
Letting alone the times we have to make
corrections; the times we're our own biggest
critics; the times we have to face up to the
limitations of funding, especially in a poor
economy and down newspaper industry; and
the many times we unfortunately sacrifice
our academics or social lives for the sake of
The Daily, this paper fulfills a need on cam
pus— for news, for opinions, for entertain
ment and more — and 1 promise you that it
will continue to do so.
While I'll of course take with me the many
memories and lessons of Volume 234.1 more
importantly bring with me to this new Daily
volume an appreciation for what could be. As
much as newspapers are holders of the past
— recording moments, people, atmosphere
— 1 think their greatest potential lies in the
future, in what they can find out. what they
can provoke and what they can keep on the
minds of readers.
After one full volume of seeing this hap
pen — from our coverage of campus mental
health to the impending budget cuts — I can
only expect more from my staff, from our
coverage and from Hie Daily overall.
1 also expect more from all of you: our
readers. Last volume, I appreciated every
email, phone call and — as weird as this may
sound — the mere sight of someone with a
Daily in hand, someone reading in class or
someone visiting our Web site. As much as I
may ask for people to contribute to the con
versation that takes place in The Daily, 1 also
appreciate their just paying attention to it.
It's for these reasons that I'm okay with
making the mistakes, sacrificing my time,
working hard on this paper and — most of all
— not saying farewell last week.
I'm much more prepared to write, "Wel
come to Volume 235." Let's hope, though,
that four months from now, I don't forget to
write that farewell once again.
