lam not a fan of a cappella. For those of you
who (somehow) don't know, a cappella is
the tradition of taking perfectly good
songs and rearranging them so that people
sing all the parts that our forebears' designed
instruments do much, much better. Stanford
(somehow) has nine of these groups.
Based on science, a cappella began in the
time of cavemen, when our primitive ances
tors would harmonize their rudimentary
caveman utterances into a sound so vile that
it could take down a stegosaurus from 50
paces. How were cavemen and stegosauruses.
creatures separated by 150 million years,
around at the same time? Ask Testimony.
(For those of you who play drinking games
to my columns, "Testimony" should be the
top "buzzed-word" on your list for today.)
Now, some may say that my dislike of a
cappella stems from the fact that my own
singing voice sounds like a cross between Bob
Dylan's and some sort of cat pinned down by
a tractor. However, my sense of jealousy ac
counts for no more than 15 percent of my an
tipathy. From two songs into the first Fleet
Street performance I saw at Admit Weekend,
I knew that I disliked a cappella. with its over
dramatic soloists and its progressively less
ironic use of beatboxing.
But unfortunately, a cappella has bur
rowed itself deep into the intestines of Stan
ford like no other system of groups here have.
Take, for example,The O Show — a ceremo
ny that essentially serves as a showcase for ail
nine a cappella organizations and one or two
other performance groups. Not only is having
such a show unfair to the hundreds of other
groups we have on this campus, it's also unfair
to the hundreds of innocent freshmen who sit
through it in an already very busy orientation
week.
Additionally, whenever dorms need
someone to perform for parents, dorm shows
or ProFros. a cappella groups are normally at
the top of their lists. Why not a dance troupe,
or. much cooler, a rock band? At least with a
rock band.you can stand up and dance; with a
cappella shows, you try to remember the
songs as you once loved them as you pray for
the whiskey you snuck in to hit soon.
More frightening, unless you stop them, a
cappella groups will multiply. For every
singer given a spot in a group, three others
are jilted (This is an estimate. No one wants
to fess up to being rejected by Mixed Co.).
Nursing their wounds, these members re
group into an even worse a cappella troupe,
calling themselves something revolting like
"the Harmonics."
Now. this is not an attack on members of a
cappella groups — I count many (or, at least,
once counted many, depending on how many
people read this column) as friends, and I'm
happy to see people really enjoying them
selves in performances after spending count
less hours charting and learning to sing diffi
cult songs. But why do we need nine different

a cappella shows every quarter? Why can't
groups do more collaborative shows? l"he
number of new songs these groups come up
with per quarter is not particularly high, and I
think sharing shows might help whittle down
the best material from each.
On a more social level. I can assure you
from experience that nothing kills a party
quite as fast as the Mendicants drunkenly
belting "Brown-Eyed Girl." Actually, I take
that back — I can only imagine how terrible a
party would be if an inebriated Talisman
started singing a 40-minute rendition of the
national anthem. And anything by Testimony.
I fear, would be much, much worse.
I guess I don't really know what I want to
come out of this column, though 1 have a few
ideas. Maybe we could see a couple groups
merge,or better yet. we could create a school
wide ban on a cappella group proliferation.
(If we don't do something now. our children
may be forced to attend a Stanford with an
"'Bos video game theme music" group, a
"songs of Neil Diamond" group or maybe
even a "jazz-infused Kabbalah praise"
group.)
Or maybe I'd like to see other groups on
this campus more proportionately involved
in school events. We could have fewer rollouts
with Fleet Street singing in the lounge, and
more with Stanford Taiko pounding the hell
out of drums. That's sure to put a kick in any
freshman's morning.
Maybe we could even see a day where a
cappella shows engage audience members,
instead of expecting them to pay for admis
sion and sit through up to 90 minutes of songs
they have mostly heard before.
i think what I want most of all. though.is to
be able to say openly "I don't really care for a
cappella," without making it personal. When
the topic comes up. I don't want to have to see
if anyone easily offended is around.
I want to be able to state my dislike proud
ly, because it means that I have discovered
something about my personal tastes, which,
really, is what the arts community we need
here should be about: self discovery through
interaction with art. So if you like a cappella
or if you're a member of a group, that's fantas
tic — I hope you'll keep doing what you love
and won't hate me for writing this. Hut if you
don't fall into either of those categories, know
that it's OK not to like everything.
Even Testimony.

Send Kevin angry emails al ktwehKfStanford.edu,
though, if possible, he would pre fer angry sere
nades.
