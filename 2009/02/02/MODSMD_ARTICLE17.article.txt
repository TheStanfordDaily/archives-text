If John Lennon were around today, he
would have a solution for the financial
crisis. "Abandon your bailout plan." he
would plead to Treasury Secretary Paulson.
"Forget emergency interest rate cuts," he
would beseech of Federal Reserve Chair
man Bernanke. "All you need is love." he
would proclaim. "Love, love, love."
As complex and confounded as the Trea
sury bailout plan appears to be. it pales in
comparison to love. Who really under
stands love? Philosophers have propound
ed theories. Poets have composed verse. Bi
ologists have identified hormones and
pheromones. Yet they all remain far from
the answer.
The economist, on the other hand, has all
the answers. When faced with unanswerable
questions, it takes an economist's incentive
driven mind to come up with an acceptable
solution. So how would an economist ap
proach the incomprehensible matter of
love?
Well, for starters, love can be put into
terms an economist can understand. The
American love market, that of dating, is
characterized bv anxiety and horror stories,
but also by reservation prices and search
costs. Finding a partner bears a striking re
semblance to shopping for a plane ticket.
First, an individual sets their reservation
price. This is the absolute minimum they
would be willing to accept in their potential
partner. TTie reservation price is set based

on an individual's preferences, their "stan
dards" so to speak.
Those with so-called "high standards"
have high reservation prices and typically
have to search more than those with "low
standards." That is why your friends with
"high standards" are often not dating any
one while your friends with "low standards"
are dating three people at the same time.
Once the reservation price is estab
lished. participants in the market lor love
have to incur search costs. The idea is that
dating is the process by which you eventual
ly find love and live happily ever after.
As you search for love, you incur the
costs associated with dating and. more im
portantly. failed dates. There are the obvi
ous monetary costs, like that all-too-fancy
dinner for a girl who wasn't worth it. that
limo you rented when the subway would
have sufficed or that lavish gift you gave her
that you're now not getting back — econo
mists call that one a sunk cost.
Then there are non-monetary costs. Get
ting over the heartache of a break up. the
memories you shared, the plans you made
together — how can you put a price on that?
Think of the hours of productivity that the
global economy has lost to men and women
lying in bed. claiming they will never love
again. Forget interest rate cuts — we should
be handing out copies of "Blood on the
Tracks" to boost the economy.
The search for love is not just about
costs, though. There are many, many bene
fits — far too many to discuss, so thev arc

left to the reader's hopefully vivid imagina
tion (see your PI IE if you are unsure).
The economic formula for love is quite
simple. People set their reservation price
and then enter the market, searching for
that special someone, incurring costs and
accruing benefits all the while. Depending
on the level of the reservation price, and the
respective costs and benefits, an equilibri
um is established.
That equilibrium is reached at 27 years
of age and three partners, on average, ac
cording to the Michigan Institute for Social
Research. Now. if you have a high reserva
tion price because you are picky, high
search costs because you are demanding
and low benefits because you never have
time, then your equilibrium will be reached
at a later age and with fewer partners.Think
over-achieving Stanford students.
If John Lennon were around today, he
would not approve of this capitalistic por
trayal of love. "Reservation prices, search
costs, equilibrium." he would exclaim in a
panic. "Love is all you need." he would de
clare. And maybe a girl with kaleidoscope
eves.
