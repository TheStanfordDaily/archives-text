### DENIS GRIFFIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The Cardinal men came into this weekend of road play in
Southern California with the knowledge that time was running
out for them to find the kind of statement road win that could
help hoost them into the NCAA Tournament. They left it with
their backs absolutely against the wall.

GAME NOTES: Stanford has dropped to ninth in the
Pac-10 with three consecutive losses. After a demor
alizing loss to UCLA in Los Angeles, the
Cardinal looks to rebound on its home floor against
Washington State. Stanford lost to the Cougars in
Pullman, 55-54, but hopes to overtake redshirt senior
Taylor Rochestie (12.6 ppg) and his teammates this
time around.

Bruins led 69-38, a deficit from which Stanford had no chance
to recover.
" This was more disappointing than the close losses." Goods
told The San Francisco Chronicle after the game. "We actually
fought against USC."
It was a familiar foe that truly victimized the Cardinal once
again in Los Angeles, as UCLA point guard Darren Collison
proved once again why he's the best in the conference. Collison
disrupted the Cardinal offense at every turn, applying consistent
pressure on the ball and scoring 15 on the afternoon.
"Darren Collison played terrific on-the-ball defense." UCLA
coach Ben Howland told The Chronicle after the game. "Our de
fensive intensity starts with him. and so does our intensity on of
fense."
In part because of Collison's pressure. Stanford senior point
guard Mitch Johnson, who was so sorely missed a week ago in the
Cardinal's loss to Oregon State, committed six turnovers against
the Bruins.
Goods was the only player to reach double-digits offensively
against UCLA, scoring 15 points in 28 minutes and going 3-for-6
from three-point range. Junior Landry Fields was the next most
effective player for Stanford,even though he went 4-13 from the
field and had nine points in the game.
Collison. meanwhile, was joined by four other Bruins in dou
ble digits, as guard Jrue Holiday and center Alfred Aboya tied

Senior Anthony Goods was the only Cardinal player to reach double figures (15 points) in a brutal 97-63 loss at UCLA. With
the loss, which gives the Card a 3-6 Pac-10 record, Stanford's hopes for an NCAA berth look grim.
