# No rush at the Super Bowl
## 
### 
There was no way it was really
happening, was there? The
Pittsburgh Steelers and Ari
zona Cardinals, battling in a way that
was more than a respectable follow
up to last year's epic upset victory by
the New Vork Giants over the 19-1
AFC Champion New England Patri
ots. It was a game that carried a magic
all its own. that much is undeniable to
any who watched it. But more than
that, it was a game that carried its
own message.
Last year, the story was a simple
one — no matter how high-flying an
offense may be. no matter how many
points it is capable of putting on the
board, so long as your defensive line
is simply better than their offensive
line, as the Giants' DL was to the Pa
triots' front that day. you can win.
Simply stated, Tom Brady can't
throw touchdowns to Wes Welker,
Randy Moss, or anyone else if he's on
his back.
This year, we were treated to the
corollary to that lesson: a great pass
ing attack may not be unbeatable, but
man is it nice.
The Cardinals may have lost Super
Bowl XLIII (that's 43 to the non-Ro
mans among us), but if it weren't for
the aerial assault of Larry Fitzgerald
and Anquan Boldin. orchestrated by
the master of the three-ring aerial cir
cus. Kurt Warner, it wouldn't have
even been close. And does anyone re
ally doubt that the Cardinals were ca
pable of scoring again, if only there
had been more time?
But in case you didn't notice, the
Steelers weren't exactly a power rush
ing team in this one. either. Indeed, a
franchise known for its legacy of
smash-mouth football gained just 58
yards on the ground, with a 2.2 yards
per carry average. The birds from the
desert weren't much better, rushing
for just 33 yards on a slightly better 2.<S
yards per carry average.
No. what this year signaled was
something much different from last
year's reminder that a good pass rush
can beat a good rushing attack. It sig
naled that you don't need to be able to
run the ball to be a great team any
more.
Really, we should have seen this
coming. When is the last time a grind it
out. power running offense won the
Super Bowl? True, balanced attacks,
like those of the Patriots and Giants,
have won recently. And pass-first
teams that can throw the ball, but
aren't the most effective rushing of
fenses. have both won and been in
contention for winning it plenty in re
cent years. But ground-based attacks?
Well, the last one of those to triumph
was probably the Ravens in 2(XX),and
that win was really due more to the
strength of their defense than to the
legs of Jamal Lewis.
So. really, this is a trend we should
have picked up on before. But some
thing was different this time around
neither one of these teams even
made the pretense of relying on their
respective rushing attacks in this
game. No. this one was all about how
healthy I lines Ward was and whether
Ben Roethlisberger was over his con
cussion. About how the Steelers sec
ondary would deal with All-World
Arizona WR Larry Fitzgerald, and
how Warner's line would protect him
from the Steelers rush that would
surely be coming for him. It was a
game about the passing attacks and
about what the opposing defenses
would do to stop it.
How many times did we hear Tim
I Jightower's name? Willie Parker's or
Ldgerrin James'? Contrast that with
the quarterbacks, the receivers, the
defensive stars and you've got to won
der: where exactly did the run-first
philosophy go?
It's a question that might have Car
olina and Tennessee fans scratching
their heads right about now. Both had
dominant rushing attacks and defens
es during the regular season. Neither
made its way to the game that really
mattered. It's a question we might ask
Russ Grimm. Arizona's assistant head
coach. Grimm himself is a former
member of one of the most famed of
fensive lines of all time, the I logs, who
paved the way for the Washington
Redskins ground game in the IO.XOs,
and now he coaches an offensive line
that's all about keeping its quarter

back upright.The Cardinals didn't re
ally make much headway on the
ground this year — they were dead
last in rushing during the regular sea
son.
Whoever you ask. remember, the
rushing game certainly isn't dead.
You can tell because a good defense
still needs to be able to stop the run.
But from all appearances, it may just
be on life support.

Denis Griffin just cried a fter looking at
