## Stanford finds a second life A
						new lineup gives Card win over Long Beach State 
### JACOB JAFFE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
There really is no place like home
for the Stanford men's volleyball
team.
After starting the season with
eight road matches, the No. 6 Cardi
nal (7-3,3-2 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) finally returned home
this weekend. On Friday night, in
front of a raucous crowd in Maples
Pavilion, the Cardinal engineered a
massive comeback to edge No. 7
Long Beach State in five sets — 26-
30. 24-30. 33-31, 31-29. 15-8. In the
third set. it appeared the Cardinal
could get swept for the third match in
a row, but the Stanford defense was
up to the task, and the Cardinal
fought off all three match points by
Long Beach State.
"Blocking has been a huge im
provement this year for us." said jun
ior setter Kawika Shoji. 'it was cru
cial down the stretch in fighting off
match points on Friday. [Freshman
middle blocker] Gus Ellis had a great
blocking night."
Ellis had a team- and season-high
11 blocks in the match, and Stanford
had 18.5 blocks overall. 7.5 more
than it had in its past two matches
combined (both losses).
The star performer for Stanford,
though, was clearly outside hitter
Brad Lawson. The freshman had 27
kills, more than doubling his career
high of 13 kills, and nine more than
any other Stanford player has had all
year. He also had an ace, 11 digs and
hit an astounding .438 for the match,
including two kills to save match

points.
Shoji summed it up best: "Brad
Lawson was phenomenal."
Head coach John Kosty mixed up
the lineup after two lackluster per
formances against USC and Pepper
dine, starting three players for the
first time this season: junior outside
hitter Jason Palacios, freshman setter
Evan Barry and senior libero Jarod
Keller. Lawson. Ellis, senior middle
blocker Brandon Williams and soph
omore outside hitter Spencer
McLachlin joined the three newcom
ers for the first two sets.
Kosty hoped to provide a spark by
sitting his All-American setter, jun
ior Kawika Shoji. leading digger
freshman libero Erik Shoji and kill
leader junior outside hitter Evan
Romero for nearly all of the first two
sets. When the new starting lineup
could not get the job done in the first
two sets. Kosty inserted Romero and
both Shojis in the third set. With the
usual starters back in the lineup, the
Cardinal had more of an edge to its
play.
"I admit 1 was pretty fired up,"
Romero told reporters after the
game. "It was one of those situations
where you have no choice but to go
for it all."
As the match progressed, the Car
dinal defense tightened, and Long
Beach State's hitting percentage
dropped in each set from a high of
.415 in the first set to a low of .111 in
the fifth and deciding set.The Cardi
nal offense, on the other hand, used
the lineup change in the third set to
come back from poor hitting in the
first two sets and outhit Long Beach
State in each of the final three sets,
culminating in a .667 hitting percent
age in the final set.
Coming off such a hard-fought
and emotional match, the Cardinal
had no time to rest. Saturday night, it

faced off against unranked MPSF
foe UC-San Diego in Burnham
Pavilion in front of another wild
crowd.
The Cardinal dominated the first
two sets, winning 30-25 and 30-23, in
cluding a .548 hitting percentage in
the first set. But just when it looked
like the Cardinal would easily sweep
the overmatched Tritons, Stanford
ran into some problems, particularly
in serving.
"We got a little complacent after
two [sets], especially in the serving
aspect of the match, and they took
the momentum," Shoji said.
This complacency and poor hit
ting opened the door for UC-San
Diego to take the third set,3o-28.The
Cardinal's poor serving was bal
anced out by even poorer serving by
the Tritons, who had 25 service errors
to Stanford's 16. This helped Stan
ford take the last set 30-28 — the
final point of the match was fittingly
a service error by UC-San Diego.
The Cardinal led the Tritons in
just about every category, outhitting
them .361-.294, outdigging them 38-
30 and outblocking them 12.5-6.
Stanford was led by Romero's 18
kills and Kawika Shoji's 52 assists.
The weekend was important for
the Cardinal after a poor start to the
MPSF season.
"This weekend was huge for us."
Shoji said. "We needed to get two
wins and stop the slide. We have good
momentum heading into a tough
week."
The Cardinal will head to South
ern California to take on MPSF pow
ers UCLA and UC-Irvine before re
turning home for matches on Feb. 13
and Feb. 14 against Pepperdine and
USC. respectively.
