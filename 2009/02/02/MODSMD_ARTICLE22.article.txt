# Women's Swimming and Diving
## A
						splash of confidence 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's swimming
and diving team headed into their
last home meet with a chance to put
any questions about Pacific-10 Con
ference superiority to rest. Unfortu
nately for UCLA and USC, that is
exactly what they did.
The No. 2 Cardinal (19-0.6-0 Pac
-10) continued its dominance on Fri
day by demolishing the No. 20
UCLA Bruins 166.5-125.5.The meet
at Avery Aquatic Center showcased
a multitude of Stanford's talents.
However, no story was more capti
vating than senior Caroline Bruce "s
return from injury.
Bruce, a 13-time Ail-American
and seven-time NCAA champion,
competed on Friday for the first time
since the 2008 NCAA Champi
onships. Her time away from the
water did not appear to hamper her
ability, as she won the 100-meter
breaststroke for Stanford.
"Despite all the setbacks the past
couple of years [Bruce] has had to go
through, she pushed past all the ob
stacles and never lost her heart and
passion for the sport," freshman An
gela Duckworth said. "I would love
to personally commend her for her
passion, commitment, and persever
ance to the sport of swimming."
Junior Caroline Liu also compet
ed for the first time this season. She
recorded points for the Cardinal with
a second place performance in the
200-meter backstroke, and led off for

Stanford's "A" team in the 4xloo
freestyle relay.
Stanford looked very impressive
against the Bruins, recording first
place finishes in the first eight events
of the meet, and 10 of the first 11.

"This just shows
that the team bond
is always present."

DUCKWORTH,
freshman swimmer

Moreover, the freshmen swim
mers for the Cardinal gained valu
able experience in the win over the
Bruins. Freshmen Betsy Webb and
Sam Woodward, along with Duck
worth, each won an individual event
for Stanford, and the upperclassmen
followed suit for the rest of the meet.
"Winning is such a great feeling
especially with the whole team be
hind you." Duckworth said. "We
have so much talent on the team,
starting with the seniors all the way
down to the freshmen."
Stanford diving also failed to dis-

appoint. Following the lead of stand
out junior Carmen Stellar, the Cardi
nal swept the 1-meter and 3-meter
competitions. Sophomore Meg
Hostage followed close behind,
recording second place finishes in
both diving events.
Saturday's meet was a slightly dif
ferent story, as the Cardinal faced a
much tougher opponent in No. 12
USC. The Women of Troy were
ahead 116-110 after 12 events and
poised to upset Stanford at home.
However, the Cardinal refused to let
its most veteran swimmers lose on
Senior Day, and had just enough in
the tank for a final push. Stanford
pulled away late to win the meet 163-
137.
Stanford junior and Beijing
medal-winner Elaine Breeden ignit
ed Stanford with a victory in the 13th
event, the 100-meter butterfly. Fel
low juniors Kelley Hug and Nilasha
Ghosh came in second and fourth,
respectively, in the same race.
Most important for Stanford,
however, was the sweep of the 200-
meter individual medley, in which
Olympian and junior Julia Smit. out
standing sophomore Liz Smith, and
Breeden finished first, second, and
third, respectively.
Stanford clinched the victory over
USC with a win by the "A" team in
the 400 freestyle relay.
The Cardinal victory would not
have been possible against USC
without another solid performance
