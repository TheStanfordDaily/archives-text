Stanford now finds itself in a par
ticularly dire situation — ninth in
Pac-10 standings, ahead of only
Oregon's 0-9 conference record. A
truly disastrous losing streak, begin
ning with the loss to the Beavers a
week ago Saturday, has put any
hopes of Stanford reaching the
NCAA Tournament on life support.
The Cardinal would need to go 6-3
over its remaining nine conference
games just to finish .500 in confer-

ence play.
On the bright side for the Cardi
nal. the team now has just five road
contests remaining this year:
against California, Oregon State,
Oregon, Arizona State and Ari
zona. But this late in the season,
that positive comes with the caveat
that the Stanford men could still
use that statement road win to have
a shot at convincing members of
the selection committee that they
deserve a spot in the tournament.
That, of course, assumes that Stan
ford is able to play well enough
down the stretch to merit consider
ation.
"We know what the problem is
— we're not defending," Goods
told The Chronicle. "We're starting
from scratch."
The Stanford men will need to do

just that in order to be ready for
Washington State and Washington
this week. The Cardinal faces the
Cougars Thursday night at 7:30 p.m.
in a rematch of Jan. 10's 55-54 heart
breaker in Pullman, which was a big
part of the Cardinal's current down
ward spiral.
The loss in Los Angeles was one
of the worst in Stanford history, and
is tied for the program's worst mar
gin of defeat in the last 16 years. It
was a loss that head coach Johnny
Dawkins told The Chronicle was
undoubtedly the worst of the year
so far.
"Usually, you can find some pos
itive," he said, "but I don't think we
played well in any category."
