the complex and multifaceted
nature of the suggested changes,
some details of the proposal have
generated collective approval, while
other aspects have already begun to
stir up controversy.
"It's a lot to take in. especially
all at once." said Lovelee Brown

'11. "There are so many different changes pro

be able to get to know upperclassmen and ask
