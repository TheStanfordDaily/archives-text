ing spaces.
Alex Song '09, a res
idential assistant (RA) in
West Lagunita, famous for
its mini-doubles, was
delighted when he first
heard about the proposed
unstuffi ng.
"I am glad that
West Lag will be a more
accom modat ing residence
in the future," Song said.
"As it is now, the rooms are
a bit too small to fit two
people in."
Amanda Garvin '09

echoed the same sentiments about her past
experiences in Mirrielees.
"Mirrielees desperately needs to be
unstuffcd." Garvin said. "It's nearly impossible
to function properly when you have to live
with two other people in the space that's pro
vided."

But restructuring these overcrowded rooms
will significantly affect the composition of
houses and dorms on campus, and many stu
dents are strongly condemning the shifting
dorm dynamics that this new housing plan
entails. A portion of these grievances pertain
to converting the majority of Stern and Wilbur
Halls into all-frosh housing in the University's
efforts to bring freshmen together.
"I am not happy about the move away from
four-class dorms." said Mindy Schrag '10.
Schrag, who has lived in Soto, a four-class
dorm in Wilbur, for all three years of her
Stanford career, emphasized the advantages of
living with upperclassmen during her first year
on campus.
"As a freshman, it was a great resource to
be able to get to know upperclassmen and ask
them about classes or just general advice
about life at Stanford." Schrag said. "And now.
as an upperclassman. I love having freshmen

in the dorm. They're so much more
friendly and willing to meet people.
;ind there's just a higher energy in
the dorm with them around."
Even some advocates of the all
freshman dorm experience have
been reluctant to accept the pro
posed changes. Much of this con
troversy stems from the potential
fate of Branner. News of convert
ing the all-frosh dorm into housing
for upperclassmen has been met
with much criticism.
"It's not only freshmen; it's the
concept of 200 freshmen." said cur
rent Branner resident Christian
Smith '12. "It's a very large concen
tration of people who are going
through the same thing you are.
And it's unfortunate that freshmen
in the future won't be able to have
a really huge, reallv nice house like

Branner to experience that in."
Branner alumna Sarah Lee '10
agreed.
"Branner's infamous reputation
was one of the most memorable
parts of my freshman year," Lee
said. "Getting rid of it is erasing a
big part of a Stanford tradition.
Putting upperclassmen in Branner
won't make Branner what it is."
Despite some initial misgivings,
Branner RFs Clyde Moneyhun and
Nancy Buffington have accepted
their roles in the conversion.
"When Nancy and I applied to
be RFs, we specified a freshman
house," Moneyhun explained.
"When 1 first heard about
Branner's shift to upperclassmen, I
took some time to adjust to the idea
... but Nancy and I are now dedi
cated to making Branner the best
upper-class dorm on the campus.
We're still feeling our way. but we
expect the residents and staff will
teach us what we need to know."
Florence Moore RF Patrick
Young expressed similar emotions

about the prospective decrease in
freshmen living in West Flo.
"We're losing about 110 frosh.
and as a designated "swing space,'
we will probably be left with about
50 frosh in a normal year." Young
said. "1 really love working with
frosh. and I'm really sad to see
them go. but by and large. I think
these changes arc* good for the
University."
"Honestly, my life will probably
be a lot easier for obvious reasons,"
he added. "I'm committed to help
ing with the transition and making
sure this goes smoothly. I've already
got different ideas on what we can
do with the dorm next year."
Students are awaiting more con
crete details as the administration
moves forward with plans. This also
includes updates on a proposed
reform of the Draw system that will
allegedly guarantee better housing
options for upperclassmen.
"I think the three-tiered draw
system is a good idea because it
makes things more fair." Schrag said.

Song, on the other hand, is a bit
more skeptical.
"I would like to get more details
about the new system." Song said.
"However. 1 think a plan taking
into account seniority may be an
interesting change."
Moneyhun sees the bigger pic
ture, though, and he understands
the motivation behind the new
plan.
"Change is hard, and some of the
changes in the new housing plan are
pretty sweeping," he said. "Even so,
1 think reaction has been fairly pos
itive among people who understand
the goals behind the plan: unstuff
overcrowded houses, create
improved housing for upperclass
men— which all students will be
eventually — and concentrate more
freshmen in all-frosh houses, which
the majority of both incoming frosh
and outgoing alumni consistently
say they prefer for the first year."

benefits of "unstuffing" overcrowded rooms,
voicing support for the steps being taken
toward solving the problem of cramped hous-

ing spaces.
Alex Song '09, a res
idential assistant (RA) in
West Lagunita, famous for
its mini-doubles, was
delighted when he first
heard about the proposed
unstuffi ng.
"I am glad that
West Lag will be a more
accom modat ing residence
in the future," Song said.
"As it is now, the rooms are
a bit too small to fit two
people in."
Amanda Garvin '09

echoed the same sentiments about her past
experiences in Mirrielees.
"Mirrielees desperately needs to be
unstuffcd." Garvin said. "It's nearly impossible
to function properly when you have to live
with two other people in the space that's pro
vided."

But restructuring these overcrowded rooms
will significantly affect the composition of
houses and dorms on campus, and many stu
dents are strongly condemning the shifting
dorm dynamics that this new housing plan
entails. A portion of these grievances pertain
to converting the majority of Stern and Wilbur
Halls into all-frosh housing in the University's
efforts to bring freshmen together.
"I am not happy about the move away from
four-class dorms." said Mindy Schrag '10.
Schrag, who has lived in Soto, a four-class
dorm in Wilbur, for all three years of her
Stanford career, emphasized the advantages of
living with upperclassmen during her first year
on campus.
"As a freshman, it was a great resource to
be able to get to know upperclassmen and ask
them about classes or just general advice
about life at Stanford." Schrag said. "And now.
as an upperclassman. I love having freshmen

in the dorm. They're so much more
friendly and willing to meet people.
;ind there's just a higher energy in
the dorm with them around."
Even some advocates of the all
freshman dorm experience have
been reluctant to accept the pro
posed changes. Much of this con
troversy stems from the potential
fate of Branner. News of convert
ing the all-frosh dorm into housing
for upperclassmen has been met
with much criticism.
"It's not only freshmen; it's the
concept of 200 freshmen." said cur
rent Branner resident Christian
Smith '12. "It's a very large concen
tration of people who are going
through the same thing you are.
And it's unfortunate that freshmen
in the future won't be able to have
a really huge, reallv nice house like

Branner to experience that in."
Branner alumna Sarah Lee '10
agreed.
"Branner's infamous reputation
was one of the most memorable
parts of my freshman year," Lee
said. "Getting rid of it is erasing a
big part of a Stanford tradition.
Putting upperclassmen in Branner
won't make Branner what it is."
Despite some initial misgivings,
Branner RFs Clyde Moneyhun and
Nancy Buffington have accepted
their roles in the conversion.
"When Nancy and I applied to
be RFs, we specified a freshman
house," Moneyhun explained.
"When 1 first heard about
Branner's shift to upperclassmen, I
took some time to adjust to the idea
... but Nancy and I are now dedi
cated to making Branner the best
upper-class dorm on the campus.
We're still feeling our way. but we
expect the residents and staff will
teach us what we need to know."
Florence Moore RF Patrick
Young expressed similar emotions

about the prospective decrease in
freshmen living in West Flo.
"We're losing about 110 frosh.
and as a designated "swing space,'
we will probably be left with about
50 frosh in a normal year." Young
said. "1 really love working with
frosh. and I'm really sad to see
them go. but by and large. I think
these changes arc* good for the
University."
"Honestly, my life will probably
be a lot easier for obvious reasons,"
he added. "I'm committed to help
ing with the transition and making
sure this goes smoothly. I've already
got different ideas on what we can
do with the dorm next year."
Students are awaiting more con
crete details as the administration
moves forward with plans. This also
includes updates on a proposed
reform of the Draw system that will
allegedly guarantee better housing
options for upperclassmen.
"I think the three-tiered draw
system is a good idea because it
makes things more fair." Schrag said.

Song, on the other hand, is a bit
more skeptical.
"I would like to get more details
about the new system." Song said.
"However. 1 think a plan taking
into account seniority may be an
interesting change."
Moneyhun sees the bigger pic
ture, though, and he understands
the motivation behind the new
plan.
"Change is hard, and some of the
changes in the new housing plan are
pretty sweeping," he said. "Even so,
1 think reaction has been fairly pos
itive among people who understand
the goals behind the plan: unstuff
overcrowded houses, create
improved housing for upperclass
men— which all students will be
eventually — and concentrate more
freshmen in all-frosh houses, which
the majority of both incoming frosh
and outgoing alumni consistently
say they prefer for the first year."
