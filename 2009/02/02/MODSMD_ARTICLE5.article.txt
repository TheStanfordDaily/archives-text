With junior Jayne Appel and
sophomore Jeanette Pohlen strug
gling. the Stanford women's basket
ball team turned to a gritty veteran
and a developing star to lead them
to victory.
Senior Jillian Harmon and soph
omore Kayla Pedersen provided the
necessary spark in the second half to
give the No. 9 Cardinal a bK-51 win
over UCLA, Sunday at Maples
Pavilion.
After a miserable first 2(1 min
utes, when Stanford (17-4. 8-1
Pacific-10 Conference) shot less
than 30 percent from the field and
led the Bruins (14-b.5-4) by only two
points at the half, the Cardinal went
on a quick H-2 run to create some
separation, and never looked back

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal women are
coming off a solid win over UCLA,
their fourth consecutive victory. On the
road, Stanford will look to shut down
freshman guard Jazmine Perkins, who
averages 14.4 ppg for the Cougars.
Despite her youth, Perkins has quickly
adapted to Pac-10 play, and regis
tered her first double-double last time
out against Arizona.
