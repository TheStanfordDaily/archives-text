GAME NOTES: The Cardinal women are
coming off a solid win over UCLA,
their fourth consecutive victory. On the
road, Stanford will look to shut down
freshman guard Jazmine Perkins, who
averages 14.4 ppg for the Cougars.
Despite her youth, Perkins has quickly
adapted to Pac-10 play, and regis
tered her first double-double last time
out against Arizona.

as 20 as the game wound down.
"It wasn't necessarily a thing of beauty," said
Cardinal coach Tar a VanDerveer.
"We did what we needed to." I larmon added.
For the first half, UCLA was able to largely
stymie Stanford's attack, holding Appel scoreless

to lead all scorers at the break. At 25-23, the game
was entirely up for grabs.
But the Cardinal came out strong in the second
half, and the defensive rotations that the Bruins
used effectively at the start of the game — which
were predicated on hounding Stanford's shooters
and ball handlers — began to break down.
"We had a let-down in intensity," said UCLA
coach Nikki Caldwell. "The defensive scheme
went out the window."
At the same time,the Cardinal's aggressiveness
picked up.
"No one panicked." Harmon said. "We never
want to lose at home."
In particular. Stanford ran the floor well, with
Harmon asserting herself on the wing. She led all
scorers with 17 points, many of which came in tran
sition, but her biggest contribution may have been
on the glass — she had seven offensive rebounds,
which directly contributed to Stanford's 20-6 sec
ond-chance points advantage.
"• believe that was the difference in the game."
Caldwell said in reference to the Cardinal's offen
sive rebounding prowess."The second opportuni
ties Stanford got shifted the momentum their
way."
Harmon and Pedersen essentially played the
entire game, with Pedersen contributing 13 points
and nine rebounds of her own. Nine of her points
came on three-pointers.as the sophomore forward
continues to develop her game. While she was used
almost entirely as a power forward last season,
Pedersen has begun playing small forward in 2009,
allowing her to be more active on the floor.
"Kayla really helped us with her three point
shooting." VanDerveer said. "I like how kayla's
playing the three."

"I'm getting used to getting out and running,"
Pedersen said.
With the 6-foot-4 Pedersen assuming her new
role. VanDerveer is able to go more often with a
bigger lineup, often inserting freshmen Sarah
Boothe and Nnemkadi Ogwumike tocomplement
I larmon. Pedersen and Appel.
Ogwumike was particularly effective on Sun
day, recording a double-double with 11 points and
10 rebounds.
I ler presence was especially necessary in light
of Appel's and Pohlen's struggles — they com
bined to go K-25 shooting and 0-7 from the free
throw line.
But VanDerveer was able to find a silver lining
in their performances as other players stepped up
to fill the void.
"It wasn't Jayne's A-game." she said."But if she
didn't have her A-game a year ago. we were up a
creek."
Caldwell echoed her counterpart's point.
"They do a good job of balancing their attack,"
she said. "They have Batman. Robin and Batgirl.
They have so many options on offense."
While Pedersen and Ogwumike were valuable
contributors on Sunday, much of the credit went to
Harmon for her relentless play on both offense
and defense. The senior veteran's constant motor
has endeared her to the Maples faithful for years,
and has earned her the praise of both her coach
and her opponent.
"We need our team to be scrappy and aggres
sive." VanDerveer said. "That's Jill's signature."
"She is the glue to their team." Campbell
added. "She stepped up offensively and was solid
on the boards."
With wins over I >S(' and IJCLA this weekend,
Stanford is now X-1 at the halfway point of its Pae
-10 schedule.The women will face the Washington
schools at home this weekend, and will have the
chance for revenge against No. 7 Cal. who stand
one game above Stanford in the conference stand
ings after their Jan. IK win over the Cardinal in
Berkeley. Hie two teams meet again on Valen
tine's Day at Maples.
