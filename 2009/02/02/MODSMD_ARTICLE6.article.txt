# VPUE begins program cuts
## HPACs, PMs and NSO programs first to face the axe 
### MARISA LANDICHO KAMIL DADA 
The first wave of budget cuts that will
have a direct and noticeable effect on the
undergraduate population was announced
by Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman '79 in a Jan. 30
letter to the Stanford community.
The University's academic advising pro
gram will be dramatically pared down â€”
the Head Peer Academic Coordinator
(HPAC) and Peer Mentor (PM) programs,
some New Student Orientation (NSO)
programming, some training for residential
and writing tutors and honorarium to pre
major advisors will all be cut from the
budget.
Bravman added that he was not pre
senting an exhaustive list of reductions and
more may follow.
"These decisions were made after much
deliberation and consultation with campus
partners, and thev reflect our clear desire

to reduce program costs before having to
consider eliminating professional academic
staff and frontline positions." Bravman
wrote.
The vice provost explained that he was
confident that with the new academic
directors in place in every residential com
plex with freshmen, and the staff of profes
sional advisors located at the Office of
Undergraduate Advising and Research
(UAR). the University has a sufficiently
strong pre-major advising program.
The letter explained that the VPUE
derives a majority of its annual operating
income from funds invested in Stanford's
endowment and a smaller percentage from
the University's general funds. Therefore,
the sharp decline in the endowment
stronglv affects organizations such as the
VPUE.
