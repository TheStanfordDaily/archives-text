# VPUE begins program cuts
## HPACs, PMs and NSO programs first to face the axe 
### MARISA LANDICHO KAMIL DADA 
The first wave of budget cuts that will
have a direct and noticeable effect on the
undergraduate population was announced
by Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education John Bravman '79 in a Jan. 30
letter to the Stanford community.
The University's academic advising pro
gram will be dramatically pared down —
the Head Peer Academic Coordinator
(HPAC) and Peer Mentor (PM) programs,
some New Student Orientation (NSO)
programming, some training for residential
and writing tutors and honorarium to pre
major advisors will all be cut from the
budget.
Bravman added that he was not pre
senting an exhaustive list of reductions and
more may follow.
"These decisions were made after much
deliberation and consultation with campus
partners, and thev reflect our clear desire

to reduce program costs before having to
consider eliminating professional academic
staff and frontline positions." Bravman
wrote.
The vice provost explained that he was
confident that with the new academic
directors in place in every residential com
plex with freshmen, and the staff of profes
sional advisors located at the Office of
Undergraduate Advising and Research
(UAR). the University has a sufficiently
strong pre-major advising program.
The letter explained that the VPUE
derives a majority of its annual operating
income from funds invested in Stanford's
endowment and a smaller percentage from
the University's general funds. Therefore,
the sharp decline in the endowment
stronglv affects organizations such as the
VPUE.
ASSU Executives Jonny Dorsey '09 and
Fagan Harris '09 called a Sunday night
meeting with members of the
Undergraduate Senate to decide
the next steps in the budget advo
cacy process. Senators Luukas lives
'09, Yvorn "Doc" Aswad-Thomas
'11 and Senate Chair Shelley Gao
'11 attended the brief meeting.
ASSU President Jonny Dorsey
'09 said the cuts were unfortunate,
but necessary.
"I think the reality is that no
matter what these cuts are, they are
going to be sad and hard for the
community," he said. "The cuts are
going to suck, but I really appreci
ate that they took our input into
account."
Aswad-Thomas was more hesi
tant to embrace the first wave of
budget cuts. He particularly dis
agreed with the elimination of
I1 PACs.
"My HPAC and I were buddies,
but all that aside. 1 think they pro
vide a valuable resource to the
community." he said.
Siding with Bravman. lives said
the HPAC program never had a
defined purpose to'begin with.
"A junior or senior majoring in
god knows what is not the best
placed person to give specific
advice on your academic career,"
he said, lives supported the deci
sion to instead rely upon academic
directors.

Although the Senate already
endorsed four main principles —
academics, wellness, community
centers and frontline staff —
Dorsey and Harris called for the
Senate to make more concrete rec
ommendations.
"'The GSC came with very spe
cific concrete programs and cuts
for those programs," said Harris.
"[The Provost] was very receptive
to that."
Dorsey recognized that the
GSC had a smaller number of pro
grams to consider, but he wanted
the Senate to make the effort to
specify in future advocacy efforts.
The question for discussion,
then, was how to best narrow down
the four broad principles into actu
al program cuts.
Expressing the need for more
upperclassmen input, lives pro
posed holding a closed meeting of
select juniors and seniors to hold a
policy discussion. Termed a
"Student Expert Consultant
Meeting" by Aswad-Thomas, the
session will be held next week and
mediated by a GSC member.
Students will also be asked to
give ongoing feedback through the
ASSU Web site.
The details of budget advocacy
will be discussed at Tuesday's
Senate meeting, along with a fur
ther discussion of executive and
legislative roles.
