# STUDENT GOV'T
## Execs hold second Town Hall Students give feedback on future budget cuts 
### ZOE RICHARDS 
At their second budget-related
Town Hall meeting in as many
weeks, ASSU President Jonny
Dorsey "09 and Vice President Pagan
Harris '09 told students about their
meeting last week with Provost John
Etchemendy. which both executives
labeled a success.
"We thought it would go well, and
I think it went even better." Dorsey
said.
The two met with Provost
Etchemendy and the Budget

town hall was intended to maintain
the flow of communication between
students and their elected student
leaders.
Dorsey told students he hoped to
begin the process of clarifying more
concrete cuts the student body feels

move towards the budget decisions,
which are currently scheduled to be
made by mid-March.
"One of the areas that you guys
added the most to in this conversa

staff." Dorsey said. "A lot of the
other issues are things they would
have guessed students care about.
It's a little counterintuitive to the
administrators to say we'd rather
have these little program funds go to
staff members."
"We were pretty nervous going
