## Execs hold second Town Hall Students give feedback on future budget cuts 
### ZOE RICHARDS 
At their second budget-related
Town Hall meeting in as many
weeks, ASSU President Jonny
Dorsey "09 and Vice President Pagan
Harris '09 told students about their
meeting last week with Provost John
Etchemendy. which both executives
labeled a success.
"We thought it would go well, and
I think it went even better." Dorsey
said.
The two met with Provost
Etchemendy and the Budget
Committee last Thursday. Friday's
town hall was intended to maintain
the flow of communication between
students and their elected student
leaders.
Dorsey told students he hoped to
begin the process of clarifying more
concrete cuts the student body feels
would be possible to make as we
move towards the budget decisions,
which are currently scheduled to be
made by mid-March.
"One of the areas that you guys
added the most to in this conversa
tion was the part about frontline
staff." Dorsey said. "A lot of the
other issues are things they would
have guessed students care about.
It's a little counterintuitive to the
administrators to say we'd rather
have these little program funds go to
staff members."
"We were pretty nervous going
into the meeting." Harris said,
"because the University doesn't
have an obligation to listen to the
student body or the ASSU. and so we
put a lot of thought into our strategy
moving forward — how can we max
imize our position and leverage to
have constructive input?"
Fhe two executives said thev
engaged in open discourse with the
Provost, asking whether the student
voice was truly accounted for in
finalizing budget cuts.
"We asked him point-blank: Will
you listen to us? Do you care what
we have to say? And to that he said,
resoundingly, 'yes'" Harris said.
"[Etchemendy said] that the petition
and the letter to the administration
had already had a great deal of influ
ence helping them decide where the
priorities of the student body lie."
According to Dorsey and Harris,
there is much to be learned from the
GSC regarding an appropriate and
effective approach to budget cuts
and student priorities. Both noted
how the GS( formed a consensus on
programs that were of less impor
tance. and by prioritizing according
ly. they had a clear influence on
some ot the budget decisions that

are already taking effect.
Mililani Trask-Batti '10 came to
the ASSU Town Hall for a second
time with a group of other students
sporting matching T-shirts. Trask-
Batti is a member of the Stanford
American Indian Organization
(SAIO) and expressed her concerns
about potential cuts to the Native
American Center.
"Our whole point with the Native
American Center is that it kind of
takes all of the other priorities and
puts it in there so we have issues of
health and wellness that our commu
nity center offers to students and
frontline staff there that we care lots
about and academics." she said.
After the first Town I lall meeting
last week. Dorsey and Harris organ
ized and distributed an online peti
tion gathering student signatures.
"We did receive quite a bit of crit
icism regarding the kind of tone of
the letter lor the petition, saying that
it was less adversarial [than it should
have been]." Harris said. "We opted
lor a course of action that would
place a premium on a cooperative.

constructive relationship with the
Provost."
"It's important to note that this
process is happening along two
tracks — there's the graduate body
and undergraduate body." Harris
added. "[The budget committee] has
been working with the GSC on a
variety of issues and. to be honest,
they're a lot further along for a vari
ety of reasons, so they're at the point
as of yesterday of presenting specific
programs that they would like to see
protected. And that's kind of where
we need to get to as an undergradu
ate body."
According to the executives,
moving forward requires undergrad
uates to take on the challenge of fur
ther honing in on our highest and
lowest priorities.
Angelina Cardona '11. executive
cabinet chair of Mental Health
Initiatives, agreed.
"There are still some people that
need to be roped in." she said.
It's a zero-sum game because
smaller cuts in some areas mean big
ger cuts in other programs.

According to Dorsey. true power
comes through defining those areas
of most interest to students, as well
as areas that can afford cuts. He said
that it was important to recognize
that as these cuts are made, students
will equally be held accountable for
the suggestions they make.
In order to clarify student opin
ions and unify the student voice.
Dorsey emphasized the importance
ol students sharing their opinions
with undergraduate senators to set a
collaborative tone.
"Jonny and I are the official rep
resentatives of the student body, but
again, it's not up to us to decide
what these agenda items look like
— its up to you to decide: you have
elected representation to make that
happen." Harris said. "This is where
the rubber hits the road: this is
where we kind of roll up our sleeves,
take a hard look at what we've got
going on and make some tough
decisions."
