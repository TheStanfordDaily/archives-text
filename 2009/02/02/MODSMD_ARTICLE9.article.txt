## TROUBLE FOR LEADING SHIITE PARTY Iraqi election signals change 
### BRIAN MURPHY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
The biggest Shiite party in Iraq once
appeared to hold all the political sway:
control of the heartland, the hacking of
influential clerics and a foot in the gov
ernment with ambitions to take full con
trol.
But the days of wide-open horizons
could be soon ending for the Supreme
Islamic Iraqi Council, and replaced by
important shifts that could be welcomed
in Washington and scorned in Tehran.
The signs began to take shape Sunday
with hints of the voter mood from
provincial elections.
The broad message — built on Iraqi
media projections and postelection in
terviews — was that the eventual results
would punish religious-leaning factions
such as the Supreme Couneil that are
blamed for stoking sectarian violence,
and reward secular parties seen capable
of holding Iraq's relative calm.
The outcome of the provincial races
will not directly effect Iraq's national
policies or its balance between Washing
ton's global power and Iran's regional
muscle. But Shiite political trends are
critically important in Iraq, where ma
jority Shiites now hold sway after the fall
of Saddam Hussein's Sunni-dominated
regime.
"There is a backlash from Iraqis
against sectarian and religious politics."
said Mustafa al-Ani. an Iraqi political
analyst based in Dubai. United Arab
Emirates.
Although official results from Satur
day's provincial elections are likely still
days away, the early outlines are hum
bling for The Supreme Council. The
group had been considered a linchpin in
Iraqi politics as a junior partner in the
government that had near seamless po
litical control in the Shiite south.
Some forecasts point to widespread
losses for the party across the main Shi
ite provinces. The blows could include
embarrassing stumbles in the key city of
Basra and the spiritual center of Najaf
hailed as the future capital in the
Supreme Council's dreams for an au

tonomous Shiite enclave.
In their place, the big election win
ners appear to be allies of Prime Minis
ter Nouri al-Maliki. according to projec
tions and interviews with political fig
ures who spoke on condition of
anonymity because official results are
not posted.
It's a vivid lesson in Iraq's fluid poli
tics.
A year ago. al-Maliki looked to be
sinking. Shiite militiamen ruled cities
such as Basra and parts of Baghdad and
rockets were pouring into the protected
Green Zone, which includes the U.S.
Embassy and Iraq's parliament.
Al-Maliki — with apparent little ad
vance coordination with the U.S. mili
tary — struck back. An offensive broke
the militia control in Basra and else
where in the south. His reputation
turned around.
And many voters appeared happy to
reward his political backers in the elec
tions for seats on provincial councils,
which carry significant clout with au
thority over local business contracts,
jobs and local security forces.
"Al-Maliki ended the militiamen's
reign of terror," said Faisal Hamadi, 58,
after voting in Basra. "For this he de
serves our vote."
The Supreme Council, meanwhile,
appeared to stagger under the weight of
negative baggage.
11 was accused of failing to deliver im
provements to public services in the
south. Also, its deep ties to Iran began to
rub against Iraqis' nationalist senti
ments.
The Supreme Council's leader, Abdul
Aziz al l lakim. spent decades in Iran
during Saddam's rule and was allowed
an office-villa in downtown Tehran.
After Saddam's fall, the Supreme Coun
cil was Iran's main political conduit into
Iraq even though the group also devel
oped ties with Washington.
A Supreme Council lawmaker,
who spoke on condition of anonymity
because of the sensitivity of the issue, ac
knowledged the election mood was
against them.
"We controlled most provinces in the

south, so we were blamed for whatever
went wrong there," he said.
"The elections gave us an indication
of what will happen in the general elec
tion late this year." said the analyst al-
Ani. "Those who lost in this election
have nearly a year to learn their lesson
and change their strategy. They know
now where the Iraqis stand."
Nationwide turnout in the election
was 51 percent, said Faraj al-Haidari,

chairman of the election commission.
The figure fell short of some optimistic
predictions, hut was overshadowed hv a
bigger achievement: no serious violence
during the voting.
