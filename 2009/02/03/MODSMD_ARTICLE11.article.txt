## Editorial Admission office right to stand against Score Choice 
### 
This editorial originally ran on Jan. 15.
Getting into college is no longer as sim
ple as filling out an application. Many
students feel that they must feed into
the multi-million dollar test prep industry if
they are to receive an acceptance letter from
their dream school. Stanford alone cannot
turn the tide against the college application
frenzy, but it has taken a small step by reject
ing College Board's new Score Choice pro
gram for the SAT (see "Stanford rejects new
SAT Score Choice program" in the Jan. 7
issue of I Tie Daily).
The editorial board applauds the Office of
Undergraduate Admission's decision to re
quire all SAT scores from students/Tradition
ally, all SAT scores are sent by College Board
to colleges, hut with Score Choice, universi
ties will only see students' highest scores. We
agree with Stanford that taking a stand
against Score Choice is a way of preventing
students from trying to game the college ad
mission system.
While College Board argues that Score
Choice will help assuage students' anxieties
about havinga bad SAT score appear on their
records, we believe it will only contribute to
the anxiety of high school students nation
wide. Students likely will feel increased pres
sure to retake the test numerous times and
improve their scores as much as possible and
this will by no means be a stress-free process.
Such behavior contributes to a culture in
which students focus on gaming tests to get
into college, not on their genuine interests. A
student who scored 1430 and 1450 on two ver
sions of the SAT under the old system may
have accepted that a college would realize
this was how he or she generally scored. But
with Score Choice, that student may take the
test a dozen times until he or she finally gets
over a 15(H). Meaningful extracurricular pur
suits are suddenly replaced by countless
hours of testing and test preparation.
We also agree with Stanford that Score
Choice provides an advantage to wealthier
students, who can afford to take the test more
than one or two times. College Board coun
ters that low-income students can apply for
fee waivers. But students who did not grow up
in a world where families spend thousands of
dollars on test preparation and testing are less
likely than wealthy students to put them

selves through the trouble. Rural students,
furthermore, are unlikely to take advantage
of taking the SAT multiple times if testing
sites are inconveniently located.
Most importantly, well-off students have
more resources to prepare for the SAT and
improve their scores. An upper-middle-class
student has the opportunity to improve a se
ries of low scores with expensive test prepara
tion. while a low-income student does not.
With Score Choice, the disparity between
these groups — and even between well-off
families who are willing to shell out test
preparation funds and those who aren't —
will be exacerbated.
College Board, ironically, had a similar
policy to Score Choice between 1993 and
2002 for the SAT Subject Tests, according to
The New York l imes. When this practice was
discontinued, the organization cited the com
plexity of releasing scores and unfairness to
low-income students for ending the program.
We expect the same problems to persist.
Score Choice not only contributes to text
anxiety and economic disparities, but also to
an unhealthy culture in which students de
mand perfection of themselves. College
Board argues that Score Choice helps out stu
dents who may have a bad test day. Universi
ties. however, are likely to disregard fluke low
scores even without Score Choice. College
Board is instead sending the message to stu
dents that minor slip-ups are something we
should hide if at all possible.
There is no Score Choice for life. We can
not remove bad grades from our transcripts,
take back harsh words or hide mistakes on
the job. High school students taking part in
the anxiety-inducing test-prep culture need
to accept that a small failure is not the end of
the world. Otherwise.students go through life
thinking they need to game the SA T into an
elite college, then game their way into perfect
grades, a top graduate school and the perfect
job.The cycle only ends with disappointment.
So many of us need to learn that it's okay to
make mistakes.
We're proud that Stanford has taken a
stand against this anxiety-feeding culture.
Now all we can do is wait and hope that the
strcssed-out high school students excessively
worrying about improving their SAT score
just one more time will see the value in Stan
ford's message.
