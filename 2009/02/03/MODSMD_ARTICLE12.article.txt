## I need a bailout 
### 
This column originally ran on Nov. 21,2()0<5.
I need a bailout. You. Stanford students.
alumni, faculty and staff, are the only
ones who can help me. And by helping
me, you're really helping yourselves.
Please allow me to explain. I am in a
somewhat perilous situation. I have been
working to my utmost, but vast troubles
loom on the horizon. I may not be able to
pass my classes this year, and I don't know
how I will find a job. II Stanford does not
come to my aid. I may go down, and let me
tell you. il I go down, the consequences for
our community will be grave.
I am an institution here. I am so deeply
tied into the Stanford community;one might
say that I am the hub of a series of groups
and organizations. In many instances. I pro
vide the spark required to jump-start differ
ent ideas and activities. Without me to help
steer, our community will certainly careen
out of control and crash.
I would like to be clear: I am not asking
for a bailout just for the sake of it. I truly
need help to keep myself on the road. Plus. I
had no way of knowing I'd he in this situa
tion beforehand. I assure you. my current
troubles are completely and totally unex
pected.
How could I have anticipated that my
classes would be just as hard, if not harder
than, before? How should I be expected to
know that the job market would be so diffi
cult? How could I have possibly forecasted
that foreign competition would be so tough?
Who knew taking notes in class actually mat
tered or that you are supposed to do the
reading?
Now. I'm on the rocks,and I need help to
make sure I can go on to keep Stanford's
name strong. Other people have an easier
time getting jobs because they happen to
have grown up in a foreign country or be
cause they had nine languages spoken to
them as a child, or because they weren't
watching You Tube during class.
Why am I being discriminated against?
Just because I didn't have some of those ben
efits, I shouldn't just be ignored. I mean
everyone has to skip class for three weeks to
catch up on I V shows once in a while. I've
just been trying to live the American dream
by putting my head down and working as
hard as I can, but my hardest is no longer
enough,and I need help. You believe in that
too. don't you? That as long as you're willing
to work hard, you can achieve anything?
See. I knew it! Ibis is good, we're connecting.
I'm not asking for much $25 million

would suffice.That's nothing! At the begin
ning of this year, our endowment was $17.1
billion. My requested amount is naught but a
tenth of a percentage of our entire amount.
That's the sort of thing you just round off
anyway. No one would even notice.
I loncstly. what's the big deal? It's not like
I'm the only one who's needed some help re
cently. Why would you penalize someone
like me, a simple, hard-working American
son from the Midwest, for the bad judgment
of some bums half a nation away? Or. for my
own bad judgment and lack of foresight? I
mean. I gave it a shot — come on!
Yeah. yeah. I know what you're going to
say. You want me to change. You think that if
I become more efficient with my energy. I'll
be able to do a lot better. Well, let me tell you
something. I have been working on my ener
gy efficiency ever since I started in this
school. It's just hard to change something
overnight. If you give me this bailout. I will
finally be able to turn the ignition on this and
get it going from zero to 60 in no time at all.
Do you really want the alternative? Do
you want to live in a community where our
school allows our students to fail academi
cally and professionally? If so. why have you
already put so much investment into classes,
departments and extra-curricular activities?
I know you folks care about me.
Hunk about the spin-off effects if I'm not
bailed out. Without me, those poor donors
are never going to get their beloved Stan
ford [ und letters. Without me. mv dorm
mates would be sad and lonely. Without me,
Moonbeans will have no one to whom they
can sell their scrumptious cookies. In other
words, the fabric of the Stanford community
will be torn asunder. I)o you re;illv want that
to happen on your watch? I don't think so.
I take cash or personal checks only. No
credit card or wire transfers accepted. Iliank
you.
