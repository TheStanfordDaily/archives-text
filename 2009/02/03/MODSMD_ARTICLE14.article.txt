## The 						new (gotcha) media 
### 
This column originally ran on Jan. 7.
200K was a banner year for what is now
apparently being called "citizen journal
ism."The existence of water on Mars was
publicized not by NASA, but by Twitter — as
were the earthquakes in China. Television
journalist Tim Russert's death was first an
nounced not on his employing network NBC,
as had been protocol in such circumstances,
but by an anonymous edit to his Wikipedia
page, made before his family was alerted of
his passing.
It is self-evident that as traditional media
outlets (read: print newspapers) continue to
downsize their staff and technological ad
vances make the dissemination of current
events a collective endeavor, the barrier be
tween plebe and reporter becomes increas
ingly obsolete.
We are all journalists, and in a way that
seems both sensible and appropriate. If a cit
izen journalist witnesses an important event
before a bona fide professional, then whv
shouldn't he or she share it? And at a mo
ment of debatably unsurpassed political en
gagement in America, the democratization of
news gathering is an effective way to main
tain this fervor.
The paradigm shift from journalism as the
duty of the privileged few to journalism as a
free-for-all has occurred so rapidly as to seem
both inevitable and inviolate. Still, we can
sense when a line has been crossed; the an
nouncement of Russert's death could have
been delayed for two hours with no conse
quences for the public,especially when com
pared to the consequences for his family.
The argument that standards must be put
into place for new media reporting, along
with the companion argument about the im
possibility of enforcing such standards, is an
old one. What has not been sufficiently dis
cussed is whether this brave new reporting is
not. in certain situations, self-defeating.
Citizen journalism promises unprece
dented immediacy; we therefore assume that
it will encourage greater candor and richer
discourse. In particular, we hope it will bring
us closer to those who lead us. whose opin
ions and actions we are so anxious to know.
But citizen journalists, armed with all the
privilege of old-school reporters and none of
the ethical obligations, only drive us further
from this possible synergy. Continuously
poised to make even the most off-handed
comment a viral spectacle, citizen journalists
simultaneously demand communication with
politicians and discourage them from speak
ing frankly. The result is an inundation of di
alogue paired with a scarcity of substance
that has already been evidenced in the recent
presidential election and will no doubt char
acterize the way we interface with our lead
ers — or don't — for a long time.
Consider one of the more ambiguously
ethical uses of citizen journalism over the
past year: Mayhill Fowler attended a private
dinner in support of Barack Obama this past
April. It was at this event that Obama made
his now infamous comment about those
heartland Americans who "cling to guns and
religion," which Fowler duly noted and pub
lished on Huffington Post.
Traditionally, members of the press have
been obligated to declare themselves as such
when appearing at any sort of public gather
ing. Fowler declined to do so, yet her experi
ence of the event w as utilized to shape a news
story about Obama's comment on what
media service company Technorati recently
ranked as the most popular blogon the Inter
net
It has been argued that Obama did not de
serve protection from Fowler. Obama made
his comment in front of a group, after all, and
potential voters elsewhere have a right to ad
ditional information that would give them a
sense of who they may be endorsing.
Such contentions are valid until studied in
a larger context. (Obama thought he was
speaking to a group of supporters in confi
dence. and he directed his speech towards
them.| Was the insight that an undecided
voter gained from this sound bite worth the
price of increased recalcitrance on Obama's
part overall?
Obama is constantly engaging with the
media (in the month following his election,
he set the record for number of press confer
ences held by a President-elect), but his ap
pearances are so tightly managed as to make

the endeavor all hut worthless.The Washing
ton Post suggested that the journalists who
interviewed Obama in the wake of his elec
tion may have been "pre-selected by his
aides." The New York Times has quoted sev
eral of Obama's advisors as acknowledging
that their strategy for media management
parallels that of the Bush administration in
its structure and rigorousness.
We can all agree that politicians as a group
talk too much and do too little, hut the vigi
lance of millions of bloggers and Twitterers
necessitates an unprecedented level of infor
mation control. The desire of citizen journal
ists to circumvent the bureaucracy inherent
in traditional journalistic practices is under
standable. but their methods are self-defeat
ing. The harder they press, the more elusive
Obama and his ilk become, generating a con
tinuous feed of babble nil the while.
In the act of running for public office, po
litical leaders implicitly agree to be forthright
and responsible in all their dealings, and to
make themselves available to public scrutiny.
The media is integral to guaranteeing the
ethicality of politicians; as such, it should not
have to rely on fraudulent techniques to do
so.
We've already seen how. in the announce
ment of Russert's death, citizen journalism

can violate ethical boundaries — and how,
on a pragmatic level, it threatens to further
erode the quality of political discourse.
There is, of course, no way to guarantee
that everyone with a story and an Internet
connection considers the implications of his
or her actions. As such, it falls to those who
provide a forum for new media reporting to
punish those who act inappropriately.
The person who updated Russert's
Wikipedia entry early was fired from his or
her job at Internet Broadcasting Services (in
spite of—or should I say. because of —
pleading ignorance at the implications of the
gesture). If Huffington would hold her con
tributors to similar standards, that would be a
good place to start.
When Governor Sarah Palin complained
about the "gotcha media," we all laughed at
her. Journalists worth their salt ask hard
questions, fact-check and follow up. But good
journalists also respect themselves and their
readers enough to do the task with integrity,
while doing it well, and the rest of us could
learn from them. The future of political dis
course depends on it.
