From there it was smooth

No. 22 .Shields at No. 1 singles, 7-5. 6-7, 10-5;
Thacher also went to three sets at No. 2 singles, but
could not pull out the victory, falling to Kean Feed

the match with his second victory of
the weekend, a 6-2,6-4 victory over
Lukas Marsoun at No. 3.
"Even without the doubles
point, our team is good enough and
has the ability to beat anybody from
one to six," Muller said. "As long as
everyone competes, there isn't real
ly a reason we can't win a lot of
matches."

The Cardinal has qualified for
Chicago in two weeks, but will not
head there yet â€” they will play a
dual match against BYU this Friday.

the other 14 of the top 15 teams in
the nation.
"We played [the second match]
without one of our better players
(Klahn), and we were still able to
pull it out." Muller said. "We experi
enced a lot of tough aspects of col
lege tennis [this weekend [.The team
handled it very well. Overall it was a
uood showing."
