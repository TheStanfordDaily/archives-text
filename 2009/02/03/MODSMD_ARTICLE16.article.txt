Despite falling to Oregon State on Fri
day afternoon. Stanford wrestling rallied
in the evening to win two matches against
Portland and Princeton University. The
victory over Portland brings the team its
first win against a Pacific-10 Conference
opponent this season.
Several slips in close matches toppled
Stanford (6-12-1) in a 25-9 loss against
Oregon State, but the Cardinal decisively
pounded the Vikings 29-12 and the Tigers
31-13. Three Cardinal wrestlers posted
perfect, three-win days: redshirt sopho
more I.ucas Espericueta. redshirt fresh
man Nick Amuchastegui and junior Jake
Johnson. Iliese wrestlers were the only
three to earn victories over Oregon State.
Matt Scencebaugh started the tourna
ment with determination, falling behind
at first, but getting his Oregon State oppo
nent on his back in the last few seconds.
The freshman's comeback, however, was
not enough to close the scoreboard gap.
and Scencebaugh had to settle for a 14-9
loss. Sophomore Porfirio Madrigal, red
shirt sophomore Cameron Teitleman and
redshirt junior Tyler Parker then suffered
three losses in a row to leave Stanford
with a 13-0 deficit.
At 157 pounds. I.ucas Espericueta
brought Stanford its first victory of the
day. I le followed a quick takedown in the

first period with two more in the rest of
the match for an 11 -4 win. Amuchastegui
then capitalized on his chance for revenge
against Oregon State opponent Keegan
Davis — the Beavers'junior beat him at
the Reno Tournament of Champions in
December.
"I was more prepared in this match: I
felt fresher since last time |l faced Davis]
was in the middle of a tournament,"
Amuchastegui said. "I was mentally pre
pared for a hard match."
The redshirt freshman's preparation
proved necessary. Down 4-3 going into
the third period. Amuchastegui earned a
one-point escape to tie it up. He then
scored a takedown with only 20 seconds
left to win 6-4. •
l<S4-pound Jake Johnson also surged
from behind to score a takedown in the
final 30 seconds for a 7-6 victory. Senior
Luke Feist also battled through a close
match, but Oregon State's Chad Hanke
got a takedown with only two seconds left
to take the match.
Adding injury to insult, the Cardinal
ended the Oregon State match on a sad
personal note: As if the team loss wasn't
bad enough. Matt Winterbourne —
Stanford's sole heavyweight wrestler
who had just re-entered competition
after healing a back injury — tore a liga
ment in his knee halfway through his
match, lie has been consigned to crutch
es and will not be able to wrestle for the

GAME NOTES: Prior to defeating Princeton, the Cardi

Portland State 29-12 during the four-team meet last
weekend. Also, several Cardinal wrestlers participat

rest of the season.
"I was defending and my knee just
buckled." Winterbourne said. "It was a
freak accident."
Despite the brevity of his current sea
son. the redshirt freshman still holds
wrestling close. In fact. Winterbourne is
already planning his comeback.
"I'm definitely looking forward to
making more noise next year." he said.
The back-to-back matches against
Portland and Princeton saw many re
demptions and personal achievements,
besides the Stanford team's overall dom
ination.
"Earlier in the season, when we lost a
dual match, we would have a hard time
bouncing back," coach Jason Borrelli
said. "This time, we got beat, and the team
was able to put it behind them."

bounced hack from their earlier de
feats to take down their opponents.
Teitleman shut out his Portland op
ponent 4-0. By the time Johnson
emerged victorious against Portland
at IS4 pounds, Stanford had guaran
teed its first victory against a Pac-1()
opponent. Though Winterbourne's
injury caused a forfeit in the heavy
weight class, Stanford won 29-12.
The Cardinal's newfound mo
mentum carried it through the night,
as Stanford proceeded to trample
Princeton 31-13. Scencebaugh set a
positive tone in the first match of the
night, flipping the Tigers' Robert

Benitez twice to gain an 11 -0 lead by
the second period. He won 12-1 to
score a bonus point for the Cardinal.
Princeton then forfeited two match
es to fall behind 16-0.
Amuchastegui said his match was
"closer than expected," but he man
aged to edge-out Tiger freshman
Andy Lowy 9-7.
"There was lots of crazy stuff I
hadn't been anticipating, lots of flip
flopping," Amuchastegui said.
However, it was worth the fight.
Amuchastegui's continued winning
streak tied him with Zach Zimmerer
'00 to earn the fifth-most wins of any
rookie wrestler in school history.
Johnson — the team's current win
leader — also achieved a personal
milestone with the 60th win of his
career against Princeton.
"The thing about Jake," Borrelli

said, "is he's probably the best con
ditioned wrestler on our team so he
always thinks he can outwork his op
ponent, always thinks he can win."
By the time Feist wrestled
against Portland and Princeton,
Stanford's victories were already
determined. However, he pinned
both his opponents to bring his ca
reer pin total to 25. Feist now stands
as the Pac-10's season pin leader and
took fifth place on Stanford's all
time chart.
As individual wrestlers' achieve
ments grow and Stanford begins to
rack up wins, the team looks to con
tinue improving throughout the sea
son. This Friday, Stanford will take
on Arizona State at home at 7 p.m.
