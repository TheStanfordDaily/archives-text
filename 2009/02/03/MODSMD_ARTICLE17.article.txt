Senior Blake MulW is the only
member of his claslp'n the
Stanford men's tennis team-

His leadership is just one
reason the Cardinal was
i able to qualjfy for the ITA
National Indoor Cham
pionships.

Over the weekend, the No. 5 Stanford women's tennis
team picked up two dual-match victories over No. 51 Col
orado and No. 36 Illinois, improving to 3-0 on the season.
With a pair of dominant 6-1 wins, the Cardinal women
played above their current lIA ranking.

"This weekend
we played really
well." said junior
Lindsay Burdette.
"I think we even
shocked ourselves
and our coaches
this weekend, espe
cially with doubles
play. We definitely
didn't get a huge
number of singles
matches under our
belts in Palm
Springs and in
Vegas, so to come
out as sharp and
steady as we were
was definitely a
pleasant surprise
for all of us."

Despite a young squad this season, qualifying for the
Indoors was never in question for a storied Cardinal pro
gram.
"We were hands down fully expecting to blow these
teams away." Burdette said."But I think that the question
marks were how our doubles teams were going to match
up with the few changes in the past couple weeks.Taking
matches was never in question though."
Last Friday. Stanford blew past Colorado, sweeping all
three doubles matches. The top half of the lineup also
dominated in singles, becoming a common theme in this
year's matches. A co-captain of the squad. Burdette won
6-2,7-5 in the afternoon.
"As far as singles for me. there's no substitute for
match play." Burdette said. "I got better every single
match in the past five days,and hopefully that will contin
ue throughout Indoors."
At the bottom half of the lineup, the freshmen held
their ground, with (ourtney ( 'layton clinching the match
over 6-0,6-2 victory. However, freshman Veronica Li re
tired from her singles match at No. 5 due to a pulled stom
ach muscle.
"Veronica unfortunately has been struggling with a
stomach muscle pull which has made her results look
dicey." Burdette said. "But as soon as that heals up. she
and ( ourtney [Clayton| are going to be great down there.
If she's still struggling with the muscle by indoors. Jen
nifer Yen will come in and clean up shop ;is well."
