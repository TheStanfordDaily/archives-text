Senior Blake MulW is the only
member of his claslp'n the
Stanford men's tennis team-

His leadership is just one
reason the Cardinal was
i able to qualjfy for the ITA
National Indoor Cham
pionships.

Over the weekend, the No. 5 Stanford women's tennis
team picked up two dual-match victories over No. 51 Col
orado and No. 36 Illinois, improving to 3-0 on the season.
With a pair of dominant 6-1 wins, the Cardinal women
played above their current lIA ranking.

"This weekend
we played really
well." said junior
Lindsay Burdette.
"I think we even
shocked ourselves
and our coaches
this weekend, espe
cially with doubles
play. We definitely
didn't get a huge
number of singles
matches under our
belts in Palm
Springs and in
Vegas, so to come
out as sharp and
steady as we were
was definitely a
pleasant surprise
for all of us."

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal is currently the
No. 5 team in the nation and is undefeat
ed on the season. The match against Cal
Poly is the last tune-up before the Card
travels to Madison for the National Team
Indoor Championships. Following that
contest, Stanford will enjoy 12 of its 15 re
maining matches at home.

son record, the Cardinal women also punched their tick
ets to the ITA National Team Indoor Championships in
Madison, Wis. next week. Stanford will he making its 15th
appearance at the Indoor Championships.
Despite a young squad this season, qualifying for the
Indoors was never in question for a storied Cardinal pro
gram.
"We were hands down fully expecting to blow these
teams away." Burdette said."But I think that the question
marks were how our doubles teams were going to match
up with the few changes in the past couple weeks.Taking
matches was never in question though."
Last Friday. Stanford blew past Colorado, sweeping all
three doubles matches. The top half of the lineup also
dominated in singles, becoming a common theme in this
year's matches. A co-captain of the squad. Burdette won
6-2,7-5 in the afternoon.
"As far as singles for me. there's no substitute for
match play." Burdette said. "I got better every single
match in the past five days,and hopefully that will contin
ue throughout Indoors."
At the bottom half of the lineup, the freshmen held
their ground, with (ourtney ( 'layton clinching the match
over 6-0,6-2 victory. However, freshman Veronica Li re
tired from her singles match at No. 5 due to a pulled stom
ach muscle.
"Veronica unfortunately has been struggling with a
stomach muscle pull which has made her results look
dicey." Burdette said. "But as soon as that heals up. she
and ( ourtney [Clayton| are going to be great down there.
If she's still struggling with the muscle by indoors. Jen
nifer Yen will come in and clean up shop ;is well."

On Saturday, Stanford was set to
face Illinois for a spot at the Indoor
Championships. However, the third
place match ran an hour longer than
expected, leaving the Cardinal wait
ing to begin its match.
"We were definitely sitting up in
the office trying to keep ourselves
occupied." Burdette said. "We did a
really good job of keeping it light
and fun in the meantime, and going
out there and putting on our game
faces."
And certainly, the one hour wait
could not delay the inevitable. Stan
ford came out strong again with yet
another sweep of the doubles point.
Burdette and sophomore Hilary
Barte teamed up to dispatch their
opponents 8-3.
"Doubles has been unbelievable
the past couple matches," Burdette

said. "Hilary and I really found our
place when we broke through in
Palm Springs. We've been feeling re
ally good even when the match is
close. Our hopes are so much higher
for this year than last year."
In singles, Co-Captain Jessica
Nguyen dropped a hard-fought
match in a 7-6(3),6-2 decision. I low
ever. Barte and Burdette picked her
up with a pair of 6-2. 6-0 wins, and
Clayton was able to clinch the sec
ond match of the weekend with a 6-
0,6-3 win.
High on a three-match win
streak, the Cardinal is ready to ac
cept whatever challenges come its
way in Madison.
"Our expectations are to go in
there and give it all we got." Burdette
said. "We have every ability to beat
any team in the nation. Between now
and then, we're going to continue to
solidify our doubles teams and focus
on making sure everybody's healthy
because our singles are going great
with everyone healthy."
The Cardinal women are two

years removed from their last In
door Championship. In the last two
years, including the match that
broke their 89-match win streak.
Stanford has been ousted by Geor
gia Tech. Still, with a young squad,
Stanford is aware that they have
nothing to lose heading into this
year's tournament.
"If we go out there, put our best
foot forward and come short, to me
that won't be a disappointment at
all." Burdette said. "YVe need to cul
tivate the idea that we're going out
after it. We're young, so the pressure
is on the other teams, especially in
the later rounds, and we're going to
use that to our advantage."
"As long as we go out after it.it
doesn't matter whether we fall short
or not." she added.
Before ITAs, Stanford will have
one final tune-up in a home match
against Cal Poly on Thursday, sched
uled to begin at 1:30 p.m.
