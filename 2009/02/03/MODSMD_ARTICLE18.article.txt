dent over history. When llir Dark
Knight came out this summer, lor ex
ample, it was instantly catapulted
into IMDB's top ten movies of all
time, better than Casablanca,
Schindlcr's List, and The Wizard oj
Oz. We rush to make grand procla
mations, and in our fury, we discount
precedent.
Sportswriters are no different.
"We overreact. We assume that
whatever we're seeing now is bigger
or better or more important than
what we saw then. We forget the past.
We dishonor it." writes (iregg! )oyel.
Those are important words, ex
cept that Doyel then spent an article
trying to prove why that wasn't the
case.
But. of course, it is
Only through our capriciousncss
can we call Super Bowl XI 111. a
game that was. for fift\ minutes, one
of the more boring games ol the year,
one of the best ever.
This wasn't like the San Antonio
Spurs winning a championship be
cause of purely fundamental pla\
that isn't exciting to watch. No. this
game was hardly about the grind-it
out football basics il was sloppy
and poorly refereed. I lie final ten
minutes — which gave us one of the
most exciting Super howl endings,
ever—did not make the rest ol tin
game moot.
If you had said "game over" after
Arizona punted earl\ in the fourth
quarter down 20-7, I wouldn't have
blamed you. I lalf of Arizona's drives
ended in punts, and not neccssarih
because of Pittsburgh's defensive
fortitude, but rather because Kurt
Warner seemed to forget that I arr\
Fitzgerald existed until the fourth
quarter. There were dropped kick
offsand IS penalties between the two
teams. Despite a Cardinals defense
that looked out of syne in the In si
half, the Steelers could only score
one offensive touchdown in the fiist
three quarters, instead settling for
two Jeff Reed chip shots, one ol
which was aided by *5 yards ol Ari
zona penalties.
Ah.yes.the Zebras. I he 2(MW post
season was marred by controversial
refereeing, from the defensive hold
ingcall in overtime of the Indianapo
lis-San Diego wild card game, to the
no-call on a delay of game in the Mai
timore-Tennessee divisional battle,
to the multitude of questionable calls
in the Super Bowl.
On just the aforementioned field
goal drive alone, the Steelers were
handed 15 yards on an absurd rough
ing the passer penalty, and a first
down at the Arizona foiu yard line
after an equally bizarre roughing the
holder call. Before the fourth quar
ter, the Cardinals had ten penalties
called on them to Pittsburgh's two.
I'm not going to be the guv who
says that the refs stole the Super
Bowl. I'm sure there will be plenty of
those voices emanating from
Phoenix (and a still bitter Seattle)
over the next few days.
But. I do follow Jason Whit lock's
line of reasoning, that "on a play to
play, quarter-to-quarter basis", it was
Terry MeAulay's crew that stole the
show.
So, until the Cardinals' offense
woke up in the fourth quarter, we had
one notable play (James Harrison's
miraculous interception return lor a
touchdown) that stood out amongst
penalty-ridden, mundane football
the game wasn't acliflhanger.it was
n't notable.
And then came a furious finish,
where Arizona scored two touch
downs and recorded on safety to take
a late lead before Ben Boelhlisberg
er and Santonio Holmes hooked up
for the game-winning touchdown
with less than a minute icmaining
I"he ending led writers across the
country,from Don Banks to Michael
Silver, to proclaim Supci Bowl XI 111
as the best there ever was the for

Indeed, it's interesting to watch
writers elevate this year's game to
the top of the pantheon when last
season's contest is still fresh in our
minds — one that featured the
greatest play in Super Bowl history,
historical connotations, well-execut
ed football on both sides that kept it
close throughout,and. in light of this
year's travesty, some of the most
widely recognized, best refereeing
in a championship game.
Super Bowl XLIII had an ending
and an interception return for the
ages.but that's aboyt it. Let's consid
er the whole product before making
these inane snap judgments.
But I won't kid myself — if next
year's game has even a modicum of
excitement in the fourth quarter. I'll
be back in this space, writing this
same column, because to our most
impulsive football analysts, the im
mediate past always trumps history.
