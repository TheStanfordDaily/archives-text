## Thomas Fingar defends intelligence establishment, surveys Bush decisions 
### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A signed portrait of an old friend and
boss, former Secretary of State Colin Powell,
looks down at his desk. Black-and-white
snapshots with men in 1970s Mao jackets
line another window. A few eulogizing
plaques from intelligence units here, more
photos over there — it is enough memorabil
ia to suggest two lifetimes' worth of work bv
this man who once scrutinized the most crit
ical intrigues of the contemporary globe.
Plodding, precise and unassuming, Dr.
Thomas Fin gar Ph.D. '77. the nation's top
intelligence analyst until last month, recently
met The Daily in his new Encina Hall office
to discuss his return to Stanford and the fail
ures and progress of U.S. intelligence under
the Bush administration.
A career civil service man. Fingar spoke
in steadfast defense of the intelligence estab
lishment. while taking pains to distance him
self from the politics of Sept. 1 l.the Iraq War
and even the emerging relationship between
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and
President Barack Obama.
Now, after serving for 25 years at the State
Department and the National Intelligence
Council (NIC'). Fingar is among a number of
high-ranking Washington officials, including

Condoleezza Rice, to retire to academic life
at Stanford.
He emphasized his desire to return to
California before becoming "too old and
decrepit" to share with students what he has
learned in a career that took him from the
directorship of Stanford's U.S.-China
Relations Program in the mid-1970s to the
State Department in 19K4, and then to the
National Intelligence Council in 2004.
Fingar said he has no intention of return
ing to government. As the current Payne
Distinguished Lecturer at the Freeman
Spogli Institute, he said he will give regular
talks, teach courses at Stanford's home and
overseas campuses and possibly oversee the
CISAC honors program.
But he said he will prioritize offering stu
dents a chance to practice foreign policy
analysis in the same fashion as his former
subordinates in Washington.
"The kinds of things the NIC or the State
Department does — (I want to teach] that
kind of a seminar or research project." he
said. "You don't need classified information
to ask. how do you understand what another
government or society is attempting to do?
How do you support policymakers? What
are the third-party countries that might have
an interest? I low do you leverage what other
people want or need to achieve U.S. objec

tives?"
During his time teaching, he will surely be
asked to reflect on the past decade, an
intense period when the peak of his career
coincided with a low point in the intelligence
agencies' reputation after the country suf
fered an elaborate terrorist attack and
launched two wars abroad — including one
justified by false intelligence reports.
Fingar, an assistant Secretary of State in
2002. was one of the main authors of the
intelligence estimate alleging that Saddam
I lussein possessed weapons of mass destruc
tion (WMD). He is proud, however, of being
a key figure in the faction of State officials
that dissented on the record — and were
ultimately overruled — during internal
debate.
"The thing was done much too quickly
with little time for review." he said. "It was
bad tradecraft. bad sourcing. a lack of infor
mation about the sourcing and a mechanical
reduction of judgments that had been
reached at different times with different
information."
Last year. Fingar publicly acknowledged
that the Iraq WMD report was the "single
worst product" he had seen in his career.
Despite recent media reports that Fingar "hit
back at Bush during his final days in
Washington. l inear told The Dailv th;ii lie

did not think there was pressure from the
White House and instead faulted Capitol
I lill for setting unrealistic time constraints.
"The administration didn't ask for it;
Congress asked for it."he said of the 100-
page report that was completed in a week.
"The decision was to meet the deadline
rather than he accused of stonewalling
Congress. It was a classic example of 'if you
want it bad. you get it had.'"
Congress lashed at his colleagues after no
evidence of active WMD programs was
found in Iraq, but Fingar suggested that leg
islators unfairly blamed intelligence agencies

when they in fact folded to political pressure
on the road to war.
"The report's impact was debatable," he
said. "With the level of classification, people
had to sign out [to see it]. Lots and lots of
members of Congress said they saw it. but
the record shows they didn't."
On Sept. 11. Fingar similarly defended the
role of intelligence agencies and acquitted
the Bush administration.
When asked if intelligence officers over
looked crucial connections in the lead-up to

the attack. Fingar replied. "There
weren't dots to connect."
"I'm offended by this 'connect
the dots' imagery," he added, "as if
you had enough monkeys, you could
figure this stuff out."
Instead, he blamed law enforce
ment — specifically, a "structural
failing" in the separation between
domestic and foreign law enforce
ment. He believes there were "good
and understandable" barriers meant
to protect civil liberties that conflict
ed with the government's ability to
protect its people.
"It took legislative change to fix
that," he said of the revisions to the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act (I ISA) authored by Bush offi
cials after 9/11.
Yet. he remains somewhat of a
hero among liberal circles. With the
end of Bush's second term, Fingar,
who had been appointed to high
ranking positions by both Presidents
Clinton and Bush, walks away from
a government career with an unsul
lied reputation outside the Beltway
as an apolitical civil servant and pro
gressive administrator.
The Guardian newspaper in 2007
hailed him as the man who "single
handedly stopped — or at least post
poned— any U.S. military strike
against Iran" by authoring the intel
ligence estimate that concluded that
Iran had stopped its covert uranium
enrichment program. Other liberal
commentators claimed he alone

halted the neo-conservative "war
party" in its tracks.
Fingar shrugs it all off.
"Even if we were going to go into
Iran, where would we have gotten
the troops?" he said, dismissing the
speculation of a strike as hysteria.
What he is genuinely proud of.
however, is a signed issue of Time
magazine he keeps at home, in which
his pet project "A-Space" — what
l ime called a "Facebook for spies"
— was listed as one of 2(X)B's best
inventions.
A-Space is indeed more than a
social networking tool for the 16 U.S.
intelligence agencies. It's a platform
for collaboration on projects from
dissecting Nigeria's troop move
ments to pulling together a presiden
tial briefing. It is the successor to
Intellipedia. a freely editable Wiki
for intelligence analysts that was
also pushed forward by Fingar in his
attempt to create A-Space.
Intellipedia. he noted with satisfac
tion, reached one million edits
among the sequestered intelligence
community in a shorter time than
the public Wikipedia had.
The demands on intelligence offi
cers have fundamentally changed
from the cloak-and-dagger Cold
War days. Fingar said the number of
"issues" has increased from several
hundred to several thousand, as
international dynamics and the rise
of non-state actors can no longer be
viewed through Cold War lenses.
Situations also unfold with increased
urgency.
"Back then, we just watched the
Soviet Bear plod around." he said.
"Now you've got [soldiers] standing
in Iraq outside a house, and they

want to know which door to go in."
So he pushed to integrate infor
mation organization and analysis,
and modernize the entire U.S. intelli
gence network, Fingar said.
"Two-thirds of the people who
worked for me joined after Sept. 11
he said. "They're your generation,
smart, tech-savvy, multi-tasking. You
can't do 21st-century stuff using
standards and procedures from a
slow-moving time. We're doing bet
ter in each agency, and better is
going from quite good, in some
instances, to very good."
The body of intelligence analysts
Fingar left to the Obama administra
tion will be tested by a world no less
simple. The "ark of instability" from
Pakistan to the Levant will be the
most challenging. Fingar said.
Fingar is certainly more dovish
than the dominant policymakers of
the Bush era. He suggested collabo
ration with non-friendly states on
initiatives such as combating climate
change and providing stable sources
of energy. He visibly disliked even
the phrase of "pressuring Iran." and
said he found Obama's campaign
rhetoric on Iran "very encouraging."
An objective policy opinion or
not, it was the closest Fingar came to
revealing political favor in an hour
long conversation.
When asked a final time to give
his critical assessment of foreign pol
icy successes and failures over the
past eight years, Fingar declined
mildly.
"I don't have the kiss-and-tell
kind of habit," he said.

"The thing was done much too quickly

bad tradecraft. bad sourcing. a lack of infor

reduction of judgments that had been
reached at different times with different
information."

"The administration didn't ask for it;

"The decision was to meet the deadline
rather than he accused of stonewalling
Congress. It was a classic example of 'if you
want it bad. you get it had.'"
Congress lashed at his colleagues after no
evidence of active WMD programs was
found in Iraq, but Fingar suggested that leg

when they in fact folded to political pressure
on the road to war.
"The report's impact was debatable," he
said. "With the level of classification, people
had to sign out [to see it]. Lots and lots of
members of Congress said they saw it. but

role of intelligence agencies and acquitted

the attack. Fingar replied. "There
weren't dots to connect."
"I'm offended by this 'connect
the dots' imagery," he added, "as if
you had enough monkeys, you could
figure this stuff out."
Instead, he blamed law enforce
ment — specifically, a "structural
failing" in the separation between
domestic and foreign law enforce
ment. He believes there were "good
and understandable" barriers meant
to protect civil liberties that conflict
ed with the government's ability to
protect its people.
"It took legislative change to fix
that," he said of the revisions to the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act (I ISA) authored by Bush offi
cials after 9/11.
Yet. he remains somewhat of a
hero among liberal circles. With the
end of Bush's second term, Fingar,
who had been appointed to high
ranking positions by both Presidents
Clinton and Bush, walks away from
a government career with an unsul
lied reputation outside the Beltway
as an apolitical civil servant and pro
gressive administrator.
The Guardian newspaper in 2007
hailed him as the man who "single
handedly stopped — or at least post
poned— any U.S. military strike
against Iran" by authoring the intel
ligence estimate that concluded that
Iran had stopped its covert uranium
enrichment program. Other liberal
commentators claimed he alone

halted the neo-conservative "war
party" in its tracks.
Fingar shrugs it all off.
"Even if we were going to go into
Iran, where would we have gotten
the troops?" he said, dismissing the
speculation of a strike as hysteria.
What he is genuinely proud of.
however, is a signed issue of Time
magazine he keeps at home, in which
his pet project "A-Space" — what
l ime called a "Facebook for spies"
— was listed as one of 2(X)B's best
inventions.
A-Space is indeed more than a
social networking tool for the 16 U.S.
intelligence agencies. It's a platform
for collaboration on projects from
dissecting Nigeria's troop move
ments to pulling together a presiden
tial briefing. It is the successor to
Intellipedia. a freely editable Wiki
for intelligence analysts that was
also pushed forward by Fingar in his
attempt to create A-Space.
Intellipedia. he noted with satisfac
tion, reached one million edits
among the sequestered intelligence
community in a shorter time than
the public Wikipedia had.
The demands on intelligence offi
cers have fundamentally changed
from the cloak-and-dagger Cold
War days. Fingar said the number of
"issues" has increased from several
hundred to several thousand, as
international dynamics and the rise
of non-state actors can no longer be
viewed through Cold War lenses.
Situations also unfold with increased
urgency.
"Back then, we just watched the
Soviet Bear plod around." he said.
"Now you've got [soldiers] standing
in Iraq outside a house, and they

want to know which door to go in."
So he pushed to integrate infor
mation organization and analysis,
and modernize the entire U.S. intelli
gence network, Fingar said.
"Two-thirds of the people who
worked for me joined after Sept. 11
he said. "They're your generation,
smart, tech-savvy, multi-tasking. You
can't do 21st-century stuff using
standards and procedures from a
slow-moving time. We're doing bet
ter in each agency, and better is
going from quite good, in some
instances, to very good."
The body of intelligence analysts
Fingar left to the Obama administra
tion will be tested by a world no less
simple. The "ark of instability" from
Pakistan to the Levant will be the
most challenging. Fingar said.
Fingar is certainly more dovish
than the dominant policymakers of
the Bush era. He suggested collabo
ration with non-friendly states on
initiatives such as combating climate
change and providing stable sources
of energy. He visibly disliked even
the phrase of "pressuring Iran." and
said he found Obama's campaign
rhetoric on Iran "very encouraging."
An objective policy opinion or
not, it was the closest Fingar came to
revealing political favor in an hour
long conversation.
When asked a final time to give
his critical assessment of foreign pol
icy successes and failures over the
past eight years, Fingar declined
mildly.
"I don't have the kiss-and-tell
kind of habit," he said.

A signed portrait of an old friend and
boss, former Secretary of State Colin Powell,
looks down at his desk. Black-and-white
snapshots with men in 1970s Mao jackets
line another window. A few eulogizing
plaques from intelligence units here, more
photos over there — it is enough memorabil
ia to suggest two lifetimes' worth of work bv
this man who once scrutinized the most crit
ical intrigues of the contemporary globe.
Plodding, precise and unassuming, Dr.
Thomas Fin gar Ph.D. '77. the nation's top
intelligence analyst until last month, recently
met The Daily in his new Encina Hall office
to discuss his return to Stanford and the fail
ures and progress of U.S. intelligence under
the Bush administration.
A career civil service man. Fingar spoke
in steadfast defense of the intelligence estab
lishment. while taking pains to distance him
self from the politics of Sept. 1 l.the Iraq War
and even the emerging relationship between
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and
President Barack Obama.
Now, after serving for 25 years at the State
Department and the National Intelligence
Council (NIC'). Fingar is among a number of
high-ranking Washington officials, including

Condoleezza Rice, to retire to academic life
at Stanford.
He emphasized his desire to return to
California before becoming "too old and
decrepit" to share with students what he has
learned in a career that took him from the
directorship of Stanford's U.S.-China
Relations Program in the mid-1970s to the
State Department in 19K4, and then to the
National Intelligence Council in 2004.
Fingar said he has no intention of return
ing to government. As the current Payne
Distinguished Lecturer at the Freeman
Spogli Institute, he said he will give regular
talks, teach courses at Stanford's home and
overseas campuses and possibly oversee the
CISAC honors program.
But he said he will prioritize offering stu
dents a chance to practice foreign policy
analysis in the same fashion as his former
subordinates in Washington.
"The kinds of things the NIC or the State
Department does — (I want to teach] that
kind of a seminar or research project." he
said. "You don't need classified information
to ask. how do you understand what another
government or society is attempting to do?
How do you support policymakers? What
are the third-party countries that might have
an interest? I low do you leverage what other
people want or need to achieve U.S. objec

tives?"
During his time teaching, he will surely be
asked to reflect on the past decade, an
intense period when the peak of his career
coincided with a low point in the intelligence
agencies' reputation after the country suf
fered an elaborate terrorist attack and
launched two wars abroad — including one
justified by false intelligence reports.
Fingar, an assistant Secretary of State in
2002. was one of the main authors of the
intelligence estimate alleging that Saddam
I lussein possessed weapons of mass destruc
tion (WMD). He is proud, however, of being
a key figure in the faction of State officials
that dissented on the record — and were
ultimately overruled — during internal
debate.
"The thing was done much too quickly
with little time for review." he said. "It was
bad tradecraft. bad sourcing. a lack of infor
mation about the sourcing and a mechanical
reduction of judgments that had been
reached at different times with different
