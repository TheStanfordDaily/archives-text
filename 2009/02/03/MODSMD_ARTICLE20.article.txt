# Gymnasts stay perfect
## Cardinal edges Arizona to go 8-0 
### KENAN JIANG STAFF WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford women's gymnastics team scraped
by Arizona Inst Friday at McKale Center and extended
its record to 8-0 on the season. Never before has the Car
dinal won eight straight decisions to start a season.
Still, the women made some uncharacteristic mistakes
and almost lost their perfect record to the N0.24 Arizona
Wildcats. Stanford eventually came from behind to edge
Arizona 195.575 to 195.175 after losing points and falling
behind on the first rotation.
The Cardinal also failed to perform up to its own stan
dards on the balance beam, which is the team's best event
this year. Arizona remains 0-4 overall despite beating the
Cardinal in two events.
Junior Carly Janiga stepped up for Stanford after the
early mistakes and scored a 9.9 on the vault and uneven
bars, while capturing the all-around with 39.45 points.
Janiga's performance was a tremendous boost for the
Card, as the junior— ranked fifth collegiately in all
around — won the vault, bars and floor, while scoring
season bests or tying her season highs for all the events.
Sophomore Shelley Alexander also contested the all
around and ended with a score of 38.475. with her highest
total coming from the vault at 9.875.
"It was clearly not our best performance," Janiga said.
"We made some uncharacteristic mistakes on beam and
bars, but we also made some great upgrades on floor
which boasts our difficulty level. It may have been good
that we had some mistakes because we are that much
more fired up for the meet against IJCI.A on Sunday."
"Our performance in Tucson did not reflect the great
work we've been doing in the gym over the past few
weeks." said senior Kelly Fee. "We made some uncharac
teristic mistakes that none of us are worried about. Per
sonally. I had a few of those uncharacteristic mistakes, but
all in all. I was satisfied with my performance and look
forward to defeating the Bruins next Sunday."
The Arizona gymnasts came out with a strong punch,
as all scored 9.9 on the vault to top the Cardinal. But
freshman Alyssa Brown scored a 9.875 and junior Blair
Ryland had a 9.825. both season bests: and along with
Janiga's 9.9 and senior Nicole Ourada's 9.875. Stanford
set a team-high score of 49.35 on vault to Arizona's 49.2.
On the uneven bars. Stanford beat out Arizona 48.825
to 48.025. with Janiga leading on a 9.9, followed by Fee
with a 9.775. Freshman Nicole Pechanec scored 9.75.
Brown scored 9.75 and sophomore Shelley Alexander
finished at 9.65.
Arizona edged out Stanford on the balance beam
48.725 to 48.45 with Arizona's Briana Bergeson scoring a
9.9 followed by Stanford's Ourada at 9.875, Fee at 9.8,
Janiga at 9.775. senior I leather Purnell at 9.75 and junior
Allyse Ishino at 9.25.
The Wildcats also beat Stanford in the floor exercise.
49.225 to 48.95.
The Cardinal resumes action against No. 3 UCI A at

Burn ham Pavilion on Sunday, Feb. K at 2 p.m.
"UCLA is probably our team's equivalent to Stan
ford's rivalry with Cal." Janiga said. "It's always been
back and forth between us and UCLA for the Pac-1()
title. UCLA has some killer freshmen this year, so 1 be
lieve that we are really going to be well matched this
weekend. It will definitely be a head-to-head finish."
