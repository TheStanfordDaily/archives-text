# Late Night dining rumors discounted
## Stanford denies unused points will prompt Dining layoffs 
### KATE ABBOTT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford Dining discounted rumors earlier
this week that wasted Cardinal dollars would
lead to layoffs ot Dining employees. Emails
began circulating to several dorm chat lists at the
beginning of winter quarter warning against
unused dollars.
"Please make an effort to come to Late Night
more often because there were over 25().(K)()
unused Cardinal Points campus-wide last quar
ter, and the staff is afraid that there will be layoffs
sooner or later," one email stated. "If the demand
for Late Night diminishes, the need for employ
ees will as well and Late Night will suffer."
The chain of emails did not cite where this
information was gathered.

Eric Monteil. executive director of Stanford
Dining, said in an email to' Hie Daily that these
emails are. in fact, just rumors.
"It is unfortunate that this email was sent
around to students as it creates unnecessary
fear." Monteil said. "The entire campus continues
to have significant financial challenges as recent
ly reported by the Provost. R&DL (Residential
and Dining Enterprises] and Stanford Dining
have been working thoroughly and diligently to
reduce costs to the University and to students."
The majority of the emails sent in this chain
were from anonymous senders, and receivers of
the emails said they were unaware of the rumor's
origin.
"It appears that if we don't use up our
Cardinal dollars (meal plan "points"), there may
be layoffs ... the points are pre-paid anyway, so
you can't gain anything from having tons of
points leftover at the end of the quarter," anoth
er email read.
Monteil said that Dining, along with other
university departments, is cutting back as a result
of the current economic situation, but this is in no

way linked to the use of Cardinal dollars.
"We are doing everything we can to minimize
the impact on our staff while we reduce costs." he
said. "However, we share the same financial bur
den as the rest of the campus and there will need
to be a reduction in current staff levels."
According to Monteil. these changes include a
reduction of Dining staff in the central office as
well as "in other areas that do not directly impact
student services." He added that a committee of
dining managers and frontline employees, which
will meet biweekly, will explore means of cost
reduction and improvement of customer service.
"These are not easy and are painful decisions
as we have very talented staff members who are
committed to excellence, to the students they
serve and to this university." he s;iid. "We have
asked many of our staff (including me) to take on
additional areas of work and responsibility as we
look for efficiencies to reduce cost to the
University. We will continue to do so."
