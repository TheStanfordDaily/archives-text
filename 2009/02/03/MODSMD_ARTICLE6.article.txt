among the many students confused
hv this turn of events. Having intend
ed to take "Sleep and Dreams" to
meet his natural science requirement.
Milonopoulos w;is surprised to find
discrepancies between the informa
tion provided by Axcss. the online
Bulletin and the Registrar itself.
While the Bulletin and winter time
schedule have always indicated that
"Sleep and Dreams" fulfills the natu
ral science requirement. Axess did
not make this fact clear until after the
add deadline.
Milonopoulos decided against
enrolling in the course after a repre
sentative of the Registrar emailed
him and mistakenly indicated that the
course presently does not satisfy any
GI R requirements.
"Il l had known that it fulfilled the
natural science requirement, I proba
bly would have taken the course,"
Milonopoulos said. "This is a class
that is very amenable to non-scien
tists, and that's who you mainly see
taking the course."
Prof. Dement, who has taught
"Sleep and Dreams" for 33 years, told
I he Daily that this is not the first time
he has encountered problems with
the University. In the past, he has
experienced a variety of difficulties as

the course switched from department
to department. "Sleep and Dreams"
was originally offered by the
Department of Psychology, then
Human Biology and is now under
Psychiatry.
Dement noted that some faculty
members at Stanford do not believe
that PSYC 135 offers enough rigor
ous content to fill the natural science
(il R.This perceived lack of rigor was
a reason why Human Biology
stopped offering the course in the
past, he said.
Acknowledging 'hat "Sleep and
Dreams" might not be as difficult as
other science courses at Stanford,
Dement said it should nonetheless
satisfy the natural science CJER.
"I wanted it to be easy, entertain
ing. so a lot of students would take it."
Dement said. "The reason for that is
because you don't get it anywhere
else."
But he was quick to add. "What
the brain does, how it functions, the
neurological controls — that is. in my
opinion, natural science."
"It might not be at an advanced
level, but we're starting at the very
beginning," Dement said. "It's just as
if people can't seem to grasp that."
For Xandra Clark '12. the GER
requirement was of lesser impor
tance compared to the value of the
class material.
Clark stressed that she would
have taken the course whether or
not it fulfilled any GF.Rs. Having
attended Dement's lecture during
last year's Admit Weekend. "It was
one of the main reasons why I
attended Stanford " Clark said.
But students who need to finish
university requirements in order to
graduate have a different perspec
tive.
"I'm really enjoying the class
right now," said Sean Tannehill 12.
"But the fact that it fulfills the nat
ural science requirement really
helps me out academically."
