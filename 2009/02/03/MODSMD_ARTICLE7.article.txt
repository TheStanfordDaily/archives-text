## Prof. to tackle Bulimia Largest-ever study of disorder in the works 
### BY CASSANDRA FELICIANO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford announced the begin
ning of its recruitment process last
month for the largest study of ado
lescents with Bulimia nervosa, to he
conducted collaboratively with the
University of Chicago. The study is
geared primarily toward determin
ing which of the treatments devel
oped for bulimic adults are appro
priate for a younger age group.
Dr. Jim Lock, the senior investi
gator at Stanford, and his Chicago
counterpart, Daniel LeOrange.
received a $2 million grant from the
National Institute of Mental Health
to implement a five-year study on
150 participants of either gender
between the ages of 12 and IS.
Eligible patients will undergo 20
sessions over a period of six months
with one of the team's four thera
pists. and a year of follow-up ses
sions. Each patient will be subjected
to one of three therapeutic treat
ments.
The first entails both the patient
and his or her family spending time
with one of the team's four thera
pists in an effort to change attitudes
toward eating. TTie individual thera
p\ approach examines the mecha
nisms that adolescents use to cope
with stressors and involves
exploratory exercises that try to
explain why certain eating habits
have been adopted.
Cognitive behavioral therapy is
aimed at altering the participant's
thoughts and behavior toward eat
ing and body image by requiring
participants to keep records of dailv
eating patterns, along with a diar\
"Our hypothesis is that, based on
the available literature to date, cor
nitive behavioral therapy will be
the most effective," Lock said. "Hut
whether or not that's true is really
unknown. On average, that's the
treatment that looks the best in
adults, and therefore it's the pre
sumed best treatment."
Analysis of results will he based
on a structured interview devel
oped 20 years ago called "eating
disorder examination," the stan
dard of measure in studies dealinn

with Bulimia nervosa.
Recruiting for the study is esti
mated to last up to two years. Lock
attributed the long process to the
difficulty in finding an adolescent
suffering specifically from Bulimia
nervosa alone.
"A lot of times, adolescents who
are bulimic are quite secretive, and
people don't know about it," Lock
said, "so they can be harder to iden
tify."
He is hoping to draw a sample of
participants from admitted bulimic
patients at Lucile Packard
Children's Hospital.
Advertisements and information
sessions in various schools are also

part of the recruitment plans.
"We really desperately need to
recruit effectively." he said."! think
that's our main challenge."
While two other studies on this
topic have been previously pub
lished, Lock claims that the results
from those were inconclusive, and
the samples were far too small to
make accurate generalizations — a
primary motivation for conducting
a third study on bulimic adoles
cents.
"Right now. the clinicians in the
community don't know what they'd
be offering adolescents with
Bulimia nervosa — they're just
more or less guessing." he said. "We
would like to be able to offer them
information about the kinds that
are the most effective, and maybe
for which [age group) therapies are
most effective."
Most of the studies on Bulimia
nervosa have focused on treatment
for the older population. This can
be attributed to the convenience
and accessibility that comes with
recruiting adult patients. Lock
claims. Adults have proven easier to
recruit because they can decide for
themselves and do not need any
forms of parental consent.
Still, he pointed out that the
treatment used for adults may not
always be as effective when direct
ed toward patients in a younger age
group.
"You're really looking at a very
different group of people with dif
ferent abilities to use therapy, dif
ferent levels of autonomy and dif
ferent levels of symptom severity."
he said. "Adult researchers don't
always value the need to intervene
early as much as those who work
with adolescents do."
