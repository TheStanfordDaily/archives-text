## Howz it goin across the rm? 
### KATE ABBOTT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It is S o'clock on a fairly average Sunday night. The com
mon room is quiet: two roommates are diligently work
ing away on problem sets and Korean homework. On
one side of the room, the silence is broken by the famil
iar ping of iChat: GoLuckEs just received a message.
Missundrstdl: hey. how's ur paper?
Missundrstdl: I miss the sound of ur voice!
Missundrstdl also happens to be GoLuckEs's roommate.
And here they are. instant messaging each other while sitting
face-to-face.
Messaging back and forth is becoming part of a nightly
routine between many roommate pairs, and the trend seems
to be growing among underclassmen on campus.The expanse
of technology allows for college students to not only slay con
nected with friends and family back home, but also maintain
a level of humor within their own dorm rooms.
Stephanie Tomasetta '12 lives in a Roble quad. She said
that her roommates tease each other over the Internet when
things seem to be getting too serious in their room.
"We only instant message (IM) as a joke once or twice a
week when we are sitting in the same room." she said.
"Sometimes it's to say something that can't be said aloud
because other people are in the room, or it's about something
that happened."
"[My roommate and I] have chatted a couple times to dis
cuss how we're feeling about certain things, but usually it's
when someone else is in the room." added Rachel Lee *11.
"We don't use it when we're by ourselves."
Alternate forms of communication, including iChat.
Gchat.Skvpe and Facebook.are becoming more pervasive on
campus. New roommates no longer draw the line at becoming
Facebook friends and posting Photobooth pictures from their
Macbooks. Now. it's all about utilizing social networking sites'
chat features while only five feet away from each other.
"I think roomie IM-ing is funny,"Tomasetta said."We say
ridiculous things to each other. It is like leaving post-its or silly
notes. I mean, who doesn't enjoy receiving loving messages?"
Tomasetta speculated that the trend seems to be larger
among female roommates, mostly because of the "silly"
nature of this habit.
"I used to IM my roommate in high school a lot." said

According to an article bv the Chinese
University of Hong Kong, titled "Shyness,
Alienation, and Academic Performance
Decrements." teenagers who "had longer
years of IM use" ended up "more alienated
from their peers, school and family" and
were also "more shy."
Whether or not this is true of the I Ming
trend within college dorms is difficult to
determine. Tomasetta's roommate. Disney
Williams '12. maintained that methods of
silent communication are not to be taken
seriously.
"Sometimes it gets so quiet in here, we
don't want to disturb the peace of the work
ing environment." Williams said. "But real

to look away from our computers."
