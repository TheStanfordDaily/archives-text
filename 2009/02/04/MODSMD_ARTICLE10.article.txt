## Obama: "I screwed up"

Barack ()bama on Tuesday abrupt
ly abandoned his nomination light for
Tom Daschle and a second major ap
pointee who failed to pay all their
taxes, fearing a lingering ethics dispute
would undercut his claims to moral
high ground and cripple his presiden
cy in just its second week. "I screwed
up," Obama declared.

"It's important for this administra
tion to send a message that there
aren't two sets of rules — you know,
one for prominent people and one for
ordinary folks who have to pay their
taxes," Obama said near the end of a
day of jarring developments, little
more than 24 hours after he had said
he was "absolutely" committed to
Daschle's confirmation.
"I'm frustrated with myself, with
our team.... I'm here on television say
ing I screwed up." Obama said on
NF3("s "Nightly News with Brian
Williams." He repeated virtually the
same words in interviews with other
TV anchors.
Hours earlier, the White House
had announced that Daschle had
asked to be removed from considera
tion as health and human services sec
retary and that Nancy Killefcr had
made the same request concerning
what was to be her groundbreaking
appointment as a chief performance
officer to make the entire government

run better.
Daschle said in a brief letter to
Obama that he refused to "be a dis
traction" from the new president's
drive for health care reform. Obama
said neither he nor Daschle excused
the former Senate Democratic
leader's tax errors but that he accept -
ed his friend's decision "with sadness
and regret."
Unsightly personal tax problems
had been piling up for the new admin
istration. Last week, the Senate eon
firmed Timothy Geithner as treasury
secretary, but only after days of con
troversy over the fact that the man
who would oversee the Internal Rev
enue Service had only belatedly paid
$34.(XM) in income taxes.
Bill Richardson bowed out. too.
though his difficulties didn't involve
personal taxes. Hie New Mexico gov
ernor. who was Obama's first choice
for commerce secretary, withdrew
amid a grand jury investigation into a
state contract awarded to his political

donors.
Questions about Daschle's failure
to fully pay his taxes from 2005
through 2007 had been increasing
since they came to light last Friday.
Daschle overlooked taxes on income
for consulting work and personal use
of a car and driver, and also deducted
more in charitable contributions than
he should have. To resolve it.he paid
$128,203 in back taxes and $11.%4 in
interest last month.
Killefer, an executive with
consulting giant Mckinse\ cV Co.. had
been chosen by ()bama to serve in two
roles: as the first chief performance of
ficer in a White 1 louse and as a deputy
director at the ()ftice of Management
and Budget.
When Obama announced Killefer
to much fanfare in early January Hie
Associated Press reported that the
District of Columbia government had
filed a $y46.6 1 ) tax lien tin her home in
200s for failure to pay unemployment
compensation tax on household help.
She resolved the tax error five months
after the lien was filed. Since then, ad
ministration officials had refused to
say whether her tax problems extend
ed beyond that one issue.
Bv Tuesday, the tax questions had
reached critical mass.
" ITiis is a sell induced injury that
I'm angrv about, and we're going to
make sure we get it fixed." Obama
said on AB( "s "World News."
Democratic lawmakers were sur
prised, too - and disappointed. Axel
rod rushed to Capitol Mill to soothe
frayed nerves.
"I was a little stunned. I thought he
was going to get confirmed." said Sen.
Max Baucus. I) Mont., chairman of
the Senate 1 inance Committee, the
panel that would have voted on
Daschle's nomination. "It's regret
table."
