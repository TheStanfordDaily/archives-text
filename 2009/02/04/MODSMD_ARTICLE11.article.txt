## Editorial Stanford, Musharraf and the value of discourse 
### 
This editorial originally ran on Jan. 20.
This past Friday at Memorial Auditori
um. the ASSU Speaker's Bureau and
Stanford in Government — in con
junction with a host of other campus organi
zations — presented Pervez Musharraf, the
former Pakistani head ofstate. for their annu
al "Big Speaker" series. Following his contest
ed rise to presidency in 2001. Musharraf
played a central role in global counter-terror
ism efforts and Indian-Pakistani relations, at
the same time drawing controversy in inter
national politics.
Alter delivering a nearly 55-minute
speech that highlighted the importance of
combating terrorism, resolving political strife
in the Middle Hast and South Asia and other
issues. Musharraf faced a
swer session with the Stanford community.
No sooner had the microphones been turned
on did the cat-calls start living. Enraged Indi
an nationalists and other emotionally
charged students questioned everything from
the legitimacy of Musharrafs rule to the in
herent corruption of the Pakistani govern
ment. The end result was ultimately a back
and-forth between strong-willed, would-be
inquisitors and an equally defiant, finger
wagging Musharraf.
This event is but the most recent manifes
tation of the problem with enlightened and
civil discourse on campus. As one of the lead
ing educational institutions worldwide, Stan
ford is a repository for diverse opinions, ide
ologies and global outlooks. Oftentimes, as
evidenced by the Musharraf question-and
answer session, these beliefs conflict in less
than-subtle ways.
As far removed as the Farm seems from
events in the real world, too often do issues of
national and global import trickle down into
fiery dorm list exchanges.The recent strife in
Gaza has highlighted the uneasy relationship
between Israeli- and Palestinian leaning stu
dent organizations on campus.The 200N elec
tion cycle deeply shook the psyche of student
life, from the accusations of viciousness in the

Democratic primaries to the outrage over the
passage of Prop. 8. Many hold particularly
strong beliefs on these issues, yet the climate
has not always been conducive to certain
parts of the population effectively articulat
ing positions not shared by a majority of the
student body.
The editorial board in no way advocates
the curtailing of dissent or an environment
that values diluted, politically correct tripe as
a means to address complex issues. Rather, in
coordination with the educational mission of
this university, we endorse a campus culture
that provides for the free and civil exchange
of varied beliefs in a non-threatening setting
that encourages intellectual stimulation and
growth.Too often do we find tumultuous sub
jects reduced to shouting matches, in which
each side tries to drown out the other in a sea
of impassioned remarks. This does little to
perpetuate an atmosphere in which disagree
ment is celebrated.
The University is often held up as a central
place where personal beliefs are challenged
and redefined, w here exposure to diverse ways
of thinking expands one's perspective. It is thus
ironic that many students interested in civil
discussion may shy away from thorny topics
for fear of instigating conflict in the dining hall,
on the chat list or in emails to The Daily. Shout
ing matches, electronic or otherwise, not only
contribute little to debate but also create an in
tellectually stifling atmosphere for those hop
ing to foster authentic debate.
Musharraf is no doubt an immensely con
troversial figure, and his presence should
have rightfully sparked an intense and
thoughtful discussion on the state of South-
Asian geo-politics and the current state of
counter-terrorism. Just as the Gaza conflict
and the presidential election have brought
opposite ideologies to a head, we should not
balk at the prospect of lively debate. If we
prize our reputation as a world-class institu
tion, it is incumbent upon us a student body to
argue for our beliefs, but in a way that is more
in line with the values of Stanford and less
comparable to cable television news stations.
