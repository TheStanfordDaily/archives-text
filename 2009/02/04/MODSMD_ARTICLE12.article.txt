# This Stanford Life
## The 						cult of investment banking 
### 
Hits column originally ran on Nov. 1.12(H)H.
1 first came across the plaque this past sum
mer. Returning from Jackson I.ihrarv at
the (iraduate School ol Business, I noticed
a black marble square that read. "Corporate
and Foundation Investors. The Stanford
Graduate School of Business gratefully ac
knowledges the following donors for their
generous support of the school." It then pro
ceeded to list big-time corporations and the
investment banking stalwarts: Goldman
Sachs. Merrill Lynch and the like.
But by late September, the plaque was
gone. In its place was a large rectangle of
butcher paper and. underneath the paper, a
bare stone wall. Until recently, the butcher
paper remained taped to the wall. In the last
few weeks, the C iSB replaced it with an updat
ed. "2007-200 X" sponsors plaque, which
lacked any of the big Wall Street names.
September's financial crisis didn't just un
expectedly alter on-campus recruitment cy
cles and tighten the job market — the crisis al
tered the landscape of American elite univer
sities. Fhe implosion humbled or outright de
stroyed institutions that Stanford students
have long worshiped with reverence.
The September crisis just may have ended
the cult of investment banking as we know it -
and possibly for the better.
The collapse's short-term effects have
been amply documented by college newspa
pers. including Hie Daily. Hiring is down,
l irms are more conservative about recruiting.
The Cornell Sun — serving a student body
close to Stanford in the peeking order of elite
recruiting —had some interesting statistics.
According to Cornell Finance Professor
Charles Chang, the big Wall Street firms re
cently hired back about SO percent of interns,
rh is year t hey could on ly hi re 4() percent of in -
terns. New offers are down bv about half. W;ill
Street has been hemorrhaging jobs for a while
and the Financial Times estimates that it will
shed dozens of thousands of more jobs.
But 2(K )S hasn't just led to a crisis in campus
recruiting; it has also shaken supreme confi
dence with rampant uncertainty. Firms like
Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers. Merrill
Lynch and Morgan Stanley have long held
special places in the imagination of the Stan
ford student. By recruiting the best of the best
at elite schools, the firms set themselves up as
the natural successor to prestigious schools
like Stanford and the Ivies: they positioned
themselves as the "real world"' Ivies, so to
speak.
Wall Street firms were a student's direct
ticket to privilege and status. Investment
banks have represented intense work and
time commitments, but alsocnoimous payoff.

Income two or three times larger than other
entry-level jobs, a nice apartment and high
status social life (a lifestyle of "models and
bottles" as some phrase it) all before the age of
25 were rewards for years of sacrifice that first
began 111 high school, consumed most of col
lege and then dominated the waning years of
youth.
And it's no wonder elite students have
been so attracted to finance and investment
banks in particular. For over a decade, the
world has been the Stanford senior's oyster.
Seniors have faced one of the best job markets
in American history.The financial industry, in
particular, has flourished. In 2(M )7 alone,about
30 percent of S& I' 500 profits were earned by
financial firms, according to Farced Zakaria of
Newsweek.The number of jobs on Wall Street
has grown regularly in the past years — two
percent in 2007 and three percent in 2006.
Moreover, starting investment-banking
salaries vary, but they have been known to run
upwards of $100,000 with bonus. And. com
pensation grew substantially with experience.
TTiis career ambition is nothing particular
ly new. All the way back to the days of William
Whyte's"The Organization Man'in 1957,the
elite American university has been a breeding
ground for corporate and financial cmploy
ment:"Thc descent,every spring.of the corpo
rations' recruiters has now become a built-in
feature of campus life." Then, by the time
David Brooks wrote his 2001 profile of elite
college students entitled "The Organization
Kid." investment banks had become the
prime attractions for career-obsessed colle
gians with glossy posters placed all over elite
campuses.
Whether ambitious students can still be
come "Master of the Universe" — as Tom
Wolfe famously labeled i bankers —at the
age of 22 is now totally unclear.The only thing
that looks likely is that they won't be able to
do so along the same path as before.
The question, then, is what will fill the void
left by investment banks in the imagination of
Stanford students. In all likelihood, students
will follow the money to its new locale. Tom
Wolfe, surveying the wreckage of his Wall
Street "masters," wrote that the true elite have
alreadv begun moving away from Wall Street

investment banks to Connecticut
hedge funds.
Hopefully the decline of the cult
of investment banking w ill force tal
ented students to look at other,
more productive fields and opportu

nities. Many students joined invest
ment banking firms simply because
others were doing it and they want
ed to make money. Now that the
openings are scarce, hopefully some
students will rethink their career
plans.
Indeed, if anything good is to come
of the demise of investment banks and
its dwindling opportunities, it will be
an end to Stanford's brain drain. Stan
ford's talented will hopefully be di

rected into fields with more tangible
missions or public service opportuni
ties. According to the CDC. atten
dance for sessions on the Peace Corps
and Teach for America is already up
this year.
In the meantime.the new plaque is
up at the School of Business. 1 doubt,
however, that I'll ever see the original
again.
