## Why I am irrationally scared of mountain lions 
### 
This column originally ran on Nov. 12,2008.
Hidden within the Bay Area's lush,
rolling hills waits a terror â€” a silent,
ominous terror that threatens to tear us
apart. And no, I am not talking about some
thing abstract and divisive, like tax policy or
carbon credits.
The terror 1 speak of is the mountain lion,
an animal that, if given the chance, would liter
ally tear you apart.
Pretty much, if you take all that is wrong
and evil in the world and mash it together
into the fourth-largest cat on the planet,
you'd have the mountain lion: a snarling,
ruthless beast born with an unquenchable
thirst for blood and no understanding of the
word mercy.
"Hut Kevin," 1 can see some of you al
ready protesting in lengthy emails, "moun
tain lions are misunderstood, beautiful ani
mals hlah blah land encroachment blah blah
blah do you ever do research? blah blah."
You make some valid points. Reader, but
will your unrepentantly liberal cougar sym
pathizing save you from being eaten alive?
Doubtful.
"But Kevin," 1 see some of you writing in
a second, angrier email, "in the past 10 years,
there have only been five recorded deaths by
mountain lions, and, like, 500 deaths from
vending machine-related accidents."
First of all, check your facts. There's ab
solutely no evidence to suggest that that many
vending machines kill people annually
(though, in your defense, 1 doubt my family
would report my true cause of death if I died
trying to steal a candy bar. so the vending ma
chine death toll could well be underreported).
Other than that, your logic's fine - you're
probably more likely to die in an earthquake
here than get mauled. What you haven't
taken into account, though, is a particularly
vivid story designed to distort your logical

perception of risk. Consider the following:
Jimmy was a normal, mildly left-leaning
kid. much like yourself. One day.he went for
a bike ride. "What a great day!" he said,
"nothing could possibly go wrong!"
Just then a mountain lion pounced from
out of nowhere and ate his face.
As you can see from my realistic, well
written narrative, mountain lions are much
more terrifying than vending machines.
Why? Because vending machines cannot
stalk you or jump 20 feet from a standstill.
At least, not yet. (Looking at you here."sci
ence.")
I think about this all the time when I walk
alone at night. Somehow, I have convinced
myself that if I am prepared for a mountain
lion attack. I will be able to fend it off. I take
stock of every possible defense item 1 can
think of - my bike: Could it be a shield? The
helmet I had for Halloween: Though worn
ironically, would it protect my skull from
being crushed?
And it's never long before I start day
dreaming about how if such a cat attacked
me. I would light back and. inevitably, kill it
with my bare hands and sheer manliness.
Later, in bar-type settings, women would ask
me cautiously about the scars lining my face,
and I would reluctantly recount my epic bat
tle with nature. Impressed by my ruggedness.
they would then offer to bear all my children
forever.

Now. clearly. I would much rather not
have a scar on my face, not be attacked by a
mountain lion and not reproduce with
women who find near-death injury arousing.
But it doesn't hurt to be prepared.
I think what scares me so much about
pumas is that they intimidate me. I don't
hunt, but it would be nice to know that if 1
had to. 1 could kill squirrels, deer and Stan
ford's alarmingly aggressive raccoons as well
as any lion. But mountain lions can stalk their
prey for days without food: I. meanwhile,can
barely complete my own sentences. How can
1 possibly compete?
It is with this in mind that I propose we
erect a gigantic wall around Stanford to keep
us physically safe from attack and to preserve
our ability to hunt game on campus, not that
we would ever want to. It would be 20 feet tall
and 30 feet wide. and. like the Great Wall, it
would be visible from space. I don't know if it
would keep out Mongols, but it would cer
tainly make it hard for cars to get in - a small
price to pay for securing our border.
But how, you might ask.can our great uni
versity afford to build such a wall when we
can barely afford to keep the school itself
running?
Simple: we will create a Coalition of the
Willing. We will work tirelessly,and probably
illegally, to construct the wall ourselves. What
better way to tell mountain lions "screw you
and the populations you keep in check" than
to keep them out forever?
Ultimately, 1 suppose mountain lions are
scary because of how they're different from
us; they walk differently, they talk differently
and they stalk differently. But mavbe. some
day. we can learn to live harmoniously to
gether.
Until that day comes, though. I've got a
wall to build.
