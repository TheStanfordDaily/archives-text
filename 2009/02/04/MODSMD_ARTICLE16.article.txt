## NAIL-BITERS Card takes two close matches at home 
### JEFF LU STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's volleyball team is off
to an auspicious start to the week following
its spectacular, hard-fought weekend sweep
over challengers Long Beach State and UC-
San Diego. The No. 6 Cardinal is looking to
extend that winning streak as it prepares to
visit UCLA and UC-Irvine next Thursday
and Friday.
Stanford (7-3. 3-2 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) rallied from behind to narrowly
win its first home match on Friday against No. 7
Long Beach State. 26-30.24-30,33-3 1,31 -29,15-
8. Staving off two match points, the Cardinal
rode the momentum of a monstrous perform
ance by freshman outside hitter Brad Lawson.
whose 27 kills and .438 hitting percentage car
ried Stanford to its nail-biting win.
On Saturday, the Cardinal took on No. 15
UC-San Diego, marking its second triumph of
the weekend with a 30-25, 30-23, 28-30, 30-28
victory over the Tritons. Junior setter Kawika
Shoji contributed a season-high 52 assists and
put up six of the team's 12.5 blocks to force the
Cardinal out of a third-set lull, after which a
shift in momentum helped Stanford to claim
the win.
Despite the weekend sweep, both head
coach John Kosty and his team appeared hesi
tant to declare it a perfect performance.
"We need to work on our serving game."
Kosty said. "After seeing Pepperdine elimi
nate its hitting errors [two weeks ago), we real
ized that we needed to reduce our hitting er
rors too."
Stanford totaled 18 hitting errors on Satur
day. eight of them committed in the third set
alone.The fourth set saw four service errors in
a six-serve span and another four hitting errors.
In all. UCSD had four players break double
digits in kills, an occurrence the Cardinal play
ers feel was a result of their inconsistencies.
"We're a good team, but we're not consis
tent enough to be a great team,"Shoji said."But
we're still improving and continuing to learn
the game. The best is certainly yet to come."
The problem of consistent play is bound to
resurface again this week as Stanford prepares
to tackle No. 3 UC-Irvine and No. 8 UCLA.
Irvine, currently with only one conference loss,
is coming off of a four-game winning streak
after dispatching UCLA last Friday in four sets.

GAME NOTES; The men's volleyball team will travel down to

nal, No. 6 in the nation, is coming off of back-to-back wins
at home against No 7 Long Beach State and No. 15 UC-
San Diego, pushing its record to 7-3 (3-2 in conference)

nament. Irvine proved itself a tough adversary
after the Cardinal scraped by with a narrow
win,3o-27,25-30.30-25,21 -30.15-13. It remains
to be seen whether Stanford can repeat its vic
tory at UC-Irvine s Bren Center.
UCLA will be meeting Stanford for the first
official time this season on Thursday. The Bru
ins, who completed their previous season with a
17-14 record toextend theirstreak t046 consec
utive winning seasons, will be facing the Cardi
nal with a roster composed mainly of returning
veterans.
The matches against Irvine and UCLA are
Stanford's opportunity to iron out any consis
tency issues and to test them against a pair of
strong opponents before the Cardinal hosts No.
5 Southern California and No. 2 Pepperdine the
following weekend, the latter having main
tained an undefeated record so far this season.
"Our team is very talented." said junior out
side hitter Evan Romero. "Once we find our
groove on offense and play defense with the
heart our team has, we will be a strong force l hat
can compete not only with the tough USC and
Pepperdine teams, but with any team in the
country.
"A great rest of the season awaits us."
Romero added.
