# What might have been
## 
### 
As the Stanford men's bas
ketball team stumbles
through Pacific-10 Confer
ence play, one has to sit
back and wonder what could have
been. After a trip to the Sweet 16 in
2()()7-2()()S. it was no shock to anyone
that Ail-American Brook Lopez
turned pro, but the fact that his twin
brother Robin did as well was a bit of
a surprise to many.
Now, midway through the season,
it looks as if both parties, Stanford
and Robin Lopez, are feeling the ef
fects of his decision.
Stanford has struggled all season
to develop any sort of inside game,
which was the Cardinal's bread and
butter a year ago. "Big men" Josh
Owens and Will Paul have continual
ly been overmatched by bigger and
stronger opponents. Both have
played admirably, but they are sim
ply being asked to guard and re
bound against players whom they
shouldn't be matched up against.
Now throw Robin Lopez into the
middle of this Stanford team. The
team would look completely differ
ent and would probably be national
ly ranked. Lopez would guard the
other team's best big man, and with
out his brother getting all of the
touches, Robin would undoubtedly
average more than the 10 points and
six boards he did last year.
With Lopez in the lineup, there is
no way Stanford loses three Pac-10
games by one point. Instead of hav
ing their way down low.Taj Gibson of
Southern California and Jon Brock
man of Washington would likely


Daniel
Bohm
have endured long days at the hands
of Lopez — widely regarded as the
better defender of the twins. Oh. and
Calvin Huynes of Oregon State
might have had some of those run
ners and lay-ups contested with a big
tree in the paint.
With the emergence of Landry
Fields and the resurgence of
Lawrence Hill this year, coupled
with the senior leadership of Mitch
Johnson and Anthony Goods, Stan
ford would be a pretty dangerous
team with a low post presence. In
stead. save a big turnaround. Stan
ford seems to be bound for the Na
tional Invitational Tournament
(NIT).
Part of Lopez has to be thinking
similar thoughts. He is averaging just
three points and 1.7 rebounds per
game as Shaq's backup in Phoenix.
He has been relegated toward the

end of the bench, having appeared
just once in the past five games and
four times in the last 13. Most of the
games he does play are when Shaq
takes a day off or the game is a
blowout.
Had he returned for his junior
season. Lopez would have been able
to be the focal point of the Stanford
offense and move out of the shadow
of his brother. He would have been
able to hone his offensive game and
help Stanford make a run in the
NCAA Tournament. This extra year
(or two) of experience would, bar
ring an injury, have boosted his draft
stock significantly.
It also would have given him both
another year to enjoy college and an
other year to mature into a profes
sional. And had he stayed for two
years, he could have finished his "if
basketball fails, Stanford degree" in
surance plan.
Even Phoenix Suns coach Terry
Porter has noticed that Lopez may
not be ready for the NBA.
"He doesn't seem to have the
focus." Porter said. "[He is] missing

balls. Missing assignments on the de
fensive end. Missing box outs. He
doesn't have the focus when he steps
on the floor."
There has been speculation in
Phoenix that Lopez could be sent to
the Suns' affiliate in the NBAs De
velopmental League — not exactly a
flattering thought for the 15th over
all selection in last year's draft.
All said, though. Lopez can't be
regretting his decision all that much.
He is set to make $1,623,720 this sea
son alone. For those of you doing the
math at home, that's $19.K01.46 for
each of those games he doesn't ap
pear in — just a few grand more then
a quarter at Stanford — per game!
This salary will only increase in the
coming years, regardless of his per
formance, meaning that playing time
or not. Lopez is free to live the good
life—just so long as his idea of a
good life is banging bodies with Shaq
at practice every day.

Dan Bohm is auditioning to be
Robin's life coach. Give him lips at
