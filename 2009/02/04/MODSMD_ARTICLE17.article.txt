# What might have been

As the Stanford men's bas
ketball team stumbles
through Pacific-10 Confer
ence play, one has to sit
back and wonder what could have
been. After a trip to the Sweet 16 in
2()()7-2()()S. it was no shock to anyone
that Ail-American Brook Lopez
turned pro, but the fact that his twin
brother Robin did as well was a bit of
a surprise to many.
Now, midway through the season,
it looks as if both parties, Stanford
and Robin Lopez, are feeling the ef
fects of his decision.
Stanford has struggled all season
to develop any sort of inside game,
which was the Cardinal's bread and
butter a year ago. "Big men" Josh
Owens and Will Paul have continual
ly been overmatched by bigger and
stronger opponents. Both have
played admirably, but they are sim
ply being asked to guard and re
bound against players whom they
shouldn't be matched up against.
Now throw Robin Lopez into the
middle of this Stanford team. The
team would look completely differ
ent and would probably be national
ly ranked. Lopez would guard the
other team's best big man, and with
out his brother getting all of the
touches, Robin would undoubtedly
average more than the 10 points and
six boards he did last year.
With Lopez in the lineup, there is
no way Stanford loses three Pac-10
games by one point. Instead of hav
ing their way down low.Taj Gibson of
