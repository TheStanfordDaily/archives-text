On Feb. 5 and 7.seven members of the Stanford men's gym
nastics team will have the chance to compete in the Winter
Cup Challenge at the Las Vegas Sports Center. The competi
tion is used to select members of the U.S. Men's Senior Na
tional Team.
The gymnasts selected to participate in this year's event are
sophomores Alex Buscaglia. Ryan Lieberman. Josh Dixon
and Tim Gentry, and seniors Bryant Hadden, Sho Nakamori

and Greg Ter-Zakhari
ants. 2008 U.S. all
around champion David
Sender '08 will also he
competing at the event.

division at the Visa Na

GAME NOTES; After a week off, the Stanford
gymnastics team will travel to Las Vegas to
take part in the Winter Cup Challenge.
The Winter Cup is a big opportunity for
gymnasts to claim a place on the United
States National Gymnastics team, and the
Cardinal men will be hoping to make a
good impression.

a collegiate athlete to an international meet if it were close to
the NCAA Championships or other major intercollegiate
competitions.
"Sometimes the international meets are the same weekend
as meets here," Dixon said. "But usually if you have an inter
national meet where you represent the U.S.,you would choose
to go to that."
The opportunity to make this year's national team couldn't
present itself at a better time for the Stanford men because the
Winter Cup is coming off of an Olympic year. The six Olympic
team members will take a year off from being on the national
team to have surgeries and to rest — this allows for the Stan
ford men to be in the running for the available spots.
"It's a chance for the new guys like us to make the nation
al team, while the Olympians are taking a break this year or
may retire,"' Dixon said.
This year is also unique in that the MPC has added one
more spot to the national team, making the group 15 and fur
ther increasing the Stanford men's odds of becoming national
team members.
"The selection process is pretty complicated for those re
maining spots," said assistant coach Dave Durante. "We have
a point system in place that awards points according to how
you finish on each event [first place on the floor gives you 11

and so on]. This is done for every
event and the all-around over the
two days of competition."
This Thursday, the top 42 of the
H4 gymnasts competing will advance
to the finals on Saturday. Scores
from both days of competition will
count toward the final point rank
ings for the all-around and individ
ual events. National team spots will
he allotted to those who earned the
seven highest point totals. The
eighth spot is chosen by the MPC.
while the senior national team coor
dinator selects the ninth spot.
"I don't know how they [the
MPC] came up with such a convo
luted system," Dixon said.
As detailed as the selection
process may be, the men agree they
have a fair system set in place since
seven spots are based on perform
ance, while two spots are based on
discrepancy. They also agree and
are confident they all have a chance
to make the team based on their
competition.
"It's a lot of the same caliber
athletes who we've been competing
against since we were 10. so it's the
same group we're used to and the
field is completely open." Dixon
said.
With seven members competing,
the Stanford gymnastics team has
the largest contingent of the entire
Winter Cup meet, suggesting that
the Stanford men's program is a
strong one.
"The opportunity to have na
tional team members on the Stan
ford gymnastics team puts a magni
fying glass on the Stanford gymnas
tics program," Dixon said."lt seems
the Stanford men's team is doing
something right if its athletes are
being put in a position to become
members on the national team."
The Cardinal's chance to repre
sent both the United States and
Stanford certainly gives the seven
Las Vegas-bound Cardinal men
something to look forward to this
weekend.
