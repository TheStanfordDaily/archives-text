really relax and conserve energy the first hall of the race.and
from there I just had to hold it together and capitalize on the
opportunity."
"It was really good to have him and my other teammates
out there helping out, and I think that kind of team unity has
really helped us this year." he added.
Senior captain Hakon DeVries commended Derrick's
debut indoor meet.
"Chris Derrick continued his incredible freshman year
with his automatic time in the S.(HH)-mcter." DeVries said, re
ferring to Derrick's cross country season, when he placed

ior Zach Chandv, sophomore
Spencer Castro and freshman Dylan
Ferris finished seventh with a time of
9:58.50.
In the sprints, the men were led by
junior Ryan Fisicaro. Fisicaro, who
has consistently been getting closer to
Wopamo Osaisai's Stanford 60 meter
record, finally reached the mark this
weekend, tying for first place in the
event with a time of 6.82 seconds.
"It was a great feeling to have
beaten the record," Fisicaro said. "Al
though I wish I could have won the
race outright instead of tying. It's a
great achievement, but there are still
more goals I have for the rest of the
indoor season, which include helping
our team win the MPSF meet and
qualify for nationals."
Freshman Amaechi Morton also
had an event win to add to the success
of the sprinters, winning the 4(X) with
a time of 47.42: Morton was the only
runner to break 48 seconds at the
meet.
The women also had several no
table performances, with the first
NCAA automatic-qualifying time
coming from the women's distance
medley relay. The team consisted of
senior Alicia Follmar, senior Idara
Otu, freshman Maria Lattanzi and
senior captain Lauren Centrowitz.
The team was Stanford's first to qual

thus far in the season, placing third
with a time of 11:07.53.
Centrowitz and Follmar also
reached automatic-qualifying stan
dards in the 3,000. The pair of sen

times of 9:10.99 and 9:14.98. respec
tively. The race was a best time for

both women.
"It was really nice to open the sea
son with a personal record." Cen
trowtiz said. "It was especially excit
ing to have the potential for three
girls to be in the3K at NCA As. which
is a testament to the strength of our
distance program. And then to have
the DMRalso hit the automatic qual
ifying time is awesome because Stan
ford has such a rich tradition in the
middle distances."
"...with his attitude
and work ethic, the
sky is the limit."

on Chris Derrick
The seniors are leading the way
for the women, having qualified for
nationals in two events this early in
the season. Interestingly enough.
Centrowitz pointed out that it was
Follmar's first time running the 3.(HH)
— a remarkable debut time. Also
doing well in the event was freshman
Laurynne Chetelat. who finished fifth
with a provisional time of 9:16.70.
"Both Lauren and Alicia are sen
iors and are really stepping up and
leading the team." DeVries said.
"They have a lot of experience be
tween the two of them and are run
ning phenomenal right now."
