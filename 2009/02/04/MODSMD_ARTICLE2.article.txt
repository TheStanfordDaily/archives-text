## Students react to VPUE cuts Bravman says this is tip of the iceberg, more to come 
### RYAN MAC DESK EDITOR 
On Jan. 30, Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education John
Bravman '79 announced in a letter that
several of the University's academic
advising systems will he eliminated next
year. Most notable among them are the
Head Peer Academic Coordinator
(HPAC) and Peer Mentor (PM) pro
grams.
While many students and residential
staff members are disappointed with the
cuts, most have understood the financial
context for the decision in a period that
has seen the University's endowment
drop between 20 and 30 percent.
In a phone interview with The Daily,
Bravman suggested that these reduc
tions for the next academic year may
only be the beginning. The decision to
announce the removal of the HPAC and
PM programs was driven by a necessity
to inform students planning for next
year.
"We were entering a period soon
where people are thinking about what
to do for next year, and [we] wanted to
get the word out that these programs
weren't going to be there." Bravman
said. "At this point, the funds from these
cuts are significant, but it's a small frac
tion of the problem that we're facing."
While he did not wish to talk about
other potential budget plans. Bravman
did mention that lie and his office would
have a better sense of the situation in
about a month's time. Furthermore, he
asserted that while certain advising pro
grams may be taking a hit. there is no
intention of curtailing what he called
"core programs," including Freshman
Seminars. Undergraduate Research and
Overseas Programs.
"We do not have to have our budget
prepared until the March time frame."
he said. "The point we're emphasizing is
that we're trying to maintain these core
programs and enjoy a certain education
al renaissance, while at the same time
minimi/ing the number of layoffs. We're
hoping to shield students from feeling
any of the effects that these layoffs may
have."
While cuts to lIPAC positions began
this year, all remaining positions on
campus will be eliminated in the 2009-
2010 academic year. Rinconada I IPAC
