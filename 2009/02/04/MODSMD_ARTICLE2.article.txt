# STUDENT LIFE
## Students react to VPUE cuts Bravman says this is tip of the iceberg, more to come 
### RYAN MAC DESK EDITOR 
On Jan. 30, Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education John
Bravman '79 announced in a letter that
several of the University's academic
advising systems will he eliminated next
year. Most notable among them are the
Head Peer Academic Coordinator
(HPAC) and Peer Mentor (PM) pro
grams.
While many students and residential
staff members are disappointed with the
cuts, most have understood the financial
context for the decision in a period that
has seen the University's endowment
drop between 20 and 30 percent.
In a phone interview with The Daily,
Bravman suggested that these reduc
tions for the next academic year may
only be the beginning. The decision to
announce the removal of the HPAC and
PM programs was driven by a necessity
to inform students planning for next
year.
"We were entering a period soon
where people are thinking about what
to do for next year, and [we] wanted to
get the word out that these programs
weren't going to be there." Bravman
said. "At this point, the funds from these
cuts are significant, but it's a small frac
tion of the problem that we're facing."
While he did not wish to talk about
other potential budget plans. Bravman
did mention that lie and his office would
have a better sense of the situation in
about a month's time. Furthermore, he
asserted that while certain advising pro
grams may be taking a hit. there is no
intention of curtailing what he called
"core programs," including Freshman
Seminars. Undergraduate Research and
Overseas Programs.
"We do not have to have our budget
prepared until the March time frame."
he said. "The point we're emphasizing is
that we're trying to maintain these core
programs and enjoy a certain education
al renaissance, while at the same time
minimi/ing the number of layoffs. We're
hoping to shield students from feeling
any of the effects that these layoffs may
have."
While cuts to lIPAC positions began
this year, all remaining positions on
campus will be eliminated in the 2009-
2010 academic year. Rinconada I IPAC
Angelica Zabanal *09 believes the cuts
may cause a potential problem for
undergraduates, especially freshmen.
"As an I IPA(\ I try to forward all
learning opportunities that come my
way to my residents," she said. "I
think that eliminating the median
position ol the HPAC will especially
affect the freshman experience. ;is
the HPAC is the go-to person for
misunderstandings with the Stanford
Bulletin, particularly in the begin
ning of the year."
But former HPAC Tien Dong 'OS.
now a medical student at the
University of Chicago, remained
skeptical about the long-term effects
ot the VPUE's change in undergrad
uate advising.
"1 am saddened that the HPAC
position is being cut. but it does not
come as a surprise," he wrote in an
email to The Daily.'i believe that the
advising services the University has
at Sweet Hall is very exceptional, so
tor the most part, students won't be
lost without the guidance of
1 IPACs."
"I just hope that without I IPACs.
RAs will get more training about
academic issues to make up for the
services that I IPACs once provided."
Dong added.
Bravman echoed this sentiment,
saying the current on-site profession
al Undergraduate Advising and
Research (IJAR) advisors would be
sufficient in guiding students in the
right direction.
"1 am confident that with aca

demic directors now in place in every
residential complex... and our core
staff of professional advisors located
in Sweet Hall, we have the infra
structure needed to create an excep
tionally strong pre-major advising
program." he wrote in his Monday
letter.
For current Peer Mentor Folake
Dosu '11. the elimination of the Peer
Mentor program may provide for a
better consolidation of advising
resources.
"I spoke to my peer mentor regu
larly as a freshman," she said.
"However, I was fortunate that
things worked out like this, because I
have friends who could not recog
nize their peer mentor for the life of
them, and others have not spoken to
their advisor since fall quarter fresh
man year. There was definitely a lack
of quality control in this program, so
the experiences are diverse, for bet
ter or for worse."
Yet with these specific cuts, stu
dents will essentially be forced to
find their own answers.
In Dosu's opinion, the initiative
now lies in the hands of undergradu
ate students.
"The same students who have the
initiative to seek guidance from their
I IPACs will use that same resource
fulness to find the help they need,"
she said. "With the elimination of
I IPACs and peer mentors, students
could look to online sources of help
in addition to the IJAR advisors. We
just need to come up with creative
solutions to fill the void this program
will leave."
