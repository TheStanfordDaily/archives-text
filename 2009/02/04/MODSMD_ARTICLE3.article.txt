## Students flock to Fraiche Students, owners point to use of Cardinal dollars for popularity 
### FATIMA WAGDY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Alter a week nestled in its new Tresidder
home, Fraiche yogurt has taken the campus
by storm. F.very night around 10 p.m.. a long
line of students waiting for their "fro-yo" fix
snakes through the student union.
Fraiche — pronounced "fresh" — is a

locally owned organic yogurt shop that has
everything from frozen yogurt to coconut
water. It first opened in the summer of 2007
on Emerson Street in Palo Alto.
Jessica Gilmartin, the co-owner of
I raichc. said she saw a market for a loeation
on Stanford campus because of the
University's limited variety of healthy eating
options. I raichc also had many loyal cus
tomers affiliated with Stanford who would
prefer a campus location.
"[The Stanford location] is a really great
option because it's convenient." she said. "I

Fraiche, a popular frozen yogurt shop from Palo Alto, opened a location in Tresidder last
week, drawing long lines of students for its homemade organic yogurt treats.
think people are really excited to
have a healthy dining option on cam
pus. especially since we're open
mornings, nights and weekends."
The convenient location also
attracts students who love the non-
Dining feel.
"It's the closest [thing] to going to
an off-campus restaurant without
having to bike to University
[Avenue],"said Nell Van Noppen'l 1.
Earlier this year. Fraiche decided
to lease a space in Tresidder and set
up shop right next to the Express
Lunch, working with Stanford
Dining along the way.
"We approached Stanford

Dining, and they were already famil
iar with us," Gilmartin said. "We
needed to show them that Fraiche is
a truly unique concept that the
Stanford community would
embrace."
Because Fraiche cooperated v\ith
Dining, it lias the ability to accept
Cardinal dollars by using the same
software other eateries on campus
use. When asked about the use of
Cardinal dollars, Gilmartin said they
strove to make sure students could
use them at Fraiche.
"We knew it would be a win-win
to allow the Stanford community to
use Cardinal dollars." she said. "We
worked very closely with Stanford
Dining to make sure we could accept
them."
Students agree that the Cardinal
dollars help them afford frozen yogurt
and help Fraiche attract business.

"I think [Fraiche] will be consis
tently popular because they take
[Cardinal dollars]." said C Jabi
Ruchelli '11. "It's expensive, but
whatever. It's frozen yogurt."
Fraiche made its presence known
on campus last week with giant
orange balloons spread out over
main traffic areas. When asked about
the balloon campaign. Gilmartin
explained that it was an innovative
way to spread the word.
"We just love to have fun, and
orange is a very signature color of
ours," she said."We thought it would
be a fun, simple, yet visible way to
show people that we're on campus."
Students enjoying Fraiche at night
expressed much satisfaction with
their frozen yogurt.
"It has a much better flavor than
fro-yo from the dining hall because
it's made from real yogurt, so it's

tangy." said Elena Jordan '12. "Its
healthier, sweet and it satisfies."
While some thought the excite
ment would die down over time,
most students who spoke with The
Daily thought that the excitement
would last, insisting that the shop
would continue to be popular.
"I think it's comparable to Olives
in that it will always be popular, - '
Jordan said. "It's one of the better
ways to use your Cardinal dollars on
campus."
Gilmartin said business is great so
far. with consistently long lines each
night.
"To be able to have a fairly guilt
free indulgence, I think, is something
people decided is worth waiting in
line for," she said.
