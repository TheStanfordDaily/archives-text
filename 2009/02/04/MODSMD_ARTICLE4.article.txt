# Senate rejects public financing
## No spending cap or public funds in '09 election 
### MARISA LANDICHO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A much-heralded public financing pro
gram was scrapped during last night's ASSU
Undergraduate Senate meeting after the
Elections Commission and ASSu Executives
could not get the Senate and the Graduate
Student Council (CJSC) to approve the
source of funds for the project.
Even though many members were indi
vidually supportive of the idea, ASSLI Vice
President Fagan Harris '09 and Elections
Commissioner Briana Tatum "11, when faced
with a hedging senate, were forced to hold off
on the measure until 2010.
The program, in its current form, would
authorize $750 in ASSU funds to each stu
dent campaigning for office. Because cam
paign war chests drawn from students' per
sonal finances surpassed $3(XK) last year, the
public financing scheme is intended to make
politics accessible to every student, regardless
of economic status.
After the first year, the public funds will
be drawn from the Executive budget. For the
project to begin this election season, howev
er. the money would have to come from the
reserves of both the Senate and the GSC.
Tatum and Harris, who have invested sub
stantial energy into the project over the past
year, needed the two bodies' approval for a
one-year pilot.
But students will have to wait another
year before ASSU elections are fully democ
ratized. A reluctant GSC and a 6-6 dead
locked senate straw poll doomed the project
to the back burner.
For different reasons, members of both
bodies balked at the proposed plan, all the
while agreeing with the idea itself.
"I'm a little bit concerned that it costs so

much to run for Executive that we are per
haps losing viable candidates." said Senator
Patrick Cordova *09. "At the same time. I'm
also concerned about lots of individuals that
would love to have a pot of money to play
with and perhaps abuse that."
Senator Luukas lives *09 refused to allow
reserve funds, which are collected from the
students at the beginning of the year, on
grounds that students shouldn't pay for peo
ple to campaign to them.
Another objection came from Senator
Stuart Baimel '09. who feared the proposed
plan would let people game the system for
special advantages.
As the program's popularity waned, both
Tatum and ASSU Executives Harris and
Jonny Dorsey *09 expressed frustration with
the lack of consensus on an otherwise widely
supported idea.
"[Public financing] is still something that is
very important to me. but for this election
campaign '09 it seems impossible." Tatum
said."lTie two bodies disagree on fundamen
tals."
Unless the Senate and GSC come to some
agreement quickly, the current elections sys
tem will remain for the spring campaign.
Dorsey and Harris, who spent $3,597.31 on
their own campaign, still plan on writing the
program into the Executive budget for next
year, guaranteeing public financing for ASSU
elections *10 and beyond.
The GSC did not agree with paying for
half of the plan when graduate students
rarely run for executive office. Instead, the
GSC favored a cap on elections spending.
On the other hand, lives criticized institut
ing a cap because it would encourage cheating
and may also limit students' free speech rights.
Tlie result is that come spring, stu
dents will still have to pay out of
pocket for their campaigns.
Later in the meeting, the Senate
made more progress in the realm of
visibility.
Communications Chair Jonathan
McMaster 'II unveiled a Senate
liver to be distributed every other
week to the student body. ITie pro
posed flyer included committee
updates, achievements and future
programs.
An ASSU student group calendar

also recently went online, thanks to
the efforts of Operations Manager
David Gobaud 'ON.
To reach out to the larger commu
nity, Senator Yvorn "Doc" Aswad-
Thomas "II plans to host lunchtime
informal meetings in Stern Hall,open
to all students. Hie first "Focused
Forum" will spotlight housing and
draw reform.
The student body will also be
tapped with regard to budget cuts.
Iâ€¢ ach senate member is tasked with
recruiting two experienced student
group leaders for a meeting of stu
dent experts, to be held sometime
next week.
