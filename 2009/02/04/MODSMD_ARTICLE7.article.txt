## Students think startups in weak economy 
### DAN HUANG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With a soft economy and uncertain job
prospects, students arc seriously considering
entrepreneurial options, especially as layoffs
and hiring freezes make more traditional
career paths look less attractive.
In two weeks, the Stanford Entrepreneurial
Network (SEN) will host Entrepreneurship
Week on campus. "E Week" will feature pro
grams each day including Venture Capital
Speed Dating, workshops for students and net
working mixers and receptions.
"This year. 11--Week] is trying to put an
emphasis on the economic situation by bringing
in speakers to talk about the situation and how
entrepreneurship is thriving.and how it's a real
ly good time to make startups and revive the
economy." said Vesul Myung '(W. president ol
the Asia-Pacific Student Entrepreneurship
Society (ASES).
"Earlier this month, we had our Social E
and E-Challenge kickoff and there was an
amazing turnout for those." said I li Rabek

Co-president of the Business Association of
Stanford Entrepreneurial Students (BASES).
"Based on that, it seems that a lot of people are
considering entrepreneurship who weren't con
sidering entrepreneurship in the past. So I think
that there will be an equal if not greater
amount of excitement on campus for this E-
Week."
E-Week is a joint production of several cam
pus groups, including SEN. BASES. ASES. and
the Stanford Technology Ventures Program
(SI \ P)
"I Week in general provides an ama/ing
opportunity to see the offerings of many on
campus entrepreneurial campus organiza
tions." Rabek s;iid. "|lt| typically showcases
many different elements of entrepreneurship
all within a weeklong setting."
Theresa Eina Stevens, organizer ol I Week
and head of marketing and communications for
STVP. said the week is meant to reach all stu
dents interested in business innovation.
" I Ins is a way to bring together all the entre
preneurial activity on campus for a week." she
said. "The goal is to encourage students to

develop entrepreneurial skills whether or not
they are pursuing it as a course of study."
Some of the events from past years have
come back for 2(K) C ). including Venture Capital
Speed Dating, where students give three
minute pitches to venture capital pairs in
exchange for three minutes of feedback.
Networking events and mixers have also
returned.
Other new events include workshops on
product creation and pitching ideas to venture
capitalists, a debate on where technology is
heading in the future and an opening address
by President John Hennessy.
"I think | E-Week is] obviously important if
John Hennessy is willing to devote an hour of
his time to talk about it." Stevens said. "I think
it is fantastic that we have a president who him
self is an entrepreneur."
One of the more mysterious new events for
this year is entitled "Creativity Challenge:
James Bond Casino Caper." set at an undis
closed location. ITus event is a workshop that
will test participants' creativity and teamwork
â€” with just one catch.

"If you
want to
attend the
event, you have
to get your
self invited."
Mvung said.

"so you'll have to figure out
a way to get yourself on the guest list."
Myung. Rabek and Stevens all agreed that
this year's [--Week will have a strong focus on
opportunities created hv the economy, and that
students will react positively to this.
"There's a lot of had news about the econo
my," Stevens said, "which is real, but at the
same time, wherever there's a problem, there's
opportunity. And that's what we teach students
... So we're not ignoring the economic situa
tion. we're saying 'Given the circumstances,
you'll have to be more entrepreneurial in
approaching things'"
