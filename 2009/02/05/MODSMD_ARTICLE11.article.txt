## GSC discusses wireless problems New scientific research computer facilities to increase efficiency 
### DANIEL BUI 
During their weekly meeting last night, the
Graduate Student Council ((ISC") received a visit
from F.xecutive Director of Information
Technology Services Bill Clebsch.
Clebsch presented the IT strategic plan for 2009
and wanted to make sure that the services were
adequately meeting students' needs. He addressed
a number of issues regarding compatibility
between residential and campus-wide access to
wireless Internet, as students have reported diffi
culty in obtaining wireless Internet at certain
points around campus.
Clebsch noted that the economic environment
has been the root of many issues from Information
Technology Services.
"We've been gradually taking money out of
other programs and putting it into wireless," he
said. "We did manage to nail down a contract with
a distributed antenna provider who's actually
going to give us some money to manage all of the
cell providers on campus."
Clebsch also mentioned plans for the creation
of a local infrastructure on campus that would
improve the quality of resources for researchers at
Stanford.
"What we're really looking at doing is building
a state-of-the-art scientific
research computer facility," he
said.
The new facilities would result
in higher efficiencies in power
usage, resulting in savings of about
$l.h to $1.8 million per year for
every module constructed, accord
ing to Clebsch.
Members of the GSC also dis
cussed the local renovations taking
place in graduate housing. Some
graduate students have been
forced to temporarily move out of
the Blaekwelder apartments due to
renovations, and council members
hoped to find some form of com
pensation for the students.
"A little bit of a discount on
rent of those two weeks should not
be out of the question." said Ryan

Peacock, a third-year chemical
engineering student.
"Maybe we should have some
sort of guaranteed housing, or
some other form of compensation
for the students." added Fen Zhao,
a fifth-year graduate student in
applied physics.
The meeting ended with a dis
cussion of the upcoming campus
elections. Plans were suggested to
make the graduate student body
more aware of the GSC, so that
they can make informed decisions
at the polls later this spring. Items
like party beads and labeled cups
were mentioned as possibilities to
increase awareness.
Events including the Grad
Student Brunch. Executive Debate
between candidates and Rock the
Vote event, featuring a number of
popular student groups, were dis
cussed as ways to maintain last
year's high graduate student
turnout.
In the 2008 spring elections.

graduate student turnout increased
19 percent from the prior year, to
2.675. Graduate students David
Gobaud and Greg Goldgof were
almost elected ASSU President
and Vice President, respectively,
falling just 270 votes shy in the fifth
round of instant runoff voting.
Members of the undergraduate
student body and the GSC talked
about campaign financing.
Possibilities including a cap on
spending, public financing for stu
dents who have difficulty affording
their campaign and the use of the
fundamental standard as a means
of maintaining integrity in cam
paign spending were discussed.
"Its going to be hard." ASSU
Vice President Pagan Harris "09
said. "Enforcement is difficult. We
need to figure something out to
keep [candidates] from abusing the
system."
