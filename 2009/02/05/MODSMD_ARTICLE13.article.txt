## Editorial Stanford should reinstate dependent healthcare 
### 
This editorial originally ran on Nov. 14,200 H.
In 2006, Stanford discontinued itsdepend
ent health insurance plan. Since that
time, graduate students have faced nu
merous problems while trying to insure their
families. The editorial hoard believes that
the University must work harder to reinstate
a sustainable plan for insuring graduate stu
dent families.
Under the previous plan, the dependents
of graduate students made up a separate in
surance pool,apart from the student body as
a whole. Because this was a relatively small
group, the costs to the University, as well as
monthly premiums paid by the students,
were very high. As costs rose, fewer student
families enrolled in the plan.driving up costs
even more. Finally, Stanford decided that the
costs had become prohibitive and discontin
ued the plan.
Although the editorial board recognizes
that costs under the previous plan were high,
the consequences of discontinuing the plan
have also been costly. Several students told
I lie Daily in February that private insurers
were reluctant to cover their young families,
and that private insurance was so expensive
their spouses would not be able to take time
off to care for very young children. The prob
lem was even worse for international stu
dents, whose dependents are required to have
insurance but whose spouses are not allowed
to work.
The Daily is not the only news organiza
tion to have reported on the plight of Stan
ford's student families. In October,The San
Jose Mercury News reported that graduate
students at Stanford are increasingly turning
to subsidized public health insurance plans to
cover their dependents. Stanford encourages
the use of such plans by students who qualify,
hut the editorial board believes that this de
velopment is especially troubling.
Although many graduate students might
technically qualify for programs such as
Medi-Cal and 1 lealthy Families, those pro
grams were not designed for students at elite
educational institutions. Many — certainly
not all—students at Stanford come from
privileged backgrounds and will enter lucra

tive jobs once their studies are complete.
Forcing taxpayers to bear the burden of in
suring their families while they study — par
ticularly when Stanford has a $17 billion en
dowment — undermines the moral argu
ment for government-subsidized health in
surance designed for low-income families.
Furthermore, enrollment in public health
insurance programs can compromise the ed
ucational opportunities of Stanford's gradu
ate students. The Mercury News reported
that because programs such as Medi-Cal only
cover care within the state, professional stu
dents cannot pursue summer opportunities in
other parts of the country. Students with fam
ilies should not be disadvantaged in their ca
reer options. Other professional students find
themselves in a different dilemma: they earn
too much money over the summer to qualify
for subsidized coverage, but not enough to
buy private insurance.
According to news coverage by the Mer
cury News, Stanford is the only top-20 univer
sity that doesn't offer a health insurance plan
to its student families. This could ultimately
make Stanford less competitive for the top
graduate students. Many students are decid
ing to attend graduate school later in life and
are more likely to have families. At Stanford
Law School, a third of the student body is ad
mitted after being out of college for three or
more years. Students at the Graduate School
of Business have an average of almost four
years of work experience before entering
graduate school. It would be a shame for
Stanford to lose the best students because it
could not afford to insure their families.
The editorial board recognizes that health
insurance is expensive and that coverage all
around the country has declined. We. too. re
alize that Stanford finances have been affect
ed by the downturn. We believe, however,
that healthcare should be a priority for Stan
ford in an economic crisis just as it is for the
country. With all of the resources at Stan
ford's disposal — including both finances
and human capital — we find it difficult to
believe that the University cannot find a sus
tainable way to provide insurance to its stu
dent families. We call on the administration to
continue searching for a solution.
