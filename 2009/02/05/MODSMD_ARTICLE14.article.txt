## Defending the SAT from the pitchfork-wielding mob 
### 
This column originally ran on Oct. 14,200 H.
You would think it was the Spanish In
quisition from the tone and content
of the rhetoric coming from those in
the college admissions industry.The Nation
al Association for College Admission Coun
seling (NACAC) recently put out a presti
gious report, chaired by the I larvard admis
sions chief, criticizing the SAT and arguing
for its lessened importance in admissions de
cisions. It seems that the SAT is being
blamed for ail that is wrong in college admis
sions. Our own Editorial Board has joined
the pitchfork-wielding masses, arguing for a
"holistic" admissions process. Everyone is
jumping on the bandwagon.
Ihe main criticism of the SAT, predictably,
comes along class and racial lines. It's telling
that the dominant talk in college admissions
has been about "access" and "empower
ment" rather than normative discussions over
what kind of students top colleges should
admit. Talk about the SAT comes at the ex
pense of more important questions about the
entire direction of college admissions and the
increasing pressure it has on high school stu
dents. ( ritics argue that test prep companies
like Kaplan and Princeton Review, which
offer expensive preparation courses, cause
success on the SAP to be heavily slanted to
those who can afford those courses. ITiis is
ironic, as the SAT was once, long ago. an en
gine of social mobility. Students from un
known or lower income schools could ride a
top-notch score all the way to I larvard. Now.
critics seem to argue, it's preserving the exist
ing social hierarchy.
Ihe SAT, for what it's worth, remains one
of the more meritocratic components of the
college admissions process, despite the recent
criticism. ( "ollege admissions "experts" love to
talk up the importance of grades, but it's un
clear how worthwhile that is in Stanford's case
pretty much everyone applying has excellent
grades.The SAP offers students their only op
port unity to escape a bad school or a mediocre
academic record and prove their real worth.
It's telling that test prep companies never
guarantee a score increase, as its unclear how
much classroom time helps versus just buying
a $20 book and going through it.
Ihe test, ironically, is one of the least
stressful parts of a college application. There's
been a rising tide of critics, such as the Stan
ford School of I ducation's Denise Clark
Pope, who argue that high-school students
are over worked and unhealthily stressed.
Students may stress about the SAT for three
months, but it does not match the activity
arid extracurricular-heavy admissions model

Stanford and other schools now espouse,
which requires students to busy themselves
for four straight years. It's unclear how the
critics of the SAT somehow want students to
stress less by loading up on activities through
out their high school years.
Blaming the SAT is the easy way out of a
real discussion of college admissions. The test
prep industry for the SAT only exists because
the SAI" is important. If AP tests or SAT II
tests were more important, then Kaplan
would move over to them. And attacking the
test prep industry does not even begin to ad
dress an increasing phenomenon: there are
now "admissions consultants," usually former
admissions officers, who charge high rates for
essay writing assistance and admissions ad
vice. The college admissions process will al
ways have inequalities and opportunities for
students with the ingenuity and the income to
game the system.
Hie SAI has become a symbol for larger
debates about college admissions that every
one is avoiding. We're on an inexorable path
that devalues pure academic achievement
and excellence toward the "holistic" model of
"soft" factors such as activities, essays and ex
periences. Ibis method is contentious be
cause, to many,it 's associated with affirmative
action. Public universities in California are
forbidden by law to practice affirmative ac
tion. but a UCLA professor recently alleged
that the implementation of a new "holistic"
process in the school's admissions policies re
sulted in "stealth" affirmative action.
I don't think everyone is comfortable with
the way in which top schools are increasingly
admitting their students. I certainly am not.
There needs to be a serious discussion about
whether the decreasing value of academic
achievement in the college admissions
process benefits students entering university.
Many scholars have written about the declin
ing writing standards at college and how seri
ous intellectual engagement seems nonexist
ent at many schools,including Stanford, (let
ting rid of the SAI' won't solve those prob
lems. or even begin to. In many cases, it will
hurt.
