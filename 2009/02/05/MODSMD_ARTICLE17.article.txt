## Notes from a consumerist 
### 
This column originally run on Oct. 22,2005.
It all began when I bought the blender. I
don't remember what exactly motivated
me to do so. but I'm pretty sure it had
something to do with a desire to make pre
meds wonder what happened to their orgo
homework. That may have been what made
me buy the flamethrower, though -1 can't say
for sure.
In any case, I bought a blender. It's a nice
blender, I think: elegant, sturdy and vicious.
It's the No. 1 result for "blender" on Ama
zon.com, for whatever that's worth.
Amazon, as it turns out. is my favorite
place to buy things. It's got everything
imaginable, after all: blenders, v-neck tees,
office chairs, vibrators, replica 17th-centu
ry triple-barrel flintlock pistols - you name
it. And whatever it is that you end up pur
chasing, it arrives at your doorstep in two
to three days.
But all that is unimportant in comparison
to one simple but profound - intergenera
tional observation regarding Amazon, one
that truly makes the service of the utmost
value to every single college student:
Your parents think it only sells books.
Iliis means, quite delightfully, that after
telling them textbooks are cheaper online
than in the bookstore, you can go ahead and
order an $18,000 grand piano with their cred
it card.
"Sorry, mum. Orgo books are outrageous
these days. You do want me to be a doctor,
right?"
Voila. Blender purchased.
And so it was.
Freshly armed with a brand-new blender.
I found myself faced with the question of
what exactly I should blend. Those of you
who have seen Blendtec's "Will It Blend?"
viral marketing campaign know that just
about anything can be blended, from golf
balls to light bulbs to credit cards to iPhones.
The possibilities are endless.

Endless possibility can make decisions
tough, though, so it's lucky that I happen to
be a narrow-minded reactionary who prefers
blending fruit. While this may seem boring to
you, it's tastier than blended Barbie.
So. decision made, 1 set off in search of
fruit.
Initially, my friend convinced me that the
tastiest and most socially conscious thing to
do would be to purchase fresh fruit from the
East Palo Alto Farmers' Market. 1 whole
heartedly agreed with him and attempted to
do so, but I have yet to succeed in getting up
before 5 p.m. on any Saturday this year. 1
think the Farmers' Market closes a bit earlier
than that.
My next strategy was to patronize the
Stanford Produce Stand. This fantastic little
racket sets up in front of Tresidder every Fri
day afternoon, providing delicious locally
grown produce to the Stanford masses. For
the last few weeks. I've been buying fresh
strawberries and raspberries to compliment
the goodies I pilfer from the dining hall. My
only real complaint about the Produce Stand
is that they don't accept meal plan points,
which they theoretically could do. being a
Stanford Dining service.
Still, they provide good fruit. Unfortu
nately. they only provide in-season fruit, If
you want. say. blueberries • there is a direct
correlation between blueberry consumption
and the ability to fly - you'll have to look else
where.
Where? Well, how about Amazon? I've
purchased everything else there.
After poking around a bit. I ordered a six -

pack of a Klein's dried blueberries. Two days
later, they arrived at my door. I hastily tore
through the environmentally unfriendly
packaging and tried a few.
Not bad for Internet fruit.
Hut then 1 noticed the nutrition facts. In
addition to blueberries, there v\as an extra in
gredient: sulfur dioxide, the chemical preser
vative used in most dried fruits.
My journalistic instincts at full alert. I
Cioogled "sulfur dioxide fatal" and found,
shockingly, that sulfur dioxide can be fatal in
high doses. What happens if I want 2().(H)()
blueberries in my morning smoothie? How
can I increase my ability to fly if I'm dead?
Even worse, dried fruit works best in a
smoothie if you've soaked it a little first.
Which is a pain.
Could it be? Had the Internet finally
failed to provide a solution better than real
life? Never!
I decided that this was the perfect oppor
tunity to try out another Web site people
have been talking about recently, something
called Craigslist. My friends tell me that if
you need something on Craigslist. you just
make a post asking for it.and the friendly
people there will do their best to provide you
with whatever you need.
After making an account. I had to find the
right section to make my request. 1 didn't
want my fruit purchase to be some terribly
formal affair, so I decided to post in the "ca
sual encounters" section. After answering a
few questions about my gender and location.
I wrote, "need some fruit." and then re
mained at my computer, eagerly awaiting re
sponses.
I don't want to talk about what happened
next, but let's just say that there are some
things one's better off doing without the aid
of the Internet. These days. I bike to Safeway,
buy some frozen blueberries and bike back
as fast as I possibly can.

After making an account. I had to find the
right section to make my request. 1 didn't
want my fruit purchase to be some terribly
formal affair, so I decided to post in the "ca
sual encounters" section. After answering a
few questions about my gender and location.
I wrote, "need some fruit." and then re
mained at my computer, eagerly awaiting re
sponses.
I don't want to talk about what happened
next, but let's just say that there are some
things one's better off doing without the aid
of the Internet. These days. I bike to Safeway,
buy some frozen blueberries and bike back
as fast as I possibly can.
