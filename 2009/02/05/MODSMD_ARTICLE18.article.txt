Coming off two blazing victories last week,
Stanford wrestling will host Arizona State Uni
versity this Friday night and then take to the
road to face No. 11 Boise State on Sunday.
Arizona State (5-5) placed fourth in the Pac
-10 conference last year, but lost several of its
high-ranked players for this season. However,
they still boast two nationally ranked, 2(K)N
NCAA qualifiers in their lineup. Redshirt
sophomore Cameron Teitelman will face a
tough match against No. 6 Chris Drouin at 141
pounds, and at 125 pounds, freshman Matt
Scencebaugh takes on No. 11 Anthony Robles.
Robles may be seeking revenge against the
Cardinal as Stanford's Tanner Gardener 'OK
beat him for the Pac-10 championship during
last year's tournament. Scencebaugh returns
from two strong wins last week.
"Matt's confidence has been building, but
this kid [Robles] is good." said coach Jason
Borrelli. "But Matt's probably made the most
progress this season of any kid on our team.
Him and Victor Haug, the two true freshmen
— the progress they've made is incredible."
Boise State (13-3) will be one of the tougher
matchups this season for the Cardinal. Boast
ing a solid lineup that places a nationally
ranked player in nearly every weight class, the
Broncos are the only Pac-10 team that is
ranked nationally. All 10 Boise State wrestlers
placed in last season's Pac-10 championships,
with two winning titles and nine qualifying for
the NCAA Championships. A transfer from
Arizona State also boosts their ranks— IX4-
pound Brent Chriswell, last year's league
champion in his weight class. In the face of this
powerhouse lineup, Stanford is looking for the
silver lining.
"They are probably the best team in the con
ference at this point." Borrelli said. "But
there's still some great opportunities individu
ally for our guys.There are a lot of matches I'm
excited to watch."
One of those exciting matches will be that
of sophomore Porfirio Madrigal, who faced
his Boise opponent Andrew Hochstrasser in
November and lost 7-2. Hochstrasser. a jun
ior. returns to wrestling this season after a
two-year church mission hiatus and last
year's redshirting.
At 197 pounds,senior Luke Feist will battle
No. 5 Brent Chrowell and attempt to add lo his
impressive tally of wins throughout his career.
Two more victories against Princeton and Port

land State last week brought his career total to
76.0n1y three short of ninth place on Stanford's
all-time wins chart.
Sophomore Nick Amuchastegui will also
fight a familiar wrestler this weekend: No. 17
Tyler Sherfy. whom he already defeated once
earlier this season. 1 loping to continue his siz
zling 11-win streak this weekend.
Amuchastegui now stands tied for fifth place
with Zach Zimmerer '00 on Stanford's fresh
man win chart.
Unfortunately. Cardinal wrestling suffered
a blow last weekend when redshirt freshman

Matt Winterbourne. the team's sole heavy
weight wrestler, fell and tore his VK I . ( oming

first half of the season. Winterbourne may not
wrestle again until next season.This means ihe

"You hate to see that happen to a kid that's
worked so hard." Borrelli said. "The whole
thing's been pretty stressful. It's a bummer."
