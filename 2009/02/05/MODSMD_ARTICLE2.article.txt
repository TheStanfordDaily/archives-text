Doubles play has also been strong,
but not quite at the same level as sin
gles. After winning the Sherwood

of three, including both of its matches
last weekend. The Cardinal lost the
doubles point against Auburn, which
came in with two of the top-20 dou
bles teams in the country.
"I want to be a little more aggres
sive in doubles, make [the] other
guys worry about where we're going
and what we're doing." Whitlinger
said. "We have some very capable
doubles players. I have faith in these

doubles combinations and doubles

Not to be overlooked is BYU.
who is 4-2 on the season. The
Cougars, however, were swept 7-0
by UCLA, arguably the only top
team they have played.
BYU's lineup features no ranked
players. The team is led by Hvan

has a record of 5-1 in dual match
play. Gregory Batrakov is 11-6 on
the year and 4-2 in dual matches.
Urbina and teammate A.J. Young
are 10-6 as a doubles team, includ

we can't overlook. We have a lot of
respect for BYU. They are always
anxious and eager to play us. We are
expecting a tough match, as all
matches are."

So, while the Cardinal cannot
completely overlook the Cougars,
its eyes are partly set on next week
end, when they will he playing in
perhaps one of the most prestigious
tournaments in college tennis.
The weather might he a factor on
Friday, perhaps moving the match
indoors in San Francisco or post
poning it altogether. Whitlinger
pointed out that playing BYU in
doors would be beneficial for the
team, as they wili be playing indoors
for the ITAs. Regardless, it would be
beneficial for the Cardinal to get an
other match in this weekend for
some added preparation.
The match is scheduled for 1:30
p.m. tomorrow at the Taube Family
Tennis Center.
