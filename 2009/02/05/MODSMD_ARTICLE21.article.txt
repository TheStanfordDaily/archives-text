# Needed: Strong starts

After superstar Candice
Wiggins left for the
WNBA and junior JJ
Hones injured her knee
(again) at the start of the season, it
would have been easy to assume that
the women's basketball team would
have a "down" year. To be honest. I
didn't see how tliev could avoid tak
ing a small step backwards.
Of course, everyone assumed
that even a down year for this team
would find them in the NCAA tour
nament. still as a single-digit seed.
But it looked unlikely that Stanford
would enjoy another top seed or a
trip to the Final Four.
Yet now. as the second half of
conference play opens this weekend,
this team has made it possible to al
most forget that Candice no longer
roams the floor of Maples.
They are 17-4. and <S-I in the con
ference. At Maples they are perfect,
and have scored at least 100 points
three times in their last six home
games. And. after this weekend in
Washington, they don't have to
leave California again until the
NCAA tournament.
Jayne Appel is capable of scoring
20 points and grabbing 10 rebounds
every night. Jeanette Pohlen can
make plays out of nothing and is
able to hit threes at will when she is
on. Jillian I larmon shoots nearly 50
percent from the floor, and Kayla
Pedersen can score from anywhere.
This team has all the pieces to re
peat last year's run to the title game,
and inside the locker room they cer
tainly expect to do so. Even without
two of the most important contribu
tors from last year's squad, they can
clearly still beat any team in the na
tion.
Hut that doesn't mean they will.
Winning a championship takes
near-perfect basketball. Make just a
handful of mistakes or run into a
cold streak against a top-level team,
and you will inevitably lose.
Stanford is susceptible to slow
starts and shaky first halves. So far,
the team has been able to endure
most of them, but that doesn't mean
they can get away with sloppy play in
the postseason.
In the season opener against
Minnesota, the Card managed just
27 points in an ugly opening half.
Fortunately, the Gophers shot under
20 percent from the floor in that
same span — only scoring 17 — and
Stanford was able to ride out the win
by matching the Gophers the rest of
the way.
Sure, that was the first game of
the season and some rust is likely,
but the slow starts keep occurring
here and there.
At Arizona State last month.
Stanford managed just 24 first-half
points and had to rally in the final
minutes to escape with a win. At
Oregon State a few weeks later, the
Card again found itself trailing at the
break before exploding and outscor
ing the Beavers 42-26 in the second
half. And against DSC and UCLA
last weekend. Stanford waited until
the second half to create a comfort
able cushion for itself.
Yes. you could argue that Stan
ford managed to win every game
mentioned above. You could argue
that the proven ability to clamp
down late in the game and secure the
victory bodes well for its postseason
chances. You could also point out
that, with the exception of the early
loss to Baylor, each defeat has come
in overtime or been by four points or
less.
All of these points are a credit to
Stanford's grit and determination to
win. But that claim is missing the
point.
In the postseason, against teams
like Duke. Tennessee or whoever ar
rives in the Final Four,you can't rely
on a strong finish to win games.
Iliere is no guarantee of an opportu
nity to rally against the best. These
teams can keep piling on points and
bury an opponent that falls behind
early.
lb have a realistic chance of doing
damage in the tournament. Stanford
will have to arrive at the opening tip
with its groove already established.

to establish their offense.
Of course, we know they are ca
pable of this. Against Washington
and Washington State a few weeks
ago, the Card never let its foot off
the pedal.That is the kind of game it
needs to play the rest of the way.
Stanford has the talent, the expe
rience and the determination to go
a long way. But if they don't show it
for the full 40 minutes, don't expect
them to make it.
