## Men seek revenge over Wazzu at Maples 
### HALEY MURPHY DESK EDITOR 
Bob Dylan seemed to
have had it right when he
sang, 'The road is long," and
the Stanford men's basket
ball team can surely attest to
this. The road has indeed
been a rough journey for the
Cardinal, who has dropped
its last three games and its
last four road games to be
come 3-6 in Pacific-10 Con
ference play.
But with the second half
of the Pac-10 season still
ahead. Stanford (13-6) looks
to the upcoming homestand
for a little kick-start to
Dylan's "long, hard climb"
back to at least the .500 mark
in the conference.
Coach Johnny Dawkins
thinks this goal is more than
attainable, searching for the
silver lining in an otherwise
bleak string of one-point
road losses that was capped
with a whopping bv No. 17
UCLA.
"We try to talk about the
fact that if you're in those
games, it shows that you're
doing something right."
Dawkins said. "It shows that
we're doing more things bet
ter than [we're doing] worse .
.. To that point, after the
USC game, we were still

NOTES In seven career games against Wash
ington State, Stanford guard Anthony Goods
has shot 41 percent from the field. Stan
ford's three-game losing streak is its first
since the end of the 2006-2007 season.
Washington State has dropped three of its
last four games.

doing a lot of things better, and it wasn't reflected always by our
record. But we knew as a group we were there."
Senior forward Lawrence Hill agreed that the team feels compet
itive in the Pac-10.
"We're confident that we can compete in this conference." Hill

said. "We've got to get back to what
we were doing earlier in the season."
Stanford's first chance to redeem
itself comes tonight, when Washing
ton State (12-9.4-5 Pac-10) arrives at
Maples Pavilion. The Cougars were
one of the three squads to barely out
last the Card, winning 55-54. when
freshman DeAngelo Casto stuffed
Stanford senior guard Anthony
Goods' final layup attempt.
Since then. Washington State has
gone 3-3, with wins coming largely
from its defensive efforts. The
Cougars boast the best scoring de
fense in the Pac-10. and rank second
in blocked shots.This tough defense,
according to Dawkins, makes them a
challenging opponent.
"They're in lanes, preventing a lot
of their penetration." Dawkins
noted, "Iliey do a good job, and
they're very consistent in their de
fense ... Iliey do a really good job of
having a sense of urgency and con
trolling and stopping penetration.
They force you to do everything
around the perimeter, outside of the
three-point line. And they've been
very effective at that."
lliis, Dawkins added, allows the
Cougars to control the tempo of the
game. And.it is this defensive inten
sity that Stanford hopes to replicate.
"We have to build our foundation
back defensively." he said. "That is
what this program under our staff is
going to be built on. And we have to
go back in our fundamentals and em
brace them, work on them and come
out and execute them when we play .
.. It's about us: it's not about our op
ponents."
I lowever, if it comes down to
being all about the Cardinal, it will
need strong contributions from Hill
and Goods, but also from its role
players, like Mitch Johnson.The sen
ior point guard, who was out for a
week before the USC and UCLA
games, struggled against the Bruins,
scoring only three points and com
mitting six of the team's 19 turnovers.
Dawkins knows that if these mis
takes persist, they will prove costly
against Washington State and oppo
nents throughout the season.
"If we can start to eliminate some
of those I mistakes! — whether it's an

ill-advised turnover, whether it's a
bad shot, whether it was a bad defen
sive possession where we didn't do
something correctly — all of a sud
den you're in better control and in a
better tlow late in the game." he said.
"It's a game of mistakes. It usually fa
vors the team that makes the least
amount of them."
With this in mind. Stanford will
target Washington State's leaders,
freshman guard Klay Thompson,
senior guard Taylor Rochestie and
senior center Aron Baynes. all of
whom average roughly 12 points per
game. Most important among them
might be Baynes, who was held to
seven points in the teams' first meet
ing. The Cardinal is consistently
outscored in the paint — Stanford
will look primarily to sophomores
Will Paul and Josh Gwens to im
prove their efforts down low. Howev
er, the two combined for only 12
points and three boards against
1(1 A.
Dawkins said that it is necessary
that the team receives contributions
from everyone if Stanford hopes to
be successful before March.
"It's a cumulative effect in the 40
minutes [to] put us in position to ei
ther win or lose games," Dawkins
said.
Hill agreed, optimistic that the
team would hit a groove on its home
floor.
"Losing is a habit just as much as
winning is." I (ill said. "We need to go
back to where we were [earlier in the
season], where we should be. back in
the habit of win nine."
