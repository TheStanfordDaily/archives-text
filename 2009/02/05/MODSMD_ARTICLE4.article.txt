# Coach's contract extension postponed
## 
### Wyndam Makowsky 
Stanford football coach Jim Harbaugh's
contract extension has been placed on hold
for the foreseeable future because of the cur
rent economic downturn. Harbaugh had
agreed in principle to a three-year extension
in late December.
After rumors started circulating in early
January that I larbaugh was in t;ilks with a va
riety of Ni l teams, the athletic department is
sued a statement in which I iarbaugh said that
he is "KM) percent committed" to Stanford.
Hut now. Harbaugh and athletic director
Mob Mowlsbv feel that it isn't the right time to

finalize such an extension. Recently, it was an
nounced that the athletic department was
projecting a loss of $5 million over the next
three years, and that there would be staff cuts
and. potentially, the elimination of some varsi
ty athletics teams as a result.
"I'm totally committed to Stanford." Har
baugh told the Has Area News (iroup."l just
don't think it's appropriate with what's going
on with the economy, the pressure that's on
our athletic department."
