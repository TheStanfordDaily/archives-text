## Stanford, Harbaugh land 22 recruits Cardinal class ranks among the top 15 in the nation after signing day 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY MANAGING EDITOR 
The continued revitalization of
Stanford football took another turn
for the better on Wednesday, as the
Cardinal announced the signing of
22 recruits for the class of 2009. It
was the third year in a row where all
committed players penned their
letters of intent.
The group is highly rated — as
of publication. Scout ranks it 14th
in the nation — and diverse.both in
terms of talent and geography; the
signees hail from schools in 12
states and nearly every offensive
and detensive position is represent
ed.
Coach Jim Harbaugh was en
thusiastic about the significance of
this class.
"The foundation for champi
onship football at Stanford has
been laid." he said.
I larbaugh s pitch to the recruits
was along the same lines.
"We promised them that they'll
win " he said. "This group will be
part of a championship football
team in the Pac-10 before they
leave."
His tactics appear to have
worked — of the 22 prospects who
made their commitment official on
Wednesday, 10 carry a rating of four
stars or higher.
But onl> one attained the ever

elusive five star grade: linebacker
Shayne Skov. who is widely viewed
as the jewel of the class. Skov was
Stanford's first commit back in Sep
tember 2007 — he pledged his alle
giance to the Farm on the first pos
sible day.and Harbaugh indicated
that he may be the earliest signed
recruit in modern Stanford football
history.
Skov earned his fifth star after
an impressive performance in the
prestigious US. Army Ail-Ameri
can game, where he had three tack
les for a loss, including two on the
goal line on consecutive plays. Both
Scout and Rivals, the premier re
cruiting services, rank him as the
No. 3 middle linebacker in the
country.
But beyond his football
prowess. Skov also became a pseu
do-recruiter, in that after his com
mitment. he began openly cam
paigning to bring other players to
the Farm.
"Shayne led a lot of recruiting
efforts — grassroots, word ot
mouth." Harbaugh said.
I larbaugh also highlighted simi
lar undertakings by tight ends Zach
Frt/ and 1 evine Toilolo and defen
sive tackle Terrence Stephens.
"The word went out." he said.
"Cireat football players choose
Stanford."
The assistance from the recruits helped the Cardinal to con
tinue to expand its national reach, from local players like Frtz
to East Coast phenoms such as wide receiver Jamal-Rashad
Patterson from Georgia.
Of course, while the committed recruits helped throughout
the process, the vast majority of the work fell on the shoulders
of I larbaugh and his staff — most notably, recruiting coordi
nator Lance Anderson, who also doubles as the team's defen
sive line coach.The 2009 class is the result of over two years of
work that includes whittling down a list of nearly 4.000 re
cruits, extending offers to nearly 150 players, and then further
cutting that number down based on academic and athletic per
formance.

"This group will be a part of a
championship football team in
the Pac-10 before they leave."
— JIM HARBAUGH, head coach

"Today signifies the culmination of a lot of hard work."
I larbaugh said. "At the same time, it's a beginning. A new path
has been laid for these young men."
To that end. Harbaugh expects his recruits to contribute
from their first days on the Farm.
"A lot of these guvs will be instrumental — and early." he
said.
In particular, he highlighted linebacker Geoff Meinken,
who will challenge for time at middle linebacker, and has
played literally every defensive position in high school, and in
a good number of offensive spots as well: safety Jarek I Lancast
er, whom Harbaugh compared to current senior linebacker
Clinton Snyder: and wide receiver Drew Terrell, whom the
coach described as "really special" with the ball. Terrell will

compete for playing time at punt returner, and all running
backs and wide receivers will light for reps.
In particular. Harbaugh was enthused about his running
backs class, which includes Usua Amanam.Stepfan Taylor and
Tyler Gaffney. Amanam is a potential three-way player, while
Gaffney is a two-sport athlete who chose Stanford over I >S('
in part because of the potential to play baseball on the Farm.
Running backs coach Willie Taggert compared Gaffney's run
ning style to junior Toby (ierhart — another two-sport star
and I larbaugh said that Gaffney"s 337-yard, four-touchdown
performance in the California state title game was among the
best individual efforts he had ever seen. Gaffney was named
California's "Mr. Football" after his senior season, when he
scored 56 touchdowns in 14 games.
The only players that I larbaugh will likely aim to redshirt
from the start will be the two offensive linemen in the class,
guard khalil Wilkes and tackle Kevin Danser.so that they can
add the requisite muscle to play the line in the Pac-1(). Addi
tionally, quitrterback Taysom I lill will take a two-year mission,
so he will enroll at Stanford in 2011.
While the Cardinal has now filled its allotted scholarships
for 2009, that doesn't mean that the year's recruiting is over.
Now. the staff will focus on attracting walk-ons to the team,
and I larbaugh indicated there were still more players to add.
"We're still looking for guys to come in and compete." he
said.
Regardless of whether additional players are added to the
class. I larbaugh was clear about the symbolism of this year's
recruiting efforts — that the Cardinal is once again an active
force on this front, and that they'll compete for all qualified
players.
"Stanford football doesn't wait to see who it gets anymore:
we do it early." he said. "We went toe-to-toe with the major
powers, and we won a lot of those battles."
In the end. the coach, who is entering his third year on the
Farm, extolled nothing but excitement about the class, and the
caliber of players and people it included.
"We set the highest standard for getting into a Division-1 A
school." Harbaugh said. "Mighty men — that's what we look
for at Stanford University."
