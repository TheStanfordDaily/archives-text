### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY MANAGING EDITOR 
The continued revitalization of
Stanford football took another turn
for the better on Wednesday, as the
Cardinal announced the signing of
22 recruits for the class of 2009. It
was the third year in a row where all
committed players penned their
letters of intent.
The group is highly rated — as
of publication. Scout ranks it 14th
in the nation — and diverse.both in
terms of talent and geography; the
signees hail from schools in 12
states and nearly every offensive
and detensive position is represent
ed.
Coach Jim Harbaugh was en
thusiastic about the significance of
this class.
"The foundation for champi
onship football at Stanford has
been laid." he said.
I larbaugh s pitch to the recruits
was along the same lines.
"We promised them that they'll
win " he said. "This group will be
part of a championship football
team in the Pac-10 before they
leave."
His tactics appear to have
worked — of the 22 prospects who
made their commitment official on
Wednesday, 10 carry a rating of four
stars or higher.
But onl> one attained the ever

elusive five star grade: linebacker
Shayne Skov. who is widely viewed
as the jewel of the class. Skov was
Stanford's first commit back in Sep
tember 2007 — he pledged his alle
giance to the Farm on the first pos
sible day.and Harbaugh indicated
that he may be the earliest signed
recruit in modern Stanford football
history.
Skov earned his fifth star after
an impressive performance in the
prestigious US. Army Ail-Ameri
can game, where he had three tack
les for a loss, including two on the
goal line on consecutive plays. Both
Scout and Rivals, the premier re
cruiting services, rank him as the
No. 3 middle linebacker in the
country.
But beyond his football
prowess. Skov also became a pseu
do-recruiter, in that after his com
mitment. he began openly cam
paigning to bring other players to
the Farm.
"Shayne led a lot of recruiting
efforts — grassroots, word ot
mouth." Harbaugh said.
I larbaugh also highlighted simi
lar undertakings by tight ends Zach
Frt/ and 1 evine Toilolo and defen
sive tackle Terrence Stephens.
"The word went out." he said.
"Cireat football players choose
Stanford."
