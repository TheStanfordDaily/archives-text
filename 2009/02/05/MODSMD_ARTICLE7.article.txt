## Dement pushes for GER Students think "Sleep" should satisfy natural science GER 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Professor William Dement initiated a large-scale
email campaign on Tuesday, urging students to show the
University that they would not he likely to enroll in his
perennially popular "Sleep and Dreams" (PSYC 135)
course if it no longer fulfilled the natural science general
education requirement (GER).
Dement told students to vote in an online poll hosted
by The Daily to make their opinions known. 1 le also told
students in an email that if at least 1 (X X) people respond
ed to the poll, every student in the class would get bonus
points. When the poll closed at 2:12 am, 805 people had
voted and 679 had followed Demerit's recommendation,
indicating that not having the CiER status might be a
"deal-breaker."
Dement told The Daily that he was very happy with
the online poll but also acknowledged the fact that it
introduced some complexity to the issue. He hopes to
present the poll results as part of the GER application for
"Sleep and Dreams" when he meets with the Senate
Subcommittee on GERs in late spring.
"I understand the GER process, but I don't under
stand why it is so important not to make an exception."
Dement said. "These are administrative rules ... they
guide how the University functions, but that doesn't
mean they should be absolute."
Jessie Van Rheenen '09. head teaching assistant for
PSYC 135. said the course is a legitimate natural science
GER and hopes the online poll will expose student inter
est in the issue.
"Although it is counterintuitive to state that people
wouldn't take the course, [we wanted] to show massive
student support for maintaining the GER." Van Rheenen
said. For Dement, however, the natural science GER
has a greater implication than merely fulfilling university
requirements. In the larger scope of things, he hopes the
GER status will ensure the long-term survival of the class
itself.
Although Dement has no intention of retiring in the

near future, he recognizes there will come a day when he
will no longer teach the course.
"I'm not a young professor." he said. "It isn't clear
what will happen to 'Sleep and Dreams' when I stop
teaching."
He worries that the class will not be offered should he
decide to retire, but is. in the meantime, adamant about
continuing to teach the class provided that enough stu
dents decide to enroll.
"I should go on doing it as long as 1 can, but I'm not
going to do it if it's like for 50 students." he said.
Dement also indicated his willingness to change some
of the course content in order for PSYC 135 to meet the
natural science GER.
"I'm not absolutely rigid." he noted, "but it would
seem to me. if I were willing to make some changes, that
the policy-makers would try to understand my mission,
which I don't think they do."
Dement said "Sleep and Dreams" provides life-saving
knowledge that is not taught elsewhere.
"I think that it's reallv essential information, and it's

something that is hard to find in other places," Van
Rheenen agreed. "Sleep, sleep health and sleep safety fall
in the realm of natural science in some way or other."
"Any student who has taken that course, I don't think
will ever be one of the 40.0(K) who fall asleep at the wheel
every year." Dement added. "To me. that has to have
some importance."
Students said that the course is indeed valuable.
"Learning about the structure of the brain relates to
natural science." Psychology major Turner Figott "II said.
"I think all college students are accumulating a lot of
sleep debt and it's important to learn about sleep because
it affects everyone."
At the same time. Pigott said that the appeal of "Sleep
and Dreams" is not limited to the fact that it satisfies the
natural science requirement.
"I would take it even without the GER." Pigott said.
'"Sleep and Dreams.' it's kind of an iconic class at
Stanford."
