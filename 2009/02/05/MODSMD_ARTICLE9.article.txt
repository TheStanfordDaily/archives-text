## Calif. stem cell funding on hold Weak economic environment results in decreased funding for research 
### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The poor state of California's economy has put a
hold on a $5K million stem cell research grant to he
given to Bay Area schools, including Stanford.
"Clearly this news is disappointing" said School
of Medicine Dean Philip Pizzo in a Feb. 2 newsletter,
"but we need to also acknowledge what we have
accomplished to date in stem cell research, particu
larly through CIRM [California Institute of
Regenerative Medicine]."
To date. Stanford has received over $100 million
in grants from CIRM. a state agency based in San
Francisco that gives grants and loans for stem cell
research.
"The current momentum [of stem cell research)
has been terrific." Pizzo noted, "and Stanford faculty
has played a key role, receiving more peer-reviewed,
competitive funding than any institution in
California and creating a community of excellence
that now extends across the University campus as
well as to collaborators across the state, nation and
world."
But due to California's $40 billion budget deficit
and the state of the national economy, the stem cell
grant is now delayed.
Currently,ClßM has $158 million from past bond
sales, and previously committed grants along with
other expenditures will reduce that number to $3 ( ).2
million by June. Funding is suffering due primarily to
the trouble selling state bonds, including ones
approved for CIRM.
CIRM's future funding was discussed at a meet
ing last week of the Independent Citizen's Oversight
Committee (ICOC), which oversees the actions of
CIRM. Pizzo sits on the ICOC board.
"The ICOC spent considerable time and debate
in considering options." Pizzo said in his newsletter.
"While the first priority must be to honor past, cur
rent and future approved commitments, an impor
tant question was whether to simply stop approving
future awards and to not solicit new proposals."
Pizzo said the ICOC kept in mind CIRM's vari
ous constituents who depend on the funding for
stem cell research. This includes the students,
trainees, faculty, scientists and research universities
who work in the field of stem cell research, as well as
the patients waiting for stem cell
research developments.
"L ven given the realities of the
fiscal crisis in California in particu
lar as well as the events transpir
ing around the world —we still
elected to do our best to find cre
ative ways to move forward." the
dean said.
Hie IC'OC and CIRM will work
to develop funding through private
placement, which Pizzo noted was
going to he challenging.
Don Ciibbons, chief communica
tions officer of CIRM, explained in
an email to The Daily how private
placement would work.
"Normally CIRM bonds would
be lumped together with other state
bonds and sold through a large New
York investment firm." he said. "In
this case, we will be responsible for
marketing them directly to interest
ed buyers. We would expect such
buyers to be motivated by the
potential benefit to humankind
inherent in stem cell science."
Wishing to keep the current pos
itive momentum of stem cell
research going, the ICOC also

approved the Bridges to Stem Cell
Research Proposals and the
Training Grant II proposal at the
meeting. The Training Grant II pro
posal for Stanford scored the high
est in its category.

Although approved, both propos
als are currently not being recom
mended for funding. Iliis decision
will be addressed at future ICOC
meetings, when Pizzo hopes the
budget situation will be made clearer.

"We expect to he able to fund the
grants that were awarded last
week," Gibbons said. "This uncer
tainty is mostly around how long
any delay in the normal funding
cycle may be. At its meeting March
12. our board will reevaluate
whether it is reasonable to assume
sufficient funds will be available
soon, or whether further delay is
warranted."
Gibbons also noted that there
are other ways in which CIRM is
working to battle the deficits creat
ed by California's struggling state
economy.
"Since CIRM's current bonds are
capitalized in a manner that
requires no payments from the state
before January 2010, out current
investment in research and research
facilities is providing a direct eco
nomic stimulus to the state while
having no negative impact on the
perilous state general fund."
Gibbons said.
"The basic mantra of the ICOC
is that we have faced adversity
before and that we have found ways
to overcome major external chal
lenges," Pizzo added in the newslet
ter. "We are committed to doing
that again."
