## Calif. stem cell funding on hold Weak economic environment results in decreased funding for research 
### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The poor state of California's economy has put a
hold on a $5K million stem cell research grant to he
given to Bay Area schools, including Stanford.
"Clearly this news is disappointing" said School
of Medicine Dean Philip Pizzo in a Feb. 2 newsletter,
"but we need to also acknowledge what we have
accomplished to date in stem cell research, particu
larly through CIRM [California Institute of
Regenerative Medicine]."
To date. Stanford has received over $100 million
in grants from CIRM. a state agency based in San
Francisco that gives grants and loans for stem cell
research.
"The current momentum [of stem cell research)
has been terrific." Pizzo noted, "and Stanford faculty
has played a key role, receiving more peer-reviewed,
competitive funding than any institution in
California and creating a community of excellence
that now extends across the University campus as
well as to collaborators across the state, nation and
world."
But due to California's $40 billion budget deficit
and the state of the national economy, the stem cell
grant is now delayed.
Currently,ClÃŸM has $158 million from past bond
sales, and previously committed grants along with
other expenditures will reduce that number to $3 ( ).2
million by June. Funding is suffering due primarily to
the trouble selling state bonds, including ones
approved for CIRM.
CIRM's future funding was discussed at a meet
ing last week of the Independent Citizen's Oversight
Committee (ICOC), which oversees the actions of
CIRM. Pizzo sits on the ICOC board.
"The ICOC spent considerable time and debate
in considering options." Pizzo said in his newsletter.
"While the first priority must be to honor past, cur
rent and future approved commitments, an impor
tant question was whether to simply stop approving
future awards and to not solicit new proposals."
Pizzo said the ICOC kept in mind CIRM's vari
ous constituents who depend on the funding for
stem cell research. This includes the students,
trainees, faculty, scientists and research universities
who work in the field of stem cell research, as well as
