THE GRAMMY AWARDS...

With movie awards season officially underway, you are probably a little tired of hearing the news, '"Slumdog Millionaire' wins ... again!" Luckily
for you, the monotony is about to be broken.
This Sunday, the Grammy Awards take center stage again. Though the show has been pretty dull the past few years, this year's performances will
be a little more exciting: U2, Coldplay and Radiohead will all be performing. Here at Intermission, we want to let you know what's up for awards —
and, of course, help with those betting pools we know you will be throwing your money into.
"Record of the Year" will definitely be going to the most deserving of the nominees: M.1.A., for "Paper Planes." Hey, we told you "Slumdog" was
cleaning everything up this year, and this hit is on its soundtrack. Don't bet on "Viva La Vida" by Coldplay; while this song is nominated for basically
every category, a lawsuit claiming it's a rip-off is sure to taint its success. For the same reason, it probably won't win the "Song of the Year" award.
Instead, that honor will likely go to "American Boy" by Estelle, featuring Kanye West.
Teens will be happy to hear this: The winner of "Best New Artist" will probably be triple teenage heartthrobs The Jonas Brothers. If the boys don't
win, beware of a teen riot. The winner of "Best Female Pop Vocals" will clearly go to the most popular girl of the summer — Katy Perry. While "I
Kissed A Girl" may not be the best song of the group, it was downloaded over three million times on the Internet.
"Best Male Pop Vocals" is a little bit trickier to predict. Jason Mraz had a smash hit in "I'm Yours," but Intermission is going to hesitantly place a
proverbial bet on Ne-Yo's "Closer." This song is, on average, played on rotation every 3.5 songs on all top-40 stations. If you're looking to make money
on this category, look to Ne-Yo.
Probably the most important category of the entire show, "Album of the Year," will be won by an unlikely duo. While I.il Wayne's "Tha Carter III"
may seem the natural and smart choice, Intermission implores you not to choose it. This award is going to go to Robert Plant (former member of Led
Zeppelin) and Alison Krauss for their collaboration, "Raising Sand." The Academy of Recording Arts will always give this award to old-timers, no mat
ter what kind of young talent is included in the category.
We hope you have a great Grammys this year, and using our picks, make the money you need to pay for tuition! ... or at least, a cup of Fraiche.
