# Kristin Reiter, RVCA design-director
## 
### 
Light -haired vintage-junkie, artfully grungy, fabulously unique Kristin Reiter
is the design director of RVCA for a reason. She tells the world why through
her popular fashion and inspiration hlog, bleachblack.com, which is a collab
oration with her close friend, Valerie. There, she posts pictures of mind
blowing vintage discoveries, do-it-yourself (DIY) instructions, drool-inspir
ing designer items and just about anything that inspires her. It sure inspired
Intermissions Joanna Xu, so she gave her a call:

intermission (i): First, tell us a little about
what you do with RVCA, your day-to-day
activities, etc.
Kristin Reiter (KR): Well, I'm the design
director for RVCA, which means 1 work with
Creative Director/Founder PM Tenore on
checking out all the designs that we get. I
work with the art and marketing depart
ments to make sure that everyone is cohesive
and speaking the same language. 1 deal most
ly with men's clothing, women's clothing and
accessories.
On a day-to-day basis? That sort of
depends. 1 review a lot of sketches and do a
lot of fittings. RVCA also does a lot of collab
oration work with different artists and peo
ple, whether that's skaters, surfers or super
models like Erin Wasson. My days are gener
ally quite crazy, but it's nice because there's
something new every day.
i: RVCA is a great surf/skate company, but it's
not particularly known for its clothing line.
How would you describe the line?
KR: I would describe it as utilitarian work
wear, but with a styled twist. [The line) has a
lot of modern pieces. The foundation of the
original RVCA clothing line is men's. All of

the clothing line's a bit unisex — 1 wear a lot
of the men's products as well! Even now, with
the women's line, it's a bit more tomboy-ish.
Which is why Erin Wasson is the perfect face
of the women's line — because yes, she's a
supermodel, but she also has a distinct
tomboy flavor.
/
i: Tell me about the fashion blogosphere. Any
favorite blogs? Experiences?
KR: Well, as you know, Rumi [owner of
highly popular blog Fashion Toast.com) is my
good friend. She kept bugging me to start a
blog myself, so 1 did. The blogosphere is defi
nitely a cool place — though when I first
joined I didn't know about all these unwrit

ten rules, like how if someone frequents
your blog, you kind of have a responsibility
to comment on theirs as well. It's become a
giant community where you can meet peo
ple and make crazy new friends. It can be
overwhelming sometimes because I can't
respond to everything always. Being involved
in fashion? That's my world! So my blog is
related to everything about my work, too.
i: I love the way you dress — it's unique, but .

very comfortable and compatible
with your personality. What advice
do you have to give to college girls
looking for a similar confidence in
what they wear?
KR: For me, I grew up in the
Midwest, so I grew up in T-shirts
and jeans. I developed my fashion
sense by forcing myself into new
situations, introducing myself to
odd people and getting into things
that I was unaware of before. I also
work in a male-dominated compa
ny, so I can't always venture out
into the totally inappropriate. But I
still dress like mvself. You know, I
/
used to get kicked out of class for
being a distraction! 1 think I'll
always be an outsider. Your own

personal style has to have an evolution.
i: What are your favorite types or pieces of
clothing?
KR: No. 1 is jeans, usually RVCA's. 1 also love
tomboy-ish boots, adore T-shirts, love a great
jacket — especially the loose, blouse-y type
— and of course, a great dress. 1 know, it's
surprising — it offsets everything.
i: What about favorite designers?
KR: Tons! First is probably Henry Duarte. It's
hard to find him because he only does cus
tom work now, but he's basically a really
amazing L.A. designer who does a lot of cus
tom denim and '70s-inspired clothing. He

knows fit like no other and is a designer
definitely worth researching. I also love
the designer behind Grey Ant — Grant
Krajecki. He's another L.A. designer
that's really close to me. 1 love everything
'80s and '90s, and early Versace — under
Gianni, not Donatella. I'm in love with
Nicholas Kirkwood shoes.
i: Favorite places to shop?
KR: One of my absolute favorites is a
vintage shop in Hong Kong. There are a
lot of places I love right now —
Maxfield's in L.A. is super cool. I have a
few favorite vintage shops in Huntington
Beach, such as American Vintage. I find
a lot of inspiration pieces there! South
Beach has great summer stuff, Palm

Springs too. And of course, New York has
magnificent stores.
[ Joanna asks about a vintage shop that she
saw Lady Gaga go to in Los Angeles]
KR: I also love Lady Gaga. She's amazing!
That's where the whole massive shoulder-pad
things came from. I also put up a clip of early
Versace/Balmain video on my blog; in my
opinion, that's sort of where all the inspira
tion is coming from now.
i: How essential do you think money is to
stvle?
/

KR: Not at all! I work closely with Erin
Wasson, and she's got amazing style, so of
course a ton of her pieces are ridiculously
high-end. But we've gone shopping before,
and we both love vintage pieces too. Her
great style comes from her awesome eye, and
1 think that's true of everyone. Rumi, too —
she's great at mixing high-end and low-end
pieces, looking fabulous in it. Most people
can't go out and buy $1,200 shoes every sea
son all the time, but they still look fabulous
and stylish!
i: Finally — tell me a fashion week story!
KR: Aggh .. . fashion weeks are always really
crazy. Once, there was a fashion week trip
that was a 24-hour event for me: I flew in
red-eye, went to the Alexander Wang show,
went to his after-party and didn't sleep. It's
fashion week— there are always a million
things going on. Of course, it's a fun time,
but for me it's also a bit stressful just because
I'm working.
Oh — and I'll be going again to New
York in three weeks for Erin's presentation of
the Erin Wasson x RVCA line. Her line is
awesome, and we're super excited to show
everyone!

lot of fittings. RVCA also does a lot of collab
oration work with different artists and peo
ple, whether that's skaters, surfers or super
models like Erin Wasson. My days are gener
ally quite crazy, but it's nice because there's
something new every day.
i: RVCA is a great surf/skate company, but it's
not particularly known for its clothing line.
How would you describe the line?
KR: I would describe it as utilitarian work
wear, but with a styled twist. [The line) has a
lot of modern pieces. The foundation of the
original RVCA clothing line is men's. All of

the clothing line's a bit unisex — 1 wear a lot
of the men's products as well! Even now, with
the women's line, it's a bit more tomboy-ish.
Which is why Erin Wasson is the perfect face
of the women's line — because yes, she's a
supermodel, but she also has a distinct
tomboy flavor.

i: Tell me about the fashion blogosphere. Any
favorite blogs? Experiences?
KR: Well, as you know, Rumi [owner of
highly popular blog Fashion Toast.com) is my
good friend. She kept bugging me to start a
blog myself, so 1 did. The blogosphere is defi
nitely a cool place — though when I first
joined I didn't know about all these unwrit

ten rules, like how if someone frequents
your blog, you kind of have a responsibility
to comment on theirs as well. It's become a
giant community where you can meet peo
ple and make crazy new friends. It can be
overwhelming sometimes because I can't
respond to everything always. Being involved
in fashion? That's my world! So my blog is
related to everything about my work, too.
i: I love the way you dress — it's unique, but .

very comfortable and compatible
with your personality. What advice
do you have to give to college girls
looking for a similar confidence in
what they wear?
KR: For me, I grew up in the
Midwest, so I grew up in T-shirts
and jeans. I developed my fashion
sense by forcing myself into new
situations, introducing myself to
odd people and getting into things
that I was unaware of before. I also
work in a male-dominated compa
ny, so I can't always venture out
into the totally inappropriate. But I
still dress like mvself. You know, I
/
used to get kicked out of class for
being a distraction! 1 think I'll
always be an outsider. Your own

personal style has to have an evolution.
i: What are your favorite types or pieces of
clothing?
KR: No. 1 is jeans, usually RVCA's. 1 also love
tomboy-ish boots, adore T-shirts, love a great
jacket — especially the loose, blouse-y type
— and of course, a great dress. 1 know, it's
surprising — it offsets everything.
i: What about favorite designers?
KR: Tons! First is probably Henry Duarte. It's
hard to find him because he only does cus
tom work now, but he's basically a really
amazing L.A. designer who does a lot of cus
tom denim and '70s-inspired clothing. He

knows fit like no other and is a designer
definitely worth researching. I also love
the designer behind Grey Ant — Grant
Krajecki. He's another L.A. designer
that's really close to me. 1 love everything
'80s and '90s, and early Versace — under
Gianni, not Donatella. I'm in love with
Nicholas Kirkwood shoes.
i: Favorite places to shop?
KR: One of my absolute favorites is a
vintage shop in Hong Kong. There are a
lot of places I love right now —
Maxfield's in L.A. is super cool. I have a
few favorite vintage shops in Huntington
Beach, such as American Vintage. I find
a lot of inspiration pieces there! South
Beach has great summer stuff, Palm

Springs too. And of course, New York has
magnificent stores.
[ Joanna asks about a vintage shop that she
saw Lady Gaga go to in Los Angeles]
KR: I also love Lady Gaga. She's amazing!
That's where the whole massive shoulder-pad
things came from. I also put up a clip of early
Versace/Balmain video on my blog; in my
opinion, that's sort of where all the inspira
tion is coming from now.
i: How essential do you think money is to
stvle?
/

KR: Not at all! I work closely with Erin
Wasson, and she's got amazing style, so of
course a ton of her pieces are ridiculously
high-end. But we've gone shopping before,
and we both love vintage pieces too. Her
great style comes from her awesome eye, and
1 think that's true of everyone. Rumi, too —
she's great at mixing high-end and low-end
pieces, looking fabulous in it. Most people
can't go out and buy $1,200 shoes every sea
son all the time, but they still look fabulous
and stylish!
i: Finally — tell me a fashion week story!
KR: Aggh .. . fashion weeks are always really
crazy. Once, there was a fashion week trip
that was a 24-hour event for me: I flew in
red-eye, went to the Alexander Wang show,
went to his after-party and didn't sleep. It's
fashion week— there are always a million
things going on. Of course, it's a fun time,
but for me it's also a bit stressful just because
I'm working.
Oh — and I'll be going again to New
York in three weeks for Erin's presentation of
the Erin Wasson x RVCA line. Her line is
awesome, and we're super excited to show
everyone!

Light -haired vintage-junkie, artfully grungy, fabulously unique Kristin Reiter
is the design director of RVCA for a reason. She tells the world why through
her popular fashion and inspiration hlog, bleachblack.com, which is a collab
oration with her close friend, Valerie. There, she posts pictures of mind
blowing vintage discoveries, do-it-yourself (DIY) instructions, drool-inspir
ing designer items and just about anything that inspires her. It sure inspired
Intermissions Joanna Xu, so she gave her a call:

intermission (i): First, tell us a little about
what you do with RVCA, your day-to-day
activities, etc.
Kristin Reiter (KR): Well, I'm the design
director for RVCA, which means 1 work with
Creative Director/Founder PM Tenore on
checking out all the designs that we get. I
work with the art and marketing depart
ments to make sure that everyone is cohesive
and speaking the same language. 1 deal most
ly with men's clothing, women's clothing and
accessories.
