# FiLM REVIEW
## It's Oscar time! Mr. Button, you're up first 
### 
Its that time ot the year again
folks: roll out the red carpet and
place your bets on which
movies you want to win that cute
little statue we all call Oscar. In
honor of this glitz and glam, we at
Intermission are bringing you
weekly reviews of this year's much
buzzed about Oscar-nominated
films.
First on the chopping block this
week is Brad Pitt's latest movie "The
Curious Case of Benjamin Button".
Nominated for 13 Oscars, including
best picture and best actor (Pitt),
this film is going to be one of this
year's biggest contenders. At the end
of the day though, does the film
actually live up to its accolades —
or is it just more Hollywood over
hype? If you're as curious as the case
of Mr. Button is, you'll keep read
ing.
If you want to know what to
expect from this film in terms of
style and form, imagine if the films
"Big Fish" and "Forrest Gump" had
a love child — a child named
Benjamin Button. Right away, peo
ple who have seen the two afore
mentioned films will see the simi
larities in Benjamin Button right
down to the, well. . . button.

The film starts off with an old
woman on her deathbed as her
daughter begins to explore the fan
tastical life of Mr. Button by reading
his diary. We are immediately intro
duced to the origins of his birth: if
you haven't already guessed from all
the commercials and movie trailers,
Benjamin is unique in that he ages
backwards. In the beginning of the

Drama
A man who is born old and gets
younger every day nonetheless
experiences love, loss and life.
I . J

film he is a wrinkly old baby, and as
the years go by, his body gets
younger and younger. However,
despite the reverse physical aging,
Benjamin's mind ages normally. For
example, even if his body looks 70

years old, Benjamin is at the intel
lectual level of a seven-year-old.
The movie doesn't really have a
plot but can be best understood as a
movie explaining what life would be
like if you aged backwards. Since the
premise here is really just a man's
aging, the film chugs along at an
appropriate pace — and by appro
priate 1 mean incredibly slow. The

film clocks in at two hours and
48 minutes.
This is not to say that the
film isn't interesting; like all
good epic (and epically long)
movies, this one is chalk full of
quirky and interesting charac
ters (think "Big Fish" again).
As Benjamin goes through life,
his relationships grow with
these characters and are all
affected f>y the fact that he has
to watch all of his loved ones
grow older and die.
The film also has aspects of
a love story which is achieved
through interaction between

Benjamin and Daisy, played by Catc
Blanchett. It is through this rela
tionship where the film's poetics
truly shine. Benjamin meets and
(not surprisingly) falls in love with
