# FiLM REVIEW
## It's Oscar time! Mr. Button, you're up first 
### 
Its that time ot the year again
folks: roll out the red carpet and
place your bets on which
movies you want to win that cute
little statue we all call Oscar. In
honor of this glitz and glam, we at
Intermission are bringing you
weekly reviews of this year's much
buzzed about Oscar-nominated
films.
First on the chopping block this
week is Brad Pitt's latest movie "The
Curious Case of Benjamin Button".
Nominated for 13 Oscars, including
best picture and best actor (Pitt),
this film is going to be one of this
year's biggest contenders. At the end
of the day though, does the film
actually live up to its accolades —
or is it just more Hollywood over
hype? If you're as curious as the case
of Mr. Button is, you'll keep read
ing.
If you want to know what to
expect from this film in terms of
style and form, imagine if the films
"Big Fish" and "Forrest Gump" had
a love child — a child named
Benjamin Button. Right away, peo
ple who have seen the two afore
mentioned films will see the simi
larities in Benjamin Button right
down to the, well. . . button.

The film starts off with an old
woman on her deathbed as her
daughter begins to explore the fan
tastical life of Mr. Button by reading
his diary. We are immediately intro
duced to the origins of his birth: if
you haven't already guessed from all
the commercials and movie trailers,
Benjamin is unique in that he ages
backwards. In the beginning of the

The Curious Case -j \
of Benjamin Button /

Drama
A man who is born old and gets
younger every day nonetheless
experiences love, loss and life.
I . J

film he is a wrinkly old baby, and as
the years go by, his body gets
younger and younger. However,
despite the reverse physical aging,
Benjamin's mind ages normally. For
example, even if his body looks 70

years old, Benjamin is at the intel
lectual level of a seven-year-old.
The movie doesn't really have a
plot but can be best understood as a
movie explaining what life would be
like if you aged backwards. Since the
premise here is really just a man's
aging, the film chugs along at an
appropriate pace — and by appro
priate 1 mean incredibly slow. The

film clocks in at two hours and
48 minutes.
This is not to say that the
film isn't interesting; like all
good epic (and epically long)
movies, this one is chalk full of
quirky and interesting charac
ters (think "Big Fish" again).
As Benjamin goes through life,
his relationships grow with
these characters and are all
affected f>y the fact that he has
to watch all of his loved ones
grow older and die.
The film also has aspects of
a love story which is achieved
through interaction between

Benjamin and Daisy, played by Catc
Blanchett. It is through this rela
tionship where the film's poetics
truly shine. Benjamin meets and
(not surprisingly) falls in love with


COURTESY PARAMOUNT PICTURES
her at first sight when they are young chil
dren. However, due to Benjamin's "condi
tion," he is quite the physical mismatch for
Daisy. The film continues to build on this
mismatch over the years, as the couple seems

| to never be the
right "age" for
I film arc Daisy and
Benjamin finally
right for each
other, which
means that female
audiences will
have to wait a
while before Brad
is finally attractive
on screen.
I won't spoil the
ending for you,

but the film definitely contains some poetic
ad nauseam, making us in the audience feel
like the movie is overexerting itself to make
us -appreciate the "beauty" of the story and
its characters. This point then brings up the

biggest issue that I had in the film the fact
that it was just trying too hard. Watching slow
motion montage sequences with romantical
believc me, this film is l ull of these, and otheu
moments where we are expected to break
down and. But for me, the tears just do not
come.
Bottom line: "The Curious Case of
Benjamin Button' is .1 good movie but
that is it. It's just good, not great. I am not
going to bother contesting the fact tli.it it got
nominated for so many Academy Awards, but
I do think that there are much stronger film
contenders in the mix. Stay tuned for reviews
of those films in the upcoming weeks!
