# Super Bowl commercials: from cute to funny
## 
### 
Ahhh ... the Super Bowl. The
thought of this annual "celebra
tion" brings many the thought of
friends, chicken wings and cold beer. For
me, the Super Bowl is somewhat bitter
sweet. In the fall of sixth grade, I was the
No. 1 female middle school draft pick. My
promising career was cut short when a 32
cross-Z-buttonhook went horribly wrong.
1 shattered my rib cage and experienced a
compound fracture of my left femur. The
heartbreaking injury left me with a hollow
shell.
To this day, I am unable to watch a
single play of the game 1 loved so dearly.
However, there's still a part of the national
phenomena that 1 can enjoy: the commer
cials. Over the years, I have become an
expert in this area. I've had numerous
essays published, three in premier maga
zines, and 1 am working on a 900-page
masterpiece documenting the progression
of the Super Bowl commercial. It's an art,
if you ask me.
between Super Bowl XXIV and last
year's XLII, America experienced a strong
increase in commercial quality, which led
many to believe it would only keep getting
better. Regretfully, this year was somewhat

of a letdown. I have picked my favorite
five to analyze where things went wrong.
Keep in mind, this is only my expert opin
ion and I may have missed a few due to
my intense paranoia of witnessing the
game.
The frontrunner this year was from
our friends at Audi; they aired the only
commercial with a real, live mcga-hottie
badass actor: Jason Statham. It was smart,
entertaining and spanned many decades.
Jason, evidently looking for a new car in
which to make his many getaways, wrecks
both a BMW and a Mercedes (both in the
past, maybe the '50s and '70s, respective
ly). He ends up liking the new A 6. It must
have responded to his touch just the way
he likes it.
The next is from Doritos. It involved
classic spontaneous comedy: a crystal ball
smashing a vending machine, and later
colliding with the boss' genitals. 1 love
genital collisions. Coming in at a close
third was Diet Pepsi-Cola Max — the diet
cola for men. Throughout the entire com
mercial, men are "taking everything" fron'
hitting their heads to more genital colli
sions, showing just how manly diet cola
really is. Fourth, we have Bud Light. A

simple board meeting is taking place, and
a man is thrown out of a window from
three stories up. Who doesn't want to see
that? A very believable fall, too.
Last, but certainly not least, is Coca-
Cola. A man is enjoying an afternoon nap
in the park when the nearby bugs steal his
Coke. Enter a beautifully animated
MouseTrap-like progression, which ends
with all the happy bugs loving their pud
dle of Coca-Cola. This was by far the
cutest commercial of the event.
While I no longer watch the most
important football game of the season,
I'm glad that I can still enjoy chronicling
the best commercials of the event. This
year had some winners, but also some fail
ures. I look forward to next year returning
to the caliber I have come to expect.
