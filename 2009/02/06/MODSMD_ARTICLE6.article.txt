# "Lips Together:" uniting seniors with middle-aqed anqst
## 
### 
Stanford students Zach
Chotzen-Freund, Vanessa
Petrosky and Claire Slattery
performed the play "Lips
Together, Teeth Apart," a 1991
dark commedy by Terrence
McNally, as their joint senior proj
ect.
There is something both
uncanny and marvelous about
watching actors in their early
twenties master the fraught emo
tions of adults struggling with
middle age.
"Lips Together, Teeth Apart"
shows a day in the life of two cou
ples as they try to celebrate the
Fourth of July at a New York
beach house on Fire Island. The
house seems like paradise, but in
reality, it was recently given to
Sally in her brother's will, and for
that reason reminds everyone of
her brother's struggle with AIDS
and a gay lifestyle that relied on
the seclusion of Fire Island.
Although the group thanks God
they aren't gay, their own lives are
far from straight-laced and sim
ple.
Each character's opening lines
present an aspect of their person
alities that they want to portray to
the public. First on stage is
Chotzen-Freund, playing Sam, the
gut-scratching, middle-aged man
who tries to act confident. Next,
Petrosky stomps onto the stage as

Sally — Sam's wife — the distressed
artist struggling with her brother's
death. John, played by Nathaniel
Nelson, is the snooty husband who
hides behind a New York Times
crossword. Slattery plays John's wife
— the perky Chloe, dropping in
French phrases between her inces
sant "friendly suggestions" and
offerings of food and drink.
These seemingly stereotypical
characters, however, soon reveal a
sarcastic and more complex per
sonality that they hide from the
public eye. Although they are sup
posed to be on vacation, the ten
sion between these couples is evi
dent from the start as they silently
wrestle with their own inner
demons. Private monologues
quickly reveal to the audience the
truths each character is trying to
hide. After a few more one-liners,
we understand that the other char
acters already know these truths;
however, as actors in their own
right, they are able to act ignorant
and keep their lips together — for
now.
As the play progresses, the
monologues join into the open
conversations, and every unspoken
word that had been neatly avoided
adds to the foreshadowed chaos.
Through witty jabs and comedic
arguments, the true dynamics
among each of the characters
comes to light. The script offers

interesting commentary on con
temporary issues, but also does
incredible justice to the timeless
theme of letting fear prevent us
from the stirring experience of life.
These actors succeed at creating
their character's individual person
alities and a gripping group
dynamic that allows for subtleties
and outbursts. Equally enjoyable to
watching the characters in the spot
light is observing the expressions
and actions of the characters in the
shadows.
. These actors give life to what
some Stanford students are wit-

nessing their parents go through
and what others fear will eventually
happen to themselves. Although the
subject matter is heavy at first, the
evolution of the characters and plot
allows for moments of genuine
compassion within and amongst
the couples. At times funny, at
times sobering, but consistently
compelling, this senior project is a
theatrical experience not to be
missed.
The play opened last night in
Prosser Studio Theater, located in
the back of Memorial Auditorium.
The remaining performances are

Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights
at 8 p.m., with a matinee at 2 p.m.
on Saturday afternoon. Tickets will
be sold at the door for five dollars.
