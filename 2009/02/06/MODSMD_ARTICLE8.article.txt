# Outdoor survival guide, Sass-style
## 
### 
Though the good weather's gone, Roxy was left looking for the
hot spots for an outdoor campus hookup this past week. But getting
your lovin' on outside isn't easy, even for a pro like Roxy. There's
always the risk that you'll run into your 75-year-old math professor
while grinding against the Quad, and worse yet, the risk that he will
want to join. This in mind, Roxy decided to evaluate a few of
Stanford's naughtiest nooks.
The Cactus Garden
Roxy has often heard rumors that the cactus garden is a free-for
all hookup spot on campus. While she appreciates the value of most
things long and hard, cacti spines may just not he among the hunch.
Don't misunderstand: risk is key to any element of a sexy outdoor
romp. But thinking that you're pleasuring one thing and then realiz
ing you've got your legs wrapped around a spike with a five-syllable
Latin name is a few steps short of terrifying.
Tip: There's such a thing as too long and too hard, and a cactus is
that thing. No room to roll, no place to prop: no place for Roxy.
The Observatory
The observatory is an ideal hookup spot if you are with your new
girl or guy â€” open space, limited chance of getting caught by your
roommate (unless you like that) and just think of the pick-up line
opportunities. None of that, "I'm over the moon for you," business.
Get creative: "Oh sorry, I thought that was the telescope." Or, "Just
reach down here and turn this knob." Or for you science nerds, "I'm
hotter than a blue giant right now."
Tip: Avoid the Uranus jokes. And don't get the metal equipment
stuck anywhere you wouldn't want to explain to a doctor.
The Escondido Playground
Roxy actually knows people who have gotten their freak on at the
Escondido Elementary School playground at night. While Roxy was
initially disturbed, she realizes there are some upsides to doing a little
playing yourself. You've got swings, and well, you get the idea there.
You have great position opportunities on the slides, as long as things
don't get too slippery. Best of all, there are those little holes in the fort
you can, let's just say, stick your head through.
Tip: Night hours only. A playground may be great for some
swinging, hut jail isn't exactly sexy unless you have some very unusual
fetishes.
The Faculty I lot Tub

Rumor has it that this is the
hot spot for SAF. guys to take their
dates. (By "dates," Roxy means
"unwitting victims.") A hot tub is ;
sexy spot to get things ... flowing,
but the deal breaker here is the
word "faculty." There's nothing to
get you, well, down like the mental
image of Hennessy and
Etchemendy chilling there in their
Speedos.
Tip: Let's be honest. You don't
want to get anything stuck in a jet
in the first place, but the idea of
your physics professor finding

you dangling there in the
morning is even worse.
Avery Aquatic Center
Everyone loves a late
night skinny dip, and what
better place to get wet than
Stanford's recreational pool?
Make your own pool rules:
Rough play required; pets
(verb, not noun) are mandato
ry; excessive noise strongly
recommended. While swim
ming and sex are great ways to
get your blood pumping,
swimmers should also he
warned there's a chance the
police will show up. But don't
think of such a scenario as a
drawback. Think of it like this:
free handcuffs.
Tip: lust make sure you
don't get tied up in a lane
divider. Or, if you like it like
Roxy does, make sure you get
tied up in a lane divider.
