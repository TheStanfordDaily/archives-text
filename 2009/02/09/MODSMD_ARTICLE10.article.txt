## Congress may give billions to colleges

The stimulus plan emerging in Wash
ington could offer an unprecedented,
multibillion-dollar boost in financial
help for college students trying to pur
sue a degree while they ride out the re
cession.
It could also hand out billions to the
states to kick-start idled campus con
struction projects and help prevent tu
ition increases at a time when families
can least afford them.
But cuts of $40 billion for state and
local governments in the Senate version
were a big disappointment for college
leaders. House-Senate negotiations will
determine whether education aid to the
states is relatively modest or massive —■
and how much gets directed to high
need institutions for building projects,
versus elite universities that would ben
efit if the final package spends more of
the money on scientific research.
Students are big winners. Both the
House and Senate bills call for the
largest-ever funding increase for Pell
Grants, the government's chief college
aid program for low-income students.
It will take much of the proposed
$15.ft billion increase in the House ver
sion (slightly less in the Senate) just to
erase the existing funding shortfall and
meet the surging demand as the econo
my sours and more students enroll.
But the package would also increase
next year's maximum award by up to
$500, to $5,350. starting. July 1 .That's the
biggest increase in history and would
cover three-quarters of the cost of the
average public four-year college.
Most Pell recipients come from fam
ilies earning less than $40,000. And sup
porters note the new Pell dollars would
be spent almost immediately — stu
dents can't save them — while also pay
ing off down the road.
"Long-term, if we want a better
economy, we need more people going to

college," Education Arne Duncan told
The Associated Press last week.
College leaders meeting in Washing
ton this week for the American Council
on Education's annual meeting will be
grateful for the student aid boost. But
they'll be closely watching how Con
gress bridges the huge gaps between
how much the House and Senate ver
sions propose spending to bail out state
budgets and prevent drastic education
cuts.
The House bills calls for $79 billion
to prevent cuts to local school districts
and public higher education. But it's not
yet clear how the money might be divid
ed between K-12and higher education,
and a portion could go to things besides
education. The Senate version calls for
$39 billion.
Meanwhile,colleges are hoping Con
gress will agree restarting idled building
projects is an efficient short- and long
term investment. As they lose revenues
from state support,endowments and tu
ition. hundreds of projects are on hold
nationwide, from a library extension at
Fresno State to new dorms at Washing
ton University in St. Louis and a biologv
lab at Yale.
The California State University sys
tem alone has halted 130 projects, which
it values at $850 million and says ac
count for 13,000 jobs. Meanwhile, the
system may have to cut 10.000 enroll
ment slots.
The House bill has $6 billion for such
projects, while the Senate has none.
Also helping students, the House
and Senate both call for expanding the
Hope tuition tax credit from $1,800 to
$2,500 and making it partly refundable.
Now. almost half of families with chil
dren pay no income tax, so the current
tuition tax-credit system doesn't help
them (the full benefit kicks in for fami
lies earning at least $43,000).
Hie Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities estimates the change could
help 3.8 million students.
