## Op-Ed Sweat-Free: Why we still care 
### 
Last Friday, over 40 students, Sweat-Free
Coalition members and union mem
bers from the United Stanford Work
ers took a stand against injustice and rallied
umbrellas in hand — to ensure that work
ers in factories are given the basic human
rights to which they are entitled.
Why would we give up an hour of our
Friday afternoon and trudge through rain?
We do it because even after two years of
rallies, sit-ins, sew-ins and informational
workshops, Stanford apparel is still being
produced in sweatshops where workers
suffer from inhumane working hours,
health and safety problems and unjust
wages. Even after hundreds of hours dedi
cated to compiling detailed reports of the
economic and practical feasibility of the
Worker Rights Consortium (WRC) and the
Designated Suppliers Program (DSP) for
meetings with the administration, we still
care because exploitation of workers and
violations of basic human rights still exists,
branded into every shirt or jacket that
bears the Stanford insignia.
After the first part of our campaign in
2007. Stanford agreed to join the Worker
Rights Consortium and adopted a Code of
Conduct. Stanford apparel is currently pro
duced by over 1700 factories in the United
States alone, and over 3400 factories world
wide. Under the current system, the WRC
acts as an independent monitoring organiza
tion that performs unannounced investiga
tions of these factories and notifies Stanford
whenever they find violations of working
conditions. However, there is no guarantee
that Stanford will make any changes as a re
sult of these reports. The WRC recently re
leased a report of 35 investigations of facto
ries around the United States. All 35 facto
ries that were visited had some sort of
human rights violation, and seven were
makers of Stanford University apparel.
Clearly, monitoring is not enough without
a plan of remediation. Under the DSP. facto
ries that produce university apparel would
have to go through a factory certification
program that ensures that workers' rights are
represented. The DSP would also help to
consolidate the number of factories that
Stanford sources from, making monitoring
violations more feasible and giving the Uni
versity more leverage in ensuring that its
policies reflect its values. Fourty-four univer

sities have already signed on to the DSP. in
cluding Brown, Columbia, Georgetown,
Cornell, Duke and the entire UC system.
Support from these institutions for the DSP
not only shows that it has merit as a well-es
tablished program, but highlights the unfor
tunate and conspicuous absence of Stanford.
Despite adopting the WRC. Stanford has
stalled in joining the DSP in the past, essen
tially crippling the effectiveness that these
programs have towards correcting known vi
olations in sweatshops. The WRC and DSP
go hand in hand, and Stanford's support of
one without the other shows a lack of gen
uine commitment to changing the status quo.
Stanford has stated its "belief that workers
are entitled to a healthy, safe,secure and fair
working environment" [see "Students rally
for sweat-free" in today's issue of The Daily]
numerous times in the past» However sincere
its intention, though, its moral integrity is
jeopardized by practices that contribute to
the inhumane treatment of workers.
By joining the list of other schools who
have already adopted the DSP. Stanford
would be standing in solidarity with a dream
that can very much be made a reality. Action
on the university level, however, is only pos
sible through widespread support from its
student population.
As students at Stanford University, one of
the leading colleges in the nation, we should
have the motivation to put our efforts to en
suring the human rights of those we can af
fect. if only because we can make a change.
We have the means of ensuring that workers
have living wages,reasonable hours, the right
to unionize and a safe environment, free
from harassment and intimidation. Frankly,
we should care because it is simply irrespon
sible not to.
Part of being a Stanford student means
having a social consciousness that recognizes
injustice and feels the overwhelming drive to
change it. By supporting or joining the
Sweat-Free Campaign, each and every stu
dent can be a representative voice for those
afraid or unable to speak out for themselves.
As students, we have the opportunity and
power to influence the world around us and
to see that human rights violations do not
occur in Stanford's name.
