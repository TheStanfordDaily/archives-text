News keeps pouring in about how bad
it's getting. Amidst the news that the
economy shed nearly 6(X),(XH) jobs in
January, newly out-of-work Americans were
met with the image of a defiant and unrepen
tant John Thain. The former Merrill Lynch
(T() defended nearly $1 million dollars of re
cent office redecorating, even as President
Obama sought to put a $s(X),(KK)capon exec
utive pay at bailed-out institutions.
What does this all mean, as 1.6(H) other
seniors and I stare down the real world,
looming only four months away? To me, the
worst thing that we've lost in all this isn't a
job market or trust funds or even the overall
sense of security and entitlement that sur
viving four years of the Stanford gauntlet is
supposed to give us. It's respect and trust for
our elders.
I .et me explain. Start with the founding of
America, the Declaration of Independence.
The Founding Fathers signed that document
knowing they all would become marked men
for the rest of their lives. They saw something
far beyond themselves and made sacrifices in
order to leave their children with something
better. In turn, future generations took the
nation they had inherited and worked to im
prove it, even if these changes came through
violent protests and relinquishment of their
parents' beliefs and values (ending slavery or
extending voting rights to all Americans, for
example).
Hiere's always been a basic expectation in
America that each generation lays a solid
groundwork for the next. It's not easy to come
up with a universal set of "American ideals"
given our nation's vast diversity, but the idea
of leaving this world a better place might be
the closest thing we have to a true national be
lief
Fast forward to 2(X) t > and consider the sins
ol our fathers.The most influential and power
ful people in the world —the ones we've al
ways been taught to respect and revere
have absolutely laid waste to it. The captains
of industry outright destroyed our environ
ment, doing more damage in 50years than can
likely be repaired in S(H).
Bankers gutted our financial system, with
the top few pulling wool over the eyes of the
many they lent money for homes and cars
people couldn't afford and put the middle
class at the mercy ol a financial system they
couldn't even begin to understand (Ciod.

could anyone?). The only president we have
known during our formative years, save for
the last few weeks, turned America into a
curse word in foreign lands, leaving us
ashamed and embarrassed to he proud of who
we are.
What it comes down to. I think, is a truly
monstrous act of selfishness — for a genera
tion now. and maybe two. the leaders of fi
nance and industry and government have be
haved in such a fundamentally short-sighted,
reprehensible way that they have left us with
virtually nothing for which to praise or respect
them. It's a shame, too, because history may
eventually judge the whole of the generation
before us — one 1 know to be replete with
wonderful, compassionate individuals —as
the biggest bunch of screw-ups in American
history.
So what do we, a few months from entering
the real world, do when those who have been
iis caretakers have left us with nothing to be
lieve in? You know. I used to get pretty frus
trated that so many of my good friends here
were headed for careers in high finance
They have such dynamic minds! They could he
doing more valuable work than this!—but I
don't anymore. Instead, I'm just so grateful
that it's my friends who are going to inherit the
control of my livelihood and my children's
livelihoods rather than the careless, senseless
hedonists that let billions of dollars simply
evaporate under their watch.
Look at where our country's financial sys
tem is. and suddenly investment banking
might just start lo look like public service, so
long as you enter it with a good conscience
and an eye on never repeating the mistakes of
the past. Our fathers (and mothers) truly did
leave us with a whole mess of problems, but
they also left us with a remarkable opportuni
ty to rebuild the world as a better, fairer and
more inclusive place.
It can be terrifying to think about graduat
ing into a society that seems to be closing its
doors everywhere, but even a glance at the
changes made during our new president's first
three weeks in office should be enough to
renew the hope that there is a path out of this
desolation, and that we have the unique op
portunity to forge it. Maybe where men like
(ieorge Bush and Hemic Madoff close a door.
Barack ()bama opens a window.
