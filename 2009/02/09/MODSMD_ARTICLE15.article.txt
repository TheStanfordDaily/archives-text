## Someone has to deconstruct Valentine's Day; I might as well 
### 
Every year on this line campus, there's
an inevitable large to-do about Valen
tine's Day. As with any event at Stan
ford. it quickly clogs my email inbox. Many
student groups use this "holiday" as an op
portunity to be clever entrepreneurs. SYZ. a
sorority, is offering chocolates for sale. Sever
al a capella groups give you the opportunity to
embarrass your significant other — or worse,
some unsuspecting crush — bv surprising (or
horrifying) them with a set of songs. Stan-
Shakes will perform a Shakespearian sonnet
for your mortified loved one. Spoken Word
will write a piece to rap/perform/whatever it is
they do. L:ven The Daily is in tin the action, of
fering a "classified" ad in this Friday's edition
of the paper.This admirable entrepreneurship
is not limited to Stanford. Southwest offers
cheap (lights, or something, ostensibly to visit
your loved one? I don't think they sell any
thing else.
Valentine's Day is one of those holidays
that seems to be almost entirely the product of
the consumer industry. If we were not told to
buy gifts for our significant other, would we do
it? What would happen if Valentine's Day dis
appeared? Would anyone care? Hallmark
might, but I wouldn't. It does not seem that
anyone enjoys the pantomime and theater of
this holiday.
Most execrable about this so-called "holi
day" is the way that gender roles are con
structed. 'Ihe dominant narrative is as follows:
clueless, boorish, pathetic males are told to
buv taekv. flashy eifts in a verv narrow band

(chocolates, flowers) for their
girlfriends/wives. In return, there is an implied
second component where the attention of
males — the only day they have to do this —
will be rewarded by their thrilled
girlfriends/wives.
This simultaneously lowers the expecta
tions for males — other than this holiday and
perhaps Mother's Day, they do not have to pay
much attention to their girlfriends. At the
same time.expectations are raised for females.
If they are not amenable on Valentine's Day,
or expect more than a large red box of choco
lates, they are considered "unappreciative" or
a "bad girlfriend."
In this way. it has become acceptable for
males to rely on holidays such as Valentine's
Day to show their affection, usually in indus
try-approved red packaging. Hut it has also be
come acceptable for females to simply be con
tent to "receive" on holidays such as this.
There is something terrible about the idea that
one has to "earn affection" on one very partic
ular day in a relationship.
We seem to be engaged in celebrating a
holiday that no one particularly likes. In the

media's construction of heterosexual relation
ships. males dread it because it's a high-risk
scenario: II they succeed in picking something
tolerable, they "pass." But if they spectacular
ly fail, then it might have dire consequences.
Females dread being embarrassed by males
who have the outrageous expectations of the
media override their better instinct. The re
ward of a box of chocolates bigger than your
roommates' cannot possibly be worth it.
Does he really love you if he picks up a
Teddy bear from the Bookstore? Is she really
happy if you paid Mariachi to invade her din
ing hall? There really does seem to be a strong
incentive to do something that is within the es
tablished confines of acceptability — which
were of course formed by the chocolate, greet
ing-card and flower industries themselves.
There is something very contradictory about
celebrating a holiday ostensibly about one's
loved one in a very rote and formulaic way.
Despite all of this, I intend to celebrate this
holiday. Feb. 14 is a day to remember why you
love your boyfriend, girlfriend or yourself, just
like any other day. You don't have to fatten the
coffers of Hallmark. I-8(H)-Flowers or South
west Airlines or pull out all the stops on this
one day to do something meaningful, affec
tionate and personal.
