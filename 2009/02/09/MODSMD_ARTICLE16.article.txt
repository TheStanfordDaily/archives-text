## SERVED UP Men's volleyball comes up short in back-to-back road games 
### JEFF LU STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford men's volleyball team re
mains in search of its first conference road
victory after returning from last week's two
match road trip. Despite strong individual ef
forts across the whole team, the Cardinal was
unable to overcome N0.3 UC-lrvine and No.
8 UCLA, dropping its road record against
ranked conference teams to 0-4.
No. 6 Stanford (7-5.3-4 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) kicked off its Southern
California excursion by visiting UCLA on
Thursday. The Cardinal's performance was
boosted by a season-high 28 kills from jun
ior outside hitter Evan Romero and a ca
reer-high 70 assists contributed by junior
setter Kawika Shoji. But the team was still
unable to overcome the Bruins, eventually
fallinu in five sets to lose 34-36,26-30,30-21,
30-27.15-11.
Stanford was given an opportunity lor the
win in the fourth set. when an opponent at
tack error put the Cardinal up 26-24. UCLA,
however, took advantage of a shift in mo
mentum to end the set with a 6-1 run. with
four points coming off Bruin blocks. In all.
the Bruins had 19 team blocks to Stanford's
five.
"We had opportunities to win. but didn't
take care of business." head coach John
Kosty said."We let it slip away."
Offensively, Stanford matched up well
with UCLA, responding to the Bruins' .357
team hitting percentage with a strong .329
hitting of its own. Sophomore outsider hitter
Spencer McLaughlin hit a solid .429 to tie his

collegiate best of 22 kills, and freshman out
side hitter Brad Lawson. last week's MPSF
co-Player of the Week, contributed another
19 kills.
Kosty. however, believes that serving and
passing are the keys to winning in volleyball.
In particular, he pointed to Stanford's serv
ing falters after the first two sets as a key fac
tor in Thursday night's loss.
Overall. UCLA had 13 service errors and
four service aces to Stanford's 25 service er
rors and two service aces.
Friday night saw Stanford at UC-lrvine.
where poor hitting by the Cardinal players
gave the Anteaters a 30-25,30-23.30-22 win.
extending UC-lrvine's winning streak to
five games. Lawson led Stanford with 12
kills, followed closely by Romero's 11 kills,
but Stanford remained plagued with .164
team hitting, and was unable to offer an ad
equate response to UC-lrvine's 11 blocks
and .317 hitting.
Freshman setter Evan Barry made his
second collegiate start this season and put up
26 assists to bolster Stanford's 40 kills, but
numerous hitting errors by the team shifted
the momentum overwhelmingly in UC
lrvine's favor. With the exception of the be
ginning of the third set. Stanford never led
throughout the entire match.
This weekend, Stanford will be hosting
No. 2 Pepperdine and No. 5 USC. Pepper
dine has recently extended its winning streak
to six and remains undefeated in conference
matches. USC, after a tough, five-set victory
over BYU. has racked up three more wins
since its last encounter with Stanford.
The Cardinal will play Pepperdine at
Maples Pavilion on Friday at 7 p.m.. and will
face USC at the same time on Saturday in
Los Anueles.
