### DANIEL BOHM STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford Softball team opened its season this weekend by
winning four of five games at the Kajikawa Classic in Tempe. Ariz.
The event was highlighted by a 13-run first inning in the Cardi
nal's opening game against McNeese State on Friday, and senior
Missy Penna's fifth career no-hitter Saturday against Kansas.
The Cardinal season started off with a bang Friday when it put
13 runs on the board before its opponent even had a chance to c< >me
to bat. Freshman shortstop Ashley Hansen began the scoring by hit
ting a two-run homerun in her first collegiate at-bat. Stanford then
patiently drew eight walks before junior third baseman Shannon
Koplitz blasted a grand slam to left field to cap the scoring.
Stanford would go on to defeat McNeese State by run-rule. 15-
2 in five innings. Sophomore pitcher Ashley Chinn picked up the
win in the circle.going the distance by allowing just two runs on four
hits.
'Ihe offensive explosion did not carry over to Stanford's second
game on Friday, however. The Cardinal was unable to muster any
sort of attack against Oklahoma State pitcher Anna Whiddon.and
the team fell 1 -0. despite a great outing by Penna.
Stanford managed just three hits for the game, and stranded
eight runners on base.The Cardinal's best chance to score came in
the top of the first inning when junior Alissa Haber reached third
base on a single,a stolen base and a throwing error with nobody out.
But consecutive strikeouts of I lansen and senior Maddy Coon, as
well as a groundout by Koplitz.stymied the rally.
Ihe Cowgirls pushed their lone run across in the bottom of the
fifth on a wild pitch by the otherwise-brilliant Penna.The four-year
starter allowed just two hits and did not walk a batter, despite tak
ing the loss.
Stanford got back to its winning ways on Saturday, taking a pair
of games against Big-12 opponents, defeating Texas Tech 6-1 and
Kansas 11 -0.
Junior catcher Rosev Neill homered twice and provided four
RBIs in the Texas Tech game to lead the Stanford offense, while
Penna struck out 13 Red Raider batters.
It was much of the same in the second game of the day,as Penna fol
lowed up her dominant performance by no-hitting the Jayhawks.
She struck out 13 again in the five-inning run-rule victory,and in the
end. all but two of the game's outs came via the strikeout.
Neill hit her third homerun of the day to lead the Stanford of
fense, while Hansen had a pair of hits and three RBIs.
The Cardinal picked up where it left off on Sunday, closing out
the weekend with a 12-0 run-rule victory over Wagner College.
Stanford t<x>k on Wagner instead of Central Florida — who the
Cardinal was originally scheduled to play — because bad weather
forced game delays that interfered with the Knights' travel plans.
Penna was once again outstanding, holding the Wagner offense
to just two hits while striking out nine. Stanford, in turn, carved up
Seahawk pitching by scoring six runs in both the second and third
innings, blowing the game out of reach for Wagner.
