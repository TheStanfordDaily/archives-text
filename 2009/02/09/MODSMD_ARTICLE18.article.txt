## Men's soccer signs nation's top recruit in Class of 2013 
### JACOB JOHNSON DESK EDITOR 
Soccer season is a long way off, but the
Stanford men's team got some good news
last week: the top recruit in the nation is
coming to the Farm.
Dersu Abolfathi.a midfielder/forward,
is ranked No. I among U.S. soccer
prospects bv topdrawersoccer.com. The
Irvine. Calif, product heads a strong class
for the Cardinal that includes two other
players ranked in the top-KM) in the na
tion. In total, six high school seniors
signed letters of intent to play for Stan
ford.
"I'm very pleased with this class." said
head coach Bret Simon, adding that the
incoming group will improve the team "in

areas we really needed help in."
The 200.X Cardinal squad was compet
itive in almost every game, but goals were
hard to come by.The team losi nine games
by one goal and scored (.inly .7.X goals per
game. Improving the offense was one of
Simon's goals for this off-season, and he
succeeded in bringing in a number of
players who can help in that department.
Abolfathi. for one, should be able to
make a difference for the Cardinal of
fense right away. According to a press re
lease from the Stanford Athletics Depart
ment, he has extensive experience playing
on U.S. youth national teams, including
more than a year "with [the 11 J.S. under-17
residency program." lie currently plays
for the I..A. C ialaxy's "under-IX Academy
team."
Stanford will have another offensive
weapon in the form of local product Eric
Anderson. Simon raved about the San
Francisco native's "great speed and one
versus-one ability." Though Anderson is
not as highly ranked as a prospect, he is a
"regional Olympic Development Pro
gram player" and could be an explosive

threat lor the Stanford offense.
Rounding out the class are defender
Hunter Gorskie (Marlboro Township.
N.J.). ranked No. 30 in the nation by top
drawersoecer.com; forward Adam Jahn
(El Macero. Calif.), ranked as the No. 63
prospect: goalkeeper Galen Perkins
(Westbrook. Maine); and goalkeeper
Jason Dodson (Lake Oswego, Ore.).
Dodson attended l.akeridge High
School, the same school that produced
Stanford women's soccer great Marisa
Abegg and Cardinal women's basketball
star Jillian I larmon.
Though he looks forward to working
with the new crop ol players. Simon is
very pleased with the progress of his cur
rent footballers.
"They've really embraced the oppor
tunity to get better [this off-season]," he
said.
With a little help from the Class ol 2013.
the Stanford men will look to improve on
last year's 4-11-3 finish.
