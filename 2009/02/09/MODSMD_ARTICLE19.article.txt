# There's no need for 'roid rage

### 
On Saturday. I was basking in
the glow of the soon-to-he
returning season of our na
tional pastime at Giants
FanFest at AT&T Park in San Francis
co. For a baseball fanatic, it was a lot of
fun to be able to return to the scene of
all those sun-speckled afternoons of
memories and sporting moments past.
With just a few short days until pitchers
and catchers report to spring training
sites in Florida and Arizona, it's com
forting to know that even in the midst of
winter(albeit a softened. Northern Cal
ifornia version) the return of the Boys
of Summer is just around the corner.
It wasn't until the drive home that I
heard the bombshell news that shook
the sporting world to it's core — for
mer MVP and perennial All-Star Alex
Rodriguez of the New York Yankees
tested positive for anabolic steroids
during the 2(X)3 season.
And suddenly, all hell has broken
loose as the media laments the death of
the American pastime at the hands of
the steroid crisis... again.
To be sure, this is a big deal. But
probably not in the way you think. Ro
driguez was sort of the average fan's
and media's last hope at a "clean"
record. The thinking went that A-Rod
who will turn 33 this season and al
ready has 553 career home runs
would stand a legitimate chance of
breaking Barry Bonds' career mark of
762. Bonds had famously broken I lank
Aaron's record of 755 under the inv
mense national scrutiny spurred on by
his own suspected steroid use. Ro
driguez. it was thought, could break
Bonds' record and remove the "taint"
he put upon the game's history.
Well, so much for that idea. W ho
wants to start the countdown for Ryan
Braun? At his current pace, he's just 20
or so years away — maybe he can save
baseball from the evil touch of per
formance-enhancing drugs.
Seriously.though, it's probably time
for all of us to take a serious look at the
problem and reevaluate how we view
the steroid era — because it isn't going
away. Fans and the media tried to de
lude themselves that it was just a few
bad apples spoiling the whole bunch
that Mark McGwire. Jose Canseco.
