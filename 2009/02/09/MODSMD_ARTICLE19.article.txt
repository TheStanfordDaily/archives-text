# There's no need for 'roid rage

### 
On Saturday. I was basking in
the glow of the soon-to-he
returning season of our na
tional pastime at Giants
FanFest at AT&T Park in San Francis
co. For a baseball fanatic, it was a lot of
fun to be able to return to the scene of
all those sun-speckled afternoons of
memories and sporting moments past.
With just a few short days until pitchers
and catchers report to spring training
sites in Florida and Arizona, it's com
forting to know that even in the midst of
winter(albeit a softened. Northern Cal
ifornia version) the return of the Boys
of Summer is just around the corner.
It wasn't until the drive home that I
heard the bombshell news that shook
the sporting world to it's core — for
mer MVP and perennial All-Star Alex
Rodriguez of the New York Yankees
tested positive for anabolic steroids
during the 2(X)3 season.
And suddenly, all hell has broken
loose as the media laments the death of
the American pastime at the hands of
the steroid crisis... again.
To be sure, this is a big deal. But
probably not in the way you think. Ro
driguez was sort of the average fan's
and media's last hope at a "clean"
record. The thinking went that A-Rod
who will turn 33 this season and al
ready has 553 career home runs
would stand a legitimate chance of
breaking Barry Bonds' career mark of
762. Bonds had famously broken I lank
Aaron's record of 755 under the inv
mense national scrutiny spurred on by
his own suspected steroid use. Ro
driguez. it was thought, could break
Bonds' record and remove the "taint"
he put upon the game's history.
Well, so much for that idea. W ho
wants to start the countdown for Ryan
Braun? At his current pace, he's just 20
or so years away — maybe he can save
baseball from the evil touch of per
formance-enhancing drugs.
Seriously.though, it's probably time
for all of us to take a serious look at the
problem and reevaluate how we view
the steroid era — because it isn't going
away. Fans and the media tried to de
lude themselves that it was just a few
bad apples spoiling the whole bunch
that Mark McGwire. Jose Canseco.


Denis
Griffin
Rants and Raves
Sammy Sosa. Rafael Palmeiro and es
pecially that living, breathing devil.
Barry Bonds, were responsible for all
the sins of the game. II baseball could
only move on and forget about them,
then everything would be okay.
Apparently, that's not working out
so well. Because every time we look up.
someone new is being added to the list
of sinners — Andy Pettite, Roger
Clemens and now Rodriijuez. Yankees

all.hut don't think that there's any fran
chise out there that is without sin. Ro
driguez was just one of 1()4 players who
tested positive in 2003. according to the
story that was broken by Sports Illus
trated over the weekend.The list of the
sainted, it seems, is getting shorter and
shorter, while the list of the damned
continues to grow.
But at this juncture. I think it's fair
to ask a simple question once more:
Why,exactly, are we as a culture so de
termined to weed out the bad apples
of baseball? Indeed, why are we so de
termined to even categorize players
one way or another? We say that base
ball is a sport steeped in history.reliant

upon the numbers and records that
make each modern achievement all
the more marvelous. And to an extent
this is true. But it's a philosophy that's
gone too far.
When Bonds broke Aaron's record,
the public outcry was that Bonds was
tainting Aaron's legacy and that of
baseball by allegedly using steroids and
other illegal performance enhancers to
inflate his statistics. But really.no mat
ter how many home runs Bonds hits, he
would never he able to taint Aaron's
legacy. Whether a player is horn tomor
row who hits I.(XX) home runs some
day. or Aaron's record had stood for
another 1 (X) years, he will always have

-755 home runs to his name.
That's a lot. An incredible number,
really, when we take into account the
era in which he played. And the won
derful thing about achievements is that
no matter what someone else does, you
still have yours and I lank still has his. If
Hank Aaron is your favorite player.
I'm guessing he's still your favorite
player today, regardless of who holds
the official record. Maybe the number
755 isn't quite as important as it was a
few years ago, but that's just a number.
Ilie man who put it up can 't be brought
down by anyone but himself.
The point is this: A-Rod's demise?
Probablv just another in what is sure to

be a long, long list of revelations that
the casual fan won't like to hear. But
honestly, it's probably time for us to just
grow up and deal with it.
On my way home from AT&T
Park. I listened to some sports talk
radio personalities discuss the Alex
Rodriguez situation. One talked
about how he was sad for the sake of
his son, who doesn't look at baseball
players with the same starry-eyed
gaze that the commentator himself
once had. This, one presumes, he
viewed as a true tragedy.
But is it really so bad that children,
along with all the rest of us. view life
without rose-colored glasses? Is it real-

Iv so bad that they're seeing the good
and the bad of sports?
Judging by the number of kids I saw
at AT&T, wearing Lincecum jerseys
and Giants hats, the love of the game is
still there for America's youth, and for
us all. even in one of the stadiums most
associated with the steroid era (thanks
to Bonds' career).The sooner we real
ize that baseball will go on and that the
legends of the past will still be leg
endary. no matter who used steroids
when, the better off we all will be.
