## Bill Lane speaks on Lincoln Lane Center hosts conference on Lincoln and the West 
### LIZ STARK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's Bill Lane Center for the
American West played host on Friday to a dis
cussion of Abraham Lincoln and his legacy in
an all-day conference at the Schwab
Residential Center, featuring five of the
nation's preeminent Civil War-era scholars.
Friday's lectures and panel followed
Pulitzer Prize-winner James McPherson's
keynote address, which took place on
Iliursday.
I"he series was funded by Bill Lane '42. for
mer publisher of Sunset Magazine. Lane, in his
opening speech on Friday, described the root
of his interest in Lincoln and the West.
"My interest in Lincoln started very early."
he said, discussing his time as a tour guide at
Yosemite National Park."l talked my way into
being an intern lecturer on the [tour bus at
Yosemite]. and 1 immediately started studying
Lincoln."
Lane noted that the connection between


ALEX YU/The Stanford Daily
Lincoln and University founder
Leland Stanford furthered his inter
est.
"Lincoln's partnership with, and
admiration of, the first governor of
California, Leland Stanford, was one
of the reasons 1 was so interested in
this topic," he said. "Lincoln got
[Stanford] to agree to take over the
management of Yosemite."
Lane told The Daily that he
developed the idea for the confer
ence with History Professors David
Kennedy and Richard White, both
program directors at the Lane
Center.
Kennedy was pleased with the
group of scholars who addressed the
conference.
"There's a relatively small and
pretty well-known set of people who
work in this area who are the leading
Lincoln and Civil War scholars,"
Kennedy said of the selection
process. "The scholars and their aims
suggested themselves."
Following Lane's speech, Patty
Limerick, faculty director of the
Center for the American West at the
University of Colorado at Boulder,
spoke with humor on the "problem
of patronage and political appoint
ment in the territories."
"When have you secured loyalty
and how do you know when you've
secured it?" she asked the attendees.
"That gets very complicated on the
ground, and it is hard to appoint
people you can fully trust when you
are, as Lincoln was, having to use
those jobs as rewards for people who
have been good to you."
Limerick spoke specifically of
New Mexico and Utah, two territo
ries that, according to her, "were
going to be tough to try to pursue

[Lincoln's] goals of loyalty and a
peaceful West."
Limerick's sense of humor res
onated well with audience, drawing
laughs with lines such as, "the terri
tories of Montana exploded in crab
biness." She also used "many stories
of colorful episodes" in the territo
ries to illustrate that "there is [the
Civil War] on, and yet these people
[in the territories] are behaving as if
they are the center of the universe."
She attributed this to what she
called a general psychological prob
lem — "in such a crisis, territories
are the first to suffer, as they are the
children of the federal government."
Following Limerick's speech was
a panel discussion titled, "Lincoln's
War and Lincoln's West: Ante,
Bellum. and Post." The three panel
members included Director of the
Huntington-USC Institute on
California Prof. William Deverell
'83, former visiting associate profes
sor at Stanford Glenna Matthews
and Chief Historian for San Juan
Island National Historical Park
Michael Vouri.
The conference concluded with a
speech by Elliott West, alumni dis
tinguished professor of history at the
University of Arkansas. West said
the events surrounding the Civil War
and the West were tied together by
three factors: "size, authority and cit
izenship." going on to note that the
issues of citizenship were the "most
intriguing and disturbing."
"The government set out to make
two groups of citizens who had
never been citizens before: freed
people in the South and Indians in
the West," West said. "The federal
government set out to use precisely
the same specific methods to incor
porate these people into the nation:
Christian mission ... and education
not only in language and skills but in
patriotic belief."
The reception of these efforts by
the government, however, varied

between the two groups, according
to West.
"The freed people said great, and
some Indians said fine, hut others
said no thank you." he explained.
"What they were told was.'you don't
understand. This is not an offer; this
is an order."'
West concluded that, with an
examination of Lincoln in the West,
"we're going to have to face the fact
that the Lincoln years have a darker
tone to them."
"We look at the West and we see
that this remaking of America in the
Lincoln years was one of conquest."
West said. "The Lincoln years began
with the war of conquest against our
neighbor to the South, and ended
with a war against the Indians."
Zach Warma '11, a Daily colum
nist and one of the few students in
attendance among a largely older
audience, was glad to have attended.
"An incredibly fascinating point
was raised ... that you so often rele
gate Lincoln to a very specific area,
and the West doesn't get talked
about a whole lot." Wanna said.
"Yes, a good amount of it was about
Lincoln, but the great deal of it was
trying to contextualize the West and
California in US. history."
