## Students rally University for sweat-free apparel Approx. 50 students march for workers' rights 
### FATIMA WAGDY 
Last Friday at noon, almost 50 students,
professors and union workers braved the rain
to gather in White Plaza and march to the
Main Quad, as the Stanford Sweat-Free
Campaign continues to urge the University to
take steps to ensure that its apparel is not pro
duced in sweatshops.
The rally began with a short introduction
from Katie Frank '09. who explained the pur
pose of the rally and the Sweat-Free
Campaign. She outlined the ideas of the
Designated Suppliers Program (DSP) and
insisted that Stanford support it. She said that
full implementation of the program would
stop Stanford from purchasing merchandise
made in sweatshops.
The DSP consolidates factories that manu
facture university apparel, and grants
approved factories guaranteed contracts. For
the last two years, the Stanford Sweat-Free
Campaign has been working with the
University to adopt DSP.
Susan Weinsten, director of trademark
licensing, told The Daily two weeks ago that
Stanford is already actively protecting work
ers rights.
"Stanford decided to implement a pro
gram that supports our belief that workers are

entitled to a healthy, safe, secure and fair
working environment," Weinstein said. "Our
implementation of this program ... was the
result of our collaboration with the very com
mitted Coalition members to explore and
understand the issues and our options."
The University is already a part of the Fair
Labor Association and the Worker Rights
Consortium (WRC). and has a code of con
duct that requires companies that manufac
ture products with the Stanford brand to use
fair labor practices.
But students who attended the rally were
adamant that the University take further
steps, shouting chants through a megaphone,
such as. "How do you spell 'sweat-free'?
DSP!" and "Who's university? Our university.
What do we want to be? Sweat-free."
Carrie Adams '12 spoke about the
maquiladoras she visited in Tijuana and how
that experience inspired her to join the Sweat-
Free Campaign. She called on students to get
involved in the campaign.
At the rally, proponents passed around a
petition for the University community to sign
and demonstrate that they supported full
implementation of the DSP According to
organizers, the group received approximately
100 signatures at the rally.
"There were definitely a lot of people lis
tening. although it died down later." said
Isamarie Perez '09. "It probably would have
been nicer if it wasn't rainy, but I definitely
heard them and was listening for a while."
As the rally moved to the Quad,
the group had dwindled to around
20 students, who headed to a meet
ing in Bldg. 170 with Weinstein. At
the meeting, the students discussed
the issues at hand.
"We presented a case for the
DSP and addressed [Weinstein's]
questions about the program," said
Theresa Zhen '09.
During the meeting. Weinstein
reported on a task force that she has
worked on, which included sending

questionnaires to licensees.
Members of the student group asked
Weinstein to post Stanford's Code of
Conduct for factories online, and she
agreed.
Weinstein also presented her
concerns about the feasibility and
costs of such a program, and pointed
to her task force as a solution. She
was hesitant to issue a public state
ment in support of the DSP because
she disagreed with the solution pro
posed by the DSP. Both the students
and Weinstein do support fair labor
practices, but they are yet to agree
on how to get there.
"We believed that the task force
created by [Weinstein], which relies
heavily on self-reported levels of

compliance by licensees and compa
nies, is a fundamentally flawed and
inadequate approach to the problem
of sweatshops," Zhen said.
"Companies need to be held
accountable through independent
means, and the DSP is the only solu
tion on the table which offers this
independent mechanism through
factory certification, long-term con
tracts, a fair price requirement."
The students commended the
University for demonstrating its
commitment to the sweat-free cam
paign by stating support for a
Knight's Apparel factory in
Honduras, which is a certified sweat
free factory by the WRC, which
oversees the DSP.
However, the group was still con
cerned that human rights abuses
would occur if Stanford did not join
the entire DSP.
The rally ended with a "unity
clap" in which the participants gath
ered in a circle and clapped together
in a certain pattern to show solidari
ty with the factory workers they sup
port.
Following the rally, students com
mented on how they were glad that
there was an ongoing discussion
about sweatshop labor.
"I was really happy seeing stu
dents. workers, and teachers come
together for worker rights," said
Mark Liu '07. "I think it's an impor
tant issue, and it's more than over
due for Stanford to adopt the DSP."
Pahua Cha '10 agreed and
explained that their activism does
not end with a rally.
"1 think the rally went well. The
rain kept some people from coming
out. but we still had a good turnout,"
Cha said.'i don't think the rally's the
most important part though; I think
the important thing is to start a dia
logue with'the administration again."
