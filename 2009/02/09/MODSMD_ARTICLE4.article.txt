# STUDENT LIFE
## Students rally University for sweat-free apparel Approx. 50 students march for workers' rights 
### FATIMA WAGDY 
Last Friday at noon, almost 50 students,
professors and union workers braved the rain
to gather in White Plaza and march to the
Main Quad, as the Stanford Sweat-Free
Campaign continues to urge the University to
take steps to ensure that its apparel is not pro
duced in sweatshops.
The rally began with a short introduction
from Katie Frank '09. who explained the pur
pose of the rally and the Sweat-Free
Campaign. She outlined the ideas of the
Designated Suppliers Program (DSP) and
insisted that Stanford support it. She said that
full implementation of the program would
stop Stanford from purchasing merchandise
made in sweatshops.
The DSP consolidates factories that manu
facture university apparel, and grants
approved factories guaranteed contracts. For
the last two years, the Stanford Sweat-Free
Campaign has been working with the
University to adopt DSP.
Susan Weinsten, director of trademark
licensing, told The Daily two weeks ago that
Stanford is already actively protecting work
ers rights.
"Stanford decided to implement a pro
gram that supports our belief that workers are

entitled to a healthy, safe, secure and fair
working environment," Weinstein said. "Our
implementation of this program ... was the
result of our collaboration with the very com
mitted Coalition members to explore and
understand the issues and our options."
The University is already a part of the Fair
Labor Association and the Worker Rights
Consortium (WRC). and has a code of con
duct that requires companies that manufac
ture products with the Stanford brand to use
fair labor practices.
But students who attended the rally were
adamant that the University take further
steps, shouting chants through a megaphone,
such as. "How do you spell 'sweat-free'?
DSP!" and "Who's university? Our university.
What do we want to be? Sweat-free."
Carrie Adams '12 spoke about the
maquiladoras she visited in Tijuana and how
that experience inspired her to join the Sweat-
Free Campaign. She called on students to get
involved in the campaign.
At the rally, proponents passed around a
petition for the University community to sign
and demonstrate that they supported full
implementation of the DSP According to
organizers, the group received approximately
100 signatures at the rally.
"There were definitely a lot of people lis
tening. although it died down later." said
Isamarie Perez '09. "It probably would have
been nicer if it wasn't rainy, but I definitely
heard them and was listening for a while."
