## Dorsey, Harris say more work needed 
### THOMAS YEH STAFF WRITER 
Students gathered in Old Union Friday
evening to listen as ASSU President Jonnv
Dorsey '09 delivered his State of the
Association address, an annual debriefing
given by the student body president in an
effort to update students on the accomplish
ments and status of the ASSU.
But Dorsey and Vice President Fagan
Harris '09 made it clear that they are
"nowhere near done."
"I really don't want to stand here and tell
you about all that we've done, because
we've got a lot more to do." Dorsey began.
"And looking back on the previous State of
Association speeches. I was less and less
motivated to try to get you guys to come
here, because they had titles like "Executives
Reflect On Previous Year' and 'President
Summarizes Term in Office.'"
"We're not done." he continued. "We're
nowhere near done. 1 don't want to give
that speech, and 1 don't want to see that
headline."

Prior to the address, the audience
received handouts detailing the various
projects the ASSU has already kicked into
gear. After a brief overview of those printed
contents. Dorsey moved on to what he
believed to be the more pertinent aspect of
his address.
"This is more of a recruitment speech."
the President admitted.
Framing the association's goals around
the severity of the current budget cuts.
Dorsey targeted key areas of public service
that demanded improvement, urging for
increased involvement from the student
body and emphasizing the positive effect a
larger voice would have on identifying the
most important issues.
"The reason we decided to [take on these
roles] was because we were both genuinely
depressed." Dorsey said. "So many students
showed up here wanting to have a huge
impact on the world."
He pointed to a number of specifics that
need addressing, including the still-preva
lent issue of sexual assault, the mental health
problems that are plaguing the campus and
a number of much-needed improvements in
the opportunities offered to Stanford's
under-appreciated staff members.
"We've got [one of] the top business
schools and the top School of Education."
Dorsev said. "And vet a lot our staff don't

have any financial advice as their homes are
being foreclosed, and their kids aren't get
ting any tutoring from anyone on this cam
pus."
The president moved the crowd near the
end of his speech, choking up as he recount
ed the conversations he had with a staff
member who was overwhelmed with a stack
of home-foreclosure paperwork that she
couldn't understand, and who wanted noth
ing more than to have her eight-year-old son
tutored by a Stanford student.
These. Dorsey insisted, were problems
that students could address through active
involvement in ASSIJ projects.
Not only did the content of the address
differ from previous years, but the format
was altered as well. Following the speech,
students were allowed to speak with mem
bers of the cabinet on particular projects
that may have sparked their interests.
"Typically in the past, the speech was
often given just to the Senate and to people
who were involved in the more official parts
of the ASSU." said cabinet member Karen
Warner '10. "I think the emphasis on bring
ing members of the student body in for the
address reflects what ASSU has really been
stressing this year, which is to try and engage
the students."
Eric Chamberlain '09, chair of
Student Outreach, agreed.
"We feel like one of the biggest
problems we've had this year is that
there hasn't been the type of commu
nication we need between the student
body and the ASSU," Chamberlain
said. "We wanted to frame the speech

as an opportunity to let people know
what the ASSU is doing, but even
more so, to get them involved."
For audience member Sakshi
Agarwal '12, that goal was achieved.
"I thought his speech was really
good, and it made me want to get
involved," she said.
"He's making a real attempt, and
students should come to hear it,"
added Peter Tu '10.
The take-home message in the
address was made very clear, accord
ing to Harris.

"Given the constraint that we
were constitutionally mandated to do
a State of the Association address, it
made more sense for us to say that so
much of what we're doing is ongoing,
that so much of what we're doing
requires student input and participa
tion," the vice president said. "Why do
a swan song when we can do a call to
action? We're really just getting start
ed."
