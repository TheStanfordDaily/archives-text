GAME NOTES: Stanford gets a second
shot at the Golden Bears on
Valentine's Day after handily defeating
the Washington schools on the road.
Cal handed the Cardinal its only con
ference loss on Jan. 18, but Stanford
hopes a home court advantage will
give it the edge this time around.

Junior center Jayne Appcl led the Cardinal with
41 points and 18 rebounds on the weekend, despite
playing a total of only 47 minutes.
"Jayne is really special," head coach Tara
VanDerveer said. "She has a great feel for the game
and she finishes. She's a big target to pass to. and she
runs the court very well."
Appel has performed well all season for Stanford:
she leads the team in points and rebounds, and is a
close second in assists.
In Friday's game against Washington State (9-13,
2-9), Stanford played sloppy at times and had trouble
holding on to the ball. But, the Card still managed to

sink half of its shots (31-for-62) and
kept the Cougars from ever putting a
run together.
I fowever. the game was not with
out flaws: Stanford turned the ball
over 16 times in the contest, and
made only three shots from beyond
the arc. Luckily for the Cardinal,
Washington State was hardly any
better, committing 15 turnovers of its
own and managing a shooting per
centage of just 24.6 for the game.
"That's disappointing." said
Washington State head coach June
Daugherty. "We've been working
hard on our front-line play."
Appel finished with 25 points and
nine rebounds, and senior forward
Jillian Harmon added another 13
points and eight rebounds. Because
Stanford held a 21-point lead at the
break — which only grew early in
the second half — the Cardinal
bench was able to see significant
minutes.
Freshman center Sarah Boothe
made six baskets for 13 points in the
second half, and redshirt sophomore
guard Melanie Murphy grabbed five
rebounds in just 15 minutes.
"That was me my freshman year."
Appel said. "I had two seniors who
were starters in front of me [Brooke
Smith and Kristin Newlin. both '07),
so I know that now I'm the one in
that role trying to help the younger
players get some playing time and
improve."
With the win, Stanford moved to a
perfect 48-0 against Washington
State since the two schools began
playing each other in 1983.

The first 20 minutes of Sunday's
meeting with Washington (5-16. 1-
10) were marked by a similar mixture
of sloppy ball control and hot shoot
ing. After committing 11 turnovers,
but shooting 56 percent before the
break, the Cardinal headed to the
locker room with a 38-31 lead.
Stanford had opened a 26-14 lead
at one point, but Washington's Sami
Whitcomb scored 10 points in the
final 6:45 of the half to keep the
Huskies within reach.
Stanford responded early in the
second half and rebuilt the Cardi
nal's cushion. Appel scored seven of
her 16 points early in the period, and
the defense held Whitcomb to just
one field goal and six points the rest
of the way.
Appel finished with nine re
bounds. but sophomores Jeanette
Pohlen and Kayla Pedersen out
shone even her stellar numbers.
Pohlen led both teams in scoring with
19 points — including four three
pointers — and Pedersen tagged on
13 points and a game-high 15 re
bounds. just one shy of her career
best. Harmon added another 10
points and redshirt junior Rosalyn
Gold-Onwude notched a game-high
six assists.
7Tie loss was the 10th straight for
Washington, extending the worst los
ing streak in team history.
Stanford now has almost a full
week off before hosting the final in
stallment of the "Battle of the Bay"
against Cal. this Saturday at Maples.
Tip-off for the game is scheduled for
8 p.m. The Cardinal is prefect at
home this season, and five of its
seven remaining games will be at
Maples.
