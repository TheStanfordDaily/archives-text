# Washington streaks away from Card in last minutes
## 
### JACOB JOHNSON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford men's basketball went into
Sunday's showdown with Washington with
an impressive 11-2 record at home this sea
son. But it's difficult to neglect the fact that
the Cardinal has hit a rough patch recently,
dropping three of its last four contests.
The team hoped to build on Thursday's
65-54 defeat of Washington State and
regain some of the momentum it had built
with January wins over Arizona and then-
No. 22 Cal.

Unfortunately. Washington was coming
off three straight losses and was looking for
some momentum of its own.
The No. 22 Huskies (17-6.8-3 Pacific-10
Conference) prolonged Stanford's strug
gles. defeating the Card 75-68 yesterday
afternoon at Maples Pavilion. With the
loss.Stanford fell to 14-7 on the season.and
is 4-7 in the Pac-10. The Cardinal has now
lost two of its last three at home.
"You have to he able to protect your
home court." Stanford head coach Johnny
Daw kins lamented.
It was an exciting first half that saw 10

load changes and nine tie scores. Stanford
first seized the momentum about halfway
into the period and seemed primed to blow
the game open. Senior Anthony Goods
gave Stanford the lead with a three-point
er at 10:38. and freshman Jeremy Green
rejected a shot from Washington's Matt
Brian-Amaning on the next possession.
Goods responded again, as he was fouled
on the other end and converted both free
throws to give Stanford an 18-15 lead.
The senior guard was just one for three
in the first period, hut he was able to penetrate and
get to the line often — he hit five of six free throws
and finished with eight points in the half. Green
sunk a three with just under nine minutes to play,
giving Stanford a 10-point advantage.
But Washington fought back. As soon as the
Cardinal stretched its lead to double digits, the
I luskies went on an <S-() run. Freshman guard Isa
iah Thomas contributed six scores over the stretch,
and junior Quincy Poindexter added two of his 20.
The momentum had swung back to the visitors,
and Stanford went to the break down one.
"This game is made of runs." junior I .andry Fields
said. "When we were up 10 in the first half and they
came back, that was theirs."
Unfortunately for Stanford, Washington's run
continued into the second half. The Cardinal
came out flat, shooting just 2-12 from the field
over the first eight minutes of the second period.
Washington knocked down four of five to start
the half, and the Cardinal suddenly found itself
in a 10-point hole.
"I felt like we got some good shots that didn't
go." Dawkins said. "They made their first four out
of five or something like that, and we didn't re
spond."
"We were getting decent shots." (ioods added,
"they just weren't falling."
Senior Kenny Brown hit a three to narrow the
deficit to single digits at the 12:08 mark, but Wash
ington pushed back and led by 15 with just under 11
minutes to play.
Then it was Stanford's turn to chip away al the
lead.The Cardinal went on a 7-2 run from 10:19 to
8:33, and the game continued to see-saw back and
forth. Fields found a streaking Owens with just over
four minutes to play, and the athletic sophomore
sent the crowd into a frenzy with a high living,
right-handed jam. The dunk cut the Washington
lead to just four, and I iclds baseline lade-away at
2:IK made the score 63-66.
"We madea run late." Dawkins said."and toour
guys' credit, they kept playing."
But that was as close as Stanford would get.
Washington's Thomas hit a jumper to make the
lead five, and Fields and Johnson missed shots on
the other end. Jeremy (ireen picked up two fouls in
the final two minutes his fourth and fifth, fouling
him out of the game. Husky forward Justin Dent
mon converted both free throws, and in the final
