Australian fire zone a crime scene
Suspicions that the worst wildfires ever to strike Australia
were deliberately set led police to declare crime scenes Monday
in towns incinerated by blazes, while investigators moving into
the charred landscape discovered more bodies. The death toll
stood at 130.
Officials believe arson may be behind at least some of the
more than 400 fires that tore a destructive path across a vast
swath of southern Victoria state over the weekend. Prime Min
ister Kevin Rudd, visibly upset during a television interview, re
flected national disgust at the idea.
"What do you say about anyone like that?" Rudd said.
"There's no words to describe it. other than it's mass murder."
Former reformist Iranian president to run again
Former Iranian President Mohammed Khatami declared Sun
day he would run again for president,setting the stage for a major
political showdown in coming months between the popular re
formist leader — who made dialogue with the West a centerpiece
of his eight years in office — and the country's ruling hard-liners.
Khatami's candidacy poses a serious challenge to President
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. whose mixture of anti-Western rheto
ric and fiery nationalism sharply contrasts with Khatami's tem
pered tones and appeals for global dialogue.
"I seriously announce my candidacy in the next (presiden
tial) election." Khatami announced Sunday after a meeting with
his supporters.
Kansas Gov. near top of list for health post
Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius was near the top of President
Barack Obama's list of candidates to head the Health and
Human Services Department, a senior administration official
said Saturday.
The source, speaking on the condition of anonymity to dis
cuss private administration deliberations, said no decision was
imminent and that other candidates remain in the mix. But the
official added the former Kansas insurance commissioner was
rising as Obama considers prospective candidates, in no small
part on the strength of her close relationship with the president.
Sebelius would be Obama's second choice for the slot. For
mer Sen.Tom Daschle had to withdraw his name amid an admis
sion he had not paid taxes on a car and driver since leaving Con
gress as a Democratic leader.
