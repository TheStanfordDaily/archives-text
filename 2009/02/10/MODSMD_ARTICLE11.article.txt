## Emily Grubert The 						sky is spitting on me, and I want rain

Last time I tried to announce ( alifornia's
drought to the campus. I was chalking in
the dead of night. I had policemen look
ing over my shoulder, ready to censor me il I
made any false moves.
ITiat actually is true. It was Big Game week
end.and they were making sure I wasn't writing
"Can't spell sucks without SI J" or something. I
managed to convince them that I am just a nerd
who happened to be concerned about our lack
of concern about water.
"What are you chalking about?" one officer
asked.
"No one on this campus knows how close
we are to having our water rationed!'" I replied.
lie looked at me. thought about whether
that sentiment constituted thinking that Stan
ford sucks.and nodded slowly before lettingme
continue. I ran into another policeman later
and averted questions with a very pleasant con
versation about our shared love ol public safe
ty.
Either way. I didn't need a policeman to
keep my comments about water problems in
check: water emergencies are sort ol sell-cen
soring. Shockingly, they aren't that interesting
as news, 112 ront page headlines: "We're in a
drought! ""We're ... still in a drought!" You get
the point.
()ne effect of water problems' ability to self
repress is that very few people realize how dire
the ( alifornian situation is. Ilie ( alifornia gov
ernment is now citing the current drought
declared officially last June as the worst in
over 150 years. Water withdrawals from the
Sacramento Delta must be cut by 20 to 30 per
cent by court order to prevent fish extinction.
The Sierra snowpack and reservoir storage are
both way below normal levels.
Will we notice? Maybe, maybe not. Civil
water is the last thing to be cut because of sani
tation implications (no water equals standing
sewage equals cholera), but the East Bay al
ready saw rationing last year and state officials
have warned of statewide rationing in 2009.
About SO percent of the water consumed (not
withdrawn, for all you lovers ol water-use statis
tics) in California goes to agriculture, and we
supply half the nation's fruits, vegetables and
nuts, so in drv times, most gallons allocated to
cities are gallons taken away from a plant some
where. which means less produce in the I ! S.
And here's the kicker It's not just California
struggling with this.
The China Daily got really excited over the
weekend about getting 0.5 to 5 mm of rain in

some areas (no. that's not very much). Why?
Hie Chinese government officially declared
the highest level of emergency for the first
time ever due to the worst drought China's
had since at least 1951. Forty-three percent of
the wheat crop is threatened. Birds are under
massive water stress, which probably means
massive breakouts of bird flu as they become
less able to counter disease. Four million peo
ple have had their access to drinking water cut.
Jiangxi Province — which is subtropical
(think Florida) — is in a cracked-earth
drought.This. in no uncertain terms, is a disas
ter. Fortunately, the country has stored grain,
but what could prolonged drought do? Who
else can feed ( hina?
Australia's drought has also become news
worthy. Record temperatures around 1 17 de
grees, coupled with the drought-stricken land
scape. have produced the country's most fatal
wildfires ever. Over 160 people were dead as of
Monday, more than twice 1983's previous
record, and the Australian government is ex
pected to prosecute arsonists for murder. I hese
fires assuredly would not have spread so far and
so fast absent a drought, especially because of
the tendency of hot. dry eucalyptus to sponta
neously combust. Fven in wet periods, eucalyp
tus trees are extremely flammable, which is one
reason a dear friend of mine frequently re
minds me not to camp under them. Ever.
So. why is this happening? A large camp, in
cluding Australian. California!! and Chinese
news reports, believes it's climate change-relat
ed.and that may be. It's not really scientifically
sound to blame climate change for individual
events, hut on a trend level, these extreme
events are consistent with what climate science
predicts. Whatever you believe, the fact is that
freshwater isa limited resource that isn't always
where we want it to be.
Anyway. Droughts suck, and we're in one.

to talk about water and climate and oil (oh
my!),and I have a huge crush on ('alifornia.l'm
