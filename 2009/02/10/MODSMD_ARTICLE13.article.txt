# The 						Dude Abides
## Zack Warma "Sometimes There's A Man...'' 
### 
££ a way out west there was a fella, fella
/\ I want to tell you about..." And
Sam Elliot's warbling voice
opens one of the more absurd films of this
past century.
From this cinematic classic — the Coen
brothers' seminal "The Big Lebowski"
docs this little slice of journalistic cancer draw
both its title and a healthy amount of inspira
tion. In the parlance of our times, duderinoes.
welcome to "The Dude Abides," your weekly
fill of semi-coherent glimmers of sanity, wit
and schadenfreude. Do not fret if you are not
acquainted with the term; it sounds German,
so clearly there is some strong connection to
human suffering.That, and Otto Von Bismar
ck. Aw. look at me, I'm rambling again ...
Dear reader, please allow me to introduce
myself: I'm a man of neither wealth nor taste
(at least not on par with Mick Jagger or
Patrick Cordova, that is), but my name is
Zack Warma. and I am an Oh-leven history
major from San Diego. That's right — an in
sufferably proud Southern California!! has
been allowed 6(H) to 8(H) words every week to
put down mildly deformed, intellectually
stunted Northern Californians (see Kevin
Webb) and any residents of the following
states: Oklahoma. Arkansas. Nebraska.
Kansas. lowa. Indiana. Mississippi, either of
the Dakotas. Alabama, Arizona, and West
Virginia, among others. Quake in fear Stan
ford, quake in fear.
An important distinction needs to be
made, however. Just because I extol the glo
ries of the southern part of the Golden State
does not mean that I am in any way a fan ol

that industrial wasteland commonly referred
to as the City of Angels, or Los Angeles. Just a
brief geographic fun fact: Southern California
actually extends beyond L.A., thankfully.
And let me add that anyone who has a
soul/has spent several hours on the 405 going
zero miles per hour and watched one nonde
script suburb melt into another knows what in
the good Lord's name I am talking about.
Back to "Lebowski" though: L.A. merits
only so much derision in this inaugural col
umn.The film, which should be viewed a min
imum of four to five times with either a Cau
casian 0r... Creedence tape in hand, it ain't
exactly your standard fare; rather it's a
strange muse for the thoughts and schemes ol
a feller like me. I will be \crv honest with you,
reader, in that I possess several qualities that
make me rather un-Dude. A bit of an overly
opinionated chap with a penchant for sharing
my thoughts with the world, as Jeff I .ebowski
could very well say to me."you're not wrong;
you're just an asshole."
So then, why — you must assuredly be
thinking — would you name your column
"The Dude Abides." unless you were unduly
trying to assert some sort of cultural self
righteousness? Given that you aren't actually
asking me questions.oh hypothetical reader. I
am going to choose to ignore your inquiries.
But to the point at hand: Though there are
many lessons to be taken from "Lebowski."
namely, nihilists are in fact f*@ A king ama
teurs, the one that stands out for me the most
is this: We humans are rather absurd creatures
who. in attempting to exert control over our
lives, have a tendency to inflame and enlarge

our problems to extraordinary levels. For
those unenviable souls who have not yet
learned the joy of"Lebowski." I cannot do the
film justice in this column, but what 1 will say
is that the movie, which covers the rumblings
and venturing of the Dude across Southern
California, captures the sublime foolishness
of the human comedy, of man's utmost inabil
ity to make sense of the world around them.
1 don't know nor care to comment on your
level of perception about the goings- on at the
Stan, but it has become rather evident to me
that this incredible institution that we call
home for four years or so is rather ridiculous,
in ways both ghastly and hilarious. It seems
only fitting that a little Dude-ness gets chan
neled when describing this far-out place.
Everything from the inherent beauty of hole
in-the-wall taco shops to the intellectual stag
nation perpetuated by inefficient decentral
ized bureaucracy will be brought up and
bandied about in this column, because I got
this sense that the Dude would in fact abide.
And you might be thinking. "That's just,
like, your opinion man." And it may very well
be. But in these dire and pressing times that
our world is facing, there needs to be some
one who can draw strange parallels between
unchecked aggression and the tyranny of
Risk Management, between "lines in the
sand" and Sand Hill Road. I think I can be
that man. And in the words of that rustic nar
rator, "Sometimes there's a man ... well,
sometimes there's a man."

To find out if in fact, he is "calmer than you are,"
