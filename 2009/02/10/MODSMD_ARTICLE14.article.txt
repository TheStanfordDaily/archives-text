### CHRISTIAN L. TOM KENAN JIANG STAFF WRITERS 
The No. 2 men's swim team won
both their dual meets over the rainy
weekend at Avery Aquatic Center.
Stanford defeated C'al State-Bakers
field 142-97 on Friday— winning
every event along the way — and
dominating Southern California on
Saturday, 213-86. The Trojans were
only able to secure two of 14 event ti
tles in a blowout loss.
Stanford remains undefeated and
is 7-0 overall, including a 4-0 record in
the Pacific-10 Conference. The USC
meet was the last home competition
for the senior swimmers, as I hey face
Berkeley across the Bay on Feb. 21.
while the divers take on Brigham
Young Feb. 13. Leading up to the Cal
meet, the swimmers will continue to
ramp up the intensity in training.
Most of the squad will taper for the
Pac-10 meet March 4-7.
Against Bakersfield. Stanford
started off the meet with a win in the
200-yard medley relay. Stanford's dis
tance squad continued its impressive
season in the first individual event of
the night, as freshman Chad La
Tourette won the 10(H) freestvle in
9:12.57.
In the 200 free, Stanford swimmers
won the top nine places and Bakers
field was completely out-matched. In
the KM) backstroke, freshman Geof
frey Cheah edged out Roadrunner
Lika Leskur to win the closest race of
the day. Cheah finished in 51.69 to
Leskur's 51.72.
In the 1 (K) breaststroke. sopho
more John Criste took first in a time
of 56.24, while freshman Bobby Bol
lier paced the field in the longer but
terfly distance — he finished the 200-
yard race at 1:48.80. Senior Jason
Dunford then went on to win the 50
free in a very fast 20.17. while Staab
followed up with a first-place finish in
the 100 free at 45.58. Cass captured
the 2(X) back in 1:51.25, and senior
Paul Zaich took the 200 breast in

2:05.47.
Stanford squared off against USC
on Saturday afternoon, and the Car
dinal men stepped up in many close
races — its only losses came against
USC All-Americans Vanni Mangoni
in the 200 1M and Hungarian
Olympian Zoltan Povazsay in the 500
free. Stanford had already secured a
victory by the time USC managed its
first event win in the 500 free.
Hie meet started off with the 400
medley relay, and Stanford's Godsoe,
Criste. Staab and Jason Dunford won
the event in 3:13.95 — an NCAA"B"
standard. NCAA "A" qualifiers are
guaranteed an automatic berth at
NCAA Championships, while the
other available spots at the Champi
onships are filled up with "B" quali
fiers. "A" standards have been signifi
cantly lowered by the NCAA com
mittee this year due to improving
technology and new suit designs.
"It was an exciting meet." Jason
Dunford said. "Lots of guys really
stepped up and as a result, we saw
some good times."
Morrison again finished with a win
in an exciting 200 freestyle race, com
ing from behind to win with a 1:38.63.
USC's Povazsay led for most of the
race, but couldn't hold off a surging
Morrison and had to settle for second.
Senior captain Paul Kornfeld won
the 100 breast in another exciting race
where he out-touched Criste by a split
second. Criste led for most of the race,
but Kornfeld's strong second half cat
apulted him to victory, taking the race
in 55.28 to Criste's 55.35. Stanford
took the top four spots in the event
and took and took a commanding
lead over the Trojans.
Jason Dunford won two individual
events — the 100 free and 100 fly —
beating younger brother David and
sophomore Alex Coville in the
freestyle race. In the 1650 free. La
Tourette dominated in 15:24.95 and
led the Cardinal to another event
sweep. Bollier, Coville, and Criste
were other individual event winners.
"It was a good weekend: we got up
and raced well against Bakersfield
and especially against USC." Cass
said."lt was a fun last home meet for
me, and it was really cool for the
younger guys to challenge the seniors
and help us win. It was a special at
mosphere on deck."
"We don't want to lose sight of the
end goal," Jason Dunford added. "It
is a fine balance between not putting
too much pressure on ourselves, and
not getting too complacent. There is
lots of other fast swimming going on
around the country."
