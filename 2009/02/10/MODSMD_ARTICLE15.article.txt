### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
Back from a hustling winter full of training, the
No. 6 Stanford men's golf team opened the spring
season with a fourth-place finish at the UH-Hilo
Open in Hawaii.The Cardinal edged out the Uni
versity of Oregon (fifth) and the University of Col
orado (sixth). and generally put on a good show as
the returning champs from last year.
No. 1 Southern California, one of Stanford's
toughest rivals, took the UH-Hilo tournament
crown with an overall 851, 13 under par. The Tro
jans finished a full 11 strokes ahead of No. 5 Wash
ington— who finished in second place — and a
full Istrokes ahead of No. 17Texas Christian Uni
versity in third.
"112 irst off. no one likes to get beat by IJSC." said
Stanford head coach Conrad Ray. "I keep telling
the guys to look at the big picture. If you look at
our results, we didn't perform as well as we nor
mally do and [junior Joseph] Bramlett was not in
there to help us out this time.Though we had some
ups and downs. I think we had a pretty good week
all things considered."
No. 35 sophomore Steve Zieglcr led the Cardi
nal this week, posting an overall three under par
that earned him a piece of seventh place. He
proved to be a model of consistency for the team,
posting a score of 71 (one under par) for all three
rounds and staying well within the top 10 on the in
dividual leader board for the entire tournament.
