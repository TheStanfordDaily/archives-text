## Cardinal captures fourth place Stanford falls to USC, UW, failing to repeat in Hawaii 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
Back from a hustling winter full of training, the
No. 6 Stanford men's golf team opened the spring
season with a fourth-place finish at the UH-Hilo
Open in Hawaii.The Cardinal edged out the Uni
versity of Oregon (fifth) and the University of Col
orado (sixth). and generally put on a good show as
the returning champs from last year.
No. 1 Southern California, one of Stanford's
toughest rivals, took the UH-Hilo tournament
crown with an overall 851, 13 under par. The Tro
jans finished a full 11 strokes ahead of No. 5 Wash
ington— who finished in second place — and a
full Istrokes ahead of No. 17Texas Christian Uni
versity in third.
"112 irst off. no one likes to get beat by IJSC." said
Stanford head coach Conrad Ray. "I keep telling
the guys to look at the big picture. If you look at
our results, we didn't perform as well as we nor
mally do and [junior Joseph] Bramlett was not in
there to help us out this time.Though we had some
ups and downs. I think we had a pretty good week
all things considered."
No. 35 sophomore Steve Zieglcr led the Cardi
nal this week, posting an overall three under par
that earned him a piece of seventh place. He
proved to be a model of consistency for the team,
posting a score of 71 (one under par) for all three
rounds and staying well within the top 10 on the in
dividual leader board for the entire tournament.
"Steve has been knocking on the
door at every tournament this
year." Ray said. "His nemesis is
making a ton of errors throughout a
tournament, but this year he has
been overcoming this by playing re
ally solidly. He deserves credit for
his hard work in the offseason."
Just behind Ziegler was fresh
man David Chung, who finished the
tournament on a good note with a
two-over 218 for the week. Chung's
strongest round came at the end of
the Open when he fired a three
under 69 to help keep the Cardinal
in the top five. This is the second
time he has tied for 15th this year,
tying his personal best finish in a
tournament.
Sophomore Sihwan Kim posted
a six-over 222 overall to place him
in a tie for 30th. Kim had a rough
start and finish to the tournament,
but redeemed himself in the second
round by shooting a one-under 71.
Seniors Dodge Kemmer and

Daniel Lim struggled to find their
groove this tournament. Kemmer
finished in a tie for 43rd with an
overall score of 225, while Lim
came out with a 228. The Car
dinal was excited to hit the links and
play some serious golf after its sea
sonal hiatus from competitive tour
naments.
"It was nice to go over to Hawaii
to get the spring season going," Ray
said. "We are really motivated to
kick it into gear for spring and see
where it takes us."
Stanford is on the right track —
the team is now five for five in top
-10 finishes in tournaments this year.
Stanford has a history of building
upon its momentum and riding it all
the way to the NCAA Champi
onships in June.
Despite its current success, the
Cardinal will have its work cut out
for it in two weeks when the team
heads down to USC. The Stanford
men will face off with some of the
top teams in the nation at the
USC/Ashworth Collegiate Invita
tional on Feb. 23 and 24.
