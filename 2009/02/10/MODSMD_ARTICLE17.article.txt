# One big loss, but three wins
## Card unable to take tourney title, still able to find success 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS 
With three-time All American and reigning
Stanford scoring leader Lauren Silver out due
to injury, the women's water polo team had to
look to other players for offense at the Stanford
Invitational this past weekend. The answer
came in unusual forms.as 11 different players
including four true freshmen — scored to lead
Stanford to a third-place finish.
After falling to No. I Southern California in
Saturday's competition, the No. 2 Cardinal
knocked off No. 7 Arizona State 15-14 early
Sunday morning to advance to the third-place
game later that afternoon. Stanford overcame
the fatigue from a long day of competition, win
ning handily over No. 3 UCLA by a final score
of 10-5. Top-ranked IJSC won the Invitational,
defeating Hawaii 11-3 in the championship
game.
Stanford jumped out to an early lead against
lICI.A and never looked back. Phe Cardinal led
6-3 at halftime and held the Bruins to only two
goals in the second half to cement the victory.
Offensively. Stanford used the same strategy it
employed all weekend: spread the ball around.
Six Cardinal players got into the mix, including
a hat trick by junior Kelly Eaton — her second
in three days — and two goals each by freshman
Melissa Seidemann and junior Jessica Steffens.
"We have a lot of talented offensive players,
so I think we'll always have good scoring distri
bution," head coach John Tanner said.
The storv was much the same in the ASH
