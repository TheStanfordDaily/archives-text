# One big loss, but three wins
## Card unable to take tourney title, still able to find success 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS 
With three-time All American and reigning
Stanford scoring leader Lauren Silver out due
to injury, the women's water polo team had to
look to other players for offense at the Stanford
Invitational this past weekend. The answer
came in unusual forms.as 11 different players
including four true freshmen — scored to lead
Stanford to a third-place finish.
After falling to No. I Southern California in
Saturday's competition, the No. 2 Cardinal
knocked off No. 7 Arizona State 15-14 early
Sunday morning to advance to the third-place
game later that afternoon. Stanford overcame
the fatigue from a long day of competition, win
ning handily over No. 3 UCLA by a final score
of 10-5. Top-ranked IJSC won the Invitational,
defeating Hawaii 11-3 in the championship
game.
Stanford jumped out to an early lead against
lICI.A and never looked back. Phe Cardinal led
6-3 at halftime and held the Bruins to only two
goals in the second half to cement the victory.
Offensively. Stanford used the same strategy it
employed all weekend: spread the ball around.
Six Cardinal players got into the mix, including
a hat trick by junior Kelly Eaton — her second
in three days — and two goals each by freshman
Melissa Seidemann and junior Jessica Steffens.
"We have a lot of talented offensive players,
so I think we'll always have good scoring distri
bution," head coach John Tanner said.
The storv was much the same in the ASH

The No. 2 Cardinal lost to No. 1 Southern California, but was otherwise successful
at the Stanford Invitational, knocking off ranked squads such as No. 7 Arizona State
and No. 3 UCLA to capture third place behind the Women of Troy and Hawaii.
match. Freshmen Cassie Churnside
and Seidemann paced the way for
Stanford, combining for five goals
in a match that saw 10 Stanford
players score.
"As has been the case the last
few years, our freshmen group ar
rived with lofty goals and a desire
to contribute right away," Tanner
said. "It was nice to see five of them
play a lot and look so engaged and
prepared for this level of play."
With both Stanford and USC
making quick work of their final op
ponents on Sunday. Saturday's
match-up between the top two
teams in the nation was in essence
the championship game of the tour
nament.
Against the Trojans, the Cardinal
was in control for most of the match.
Stanford out-shot the Trojans, con
stantly pressuring USC's defense.
On the defensive side of the ball,
Stanford — anchored by Seide
mann and senior Heather West —
rarely allowed USC an open shot
and forced turnover after turnover.
Yet the Trojans kept hanging
around.capitalizing on a few Cardi
nal mistakes and exclusions, and
Stanford could not put the game
out of reach.
"We wasted a few good opportu
nities to go up by two goals late in
the DSC game, which gave them
the chance to tie us and get the
game into overtime,"Tanner said.
Riding their momentum, the
Trojans dominated the two over
time periods. USC finished with a
12-10 win. handing Stanford its first
loss of the season.

If nothing else, the Invitational
showcased the emergence of Seide
mann.The Walnut Creek-native an
nounced her arrival into the colle
giate arena with authority, ham
mering away at defenders on one
side of the pool and denying would
be scorers on the other.
With her six-foot frame, Seide
mann creates mismatches versus al
most any opponent. On day one of
the Inviiational, Seidemann scored
four goals in Stanford's 11 -2 thrash
ing of Indiana. She finished with 10
tallies for the weekend.
"I felt my offensive game was
very strong during the weekend."
Seidemann said. "We communicat
ed well as a team and were able to
get off some good shots."
Given her youth. Seidemann
will only keep improving. Even
with only six collegiate games
under her belt. Seidemann carries
herself like a veteran — in and out
of the pool.
"Melissa typifies the freshman
class in that she is poised and fear
less." Tanner said. "She seemed to
get better between Friday and Sun
day."
Seidemann realizes that she still
has work to do to become a truly
dominant force in the pool.
"It's been a big transition from
high school to college, but coach
Tanner has done a great job helping
me out." she said. "I just need to
keep working on my defense and
mobility." Seidemann and
the Cardinal look to continue im
proving and keep their hot streak
going when they play a Valentine's
Day doubleheader against Sonoma
State and UC-Santa Cruz, at home
in Avery Aquatic Center.
