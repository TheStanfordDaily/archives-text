I promise not to make this a habit.
Last week. I criticized sports
writers for their rush to declare
Super Bowl XLIII the greatest
thing since Velcro. Now, given the ac
tions of a certain third baseman for a
certain New York baseball team. I
find myself penning a column about
the wonderful overseers of our na
tional pastime.
Since the shocking (It's damn
near debilitating, I tell you!) revela
tion that Alex Rodriguez (Gasp! Not
the boy wonder!) took steroids
(Nooooo!!!) five years ago. the col
lective sports media has put on a per
formance that would make the cast
of "One Flew Over the Cuckoos
Nest" blush.
Both Tim Brown and Jayson
Stark all but declared the game irrev
ocably tainted, with A-Rod's admis
sion being the final straw that broke
a horse's'roided back.Ted Keith has
already written the postmortem on
the 2009 season — Rodrigue/ has
spoiled it. And more writers than I
have a description for — "plethora"
doesn't cut it — have declared two
things: A-Rod's legacy is forever tar
nished. and his I (all of Fame chances
are essentially naught.
Yes. folks, it's 2009.and the steroid
era — one of hypocrisy and lies, false
memories and inaction — lives on.
But I'm not talking about the ath
letes. the juicers. Nay, I'm looking at
your dear sports writers. Because
after listening to your holier-than
thou parables and analyses for the
entirety of my teenage years, I've had
enough.
Look in the mirror, sirs and
madams, and ask yourselves: Where
were you when the problem started?
Where were you during the mid-'9os.
when steroids raged and homeruns
flew?
I'll give you the answer: You were
nowhere to be found.
Let's put aside the obvious -
that performance-enhancing drugs,
in one form or another, have been a
prominent part of the sport since the
early 19605. and likely beforehand.
Let's look at 1991. when Fay Vincent
the consummate professional,
and a commissioner that the MLB
only wishes it had today — declared
"controlled substances" illegal. At
the time, steroids — the next step up
on the drug chain — were si ill a for
eign idea. But they rose to promi
nence in Big League clubhouses at
around the same time that baseball
was headed toward the 1994 strike
over the sport's finances. Even after
the game returned in 1995, fan inter
est was still at a low. Baseball needed
a lifeboat, and it found one in the
1998 homerun race.
Sammy Sosa and Mark McG
wire's pursuit of Roger Maris' single
season homerun record brought fans
hack to the sport in droves. These
m ode r n - d ay t i t a n s, t he se I a rge r-1 h a n
life sluggers, were the perfect vehicle
to return baseball to prominence
as long as they kept hitting, they'd be
adored by fans and the media alike.
Sports writers needed baseball to
succeed as much as the league did
the possibility of becoming a second
tier sport was simply unacceptable
and so they followed in lockstep,
and even after seeing androstene
dione in McGwire's locker, were re
luctant to ask the hard questions.
Time passed, and with baseball
solidly back in good standing with
the public, people (finally) began
questioning. How exactly did Sosa
and McGwire develop such out
standing power? And don't they look
a little too big? I"he sky fell when
McGwire was asked to testify before
Congress in 2005 about steroids in
baseball, and he gave his now infa
mous response:"l'm not here to talk
about the past."
Immediately, the same people
who couldn't praise him enough just
years before began to turn their
backs on him. And McGwire was
only the beginning — then came
Barry Bonds, Jason Giambi, the
Mitchell Report and soon.
Along the way. writers have per
petuated their meme: How did this
happen?
Gee. I wonder. All sarcasm aside.
