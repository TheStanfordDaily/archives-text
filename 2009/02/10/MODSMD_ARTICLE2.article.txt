## Eco-carnival touts sustainable living Event raises awareness of recyclable cups, carbon footprints 
### KATHERINE JEWETT 
Students for Sustainable Stanford hosted their
annual "Focus the Nation" event on Friday to pro
mote climate change action on campus. The sounds
of Bob Marley, organic snacks and plenty of recycla
ble cups filled Old Union as students thought about
w hat they can do to combat climate change.
The event featured student groups such as the
Green Living Council, Engineers for a Sustainable

World and Energy Crossroads
with live performances by
STAMP, Kuumba and Calypso.
Climateers. a subgroup of
Students for Sustainable Stanford
led by Dani Uribe '11 and Sasha
Engelmann '11, organized the
event in an effort to advocate for
sustainable action on campus and
reducing Stanford's carbon foot-

print. Uribe noted that she was pleased with the
turnout at the event.
"This event is all about raising awareness," Uribe
said. "(It is about] how to get involved, and what you
can do on an individual level."
While last year's Focus the Nation offered a confer
ence-based panel on climate change, this year's event
was an "eco-carnival" of sorts â€” students could visit
the local and organic food stand, decorate a hemp bag
or calculate their carbon footprint while learning about
different options for student involvement on campus.
Engelmann explained that they changed the pres
entation of the event in order to encourage more stu
dents to attend.
"People that [went to those] panels were likely
people that knew a lot about it already," she said. "So.
fthey] weren't really effective in changing their
thinking that much."
Uribe explained that one of the major challenges
Climateers faces is engaging a student body that is
always so busy. To partially address this issue.
Climateers launched the Green Bead Campaign last
year. Students can calculate their carbon footprint, find
ways to reduce it and make a pledge for individual
change in exchange for a green bead bracelet. This
green bead, tied around the wrist, serves as a constant
reminder of how little commitments, collectively, can
make a big difference.
Students pledged to take shorter showers, turn off
lights when exiting the room and unplug appliances
when not in use. One rather enthusiastic student even
pledged to walk instead of drive for beer.
Another way Climateers hoped to impact student
behavior was bv encouraging the use of recyclable
party cups offered by the ASSU Green Store. A game
of "juice pong" at Friday's event invited students to
learn about how red party cups, contrary to popular
belief, are not recyclable.
Engelmann explained that while we are on the
cutting edge of climate change research with
renowned figures like Steve Schneider and Chris
Field, the culture and activities on campus are rela-
