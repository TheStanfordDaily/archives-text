President Barack Obama promoted
his $800 billion stimulus hill to the
American public in a primetime news
conference yesterday, emphasizing the
urgency of the recovery plan in light of
the current economic crisis.
The President's news conference
took place as the Senate approved its
version of the recovery package by a
vote of 61-36. A conference committee
will now meet to merge the Senate's
version of the bill with that of the
House of Representatives, which was
approved Feb. 28.
Institutions of higher learning,
including Stanford, anticipate increased
funding for research, student aid provi

"Funding increases for the National
Institutes of Health, the National
Science Foundation, the Department of
Energy Office of Science and other sci

Stanford and other campuses and labs
across the country," wrote Director of

downturn in the economy," Casaleggio
said.
Federal funding may bring some
relief to financially strapped
Californians. According to Casaleggio,
the state is expected to receive a little
under $10 billion for its Medi-Cal pro
gram. While this funding appears to be
less than the state would hope to pro

state's ailing economy.
"We've got at least a $41 billion
budget deficit, which is the largest of
any state." Casaleggio said. "Our unem
