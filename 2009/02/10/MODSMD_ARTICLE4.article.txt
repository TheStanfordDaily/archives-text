## Colleges, cities and state vie for stimulus dollars 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF- WRITER 
President Barack Obama promoted
his $800 billion stimulus hill to the
American public in a primetime news
conference yesterday, emphasizing the
urgency of the recovery plan in light of
the current economic crisis.
The President's news conference
took place as the Senate approved its
version of the recovery package by a
vote of 61-36. A conference committee
will now meet to merge the Senate's
version of the bill with that of the
House of Representatives, which was
approved Feb. 28.
Institutions of higher learning,
including Stanford, anticipate increased
funding for research, student aid provi
sions and infrastructure upgrades.
"Funding increases for the National
Institutes of Health, the National
Science Foundation, the Department of
Energy Office of Science and other sci
ence agencies will go to support
research, educational opportunities and
science infrastructure upgrades at
Stanford and other campuses and labs
across the country," wrote Director of
Federal Relations Ryan Adesnik in an
email to The Daily.
Adesnik also added that these funds
would be awarded on a competitive
basis, with consideration for institutions
with the best peer reviews.
California stands to benefit from
federal aid once the bill becomes law.
especially in the domains of health care
and infrastructure.
But Garin Casaleggio. a spokesman

for California's Office of the State
Controller, stated that discrepancies
between the House and Senate versions
of the stimulus bill make it difficult to
judge how much California will gain
from the plan.
"Since it's not finalized, the only
thing that we can really talk about is a
hypothetical benefit." Casaleggio said.
"I think that the main area of focus that
California stands to benefit is definitely
in an increase in Medicaid funds."
Casaleggio noted that a rise in unem
ployment consequently spurred an
enrollment increase in California's
Medicaid program. Medi-Cal, because
of lost health insurance, which makes
stimulus relief all the more urgent.
"[lncreased medical funding] is
extremely essential as services .. .
become more in demand during this
downturn in the economy," Casaleggio
said.
Federal funding may bring some
relief to financially strapped
Californians. According to Casaleggio,
the state is expected to receive a little
under $10 billion for its Medi-Cal pro
gram. While this funding appears to be
less than the state would hope to pro
cure. it does inject money into the
state's ailing economy.
"We've got at least a $41 billion
budget deficit, which is the largest of
any state." Casaleggio said. "Our unem
ployment rate hit 9.3 percent. In 2008,1
think, we lost over 250.000 jobs. Any bit
of money helps. $10 billion helps."
While healthcare funding plays an
important role, communities across
the state also plan to apply federal
funding to a variety of infrastruc
ture projects.
Menlo Park City Manager Glen
Rojas elaborated on the projects
that his city hopes to enact if it
receives the necessary federal aid.
"There were five proposals
[that] the city submitted," Rojas
said. "Any of the projects that are
funded would create some jobs."
These requests include street
resurfacing throughout the city, the
creation of a solar hot water heat
ing system at Belle Haven Pool, the
construction of a migratory chan
nel for steelhead trout in San
Francisquito Creek and the instal
lation of a solar photovoltaic sys
tem. Menlo Park also hopes to
improve an existing bicycle and
pedestrian underpass at Willow
Road and Highway 84.
"In terms of how the city is
doing financially, 1 think we're
doing better than the average city

in California," Rojas asserted. "The
city made reductions in expenses
over the past few years, so that real
ly put us in a good position, that the
downturn won't he felt as for most
other cities in California."
Similarly, the city of Berkeley
plans to apply federal funding to
several infrastructure projects in
order to stimulate the local econo
my. Should Berkeley receive the
funding it requested, the money
might he used to improve the city's
Zero Waste Facility, the Veterans'
Memorial Building and Old City
Hall.
"It's really hard to determine
the impacts of the stimulus package

since it is a moving target," wrote
Berkeley Chief of Staff Julie Sinai
in an email to The Daily. "The
Senate version is very different
than the House version."
