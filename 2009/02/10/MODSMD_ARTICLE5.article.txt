## Prof. contributes to Google Ocean 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
Internet users wowed by the newly
released Google Earth 5.0. which includes a
Google Ocean component featuring an
interactive, three-dimensional ocean, owe a
debt of gratitude to Stanford biology profes
sor Barbara Block.
Block headed a team of researchers from
throughout the country that collaborated
with Google for over a year on the Google
Ocean software. Included on the team was
I)r. Randy Kochevar, also from Stanford.
Specifically, Block and her team worked on
an animal-tracking layer called GTOPP
((Jlobal Tagging of Pelagic Predators), which
compiled animal tracking data for the new
Google Earth release.
"We've created a special animal tracking
layer which, once developed fully, will allow
you to go and potentially see the track a blue
whale or a leatherback sea turtle, for
instance, took as it crosses the ocean," Block
said.
The program allows users to track the

large-scale migration of marine animals —
tunas, sharks, whales and seals, among others
— and even includes special animations that
provide an "animal's eye view" of the open
ocean seascape, giving users the impression
they are swimming alongside the animals.
Google Ocean is currently available
online in its beta version and programmers
expect to add much more data to the pro
gram in the future. In particular. Google
hopes to incorporate high-resolution photos
of select areas of the ocean tloor so that users
can "explore the ocean" in more detail.
Block, who currently works at Stanford's
Hopkins Marine Station, has been tagging
and tracking open-ocean animals for over a
decade. In addition, she heads a program in
the Atlantic Ocean called TAG-A-Giant.
which has placed over a thousand electronic
tags on Atlantic bluefin tuna. In 19%, Block
received ;i Mac Arthur "Genius" Grant for
her work in marine biology.
She views this recent collaboration with
Google as an important and promising
achievement.
"Google Earth provides a powerful, intu-

itive interface for exploring the kinds of data
these animals produce from electronic tags"
Block said in a press release. "Tliis allows
users — from scientists to school kids —to
quickly view and interact with animal tracks.
It's an important evolution in being able to
'see' the largest portion of our planet."
In addition to providing entertainment to
curious everyday Internet users, this research
will potentially contribute to the mainte
nance of stable fish populations, which have
been significantly affected by human overex
ploitation in recent years.
"In order to sustainably manage open
ocean fisheries, we need to provide resource
managers with better information about how
these animals live and how they use the
ocean," Block said. "II we can identify the
kev locations and times where these animals
feed or breed, for example, we can help cre
ate management tools that protect them.
Google has helped our efforts to visuali/e the
deep blue sea. and we now have it at our fin
gertips."
