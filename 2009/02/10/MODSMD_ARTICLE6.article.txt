## Energy initiatives hopeful for stimulus benefits 
### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford is well positioned to receive some
of the estimated $2.6 billion in energy research
spending that President Barack Obama is
including in his proposed economic stimulus
package, according to James Sweeney, director
of the Precourt Institute for Energy Efficiency.
"The newly created Precourt Institute for
Energy Efficiency, the to-be-created Tomkat
Center for Sustainable Energy plus the Global
Climate and Energy Project (GCEP) have cre
ated an infrastructure of faculty, graduate stu
dents, undergraduates and staff, who are inter
ested and capable in the energy and environ
mental areas," Sweeney said.
"Because we have so much interest among
those groups and so much strength, we're at a
very good competitive position for any expan
sion in federal funding in the energy area par
ticularly. but also in the environmental area,"
he added."We will be among the best competi
tors. if not the best competitor."
While the amount of money Stanford could
receive is still up in the air. it could turn out to
be a noteworthy sum based on how the bill
changes as it passes through the Senate.
"It looks like its going to be a significant
amount as part of the stimulus package, but the
stimulus package is still a work in progress."
Sweeney said. "There is still a lot of arguing
back and forth."
Lynn Orr. director of the new Precourt
Institute, agreed that the amount of funding is
undecided.
"It's too early to tell." he wrote in an email
to the Daily. "Any funding that would come to
Stanford would follow based on proposal com
petitions. presumably through the DOE
[Department of Energy!"
For funding to be allocated to research,
proposals for projects must first be accept
ed. creating a very competitive research
environment.
"We have a wide-ranging group of energy
research faculty and any of them would be in a
position to compete," Orr said.
He went on to list the Global Climate and
Energy Project (GCEP), the Precourt
Institute, the Stanford/SLAC Institute for
Materials and Energy Research and the
Program on Energy and Sustainable
Development as specific departments with
projects that may be approved to receive
funding.
"We have significant expertise in material
science, which will be important for batteries
and for solar energy." Sweeney said. "We have
strong systems analysis capabilities that will be
good for understanding how to integrate

renewables into the grid. We have expertise
that merges international knowledge with
energy supply development knowledge. I
believe that international energy policy will be
an element as well as domestic energy policy."
Sweeney also stressed that Stanford has the
potential to lead the field in behavioral sci
ences, which pertain to how we can understand
and promote energy efficiency.
"The one [area] that I'm most interested in
expanding are the behavior issues related to
how we use energy because that's been so
underfunded and so understudied." he stated.
"We have so much capability at Stanford with
in those areas."
Examples of projects within this depart
ment include studies of media influence on
consumer energy efficiency behaviors.
Sweeney specifically cited Chevron's human
energy campaign as a model for study Recent
ads have incorporated images of energy effi
cient products and practices in the hope that
the public will emulate this new image.
Overall, the funding from Obama's stimu
lus package looks to be much higher than past
federal funding.
"Energy research has been up and down
over the years." Orr said, "but what is being
proposed is a significant increase over the
recent past."
"I would not be surprised to see a doubling
or a tripling by the next few years over what
the Bush administration has done in terms ol
funding, but that's only a guess." Sweeney
added. "I would anticipate that there will be.
progressively over the next few years, increas
es fof funding] in the energy area because
that's consistent with Obama's commitment."
However. Sweeney emphasized that long
term funding takes precedence over short
term funding.
"For research, you aren't looking for the
very short-run quality that you get from a stim
ulus package." he said. "You're looking for
longer-term programs and those are things
that Obama, while he was a candidate, com
mitted to increase very sharply."
Obama's administration includes recently
appointed Secretary of Energy Steve Chu, a
former Stanford professor and head of the
