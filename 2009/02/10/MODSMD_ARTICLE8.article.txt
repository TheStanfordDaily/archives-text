## It takes two That girl in four of your classes might be two different people

It's not too common to see twins at
Stanford. But those who did receive
identical acceptance packages in the
mail have found that sharing an under
graduate experience has worked out
surprisingly well.
Andy and Emily Cooper '11 are one
example of twins who are glad they're not
separated.
"It'd be weird not seeing each other for a
long time." Emily said.
Fortunately for the Coopers, they share
many mutual friends and hang out fairly
often. They were even in a draw group
together, and are now living in the same
dorm. Just like home.
"We're not glued at the hip. but it's nice
to see each other," Emily said.
The two also both happen to be engineer
ing majors. Shared DNA. shared classes,
shared problem sets.
"It's nice to always have a study buddy."
Andv said. "In high school, we were doing a
lot of the same things."
Given this fact, it might come as a sur
prise that initially. Andy and Emily didn't
intend to go to college together.
"We thought it might be the time we
would split apart." Andy remembered. "It
turned out Stanford was the best school for
hot h of us."
Emily noted how each twin separately
discovered that Stanford was the right fit. As
for the college application process, Andy
and Emily weren't too concerned about the
possible arrival of one big and one small
envelope, though they seem to have been
the only ones who felt that Way.
"People kept asking, "What if one of you
gets in and one doesn't?'" Andy said.
Fortunately, they're both here, though their
matching admissions decisions didn't come
as a huge surprise. The twins said that they
had heard rumors that schools trv to either

accept or reject both twins in order to
reduce drama in the family.
However, the Office of Undergraduate
Admission reported that it doesn't have an
official policy for twins.
"Each applicant is considered individual
ly." said Shawn Abbott, Director of
Admissions.
Iliis statement seems contradictory to
the experiences of many twins, especially
Gwen and Margot Watson "09.
"We thought we would go to different
colleges," Gwen said. "But we got in to all
the same schools, and got rejected from the
same ones."
Although Gwen and Margot are sharing
their undergraduate experience, the deci
sion-making process wasn't quite as pleas
ant. Dramatic and competitive might be a
more accurate description.
"It was really hard, because we were still
trying to figure out whether or not we want
ed to go to the same school," Margot said.
But they've been able to find their own
niches, even on the same campus.
"We try to separate our lives," Margot
explained. "We have never lived in the same
place, and we have different groups of
friends. We each have a unique experience."
But despite this trend of moving apart, the
two still manage to find quality sibling time.
"They really understand where you're
coming from," Margot said, adding, "It's too
easy to third-wheel someone."
And though both Margot and Gwen
agree that there is comfort in having a fami
ly member on campus, there are certainly
drawbacks.
"There are lots of positives and lots of
negatives," Gwen said. "You have your best
friend on campus, hut you have everyone
making a big deal about you being twins."
There are certainly circumstances in
which it's better not to have someone who
looks exactly like you wandering around a
school of over 6.000 people. But Gwen

noted that mix-ups aren't common, and
mainly occur with people who don't know
them well.
"I've had conversations with people, pre
tending to be you," Margot said to Gwen.
She explains that in many cases, it's easier
just to make small talk rather than launch
into the explanation of having a twin.
Sonali and Meghali Chopra '11 have
found one solution to that problem â€” spend
most of their time together, and people will
inevitably know they're twins. These two
find it easy to be in college together, and
hang out all the time.
"We decided we would make it easier by
living together." Sonali said.
They combined all of their friends from
last year so they could form one large
group, limiting confusion. This manner of
staying together also transfered into their
academic lives.
""We have the same classes," Meghali
said. "We're doing the same major."
Given their twin unity, Sonali and
Meghali's original stance on going to the
same college may come as surprising.
"Initially, we weren't planning on it,"
Meghali said.
But in the end, family is family.
"We realized how much we would miss
each other," Sonali said. "We made the deci
sion together."
Like in much of their lives before
Stanford, twins on campus have to balance
the natural tendency to stay close and the
desire to pave separate paths. But perhaps
it's important to draw a distinction between
being a sibling and being a student.
"We do pretty much everything togeth
er," Sonali said.
"But we like to be considered different
people," Meghali added, finishing her sis
ter's sentence.
