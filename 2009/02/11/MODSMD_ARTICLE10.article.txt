## Editorial A
						response to the State of the Association 
### 
They're nowhere near done, but what a
difference half a year makes. At this
midpoint in the terms of ASSU Presi
dent Jonny Dorsey '09 and Vice President
l agan Harris '09. the editorial board would
like to take the opportunity to commend the
ASSU Executives for the excellent job they
have done in confronting some difficult cam
pus issues and setting a competent.passionate
and inclusive tone.
During Friday's State of the Association
address. Dorsey chose to emphasize what re
mained to be accomplished over what the
ASSU had already achieved, laying out his vi
sion for the ASSU's continued role in partner
ing with students to face the challenges ahead.
Dorsey's address was. by his own admission,
"more of a recruiting speech." and he offered
an impassioned appeal for continued student
involvement in the budget cut process.a rejec
tion of the campus "bystander culture" and a
commitment to "leverage the human capital
in our community, to support those who live,
study and work alongside us."
While the Execs are the first to point out
that their task remains unfinished, the ASSU's
leaders are shaking off its ineffectual image.
Evidence is abundant, from the association's
revamped website, to the more frequent and
better-advertised events to the decent turnout
of 30 or so students to hear Dorsey's self-des
ignated "dorky-ass talk on a Friday night."
This is not to say that the ASSU does not
still suffer from its hallmark inefficiencies and
intra-association bickering. Dorsey acknowl
edged as much when he stated his hope to con
tinue acting more as community organizers
than politicians. Indeed, a number of Dorsey
and I larris' campaign promises remain unful
filled as they have spent their time and ener
gies turning their full attention to the budget
crisis.
Nevertheless, the ASSU has been able to
serve its function as mediator between the ad
ministration and the student body â€” of par
ticular importance during these difficult
rounds of budget cuts. A good case in point is
the recent series of town hall meetings tosolic

it student input on which programs students
consider most important to maintain. The
process culminated in a well-publicized peti
tion to President John Hennessey, Provost
John Etchemendy and several budget officers,
outlining the four major budget priorities sup
ported by the 1.621 signatories.
Assisted by a high-caliber cabinet, the
ASSU Executives have begun living up to
many of their campaign promises. Among the
achievements Dorsey cited Friday are new
table rental methods, a campus calendar and a
Community Collaboration Fund designed to
create a more tightly knit campus community.
What is most striking is the degree to which
the ASSU Executives feel these issues person
ally. Dorsey became visibly choked up de
scribing issues of sexual assault and conversa
tions with Stanford employees who stand to
lose homes and jobs in this continued eco
nomic crisis. Hie pride was evident in his voice
when he mentioned Stanford's "No on Propo
sition X" phone bank, by far the largest in the
state.
Reminding students that "we're talking
about people's lives." it is readily apparent that
Dorsey truly does buy into our Founding
Grant's mission to create leaders for the pub
lic good. Their commitment to going out of
their way to include everyone on campus in
the ASSU's activities is a refreshing departure
from the policies of previous ASSU Execu
tives. and the work that they and the ASSU
have begun to accomplish is impressive and
deserves appropriate recognition.
I.ike Dorsey. the editorial board urges stu
dents to become involved and active in the
ASSU and campus community.
"The ASSU and Stanford are changing."
Dorsey said on Friday. "The way the student
body interacts with the administration and
helps to define the school is changing."
While there is much work to be done, it
seems that this change is slowly unfolding,
much to Dorsey and Harris' credit. The two
are on their way to completing one of the most
effective ASSU Executive terms in recent
memory.
