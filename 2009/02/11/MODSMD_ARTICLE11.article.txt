# The

## David Goldbrenner Take heart, undergraduates

The scary thing about returning to grad
school at age 33 is that you wind up hang
ing out with folks who were being born
while you were sitting in the hallway of your
middle school, listening to your metal-head
friends brag about going to the Skid Row con
cert that night.
Ihere are some advantages, though, in the
form of hard-won knowledge that can only be
gained through a long, sometimes brutal,
sometimes illuminating slog through the real
world.
In the 10 years between college and return
ing to grad school. I have worked in the pits of
a trading floor, run a software startup.slaved in
a cubicle for the world's second-largest soft
ware company, taught math at an urban high
school and watched friends go through similar
journeys and transformations.
I don't pretend to know everything, or even
a lot But I know a few things.and I thought I'd
use my first column or two to share some of
these tidbits with the undergraduates and
younger grad students here at Stanford. After
all. dear reader, you may have the world at
your feet, but unless you're careful, the world
may bite sharply at your ankles.
You find a job
This downturn is bad. I remember the dot
com crash, and this is worse. I had just moved
out to the Bay Area in 2001 to work as a pro
grammer at Oracle, and the whole region was
emptying out as fast as IJ Haul could provide
trucks. My commute on the 101 dropped from
40 minutes to a half hour as traffic thinned out
from winter to summer of that year. Mv rent
dropped 40 percent six months later.
But a funny thing happened — while
pets.com's promise of an online pet food
Utopia did not materialize, the quieter, more
fundamental efficiency gains promised by the
Internet did.'lhe tech sector recovered nicely.
Ihis downtown is deeper and more wide
spread. But first, take some heart in that, ac
cording to a recent article published on
Bloombcrg.com. the unemployment rate for
those with college degrees is 3.8 percent —
half the national average. And don't forget that
our society is still producing knowledge at a
dizzying rate. Biotechnology, nanotech,energy
technology, etc. will all lead to new products
and industries that will continue to drive eco
nomic growth.
As a smart Stanford graduate, you will be
able to find a job —some job at least, until
things get better. It may not be in your ideal
area, or pay as much as you like, but you will
not only survive but also prosper.

All young human beings possess a
"squalor" gene that allows you to exist, happi
ly. on Ramen noodles in an apartment you
share with six other friends and someone's 23-
Toot pet reticulated python. This gene is fully
active through your mid-20s, after which it
slowly goes dormant and is subsumed by the
"nesting" gene, which compels you to buy stuff
at Crate and Barrel.
It's okay that there are no more investment
hanking jobs, because you didn't want one
any way
As an undergrad at a fancy East Coast col
lege, my friends and I used to make fun of a cer
tain type of student. This student was an (al
most always) male, hyper-aggressive and so
cially awkward type who couldn't wait to grad
uate, put on a suit and go work on Wall Street.
The sense I got was that they somehow feel
that working in a high-paying prestige job
would make them cool, and that they would
wind up hanging out at 2 a.m. in New York's
hottest clubs, surrounded by fashion models.
The truth was they wound up at 2 a.m. in
their cubes, surrounded only by each other. In
vestment banking, which I witnessed through
the eyes of several friends (not the suit-tvpes
above, mind you, just misguided), is the most
soul-draining work I have everseen. Eighty-to
hundred-hour weeks, year after year, literally
rob you of your youth.
And yet so many recent college grads get
sucked in. because the recruiting process chan
nels you there. All of my friends left the indus
try after their two-year analyst positions
ended. C )ne is now pursuing her passion in the
movie business: another went to cooking
school.
Now. I'm not saying no one should ever go
into investment banking. And there are cer
tainly good, decent people in the field. II you
really love the work — finance, deal making,
etc. —it may be right for you. And many
bankers pay their dues, and then use their sub
stantial wealth to reinvent themselves.
For example. New Jersey governor John
C'or/ine worked at Goldman for almost 30
years, took the company public, made $400
million and went on to a (presumably fulfill
ing) career in politics. My point is: Know what
you're getting into and choose your career for
the right reasons — because you love it and
want to contribute to the field.
Next week: Some lost souls go to purgatory.
()thers go to law school.
