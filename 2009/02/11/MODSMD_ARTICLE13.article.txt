## The
						uncertainty of hope 
### 
While studying abroad in Chile last
spring, my host father, a jolly former
military officer, told me bluntly that
he wasn't sure the U.S. was ready for a black
president. Not that he minded, he quickly
added (and. for what it's worth. Chile's presi
dent is a woman), but he just didn't think our
country was tolerant enough — a view that
was not uncommon abroad. Yep. we used to
have a fantastic reputation.
From election night to the inauguration,
however, the euphoria greeting Barack
Obama made it seem like America was back
in style abroad and that, domestically, Obama
would be granted a generous honeymoon
from the press and public opinion as he transi
tioned into power. Beyond the celebrations in
parks and homes here, much of the rest of the
world seemed ready to collectively exhale
with the end of the Bush administration. Ex
pectations at home and abroad were set sky
high. Perhaps on both fronts then, some disap
pointment was inevitable. But I wonder how
far the deflation in enthusiasm and expecta
tions will go.
Internationally. Obama was more icon
than candidate — a cause to be joined. My
friends in Uganda, where I worked last sum
mer, were more excited about the presidential
election than I was. "We've started a group
called Ugandans for Obama." said Charles, a
journalist, while I was in his Kampala office in
July. "We want to find a way to contribute to
the campaign. If we give you money, can you
take it back and donate it for us?"
I had to explain that this was just slightly
illegal — even if Al Gore and Hill Clinton
may have gotten away with some Chinese
contributions back in 1996 — but the enthu
siasm \sas still impressive. In what seemed to
be an entirely unrelated incident, an entre
preneurial street salesman had actual
"Ugandans for Obama" T-shirts which he
tried to sell to me at an outdoor cafe. Not
buying one was one of my biggest regrets of

the summer, and the worst pari is. I can't re
member why I didn't. Maybe I can still find
one on eßay.
For weeks after the election, one Ugandan
friend had "Yes they did!" as his status mes
sage on Gmail, and another was truly horri
fied that 1 wasn't going to pony up the airfare
cost and head to D.C. for the inauguration.
Uganda neighbors Kenya, the country of
Barack Obama's father, but the excitement
still seemed like it was about more than the
new President's African heritage — an idea
reinforced by the candidate's popularity in
many other countries from Europe to the
Middle Fast.
One Web site. "The World Wants Obama
Coalition," posted updates on Obama sup
porters from over 30countries,and a bßCpoll
released on Jan. 20 — the day of the inaugura
tion — found that over two-thirds of respon
dents across 17 countries expected U.S. for
eign policy to improve under the new admin
istration.
But back at home.reality has started to sink
in: Obama cannot do everything everyone
wants, and he certainly cannot do it all instant
ly. Cabinet nominees with tax woes and an in
ability to pressure ( ongress to pass a fast stim
ulus plan have started to undermine faith in
the President's leadership abilities, even
though his approval ratings among Republi
cans actually increased during the pre-inaugu
ration transition period.
'The same sentiment is brewing abroad.
Though he wasn't yet president, the near-si
lence ol Obama and his advisors on high in
tensity violence in Ga/a — with more than

1.000 Palestinian civilians killed — under
mined optimism about him in the Arab world,
where the conflict is often viewed as the most
important issue in the Middle Hast. Alaa Al
Aswany. an Egyptian author, wrote in The
New York Times on Saturday that for this rea
son, many of his friends who had stayed up all
night watching election results did not watch
Obama's first interview in office with the Ara
bic news channel AI-Arabiya."They were so
frustrated by Mr. Obama's silence that they
weren't particularly interested in watching
it."he wrote.
Just as Obama is likely to make some re
covery domestically, it is too early to write off
his popularity abroad or his chances for for
eign policy success. I le has. after all. yet to truly
begin any major foreign policy initiatives.The
aura of invincibility, however, is gone.
But there are smaller bright spots. Ihe
election in Iraq went reasonably well.and the
reversal of the Mexico ( itv Policy, which will
once again allow U.S. funding to go to family
planning organizations abroad that perform
or provide information on abortions, has been
well-received abroad, liven in countries like
Uganda, where abortion is heavily frowned
upon and most people arc very religious, the
move was appreciated by those who do not
want U.S. domestic ideological battles im
posed as a moral compass.
Still, the next few months will be crucial. Al
Aswany wrote that in 1-gypt, people still hope
Obama can do great things, and most people
in the U.S. do. too. Pushing the economy to re
covery and fixing healthcare and education
are in the best interests of the country. Rush
Limbaugh's ratings notwithstanding. But for
all of Obama's supporters, hope that he can
succeed has supplanted certainty. It's up to
him to restore the faith.
