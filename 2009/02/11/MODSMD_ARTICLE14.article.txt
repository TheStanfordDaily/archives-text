## Too Big to Fail: Valentine's Day made easy 
### 
Before I get started on this â€” my first
column ofThe Daily's 235 th volume
I'd like to say: Weleome! Yes. my col
umn is differently titled, and ves. I am now
sharing my picture with columnist/hitter
archrival Jenna Reback. Why? Well, we are
sharing (technical term: going splitsies) a col
umn because writing separate columns was
throwing the universe out of balance or some
thing equally drastic-sounding. So. barely a
paragraph in and already we've saved the uni
verse. You're welcome.
Now. on to the col umn. As I am sure you are
aware. Valentine's Day is approaching, much
like old age and killer bees, and unless you
have some sort of time-stopping mutant abili
ty you are powerless to stop it.
Luckily for you. I have decided to draw
from my shockingly narrow range of romantic
experiences to transform this opinions col
umn into a full-fledged advice column.
Gentlemen, the first thing you should do is
pick a girl and stick with her. Nothing turns a
girl on quite like wholehearted devotion, es
pecially if you don't know her yet That way.
she'll feel like she's so perfect you don't even
need to meet her to be in love with her. C heck
out her Facebook profile at least 35 times be
fore talking to her in order to ensure that you
can adjust your musical, moviecal and televi
sional tastes accordingly. WARNING: if you
take this too far and start professing your new
found love for the Spice Girls. "Desperate
Housewives"and "The Notebook'all ;it once,
she might think of you as that friend with the
weird, effeminate tastes. 'I "here is nothing
wrong with this: it just means she will not be
bearing your offspring anytime soon. If you
must, just pick one of her girly interests to
share and throw in some wholesome manly

things like Metallica.'Man vs. Wild" or "Juras
sic Park" to let her know you still have testos
terone pulsing through your man-veins.
So you've chosen a girl. Now what? Hasy.
Ask her out! You will need an excuse to spend
time with her:girls hate it when guys are direct
with what they want. Ask her to coffee to talk
about homework. Uetter yet. see if she wants
to get I raiche with you (you'll win double-en
tendre points). This will make her totally un
clear on what you want from her. which means
you will have gotten close to her without total
ly ruining your chances yet. Score! Kind of.
Now. I know what you are thinking:" Ihis is
all great, Kevin,but what shouldn't Ido while
trying to impress the fairer sex?" A great ques
tion. reader, and fortunately for you. I have
plenty of advice I can share here. I lie first
thing I would try to avoid is using the phrase
"the fairer sex." because there is nothing fair
about a gender that publicly flaunts Natalie
Portman and yet refuses to let me date her.
Secondly, if you decide to compliment a
girl, know what you want to say first. In my
experience.girls react bi/arrelv when you say
stuff like. "Hi Olga. You have very nice ...
ears." Personally. I would love to be told I
have nice ears, so I have no idea what the
problem is.

I have also learned that context is key. You
might he able to dance with ;i random girl ;it ;i
party,hut try the exact same thing when you're
in line at the grocery store, and suddenly it's
harassment. Again. I don't make the rules,
though apparently they do exist.
Now. I know, dear Reader, that there is a
distinct statistical possibility that you are a fe
male. Ilierefore. in the interest of fairness. I
will throw some advice at you as well.
Ladies, the only thing you need to know
about men is that no matter what we might
sav.every one of us holds a soft spot for I egos.
Try out this line sometime:"! Ii jimmy. would
you like to build Lego spacecraft for several
hours and then have wild, shameless inter
course?" Did llmmy say yes? Of course he
did. because llmmy is a man and no real man
would ever, ever pass this up. Throw a piz/a
into the mix, and he will probably propose to
you on the spot.
So there you have it:genuine, tried and true
Valentine's Day advice. I or men seeking men
and women seeking women, you can actually
just switch around the genders and I'm pretty
sure most of what I wrote still holds.
Now. to the readers about to get asked out,
try saying yes. People complain about dating
at Stanford, but there won't be a culture of
dating here unless asking someone out stops
seeming so bi/arre. At worst, you'll have a hi
larious disaster story to share with your
friends:at best.you might start something that
lasts a while.
And that, reader, is why you should be less
scared of Valentine's Day than killer bees.

Share your own romantic rules, dating disasters
and love of I.egos with Kevin at kt\\ ehh(<>stan
