## Negotiations intensify on stimulus plan 
### ANDREW TAYLOR THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
WASHING lON — Negotiators
hoped to seal agreement on President
Barack Obama's economic stimulus
package Wednesday after making
good progress in the first rounds of
closed-door talks.
Obama's negotiating team insisted
on restoring some lost funding for
school construction projects as talks
began Tuesday in hopes of striking a
quick agreement,but by late in the day
it appeared resigned to losing up to
$40 billion in aid to state governments.
Earlier Tuesday, the Senate sailed
to approval of its $,S3cX billion econom
ic stimulus hill, but with only three
moderate Republicans signing on and
then demanding the bill's cost go
down when the final version emerges
from negotiations.
Negotiators were working with a
target of about $X(X) billion for the
final bill, lawmakers said.
"Ihat's in the ballpark." Senate
Finance Committee Chairman Max
Baucus. I) Mont., said of the $X(X) bil
lion figure late Tuesday.
Baucus had s;iid earlier that $35.5
billion to provide a $IS,(XM) homebuy
er tax credit, approved in the Senate
last week, would be cut back. There
was also pressure to reduce a Senate
passed tax break tor new car buyers,
according to Democratic officials.
Within hours ol the 61-37 Senate
vote. White House Chief of Staff

Rahm Emanuel and other top Obama
aides met in the Capitol with
Democratic leaders as well as moder
ate senators from both parties whose
support looms as crucial for any even
tual agreement.
I louse Democratic leaders prom
ised to fight to restore some of $16 bil
lion for school construction cut by the
Senate. I hose funds could create more
than KKI.(KK) jobs, according to Will
Straw, an economist at the liberal
Center for American Progress.
The moderate senators
Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins of
Maine and Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania — are demanding that
the final House-Senate compromise
resemble the Senate measure, which

devotes about 42 percent of its $<S3S
billion in debt-financed costs to tax
cuts, including Obama's signature $500
tax credit for 95 percent of workers,
with $I.(XX) going to couples.
The $K2O billion I louse measure is
about one-third tax cuts.
Collins said last week she won't
vote for any final bill exceeding $<S(X>
billion in spending and tax cuts.
Specter warned that the Senate bill
must stay "virtually intact."
The GOP moderates also want the
final bill to retain a $70 billion Senate
plan to patch the alternative minimum
tax. or AMI. for one year. Ihe provi
sion would make sure 24 million fami
lies won't get socked with unexpected
tax bills during the 2010 filing season.
