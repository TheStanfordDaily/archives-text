## Stanford Store sees sales go up 
### MATTHEW SERNA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Given steep endowment declines and significant
budget cuts to programs across campus, the Stanford
Store has been a bright spot amidst a sea of econom
ic woes.
The Stanford Store, a subsidiary of Stanford
Student Enterprises, sells Stanford merchandise and
feeds its profits back to the ASSU.
"We've had a 20 percent growth from this point
last year." said Bennett Hauser '10. the store's man
ager. "We grew really fast last year, so the fact that
we're 20 percent up is incredible."
I Jauser attributes the store's success to clever and
persistent marketing.
"It's been all about our marketing initiatives," he
said. "If you do a good job during admit weekend,
[prospective freshmen] learn about us. then, come
NSO, they are already familiar with the store. Come
Parents' Weekend, their parents know about us."
As a result of this marketing strategy, llauser
believes the Stanford Store has drastically increased
its presence on campus, particularly to underclass
men.
"We have freshmen and sophomores who know
far more about us than some seniors who may have
never even heard of lis during their freshman year,"
11 a user said. "It's been about bonding with classes as
they come in and making sure there is greater aware
ness."
Online sales in particular have grown drastically.
According to Hauser. a redesigned Web site with a
more official URE (store.stanford.edu) has con
tributed to the store's success.

Si ill. despite growth, the store's sales have not
heen immune to the effects of the recession. Budget
cuts in nearly every department have cost the
Stanford Store business, as many departments have
trimmed their discretionary spending for Stanford
Store products.
"We think [the economy] is impacting our cus
tom products division" Mauser noted. "A lot of
Stanford departments have lost a lot of disposable
income for pens, luggage bags and other things they
would normally give away."
Though Hauser conceded that demand for
Stanford products is shrinking given the current
economy, lie is not worried that the store could start
losing business.
"We'll continue to grow within a shrinking mar
ket. [as long as] we keep taking more business from
the bookstore," Hauser said.
One of the store's largest initiatives so far this
year was last weekend's "Big Sale."
"Last year was the first year we did [the Big Sale],
Winter quarter is usually slow, so last year we had this
idea that, at least for one weekend, we wanted to
raise hype and awareness about our store." Mauser
explained. 'ITie sale was extremely effective last
year, so we figured why not try it again."
But this year, the sale could not escape the poor
state of the economy.
"The sale went very well, but compared to last
year, it wasn't quite as successful." Mauser said.
Mauser hopes to leverage momentum from the
Big Sale to increase sales over Parents' Weekend,
which takes place the last weekend of this month.
