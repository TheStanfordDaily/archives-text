## A 						WELCOME RESPITE Card dominates non-conference foe 
### DENIS GRIFFIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With just eight games remaining in its reg
ular season, the Cardinal men's basketball
team faced its final non-conference opponent
last night at Maples Pavilion. With a tough,
final slate of Pacific-10 Conference competi
tion remaining, Stanford's 85-50 win over Cal
State-Bakersfield served as a triumphant
tune-up for the Cardinal heading down the
season's final stretch.
Stanford (15-7.4-7 Pac-10) shot out of the
gate against Bakersfield (6-18). turning a 10-6
advantage with 15:24 remaining in the first
half into a 19-6. 13-point lead less than two
minutes later. By halftime, Stanford led by 25
a margin that had expanded to 37 points
with just over 13 minutes remaining in the
game.
Bakersfield was unable to close that gap in
the slightest as the Cardinal cruised to an easy.
35-point win. With the victory, the Cardinal
will finish a perfect 11 -0 in its non-conference,
regular-season schedule.
"I thought our guys played really well
today," said Stanford coach Johnny Dawkins.
"1 thought,from start to finish, everyone who
gol in the game made positive contributions. 1
think our leadership really set the tone at the
start of the game.
"We came out and established what we
wanted to do not just offensively, but on the
defensive end." he continued. "I think it car
ried through to the rest of our guys and be
came infectious as everyone else kind of fol
lowed through,and I thought that was a good,
solid effort by our team tonight."
Despite the game's lopsided nature, senior
point guard Mitch Johnson was convinced

GAME NOTESI Afler beating Cal State-Bakersfield 85-50
last night, Stanford returns to Pac-10 play this weekend

performance from the previous Battle of the Bay, when

nal to take away from last night 's victory.
"In the preseason a lot of times, we were
supposed to win some of the same types of
games — we'd get up 20. 25 points and then
get back down to 10 or 12," he said."We real
ly didn't put teams away. And I think in every
single game we've lost in the Pac-10, except
maybe one or two. we've led maybe eight to
12 points and we just gave those leads right
back in all those games. So I hope that one
thing we can take away from this game is that
once you get a lead, to try and build on that
lead and maintain it and not play so helter
skelter."
Senior forward Lawrence Hill led the Car
dinal with 20 points on 8-14 shooting from the
floor in just 25 minutes of play. Hill's frequent
companion at the top of the Cardinal stat
sheet, senior guard Anthony Goods, was held
out, however, as he recovered from flu-like
symptoms that first manifested early yester

Santwon Latunde and center
Cory Brown tied with eight points
on the night to lead the team.
California (18-6,7-4 Pac-10),
however, should pose a much
more substantial obstacle for the
Cardinal. The Bears defeated
Washington 86-71 and Washing

standings, where they are cur

though, despite possessing the
inverse of the Bears' conference
record, upset California the last
time the teams met in a 75-69
thriller at Maples Pavilion on
Jan. 17.
"Similar to today, [we] played
hard for 40 minutes," Hill said of
the win against Cal following last
night's game. "It could've went
either way, and unlike our close
games which we've had ... we
played hard to the last minute
and took over. We have that to
look back on for why we won
against them."
