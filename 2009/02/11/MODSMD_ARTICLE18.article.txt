# Blame MLB, not A-Rod

Mj hope this is the last article writ-
I ten about Alex Rodriguez and
H! steroids, I really do. With the
HI baseball season just around the
corner, I want to read and write about
homeruns and strikeouts, not
steroids.
Iliat being said, with less than a
week until spring training begins, I
have a lew things I need to get off of
my chest regarding steroids in base
hall.
112 irst let me start by saying: I have
your back. A-Rod. If people want to
scrutinize anyone for the steroid era
in baseball, then they should scruti
nize the real offenders: Major League
Baseball and the Flayers' Union.
Major League Baseball allowed
for a generation of abuse to take
place. It consistently turned a blind
eye to the use of performance-en
hancing drugs (PEDs) because the
increase in offense in baseball meant
an increase in revenue for the league.
After the strike in 1994, baseball
was waning in popularity. The NFL
and NBA were far more popular,and
baseball needed something to renew
fan interest.
As my colleague Wyndam
Makowsky alluded to on Monday,
this came in the form of the 1998
homerun chase between Sammy
Sosa and Mark McGwire. It didn't
take a rocket scientist to tell at the
time that these men, along with
countless others throughout the
league, had gotten unnaturally mas
sive in a short amount of time.
Major League Baseball, however,
did not care to look into what sub
stances were allowing these players
to grow because attendance and fan
interest was up around the league.
The Players' Union is equally re
sponsible for so staunchly defending
a practice that is illegal in the United
States to take place without enforce


Daniel
Bohm
ment. It took until 2004 for any drug
testing for PEDs to take place.
This decade or so of free reign al
lowed a culture of abuse to grow
within the league. Rodriguez re
ferred to this in his interview with
ESPN's Peter Gammons on Monday
by saying,"At the time of that culture,
there was no legal and illegal."
That is because Major League
Baseball loved every second of it.
Now. the double standards are Hy
ing all over the place. Players like Ro
driguez, McGwire and Barry Bonds
were everything to baseball at the
turn of the century.and today they are
being accused of ruining the sport.
It is impossible to know how
many players actually took steroids,
but the number is at least in the hun
dreds. It wasn't just hitters either.
Many of these homerun hitters were
doing it against 'roided-out pitchers.
Rodriguez was a career .377 hitter

with two homeruns against pitcher
Roger Clemens, another star accused
of using PEDs.
What I am trying to say is that this
entire era needs to be looked at inde
pendently. It is unfair to judge one
player and not another, because,
frankly, it is impossible to know who
did what.
It is for that reason that it is absurd
that McGwire is not in the Hall of
Fame after appearing three times on
the ballot, lie was the most feared
hitter in the league in the late "90s.
and his alleged use of PEDs was part
of what Rodriguez referred to as a
"tremendous need to keep up."
McGwire (and Sosa) brought
baseball out of a hole, and for some
reason they lose any recognition of
this because Major League Baseball
wants to retroactively punish them
for something it had no interest in en
forcing at the time.
Similarly, the stigmatizing of
Barry Bonds is ludicrous. Bonds
filled stadiums up in the beginning of
this decade, making thousands of
dollars for owners, and all of a sudden
he has this scarlet letter on and no

one will hire him. Who knows if he
will make the Hall of Fame despite
being perhaps the greatest player
who ever lived, steroids or not.
Major League Baseball, the Flay
ers' Union and baseball writers are
all trying to have their cake and eat it
too. All of them need to own up and
admit that this period was their fault
and move on. Stop blaming the play
ers: they just did what you all wanted
them to do.
I will end with a prediction: Alex
Rodriguez is going to have a career
year this season. You heard it here
first. He can't get booed any more
then he already does,so that won't be
different. Plus he has six years of hid
ing a secret off of his shoulders (not
to mention some guy named Mark
Teixiera hitting in front or behind
him). Don't be surprised if the only
bombshells you see coming from A-
Rod this year are from his bat, maybe
50 or 60 times.

Daniel Bohm is proud to write the
third straight column on steroids this
week. Congratulate him at
