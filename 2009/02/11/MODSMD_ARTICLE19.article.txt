hopefully that will continue through In
doors."

Lindsay Burdette led the charge at the
top spot with their elevated plav this sea
son. As the lone ranked doubles duo on
the team. Barte and Burdette have found
their stride on the courts this season, hav
ing yet to drop a doubles set.
" The tournament in Palm Springs was
really important for us." Barte said. "I
think we finally clicked. I.ast year we
were not necessarily on the same page
every day. but this year I feel like we're
definitely on the same page and playing
much better together.'
"The two and three doubles team are
playing well also â€” it's really exciting."
Barte added.
The momentum carried into singles as
Stanford piled up five straight set wins on
the afternoon. At the top of the lineup,
despite dropping a set. Barte prevailed.
Senior Jessica Nguyen bounced back uith
a 6-4.6-3 victory and Burdette won her 6-
1.6-4 decision to round off the top half of
the lineup.
At the bottom half, sophomore Car
olyn McVeigh won 6-3,6-0 at No .4. Con
tinuing the strong play of the underclass
men. freshmen Courtney Clayton and
l.ogan Hansen took their matches in
straight sets. 6-3. 6-1 and 6-2. 6-1. After
pulling a stomach muscle in the Indoor
qualifying matches, freshman Veronica 1 i

especially in her first couple of matches.'
