Seven members of the Stanford men's gymnastics team

and advanced to finals.

redshirt junior Greg Ter-Zakhariants and David Sender
'08 competed in the afternoon preliminaries, while sopho

Tim Cientry competed in the evening session.

in the afternoon session,'Ter-Zakhariantsplaced fourth
on high bar (14.55) and I ladden claimed second place on
rings with a 14.95. Sender took first on rings and vault,
sticking both his dismount landings. Nakamori's parallel
bar routine earned him second place (14.9) and he tied for
third on the floor exercise (14.5). His tloor routine had
clean landings on all his tumbling passes, including his
front layout to front flip with a double full twist.
"I basically used prelims as practice to get all the jitters
out before finals on Saturday," Nakamori said, "but I felt
like 1 was in the /one the entire time and competed very
comfortably."
The Men's Program Committee ranks gymnasts based
on a system that awards points relative to how the men fin
ished on each event.The point totals are then combined at
the end of the second day of competition and the top seven
gymnasts are automatically placed on the team.
Nakamori advanced to the finals on Saturday with the
second-highest total points, with 115, behind 2(X)8 Olympic
team bronze medalist Joseph I fagerty.
In the final competition, all the Stanford athletes once
again placed in the top half of the all-around competitors.
The only exception was Gentry, who did not compete on
pommel horse and therefore was not a contender for the
all-around. Nakamori placed third in the all-around with a
176.1 a combined score from both prelims and finals.
Sender placed 11th with 169.6 points, followed by Ter-Za
khariants who had 169.1 points. Leiberman, I ladden and
Dixon took 16th, 17th and ISth. respectively, with scores of
167.25.166.25 and 165.3.
In the event finals, every Stanford gymnast placed in
the top 10 in at least one event. Sender won still rings with
a combined score of 30.65 and vault with a 32.2. Nakamori
placed third on parallel bars (29.95) as well as in the top 10
on pommel horse, rings and high bar. Buscaglia took
fourth on vault (31.7) while Gentry took seventh (31.45)
