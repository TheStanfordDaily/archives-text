### ANARGHYA VARDHANA STAFF WRITER 
Hie Stanford track and field team sent a small contin
gent of athletes to Albuquerque, N.M. this past weekend
to compete in the New Mexico Classic at the Albu
querque Convention Center.
llie men were led by up-and-coming junior hurdler
J.J. Jackson, who won the men's 60-meter hurdles with a
personal best time of 8.06 seconds. Jackson finished
fourth in the preliminaries with a time of 8.30, only to
come back and win the finals.
"I usually don't have any pre-race rituals or do any
thing special to focus," Jackson said. "But in the finals, I
focused on running my race and not getting caught up
with what the other guys were doing, and ran hard
through the finish"
What will it take to achieve the provisional standard
time of 7.91?
"To get provisional I'll need to run a completely clean
race," Jackson said."For example,in the prelims race this
weekend, I had a good start but a poor finish, and in the
finals, the start was weak, but the finish was strong. If I can
bring it all together in one race, I should be able to run a
7.91 /'
Also faring well for the men was junior Tyrone Mc
(l raw. who finished sixth in the 60-meter dash with a time
of 6.92 seconds, and junior Danny Belch, who finished
11 th in the event with a time of 6.98. Belch also ran the
200 meters.in which he finished 10th with a time of 22.04
seconds.
The women were led by their pole vaulters, junior
Caitlin Hewitt and redshirt freshman Natasha Barthel.
Both posted personal bests in the event, placing first and
second.respectively. 1 lewitt won the event with a vault of
12-11 1/2, followed by Barthel. who finished with a height
of 12-5 1/2.
Senior Tessa Flippin won the high jump with a jump
of 5-5, while another Cardinal, junior Kara Bennett, fin
ished second with a jump of 5-3.
One athlete who did not compete in New Mexico was
team captain senior Myles Bradley, the Stanford record
holder in the men's 60-meter hurdles. Even so. he is look
ing forward to achieving his goals in the upcoming meets
as the team finishes out the indoor season.
"At this point in the season. I'm working on my speed
and form over the hurdles." Bradley said. "I was able to
run a good time early in the season, so the focus is all on
the MPSF and NCAA meets, which are in late February
and mid-March."
Bradley is also trying to qualify for NCAAs in the long
jump. After competing in an event at the IJW Invite two
weeks ago. Bradley is hoping to achieve the qualifying
standard soon.
On the subject of the hurdles. Bradley admits the race
is difficult and requires a high level of skill and concen
tration.
"So much happens in such a short period of time." he
said."ln under eight seconds.an athlete must clear five 42
inch barriers and cover 60 meters â€” there are many op
portunities to hit hurdles or take off too close or too far.
The necessity for precision makes each race a new chal
lenge."
The key to Bradley's success?
"Unfortunately, I don't have any lucky underwear."
he said,"but I do have the same warm-up routine prior to
a race. I start about 90 minutes before race time, and after
jogging,stretching and doing drills. I usually finish just in
time to run."
"I also do the same thing as I get into the blocks right
before a race," he added. "It's more for consistency than
superstition."
This coming weekend, the Cardinal will be split into
three groups attending one of the following meets: the
1 lusky Classic at the University of Washington, the Texas
A&M meet in College Station,TX or the Tyson Invita
tional in Favetteville. Ark.
