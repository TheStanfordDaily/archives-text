### ZOE LEAVITT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
lii dramatic fashion at Burnham
Pavilion last Friday, Stanford
wrestling recovered from a 16-3
deficit to beat Arizona State 20-19.
Though forced to forfeit the heavy
weight class, setting the Cardinal six
points behind before the wrestling
even began. Stanford fought for sev
eral big wins to take the match by one
point.
After winning the heavyweight
class by forfeit. ASU's Anthony Rob
les pinned Stanford sophomore
Austin Ouarlesat 125 pounds to earn
six more points. Sophomore Porfirio
Madrigal then got the Cardinal on
the scoreboard, achieving his 15th
win of the year, but fellow sophomore
( ameron Teitelman lost to widen the
score to 16-3 in favor of the Sun Dev
ils.
"I kind of knew going into it we'd
have our work cut out for us," said
Stanford head coach Jason Borrelli.
"I wasn't too worried [about the
point deficit] at this point, I just told
the guys to worry about themselves
and the match would take care of it
self."
Borrelli's confidence proved to be
well-placed. At 149 pounds, junior
IVler Parker surged with less than 10

seconds remaining to tie the score at
3-3. then scored an escape in over
time to win. His exciting victory
proved a turning point in the match
for Stanford, which then battled the
Sun Devils to narrow the point
deficit.
"[Parker] exemplified everything
we want for our guys." Borrelli said.
"To never stop wrestling ... Iliis re
ally shifted the momentum in the
match; we knew we had a chance to
win."
In the next match, sophomore
Lucas Espericueta dominated ASlJ's
Te Edwards 20-3. Redshirt freshman
Nick Amuchastegui. riding on the
Cardinal surge, defeated Kyle De-
Berry for his 12th consecutive victo
ry. Although freshman Victor Haug
fell at 174 pounds, junior Jake John
son came back for a 5-0 win at IX4
pounds. With only senior Luke Feist's
match to go. Stanford was down hy
two points. 19-17.
With the outcome of the match in
his hands, the team's sole senior did
not let Stanford down. Feist's 5-0 vic
tory earned three points for Stanford,
and the team defeated Arizona State
for the second season in a row.
Throughout the suspenseful
match, personal records brightened
the day. Espericueta achieved the
50th win of his career, reaching a
milestone only three other current
wrestlers (Johnson, Feist and junior
Zack Geisen) have passed.
Amuchastegui's victory tied him
with Espericueta as the fourth-win
ningest freshman in school history.
"This was the first match all year
when the guys seemed really re
laxed," Borrelli commented on the
team's success. "Maybe because we
were losing so much at first, it took
off some of the pressure."
Two days later, however, that
pressure would return. On Sunday,
Stanford traveled to Boise State only
to collapse under the weight of

Boise's winning lineup. ITie No. 11
Broncos — the defending Pacific-10
Conference champions — threw six
top-20 wrestlers at the Cardinal to
dominate 3K-3.
Freshman Matt Sencenbaugh
won the only match of the day for
Stanford, in the day's first match at
125 pounds, lie rallied from behind
to tie the score in the third period,
then got a takedown with only four
seconds left to beat Brian Owen 10-
V. Sencenbaugh's third victory in a
row "was some of the best wrestling
I've seen all year from him." Borrelli
said.
After Sencenbaugh's blaze of
glory, Stanford forfeited the heavy
weight match and lost the remaining
eight straight matches. Boise State's
Tyler Sherfey. whom Amuchastegui
had defeated earlier this season,
came back with a vengeance to shat
ter the Cardinal sophomore's win

ning streak. But Amuchastegui did
not go down easy, holding the score
2-1 until Sherfey scored a two-point
takedown with 20 seconds left to win
3-2. This was the fourth straight dual
meet in which Boise lost no more
than one match.
After dominating Cal Poly 27-16
last season, Stanford will invite the
Mustangs back for more on Sunday
at 1 p.m. in Burnhani Pavilion. This

As the wrestlers look forward to
the Pac-10 Championships, the Cal

weeks will be their last chance to
hone their skills and practice their
technique. Borrelli finds it hard to
look back over the season yet. con

await.
