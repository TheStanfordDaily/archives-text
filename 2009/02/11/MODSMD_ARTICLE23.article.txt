### SARAH OHR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's lacrosse team (1-0) kicked off
its season with a bang this weekend as it outscored the
Lady Ducks of Oregon, 17-5.
After taking a bus to Eugene in order to afford every
member of the team the opportunity to be a part of the
season opener, the Cardinal proved that even an 11 hour
drive could not dampen its energy, much of which
stemmed from a well received change in coaching stall.
The Cardinal is now led by head coach Amy Bokker, for
mer head coach of George Mason. The victory increases
Stanford's all-time record against Oregon to 5-1, with the
only loss coming in 2007.
"I think the victory was especially sweet for the upper
classmen who have mostly frustrating memories of our
season opener against ()regon in 2007." said junior attack
and leading scorer Dana Lindsay."(Jetting the chance to
go back to their field and make a statement about the new
face of Stanford Lacrosse and the kind of team we hope to
be this season was awesome."
Early on. Oregon appeared as though it was going to
put up a tough opener for Stanford. Hie Ducks started
strong, leading the game 4-1 after just eight minutes of
play, but the Cardinal did not waver.The team responded
with an impressive rally of 15 unanswered goals.
"The first fifteen minutes we were not playing our game
as our rhythm and timing were both a bit off," said senior
midfielder and co-captain Bess Siegfried. "I couldn't be
more proud of how we turned things around and took
complete control of the game."
Bokker was also pleased with her team's debut.
"We just needed time tosettlc in,"she said."l ven when
we fell behind, we seemed to control the tempo of the
game. We were never really worried."
Lindsay led the way for the Card with four goals and
two assists, along with junior midfielder I .auren Schmidt,
who tallied three goals and one assist. I indsay's strong
performance earned her the title of Mountain Pacific

Sports Federation's co-Player ofthe Week, which was an
nounced Monday. This is the first MPSF honor awarded
this season and marks Lindsay's first time receiving it dur
ing her collegiate career.
"More than anything, Saturday was a lot of fun," I ,ind
say said. "We've been training, practicing and scrimmag
ing all year, hut none of that compares to game day."
Key defenders for Stanford included senior Maris Perl
man and freshman Paige Farmakis. Farmakis made a
statement in her collegiate debut as she shut down the
Ducks' leading scorer — Oregon senior attack Ilsa van
den Berg did not score a single point for the first time in
21 consecutive games.
Bokker gave credit to the defenders, who held the
Ducks to only two goals during the second half.
"()ur athleticism and depth really worked to our ad
vantage." she said. "C )ur defense really helped to open up
our offense, and that's our game."
A final source of Stanford's success came in the form
of sophomore goalkeeper Annie Read, who had seven
saves in her first collegiate start.
"Annie Read had a fantastic game, especially for her
first collegiate start." Siegfried said of her teammate."She
gave us the extra boost of confidence we needed to find
our flow."
Siegfried also commented on the momentum and
closeness the team has now gained going into the start of
their home season.
"Busing to Oregon was an awesome way for the team
to spend time together before our opening game." she
said. "We are all very excited about the win. but are
ready to get hack to practice in preparation for the next
game."
