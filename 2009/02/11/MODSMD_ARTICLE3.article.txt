## Community Day cut to ease budget Local tradition too expensive in tough tunes 
### JENNY REMPEL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford recently cancelled
Community Day as part of ongoing
budget cuts to handle the recent
decline in the value of the
University's endowment. ITie bi
annual event invites community
members to the campus for family
oriented activities and performances,
and had grown quite popular.
When it was last held in 2007.
Community Day attracted K.(KK) visi
tors to campus for performances and
activities hosted by 40 student
groups. Presentations ranged from
science demonstrations to martial
arts performances to dance produc
tions. Academic departments on
campus also opened their doors to
host tours and highlight their
research.
"I really enjoyed it." said Pin-yi
Ko "09, who volunteered with the
community service group T/.u Chi at
the 2(X)7 event."It was really good to
have the members of the outer com
munity interacting with Stanford stu
dents."
However, since the base cost of
holding Community Day is around
$250,000, the University decided to
cancel this year's event, according to
Elaine Enos, executive director of
Stanford Events. Enos emphasized
that this initial amount does not
include the individual department
and student group expenditures
made across campus.
"I don't see this as the end of
Community Day itself as the campus
has. and always will be. looking for
ways to reach out and invite the sur
rounding communities to visit and
participate in our campus communi
ty." Enos said.
Although Enos had already
begun initial planning for the event,
she said that the I Jniversity made the
decision to cancel it before any funds
had been spent. She expects that res
idents of the neighboring communi
ties who had attended the event in
the past will respect the University's
decision.
"I believe that there is an under
standing and sensitivity by Palo Alto
residents toward saving money and
employees' jobs wherever possible,"
Enos said. "Considering these diffi
cult economic times, to postpone a
Catherine until a later date would
seem prudent and thoughtful."
Stanford students echoed Finos'
opinion, hut urged a continued focus
on keeping Stanford events open to
the public.
"I think the president is facing a
lot of really tough decisions and
they have to look really critically at
the budget." said Allison F ; ink '12.
"They should try to make sure that
maintaining good relationships with
the community is still a priority,
though."
For the most part. Fink thinks
service organizations that have last
ing relationships with neighboring
communities are more meaningful
than one day of activities on campus.
Ko was also sympathetic to
Stanford's reasons for calling off this
year's Community Day.
"I'm disappointed that it's not
happening this year, but I don't feel
incredibly upset about it." she said.
"I'm not devastated. I understand
with budget cuts and whatnot that
some things have to go."
Stanford has hosted five
Community Day events, beginning in
2002. Enos hopes that Stanford will
consider holding another event in

the same style at some point in the
future. For the time being, though,
she is satisfied that Stanford's many
lectures, sporting events, concerts
and art performances provide a good
route for including the University's
neighbors in campus life.

"There continues to he events on
campus where the surrounding com
munity is regularly encouraged and
invited to participate," she said.
