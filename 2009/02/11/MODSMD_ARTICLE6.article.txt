## Protein linked to pancreatic cancer growth Inhibition could create treatment options; early trial underway 
### ZOE RICHARDS 
Researchers at Stanford's School of
Medicine have identified a protein that may
lead to treatments for cancerous pancreatic
tumors.
Amato Giacci, the lead researcher for the
project, said he is hopeful that treatments will
he found for pancreatic cancer patients who
now face tough odds.
"There's really not a lot of very good treat
ments for [pancreatic cancer|." Giaccia said.
"Very few patients really see five years sur
vival. which is different than other solid

tumors. It's very aggressive and very nasty."
Giaccia, a radiation oncology professor and
member of the Stanford Cancer Center, is the
senior author of the research on the new pro
tein. which was published in Cancer Research
on Feb. 1.
For the past four years, Giaccia researched
the role that connective growth tissue factor
(CTGF) plays in pancreatic tumors.
In their most recent study. Giaccia's team
implanted human pancreatic tumor cells into
mouse pancreases and compared the growth of
the control tumor cells with low levels of
CTGF to those with high levels of CTGF.
Iliey found that those with high levels of
the protein grew faster and were more likely to
metastasize. CTGF aids tumor growth by
amassing extra tissue with the cancer, accord
ing to Giaccia.

"It's like fibrosis — it's like for somebody
to put a lot of connective tissue intermixed
with the tumor," he added.
Giaccia's team thought differently than
most about the origins of this unusual and
deadly characteristic of pancreatic tumors.
"We thought that actually there was some
factors that were secreted by this solid tumor
that caused [the connective tissue growth],,"
Giaccia said.
Giaccia's analysis of gene expression
changes led his team to conclude that CTGF
could explain the extreme connective tissue
growth associated with pancreatic tumors, as
well as its aggressive growth phenotype. It is
this protein that may be at the root of tumors'
difficult treatment.
"We're hopeful that if CTGF
plays such an important role with
human pancreatic cancer in experi
mental models that it will have
some effect in humans," Giacci
said.
Khanh Le '11. who works at the
Asian l iver Center and is involved
with outreach about liver cancer's
effects on the Asian community,
noted that this research miuht have

consequences beyond pancreatic
cancer alone.
"A lot of cancers can be traced
back to similar problems and simi
lar causes, so this research may be
useful towards finding better treat
ments for pancreatic cancer and
also to find further insights into the
treatment of other cancers as well,"
he said.
Mediating between the mouse
model and the human patient is dif
ficult for researchers, and Giaccia
explained. "A lot of experimental
mouse work probably overpredicts
for the impact of a treatment and in
large part it's because most of those
experiments are done by injecting

tumor cells underneath the skin of
a mouse." Because mice and
humans are so different, it is unsure
if the protein's efficacy will be the
same in humans.
To find out. Dr. Albert Koong
and his research team have been at
work since November working in a
clinical study that aims to translate
Giaccia's research into a viable
treatment for pancreatic cancer
patients.
The researchers are currently in
Phase One of the trials to deter
mine whether the treatments are
safe for additional testing. Dr.
Koong's clinical research team
works with four patients in a four

week. three-dosage regimen of
Gemzar (a chemotherapeutic stan
dard agent of care ) and [G3019 (an
antibody that targets C'TGF). After
they get a cycle of chemotherapy
patients, they will be able to see if
the tumors respond to the treat
ment.
" I hev're looking for what might
be new and more efficacious for
them." Williams said. "I can't keep
spots on this trial — I fill them up
as soon as one opens up. It's hard
because there're more patients that
probably would participate than
spots available."
