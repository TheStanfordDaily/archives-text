### MARISA LANDICHO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After surviving a final review b\
the Undergraduate Senate last night,
the Wellness Room is on track to open
in Old Union by the end of v\ inter
quarter.The good news was tempered,
though, by a disagreement that had
Senator Luukas lives - () 9 calling for the
dismissal of Nominations Commission
(NomCom) Chair I tic Osbourne.
By a unanimous vote, the Senate
passed a bill to charter the wellness
project, authorizing $6.(XH) in funds
for the first five quarters of the new
program.
Deputy Chair Patrick Cordova W,
who has made advocating for mental
health services a priority, had a few
last-minute critiques of the Wellness
Room, though he approved of the
plan's intentions. Specifically, he found
the three-hour training requirement
for the student wellness coordinator
vastly insufficient.
"I don't feel that it I was a student
on campus who was dealing with sig
nificant emotional problems. I would
feel well with going to a room where
the head student only had three hours
of training." he said.
ASSUVice President l agan Harris
'(W promised to include the changes
recommended in the meeting and
encourage better communication
between the Senators and the ( abinet
members in charge of the Wellness
Rix>m.
But not all disputes were as
smoothly mediated, as tensions flared
following the announcement of
Osbourne's absence.
The seven-member NomCom is
tasked with nominating individuals
for ASSU committees and also dis
seminating committee reports.
Throughout the quarter, some mem
bcrs of the Senate have criticized the
lack of communication from
NomCom. particular!) at the Jan. 27
Senate meeting that Osbourne
attended.
Graduate Student Council ((iSC)
member Ryan Peacock notified the
body of the situation.
"Basically, because of a trend ol
interactions, [Osbourne] and the rest
of his committee have decided not to
directly come and present to the
Senate," he said. "He was pretty put
off by the conversation two weeks ago
to the point that he was just done."
Peacock related that Osbourne
would still meet with the (ISC and
that senators were welcome to talk
with him at the (ISC meetings.
The Senate was partly confused and
partly affronted by the announcement.
"I'm frankly quite disappointed

that [Osbourne] is not here this
evening." Cordova said. "Actually, I'm
quite upset."
Senator lives stated that the
NomCom chair was not performing
his job adequately and that he was no
longer returning emails.
"This kind of an attitude, in my
personal view, would he grounds for
dismissal," he said. "The fact of the
matter on the ground is this, Eric
(Osbourne) and the Nominations
Commission failed at their job until
we started to ask for accountability."
I larris urged "cooler heads to pre
vail" until the two sides could speak in
person at a later date.
Making progress in the budget

advocacy arena, the Senate
announced further plans for the
Student Expert's Consultation
Meeting, where a couple dozen
upperclassmen will he asked to help
the Senate narrow down the four
advocacy principles — academics,
community centers, mental health
and frontline stall — to a more specif
ic list of programs.
Harris cautioned the Senate that
they must be careful in carrying out
the Expert Meeting this lliursday.
"There can't he any favoritism,
elitism or nepotism," he said.
