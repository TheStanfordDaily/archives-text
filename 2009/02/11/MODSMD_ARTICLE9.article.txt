Among those few is Maria Contreras '10.
who lives on campus with her 18-month-old
daughter. Claire. When Contreras returned
to Stanford this fall after taking a year off.
worries about classes and homework took a
backseat to more pressing concerns, like
applying to daycare and finding a nanny.
Contreras recalls the first week of that
quarter being "crazy." She decided to enroll
in the Human Biology core because the lec
tures were posted online, enabling her to
leave in the middle of class if her daughter
had an emergency.
"I wasn't thinking about myself." said
Contreras. who fell behind on homework
until she found a kind neighbor who could
look after her daughter during the day.
There are nine undergraduates with chil
dren living in Student Housing this year, a
number which is "fairly typical." according to
Rodger Whitney, executive director of
Student Housing.
For some of those students, the challenges
of juggling problem sets with bedtime stories
came as no surprise. Kimberly Washington
'11 was expecting a child before she set foot
on the Stanford campus.
"I knew I wasn't passing up the opportu
nity to be a student there, and I also knew
that I was going to have a child." she wrote in
an email to The Daily from her family home,
where she is taking a year off. "It's as simple
as that."
Washington spent her freshman year in
Escondido Village with her son and his
father.
"It is verv nice there." she said."The baby

has his own room, and his father and I have a
space to ourselves as well."
Although she appreciated her apartment
and found Stanford students and faculty to
be very supportive of her situation, the
change of setting was tough.
"There were a lot of people who wanted
to help me and make sure that I was not
struggling to be a parent and a student."' she
said.
"Although, 1 think having the dorm expe
rience would have allowed me an easier tran
sition into college life," Washington added.
According to Whitney, all Stanford stu
dents with children, including graduate and
undergraduate students, live in Escondido
Village. They can apply for apartment hous
ing starting in the second trimester of preg
nancy.
But housing situation aside, becoming a
mother has given Washington some perspec
tive. and led her to reevaluate her academic
goals.
"I am thinking about changing my major
and my career plans." she said. "So. I am not
quite sure what is in store for me after
Stanford."
For some students, a new baby comes as a
surprise. Contreras learned she was pregnant
during winter quarter of her freshman year,
shortly after she had broken up with the
baby's father — a student at another univer
sity whom she had dated for two years. Some
people suggested that she have an abortion
or give her baby up for adoption, but neither
of these options felt right to her.
"I had never anticipated the type of bond
I would have with her. even before she was
born." Contreras said of the relationship with
her daughter. "She felt like such a part of me
the instant I knew she was there."
The other students in Contreras* fresh
man dorm were supportive, but being preg
nant while attending school was still chal
lenging.
"There was a lot emotionally I was going

through." she said.
She also noted many physical changes she
hadn't anticipated, such as sleeping for long
hours.
"Pulling all-nighters during finals was just
not going to happen," Contreras said.
Contreras was five months pregnant when
she finished freshman year. She took a year
off to live with her family in Sacramento and
then returned to classes this fall with Claire
in tow.
On a recent weekday evening, enchiladas
simmered on the stove while Contreras
played with Claire in the living room of their
Escondido Village apartment.
"Apple!" Claire yelled happily, pointing to
a green vase. "Apple! Apple!"
Needless to say. Claire's arrival has
brought a lot of changes. Contreras spends
her time very differently now — doing laun
dry. shopping for groceries and. of course,
playing with Claire.
She wakes up at 7:30 a.m. to change
Claire's diaper, dress her and feed her. In the
evenings, she runs errands before putting her
daughter to bed. She does homework after
Claire falls asleep, or crams il in on the week
ends. when her parents drive down from
Sacramento to stay with her.
Contreras' social life has taken a backseat
to her maternal responsibilities, and her
duties now take priority when considering
future academic and career choices.
"But it's okay," she said. "It's something I
was prepared to do."
After all. a midterm is nothing compared
to a daughter.
"People don't tell you how much it's going
to change when you have a child." she added.
"But they also don't tell you that she's going
to be the only thing you care about, so all
those sacrifices don't seem like sacrifices
anymore."
