## Editorial Lincoln and Darwin: Two 200-year-old lives of change 
### 
Criticized for his inconsistency, John
Maynard Keynes once responded,
"When the facts change, I change my
mind. What do you do. sir?"
On the 200 th birthday of Abraham Lin
coln and Charles Darwin,as well as the 150 th
anniversary of the publication of Darwin's
"The Origin of Species," the editorial board
would like to note one of these two great
minds' most remarkable characteristics: the
ability to change in the face of new evidence.
Abraham Lincoln lived in a time when
desire for true racial equality was rare. While
Lincoln always opposed slavery, he was at
best an equivocal advocate of racial equality.
Felicia R. lee's piece in The New York Times
this week pointed out that Lincoln never
knew successful African Americans while
growing up and living in Illinois — he first
met educated African Americans while in
the White I louse. Indeed. Lincoln may have
spent less than 24 hours of his entire life with
African Americans who were not servants.
But what a difference each hour made,
Lincoln went from having no real concept of
"highly intelligent" African Americans to
asking Frederick Douglass, the great orator
and former slave, what he thought of Lin
coln's second inaugural address, lie told
Douglass there was no other person whose
opinion he valued more. It's amazing how
quickly a man who once had African-Amer
ican servants came to regard Douglass as
one of the five most "meritorious" men in
the country.
I Jncoln's attitude towards African Amer
icans evolved drastically over the course of
his life. His opinions changed as his facts
changed. If they hadn't. his legacy might
have been very different.
Charles Darwin possessed this trait as
well. In the face of conflicting evidence, he

dared to toss out comprehensive concep
tions of the world and the human race.
At a primary debate this past year, Mike
I luckabee scoffed at the mere idea of believ
ing in macroevolution: "If anyone wants to
believe that they are the descendents of a
primate, they are certainly welcome to do it
— I don't know how far they will march that
back ..."
Today, when almost every tenured pro
fessor in a biology department regards evo
lution as a scientific fact, many others still
find it too outlandish to believe. Think of
how the idea might have seemed to Darwin
when it was truly novel.
Darwin proved willing to embrace even
the most profound suggestions from empiri
cal evidence. During his travels and studies,
he took notes and drew species assiduously,
paying close attention to the smallest details.
I le approached his research with a deep rev
erence for facts — each and every one of
them. And when he tried to understand the
causal underpinnings of life and nature, he
did not recoil from the truth. His mind
changed as his facts changed.
Countless books have been devoted to
discussing how Lincoln and Darwin met the
challenges before them and what we can
learn from their examples. But in a universi
ty environment — where students are ex
pected to analyze and make sense of new in
formation that floods them each day, where
students are constantly exposed to different
thoughts and ideas — the crucial lesson
from Lincoln and Darwin is that when the
facts change, we must change with them.
While putting all discoveries and observa
tions through a rigorous test is essential to le
gitimizing evidence, the editorial board
urges you to be forever yielding in the face of
true facts.
