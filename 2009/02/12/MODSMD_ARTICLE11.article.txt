## Nicole Demby Being and smokiness 
### 
I t's almost become a Stanford cliche. The
majority of students hustle between the
.gym and class, stopping to chug a Naked
Juice on the way. while a small contingency
of European grad students and studio art
majors ignore the scorn ol these ruddy
faced. young Stanfordians as tliev light up
their cigarettes. Ambitious members of the
former group looking for One. More. Hu
manitarian. Cause, start Campaign lor a
Smoke Free Stanford.
Some Stanford smokers get mad while
others shrug indifferently and drag on their
Camels. I'm not interested in debating the
health risks of second-hand smoke. What in
terests me are the reasons behind why the
majority of Stanford students don't smoke,
and exactly what causes them to cast such
looks of derision at anyone with a cigarette
stuck between their lips.
This may seem like an odd question to
ponder. Don't we all care about our own
health? With the exception of the occasional
blackout on Saturday nights, don't we act for
the most part as il our bodies were the tem
ples housing our 2(K).()()() dollar-educated,
world-changing brains? Are Stanford smok
ers godless nihilists? Stepping out of the li
brary for a cigarette break the other day. I re
alized that while this assessment might be an
exaggeration, maybe our philosophical out
looks do have some bearing 011 our health
habits, or lack thereof.
I was in the midst of writing a philosophy
paper when I decided to step outside the li
brary for a cigarette. Waxing particularly
philosophical during that fateful break. I un
derstood profoundly how lighting up puts
me into contact with my own mortality. It ex
tracts me from the world I was in moments
prior, the world in which the paper I was
writing was the be-all end-all ol my exis
tence. What smoking induced for me at that
moment was that "What does life really
mean?" question that is generally associated
with experiences where one is directly con
fronted with death. Having this epiphany
helped to put my philosophy paper, and the
mountains of other work I had to do. into
perspective.
Hmo? Maybe. Yet I suspect there's some
thing in my association with smoking and a
harsh existential truth that sheds light on
why people here abstain from cigarettes.
Perhaps this springs from the assumption
that what they do here at school is impor
tant. that it somehow matters 111 the grand
scheme of things. Playing with meaning is a
dangerous game when you're 011 a tight
schedule.

Nagging philosophical doubts tend to he
like diseases you can control but never cure:
once you catch them, they don't ever really
goawav. but stay lodged inside of you, flaring
up sometimes without warning. It's far safer
and more time-efficient not to ponder cer
tain questions. It's not that I don't teel like
what I do has value generally, yet when I
have moments of doubt, when I start to feel
like I'm just going automatically through
motions, getting my essays in on time or
completing my German homework sudden
ly becomes much more difficult. In this way.
pondering the nature of the universe poses a
hazardous risk to my Ci.PA.
Yet even the most health-conscious Stan
fordian commits a certain violence toward
herself. She lassoes her mind in from outer
space and slams it into the pages of her text
books. She forces her antsy body to be rigid
as she sits in a chair in some hushed corner or
the library for hours. She caffeinates herself
into oblivion and still somehow manages to
fall asleep facedown and drool all over her
books (or is that just me?)-The difference
between this form of violence and the vio
lence of smoking is that the former is for the
sake of academic productivity. Yet instead of
leading us to ponder whether or not what
we're doing is truly meaningful, this kind of
violence has a tendency to distract us from
deeper questions. It may be the means by
which we think we are achieving lofty goals,
yet our breakneck workload often keeps us
so busy that we don't even have time to ques
tion what these alleged goals really mean to
us.
I am of the firm belief that it is a good
thing to stop every once in a while and think
critically about things outside of the immedi
acy of our school work. What are we so afraid
of? I veil it smoking the philosophical stogie
sparks a confrontation with the abyss,even if
we prod the nature of the universe and de
cide there are no absolute truths that should
dictate how we live our lives, it won't neces
sarily undermine the things we do here. On
the contrary, it might force us to justify the
choices we make for ourselves, leading us to
live more authentic lives. What I object to
isn't our thinking that what we do is impor
tant. It's my suspicion that we hastily lore
close the question of whether it is or isn't
every time it starts to percolate.
