# Steal This Column
## The 						final blow to sports innocence 
### 
Last Saturday found me with my lather
at our old stomping grounds. AT&T
Park in San Francisco, the one place I
can truly call a second home (other than
Stanford. Berlin and about 13 or 14 other
places). I was there for the San Francisco (ii
ants FanFest.the annual February pilgrimage
that brings thousands of Giants fans to the
ballpark for the privilege of waiting in line for
hours in the hopes of having their favorite
player write his name on a baseball, and
hopefully ask us our name, that we may walk
away with a false sense of relevance.
I proudly affiliate myself with this fan
group, fully indulging in the delusional be
havior. truly believing that my wishing lim
Lineecum luck in the coming year is the sole
determinant between whether he wins 20
games or gets placed on the disabled list alter
being physically attacked by the Puerto
Rican Sharks from "West Side Story." I his
belief may well last me my life because, well,
it's harmless and it's fun.
hut on Saturday, the last remnants of an
other willful delusion were completely shat
tered for all baseball fans, as it \sas revealed
that Alex Rodriguez, arguably baseball's
greatest active player, failed a steroid test dis
tributed in 2003. The question of how this
story got parlayed into the public eye when it
was supposed to have been kept confidential
reflects an invasion of privacy no less disturb
ing than the story itself, but that is a discus
sion for another column.
The story has suddenly taken the entire
country by storm. Fven President Obama,
who is suddenly competing for headlines,
commented on the story, calling it "depress
ing news."
"If you're a fan of Major I eague Base
ball," Obama remarked in his White House
Press Conference."! think it tarnishes an en
tire era. to some degree. And its unfortunate,
because I think there are a lot of ballplayers

Mark
Donig

who played it straight."
T he news is actually more than depressing
to those of us who care about steroids in
sports (though it's fashionable to say, "Who
gives an 'expletive deleted ." most sports
fans do care). It's tragic, because Alex Ro
driguez's positive test and subsequent admis
sion of three years (at least) of steroid use is
bigger than jlist Rodriguez himself. I his scan
dal keeps getting worse and worse, and with
each earth-shaking admission from our base
ball idols, the court of public opinion is grad
ually shifting from a panel ol
doubt jurists to those firmly entrenched in
guiltv-until proven-innocent ideology, and
dare I say it rightfully so. We have been
betrayed time and again, and the question is
no longer who is guilty, but rather, if anyone
is innocent.
But the Alex Rodriguez scandal is bigger
than most. Barry Bonds. Mark McGwire.
Sammy Sosa. Jason Giambi and Roger
Clemens (to name a few) screamed steroids,
either through their on-field performance or
through their subsequent reaction to allega
tions.
Alex Rodriguez never did. Few people, ci
ther v\ ithin the game or outside of it. implicat
ed him (with Jose Canseco being the excep
tion. Isn't it ironic that people continue bash
ing him. even though, whatever his motives,
he may be the one person who is saving the
game? Hunk about it. He's been vindicated
in everv sinele accusation he has made).

And so, with A-Kod s name, statistics anu
accolades being marked with the same "tar
nished" asterisk as with all the other afore
mentioned names, fans no longer have any
reason to trust anyone in the game. MLB
Commissioner Hud Selie claims that with the
implementation of steroid testing and penal
ties, the steroid era is over. Says who (I mean,
besides him)? How do we know scientists
looking for a buck aren't working on exactly
the same thing now? Isn't the fact that some
of these steroids were undetectable partly
what got baseball embroiled in this scandal in
the first place?
Star players s;iv they are clean. So what?
Why should we believe them? I very single
player embroiled in this scandal said they
were clean, until, and sometimes even after,
they got caught. Albert Pujols and Ryan
Howard put up ghastly numbers every year.
Should we believe that they re clean because
they say they are? Alex Rodriguez said he
was clean, too.That was before he got caught.
We assume that players who rail on others
using steroids must be clean.The act could be
genuine, or it could be rhetoric;you can't tell
anymore. Every type of player, from the
greatest hulk to the scrawny, marginal major
leaguer. has tested positive for steroids. Any
one could be guilty, and they no longer have
the benefit of the doubt with me.
And so, last Saturday. I roamed the field of
AT& I Park, had Brian Wilson scribble on my
glove, yelled at l'im 1 incecum to have a good
year and marveled at ;ill six feet and 10 inches
of future I lall-of-Famer Randy Johnson. And
suddenlv. with no warning, I couldn't help but
think: Who should I be looking up to?
Fhat's the tragedy.

Mark would have rather written about the loss
of his dog. hut a picture's worth of words would
never suffice. Rll' (liilli Do(ni)g, the greatest
