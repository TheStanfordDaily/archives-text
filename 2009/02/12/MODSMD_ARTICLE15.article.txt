Cardinal make it to the semifinals before losing
to top-seeded Illinois. In 2003, the team went 1-
2. But this year is a new year, and team is deter
mined to have some different results this time
around.
"We are all looking forward to playing this
weekend," head coach John
Whitlinger said.
The format of the contest is a bit different
from the standard tournament: each team is
guaranteed at least three matches. I lowever. a
team has to keep winning in order to have a
shot at the title â€” one loss and you are elimi
nated from contention and play in the consola
tion bracket.

open the tournament on Friday.

over Arizona, No. 14 Texas A&M and No. 10

GAME NOTES: Both Stanford and Florida have three nation
ally ranked players. Due to weather, Stanford has only
played in three dual matches this year. The ITA National
Indoor Tournament features 16 of the top teams in the na
tion.

"They are very strong up and down the lineup.
We are just going to have to figure out pretty
quickly in the match what we need to do."
Unlike several teams in the tournament
that have played close to 10 dual matches on
the season. Stanford has only played three.The
season is still young for the Cardinal, so the
tournament will be a great barometer for
them.
"This tournament will be a good test to see
where we stand with all the best teams in the
country," Muller said.
The winner of Stanford-Florida will move
on it) the quarterfinals and play the winner of
Michigan-Texas, while the losers of both
matches will play each other.
"This tournament is always a great tourna
ment to see what the competition will be like
for the rest of the year, to figure out what you
need to do to get better," Whitlinger said.
"Every team is solid." he continued. "It
wouldn't surprise me to see a few upsets. It's
going to come down to the doubles points, and
what guys are playing big points well."
Stanford and Florida will square off at 10
a.m. on Friday, with the match on Saturday tak
ing place at 7 a.m.. regardless of a w in or loss.
"1 think this will be a good test for us." Wire
said. "There will be no easy matches, but if the
team comes together and plays well. 1 think we
can beat any team we play."
"There are a lot of good teams out there
who could potentially win it this week,"he con
tinued. "And I think we are one of them."
