wins first meet of the season
ITie Stanford men's club ski team
had an outstanding weekend, notch
ing its first win this season.The four
way meet, in which Stanford defeat
ed California. UC-Davis and Sierra
College, also marked the team's first
individual championship in at least
six years.
Team captain Peter Smillie led
the way for the Cardinal, winning
both the slalom and giant slalom
events on Saturday and Sunday, re
spectively.
Smillie's teammate. Aaron Par
ness. was also impressive, placing
third in Saturday's slalom event.
The giant slalom was particularly
thrilling. Smillie was trailing by a sec
ond after a first run. However, he
was able to make up time with a very
risky straight line over a knoll in the
middle of the course.

team also had a satisfying weekend,
defeating Davis for a second-place
finish.
Forcier leaves football team
Quarterback Jason Forcier has
quit the Stanford football team. The
current senior, who had an addition
al year of eligibility remaining, came
to the Farm from Michigan in 2(M)7.
and sat out until 2(H)K due to NCAA
transfer rules. He was an important
contributor in practice, winning the
Cardinal's Cireg Piers Award for his
work with the offensive service
team.This past fall, in his first year of
action for Stanford, the versatile
passer was as high as second on the
quarterback depth chart.
But he struggled in limited action
in four games, he completed only
38.5 percent of his passes, with one
interception and no touchdowns. He
replaced starter Tavita Pritchard
against Arizona after Pritchard sus
tained a concussion, but was soon re
placed by third-stringer Alex
I .oukas. who led the Cardinal on the
game winning drive with under a

minute left. After that performance,
Loukas took over the backup quar
terback duties for the rest of the sea
son. knocking Forcier down the
depth chart.
With Pritchard and Loukas both
returning, and highly-touted fresh
man Andrew Luck (who redshirted
this past season) ready to compete
for the starting job. Forcier's chances

at stardom with the Cardinal ap
peared to be numbered.
Forcier's departure marks anoth
er loss at the quarterback position
this offseason,coming on the heels of
redshirt freshman L.D. Crow's trans
fer to Central Florida.
