# On deck: the designated juicer
## 
### 
Some people, often jokingly,
argue that steroids are good
for baseball because they
make the players better and
the game more enjoyable for fans.
Others think the use of steroids is
nothing more than cheating.
But the biggest problem with
steroids isn't determining if their use is
cheating or not, or deciding what level
of "performance enhancers" are ac
ceptable — is laser-eye surgery fair?
Are Cortisone shots'?
It is the uncertainty that surrounds
the game when you can't be sure who
is/was juicing and when.
Well, there is one solution that
could make all these problems go
away, so I hope Mr. Selig is paying at
tention: legalize steroids.
But don't just announce that
steroids are allowed for whoever
wants them — that would still leave
the question of knowing who was
using. Instead, use the drugs to bring
some balance between the American
and National leagues and designate
which players can be rubbed with
"flaxseed oil."
The Al has the designated hitter
which many baseball purists think
is essentially cheating and not real
baseball — and the Nl. doesn't. Hie
AL has won 11 of the last 17 World Se
ries,and the NL hasn't won an All-Star
Game since 19%. Clearly something
needs to be done to makes things a lit
tle more equal.
So kill two birds with one syringe
and institute a "Designated Juicer"
rule in the National I eague.
Lach Nl. team would get one play
er who has the option of using steroids
at will throughout the season. In inter
league games played in a National
League park, the AL team would be
allowed to inject one player the da\ of
the game. In American League parks,
the "DJ." as he could be called, would
abstain until he returned to Nl play.
Meanwhile, test all other players to
make sure only the DJs are using
we want this to be fair.
This way. everyone would know
who was on steroids and who wasn't. It
would take away all the doubt and un
certainty and make the game transpar
ent, which is what everyone says they
want.
.lust think about the epic match-ups
this would create: bottom ol the ninth
in game seven of the World Series wit h
two outs, the tying run on base and the
6-foot-5, 260 pound "Designated
Juicer" coming to the plate. I lis mus
cles are bulging beneath his jersey,and
the ground trembles when he walks.
The lanky 20-year-old pitcher, who
barely weighs 150 soaking wet and just
made the postseason roster after wow
ing in a September call-up. is dripping
with sweat but steady as a rock as he
glares in from under the brim of his
pulled down cap to get the sign.
Can science win the day. or will
skill, hard work and the indefatigable
spirit of youth triumph? The storyline
is just perfect, and would drive TV rat
ings through the roof.
But the best part is that il would put
an end to the "asterisk" debate in the
record books. There could be a sepa
rate category for players on steroids:
Aaron could be the home run king,
and Bonds could be the "enhanced"
home run king (assuming we moved
all the juicers from before the DJ rule
into that category).
And. since our society prides itself
on individual freedoms and letting the
individual make his own choices, this
would set a great example for our kids.
Once they become adults, they could
make the choice il they want to use
steroid or not — we let them decide if
they want to smoke and decide if they
want to drink: let them decide il they
want to juice.
('lcarly the best course of action is
simply to normalize and regulate
steroid use rather than trying to fight
it.This way, we will know who is natu
ral and who isn't, and the National
League will get a much needed "shot
in the arm."
And.it A Rod decides he wants to
go back to the 50-plus home run per
season average lie put up in Texas, he
could always request a trade to a NL
team ... the (Hants are looking for a
third baseman.
