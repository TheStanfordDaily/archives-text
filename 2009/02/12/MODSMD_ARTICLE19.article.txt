# WOMEN'S WATER POLO
## Stanford takes a double dose 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS 
Fresh off its success in the Stan
ford Invitational last weekend, the
Stanford women's water polo team
looks to continue its win streak in a
douhleheader against Sonoma State
and UC-Santa Cruz at Avery Aquat
ic Center on Feb. 14.
The No. 2 Cardinal went 3-1 in the
Invitational to earn the third-place
title and improved its season record
to 5-1. Although Stanford has an av
erage margin of victory of more than
five goals, head coach John Tanner is
still not completely satisfied with his
team's play.
"Our 6-on-5 (power play) was not
sharp most of the weekend, and we'll
have to improve there," Tanner said.
"We'll also need to improve our one
on-one defense. We spent way too
much of Sunday's games on power
play defense because of those short
comings."
The power play troubles were es
pecially costly in the Cardinal's lone
loss of the season, against No. 1 USC
in the Invitational. Leading by one
with two minutes to play. Stanford
had the ball on a power play, know
ing one goal would secure the victo
ry. Yet the Cardinal was unable to
convert, allowing USC to come back
and force the game into overtime,
where the Trojans eventually won.
The upcoming games against
Sonoma State and Santa Cruz should
be great opportunities for the Cardi

nal to work on power play situations.
Sonoma State did not win a game
until last week, losing four straight
games to start the season, including a
14-1 loss to Hawaii. Stanford defeat
ed Hawaii 8-6 on Feb. 6.
Santa Cruz has not played much
better. The Banana Slugs are 2-3,
with their two victories coming
against a 1-7 Fresno Pacific crew in
the Colorado State Invite.
Part of the Cardinal's struggles on
power plays can be traced to the ab
sence of senior driver Lauren Silver.
The three-time Ail-American and
leading Stanford scorer from last
year has been sidelined all season
with injuries. Tanner is not certain
when she will be back in the pool.
Even though Stanford has been able
to manage without Silver's talent and
leadership, there is no doubt her re
turn will greatly enhance the Cardi
nal's already potent offense.
In the meantime. Stanford will
continue to score any way it can.
While freshman Melissa Seidemann
and junior Kelly Eaton have picked
up the majority of the slack, the Car
dinal has been spreading the ball
around, not relying on any one play
er. During the Invitational, 11 differ
ent Stanford players scored.
With so many legitimate scoring
threats, defending the Cardinal is a
tall order. Stanford has already
scored 71 goals in six games, and
when Silver finally returns, that num
ber mav skvrocket.

While Tanner has been going
deep into his roster to fill Silver's of
fensive void, he has the opposite
problem in the cage. Sophomore
goalies Amber Oland and Kim Hall
have been sharing time blocking
shots this season. In the Cardinal's
Feb. 8 victory over UCLA, Oland
and Hall combined to hold the No. 3
Bruins to only five goals and shut
them out in the first and fourth quar
ters. Oland and Hall will likely con
tinue to split time, especially in the
upcoming doubleheader.
If Stanford jumps out to a big
lead in either game, Tanner will most
likely give his talented freshman
class playing time in order to gain
some valuable in-pool experience.
While Seidemann has already estab
lished herself as a formidable force,
several other freshmen played sur
prisingly well during the Invitational
and are starting to make names for
themselves. Cassie Churnside
turned in a hat trick against Arizona
State on Feb. 8. and Pallavi Menon
had two goals against USC. Alyssa
Lo, Monica Coughlan and Mimi
Hurv round out a freshman class that
gives Tanner great depth and flexi
bility.

a.m. against Sonoma State, with the
Santa Cruz match scheduled for 2
