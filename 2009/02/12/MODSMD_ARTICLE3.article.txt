## 5-SURE adds car to fleet New transportation option to help students in Oak Creek 
### CALLA SHENG 
5-SURE has recently acquired a car from
Student Housing to safely transport the
undergraduates housed in Oak Creek apart
ments to and from campus.
Located between Sand Hill Road and
Oak Creek Drive, the ()ak ( reek apartments

are currently the only off-campus residence
for undergraduates. About 60 students, most
of whom are coming back from studying
abroad, have been placed in Oak Creek for
the quarter by Student Housing. Before 5-
SURE's service, the residents had to rely on
personal vehicles or the Marguerite shuttle to
go to campus and back.
Because golf carts cannot legally travel on
city streets. 5-SI'RE was not able to drive
Oak C reek residents in need at the beginning
of the quarter, and had to direct them to the
nearest Marguerite stop when they called.

" ITie result of that is getting together with
the staff at Student 1 lousing," said Assistant
Dean of Student Unions Jeanette Smith-
Laws. who is in charge of 5-SURE. "There
were meetings held with Student Housing
people, and we talked about how to resolve
the problem of golf carts going to Oak Creek.


BECCA DEL MONTE/The Stanford Daily
In the course of conversation, the idea
of a vehicle came up, and it ended up
being our best solution."
TTie car. owned by Student
Housing, is 5-SURE's first since the
program started service in 1979.
Smith-Laws said that the 5-SURE
team is dedicated to finding new ways
to improve their service and is excited
about the new vehicle.
"This is what we do, and Student
Housing stepped up to the plate to
provide a means in order for us to

offer the service." she said. "It's just
been a win-win for everyone."
Since 5-SURE drivers have to be
licensed to drive golf carts, the intro
duction of the car has posed no diffi
culty to the team.
"You couldn't have found a better
alternative." Smith-Laws said. "We're
excited to have access to a vehicle, and
provide [students] the service,
because otherwise we would not be
able to do it."
According to 5-SURE manager
Kyle Knutson 1)9. the car was first put
in service a week ago. It is a white
sedan with a Housing logo on the
door. On trips to and from Oak
Creek, the car's pickup point is by the
flagpole on Oak Creek property on

the corner of Sand Hill and Stock
Farm Road.
Elena Fuetsch 10. residential assis
tant (RA) at Oak Creek,said that the
residents are very happy with the new
service.
"Maybe 25 percent of the people
here don't have a car, and we don't
have Marguerite service on week
ends." Fuetsch said. "Plus, many peo
ple can't bring their cars to campus
on weekends if they plan on drink
ing. and we certainly don't want
them to drive back. Before they
would just stay on campus for the
night; 5-SURE's car service is neces
sary and very much like a valuable
resource."
Despite popular demand, there are

no plans at this time to extend this
service to other campus locations,
where golf carts can easily navigate.
Housing is committed, however, to
continuing the service for Oak Creek
residents.
"Student Housing is happy to be
providing a university service vehicle
to the 5-SURE program." wrote
Rodger Whitney, executive director of

Student Housing in an email to The
Daily. "The service is in place for this
academic year, and we will continue
to work with 5-SURE and others to
determine the best program to have
in place for the Oak Creek under
graduate residents as long as they are
there."

"The fact that 5-SURE now has a
car for Oak Creek students is big,"
Fuetsch added. "It's great. It is sonic
thing that we really need here, and
we're happy that they're providing it."
