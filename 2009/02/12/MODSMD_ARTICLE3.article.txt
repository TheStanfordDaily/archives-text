## 5-SURE adds car to fleet New transportation option to help students in Oak Creek 
### CALLA SHENG 
5-SURE has recently acquired a car from
Student Housing to safely transport the
undergraduates housed in Oak Creek apart
ments to and from campus.
Located between Sand Hill Road and
Oak Creek Drive, the ()ak ( reek apartments

are currently the only off-campus residence
for undergraduates. About 60 students, most
of whom are coming back from studying
abroad, have been placed in Oak Creek for
the quarter by Student Housing. Before 5-
SURE's service, the residents had to rely on
personal vehicles or the Marguerite shuttle to
go to campus and back.
Because golf carts cannot legally travel on
city streets. 5-SI'RE was not able to drive
Oak C reek residents in need at the beginning
of the quarter, and had to direct them to the
nearest Marguerite stop when they called.

" ITie result of that is getting together with
the staff at Student 1 lousing," said Assistant
Dean of Student Unions Jeanette Smith-
Laws. who is in charge of 5-SURE. "There
were meetings held with Student Housing
people, and we talked about how to resolve
the problem of golf carts going to Oak Creek.
