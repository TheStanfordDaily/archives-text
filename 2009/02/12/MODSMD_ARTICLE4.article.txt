# DRAW TASK FORCE TOWN HALL
## Students, admin. DISCUSS DRAW 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
Residential and Dining Enterprises pre
sented its proposed changes to the housing
Draw in a poorly attended Town Hall
Meeting last night in Toyon. While each pro
posal was explained and presented for feed
hack. issues such as the in-house draw process
and preferred/un-preferred housing options
garnered the most attention from the less
than 30 students in attendance.
The recommendations for altering the
Draw were drafted and assembled by the
Draw Review Task Force — a 17-member
group of faculty, administrators and students
chaired by Rodger Whitney, executive direc
tor of Student Housing. When Senior
Associate Vice Provost Shirley Everett con
vened the group in June of last year, she
charged Residential & Dining Enterprises
with a main objective of simplifying the Draw.
"We want to better allocate the increasing
supply of premiere spaces," Everett said.
"This means taking the buildings back to their
original design, meaning buildings originally
designed for a single will be reverted back to
a single, rather than placing two students into
a private room as we do now."
The proposals are to: (1) create a three-tier
numbering system, (2) consider class standing
during housing allocation, (3) allow unlimited
residence choice rankings. (4) allow house
and room-type selection online for the 2010
Draw. (5) standardize the in-house room
selection process, (6) replace priorities with

pre-assignments and binding agreements and
(7) support gender-neutral housing.
Everett and Whitney presented these rec
ommendations in a town hall setting after
meeting with residential assistants (R As), res
idence deans (RDs). resident fellows (RFs).
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
John Bravman and Residential Education
staff in hope of obtaining student feedback.
"1 think the goal of tonight is really to
engage students, to have a good discussion
about the housing master plan." Everett said.
"It's very important for us to implement stu
dent feedback on the recommendations that
we take forward to the Provost for approval."
The main issues that students were con
cerned with revolved around the effects of a
three-tier numbering system and in-house
room selection. The new in-house draw
process would allow students to narrow down
their draw options to room type and resi
dence. rather than just choosing which house
to live in. and the three-tier system presents
three alternatives to the current un-pre
ferred/preferred year options.
But before the three-tier system is imple
mented. the details of who can draw into each
tier must be decided.
The first option presented by the task force
allows for rising sophomores to draw into the
worst tier—housing corresponding to num
bers 2,000 to 3.000 — while giving rising jun
iors and seniors the opportunity draw into
either the middle or best tier — housing cor-
responding to I.(KM) to 2.000 or 1 to
1.000, respectively.
The second option allows rising
sophomores to choose between the
middle and worst tiers, and rising
juniors and seniors to draw into any
tier.
Finally, the third option requires
rising sophomores to draw into the
worst tier, the juniors into the mid
dle tier and the seniors into the best
tier.
Concerns over the recommenda
tions included a belief that allowing
upper-class students to take advan
tage of premiere spaces — rooms
that give students more privacy,
such as singles and two-room dou
bles— would interfere with creat
ing a diverse living environment.
"My concern was that the system
was going to make it stratified, so
much so that seniors would never
meet people from different classes,
and that freshman would never
know that other classes existed,
which sounds like that might hap
pen with the Wilbur/Stern scheme,
but that's probably unavoidable."
said Alex Brown '10.
As a result, when Whitney put
the three-tier options to a vote, the
majority of students opted for the
second option, which would allow
rising sophomores more flexibility
in choosing their housing.
"Like Thev said, there's nothing
that's not going to have any glitches
in it," said Ladidi Garba '11. "At
least there's some flexibility to [the
second option], unlike the other
ones where there really isn't. There
could be much more problems with
those other two options."
Everett and Whitney pointed
out that the meetings they've con
ducted with RAs, RFs, RDs and
Residential Education staff have
shown much the same preference.
"Stanford's always been a place
that loves options and flexibility,"
Whitney said. "I think that's what
makes the second choice a good
choice. It allows people to do what
they want to do. We're probably going
to end up going for more flexibility."

Overall, students enjoyed the
opportunity to engage in a discus
sion with the administration on
issues that greatly affect them.
"I like that there's administra
tors working with students and that
they're getting the opinions of stu
dents." said Nicole Gordon *11. "It
sounds sappy, but it's actually real
ly nice."

Final recommendations from the
Draw Task Force will be available
online for those who did not attend
the Town Hall meeting. Whitney
said that the changes are to be
implemented in time for this April's
Draw.
