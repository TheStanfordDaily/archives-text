# DRAW TASK FORCE TOWN HALL
## Students, admin. DISCUSS DRAW 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
Residential and Dining Enterprises pre
sented its proposed changes to the housing
Draw in a poorly attended Town Hall
Meeting last night in Toyon. While each pro
posal was explained and presented for feed
hack. issues such as the in-house draw process
and preferred/un-preferred housing options
garnered the most attention from the less
than 30 students in attendance.
The recommendations for altering the
Draw were drafted and assembled by the
Draw Review Task Force — a 17-member
group of faculty, administrators and students
chaired by Rodger Whitney, executive direc
tor of Student Housing. When Senior
Associate Vice Provost Shirley Everett con
vened the group in June of last year, she
charged Residential & Dining Enterprises
with a main objective of simplifying the Draw.
"We want to better allocate the increasing
supply of premiere spaces," Everett said.
"This means taking the buildings back to their
original design, meaning buildings originally
designed for a single will be reverted back to
a single, rather than placing two students into
a private room as we do now."
The proposals are to: (1) create a three-tier
numbering system, (2) consider class standing
during housing allocation, (3) allow unlimited
residence choice rankings. (4) allow house
and room-type selection online for the 2010
Draw. (5) standardize the in-house room
selection process, (6) replace priorities with

pre-assignments and binding agreements and
(7) support gender-neutral housing.
Everett and Whitney presented these rec
ommendations in a town hall setting after
meeting with residential assistants (R As), res
idence deans (RDs). resident fellows (RFs).
Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education
John Bravman and Residential Education
staff in hope of obtaining student feedback.
"1 think the goal of tonight is really to
engage students, to have a good discussion
about the housing master plan." Everett said.
"It's very important for us to implement stu
dent feedback on the recommendations that
we take forward to the Provost for approval."
The main issues that students were con
cerned with revolved around the effects of a
three-tier numbering system and in-house
room selection. The new in-house draw
process would allow students to narrow down
their draw options to room type and resi
dence. rather than just choosing which house
to live in. and the three-tier system presents
three alternatives to the current un-pre
ferred/preferred year options.
But before the three-tier system is imple
mented. the details of who can draw into each
tier must be decided.
The first option presented by the task force
allows for rising sophomores to draw into the
worst tier—housing corresponding to num
bers 2,000 to 3.000 — while giving rising jun
iors and seniors the opportunity draw into
either the middle or best tier — housing cor-
