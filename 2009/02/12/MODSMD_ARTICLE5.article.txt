## GSC raises financial concerns 
### DANIEL BUI 
At its meeting last night, the Graduate Student
Council (CiSC) reviewed projects proposed by the
ASSU Executives, heard from the director of the
Bechtel International Center and went over budget
policies for the upcoming year.
ASSU Executives Jonny Horsey '00 and Pagan
I larris '09 suggested a number of changes to how stu
dent government might handle various issues and
services offered to the Stanford community. Part of
their proposal included the creation of a new branch
of government that would handle student services.
John Pearson, director of the Bechtel International
Center,spoke to the CiSC next. He outlined the cen
ter's efforts with regard to immigration and insurance
issues, as well as work opportunities.
'In terms of our services to international graduate
students, it's split in two areas." Pearson explained,
noting the center's advising and numerous programs
available at Bechtel.
University budget cuts, however, have become a
concern in funding those services.
"Hopefully, we can maintain some kind of balance,
even with the budget situation." Pearson said. "Once
we know what the cuts are. we will figure out how to
deal with them."
Financial concerns were a major topic of discus
sion for the GSC. Co-Chair George Bloom recently
reviewed graduate policies with the University
administration and seemed to approve of how discus
sions have been developing to ensure student organi
zations still get adequate funding.
"The administration is still very committed to
improving life for graduate students." Bloom
explained.The partnership between the GSC and the
administration "has only been enhanced in the last
few months," he added.
GSC members also discussed the recent loss of
music equipment, while considering ways in which the
equipment can be made more accessible to students,
and Matt McLaughlin, financial manager for the
GSC, was reelected for a second term.
