"Missy is the centerpiece of this program," he said.
"She is a phenomenal pitcher who continues to get
better."
On the offensive side, Stanford is loaded with tal
ent throughout the lineup. Junior catcher Rosey
Neill. recipient of the Pac-10 Player of the Week
award last week, is a menacing threat in the middle of
the Cardinal lineup. Last season she blasted 19 home
runs, and she already has three this year to go along
with an astonishing .S(H) batting average.
Neill recognized her importance as both a defen
sive player and a hitter.
"My first job is to make Missy look good," Neill
said. "On the offensive side, it is to get RBIs."
Neill gets plenty of chances to do just that as the
top of the Stanford lineup is one of the best in the
nation.

Hitting out of the leadoff spot is two-time
Ail-American Alissa Haber. The junior left field
er looks poised to have another big season, car-

rying a .467 batting average and four doubles
into the weekend.
To compliment Haber is freshman phenom
shortstop Ashley Hansen. One of the most
desired recruits in the country. Hansen

comes to Stanford with a great deal of
experience, having been the only high
schooler to go to training camp with the
ITS. National Team before the 2008
Beijing Olympics. In her first collegiate
tournament, Hansen hit .412, including

in her very first at-bat.
As a team, the Cardinal is hitting
.367 for the season, with a very im
pressive .480 on-base percentage.
lliis success at the plate comes as
no surprise to Rittman.
"This is a really good team, with
lots of talent." he said. "It is just im
portant for us to get games under
our belt early on."
This weekend, the Cardinal

The game will be somewhat of a
reunion for Haber as she plays
