Neill gets plenty of chances to do just that as the
top of the Stanford lineup is one of the best in the
nation.

To compliment Haber is freshman phenom

desired recruits in the country. Hansen

comes to Stanford with a great deal of

schooler to go to training camp with the

Beijing Olympics. In her first collegiate
tournament, Hansen hit .412, including
