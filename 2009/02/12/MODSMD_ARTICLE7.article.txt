### MIKE DING DESK EDITOR 
Fatty Stonesifer, former CEO of the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation, shared her experiences at the helm of one of the
world's largest private foundations last night at Leventhal Hall.
Hosted by the Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil
Society (PACS), the lecture was structured as an informal ques
tion-and-answer session, first between Stonesifer and PACS co
director Debra Meyerson.and then open to individual questions
from members of the audience.
Stonesifer said that private foundations such as the Bill and

something is great." she said. "I've had a lot of partners pick up a
phone and tell me that they don't like what's happening. That's

But Stonesifer also said that for such lines of communication
to be established, the recipients of donations must also demon
strate strong initiative.
"It starts with strong leadership on the other end." she said.
"The first thing to do is make sure we're giving to an organi/a

relationship. They should know that they're doing us a favor by
