# Ladies, celebrate Valentine's Day the Finnish way!
## 
### 
It's that time of the year when
you start to envy your attached
friends as they make romantic
plans for that special day ... but
only just a little bit, because there
are ways you can celebrate
Valentine's Day without a special
someone. This year, why not cele
brate Valentine's Day the Finnish
way? In Finland, Valentine's Day is
called Ystavatipaiva, which trans
lates to Friendship Day.
There, Ystavanpaiva is celebrat
ed as a day dedicated to the beauti
ful bond of friendship by sending
gifts, chocolates and flowers to
friends and loved ones. Here are a
few ways you can do the same thing
— with your friends!
An outing to San Francisco is in
order!
This Valentine's Day weekend is
a three-day weekend, so take advan
tage of it! Why not get a group of
your friends together and book a
hotel room in San Francisco? That
way you can squeeze in a little bit of
everything San Francisco has to

offer. Here's an idea: shop 'til you
drop in Union Square during the
day, grab a snazzy dinner in North
Beach (the Little Italy of San
Francisco) and party it up at any of
the V-Day parties on Saturday
night. Maybe you'll even find your
new love on the dance floor. These
are just a couple that are happening
this Saturday:
For 21+, try Mighty, one of the
hottest clubs in S.F., to hear top
notch international DJs Rich
Medina, DJ Spinna and Hakobo at
"NoThing BUT LOVE." These
world-famous Dls have attracted
celebs such as lay-Z, P-Diddy and
Stevie Wonder to their parties.
Tickets are $20 at the door (119
Utah St.).
For those under 21, try Element, a
hip lounge where celebrity DJ David
Carvalho will hit the turntables for
"V: Will you be my |un]Valentine."
Tickets are $! 0 at the door (1028
Geary St.).
Movie and dinner date
Gather your favorite friends

and go to one of the many cute
movies that are out right now,
including "Confessions of a
Shopaholic" and "He's Just Not That
Into You." You can follow it up with
a dinner in Palo Alto and gelato for
dessert!
Stay on campus!
You don't need to go off cam
pus to have fun with your friends.
Here are a few things you can enjoy
on the Farm:
— Love Sucks: Mixed Company
offers a chance to get into the spirit
of anti-Valentine's on Friday night
(8 to 9:30 p.m.) at Toyon. Enjoy a
night of risque comedy and amaz
ing music.
— There's nothing like a movie
marathon! Rent a bunch of movies
starring your celebrity crush or grab
a handful of romantic comedies and
feast your eyes!
— Party it up! Invite friends over
for gossiping, drinking fruity, flirty
drinks (think Strawberry Kiss,
French Cosmo, Very Cherry
Martini) and a girly playlist of songs

like "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun."
— Since you are not spending
money on a partner, show yourself
some love! Treat yourself to a
mani/pedi or go shopping and
splurge.
— Organize a secret admirer gift
exchange among your friends so
you can have a Valentine. Get a
group of friends and draw names
from a hat to deliver chocolates,
candy and flowers to each other!
Who says you need a boyfriend or
girlfriend to receive gifts?
Valentine's Day does not have
to be about romantic love. In some
parts of the world, people celebrate
the day as a chance to appreciate all
kinds of love and friendship. So cel
ebrate this year the Finnish way, and
I guarantee you won't be envious of
your attached friends!
