# Romantic restaurants for all budgets & couples!

If done right, a date for
Valentine's Day can make a rela
tionship. But if done wrong, a
Valentine's Day date can break the
bank. To guarantee the outcome
you're looking for, Intermission
offers up a number of V-Day sug
gestions ranging from what you can
afford with the cash in your pocket
up to a dinner that will require a
new issuance of structured debt.
Cafe Del Doge
Few countries can match the
romantic appeal of Italy, but for
most of us catching a flight to
Venice might be a bit much for the
weekend. Fortunately, the atmos
phere of a European Cafe is
admirably and truthfully re-recreat
ed right on University Avenue at
Cafe Del Doge. Enjoy a plethora of
drinks ranging from a simple cup of
espresso to chocolate-based concoc
tions with Italian names that are so
long and colorful, you just might get
lost in the syllables trying to order.
The most affable baristas in town
also can serve up glasses of wine in

the well furnished, intimate space. It
may not be a meal, but considering
two people can get out for $10 or so
— it's not a bad deal.
Da Coffee Spot
Perhaps the strangest storefront on
University Avenue is the combina
tion of Mills Florist and a hookah
bar known as Da Coffee Spot.
What's next, a combination Persian
rug store and snowboard shop? In
any event, once you can get past the
absurdity of the florist pairing, Da
Coffee Spot offers a relaxing respite
from the outside world. The main
attraction is the hookah, which will
set you back $20. Food and drinks
with a Mediterranean theme, along
the lines of coffee, tea, pita with var
ious spreads, and wraps, are also
available. Perhaps the hookah con
cept doesn't seem romantic at first,
but if you're spending the earlier
part of the day in a dark room shar
ing saliva, things should be shaping
up quite nicely for later. This does
not, though, that Intermission
endorses the smoking of tobacco

products like hookah which are
known to the State of California to
contain carcinogenic chemicals.
Pasta?
Returning to an Italian theme, if
you're looking for a complete meal,
consider Pasta?. If you just look at
the name and the half-trendy, half
fast food-esque neon sign, it is
tempting to pass judgment before
even trying the food. However, the
food is surprisingly good; Pasta?
serves up reasonably priced pasta
dishes that are competently pre
pared and served in a setting that is
modern and unpretentious. Waiters
can be a bit slow, but are usually
friendly. Overall, Pasta? is a good
balance of food, decor, and price.
Cafe Pro Bono
Upping the ante a little from Pasta?
is Cafe Pro Bono, located off of the
less yuppie California Avenue. Pro
Bono offers an authentic Italian
menu in a traditional environment
staffed with professional servers.
Cafe Pro Bono is probably not the
place to go if your wallet is really

hurting, but it is by no means over
priced and offers very respectable
food in a legitimately romantic set
ting.
Fuki Sushi
It may seem that the Italians have
unfairly dominated the list so far, so
if you're looking for something
completely different, how about a
sushi dinner? Sushi in the Palo Alto
area is a problematic topic and
there are surely many people who
will argue with any restaurant
endorsement. But in the context of
a date that's on a budget, Fuki Sushi
is probably the safest bet. The fish is
not necessarily the best available,
but it is always at least satisfactory
— which is far from a guarantee at
many competitors. Fuki Sushi is not
the deal of the century, but it cer
tainly won't break the bank.
Perhaps what most sets Fuki apart
in this particular case is the setting:
the restaurant is serenly quiet, dec
orated with Japanese wood and
bamboo finishing and backed by
prompt and exceptionally polite
service.

Zibibbo
Moving into a pricier range, we have
Zibibbo hidden away on Kipling
Street off of University Avenue. The
restaurant, which appears to be an
old Victorian House in the front,
opens into a bar and several distinct
dining areas, each with a slightly dif
ferent feel. The eclectic menu can
best be described as a combination
of Californian and Mediterranean
influences that would entice a food
ie while still leaving easy-to-like
options for those who prefer to be
able to pronounce what they eat.
Entrees are mostly in the $20-$3O
range, so bring along the plastic. For
a taste of Zibibbo without the full
price tag, consider some wine
accompanied by oysters — a classic
aphrodisiac — from the raw bar.
Marche
If your stock portfolio has been per
forming better than everyone else's
and you want to blow away your
date, it's hard to argue with Marche,
located just five minutes away in
Menlo Park. If price is not an object,
this is probably the best food
around. The French/New American
cuisine is available either a la carte
or as an epic prix fixe. By the time
the meal is over be prepared for
potential triple digit tabs on a per
person basis. Also, note that tables
with windows on the kitchen can
provide an interesting glimpse into
the culinary arts, but don't say you
weren't warned if you witness the
one cook who ensures quality by
dipping his finger in a sauce and
putting the finger in his mouth
before repeating the process ...
