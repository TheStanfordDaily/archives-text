# Love may be more than skin deep, but looking good in your skin helps!
## for the guys for the girls

If you've got a hot date this Valentine's Day, why not dress up for once? Contrary to popular opinion, men's clothes can be sexy. Now, if you are not
the typical Stanford man, and you actually care about fashion and how you look, then you probably already know most of what I'm about to say. The
advice I'm about to give is meant to act more as guidelines: basic ideas that are not too out of the ordinary, if you will. Don't be afraid to step out of
your boundaries and think up your own outfits.

The Formal Attire
Joseph Abboud two-button tuxedo
($745)
Ted Baker Blenham suit ($625)
Royal Silk pocket square (ranges
from $7-$l2)
If you're going to a formal
restaurant or event for
Valentine's Day, remember that
you're not going to a job inter
view. Keep those navy, three
button business suits in the clos
et. You can be a little more fash
ion forward than usual. Look for
a slim, two-button suit by
Joseph Abboud (an American
designer, so you can helpoo r
economy). Jackets with deeper,
narrower lapels tend to be more
flattering than your standard
suit.

If you want to stand out, you
might want a one-button jacket,
which is out of place at work but
great for dates. Ted Baker is your
best bet if you're on a budget but
care about quality, and if you're
not, go for Ermenegildo Zegna. For
a shirt, try to find one with French
cuffs, which are a bit too overstated
for everyday wear but are appropri
ate for holidays. Thomas Pink is the
go-to for a lot of men looking for
shirts.
You probably won't need a tie
— Valentine's Day is a time to
loosen up. Put the color in other
parts of your outfit. Unless you're
going for the sexy waiter look, you
don't want to do black and white.
8000-ring. If there's one day of the
year to don a light pink or even red
shirt, it's Valentine's Day. If black
and white is more your thing and
you don't mind being mistaken for
a concierge, at least add a solid
pocket square in a suitable lovey
dovey color.

The Semi-Formal Attire

Express fitted military shirt ($69.50)
Energie long sleeve shirt (ranges from

$50-$115)
Naked & Famous Slimguy jeans
($120)
Creative Recreation DiCoco Lo
sneakers ($95)

Men should try to be a
little dressier than normal
for Valentine's Day. Even if
you're not going anywhere
fancy, a nice button-down
~, , I

shirt couldn't hurt.
Express has a large selec

tion of button-downs
that are cut shorter for
going out and do not
need to be tucked in.
Energie also has a
bunch of good shirts
on sale. Pair them with
black selvage jeans like
the Slimguys from

Naked & Famous
Denim, which are priced
at $120 a pair.
Sneak in one red
accessory, like the $95

DiCoco Lo sneakers from

Creative Recreation, which
are black with a red stripe.

If there's one piece that should

stand out, it's the footwear.
Have fun with it! There
are lots of rules when it
comes to men's dressing, but
that just means that there are
more rules to be broken. And
you should definitely break
some.
Some basic guidelines to
follow, whether it's
Valentine's Day or just a nor
mal day; trust us, your girl
friend will notice and com
pliment you:
Wear the right size
Buying a large might make
you feel big and manly, but if
you aren't physically big (or
manly), it'll make you look
like Soulja Hoy wanna-be.
Baggy clothes are not attrac
tive.

There is no such things as

"bov colors"

and "girl col
i ors"

Pink is fine.
Wearing

112 black also
does not
automatical

ly mean that you're goth. We're not
little kids anymore.
Loosen a few buttons at the top of
your shirt
But have caution, especially with V
necks — don't go around showing
too much he-vage.

It's Valentine's Day again. If you're anything like me, you don't ever care about hol
idays except as occasions to dress up. And if it's an occasion — and this is hard love,
girls — don't bother dressing up if you don't plan on impressing.
Take a page from Kate Moss's book: If there's a guaranteed way to be the center of
attention, it's by wearing the opposite of what's expected. Moss always under-dresses to
formal events and over-dresses to casual events. Example: wearing white-hot pants to
a wedding, a 1950s prom dress and tied back hair to the NME music awards, tight
leather trousers and a tuxedo jacket to a black-tie Metropolitan Ball in New York and
sequins to a muddy music festival. Wear what you want and go out of your way to
betray convention — and if you pull it off and look perfectly comfortable and confi-

dent in your skin, then you're the one who's set the fashion code; everyone else is wear
ing the wrong thing.
So even if it's Valentine's Day, forget the standard pink dress and pretty, girly heels.
Be creative! Intermission's put together some outfits, both high- and low-fashion, for
you to consider. They range from formal to semi-formal to very casual.
But remember: If it's a formal dinner — best go in the least formal thing you've
got. Or even if you still insist on the nice, pretty, boring dress, at least pair it up with
something unexpected, like a fedora hat and studded shoes instead of curled hair and
pretty pumps.

The Formal Attire
Asos.com Lace Dress (£37.50, or $55.73)
Yaya Vapor Jacket ($660)
Baker's black Paola platforms ($89.95)
Urban Outfitters Sheer Tights (two for $10)
Personally, I think this lace dress is gorgeous and
wearable under any circumstance — even to
class. It all depends on what you dress it with.

The Casual Get-Up
Express Oversized Pocket Tee in white ($24.50 )
Forever 21 HBl Chastity Denim Short ($22.90
Urban Outfitters Sheer Tights (two for $10)
Frye Veronica Slouch Hoot ($328)

Side note: If you follow these general fashion rules, whether on
Valentines Day or in your everyday life, you (probably) can't go wrong:

Proportions
Don't wear a loose/oversized tee with baggy pants. What, are you going for the trash
bag look? It might work occasionally on the runway, but unless you're six-foot with legs
a mile long (and I go to Stanford, too, and I have seen people — you're probably not),
don't try to pull that one off. You'll look like a disaster.
If it's tight on top, be loose on the bottom. Vice versa. Such a simple rule, but you
can't believe how many girls 1 see walking around wearing tops and bottoms so tight
they might as well be in a bodysuit. And most girls don't look in a bodysuit, so
why are you torturing yourself? Clothes are supposed to flatter you — not choke you to
death and expose all of your unflattering parts to the world.

Leggings are NOT pants
I don't care if Lindsay Lohan wore leggings as pants for a whole month, she
looked ridiculous and stupid. Medium-length tops should never be paired with only
leggings. If you try to do it, you will look even worse than Lindsay. You might as well
be naked. If you insist on leggings, at least wear shorts or some sort of dress over it.

It's the clothes, stupid!

Bill Clinton won the presidency in 1992 with such an obvious slogan—"lt's
the economy, stupid!" Same goes for fashion. Of course, clothes should fit you —

I never said fit wasn't important — but equally important is the merit of the
clothes themselves. A beautiful sequin top will be that, whether it's on you or
not. Find clothes that are unique and beautiful in and of themselves and they
have a much greater chance of looking great on you.

As you can see, the Urban
Outfitters sheer tights are essential
to every one of these outfits. That's
because — let's face it, friends —
we live in California. It's not that
cold here. There's no need to wear
pants all the time. And even if it's
too chilly for tights, suck it up.

Quality matters
I love cheap clothes as much as the next girl. But don't ever
| sacrifice quality for quantity. Yes, quality is often expensive —
so wait for a sale, smart one. Or buy fewer clothes. Or
scrounge on E-Bay. Or learn how to navigate Forever 21,
H&M, Zara, etc. to find the right clothes.
A general observation: denim shorts, some jewelry, vests
and outerwear are sometimes great at cheap stores. Don't buy
clothes made of satin or cloth materials from cheap chains;
they'll fall apart in a tew days. But clothes made of firmer
material, such as thick denim vests or faux-fur, are great.
Forever 21 even sells some real leather, as does Zara.
Be a splash of daring
Aren't you a unique person? So show it! Fine, wear a T-shirt
and jeans—but add something interesting to spice it up. A
denim jacket with buttons and decorations. A studded belt.
An obnoxiously neon bracelet. It doesn't have to be some
thing epic, just something different. Make it your default so
when you are having a boring dressing day, you put it on and
I go.
See you around campus.
