Q&A"

with Producer Richard Suckle

Intermission (i): In a movie
of such epic proportions,
strewn with such complex
characters, I would imagine
that casting would be one of
the most crucial stages of pro
duction. How did you go
about choosing the cast, espe
cially the lead roles of Clive
Owen and Naomi Watts
(whom I thought did an
amazing job, by the way) and
what did you think of their
performance in the finished
product?
Richard Suckle (RS): Yeah, I
mean, I think we're all
extraordinarily happy with the
final product of [Clive and
Naomi's] performances, play
ing the characters of Salinger
and Whitman, respectively. As
for the process of casting
them, Clive was one of the
first names Chuck Roven, who
I produced the movie with,
and the director Tom Tykwer
discussed ... we were all big
fans of his work.
You know, Louis Salinger
is not your typical "action
hero." For lack of a better
word, he's an everyday, really
average kind of guy. We want
ed to create a character that's
not Jason Bourne; he's a guy
that works as a police officer
for Interpol . . . he's just an
everyday, every-man kind of
hero, and Clive has the ability
of_£ortraying that. Give's a

very ordinary guy; he's very
intense, which is what
Salinger is. He was really just
perfect. And we were in luck
because when we sent him the
script, he responded and said
yes, and that's how we got to
him.
As for Naomi, she was also
one of the first people we
thought about, and what we
liked about Naomi's role is it's
definitely a different character
than she's played, you know in
"King Kong," in "The Ring"
series, and it really was some
thing very different for her to
play an American, as well as
an American Assistant
District Attorney. We liked the
idea of the role flexing her
muscles and challenging her
as an actress. And we just
thought the pairing of her and
Clive, because we did get Clive
first, would be a good one.
And she as well — when she
read the script, responded and
was a big fan of it, as well as a
fan of our director Tom
Tykwer, so it was one of the
easier casting processes I've
gone through.
i: Watching the movie, I was
struck by how complex some
of the scenes were, such as the
fighting sequence in the
Guggenheim, where the entire
museum was virtually

destroyed.
During these
scenes, I
found myself
wondering,
"How did
they do that?"
So with that
in mind, I
wanted to ask
you — how
difficult was it
to produce
"The
International"
as compared
to other films
you have
done? Can

you talk to me a little bit
about how some of these
scenes were executed?
RS: Sure. I mean, you know
every movie has its chal
lenges. The situation we were
confronted with in "The
International" was mainly
one in which we had to figure
out how we were going to be
able to shoot all the different
locations, because it's very
costly when you go from one
location to the next and we
were shooting in Istanbul, in
Germany, Milan, New York,
we went to Lyon for a day ...
so the challenges, well, there
were many of them, but the
biggest challenge I would say
was trying to figure out how
to actually schedule the
movie where we could go to
all the various locations,
which we really had to. 1
mean there's no way to fake
Istanbul. The movie really
required us to go to all these
places, and it was an organic
part of the script, this jour
ney that Salinger goes on.
And as for the
Guggenheim, to give some
specifics on that, that posed
its own set of challenges. The
Guggenheim scene, which
was written into the script
before Tykwer came on as the
director, was somewhat of an
elephant in the room, so to
speak. I mean the
Guggenheim won't really just

let you walk in and film there
for a couple weeks. We had to
really figure out a way not
only to shoot there for the
day, which we did in January
of last year, but also to get
them to give us permission to
recreate the four levels of the
rotunda, as well as the lobby,
which we did in Germany.
What was great about
working with the
Guggenheim is since they arc
a museum about expression
and artistic vision, they were
very fond of the script and big
fans of Tom Tykwer, and they
were very excited to get
involved with this, and really
adaptable in their negotiating
of what day we could get in
there to shoot because they
only let you come in when
they're taking one of the
shows out and about to put
one in, and their exhibits are
sometimes booked for years
in advance, so we were lucky.
So we reconstructed four
levels of the rotunda in
Germany and we built the
lobby set there as well, so we
had everything we needed in
order to film a really rough
sequence, so that when we
went to New York we knew
exactly what we had to cap
ture because we only had the
real Guggenheim for the one
day in lanuary.
i: I personally loved how well
the movie captured some of
the major issues arising in
today's sociopolitical land
scape, namely the financing of
terrorism on a global scale. It
made for a really timely film, I
think. From your point of
view, how much of the movie
would you say is geared
towards alerting people to the
complexities of international
affairs as opposed to strictly
entertaining people (because
it was a brilliant thriller)?
RS: Well, as you know, we
want to make entertainment.
The movie was inspired,
though, by the BCCI banking
scandal, which inspired Eric

Singer, the writer, to come up
with the story. But once again,
first and foremost, we want to
make an entertainment film,
and hopefully we've done that
job. As for going beyond that.
. . look, we knew we wanted to
make a movie, and it was
going to be topical. We defi
nitely didn't know it was
going to be as topical as it is
today with the current finan
cial crisis; it's just at the fore
front of everything you read
in the newspapers and what
you see on television. So it's a
good combination, because
you want to make entertain
ing products as a producer,
but to make the movie rele
vant to today, that's never a
bad thing.
This movie has been in
development for six years,
actually, so we could have
never ever imagined that the
story would coincide so well
with what's happening at the
time the movie was released.
But we were always talking
about the ever-growing cor
porations, these sort of
monolithic corporations, that
seem to be getting larger and
larger, as most governments
around the world are getting
larger and larger, and the rela
tionship between these corpo
rations and the governments
and seemingly from that how
individuals are comparatively
feeling as though they arc get
ting smaller and smaller and
feeling as though they have no
ability to make a difference or
cause change. And that's the
matically what we were get
ting at when we were develop
ing the movie, with Salinger
being caught up in a sort of
David versus Goliath battle. I
just think it's unbelievably
coincidental that the movie is
now being released at a time
when the economic crisis,
which the movie is about,
couldn't be more relevant.

i: Due to the timeliness of the
film's storyline, there's been a

lot of hype surrounding the
movie even before its official
release. Given all this specula
tion on the subject, what I was
wondering is how much of the
movie is actually based on
fact, and how much of the plot
is actually drawn from real life
occurrences?
RS: Well to answer that ques
tion, it is completely a work of
fiction, there's no question
that is what we've created. But
the inspiration for the movie
was based on the BCCI bank
ing scandal of the late '70s,
'80s, and the early '90s. The
bank probably perpetrated the
largest financial fraud in the
history of man at the time.
That bank had its own securi
ty force, had its own army — I
mean, it was involved with a
lot of very dirty things.
So even though it's fiction,
it is inspired by something
real, and there's no reason to
think that banks aren't doing
similar things today. So, you
know, once again, it's really
about the fiction, but hopeful
ly it's provoking people to
think, "Well, what exactly is
my bank, or what exactly is my
government doing?" and to
ask questions that they may
have never really thought
about before. But now you
may be more interested, and

be more suspicious of these
activities, and this in turn may
make certain people or cer
tain institutions more
accountable for their actions.
1 mean, we sure as hell don't
trust our banks now.
As for websites,
www.stoptheinternational.co
m as well as the website for
the I BBC arc Web sites that we
created with a company called
42 Entertainment. And there
are what are known as
Alternate Reality Games.
These are a somewhat new
tool that filmmakers, as well
as other companies, are using
in their marketing, and we
thought they would be a real
ly interesting way to involve
people in the "fiction." I don't
know how deep you got into
it, but there was one compo
nent of the ARG called the
money tracker, which allows
you to take any currency you
may have and if you type in
the serial number it will tell
you for what purposes your
money has been used.
In a sense, people who
participate in these games are
sort of helping Salinger in his
quest. We actually created this
fiction so that people could
play along with Salinger and
sort of lead him up to the very
point where we meet him in
play along with Salinger and
sort of lead him up to the very
point where we meet him in
the opening scene of the
movie. In short, these ARGs
just represent more interest
ing and innovative ways to get
involved in the world of the
film.
i: Finally, having put so much
work into the film, what were
your favorite moments in the
movie?
RS: Well, 1 have several fond
moments. The movie is a very
serious film full of action, so
maybe because it's one of the
lighter if not the lightest
moment in the movie — I
really enjoyed when Clive's
character and the other two
detectives go to the orthope
dics' office where Clive tries to
force the doctor to cooperate
by concocting that story about
trying to find this man that
has killed several doctors in
Europe, and the doctor goes,
"Why would he want to kill
me? I'm an orthopedist!" I'm
particularly fond of that
moment because it just pro
vides a nice counterpoint to
the seriousness of the majori
ty of the film and it's nice to
see Salinger have a bit of a
sense of humor.
Really, there are a lot of
great moments in the film.
There is so much fantastic
architecture shown in the
film, which I'm sure you
enjoyed, and being able to
actually shoot in and around
the Grand Bazaar was
absolutely exhilarating. I
mean, really, the fact that we
could actually shoot on loca
tion in Istanbul and at the
Guggenheim was just amaz
ing! We got to shoot almost
everywhere that we wanted to
and everywhere that was writ
ten into the script, which is a
really rare occurrence in films
of this scale, actually, so that
was incredible!
i: Well it was wonderful talk
ing to you, Richard. Thank
you so much for your time
and I look forward to seeing
more of your work in the
future!
RS: Thank you. I'm glad you
enjoyed the film. Take care.
"The International" is in the
atres today.
