# Picturing Anonymity

### 
cc Every day we pass by hundreds of faces,
but these brief snapshots only leave us
with first impressions," declares the
poster currently displayed in the first floor of
Old Union, introducing an exhibit titled
"Picturing Identity." "They by no means
show us what truly defines a person: their
values, their experiences, their struggles."
It's true. We all encounter strangers
every day, but we will never speak to most of
them — much less get to know them inti
mately.
The exhibit currently displayed in Old
Union deals with this concept of unknown
strangers. Five student profiles are displayed,
each with a headshot and student-written
responses to prompts such as "What are bar

riers to discovery identities?" and "My com
munities at Stanford are..."
The profiles are nearly all nameless but
their handwritten answers reveal their deep
er personalities. The responses are both
philosophical and lighthearted; one student
writes that "falling in love" and "going to
Stanford" have most shaped his identity,
while another more flippantly says, "People
wouldn't think that I never learned how to
parallel park." If you invest half an hour to
read all the posters, you'll learn about a few
hidden facets of five strangers.
The exhibit is a class project from the
"Leading through Education, Activism, and
Diversity" (LEAD). Centered around the
concept of social change, LEAD intends to

develop leadership skills
amongst communities of color.
The LEAD students have been
working since October in small
groups on self-designed projects
for social change. Six students
(Stephanie Otani, Kevin Ho,
Naomi Schachter, Daniel
Limon, Edgar Navarro and
A'Lester Allen) collaborated to
create the "Picturing Identity"
exhibit.
So what kind of social
change were these students hop
ing to inspire in the viewers
passing through Old Union?
Stephanie Otani, one of the
exhibit's creators, described the
purpose of the exhibit as "to
inspire [people] to do a little
more introspection and ask
themselves those deep questions
that will help them figure out
who they are. And also to help
others discover that same thing
by asking questions of them."
The exhibit does inspire
viewers to answer the prompts
for themselves and compare
their own answers with the ones
provided by the nameless stu
dents. Through that process,
visitors might realize that they
are not so isolated and different

from the strangers they pass by
every day after all.
The students' second goal
of conversation, however, is lost
in the exhibit; they've included a
comment book for anonymous
reactions, but there's no real
space for dialogue about the
issues that the exhibit raises —
namely, our relationships with
strangers, and our own degree
of self-knowledge.
One of the anonymous
commentators wrote of the
exhibit, "Moving? Changing?
Probably not. But a neat concept
to toy with, and maybe present
ed in a different context or with
higher stakes of gravity, it would
recognize its potential." A stage
for real conversation, not just
internal reflection, might add
another level of relevance to an
already personally affecting
exhibit.
"Picturing Identity" runs
through Sunday on the first
floor of Old Union.
