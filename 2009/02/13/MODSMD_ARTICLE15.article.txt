"They control your money. They control your govern
ment. They control your life. And everybody pays."
For generations people have been putting their
faith and money in the bank. Banks have become more
or less synonymous with security ... or so we thought.
Columbia Pictures' upcoming thriller "The
International" questions that deep-rooted idea of bank
security. Produced by film gurus Richard Suckle and
Chuck Roven and directed under the expertise of Tom
Tykwer, this fast-paced film is nothing short of electri
fying.
The plot goes something like this: Interpol agent
Louis Salinger (Clive Owen) and Manhattan Assistant
District Attorney Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts)
engage in a battle to put an end to the illicit activities
of The International Bank of Business and Credit (The
I BBC). The deeper they are drawn into the struggle,
however, the more Salinger and Whitman realize how
formidable their opponent is. As agent Salinger puts it,
"Everyone who has ever been in a position to move
against this bank has either ended up dead or disap
peared."
Racing through Berlin, Milan, New York and even
the far reaches of Istanbul in their quest to stop the
bank, the two agents face obstacle after obstacle.
Potential witnesses to the atrocities committed by the
I BBC mysteriously die in car crashes, sympathetic
politicians are brutally assassinated and anyone who
gets close to uncovering evidence of the illegal activi
ties of the bank suddenly vanishes. Despite these chal
lenges, Salinger and Whitman remain relentless in
their pursuit of the villainous leaders of the all-power
ful bank that is charged with financing the evils of the
modern world.
Inspired by their resolve, the audience follows the
dynamic duo with bated breath as they get closer and
closer to bringing the miscreant bank to justice. From
the gripping beginning to the bitter end, the mind-

boggling twists, scenic vistas, charismatic cast and
flawless cinematography are guaranteed to keep the
viewers quite literally on the edges of their seats.
Far more than just a heart-pounding thriller, "The
International" explores not just the far reaches of the
physical world but also the limits of our minds. What
if these institutions that we have so long equated with
security and trust are funding the very operations that
threaten our security? What if the bank, and not the
government, controls the political climate in which we
live? From Hamas to the CIA, the organizations that
dominate our lives are both explicitly and subcon
sciously fueled by one thing — money. Viewing
Salinger and Whitman's adventures, we are strung
along on this frenzied chase as we follow the trail of
our misused money.
Ultimately, the team comes to realize that despite
their best efforts, they cannot stop the bank, for it is the
institution itself that is inherently corrupt, not just the
people running it. As Skarssen, the founder of the
IHBC, reminds Salinger in their thrilling final con
frontation: "You will accomplish nothing by killing me.
If you kill me, there will just be 100 other bankers to
replace me." Despite the dark truth of the banker's
statement, Salinger and Whitman's fortitude proves to
us that it is always worth taking a stand and fighting for
what we believe in. More importantly, the film also
encourages us to always question the complexities of
our world.
So the next time you make a trip to the bank, take
a moment to wonder where exactly your money — the
money you always believed to be so safe — is actually
going. You never know; the possibilities may surprise
you.
