# "SHOPAHOLIC": Most untimely movie of the year
## 
### 
Originally a huge fan of Isla Fisher and
Sophie Kinsella's books, I was more
than excited to see "Confessions of a
Shopaholic," the anti-recession, pro-spending
craze romantic comedy out in theatres today.
However, like a rejected credit-card user, I was

hugely disappointed with the final results.
Rebecca Bloomwater (Fisher), the
film's/book series' protagonist, is a hybrid of
Elle Woods ("Legally Blonde") and Carrie
Bradshaw ("Sex and the City")...except infi
nitely less intelligent than those two. Rebecca

flounces around on screen, up to her eyeballs
in debt, purchasing designer clothes on a
whim. While viewers may have been able to
relate to Rebecca during economic booms, in
today's recession, the character seems
absolutely absurd and completely out of
touch with the real world. Still, there's so
much more wrong with this movie than the
distastefulness of Rebecca's spending.
The overarching theme of
"Shopaholic" is an addiction to spending, but
the movie's handling of it turns a serious issue
into a total mockery. Much of the plot's sus
pense revolves around a debt collector simply
trying to do his job. Yet the filmmakers pres
ent him as an evil man looking to ruin peo
ples' lives. In the book, Derek Smeath, the
debt collector, is only appears in letters and
phone calls, but on screen, he's a bulldog
esque nerd, with makeup and costume for the
audience to instantly hate him. Bloomwater is
$16,000 in debt for crying out loud! Keep in
mind, this is not from spending on important
things; it's from spending on designer clothes.
That aside, Bloomwater fancies her
self a journalist, and in order to reach the
fashion magazine of her dreams, she applies
for a column at Successful Savings magazine.

Oh, the irony! Her boss turns out to be a dap
per gentleman, played by Hugh Dancy, who is
basically a younger version of Hugh Grant.
That doesn't help, though:
Bloomwater is one of the most ridiculous
characters in a romantic comedy yet, which is
certainly saying something. Fisher attempts to
elicit laughter solely on clueless lines and
attempts at slapstick. Her character never
redeems herself, and though her magazine
column becomes hugely successful, the audi
ence never gets to read or hear any pieces of it.
We are left in disbelief as high-powered exec
utives are all stunned and impressed with
Bloomwood's brilliance, while to the rest of
us, she seems completely incompetent.
In fact, Rebecca seems downright
crazy. She is so addicted to shopping that
mannequins talk to her and convince her to
buy more clothing. Fisher's character only
seems slightly less goofy when put on screen
next to her wealthy roommate, played by
Krysten Ritter. Both are laughable in a way the
screenwriters did not intend them to be. The
only redeeming thing about Rebecca is Fisher.
Though her character is nothing short of a
