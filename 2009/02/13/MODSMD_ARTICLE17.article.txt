# "The Reader": This year's most illiterate movie
## 
### 
Continuing along with our
preparation for the Oscars,
this week Intermission took
a look at Kate Winslet's latest
drama, "The Reader." Not to be con
fused with another Winslet-helmed
movie currently out in theatres
("Revolutionary Road"), "The
Reader" has garnered considerable
critical buzz — it has been nomi
nated for five Oscars, including Best
Picture and Best Actress (Winslct).
Directed by Stephen Daldry
("The Hours") and based on the
book of the same name, the film
begins like almost any other forbid
den romance set in pre-WWII
Germany. A 15-year-old Michael
Berg, played by German actor
David Kross, stumbles into an alley
while sick and it is there he meets
the much older Hannah Schmitz
(Winslet). Here, the soft-spoken
Hannah helps take care of Michael
before sending him home. Like all
hormonal teenagers, Michael quick
ly develops a schoolboy crush on his
savior; however, this crush quickly
turns into something much more
when Hannah enters into a sexual
relationship with Michael. From
first glance this seems like a purely
fantastical situation: Michael gets to
live the fantasy of sleeping with an
older woman while Hannah
receives undying attention from a
younger boy.
Regardless of their ages, their
relationship blossoms on screen.
The use of cinematography here

helps to really highlight the soft
and quiet emotions that brew in
Hannah's tiny apartment, where
the two spend most of their time.
As time passes, their relationship
becomes much more than just sex,
as we realize that Hannah has an
unquenchable interest in literature,
making Michael constantly read to
her. Whether or not you actually
catch this early on in the film (there
are subtle and not-so-subtle clues),
Hannah is illiterate, which adds
another level of quiet complexity
between the characters.
Then, just when things arc
starting to seem "normal" between
the couple, Hannah packs up her
belongings and leaves without so
much as a word to her young lover.
Needless to say, Michael is heart
broken, but manages to move on
with the rest of his life. This point is
where I start having issues with the
film. Up to this point, the movie
had been focused on a secret rela
tionship — but then the story
jumps forward a few years and the
next thing we know, Michael is in
law school, where the latter half of
the story takes place.
Instead of a romantic drama,
the film turns into a heated court
case surrounding the conviction of
ex-Nazi soldiers post-WWII. This
love story/court drama flip might
be a little jarring to some viewers,
but it is by no means a deal break
er. In fact, we quickly become emo
tionally invested when we discover
that Hannah is one of the ex-sol
diers on trial. In Hannah's defense,
she wasn't an actual Nazi soldier

per se; she was just a guard at one of
the concentration camps. The most
gut-wrenching part of all of this is
that Hannah only became a guard
because it was one of the only jobs
available that didn't require any
kind of literacy skills.
The tensions build lip during
the trial as Michael must sit back
and helplessly watch the woman
that he loves go through this ordeal.
All of this is executed beautifully,
making the final verdict at the trial
all the more tragic and powerful.
Before moving on with the
plot, I want to address some of the
current critics' concerns about this
film. Some critics condemn "The
Reader" because it focuses all of its
attention on Hannah, seemingly

glossing over the atrocities of WWII
and the Nazis. Even though the
attention here indeed is on I lannah,
I will argue that this is how it should
be. This entire film is about the
tragic relationship between Michacl
and Hannah. If this film were to
focus on WWII and the Nazis, it
would be a whole different movie,
dealing with an entirely different
subject. The fact that we actually get
to see and learn why Hannah
became a Nazi —as well as her
remorse after the fact — is a per
spective we rarely think about when
watching anything WWII-related.
Top this unconventional topic off
with a stellar performance from
Winslet, and you have an excellent
Oscar contender on your hands.

Of course, whether or not I
think this film deserves to win Best
Picture is another story altogether
as there is a plethora of outstanding
movies all vying for Oscar. At the
end of the day, however, if you're
interested in shedding a tear or two,
or maybe just watching a movie
with pro-literacy overtones, then
"The Reader" is worth the trip to
the theater.
If you like to read, go see this
movie! ... Or maybe read the book
it's based on first?
