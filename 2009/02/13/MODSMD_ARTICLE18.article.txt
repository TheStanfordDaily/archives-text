# Roxy gives ... and recieves
## 
### 
Saturday marks the most horrifying day of the year for single women
everywhere, unless you're a single woman whose paycheck comes from
an industry that sells vibrators or chocolate. While Roxy sympathizes
with women shouting "Love actually is so not all around" at their televi
sions, she faces a different dilemma: To give or to receive?
No, not that dilemma â€” that's for another time.

Finding the right gift for your significant other is no small task,
and you should probably give him or her some tips for your gift as well.
There are some obvious don'ts: Don't give your girlfriend that size-zero
corset or give your boyfriend a pack of double extra-large condoms unless
you want to make a Valentine's card for your right hand. Roxy's parents

somehow survived the Valentine's Day when her father gave her moth-

er a stud finder. (Seriously, not kidding.) Chances are you won't be
that lucky.

If you can master the art of giving, there's a good
chance your significant other will master it too. (Pun intend
ed this time.) This in mind, Ms. Sass has decided to warn i

her readers about some of the gift mistakes that are surely
to leave them alone in their rooms Googling "inflatable
sheep." ,

Inflatable Sheep

Actually, just make that inflatable anything.
Your significant other wants to see things expand on
Valentine's Day, but anything part of a Little Bo Peep
costume is not among them.

Flowers and Chocolate
Nothing says romance like hay fever and weight gain. Frankly,
you don't want your significant other's mouth too occupied on

Valentine's Day, and let's face it: Godiva tastes better than anything else you
can put in there.

Venus Flytrap
The idea of a flower eating what goes inside it doesn't ring well
with guys (or girls) on any day of the year. You might as well buy him a copy
of "Teeth" for a romantic cuddle.
Vibrator
This is essentially like giving your girlfriend Brad Pitt for
Valentine's Day. When it comes down to you and Brad Pitt, Brad Pitt will
always get the girl.
Slug Porn

Sure, you like it wet and slimy, but not this wet and slimy.
When a slug is looking for a partner, it gives its trail of
slime a special taste to entice the females. Frankly, we

on't need more trails of who-knows-what on Row
furniture. (Check out slug sex on You Tube if
you're bored. Or the kind of person who hangs
out at the Stanford Red Barn "for fun")

Bowling Ball

Not only is this sure to conjure up
inadequacy issues, but let's face it: This isn't
where you want his fingers on Feb. 14.

Seven-Foot Nude Oil Painting of His Dead
Grandmother

There's nothing else to get him down (literally)
like a naked picture of his dead grandmother. And if your
boyfriend likes this gift, we 11... maybe you should buy him a
Venus Flytrap.
