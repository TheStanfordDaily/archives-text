# Movie Review
## 
### 
Remakes are a great concept. Many of
the must-see "classic" films tend to be
made before most of us college folk
were even born. Because of this, revamping an
old movie to appeal to today's generation
seems like a great recycling technique ... but
only if it is done right.
From what I've seen, horror films tend to
go through this remake process more than the
films in any other genre. Thankfully, there have
been some half-decent films from this batch,
including the likes of "Texas Chainsaw
Massacre," "The Amityville Horror" and
"Dawn of the Dead."
The latest remake being tossed our way —
"Friday the 13th" — comes from producer
Michael Bay ("Texas Chainsaw Massacre").
However, is the infamous legend of Jason
Voorhees worthy of a resurrection?
Unfortunately, I have to give that question a
big no.
"Friday the 13th" is a franchise that began
in the 1980s and has been vastly popular since.
However, unlike the original '80s version, in
which the entire film was used to introduce the

legend behind Jason, this version basically
condenses all of that into a hurried opening
sequence. If you're new to the lore, here's a
summary: As a young boy, Jason drowns at
Camp Crystal Lake due to the negligence of
his counselors. His mother then goes AWOL,
murdering all of the counselors before being
decapitated by the sole surviving camp coun
selor. To no one's surprise, Jason does not end
up drowning and in loving vengeance decides
to take up his mother's cause ... or machete,
I should say.
Unfortunately, this remake completely
fails; it relies on the most formulaic elements
ever conceived in a horror film. Instead of a
twisted story about a mother seeking
vengeance, we instead get a typical story
about a handful of oversexed, rambunctious
college kids that go camping in Jason's neigh
borhood, only to get murdered one by one.
The only deviation from the formulaic plot
comes in the form of Clay (Jared Padalecki),
who meets the group while looking for his sis
ter who went missing a month earlier.
Clay's presence is just about the most

original part of the film's storylines, though;
the movie quickly diminishes into a typical
slasher flick which sets up each character's
murder at the hand of lason — all of which
are done in boring, unimaginative ways.
Everyone knows horror films are often about
blood and death, which means that movie
directors must make these scenes unique and
interesting to captivate the audience. "Friday
the 13th" completely fails in imagination,
however: lason effortlessly kills his victims,
who barely put up a fight or have a chance —
it's just too easy.
Besides the unimaginativeness of the
killings, this remake is also missing another
crucial aspect: motivation. Where's the heart
and reason behind all of the murders — or
behind the entire movie, for that matter? All
of Jason's killings are pointless, making the
audience feel that he is killing for killing's
sake, rather than to avenge his mother. The

only part in the film when
Jason's vengeful motiva
tions are slightly touched
upon is when he captures
Whitney, Clay's sister. Even
then, however, Jason's rea
sons for capturing her are
never explained, and
Whitney eventually ends
up just another slaugh
tered character in the film.
Also typical for slasher
movies, the acting in
"Friday the 13th" is

abysmal, with a cast consisting mostly of
unknown actors. The most recognized actor
of the bunch is lared Padalecki
("Supernatural"), but even he cannot infuse
his character with any personality; at the end
of the day, his character is one-dimensional.
The "Friday the 13th" franchise is one of
Americas most successful horror series.
Although its successes definitely merit a
remake, this most recent attempt completely
fails in bringing Jason back from the dead.
Instead of witnessing us the birth of a haunt
ingly brutal killer, we get a run-of-the-mill
horror flick. The horror "classic" gets dumb
ed down into nothing more than a mediocre
teen slasher. Sorry, Jason — maybe next time.
