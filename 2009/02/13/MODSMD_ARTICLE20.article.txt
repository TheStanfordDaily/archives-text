# mayfield bakes up hot spot
## 
### 
Stanford students with an affinity
for rustic California cuisine may
have found their haven in
Mayfield Bakery and Cafe, opening this
week in the Town and Country shop
ping center.
The bakery end of the Mayfield
Bakery and Cafe may have a small
storefront — no study space a la Coupa
or Starbucks — but the variety of
offerings is incomparable and makes
this store a must-stop for those looking
for tasty treats, if not a hangout space.
Coffee fanatics will be impressed by
Mayfield's selection, made with fair
trade beans from around the world and
brewed within 48 hours of roasting.
The tea selection is earth-friendly and
diverse, and hot chocolates and mochas
come adorned with homemade marsh
mallows. Pastries are delicious and
deceptively simple: The carrot cake is
no-frills, but tastes exactly like carrot
cake should taste; it's moist, with the
icing smooth and not overly sweet. A
dusting of fleur-de-sel (read: coarse,
fancy salt) makes a rich but basic
chocolate torte delectably complicated.
Over at the Cafe side, accessed
through a separate entrance, the mood
is relaxed but very Palo Alto.

Whitewashed railroad ties support the
ceiling, and butcher paper and votives
top the tables. The menu, like the pas
tries next door, is simple and elegant,
with many dishes coming straight
from the wood-burning oven. The
crispy and sweet shrimp appetizer
comes with little chunks of fried
bacon — this "meatatarian" diner
thought she had died and gone to
heaven. For those who are vegetarian,
do not fear: The bruschetta with pick
led peppers is excellent, and the menu
offers several other enticing veggie
friendly options. For those under 21, a
selection of old-school, glass-bottle
sodas and floats should keep you con
tent until you're ready to dive into the
wine list. Dinner prices top out at over
$20 for entrees — making Mayfield
probably more of a special occasion
locale than an everyday eatery for col
lege students — but such prices are
well within budgets for a birthday or
anniversary. Brunch, currently on
weekends only (but will be offered
daily in a month's time), sounds
delectable and falls at a slightly lower
price point. I, for one, will be making
a trip back almost exclusively to try
the ricotta pancakes with blood
orange butter.
Store co-owner Tim Stannard
says Mayfield is designed as a "book

end to the Village Pub," which is "neigh
borhood, but high end." Stannard claims
the Bacchus Management Group wanted
to offer a restaurant where parents could
take their children and still grab a glass
of wine and a decent meal. This mental
ity makes Mayfield Bakery and Cafe a
welcoming place for college students
too, who — let's face it — don't exactly
get taken out to fancy restaurants very
much (I'll leave it up to you, dear reader,
to debate why).
My only concern for Mavfield
Bakery and Cafe is that it has bitten off a
lot to chew, including baking bread for
the entire restaurant group. It remains to
be seen how long it will take for the
organization to run smoothly. Still, the
restaurant's focus on organic, sustain
able and meaningful ingredients —an
ethos that shows up in everything from
varietal coffees to its parent company's
organic farm — should make the learn
ing curve worthwhile. If you're willing to
wait — which I hope you are —
Mayfield Bakery and Cafe promises to
deliver.
The new Town and Country desti
nation is open weekdays for lunch and
dinner, as well as weekends for brunch,
lunch and dinner.
