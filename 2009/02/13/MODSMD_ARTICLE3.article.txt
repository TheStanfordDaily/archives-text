## VALENTINE'S DAY PLAYLIST 
### 
Remember that post-breakup montage
in "Say Anything"? The one with John
Cusack playing a really bad l Bos song on
a really big '80s boombox? The scene wnere
he wins back his ex-girlfriend through the
power of music 7. Well, this Valentine's Day, you
too can put music to use in your love life —
make a romantic mix tape!
Mix tapes are the perfect gift: They're
thoughtful, neatly encapsulate emotions and
memories and they are super cheap. Here are
some song suggestions to get you started on
making mix tapes for that special someone ..
Playlist Suggestion #1:
"I'm Dating a Hipster"
Don't expect to get a romantic rise out of your hipster beau this
Valentine's Day — excitemcnt and pleasure are just not that
cool. You can expect, however, to soften their American
Apparel-clad heart through the power of obscure bands. Burn
these particular tracks onto a CD and you may just end up fog
ging up your hipster lover's ironic nerd glasses this weekend.
"Paris" by Friendly Fires
This tune gets the love party started. Friendly Fires, a British
band, stitches indie pop hooks with dance-floor beats. "One
day, we're going to live in Paris/I promise/I'm on it.. " they
sing to a lover. Perfect mix of yearning and optimism, but with
a touch of uncertainty.
"Beat Flealth Life and Fire" by Thao with The Get Down Stay
Down
This song shuffles along with acoustic guitars and some under
stated electric guitar. The mood is bittersweet — the narrator is
worried that his love may be one-sided. Regardless, the song
exudes the warmth of the narrator's feelings.
"Oviedo" by Blind Pilot
This Portland band is on the verge of getting big, so you have to
appreciate their music while they're still relatively unknown.
This tune channels fragile longing through some shakers, guitar
and lyrics about bars.

Playlist Suggestion #2:
"I'm dating a Generation X-er"
So, you're dating somebody in their 30's. If you're an undergrad
uate, that's kind of weird. But, hey — the heart wants what it
wants ... or the wallet wants what it wants. At least, so I'm told.
Anyways, Generation X came of age in the late 1980s and early
19905, so their particularly perfect mix tape should include a
healthy dose of grunge, sultry R&B, Melissa Etheridge and these
tracks:
"Black Gold" by Soul Asylum
To be honest, I'm not sure what's going on with this song. It's
like John Mellencamp and Nirvana combined with the worst
band in the world. Moreover, there is some political message
buried inside of its distorted guitars — oil is bad, the first
President Bush is really mean, O.J. is innocent... or something
like that.
"On Bended Knee" by Boyz II Men
Ah, Boyz II Men — the staple band of cheesy weddings and
awkward middle school dances. Throw this track on the stereo
and your Gen X partner will be transformed back to their 1993
prom, minus parachute pants and fades.
"Only One Road" by Celine Dion
This 1994 song sure is a tearjerker. It's all about memories,
standing tall and Celine Dion's diva stage moves. Nobody goes
big like Celine.

Playlist #3 Suggestion:
Dating an Emo Kid
Sure, the genre and trend of emo is almost dead, but this
decades-long trend has a long catalogue of songs, some of
which are still alive and kicking! If, for some reason, you are
dating an emo kid, tell them to latch onto a new trend. If that
doesn't work, however, then you should make this mix tape for
Valentine's Day to cheer them up:
"Vampires Will Never Hurt You" by My Chemical Romance
Now that is a first class Valentine's Day promise. Who wants to
be hurt by vampires? Nobody, except maybe "Twilight" fans.
Show your undying allegiance through this classic emo tune.
"Deeper Than Inside" by Rites of Spring
This band basically invented emo in the 1980s. Hark back to the
slashing guitars and face-melting screams of the emo golden
age through Rites of Spring.
"Great Romances of the 20th Century" by Taking Back Sunday
This song starts off with a spoken word intro about how "a
beautiful girl can make you dizzy." At least this is true.
Playlist #4: "I'm dating somebody that dances all the time"
If your special person just cannot stop dancing, then don't run
the risk of dehydration and exhaustion and seek medical help
immediately. In the meantime, help them groove through the
power of pop.
"Just Dance" by Lady Gaga
This is probably the life motto of your lover. This song will
speak to them with lyrics like, "Wish I could I shut my playboy
mouth."
"I'm Blue" by Eiffel 65
The best Euro-pop one hit wonder of the 19905. (That's high
praise.)
"Single Ladies" by Beyonce/Sasha Fierce
If your lover is really a dancer, then they should have memo
rized the dance to "Single Ladies." Even little girls on You Tube
know those moves. Sure, the song is about a breakup, but your
partner will only hear the stuttered bass line. It's a good thing
the man didn't put a ring on Beyonce's finger— now we have
this song to groove to.
