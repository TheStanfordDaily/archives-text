### STARSKY COX 
This book has been on
my shelf for years and has
been worn down so much
that it shows clear signs of
bent pages and a broken
spine. This hook is a very
valuable guide into under
standing the personalities of
a boyfriend, girlfriend,
potential love interest or even
"just a friend." "Sextrology"
has its basis in the zodiac
signs, but don't lump it in

with the horoscopes you find
in newspapers and online â€”
this book includes an accurate
and thorough examination of
signs based on birth date, gen
der and sexual orientation.
For example, Scorpio boy is
not at all the same as Scorpio
girl.
Every chapter is very
informative and never boring
because the author is funny at
the right parts all the while

proving her knowledgeable
background in the deeply
rooted world of astrology.
Even if you don't believe in all
that astrology, you likely will
after assessing the chapter on
your own astrological sign.
Nine out of 10 people who
read my copy of the book
instantly become believers;
the thorough descriptions are
generally spot on.
Ultimately, however, the

thing that makes "Sextrology"
a perfect reference for your
collection is evident in the
title. The astrological analysis
of everyone's sexual needs
based on a zodiac sign is an
unconventional, interesting,
and potentially enlightening
insight into your partner or
crush. It's almost as if you can
read their minds.
