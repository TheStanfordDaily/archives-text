This option may he the
most well-known of the four
sex books Intermission
reviews this issue. This "play
hook" has been gaining sig
nificant popularity in the last
few years disguised as an
updated, Westernized version
of the Kama Sutra. The book
chronicles and describes 365
sex positions, one to be per

formed each day of the year.
Most of the positions arc het
ero-normative, but there arc a
few same-sex forays scattered
throughout the handbook.
The positions arc all incredi
bly interesting, and even if
some positions seem to be
physically impossible, this
book nevertheless docs a very
good job of providing a com

prehensive handbook.
An added bonus: Sex
position descriptions note the
calorics burned by both the
engaged male and female, as
well as possible hazards of
and equipment necessary to
accomplish each position.
The easy, journal style of the
handbook also allows the
reader to take note of posi-

tions tested in the past and
record whether they were
enjoyable. And the best part?
Not only is the "Position of
the Day Playbook" a fun and
mind-bending account of
every position under the sun,
but it's also portable.
