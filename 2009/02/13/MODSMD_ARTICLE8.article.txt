# Urban Tantra: Sacred Sex for the 21st Century
## 
### BARBARA CARALLE 
" This book, which is writ
ten in a very easily understood
style, analyzes sex through an
Eastern perspective. Since its
publication, the book has had
a strong influence in the New
Age religion that is so hip
these days. This untraditional
take on Tantric sex teaches
you many new techniques —
everything from prolonging

orgasm all the way to breath
ing exercises designed to turn
you on. The author has a very
"interesting" background:
She's worked as a stripper,
prostitute, and sex coach;
with a resume like that, she's
sure to write a spell-binding
sex book.
"Urban Tantra" is such a
fun and titillating read — it

has in-depth instructions on
how to achieve the elusive
"breath orgasm." Who knew
you could orgasm just by
breathing 7 - This book has
loads of exercises thai seem
ridiculous but may really
improve your sex life if you
open your mind to them. This
sexual read does not display
an evident emphasis on sexu-

al preference, so Intermission
is confident that anybody can
and will enjoy this foray into
Eastern religion.
