# V-DAY: A DAY FOR LOVE...AND GLUTTONY
## Aphrodisiac foods: sure to whet your appetite! 
### 
Certain foods
were renowned
in the ancient

world for their libido-

enhancing properties pri-

marily because they possessed a sug-

gestive shape or texture. For example, the

Aztecs called avocados "testicle fruit"

because of their form. The fruit's allure was

so powerfully regarded that virgin girls were

prohibited from venturing outside while the

phallic fruit was being harvested.

With today's technology and expanded knowledge about
nutrition, we now know that there may actually be some
truth to the claims behind alleged food aphrodisiacs. So if
you're looking to seduce that special someone, read on to
find out more about just what should be included in a

libido-enhancing candlelit dinner for two.

Asparagus
This vegetable's evocative figure was long
thought to be a powerful aphrodisiac in the

ancient world, and modern nutri
tionists admit that the excellent
source of Vitamin E may in fact
encourage sex hormone pro
duction.

Oysters
Perhaps the quintessential aphrodisiac, oysters contain a
mineral that aids in the making of testosterone: zinc.
Historical figures like Casanova noticed an apparently strik
ing resemblance between the shellfish and the female vagina
and consequently consumed as many as 100 per day. One of
Casanova's signature moves to attract the ladies? Sliding oys
ters from his lips into the mouth of a young virgin.

Chili peppers

Spicy food may lead to an even spicier love life thanks to the
nerve-stimulating properties of capsaicin. This chemical,
found in spicy foods like peppers and curries, elevates the
heart rate and promotes the release of endorphins, conse
quently producing a tame body high to get you, or your sig
nificant other, in the mood.

Chocolate

Besides its silky texture and rich, multidi
mensional taste, chocolate contains

mphenylethylamine. Considered the "love
chemical" by many researchers, phenylethy-

lamine has a similar effect to endorphins in

that it both eases and invigorates the body, produc
ing a subtle but relaxing high.

Celery
It may lack calories, but this watery vegetable is actually a
source of androsterone. This hormone is usually produced in
males but stimulates sexual arousal in females.
Nuts
Gingko nuts continue to be used in Chinese herbal medicine
today as a treatment for sexual dysfunction because their
consumption results in the release of nitric oxide, which
widens blood vessels in the genitals. (Disclaimer: should not
be used by those on blood-thinning medications)
Bananas
... Is an explanation really necessary?
You've heard that the way to a man's heart is through his
stomach, and today's knowledge about vitamins and miner
als actually gives the properties of so-called "aphrodisiac

Ifoods" some credence. Of course, only you
and your valentine can determine just how

effective these libido-enhancing foods

really are.
