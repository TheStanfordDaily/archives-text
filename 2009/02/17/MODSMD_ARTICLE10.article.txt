## Editorial HPAC, PM program cuts an appropriate decision 
### 
Over the course of the next couple
months, departments around the Uni
versity will lace budget cuts for the
coming year. ()ne of the first casualties of the
funding decline was announced earlier this
month when VPUH reported that it is termi
nating the head peer academic counselor
(HPAC) and peer mentor (PM) programs, as
well as cutting hack significantly on Admit
Weekend and New Student Orientation
(NSO) festivities.
While the loss of HPACs and PMs is re
grettable. the programs were not reaching
their full potential and it was the best place to
begin trimming the budget. The editorial
board only regrets that students were mostly
excluded from this decision.
The l IPAC and I'M programs played two
major roles on campus, providing both aca
demic leadership opportunities for upper
classmen. and additional academic support
for freshmen. But there are a whole host of
leadership opportunities available to stu
dents at Stanford, particularly in academic
fields. With over 650 voluntary student organ
izations. almost all of which offer leadership
positions to brilliant Stanford students, it's
not difficult to find some way to take a leader
ship role on campus. And there are also a
plethora of academic resources available to
students, especially freshmen.
Between academic advisors.the Freshman
Dean s ()ffice and residential academic direc
tors, there are plenty of resources available to
help students plan classcs and find mentors
some individual departments, like human
biology.even have their own student advisors.
While it was nice having more approach
able undergraduate "peers" like the PMs or
I IPAC s to go to for academic advice, there is
a sufficient number of resources so that they
will not be sorely missed.
Iliough not necessarily academically fo
cused, the large number of dorm staff in every
freshman dorm are yet another resource. As
far back as two years ago. some 11PA(' spots
were being removed to make way for addi
tional RAs in about half of the freshman
dorms, and freshmen may end up being better
served with a better trained, more versatile
dorm stall.
Meanwhile, peer mentors although

useful during NSO. particularly for first-time
faculty advisors â€” were openly mocked in
"(iaieties" this year, in which a cast member
playing a PM informed his freshmen, '111
make you brownies your first week, and then
you'll never hear from me again."
Aside from these criticism, both the
HPAC and PM programs were somewhat
useful, but the editorial board acknowledges
that VPI JF. is required to cut 10 percent of its
budget by next year, and this is as good place
as any to begin.
The decision to cut programming from
Admit Weekend and NSO. however, is hard
er to swallow. True, the schedules for both
events are packed, and even cutting half of
the programs would leave a very full weekend
and week, respectively. Even so. the editorial
board would like to stress how crucial a well
run Admit Weekend is to attracting a good
freshman class.
While the California sun does a lot of the
work for us. showing an incredibly diverse
group of high-school seniors, a great time is
essential to preserving high matriculation
rates. While no specific cuts from either
Admit Weekend or NSO have been an
nounced yet. it will be interesting to see what
impact this has on matriculation.
Additionally, as NSO is such a formative
experience in every Stanford student's life,
significantly cutting programming could put a
damper on the freshman experience as a
whole. We await news on which programs will
face the axe and hope the cuts will be made
carefully.
But ultimately, the editorial hoard's
biggest complaint about these cuts has to do
with the lack of transparency and student
input, (he ASSU made an admirable push to
collect student input on budget cuts and pres
ent it totheadministration.but the VPUK de
cisions were made with seemingly minimal
student consultation.
While we are confident that Admit Week
end will be a success.and Stanford will contin
ue to be (objectively) the best university in
the world, we would like to see more student
involvement in this process as VPI 11-, and
other I Jniversity departments decide what to
cut next.
