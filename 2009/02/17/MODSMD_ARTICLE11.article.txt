# Crime and Punishment
## Emily Grubert Refine my argument 
### 
M"y problem set asks me to calculate my
carbon footprint, then look at the
.breakdown and identity live things I
could do to meaningfully reduce it. So I
looked, and I was not surprised to see that
about 70 percent of what was left was due to
my use ol transportation. I fell really bad
about writing "visit my family less" on my
problem set though.and the last time I tried to
cut back on emissions from going to Con
necticut, it took me four days to get home. (If
you have the time. Anilrak is pretty rad.Just
make sure you bring more than one box of
Raisin Bran ) Anyway. I felt really bad about
all the little balloons lull ol C'() 2 that this foot
print calculator showed me standing next to.
so I tried to do penance by not turning on my
heater. I urns out it was around 41 degrees
that night, and now I'd love to borrow some
decongestant if you have any.
Alright. I'm not going to solve my trans
portation problem by trying to make up for it
in other ways. So let's examine how we can
deal with it on its own terms.
ITie issue with transportation.at least in the
I Inited States, is largely a problem of system
design, living to target transportation means
trying to coordinate the actions of literally mil
lions of end users who are limited by what a
relatively unplanned system makes available.
' Hi is means people can basically either use an
oil derived product (gasoline or diesel) or be
one of those magnificent hippies who start
cars with screwdrivers and try to find waste
vegetable oil at restaurants to make into
biodiesel. I he system resembles the electric
power sector in that millions of end users are
consuming whatever electricity they are pro
vided with, but there is a very important dis
tinction: electricity supply, including fuel di
versification. is very carefully planned.
Power is supplied by and/or through utili
ties, which are subject to heavy regulation by
the state, have obligations to supply a certain
volume of power at any given time and make
huge infrastructural investments that essen
tially close the industry to competition. I'rans
porlation doesn't have the equivalent ol a
transportation utility, a natural monopoly
that is tightly controlled by the state and man
ages, plans for and prov ides fuels. What it does
have are refineries, which are typically local
i/ed industrial facilities subjected to stringent
controls by the regional government (the May
Area, for example, has four). Intrv into the
refining business is nearly impossible due to

the difficulty of siting refineries, the enor
mous upfront costs and the fact that existing
refineries have obligations to supply certain
amounts of petroleum-based fuel to meet an
ticipated demand. ITiese refineries are thus
managing and supplying fuels, but they are
not asked to be planners. Why is this impor
tant? Without a central planning institution,
there is little to no chance that alternative
transport fuels will make a smooth entry into
the market at any point.
Carmakers won't introduce cars that can't
be fueled: private enterprise will not provide
fuels that cars can't use. When people try to
change the system from the ground up. we run
into problems like. "I low do you apply a gas
tax to alternative fuels?" — important be
cause this keeps the highway system going
and"I low do you make sure there's enough
electricity to support a burgeoning electric
car contingent?" important because elec
tric power utilities often struggle to keep up
with power demand, as planning for new
power plants and new distribution systems
can take upwards of a decade. In a carbon
limited world, implementing a few fuel econ
omy standards, offering rebates on hybrids
and then hoping that the transportation sec
tor will sort itself out is not going to cut it. Ihe
problem is too large.
We need transportation utilities, natural
monopoly like institutions that control plan
ning and distribution for all transportation
fuels. Why not approach the refining industry
as an existing institution that is well suited to
the role? Refining is not traditionally viewed
as a good business, so it seems possible that
companies that own refineries (often oil com
panies. but not always) could be convinced to
operate the refineries as tolling plants, where
the company receives compensation for oper
ating the infrastructure. Oil companies and
gas stations would be largely unaffected by
this arrangement, and the refining system it
sell need not be more nationalized than power
utilities are. Rather than try to create entirely
new transportation oversight institutions, why
not ask refineries to become transportation
utilities? Integrating system planning with
supply might allow us to see solutions to the
transportation problem more clearly.

I iitilv often lues to nit \ oil and water hut finds
that they inevitably separate after an hour or
two. We're still in a drought I mail her at gru
berte(<> Stanford.edn.
