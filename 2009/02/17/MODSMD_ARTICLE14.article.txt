Without an all-powerful Greek sys
tem that lords over the hedonistic
hordes, a la t ISC' (honestly, who out
side of Compton doesn't hate that damned
fight song), a great deal of one's social expe
rience at the Stan is dictated by whether or
not you get hosed by the god-awful system
that puts even the BCS to shame: the Draw.
I lie only other institution that gives the
()SA a run for its money for "Most Souls De
voured," the Draw, by sheer randomness (or
karmic justice, depending on one's view of
the world) can decide whether a person is
throwing pre parties before Cafe Night or
thinking of throwing themselves off the top
of the psych building once they realize they
have been relegated to Soto.'lhere are inher
ent flaws in the housing system, and thank
fully. Rcsl d is currently in the process of
making it less horrific.
With that said, there are still students who
get to tronip about in bacchanalian pursuits
011 the almighty Row. and there are still peo
ple who live in ... Soto. Stanford's guarantee
of housing for lour years is incredibly gener
ous. but you will always have basic systemic
inequalities.
Yet to add insult to injury, four-class
dorms, including the much-lampooned Soto,
my humble abode in I loMo and a variety of
other residences across campus are left at
further disadvantage by lack of access to
dorm funds for alcohol, the golden nectar of
college students.
I .et's be honest here. At a school that is al
most entirely devoid of a singular campus
feel, the only tie that binds nearly all of us to
ne! her. other than the ability to enjoy four

years in this reality-free country club, is the
bottle. The sports teams, the Band (I applaud
your level of debauchery. 1 .S.I IJMB). VIS. Ski
Team, the a capella groups (insert Testimony
joke here), the drama folks â€” hell. I have no
doubt even the Chess Team gets its drink on.
lliat's right. Chess Team; I am calling you
out. lu fact. I am going to go so far as to say
that you are probably the biggest closet
drinkers on campus. Maybe the facade of
nerd-dom is actually your guise for rampant
alcoholism. Maybe.
In all sincerity, when you have a campus
that consumes alcohol at the relatively high
levels that we do. being unable to spend our
student funds on alcohol-related events only
further widens the social divide between the
haves and have-Sotos.
Alcohol is not the end-all.be-all (both the
Mormon Church and Chi Theta Chi can at
test to this).and I do not suggest boo/e is nec
essary for a tun evening (talk to the zombie
like folks in Meyer... or not). But I will not
shy away from the notion that alcohol is a
si/eable component of a non-BYU college
experience, and limiting the ability of us less
fortunate souls to plan spirited events is a
problem that should be addressed.
I do need to make it perfectly clear that I
am deeply appreciative of the incredibly rea
sonable open-door policy employed in
dorms: thank you, Stanford, for being less
stupid than most other educational institu
tions in the state. Unlike the majority of
CSI Is and UCs.the Stan puts a heavy empha
sis on personal responsibility and safety, and
not fascism
I do understand the rationale for not i>i\

ing four-class dorms the tap to the proverbial
keg: you don't want to encourage excessive
drinking on the part of the dear innocent
freshmen. My word, what will those poor.op
pressed frosh in four-class dorms do? Well,
probably have a 21-vear-old fellow resident
buy them some good ol" fashioned hard A.
Now that's systematic exploitation I can be
lieve in! And I would question the legality of
at least a third of the residents on the Row.
yet they still wind up with boatloads of
Franzia. and the rest of us ... not so much.
It's a sad truth.
In a perfect world, let us imagine a Stan
ford where places like Loro and Trancos
could use dorm funds to buy a keg for a Fri
day evening. Not only would the general hap
piness of the student body increase, particu
larly because juniors can drink away the fact
that they live in either Loro or Trancos. but
we can cflmbat the supposed rise of alco
holism on campus by providing freshmen
with less irresponsible and more mature
drinking partners. Instead of chirpy Roble
young'uns downing shots of crap vodka be
fore tromping off to the bowels of SAE. we
can provide wide-eyed frosh with responsi
ble boo/e buddies in the basement ol Twain.
And just think: II this dream could be. in
fact, realized, there might actually be a day
when you would no longer need to be
ashamed that you call Soto home.
Now that is something to drink to.

If you care to throw one back or would like to
actually defend Soto and/or the sobriety of the
Chess Team, please email Zack at
