## DEJA VU FOR CARD Stanford loses lead, game to Cal 
### HALEY MURPHY DESK EDITOR 
Saturday's game against Califor
nia played a familiar tune for Stan
ford men's basketball as the sym
phony of a 22-point first-half lead
trailed into a humdrum seven-point
defeat. Despite outstanding shoot
ing during the first period, the Cardi
nal found itself in an unwanted role
reversal for the last three minutes of
play in Haas Pavilion, finally drop
ping 82-75.The disappointing shift in
momentum, however, was a not new
one for the Card, as all but three of
its Pacific-10 Conference losses have
come after giving up a lead of eight
points or greater.
This time, Stanford's lead came
big and early. The Cardinal (15-8.4-
8 Pac-10) got out to a quick start,
going 19 for 28 from the field before
the break. Stanford lit it up from
long range, matching the Bay's
crummy weather by raining nine
threes on the Bears (19-6. 8-4) in
only 12 first-half attempts. In fact, by
the time Stanford found a few min
utes of rest in the locker room, the
scoreboard read 50-36, and the pos
sibilities of a second consecutive Cal
sweep, a fresh start to the back half
of conference plav and the dis
pelling of doubts about being able
to hang onto a lead, all seemed tan
gible.

[Bears' junior guard Jerome Ran
dle saluted the sensational offensive
play bv Stanford.
"They came out like they were at
home and controlled the game,"
Randle said. "They determined
where they wanted the game to go,
and we let them."
Some of the biggest contributors
for Stanford were junior forward
Landry Fields and senior guard An
thony Goods, who were both in dou
ble figures by halftime with 10 points
apiece.They finished with 16 and 13
points, respectively. Senior forward
Lawrence Hill added another nine
points and three rebounds in the
first half, and finished with 15 points
and seven boards.
However, it was freshman guard
Jeremy Green who led the way early,
with all 11 of his points coming be
fore intermission; Green was 3-3
from behind the arc.
But Cal's lethargic play disap
peared during the Bears' locker
room meeting, and with the start of
the second half, a fairytale statement
win proved too good to be true for
the Card.
"You knew there was a good
chance [Stanford's hot shooting]
wouldn't happen again [in the sec
ond half]," said Cal head coach Mike
Montgomery. "But you can't sit
around and hope it doesn't happen."
So, Cal did anything but sit. The

GAME NOTES: All but three of Stanford's Pac
-10 losses have come after giving up a lead of
eight points or better. Freshman Jeremy Green
was a perfect 3-3 from behind the arc against
Cal. The Cardinal looks to avenge a home
loss to Oregon State earlier this season.

Bears tore open the second half,
starting with a 16-3 run to pull with
in one at 13:59. Stanford kept a nar
row lead until 3:04, when Cal began
its last 10-4 drive and prevented the
Cardinal from securing anything hut
foul shots down the stretch.
Cal junior Patrick Christopher,
who managed 14 of his game-high 21
points in the second half, said the
Bears knew at halftime that is was
do or die.
"No way we were going to quit
until it was all zeroes on the clock."
he said. "There was not a doubt in
my mind we were going to win this
game."

Along with Randle (18 points,
seven rebounds), Cal's uphill climb
was led by junior Jamal Boykin (11
points). But freshman guard Jorge
Gutierrez was instrumental in the
Cal comeback, marking 10 points,
eight rebounds and five steals, while
stifling Stanford opponents defen
sively.
Stanford head coach Johnny
Dawkins commended the Bears'
grittiness.
"I give Cal a lot of credit â€” they
fought the whole 40 minutes."
Dawkins said. "We got to a big lead,
but it was a bit early to have that type
of lead."
Call it a lack of stamina, or the in
evitable cooling off of shooters, but
Stanford's early success dropped off,
and a first-half shooting percentage
of 67.9 collapsed on itself to become
33.3 percent in the second. Down
low, the Card was out-rebounded 37-
25.and wrangled only five offensive
boaVds (all in the second half).
"For us to lose like that is like
somebody taking something from
us." Fields said. "It's like they decid
ed to say, 'That's ours, and we've de
cided to take it from you.'"
To a certain extent. Fields is right:
The Bears took all they could from
Stanford. But. with a trend like this
throughout the season. Cardinal
fans are left to wonder: How much
was taken, and how much was given
away?
