end for the highly touted freshman.
1 lead coach John Rittman raved about the maturity of

spite being a freshman.she plays like a veteran because of
the experiences she has had playing club and internation
al ball."
On Saturday, 1 lansen became just the third Stanford
player to record two triples in a game and led Stanford to
a 9-5 victory over Utah State.

has been getting out of the top three batters in the line
up: Haber. Hansen and Coon.
The three are combining to hit a gaudy .506 with 10
doubles and five triples Coon has also recorded a team
leading 11 walks, which contributes to her .656 on-base
percentage.
1 lansen has enjoyed hitting between 1 laber and Coon in
the lineup.
"It is helpful to hit behind 1 laber." 1 lansen said. "We
are similar hitters, and 1 can learn a pitcher's tendencies
from seeing how they pitch her. I'm also really comfort
able with Maddy behind me. knowing she'll pick me up."
With these three players on base so often, the job of
the middle of the Stanford lineup becomes a lot easier.
Rittman is pleased with the way his entire lineup has
shaped up.
"The top five hitters have really produced." he said.
"They have all come up with big hits in big situations. Also,
the competition for spots in the bottom half of the order
has only made everyone better."
Hie Cardinal will open its home schedule next week
end when it plays host to the Stanford Nike Invitational,
beginning Friday at 12:15 p.m. against Sacramento State.
