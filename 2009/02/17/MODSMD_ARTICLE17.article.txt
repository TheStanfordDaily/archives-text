# MEN'S VOLLEYALL
## Men split decisive home series 
### JACOB JAFFE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
I"he Stanford men's volleyball team ex
perienced highs and lows this weekend,
splitting two matches at home against top
ranked opponents.
The No. 7 Cardinal (8-6,4-5 Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation) started off the
weekend with a dominating four-set victo
ry over previously unbeaten No. 3 Pepper
dine — 30-18.28-30,30-25,30-24 — Friday
night at Maples Pavilion.
Stanford out-hit Pepperdine in every
set,and for the match.the Cardinal hit .399,
compared to only .236 for the Waves. Stan
ford led Pepperdine in every major catego
ry, with five more digs and three more aces,
while amassing 17 fewer errors.The biggest
difference, though, was in the blocking,
where Stanford totaled 17.5 bkxks, while
Pepperdine managed only seven.
"The ability to put a good block up lim
ited their hitters and enabled our defense
to dig balls and continue the rallies," said
junior opposite Evan Romero.
The Cardinal front line did allow Pep
perdine's senior opposite Paul Carroll to
record 29 kills, but Carroll was held to only
a .274 hitting percentage. Stanford held the
rest of the team to a .214 hitting percentage
on the match, due in large part to great de
fensive play.The leader of the defense was
once again freshman libera Erik Shoji. who
recorded 26 digs, including numerous re
markable saves.

"I believe that the player that stepped it
up the most was Erik Shoji." Romero said.
"Twenty-six digs in a match is quite an im
pressive feat. He passed extremely well, al
lowing our offense to roll smoothly."
On the offensive side of the ball, the
player of the game was Romero, who had
24 kills while hitting .435 for the match.
Freshman outside hitter Brad Lawson
added a double-double with 15 kills and 10
digs. Sophomore outside hitter Spencer
McLachlin and senior middle blocker
Brandon Williams chipped in with 13 and
10 kills, respectively.
Ihe Cardinal started hot, scoring KX of
the first 22 points in the match to take a
commanding lead in the first set. After
cruising to an easy win in the first set. the
Cardinal faced a tougher Pepperdine at
tack in the second set. falling narrowly by
two points. Stanford then pulled away in
each of the final two sets to secure the vic
tory. This match was quite a turnaround
from the previous matchup of the two
teams earlier in the year, when Pepperdine
swept the Cardinal in Malibu.
"The biggest differences between this
weekend's Pepperdine match and the pre
vious one was that we carried out our game
plan,and did so with confidence," Romero
said. "We played hard, blocked well, hit
smart shots and did not fluctuate emotion
ally. We kept a high intensity the entire
match."
The Cardinal hoped to transfer this in
tensity to its next match against No. 5

Southern California, but the team failed to
bring the same emotion and precision,
falling in straight sets — 31-29,30-28.30-25
— Saturday night at Burnham Pavilion.
Hie loss was Stanford's first at home,and it
dropped the Cardinal below ,S(X) in MPSF
play.
Stanford was once again led in kills by
Romero with 11, followed by Lawson and
McLachlin with 10 apiece. The Cardinal
had difficulty with USC's block, though,
hitting only .233 for the match, with its top
three hitters combining to hit only .149.
"We did not execute the game plan any
where near the level we did against Pepper
dine." Romero said. "Against a good team,
we have to make the small plays, and there
were times that wc did not do that."
Hie Cardinal did lose several crucial
points, which were the difference in the
match. Down 29-25 in the first set, Stanford
rallied to tie the game by staving off four set
points, but then lost the next two to drop
the set. In the second set. the Cardinal led
27-26. but lost four of the last five points to
lose the set. The third set looked to be a
turning point for the Cardinal men, as they
jumped to a 15-7 lead early, the largest lead
for either team in the match. Stanford only
won 10 of the remaining 33 points in the
match, though, falling to USC for the sec
ond time this year.
The team can see its potential, but its
main problem has been consistency.
"Our team has to continue to learn
from our mistakes and work hard in
practice," Romero said. "We have a
very talented team that has to master
the ability to play at a high level consis
tently."
The Cardinal next returns home on
March 3 to take on UC-Santa Cruz.
