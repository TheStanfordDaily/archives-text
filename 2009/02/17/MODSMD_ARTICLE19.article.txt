## Cardinal clinches undefeated season at Cal 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
Finishing the dual meet regular
season by crushing an archrival in a
hostile environment is impressive.
Winning 19 straight Pacific-10 Con
ference dual meets and 41 of 42
head-to-head competitions is just
plain scary.
The No. 2 Stanford women's
swimming and diving team com
pleted the dual meet regular season
undefeated for the 15th time in
school history by emphatically de
feating No. 11 California, 162-129,
Saturday in Berkeley. With the win,
the Cardinal capped off an un
precedented season in which it beat
all six ranked opponents that it
faced in dual meet competition.
Stanford had little difficulty in
defeating the Bears. The day began
with first- and third-place finishes
by the Cardinal in the 200-meter
medley relay and the 1,000
freestyle.
After narrowly losing in the 200
free. Stanford bounced back to
sweep three straight events and cat
apulted itself to a sizeable lead. This
cushion allowed the team to utilize
many of the younger swimmers and
provide valuable race experience

before postseason competition
commences.
The Cardinal's impressive meet
was highlighted by the performance
of three swimmers who qualified
for the NCAA Championships.
Freshman Betsy Webb punched
her ticket to the NCA As by record
ing the third-fastest time in Stan
ford history in the 100 backstroke.
Her time of 52.88 seconds was just
.03 seconds short of the second all
time score set by current Stanford
head coach Lea Maurer.
Sophomore Liz Smith and junior
Olympic medalist Elaine Breeden
also recorded "A" qualifying times
in the 200 breaststroke and 200 but
terfly, respectively.
Freshman Angela Duckworth,
whose third-place finish in the 1.000
free helped clinch the victory for
Stanford, spoke very highly of the
efforts of her teammates.
"[Webb] finished first in the 100-
meter backstroke and created a lot
of momentum for us," Duckworth
said. "She touched out one of Cal's
biggest swimmers so it was a big win
for our team."
Fellow freshman Jamie Bruce
had a career day for the Cardinal,
racing to three personal bests on
Valentine's Dav.

Stanford divers once again kept
pace, sweeping both the one- and
three-meter competitions.
Sophomore Meg Hostage had
two qualifying "A" scores on Satur
day, placing first in the one-meter
competition and second in the
three-meter. Current Pac-10 Diver
of the Month junior Carmen Stellar
continued her extraordinary season
by winning the three-meter compe
tition with a career-high score in
dual meet competition of 308.93.
Senior Sarah Ohr followed suit,
recording two "B" scores and fin
ishing third in both diving competi
tions.
The Cardinal divers were ex
pected to defeat a Cal team that
puts more emphasis on the swim
ming events, but nonetheless made
their case as a force to be reckoned
with in the postseason.
"This team has a lot of fight in
it," Ohr said. "If one member of the
team isn't performing well that day,
we can always count on another to
really step it up. We also have a
strong tradition of excellence, and I
think we all take great pride in
doing out part to continue it."
Up next for the Cardinal are the
Pac-10 Championships in Washing
ton. Stanford will enter the compe

tition as the clear-cut favorites.
However, the team understands
that postseason competition is a
whole new world and that success
will be more difficult to come by.
"We are undefeated in dual
meets, but Pac-lOs are completely
different because they score three
heats when dual meets only score
the top five swimmers," Duckworth
said. "But if everyone swims well
and has fun, who knows what could
happen."
With Pac-lOs and NCAAs right
around the corner. Stanford has
proven itself as both a conference
and national contender. The Cardi
nal has already defeated such pow
erhouses as Michigan and Florida
earlier in the season, and remains at
the heels of Georgia at the top of the
national standings.
However, as echoed time and
time again by the Cardinal women,
the only ranking that matters is that
which is attained at the end of the
postseason.
"From here on out its just fine
tuning the details." Smith said, "and
making sure we stay positive, fo
cused. relaxed and unified."
