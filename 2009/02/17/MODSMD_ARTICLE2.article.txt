## OSA opens events calendar New calendar available at studentevents.stanford.com 
### NIKHIL KAMAT STAFF WRITER 
Since the Office of Student Affairs
(OSA) released a beta version of a
new student events calendar last
Wednesday. Stanford students now
have a new way to publicize their
events to the greater Stanford commu
nity.
ASSU Executive Operations
Manager David Gobaud '11 created
the calendar, available at studen
tevents.stanford.edu, because of defi
ciencies in the previous Stanford
events calendar. Me said Stanford's
event calendar included some
Stanford events but also local Palo
Alto community events that were of
limited interest to many students.
Gobaud said the new calendar
offers a place exclusively reserved for
student events like parties, student
performances and meeting times and
locations for all student organizations.
"Level three parties can't be posted
on the old events calendar because it's
open to the public." Gobaud noted.
"The new student events calendar is
behind WebAuth and therefore limit
ed to Stanford, and that's why the
OSA is allowing level three parties to
be posted there."
Any student affiliated with
Stanford can register to post events on
the Web site, which is organized as a
series of Google calendars divided
into a broad range of over 22 different
categories. All campus organizations
that have registered with the calendar
are available, along with the option of
accessing an RSS feed containing all of
their event details. Students can also
subscribe to any calendar through iCal
feeds.
"The interface is better because it
uses Google calendar." Gobaud said.
"You can import it into your i Phone or
your own calendar."
Gobaud said development on the
calendar started last quarter after dis
cussion among the ASSU executive
cabinet on creating a more accessible
student events calendar. Gobaud eval
uated several options, such as Stanford
webmail's Zimbra platform or using
Google calendar in isolation, before
Nanci Howe, director of student activ
ities. referred him to Scott Stocker, the
director of web communications.
"Scott developed the events.stan
ford.edu Web site and software,"
Gobaud said, "lie gave me a copy of
the events.stanford software, and
we are hosting it on the ASSU
server, and 1 modified it to use
Google calendar to visualize the
results."
The calendar already has 109
events posted from over 87 stu
dents registered to the calendar.
Any student or organization can
register to add events to the calen
dar. although repeated abuse of
calendar policies could result in a
ban.
"We're trusting the Stanford
community to not abuse this."
Gobaud pointed out. "We want this
to be as easy as possible for stu

dents to use; there is no approval
process."
While the calendar has not been
widely publicized to the broader
Stanford community, student
organization leaders have received
emails from the OSA regarding the
project, and responses to the calen
dar have generally been positive.
Chang Kim '09, co-president of the
Korean drumming ensemble
Hwimori and campus liaison for
the Korean Students Association,
said the calendar's biggest strength
was its simple layout.
"There is no extra clutter, and
all the information is right there,"
Kim said. "I think this will suit my
needs very well because it's right to
the point."
Raagapella President Viganan
Pattamatta '11 said the calendar is
a large improvement from email

lists, through which events were
previously publicized, explaining
that the sheer volume of email
from lists often means that news
goes ignored or forgotten. But, as
leader of a performing arts group,
Pattamatta said it would he nice if
groups could add additional media
to the calendar.
"If there are four different
events that a person could go to in
one day, you could definitely make
an impression by having a video
trailer or flier," Pattamatta noted.
Gobaud said the next phase of
the calendar would involve
Facebook integration.
"It's really open for change, and
I just want to make this is as usable
as possible for students." he said.
