## OSA opens events calendar New calendar available at studentevents.stanford.com 
### NIKHIL KAMAT STAFF WRITER 
Since the Office of Student Affairs
(OSA) released a beta version of a
new student events calendar last
Wednesday. Stanford students now
have a new way to publicize their
events to the greater Stanford commu
nity.
ASSU Executive Operations
Manager David Gobaud '11 created
the calendar, available at studen
tevents.stanford.edu, because of defi
ciencies in the previous Stanford
events calendar. Me said Stanford's
event calendar included some
Stanford events but also local Palo
Alto community events that were of
limited interest to many students.
Gobaud said the new calendar
offers a place exclusively reserved for
student events like parties, student
performances and meeting times and
locations for all student organizations.
"Level three parties can't be posted
on the old events calendar because it's
open to the public." Gobaud noted.
"The new student events calendar is
behind WebAuth and therefore limit

OSA is allowing level three parties to
be posted there."
Any student affiliated with
Stanford can register to post events on
the Web site, which is organized as a
series of Google calendars divided
into a broad range of over 22 different
categories. All campus organizations
that have registered with the calendar
are available, along with the option of
accessing an RSS feed containing all of
their event details. Students can also
subscribe to any calendar through iCal
feeds.
"The interface is better because it
uses Google calendar." Gobaud said.
"You can import it into your i Phone or
your own calendar."
Gobaud said development on the
calendar started last quarter after dis
cussion among the ASSU executive
cabinet on creating a more accessible
student events calendar. Gobaud eval
uated several options, such as Stanford
webmail's Zimbra platform or using
Google calendar in isolation, before
Nanci Howe, director of student activ
ities. referred him to Scott Stocker, the
director of web communications.
"Scott developed the events.stan
ford.edu Web site and software,"
Gobaud said, "lie gave me a copy of
