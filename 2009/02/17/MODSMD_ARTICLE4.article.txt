Rather than spend their long
weekend finishing a problem set or
catching up on sleep, some 6(H)
Stanford students took out an entire
day to dance in order to raise aware
ness and money for HIV/AIDS.
ITie fifth annual Stanford Dance
Marathon took place at Arrillaga
Alumni Center from 1 p.m. on
Saturday until 1 p.m. on Sunday.This
year, however, featured fewer
dancers than usual â€” a decrease
that organizers attributed to
Valentine's Day, which also fell on
Saturday.
Despite the lower turnout, how
ever. the weekend's soggy weather
did not dampen the spirit of those
who took part. Dance Marathon's

Director of External Affairs Leah
Kuritzky '10 said the event was
everything she had hoped for.
"We had a great turnout, and it
was fortunate that the rain held out
until late at night," Kuritzky said.
"Even with the rain, come 4 a.m.,
several brave, rain-soaked moralers
trekked to the Alumni Center to
work their morale magic for what
are traditionally three of the tough
est hours of Dance Marathon for
dancers."
In the midst of economic reces
sion. the event raised over $ 13().(KK).
FACE AIDS, a national non-profit
founded by Stanford students,
matched the dancers' fundraising of
565.670.35 through private donations
