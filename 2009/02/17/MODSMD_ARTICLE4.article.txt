# DM dances to over $130,0000
## Donations down due to poor economy 
### SHANE SAVITSKY 
Rather than spend their long
weekend finishing a problem set or
catching up on sleep, some 6(H)
Stanford students took out an entire
day to dance in order to raise aware
ness and money for HIV/AIDS.
ITie fifth annual Stanford Dance
Marathon took place at Arrillaga
Alumni Center from 1 p.m. on
Saturday until 1 p.m. on Sunday.This
year, however, featured fewer
dancers than usual — a decrease
that organizers attributed to
Valentine's Day, which also fell on
Saturday.
Despite the lower turnout, how
ever. the weekend's soggy weather
did not dampen the spirit of those
who took part. Dance Marathon's

Director of External Affairs Leah
Kuritzky '10 said the event was
everything she had hoped for.
"We had a great turnout, and it
was fortunate that the rain held out
until late at night," Kuritzky said.
"Even with the rain, come 4 a.m.,
several brave, rain-soaked moralers
trekked to the Alumni Center to
work their morale magic for what
are traditionally three of the tough
est hours of Dance Marathon for
dancers."
In the midst of economic reces
sion. the event raised over $ 13().(KK).
FACE AIDS, a national non-profit
founded by Stanford students,
matched the dancers' fundraising of
565.670.35 through private donations

for a grand total of $130,473.70. That
total is expected to increase, though,
as final donations arrive in the coming
weeks.
Going back the previous three
years. Dance Marathon raised
$121,888.92, $150,893.62 and $58,000,
respectively; however, those years did
not feature FACE AIDS matching, so
this years dance donation total

saw a 44 percent decrease

from last year.

Dance Marathon
Campus Director Jessie

Liu '09 attributed the

difference to the ptxir
economic climate.
While dancers were
provided extensive sup-

port in fundraising, she

said, several contacted

event organizers with con-

cerns about asking their fam-

ilies for donations during

the other 10 percent of funds
($6,867.04) toward working with
HIV-positive individuals in San
Mateo County.
"We are very proud of all of our
dedicated fundraisers, and apprecia
tive of FACE AIDS donors for mak
ing a donation total of this magnitude
possible, despite the recession,"
Kuritzky said.
Dancers taking part in the event
had to pledge to raise $192, an
amount equal to the price of annual
HIV/AIDS medication for an adult
and pediatric patient. The impact of
the event was evident to many of

these difficult times. Liu also noted
how sponsorship was down this year,
with many previous donors cutting
back or no longer even contributing.
"Fundraising isn't the main focus,
though," she added. "The real focus
is on improving awareness among
the student body of HIV/AIDS and
inspiring individuals to help in the
cause." To that purpose, this year's
event featured a contemplation
room focusing on individuals with
HIV/AIDS, as well as a
health/human rights service fair and
research/service project symposium.
Ninety percent of the 2(X)9 pro
ceeds ($123,606.60) will go to
Partners in Health (PIH).a non-prof
it organization dedicated to the
expansion of healthcare in developing
countries, in particular its work in
Rwanda. Dance Marathon added a
local secondary beneficiary this year i
as well: Ellipse HIV Support Services, ;
a Bay Area charity committed to ]
stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS in i
San Mateo Countv, which will receive

the dancers who took part.

"I think the
HIV/AIDS cause, espe
l daily with regard to
V Dance Marathon, is
something special,"
I said Ariana Koblitz
' T2. "We, as students,
are making a stand
and highlighting the
fact that this is some
thing so easily preventa-

ble in today's world

When the clock struck one
on Sunday afternoon, the hundreds of
dancers who filed out of Arrillaga
may have been exhausted, but they
were more than pleased with their
day's work.
"At the end of Dance Marathon,
you start to realize the extent of what
you've done," said Gino Mazzotti
TO. "You may feel terrible and tired
and exhausted, but you come to real
ize that you've done something great
over the past 24 hours out of pure
solidarity."
Dance Marathon wasn't the only
marathon fundraiser held over the
weekend; organizers also added the
"Hack-a-thon" event for those who
prefer to code rather than dance for
good. This 24-hour programming
spree was set up and conceived by
David Gobaud '08. A total of 34 pro
grammers participated in the event
by checking for bugs in programs
and Web sites run by Dance
Marathon's beneficiaries and other
non-profit organizations.
Students targeted OpenMRS, an

open medical records system used by
Partners in Health; two projects for
Kiva. where lenders can make micro
loans to those in need around the
world: a revamped Web site and data
base for Ellipse: a Facebook applica
tion for F ACE AIDS; and an iPhone
application and other projects for
[Tie Extraordinaries, so people can
spend their free time working on
projects that are socially beneficial.
"It was absolutely amazing,"
Gobaud said. "We got more done
than I ever thought we would. We
fixed more bugs and features in 24
hours than OpenMßS's core team
do in an average weekend. The
results are absolutely fabulous."

several brave, rain-soaked moralers
trekked to the Alumni Center to
work their morale magic for what
are traditionally three of the tough
est hours of Dance Marathon for
dancers."

Dancers hold up signs revealing the $130,473.70 grand total raised by Dance Marathon. The total included
a match by private donors, made possible by the national FACE AIDS organization.
for a grand total of $130,473.70. That
total is expected to increase, though,
as final donations arrive in the coming
weeks.
Going back the previous three
years. Dance Marathon raised
$121,888.92, $150,893.62 and $58,000,
respectively; however, those years did
not feature FACE AIDS matching, so
this years dance donation total

saw a 44 percent decrease

from last year.

Dance Marathon
Campus Director Jessie

Liu '09 attributed the

difference to the ptxir
economic climate.
While dancers were
provided extensive sup-

port in fundraising, she

said, several contacted

event organizers with con-

cerns about asking their fam-

ilies for donations during

the other 10 percent of funds
($6,867.04) toward working with
HIV-positive individuals in San
Mateo County.
"We are very proud of all of our
dedicated fundraisers, and apprecia
tive of FACE AIDS donors for mak
ing a donation total of this magnitude
possible, despite the recession,"
Kuritzky said.
Dancers taking part in the event
had to pledge to raise $192, an
amount equal to the price of annual
HIV/AIDS medication for an adult
and pediatric patient. The impact of
the event was evident to many of

these difficult times. Liu also noted
how sponsorship was down this year,
with many previous donors cutting
back or no longer even contributing.
"Fundraising isn't the main focus,
though," she added. "The real focus
is on improving awareness among
the student body of HIV/AIDS and
inspiring individuals to help in the
cause." To that purpose, this year's
event featured a contemplation
room focusing on individuals with
HIV/AIDS, as well as a
health/human rights service fair and
research/service project symposium.
Ninety percent of the 2(X)9 pro
ceeds ($123,606.60) will go to
Partners in Health (PIH).a non-prof
it organization dedicated to the
expansion of healthcare in developing
countries, in particular its work in
Rwanda. Dance Marathon added a
local secondary beneficiary this year i
as well: Ellipse HIV Support Services, ;
a Bay Area charity committed to ]
stopping the spread of HIV/AIDS in i
San Mateo Countv, which will receive

the dancers who took part.

"I think the
HIV/AIDS cause, espe
l daily with regard to
V Dance Marathon, is
something special,"
I said Ariana Koblitz
' T2. "We, as students,
are making a stand
and highlighting the
fact that this is some
thing so easily preventa-

ble in today's world

When the clock struck one
on Sunday afternoon, the hundreds of
dancers who filed out of Arrillaga
may have been exhausted, but they
were more than pleased with their
day's work.
"At the end of Dance Marathon,
you start to realize the extent of what
you've done," said Gino Mazzotti
TO. "You may feel terrible and tired
and exhausted, but you come to real
ize that you've done something great
over the past 24 hours out of pure
solidarity."
Dance Marathon wasn't the only
marathon fundraiser held over the
weekend; organizers also added the
"Hack-a-thon" event for those who
prefer to code rather than dance for
good. This 24-hour programming
spree was set up and conceived by
David Gobaud '08. A total of 34 pro
grammers participated in the event
by checking for bugs in programs
and Web sites run by Dance
Marathon's beneficiaries and other
non-profit organizations.
Students targeted OpenMRS, an

open medical records system used by
Partners in Health; two projects for
Kiva. where lenders can make micro
loans to those in need around the
world: a revamped Web site and data
base for Ellipse: a Facebook applica
tion for F ACE AIDS; and an iPhone
application and other projects for
[Tie Extraordinaries, so people can
spend their free time working on
projects that are socially beneficial.
"It was absolutely amazing,"
Gobaud said. "We got more done
than I ever thought we would. We
fixed more bugs and features in 24
hours than OpenMßS's core team
do in an average weekend. The
results are absolutely fabulous."
