## Law school defends Obama image Fair Use Project backs artist against copyright infringement 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Law School's Fair Use Project is
embroiled in a highly publicized copyright case
involving the popular red and blue Obama
"1 lope" poster, which became a übiquitous sym
bol of Barack Obama's presidential campaign
over the past two years. 1 leading the legal team is
Anthony Falzone, a lecturer at the law school and
the executive director of the Fair Use Project.
l"he case centers around the fact that street
artist Shepard Fairey used a news photograph
from the Associated Press (AP) as the basis for
the poster. Last week, the AP announced it had
determined that it owned the photograph,
accused Fairey of copyright infringement and
demanded a portion of any revenue he received
from use of the image. Falzone is defending
Fairey against these charges.
In response to the AP's accusations, Falzone
and the Stanford F air Use Project team preemp
tively filed a lawsuit last week asking a federal
judge to declare that Fairey is protected from
copyright infringement claims.
"There should be no doubt about the legality
of Fairey's work," Falzone said in a press release.
"He used the photograph for a purpose entirely
different than the original, and transformed it
dramatically. The original photograph is a literal
depiction of Obama, whereas F'airev's poster cre
ates powerful new meaning and conveys a radi
cally different message that has no analogue in
the original photograph."
The Fair Use Project, founded in 2(K)6. pro
vides legal support to a range of projects designed
to clarify — and extend — the boundaries of "fair
use" in order to enhance creative freedom.
The image became an iconic symbol of
Obama's grassroots campaign, featured on T
shirts, buttons, magnets and posters. The Obama
team welcomed the image but never adopted it
officially due to copyright concerns.
While copyright laws allow limited use of
copyrighted materials for purposes like criticism
or comment, the AP maintains that Fairey's
poster constitutes copyright infringement. A pho
