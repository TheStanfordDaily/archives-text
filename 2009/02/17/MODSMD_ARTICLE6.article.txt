year's first meeting in January. With a win.
the Golden Bears (20-3,11-1) would have
had a commanding, two-game lead that,
outside of a surprising upset, would likely
have given Cal the regular-season Pac-10
championship.
Instead, despite being down by
four at halftime. the Cardinal
refused to submit, and now
stands tied with the Golden
Bears in the conference stand
ings. Led by junior center

Player of the Week for the fourth time
this year, the Cardinal went on a 19-0 run
that lasted over seven minutes and elevat
ed Stanford from a three-point deficit to a
16-point advantage.
"We had a real lack of focus from that
14-minute mark on and that's not some
thing I've seen from my team this
year," said Cal coach Joanne
Boyle.
Appel led all players
Jijv with 22 points and 14
rebounds for her 10th double
double of the year. She was also
stout defensively, holding Bears star
Devanei Hampton to just seven points of
her own.

Senior Jillian Harmon was the
only other Cardinal player to score in
double figures, tallying 18 points on
8-13 shooting. She helped lead Stan
lord in transition in the second half,
as the Cardinal was able to exploit
Cal's foul trouble. Both Alexis Gray-
Lawson, who scored 37 points against
Stanford in January, and Ashley
Walker recorded their third fouls less
than four minutes into the period,
and Stanford immediately took ad
vantage. Down 30-22 at the time, the
Cardinal closed out the game on a 36-
11 run.
"I think we made our statement,"
said redshirt junior Rosalyn Gold-
Onwude."We just couldn't let it hap
pen again. It's a pride issue."
But while Stanford was able to as
sert itself late in the game, it did take
some time for the team to build any
momentum. As has been an issue at
times this season, the Cardinal did
not always capitalize on opportuni
ties early in the contest. Despite
jumping out to a 9-4 lead to begin the
game, a combination of turnovers
and missed shots allowed Cal to take

a slim halftime lead.
'it was a battle, like a heavyweight
fight," said Stanford coach Tara Van-
Derveer."We started running a little
bit, we hit some nice outside shots
and we went into Javne really well in
the second half."
"We just knew we had to stick in
there," Appel said. "Even if we're
down, we're still going to be giving
our all and playing as hard as we can."
The Cardinal's victory broke the
Bears' 13-game winning streak that
dates back to mid-December, and
prevented Cal's first sweep of Stan
ford since 1985-1986. Walker and
Laura Greif led the Bears with 11
points apiece, but the Cardinal was
able to shut down Cal's other offen
sive threats — Gray-Lawson only
notched four points on the afternoon,
and Natasha Vital was just 2-11 from
the field.
Outside of Harmon and Appel.
Stanford didn't shoot particularly

well, either, as sophomore forward
Kayla Pedersen shot 20 percent, and
sophomore Jeanette Pohlen and
freshman Lindy La Rocque were a
combined 3-11 from beyond the arc.
But the Cardinal was able to hit shots
when it mattered — La Rocque hit a
three-pointer early in the second half
to cut Cal's lead to three. Just mo
ments later, she dove for a loose ball
and tossed it to Harmon, who laid it in
to bring the Bears' lead down to jut a
single point.
"Lindy goes for that loose ball, and
we get the energy going." VanDerveer
said.
After another few minutes of
back-and-forth. Harmon nailed a
long-distance jumper of her own to
give the Cardinal a 37-34 lead. Stan
ford never trailed again.
The victory extends the Cardinal's
current winningstreak to seven games
with just six contests remaining on its
Pac-10 schedule.

Stanford is next in action on Thurs
day at Maples against Oregon State at
7 p.m.
