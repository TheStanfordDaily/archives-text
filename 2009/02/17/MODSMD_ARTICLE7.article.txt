## Tree hopefuls crop up Tree Week off to a flying start with zip cables, Santa Claus 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Monday afternoon marked the beginning of
Tree Week — Stanford's annual quest to replace
its much-loved unofficial mascot. This year, the
three main contenders for the Stanford Tree per
formed their outrageous entrance stunts before
an intimate audience of Tree stalwarts.
According to reigning Tree Patrick Fortune
'09, the yearly tradition is meant to be a sponta
neous "mix of confidence and creativity."
Although yesterday's informational meeting
took place amid gloomy skies at the Band
Shack, it was marked by electric energy on the
part of the candidates.
Dressed in a rocketeer costume. Kyle Owen
TO initiated his Tree campaign by flying across a
zip cable suspended between two trees. I lis stunt
represented the launch to becoming Tree. His
flight was truncated, however, by a head-on col
lision with a ladder. Fortunately. Owen took the
precaution of equipping himself with a helmet
before he used a fire extinguisher to propel him
self across the cable, obscured by a cloud of
smoke. Kalena Masching 'ON. a friend of Owen
and five-time Tree Week spectator, assured The
Daily that no trees were harmed in the process.
"I've been thinking about this for a long time
and am excited to do some fun things with these
really cool guys," said Owen of his candidacy.
Following Owen's stunt. Jack Cackler '09 was
carried forth on a platform by several of his
peers. He was then hoisted from the ground and
commenced to read his speech aloud, dangling
mid-air from a tree. According to supporters,
deeply rooted in Cackler's ideology is a commit
ment to bring "awesomeness" back to Stanford.
But Cackler himself emphasized his desire to
bring create a spirit of glee across campus
through "a little bit of enthusiasm and a lot of
hard work."
"I really enjoyed my time at Stanford, and I
want to do something to give back to it." Cackler
added. "There's no better way I can do that than
as Tree."
Last year, Cackler was disqualified from the
Tree competition for crossing the line with his
stunts — one of which featured him running
into nine fluorescent light bulbs until his midsec
tion was bleeding profusely. Cackler. who also
ate a live snake during last year's campaign, ran
unsuccessfully for ASSIJ Vice President last
spring and currently serves on The Daily's edito
rial board.
The afternoon closed with a stunt staged by
Jonathan Strange 'I I. Strange entered the scene
as Santa Claus. with a procession of
eight cyclists serving as his reindeer.
"If you go to any [of the] games,
the Tree is an integral part," said
Ravlene Poppino Tl, a public policy
major who supports the Strange
campaign. "It builds up Stanford
pride and John Strange is doing a
phenomenal job."
"It's a good way for people to get
excited about what's coming up
next." added Katherine Matsumoto
'11.
Reflecting on his experience as
the treasured mascot. Fortune said.
"I've loved it. It was everything I
expected it to be and more."
And while all three contenders

may greatly pine for the distinction
of being Tree, only one will ascend
the evergreen throne at the end of
this week.
