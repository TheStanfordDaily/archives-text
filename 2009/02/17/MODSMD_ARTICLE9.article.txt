## Seven defining moments of Dance Marathon 
### SIJIA WANG 
The Hands: Three bands performed
at Dance Marathon throughout
the night — Dizzy Balloon, I"he
Jakes and Vance Brown. They def
initely rocked the Arrillaga
Alumni Center. After each set. the crowd
would chant, "One more song! One more
song!" and the bands happily caved in. con
tenting the crowd with another soulful
melody or head-banging tune.
Fighting tor a Good Cause: The Dance
Marathon-ers marched onto the dance floor,
prepared to support a cause they knew
would benefit people halfway around the
world. In the weeks preceding Dance
Marathon, they had raised money for F ACE
AIDS, a non-profit organization that is dedi
cated to lighting AIDS by building sanitary
healthcare facilities in Africa. By the end of
Dance Marathon, the money had been
counted — Stanford students had con
tributed more than $130,000 to a cause worth
fighting for.
The Hackers: In conjunction with the regular
Dance Marathon-ers. the "hackers" donated
24 hours of their time to developing valuable
programs, such as databases, for Partners in
Health and other organizations. The ultra
techie computer programmers worked
together collaboratively to accomplish Java
coding projects.
The Game Room: When the noise on the
dance floor became too overwhelming, the
dancers drifted over to the Game Room to
relax and banter with friends. Playing Jenga
while completely worn-out proved to be just

as exciting as drunk Jenga. Dance Dance
Revolution tempted those masochistic types,
who ended up three times more lead-footed
than they had been upon entering the Game
Room.
'Hie Halfway Point: When I a.m. rolled
around, the dancers all heaved a collective
sigh of relief. They had spent the past 12
hours dancing to everything from hip-hop to
rock to techno music. In recognition of the
halfway point, the DJ of the hour played Bon
Jovi's "Livin" on a Prayer." The Dance
Marathon-ers all sang the lyrics together,
belting out the words,"Ohh ... we're halfway
there," as loudly as they could. The energy in
the room was electric, and previously

exhausted faces lit up with optimism as the
dancers embraced each other.
The Pumped-Up Moralers: Every three
hours, moralers charged onto the dance floor
to Dance Marathon's theme song. Journey's
"Any Way You Want It." Dressed in outra
geously sparkly and colorful rallying gear,
they rushed onto the stage and danced pas
sionately while strumming imaginary guitars
and lip-syncing a thousand times better than
Ashlee Simpson. The choreography may not
have been perfect, but it hardly mattered to
the dancers, who were overjoyed to see their
friends come cheer them on.
Sitting Down ... Finally: After 20-plus hours.

the dancers could easily be differentiated
from the rest of the crowd — they could
barely drag their feet along the floor, and
standing still became more painful than danc
ing. They remained committed until the last
moment... until the 24th hour struck. When
that moment came, the dancers collapsed
onto the floor, amazingly fatigued but mirac
ulously exultant. They had truly accom
plished something meaningful and proved to
themselves that they could overcome tired
ness and physical pain to take a literal stand
for what they believed in.
