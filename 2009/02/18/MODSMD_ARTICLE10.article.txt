## Ken Scott speaks on economic crisis A
						conversation on Obama's stimulus 
### JOANNA XU MANAGING EDITOR 
Ken Scott '56. professor emeritus
of law and business, is a leading schol
ar in the fields of corporate finance
reform and corporate governance,
and he has commented widely on the
financial crisis. The Daily spoke with
Scott about the reasons behind the
financial crisis, who is at fault and how
the government should react.
Ihe Stanford Daily (SD): Who in
your opinion got us into this mess?
"(Tie media has been ragging on the
finance industry and blaming them
for taking too many gambles and not
doing proper risk management. But
many economists are saying that the
government is at fault too for keeping
interest rates so low for so long and
not regulating the finance industry
enough. Where do you think the spec
trum of fault lies?
Ken Scott (KS): Well, when you start
asking why. it can be infinite regress.
You can go back almost indefinitely;
to pick a starting point. 1 would pick
two events: one would be the
response of the Fed to the dot-com
bubble burst in 2(K) 1. Then, the stock
market dropped and there was a fear
that this [might lead onward]. The
Fed was looking at what happened in
Japan from 1989. the Japanese bubble
burst. It lasted the better part of 10
years. They actually moved into a
period of deflation, no lending and no
growth and so on. The Fed reacted
verv strongly to that fear. They moved

the Fed Funds Rate from 5.5 percent
to one percent in a year and a half.
The real cost of money was negative,
once you factored in inflation.
So guess what? Banks borrowed
from the Fed. Money supply expand
ed and the grounds were laid for later
inflation. But the grounds were also
laid for flooding the entire economy
with liquidity. Everybody was getting
cheap money and leverage was going
up all across the economy because
debt was so cheap — cheaper than
equity, obviously. l"he debt-to-equity
ratio moved: everything got more
leveraged and risky. That was true of
housing as well.
The other factor is that the formu
la for prosperity around the world, in
Asia in particular, was changing.
Countries such as China. Japan and
Korea were exporting to the U.S. This
was great for our consumers, who
were paying for those goods in dol
lars. But the Asian governments, par
ticularly the Chinese, had this huge
inflow of dollars, which was sustaining
economic growth in their country.
They used their dollar reserves to buy
U.S. Treasury debt and that too kept
interest rates low in this country.
So you had a period of very low
interest rates, and one of the products
that is most sensitive to the cost of
money is housing, because most peo
ple are buying houses with large
amounts of debt and small amounts
of equity. 'ITie result was that as the
price of money went down, as the
price of mortgages went down, the
demand and price for housing went
up If you look at the data for the first
part of this century, from say about
2(K)1, the value of houses just started
climbing. From 2(H) 1 to 2006. the
housing market increased by 50 per

cent, ["hat's a hell of a rate of return.
But when you see an exponential
growth curve — one thing you can be
sure is that it can't keep going. It's got
to level off somewhere.
Then you had a government policy
that was making it worse, which was
called "promote home ownership,"
which was translated into "promote
affordable housing." which was trans
lated into little or no down payment.
So Fannie and Freddie were constant
ly being pushed by Congress to make
more and more "affordable housing"
loans. This has been going on for 15
years or so by the time the housing
market burst. Bv then. 40 percent of
your loans that were securitized were
"affordable housing" loans, which
meant from very low or zero down
payment to not placing much empha
sis on income and ability to repay
when evaluating home buyers.
Eventually, the private sector
jumped in too and was also making
sub-prime loans in competition with
Fannie and Freddie. But where was
the money coming from in the private
sector? Now you get into securitiza
tion. You securitize by putting several
thousand mortgages into a pool. You
don't sell the pool directly to
investors — you create tranches. And
the triple-A tranches are now sup
posed to be very safe — even though
they are based on crummy mortgages
— because they have the first claim to
payment flow.
SI): L et's move to government reac
tion and bailout plans. Many ideas
have been thrown around — the bad
banks plan, mailing checks to the con
sumer. insuring the mortgages of
homeowners. Which in your opinion
