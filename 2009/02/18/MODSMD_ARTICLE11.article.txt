## Editorial "Sleep and Dreams" should be revamped, but don't stop there 
### 
For many years. Professor William De
ment's popular lecture course "Sleep
and Dreams" (PSYC 135) has given
Stanford students a framework for under
standing how sleep affects their daily lives.The
class — which tackles everything from sleep
debt to sleep disorders, circadian rhythms to
sleepwalking — has a reputation for being si
multaneously engaging and undemanding.
Many students who have taken "Sleep and
Dreams" say they enrolled either out of gen
uine interest or simply to satisfy the natural
science general education requirement
(GER).
As a result, the Senate Subcommittee on
GERs hit a nerve among Stanford students
when it voted to strip "Sleep and Dreams" of
its GER status. This decision, which will be
come effective in fall 2009, prompted Dement
to launch an email campaign urging students
to vote in an online Stanford Daily poll that
they would not take his course if the GER no
longer applied. When the poll closed, 679 of
805 voters (or about 84 percent) had stated
that the lack of a GER would be a deal-break
er for them. And while the poll is not necessar
ily representative of the student body's true
beliefs, due to its unscientific nature and De
ment's broadly disseminated appeal, there is
little doubt that fewer students will take
"Sleep and Dreams" if its GER status is per
manently revoked.
Since Dement has indicated his willingness
to alter some of the course content in accor
dance with GER standards, the editorial
board believes a compromise can and should
be reached. Dement should modify the course
material to make the class more substantive,
and "Sleep and Dreams" should continue to
fulfill the natural science GER. The informa
tion covered in the class is non-trivial to be
sure, given that sleep deprivation and disor
ders are estimated to cost Americans more
than $1(X) billion annually in lost productivity,
medical expenses and sick leave, as well as
property and environmental damage, accord
ing to the National Sleep Foundation. More
over, car accidents due to driver sleepiness ac

count for tens of thousands of crashes on US.
highways each year. Students who take "Sleep
and Dreams" not only benefit from a deeper
understanding of brain function and neuro
logical controls, but may also think twice be
fore pulling an all-nighter or driving while
drowsy.
Furthermore, it appears that "Sleep and
Dreams" has been unfairly singled out due to
its popularity, not because it is unique in falling
short of GER standards.The editorial board is
aware of several classes with reputations sim
ilar to that of Dement's class that continue to
satisfy various GERs. It seems strange to draw
the line at "Sleep and Dreams" only because it
serves as a glaring example of a wider phe
nomenon. The Senate Subcommittee on
GERs should be more transparent about its
standards and seek to apply them with greater
consistency.
From the standpoint of the editorial board,
a revamped "Sleep and Dreams" should re
tain its GER status in order to give students
the option of taking a science-based course
that is not overly intimidating to fuzzies.
GERs are integral to the development of the
well-rounded Stanford student, and lowering
the standard too far renders them meaning
less. Still, it is crucial to provide a broad range
of courses that appeal to students at every
point on the techie-fuzzy spectrum.
Many students regard "Sleep and Dreams"
as an academic highlight in their undergradu
ate careers, and Stanford has an obligation to
ensure that the class is refashioned in a way
that satisfies GER standards. After all. should
n't the maximum number of future Stanford
students have the opportunity to cherish
memories of their visit with the narcoleptic
dog and bonus points earned for falling asleep
during lecture? While revoking the GER for
PS YCI3S will not prevent anyone from taking
the class, it is worthwhile to maintain an av
enue for students to fulfill the natural science
GER while taking a class they find interesting
and fun. And if increasing the rigor and scien
tific content of the class can accomplish that,
students will ultimately benefit.
