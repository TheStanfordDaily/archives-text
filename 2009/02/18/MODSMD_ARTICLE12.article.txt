In my last column. I shared a few tidbits I had
learned in the long 10 years between col
lege and returning to graduate school.
While I continue to insist that I don't know
much in the grand scheme of things. I fortu
nately do know more than can fit in a single
8(X)-word piece. And so. dear reader. I offer you
more nuggets of wisdom — nuggets I know to
be solid gold because they have personally
clunked me on the head.
Some lost souls go to purgatory. Others go to
law school.
As my college graduation approached. I re
alized I had no idea what I wanted to do. I was
majoring in electrical engineering, which was
fun. but I didn't want to get out of school and
go right back to sitting at a lab bench. I had al
ways enjoyed history and political philosophy,
and fancied going abroad a bit, so i applied to
master's programs in European intellectual
history at Oxford and Cambridge.
Strangely enough, they both turned me
down flat. I still hold fast to my belief that it
must have been because their admission com
mittees were populated with haughty, tea-sip
ping. America-hating Brits, rather than the fact
that my transcript was dominated by classes
with titles like "Electromagnetic Communica
tion"' and "Advanced Processor Architecture."
Now at a complete loss, I clung to the near
est. most obvious anchor I could find out of
fear and uncertainty. I decided I would go to
law school and become a patent lawyer. It
made sense. I had an engineering degree.
Patent law was a stable, honorable profession
that would provide for my yet-to-know wife
and allow me to send my yet-to-be-born chil
dren to the right preschools. I could explain the
job to my parents! Lawyers worked in big,
shiny office buildings and got invited to luxury
skyboxes at Yankee Stadium by their corpo
rate clients!
The decision was so utterly sensible it over
whelmed the fact that / had no interest whatso
ever in actually practicing patent law, a profes
sion that involves endless hours of generating
legal documents. [ fortunately pulled out of the
nosedive and swore off law school, but only
after taking the LSAT — twice.
Please understand: I love the idea of study
ing law. I think it is a fascinating subject, and
learning it helps us understand the structure of
our society. If you want to tackle great consti
tutional issues, work for international justice,
help defend the most downtrodden members
of our society or experience the challenge of
litigating in a courtroom, then law school may
be perfect for you.
The key to enjoying law school and your ca
reer afterward, however, is (shockingly) an ac

tual interest in practicing law. This may not
seem a terribly profound point, but it certainly
is lost on hordes of directionless undergradu
ates who flock to legal education like lem
mings pouring over a cliff.
The analogy is an imperfect one, however,
for the lemmings' suffering is brief.The hapless
law students, devoid of any real direction in
which to channel their education, will die a
slow death at large corporate law firms, as they
pore over the documents involved in meat
packing company A's acquisition of meatpack
ing company B.
The moral: Applying to law school is easy,as
is following the recruiting funnel into consult
ing or investment banking. But you should
probably avoid the easy route unless you have,
or at least strongly think you have, an actual in
terest in the field.
Now perhaps you're thinking, "Ah hah. I
never planned to go to law school. I'm a com
puter science type with actual skills, and I'm
going to make my fortune in Silicon Valley."
Well. I have some sobering news ...
That startup you're joining is not the next
Google
Okay, it might be. But the odds are small
enough that joining a startup as an employee in
the hopes of getting stock lucky is not a great
investment. As,say, the 20th employee at Blue-
Zoozle.com.you will be extremely fortunate to
obtain 0.25 or 0.5 percent of an equity share in
the company.
Now let's say, after five years of 80-hour
weeks, BlueZoozle is acquired by Rupert Mur
doch's News Corporation for $100 million, a
very handsome result for a startup. (Most fail
or limp along as "zombies." Ones like Mi
crosoft or Google that make millionaires out
of ordinary employees are very, very rare).
Your equity share — assuming it was never
diluted by further investments — will earn you
$250,000 to $500,000. A nice little payoff, ex
cept for the fact that it's roughly equal to the
extra salary you would have made over five
years if you had worked for a large company
instead of a startup.
The moral: If you want to make it big with a
startup, you probably want to try to found your
own. The odds are still against you. but if you
do succeed, chances are you'll retain enough
equity five, 10,20 percent to make life-chang
ing money. Otherwise, it's not worth working
for a startup as an employee unless — and this
is a recurring theme — you actually enjoy the
work.
