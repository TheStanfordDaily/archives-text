# Too Big to Fail
## Stuff white people are ambivalent about 
### 
It's a new day — at least, according to
will.i.am. I don't know about you, hut
when someone teleports into the CNN
newsroom and starts speaking, I listen.
So, even as the global economy collapses
and our planet corrodes into a noxious waste
land. the good news is that racism is over in
America! Baby, it doesn't matter if you're
black or white — Michael Jackson has long
since evolved into his own species, and the
rest of us are discovering true equality in all
being equally screwed.
Iliat's right, while people. Country clubs
aren't cool any more, and the only person
looking good in J. Crew is Michelle Obama.
Doubtless the end of white societal hege
mony is a good thing, especially considering
that the most significant cultural contribu
tions by Caucasian Americans recently have
been sweaters for dogs and crystal meth.
Still, there are bound to be some hard feel
ings. White people used to be a big deal in
America, and now they're just like everyone
else. Haven't you seen "Gran Torino?"
Nowadays, white people are divided into
two camps: those who check "Stuff White
People Like" on a regular basis, and those
who throw Tupperware parties.
This first kind of white person feels con
flicted. She wants to frolic joyously into the
glorious post-racial future, but even more
than that,she wants to be part of a milieu that
doesn't celebrate chastity balls.
Hail, overzealous yuppie Caucasian, and
embrace me as your true sister! But alas, we
are both deluded.The authors of "Stuff White
People Like" want to convince us that the re
morse and ethnic longing that dictates our
hobbies and tastes is the basis of a legitimate
culture,and we let them.
It's time we be honest with ourselves.To be
white and self-respecting in America right
now is to doubt one's self. And if you don't
know who you are. how do you know what
you actually enjoy?
What follows is a list — admittedly quite
incomplete — of stuff that white people are
ambivalent about. I can't say it's going to help
you any, but if there's anything white people
love right now, it's reading about themselves.
Here we go.
1. Other white people
Don't worry — we're not like the rest of
them. I'm Jewish. You're one-fourth Scandi

navian, three-eighths French, two-sixths Irish
and 6.25 percent Cherokee. And having suc
cessfully linked your whiteness to a cultural
tradition of oppression and/or socialism, you
are now free to identify any remaining white
acquaintances and treat them with appropri
ate contempt.
Kevin Webb, for instance, is one of the few
inexorably white people I know, and though
he owns only 50 percent of this column, he is
by default i(X) percent responsible for the
havoc that white people have wreaked upon
America.
Feel free to email him with your com
plaints about Fox News, NASCAR and the
continued production of "The Hills." He will
take a break from smoking cigars and drink
ing bourbon to smile patronizingly and prom
ise to put you in touch with "his [white] peo
ple."
Because I know that none of that has any
thing to do with us. At least. I'm pretty sure.
2. Russia
Uninterrupted substance abuse. Artificial
ly — and unconvincingly — blond women. A
rich history of bigotry against ethnic and cul
tural minorities. These are just three of the
many things that rural America and Russia
have in common. Yet for some reason, the for
mer territory is "our heartland," while the lat
ter remains a "global nuclear threat."
There must be something to be said of a
country that manages to crank out phone
book-length tomes on a regular basis, though,
right? (Or maybe they just haven't discov
ered You Tube yet.) After all, white people be
lieve firmly in the transcendent power of lit
erature to really bring people together.
Still, it's pretty bad how Russians go
around wearing fur all the time. On the other
hand, who are we to try to impose our own
mores on a culture we don't entirely under
stand?
3. Consumerism
OMG.have you bought the new ninja war
rior app for the iPhone 3G? Neither have I,
because buying stuff is so indulgent and need
lessly wasteful.
But in times like these, shouldn't we be
promoting technological innovation and
boosting the American economy? Sure we
should, which is why I just bought the past
three seasons of "30 Rock" on Amazon. I

It's time we be honest
with ourselves.
To be white and
self-respecting in
America right now is

promise to recycle them when I'm clone, and
to build an orphanage in a third-world coun
try with my bare hands as penance.
I still feel terrible about it, though.
4. Britney Spears/Lindsay Lohan/Jessica
Simpson
The fact that these women are apparently
our only remaining cultural exports goes far
to explain the problems in America today.
Still, there's something deeply appealing
about the underdog — especially if you're
white and fantasize about being one yourself
— and if a 20-something multi-billionaire
struggling with the expectations of a demand
ing and lecherous public father isn't an under
dog, I don't know who is.
Like the current state of the economy,
these starlets' collective demise is undeniable
proof that ours is a broken and mendacious
social system. No one is blameless. Which is
why Jessica Simpson's weight really matters.
Apparently.
5. Bipartisanship
I mean ... it was a really great idea. Wasn't
it?

you actually enjoy?
What follows is a list — admittedly quite
incomplete — of stuff that white people are
ambivalent about. I can't say it's going to help
you any, but if there's anything white people
love right now, it's reading about themselves.
Here we go.
1. Other white people
Don't worry — we're not like the rest of
them. I'm Jewish. You're one-fourth Scandi

navian, three-eighths French, two-sixths Irish
and 6.25 percent Cherokee. And having suc
cessfully linked your whiteness to a cultural
tradition of oppression and/or socialism, you
are now free to identify any remaining white
acquaintances and treat them with appropri
ate contempt.
Kevin Webb, for instance, is one of the few
inexorably white people I know, and though
he owns only 50 percent of this column, he is
by default i(X) percent responsible for the
havoc that white people have wreaked upon
America.
Feel free to email him with your com
plaints about Fox News, NASCAR and the
continued production of "The Hills." He will
take a break from smoking cigars and drink
ing bourbon to smile patronizingly and prom
ise to put you in touch with "his [white] peo
ple."
Because I know that none of that has any
thing to do with us. At least. I'm pretty sure.
2. Russia
Uninterrupted substance abuse. Artificial
ly — and unconvincingly — blond women. A
rich history of bigotry against ethnic and cul
tural minorities. These are just three of the
many things that rural America and Russia
have in common. Yet for some reason, the for
mer territory is "our heartland," while the lat
ter remains a "global nuclear threat."
There must be something to be said of a
country that manages to crank out phone
book-length tomes on a regular basis, though,
right? (Or maybe they just haven't discov
ered You Tube yet.) After all, white people be
lieve firmly in the transcendent power of lit
erature to really bring people together.
Still, it's pretty bad how Russians go
around wearing fur all the time. On the other
hand, who are we to try to impose our own
mores on a culture we don't entirely under
stand?
3. Consumerism
OMG.have you bought the new ninja war
rior app for the iPhone 3G? Neither have I,
because buying stuff is so indulgent and need
lessly wasteful.
But in times like these, shouldn't we be
promoting technological innovation and
boosting the American economy? Sure we
should, which is why I just bought the past
three seasons of "30 Rock" on Amazon. I

It's time we be honest
with ourselves.
To be white and
self-respecting in
America right now is
to doubt one's self.

promise to recycle them when I'm clone, and
to build an orphanage in a third-world coun
try with my bare hands as penance.
I still feel terrible about it, though.
4. Britney Spears/Lindsay Lohan/Jessica
Simpson
The fact that these women are apparently
our only remaining cultural exports goes far
to explain the problems in America today.
Still, there's something deeply appealing
about the underdog — especially if you're
white and fantasize about being one yourself
— and if a 20-something multi-billionaire
struggling with the expectations of a demand
ing and lecherous public father isn't an under
dog, I don't know who is.
Like the current state of the economy,
these starlets' collective demise is undeniable
proof that ours is a broken and mendacious
social system. No one is blameless. Which is
why Jessica Simpson's weight really matters.
Apparently.
5. Bipartisanship
I mean ... it was a really great idea. Wasn't
it?
