No. 6 singles, bringing the match to 2-2.

3-2. but senior Matt Bruch lost a third
set tiebreaker at No. 3 singles, and the
Longhorns evened it up again. 3-3.
So the second day would come
down to the freshman Klahn; and the
16th-ranked player in the nation
showed why he deserved his rank, win
ning a tough, three-set match. After
dropping the first set 6-1. Klahn came
back to win the second set in a long
tiebreaker. In the third, his opponent
began to struggle and cramp, and
Klahn jumped on that opportunity to
capture the set. 7-5.
"It was a gutsy performance,"
Whitlinger said of Klahn's win. "He
was down a set and a break, got down
match point in the tiebreaker."
"It's never over—l don't care

what the score is," lie continued. "You
never know what is going to happen."
In the semifinals, it was the same
start for the Cardinal: Losing the dou
bles point. Bruch and Thacher won at
No. 2 doubles, while Klahn and fresh
man led Kelly lost at No. 3, so it came
down to Wire and Muller again at the
No. I spot. A back-and-forth match
was tied at 8-<S.but
Georgia's 40th-ranked duo of Nate
Schnugg and Jamie Hunt outlasted

them to secure the 1-0 advantage in the
match.
The doubles point proved to be a
big momentum swing in the match, as
Stanford could not overcome the 1-0
deficit like the two days before.
Thacher and Wire won at No.4and No.
5 singles, respectively, to give the Car
dinal a 2-1 lead, but losses by Clayton

give Georgia the 4-2 victory.
"[Losing the doubles point) killed
us in the end," said Wire of the doubles
play overall. "We lost a few close
ones."
"We need to show up for doubles a
bit, we need to be a little bit better
there," Whitlineer said. "We couldn't

pull off a doubles win. but we're not
that far off."
"We all felt we can play a lot better
than we did," he continued. "And we
will."

honors for his performance at the
tournament.

after its big weekend, however. Stan
ford will get right back on the courts

this weekend with two more matches.
The men will take on No. 20 Pepper
dine. who eliminated the Cardinal
from the NCAA Tournament last
year, this Friday at Taube Family Ten
nis Center. On Saturday, the ( ardinal
travels to Berkeley for a tough match
against its Bay Area rival.
"We have a really tough weekend
coming up." Whitlinger said. "We just
can't walk on the court because we did
well in Chicago... that doesn't mean
anything. It puts a target on our back.
We've got to be ready to play."

back to win the second set in a long
tiebreaker. In the third, his opponent
began to struggle and cramp, and
Klahn jumped on that opportunity to
capture the set. 7-5.

was down a set and a break, got down
match point in the tiebreaker."
"It's never over—l don't care

what the score is," lie continued. "You
never know what is going to happen."
In the semifinals, it was the same
start for the Cardinal: Losing the dou

No. 2 doubles, while Klahn and fresh
man led Kelly lost at No. 3, so it came
down to Wire and Muller again at the
No. I spot. A back-and-forth match
was tied at 8-<S.but

big momentum swing in the match, as
Stanford could not overcome the 1-0
deficit like the two days before.

us in the end," said Wire of the doubles
play overall. "We lost a few close
ones."
"We need to show up for doubles a
bit, we need to be a little bit better
there," Whitlineer said. "We couldn't

pull off a doubles win. but we're not
that far off."
"We all felt we can play a lot better
than we did," he continued. "And we
will."
