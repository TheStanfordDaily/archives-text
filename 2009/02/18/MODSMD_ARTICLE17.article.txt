The Stanford women's water polo
team made the most out of a rare
respite between two tough tourna
ments. defeating Sonoma State 19-7
and UC-Santa Cruz 19-4 in a Valen
tine's Day doubleheader.
Coming off of a third-place finish in
the Stanford Invitational — whieh fea
tured four top-10 teams — and while
preparing for the Irvine Invitational
this weekend. Stanford enjoyed squar
ing off against the two Bay Area teams
with a combined record of 3-7.
Ibe doubleheader got off to an

early start with an 11 a.m. face-off. hut
Stanford quickly blew Sonoma State
out of the water. After two Stanford
scores to begin the match, the Sea
wolves fought their way back to within
one goal, but that would be the closest
they would come. Within a fren/ied
two-minute span stretching from the
end of the first quarter to the begin
ning of the second. Stanford scored
three goals to crush any dreams Sono
ma State had of an upset. Five more
Cardinal goals in the second quarter
only cemented the inevitable.

CHRIS SEEWALD/The Stanford Daily
Senior driver Kira Hillman looks for a shooting opening for the Stanford women's water polo team. The Cardinal
demolished its two opponents this weekend, beating Sonoma State 19-7 and UC-Santa Cruz 1 9-4.
Against Santa Cruz, Stanford used
the same recipe for victory, jumping
out to a nine-point lead at halftime and
never looking back.
The real story of the day was the
freshman class, though.
All six freshmen on the team
scored at least once, combining for 20
goals in the two games. As has been the
case all this season, freshman phenom
Melissa Seidemann led the entire
team, scoring seven goals on the day,
four against the Seawolves and three
against the Banana Slugs. Cassie
Churnside and Pallavi Menon. two
freshmen improving with every game,
added hat tricks of their own against
Santa Cruz to complement Seide
mann's. Fellow freshmen Alyssa Lo
and Mimi Bury each scored twice on
the day, while Monica Coughlan got
into the net once.
"We planned to spread the playing
time around this past weekend." head
coach John Tanner said. "The week
end before we had five games, but
most were verv challenging games

against top-10 teams."
Not to be completely outdone by
the freshmen, the upperclassmen also
had some career days. Senior Koree
Blyleven matched Seidemann goal
for-goal in the first contest and junior
Kelly Eaton notched her third hat
trick of the season.
While Sonoma State and Santa
Cruz are by no means strong competi
tion, Stanford should still be feeling
confident heading into the Irvine Invi
tational this coming weekend. The
Card has a tough bracket in the Invita
tional. with all three other teams
ranked among the top 25. Stanford
opens up the tournament against No.
16 UC-San Diego on Feb. 21 before
playing No. 9 Loyola Marvmount and
No. 8 San Jose State.
Playing so many tough teams in
such a short time can pose problems
for any team. Doubleheaders com
bined with the Southern California
heat means fatigue will definitely be a
factor. Fortunately for the Cardinal,
the games against Sonoma State and
Santa Cruz proved Stanford has the
depth necessary to combat the fatigue.
The freshman class not only showed it
can play well enough to give the
starters a short break, but that it can be
a potential game-changing force.

The goalkeeper situation is another
development from the Sonoma State-
Santa Cruz doubleheader that could
he a difference in the Irvine Invitation
al. Throughout the first six games of
the season,sophomores Amber Oland
and Kim I (all have been splitting time
in the cage. Yet in the doubleheader.
Hall played both games, blocking 12
shots.
"The goalies will each continue to
play significant roles, but Amber is our
starting goalie,"Tanner said.
While the goalkeeping has been a
bright spot on defense this season, it is
one of very few. Seven goals allowed to
a sub-par Sonoma State team and four
to an even worse Santa Cruz squad is
simply not good enough for the tough
competition that the Cardinal will face
at the Irvine Invitational.
"We've played below my expecta
tions on defense," Tanner said. "We
give up too many easy goals and will
need to make some major strides
quickly."
If Stanford tightens up its defense
slightly, the Cardinal can continue to
rely on its high-octane offense to be
successful in Irvine.
