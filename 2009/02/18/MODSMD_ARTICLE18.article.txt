### ANTHONY NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The No. 5 Stanford women's ten
nis team suffered two surprising
dual-match losses last weekend at
the2(K)9 ITA National Team Indoor
Championships, where the top-16
collegiate programs in the nation
convened to duke it out in the first
real test of the season.
Two years removed from their
last Indoor title, Stanford was look
ing to reclaim the Championship
after an auspicious 4-0 start to the
dual match season. After qualifying
in early February. Stanford was
making its 15th appearance at the
Championships in Madison, Wis.
With over 64 wins at the Indoors
and nine national titles, Stanford
had history on its side.
However, in a surprising turn of
events. Stanford quickly bowed out
in the first round of action in a 4-3
loss to No. 14 Notre Dame.
"Losing is always difficult,"
sophomore Hilary Barte said. "Just
seeing the top-16 teams there — it's
so close, it's unbelievable. I knew it
would be a dogfight, and of course
it's disappointing."
In their first-round match, the
Cardinal women took the doubles
point with wins by senior Jessica
Nguyen and sophomore Carolyn
McVeigh.as well as sophomore Jen
nifer Yen and freshman Logan
Hansen. The top duo of Barte and
junior Lindsay Burdette suffered an
8-4 loss at the hands of the top
ranked doubles team in the nation.
With two three-set victories by
Barte and Burdette in singles, Stan
ford jumped out to a seemingly in
surmountable 3-1 lead. However,
the lead was short-lived as the Fight
ing Irish stormed back with three
straight singles victories.
Nguyen would fall 7-5,6-3 to No.
39 Kristy Frilling of Notre Dame.
Yen also dropped her match 6-4,6-3
to Shannon Mathews. Eventually,
Notre Dame's Kristen Rafael
clinched the match with a 7-5. 6-1
victory over McVeigh to upset a
hopeful Stanford squad.
"They actually played pretty
well." Barte said. "I honestly didn't

felt good in my other two matches —
I just fought through those two. When
I played Julia. I felt pretty good. I was
hitting the ball well and I just tried to
focus the whole match, taking it one

point at a time.
The loss brings the Cardinal's
record to 5-2 in the season. Its next
matchup will come this Thursday
against Saint Mary's at home. Stan
ford looks forward to returning back
to the Farm, where it is 138-0 since the
