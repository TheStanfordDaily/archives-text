convened to duke it out in the first
real test of the season.

last Indoor title, Stanford was look

dual match season. After qualifying

making its 15th appearance at the
Championships in Madison, Wis.

and nine national titles, Stanford
had history on its side.
However, in a surprising turn of
events. Stanford quickly bowed out
in the first round of action in a 4-3
loss to No. 14 Notre Dame.
"Losing is always difficult,"
sophomore Hilary Barte said. "Just

so close, it's unbelievable. I knew it
would be a dogfight, and of course
it's disappointing."
In their first-round match, the
Cardinal women took the doubles
point with wins by senior Jessica
Nguyen and sophomore Carolyn
McVeigh.as well as sophomore Jen
nifer Yen and freshman Logan
Hansen. The top duo of Barte and
junior Lindsay Burdette suffered an
8-4 loss at the hands of the top
ranked doubles team in the nation.
With two three-set victories by
Barte and Burdette in singles, Stan

surmountable 3-1 lead. However,
the lead was short-lived as the Fight

straight singles victories.
Nguyen would fall 7-5,6-3 to No.
39 Kristy Frilling of Notre Dame.
Yen also dropped her match 6-4,6-3
to Shannon Mathews. Eventually,

clinched the match with a 7-5. 6-1
victory over McVeigh to upset a
hopeful Stanford squad.
