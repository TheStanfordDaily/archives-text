# Boring times for sports fans
## 
### 
Whoever invented the calendar years ago
had some kind of foresight to make Feb
ruary the shortest month of the year. Or
at least he or she was a sports fan.
Mv lack of inspiration this week. I have realized, is a
manifestation of the monotony of sports throughout
this entire month.
In past years, I have had Stanford basketball making
a run at the Pac-10 championship to hold my attention
through the dog days of February. But this year, it has
only provided me with a series of heart breaks. Instead
I am left without sufficient sports to watch each week
end — a hole of sorts in my life.
I almost broke down and watched the Davtona 500

this weekend. (Yeah, that was on Sunday, in case you
missed it). Don't worry,though, I didn't — hut that was
only after realizing I could simply sit in a crane on cam
pus and watch cars go around the Campus Drive loop
and get the same stimulation.
Come to think of it. watching cars going around the
Campus Drive loop may he a little more entertaining.
Seeing how they maneuver around the construction
everywhere might have been quite a sight. Too bad it
was raining, and I was stuck inside — with nothing to
watch.
I can hear the naysayers now. "The NBA All-Star
