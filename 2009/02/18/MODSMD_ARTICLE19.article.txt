# Boring times for sports fans
## 
### 
Whoever invented the calendar years ago
had some kind of foresight to make Feb
ruary the shortest month of the year. Or
at least he or she was a sports fan.
Mv lack of inspiration this week. I have realized, is a
manifestation of the monotony of sports throughout
this entire month.
In past years, I have had Stanford basketball making
a run at the Pac-10 championship to hold my attention
through the dog days of February. But this year, it has
only provided me with a series of heart breaks. Instead
I am left without sufficient sports to watch each week
end — a hole of sorts in my life.
I almost broke down and watched the Davtona 500

this weekend. (Yeah, that was on Sunday, in case you
missed it). Don't worry,though, I didn't — hut that was
only after realizing I could simply sit in a crane on cam
pus and watch cars go around the Campus Drive loop
and get the same stimulation.
Come to think of it. watching cars going around the
Campus Drive loop may he a little more entertaining.
Seeing how they maneuver around the construction
everywhere might have been quite a sight. Too bad it
was raining, and I was stuck inside — with nothing to
watch.
I can hear the naysayers now. "The NBA All-Star


Daniel
Bohm
Game was this weekend." Oh,
please. The NBA All-Star Game,
maybe only with the exception of the
Pro Bowl ( which is also in February,
by the way), is the biggest bastardiza
tion of sport.
All-Star Saturday has turned into
a circus — except that it is excruciat
ingly boring and sometimes uncom
fortable to watch. Nobody wanted to
see Bill Laimbeer. all 300 or so
pounds of him. out there chucking
half court shots in some gimmicky
competition.
TTie Skills Competition was just
as bad, with all four participants
making their way through the obsta
cle course as if they were jogging

through a pregame walkthrough, not
in a competition with millions of
viewers.
That brings me to the Dunk Con
test and the All-Star Game itself.
Every dunk has been done before.
Every single dunk. Nate Robinson
jumped over someone when he won
the Dunk Contest a few years ago.
and guess what — he did the same
thing this year. Yeah. Dwight
Howard dunked on a 12-foot hoop.
Cool. Last year he put a sticker at 12
feet on a regular hoop. Same idea.
In the game itself. I enjoyed the
defense the East played in the sec
ond half — a well-constructed zone
that made sure nobody on the West
was guarded. There was plenty of
skill out there, but you can find bet
ter basketball being played at Arril
laga any day of the week.
There is one ray of hope in the
dark abyss known as February, and

that came this past Friday when
pitchers and catchers reported to
Spring Training. But of course no
good deed can go unpunished. In
stead of enjoying the unofficial first
day of spring, baseball fans have to
be subjected to another Spring
Training being overwhelmed with
steroid controversy.
So, as I sit and count the remain
ing days in this wretched month, all I
can do is look forward to the future
and find solace in sports I might not
be as accustomed to. March Mad
ness. maybe the most exciting time of
the year in sports, is less than a
month away. Opening Day in base
ball, as well as the NBA and NHL
playoffs, is coming up in April.
Until then. I guess I will look to
my school's sports for support. Stan
ford baseball opens its season at
home against Vanderbilt on Friday.
The undefeated Stanford Lacrosse
team takes on national powers
SUNY-Albany and Syracuse today
and tomorrow.
So. if you are like me and you
have the February blues, maybe I
will see you out there supporting
your school, if for no other reason
than not having any sports to watch
on TV. And don't sweat — there are
only ten more davs.

Dan Bohm needs to borrow a crane. If
you have one, let him know at
bohmd@stanford.edu.
