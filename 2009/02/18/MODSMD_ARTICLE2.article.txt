## Profs. speak on stimulus package Obama signs stimulus package in Denver 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
President Barack Ohama signed his
$787 billion stimulus plan into law on
Tuesday, calling it the "beginning of the
first steps" to fix the nation's ailing econ
omy. The plan, once enacted, will
strengthen the social safety net. provide
tax breaks and allow for investment in
education, energy research and infra
structure. among other categories.
Ilie bill is a critical piece of govern
ment efforts to pull the economy out of
the current recession, and President
Ohama has said its success will deter
mine his success as president. But in
interviews with The Daily, Medical
School Prof. Jay Bhattacharya and
Business School Prof. Neil Malhotra
were cautious about the bill's prospects.
Bhattacharya M.I). '97 Ph.D. (M) is an
associate professor of medicine and. by
courtesy, a professor in health research
and policy and economics.
"it's sort of funny to call it a stimu
lus." Bhattacharya said. "It's more like a
package aimed at shielding people from
the worst problems resulting from job
lessness."
Malhotra. assistant professor of polit
ical economy at the Graduate School of
Business, said the proposal has a combi
nation of both stimulatory and non-stim
ulatory undertakings. The overall
approach, however, is firmly rooted in
government spending.
"You approach this difficult policy
and there's only sort of two ways to stim
ulate the economy: fiscal policy and
monetary policy," Malhotra said. "Given
that interest rates are basically zero
already and that consumption is very low
in the United States, government spend
ing is the only way to stimulate the econ
omy."
Malhotra noted that public support
increased as the president traveled from
city to city to advertise the recovery
package to the American public.
"In general, people like the Obama
administration â€” it's very popular,"
Malhotra stated. "They want to sort of

chance to implement the proposal he
wants."
But Malhotra emphasized that
public support for the recovery pack
age is highly sensitive to the price tag.
"Unfortunately, the sensitivity to
the one-trillion-dollar threshold is a
political reason for why the optimal
economic policy may not have been
passed." Malhotra said.
He suggested that Obama con
sciously decided not to push for more
than a trillion dollars because of the
possible public fall-out.
Adding to the list of weaknesses
in the stimulus package,
Bhattacharya noted that certain com
ponents of the bill seem to contradict
one another. I le was especially criti
cal of federal funding marked for
healthcare.
"It is not so much (that] this part
will stimulate the economy in any
particular way." he said. "On the con
trary, it's likely to result in a drag in
the sense that it will tend to increase
unemployment."
What Bhattacharya refers to is the
federal government's aim to provide
insurance coverage for individuals

who have lost their jobs. According to
the professor, this goal involves two
policies: expanding the Consolidated
Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act
(COBRA) and providing an $87 bil
lion bailout of state Medicaid pro
grams.
"COBRA is a program where
people who lose their jobs and have
health insurance can continue to pur
chase health insurance from their old
employer for up to IS months while
they're unemployed." Bhattacharya
said. "They're going to subsidize 65
percent of the premium that these
unemployed people pay ... that's a
significant expansion of the COBRA
program because, before, the govern
ment didn't subsidize anything."
At the same time, more individu
als will qualify for Medicaid because
of increased health care funding.
Bhattacharya said the two pro
grams are not stimulatory in nature,
but instead act as government trans
fers to people who are unemployed
or not even lix)king for work. And
while providing healthcare coverage
is a worthwhile pursuit, he noted that
sacrifices must be made to realize this
objective.
"If you put these together, it's like
ly to substantially decrease the num
ber of uninsured people despite the
recession," Bhattacharya said. " Ihe
tradeoff is that it's likely to reduce

incentives for employment. You don't
want people uninsured or without
access to healthcare, but il you pro
vide them insurance conditioned on
their not working, then that lowers
the costs of unemployment."
Malhotra added that some highly
stimulatory polices got the ax during
negotiations. According to Malhotra.
a significant portion of education
funding and direct money to the
states was stripped out. even though
these policies would have the desired
stimulus effect.
"You see a lot of support shifting
when the proposal is framed as pre
venting a collapse versus boosting the
economy." Malhotra added. "If
you've notice what Obama is doing,
he's taking on a very alarmist stance,
trying to scare people. And I would
suggest that that's very effective."
But Malhotra contended that
Obama could have very well asked
for more money during negotiations,
given his popularity with the
American public.
"I le has a lot of political capital,"
Malhotra said. "Spending political cap
ital means you don't have it anvmore,
but that's the dual edge ... you've got
to spend some political capital that's
going to make you unpopular."
