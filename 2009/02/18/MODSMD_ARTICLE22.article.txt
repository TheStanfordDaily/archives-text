## Card extends schoolrecord win streak 
### KENAN JIANG STAFF WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford women's gym
nastics team extended its school record
streak to 11 wins in a row at home on
Feb. 15 at Maples Pavilion. The Cardi
nal won with 197.025 points, beating
Oregon State's 196.6 and UC-Davis'
191.55. This was the last regular season
home meet for the seniors, but they will
get to compete at the Farm again when
they vie for the conference title on
March 21 in the Pac-10championships.
After a setback with Arizona State
on Jan. 22. when the Cardinal narrowly
edged out the Sun Devils, Stanford
stepped up with wins against Arizona.
UCLA, Oregon State and two victories
against Davis. The team hopes its mo
mentum will carry them on against Cal
ifornia on Feb. 22. Davis and San Jose
State on Feb. 27 and Alabama on
March 6. before the Pac-10 champi
onships and NCAA championships.
Last weekend's win bodes well for the
Cardinal.especially since Stanford beat
out Oregon State, the runner up in last
year's Pac-10 championships, for the
conference title last year.
"This year is the first time that we've
been able to focus on perfecting little
deductions this early in the season,"
said captain, junior Carly Janiga. "Usu
ally we spend the beginning of the sea
son focusing on making our routines,
and then as season progresses, we start
to focus on eliminating small knee
bends and stuck landings."
"This season, we started making our
routines from the beginning, which en
abled us to focus on little deductions,"
Janiga added."! don't want to take any
thing away from our success this year;

however, I will say that we have not
been really challenged this year. We
haven't gone up against any top-three
teams, so we are really excited to com
pete against them."
Nearing the home stretch of their
regular season, the Stanford gymnasts
have increased the difficulty of their
routines, as well as adjusting small,
technical issues such as knee bends to
avoid deductions on their individual
scores, which will make the difference
between the national champion and
the other top teams come the NCAA
Tournament.

"We need to show
case our depth on
all four events."
— CARLY JANIGA
junior captain

For the second consecutive week.
Stanford went above 197 points, and
also set 11 individual season bests, one
team event best and a season-high
mark. Janiga's 9.95 marked the season
high, which she achieved on the bal
ance beam.
Senior Nicole Ourada stepped up
on senior night to win the all-around
event.Ourada is ranked N0.2 in the na
tion and beat out Janiga by scoring a
39.5, compared to Janiga's 39.475. Jani
ga also tied her career-best on the beam
as Stanford achieved a season-best
team score of 49.4 in the event. Oura
da's and Janiga's consistently hieh

scores eased the pressure on their
teammates, as none of Stanford's gym
nasts scored below a 9.775. Oregon
State proved to be no easy competi
tion, though.as they scored 49s on each
event rotation.
Junior Allyse Ishino stepped up with
9.9 on the bars and 9.85 on the beam,
twoseason bests.while freshman Nicole
Pechanec's floor exercise earned her a
9.875 — a collegiate best for the ( V.ech
national team member. Other impres
sive performances included sophomore
Shelley Alexander's beam and floor
routines, which earned her scores of
9.85 on both events. Senior Kelly Fee
also had a strong showing in the floor,
posting a 9.875.
Ixist week. Stanford became the
newest member of the 197 point club as
only six university teams have achieved
the mark or higher this year. I During the
first five weeks of the season (begin
ning with the new year), national rank
ings were calculated by total season av
erage. while starting Feb. 9. rankings
have been calculated on regional qual
ifying score, which will be the score the
Cardinal uses to qualify for Pac-lOs.
The regional qualifying score is based
on a team's and an all-around competi
tor's six best regular season meet
scores, with three of them calculated
from away meets. The high score is
eliminated and the rest of the five
scores are averaged for the regional
qualifying score.
"In the next few meets, we need to
work on our landings, make some up
grades and get new people into the
lineup to showcase our depth on all
four events." Janiga said. "A personal
goal of mine is to stick my vault landing.
Ilie vault team has been hard at work
every day training our bodies to stick
under pressure on the hard surface."
