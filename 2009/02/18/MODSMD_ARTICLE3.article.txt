ExxonMobil Chairman and CEO Rex
Tillerson spoke to a packed McCaw Hall
yesterday about the future of the world's
energy supply and his company's surpris
ing support of a carbon tax.
The Global Climate and Energy
Project (GCEP) at Stanford hosted
Tillerson for a talk on global energy and
environmental challenges.
"Hie best and brightest minds gath
ered here at Stanford and throughout
GCEP's international network of
research institutions have the potential
to help lead a long-term technological
transformation of the global energy sys
tem," Tillerson said.
As University President John
Hennessy noted in his introduction.
ExxonMobil is the leading sponsor for
GCEP and it intends to invest up to $ 1 < X)
million in the project's research over 10

years.
"We are deeply grateful for the gener
ous support given to us at Stanford by
ExxonMobil in allowing us to pursue this
goal through the Global Climate and
Energy Project and for recognizing the
critical role that fundamental science and
technology breakthroughs will play in
meeting these opportunities and chal

GCEP.

myself gives support for a new tax."

the risk management challenges that we

is the best source of effective policy
action."
He still maintained that oil and natu

future, describing them as "abundant.

available, versatile and affordable." He
also stressed that his primary loyalty is to
his company.
"I don't have being in alternative fuels
as an objective ... my objective is to pre
serve and grow shareholder values," he
said.
However, Tillerson also noted that
new and alternative forms of energy
should be explored.
"GCEP's research is high-risk; fail
ures will likely outnumber successes." he
said. "But the research conducted here is
also potentially high-yield. It may contain
the seeds of a true technological transfor
mation."
Following the lecture, both Hennessy
and Jeffery Koseff, director of the Woods
Institute for the Environment, expressed
their surprise and pleasure at Tillerson's
comments on a carbon tax.
"It reflects how a lot of things have
