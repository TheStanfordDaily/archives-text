# EXXON CEO SPEAKS
## Tillerson adresses energy sources, carbon tax 
### JENNY REMPEL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
ExxonMobil Chairman and CEO Rex
Tillerson spoke to a packed McCaw Hall
yesterday about the future of the world's
energy supply and his company's surpris
ing support of a carbon tax.
The Global Climate and Energy
Project (GCEP) at Stanford hosted
Tillerson for a talk on global energy and
environmental challenges.
"Hie best and brightest minds gath
ered here at Stanford and throughout
GCEP's international network of
research institutions have the potential
to help lead a long-term technological
transformation of the global energy sys
tem," Tillerson said.
As University President John
Hennessy noted in his introduction.
ExxonMobil is the leading sponsor for
GCEP and it intends to invest up to $ 1 < X)
million in the project's research over 10

years.
"We are deeply grateful for the gener
ous support given to us at Stanford by
ExxonMobil in allowing us to pursue this
goal through the Global Climate and
Energy Project and for recognizing the
critical role that fundamental science and
technology breakthroughs will play in
meeting these opportunities and chal
lenges." said Sally Benson, director of
GCEP.
One of Tillerson's most striking state
ments was his support for a carbon tax.
"It's rare that a business person like
myself gives support for a new tax."
Tillerson noted, "but in this case, given
the risk management challenges that we
face, and the alternatives under consider
ation. it is my judgment that a carbon tax
is the best source of effective policy
action."
He still maintained that oil and natu
ral gas are vital for our world's energy
future, describing them as "abundant.

available, versatile and affordable." He
also stressed that his primary loyalty is to
his company.
"I don't have being in alternative fuels
as an objective ... my objective is to pre
serve and grow shareholder values," he
said.
However, Tillerson also noted that
new and alternative forms of energy
should be explored.
"GCEP's research is high-risk; fail
ures will likely outnumber successes." he
said. "But the research conducted here is
also potentially high-yield. It may contain
the seeds of a true technological transfor
mation."
Following the lecture, both Hennessy
and Jeffery Koseff, director of the Woods
Institute for the Environment, expressed
their surprise and pleasure at Tillerson's
comments on a carbon tax.
"It reflects how a lot of things have

changed in the past few years about
the acknowledged importance of
dealing with the issue and milking
forward progress, and a realization
that the carbon tax would be the
most effective tool to really address
it," Hennessy said.
But Koseff was less enthusiastic
in his analysis.
"The fact that he recognized the
importance of doing something
about it... that recognition is prob
ably the most important and promis
ing thing I've heard today," he said.
Another point that resonated
with Koseff was Ullerson's emphasis
on the long-term nature of finding
solutions for global energy prob
lems.
"What we need is a national
energy policy that transcends gov
ernments, that transcends the period
of time of people in the legislature,"
Koseff said. "We have to think lone

term and we have to follow through
on it. But on the other hand, long
term doesn't mean we can procrasti
nate. We have to start now."
1 lennessy was also pleased with a
long-term approach.
"It's not a 10- or 20-year prob
lem. which is why we got involved
with GCEP and started the Precourt
Institute (for Energy]," he said. "We
don't start an institute for a one-year
problem; we start an institute for a
50-year problem."
Following the lecture. Franklin
Orr, director of the Precourt Institute,
led a question-and-answer session.
Several audience members asked
sharply pointed questions regarding
ExxonMobil's role in the failed U.S.
signing of the Kyoto Treaty.
One question regarding drilling
in the U.S. brought some disgruntled
stares from the audience but seemed
to motivate the Exxon CEO.
" Hie U.S. has a rich resource
endowment that has not been fully
explored or tapped, and it seems
irresponsible to me if our govern
ment — at a time when we're having
these energy issues —to withhold

these resources from the American
citizens," lillerson said. "They
belong to you and me."
Tillerson focused extensively on
the need for continued research and
development in the area of global
energy resources. He emphasized
that Exxon carried out extensive
research in the field both within the
company and through donations to
groups such as GCEP.
"There's one element that should
unite every stage of our efforts to
attain our shared energy and envi
ronmental goals," he said, "and that
element is technology."
