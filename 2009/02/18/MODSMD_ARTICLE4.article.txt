## Row move-in to be delayed AAB makes move to reduce risk of drinking incidents during NSO 
### JULIE KLEIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At a meeting for Row managers last night.
Stanford's Alcohol Advisory Board (AAB)
announced its recommendation to change the Row
house move-in date, starting fall 2009. in hopes of
decreasing alcohol-related incidents prior to the
start of the academic year.
The AAB. which is comprised of students, facul
ty and staff, submitted a proposal for all upperclass
men to return to campus on the same date — after
New Student Orientation (NSO) begins. Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Greg Boardman
approved the recommendation, which comes on the
heels of several alcohol-related incidents on the
Row during this past year's NSO.
According to Vaden Substance Abuse
Prevention Program Manager and AAB co-chair
Ralph Castro, the recommendation was "based
upon theory and research." If students spend fewer
days on campus prior to the start of classes, high-risk
alcohol-related incidents could be reduced.
"The Alcohol Advisory Board took its time in
systematically reviewing the issue and listened care
fully to the concerns and viewpoints of the students
who sit on the Board." Castro wrote in a released
memorandum. "The Board discussed and debated
the pros and cons of the current Row opening date
and its relationship to the inappropriate use and
mismanagement of alcohol. In the end. the Board
voted unanimously to recommend that the Row
move-in date be changed to best ensure the health
and safety of the campus community during NSO."
In past years. Row house residents were allowed
to move in before NSO began, while other upper
classmen could not move in until the Thursday
before classes started. In addition, under a provision
of the NSO alcohol policy, students of legal drinking
age are allowed to privately consume alcohol in
moderation and Row houses without freshmen or
transfer students may host up to two closed, resi
dent-only gatherings where alcohol may be served.
When the AAB convened in October, it planned
to conduct an annual review of the NSO alcohol
policy, especially in response to the recent alcohol
incidents. The board instead spent the quarter eval
uating the move-in date for Row houses.
Koren Bakkegard. assistant dean of freshmen
and co-chair of the AAB. acknowledged how the
board unexpectedly spent the quarter addressing an
issue other than the NSO alcohol policy.
"There was an elephant in the room." Bakkegard
said. "Row move-in date was different from all
other upperclass residences,and it was an important
issue to address separate from the policy review
itself."
Bakkegard explained, however, that the Row
house move-in date and the NSC)
alcohol policy are certainly not unre
lated.
"We look at these discretely," she
said, "but they are connected."
The AAB will begin its review of
the NSO alcohol policy in particular
next week.
Assistant Director of Residential
Education Nate Boswell. who over
sees the Row, explained that reasons
for the Row's early move-in date are
now obsolete.
"There was no operational need
to have the Row open to all upper
class students [before NSO],"
Boswell said.
In a released statement,
Boardman similarly noted "there is
no compelling reason for the Row's
early opening. Postponing the Row
move-in date makes it consistent
with all other upperclass dorms and
will reduce the number of alcohol
related risks."
Row house staff members, in
addition to residents who gain uni
versity approval, will still be
allowed to move in early.The policy

applies to all university-owned
houses. ITiere is currently no con
clusion, however, for private title
houses, including Sigma Chi and
Chi Theta Chi.
When asked if Santa Clara
County's new ordinance for under
age drinking — from which
Stanford was exempt for the time
being because of its own oversight
influenced the AAB's recom
mendation. Castro acknowledged
that there was some correlation.
"It's not a direct influence," he
said, "but it's definitely something
that is on our minds."
"It is an opportunity to show due
diligence on Stanford's part."
Bakkegard added.
At last night's meeting, the AAB
shared its recommendation with
Row managers. The managers were
informed in part so they could
share the new policy with residents.
Hie co-chairs admitted, however,
that the recommendation will not
likely have a significant effect on
the Draw, especially due to the new
Draw policies this year.
"I would think it would have
very little impact," Bakkegard said.
"The landscape for housing will be
very different next year anyway."
Lindsay Caldwell '09, a residen
tial assistant (RA) in Durand, said

most students in attendance did not
react strongly to the announcement.
"I think people understand the
rationale." Caldwell said. "The ques
tion was: Is this the start of a lot
more changes?"
Nate Hardison '09. who currently
lives in Casa Italiana. said he has not
always taken advantage of the early
move-in date, even though it was
available.
"The only years 1 came back
early were when 1 was a peer mentor
and a residential assistant," he said.
Under the new policy, peer mentors
and RAs will still be able to move in
early.
While the new policy may seem
more of a logistical issue with
regard to move-in. administrators
acknowledged its contribution
toward reducing poor drinking
behavior during NSO. Castro recog
nized. however, that the change in
those few days of orientation is only
one step toward addressing alcohol
abuse on campus throughout the
year.
"Do 1 think it will cure all our
problems?" Castro asked of the
AAB recommendation. "No. but it's
a step in the right direction."
