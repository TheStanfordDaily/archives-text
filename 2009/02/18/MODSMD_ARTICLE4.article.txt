## Row move-in to be delayed AAB makes move to reduce risk of drinking incidents during NSO 
### JULIE KLEIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
At a meeting for Row managers last night.
Stanford's Alcohol Advisory Board (AAB)
announced its recommendation to change the Row
house move-in date, starting fall 2009. in hopes of
decreasing alcohol-related incidents prior to the
start of the academic year.
The AAB. which is comprised of students, facul
ty and staff, submitted a proposal for all upperclass
men to return to campus on the same date â€” after
New Student Orientation (NSO) begins. Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Greg Boardman
approved the recommendation, which comes on the
heels of several alcohol-related incidents on the
Row during this past year's NSO.
According to Vaden Substance Abuse
Prevention Program Manager and AAB co-chair
Ralph Castro, the recommendation was "based
upon theory and research." If students spend fewer
days on campus prior to the start of classes, high-risk
alcohol-related incidents could be reduced.
"The Alcohol Advisory Board took its time in
systematically reviewing the issue and listened care
fully to the concerns and viewpoints of the students
who sit on the Board." Castro wrote in a released
memorandum. "The Board discussed and debated
the pros and cons of the current Row opening date
and its relationship to the inappropriate use and
mismanagement of alcohol. In the end. the Board
voted unanimously to recommend that the Row
move-in date be changed to best ensure the health
and safety of the campus community during NSO."
In past years. Row house residents were allowed
to move in before NSO began, while other upper
classmen could not move in until the Thursday
before classes started. In addition, under a provision
of the NSO alcohol policy, students of legal drinking
age are allowed to privately consume alcohol in
moderation and Row houses without freshmen or
transfer students may host up to two closed, resi
dent-only gatherings where alcohol may be served.
When the AAB convened in October, it planned
to conduct an annual review of the NSO alcohol
policy, especially in response to the recent alcohol
incidents. The board instead spent the quarter eval
uating the move-in date for Row houses.
Koren Bakkegard. assistant dean of freshmen
and co-chair of the AAB. acknowledged how the
board unexpectedly spent the quarter addressing an
issue other than the NSO alcohol policy.
"There was an elephant in the room." Bakkegard
said. "Row move-in date was different from all
other upperclass residences,and it was an important
issue to address separate from the policy review
itself."
Bakkegard explained, however, that the Row
