## ASSU launches bystander campaign 
### CALLA SHENG 
The ASSU recently launched the"I Am
Not a Bystander" campaign in an effort to
involve the greater student Kklv in address
ing mental health, sexual assault and other
community issues on campus.
The campaign seeks to improve the
wellbeing of Stanford students by correct
ing the attitude of those "unaware, unsure
or unconcerned about how to help others in
difficult situations." according to the cam
paign's Web site, bystander.stanford.edu.
"|( )ur goal is| to create a campus culture
where it is the norm to look out for each
other instead of standing by,"said I ila Kalaf
'10. Health co-chair for the ASSU
Executives and initiator of the campaign.
"This kind of change can only come from
within the student body. It can't come from
someone else prescribing our attitude
change."
Through the campaign, students take an
online pledge to no longer act as bystanders.
They can wear the"I Am Not a Bystander"
pin. or put up posters on their doors to let
others know about their willingness to help
with difficult problems.
The campaign concerns itself with issues

of relationship abuse, sexual assault, intoler
ance. alcohol abuse, eating disorders, stress,
depression and physical violence on cam
pus.
"The two [barriers to taking action]
we're trying to target is the lack of aware
ness of the problem and the lack of knowl
edge of what you can do." said Jasmine
Dobbs-Marsh TO. and ASSU Executive
health fellow and one of the organizers of
the campaign.
The campaign Web site takes students
through a series of harmful situations. For
each of them, it details four helpful ways to
reverse the bystander's inaction. At the end.
the students are invited to electronically
sign the pledge to no longer act as a
bystander.
For students to act on their new aware
ness and implement the "anti-bystander"
message in their everyday lives, the Web site
also connects them to various campus
resources. Organizers are working with
Residential Education to plan dorm discus
sions. as well as put up a talk by nationally
renowned activist Jackson Kat/ on violence
against women next Tuesday.
With collaborators ranging from Vaden
1 lealth Center to Stanford Theatre Activist

Mobilization Project (STAMP), the cam
paign has garnered wide-ranging support.
Kalaf said that the organizers have been
"fortunate enough to have a lot of different
kinds of people involved and excited about
this message," and to have come up with "a
unified way of dealing with these issues."
According to Kalaf. the campaign focus
es students' attention on problems "that
were kind of flipped under the rug."
"A lot of people don't know what a big
problem relationship abuse or sexual
assault is on campus," she said. "Ixtst year,
there were 14 reported sexual assaults. That
is not close to what might actually be going
on, on campus. With eating disorders, we
only have the national stats of about four
percent incidence rate. Hut as anyone who
lives on Stanford campus can tell, there's a
much more prevalent rate of disorder eat
ing."
Lauren Peate W has been volunteering
with the Center for Relationship Abuse for
several years. She said that she Ux>k the
pledge to keep standing up for the issues
she has been involved in. and to be more
