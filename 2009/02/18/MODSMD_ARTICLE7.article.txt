Making the most of your Stanford expe
rience is no easy task. Hie campus is
big. the pressure to perform well aca
demically can feel overwhelming and
there are so many events that it's near
ly impossible to take advantage of every opportunity
that presents itself.
Consider, for a moment, what it might be like to
navigate Stanford's campus if you can't use your legs
to push the pedals. Consider trying to find a classroom
if you can't see signs on the doors, or trying to attend
social gatherings if you can't hear the words your
peers are speaking.
Stanford is a university openly committed to
diversity. There are theme houses, student groups and
community centers dedicated to providing resources
to those interested in talking about issues of sex, reli
gion and race. Discussion of disability, however, is
rarely as open.
Regardless of discussion, the issue remains that
there are students and faculty on campus who work
and study, and also happen to have physical and/or
sensory disabilities. Consider this story a step toward a
more open dialogue about this oft-overlooked area of
diversity:

The Office of Accessible Education (OAE) is the
place from which disability-related resources are dis
tributed and accommodations are allotted. Services
offered by the OAE vary based on a student's partic
ular set of needs, and different services are provided
through different resource centers.
'Hie Student Disability Resource Center (SDRC).
for example, has the stated goal of "providing] stu
dents with equal access to all facets of university life:
education, housing, recreation and extracurricular
activities."
Through the SDRC, students can arrange for any
thing from exam accommodations to housing accom
modations, from note-taking service to oral or sign
language interpretation.The SDRC is also responsible
for the student-run DisGo golf cart service, which
gives free rides to students whose mobility is limited
because of permanent disability or temporary injury.
The Schwab Learning Center, the Assistive
Learning Technology Center, and the Center for
Universal Design in Education are other OAE-run
centers for students, offering accessible technology
and learning resources for those who need them.
How do these resources and services, then, help the
students and faculty who use them? What other
resources and services might be missing?

"Classes are relatively straightforward," said
Rachel Kolb' 12. "Social events are more difficult."
Kolb hails from New Mexico and is interested in
pursuing a major in English. She is also Deaf: she
wears a hearing aid in each ear, hut relies on lip read
ing and interpreters to understand spoken English.
Kolb uses sign language interpreters in all her classes
and to help her in her extracurricular activities — she
rides for the equestrian team.
"The [SJDRC is really great," she said, noting how
the center is responsible for arranging for the interpre
tation services she needs. "The challenge is when
something comes up last minute, and it's hard to get
interpreters. People don't always understand I need
advance notice."
Still. Kolb described her freshman experience so far
as fairly typical.
"I think sometimes my Deafness makes it harder,"
she admitted. Lip reading works fine in one-on-one
interactions, but the problem comes when more than
two people are talking.
"I can't follow what's going on." she added. This

can make attending parties and other extemporane
ous social events difficult.
And while she feels the Stanford community has
been very open to her. Kolb acknowledged that some
are less receptive.
"[Some] don't think beyond 'the normal,'" she said.
"They want me to do things their way. but this is the
way it is for me, and 1 need to do things my way."

Julia Feinberg '11, an ethics in society major, gets
around campus using a power wheelchair. She was
born with Type II Spinal Muscular Atrophy, a neuro
muscular disease that has affected her muscle devel
opment.
"Awareness about disability resources on campus is
extremely low," Feinberg said. "Whenever people say
'diversity,' [disability] is not really included."
In her senior year of high school. Feinberg complet
ed a massive research project focused on assessing the
accessibility of 15 universities and colleges in and
around Philadelphia. She based her evaluation on
everything from access to dormitories to the height at
which lab equipment was stored to the presence of
staircase alternatives, like ramps.
"Stanford is very good for a private school," she
said. "It's a big campus, so it's spread out... and it's a
flat campus."
Stanford's physical size, she explained, allows the
University space to build new, accessible buildings —
space that physically smaller colleges lack.
Feinberg mentioned a few areas in which
Stanford's accessibility could be improved for her and
others in similar situations.
"Automatic doors are put in on an as-needed
basis." she said. "Even when you do request it.it takes
at least four to six weeks."
And sometimes when automatic doors are added
to a building, the accessible entrance is in the back.
"People are always more than willing to open a
door." Feinberg said, "[but] I shouldn't have to go
around to the back entrance or be dependent on oth
ers to simply enter a building."
Other structural barriers, like a lack of ramps or
elevators, make things difficult for those in wheel
chairs. Some public spaces, like the upper level of
Memorial Auditorium, remain unreachable hy those
in wheelchairs. Even the residential buildings with ele
vators are not necessarily fully accessible, either. The
Branner elevator, for example, only moves between
two of the dorm's three floors.
"The problem is that there shouldn't solely be
access to academics, but also socializing and being a
part of your dorm community," Feinberg said. "This is
a clear example of where structural barriers can take a
huge toll in one's interactions with others if the dorm
residents are not conscious of this limitation and
[don't] make an additional effort to include the person
in dorm activities."
Overall, one of Feinbcrg's main concerns seems to
be awareness of issues surrounding disability on
Stanford's campus. She noted that there is a group for
students with disabilities on campus that is looking for
members. She also finds hope in the creation of a com
mittee to look into disability issues and resources on
campus.
"'lllere's starting to be growing awareness in the
[Stanford] administration." Feinberg said.

Lecturer Cathy Haas is one person who has played
an integral role in increasing administration awareness
about disability-related issues. Haas, who lost her hear
ing following a bout of scarlet fever when she was two,
has been teaching American Sign Language (ASL) at
Stanford for over 30 years. She also serves as the
Advisor for the Disability Staff Forum, which helps
facilitate communication between individuals at
