# A
						night at the CoHo

£ if ~"W" -wnello, hello, hello, hello. Test, test," a
I smooth voice reverberates over the
| 1 microphone. "Is that really loud? It's
I a little feedbacky."
Two musicians with dark, scruffy facial hair, button
down shirts and jeans fiddle with the sound system and
their instruments — a bass and a guitar.
Aside from the sound checks onstage, the humming
of coffee drinks being made, and the occasional
announcement of completed sandwich orders, the CoHo
is quiet on this Thursday night, circa eight in the evening.
A focused blond boy does work on his Macßook in
the corner. An older man sitting at the counter quietly
reads a novel. A couple sits close together, sharing a pas
try.
And then the overhead lighting is dimmed. Pleasant,
acoustic music fills the shop.
The CoHo emits a cozy aura with its mismatched
sofas and rustic tables. The walls are covered bv smatter

ings of whimsical artwork — close up paintings of faces
that resemble the cover of "Super Size Me," a still life of
a coffee mug and caricatures of famous Stanford-affili
ated people, from Reese Witherspoon to Robin Lopez.
A television in the background blares the
Northwestern-Illinois basketball game. On the other set,
Anderson Cooper is discussing the Rihanna and Chris
Brown saga.

The duo onstage finishes their first song, a number
about "being free, being everything." They chuckle

to each other and sip from their bottled water.
, Four of their friends have arrived — one girl
and three boys — and sit at a table directly in
I front of the stage.

"How's everybody doing tonight?"
asks the guitarist/lead singer, speaking in a
raspy voice. "Are we distracting you or is this
good for studying? That's what we're here for, to
ip that GPA."

No one responds. The two converse for a brief
moment, and then begin to play a cover of "Don't
Let Me Down" by the Beatles. ITie bassist scans
the crowd slowly while the guitarist closes his eyes,
feeling the music.
It appears that the concert is merely a backdrop to
the bustle of the CoHo workers and relative distracted
ness of the clientele. Twenty or so people are sprinkled
throughout the shop, and only a handful seems to be
paying attention to the live music.
An eclectic mix of people comes through the door.
Four students carrying red cups walk in a straight line
through the shop. Another group wearing neon Velcro
reflectors and flashing red bike lights enters. Graduate
students, perhaps?
The band onstage plays several original pieces, a few
Led Zeppelin covers, and closes with a rendition of the
Bee Gees' "To Love Somebody." They announce that
they are Tom and Rick, collectively known as the
Pernikoff Brothers, and begin to pack up their instru
ments.
The Northwestern Illinois game has long ended in a
narrow 60-59 victory for the Fighting I Mini. Conference
rivals St. Mary's and Gonzaga now occupy the ESPN
screen, and it is 36-36 at halftime. CNN breaking news
announces that a plane has crashed in Buffalo, New
York.
There is a nine o'clock rush at the CoHo, and a line
five or six deep has formed at the register. Hie front
tables have filled in anticipation for the next act.
A group of chipper students works on a problem set
while eating pizza. A man returns to another group with
what appears to be a deliciously rich slice of chocolate
cake. A girl sitting alone looks around anxiously, clearly
waiting for someone to arrive.
