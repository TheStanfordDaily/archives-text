## Senate stalls on election bills Election and fiscal policies occupy Senate for three-hour meeting 
### MARISA LANDICHO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
By the third hour of last night's Undergraduate
Senate meeting, the session sputtered to a halt as atten
dees contested the legislative legitimacy of two ASSU
election bills. Budget concerns and financing colored all
aspects of the meeting as the Senate struggled to further
specify funding priorities.
At the center of debate were two bills intended to
reform the election process. Senators Luukas lives '09
and Stuart Baimel '09 questioned the constitutionality
of the bills.
Revived from a meeting two weeks ago, the first bill
proposed making ASSU public funds available to stu
dents campaigning for office. The second bill, with con
siderable backing from the Graduate Student Council
(GSC), called for the institution of a cap on elections
spending.
Baimel. who serves as columns editor for The Daily,
felt that the Senate was given insufficient notice of the
spending cap bill, and said he was "blindsided" by the
proposal.
Citing the two-month time frame, lives, a Daily
columnist, argued that the bill was poorly conceived and
could not be instituted as written.
"[The bill] isn't something you introduce a month
and a half before the elections," he said, " lliis is reckless,
this is irresponsible, and it's cavalier with how we con
duct the democratic process."
Chemical engineering graduate student and GSC
member Ryan Peacock was frustrated with what he
viewed as stalling over technicalities.
"Your job is to legislate," he said. "If we are not going
to bother to vote on bills for all these different reasons,
it's ridiculous."
Because the spending cap bill is to be voted on by the
GSC tonight. Peacock was against drawing out debate
over the bill for another few weeks.
After half an hour, both sides agreed to hold a meet
ing before the GSC meeting to amend the bill's lan

guage, as suggested by ASSU Vice President Fagan
Harris '09.
In the midst of election reform, election season for
mally began on Monday night and 31 people have
already registered their candidacies for Undergraduate
Senate on the election petitions website, according to
Elections Commissioner Briana Taturn '11.
With the much-reduced budget nearing finalization.
the rest of the night focused on budget advocacy. The
night opened with a combined plea from community
center supporters.
Members of student groups in support of the Asian
American Activities Center, the Black Community
Services Center, El Centro Chicano, the LGBT
Community Resources Center, the Native American
Cultural Center and the Women's Community Center
gave a presentation highlighting the purpose and bene
fits of the centers.
Besides cultural programming and academic
resources, the group emphasized the role of community
centers in promoting mental health.Their argument was
backed bv the Mental Health and Well-Being Task
Force Report released in October 2008, which included
recommendations for providing "sufficient resources" to
ethnic and community centers.
Notably, community centers have already been
included in the ASSU's broader budget advocacy slate
since the end of January.
ASSU President Jonny Dorsey '09 emailed a petition
to the student body on Jan. 28 publicizing the four pillars
to be lobbied: community centers, academics, mental
health and frontline staff. The executives presented
these areas to the administration, which has taken the
advice into consideration.
Even with this assurance, the community center sup
porters felt a presentation to the Senate was necessary
to cement student support.
"Having institutional memory of how budget cuts
work, we just wanted to make sure to advocate this time
so that we don't get left behind." said Ashley Anderson
'09, co-president of the Black Student Union (BSU).
Referencing cuts from previous economic downturns
in the '70s and early '90s. Anderson and Melissa Morales
'09 stated fears of additional cuts above and bevond the
likely 15 percent cut across the
University.
Ilie Senate was appreciative of
their input, but pressed the presen
ters to provide more examples of
specific programs to be saved or cut.
In the past three weeks, the
Senate has been attempting to nar
row the original four goals into a list
of valuable programs for recom

mendation to the administration.
The GSC has already compiled its
own list, including programs that
could tolerate larger budget cuts.
From various town halls, a "stu
dent expert consultation" meeting
and input from constituents, the
body considered whether they were
in the position to draft a final letter.
"We have consulted as many peo
ple as possible, but I think that we
have reached the point that we are
in a position to make recommenda
tions of our own," said Senate
Deputy Chair Patrick Cordova '09.
Senator Stephanie Chan '11 said

their recommendations should he
ready by Friday's town hall.
As a last attempt to solicit feed
back. the Senate, in conjunction
with the Executives, will release an
electronic survey to the student
body. Senators argued over whether
to include in the survey an opportu
nity to note areas with the potential
for cutting — with opponents citing
the potential for inappropriate
attacks on certain departments and
programs — but with Director of
the Office of Student Activities
Nanci Howe warning the Senate
that time is running out. the body

agreed to solicit all input possible
and funnel as appropriate to the
administration.
Near the close of the meeting, the
Senate unanimously approved
Financial Manager Matt
McLaughlin '08 for another term,
along with two nominees for the
Constitutional Council.
After approving various special
fees funding bills, the Senate meet
ing adjourned, bringing the three
hour meeting to a close.
