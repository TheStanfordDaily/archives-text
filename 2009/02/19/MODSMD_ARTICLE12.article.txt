## Students push for change in contraceptives' price 
### JENNY REMPEL STAFF WRITER 
With the economy in dire straits and the
University facing tough decisions regarding
budget cuts, students who have been strug
gling with the high cost of contraceptives,
which nearly doubled this year for students
buying birth control through Vaden Health
Center, are running out of options.
The federal Deficit Reduction Act of
2005 resulted in the closure of a legislative
loophole that had allowed pharmaceutical
companies to cut deals with low-income clin
ics and college universities to provide cheap
er birth control to students. Last year, a
monthly contraceptive pack cost $10, said
Vaden's Director of Medical Services Dr.
Robyn Tepper in an email to The Daily. This

year, the price has risen.
"We recently ran out of all of the pills we
had purchased at the lower prices," Tepper
said. "Pill prices are variable. Most generics
are $19 dollars a pack, hut brands may cost
from $25 to over $100 dollars."
While Tepper does not expect the recent
wave of budget cuts to affect contraceptive
prices, she is concerned about the price
increase and students' ability to purchase
birth control given the current economic cli
mate.
"Contraceptive management is the third
most common diagnosis for patients we see
at Vaden." she said. "So for those of us pro
viding healthcare services at the Vaden
Health Center, affordable birth control is of
major importance."
Students shared Tepper's opinion. Kate

Benham '09 served as co-president of
Stanford Students for Choice last year.
When it became clear that the prices would
rise Inst spring, Benham conducted an infor
mal survey to see how students would
adjust.
"We found that the majority of them
would continue being sexually active but
didn't know what they were going to use as
contraception," Benham said. "Something
like 13 percent said they wouldn't use any
method. It was very drastic and we felt it
very imperative that the University address
es this impending health crisis, but they basi
cally said we don't have the funds to allocate
for this. So that was pretty much that."
Although the ASSU Senate passed a res
olution calling for the University to subsi
dize contraceptives for students, the situa

lion did not change. As a result. Meryl Holt
'09, co-president of Stanford Students for
Choice with Benham,canie up with the idea
of creating an endowment for reproductive
health.
She began working to find donors before
the financial crisis hit, but since then has
decided to postpone her efforts.
"We're trying to get the issue back into
the news and back into people's minds, espe
cially because now more than ever it's
important for women to have easy access to
affordable birth control." said I lolt. who also
serves on The Daily's editorial board. "But
it's difficult to raise the issue — sort of the
money issue — when the University is really
reeling from the effects of budget cuts."
Benham was more outspoken in
her analysis.
"I think that it's hugely impor
tant and I think that the University
frankly just doesn't care very much
[about reproductive health]," she
said. "It's not a priority for them."
Current Students for Choice
President Emily Gasner '09 is con
tinuing to work for more afford
able contraceptives. She. too. has
been frustrated by the University's
reluctance to help, though.
"I really do think it's a burden
that goes untalked about a lot. just
because it's birth control and med
icine and reproductive health."
Gasner said. "I think the common
conception that it is a women's bur
den is a huge mistake, and while
that is not only on this campus, but
everywhere, it does make any sort
of sexual interaction or sexual rela

tionship completely unbalanced."
"I would expect Stanford of all
places to step up and acknowledge
the inequity and try to do some
thing to correct it," she added.
