## Editorial V-Day celebrations bring to light high cost of birth control 
### 
V-Day is taking Stanford by storm with
Eve Ensler — V-Day founder and di
rector of the award-winning "Vagina
Monologues," coming to campus this Friday
to speak about women's sexual health
and Valentine's Day romance still in the air.
Yet the absence of dialogue on campus
about the rising cost of birth control is
alarming.
As this month's back-to-back, sold-out
performances of the "Vagina Monologues"
confirm, women on this campus are more
vocal and empowered to demand sexual
equality than ever before. In addition to the
success of the show, student groups came out
in force to rally for safe sex on Sexual I lealth
Day last Thursday in White Plaza, distribut
ing contraception information.
Amid the commotion V-Day stirs.and the
"Monologues'" cry for women to take con
trol of their bodies, the editorial board won
ders: Why has the dialogue about rising costs
of birth control been lost in the shuffle?
In the past year, prices for birth control
for students without Cardinal Care have
more than doubled. At the same time. Vaden
Health Center's supply of affordable pill
packs is dwindling.The rise reflects a nation
al trend in costs for basic protective care for
female college students throughout the
country.
We know the economy is suffering and
that budgets across the board are stretched,
but high oral contraceptive costs for female
students should not he among the burdens
forced on students, especially given the fact
that over 39 percent of college women re
port using oral contraception according to a
2006 survey by the American College I lealth
Association. No event underlined the chal
lenges of teen pregnancy in the media more
than the teenage pregnancy of Bristol Plain,
daughter of Republican vice presidential
:andidate (iov. Sarah Palin (R Alaska). In

these uncertain economic times, with gradu
ating seniors wondering how they will afford
their own healthcare, unplanned children
are the last thing female students can afford.
Recently, Stanford has been on the cut
ting edge when it comes to safe sex. Last
year, Trojan Condoms awarded Stanford a
No. 1 ranking in its third annual sexual
health report card, citing broad contracep
tion availability as one of the reasons Stan
ford rose from its 2007 ranking of #41. At the
time the ranking was published. Vaden of
fered birth control at a significantly dis
counted rate to all Stanford students, regard
less of their insurance status. Even without
Cardinal Care, women could purchase dis
counted birth control from Vaden's pharma
cy for as little as $10. Currently, costs are es
timated at $19 for the cheapest birth control
for students without Cardinal Care.
The increase in cost is not the result of
Vaden policy, but rather a mandate forced by
the U.S. Congress. When the 2005 Deficit Re
duction Act was signed into law, it ended a
practice by which drug manufacturers pro
vided prescription contraceptives to univer
sity health centers at discounted rates. As a
result of this new law. it is more difficult for
Vaden to sell contraceptives at the previous
discounted rate.
The current administration in Washing
ton has taken a friendlier stance on birth
control than the Hush administration, so
there is hope that if protests are loud
enough, subsidized birth control for all
women may come back to campuses. Stan
lord should do its part. No matter where in
dividuals stand on this issue, there needs to
be a more public debate regarding the on
campus price of contraceptives. We encour
age the administration,students and campus
healthcare officials to sit down and have a
public dialogue regarding the rising price of
contraceptives.
