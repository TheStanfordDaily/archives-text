# Steal This Column
## A 						triumph of reason, for now 
### 
A young man from Beirut, Lebanon sat
directly in front of me.To his left sat an
other student from Tehran, I ran.Then,
.o his right, a surprising sight: a former Israeli
soldier and the former soldier's friend, also
from Israel. Not what you might call the typi
cal Sundav-night dinner crew.
They, and 15 others, had all come to this
room to finally talk.
Hie evening of Feb. <S brought vision into
reality, a reality 1 had long been hoping to see
at Stanford. Twenty or so Stanford students
who care deeply about the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict - be they from Israel, the Palestinian
territories, other countries in the Middle East
or elsewhere (the latter group including yours
truly, hailing from 10 minutes north of Stan
ford) â€” gathered at Tresidder Union to
launch a Middle East dialogue group.
Each member, including the presidents of
the Stanford Israel Alliance. Coalition for Jus
tice in the Middle East (CJME) and Students
Confronting Apartheid by Israel (SCAI), all
of whom were present as individual members,
not as representatives of their respective
groups, had a different perspective, and to
gether represented a vast spectrum of views
on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
Hie night was simply intended to allow us
to meet each other before the groups real
work began, but the launch event symbolized
an unmistakable turnaround in sentiment on
this campus. While listening to the Lebanese
student speak of growing up in Beirut, the
Iranian student describe politics back home
and the Israeli soldier describe his experience
adjusting to the I nited States. I could not help
hut be overjoyed. In each person, a common
humanity shone.
()nly a month before, some of these same
people now engaged in conversation had
stood on opposite sides of a hike lane, shouting
slogans. During the weeks that followed there
cent Gaza conflict, the campus had seemed
primed for division on this issue once again.
But reason made a comeback. It achieved
its first major victory due to the work put into
creating an environment where all parties
could come together, by people who care
about achieving progress on campus and
peace in the Middle East. particularly Shira
Beery,vice president of C oalition for Justice in
the Middle I last, head of the dialogue group
and organi/er of its opening dinner. It was
clear that Middle East activists were prepared
to stop yelling and were ready to talk and lis
ten. And for that, all students who clamored
for a change of tone, all act i\ists who respond
ed to that call and all student leaders who put
down their signs and came to the table are to
be commended.
In a recent interview. Beery outlined her vi
sion for what the group has potential to
achieve.defining its goals as much In what this
group is not as by what it is.

'it's important not to think of the group as
a means by which people with different politi
cal opinions can convince each other 01 their
opinions or come up with a common political
vision." she said. "The point is to understand
the need to respect that there will inevitably
be differences of opinion, but that we do have
common interests which include advocating
for peace in the Middle East."
Even with all the optimism,there is. in many
circles, an understandable wariness that this
group may be used as a platform upon which to
once again raise divisive issues to prominence,
in the process not only hurting the dialogue but
hampering the process that dialogue seeks to
create. The campus rift that resulted from
SCAI's 2(H)7 campaign to divest from Israel is
still fresh in the minds of many, and there is al
ways a fear that extreme ideologues on either
side of the Israeli-Palestinian issue will see dia
logue as a threat to their political aims rather
than a necessary step toward reason. Indeed,
nothing would be more harmful to dialogue on
campus than using that very dialogue as a sup
posed mandate for such one-sided proposi
tions. Hut even by the end of that first meeting,
there seemed a clear positive energy and a re
newed belief that the members truly believe in
the stated purpose of the group.
To say that all beliefs, all views of the crisis
in the Middle East, were represented clearly
would he to overlook those extreme opinions
to which dialogue carries little weight, and
thus those carrying them chose not to become
members of the dialogue group. On the sur
face. it seems easy enough to disregard those
fringe elements. But they are the ones against
whom those who value dialogue must under
stand they need to be most vigilant, for it is in
deed much easier for polari/ing figures and
ideas to gain exposure than it is for reasonable,
nuanced discussion to gain traction.
The triumph of dialogue is new. and it is
real. But it is also tenuous. Dialogue is the
means, not the ends, and it is up to each of us to
maintain and protect it from those who seek to
divide, so that we may make real progress to
ward a new luimani/ation of those with whom
we may disagree. But for now. it is indeed a tri
umph.
