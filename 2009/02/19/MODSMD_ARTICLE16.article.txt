						Revolution sind Where?: Practical Revolution 101 
### 
Sometimes my parents worry about me.
They think that at times I can be a bit.
shall we say. "dismissive of authority."
Yet I think what sometimes manifests itself
as rule breaking is really just a curiosity
about where authority is. and why the rules
are what they are. While this curiosity can be
the impetus for me to do very stupid things.it
is also the seeds of my political conscious
ness.
It all started last year, when I somehow
deluded myself into thinking is was a good
idea to break a lot of art department rules in
the name of a horribly misguided â€¢'perform
ance art" piece (let's just say the event was
entitled "pARTy"). Needless to say, my
"project" landed me in a lot of hot water (I'm
thankfully still enrolled here). Yet despite the
ill-conceived nature of the piece itself. I think
my intentions were pure. I had long ad
mired the transgressive work of many avant
garde and contemporary artists. I was in awe
of the ingenious ways they conceived of to
use tools like humor, surprise and yes,shock,
to get people to think differently about their
world. My own project was conceptually
sloppy. It lacked the singularity and direct
ness of the artworks 1 so admired that made
them so effective. As opposed to my own. un
focused project, these artworks tended to
choose a particular strain of the status quo to
subvert.
Yet the whole experience did lead me to
recognize that many of us have the seeds of
youthful rebellion in us that make us want to
question authority, and that these impulses
can either be destructive or constructive. I
think what determines whether our rebel
liousness leads to reckless, or noble endeav
ors, lies in how much effort we put towards
informing ourselves about the world. Since
my brush with the Stanford Man. I have been
thinking incessantly about revolution,
whether it's necessary.and if it is. what such a
revolution would look like.
I know it would be compelled by some de-

sire for change, a feeling that somehow the
status quo needed to be altered. What better
place to start prodding the status quo than
our immediate surroundings, the University?
Personally. I know that before my aforemen
tioned brush with the Stanford Man. 1 never
really considered the magnitude of the Stan
ford bureaucracy. Being forced to confront
the existence of a little thing called the Judi
cial Affairs Committee led me to realize just
how many departments and offices operate
on this campus. Do you know that Stanford
employs almost 14.000 people? 1 began to
understand there was a lot about the I 'niver
sity I had been taking for granted. I was too
busy scurrying from classes to parties, trying
to maintain my grades and a social life, to re
ally question the nature of the place that was
structuring those experiences.
In his column in The New York limes last
week, philosopher Stanley Fish mentioned
University of Ottawa professor Denis Ran

court, a physics professor who got fired from
the university after awarding all his students
A-pluses when the university wouldn't allow
him an exclusively pass/fail grading system.
When I read about Rancourt. I was instantly
reminded of the antics of one of my heroes,
the German conceptual artist Joseph Beuys.
Beuys was famously escorted from the Uni
versity of Dusseldorf by campus police when
he continued to teach after his dismissal. He
was fired after he invited students who had
been rejected by the academy to join his class.
I'm not saying that you should make the
obedience-instilling carrot-and-stick nature
of the grading system or the exclusivity and
social unfairness of university admissions
policies your battle. I'm also not saying there
aren't causes outside of academia that are
worth your time (we can probably all con
ceive of greater injustices than a University
of Ottawa student getting a B). But when was
the last time you stopped to think that Stan
ford could function without a grading system,
or that top-tier universities could let in more
than one out of every 10 students, and that
these differences might even lead to a more
interesting, more free and better educational
environment.
I think it's a beautiful moment, the nais
sance of true politics, when a person realizes
that something they've always taken for
granted as normative can actually be other
wise. It is this moment that enables us to dis
cover w hat needs to be altered in society.
We should take advantage of being in a
university setting.a place that puts a primacy
on intellectual freedom and a person's right
to question. Maybe revolution necessary,
and maybe it isn't. I tend to think it is. but you
should look around and decide for yourself.
Just don't tell the art department I sent you.
