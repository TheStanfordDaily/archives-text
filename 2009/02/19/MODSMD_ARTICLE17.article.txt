come in the relays. Chad La Tourette
owns the fastest time in the nation in
the 1.650 this year with a 14:40.65.
Stanford defeated Cal last year 132.5
to 110.5 and also swam to verv fast

times earlier this season in a triple dis
tance meet, although the event was
not scored. Cal's relay teams, espe
cially in the 2(X) freestyle and medley
relays, are incredibly strong this year
and have the potential to win titles at
the NCAA Championships.The Car
dinal's biggest challenge this Satur
day will be to take down the Bears'
fast relays. Stanford's relay strength
lies in the medley relays, especially
the 4(X)-yard distance.
"This weekend is a stepping stone
to our next big meets and is a really
good warm-up to Pac-lOs and
NCAAs." Kornfeld said. "We expect
ourguystogoreal fast, and we expect
the same from the Cal guvs."
