# A-ROD'S NEW GAME
## 
### BY ANTHONY NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While Alex Rodriguez
rocked the sports world
last week, a different A-
Rod showed up in the Bay
Area. It was Andy Roddick, who head
lined an impressive draw at the 2(X)9
SAP Open that included Juan Martin
Del Potro, James Blake. Mardy Fish and
Stanford alums Bob and Mike Bryan.
After turning pro in 2(XH). Roddick
was crowned the next best hope in
American tennis following the Sam
pras-Agassi era. With a booming serve
and penetrating forehand. Roddick cap
tured the 2(X)3 U.S. Open title and a
World No. 1 ranking.
Then came Federer. And soon after.
Nadal.
While Roddick's story may be all too
familiar for the American tennis fan. he
still remained a model of consistency
over the last eight years. However, in
2(X)N. Roddick's early round exits at the
Australian Open and Wimbledon were
causes of great concern for his fans
was this it for America's poster child?
In an attempt to revitalize his game.
Roddick hired Larry Stefanksi, former
coach of Fernando Gonzalez, Tim I fen
man and former World Nos. I Marcelo
Rios. Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Stanford
alum John McEnroe.
"The thing that made Larry really ap
pealing was looking at the people he's
worked with before me ... lots of differ
ent styles, lefties, righties, a lot of strong
personalities." Roddick said after his
quarterfinal win against Tommy I laas."'l
liked that he was American, that he was
willing to come to Austin. Everything
about him just kind of fit."
"We've always gotten along pretty
well — he was pretty much the only guy
I was looking at." Roddick added.
And so began a training and diet reg
imen that saw Roddick lose 15 pounds
before the 2(X)M Australian Open. With
the added fitness level. Roddick reached
the semifinals of the Open, including an
upset of reigning champion Novak
Djokovic.
Carrying a solid 9 2 record on the
season. Roddick returned to San Jose to
show off his new game as the defending
SAP ()pen champion. Thisyear marked
his sixth straight appearance and eighth
overall at the second oldest men's tour
nament in the States — including titles
in 2004,2005 and 2(X)8.
Alter two easy opening round
matches, a revitalized Roddick dis
patched Haas in the quarterfinals to
break a three-match losing streak
against the tough German.
"Everv service game in the second

set. I was in on his serve," Roddick said.
"I was putting a lot of returns on the
court giving myself a chance. Everything
just felt a little cleaner."
When asked about his success in San
Jose. Roddick was frank about his con
nection with the Bay Area, which has
come to know him over the last eight
years.
"I just feel comfortable on this court."
Roddick said like a player returning to
his hometown. "You've played enough
matches out there — I've got to be close
to over 30 matches on that court. I here's
a little bit of a relationship with the fans
here — seen me since I was 1 <X years old
here. I've kind of grown up in here in
front of them, or working on it anyway."
"It's just nice to come back to a place
where you've had good memories." he
added.
Though Roddick would falter in the
semifinals against 2()()<S runner-up
Radek Stepanek.all signs seem to indi
cate that Roddick is ready for another
Grand Slam run in the near future.
"I was in good shape back then just be
cause I had played so many matches that
summer." Roddick said of his 2003 run
in Flushing Meadows."! think probably
similar right now. as far as getting weight
down and whatnot. I think it's a lot dif
ferent that it was last year or the year be -
fore. I feel pretty good — it's definitely
way better than at anytime in "07 or "08."
While Roddick's fitness may have
changed, his sense of humor certainly
hasn't.
In the post-game on-court interview.
Roddick polled the audience about
what he should do for Valentine's Day
for his new fiancee, who openly told him
not to do anything at all. To Roddick's
joking dismay, the crowd overwhelms
voted for him to get her a gift.
Later. Roddick was asked if he Ik J
any plans with Larry Stefanski.
"What, like dinner plans?" I?
quipped.
All joking aside. Roddick's respond
almost seemed like a message to In
doubters.
"We have a tentative schedule n
place," Roddick said. "We made a lot a
strides with the work in Austin we put it
before the Australian ()pen,and Ill like
tokeepthat up ifthere's an off-week and
bang out five or six really hard days."
Iliough Roddick didn't come away
with the 2009 title, he gave the Bay Area
a glimpse of what's to come in the next
few months.
