# Stanford's got girl power

Last fall, the Stanford football
team had their best season
sinee any of us have been on
the Farm,going 5-7 and hav
ing several opportunities to earn a
bowl bid. The women's volleyball
team had a very ordinary year by
their standards, posting a 31 -4 record
and reaching the NCAA title game
for the third straight year.
So far this winter, the men's bas
ketball team is 15-8 and has exceed
many people's expectations in the
season following the departure of
the Lopez twins and former head
coach Trent Johnson. The women's
basketball team has failed to take a
step forward from last season, fol
lowing up last year's run to the title
game with only a No. 4 national
ranking and 20-4 record so far in this
campaign.
I guess the girls just can't keep up
with the boys.
Seriously, though, when it comes
to the more visible team sports at
Stanford, the women are just un
stoppable. They can never "wow" us
because they consistently set our ex
pectations so high.
It isn't a competition,but the men
in the spotlight need to step up. For
tunately for the guys, spring is just
around the corner â€” and with it
comes the boys' best chance to shine.
Yes. the Softball team is all but
guaranteed to have an excellent sea
son. but that doesn't mean the guys
can't pick up some points on the
baseball diamond.
Last vear. the baseball team was
