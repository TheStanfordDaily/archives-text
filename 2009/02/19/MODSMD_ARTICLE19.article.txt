# Stanford's got girl power
## 
### 
Last fall, the Stanford football
team had their best season
sinee any of us have been on
the Farm,going 5-7 and hav
ing several opportunities to earn a
bowl bid. The women's volleyball
team had a very ordinary year by
their standards, posting a 31 -4 record
and reaching the NCAA title game
for the third straight year.
So far this winter, the men's bas
ketball team is 15-8 and has exceed
many people's expectations in the
season following the departure of
the Lopez twins and former head
coach Trent Johnson. The women's
basketball team has failed to take a
step forward from last season, fol
lowing up last year's run to the title
game with only a No. 4 national
ranking and 20-4 record so far in this
campaign.
I guess the girls just can't keep up
with the boys.
Seriously, though, when it comes
to the more visible team sports at
Stanford, the women are just un
stoppable. They can never "wow" us
because they consistently set our ex
pectations so high.
It isn't a competition,but the men
in the spotlight need to step up. For
tunately for the guys, spring is just
around the corner — and with it
comes the boys' best chance to shine.
Yes. the Softball team is all but
guaranteed to have an excellent sea
son. but that doesn't mean the guys
can't pick up some points on the
baseball diamond.
Last vear. the baseball team was

The Inside Pitch
coming off of a disappointing 2007
season and just looking to find a way
back to the postseason. Instead, they
shocked most observers and won
their way to the College World Se
ries. This preseason, the experts
have the Stanford men ranked in the
top-20 across the board and as high
as fifth in some polls.
Predictions before any games are
played don't mean much of any
thing, as the Detroit Tigers and
Tampa Bay Rays both learned last
season. But if players stay healthy
for the Card, this team has all the
pieces to make another run.
Junior Jeffrey Inman is returning
to be the Friday starter, and was
named to the Golden Spikes Award
Watch List — the winner of which is
named the top player in college
baseball — earlier this week. He
was 7-2 for the Cardinal last year
and averaged more than a strikeout
per inning last summer in the Cape
Cod League.
Leading the offense is senior first
baseman/catcher Brent Milleville,
who is the active Stanford career
leader in doubles, homers and RBI.
The big man was even 7-for-i0 in
steals last year and was red hot
down the stretch. Milleville should
prove to be one of the biggest of
fense threats in the conference.
These are just the top returnees

on offense and the mound. Sur
rounding them is a complete and
deep cast of players that puts the
Stanford baseball team in position
to have another excellent year.
Junior Toby Gerhart is on track
for his first injury-free baseball sea
son and can absolutely destroy the
ball when he is healthy. Joey August
enters his senior year as the team's
active leader in career batting aver
age and hits. And fellow senior Max
Fearnow should battle for a spot in
the rotation or provide reliable long
relief from the bullpen.
More than a handful of freshmen
from last season — Drew Storen,
Danny Sandbrink. Zach Jones and
Jake Schlander. to name a few —
developed into very valuable play
ers and should only get better with
experience. If the new freshman
class can deliver even close to as
many impact players, this team will
be very dangerous.
A return to Omaha is certainly a
lot to ask for. and it would be hard to
write off an entire season as a failure
just because the team didn't make
the final eight. But that doesn't
mean we can't expect a lot from this
2009 baseball team.
Besides, the pressure is on these
guys to perform. Otherwise, who is
going to show the Stanford women
that the men can be dominant for an
entire season too?
