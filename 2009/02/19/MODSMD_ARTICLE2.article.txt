# CHANCE FOR VEN GEANCE
## Men look to rebound after loss 
### DENIS GRIFFIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
It looks increasingly unlikely that
the Stanford men's basketball squad
will find a way to sneak into the NCAA
Tournament. Now. it is becoming clear
that any remaining hope likely rests on
a Pacific-10 Conference Tournament
win and the automatic bid that goes
with it.
But that wasn't always the case in a
season that initially looked so promis
ing for the Stanford men (15-8.4-8 Pac
-10). Flash back to just a few short
weeks ago, to Jan. 24. when the Cardi
nal lost to Oregon State to fall to 13-4
overall and 3-4 in conference play.
Without the presence of senior point
guard Mitch Johnson, the Beavers
trounced Stanford 72-60, riding a ca
reer night from Calvin Hayes (25
points) and Seth Tarver (19 points).
After the game, the Cardinal's atti
tude was one of frustration, as it had
been upset by a team it was expected
by many to beat handily, especially at
home.

2/19 Corvallis, Ore. 7:00 PM,
NOTES: On Jan. 24, Oregon State came into
Maples Pavilion and soundly defeated Stanford
to the tune of 77-62. Tonight, the Cardinal will
try to return the favor when it travels to Corval
lis, Ore. to take on the Beavers. In the first
meeting, senior Lawrence Hill was held to just
eight points and four rebounds. The Cardinal
will need a greater contribution from its senior
forward to beat the Beavers and take an impor
tant step towards a shot at the Pac-10 title.

TTiev played with much more ener
gy and more confidence than we did."
said senior Anthony Goods after the
loss."They came out and threw the first
punch and played tough for 40 min
utes."
"They out-fought us." added coach
Johnny Dawkins. "They out-executed
us and they won. I thought from start to
finish they played a very good ball
game."
Despite professing a determination
to bounce back following the loss, what
followed was nothing short of disas
trous for the Cardinal's postseason
chances. Stanford lost its third game by
just one point to USC before being
blown out by UCLA. Losses at home
against Washington and at Cal —the
latter after being up by 22 points with
4:33 remaining in the first half — fur
ther chipped away at Stanford's record
and hopes. Now, just a shred of opti
mism remains.
"You've got to look at it like a bless
ing if you're playing anywhere [in the
postseason]." Goods told The San Jose
Mercury News of the likelihood that
the Cardinal could likely be headed for
a lesser postseason tournament this
year. "A lot of guys go home at the end
of the season ... If we're selected to
play in any tournament, we definitely
need to look at it as a positive. But right
here and now. I think it's best for us to
aim high."
"The only way we can go about that
is by looking at the next game as a
must-win every time." senior Kenny
Brown told The Mercury News. "What
better time to prepare for [the Pac-10
Tournament) than now.right before it."
With just those small hopes remain
ing, the Cardinal will face the team that
helped kick-start its string of misfor
tune back in January, as it travels to
Corvallis, Ore. to take on the Beavers
(11-13.5-8). OSU has had to deal with
difficulties of its own recently, and is
coming off a three-same losing streak.

The Beavers fell by three points at home against
Arizona, lost a low-scoring. 49-38 contest against
ASIJ and were blown out on the road at Washing
ton before narrowly defeating Washington State.
54-52 on Saturday.
Moreover, with just six conference games re
maining. Stanford could be staring at its first losing
Pac-I() season since 1992-93. The Cardinal men
would need to win live of six to keep that streak
alive, starting tonight.
Oregon State has been aggressive defensively,
notching 163 steals on the year a 6.8 steals per
game clip in its first year under head coach ( raig
Robinson, brolher-in-law of President Marack
Obama. Unfortunately for the Heavers, the team

has also committed 17 more turnovers than its op
position this season, with a rate of 13.5 turnovers
per game.
Oregon State is led offensively by sophomore
guard ( alvin I laynes. who is scoring 15.2 points per
game and is the only Heaver averaging double dig
its. It will be interesting to see if Mitch Johnson's
presence on defense can slow OSU's perimeter at
tack. When the teams met in January. Oregon State
was a deadly 5-10 from beyond the arc.
I'ip-off m Corvallis is scheduled for 7 p.m.
