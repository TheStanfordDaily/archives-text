Athletic department to sell
Sixth Man seats
The athletic department will sell
seats in the student section to Buck
Cardinal Club members, amongst oth
ers. for Stanford's upcoming home
games against No. 20 UCLA and I ISC
on Feb. 26 and 28. respectively.
According to an email from Stan
ford Athletics to season-ticket holders
on Wednesday, the seats for sale are
"adjacent to the student section" in sec
tion 13. which is normally a part of the
Sixth Man section. Sixth Man Director
Alexis Link said that this section ac

counts for over 200 students.
"The Sixth Man ( lub has been an in
tegral part of our team's success for
years, and the players thrive on the en
thusiasm and support of their peers."
said Link. "Selling seats in the Sixth
Man Club sets a bad precedent for the
future that will allow the Director's ()f
fice to progressively remove more and
more of the student section."
While student attendance has been
down this year. Link expected next
week's games against the Los Angeles
schools to bring in a slew of fans.
"Ihis would have been a more
appropriate move for less-antici
pated opponents," Link said.
"These games are expected to be
the most highly attended by stu

dents of the season, so it seems irre
sponsible to sell seats that likely
won't he available."
The Sixth Man has issued a poll
to its members to generate a con
sensus on the decision — it hopes
that the results may be able to make
the athletic department reverse its
action.

Former Cardinal coach Harris to
tutor Akron quarterbacks

Former Stanford head football
coach Walt Harris has been hired
by Akron as the Zips' new quarter
backs coach and passing game co
ordinator. The new position comes
after Harris spent the past two
years away from the game follow
ing his firing by Stanford.
Harris had previously coached
at Pittsburgh from 1997-2004,
amassing an overall record of 52-
44. After the '04 season. Harris was
hired to replace Stanford's Buddy
Teevens. 1 le was somewhat success
ful in 2005. leading the Cardinal to
a 5-6 record that included a near
upset of Notre Dame in the final
game at the old Stanford Stadium,
an improvement over the previous
season's 4-7 finish.
A shocking loss to UC-Davis,
however, in the team's home open
er would prove to be a troubling
sign for the future.The Aggies — in
the third year of a four-year transi
tion from Division II to Division l-
AA — defeated the Cardinal 20-17
in one of the most embarrassing
losses in program history.
What followed was one of the
worst seasons ever for Stanford. In
its first season in the new Stanford
Stadium, the Cardinal floundered
to a 1-11 record, with the team's
lone win coming on the road at
Washington. To make matters
worse, the team was routinely
blown out by double-digit margins.
The Cardinal was outscored 377-
127 — an average of nearly 21
points per game. Following a sea
son-ending 26-17 loss in Berkeley,
Harris was fired and eventually re
placed by current Stanford head
coach Jim Harbaugh.
With the Zips. Harris will inherit
an effective passing game that aver
aged 231.5 yards per game and
scored 20 touchdowns last season.
Akron quarterbacks did throw 14
interceptions on the season, howev
er. a trend Harris will be expected
to reverse.
Women's lacrosse wins tune-up
over Albany
Stanford women's lacrosse is
perfect in 2009. The Cardinal de
feated the University of Albany 15-
10 yesterday at Laird Q. Cagan Sta
dium to push its record to 3-0 on the
season. Albany suffered its first loss
of the year and is now 1 -1.
The Great Danes jumped out to
a 2-1 lead in the first 12 minutes.
Stanford is setting a trend of falling
behind early in contests, having
given up first-half leads in two of its
first three games. But Albany
couldn't hold the lead for long: The
Cardinal rattled off six unanswered
goals to close out the first half. The
visitors stayed competitive in the
second half but couldn't close the
gap-
Stanford out-shot Albany by a 2-
1 margin and committed just 10
turnovers to the Great Danes' 16.
Sophomore Sarah Flynn. and jun
iors Dana Lindsay and Lauren
Schmidt each contributed three
goals. Junior Amanda Schwab
scored twice coming off the bench.
The game was supposed to be
played on Tuesday, but rain-soaked

conditions pushed the contest to
yesterday — leaving the Cardinal
with just one day off before taking
on No. 3 Syracuse tomorrow. The
Orangewomen are the highest
ranked team the Cardinal will face
during the regular season. Stanford
head coach Amy Bokker doesn't
think the quick turnaround will be a
problem.
"We need to allow ourselves to
find our rhythm," Bokker told
GoStanford.com. "It's almost bet
ter to back up the games a little
closer together."
Game time is set for 3 p.m. at
Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
Stanford Hurler on Golden Spikes
Watch List
Junior pitcher Jeffery Inman was
named to the 2009 Golden Spikes
Watch List, USA Baseball an
nounced on Tuesday. Fifty of col
lege baseball's top players were
named to the list, which is spon
sored by Major League Baseball.
The winner will be announced on
July 15 as part of the MLB's All-
Star Weekend.
Inman, a right-handed starter,
progressed nicely from the 2007 to
2008 seasons. He improved across
the board as a sophomore, lower
ing his ERA from 5.74 to 4.27, al
lowing 13 fewer hits, 14 fewer runs
and cut his walk total by five. His
strikeouts fell, but he finished with
an outstanding 7-2 record on the
season.
The junior got better as the sea
son progressed — during a seven
game streak in March and April, he
allowed just six runs in 36.1 innings.
In the College World Series, Inman
held the eventual-champion Geor
gia Bulldogs to just two runs in 5.1
innings, striking out five. He fol
lowed up a strong sophomore sea
son with a stellar showing in the
Cape Cod league this summer.
Pitching for the Yarmouth-Dennis
Red Sox, the Stanford righty caught
the attention of Baseball America
and the magazine ranked Inman as
the No. 9 prospect in the 2008 Cape
Cod League, and named him a
third-team preseason Ail-Ameri
can.
Stanford kicks off the 2009 sea
son when it hosts Vanderbilt at
Sunken Diamond, Friday at 5:30
p.m. and Saturday at 1 p.m. UC-
Riverside comes to the Farm for a
double-header on Sunday.

sign for the future.The Aggies — in
the third year of a four-year transi
tion from Division II to Division l-
AA — defeated the Cardinal 20-17
in one of the most embarrassing
losses in program history.
What followed was one of the
worst seasons ever for Stanford. In
its first season in the new Stanford
Stadium, the Cardinal floundered
to a 1-11 record, with the team's
lone win coming on the road at
Washington. To make matters
worse, the team was routinely
blown out by double-digit margins.
The Cardinal was outscored 377-
127 — an average of nearly 21
points per game. Following a sea
son-ending 26-17 loss in Berkeley,
Harris was fired and eventually re
placed by current Stanford head
coach Jim Harbaugh.
With the Zips. Harris will inherit
an effective passing game that aver
aged 231.5 yards per game and
scored 20 touchdowns last season.
Akron quarterbacks did throw 14
interceptions on the season, howev
er. a trend Harris will be expected
to reverse.
Women's lacrosse wins tune-up
over Albany
Stanford women's lacrosse is
perfect in 2009. The Cardinal de
feated the University of Albany 15-
10 yesterday at Laird Q. Cagan Sta
dium to push its record to 3-0 on the
season. Albany suffered its first loss
of the year and is now 1 -1.
The Great Danes jumped out to
a 2-1 lead in the first 12 minutes.
Stanford is setting a trend of falling
behind early in contests, having
given up first-half leads in two of its
first three games. But Albany
couldn't hold the lead for long: The
Cardinal rattled off six unanswered
goals to close out the first half. The
visitors stayed competitive in the
second half but couldn't close the
gap-
Stanford out-shot Albany by a 2-
1 margin and committed just 10
turnovers to the Great Danes' 16.
Sophomore Sarah Flynn. and jun
iors Dana Lindsay and Lauren
Schmidt each contributed three
goals. Junior Amanda Schwab
scored twice coming off the bench.
The game was supposed to be
played on Tuesday, but rain-soaked

conditions pushed the contest to
yesterday — leaving the Cardinal
with just one day off before taking
on No. 3 Syracuse tomorrow. The
Orangewomen are the highest
ranked team the Cardinal will face
during the regular season. Stanford
head coach Amy Bokker doesn't
think the quick turnaround will be a
problem.
"We need to allow ourselves to
find our rhythm," Bokker told
GoStanford.com. "It's almost bet
ter to back up the games a little
closer together."
Game time is set for 3 p.m. at
Laird Q. Cagan Stadium.
Stanford Hurler on Golden Spikes
Watch List
Junior pitcher Jeffery Inman was
named to the 2009 Golden Spikes
Watch List, USA Baseball an
nounced on Tuesday. Fifty of col
lege baseball's top players were
named to the list, which is spon
sored by Major League Baseball.
The winner will be announced on
July 15 as part of the MLB's All-
Star Weekend.

2008 seasons. He improved across
the board as a sophomore, lower
ing his ERA from 5.74 to 4.27, al
lowing 13 fewer hits, 14 fewer runs
and cut his walk total by five. His
strikeouts fell, but he finished with
an outstanding 7-2 record on the
season.

son progressed — during a seven
game streak in March and April, he
allowed just six runs in 36.1 innings.
In the College World Series, Inman
held the eventual-champion Geor
gia Bulldogs to just two runs in 5.1
innings, striking out five. He fol

son with a stellar showing in the
Cape Cod league this summer.
Pitching for the Yarmouth-Dennis
Red Sox, the Stanford righty caught
the attention of Baseball America
and the magazine ranked Inman as
the No. 9 prospect in the 2008 Cape
Cod League, and named him a
third-team preseason Ail-Ameri
can.

Sunken Diamond, Friday at 5:30
p.m. and Saturday at 1 p.m. UC-

Athletic department to sell
Sixth Man seats
The athletic department will sell
seats in the student section to Buck
Cardinal Club members, amongst oth
ers. for Stanford's upcoming home
games against No. 20 UCLA and I ISC
on Feb. 26 and 28. respectively.
According to an email from Stan
ford Athletics to season-ticket holders
on Wednesday, the seats for sale are
"adjacent to the student section" in sec
tion 13. which is normally a part of the
Sixth Man section. Sixth Man Director
Alexis Link said that this section ac

counts for over 200 students.
"The Sixth Man ( lub has been an in
tegral part of our team's success for
years, and the players thrive on the en
thusiasm and support of their peers."
said Link. "Selling seats in the Sixth
Man Club sets a bad precedent for the
future that will allow the Director's ()f
fice to progressively remove more and
more of the student section."
While student attendance has been
down this year. Link expected next
week's games against the Los Angeles
schools to bring in a slew of fans.
"Ihis would have been a more
appropriate move for less-antici
pated opponents," Link said.
"These games are expected to be
the most highly attended by stu

dents of the season, so it seems irre
sponsible to sell seats that likely
won't he available."
The Sixth Man has issued a poll
to its members to generate a con
sensus on the decision — it hopes
that the results may be able to make
the athletic department reverse its
action.
