For Stanford football fans looking to get more in
volved. this could he the news you've been waiting for:
The Cardinal has scheduled an open try-out for March 6
in an attempt to find a new kickoff specialist.
It's no secret that the Cardinal struggled on kickoffs
last season, tallying just two touchbacks compared to
eight by opponents. The Nov. 15 home game against USC
was particularly rough for the Stanford special teams, as
the Trojans notched four touchbacks and racked up 230
yards and a touchdown on four returns.
So after failing to recruit a player out of high school to
fill the kickoff role, head coach Jim Harbaugh decided it

was time to turn to the
student body in hopes
of adding another gen
uine asset to a program
on the rise.
"We're trying to
find the best person on
campus that can kick
off," Harbaugh said.
"There's a real need
there for our football
team, and it's a spot
that would help Stan
ford football. We need
to make sure we've un
covered every av
enue."
Defensive ends and
special teams coach D.
J. Durkin described the
kind of player the

coaches are hoping to
find as an undergraduate student looking to make an im
pact on Stanford football.
"The reason we're doing this, and what we're looking
for. is a guy with leg strength." he said."Someone who has
a background in kicking — football would be great, but
even in soccer — [but] leg strength is the No. 1 thing. We
feel like, [if] we get a guy with leg strength, then we can
coach the technique of it.get him polished up and cleaned
up on it."
Durkin added that while the team was looking for im
mediate help on kickoffs. an expanded role could be pos
sible for any kicker who made the team.
"Really.the main intent of it is I'd like to find a guy who
can help us with kickoffs. first and foremost." he said.
"Progressing into the placekicker [role], someone who
can kick field goals, that's something that takes a lot
more practice and technique and things we'll have to
work on down the road."
According to I larbaugh. he and his staff were ini
tially inspired to turn to an open (rvout when reading
about Texas Tech's Matt Williams.The kicker initially
caught the eye of Red Raiders coach Mike Leach
when he drilled a 30-yard field goal during a promo
tion at a Tech home game. If it could work in Lubbock
— or a few years previously at Boston College
why not at Stanford?
As Durkin explained, new college rules have
placed even more of an emphasis on the role of the
kick-off specialist.
"They moved the ball (at kickoffs] back to the 30-
yard line last year, and football is a game of field po
sition — what's your net punt, what you are gaining
on kickoffs." Durkin s;iid. "1 thought we did a very
good job of covering kicks last year with the excep
tion of the IJSC game, which is probably fresh in
everyone's mind.
"But you start breaking it down, we had two
touchbacks the entire season." he continued. "You
kick the ball off 50.60 times the entire year: if you're
only getting two of those as touchbacks. it's obvious
you're increasing the number of times [your oppo
nents! return the ball. And the more opportunities
they get. the better chance they have to break one on
you."
According to I larbaugh. another factor that made
the open tryout option attractive was the predicted
expansion of the team's roster to roughly 105 players.
The tryout could also pay dividends in raising in
terest in the team as it heads into spring practices.The
C ardinal fell just one win short of bowl eligibility in
2008 and could be primed for a breakout season in
2009 with plenty of key starters returning on both
sides of the ball and a few strong recruiting classes

under the program's belt.
While Harbaugh and Durkin both acknowledged
that building enthusiasm among the student body
could be a nice, added benefit of the search for a new
kicker, the tryout is far more than a public relations
move as the Cardinal seeks to fill a legitimate spot on
its roster.
"I don't think it's totally a shot in the dark,"
Durkin said. "It's something that definitely could
work out."
"I think there will be other benefits and we'll win
on some other levels, but that's not the main purpose
of it." Harbaugh later added. "Probably the biggest
benefit is we'll meet some more Stanford students. It
should he a fun event, and we don't see it as a high
pressure kind of thing. It's always nice to see some of
the other students that are really interested in foot
ball and see if they've got a talent that could help out
the team."
Harbaugh even left the door open for a female
student winning the spot, noting that the decision will
be made entirely on the merits of a prospective stu
dent-athlete's ability.
"Whoever can kick the ball the farthest, male or
female." he said.
The tryout is currently scheduled for 5 p.m. on Fri
day. March ft. According to Durkin. the coaches view
it as a no-lose situation: either the team will find the
leg it's looking for. or it will be no worse off than it al
ready was. And either way, all involved should be en
riched by the opportunity.
"Anytime you're involving the students in what
we're doing, to me. you're gaining from it." Durkin
said. "They're our best fans: they support us the best.
So we want to give back a little and give them an op
portunity to be a part of it."

was time to turn to the
student body in hopes
of adding another gen
uine asset to a program
on the rise.
"We're trying to
find the best person on
campus that can kick
off," Harbaugh said.
"There's a real need
there for our football
team, and it's a spot
that would help Stan
ford football. We need
to make sure we've un
covered every av
enue."
Defensive ends and
special teams coach D.
J. Durkin described the
kind of player the

coaches are hoping to
find as an undergraduate student looking to make an im
pact on Stanford football.
"The reason we're doing this, and what we're looking
for. is a guy with leg strength." he said."Someone who has
a background in kicking — football would be great, but
even in soccer — [but] leg strength is the No. 1 thing. We
feel like, [if] we get a guy with leg strength, then we can
coach the technique of it.get him polished up and cleaned
up on it."
Durkin added that while the team was looking for im
mediate help on kickoffs. an expanded role could be pos
sible for any kicker who made the team.
"Really.the main intent of it is I'd like to find a guy who
can help us with kickoffs. first and foremost." he said.
"Progressing into the placekicker [role], someone who
can kick field goals, that's something that takes a lot
more practice and technique and things we'll have to
work on down the road."
According to I larbaugh. he and his staff were ini
tially inspired to turn to an open (rvout when reading
about Texas Tech's Matt Williams.The kicker initially
caught the eye of Red Raiders coach Mike Leach
when he drilled a 30-yard field goal during a promo
tion at a Tech home game. If it could work in Lubbock
— or a few years previously at Boston College
why not at Stanford?
As Durkin explained, new college rules have
placed even more of an emphasis on the role of the
kick-off specialist.
"They moved the ball (at kickoffs] back to the 30-
yard line last year, and football is a game of field po
sition — what's your net punt, what you are gaining
on kickoffs." Durkin s;iid. "1 thought we did a very
good job of covering kicks last year with the excep
tion of the IJSC game, which is probably fresh in
everyone's mind.
"But you start breaking it down, we had two
touchbacks the entire season." he continued. "You
kick the ball off 50.60 times the entire year: if you're
only getting two of those as touchbacks. it's obvious
you're increasing the number of times [your oppo
nents! return the ball. And the more opportunities
they get. the better chance they have to break one on
you."
According to I larbaugh. another factor that made
the open tryout option attractive was the predicted
expansion of the team's roster to roughly 105 players.
The tryout could also pay dividends in raising in
terest in the team as it heads into spring practices.The
C ardinal fell just one win short of bowl eligibility in
2008 and could be primed for a breakout season in
2009 with plenty of key starters returning on both
sides of the ball and a few strong recruiting classes

under the program's belt.
While Harbaugh and Durkin both acknowledged
that building enthusiasm among the student body
could be a nice, added benefit of the search for a new
kicker, the tryout is far more than a public relations
move as the Cardinal seeks to fill a legitimate spot on
its roster.
"I don't think it's totally a shot in the dark,"
Durkin said. "It's something that definitely could
work out."
"I think there will be other benefits and we'll win
on some other levels, but that's not the main purpose
of it." Harbaugh later added. "Probably the biggest
benefit is we'll meet some more Stanford students. It
should he a fun event, and we don't see it as a high
pressure kind of thing. It's always nice to see some of
the other students that are really interested in foot
ball and see if they've got a talent that could help out
the team."
Harbaugh even left the door open for a female
student winning the spot, noting that the decision will
be made entirely on the merits of a prospective stu
dent-athlete's ability.
"Whoever can kick the ball the farthest, male or
female." he said.
The tryout is currently scheduled for 5 p.m. on Fri
day. March ft. According to Durkin. the coaches view
it as a no-lose situation: either the team will find the
leg it's looking for. or it will be no worse off than it al
ready was. And either way, all involved should be en
riched by the opportunity.
"Anytime you're involving the students in what
we're doing, to me. you're gaining from it." Durkin
said. "They're our best fans: they support us the best.
So we want to give back a little and give them an op
portunity to be a part of it."
