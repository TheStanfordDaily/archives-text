## Experts talk human rights Conference on China starts today 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
A group of academic experts and
political bigwigs will be participating
on campus today and tomorrow in a
student-organized conference on
the role of China in humanitarian
crises. The two-day event, hosted by
Students Taking Action Now:
Darfur (STAND), will mix partici
pants from the government, civil
society, private sector and academia
in an effort to move forward on the
issue of China and human rights.
Ambassador Richard
Williamson, former Special Envoy
to Sudan, is one of the featured par
ticipants in the conference.
The concept of structured discus
sion is a common theme throughout
the conference and in the mindsets
of many who hope to resolve the
crises in Sudan and surrounding
areas. Williamson, who is the
keynote speaker, adopts that notion
as part of the main points he would
like to convey to the attendees of
the conference.
"If we have structure relation
ships across the board, maybe we
can have more constructive discus
sions," Williamson said in an inter
view with The Daily."The U.S. has to
engage with China; it's important to
have a constructive relationship."
Given that, Williamson showed a
slightly skeptical view to China's
response to any proposed formal
cooperation.
"I'm told by my predecessor that
with respect to passing the resolu
tion for UN Peacekeepers, China
was helpful, and I'm willing to
accept that as true," he said. "I just
can't think of a thing during my 10
years as special envoy that I can
point to. disappointingly. My experi
ence has not witnessed much coop
eration from them."
Emma Cobert 'II and April
Kapur '10. Co-chairs of China in the
21st Century — a student group

organized last spring specifically to
execute the China Conference —
began sketching out plans for this
event in fall 2007 hut only assem
bled a full team,complete with a fac
ulty advisory board, last spring. The
idea was brought forth by co-term
candidate Seth Silverman'o9 and
further expanded on by Kapur, who
believed that China was an obstacle
to resolving the humanitarian crises
in countries such as Chad.
Myanmar. Sudan and Zimbabwe.
"We've been working on this
Sudan subject for a very long time
and the U.S. can only put so much
pressure." Kapur said. "If China is
still providing Sudan with arms and
buying oil from them, our sanctions
and our efforts don't really help."
The China Conference — the
first of its kind at Stanford — was
originally planned for last spring;
however, the magnitude of the con
ference and the difficulty of inviting
speakers pushed back the date to
almost six months later. It was
Silverman's connections with impor
tant political players in this issue —
built after a quarter with the
Stanford in Washington program —
and the help of various other
Stanford student organizations, such
as Six Degrees and Stanford in
Government, that allowed S TAND
to finalize and put on the event.
Featuring a diverse panel of pro
fessors from prestigious institutions
across the country, as well as other
important political figures, the
China Conference begins today and
will continue through tomorrow
afternoon. While the event is open
to all Stanford students, 150 of which
have already registered and con
firmed attendance, other invitations
were first extended to specific
departments with graduate students
that STAND believed are really pas
sionate about the issue.
