## Levite urges nuclear responsibility 
### CALLA SHENG CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last night, Israeli nuclear security expert Ariel
Levite spoke at Arillaga Alumni Center about the
promises and challenges of nuclear power. Levite was
the keynote speaker for Stanford's 2CX)9 Drell Lecture,
a Stanford Center for International Security and
Cooperation (CISAC) sponsored event.
"I think we're beginning to see unfold in front of
our eyes a race to acquire new nuclear public
resources." said Levite. who serves as a senior associ
ate at the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace, and is a member of the Israeli Inter-Ministerial
Steering Committee on Arms Control and Regional
Security. "It's a race in the sense of the pace that is
quickening, in terms of the scope that is global, and in
terms of the dynamics, where we may be seeing one
country going in a direction as far as the others, to do
very much, very much the same."
According to Levite. most countries face the chal
lenge of replacing retiring reactors with new facilities.
Equally urgent is the need to educate a new genera

tion of competent operators to man these new facili
ties. Despite those hardships, nuclear energy is becom
ing all the more attractive. Not only is ii undisturbed
by weather conditions, unlike solar or wind energy, ii
also eliminates the problem of greenhouse gas emis
sion.
"But. the story is a hell lot more complicated,"
Levite said. "For all its appeal, nuclear power does
have limitations, does have stringent requirements,
does raise some risks. We should be painfully aware of
many of those cases."
liie suppliers that constitute the nuclear food chain
are few and far between. The inexperience of people in
the industry and behind the construction of reactors is
a severe problem. Levite cited the example of France's
first new-generation reactor constructed in Finland.
"What it turns out is that after a couple of years of
construction, they are already more than three years
behind schedule, and more than two billion euros over
budget,"he said. "One can actually see what inexperi
ence actually amounts to."
