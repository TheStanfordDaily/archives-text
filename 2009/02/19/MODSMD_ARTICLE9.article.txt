## GSC passes spending bill Campaign spending capped at $1,500 
### DANIEL BUI STAFF WRITER 
Last night, the Graduate Student
Council (GSC) passed a bill for
campaign spending caps after thor
ough discussion with the ASSU
Executives and representatives from
the Undergraduate Senate.
The Fiscally Responsible
Campaign Spending Bill would pro
pose a cap of $ 1.5(H) dollars spent on
any individual campaign. The legis
lation is meant to encourage candi
dates to allocate their spending
much more carefully. However,
when the idea for a limitation on
spending was introduced at Tuesday
night's Undergraduate Senate meet
ing. a small number of ASSU sena
tors voiced their concerns about the
bill's enforcement.
"I think the overriding concern
was how you can enforce this in a
way that it does not promote sub
versive behavior." explained ASSU
Vice President Fagan Harris '09. "If
you try to cap this and don't have
any enforcement measures, you will
see some campaigns go under
ground."
Possibilities for enforcement
were discussed, such as disqualifying
candidates who spend their
resources in an irresponsible man
ner. GSC members also considered
the more amiable solution of revok
ing Fair Campaign status, which is
noted on the election ballot.
The ASSU Executives also
voiced the concerns of undergrad
uate senators in placing the burden
of enforcement upon the Elections
Commission, which has been run
ning campaigns for the ASSU and
the GSC

"There are undergraduates that
are concerned that if you bequeath
that sort of power to that body, they
may become partisan," Harris said.
"Many of the senators did not feel
comfortable with investing that kind
of power into that authority."
"I think we all deeply care much
about this issue, but we want to see
it done right," said Shelley Gao '11,
chair of the Undergraduate Senate.
Gao also noted her concerns about
making such a "dramatic change in
policy" so close to the onset of elec
tion season.
Despite these issues, members of
the GSC seemed to think that the
passage of the bill was in the best
interests of the candidates.
Ryan Peacock, a third-year grad
uate student in chemical engineer
ing and author of the bill, expressed
worry over the need for "a bigger
discussion about enforcement."
Echoing his comments at Tuesday

night's Undergraduate Senate meet
ing, Peacock said that legislation
needed to be passed immediately in
order for the council to evaluate the
cap's effect on the election and pave
the way for more stringent regula
tions in future years.
"This enforcement thing is really
a smaller deal than people have
been making it out to be," added
Nanna Notthoff, a first-year gradu
ate student in psychology.
The spending bill was passed by
the GSC with 10 votes for, one vote
against and one abstention.
GSC members also discussed
preliminary measures for a bill that
would subsidize funds for candi
dates who need assistance in paying
for their campaigns. Some members
worried about the necessity of such
legislation after passing the spend
ing bill, but GSC co-Chair Polina
Segalova disagreed.
"I don't think that passing the

caps bill should be a reason to disre
gard the financing bill" she said.
"1 think we have to tackle this
topic from as many angles as we can
because this problem is multifac
eted," Harris added. "The bill would
allow candidates to run for student
government without having to
worry about socioeconomic status."
The GSC also discussed the
Wellness Room, which opens Feb.
25. ASSU President Jonny Dorsey
'09 described the resource as a "cen
trally located room in Old Union to
help students become mentally and
physically well" with a number of
programs and opportunities
throughout the year for student
groups to use.
"It's a great portal to become
plugged into existing resources on
campus," Harris added.
