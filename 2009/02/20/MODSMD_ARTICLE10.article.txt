# The 						Waste Land: Give all attention to the man behind the curtain
## 
### 
Some vaguely batty literary critics of the early 20th
century maintained that the integral 'meaning' of a
poem was contained only in its sounds, rhythms
and intonations. So if you read a book of the Aeneid in
the original Latin to an English-speaking child, the kid
would 'get it' through sound alone. While these devotees
of Sound Theory were obviously off the deep end, per
haps they did have a point about the evocative power of
sound.
If not for the, power of sound, for instance, why
would readers keep coming back to T.S. Eliot's "The
Waste Land" (1922)? It's hard to imagine a more
inscrutable poem, and yet people love it. You'd have to
have a double Ph.D. in English and Classics to really tan
gle with Eliot's prize-winningly obscure references, but
that doesn't stop laypeople from gushing about the
poem's ineffable beauty.
So perhaps sound, if not clarity, is key, both in "The
Waste Land" and in director Michael Sack's multimedia
production "The Waste Land: or pay no attention to the
man behind the curtain," which runs this Thursday
through Sunday at 8 p.m. in Roble Studio Theater. While
it's packed with vague gestures toward The Symbolic, the
show's real power comes from its intense sound-palate
and its other successful efforts at mining the potency of

sensory experience. Strategic uses of dance, film, light,
shadows and stage-shaking beats comprise this produc
tion's high points.
This 75-minute multimedia piece is the third install
ment in the Drama Department's five-part series of dra
matic works inspired by "The Waste Land." The last two
productions in the series seem to have riffed mostly on
the content of Eliot's classical references, from which
Sack's piece also draws. But the show nods, too, to other
elements in Eliot's five-part poem, including a card-play
ing episode and the female typist (give Eliot a quick read
before you see this show so you'll be able to nod knowing
ly). Present are what seem like representations, through
sound, dance and light, of Eliot's manic poetic voice.
According to the program, the show "investigates the
theater as a place of both revelation and concealment,"
and the production styles itself is more of a thoughtful
response to Eliot's poem than a faithful evocation of it.
New materials are woven in, including fascinatingly doc
tored, disorienting footage from"The Wizard of Oz,"
dubbed in French. And the recurring homage to Oz actu
ally does make sense — as it turns out, the film was ded
icated to Ezra Pound, the Modernist poet who was Eliot's
editor (and a full-time anti-Semite). And the 'man behind
the curtain' theme works elegantly, too, reiterating the

fear (present both in "Oz" and Eliot) that whatever seems
sacred may well be illusory.
Needless to say, this show isn't centered around dia
logue or a narrative arc, so it's not the sort of thing for
theater-goers of the Andrew Lloyd Webber persuasion, or
for anyone desiring a relaxing evening. But art isn't always
meant to be relaxing. At its most intense, Sack's produc
tion is a literally painful attack on the senses — even I, of
youthful constitution, was at one point writhing in my
seat, my eyes and ears assaulted by pulsing images of Judy
Garland, strobe lights and a hellish sound-palate wrought
to fever-pitch. But this well-rendered intensity is emo
tionally stimulating and certainly reflective of Eliot's own
pained confusion.
The production's vivid sensory world benefits from
Michael Ramsaur's impeccable lighting and Erik Flatmo's
striking set, which makes clever use of several layers of
white scrim, creating a hazy, shadowy stage-world. And

Michael St. Clair's sound design opens up a magnificent
world of its own, though some soft jazz toward the end
seemed ill-placed. But the choreography, by Robert
Moses, is perhaps the show's strongest point; in constant
motion, the dancers collide and separate, alternating
between languid beauty and manic bursts of energy.
When the full ensemble of dancers appears together, the
Eliot-esque feeling of a tragic inability to communicate
is palpable,
This production merits attention and respect as it
manages to hit home without trying too hard. Eliot's
greatness derives, perhaps, from a constant confluence
of confusion, meaning and beauty — even if you can't
see, at first or even fifth glance, what Eliot "means," there
is still an undeniable aesthetic power that provides con
stant stimulation. In its best moments, Sack's produc
tion achieves that Eliot-esque synthesis.
But in its not-best moments, the show suffers from
an addiction to symbolism that is neither pleasant nor
scrutable. After one scans the program, complete with a
three-page-long director's note, it's clear that a lot of
meaning is behind the production. Whether intention
ally or not, the show seems to take retro cues from
French New Wave cinema and Swedish filmmaker

Ingmar Bergman — a hooded figure appears in Sack's
production who looks and poses like Death from
Bergman's "The Seventh Seal." And I can't imagine any
one more meaning-fraught than Bergman.
While I do like Bergman, 1 sympathize with the
popular complaint: I don't get him. As the British come
dy duo French and Saunders once said of Bergman, "We
can pretend to understand it, then read a book about it
later." That's how I felt during the symbolic moments of
"The Waste Land" — 1 was always supposed to be dig
ging for the deeper meaning, though 1 had few clpes
about how to do so. What was 1 to make, for instance, of
a trio in mouse masks who entered a woman's room,
cleaned it, watched the woman write with lipstick on a
mirror and then disappeared under a black curtain
while what looked like a life-size model of the
Hindenburg inflated on stage left? How should one
respond to being bludgeoned over the head with
inscrutable profundity?
I was clearly frustrated by these moments that
seemed to bully me into symbolic submission, but 1 still
very much admire the aforementioned high points in
which gently-suggested symbolism is accompanied and
enhanced by sensory stimulus. These moments, in

which the audience is encouraged to grapple with and
enjoy beauty, are commendable. I can't say that this
show delivers any coherent "message" or that I "got" the
intention behind the piece, but to each her own — at
any rate, this production is certainly something to talk
about.
