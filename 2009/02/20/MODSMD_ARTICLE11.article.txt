# New York Fashion Week
## 
### 
RECESSION CHIC
It's no secret that luxury fashion gets hit hard by recessions. A typical fash
ion show in a Bryant Park tent costs between $300,000 and $600,000.
Accordingly, many high profile designers — including Vera Wang, Monique
Lhuillier and rising superstars Viktor & Rolf— have chosen to host small
presentations in showrooms for buyers and editors rather than set up an
entire show.
Hard times are also evident in the trends we are seeing on the runway
this week. Most of the collections have gone the safer route. With a few glar
ing exceptions, designers used limited color palettes with lots of black, gray
and beige. Makeup was on the light side, often just a brush of copper on the
lids. Trends have not changed much from last seasons collections —shoul-
ders are emphasized, cutouts arc everywhere and boots are thigh-high.
Model castings have also leaned toward the conservative—girls are classical
ly pretty rather than eccentric or alien-esque.
Most glaringly, many designers known for their gowns stuck to mini dress
es, an odd choice considering the Academy Awards are on Sunday and star
lets are looking for something attention-grabbing and glamorous. Rodarte,
known for their finale of three successive gowns, only showed mini dresses.
Max Azria didn't design a single long dress for Herve Leger, Diane von
Furstenberg showed only one and Matthew Williamson, red carpet extraor
dinaire, cut down to three. Are floor-sweeping gowns too expensive to make?
Or arc they inappropriately extravagant in our economic climate?
Regardless, I'm still loving the shorter lengths.

MODEL PROFILES
Catwalk Queen
Casting directors played it safe this week —and
Sigrid Agren was the star. Her large brown eyes, blond
hair and simple features fit into every show. This season,
casting directors shied away from models with uniquely
flawed looks that once stunned crowds and helped
-them stand out. Instead, they tended towards more tra
ditional-looking models with even features and light
tans, like Sigrid, Anna Jagodzinska, Anna Selezneva, and
"Jac" (Monika Jagaciak). They have also been paying
attention to ethnic models such as Scssilee Lopez,
Lakshmi Menon, and lourdan Dunn, who had the
honor of both opening and closing Oscar de la Renta's
show. Gone — or at least diminishing — are the days of
pale, ethereal models with baby doll faces.
So far, Sigrid has opened Marc by Marc lacobs,
Ruffian and Diane von Furstenberg, and closed BCBG
Max Azria, Donna Karan and Carolina Herrcra. She
both opened and closed for Max Azria, and walked a
number of other runways as well.

New York Fashion Week, the first of the four major fashion weeks, did not begin
with its usual roar. The preeminent buzz leading up to February, when rail col
lections for 2009 are shown, was shadowed by talk of the recession and news or
the many designers who chose cheaper options than to show at the tents in Bryant
Park. Nonetheless, fashion editors and celebrities alike gathered Feb. 12 to start on
the new season. Shows this week were characterized by toned down silhouettes, neu
tral colors (excluding Marc Jacobs, of course), safer trends than usual and a greater
appreciation for ethnic models.

BARBIE TURNS 50
To cclebrate Barbie's 50th anniversary, Mattel threw
her a runway show featuring outfits from fifty differ
ent designers. The show was divided into four seg
ments: a video tribute and three runway shows, one
futuristic, one modern and one classic. The looks
were hardly ground-breaking, but altogether they
were a respectful homage to an American icon.
Rachel Roy added sequins to Barbie's original black
and white bathing suit, Diane von Furstenberg
offered up one of her signature wrap dresses, and the
gowns from Marchesa and Monique Lhullier, fit tor
princesses, were crowd favorites. Other designers
included Alexander Wang, Michael Kors, Nicole
Miller and Calvin Klein.

AFRICAN FASHION COLLECTIVE
In an effort to dispel stereotypes about African fashion, ThisDay
and Arise magazines sponsored the African Fashion Collective,
which was comprised of Xuly Bet (by Mali's Lamine Badian
Kouyate), Tiffany Amber (by Nigeria's Folake Coker), Momo (by
Nigeria's Fati Asibelua) and Stoned Cherrie (by South Africa's
Nkhensani Nkosi). Model superstars like Alex Wek, Liya Kebede,
Tyson Beckford, Lara Stone and even Grace Jones walked at the
show. This collective, combined with Vogue Italia's All Black Issue
last July, might help pave the way for a more diverse runway.



One of the major themes in this season's fashion show was
cutouts, as can be seen in this dress from Preens F/W 09-
10 line.
