HERVE LEGER BY MAX AZRIA
Three models fell during the Herve Leger show on Sunday, but with a col
lection this sexy and surprisingly editorial, who cares? Max Azria must
have heard people were getting tired of the übiquitous Herve Leger band
age dresses on every twenty-something year old celebrity; this time, he
experimented with innovative textures and tons of edgy bondage details
such as studs and chains. Everything was skintight, as usual. Some looks
featured sharp shoulders reminiscent of Balmain, a cult favorite French
bouse that seems to have been inspiring a lot of collections this week from
Thakoon to BCBG Max Azria. The finale was an amazing beaded black
dress that resembled a disco ball.

MARC JACOBS
One thing we've learned to expect
from Marc Jacobs is to never expect
anything. You think you know
what's coming, but you don't. Last
September, his theme was sophisti
cated vintage Americana. This sea
son, it's clubbing in 1980s New York.
Hair was styled into wild pom
padours, and clothes featured bright
colors and shoulder pads. Perhaps
he was inspired by his recent collab
oration (for Louis Vuitton) with
Stephen Sprouse, a designer known
for his neon colors, graffiti prints
and punk references. Some critics
thought the collection was too
much of a throwback and that Marc
didn't live up to his full creative
potential. Nonetheless, he certainly
stood out in a week of reserved, self
conscious collections.

RODARTE
Some people thought Rodarte's collection last September
was just a rehash of last February. The same could not be
said for this season, which is definitely fresh yet still dis
tinctly Rodarte. Each look was indescribably complex,
marbled with fabrics resembling washed stones, confined
by heavy knits and finished off with a pair of fantastic
thigh-high boots wrapped in leather. The boots were
courtesy of Nicholas Kirkwood, the footwear equivalent
of Alexander McQueen. The overall effect was unbeliev
ably futuristic yet somehow still organic. At Rodarte,
fashion is—above anything— art.

MODEL PROFILES
Rising Star
Brazilian-born newcomer Gracie Carvalho is blowing
us away with her angelic features. She has walked
BCBG Max Azria, Herve Leger, Diane von
Furstenberg, Lela Rose, Carolina Herrera, Jill Stuart,
Carlos Miele, Derek Lam, Tory Burch and 3.1 Phillip
Lim. Granted, her look is definitely quite commercial,
but with the economy, we need a face that sells, and
hers will.
