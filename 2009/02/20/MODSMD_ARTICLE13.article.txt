# Way to keep a resolution: cute workout clothes!
## 
### 
According to a list of top ten new year's
resolutions, staying fit and losing
weight are on most people's goals for
the coming year. 1 think we have all made this
resolution before — I had never seen so many
bikes parked outside of Arrillaga as I did in
the month of January. However, the number
of gym-goers has dwindled since; it's mid-
February and maybe some of us have lost
motivation.
Intermission has found a way to get you
back on the treadmill: cute workout clothes!
You may ask, "Does it really matter what you
wear to the gym? You're only there to work

out!" That may be true, but adequate workout
clothes add so much more to your experience
— you need them for comfort and motiva
tion. Looking cute is just another benefit. You
should pick workout clothes that flatter your
body type and fabrics that can handle sweat
and all sorts of exercise. Here are a few simple
tips to help you find flattering cuts for your
own body type and stay motivated to main
tain your new year's resolution!
Tips for Everyone
Keep it simple. A couple of bright, solid
colored tops with built-in sports bras and a

few pairs of black yoga pants or shorts are all
it takes.
I like workout clothes made out of Lycra
for its stretchy flexibility and its ability to hold
everything in with a snug and flattering fit.
Cotton is also good for breathability.
And looking good at the gym does not
mean you have to go broke! Check out lulule
mon athletica on University. They are always
having sales on cute and durable tops (trust
me, they last forever!) that usually run any
where from $19 to $28. Also, the friendly
experts there help you find fits that are perfect
for you. Additionally, Target has a line called
Champion that is good for reasonably priced
and comfortable workout pants and shorts.
Tops for Bigger Busts
If you have more to flaunt, it's important
that you can support your assets without
being uncomfortable when exercising. It
might be good to invest in high-support
sports bras such as Champion's 02Cool
Seamless Racerback Sports Bras ($36), which
has an inner bra that supports your every
move. If you are a busty person, it might be a
great fit for you. Also, you could purchase
some workout tops with built-in bras and
wear them over another sports bra for double
support. Try to avoid tops with deep v-cuts
that might be a bit too revealing for the gym
and, more importantly, have less support.
Tops for Smaller Busts
If you are like me and hate wearing sports

bras for making your small breasts even small
er, no worries! Look for sports bras and work
out tops with built-in cups (they exist!). For
example, lululemon offers removable cups for
all of their tops with built-in bras.
Bottoms for Shorter Legs
Tight cycling pants or shorts are best for
your dilemma. Instead of hiding your legs,
show them off! By showing more of your
stems, it has an effect of elongating them, so
no one will say you have short legs.
Bottoms for Bigger Lower Bodies
For those of you who have bigger lower
bodies with respect to your upper body, 1 rec
ommend tight black capri yoga pants, which
have a bit of a flare. The flare is important
because it prevents your thighs from appear
ing disproportionately big compared to your
calves. The flare oddly has the effect of making
your lower body appear slim and longer.
If you have been lagging on going to the gym,
take this article to heart and invest in a couple
of cute and proper workout clothes. Who
knows? It just may be the new motivation you
were looking for! We still have some time until
we can pull out those sundresses and shorts ..
. so get to work with these tips!
