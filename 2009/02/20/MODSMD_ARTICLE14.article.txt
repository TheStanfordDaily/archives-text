# Sizzling, sophisticated steaks at Ruth's Chris
## 
### 
As Parents' Weekend approaches, this may be the perfect
time to be thinking about what high-end meal you'll
accept from mom and dad in exchange for the honor
of your company. Since there's a limit to the excitement that
can come from dining in Palo Alto, going into San Francisco
might be an appealing option. And if you want to go all-out
for an epic meal—it's hard to top a good steak.
Despite being a large chain, Ruth's Chris Steakhouse
(don't you dare call it Ruth Chris's — the name took the
strange form when Ruth bought Chris Steakhouse) maintains
a strong reputation for excellent preparations of USDA prime
steaks. Located on Van Ness, the SaTi Francisco branch of the
restaurant is not where you'd expect to find a high-end restau
rant. To complement the low-end location, all the restaurant
staff members wear name tags which, if any tackier, would
resemble a name tag at a discount retailer. It reads: "Hi my
name is ... ask me how you can save 15 percent on your pur
chase today!"
Ruth's Chris unfortunately seemed to subscribe to the
Peter Lugcr school of honoring reservations by unapologeti
cally making patrons wait half an hour for a table — even if
said patrons are on time for their reservation. However, it was
also unusually busy during San Francisco's Dine About the
Town promotion, so this probably isn't typical. But once seat
ed at the roomy booth in the corner of an elegantly modern
dining room, the long wait (and cheap name tags) suddenly
don't seem to matter.
Our friendly server quickly came by to take drink orders
and explained how the evening's prix-fixe would work. We

soon received our wine, a California Syrah which, while excel
lent, was not cheap at $40 for a half bottle. The first food to
arrive was a loaf of bread and the steakhouse salads. Neither
was spectacular, but the bread was soft and warm, and the
salad was well-presented and was a sufficiently light prepara
tion for what was to come.
Ruth's Chris takes its steaks seriously; they prepare each in
an oven at 1800 degrees before serving it on a 500-degree plate.
As the steaks leave the kitchen, a dash of butter is added for a
visible and audible sizzle. The ribeye was fantastic, cooked to
the pink perfection of medium rare — the most any steak
should ever be cooked, in my expert opinion. Perhaps the only
reasonable complaint about the ribeye was that the fat was not
quite as well distributed as it could have been — which can be
good or bad depending on personal preference, but unmistak
ably made the steak somewhat reminiscent of a New York
strip. The filet was also outstanding. Granted, it wasn't as tasty
as the ribeye, but the filet had an unmatched blue cheese crust
and tenderness that could not be beat.

The steaks were accompanied by creamed spinach and a
hash brown. The spinach was deliciously rich — but not so
much that the spinach itself couldn't be tasted — which is
exactly how it should be. The enormous hash brown was hot

and crispy, but might have been slightly
on the salty side: it was difficult to stop
eating it. Desserts to top out the meal
were chocolate sin cake and bread pud
ding. Since brevity is the soul wit, it will
suffice to say that the sin cake lived up to
its name and the bread pudding was a hit
even among bread pudding's non-enthu
siasts.

Despite the initial bumpy reception, service was stellar
throughout the meal. Water glasses were kept full, everything
was delivered in a timely manner, and our waitress constantly
came by to check on us — though she was not intrusive and
never interrupted unless she picked up on a subtle cue that we
needed attention. Even after asking if our steaks were okay, she
followed up the question by asking if they were cooked exact
ly as we had ordered, clearly leaving the door open to send
them back if necessary. Our steaks, of course, were cooked per
fectly, but the fact that she asked was a good touch.

3, while Ruth's Chris isn't perfect in every
respect, the flaws are very minor in the
grand scheme of the restaurant, and
° the food and service allow me to
unquestionably recommend it as a
venue for $40-plus steaks.
