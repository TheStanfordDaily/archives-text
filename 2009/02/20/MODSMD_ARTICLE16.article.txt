# Finding your post-holiday hook-up
## 
### 
Roxy would like to say that her Valentine's Day was hotter than the
fourth floor of Mirrielees in mid-July. Roxy learned the hard way (pun
intended) to forget the fancy dinners — your Valentine's Day is best spent
by "springing" for a sturdy mattress.
Ms. Sass hopes that the"v" in your V-Day didn't just stand for
Valentine's, or at least that you got a presidential salute on President's Day.
Unfortunately, she also recognizes that there's a good chance the most
tossing and turning you got on Saturday involved playing Text Twist alone
on your computer.
Never fear, loyal reader. The holiday may be past, but that doesn't
mean you still can't find that special someone, or at least someone with a
pulse. Unless you have six inches of hair growing out of your ears, the rea
son you're sitting at home alone and watching "The Big Bang Theory"
probably has much less to do with your qualifications and much more to
do with not knowing how to make a move.
You interact with a lot of different people each day on campus, more
than you may realize. If you're unlucky in love, there's a good chance
you're not utilizing the wide variety of pick-up lines at your disposal. To
the postal workers: Can you lick my ... stamp? To the dining hall employ-

W.V [/VOVU, ~vs»<xv.a. ..vix w.j . . . JIUIIip. W.V >a.
ees: I'll serve you if you serve me. To the janitorial staff: Let's
close this restroom for a deep cleaning. To the Marguerite

driver: Can I ride in the back? If you start to consider the
hook-up possibilities you once overlooked, there's a

good chance you'll run into Roxy at the mattress store
any day now.

Let's start with the more obvious. You're proba
bly spending a lot of time looking for love at parties I
or among circles of friends. Why put forth all that 1

effort when what you're searching for is right in
your dorm? The roommate, of course, is a logical
option. Plus, there's always the opportunity to say,

"Oops, I thought this was my bed" or "Oh, I thought

that was my stapler" if something goes wrong when you
make a move.

If you're a little too prudish to try the roommate option, think

about the person across the hall instead. Wander in while wearing
your towel and claim you "got lost." Say you locked yourself out of

your room, but need to practice your lunges. At worst, you'll get to prac
tice your lunges. At best you'll, well, practice some lunges all right...
Of course, you may want to venture out of your dorm for love-play.
You may not think there's a good chance of finding romance in an aca
demic setting — bio problem sets probably don't get you hot. You need to
get creative if you want to hit on your TA. Don't know how to diagram a
compound? Draw a suggestive sketch instead. If you're a fuzzy, slip in a
suggestive line in your response paper: "The Franco-Prussian war was ...
I'm open to threesomes." This can give "hard grader" a whole new mean
ing.
Don't limit yourself, however, to the confines of your residence.
Taking a walk around campus, you're probably so focused on the people,
you already know that you're ignoring prime hook-up material: tourists.
When they try to take a picture of you in front of Hoover Tower, don't run
away — pose seductively. Offer to show them "the back entrance" to the
building. Tell them it's no where near the biggest structure on campus.
If your rendezvous at Hoover Tower falls flat (har har), don't let the
trip back to your dorm be another failure. If you're biking, there's a good
chance you'll pass one of the bike traffic cops. Instead of sneering with

r i
disdain as they remind you to follow the round-a-bout, show

your appreciation for their hard work. Tell them you like to

be directed. Ask them to check the air in your tires.

Suggest that stop signs are the only place you like to put

on the breaks.

Warning: all of these suggestions are risky to
some degree. But there are some hook-ups, however,

you should definitely avoid altogether. Roxy thought
lot of

long and hard (as always) and considered a lot of
inappropriate options: your RFs teenage children,

the homeless people in Palo Alto or worse, those peo-

had to rule off her list was the people who preach in

White Flaza. You probably shouldn't suggest, "Can I hold your

sign — that pole is so big" to someone trying to save you from
eternal damnation.
Otherwise, the field is wide open — and if you play it right, you
will be too.
