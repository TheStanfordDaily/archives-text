# Lykke Li: singing gyrating miracle of Indie music
## 
### 
Who in the world ever said indie music wasn't fun?
Certainly not Lykke Li. Last year, the Swedish
singer proclaimed, "Indie music is the new pop
because everybody likes indie music. It's not really alterna
tive anymore." True to her word, this indie/electro/pop gold
en child proved just how appealing the music of today can
be. She had everyone gathered at the Fillmore last Saturday
throwing their hands up, bopping their heads and singing
along ebulliently in a way Death Cab for Cutie could never
dream of.
Although no one outside of the Nordic countries can pro
nounce her name correctly — myself included — Lykke Li
(real name: Li Lykke Timotej Zachrisson) took the hipster
world by storm last year with her album "Youth Novels." Li
has quite the international pedigree — she was born in
Sweden, but spent much of her youth in Portugal, Nepal and
later New York City, where she recorded her album. Her up
tempo, clappy beats and wandering, breathy vocals made
"Youth Novels" one of the highest-rated albums of the indie
blogosphere in 2008.
However, this girl is much more than a musician ... even at
the ripe age of 22 she is already a full-blown entertainer.
You Tube is chock full of Li's impromptu performances.
There, she can be seen rattling spoons on bathroom sinks to
the tune of'Tm Good, I'm Gone,"and collaborating with the
incredible band Bon Iver on "Dance Dance Dance" in a Los
Angeles park.
When I heard that this kooky Swede was returning to San
Francisco for another show in the Bay Area, I immediately
surrendered my bank account to the Ticketmaster gods and
secured myself a place on the venue floor. My expectations
were already very high, but Lykke Li easily exceeded them.
Upon reaching the Fillmore, I immediately forgot the down
pour outside as I bubbled with anticipation among a sold
out crowd waiting for Lykke Li to come on stage. After jock
eying for prime standing space, the lights dimmed and Li
confidently strolled out onto the stage alone in the darkness.
Her long blonde hair was pulled back into a straight, elegant
ponytail and she had draped chunky silver necklaces over her
short black dress.
With her deep-set dark eyes, she cast a stoic gaze onto the
audience and began an a cappella version of her first single
"Dance Dance Dance, accompanied onlv bv the cow bell in

' her hand and the tambourine tucked under her arm. With a
i bash of the cymbals, the lights blazed and revealed her name
» written in massive letters on the back of the stage. A band of
thin young Swedes in suits joined in, Li tossed the cowbell
• aside and the concert was underway.
i As Lykke Li tore her way through "Little Bit," "Complaint
' Department" and fan-favorite tracks not on her album, such as
; "Until We Bleed" and a cover of Kings of Leon's "Knocked Up,"
her voice sustained its unique sound. She managed to project a
soft, girly whisper with a powerful, energetic boom. The band
— especially the superb drummer — pumped the songs up for
i live performance, transforming the mellow album into a loud,
layered and powerfully percussive.
Throughout the show, Li never ceased contorting and gyrating
her body. Her past work as a backup dancer shone through
during the performance, but not in the choreographed and
rigid steps one might expect. She exuded a confidence in her
movements that put her somewhere between sassy and sexy
without committing fully to either label. Her arms flowed with
the music, reaching out beyond the microphone, covering her
head and loosening at the elbows. She climbed the stereo sys
tems and even dropped her hips and waved her bum a la
Beyonce while covering Lil* Wayne's hit "A Milli." Li's energy
swept the crowd. I have never seen the Fillmore dance like that
... hell, I've never danced like that.
Li brought the house down with her anthem "Breaking It Up.
She snatched a megaphone from backstage and chanted into
the microphone as she jellied and gyrated. The crowd yelled
her lyrics back to her, and each pair of hands in the venue was
raised high into the air and clapping the beat. As she walked off
stage, the calls for encore started immediately, and the entire
crowd jumped and stomped in unison. Li rewarded us quickly.
She sang "Tears on My Pillow" without any accompaniment
for all the valentines in the audience — and then rapped her
way through "Can I Kick It" by Tribe Called Quest.
When the concert came to a close, I turned to my two friends
and we spontaneously embraced, leaving the show with a new
found optimism for indie music. Lykke Li has injected attitude
and showmanship into the indie scene without sidelining an
ounce of her musics quality.
