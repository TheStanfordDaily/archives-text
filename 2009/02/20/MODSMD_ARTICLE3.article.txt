## OSCAR PREDICTIONS 
### 
The past couple of years have been rough on
Hollywood. First, there was the infamous
writers' strike, and, as of late, the seemingly
never-ending Screen Actors Guild (SAG) negotia
tions (think writers' strike—but with the actors
instead). To make matters worse, the U.S. economy is
certainly not helping. Doom and gloom aside, the
81st Annual Academy Awards is still on course this
year to celebrate the bevSt films of the year.
When looking at the slate of movie nominations,
the first major difference we have noticed this year is
the variability in the number of films nominated for
each category. In case you haven't noticed, the Oscars
are all about Hollywood politics. Each year, as the
famed award show approaches, movie studios churn
out their top-notch Oscar-worthy films in the hopes
of garnering enough attention to nab a nomination.
Tins basically results in an orgy of films that bom
bard our theaters with so much Hollywood buzz and
stardom we can hardly keep up. It is this annual film
smattering which makes this year so different.
Blame the economy, Hollywood's internal politics or
a combination of the both, but the truth of the mat
ter remains that the industry is turning out fewer
films this year. Now is this a bad thing for the Oscars?
Not necessarily, as fewer films means the nomina
tions are not as spread out across the board, as was
the case in the 2007 Academy Award nominations.
That year, the films up for Best Picture were "No
Country for Old Men," "Atonement," "Juno,"
"Michael Clayton" and "There Will Be Blood." But
nominations for the categories of Best Director and
Best Actor/Actress came not only from the above
mentioned films, but also from such films as
"Sweeney Todd," "La Vie en Rose," "The Diving Bell
and the Butterfly" and "Charlie Wilson's War," just to
name a few —and believe me, there were plenty more
films in the other categories.
This variability in films is curiously absent in
this year's lineup, which means the truly great movies
will have better chances of sweeping up awards.
Doesn't it just make sense for a movie that wins Best
Picture to also win Best Director? You would think
that categories like this would easily go hand-in
hand, which is why this year's award show is turning
out to be a more intense competition — because
nearly all of the movies nominated are stellar. In
short, this year's Oscars are turning out to be all
about quality over quantity.
With the state of the award show now in check,
it's time for one of my favorite hobbies ... Oscar pre
dictions! For the sake of brevity, I'm only going to
focus on the top seven categories, which include Best
Picture, Best Animated Film, Best Actor/Actress, Best
Supporting Actor/Actress and Best Director. Now
keep in mind: the predictions below arc my personal
selections, and they are done by not just who I think
will win, but who I think deserves to win. Enjoy!

Best Animated Feature Film:
"Bolt,""Kung Fu Panda," "Wall-E"
My Pick: "Wall-E"
Reason: Pixar has always dominated this cate
gory, and this year is no different. "Wall-E" is
entertaining and thought-provoking.

Best Director:
Danny Boyle for "Slumdog
Millionaire," Stephen Daldry
for "The Reader" David
Fincher for "The Curious
Case of Benjamin Button,"
Ron Howard for
"Frost/Nixon," Gus Van Sant,
for "Milk"
My Pick: Danny Boyle for
"Slumdog Millionaire"
Reason: Same reason as Best
Picture

Best Actor:
Richard Jenkins in "The
Visitor," Frank Langella
in "Frost/Nixon," Sean
Penn in "Milk," Brad
Pitt in "The Curious
Case of Benjamin
Button," Mickey Rourke
in "The Wrestler"
My Pick: Sean Penn in
"Milk"
Reason: It's been a
tough year for gay
rights, and Scan Penn's
recent role is both pow
erful and politically rel
evant.

Best Supporting Actress:

Amy Adams in "Doubt," Penelope Cruz in "Vicky Cristina
Barcelona," Viola Davis in "Doubt," Taraji P. Henson in "The
Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Marisa Tomei in "The
Wrestler"
My Pick: Amy Adams in "Doubt"
Reason: Call this one a cut feeling ...

Best Picture:
"The Curious Case of Benjamin
Button," "Frost/Nixon," "Milk,"
"The Reader," "Slumdog
Millionaire"
My Pick: "Slumdog Millionaire"
Reason: This film is probably the
most original and unique of the
bunch—not to mention it has it
ALL. "Milk" is a close second.
ALI.MOVIEPHOTO.COM

Best Actress:
Anne Hathaway in "Rachel
Getting Married" Angelina Jolie
in "Changeling," Melissa Leo in
"Frozen River," Meryl Strecp in
"Doubt," Kate Winslet in "The
Reader"
My Pick: Kate Winslet in "The
Reader"
Reason: Kate Winslet has always
been an Oscar favorite, yet she has
never actually wo nan award. I ler
latest performance in "The
Reader" is definitely good enough
for her to finally make that
acceptance speech.

Best Supposing Actor:
Josh Brolin in "Milk," Robert Downey Jr. In "Tropic
Thunder," Philip Seymour Hoffman in "Doubt," Heath j
Ledger in "The Dark Knight," Michael Shannon in :
"Revolutionary Road"
My Pick: Heath Ledger in "The Dark Knight"
Reason: Although I am personally a huge fan of Robert
Downey in "Trofie Thunder," this one has got to go to
Heath. Anyone who has seen "The Dark Knight" will
know wlmi

The past couple of years have been rough on
Hollywood. First, there was the infamous
writers' strike, and, as of late, the seemingly
never-ending Screen Actors Guild (SAG) negotia
tions (think writers' strike—but with the actors
instead). To make matters worse, the U.S. economy is
certainly not helping. Doom and gloom aside, the
81st Annual Academy Awards is still on course this
year to celebrate the bevSt films of the year.
When looking at the slate of movie nominations,
the first major difference we have noticed this year is
the variability in the number of films nominated for
each category. In case you haven't noticed, the Oscars
are all about Hollywood politics. Each year, as the
famed award show approaches, movie studios churn
out their top-notch Oscar-worthy films in the hopes
of garnering enough attention to nab a nomination.
Tins basically results in an orgy of films that bom
bard our theaters with so much Hollywood buzz and
stardom we can hardly keep up. It is this annual film
smattering which makes this year so different.
Blame the economy, Hollywood's internal politics or
a combination of the both, but the truth of the mat
ter remains that the industry is turning out fewer
films this year. Now is this a bad thing for the Oscars?
Not necessarily, as fewer films means the nomina
tions are not as spread out across the board, as was
the case in the 2007 Academy Award nominations.
That year, the films up for Best Picture were "No
Country for Old Men," "Atonement," "Juno,"
"Michael Clayton" and "There Will Be Blood." But
nominations for the categories of Best Director and
Best Actor/Actress came not only from the above
mentioned films, but also from such films as
"Sweeney Todd," "La Vie en Rose," "The Diving Bell
and the Butterfly" and "Charlie Wilson's War," just to
name a few —and believe me, there were plenty more
films in the other categories.
This variability in films is curiously absent in
this year's lineup, which means the truly great movies
will have better chances of sweeping up awards.
Doesn't it just make sense for a movie that wins Best
Picture to also win Best Director? You would think
that categories like this would easily go hand-in
hand, which is why this year's award show is turning
out to be a more intense competition — because
nearly all of the movies nominated are stellar. In
short, this year's Oscars are turning out to be all
about quality over quantity.
With the state of the award show now in check,
it's time for one of my favorite hobbies ... Oscar pre
dictions! For the sake of brevity, I'm only going to
focus on the top seven categories, which include Best
Picture, Best Animated Film, Best Actor/Actress, Best
Supporting Actor/Actress and Best Director. Now
keep in mind: the predictions below arc my personal
selections, and they are done by not just who I think
will win, but who I think deserves to win. Enjoy!

Best Animated Feature Film:
"Bolt,""Kung Fu Panda," "Wall-E"
My Pick: "Wall-E"
Reason: Pixar has always dominated this cate
gory, and this year is no different. "Wall-E" is
entertaining and thought-provoking.

Best Director:
Danny Boyle for "Slumdog
Millionaire," Stephen Daldry
for "The Reader" David
Fincher for "The Curious
Case of Benjamin Button,"
Ron Howard for
"Frost/Nixon," Gus Van Sant,
for "Milk"
My Pick: Danny Boyle for
"Slumdog Millionaire"
Reason: Same reason as Best
Picture

Best Actor:
Richard Jenkins in "The
Visitor," Frank Langella
in "Frost/Nixon," Sean
Penn in "Milk," Brad
Pitt in "The Curious
Case of Benjamin
Button," Mickey Rourke
in "The Wrestler"
My Pick: Sean Penn in
"Milk"
Reason: It's been a
tough year for gay
rights, and Scan Penn's
recent role is both pow
erful and politically rel
evant.

Best Supporting Actress:

Amy Adams in "Doubt," Penelope Cruz in "Vicky Cristina
Barcelona," Viola Davis in "Doubt," Taraji P. Henson in "The
Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Marisa Tomei in "The
Wrestler"
My Pick: Amy Adams in "Doubt"
Reason: Call this one a cut feeling ...

Best Picture:
"The Curious Case of Benjamin
Button," "Frost/Nixon," "Milk,"
"The Reader," "Slumdog
Millionaire"
My Pick: "Slumdog Millionaire"
Reason: This film is probably the
most original and unique of the
bunch—not to mention it has it
ALL. "Milk" is a close second.

Best Actress:
Anne Hathaway in "Rachel
Getting Married" Angelina Jolie
in "Changeling," Melissa Leo in
"Frozen River," Meryl Strecp in
"Doubt," Kate Winslet in "The
Reader"
My Pick: Kate Winslet in "The
Reader"
Reason: Kate Winslet has always
been an Oscar favorite, yet she has
never actually wo nan award. I ler
latest performance in "The
Reader" is definitely good enough
for her to finally make that
acceptance speech.

Best Supposing Actor:
Josh Brolin in "Milk," Robert Downey Jr. In "Tropic
Thunder," Philip Seymour Hoffman in "Doubt," Heath j
Ledger in "The Dark Knight," Michael Shannon in :
"Revolutionary Road"
My Pick: Heath Ledger in "The Dark Knight"
Reason: Although I am personally a huge fan of Robert
Downey in "Trofie Thunder," this one has got to go to
Heath. Anyone who has seen "The Dark Knight" will
know wlmi
