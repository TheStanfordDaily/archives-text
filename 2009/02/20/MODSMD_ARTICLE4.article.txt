# FiLM REVIEW
## The 						film of a generation! But not exactly ours... 
### 
Every now and then, a film gets released that speaks to a
generation and tackles specific moments in history that
rocked us to our very core. "Pearl Harbor" (2001) hit the
WWII generation, while "World Trade Center" (2006) had an
impact on ours. Although these films are made to be universal
ly appealing to the public, the fact of the matter remains that
they have larger impacts on those who lived through the events
in the film. Enter "Frost/Nixon," producer/director Ron
Howard's latest flick. Adapted from Peter Morgan's stage play
by the same name, "Frost/Nixon" takes us back to the 1970s to
recount the clash of minds between recently resigned Richard
Nixon and popular talk show host David Frost in a series of
exclusive, one-on-one interviews.
The big issue at stake here is the fact that the majority of
us college folk were not even born when Nixon was president,
let alone when these Frost interviews took place. Does that
mean that this film will be totally uninteresting to those
belonging to the iPod generation? Thankfully, that answer is a
big no, as Howard is able to brilliantly craft this political peri
od piece into an intense silver-screen showdown. Howard con
tinues to excel as a director, and it shows, with "Frost/Nixon"
touting five Oscar nominations, including Best Director and
Best Picture.
Nominations aside, I would be lying if I said that I was
immediately in this film from the get-go. Political dramas are
not my personal favorite, especially ones about historical
events that occurred before my time. Biases aside, I was pleas
antly surprised to find myself quickly intrigued by the premise
of the movie, as well as its characters. Taking place three years

after Nixon's resignation, the story begins with its focus on
hot-shot talk show host David Frost, played by Michael Sheen.
Boldly looking to make an even bigger name for himself, Frost
sets his goals quite high by requesting to have a series of inter
views with Nixon, in the hopes of confronting him about the
legendary Watergate scandal. Nixon, played by Frank Langella,
accepts the interviews on the assumption that he will easily
best Frost.
I will warn you now: If movies that are all talk and no
"action" arc not really your thing, then "Frost/Nixon" might be
a tough one to swallow. In its defense, right away, the inter
views between Frost and Nixon become so much more than
simple Q&A. Nixon views these interviews as a way for him to
publicly outwit his opponent, show his intellectual savvy and
re-launch his political agenda. This feat comes naturally to
Nixon, as we quickly discover that he is not one to be taken
lightly at all. Frost, who began this escapade on a whim, quick
ly realizes that his life and career may very well depend on the
outcome of these interviews.
The opposing forces of Frost and Nixon then proceed to
clash in four interview sessions, each with their own topic of
focus. As previously mentioned, these interviews transform
into a battleground where slings and arrows are questions and
statements. Most of these verbal weapons belong to Nixon, as
he easily shows his mastery and skills with the English lan
guage — skills which makes me wish I had joined a debate
team. It is also in these scenes where Langella truly shines and
proves the merits of his Oscar nomination for Best Actor in a
Leading Role. Langella is not alone in his endeavors, and the

the vital stats.

film" prides itself on top-notch acting and characterization.
Frost's growth as a talk show host and a person is perfectly
portrayed, and the range of subtle emotions that Langella is
able to pour into his character as the fallen president actually
pull at people's heartstrings.

When it comes down to it, though, the only "problem"
that I see with this film is its overall appeal. As far as film tech
nique is concerned, one would be hard-pressed to find any
serious flaws in "Frost/Nixon." But no matter how good it is,
most of this will mean very little if people have no interest in
seeing it. No matter how good the movie actually is, 1 honest
ly cannot imagine it striking a chord with the general masses,
particularly among those who were not around when Nixon
was the center of attention. To sum it up differently, this film
is not going to attract blockbuster numbers, but for the people
that do end up seeing it, they will find an intelligent, historical
ly relevant story about defeat and redemption.
