# "It's not you, it's Lily Allen"...
## 
### 
It's now impossible to separate Lily Allen's
public persona from her music. Her new
album, "It's Not Me, It's You" came out
over a week ago after years of tactless, overly
informative public statements and more than
a few scandalous photos. Her current image is
nothing more than then a shrill chorus of
"The Daily Mirror,""The Sun "and"The Daily
Mail" headlines. In Britain, she is now a major
star and, in America, minor but constant
tabloid fodder.
Allen's tumultuous journey through fame
is the central theme of her sophomore album,
"It's Not Me, It's You." Where the first album
had the naive optimism of a young girl who
made it big via MySpace (she, indeed, is one of
the most successful alumna of the MySpace
music era), "It's Not Me, It's You" is weighed
down by the confusions and concerns of
celebrity. Even when Allen's lyrics address
something seemingly non-fame-related
say, her love life — an informed listener can
not help but think of the latest photo on a
yacht with a muli-millionaire, older British

man.
It's all enough to give up on her

... but then there is the music.
Allen's new album is an
eclectic, glossy, synth-pop rich J
collection with textures and™
hooks. Her first album—f
"Alright, Still" — was built on a "
foundation of breezy ska
rhythms and laidback atmos
pheres. Allen's second album,
however, is a more muscular affa

— polished production, stronger backbeats,
faster paces and none of the airy touches that
defined the popular hooks of "Smile" and
"LDN." Indeed, the new Lily experiments with
electro-dash, ("Back to the Start"), Eastern
European folk ("Never Gonna Happen") and
even country ("It's Not Fair").
Allen compliments the excellent music
with her famously sharp — and characteristi
cally British — wit and charming voice. She has
a penchant for wordplay and droll zingers ("I

want loads of clothes/And fuck clothes with diamonds/1
heard people died while trying to find them") that com
pliment her slightly slurred British accent.
Her obvious verbal skills channel an attitude that
few other female singers possess — a mature-beyond
her-years toughness. Allen often comes off less like a 23-
year-old and more like world-weary 43-year-old. (She
attended 13 schools growing up and was selling ecstasy
in Ibiza, Spain by the time she was 13 — so she has
clearly been around the block a few times. )
In the chorus of "Never Gonna Happen," Allen tlies
the flag of female power by scorning a former lover —
"I don't understand what it is that you're chasing
after/But it makes me really sad to hear you sound so
desperate." Sung over a sunburst of piano chords and
stuttered drums, she sounds very collected, very sure of
herself. Indeed, she explains her continued trysts —
"Now, I know you feel betrayed/But it's been weeks
since I got laid." This side of Allen is a large part of her
fun, but only a portion of her appeal.
Her weary exterior is in constant, captivating strug
gle against her more sensitive, emotionally fragile inte
rior. But on other tracks, the cracks in her armor are on
clear display: "The Fear" is a take on fame told

from the perspective of a confused outsider. In the hook
she croons, "I don't know what's right and what's real
anymore.' In the poignant song "22," Allen sings about
a 30-year-old woman whose youthful dreams — a
career and a boyfriend — are still eluding her. Finally, in
"It's Not Fair," she laments the sexual selfishness of her
boyfriend with an emphatically girly and vulnerable,
"It's not fair/I think you're really mean."
I here are a few misses. The worst track is "Fuck
You," a particularly unimaginative ode to former
President Bush. Such protest songs were creative circa
five years ago, pre-Obama. Moreover, it is a not grand
statement for a European to lay into the former
President of the United States. The final ode to her
father, "He Wasn't There," never fully melds the combi
nation of 19405-style pop and Allen's public confes
sions.
I hesc misses aside, Allen has proven herself to be a
master of her pop-craft. Now, if only she could master
her personal life with the same skill ...
