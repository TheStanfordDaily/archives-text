# "It's not you, it's Lily Allen"...

### 
It's now impossible to separate Lily Allen's
public persona from her music. Her new
album, "It's Not Me, It's You" came out
over a week ago after years of tactless, overly
informative public statements and more than
a few scandalous photos. Her current image is
nothing more than then a shrill chorus of
"The Daily Mirror,""The Sun "and"The Daily
Mail" headlines. In Britain, she is now a major
star and, in America, minor but constant
tabloid fodder.
Allen's tumultuous journey through fame
is the central theme of her sophomore album,
"It's Not Me, It's You." Where the first album
had the naive optimism of a young girl who
made it big via MySpace (she, indeed, is one of
the most successful alumna of the MySpace
music era), "It's Not Me, It's You" is weighed
down by the confusions and concerns of
celebrity. Even when Allen's lyrics address
something seemingly non-fame-related
say, her love life — an informed listener can
not help but think of the latest photo on a
yacht with a muli-millionaire, older British

man.

hooks. Her first album—f
"Alright, Still" — was built on a "
foundation of breezy ska
rhythms and laidback atmos
pheres. Allen's second album,
however, is a more muscular affa

— polished production, stronger backbeats,
faster paces and none of the airy touches that
defined the popular hooks of "Smile" and
"LDN." Indeed, the new Lily experiments with
electro-dash, ("Back to the Start"), Eastern
European folk ("Never Gonna Happen") and
even country ("It's Not Fair").
Allen compliments the excellent music
with her famously sharp — and characteristi
cally British — wit and charming voice. She has
a penchant for wordplay and droll zingers ("I
