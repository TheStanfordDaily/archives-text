## The 						Fray: more of (almost) the same the 						vital stats. 
### 
Catchy intros — check. Piano ballads —
check. Issac Slade's emotional crooning —
check. Angst — double check, starred and
underlined with red ink.
Three years and some odd months after
their breakthrough, those elements are widely
prevalent in The Fray's self-titled album released on
Feb. 3. With the commercial and fanatical success of
"How to Save a Life," the Denver-based band with
frontrunner Isaac Slade has produced a new album
that emulates the same pop/rock characteristics of
their first.
Released in late November last year, their
first single, "You Found Me," sounds like a response
to the first album's "How to Save a Life." In Xhe
Fray's attempts to appease their anguish, the unpre
dictability of difficult circumstances and disap
pointment are common themes associated with
"You Found Me" ("You got some kind of nerve tak
ing all I want").

"You Found Me" is a song clearly indica
tive of the rest of the 10 tracks on the

album. There are many more minor-key
melodies, heavier guitar riffs and
piano breakdowns than their previous i
smash success. While the band tries to |
evolve its sound by incorporating j
these components, their experiments '
with more melancholy lyrics and rock
laden tracks deviate only slightly from
the last album.

Let's start off with the first track,
"Syndicate." It begins with an appealing piano intro,
which then progresses to the overlay of Slade's
vocals and guitar riffs. By channeling their new
approach, The Fray utilizes upbeat tempos and
more rock-like themes in the track "Say When." In
"We Build Then We Break," The Fray begins with an
energetic bass introduction in a style similar to The
Killers. Of all the tracks on the album, this one pro
duces the most original and different sound — and
Slade's distinctive vocals contribute to that authen
ticity. This aggressive track parallels the only rock
oriented song on The Fray's first album, "Little
House."
The slower tracks of the new album focus
more on the sentimental themes of heartbreak and
despair. In the dramatic piano ballad "Never Say
Never," Slade touts his vocal prowess by shifting into
falsetto after wretchedly singing, "Don't let me go."
His emotional crooning appears again only in the

final track, "Happiness."
An acoustic guitar
accompanies Slade and
his depressing lyrics:
"Happiness damn near
destroys you, breaks your
faith to pieces on the
floor." An uplifting choir
assists Slade near the end
to provide an optimistic
conclusion to this track.

While this album tries to tread new waters
by trying to utilize more rock elements and dramat
ic, slow-tempo outbursts, The Fray produced an
album that can serve as a marginally modified ver
sion of "How to Save a Life." In track two,
"Absolute," The Fray poses the question, "Is this all
we get?" Fortunately, if all you want is an enjoyable
reiteration of more of the same, then this self-titled
album will keep Fray fanatics and casual listeners
satisfied.
