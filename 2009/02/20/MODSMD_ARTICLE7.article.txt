# Cantor installation artist works with students
## 
### 
In 1884, thirteen years before the
invention of the typhoid vac
cine, a boy from California died
of typhoid fever in Rome at the age
of 15. The child's body was trans
ported back to California as
Americans across the country
lamented the loss.
The boy, whose death was fol
lowed by such outrageously intri
cate and vast memorial services, was
none other than Leland Stanford
Junior. The scale of his funerals in
San Francisco was unprecedented
by the standards of the time—and
The New York Times reported on
the public's reaction with the head
line "California Astonished:
Extraordinary Display over Young
Leland Stanford's Corpse."
Leland Stanford Jr.'s death — and
the pageantry surrounding it — was
a great source of fascination for
Darren Waterston, a San Francisco
based artist. Waterston had earlier
applied for a partnership with
Cantor to display an installation in
which he would incorporate his
own art into Cantor's existing col
lection. Ultimately, this idea
matured into the concept of turning
the Cantor gallery into a Victorian
mourning parlor and inspired the
artist toward the creation of paint

ings that deal with spirituality and
the afterlife.
The installation will also display
commemorative portraits of
Stanford Jr. and materials from the
Special Collections Archives of
Green Library that had never been
displayed before. This installation,
which will open in April, is titled
"The Art of Splendid Grief: Darren
Waterston and the Afterlife of
Leland Stanford Jr."
Waterston held a number of work
shops in which he invited Stanford
students to help him create the
materials for the exhibit's design
and decoration. The sessions con
sisted of two workshops, both of
which were laid back and allowed
plenty of room for personal interac
tion with the artist, who was
approachable and attentive to his

assistants.
I, along with a number of other
Stanford students, attended the
workshop and had the opportunity
to assist Waterston in creating the
materials for the exhibit's design
and constructing elements of the
show's decoration, such as standing
Victorian mourning wreaths, made
entirely of black crepe paper flow
ers. Waterston was extremely friend
ly and dynamic in teaching us how
to paint black paper butterfly forms
and a number of other projects.
Participating in the workshop
required no prior experience and
was accessible to students of all skill
levels. Personally, while I was paint
ing the butterflies, it was mesmeriz
ing to think of the visual effect that
hundreds of these hand-painted
"Morpho" butterflies will produce

when displayed together in the cen
tral clement of "The Art of Splendid
Grief."
Waterston started his partner
ship with the Cantor Arts Center
two years ago, when Cantor was
looking into having more contem
porary art programming at the
museum. Waterston, whose paint
ings have been greatly influenced by
pioneers of abstractionism, such as
Kandinsky and Kupka, thought he
was a good fit for this mission and
successfully applied for a chance to
display at the museum. After exten
sive research of the materials from
Special Collections Archive and the
Cantor collection, he became inter
ested in the extent and extraordi
nary scale of the funeral services for
Leland Stanford Jr., which included
a good deal of commemorative art.
"Stanford as an institution, which
was founded as a tribute to Leland
Junior, is unique because of its
memorial function, which is still
visible all over the campus,"

Waterston said. "Memorial Church,
Memorial Hall, signs in the Quad
that bear the boy's quotes —all are
signifiers of the scale of the Stanford
family's mourning that transcends
time and lives on. 1 became interest
ed in their display of grief and its
consequences, and in such a way the
exhibit was born."
When asked whether he had ever
done an installation like this before,
or worked in the "mourning" style,
Waterston said he had never created
a mourning parlor prior to "The Art
of Splendid Grief."
However, as an intellectual who has
extensive interest in Theosophy and
its focus on the spiritual internal
self, Waterston has paintings that
speak of realms which go beyond
those immediately visible to
humans. The eight works he created
for the Cantor exhibit are influ
enced by his perception of spiritual
ity, and life transcending death.
Meanwhile, as I reflect on the medi
tating process of painting dozens of
Morpho butterflies, I look forward
to next Thursday's workshop with
Darren Waterston, when the "Art of
Splendid Grief" will be coming to
life right in front of my eyes.
