# Jose Limon memorialized for the younger gen.
## 
### 
When I was a young child,
there was a program
called "Reading
Rainbow" that was designed to
make picture books more interest
ing. Omar, the friendly host, would
read books to me while still frames
of the illustrations accompanying
the story flashed by the screen. Kids
these days are much luckier.
Making Books Sing is a per
formance company based in New
York City that aims to "empower
children to experience literature and
theatre as vehicles for their imagina
tions and learning." Using children's
books that are socially relevant and
politically — as well as historically
— aware, the company stages musi
cals to help children become
immersed in the beauty of the arts.
In honor of its West Coast
debut, Making Books Sing has creat
ed a new musical based on the chil
dren's book "Jose! Born To Dance"
by Susanna Reich, illustrated by
Raul Colon. This story tells the tale
of Jos£ Limon, the world famous
modern dancer and choreographer.
To celebrate the hundred-year
anniversary of Limon's birth,
Stanford Lively Arts produced a
musical as part of its Limon
Centenary Celebration. This partic
ular program focused on children's
knowledge and understanding of
this incredible human being.
When I first walked into

Dinkelspiel Auditorium, I was over
whelmed by the number of children
who had dressed up for the theatre
and were being told to settle down
by their parents and grandparents.
The excitement among the kids was
palpable —it was evident they
couldn't wait to see the book they
had all read performed on stage.
The show begins with a very
eager actor, portraying lose Limon,
introducing himself to the kids in
the audience. He asks the crowd,
"How many of you are from anoth
er country? How many of your par
ents or grandparents arc from
another country?" Many cute little
arms spike into the air. The theme of
immigration—and the melting pot
that is the United States— is reiter
ated throughout the entire sixty
minute fast-paced musical.
The musical reflected the plot
of the storybook almost page by
page. With virtually no set and
props except some new costumes
and one pianist visible onstage, the
play relied on the story, along with
the song and dance, to capture and
keep the attention of an audience
that notoriously has a short atten
tion span. Furthermore, with a five
member cast, the actors were enor
mously flexible—every actor, except
for the actor playing Jose, played
multiple roles. With this came the
challenge of exceptionally fast cos
tume changes and the need to

emphatically differenti
ate between characters
in order to make it sim
ple for the young audi
ence to understand.
The actors were all
enormously talented,
and each had a distinct
and powerful voice.
The original score,
written for the musical,
was very simple and
makes use of basic
melodies and repeated
hooks. Each actor per
formed his or her song
with vocals straight
from Broadway. The
modern dancing was

also beautiful — it was wonderful to
see such an art form, generally
reserved for dance aficionados and
others knowledgeable on the sub
ject, have an impact on children.
The simplicity of the piano, com
bined with subtle yet powerful
movement of the dancers, all com
bined to illustrate the beauty of
Limon's lifework.
However, song and dance aside,
this show was designed almost
exclusively for an audience of chil
dren. Making Books Sing has an
extensive repertoire of other pro
grams, all designed to target ele
mentary school children and their
teachers. In fact, the majority of the
performances scheduled at Stanford

were reserved for the school chil
dren and their teachers in the local
area. This is very evident in the style
of the dialogue; Jose often asks
asides to the children in a very
childlike manner. Lines were often
repeated as well.
Making Books Sing, while truly
kid-oricnted, has created a beautiful
staged work with the production of
"Jose Limon: The Making of an
Artist." The New York Times wrote,
"The production's economy of
means is part of its pleasure ... just
unpretentious use of basic melody
and rhythm to tuck aspects of
Limon's story engagingly into the
nervous system." This show did
exactly that. After reading the free

copy of the beautifully illustrated
picture book — given to every fam
ily of ticket holders — and watching
this simply constructed yet beauti
fully executed musical, 1 am unlike
to forget the story of Jose Limon. It's
definitely a much more exquisite
and memorable experience than
watching an episode of Reading
Rainbow.
