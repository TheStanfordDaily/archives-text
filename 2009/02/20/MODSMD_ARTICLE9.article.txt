# The
						Gentlemen of Verona spice up the 20s

The Stanford Shakespeare Company added another successful per
formance to their repertoire with the opening of "Two Gentlemen ol
Verona," one of Shakespeare's earlier and lesser-known works. Set in
the 19205, the play tells the story of two gentlemen whose trials and woes of
love test the strength of their friendship.
Valentine (Phillip BowenJ and Proteus (Philip Balliet), the two titular
gentlemen of Verona, form the central friendship in the play. Valentine, in
search of the exciting courtly lifestyle, embarks to Milan, closely followed by
Proteus, who leaves behind his faithful lover Julia (Geeta Persad). In Milan,
both friends fall in love with the same woman: the beautiful Silvia, subject
of some of the most famous lines of the play — "What light is light, if Silvia
be not seen? "I his conflict of love draws a temporary wedge in the two gen
tlemen's friendship and sends both of them (along with Julia and a bevy of
humorous supporting characters) on a rollicking journey through the
tribulations of love and loyalty.
The Stanford Shakespeare Company traditionally sets its plays in dif
ferent eras to add an interpretive twist — "Two Gentlemen" draws on the
richly visual setting of the roaring twenties. However, since the performers
stay true to the original dialogue, there's little room for incorporating the
setting into the action. Instead, the company manages to infuse the produc
tion with the ambiance of the decade through music and costumes. The
Elizabethan getups are replaced by double-breasted pinstripe suits, flapper
dresses are replaced with jazz music and the play's band of banished outlaws
is portrayed here as circus sideshow freaks — bearded lady included.
The set design, though simple, was very evocative of art-deco style —
including checkerboard steps and a standing panel reminiscent of the art of
Piet Mondrian's squares made of primary colors. The company also made
creative use of the space within the Elliott Program Center by separating the
audience into two sections and placing the side stage exits behind the seats,

creating a more intimate atmosphere.
Audiences have come to expect excellent acting from StanShakes, and
their production of Two Gentlemen delivered without fail. It goes without
saying that the two leads handled their heavier and more serious parts
extremely well, but at points the smaller comedic parts came close to steal
ing the show. With impeccable timing and clever interpretation of the text,
the company brought Shakespeare's words to life with universal appeal.
For example, Speed (Mary Glen Fredrick) and Launce (Aaron Berg),
the two gentlemen's servants, tossed around witty banter with case, and
Thurio (Alex Connolly), though a small part, was performed with such
ovcr-thc-top hilarity that audiences laughed even when he wasn't speaking.
Julia's particularly amusing reaction to a love letter, though expressed in
Elizabethan English, sounded just like a girl today giggling over a text mes
sage — a humorous testament to the timeless quality of Shakespeare. And
last but not least, the live dog (Charlotte) made her Shakespearean debut
with flair and irresistible charm as Launce's dog, Crab.
The play carries its thematic weight gracefully as well. "Part of the joy
of working on a lesser-read play like this is finding the similarities and
themes that carry throughout all of Shakespeare's works," wrote show direc
tor Joe Camp in the program notes. The play's thematic elements are famil
iar — friendship, honesty, trust — but they have an almost modern feel to
them despite its history. Silvia, defying society's passive roles for women,
takes action and refuses Proteus' love because she doesn't approve of the
way he abandons Julia; Valentine and Proteus reconcile at the end despite
their competition for Silvia — an early example of "bros before hos," or
"lads before ladies" as the case may be, perhaps?
The company worked hard to bring these age-old themes into the mod
ern world for today's audience, and on that level the production delivers on
