The Stanford Community is Invited to Submit
Nominations for a New University Award:

Excellence Through Diversity
These awards recognize and honor individuals and programs that have made exceptional
contributions to enhancing and supporting diversity (broadly defined) within the

campus community enhances our institutional excellence by broadening and
strengthening the teaching, learning and scholarship that are the university's missions.
The awards will recognize contributions to diversity in many aspects of university life.
Examples include: development of innovative recruitment programs that attract faculty,
staff, and/or students who add to Stanford's diversity (broadly defined); exceptional
mentoring of undergraduate and/or graduate students whose background, experience,
and interests contribute to diversity on campus; development and implementation of
effective advancement opportunities for our diverse population of employees;
development of curricular and/or research projects on topics focusing on peoples'
identities, origins and cultures within the United States and globally that enrich students
education in novel ways; and development and enhancement of activities that build
community within and among diverse groups of students, faculty, and staff.
Two awards will usually be made each year, one to an individual from among the
faculty, students, and staff, and the second to a campus unit such as a department,
program or office.
