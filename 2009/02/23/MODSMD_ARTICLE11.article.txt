## Ensler brings insight on Congo "Monologues" writer, Mukwege discuss violence against women 
### ZOE LEAVITT 
Eve Ensler, writer of the"The Vagina Monologues,"
called on students to take a stand against the atrocities com
mitted toward women in the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) on Friday. In a discussion with Congolese
gynecologist Dr. Dennis Mukwege. Ensler outlined horror
after horror witnessed in the DRC. and argued that violence
against women was a universal issue.
"1 wish I could tell you violence against women was a
particularly cultural thing," Ensler said. "In fact, it isn't. It's a
human thing. 1 have yet to be in any village or town in the
entire world where violence against women isn't rampant."
Ensler began her speech with a bang, drawing in the audi
ence with a monologue based on the experiences of
Congolese rape survivors. From the perspective of a girl kid
napped by soldiers. Ensler hammered home her points
through a series of rules for survival.
"Get over this "It can't happen to you ... these soldiers
are here to protect me' thing." Ensler said in her monologue.
"It will only confuse you. Never look at him when he is rap
ing you ... build yourself a hole and crawl inside ... After
the first 20 times, it will no longer hurt you. Your insides will
no longer belong to you."
Mukwege further opened the audience's eyes bv dis
cussing his experiences as a doctor in the Panzi hospital, a
hospital he helped establish to aid rape survivors — with
women ranging from tiny, six month-old infants to <SO-year
old grandmothers.
'Iliough Mukwege began work in obstetrics and gynecol
ogy. helping women injured in childbirth, he soon began to
see other cases of physical damage to women's bodies as the
war in the DRC developed.
"I started seeing cases of rape with assault, not 'normal'
rapes," Mukwege said through an interpreter. "Rapes with
atrocities, with psychological tortures, with the aim of
destroying a woman's genital organs. When 1 saw the first

instance. I thought it was the only incident, hut I started see
ing more and I realized this was part of the war."
Since 1999, Mukwege estimates the hospital has helped
24.(XX) women. Ile performs about 10 surgeries each day to
repair fistulas, or holes in women's genital areas. He has
repeatedly described this rape and mutilation practice as
sexual terrorism.
"When you meet these women, families, communities,
that have been terrorized bv rape, you realize rape is as ter
rible as any major biological weapon you can use."
Mukwege said.
Mukwege further challenged the audience to think about
the consequences of rape.
"Not only are these women infected by HIV/AIDS, but
they also have no chance of being able to have children in
the future," he said. "These things also destroy any social
cohesion within the community. When a father is not able to
protect his child or his wife, then those family links are bro
ken. leading to a total lack of social cohesion. And in the end
these populations end up moving away, so you have a huge
number of displaced persons. The end result is the result of a
terrorist action."
Ensler emphasized that just like any terrorist action, rape
and genital mutilation are problems not specific to race or
particular groups of people.
Economically, she explained that the cell phones and
DVD players that most Stanford students own help fund the
terrorism taking place in the DRC Since the Congo holds
much of the world's reserves of coltan.a mineral vital to such
electronic devices, the resource attracts militant groups.
While Ensler has traveled across the world and talked to
thousands of victims of rape and violence, she said nothing
in her experiences prepared her for what she witnessed in
the Congo. She used her speech to pass on this knowledge to
Ihe Stanford community and to inspire people to action, or
at least awareness.
"I really didn't want to know what was going on in the
Congo, because once you know, there's a kind of sacred
responsibility," she concluded. "Now you all know what I
know, so now you are all equally responsible."
