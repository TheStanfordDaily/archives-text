## Editorial Stanford not yet a top-tier sustainable school 
### 
This past week.Stanford hit the bottom
of the barrel — or waste bin — secur
ing third-to-last place in the "Waste
Minimization" competition for Week Four of
Recycle Mania, a 10-week competition that
promotes recycling and waste reduction on
college and university campuses across the
nation. Recycle Mania, an annual contest put
on by the College and University Recycling
Council (CI JRC)and the National Recycling
Coalition (NRC). seeks to heighten aware
ness of school's waste management and recy
cling programs. The competition has come a
long way since the inaugural contest between
Miami University and Ohio University in
2001. According to the Recycle Mania Web
site. 514 schools are currently registered for
the 2(MWcompetition,and I4<S participated in
the waste reduction component of the com
petition.
Stanford students generally pride them
selves on being environmentally conscious
and socially aware. So what did we do to de
serve the unimpressive 146th-place finish?
Apparently, we produced a larger amount of
solid waste per capita, including recyclables
and trash, than almost any other school in our
peer'group. While Virginia Weslevan ( "til lege
put competitors to shame with a mere 1.56
pounds of waste per person, Stanford
claimed one of the largest trash heaps, al
legedly generating 32.43 pounds of munici
pal solid waste per person.
Although the editorial board is somewhat
skeptical about the reliability of the NRC's
methods for measuring campus waste — re
sults are calculated by taking the volume of
recyclables. adding it to the volume of trash
and dividing this number with the population
figure — Stanford's dismal performance
serves as a wake-up call for the reexamina
tion of University recycling and solid waste
management programs.
On one hand, the board is proud of the
steps that Stanford has taken to minimize
waste production and promote the collection
of compostable material. According to the
Stanford Recycling Center Web site, the Uni
versity is currently diverting 61 percent of its

waste away from the landfill.
On the other hand, there is still significant
room for improvement. For starters. Stanford
I lospitalitv & Auxiliaries, the group that oper
ates Tresidder Memorial Eateries.should place
highly visible and clearly labeled compost bins
in the dining area at Tresidder Union.The ab
sence of these bins undermines the education
al component of Stanford's composting and
recycling programs, as students are not neces
sarily aware of what they can do to reduce
waste. The editorial board commends efforts
to sort compostable material off-site, but be
lieves that the sustainability initiative would be
far more effective if students were informed of
what items constitute compost versus trash,
and were encouraged to sort it themselves.
The board acknowledges that composting
and recycling programs are expensive for the
University. Nevertheless, there are a number
of steps Stanford can and should take to en
courage waste reduction while simultane
ously cutting costs. Stanford Dining should
move in the direction of New York Universi
ty and implement "trav-less" dining. By elim
inating trays in residential dining locations.
Stanford can conserve water, reduce the
amount of chemical detergents released into
the environment and lower energy costs.
Tray-less dining also has the added benefit of
reducing the volume of food wasted in dining
halls. While some dining halls have fliers en
couraging students to refrain from using
trays when possible, taking them out of the
dining halls altogether is the best way to have
a significant effect.
Ultimately, if it wants to climb in the Re
cycle Mania rankings, Stanford should work
harder to ensure that students are active,
rather than passive, participants in a sustain
able food system. Visual cues such as labeled
waste bins and informational signs are key to
increasing campus environmental aware
ness. With more students doing their best to
generate less waste, recycle and compost the
appropriate materials each and every day,
Stanford can reduce energy costs and pro
mote sustainability. Who says you can't have
your cake and eat it too?
