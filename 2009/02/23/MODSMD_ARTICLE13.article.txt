## "25 things I hate about you" 
### 
Contrary to popular belief, I am NOT Black,
Indian or I lispanic.
I could go shopping for days and buy every
thing I see!
I know it's college, but sometimes I wonder if I
have a drinking problem. For real.
I LOVE- standardized tests.
I've been to therapy and taken medication for
anxiety. People think therapy is only for crazy
people, but 11 hink everyone in the whole world
would be happier if they went to therapy.
I didn't cry m /lie Notebook, but I tell everyone
I did.
My brother killed himsell when I was seven. I
was there but I can't remember it.
I can never have enough purses.
I know I don't deserve to go to war, but some
times I feel guilty that I'm at Stanford while my
high school friends get blown up in
Afghanistan.
I make my bed every day.

Where did this phenomenon come

Random linings About Me" bandwagon, with
over KX).(XX).IXX) random facts posted in less
than two weeks, in two weeks, a lifetime of
hopes, fears, dreams and shampoo preferences
have been spilled out into cyberspace for all the
world to read. It all |iist seems a little strange.
First off. to get things straight, most of the
"facts" on the lists ;ire meaningless crap, com
pletely inconsequential drivel thai reminds you
win it's been vearssince you've even seen most
of your I acebook friends. Some, though, are
genuinely mind-blowing stuff, lake the ten I
pulled for this column: they're funny,clever, ir
relevant. self-indulgent and heart-wrenching,
often all at the same time.
More than anything else. I think it has to do
with the advent of online social networking and
how it's reshaped our conceptions of our own
identities. Advances in technology have made
us both the best and worst connected college
students in history. We have access to hundreds
of mediums by which to communicate, but
m« >st (>1 112 hem grant us an almt >st absurd ami Hint
of psychic distance in our relationships, not to
mention free reign to wholly detach ourselves
from first-person interaction. We share our
text-based fears on AIM. We whisper our text
based secrets on Face book. We recount our

Gillespie

text-based dreams on G-chat. Technology lets
us communicate without communicating, to in
dulge in an online super persona and create a
more crafted,calculated self. I Jnlike life, there's
no randomness to online discourse, no chance
of "saving" the wrong thing— it's damn near
impossible to put your text-based foot into your
text-based mouth when you get an infinite
amount of chances to revise your presentation
and phrasing. Say the wrong thing in an AIM
box and you get to delete it: say it in the real
world and you have to deal with the conse
quences.
Facebook exploded so quickly because it
was a way for us to learn everything we wanted
to know about our peers without them realizing
that we were interested, and a way for individ
uals to control and precisely manipulate how
their own image was presented to the world.
It's impersonal and fake on both ends, and I
think the 25 Things phenomenon is an exten
sion of this. Maybe the lists are only smoke and
mirrors, more artificially rendered fluff that
bears no resemblance to real life, but maybe
they're so popular because people are excited
and relieved to find out that their classmates
are just as weird, scared, and generally twisted
as they are sometimes. Maybe the world iiist
gets complicated w hen we stake very real emo
tions on very fake.detached interactions.
As obnoxious as reading that your high
school ex loves backrubs and barn dances
(sigh) might be. I still think anything that pulls
people away from their micromanaged public
image, even if it still has to be hopelessly re
moved from the real world.is probably a step in
the right direction. Sure, most everything in
these notes is immaterial and serves no purpose
but to further shape one's self-styled cyber per
sona, but a few of these things I wish so badly I'd
found out face to face over a beer instead of on
my laptop in Meyer.These are big. meaningful,
brave statements,but this medium makes them
seem trivial and worthless.
During NSO. dorms have incoming resi
dents anonymously w rite secrets that get put up
on an all-dorm poster, and people never fail to
be shocked at what their classmates have dealt
with in their lives. Not signing our names may
make us more comfortable, but what if
anonymity isn't the answer? What if all we've
needed this whole time was just a real conver
sation?
Now forward this to 25 people or you'll never
be able to have children.
