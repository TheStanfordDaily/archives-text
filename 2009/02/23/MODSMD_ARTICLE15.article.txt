## An open letter to the Stanford faculty 
### 
Dear Distinguished Faculty of Stanford
University,
It was recently announced that as part of
the cuts in programs under the Vice
.Provost of Undergraduate Education
(VPUE). the Peer Mentor program and hon
oraria for pre-major faculty advising would
be cut. As a two-time Peer Mentor. I think I
speak for most students that the Peer Men
toring program was never particularly well
organized and constantly underutilized, and
most students were content to see it go.
The loss of honoraria for pre-major advis
ing is far more concerning, however. Pre
major faculty advising has been a constant
complaint among undergraduates at Stan
ford. Many students rush to declare a major
simply to get the quality advising from facul
ty that they so need.The participation rate for
faculty is already low. even with a monetary
reward, and it will likely decline even more.
Many incoming students already receive fac
ulty ad\ isers who are poorly matched to their
interests and cannot really help them. ITiis
phenomenon will likely get worse.
We've had a long history of mediocre fac
ulty advising. While doing research for this ar
ticle. I read a 1995 Stanford Report article
about a report discussing reform of faculty
advising. Hie article could have been written
today, hie Stanford Daily's Editorial Board
writes an article about advising every year. A
review of Faculty Senate minutes from the
past decade indicates that the issue has been
discussed every year. At this point, talking
about improving advising seems moot in the
era ol budget cuts. I am willing to concede
that point.
For all students, that first meeting with
their faculty adviser during New Student Ori
entation is their first interaction with Stan

ford faculty. 1 remember mine well — vastly
over-preparing by doing extensive research
and making an agenda for the meeting. I took
this meeting seriously, and I was pleased that
my adviser attempted to answer the million
questions I had and directed me to others
who could answer the ones he could not. He
valued my intellectual development. The ex
perience for me, and every other student at
Stanford is formative: a good adviser can
open doors to other interesting professors
and direct a student's interests. A had adviser
can instill disillusionment in a freshman even
before Fall Quarter classes have started. Stu
dents take these interactions seriously, but it
is clear from the highly variable quality and
low participation rate that some faculty do
not.
Many faculty members seem content to let
Undergraduate Advising and Research
(UAR) handle the workload. I A R. I am sure,
is under significant strain as it is a "soft" area
that is easy to get cut. Professional stall
should certainly play a role, but in the end
they can only facilitate interaction with facul
ty and cannot replace one-on-one interaction
with scholars.
What I am asking, faculty, is to not let the
situation get worse.as it very well could. Your
salaries have not been cut. Faculty has not.
nor will they be. laid off. Your |obs are not in
danger. We recognize that decreasing re
search budgets and fewer graduate students

arc a problem, hut research and teaching at
Stanford will continue.
What I am asking for is an increase in fac
ulty participation in the pre-major advising
program, and even more importantly, for pro
fessors not to take this lightly. If every tenure
track faculty member participated, each
freshman could have his or her own adviser.
While the faculty participation rate has not
been publicized in recent years. Faculty Sen
ate minutes from years past indicate it is
about 10 percent. One in 10. Anecdotal evi
dence based on adviser-student ratios for cur
rent students indicates it is about the same.
Students have had their freshman-year advis
er be health care personnel. Graduate School
of Business administrators and other people
essentially unrelated to undergraduate edu
cation. While those people might be great ad
visers. it speaks to the dearth of tenure-track
faculty.
If more faculty participate, it will benefit
faculty fewer advisees per professor, mak
ing the program more attractive overall —
meaning each student would have an adviser
close to the interests listed on each person's
Approaching Stanford forms.
So this is my appeal to you: in an era of
budget cuts.it is up to you. the faculty of Stan
ford I Iniversity, to preserve and maybe even
improve the quality of advising at Stanford.
You will find that students are better pre
pared to work with major advisers, who many
of you are. seriously. You should participate,
but even more importantly, value the oppor
tunity to shape and hone a young, bright
mind.

Stuart liainiel is currently devising plans so that
eat h student has personal assistants, along with
personal faculty advisers. Join the planning at
