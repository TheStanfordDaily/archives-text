### NATE ADAMS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's basketball team
managed to cruise past the Oregon Ducks
after a rough start Saturday night, ultimately
winning by a comfortable 68-49 margin.
Freshman Nnemkadi Ogwumike led the
Cardinal with 13 points, while fellow class
mate Sarah Boothe and sophomore Jeanette
Pohlen each added 11 of their own. With the
win. Stanford remains tied with California
atop the Pacific-10 Conference as it heads
into its final road trip of the regular season.
Oregon (9-17. 5-10 Pac-10) started off
strong, with five different players scoring in
the first seven minutes of the game as the
Ducks opened up an early six-point lead.
During this stretch, the No. 4 Cardinal (22-4.
13-1) shot only 3-for-10 from the field and
gave up three sloppy turnovers.
"We didn't have anything going at the be
ginning of the game," said Stanford head
coach TaraVanDerveer."lt was disappointing
to see lack of focus and lack of effort."
Less than seven minutes into the game,
with her team trailing 12-6, Van Derveer de
cided to take action, simultaneously subbing
out all five of her starters. Three of the players
she put in to replace them — Ogwumike.
Boothe and Lindy La Rocque — were fresh
men. each averaging under 20 minutes per
game. It was the only time VanDerveer could
recall having ever replaced her entire starting
crew at once.
"When the game started, it had a slow feel
to it." she recalled. "When we had that time
out. 1 told them, 'We just need a change. We
need more energy and more people working
hard defensively.'"
A set of fresh legs — all 10 of them — cer
tainly made the difference. Following that
timeout, the Cardinal went on a 25-0 run.the
first 20 of those points coming from freshmen.
Boothe and Ogwumike went back and forth
scoring field goals for a full seven minutes,
driving the score to 19-12 and going 6-for-8 in
the process. Ogwumike had an impressive
five of her six total rebounds during that
stretch, and she and Boothe each went on to
score a game-leading nine points in the half.
"I was pleased with how Sarah and Nneka,
and all our young players, came in gave us a
great spark in first half, and really continued
to play hard." VanDerveer said. "It was great
to see all the contributions. They're talented
players and they took the opportunity. If I
could've decided things, I would've had the
starting players take care of that, but some
times you have to make some changes."
After clearly displaying its depth of talent,
the Cardinal continued to play well as Van-
Derveer mixed her regulars in one by one.
Pohlen in particular stood out among the
non-freshman contributors in the first half,
scoring a momentum-stealing three-pointer
