## Third time without the charm Card drops third straight at Oregon 
### DENIS GRIFFIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Just when you thought it couldn't
get any worse for the Stanford men's
basketball team, it did. On Saturday,
the Cardinal authored a fitting fol
low-up to a pair of gut-wrenching de
feats at Cal and Oregon State when it
handed the Oregon men their first
Pacific-10 Conference win of the sea
son. 68-60. The win was the Ducks'
first victory since a contest against
Long Beach State on Dec. 29. snap
ping a 14-game losing streak.
The loss marked the third consec
utive defeat for the Cardinal (15-10.
4-10 Pac-10) and has to be consid
ered the low-point in a season that
has now had plenty of them. On Feb.

after leading by more than 20 points
in the first half. The team followed
that up with a Thursday game against
the Beavers in which the Cardinal
scored just 17 points in the first half.
And now. the Stanford men have
lost to a Ducks squad that came into
the game at 6-20 overall on the sea
son and 0-14 in the Pac-10.
Had the Ducks lost to the Cardi
nal. they would have been just the
second team ever to start the season
off at 0-15 in the Pac-10 since the
conference went to its current. 18-
game schedule in 1978-1979.
"We grew tonight as a team, we
made plays we haven't been mak
ing." Oregon's Joevan Catron told
the Associated Press after the game.
"Those were some of the worst eight
weeks of my life, and to fight through
it just shows what this team has and
the fight we're going to have down
the line."

each reached double-digit point to
tals in the loss, with tallies of 19, 18
and 16. respectively. But Oregon's
defense flummoxed the rest of the
Cardinal attack, as freshman Jack
Trotter (two points) and senior
Mitch Johnson (five points) were the
only other Stanford players to score
in the game.
The Ducks, meanwhile, made
good use of a more balanced attack.
While Oregon also featured three
players in double digits offensively,

GAME NOTES: Stanford dropped its third
consecutive Pac-10 loss on Saturday, falling
to 4 -10 in the conference, and giving the
Ducks their first Pac-10 win. Stanford looks
for the ultimate rebound against No. 20
UCLA, but struggled last time against the
Bruins, losing 97-63 on Jan. 31.

was led by center Michael Dunigan's
14 points and eight rebounds.
"We know that they play hard for
40 minutes," Stanford head coach
Johnny Dawkins told the San Jose
Mercury News. "They've done that
even though their record doesn't re
flect that. They never quit. We
watched enough tape on them, and
talked to our guys, so we knew what
type of team we'd face from the
standpoint that they are going to play
hard."
But it was in ball security that the
Ducks truly made their dent in the
Cardinal's hopes. While Stanford
players turned the ball over 12 times,
Oregon turned it over only eight
times. Thus, the Ducks were able to
attempt five more shots on the night,
a margin that was largely responsible
for their victory.
The game was tightly contested at
both the start and finish of the first
half, but in keeping with a recent
theme for the Cardinal, there was a
point at which Stanford seemed
close to pulling away. With nine min
utes remaining in the half, a three
pointer from Goods and a basket
each from Johnson, Fields and Mill
had helped put the Cardinal on top.
