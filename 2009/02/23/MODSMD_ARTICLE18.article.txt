In case you missed it — and odds

basebnll team opened its 2(X)9
season this past weekend with a
three game series against Vanderbilt.
The results? Not perfect.but all in all,
a series victory against one of the na

sult the Cardinal will gladly accept.
And so should its fans.
Hie season opening series for
Stanford featured a solid turnout,
but for the most part one didn't get
the sense that it was students filling
the stands. And I. for one, have no
idea why that is.
I'll be the first to admit: I certain
ly wish collegiate baseball were
played with wooden bats — it would
add an additional bit of aesthetic ap
peal to the game and give the casual
fan a better grasp of the statistics
without needing to stop and think as
much about the inherent differences
between the college and professional
games.
But. that said, there's still an awful
lot to like out at the Sunken Dia

gorgeous field and progressing on to

successful athletic programs. Both of
those were on display this weekend
as the Cardinal pulled no punches in
opening its season against one of the
SEC's best.
Vanderbilt has produced top
MLB Draft picks David Price (a
southpaw drafted first overall by the
Tampa Bay Rays in 2007) and Pedro
Alvarez (a third baseman drafted
second overall by the Pittsburgh Pi
rates in 2008) in recent years, and
from the looks of its freshman class,
elite talent is still flocking to
Nashville.Tenn. On Friday, the Com
modores had one of the nation's top
pitching prospects on the mound in
lefty Mike Minor. In short, overcom
ing the kind of talent Vandy was able
to throw on the field was no small
feat, even for the No. 5 Cardinal.
"We want to see where we are,
and you can only do that by playing
against the best teams in the country,
and Vanderbilt is certainly one of
those teams," said junior starter Jeff
Inman.
There was certainly a buzz in the
air as Stanford opened its season,
and only part of that was for the cal
iber of opponent it faced.The Cardi
nal finished last year in Omaha. Neb.
at the College World Series, tied for
third in the nation behind only Geor
gia and eventual champion Fresno
State.

A series victory.Js a
result the Cardinal
will gladly accept.
And so should fans.

But the buzz wasn't to see the
Cardinal team that was, either. At
least not entirely. Many of the stars
who drove the Cardinal deep into
the postseason, like catcher Jason
Castro, centerfielder Sean Ratliff.
second baseman Cord Phelps, first
baseman and designated hitter
Randy Molina and starter Erik
Davis, had moved on to the profes
sional leagues.
No. the real reason the weekend
series was a must-see was to size up
the Cardinal's chances at defending
its status as one of the country's pre
mier programs this year.
And the verdict? Quite positive.
While last year the Cardinal was
propelled by power up and down the
lineup, the game plan will need to be
different this year. Perhaps the heart
of the team's offense is its outfield,
where seniors Joey August and Jeff

Whitlow manned the corners, and
junior Toby Gerhart has shifted to
center and looked quite capable to
start the season. It's a speedy trio
that should be able to cover a lot of
ground and to help make the Cardi
nal pitching staff look good.
Gerhart and senior Brent
Milleville will be relied upon to pro
vide the power for the Cardinal. A
pair of sophomores, meanwhile, will
need to take the next step in order
for Stanford's offense to truly thrive.
Shortstop Jake Schlander, who saw
plenty of playing time largely for his
defense last season, could become
even more of an asset if he develops
offensively, becoming more of a
complete player. Meanwhile, third
baseman and backup catcher Zach
Jones has moved to the leadoff spot,
taking over for Phelps.
In terms of pitching, the Cardinal
looks to have a solid rotation on
paper, but it is in the bullpen where it
could truly shine. Sophomore closer
Drew Storen has already established
himself as one of the Pac-10's most
talented arms, and if Friday's three
innings from Jason Pries are any in
dication, there are more young arms
backing him up.
So as the 2009 season opens, it's
time to greet the new Cardinal, not
quite the same as, but possibly just as
good as, the old Cardinal. Just in a
different way. The only question is
why you're not paying attention.
