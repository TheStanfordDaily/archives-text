In case you missed it — and odds
are you did — the Stanford
basebnll team opened its 2(X)9
season this past weekend with a
three game series against Vanderbilt.
The results? Not perfect.but all in all,
a series victory against one of the na
tion's new marquis programs is a re
sult the Cardinal will gladly accept.
And so should its fans.
Hie season opening series for
Stanford featured a solid turnout,
but for the most part one didn't get
the sense that it was students filling
the stands. And I. for one, have no
idea why that is.
I'll be the first to admit: I certain
ly wish collegiate baseball were
played with wooden bats — it would
add an additional bit of aesthetic ap
peal to the game and give the casual
fan a better grasp of the statistics
without needing to stop and think as
much about the inherent differences
between the college and professional
games.
But. that said, there's still an awful
lot to like out at the Sunken Dia
mond. starting with an absolutely
gorgeous field and progressing on to
one of Stanford's most consistently
