### DENIS GRIFFIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Hie No. 5 Stanford baseball team came out
of its soggy opening weekend successfully, tak
ing two out of three from Vanderbilt before a
game scheduled for Sunday against IJC-River
side was rained out.'llie Cardinal showed plen
ty of heart throughout the weekend.staging late

rallies in all three games.
On Friday and Saturday, Stanford came out
strong, taking its season opener with a 6-5 extra
innings victory over the Commodores,and won
again 6-5 in the series' final game to earn the se
ries victory.
Friday night's home opener featured a
matchup of top-tier collegiate pitchers, as Stan
ford junior Jeff Inman went up against Vander

bilt lefty Mike Minor. Both of the pitchers were
named to the preseason watch-list for the Gold
en Spikes Award, which annually honors the
best player in college baseball.
Minor was tough on the Cardinal early,
keeping Stanford off the board through the first
three innings of play. Minor appeared to be in
fine form to start the season, showing off a live
arm as his fastballs popped loudly into the

catcher's mitt.
"Minor was good," Stanford coach Mark
Marquess said. "Thank Clod we got him out of
there. He was tough."
Inman. meanwhile, ran into trouble early, as
Vanderbilt scored a pair of runs on three hits in
the second inning and three runs on four hits in
the third to take a 5-0 lead. But the Stanford
junior, who went 7-2 last season with a 4.27
ERA, settled down, allowing no runs and just
one hit over the next four innings of play. A key
part of Inman's success was his ability to keep
the ball down, inducing the Commodores to
ground out eight times, compared to just two
fly-outs over that span.
"I was very pleased with Inman; 1 thought he
did a real nice job of coming back." Marquess
said."! le started off a little shaky then gave us
three or four shutout innings after they scored
the five on him. And then Prios... that's a great
performance for a freshman "
"My control was there the whole time,"
Inman said."l was making them put it in play,
but I think later in the game I was starting to hit
my spots a little better."
Meanwhile, the Cardinal offense was mak-
