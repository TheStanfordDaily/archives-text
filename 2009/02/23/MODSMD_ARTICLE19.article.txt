# Baseball rallies to win Vandy series

### DENIS GRIFFIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Hie No. 5 Stanford baseball team came out
of its soggy opening weekend successfully, tak
ing two out of three from Vanderbilt before a
game scheduled for Sunday against IJC-River
side was rained out.'llie Cardinal showed plen
ty of heart throughout the weekend.staging late

rallies in all three games.
On Friday and Saturday, Stanford came out
strong, taking its season opener with a 6-5 extra
innings victory over the Commodores,and won
again 6-5 in the series' final game to earn the se
ries victory.
Friday night's home opener featured a
matchup of top-tier collegiate pitchers, as Stan
ford junior Jeff Inman went up against Vander

bilt lefty Mike Minor. Both of the pitchers were
named to the preseason watch-list for the Gold
en Spikes Award, which annually honors the
best player in college baseball.
Minor was tough on the Cardinal early,
keeping Stanford off the board through the first
three innings of play. Minor appeared to be in
fine form to start the season, showing off a live
arm as his fastballs popped loudly into the

catcher's mitt.
"Minor was good," Stanford coach Mark
Marquess said. "Thank Clod we got him out of
there. He was tough."
Inman. meanwhile, ran into trouble early, as
Vanderbilt scored a pair of runs on three hits in
the second inning and three runs on four hits in
the third to take a 5-0 lead. But the Stanford
junior, who went 7-2 last season with a 4.27
ERA, settled down, allowing no runs and just
one hit over the next four innings of play. A key
part of Inman's success was his ability to keep
the ball down, inducing the Commodores to
ground out eight times, compared to just two
fly-outs over that span.
"I was very pleased with Inman; 1 thought he
did a real nice job of coming back." Marquess
said."! le started off a little shaky then gave us
three or four shutout innings after they scored
the five on him. And then Prios... that's a great
performance for a freshman "
"My control was there the whole time,"
Inman said."l was making them put it in play,
but I think later in the game I was starting to hit
my spots a little better."

GAME NOTES: Stanford opened the season by taking two
of three games in its weekend series against Vanderbilt.
In all three outings, the Cardinal offense rallied to score

unearned run in the fourth when sen
ior first baseman Brent Milleville sin
gled to lead off the inning and ad
vanced home on two consecutive
two-out fielding errors by the Com
modores.
In the sixth. Stanford closed the
rest of the gap on three hits and three
walks. Sophomore third baseman
Zach Jones and senior left-fielder
Joey August each singled in a pair of
runs with two outs to tie the game at
5-5.
In the eighth inning, freshman
Jason Pries got his first dose of colle
giate action as he came on in relief of
Inman. The right-hander from
Alameda impressed in his debut, col
lecting his first strikeout in the eighth
inning and held the Commodores
scoreless through three innings.
"I had no idea what to expect,"
Pries said, 'i was just trying to go out
there, throw strikes, pitch by pitch
just do what I've done all my life, all
my career."
Small ball won the game for the
Cardinal in the 10th inning, as sopho
more shortstop Jake Schlander drew
a leadoff walk and sophomore second
baseman Colin Walsh hunted him
over to second and Jones' fly-out to

center got him to third. Junior Toby
Gerhart then came through with the
game-winning RBI. lining a two-out
single to right center field for Stan
ford's first win of the season.
The Cardinal's second game of the
season did not go quite so smoothly,
as sophomore starting pitcher Dan
Sandbrink gave up three runs
through the first 3.1 innings. ITie
Commodores ran their way to a pair
of runs in the third, turning a pair of
singles, a walk and three stolen bases
into a 2-0 lead. Sandbrink got out of
the inning without allowing any more
runs, but was pulled after giving up a
one-out double in the fourth.
But this time around. Stanford's
bullpen was able to offer the team no
relief from the Vandy onslaught.
Freshman leftv Scott Snodgrass gave
up a double for an RBI, a single, hit a
batter, and then another fielder's
choice RBI put the Commodores on
top 4-0. The fifth inning proved even
worse for Snodgrass, as the freshman
gave up a grand slam without getting
a single out in the inning. Vanderbilt
would go on to take a 12-1 lead by the
middle of the seventh, and even a fu
rious, seven-run eighth inning from
the Cardinal bats was not enough for
a Stanford comeback as the Com
modores won. 12- 1 ).
The second game of Saturday's
double-header, though, proved more
to Stanford's liking. Sophomore clos
er Drew Storen got the win in his first
appearance of the season, throwing

the final 2.2 innings for the Cardinal.
Olfensively, a three-run rally in the
eighth pushed the Cardinal over the
top as Walsh doubled to collect two
RBI and the Cardinal's third run
scored on an error by the Vanderbilt
centerfielder on the play. After a per
fect ninth in which Storen struck out
two. Stanford had its second 6-5 win

of the series.
Next up for the Cardinal is a road
series at Cal State-Fullerton starting
this Friday. Stanford will then return
home to take on St. Mary's on
March 3.

Hie No. 5 Stanford baseball team came out
of its soggy opening weekend successfully, tak
ing two out of three from Vanderbilt before a
game scheduled for Sunday against IJC-River
side was rained out.'llie Cardinal showed plen
ty of heart throughout the weekend.staging late

rallies in all three games.
On Friday and Saturday, Stanford came out
strong, taking its season opener with a 6-5 extra
innings victory over the Commodores,and won
again 6-5 in the series' final game to earn the se
ries victory.
Friday night's home opener featured a
matchup of top-tier collegiate pitchers, as Stan
ford junior Jeff Inman went up against Vander

bilt lefty Mike Minor. Both of the pitchers were
named to the preseason watch-list for the Gold
en Spikes Award, which annually honors the
best player in college baseball.
Minor was tough on the Cardinal early,
keeping Stanford off the board through the first
three innings of play. Minor appeared to be in
fine form to start the season, showing off a live
arm as his fastballs popped loudly into the

catcher's mitt.
"Minor was good," Stanford coach Mark
Marquess said. "Thank Clod we got him out of
there. He was tough."
Inman. meanwhile, ran into trouble early, as
Vanderbilt scored a pair of runs on three hits in
the second inning and three runs on four hits in
the third to take a 5-0 lead. But the Stanford
junior, who went 7-2 last season with a 4.27
ERA, settled down, allowing no runs and just
one hit over the next four innings of play. A key
part of Inman's success was his ability to keep
the ball down, inducing the Commodores to
ground out eight times, compared to just two
fly-outs over that span.
"I was very pleased with Inman; 1 thought he
did a real nice job of coming back." Marquess
said."! le started off a little shaky then gave us
three or four shutout innings after they scored
the five on him. And then Prios... that's a great
performance for a freshman "
"My control was there the whole time,"
Inman said."l was making them put it in play,
but I think later in the game I was starting to hit
my spots a little better."
Meanwhile, the Cardinal offense was mak-

ing up ground on Vandy. scoring one
unearned run in the fourth when sen
ior first baseman Brent Milleville sin
gled to lead off the inning and ad
vanced home on two consecutive
two-out fielding errors by the Com
modores.
In the sixth. Stanford closed the
rest of the gap on three hits and three
walks. Sophomore third baseman
Zach Jones and senior left-fielder
Joey August each singled in a pair of
runs with two outs to tie the game at
5-5.
In the eighth inning, freshman
Jason Pries got his first dose of colle
giate action as he came on in relief of
Inman. The right-hander from
Alameda impressed in his debut, col
lecting his first strikeout in the eighth
inning and held the Commodores
scoreless through three innings.
"I had no idea what to expect,"
Pries said, 'i was just trying to go out
there, throw strikes, pitch by pitch
just do what I've done all my life, all
my career."
Small ball won the game for the
Cardinal in the 10th inning, as sopho
more shortstop Jake Schlander drew
a leadoff walk and sophomore second
baseman Colin Walsh hunted him
over to second and Jones' fly-out to

center got him to third. Junior Toby
Gerhart then came through with the
game-winning RBI. lining a two-out
single to right center field for Stan
ford's first win of the season.
The Cardinal's second game of the
season did not go quite so smoothly,
as sophomore starting pitcher Dan
Sandbrink gave up three runs
through the first 3.1 innings. ITie
Commodores ran their way to a pair
of runs in the third, turning a pair of
singles, a walk and three stolen bases
into a 2-0 lead. Sandbrink got out of
the inning without allowing any more
runs, but was pulled after giving up a
one-out double in the fourth.
But this time around. Stanford's
bullpen was able to offer the team no
relief from the Vandy onslaught.
Freshman leftv Scott Snodgrass gave
up a double for an RBI, a single, hit a
batter, and then another fielder's
choice RBI put the Commodores on
top 4-0. The fifth inning proved even
worse for Snodgrass, as the freshman
gave up a grand slam without getting
a single out in the inning. Vanderbilt
would go on to take a 12-1 lead by the
middle of the seventh, and even a fu
rious, seven-run eighth inning from
the Cardinal bats was not enough for
a Stanford comeback as the Com
modores won. 12- 1 ).
The second game of Saturday's
double-header, though, proved more
to Stanford's liking. Sophomore clos
er Drew Storen got the win in his first
appearance of the season, throwing

the final 2.2 innings for the Cardinal.
Olfensively, a three-run rally in the
