# RICE RETURNS
## Former Secretary of State officially starts March 2 at Hoover 
### KAMIL DADA ANDREA FULLER 
Condoleezza Rice will formally return to
Stanford on March 2, said her chief of staff, Colby
Cooper. Rice has been settling into her Hoover
Institution office in recent weeks, and her staff
arrived on campus Dec. 15 to prepare for her
return.
The former Secretary of State will not immedi
ately return to teaching but has publicly stated she
expects to work on a book and eventually return to
the classroom. She will also participate in Hoover
task forces dealing with issues including national
security, according to Hoover Senior Associate
Director Richard Sousa.
Stanford administrators and some of Rice's old
est friends applaud her renewed relationship with
the University, though others who oppose Bush
administration policies or clashed with her as
provost are less enthusiastic.
"Prof. Rice's return to Stanford will provide our
students and the academic community with a great
opportunity to learn from her experience in public
service and international affairs," University
President John Hennessy told The Daily in a state
ment. "We are proud and pleased that she has cho
sen to return to her faculty appointment and to pur
sue her future teaching and research interests here."
Future as a Political Science Professor
While Rice will not immediately return to the
classroom, a number of professors look forward to
her interactions with students.
Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at Hoover,
believes Rice has a lot to contribute in terms of fos
tering policy debate, providing analysis and engag
ing students.
"Many people will want to find ways to discuss
and evaluate her role as Secretary of State and. pre
vious to that, as National Security Advisor, in an
extremely controversial period and one in which
the United States did things that were very trou
bling. frankly," Diamond said.
When Rice will resume teaching, however, is still
unclear.

has known her for close to 30 years
through teaching and writing
together. He suggested that the for
mer Secretary of State would need
some time to decompress.
"She is at a point in her career
where she can define her relation
ship with Stanford." Blacker said.
"She's been on a professional tread
mill that most people would find
utterly exhausting for the last 15
years. So it's really up to her to
define the nature of her relationship
with the University going forward.
She's just trying to catch her breath
now. 1 don't think she's thought very
hard about it."
Chair of the Political Science
Department James Fearon said he
had not spoken to Rice personally
about teaching, but added that Rice
would be able to return to teaching
should she wish to. He said that if
she resumed her role as an active

faculty member in the department,
she will have teaching obligations, as
all faculty do.
Blacker explained that it was dif
ficult for him to think of Rice on
campus for any period of time with
out going back to the classroom.
"She considers Stanford her
home," he said. "1 don't think she
would ever leave Stanford in that
sense. I don't think she would ever
resign her professorship. She loves
this institution."
Blacker added, however, that
Rice has always been a bit restless.
"If there is a really interesting
challenge that comes her way. I have
no doubt that she would seize that
opportunity, as long as she can take
another leave of absence from
Stanford." he said.
Enthusiasm tor Her Return
Though Rice has made enemies
in the political sphere, the professor
has many friends and supporters on
campus, particularly at Hoover.
George Shultz, former Secretary
of State under President Reagan
and distinguished fellow at Hoover,

"Why she didn't extricate herself [from the
Bush administration], I can't understand.
She compromised her integrity in ways that
will make it hard for her to be trusted."
— CHARLES DREKMEIER,
political science professor emeritus

was pleased to hear of her return to
campus and is looking forward to
interacting with another high-level
policy-maker.
"She's a gifted person — intellec
tually. musically and in terms ol
capacity of friendship and good con
versation." he said.
Political Science Prof. Stephen
Krasner arrived at Stanford the

same year that Rice did (1981) and
is glad to see her return. He
explained that over the years, the
two spent a lot of time together,
sharing similar interests in every
thing from political theory to tennis.
"She's a good tennis player; she
hits the hall hard," Krasner joked.
Krasner went on to work for the
National Security Council and then
reported directly to Rice as director
of policy planning at the State
Department. He believes Rice was
successful in her time as Secretary of
State.
"She was very proactive about
linking the U.S. with the Europeans
in terms of negotiating with Iran."
he said. "She was very committed to
the Six Points talks with North
Korea."
Thinking back to their time
together in Washington. Krasner
pointed out that Rice was an excel
lent athlete and musician. He noted
that Rice played the piano regularly
with a small group of musicians in
Washington and was very talented.
"As Secretary of State, she decid
ed to take up golf." he said. "She
actually got to be a decent golf play
er. which is not something you expect
given the demands of the job."
He added that Rice had an active
social calendar in Washington, mak
ing time for her friends despite her
near around-the-clock schedule.
"She's kept her friends through
all her stages of her life." he said.
"The people that she knew when
she came to Stanford, when just a
research scholar in 1981 — many of
those people are people she's still
friendly with."
Opposition to Rice
But Rice's return will not be cel
ebrated by all. She made a number
of enemies during her tenure as
provost, and some of those wounds
have yet to heal a decade later. Her
role in the controversial administra
tion of President George W. Bush
has only exacerbated feelings of ill
will among some professors.
Few of her objectors deny Rice's
right to return as a tenured profes
sor. but some are dismayed with her
choice to come back.
Political Science Prof. Emeritus
Hubert Marshall said that, although
he personally liked Rice, he believes
professors should not mix policy
making with teaching because it
precludes objectivity. Rice's case, he
said, was exacerbated by her
involvement in the controversial
Iraq War and accusations that the
Bush administration endorsed tor
ture and the denial of habeas corpus

"Professor Rice's return to Stanford will
provide our students and the academic
community with a great opportunity to
learn from her experience in public service
and international affairs."
— JOHN HENNESSY,
University President

in Guantanamo Bay.
"People who've been working
at Washington at that level are
going to be preoccupied with their
place in history," Marshall said.
"Almost all of them write books
and almost all of their books are
defensive. I've never known the
highest-level person to say. 'Well. I
was wrong.'"
"I know that nobody who teach
es in the social sciences is absolutely
objective, but 1 do think that the
rank and file of those people who
teach in the social sciences really
make an effort to be objective," he
added. "People who have really
been policy-makers just really can't
meet that test."
Political Science Prof. Emeritus
Charles Drekmeier similarly
believed Rice's image had been
compromised by her time in
Washington, though he admitted she
has the right to be at Stanford.
"Why she didn't extricate herself
[from the Bush administration) I
can't understand." Drekmeier said.
"She compromised her integrity in
ways that will make it hard for her
to be trusted ... There is no ques
tion that she colluded in the denial
of the use of instruments of torture."
Even though Rice has the right
to return. Political Science Prof.
Emeritus John Manley said students

and faculty should not keep their
objections quiet.
"The fact that she's tenured and
that the administration would wel
come her back is no reason for peo
ple at Stanford who object to her
return to stifle themselves." he said.
"People have a right to speak out
whether she's tenured or not."
"I cannot think of Condi as my
former colleague without her hands
stained by the blood of over 4.000
American soldiers and untold num
bers of Iraqis" Manley added.
Blacker, however, emphasized
that he hoped the Stanford commu
nity would give Rice time to read
just. He said that regardless of what
one thinks of the policies and the
conduct of the Bush administration,
the mental, emotional and physical
demands that were placed on the
former Secretary of State were
extreme.
"I hope people will suspend judg
ment about what Condi's return
means until Secretary Rice has time
to figure out what her return
means." he said.
The Daily is scheduled for an exclu
sive interview with Rice next week.

mill that most people would find
utterly exhausting for the last 15
years. So it's really up to her to
define the nature of her relationship
with the University going forward.
She's just trying to catch her breath
now. 1 don't think she's thought very
hard about it."
Chair of the Political Science
Department James Fearon said he
had not spoken to Rice personally
about teaching, but added that Rice
would be able to return to teaching
should she wish to. He said that if
she resumed her role as an active

faculty member in the department,
she will have teaching obligations, as
all faculty do.
Blacker explained that it was dif
ficult for him to think of Rice on
campus for any period of time with
out going back to the classroom.
"She considers Stanford her
home," he said. "1 don't think she
would ever leave Stanford in that
sense. I don't think she would ever
resign her professorship. She loves
this institution."
Blacker added, however, that
Rice has always been a bit restless.
"If there is a really interesting
challenge that comes her way. I have
no doubt that she would seize that
opportunity, as long as she can take
another leave of absence from
Stanford." he said.
Enthusiasm tor Her Return
Though Rice has made enemies
in the political sphere, the professor
has many friends and supporters on
campus, particularly at Hoover.
George Shultz, former Secretary
of State under President Reagan
and distinguished fellow at Hoover,

"Why she didn't extricate herself [from the
Bush administration], I can't understand.
She compromised her integrity in ways that
will make it hard for her to be trusted."
— CHARLES DREKMEIER,
political science professor emeritus

was pleased to hear of her return to
campus and is looking forward to
interacting with another high-level
policy-maker.
"She's a gifted person — intellec
tually. musically and in terms ol
capacity of friendship and good con
versation." he said.
Political Science Prof. Stephen
Krasner arrived at Stanford the

same year that Rice did (1981) and
is glad to see her return. He
explained that over the years, the
two spent a lot of time together,
sharing similar interests in every
thing from political theory to tennis.
"She's a good tennis player; she
hits the hall hard," Krasner joked.
Krasner went on to work for the
National Security Council and then
reported directly to Rice as director
of policy planning at the State
Department. He believes Rice was
successful in her time as Secretary of
State.
"She was very proactive about
linking the U.S. with the Europeans
in terms of negotiating with Iran."
he said. "She was very committed to
the Six Points talks with North
Korea."
Thinking back to their time
together in Washington. Krasner
pointed out that Rice was an excel
lent athlete and musician. He noted
that Rice played the piano regularly
with a small group of musicians in
Washington and was very talented.
"As Secretary of State, she decid
ed to take up golf." he said. "She
actually got to be a decent golf play
er. which is not something you expect
given the demands of the job."
He added that Rice had an active
social calendar in Washington, mak
ing time for her friends despite her
near around-the-clock schedule.
"She's kept her friends through
all her stages of her life." he said.
"The people that she knew when
she came to Stanford, when just a
research scholar in 1981 — many of
those people are people she's still
friendly with."
Opposition to Rice
But Rice's return will not be cel
ebrated by all. She made a number
of enemies during her tenure as
provost, and some of those wounds
have yet to heal a decade later. Her
role in the controversial administra
tion of President George W. Bush
has only exacerbated feelings of ill
will among some professors.
Few of her objectors deny Rice's
right to return as a tenured profes
sor. but some are dismayed with her
choice to come back.
Political Science Prof. Emeritus
Hubert Marshall said that, although
he personally liked Rice, he believes
professors should not mix policy
making with teaching because it
precludes objectivity. Rice's case, he
said, was exacerbated by her
involvement in the controversial
Iraq War and accusations that the
Bush administration endorsed tor
ture and the denial of habeas corpus

"Professor Rice's return to Stanford will
provide our students and the academic
community with a great opportunity to
learn from her experience in public service
and international affairs."
— JOHN HENNESSY,
University President

in Guantanamo Bay.
"People who've been working
at Washington at that level are
going to be preoccupied with their
place in history," Marshall said.
"Almost all of them write books
and almost all of their books are
defensive. I've never known the
highest-level person to say. 'Well. I
was wrong.'"
"I know that nobody who teach
es in the social sciences is absolutely
objective, but 1 do think that the
rank and file of those people who
teach in the social sciences really
make an effort to be objective," he
added. "People who have really
been policy-makers just really can't
meet that test."
Political Science Prof. Emeritus
Charles Drekmeier similarly
believed Rice's image had been
compromised by her time in
Washington, though he admitted she
has the right to be at Stanford.
"Why she didn't extricate herself
[from the Bush administration) I
can't understand." Drekmeier said.
"She compromised her integrity in
ways that will make it hard for her
to be trusted ... There is no ques
tion that she colluded in the denial
of the use of instruments of torture."
Even though Rice has the right
to return. Political Science Prof.
Emeritus John Manley said students

and faculty should not keep their
objections quiet.
"The fact that she's tenured and
that the administration would wel
come her back is no reason for peo
ple at Stanford who object to her
return to stifle themselves." he said.
"People have a right to speak out
whether she's tenured or not."
"I cannot think of Condi as my
former colleague without her hands
stained by the blood of over 4.000
American soldiers and untold num
bers of Iraqis" Manley added.
Blacker, however, emphasized
that he hoped the Stanford commu
nity would give Rice time to read
just. He said that regardless of what
one thinks of the policies and the
conduct of the Bush administration,
the mental, emotional and physical
demands that were placed on the
former Secretary of State were
extreme.
"I hope people will suspend judg
ment about what Condi's return
means until Secretary Rice has time
to figure out what her return
means." he said.
The Daily is scheduled for an exclu
sive interview with Rice next week.

early morning hours of May 29, 1998. Rice spoke with protestors who called
for graduate housing reform, decrying the lack of affordable options. Rice
would champion the increase in graduate housing funds to the Faculty Senate.
Condoleezza Rice will formally return to
Stanford on March 2, said her chief of staff, Colby
Cooper. Rice has been settling into her Hoover
Institution office in recent weeks, and her staff
arrived on campus Dec. 15 to prepare for her
return.
The former Secretary of State will not immedi
ately return to teaching but has publicly stated she
expects to work on a book and eventually return to
the classroom. She will also participate in Hoover
task forces dealing with issues including national
security, according to Hoover Senior Associate
Director Richard Sousa.
Stanford administrators and some of Rice's old
est friends applaud her renewed relationship with
the University, though others who oppose Bush
administration policies or clashed with her as
provost are less enthusiastic.
"Prof. Rice's return to Stanford will provide our
students and the academic community with a great
opportunity to learn from her experience in public
service and international affairs," University
President John Hennessy told The Daily in a state
ment. "We are proud and pleased that she has cho
sen to return to her faculty appointment and to pur
sue her future teaching and research interests here."
Future as a Political Science Professor
While Rice will not immediately return to the
classroom, a number of professors look forward to
her interactions with students.
Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at Hoover,
believes Rice has a lot to contribute in terms of fos
tering policy debate, providing analysis and engag
ing students.
"Many people will want to find ways to discuss
and evaluate her role as Secretary of State and. pre
vious to that, as National Security Advisor, in an
extremely controversial period and one in which
the United States did things that were very trou
bling. frankly," Diamond said.
When Rice will resume teaching, however, is still
unclear.
