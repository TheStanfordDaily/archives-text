Condoleezza Rice will formally return to
Stanford on March 2, said her chief of staff, Colby
Cooper. Rice has been settling into her Hoover
Institution office in recent weeks, and her staff
arrived on campus Dec. 15 to prepare for her
return.
The former Secretary of State will not immedi
ately return to teaching but has publicly stated she
expects to work on a book and eventually return to
the classroom. She will also participate in Hoover
task forces dealing with issues including national
security, according to Hoover Senior Associate
Director Richard Sousa.
Stanford administrators and some of Rice's old
est friends applaud her renewed relationship with
the University, though others who oppose Bush
administration policies or clashed with her as
provost are less enthusiastic.
"Prof. Rice's return to Stanford will provide our
students and the academic community with a great
opportunity to learn from her experience in public
service and international affairs," University
President John Hennessy told The Daily in a state
ment. "We are proud and pleased that she has cho
sen to return to her faculty appointment and to pur
sue her future teaching and research interests here."
Future as a Political Science Professor
While Rice will not immediately return to the
classroom, a number of professors look forward to
her interactions with students.
Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at Hoover,
believes Rice has a lot to contribute in terms of fos
tering policy debate, providing analysis and engag
ing students.
"Many people will want to find ways to discuss
and evaluate her role as Secretary of State and. pre
vious to that, as National Security Advisor, in an
extremely controversial period and one in which
the United States did things that were very trou
bling. frankly," Diamond said.
When Rice will resume teaching, however, is still
unclear.
