# Few equate Rumsfeld, Rice
## Less outcry on campus over return of Bush's top diplomant 
### ANDREA FULLER KAMIL DADA 
Condoleezza Rice's return to Stanford has been quiet
so far. despite the clamor over George W. Bush's 2006
visit and Donald Rumsfeld's 2007 appointment at the
I loover Institution.
Following Rumsfeld's selection as a Distinguished
Visiting Fellow in fall 2007. faculty and students circulat
ed petitions in opposition. Debate over his appointment
consumed Faculty Senate and ASSIJ meetings. Despite
claims by student activists that Rice was also complicit in
"war crimes." the anti-Rice movement pales in compari
son to that targeting the former Secretary of Defense.
Rice will be taking up a position at Hoover, just as

Rumsfeld did. hut few equate her arrival with his contro
versial appointment. The former Secretary of State, after
all. is a tenured political science professor and a former
Stanford provost.
"(Rice) is returning to a long-established position,
whereas Rumsfeld was appointed to something he had
not held before and in a much more minor role as a dis
tinguished visiting scholar." said senior Hoover Fellow
Larry Diamond. "I also think Rumsfeld's service as
Secretary of Defense was far more ignominious than
Condi Rice's service in either of her positions, where I
think the ultimate record is at least more mixed."
George Shultz. a distinguished fellow at Hoover,
argued that Rice never truly left campus and compared
her return to his own experience coming back to Stanford
after serving as Secretary of State under President
Reagan.
