# Few equate Rumsfeld, Rice
## Less outcry on campus over return of Bush's top diplomant 
### ANDREA FULLER KAMIL DADA 
Condoleezza Rice's return to Stanford has been quiet
so far. despite the clamor over George W. Bush's 2006
visit and Donald Rumsfeld's 2007 appointment at the
I loover Institution.
Following Rumsfeld's selection as a Distinguished
Visiting Fellow in fall 2007. faculty and students circulat
ed petitions in opposition. Debate over his appointment
consumed Faculty Senate and ASSIJ meetings. Despite
claims by student activists that Rice was also complicit in
"war crimes." the anti-Rice movement pales in compari
son to that targeting the former Secretary of Defense.
Rice will be taking up a position at Hoover, just as

Rumsfeld did. hut few equate her arrival with his contro
versial appointment. The former Secretary of State, after
all. is a tenured political science professor and a former
Stanford provost.
"(Rice) is returning to a long-established position,
whereas Rumsfeld was appointed to something he had
not held before and in a much more minor role as a dis
tinguished visiting scholar." said senior Hoover Fellow
Larry Diamond. "I also think Rumsfeld's service as
Secretary of Defense was far more ignominious than
Condi Rice's service in either of her positions, where I
think the ultimate record is at least more mixed."
George Shultz. a distinguished fellow at Hoover,
argued that Rice never truly left campus and compared
her return to his own experience coming back to Stanford
after serving as Secretary of State under President
Reagan.
"I was received warmly." Schultz
said, "but I didn't feel as though 1
was coming back to anything. I felt
as though I never left the
University."
Shultz said he had been involved
with universities continuously ever
since he joined the MIT faculty after
serving as a marine in World War 11.
I le said he never sold his house on
campus and would visit the Farm
regularly.
"It was just continuity and a nat
ural place to come back to: I think
Condi has the same situation," he
said. "She's basically been a univer
sity person for all of her adult life.
She's taken this detour into govern
ment for a while, but she has shown
that she can get back into the swim
very fast."
Rumsfeld, Shultz argued, did not
have the same long-term academic
connection.
"Don had been an overseer at
Hoover, but has never been a uni
versity person." Shultz said. "His
career has been in politics."
Director of the Freeman Spogli
Institute Coit Blacker — who
served as a former special assistant
to President Clinton for National
Security Affairs — believes it would
not be appropriate to apply political
standards to people who go on leave
for public service positions.
"1 am sure there were many peo
ple who were unhappy with some
things that the Clinton administra
tion did. but 1 had taken a leave of
absence, and I think it is appropriate
that when a faculty member does
that, you hold on to that position for
him or her." Blacker said. "That is
just a matter of principle."
He added that there was never
any prospect that Rumsfeld was
going to move to Palo Alto so that
he could be a full-time fellow at
Hoover.
"So his status vis-a-vis Stanford
is completely different from
Secretary Rice's, who is a tenured
member of the political science
department's faculty — kind of
apples and oranges," Blacker said.
A number of professors involved
in the anti-Rumsfeld movement
have also told The Daily that they
do not object to Rice's return to

"Professor Rice has a
distinguished
academic career
behind her. There's
every reason for her
to be here and every
reason to return."
— JOSHUA LANDY,
associate French and
Italian professor

campus, even if they disagree with
her politics.
Humanities Prof. Roh Polhemus
said his objection to Rumsfeld was
largely based on his lack of creden
tials as an academic, a problem that
does not apply to Rice. Polhemus
pushed forward the petition that
called Rumsfeld's appointment
"contemptible."
"She's a full professor who does
have the right to be here," Polhemus
said. "I don't have any objection to
her being here."
"'I know a lot of people don't like
what her role in American history of
the last eight years [was], but that's
a separate issue," he added. "You
don't bump somebody from tenure
[for that]."
Associate French and Italian
Prof. Joshua Landy. another
Rumsfeld objector, agreed that
Rice's return should not be equated
with Rumsfeld's.
"It's a completely different case,"
Landy said. "For one thing, she's
returning to a job that was kept
open for her as opposed to Donald
Rumsfeld having a position created
for him ... Prof. Rice has a distin
guished academic career behind
her. There's every reason for her to
be here and every reason to return."
While students rallied in White

Plaza over Rumsfeld's appointment.
Rice's return has received a more
tepid response from student
activists. No formal coalition has yet
developed to oppose Rice, although
some students consider both her
and Rumsfeld war criminals.
Daniel Murray, a first-year Ph.D.
candidate in Modern Thought and
Literature, said several students in
his program are concerned about
Rice's role in sanctioning torture.
The students are trying to put
together a fall symposium about
torture and accountability, featuring
legal scholars, journalists and others
who study human rights issues.
On Feb. 3, Stanford Amnesty
International (SAI) held a screen
ing of "American Faust: From Condi
to Neo-Condi," a documentary on
Rice that approximately 50 people
attended. Both Murray and SAI co-
President Emma Laughlin '09 said
raising awareness of Rice's potential
human rights violations was a key
goal — a point echoed by Adam
Hudson '10, president of Stanford
Says No to War. who said his group
has no firm plans yet, but eventually
hopes to work with other organiza
tions in opposing Rice.
"[SAI members are] very flab
bergasted that she would be coming
back and that there's not massive
protest going on," Laughlin said.
"I'm certainly in favor of academic
freedom, and people can talk about
whether or not torture works, but
that's a lot different than actually
going out and doing it."
Students like Laughlin deem
Rice a "war criminal" for her
alleged sanction of torture and her
push for war in Iraq. Laughlin said
she knew one alumnus who met
people in Europe who nicknamed
Stanford "War Crimes University,"
based on its affiliation with Rice and
Rumsfeld.
The Stanford Democrats do not
plan to take an official stance on
Rice's return to campus, according
to President Ashwin Mudaliar '09,
who said he personally opposed
many of Rice's decisions.
"We need to give her a full
review before giving her job back,
even if she is tenured," he said. "I
promise that if any professor lied
the way she did. they would not be
at this university anymore."

ment for a while, but she has shown
that she can get back into the swim
very fast."
Rumsfeld, Shultz argued, did not
have the same long-term academic
connection.
"Don had been an overseer at
Hoover, but has never been a uni
versity person." Shultz said. "His
career has been in politics."
Director of the Freeman Spogli
Institute Coit Blacker — who
served as a former special assistant
to President Clinton for National
Security Affairs — believes it would
not be appropriate to apply political
standards to people who go on leave
for public service positions.
"1 am sure there were many peo
ple who were unhappy with some
things that the Clinton administra
tion did. but 1 had taken a leave of
absence, and I think it is appropriate
that when a faculty member does
that, you hold on to that position for
him or her." Blacker said. "That is
just a matter of principle."
He added that there was never
any prospect that Rumsfeld was
going to move to Palo Alto so that
he could be a full-time fellow at
Hoover.
"So his status vis-a-vis Stanford
is completely different from
Secretary Rice's, who is a tenured
member of the political science
department's faculty — kind of
apples and oranges," Blacker said.
A number of professors involved
in the anti-Rumsfeld movement
have also told The Daily that they
do not object to Rice's return to

"Professor Rice has a
distinguished
academic career
behind her. There's
every reason for her
to be here and every
reason to return."
— JOSHUA LANDY,
associate French and
Italian professor

campus, even if they disagree with
her politics.
Humanities Prof. Roh Polhemus
said his objection to Rumsfeld was
largely based on his lack of creden
tials as an academic, a problem that
does not apply to Rice. Polhemus
pushed forward the petition that
called Rumsfeld's appointment
"contemptible."
"She's a full professor who does
have the right to be here," Polhemus
said. "I don't have any objection to
her being here."
"'I know a lot of people don't like
what her role in American history of
the last eight years [was], but that's
a separate issue," he added. "You
don't bump somebody from tenure
[for that]."
Associate French and Italian
Prof. Joshua Landy. another
Rumsfeld objector, agreed that
Rice's return should not be equated
with Rumsfeld's.
"It's a completely different case,"
Landy said. "For one thing, she's
returning to a job that was kept
open for her as opposed to Donald
Rumsfeld having a position created
for him ... Prof. Rice has a distin
guished academic career behind
her. There's every reason for her to
be here and every reason to return."
While students rallied in White

Plaza over Rumsfeld's appointment.
Rice's return has received a more
tepid response from student
activists. No formal coalition has yet
developed to oppose Rice, although
some students consider both her
and Rumsfeld war criminals.
Daniel Murray, a first-year Ph.D.
candidate in Modern Thought and
Literature, said several students in
his program are concerned about
Rice's role in sanctioning torture.
The students are trying to put
together a fall symposium about
torture and accountability, featuring
legal scholars, journalists and others
who study human rights issues.
On Feb. 3, Stanford Amnesty
International (SAI) held a screen
ing of "American Faust: From Condi
to Neo-Condi," a documentary on
Rice that approximately 50 people
attended. Both Murray and SAI co-
President Emma Laughlin '09 said
raising awareness of Rice's potential
human rights violations was a key
goal — a point echoed by Adam
Hudson '10, president of Stanford
Says No to War. who said his group
has no firm plans yet, but eventually
hopes to work with other organiza
tions in opposing Rice.
"[SAI members are] very flab
bergasted that she would be coming
back and that there's not massive
protest going on," Laughlin said.
"I'm certainly in favor of academic
freedom, and people can talk about
whether or not torture works, but
that's a lot different than actually
going out and doing it."
Students like Laughlin deem
Rice a "war criminal" for her
alleged sanction of torture and her
push for war in Iraq. Laughlin said
she knew one alumnus who met
people in Europe who nicknamed
Stanford "War Crimes University,"
based on its affiliation with Rice and
Rumsfeld.
The Stanford Democrats do not
plan to take an official stance on
Rice's return to campus, according
to President Ashwin Mudaliar '09,
who said he personally opposed
many of Rice's decisions.
"We need to give her a full
review before giving her job back,
even if she is tenured," he said. "I
promise that if any professor lied
the way she did. they would not be
at this university anymore."

Condoleezza Rice's return to Stanford has been quiet
so far. despite the clamor over George W. Bush's 2006
visit and Donald Rumsfeld's 2007 appointment at the
I loover Institution.
Following Rumsfeld's selection as a Distinguished
Visiting Fellow in fall 2007. faculty and students circulat
ed petitions in opposition. Debate over his appointment
consumed Faculty Senate and ASSIJ meetings. Despite
claims by student activists that Rice was also complicit in
"war crimes." the anti-Rice movement pales in compari
son to that targeting the former Secretary of Defense.
Rice will be taking up a position at Hoover, just as

Rumsfeld did. hut few equate her arrival with his contro
versial appointment. The former Secretary of State, after
all. is a tenured political science professor and a former
Stanford provost.
"(Rice) is returning to a long-established position,
whereas Rumsfeld was appointed to something he had
not held before and in a much more minor role as a dis
tinguished visiting scholar." said senior Hoover Fellow
Larry Diamond. "I also think Rumsfeld's service as
Secretary of Defense was far more ignominious than
Condi Rice's service in either of her positions, where I
think the ultimate record is at least more mixed."
George Shultz. a distinguished fellow at Hoover,
argued that Rice never truly left campus and compared
her return to his own experience coming back to Stanford
after serving as Secretary of State under President
Reagan.
"I was received warmly." Schultz
said, "but I didn't feel as though 1
was coming back to anything. I felt
as though I never left the
University."
Shultz said he had been involved
with universities continuously ever
since he joined the MIT faculty after
serving as a marine in World War 11.
I le said he never sold his house on
campus and would visit the Farm
regularly.
"It was just continuity and a nat
ural place to come back to: I think
Condi has the same situation," he
said. "She's basically been a univer
sity person for all of her adult life.
She's taken this detour into govern
ment for a while, but she has shown
that she can get back into the swim
very fast."
Rumsfeld, Shultz argued, did not
have the same long-term academic
connection.

versity person." Shultz said. "His
