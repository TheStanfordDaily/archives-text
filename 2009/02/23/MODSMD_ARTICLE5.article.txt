### ANDREA FULLER KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
"There was a big sigh of relief
in many quarters (when she
left] because she had not been
a popular provost."
JOHN MANLEY,
political science professor emeritus

Barton Bernstein still remembers where he was
sitting â€” at the end of a long table. Condolee/za
Rice to his right, and three seats away from the
speaker. It was the early 1980s, and the history pro
fessor and new political science assistant professor,
respectively, had gathered at Galvez House, the
building that once housed the arms control center.
Those gathered in the room went around the
table, discussing what they wanted to accomplish in
their life. Bernstein distinctly remembers Rice sav
ing that she hoped to be Secretary of State or
National Security Advisor.
"1 remember thinking. Highly unlikely."* he
admitted over 20 years later.
Rice would go on to fulfill not one but both of
those goals. Her time in Washington would cap off
nearly two decades spent as a well-liked Stanford
professor and sometimes-controversial provost.
While her return to the Farm means a return to
some of her most beloved friends, it also marks a
return to some of her oldest enemies.
A Charismatic Lecturer
At age 19. Rice received her bachelor's degree in
political science from the University ol Denver,
where she would receive her Ph.D. in 1981 after
receiving a master's degree in the same subject from
Notre Dame.The young scholar came to Stanford in
19X1 after receiving a Ford Foundation post-doctor
al fellowship, and she began teaching as an assistant
political science professor in 1982.
Rice was tenured in 1987. becoming an associate
professor. From 1989-1991, she served as a Soviet
expert on the National Security Council, and many
lamented her parting. In a 1989 Daily article, she
was labeled a "charismatic and innovative teacher.'
and one student recalled giving the popular profes
sor a birthday cake and singing during class. ("Rice
offered posts in Bush administration." Jan. 12.1989).
Rice received the Gores Award for I xcellence in
Teaching in 1984 and the School of 1 lumanities and
Sciences Dean's Award for Distinguished Teaching
