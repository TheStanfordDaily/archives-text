# Rice's history marked by conflict
## Rice's time on Farm gets mixed reactions from students, profs. 
### ANDREA FULLER KAMIL DADA SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
"There was a big sigh of relief
in many quarters (when she
left] because she had not been
a popular provost."
JOHN MANLEY,
political science professor emeritus

Barton Bernstein still remembers where he was
sitting — at the end of a long table. Condolee/za
Rice to his right, and three seats away from the
speaker. It was the early 1980s, and the history pro
fessor and new political science assistant professor,
respectively, had gathered at Galvez House, the
building that once housed the arms control center.
Those gathered in the room went around the
table, discussing what they wanted to accomplish in
their life. Bernstein distinctly remembers Rice sav
ing that she hoped to be Secretary of State or
National Security Advisor.
"1 remember thinking. Highly unlikely."* he
admitted over 20 years later.
Rice would go on to fulfill not one but both of
those goals. Her time in Washington would cap off
nearly two decades spent as a well-liked Stanford
professor and sometimes-controversial provost.
While her return to the Farm means a return to
some of her most beloved friends, it also marks a
return to some of her oldest enemies.
A Charismatic Lecturer
At age 19. Rice received her bachelor's degree in
political science from the University ol Denver,
where she would receive her Ph.D. in 1981 after
receiving a master's degree in the same subject from
Notre Dame.The young scholar came to Stanford in
19X1 after receiving a Ford Foundation post-doctor
al fellowship, and she began teaching as an assistant
political science professor in 1982.
Rice was tenured in 1987. becoming an associate
professor. From 1989-1991, she served as a Soviet
expert on the National Security Council, and many
lamented her parting. In a 1989 Daily article, she
was labeled a "charismatic and innovative teacher.'
and one student recalled giving the popular profes
sor a birthday cake and singing during class. ("Rice
offered posts in Bush administration." Jan. 12.1989).
Rice received the Gores Award for I xcellence in
Teaching in 1984 and the School of 1 lumanities and
Sciences Dean's Award for Distinguished Teaching

in 1993. Over a decade later, students still
remember her engaging lectures, particularly
in her class entitled "The Role of the Military
in Politics." I ler classes enjoyed the political
simulations she conducted, and students later
praised her intelligence and ability to synthe
size information.
"She was always extremely prepared as an
instructor and a lecturer," said Chris Aguas
•92. "She very clearly had a deep intimacy
with the material in terms of the historical
basis."
But it was her personable nature that
drew many undergraduates to Rice. Her will
ingness to talk with students about every
thing from classes to football built her a fol
lowing in the political science department.
"She was approachable; she was extreme
ly caring and warm and kind and [had] all
sorts of qualities that 1 wouldn't have neces
sarily expected in an advisor or professor,"
said Erin Alaimo '88, who would later work
in Washington. "She had a truly profound
impact on my life, my career."
Emmanuel Bart-Plange "93 not only took
Rice's popular lecture course, but also stud
ied with her in directed readings. (He joked
he's still bitter about his A- grades.) The foot
ball player would also work with Rice and
her father at The Center for a New
Generation, an after-school enrichment pro
gram for East Palo Alto students that Rice
co-founded.
For Bart-Plange, Rice was more than an
ordinary professor. She kept in touch with
him over the years, and even got to know his
mother.
"When I got married she sent me a gift
with a card from the White House," he said.
"She didn't have to do that, and she did."
Her love of sports and music enabled
many students to relate to Rice on a person
al level as well. Alan Brown '85, an advisee of
Rice's, said that he talked with the professor
about football as much as the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan.
"It's hard sometimes for kids to approach
a Stanford professor," he said. "I never felt
that with Prof. Rice. You could question any
thing. you could discuss anything. She was
open to ideas as opposed to spewing some
thing she'd already written."
"Her office door was always open, if 1 ever
needed to talk about a paper I was writing or
classes 1 was taking," added Eric Abrams '85.
another advisee. "It was really cool to engage
her in conversation about things outside of
academia. She was a huge football fan."
These personal connections have changed
how many of Rice's former students feel
about her time in the unpopular Bush admin
istration. Most jumped to her defense, saying
they fully believed that she did what she
thought was right for the country and
believed her intelligence enabled her to
make the best decisions possible.
"My feeling is she will be judged favorably
as someone who did the best job that she pos
sibly could have," Alaimo said. "I have never
known her not to do the best job. not to put
her absolute everything into everything she's
ever done."
And while some students are disappoint
ed with her political legacy, their memories of
Rice as a professor remain untarnished.
"She was absolutely one of my favorite
professors, maybe in the top two or three in
the whole time I was there." said Edward
Anderson '91. "I think it's unfortunate that
she had such a long association with the Bush
administration, but I was excited to see her
get into politics and do so well. Over time I've
respected her less, but she's obviously an
incredible person."
The Young Professor
Many professors, too. would look fondly
on Rice's early time at Stanford, even those
who would later go on to criticize her tenure
as provost.
"Many, many afternoons. Condi would
come out of her office, sit down at the secre
tary's desk, take off her shoes, and the two of
them would cackle," said Political Science
Prof. Emeritus I lubert Marshall, whose office
was close to Rice's. "It was just little things
like that that I liked about her."
Other professors vividly recalled fond
memories of their early exchanges with Rice.
George Shultz, former Secretary of State
under President Reagan and distinguished
fellow at the Hoover Institution, said that he
first met Rice after her stint in Washington on
the National Security Council for the first
President Bush.
"The reason why I remember | her] so
vividly is that [she] has such a capable and
interesting personality," he said. "She is fun to
be with, she's interesting, she's got a lot to say.
So. she's a person that I like to have on my list
of good friends."
History Prof. Emeritus David Kennedy
agreed and admired Rice's strong character.
"She was one of the most poised and self
possessed individuals on the face of the plan
et." he said. "That was evident to me from the
very first day that I met her. which I believe
was her first day on the campus."
Kennedy said that during Stanford's cen
tennial campaign in the late '80s and early
'90s. he often travelled with Rice to various
Stanford events and tried to envision what a
world after the Cold War might look like.
"We were a little bit ahead of our time
because the Cold War hadn't quite ended
then." he said. "I got to know her best in that
context, and I was consistently impressed
with how well-informed she was and how bal
anced her judgment was and how extraordi
narily well-spoken she was."
Earrv Diamond, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution, was also very impressed
with her poise, articulateness and ambition.
He was also surprised to hear of her political
affiliations.
"You would expect a young African-
American political science professor, espe
cially back in those days, to be a liberal
Democrat," he said, "and so, when I found
out she wasn't. I was surprised and it certain
lv made her all the more interesting."

But Rice was not without detractors in her
early years. Her time in the first Bush admin
istration and political zeal sat poorly with
some of her fellow scholars.
"1 had no negative personal interactions
with her except that I found her very early on
to be a very rigid ideologically oriented pro
fessor," said Political Science Prof. Emeritus
John Manley. "It didn't appeal to me very
much."
And while many found the young profes
sor amiable, some were less than impressed
with her scholarship.
"I'm still surprised that she would want to
return to Stanford and a professorship,"
wrote History Prof. Emeritus Paul Seaver.
who would later butt heads with Rice over
the Cultures. Ideas and Values (CIV) pro
gram. "As I understand it. Russianists did not
regard her as particularly distinguished as a
scholar, on the other hand, 1 believe that stu
dents who took her courses regarded her as a
good teacher."
Bernstein, who knew the professor from
various committees, seminars and personal
interactions, agreed.
"Condi Rice is only somewhat better than
a mediocre scholar," he said. "Her strengths
are vigorous right-wing opinionation. marked
social poise and a fluency in oral presenta
tion. Among the Stanford scholars in the
Soviet-Russian area, she would rank near the
bottom in the University. Over the years, in
my talking with at least four people in the
field, each of them would rank her at or near
the bottom and this was true before she went

to the Bush administration
and became prominent."
"Most of the people
who think she's brilliant
haven't read her. haven't
heard her, can't judge, are
being kind and are taken
in by social poise and
superficial fluency,"
Bernstein added.
Appointment as Provost
Rice's life would
change dramatically in
May 1993, when
University President
Gerhard Casper
announced that the politi
cal science professor
would take on the No. 2
job at the University:
provost. Casper met Rice
a year and a half prior,
when she was a member
of the presidential search
committee that selected
Casper.
The President told The
Daily in 1993 that he
believed her experience in
government would help
her deal with complex
issues, and that the her
selection signaled the
importance of diversity to
the University ("Casper
names Condoleezza Rice
as new provost," May 13.
1993).
In an exclusive inter
view with The Daily a few
days after. Rice praised
diversity and dismissed
her politics as irrelevant
— two issues that students
would view in a substan
tially different light in
later years ("Experienced
in the business of change,"
May 21.1993).
The first crisis Rice
would face, however, was
balancing the budget.
Soon after becoming
Provost in 1993, Rice
announced that the
University would face
massive cuts to curb
Stanford's deficit and
hoped that administrative

restructuring would solve long-term prob
lems ("Additional budget cuts looming for
University," Oct. 1,1993).
Ilie Daily reported that Rice said the situ
ation is so serious that if she were
approached "tomorrow with the greatest idea
since the silicon chip, [she'd] have to say.
'Sorry, we can't afford that.'"
The Provost would announce that she
planned to slash another $18 to $20 million
from the budget, drastically reducing central
administrative costs over the next three
years.
Budget cuts would make Rice a fair num
ber of enemies, and few departments were
pleased about the cost reduction estimates
they were asked to submit. Some faculty felt
that little was left to cut after other cuts in
recent years. Students would also complain
that they were not involved enough in the
process, to which Rice responded that the
budget "has to be on my timetable" ("Rice.
Senate discuss cuts." Feb. 2.1993).
Further controversial changes by Rice
included contracting out management of the
Faculty Club and the Stanford University
Press ("Budget stable, provost says." Nov. 11.
1996).
"1 am often asked if [in contracting out],
we are trying to run Stanford like a business."
Rice said. "The answer is no. We have to look
at ways to cut costs."
Coit Blacker, director of the Freeman
Spogli Institute and a long-time personal
friend of Rice, told The Daily last week that
the budget cuts were especially trying on the
former Provost.
"[The budget cuts| earned Provost Rice a
lot of animosity or hostility from groups that
felt that they had been targeted." he said. "So
I think it was a very difficult time for her. but
she has never been one to shy away from
making difficult decisions, if in her judgment,
they are the right decisions, and that's what
she did."

But as the years passed, budget cuts grew
less controversial. Rice sliced $6.1 million
from the budget in her first year, a figure
that decreased over the next few years. She
ultimately cut $16.8 million from the budg
et between 1994 and 1996. and the
University went on to enjoy multi-million
dollar surpluses.
The Diversity Debates
Though many lauded the pick of Rice as
"She was extremely
caring and warm and
kind and all sorts of
qualities that 1 wouldn't
have necessarily expected
in an advisor or professor."
— ERIN ALAIMO W

"She was the least
collegial colleague I can
remember of any
academic 1 met at
Stanford in more than 40
years."
PAUL SEAVER,
history professor emeritus

provost as a sign of Stanford's commitment
to diversity, tension soon built between Rice
and women and minority groups on campus.
When she pushed for more U.S. born
minority faculty, some students claimed she
was fueling "anti-immigrant hysteria" ("U.S.
born hiring policy questioned," Oct. 6. 1993).
But the most heated controversy involving
Rice and diversity in her early years would
come as a result of her budget cuts. As the
budget was pared down, campus ethnic com
munity centers became wary that they would
be affected, and the Provost did little to
assuage their concerns.
Tensions boiled over at a meeting in 1994,
when Rice tried to address the community
centers' concerns, at one point drawing scoffs
from the crowd ("Skeptical crowd grills top
officials at a forum on ethnic center cuts." Jan.

13,1994).
"You don't have the standing to question
my commitment to minorities and minority
issues," Rice said at the forum. "I've been
black all my life."
At another forum the following month,
the Provost also drew snickers when she told
the audience "you have to trust me." Students
told The Daily they felt like the Provost did
not respect them, and that they feared she
had a conservative agenda. The Daily called
her "impatient, even testy" and one senior
labeled her "unprofessional, personally
insulting and obnoxious" ("Out of the loop,
students fear 'conservative agenda,'" Feb. 25,
1994).
'ITiough the ethnic centers would ultimate
ly escape budget cuts. Rice's decision to elim
inate the position of Cecilia Burciaga, associ
ate dean of Student Affairs and Casa Zapata
resident fellow (RF),drew the ire of students.
Rice claimed the dismissal of the 20-year
employee was strictly for fiscal reasons, but
the firing outraged students.
A group of students soon began a hunger
strike, with over 40 people fasting for 24
hours in the Quad, and four continuing for
three days. The strike protested Burciaga's
layoff and called on the University to better
address a number of Chicano/a issues. The
strikes ultimately ended after three days, and
the University agreed to sign a letter declar
ing its commitment to diversity ("Strike ends
after three days, agreement reached," Mav 9,
1994).
"Condi is one tough nut," said Jim Leckie,
a civil engineering profes-

sor who observed the
negotiations between fac
ulty and students. "You
would have thought she
was negotiating with the
Russians and not with stu
dents. She clearly received
her management training
in the Pentagon."
Female faculty, too.
were displeased with Rice.
Some expressed outrage
in 1993 with the decision
of the Provost's
Committee on the
Recruitment and
Retention of Women
Faculty to remove a num
ber of personal anecdotes
about discrimination from
its report. Some female
faculty suggested she was
worried about Stanford's
image; the committee
countered that quotes
were eliminated to protect
privacy.
Rice's commitment
to women faculty would
again be questioned fol
lowing the denial of tenure
to Assistant History Prof.
Karen Sawislak. Though
her department approved
her for tenure, she was
rejected by the deans of
the School of Humanities
and Sciences. Students
would form the Student
Coalition to Tenure Karen
Sawislak. though Rice
would eventually deny her
appeal in 1998, sparking
further outcry.
Women faculty would
cite Sawislak's case as one
example of the Provost's
insensitivity to their issues.
A group of female profes
sors released a report in
1998 declaring that
Stanford had a poor record
of tenuring women faculty
in recent years. Rice would
call the report "error-rid
den" and "a polemic," dis
missing their concerns
("Tenure criticized." Feb.
25,1998).

"I don't believe myself that there is a cri
sis." Rice would say at a later meeting. "I
think Stanford is a good place for women."
("Caucus reports on female profs," May 11.
1998.)
"I very strongly feel that tenure is an eval
uation." she added. "You've had seven years
to prove it. If we start to introduce affirma
tive action policies into our tenure practices,
we've entered a slippery slope."
A group of faculty and staff would go on
to submit a complaint to the U.S. Department
of Labor in November 1998. alleging gender
discrimination in University hiring and pro
motion practices including tenure. The inves
tigation did not end until December 2007,
when the Department of Labor ruled in favor
of the University.
"No one in this complaint is asking for a
preference," Sawislak said. "We're asking to
be evaluated based on our qualifications."
("Labor Dept. may probe University," Feb. 3,
1999.)
The Final Provost Years
Rice's final years as Provost would not be
free of controversy. Many of the decisions
cited as her major accomplishments would
receive mixed reactions.
While the Provost's push for graduate
housing is considered one of her achieve
ments — she fought for short-term reconfig
uration to allow more students on campus
and announced in 1998 that $15 million
would go to building long-term housing —
students at the time were not fully satisfied.
In May 1998, over 1 (K) graduate students
camped out in the quad to protest lack of
adequate housing options. Her attitude
rubbed some students the wrong way.
"I didn't need students on the Quad to tell
me that there was a housing problem." Rice
later remarked ("Room for protest on cam
pus?" Oct. 6. 1998).
"People protesting in the Quad would

MAJOR DECISIONS AS
PROVOST:

■ Slashing the University budget by $16.8
million between 1994 and 1996
■ Eliminating the position of Cecilia
Burciaga, associate dean of Student
Affairs and Casa Zapata resident fellow
in 1994
| Denial of tenure to Assistant History Prof.
Karen Sawislak in 1998
| Making a commitment to expanding
graduate housing in 1998
| Formation of Sophomore College in
1995
| Creation of introductory seminars in
1997
| Replacing Cultures, Ideas and Values
(CIV) with Introduction to the Humanities
(IHUM) in 2000

never get me or, I think I can speak for
Gerhard [Casper] too, to do something that
we wouldn't do —to violate our personal
principles or to do something that is not in
the interest of the University," Rice added,
speaking about the protests that had
occurred in recent years.
Rice's formation of introductory seminars
and Sophomore College were undoubtedly
popular enhancements to undergraduate
education. But her support of replacing the
Cultures. Ideas and Values program with
Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM) gar
nered mixed reactions.
In 1995, a committee supported by the
Provost began to reevaluate the CIV pro
gram. which received varied responses from
students, some of whom complained about
the excessive yet superficial reading. Some
professors vehemently objected to the evalu
ation process, and History Prof. Carolyn
Lougee Chappell complained it was shroud
ed in secrecy ("CIV professors object to
shortening program." May 29.1996").
Although the CIV committee began
meeting in October 1995, the first meeting
held with CIV faculty to discuss their con
cerns took place a full year later.
"Instead of CIV faculty and student-pro
pelled changes, the push is coming from the
top down." Lougee Chappell said. " This
administration wants to do away with every
thing that was in place before they came to
makeover the University's image."
("Students award C IV high marks," Jan. 27.
1997.)
History Prof. Emeritus Paul Seaver peti
tioned the committee's review, saying it was
inadequate, but to no avail — IHUM was
fully implemented in 2(XH).
"1 was always glad that I had tenure,"
Seaver said. "Otherwise I would have been
out on my ear for refusing to be a team play
er' in my unsuccessful defense of the fresh
man CIV program."
His battles with Rice over CIV scarred his
impression of her.
"She was the least collegial colleague I can
remember of any academic I met at Stanford
in more than 40 years," Seaver recently said
to The Daily. "Her style was authoritarian;
she had no time for faculty governance.
Hence committees were regarded as a waste
of time, told what to do rather than consult
ed. and constituted of those too intimidated
to stand up to her bullying; given her control
of the budget, faculty were relatively easy to
intimidate."
Resignation
In December 1998, Rice announced that
she would step down as Provost the following
summer. Casper and others heaped praise on
the departing Provost, as did a number of
other faculty. But others were less enthused.
"I think most people were happy to see
her leave once Bush stole the first election in
2(HK)." Political Science Prof. Emeritus John
Manley told The Daily. "There was a big sigh
of relief in many quarters because she had
not been a popular provost."
"Her role as provost was very authoritari
an, very rigid, very dogmatic and not well
appreciated by the people with whom she
had to interact," he added.
History Prof. Barton Bernstein agreed.
"Almost everybody I know who dealt with
her came away annoyed, if not angry," he
said. "One heard of various tales where she
would get a long report from somebody, one
of the deans, and send it back within hours
with a one-word to one-sentence negative."
"I liked Condi when she was without
power." he added. "I found her pleasant, try
ing to grow, not very well educated, but eager
to know. As she gained power, I found her
arrogant, not any smarter, not likely to do her
homework, but ferociously opinionated and
willing to impose her dictates. She's a very
authoritarian person, although she's probably
very good at sucking up to power."
At the time. Rice dismissed rumors that
she would assist George Bush in his run for
the presidency and said she was hesitant to
return to government. That would all change,
of course, and Rice would go on to support
Bush and become his National Security
Advisor. Long before the world would
debate her performance in that role and as
Secretary of State, Stanford was deeply
affected by the popular professor and often
controversial Provost.
Looking back. Blacker suggested that no
one was surprised that Rice would go into
politics.
"1 think both by temperament and inclina
tion. Secretary Rice is on the activist end of
the spectrum in the academic world," he said.
"Plus, it's hard to say no when the President
asks you to do something."

"Many, many afternoons. Condi would
come out of her office, sit down at the secre
tary's desk, take off her shoes, and the two of
them would cackle," said Political Science
Prof. Emeritus I lubert Marshall, whose office
was close to Rice's. "It was just little things
like that that I liked about her."
Other professors vividly recalled fond
memories of their early exchanges with Rice.
George Shultz, former Secretary of State
under President Reagan and distinguished
fellow at the Hoover Institution, said that he
first met Rice after her stint in Washington on
the National Security Council for the first
President Bush.
"The reason why I remember | her] so
vividly is that [she] has such a capable and
interesting personality," he said. "She is fun to
be with, she's interesting, she's got a lot to say.
So. she's a person that I like to have on my list
of good friends."
History Prof. Emeritus David Kennedy
agreed and admired Rice's strong character.
"She was one of the most poised and self
possessed individuals on the face of the plan
et." he said. "That was evident to me from the
very first day that I met her. which I believe
was her first day on the campus."
Kennedy said that during Stanford's cen
tennial campaign in the late '80s and early
'90s. he often travelled with Rice to various
Stanford events and tried to envision what a
world after the Cold War might look like.
"We were a little bit ahead of our time
because the Cold War hadn't quite ended
then." he said. "I got to know her best in that
context, and I was consistently impressed
with how well-informed she was and how bal
anced her judgment was and how extraordi
narily well-spoken she was."
Earrv Diamond, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution, was also very impressed
with her poise, articulateness and ambition.
He was also surprised to hear of her political
affiliations.
"You would expect a young African-
American political science professor, espe
cially back in those days, to be a liberal
Democrat," he said, "and so, when I found
out she wasn't. I was surprised and it certain
lv made her all the more interesting."

But Rice was not without detractors in her
early years. Her time in the first Bush admin
istration and political zeal sat poorly with
some of her fellow scholars.
"1 had no negative personal interactions
with her except that I found her very early on
to be a very rigid ideologically oriented pro
fessor," said Political Science Prof. Emeritus
John Manley. "It didn't appeal to me very
much."
And while many found the young profes
sor amiable, some were less than impressed
with her scholarship.
"I'm still surprised that she would want to
return to Stanford and a professorship,"
wrote History Prof. Emeritus Paul Seaver.
who would later butt heads with Rice over
the Cultures. Ideas and Values (CIV) pro
gram. "As I understand it. Russianists did not
regard her as particularly distinguished as a
scholar, on the other hand, 1 believe that stu
dents who took her courses regarded her as a
good teacher."
Bernstein, who knew the professor from
various committees, seminars and personal
interactions, agreed.
"Condi Rice is only somewhat better than
a mediocre scholar," he said. "Her strengths
are vigorous right-wing opinionation. marked
social poise and a fluency in oral presenta
tion. Among the Stanford scholars in the
Soviet-Russian area, she would rank near the
bottom in the University. Over the years, in
my talking with at least four people in the
field, each of them would rank her at or near
the bottom and this was true before she went

to the Bush administration
and became prominent."
"Most of the people
who think she's brilliant
haven't read her. haven't
heard her, can't judge, are
being kind and are taken
in by social poise and
superficial fluency,"
Bernstein added.
Appointment as Provost
Rice's life would
change dramatically in
May 1993, when
University President
Gerhard Casper
announced that the politi
cal science professor
would take on the No. 2
job at the University:
provost. Casper met Rice
a year and a half prior,
when she was a member
of the presidential search
committee that selected
Casper.
The President told The
Daily in 1993 that he
believed her experience in
government would help
her deal with complex
issues, and that the her
selection signaled the
importance of diversity to
the University ("Casper
names Condoleezza Rice
as new provost," May 13.
1993).
In an exclusive inter
view with The Daily a few
days after. Rice praised
diversity and dismissed
her politics as irrelevant
— two issues that students
would view in a substan
tially different light in
later years ("Experienced
in the business of change,"
May 21.1993).
The first crisis Rice
would face, however, was
balancing the budget.
Soon after becoming
Provost in 1993, Rice
announced that the
University would face
massive cuts to curb
Stanford's deficit and
hoped that administrative

restructuring would solve long-term prob
lems ("Additional budget cuts looming for
University," Oct. 1,1993).
Ilie Daily reported that Rice said the situ
ation is so serious that if she were
approached "tomorrow with the greatest idea
since the silicon chip, [she'd] have to say.
'Sorry, we can't afford that.'"
The Provost would announce that she
planned to slash another $18 to $20 million
from the budget, drastically reducing central
administrative costs over the next three
years.
Budget cuts would make Rice a fair num
ber of enemies, and few departments were
pleased about the cost reduction estimates
they were asked to submit. Some faculty felt
that little was left to cut after other cuts in
recent years. Students would also complain
that they were not involved enough in the
process, to which Rice responded that the
budget "has to be on my timetable" ("Rice.
Senate discuss cuts." Feb. 2.1993).
Further controversial changes by Rice
included contracting out management of the
Faculty Club and the Stanford University
Press ("Budget stable, provost says." Nov. 11.
1996).
"1 am often asked if [in contracting out],
we are trying to run Stanford like a business."
Rice said. "The answer is no. We have to look
at ways to cut costs."
Coit Blacker, director of the Freeman
Spogli Institute and a long-time personal
friend of Rice, told The Daily last week that
the budget cuts were especially trying on the
former Provost.
"[The budget cuts| earned Provost Rice a
lot of animosity or hostility from groups that
felt that they had been targeted." he said. "So
I think it was a very difficult time for her. but
she has never been one to shy away from
making difficult decisions, if in her judgment,
they are the right decisions, and that's what
she did."

But as the years passed, budget cuts grew
less controversial. Rice sliced $6.1 million
from the budget in her first year, a figure
that decreased over the next few years. She
ultimately cut $16.8 million from the budg
et between 1994 and 1996. and the
University went on to enjoy multi-million
dollar surpluses.
The Diversity Debates
Though many lauded the pick of Rice as
"She was extremely
caring and warm and
kind and all sorts of
qualities that 1 wouldn't
have necessarily expected
in an advisor or professor."
— ERIN ALAIMO W

"She was the least
collegial colleague I can
remember of any
academic 1 met at
Stanford in more than 40
years."
PAUL SEAVER,
history professor emeritus

provost as a sign of Stanford's commitment
to diversity, tension soon built between Rice
and women and minority groups on campus.
When she pushed for more U.S. born
minority faculty, some students claimed she
was fueling "anti-immigrant hysteria" ("U.S.
born hiring policy questioned," Oct. 6. 1993).
But the most heated controversy involving
Rice and diversity in her early years would
come as a result of her budget cuts. As the
budget was pared down, campus ethnic com
munity centers became wary that they would
be affected, and the Provost did little to
assuage their concerns.
Tensions boiled over at a meeting in 1994,
when Rice tried to address the community
centers' concerns, at one point drawing scoffs
from the crowd ("Skeptical crowd grills top
officials at a forum on ethnic center cuts." Jan.

13,1994).
"You don't have the standing to question
my commitment to minorities and minority
issues," Rice said at the forum. "I've been
black all my life."
At another forum the following month,
the Provost also drew snickers when she told
the audience "you have to trust me." Students
told The Daily they felt like the Provost did
not respect them, and that they feared she
had a conservative agenda. The Daily called
her "impatient, even testy" and one senior
labeled her "unprofessional, personally
insulting and obnoxious" ("Out of the loop,
students fear 'conservative agenda,'" Feb. 25,
1994).
'ITiough the ethnic centers would ultimate
ly escape budget cuts. Rice's decision to elim
inate the position of Cecilia Burciaga, associ
ate dean of Student Affairs and Casa Zapata
resident fellow (RF),drew the ire of students.
Rice claimed the dismissal of the 20-year
employee was strictly for fiscal reasons, but
the firing outraged students.
A group of students soon began a hunger
strike, with over 40 people fasting for 24
hours in the Quad, and four continuing for
three days. The strike protested Burciaga's
layoff and called on the University to better
address a number of Chicano/a issues. The
strikes ultimately ended after three days, and
the University agreed to sign a letter declar
ing its commitment to diversity ("Strike ends
after three days, agreement reached," Mav 9,
1994).
"Condi is one tough nut," said Jim Leckie,
a civil engineering profes-

sor who observed the
negotiations between fac
ulty and students. "You
would have thought she
was negotiating with the
Russians and not with stu
dents. She clearly received
her management training
in the Pentagon."
Female faculty, too.
were displeased with Rice.
Some expressed outrage
in 1993 with the decision
of the Provost's
Committee on the
Recruitment and
Retention of Women
Faculty to remove a num
ber of personal anecdotes
about discrimination from
its report. Some female
faculty suggested she was
worried about Stanford's
image; the committee
countered that quotes
were eliminated to protect
privacy.
Rice's commitment
to women faculty would
again be questioned fol
lowing the denial of tenure
to Assistant History Prof.
Karen Sawislak. Though
her department approved
her for tenure, she was
rejected by the deans of
the School of Humanities
and Sciences. Students
would form the Student
Coalition to Tenure Karen
Sawislak. though Rice
would eventually deny her
appeal in 1998, sparking
further outcry.
Women faculty would
cite Sawislak's case as one
example of the Provost's
insensitivity to their issues.
A group of female profes
sors released a report in
1998 declaring that
Stanford had a poor record
of tenuring women faculty
in recent years. Rice would
call the report "error-rid
den" and "a polemic," dis
missing their concerns
("Tenure criticized." Feb.
25,1998).

"I don't believe myself that there is a cri
sis." Rice would say at a later meeting. "I
think Stanford is a good place for women."
("Caucus reports on female profs," May 11.
1998.)
"I very strongly feel that tenure is an eval
uation." she added. "You've had seven years
to prove it. If we start to introduce affirma
tive action policies into our tenure practices,
we've entered a slippery slope."
A group of faculty and staff would go on
to submit a complaint to the U.S. Department
of Labor in November 1998. alleging gender
discrimination in University hiring and pro
motion practices including tenure. The inves
tigation did not end until December 2007,
when the Department of Labor ruled in favor
of the University.
"No one in this complaint is asking for a
preference," Sawislak said. "We're asking to
be evaluated based on our qualifications."
("Labor Dept. may probe University," Feb. 3,
1999.)
The Final Provost Years
Rice's final years as Provost would not be
free of controversy. Many of the decisions
cited as her major accomplishments would
receive mixed reactions.
While the Provost's push for graduate
housing is considered one of her achieve
ments — she fought for short-term reconfig
uration to allow more students on campus
and announced in 1998 that $15 million
would go to building long-term housing —
students at the time were not fully satisfied.
In May 1998, over 1 (K) graduate students
camped out in the quad to protest lack of
adequate housing options. Her attitude
rubbed some students the wrong way.
"I didn't need students on the Quad to tell
me that there was a housing problem." Rice
later remarked ("Room for protest on cam
pus?" Oct. 6. 1998).
"People protesting in the Quad would

MAJOR DECISIONS AS
PROVOST:

■ Slashing the University budget by $16.8
million between 1994 and 1996
■ Eliminating the position of Cecilia
Burciaga, associate dean of Student
Affairs and Casa Zapata resident fellow
in 1994
| Denial of tenure to Assistant History Prof.
Karen Sawislak in 1998
| Making a commitment to expanding
graduate housing in 1998
| Formation of Sophomore College in
1995
| Creation of introductory seminars in
1997
| Replacing Cultures, Ideas and Values
(CIV) with Introduction to the Humanities
(IHUM) in 2000

never get me or, I think I can speak for
Gerhard [Casper] too, to do something that
we wouldn't do —to violate our personal
principles or to do something that is not in
the interest of the University," Rice added,
speaking about the protests that had
occurred in recent years.
Rice's formation of introductory seminars
and Sophomore College were undoubtedly
popular enhancements to undergraduate
education. But her support of replacing the
Cultures. Ideas and Values program with
Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM) gar
nered mixed reactions.
In 1995, a committee supported by the
Provost began to reevaluate the CIV pro
gram. which received varied responses from
students, some of whom complained about
the excessive yet superficial reading. Some
professors vehemently objected to the evalu
ation process, and History Prof. Carolyn
Lougee Chappell complained it was shroud
ed in secrecy ("CIV professors object to
shortening program." May 29.1996").
Although the CIV committee began
meeting in October 1995, the first meeting
held with CIV faculty to discuss their con
cerns took place a full year later.
"Instead of CIV faculty and student-pro
pelled changes, the push is coming from the
top down." Lougee Chappell said. " This
administration wants to do away with every
thing that was in place before they came to
makeover the University's image."
("Students award C IV high marks," Jan. 27.
1997.)
History Prof. Emeritus Paul Seaver peti
tioned the committee's review, saying it was
inadequate, but to no avail — IHUM was
fully implemented in 2(XH).
"1 was always glad that I had tenure,"
Seaver said. "Otherwise I would have been
out on my ear for refusing to be a team play
er' in my unsuccessful defense of the fresh
man CIV program."
His battles with Rice over CIV scarred his
impression of her.
"She was the least collegial colleague I can
remember of any academic I met at Stanford
in more than 40 years," Seaver recently said
to The Daily. "Her style was authoritarian;
she had no time for faculty governance.
Hence committees were regarded as a waste
of time, told what to do rather than consult
ed. and constituted of those too intimidated
to stand up to her bullying; given her control
of the budget, faculty were relatively easy to
intimidate."
Resignation
In December 1998, Rice announced that
she would step down as Provost the following
summer. Casper and others heaped praise on
the departing Provost, as did a number of
other faculty. But others were less enthused.
"I think most people were happy to see
her leave once Bush stole the first election in
2(HK)." Political Science Prof. Emeritus John
Manley told The Daily. "There was a big sigh
of relief in many quarters because she had
not been a popular provost."
"Her role as provost was very authoritari
an, very rigid, very dogmatic and not well
appreciated by the people with whom she
had to interact," he added.
History Prof. Barton Bernstein agreed.
"Almost everybody I know who dealt with
her came away annoyed, if not angry," he
said. "One heard of various tales where she
would get a long report from somebody, one
of the deans, and send it back within hours
with a one-word to one-sentence negative."
"I liked Condi when she was without
power." he added. "I found her pleasant, try
ing to grow, not very well educated, but eager
to know. As she gained power, I found her
arrogant, not any smarter, not likely to do her
homework, but ferociously opinionated and
willing to impose her dictates. She's a very
authoritarian person, although she's probably
very good at sucking up to power."
At the time. Rice dismissed rumors that
she would assist George Bush in his run for
the presidency and said she was hesitant to
return to government. That would all change,
of course, and Rice would go on to support
Bush and become his National Security
Advisor. Long before the world would
debate her performance in that role and as
Secretary of State, Stanford was deeply
affected by the popular professor and often
controversial Provost.
Looking back. Blacker suggested that no
one was surprised that Rice would go into
politics.
"1 think both by temperament and inclina
tion. Secretary Rice is on the activist end of
the spectrum in the academic world," he said.
"Plus, it's hard to say no when the President
asks you to do something."

Condoleezza Rice is known for her love of piano and is a trained concert pianist.
The former Provost is also an avid football fan and once was an ice skater. She has
maintained her passion for piano over the years, despite her busy schedule.
"There was a big sigh of relief
in many quarters (when she
left] because she had not been
a popular provost."
JOHN MANLEY,
political science professor emeritus

Barton Bernstein still remembers where he was
sitting — at the end of a long table. Condolee/za
Rice to his right, and three seats away from the
speaker. It was the early 1980s, and the history pro
fessor and new political science assistant professor,
respectively, had gathered at Galvez House, the
building that once housed the arms control center.
Those gathered in the room went around the
table, discussing what they wanted to accomplish in
their life. Bernstein distinctly remembers Rice sav
ing that she hoped to be Secretary of State or
National Security Advisor.
"1 remember thinking. Highly unlikely."* he
admitted over 20 years later.
Rice would go on to fulfill not one but both of
those goals. Her time in Washington would cap off
nearly two decades spent as a well-liked Stanford
professor and sometimes-controversial provost.
While her return to the Farm means a return to
some of her most beloved friends, it also marks a
return to some of her oldest enemies.
A Charismatic Lecturer
At age 19. Rice received her bachelor's degree in
political science from the University ol Denver,
where she would receive her Ph.D. in 1981 after
receiving a master's degree in the same subject from
Notre Dame.The young scholar came to Stanford in
19X1 after receiving a Ford Foundation post-doctor
al fellowship, and she began teaching as an assistant
political science professor in 1982.
Rice was tenured in 1987. becoming an associate
professor. From 1989-1991, she served as a Soviet
expert on the National Security Council, and many
lamented her parting. In a 1989 Daily article, she
was labeled a "charismatic and innovative teacher.'
and one student recalled giving the popular profes
sor a birthday cake and singing during class. ("Rice

Sciences Dean's Award for Distinguished Teaching

in 1993. Over a decade later, students still
remember her engaging lectures, particularly
in her class entitled "The Role of the Military
in Politics." I ler classes enjoyed the political
simulations she conducted, and students later
praised her intelligence and ability to synthe
size information.
"She was always extremely prepared as an
instructor and a lecturer," said Chris Aguas
•92. "She very clearly had a deep intimacy
with the material in terms of the historical
basis."
But it was her personable nature that
drew many undergraduates to Rice. Her will
ingness to talk with students about every
thing from classes to football built her a fol
lowing in the political science department.
"She was approachable; she was extreme
ly caring and warm and kind and [had] all
sorts of qualities that 1 wouldn't have neces
sarily expected in an advisor or professor,"
said Erin Alaimo '88, who would later work
in Washington. "She had a truly profound
impact on my life, my career."
Emmanuel Bart-Plange "93 not only took
Rice's popular lecture course, but also stud
ied with her in directed readings. (He joked
he's still bitter about his A- grades.) The foot
ball player would also work with Rice and
her father at The Center for a New
Generation, an after-school enrichment pro
gram for East Palo Alto students that Rice
co-founded.
For Bart-Plange, Rice was more than an
ordinary professor. She kept in touch with
him over the years, and even got to know his
mother.
"When I got married she sent me a gift
with a card from the White House," he said.
"She didn't have to do that, and she did."
Her love of sports and music enabled
many students to relate to Rice on a person
al level as well. Alan Brown '85, an advisee of
Rice's, said that he talked with the professor
about football as much as the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan.
"It's hard sometimes for kids to approach
a Stanford professor," he said. "I never felt
that with Prof. Rice. You could question any
thing. you could discuss anything. She was
open to ideas as opposed to spewing some
thing she'd already written."
"Her office door was always open, if 1 ever
needed to talk about a paper I was writing or
classes 1 was taking," added Eric Abrams '85.
another advisee. "It was really cool to engage
her in conversation about things outside of
academia. She was a huge football fan."
These personal connections have changed
how many of Rice's former students feel
about her time in the unpopular Bush admin
istration. Most jumped to her defense, saying
they fully believed that she did what she
thought was right for the country and
believed her intelligence enabled her to
make the best decisions possible.
"My feeling is she will be judged favorably
as someone who did the best job that she pos
sibly could have," Alaimo said. "I have never
known her not to do the best job. not to put
her absolute everything into everything she's
ever done."
And while some students are disappoint
ed with her political legacy, their memories of
Rice as a professor remain untarnished.
"She was absolutely one of my favorite
professors, maybe in the top two or three in
the whole time I was there." said Edward
Anderson '91. "I think it's unfortunate that
she had such a long association with the Bush
administration, but I was excited to see her
get into politics and do so well. Over time I've
respected her less, but she's obviously an
incredible person."
The Young Professor
Many professors, too. would look fondly
on Rice's early time at Stanford, even those
who would later go on to criticize her tenure
as provost.
"Many, many afternoons. Condi would
come out of her office, sit down at the secre
tary's desk, take off her shoes, and the two of
them would cackle," said Political Science
Prof. Emeritus I lubert Marshall, whose office
was close to Rice's. "It was just little things
like that that I liked about her."
Other professors vividly recalled fond
memories of their early exchanges with Rice.
George Shultz, former Secretary of State
under President Reagan and distinguished
fellow at the Hoover Institution, said that he
first met Rice after her stint in Washington on
the National Security Council for the first
President Bush.
"The reason why I remember | her] so
vividly is that [she] has such a capable and
interesting personality," he said. "She is fun to
be with, she's interesting, she's got a lot to say.
So. she's a person that I like to have on my list
of good friends."
History Prof. Emeritus David Kennedy
agreed and admired Rice's strong character.
"She was one of the most poised and self
possessed individuals on the face of the plan
et." he said. "That was evident to me from the
very first day that I met her. which I believe
was her first day on the campus."
Kennedy said that during Stanford's cen
tennial campaign in the late '80s and early
'90s. he often travelled with Rice to various
Stanford events and tried to envision what a
world after the Cold War might look like.
"We were a little bit ahead of our time
because the Cold War hadn't quite ended
then." he said. "I got to know her best in that
context, and I was consistently impressed
with how well-informed she was and how bal
anced her judgment was and how extraordi
narily well-spoken she was."
Earrv Diamond, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution, was also very impressed
with her poise, articulateness and ambition.
He was also surprised to hear of her political
affiliations.
"You would expect a young African-
American political science professor, espe

the Cultures. Ideas and Values (CIV) pro
gram. "As I understand it. Russianists did not
regard her as particularly distinguished as a

Bernstein, who knew the professor from
various committees, seminars and personal

"Condi Rice is only somewhat better than
a mediocre scholar," he said. "Her strengths
are vigorous right-wing opinionation. marked
social poise and a fluency in oral presenta

"Most of the people

superficial fluency,"
Bernstein added.
Appointment as Provost
Rice's life would
change dramatically in
May 1993, when
University President
Gerhard Casper
announced that the politi
cal science professor
would take on the No. 2
job at the University:
provost. Casper met Rice
a year and a half prior,
when she was a member
of the presidential search
committee that selected
Casper.
The President told The

selection signaled the
importance of diversity to
the University ("Casper

Further controversial changes by Rice
included contracting out management of the
Faculty Club and the Stanford University
Press ("Budget stable, provost says." Nov. 11.
1996).
"1 am often asked if [in contracting out],
we are trying to run Stanford like a business."
Rice said. "The answer is no. We have to look
at ways to cut costs."
Coit Blacker, director of the Freeman
Spogli Institute and a long-time personal
friend of Rice, told The Daily last week that
the budget cuts were especially trying on the
former Provost.
"[The budget cuts| earned Provost Rice a
lot of animosity or hostility from groups that
felt that they had been targeted." he said. "So
I think it was a very difficult time for her. but
she has never been one to shy away from
making difficult decisions, if in her judgment,
they are the right decisions, and that's what
she did."

But as the years passed, budget cuts grew
less controversial. Rice sliced $6.1 million
from the budget in her first year, a figure
that decreased over the next few years. She
ultimately cut $16.8 million from the budg
et between 1994 and 1996. and the
University went on to enjoy multi-million
dollar surpluses.
The Diversity Debates
Though many lauded the pick of Rice as
"She was extremely
caring and warm and
kind and all sorts of
qualities that 1 wouldn't
have necessarily expected
in an advisor or professor."

Stanford in more than 40
years."

provost as a sign of Stanford's commitment
to diversity, tension soon built between Rice
and women and minority groups on campus.
When she pushed for more U.S. born
minority faculty, some students claimed she
was fueling "anti-immigrant hysteria" ("U.S.
born hiring policy questioned," Oct. 6. 1993).
But the most heated controversy involving
Rice and diversity in her early years would
come as a result of her budget cuts. As the
budget was pared down, campus ethnic com
munity centers became wary that they would
be affected, and the Provost did little to
assuage their concerns.
Tensions boiled over at a meeting in 1994,
when Rice tried to address the community
centers' concerns, at one point drawing scoffs
from the crowd ("Skeptical crowd grills top
officials at a forum on ethnic center cuts." Jan.

13,1994).
"You don't have the standing to question
my commitment to minorities and minority
issues," Rice said at the forum. "I've been
black all my life."
At another forum the following month,
the Provost also drew snickers when she told
the audience "you have to trust me." Students
told The Daily they felt like the Provost did
not respect them, and that they feared she
had a conservative agenda. The Daily called
her "impatient, even testy" and one senior
labeled her "unprofessional, personally
insulting and obnoxious" ("Out of the loop,
students fear 'conservative agenda,'" Feb. 25,
1994).
'ITiough the ethnic centers would ultimate
ly escape budget cuts. Rice's decision to elim
inate the position of Cecilia Burciaga, associ
ate dean of Student Affairs and Casa Zapata
resident fellow (RF),drew the ire of students.
Rice claimed the dismissal of the 20-year
employee was strictly for fiscal reasons, but
the firing outraged students.
A group of students soon began a hunger
strike, with over 40 people fasting for 24
hours in the Quad, and four continuing for
three days. The strike protested Burciaga's
layoff and called on the University to better
address a number of Chicano/a issues. The
strikes ultimately ended after three days, and
the University agreed to sign a letter declar
ing its commitment to diversity ("Strike ends
after three days, agreement reached," Mav 9,
1994).
"Condi is one tough nut," said Jim Leckie,
a civil engineering profes-

sor who observed the
negotiations between fac
ulty and students. "You
would have thought she
was negotiating with the
Russians and not with stu
dents. She clearly received
her management training
in the Pentagon."
Female faculty, too.
were displeased with Rice.
Some expressed outrage
in 1993 with the decision
of the Provost's
Committee on the
Recruitment and
Retention of Women
Faculty to remove a num
ber of personal anecdotes
about discrimination from
its report. Some female
faculty suggested she was
worried about Stanford's
image; the committee
countered that quotes
were eliminated to protect
privacy.
Rice's commitment
to women faculty would
again be questioned fol
lowing the denial of tenure
to Assistant History Prof.
Karen Sawislak. Though
her department approved
her for tenure, she was
rejected by the deans of
the School of Humanities
and Sciences. Students
would form the Student
Coalition to Tenure Karen
Sawislak. though Rice
would eventually deny her
appeal in 1998, sparking
further outcry.
Women faculty would
cite Sawislak's case as one
example of the Provost's
insensitivity to their issues.
A group of female profes
sors released a report in
1998 declaring that
Stanford had a poor record
of tenuring women faculty
in recent years. Rice would
call the report "error-rid
den" and "a polemic," dis
missing their concerns
("Tenure criticized." Feb.
25,1998).

"I don't believe myself that there is a cri
sis." Rice would say at a later meeting. "I
think Stanford is a good place for women."
("Caucus reports on female profs," May 11.
1998.)
"I very strongly feel that tenure is an eval
uation." she added. "You've had seven years
to prove it. If we start to introduce affirma
tive action policies into our tenure practices,
we've entered a slippery slope."
A group of faculty and staff would go on
to submit a complaint to the U.S. Department
of Labor in November 1998. alleging gender
discrimination in University hiring and pro
motion practices including tenure. The inves
tigation did not end until December 2007,
when the Department of Labor ruled in favor
of the University.
"No one in this complaint is asking for a
preference," Sawislak said. "We're asking to
be evaluated based on our qualifications."
("Labor Dept. may probe University," Feb. 3,
1999.)
The Final Provost Years
Rice's final years as Provost would not be
free of controversy. Many of the decisions
cited as her major accomplishments would
receive mixed reactions.
While the Provost's push for graduate
housing is considered one of her achieve
ments — she fought for short-term reconfig
uration to allow more students on campus
and announced in 1998 that $15 million
would go to building long-term housing —
students at the time were not fully satisfied.
In May 1998, over 1 (K) graduate students
camped out in the quad to protest lack of
adequate housing options. Her attitude
rubbed some students the wrong way.
"I didn't need students on the Quad to tell
me that there was a housing problem." Rice
later remarked ("Room for protest on cam
pus?" Oct. 6. 1998).
"People protesting in the Quad would

MAJOR DECISIONS AS
PROVOST:

■ Slashing the University budget by $16.8
million between 1994 and 1996
■ Eliminating the position of Cecilia
Burciaga, associate dean of Student
Affairs and Casa Zapata resident fellow
in 1994
| Denial of tenure to Assistant History Prof.
Karen Sawislak in 1998
| Making a commitment to expanding
graduate housing in 1998
| Formation of Sophomore College in
1995
| Creation of introductory seminars in
1997
| Replacing Cultures, Ideas and Values

(IHUM) in 2000

never get me or, I think I can speak for
Gerhard [Casper] too, to do something that
we wouldn't do —to violate our personal
principles or to do something that is not in
the interest of the University," Rice added,
speaking about the protests that had
occurred in recent years.
Rice's formation of introductory seminars
and Sophomore College were undoubtedly
popular enhancements to undergraduate
education. But her support of replacing the
Cultures. Ideas and Values program with
Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM) gar
nered mixed reactions.
In 1995, a committee supported by the
Provost began to reevaluate the CIV pro
gram. which received varied responses from
students, some of whom complained about
the excessive yet superficial reading. Some
professors vehemently objected to the evalu
ation process, and History Prof. Carolyn
Lougee Chappell complained it was shroud
ed in secrecy ("CIV professors object to
shortening program." May 29.1996").
Although the CIV committee began
meeting in October 1995, the first meeting
held with CIV faculty to discuss their con
cerns took place a full year later.
"Instead of CIV faculty and student-pro
pelled changes, the push is coming from the
top down." Lougee Chappell said. " This
administration wants to do away with every
thing that was in place before they came to
makeover the University's image."
("Students award C IV high marks," Jan. 27.
1997.)
History Prof. Emeritus Paul Seaver peti
tioned the committee's review, saying it was
inadequate, but to no avail — IHUM was
fully implemented in 2(XH).
"1 was always glad that I had tenure,"
Seaver said. "Otherwise I would have been
out on my ear for refusing to be a team play
er' in my unsuccessful defense of the fresh
man CIV program."
His battles with Rice over CIV scarred his
impression of her.
"She was the least collegial colleague I can
remember of any academic I met at Stanford
in more than 40 years," Seaver recently said
to The Daily. "Her style was authoritarian;
she had no time for faculty governance.
Hence committees were regarded as a waste
of time, told what to do rather than consult
ed. and constituted of those too intimidated
to stand up to her bullying; given her control
of the budget, faculty were relatively easy to
intimidate."
Resignation
In December 1998, Rice announced that
she would step down as Provost the following
summer. Casper and others heaped praise on
the departing Provost, as did a number of
other faculty. But others were less enthused.
"I think most people were happy to see
her leave once Bush stole the first election in
2(HK)." Political Science Prof. Emeritus John
Manley told The Daily. "There was a big sigh
of relief in many quarters because she had
not been a popular provost."
"Her role as provost was very authoritari
an, very rigid, very dogmatic and not well
appreciated by the people with whom she
had to interact," he added.
History Prof. Barton Bernstein agreed.
"Almost everybody I know who dealt with
her came away annoyed, if not angry," he
said. "One heard of various tales where she
would get a long report from somebody, one
of the deans, and send it back within hours
with a one-word to one-sentence negative."
"I liked Condi when she was without
power." he added. "I found her pleasant, try
ing to grow, not very well educated, but eager
to know. As she gained power, I found her
arrogant, not any smarter, not likely to do her
homework, but ferociously opinionated and
willing to impose her dictates. She's a very
authoritarian person, although she's probably
very good at sucking up to power."
At the time. Rice dismissed rumors that
she would assist George Bush in his run for
the presidency and said she was hesitant to
return to government. That would all change,
of course, and Rice would go on to support
Bush and become his National Security
Advisor. Long before the world would
debate her performance in that role and as
Secretary of State, Stanford was deeply
affected by the popular professor and often
controversial Provost.
Looking back. Blacker suggested that no
one was surprised that Rice would go into
politics.
"1 think both by temperament and inclina
tion. Secretary Rice is on the activist end of
the spectrum in the academic world," he said.
"Plus, it's hard to say no when the President
asks you to do something."

Condoleezza Rice is known for her love of piano and is a trained concert pianist.
The former Provost is also an avid football fan and once was an ice skater. She has
maintained her passion for piano over the years, despite her busy schedule.
"There was a big sigh of relief
in many quarters (when she
left] because she had not been
a popular provost."
JOHN MANLEY,
political science professor emeritus

Barton Bernstein still remembers where he was
sitting — at the end of a long table. Condolee/za
Rice to his right, and three seats away from the
speaker. It was the early 1980s, and the history pro
fessor and new political science assistant professor,
respectively, had gathered at Galvez House, the
building that once housed the arms control center.
Those gathered in the room went around the
table, discussing what they wanted to accomplish in
their life. Bernstein distinctly remembers Rice sav
ing that she hoped to be Secretary of State or
National Security Advisor.
"1 remember thinking. Highly unlikely."* he
admitted over 20 years later.
Rice would go on to fulfill not one but both of
those goals. Her time in Washington would cap off
nearly two decades spent as a well-liked Stanford
professor and sometimes-controversial provost.
While her return to the Farm means a return to
some of her most beloved friends, it also marks a
return to some of her oldest enemies.
A Charismatic Lecturer
At age 19. Rice received her bachelor's degree in
political science from the University ol Denver,
where she would receive her Ph.D. in 1981 after
receiving a master's degree in the same subject from
Notre Dame.The young scholar came to Stanford in
19X1 after receiving a Ford Foundation post-doctor
al fellowship, and she began teaching as an assistant
political science professor in 1982.
Rice was tenured in 1987. becoming an associate
professor. From 1989-1991, she served as a Soviet
expert on the National Security Council, and many
lamented her parting. In a 1989 Daily article, she
was labeled a "charismatic and innovative teacher.'
and one student recalled giving the popular profes
sor a birthday cake and singing during class. ("Rice

Sciences Dean's Award for Distinguished Teaching

in 1993. Over a decade later, students still
remember her engaging lectures, particularly
in her class entitled "The Role of the Military
in Politics." I ler classes enjoyed the political
simulations she conducted, and students later
praised her intelligence and ability to synthe
size information.
"She was always extremely prepared as an
instructor and a lecturer," said Chris Aguas
•92. "She very clearly had a deep intimacy
with the material in terms of the historical
basis."
But it was her personable nature that
drew many undergraduates to Rice. Her will
ingness to talk with students about every
thing from classes to football built her a fol
lowing in the political science department.
"She was approachable; she was extreme
ly caring and warm and kind and [had] all
sorts of qualities that 1 wouldn't have neces
sarily expected in an advisor or professor,"
said Erin Alaimo '88, who would later work
in Washington. "She had a truly profound
impact on my life, my career."
Emmanuel Bart-Plange "93 not only took
Rice's popular lecture course, but also stud
ied with her in directed readings. (He joked
he's still bitter about his A- grades.) The foot
ball player would also work with Rice and
her father at The Center for a New
Generation, an after-school enrichment pro
gram for East Palo Alto students that Rice
co-founded.
For Bart-Plange, Rice was more than an
ordinary professor. She kept in touch with
him over the years, and even got to know his
mother.
"When I got married she sent me a gift
with a card from the White House," he said.
"She didn't have to do that, and she did."
Her love of sports and music enabled
many students to relate to Rice on a person
al level as well. Alan Brown '85, an advisee of
Rice's, said that he talked with the professor
about football as much as the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan.
"It's hard sometimes for kids to approach
a Stanford professor," he said. "I never felt
that with Prof. Rice. You could question any
thing. you could discuss anything. She was
open to ideas as opposed to spewing some
thing she'd already written."
"Her office door was always open, if 1 ever
needed to talk about a paper I was writing or
classes 1 was taking," added Eric Abrams '85.
another advisee. "It was really cool to engage
her in conversation about things outside of
academia. She was a huge football fan."
These personal connections have changed
how many of Rice's former students feel
about her time in the unpopular Bush admin
istration. Most jumped to her defense, saying
they fully believed that she did what she
thought was right for the country and
believed her intelligence enabled her to
make the best decisions possible.
"My feeling is she will be judged favorably
as someone who did the best job that she pos
sibly could have," Alaimo said. "I have never
known her not to do the best job. not to put
her absolute everything into everything she's
ever done."
And while some students are disappoint
ed with her political legacy, their memories of
Rice as a professor remain untarnished.
"She was absolutely one of my favorite
professors, maybe in the top two or three in
the whole time I was there." said Edward
Anderson '91. "I think it's unfortunate that
she had such a long association with the Bush
administration, but I was excited to see her
get into politics and do so well. Over time I've
respected her less, but she's obviously an
incredible person."
The Young Professor
Many professors, too. would look fondly
on Rice's early time at Stanford, even those
who would later go on to criticize her tenure
as provost.
"Many, many afternoons. Condi would
come out of her office, sit down at the secre
tary's desk, take off her shoes, and the two of
them would cackle," said Political Science
Prof. Emeritus I lubert Marshall, whose office
was close to Rice's. "It was just little things
like that that I liked about her."
Other professors vividly recalled fond
memories of their early exchanges with Rice.
George Shultz, former Secretary of State
under President Reagan and distinguished
fellow at the Hoover Institution, said that he
first met Rice after her stint in Washington on
the National Security Council for the first
President Bush.
"The reason why I remember | her] so
vividly is that [she] has such a capable and
interesting personality," he said. "She is fun to
be with, she's interesting, she's got a lot to say.
So. she's a person that I like to have on my list
of good friends."
History Prof. Emeritus David Kennedy
agreed and admired Rice's strong character.
"She was one of the most poised and self
possessed individuals on the face of the plan
et." he said. "That was evident to me from the
very first day that I met her. which I believe
was her first day on the campus."
Kennedy said that during Stanford's cen
tennial campaign in the late '80s and early
'90s. he often travelled with Rice to various
Stanford events and tried to envision what a
world after the Cold War might look like.
"We were a little bit ahead of our time
because the Cold War hadn't quite ended
then." he said. "I got to know her best in that
context, and I was consistently impressed
with how well-informed she was and how bal
anced her judgment was and how extraordi
narily well-spoken she was."
Earrv Diamond, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution, was also very impressed
with her poise, articulateness and ambition.
He was also surprised to hear of her political
affiliations.
"You would expect a young African-
American political science professor, espe
cially back in those days, to be a liberal
Democrat," he said, "and so, when I found
out she wasn't. I was surprised and it certain
lv made her all the more interesting."

But Rice was not without detractors in her
early years. Her time in the first Bush admin
istration and political zeal sat poorly with
some of her fellow scholars.
"1 had no negative personal interactions
with her except that I found her very early on
to be a very rigid ideologically oriented pro
fessor," said Political Science Prof. Emeritus
John Manley. "It didn't appeal to me very
much."
And while many found the young profes
sor amiable, some were less than impressed
with her scholarship.
"I'm still surprised that she would want to
return to Stanford and a professorship,"
wrote History Prof. Emeritus Paul Seaver.
who would later butt heads with Rice over
the Cultures. Ideas and Values (CIV) pro
gram. "As I understand it. Russianists did not
regard her as particularly distinguished as a
scholar, on the other hand, 1 believe that stu
dents who took her courses regarded her as a
good teacher."
Bernstein, who knew the professor from
various committees, seminars and personal
interactions, agreed.
"Condi Rice is only somewhat better than
a mediocre scholar," he said. "Her strengths
are vigorous right-wing opinionation. marked
social poise and a fluency in oral presenta
tion. Among the Stanford scholars in the
Soviet-Russian area, she would rank near the
bottom in the University. Over the years, in
my talking with at least four people in the
field, each of them would rank her at or near
the bottom and this was true before she went

to the Bush administration
and became prominent."
"Most of the people
who think she's brilliant
haven't read her. haven't
heard her, can't judge, are
being kind and are taken
in by social poise and
superficial fluency,"
Bernstein added.
Appointment as Provost
Rice's life would
change dramatically in
May 1993, when
University President
Gerhard Casper
announced that the politi
cal science professor
would take on the No. 2
job at the University:
provost. Casper met Rice
a year and a half prior,
when she was a member
of the presidential search
committee that selected
Casper.
The President told The
Daily in 1993 that he
believed her experience in
government would help
her deal with complex
issues, and that the her
selection signaled the
importance of diversity to
the University ("Casper
names Condoleezza Rice
as new provost," May 13.
1993).
In an exclusive inter
view with The Daily a few
days after. Rice praised
diversity and dismissed
her politics as irrelevant
— two issues that students
would view in a substan
tially different light in
later years ("Experienced
in the business of change,"
May 21.1993).
The first crisis Rice
would face, however, was
balancing the budget.
Soon after becoming
Provost in 1993, Rice
announced that the
University would face
massive cuts to curb
Stanford's deficit and
hoped that administrative

restructuring would solve long-term prob
lems ("Additional budget cuts looming for
University," Oct. 1,1993).
Ilie Daily reported that Rice said the situ
ation is so serious that if she were
approached "tomorrow with the greatest idea
since the silicon chip, [she'd] have to say.
'Sorry, we can't afford that.'"
The Provost would announce that she
planned to slash another $18 to $20 million
from the budget, drastically reducing central
administrative costs over the next three
years.
Budget cuts would make Rice a fair num
ber of enemies, and few departments were
pleased about the cost reduction estimates
they were asked to submit. Some faculty felt
that little was left to cut after other cuts in
recent years. Students would also complain
that they were not involved enough in the
process, to which Rice responded that the
budget "has to be on my timetable" ("Rice.
Senate discuss cuts." Feb. 2.1993).
Further controversial changes by Rice
included contracting out management of the
Faculty Club and the Stanford University
Press ("Budget stable, provost says." Nov. 11.
1996).
"1 am often asked if [in contracting out],
we are trying to run Stanford like a business."
Rice said. "The answer is no. We have to look
at ways to cut costs."
Coit Blacker, director of the Freeman
Spogli Institute and a long-time personal
friend of Rice, told The Daily last week that
the budget cuts were especially trying on the
former Provost.
"[The budget cuts| earned Provost Rice a
lot of animosity or hostility from groups that
felt that they had been targeted." he said. "So
I think it was a very difficult time for her. but
she has never been one to shy away from
making difficult decisions, if in her judgment,
they are the right decisions, and that's what
she did."

But as the years passed, budget cuts grew
less controversial. Rice sliced $6.1 million
from the budget in her first year, a figure
that decreased over the next few years. She
ultimately cut $16.8 million from the budg
et between 1994 and 1996. and the
University went on to enjoy multi-million
dollar surpluses.

A group of faculty and staff would go on
to submit a complaint to the U.S. Department
of Labor in November 1998. alleging gender
discrimination in University hiring and pro
motion practices including tenure. The inves
tigation did not end until December 2007,
when the Department of Labor ruled in favor
of the University.
"No one in this complaint is asking for a
preference," Sawislak said. "We're asking to
be evaluated based on our qualifications."
("Labor Dept. may probe University," Feb. 3,
1999.)
The Final Provost Years
Rice's final years as Provost would not be
free of controversy. Many of the decisions
cited as her major accomplishments would
receive mixed reactions.
While the Provost's push for graduate
housing is considered one of her achieve
ments — she fought for short-term reconfig
uration to allow more students on campus
and announced in 1998 that $15 million
would go to building long-term housing —
students at the time were not fully satisfied.
In May 1998, over 1 (K) graduate students
camped out in the quad to protest lack of
adequate housing options. Her attitude
rubbed some students the wrong way.
"I didn't need students on the Quad to tell
me that there was a housing problem." Rice
later remarked ("Room for protest on cam
pus?" Oct. 6. 1998).
"People protesting in the Quad would

never get me or, I think I can speak for
Gerhard [Casper] too, to do something that
we wouldn't do —to violate our personal
principles or to do something that is not in
the interest of the University," Rice added,
speaking about the protests that had
occurred in recent years.
Rice's formation of introductory seminars
and Sophomore College were undoubtedly
popular enhancements to undergraduate
education. But her support of replacing the
Cultures. Ideas and Values program with
Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM) gar
nered mixed reactions.
In 1995, a committee supported by the
Provost began to reevaluate the CIV pro
gram. which received varied responses from
students, some of whom complained about
the excessive yet superficial reading. Some
professors vehemently objected to the evalu
ation process, and History Prof. Carolyn
Lougee Chappell complained it was shroud
ed in secrecy ("CIV professors object to
shortening program." May 29.1996").
Although the CIV committee began
meeting in October 1995, the first meeting
held with CIV faculty to discuss their con
cerns took place a full year later.
"Instead of CIV faculty and student-pro
pelled changes, the push is coming from the
top down." Lougee Chappell said. " This
administration wants to do away with every
thing that was in place before they came to
makeover the University's image."
("Students award C IV high marks," Jan. 27.
1997.)
History Prof. Emeritus Paul Seaver peti
tioned the committee's review, saying it was
inadequate, but to no avail — IHUM was
fully implemented in 2(XH).
"1 was always glad that I had tenure,"
Seaver said. "Otherwise I would have been
out on my ear for refusing to be a team play
er' in my unsuccessful defense of the fresh
man CIV program."
His battles with Rice over CIV scarred his
impression of her.
"She was the least collegial colleague I can
remember of any academic I met at Stanford
in more than 40 years," Seaver recently said
to The Daily. "Her style was authoritarian;
she had no time for faculty governance.
Hence committees were regarded as a waste
of time, told what to do rather than consult
ed. and constituted of those too intimidated
to stand up to her bullying; given her control
of the budget, faculty were relatively easy to
intimidate."
Resignation
In December 1998, Rice announced that
she would step down as Provost the following
summer. Casper and others heaped praise on
the departing Provost, as did a number of
other faculty. But others were less enthused.
"I think most people were happy to see
her leave once Bush stole the first election in
2(HK)." Political Science Prof. Emeritus John
Manley told The Daily. "There was a big sigh
of relief in many quarters because she had
not been a popular provost."
"Her role as provost was very authoritari
an, very rigid, very dogmatic and not well
appreciated by the people with whom she
had to interact," he added.
History Prof. Barton Bernstein agreed.
"Almost everybody I know who dealt with
her came away annoyed, if not angry," he
said. "One heard of various tales where she
would get a long report from somebody, one
of the deans, and send it back within hours
with a one-word to one-sentence negative."
"I liked Condi when she was without
power." he added. "I found her pleasant, try
ing to grow, not very well educated, but eager
to know. As she gained power, I found her
arrogant, not any smarter, not likely to do her
homework, but ferociously opinionated and
willing to impose her dictates. She's a very
authoritarian person, although she's probably
very good at sucking up to power."
At the time. Rice dismissed rumors that
she would assist George Bush in his run for
the presidency and said she was hesitant to
return to government. That would all change,
of course, and Rice would go on to support
Bush and become his National Security
Advisor. Long before the world would
debate her performance in that role and as
Secretary of State, Stanford was deeply
affected by the popular professor and often
controversial Provost.
Looking back. Blacker suggested that no
one was surprised that Rice would go into
politics.
"1 think both by temperament and inclina
tion. Secretary Rice is on the activist end of
the spectrum in the academic world," he said.
"Plus, it's hard to say no when the President
asks you to do something."

Condoleezza Rice is known for her love of piano and is a trained concert pianist.
The former Provost is also an avid football fan and once was an ice skater. She has
maintained her passion for piano over the years, despite her busy schedule.
"There was a big sigh of relief
in many quarters (when she
left] because she had not been
a popular provost."
JOHN MANLEY,
political science professor emeritus

Barton Bernstein still remembers where he was
sitting — at the end of a long table. Condolee/za
Rice to his right, and three seats away from the
speaker. It was the early 1980s, and the history pro
fessor and new political science assistant professor,
respectively, had gathered at Galvez House, the
building that once housed the arms control center.
Those gathered in the room went around the
table, discussing what they wanted to accomplish in
their life. Bernstein distinctly remembers Rice sav
ing that she hoped to be Secretary of State or
National Security Advisor.
"1 remember thinking. Highly unlikely."* he
admitted over 20 years later.
Rice would go on to fulfill not one but both of
those goals. Her time in Washington would cap off
nearly two decades spent as a well-liked Stanford
professor and sometimes-controversial provost.
While her return to the Farm means a return to
some of her most beloved friends, it also marks a
return to some of her oldest enemies.
A Charismatic Lecturer
At age 19. Rice received her bachelor's degree in
political science from the University ol Denver,
where she would receive her Ph.D. in 1981 after
receiving a master's degree in the same subject from
Notre Dame.The young scholar came to Stanford in
19X1 after receiving a Ford Foundation post-doctor
al fellowship, and she began teaching as an assistant
political science professor in 1982.
Rice was tenured in 1987. becoming an associate
professor. From 1989-1991, she served as a Soviet
expert on the National Security Council, and many
lamented her parting. In a 1989 Daily article, she
was labeled a "charismatic and innovative teacher.'
and one student recalled giving the popular profes
sor a birthday cake and singing during class. ("Rice

her early days, Rice handled dramatic budget cuts.
in 1993. Over a decade later, students still
remember her engaging lectures, particularly
in her class entitled "The Role of the Military
in Politics." I ler classes enjoyed the political
simulations she conducted, and students later
praised her intelligence and ability to synthe
size information.
"She was always extremely prepared as an
instructor and a lecturer," said Chris Aguas
•92. "She very clearly had a deep intimacy
with the material in terms of the historical
basis."
But it was her personable nature that
drew many undergraduates to Rice. Her will
ingness to talk with students about every
thing from classes to football built her a fol
lowing in the political science department.
"She was approachable; she was extreme
ly caring and warm and kind and [had] all
sorts of qualities that 1 wouldn't have neces
sarily expected in an advisor or professor,"
said Erin Alaimo '88, who would later work
in Washington. "She had a truly profound
impact on my life, my career."
Emmanuel Bart-Plange "93 not only took
Rice's popular lecture course, but also stud
ied with her in directed readings. (He joked
he's still bitter about his A- grades.) The foot
ball player would also work with Rice and
her father at The Center for a New
Generation, an after-school enrichment pro
gram for East Palo Alto students that Rice
co-founded.
For Bart-Plange, Rice was more than an
ordinary professor. She kept in touch with
him over the years, and even got to know his
mother.
"When I got married she sent me a gift
with a card from the White House," he said.
"She didn't have to do that, and she did."
Her love of sports and music enabled
many students to relate to Rice on a person
al level as well. Alan Brown '85, an advisee of
Rice's, said that he talked with the professor
about football as much as the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan.
"It's hard sometimes for kids to approach
a Stanford professor," he said. "I never felt
that with Prof. Rice. You could question any
thing. you could discuss anything. She was
open to ideas as opposed to spewing some
thing she'd already written."
"Her office door was always open, if 1 ever
needed to talk about a paper I was writing or
classes 1 was taking," added Eric Abrams '85.
another advisee. "It was really cool to engage
her in conversation about things outside of
academia. She was a huge football fan."
These personal connections have changed
how many of Rice's former students feel
about her time in the unpopular Bush admin
istration. Most jumped to her defense, saying
they fully believed that she did what she
thought was right for the country and
believed her intelligence enabled her to
make the best decisions possible.
"My feeling is she will be judged favorably
as someone who did the best job that she pos
sibly could have," Alaimo said. "I have never
known her not to do the best job. not to put
her absolute everything into everything she's
ever done."
And while some students are disappoint
ed with her political legacy, their memories of
Rice as a professor remain untarnished.
"She was absolutely one of my favorite
professors, maybe in the top two or three in
the whole time I was there." said Edward
Anderson '91. "I think it's unfortunate that
she had such a long association with the Bush
administration, but I was excited to see her
get into politics and do so well. Over time I've
respected her less, but she's obviously an
incredible person."
The Young Professor
Many professors, too. would look fondly
on Rice's early time at Stanford, even those
who would later go on to criticize her tenure
as provost.
"Many, many afternoons. Condi would
come out of her office, sit down at the secre
tary's desk, take off her shoes, and the two of
them would cackle," said Political Science
Prof. Emeritus I lubert Marshall, whose office
was close to Rice's. "It was just little things
like that that I liked about her."
Other professors vividly recalled fond
memories of their early exchanges with Rice.
George Shultz, former Secretary of State
under President Reagan and distinguished
fellow at the Hoover Institution, said that he
first met Rice after her stint in Washington on
the National Security Council for the first
President Bush.
"The reason why I remember | her] so
vividly is that [she] has such a capable and
interesting personality," he said. "She is fun to
be with, she's interesting, she's got a lot to say.
So. she's a person that I like to have on my list
of good friends."
History Prof. Emeritus David Kennedy
agreed and admired Rice's strong character.
"She was one of the most poised and self
possessed individuals on the face of the plan
et." he said. "That was evident to me from the
very first day that I met her. which I believe
was her first day on the campus."
Kennedy said that during Stanford's cen
tennial campaign in the late '80s and early
'90s. he often travelled with Rice to various
Stanford events and tried to envision what a
world after the Cold War might look like.
"We were a little bit ahead of our time
because the Cold War hadn't quite ended
then." he said. "I got to know her best in that
context, and I was consistently impressed
with how well-informed she was and how bal
anced her judgment was and how extraordi
narily well-spoken she was."
Earrv Diamond, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution, was also very impressed
with her poise, articulateness and ambition.
He was also surprised to hear of her political
affiliations.
"You would expect a young African-
American political science professor, espe
cially back in those days, to be a liberal
Democrat," he said, "and so, when I found
out she wasn't. I was surprised and it certain
lv made her all the more interesting."

But Rice was not without detractors in her
early years. Her time in the first Bush admin
istration and political zeal sat poorly with
some of her fellow scholars.
"1 had no negative personal interactions
with her except that I found her very early on
to be a very rigid ideologically oriented pro
fessor," said Political Science Prof. Emeritus
John Manley. "It didn't appeal to me very
much."
And while many found the young profes
sor amiable, some were less than impressed
with her scholarship.
"I'm still surprised that she would want to
return to Stanford and a professorship,"
wrote History Prof. Emeritus Paul Seaver.
who would later butt heads with Rice over
the Cultures. Ideas and Values (CIV) pro
gram. "As I understand it. Russianists did not
regard her as particularly distinguished as a
scholar, on the other hand, 1 believe that stu
dents who took her courses regarded her as a
good teacher."
Bernstein, who knew the professor from
various committees, seminars and personal
interactions, agreed.
"Condi Rice is only somewhat better than
a mediocre scholar," he said. "Her strengths
are vigorous right-wing opinionation. marked
social poise and a fluency in oral presenta
tion. Among the Stanford scholars in the
Soviet-Russian area, she would rank near the
bottom in the University. Over the years, in
my talking with at least four people in the
field, each of them would rank her at or near
the bottom and this was true before she went

to the Bush administration
and became prominent."
"Most of the people
who think she's brilliant
haven't read her. haven't
heard her, can't judge, are
being kind and are taken
in by social poise and
superficial fluency,"
Bernstein added.
Appointment as Provost
Rice's life would
change dramatically in
May 1993, when
University President
Gerhard Casper
announced that the politi
cal science professor
would take on the No. 2
job at the University:
provost. Casper met Rice
a year and a half prior,
when she was a member
of the presidential search
committee that selected
Casper.
The President told The
Daily in 1993 that he
believed her experience in
government would help
her deal with complex
issues, and that the her
selection signaled the
importance of diversity to
the University ("Casper
names Condoleezza Rice
as new provost," May 13.
1993).
In an exclusive inter
view with The Daily a few
days after. Rice praised
diversity and dismissed
her politics as irrelevant
— two issues that students
would view in a substan
tially different light in
later years ("Experienced
in the business of change,"
May 21.1993).
The first crisis Rice
would face, however, was
balancing the budget.
Soon after becoming
Provost in 1993, Rice
announced that the
University would face
massive cuts to curb
Stanford's deficit and
hoped that administrative

restructuring would solve long-term prob
lems ("Additional budget cuts looming for
University," Oct. 1,1993).
Ilie Daily reported that Rice said the situ
ation is so serious that if she were
approached "tomorrow with the greatest idea
since the silicon chip, [she'd] have to say.
'Sorry, we can't afford that.'"
The Provost would announce that she
planned to slash another $18 to $20 million
from the budget, drastically reducing central
administrative costs over the next three
years.
Budget cuts would make Rice a fair num
ber of enemies, and few departments were
pleased about the cost reduction estimates
they were asked to submit. Some faculty felt
that little was left to cut after other cuts in
recent years. Students would also complain
that they were not involved enough in the
process, to which Rice responded that the
budget "has to be on my timetable" ("Rice.
Senate discuss cuts." Feb. 2.1993).
Further controversial changes by Rice
included contracting out management of the
Faculty Club and the Stanford University
Press ("Budget stable, provost says." Nov. 11.
1996).
"1 am often asked if [in contracting out],
we are trying to run Stanford like a business."
Rice said. "The answer is no. We have to look
at ways to cut costs."
Coit Blacker, director of the Freeman
Spogli Institute and a long-time personal
friend of Rice, told The Daily last week that
the budget cuts were especially trying on the
former Provost.
"[The budget cuts| earned Provost Rice a
lot of animosity or hostility from groups that
felt that they had been targeted." he said. "So
I think it was a very difficult time for her. but
she has never been one to shy away from
making difficult decisions, if in her judgment,
they are the right decisions, and that's what
she did."

But as the years passed, budget cuts grew
less controversial. Rice sliced $6.1 million
from the budget in her first year, a figure
that decreased over the next few years. She
ultimately cut $16.8 million from the budg
et between 1994 and 1996. and the
University went on to enjoy multi-million
dollar surpluses.
The Diversity Debates
Though many lauded the pick of Rice as
"She was extremely
caring and warm and
kind and all sorts of
qualities that 1 wouldn't
have necessarily expected
in an advisor or professor."

"She was the least
collegial colleague I can
remember of any
academic 1 met at
Stanford in more than 40
years."
PAUL SEAVER,
history professor emeritus

provost as a sign of Stanford's commitment
to diversity, tension soon built between Rice
and women and minority groups on campus.
When she pushed for more U.S. born
minority faculty, some students claimed she
was fueling "anti-immigrant hysteria" ("U.S.
born hiring policy questioned," Oct. 6. 1993).
But the most heated controversy involving
Rice and diversity in her early years would
come as a result of her budget cuts. As the
budget was pared down, campus ethnic com
munity centers became wary that they would
be affected, and the Provost did little to
assuage their concerns.
Tensions boiled over at a meeting in 1994,
when Rice tried to address the community
centers' concerns, at one point drawing scoffs
from the crowd ("Skeptical crowd grills top
officials at a forum on ethnic center cuts." Jan.

13,1994).
"You don't have the standing to question
my commitment to minorities and minority
issues," Rice said at the forum. "I've been
black all my life."
At another forum the following month,
the Provost also drew snickers when she told
the audience "you have to trust me." Students
told The Daily they felt like the Provost did
not respect them, and that they feared she
had a conservative agenda. The Daily called
her "impatient, even testy" and one senior
labeled her "unprofessional, personally
insulting and obnoxious" ("Out of the loop,
students fear 'conservative agenda,'" Feb. 25,
1994).
'ITiough the ethnic centers would ultimate
ly escape budget cuts. Rice's decision to elim
inate the position of Cecilia Burciaga, associ
ate dean of Student Affairs and Casa Zapata
resident fellow (RF),drew the ire of students.
Rice claimed the dismissal of the 20-year
employee was strictly for fiscal reasons, but
the firing outraged students.
A group of students soon began a hunger
strike, with over 40 people fasting for 24
hours in the Quad, and four continuing for
three days. The strike protested Burciaga's
layoff and called on the University to better
address a number of Chicano/a issues. The
strikes ultimately ended after three days, and
the University agreed to sign a letter declar
ing its commitment to diversity ("Strike ends
after three days, agreement reached," Mav 9,
1994).
"Condi is one tough nut," said Jim Leckie,
a civil engineering profes-

sor who observed the
negotiations between fac
ulty and students. "You
would have thought she
was negotiating with the
Russians and not with stu
dents. She clearly received
her management training
in the Pentagon."
Female faculty, too.
were displeased with Rice.
Some expressed outrage
in 1993 with the decision
of the Provost's
Committee on the
Recruitment and
Retention of Women
Faculty to remove a num
ber of personal anecdotes
about discrimination from
its report. Some female
faculty suggested she was
worried about Stanford's
image; the committee
countered that quotes
were eliminated to protect
privacy.
Rice's commitment
to women faculty would
again be questioned fol
lowing the denial of tenure
to Assistant History Prof.
Karen Sawislak. Though
her department approved
her for tenure, she was
rejected by the deans of
the School of Humanities
and Sciences. Students
would form the Student
Coalition to Tenure Karen
Sawislak. though Rice
would eventually deny her
appeal in 1998, sparking
further outcry.
Women faculty would
cite Sawislak's case as one
example of the Provost's
insensitivity to their issues.
A group of female profes
sors released a report in
1998 declaring that
Stanford had a poor record
of tenuring women faculty
in recent years. Rice would
call the report "error-rid
den" and "a polemic," dis
missing their concerns
("Tenure criticized." Feb.
25,1998).

"I don't believe myself that there is a cri
sis." Rice would say at a later meeting. "I
think Stanford is a good place for women."
("Caucus reports on female profs," May 11.
1998.)
"I very strongly feel that tenure is an eval
uation." she added. "You've had seven years
to prove it. If we start to introduce affirma
tive action policies into our tenure practices,
we've entered a slippery slope."
A group of faculty and staff would go on
to submit a complaint to the U.S. Department
of Labor in November 1998. alleging gender
discrimination in University hiring and pro
motion practices including tenure. The inves
tigation did not end until December 2007,
when the Department of Labor ruled in favor
of the University.
"No one in this complaint is asking for a
preference," Sawislak said. "We're asking to
be evaluated based on our qualifications."
("Labor Dept. may probe University," Feb. 3,
1999.)
The Final Provost Years
Rice's final years as Provost would not be
free of controversy. Many of the decisions
cited as her major accomplishments would
receive mixed reactions.
While the Provost's push for graduate
housing is considered one of her achieve
ments — she fought for short-term reconfig
uration to allow more students on campus
and announced in 1998 that $15 million
would go to building long-term housing —

speaking about the protests that had

Rice's formation of introductory seminars
and Sophomore College were undoubtedly
popular enhancements to undergraduate
education. But her support of replacing the
Cultures. Ideas and Values program with
Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM) gar

In 1995, a committee supported by the

"There was a big sigh of relief

JOHN MANLEY,
political science professor emeritus

Barton Bernstein still remembers where he was
sitting — at the end of a long table. Condolee/za
Rice to his right, and three seats away from the
speaker. It was the early 1980s, and the history pro
fessor and new political science assistant professor,
respectively, had gathered at Galvez House, the
building that once housed the arms control center.
Those gathered in the room went around the
table, discussing what they wanted to accomplish in
their life. Bernstein distinctly remembers Rice sav
ing that she hoped to be Secretary of State or
National Security Advisor.
"1 remember thinking. Highly unlikely."* he
admitted over 20 years later.
Rice would go on to fulfill not one but both of
those goals. Her time in Washington would cap off
nearly two decades spent as a well-liked Stanford
professor and sometimes-controversial provost.
While her return to the Farm means a return to
some of her most beloved friends, it also marks a
return to some of her oldest enemies.
A Charismatic Lecturer
At age 19. Rice received her bachelor's degree in
political science from the University ol Denver,
where she would receive her Ph.D. in 1981 after
receiving a master's degree in the same subject from
Notre Dame.The young scholar came to Stanford in
19X1 after receiving a Ford Foundation post-doctor
al fellowship, and she began teaching as an assistant
political science professor in 1982.
Rice was tenured in 1987. becoming an associate
professor. From 1989-1991, she served as a Soviet
expert on the National Security Council, and many
lamented her parting. In a 1989 Daily article, she
was labeled a "charismatic and innovative teacher.'
and one student recalled giving the popular profes
sor a birthday cake and singing during class. ("Rice

Rice received the Gores Award for I xcellence in
Teaching in 1984 and the School of 1 lumanities and
Sciences Dean's Award for Distinguished Teaching

her early days, Rice handled dramatic budget cuts.
in 1993. Over a decade later, students still
remember her engaging lectures, particularly
in her class entitled "The Role of the Military
in Politics." I ler classes enjoyed the political
simulations she conducted, and students later
praised her intelligence and ability to synthe
size information.
"She was always extremely prepared as an
instructor and a lecturer," said Chris Aguas
•92. "She very clearly had a deep intimacy
with the material in terms of the historical
basis."
But it was her personable nature that
drew many undergraduates to Rice. Her will
ingness to talk with students about every
thing from classes to football built her a fol
lowing in the political science department.
"She was approachable; she was extreme
ly caring and warm and kind and [had] all
sorts of qualities that 1 wouldn't have neces
sarily expected in an advisor or professor,"
said Erin Alaimo '88, who would later work
in Washington. "She had a truly profound
impact on my life, my career."
Emmanuel Bart-Plange "93 not only took
Rice's popular lecture course, but also stud
ied with her in directed readings. (He joked
he's still bitter about his A- grades.) The foot
ball player would also work with Rice and
her father at The Center for a New
Generation, an after-school enrichment pro
gram for East Palo Alto students that Rice
co-founded.
For Bart-Plange, Rice was more than an
ordinary professor. She kept in touch with
him over the years, and even got to know his
mother.
"When I got married she sent me a gift
with a card from the White House," he said.
"She didn't have to do that, and she did."
Her love of sports and music enabled
many students to relate to Rice on a person
al level as well. Alan Brown '85, an advisee of
Rice's, said that he talked with the professor
about football as much as the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan.
"It's hard sometimes for kids to approach
a Stanford professor," he said. "I never felt
that with Prof. Rice. You could question any
thing. you could discuss anything. She was
open to ideas as opposed to spewing some
thing she'd already written."
"Her office door was always open, if 1 ever
needed to talk about a paper I was writing or
classes 1 was taking," added Eric Abrams '85.
another advisee. "It was really cool to engage
her in conversation about things outside of
academia. She was a huge football fan."
These personal connections have changed
how many of Rice's former students feel
about her time in the unpopular Bush admin
istration. Most jumped to her defense, saying
they fully believed that she did what she
thought was right for the country and
believed her intelligence enabled her to
make the best decisions possible.
"My feeling is she will be judged favorably
as someone who did the best job that she pos
sibly could have," Alaimo said. "I have never
known her not to do the best job. not to put
her absolute everything into everything she's
ever done."
And while some students are disappoint
ed with her political legacy, their memories of
Rice as a professor remain untarnished.
"She was absolutely one of my favorite
professors, maybe in the top two or three in
the whole time I was there." said Edward
Anderson '91. "I think it's unfortunate that
she had such a long association with the Bush
administration, but I was excited to see her
get into politics and do so well. Over time I've
respected her less, but she's obviously an
incredible person."
The Young Professor
Many professors, too. would look fondly
on Rice's early time at Stanford, even those
who would later go on to criticize her tenure
as provost.
"Many, many afternoons. Condi would
come out of her office, sit down at the secre
tary's desk, take off her shoes, and the two of
them would cackle," said Political Science
Prof. Emeritus I lubert Marshall, whose office
was close to Rice's. "It was just little things
like that that I liked about her."
Other professors vividly recalled fond
memories of their early exchanges with Rice.
George Shultz, former Secretary of State
under President Reagan and distinguished
fellow at the Hoover Institution, said that he
first met Rice after her stint in Washington on
the National Security Council for the first
President Bush.
"The reason why I remember | her] so
vividly is that [she] has such a capable and
interesting personality," he said. "She is fun to
be with, she's interesting, she's got a lot to say.
So. she's a person that I like to have on my list
of good friends."
History Prof. Emeritus David Kennedy
agreed and admired Rice's strong character.
"She was one of the most poised and self
possessed individuals on the face of the plan
et." he said. "That was evident to me from the
very first day that I met her. which I believe
was her first day on the campus."
Kennedy said that during Stanford's cen
tennial campaign in the late '80s and early
'90s. he often travelled with Rice to various
Stanford events and tried to envision what a
world after the Cold War might look like.
"We were a little bit ahead of our time
because the Cold War hadn't quite ended
then." he said. "I got to know her best in that
context, and I was consistently impressed
with how well-informed she was and how bal
anced her judgment was and how extraordi
narily well-spoken she was."
Earrv Diamond, a senior fellow at the
Hoover Institution, was also very impressed
with her poise, articulateness and ambition.
He was also surprised to hear of her political
affiliations.
"You would expect a young African-
American political science professor, espe
cially back in those days, to be a liberal
Democrat," he said, "and so, when I found
out she wasn't. I was surprised and it certain
lv made her all the more interesting."

But Rice was not without detractors in her
early years. Her time in the first Bush admin
istration and political zeal sat poorly with
some of her fellow scholars.
"1 had no negative personal interactions
with her except that I found her very early on
to be a very rigid ideologically oriented pro
fessor," said Political Science Prof. Emeritus
John Manley. "It didn't appeal to me very
much."
And while many found the young profes
sor amiable, some were less than impressed
with her scholarship.
"I'm still surprised that she would want to
return to Stanford and a professorship,"
wrote History Prof. Emeritus Paul Seaver.
who would later butt heads with Rice over
the Cultures. Ideas and Values (CIV) pro
gram. "As I understand it. Russianists did not
regard her as particularly distinguished as a
scholar, on the other hand, 1 believe that stu
dents who took her courses regarded her as a
good teacher."
Bernstein, who knew the professor from
various committees, seminars and personal
interactions, agreed.
"Condi Rice is only somewhat better than
a mediocre scholar," he said. "Her strengths
are vigorous right-wing opinionation. marked
social poise and a fluency in oral presenta
tion. Among the Stanford scholars in the
Soviet-Russian area, she would rank near the
bottom in the University. Over the years, in
my talking with at least four people in the
field, each of them would rank her at or near
the bottom and this was true before she went

to the Bush administration
and became prominent."
"Most of the people
who think she's brilliant
haven't read her. haven't
heard her, can't judge, are
being kind and are taken
in by social poise and
superficial fluency,"
Bernstein added.
Appointment as Provost
Rice's life would
change dramatically in
May 1993, when
University President
Gerhard Casper
announced that the politi
cal science professor
would take on the No. 2
job at the University:
provost. Casper met Rice
a year and a half prior,
when she was a member
of the presidential search
committee that selected
Casper.
The President told The
Daily in 1993 that he
believed her experience in
government would help
her deal with complex
issues, and that the her
selection signaled the
importance of diversity to
the University ("Casper
names Condoleezza Rice
as new provost," May 13.
1993).
In an exclusive inter
view with The Daily a few
days after. Rice praised
diversity and dismissed
her politics as irrelevant
— two issues that students
would view in a substan
tially different light in
later years ("Experienced
in the business of change,"
May 21.1993).
The first crisis Rice
would face, however, was
balancing the budget.
Soon after becoming
Provost in 1993, Rice
announced that the
University would face
massive cuts to curb
Stanford's deficit and
hoped that administrative

restructuring would solve long-term prob
lems ("Additional budget cuts looming for
University," Oct. 1,1993).
Ilie Daily reported that Rice said the situ
ation is so serious that if she were
approached "tomorrow with the greatest idea
since the silicon chip, [she'd] have to say.
'Sorry, we can't afford that.'"
The Provost would announce that she
planned to slash another $18 to $20 million
from the budget, drastically reducing central
administrative costs over the next three
years.
Budget cuts would make Rice a fair num
ber of enemies, and few departments were
pleased about the cost reduction estimates
they were asked to submit. Some faculty felt
that little was left to cut after other cuts in
recent years. Students would also complain
that they were not involved enough in the
process, to which Rice responded that the
budget "has to be on my timetable" ("Rice.
Senate discuss cuts." Feb. 2.1993).
Further controversial changes by Rice
included contracting out management of the
Faculty Club and the Stanford University
Press ("Budget stable, provost says." Nov. 11.
1996).
"1 am often asked if [in contracting out],
we are trying to run Stanford like a business."
Rice said. "The answer is no. We have to look
at ways to cut costs."
Coit Blacker, director of the Freeman
Spogli Institute and a long-time personal
friend of Rice, told The Daily last week that
the budget cuts were especially trying on the
former Provost.
"[The budget cuts| earned Provost Rice a
lot of animosity or hostility from groups that
felt that they had been targeted." he said. "So
I think it was a very difficult time for her. but
she has never been one to shy away from
making difficult decisions, if in her judgment,
they are the right decisions, and that's what
she did."

But as the years passed, budget cuts grew
less controversial. Rice sliced $6.1 million
from the budget in her first year, a figure
that decreased over the next few years. She
ultimately cut $16.8 million from the budg
et between 1994 and 1996. and the
University went on to enjoy multi-million
dollar surpluses.
The Diversity Debates
Though many lauded the pick of Rice as
"She was extremely
caring and warm and
kind and all sorts of
qualities that 1 wouldn't
have necessarily expected
in an advisor or professor."
— ERIN ALAIMO W

"She was the least
collegial colleague I can
remember of any
academic 1 met at
Stanford in more than 40
years."
PAUL SEAVER,
history professor emeritus

provost as a sign of Stanford's commitment
to diversity, tension soon built between Rice
and women and minority groups on campus.
When she pushed for more U.S. born
minority faculty, some students claimed she
was fueling "anti-immigrant hysteria" ("U.S.
born hiring policy questioned," Oct. 6. 1993).
But the most heated controversy involving
Rice and diversity in her early years would
come as a result of her budget cuts. As the
budget was pared down, campus ethnic com
munity centers became wary that they would
be affected, and the Provost did little to
assuage their concerns.
Tensions boiled over at a meeting in 1994,
when Rice tried to address the community
centers' concerns, at one point drawing scoffs
from the crowd ("Skeptical crowd grills top
officials at a forum on ethnic center cuts." Jan.

13,1994).
"You don't have the standing to question
my commitment to minorities and minority
issues," Rice said at the forum. "I've been
black all my life."
At another forum the following month,
the Provost also drew snickers when she told
the audience "you have to trust me." Students
told The Daily they felt like the Provost did
not respect them, and that they feared she
had a conservative agenda. The Daily called
her "impatient, even testy" and one senior
labeled her "unprofessional, personally
insulting and obnoxious" ("Out of the loop,
students fear 'conservative agenda,'" Feb. 25,
1994).
'ITiough the ethnic centers would ultimate
ly escape budget cuts. Rice's decision to elim
inate the position of Cecilia Burciaga, associ
ate dean of Student Affairs and Casa Zapata
resident fellow (RF),drew the ire of students.
Rice claimed the dismissal of the 20-year
employee was strictly for fiscal reasons, but
the firing outraged students.
A group of students soon began a hunger
strike, with over 40 people fasting for 24
hours in the Quad, and four continuing for
three days. The strike protested Burciaga's
layoff and called on the University to better
address a number of Chicano/a issues. The
strikes ultimately ended after three days, and
the University agreed to sign a letter declar
ing its commitment to diversity ("Strike ends
after three days, agreement reached," Mav 9,
1994).
"Condi is one tough nut," said Jim Leckie,
a civil engineering profes-

sor who observed the
negotiations between fac
ulty and students. "You
would have thought she
was negotiating with the
Russians and not with stu
dents. She clearly received
her management training
in the Pentagon."
Female faculty, too.
were displeased with Rice.
Some expressed outrage
in 1993 with the decision
of the Provost's
Committee on the
Recruitment and
Retention of Women
Faculty to remove a num
ber of personal anecdotes
about discrimination from
its report. Some female
faculty suggested she was
worried about Stanford's
image; the committee
countered that quotes
were eliminated to protect
privacy.
Rice's commitment
to women faculty would
again be questioned fol
lowing the denial of tenure
to Assistant History Prof.
Karen Sawislak. Though
her department approved
her for tenure, she was
rejected by the deans of
the School of Humanities
and Sciences. Students
would form the Student
Coalition to Tenure Karen
Sawislak. though Rice
would eventually deny her
appeal in 1998, sparking
further outcry.
Women faculty would
cite Sawislak's case as one
example of the Provost's
insensitivity to their issues.
A group of female profes
sors released a report in
1998 declaring that
Stanford had a poor record
of tenuring women faculty
in recent years. Rice would
call the report "error-rid
den" and "a polemic," dis
missing their concerns
("Tenure criticized." Feb.
25,1998).

"I don't believe myself that there is a cri
sis." Rice would say at a later meeting. "I
think Stanford is a good place for women."
("Caucus reports on female profs," May 11.
1998.)
"I very strongly feel that tenure is an eval
uation." she added. "You've had seven years
to prove it. If we start to introduce affirma
tive action policies into our tenure practices,
we've entered a slippery slope."
A group of faculty and staff would go on
to submit a complaint to the U.S. Department
of Labor in November 1998. alleging gender
discrimination in University hiring and pro
motion practices including tenure. The inves
tigation did not end until December 2007,
when the Department of Labor ruled in favor
of the University.
"No one in this complaint is asking for a
preference," Sawislak said. "We're asking to
be evaluated based on our qualifications."
("Labor Dept. may probe University," Feb. 3,
1999.)
The Final Provost Years
Rice's final years as Provost would not be
free of controversy. Many of the decisions
cited as her major accomplishments would
receive mixed reactions.
While the Provost's push for graduate
housing is considered one of her achieve
ments — she fought for short-term reconfig
uration to allow more students on campus
and announced in 1998 that $15 million
would go to building long-term housing —
students at the time were not fully satisfied.
In May 1998, over 1 (K) graduate students
camped out in the quad to protest lack of
adequate housing options. Her attitude
rubbed some students the wrong way.
"I didn't need students on the Quad to tell
me that there was a housing problem." Rice
later remarked ("Room for protest on cam
pus?" Oct. 6. 1998).
"People protesting in the Quad would

MAJOR DECISIONS AS
PROVOST:

■ Slashing the University budget by $16.8
million between 1994 and 1996
■ Eliminating the position of Cecilia
Burciaga, associate dean of Student
Affairs and Casa Zapata resident fellow
in 1994
| Denial of tenure to Assistant History Prof.
Karen Sawislak in 1998
| Making a commitment to expanding
graduate housing in 1998
| Formation of Sophomore College in
1995
| Creation of introductory seminars in
1997
| Replacing Cultures, Ideas and Values
(CIV) with Introduction to the Humanities
(IHUM) in 2000

never get me or, I think I can speak for
Gerhard [Casper] too, to do something that
we wouldn't do —to violate our personal
principles or to do something that is not in
the interest of the University," Rice added,
speaking about the protests that had
occurred in recent years.
Rice's formation of introductory seminars
and Sophomore College were undoubtedly
popular enhancements to undergraduate
education. But her support of replacing the
Cultures. Ideas and Values program with
Introduction to the Humanities (IHUM) gar
nered mixed reactions.
In 1995, a committee supported by the
Provost began to reevaluate the CIV pro
gram. which received varied responses from
students, some of whom complained about
the excessive yet superficial reading. Some
professors vehemently objected to the evalu
ation process, and History Prof. Carolyn
Lougee Chappell complained it was shroud
ed in secrecy ("CIV professors object to
shortening program." May 29.1996").
Although the CIV committee began
meeting in October 1995, the first meeting
held with CIV faculty to discuss their con
cerns took place a full year later.
"Instead of CIV faculty and student-pro
pelled changes, the push is coming from the
top down." Lougee Chappell said. " This
administration wants to do away with every
thing that was in place before they came to
makeover the University's image."
("Students award C IV high marks," Jan. 27.
1997.)
History Prof. Emeritus Paul Seaver peti
tioned the committee's review, saying it was
inadequate, but to no avail — IHUM was
fully implemented in 2(XH).
"1 was always glad that I had tenure,"
Seaver said. "Otherwise I would have been
out on my ear for refusing to be a team play
er' in my unsuccessful defense of the fresh
man CIV program."
His battles with Rice over CIV scarred his
impression of her.
"She was the least collegial colleague I can
remember of any academic I met at Stanford
in more than 40 years," Seaver recently said
to The Daily. "Her style was authoritarian;
she had no time for faculty governance.
Hence committees were regarded as a waste
of time, told what to do rather than consult
ed. and constituted of those too intimidated
to stand up to her bullying; given her control
of the budget, faculty were relatively easy to
intimidate."
Resignation
In December 1998, Rice announced that
she would step down as Provost the following
summer. Casper and others heaped praise on
the departing Provost, as did a number of
other faculty. But others were less enthused.
"I think most people were happy to see
her leave once Bush stole the first election in
2(HK)." Political Science Prof. Emeritus John
Manley told The Daily. "There was a big sigh
of relief in many quarters because she had
not been a popular provost."
"Her role as provost was very authoritari
an, very rigid, very dogmatic and not well
appreciated by the people with whom she
had to interact," he added.
History Prof. Barton Bernstein agreed.
"Almost everybody I know who dealt with
her came away annoyed, if not angry," he
said. "One heard of various tales where she
would get a long report from somebody, one
of the deans, and send it back within hours
with a one-word to one-sentence negative."
"I liked Condi when she was without
power." he added. "I found her pleasant, try
ing to grow, not very well educated, but eager
to know. As she gained power, I found her
arrogant, not any smarter, not likely to do her
homework, but ferociously opinionated and
willing to impose her dictates. She's a very
authoritarian person, although she's probably
very good at sucking up to power."
At the time. Rice dismissed rumors that
she would assist George Bush in his run for
the presidency and said she was hesitant to
return to government. That would all change,
of course, and Rice would go on to support
Bush and become his National Security
Advisor. Long before the world would
debate her performance in that role and as
Secretary of State, Stanford was deeply
affected by the popular professor and often
controversial Provost.
Looking back. Blacker suggested that no
one was surprised that Rice would go into
politics.
"1 think both by temperament and inclina
tion. Secretary Rice is on the activist end of
the spectrum in the academic world," he said.
"Plus, it's hard to say no when the President
asks you to do something."
