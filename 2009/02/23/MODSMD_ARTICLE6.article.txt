# SIXTH MAN MELTDOWN
## 
### BY JACOB JOHNSON DESK EDITOR 
Stanford Athletics will sell seats in
Section 13 of Maples Pavilion for
the men's basketball games against
No. 20 UCLA and I JSC this week
end.
Tickets in this section will only be avail
able to season-ticket holders and
Buck/Cardinal Club members. Section 13
was previously reserved for Sixth Man mem
bers. provoking an outcry from sections of
the student body.
The Sixth Man is organized and run by
students, with assistance from the Stanford
men's basketball program. Last Tuesday, the

athletic department announced that the
Sicth Man will be restricted to Sections 9-12.
The Stanford Band usually occupies Section
l ). but there is room for some Sixth Man
members as well.
On Wednesday, Sixth Man Managing
Director Alexis I ink '10 released a state
ment to the group's email list, protesting the
decision. Hie email included a survey in
which students, alumni. University employ
ees and others were asked to respond to the
athletic department's decision. One of the
questions asked students if the decision lo
sell seats in Section 13 to season-ticket hold
ers and donors bothered them. With 1000
votes tallied. 89.5 percent of respondents
said,"Yes, it is a student section."
Furthermore. Link claimed that she and

the other Sixth Man organizers were not
informed by the Athletic Department of the
coming sale.
"I was never informed bv the members of
the athletic department who were responsi
ble for this decision " I ink wrote in an email
to The Daily on Friday. She claimed she
found out about the sale of tickets in Section
13 from a member of the men's basketball
program and was never directly contacted.
"There were discussions earlier in the
season regarding selling Section 13 to the
Buck Cardinal Club," Link admitted.
However, she said the idea was "shot down
completely after vehement Opposition from
both the Sixth Man Committee and the


MASARU OKA/The Stanford Doily
With a near-empty Sixth Man section at men's basketball games throughout the season, the
athletic department decided to open Section 13 to season ticket holders.

Men's Basketball Office. Further, the
condition at that time for selling these
seats rested on filling the section for the
Cal game, which occurred."
The athletic department claimed
that Link and the Sixth Man leader
ship were informed in January that
such a move was in the works. On Fri
day, Associate Athletic Director Chris
Hutchins responded to Link's com
ments.
"Her email that went out saying
there has been no communication is
inaccurate." said Hutchins, who is in
charge of the athletic department's
External Relations."l am disappoint
ed, because that is not the case. Alex
is Link has been involved in those dis
cussions."
"We did share with her that our
intent was to sell Section 13,"
Hutchins continued. "In January
when we met with [the Sixth Man or
ganizers], we said 'This is something
we are going to do.' but they said
'Give us a chance to sell [more tickets
in the Sixth Man section].'"
Stanford Athletics claimed that the
problem is low student attendance. In
the 2005-2006 men's basketball sea
son. nearly 2(XX) students signed up to
be part of the Sixth Man Club. Since
then, those numbers have steadily de
clined. 1303 people signed up last year.
In 2008-2009, there are only 648 Sixth
Man members.
The actual attendance numbers for
this season are even worse. Attendance
has declined throughout the year —
only 324 Sixth Man members showed
up for the Cal game on Jan. 17.
According to the athletic depart
ment, Sections 9-12 can accommo
date all of the 648 Sixth Man mem
bers and the Band — with room left
over for students who buy individual
game tickets.
Link said that selling seats in Sec
tion 13 is "irresponsible," noting that
"these two games [against UCLA and
USC] have historically been two of the
biggest, if not the biggest, home games
on our schedule for student atten
dance."
To Hutchins,that argument doesn't
hold much water. Before the Cal game,
"that was the same statement they
made."
"The numbers have spoken for
themselves*" Hutchins concluded.
Representatives from Stanford
Athletics said that financial motiva
tions had little to do with the decision.
It was all about filling seats and sup

porting the men's basketball team.
"It is important for coach [Johnny]
Dawkins and the men's basketball
program to have that area filled."
Hutchins said.
"We want nothing more than Sec
tions 9-13 to be absolutely filled with
students," she added."The passion that
comes out of those students —we
want them to be there."
Earl Koberlein played basketball
tor the Cardinal 1982-1986, returning
to the Farm in 1993 as an administra
tive assistant to former coach Mike
Montgomery. Just a year earlier, the
men's team had suffered through an
atrocious 7-23 season and finished 2-12
in the Pacific-10 Conference. Kober
lein helped start the Sixth Man club in
1 993 to win back student support.
"We said, "We've got to do some
thing to get students back,"" he said.
"We were almost paying them to come
back. We were pretty much bribing
them to come."
With active participation from the
coaching staff and players, the Sixth
Man steadily grew and became one of
the most intimidating cheering sections
in college basketball.
"It's awesome when you hear some
one like [ex-Arizona coach] Lute
Olson say Stanford is one of the tough
est places to play in the Pac-10," said
Koberlein. now the associate athletic
director for Intercollegiate Sports.
"We've got to get it back to that."
It was suggested that the 2009
team's disappointing performance has
led to the decline in attendance. Kober
lein doesn't think that is the case.
"I don't think so," he said."Look at
the Cal game. At the time we were
[11-3]."
Yet, the Sixth Man section was less
than half full.
"It's embarrassing how sparse it
was," he lamented.
Koberlein doesn't blame student ap
athy alone for the decline in Sixth Man
attendance. He admitted that the ath
letic department did not do a good job
promoting the team and rallying stu
dent support.
"We had to do a better job of getting
the word out." he said. "We didn't do a
g<xxl enough job promoting Sixth Man
as we had in the past."

on rhursday, and the Cardinal tips off
against USC at 5 p.m. on Saturday.

External Relations."l am disappoint
ed, because that is not the case. Alex
is Link has been involved in those dis
cussions."
"We did share with her that our
intent was to sell Section 13,"
Hutchins continued. "In January
when we met with [the Sixth Man or
ganizers], we said 'This is something
we are going to do.' but they said
'Give us a chance to sell [more tickets
in the Sixth Man section].'"
Stanford Athletics claimed that the
problem is low student attendance. In
the 2005-2006 men's basketball sea
son. nearly 2(XX) students signed up to
be part of the Sixth Man Club. Since
then, those numbers have steadily de
clined. 1303 people signed up last year.
In 2008-2009, there are only 648 Sixth
Man members.
The actual attendance numbers for
this season are even worse. Attendance
has declined throughout the year —
only 324 Sixth Man members showed
up for the Cal game on Jan. 17.
According to the athletic depart
ment, Sections 9-12 can accommo
date all of the 648 Sixth Man mem
bers and the Band — with room left
over for students who buy individual
game tickets.
Link said that selling seats in Sec
tion 13 is "irresponsible," noting that
"these two games [against UCLA and
USC] have historically been two of the
biggest, if not the biggest, home games
on our schedule for student atten
dance."
To Hutchins,that argument doesn't
hold much water. Before the Cal game,
"that was the same statement they
made."
"The numbers have spoken for
themselves*" Hutchins concluded.
Representatives from Stanford
Athletics said that financial motiva
tions had little to do with the decision.
It was all about filling seats and sup

porting the men's basketball team.
"It is important for coach [Johnny]
Dawkins and the men's basketball
program to have that area filled."
Hutchins said.
"We want nothing more than Sec
tions 9-13 to be absolutely filled with
students," she added."The passion that
comes out of those students —we
want them to be there."
Earl Koberlein played basketball
tor the Cardinal 1982-1986, returning
to the Farm in 1993 as an administra
tive assistant to former coach Mike
Montgomery. Just a year earlier, the
men's team had suffered through an
atrocious 7-23 season and finished 2-12
in the Pacific-10 Conference. Kober
lein helped start the Sixth Man club in
1 993 to win back student support.
"We said, "We've got to do some
thing to get students back,"" he said.
"We were almost paying them to come
back. We were pretty much bribing
them to come."
With active participation from the
coaching staff and players, the Sixth
Man steadily grew and became one of
the most intimidating cheering sections
in college basketball.
"It's awesome when you hear some
one like [ex-Arizona coach] Lute
Olson say Stanford is one of the tough
est places to play in the Pac-10," said
Koberlein. now the associate athletic
director for Intercollegiate Sports.
"We've got to get it back to that."
It was suggested that the 2009
team's disappointing performance has
led to the decline in attendance. Kober
lein doesn't think that is the case.
"I don't think so," he said."Look at
the Cal game. At the time we were
[11-3]."
Yet, the Sixth Man section was less
than half full.
"It's embarrassing how sparse it
was," he lamented.
Koberlein doesn't blame student ap
athy alone for the decline in Sixth Man
attendance. He admitted that the ath
letic department did not do a good job
promoting the team and rallying stu
dent support.
"We had to do a better job of getting
the word out." he said. "We didn't do a
g<xxl enough job promoting Sixth Man
as we had in the past."

Stanford Athletics will sell seats in
Section 13 of Maples Pavilion for
the men's basketball games against
No. 20 UCLA and I JSC this week
end.
Tickets in this section will only be avail
able to season-ticket holders and
Buck/Cardinal Club members. Section 13
was previously reserved for Sixth Man mem
bers. provoking an outcry from sections of
the student body.
The Sixth Man is organized and run by
students, with assistance from the Stanford
men's basketball program. Last Tuesday, the

athletic department announced that the
Sicth Man will be restricted to Sections 9-12.
The Stanford Band usually occupies Section
l ). but there is room for some Sixth Man
members as well.
On Wednesday, Sixth Man Managing
Director Alexis I ink '10 released a state
ment to the group's email list, protesting the
decision. Hie email included a survey in
which students, alumni. University employ
ees and others were asked to respond to the
athletic department's decision. One of the
questions asked students if the decision lo
sell seats in Section 13 to season-ticket hold
ers and donors bothered them. With 1000
votes tallied. 89.5 percent of respondents
said,"Yes, it is a student section."
Furthermore. Link claimed that she and

the other Sixth Man organizers were not
informed by the Athletic Department of the
coming sale.
"I was never informed bv the members of
the athletic department who were responsi
ble for this decision " I ink wrote in an email
to The Daily on Friday. She claimed she
found out about the sale of tickets in Section
13 from a member of the men's basketball
program and was never directly contacted.
"There were discussions earlier in the
season regarding selling Section 13 to the
Buck Cardinal Club," Link admitted.
However, she said the idea was "shot down
completely after vehement Opposition from
both the Sixth Man Committee and the

With a near-empty Sixth Man section at men's basketball games throughout the season, the
athletic department decided to open Section 13 to season ticket holders.

The athletic department claimed
that Link and the Sixth Man leader
ship were informed in January that
such a move was in the works. On Fri
day, Associate Athletic Director Chris

ments.
