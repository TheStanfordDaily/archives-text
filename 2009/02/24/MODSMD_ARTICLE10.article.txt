# Creep Space
## Although deemed sketchy and messy, some students stick with MySpace 
### E. BLAIR LAING STAFF WRITER 
Most of us remember
the days of MySpace
back in high school,
when suddenly instant
messaging just wasn't
cool enough.
"One day you didn't know it exist
ed, and the next day everybody had
it," recalled Janelle Leatherwood '10.
. "I got it when my friends got it.""I
*"I got one because everybody else
had one," agreed Caroline Watts '10.
"It was the hip thing to do."
"Because everyone else did"
But who actually uses MySpace
anymore? It seems like nowadays the
only people who still use MySpace are
young kids and sex offenders. That's
• probably not just because MySpace
- has some inherent attraction to the
young or the perverted, although cer

tain features might be more attractive
to younger crowds. It also seems as
though older, college-aged kids have
abandoned their old MySpace
accounts in favor of Facebook.
"Back in the day when Facebook
was just a college thing, high school
kids needed to have a networking
site, too," explained Pra
Chandrasoma '09. "I got one because
everyone else did."
When Chandrasoma reached col
lege and was able to get a Facebook
profile instead, he switched.
"I got a Facebook profile and for
some reason I felt safer, like it was
more legit," Chandrasoma said. "I let
my MySpace go by the wayside."
As Professor B.J. Fogg, who works
on persuasive technology, explained,
"Facebook was designed from the
start for college students, so it's a bet
ter fit for Stanford students than other
services."
But there are pluses to retaining a
MySpace page. Both Watts and

Leatherwood put a fair amount of
time into their MySpace profiles in
high school, and enjoyed the aesthetic
freedom. Myspace offers much more
flexibility in page design than
Facebook. with colors, backgrounds,
songs, videos and more.
But she now considers this aspect
just an "extra" which she was fine giv
ing up when she switched.
"Facebook isn't really a visual
pleasure, the way MySpace was."
Leatherwood said, "but MySpace
creeped me out."
The Sketchy Factor
The "creep out" factor seems to be
one of main concerns about MySpace
which may have damaged its reputa
tion among college-age kids.There is a
general understanding that MySpace
is less private than Facebook, since
Facebook was originally only open to
college kids. Of course, this has
changed now, but the "sketchy"
stereotype seems stuck to MySpace.
"On Facebook, I know who's look
ing at my profile," Leatherwood said.
"MySpace is so sketchy."
Watts had a similar reaction to
MySpace, especially when she
received messages from strangers.
"MySpace is weird," she said.

"People just contact you. Facebook is
less sketchy. And now that we're in the
age of Facebook, you actually have to
think about privacy."
Privacy concerns are a big factor
for switching to Facebook, Fogg
noted.
"Facebook is the 'high-trust' place
to be," he explained.
Chandrasoma, however, had a dif
ferent problem with his MySpace.
Instead of worrying about who was
viewing his profile, he had to worry
about who was messing with it.
"My MySpace profile got hacked a
lot," he said. "My Facebook never got
hacked. It's just better run. with better
aesthetics and a better interface.
MySpace is just sketch."
Despite his personal dislike for
MySpace. Chandrasome and his band
members created a page for their
band Occam's Razor.
"It's conventional wisdom for
bands," he noted.
Fagan Harris '()9, ASSII vice presi -
dent and a member of Occam's
Razor, agreed.
"There are many notable exam
ples of bands who have made it on
MySpace," Harris pointed out. "There
is an online scene; it's great for net
working."

Networking

networking seems to he a key

they will use. For

place to be discovered,
and for most students.

as with Watts and Leatherwood. it was
only natural to get a Facebook page
because all of their friends had one.
"What's the point of using a serv
ice your friends don't use?" Fogg
probed. "When it comes to social net
working, the leading service will
become even more dominant."
This seems to be the case regarding
Facebook and MySpace. As college
students have embraced Facebook
accounts, many have stopped using
MySpace — and the trend is spread
ing.
"The people that I interact with
more are on Facebook," Watts noted.
But for some. MySpace remains a
major network. Victoria Whittaker W
stili uses both her MySpace and her
Facebook to keep in touch with
friends.
"Most of my friends from home
don't have Facebook; they have
MySpace." Whittaker said. "But

MySpace is more annoying, and I def
initely use my Facehook more."
Still, she checks both of her pages
multiple times a day.
Ultimately, there seems to be a
sense that many factors have come
together to make Facehcxik the social
networking site of choice for Stanford
students. MySpace is often regarded
as sketchy, while Facebook seems
saler and more private. Facebook has
also become the place to network,
making MySpace somewhat of an
antique.
"Facebook is just a superior plat
form in this environment," Harris
said. "It's more elegant, less cluttered,
and more of a tool vou can use."

Chandrasoma, however, had a dif
ferent problem with his MySpace.
Instead of worrying about who was
viewing his profile, he had to worry
about who was messing with it.
"My MySpace profile got hacked a
lot," he said. "My Facebook never got
hacked. It's just better run. with better
aesthetics and a better interface.
MySpace is just sketch."
Despite his personal dislike for
MySpace. Chandrasome and his band
members created a page for their
band Occam's Razor.
"It's conventional wisdom for
bands," he noted.
Fagan Harris '()9, ASSII vice presi -
dent and a member of Occam's
Razor, agreed.
"There are many notable exam
ples of bands who have made it on
MySpace," Harris pointed out. "There
is an online scene; it's great for net
working."

Networking
I low effective each site is for
networking seems to he a key

factor in how students

determine which site
they will use. For
bands, MySpace is the
place to be discovered,
and for most students.

as with Watts and Leatherwood. it was
only natural to get a Facebook page
because all of their friends had one.
"What's the point of using a serv
ice your friends don't use?" Fogg
probed. "When it comes to social net
working, the leading service will
become even more dominant."
This seems to be the case regarding
Facebook and MySpace. As college
students have embraced Facebook
accounts, many have stopped using
MySpace — and the trend is spread
ing.
"The people that I interact with
more are on Facebook," Watts noted.
But for some. MySpace remains a
major network. Victoria Whittaker W
stili uses both her MySpace and her
Facebook to keep in touch with
friends.
"Most of my friends from home
don't have Facebook; they have
MySpace." Whittaker said. "But

MySpace is more annoying, and I def
initely use my Facehook more."
Still, she checks both of her pages
multiple times a day.
Ultimately, there seems to be a
sense that many factors have come
together to make Facehcxik the social
networking site of choice for Stanford
students. MySpace is often regarded
as sketchy, while Facebook seems
saler and more private. Facebook has
also become the place to network,
making MySpace somewhat of an
antique.
"Facebook is just a superior plat
form in this environment," Harris
said. "It's more elegant, less cluttered,
and more of a tool vou can use."
