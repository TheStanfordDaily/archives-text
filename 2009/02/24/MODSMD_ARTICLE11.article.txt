## Editorial Condoleezza Rice's return can be Stanford's gain 
### 
As former Provost, National Security
Advisor and Secretary of State Con
doleezza Rice makes her return to
Stanford, students and faculty across campus
are voicing objections that beg the question:
Should the University have taken action to
prevent her return? The editorial board be
lieves that Stanford is right in welcoming her
back and that much can be gained from her
presence.
Perhaps the biggest argument against the
University's decision — one that is both seri
ous and legitimate — is the accusation that
Rice violated U.S. law and the Constitution in
approving what many regard as the torture of
U.S. detainees. As the Stanford Progressive
pointed out last month, waterboarding
which the Bush administration approved and
enacted — was a prime example of Japanese
torture of American soldiers during World
War II that the U.S. government cited after
the war. History tells us the US. did not al
ways look upon waterboarding as an appro
priate interrogation tactic and yet Bush ad
ministration officials such as Rice, who has
said the administration has never condoned
torture, disagree.
Indeed, in 2002 the Justice Department
put out a memo noting that torture "must be
equivalent in intensity to the pain accompa
nying serious physical injury, such as organ
failure, impairment of bodily function or
even death." Many have and will continue to
take issue with this definition, and may even
argue that it violates the Eighth Amendment
of the ( (institution. which prohibits cruel and
unusual punishment, as well as federal and
international laws.
In supporting the I Iniversity's decision to
accept Rice back on campus, the editorial
board is not summarily dismissing the very
serious claims made by students and organi
zations on campus that Rice's actions violat
ed the Constitution, but it is important to
keep in mind that verdicts regarding crimes
against I '.S. law or the ( onstitution are deliv
ered in courts, not classrooms.
Ultimately, our leaders make many deci
sions that we may question on constitutional
grounds, such as the Obama administration's
recent decision to continue the Bush policy of
depriving some suspected terrorist detainees
from redress in court. Yet it seems doubtful
that anyone would question President
()bama's right to speak at Stanford in the way
that some are questioning Rice's right to be
here. A university should only make a decision
as serious as stripping a professor of tenure in
accordance with set procedure and with a
broad — though not entirely unbounded
protection for academic freedom.
While many of Rice's actions will be
called into question, we must remember that
Rice was a government servant who was ap
pointed by the President. As much as critics
of Stanford's decision will argue that calling
upon the I University to rescind Rice's tenure
is not about politics but about her actions.the

fact remains that rescinding tenure or failing
to welcome Rice back will send a message to
all Stanford professors who are now in or
considering public service: do so at your own
risk. Public service is necessarily tied to the
political sphere, which can be subject to tor
rents of popular criticism and disapproval.
Allowing such criticism to affect tenure
would make any professor hesitate to serve,
especially in such a high-profile position.
And while we feel Rice deserves to come
back to Stanford on her own accord, the edi
torial board also wants to emphasize what
the Stanford community stands to gain from
her return. She will write a book about her
foreign policy experiences and a book about
her parents and the role of educators. She has
said she would like to quickly return to and
extend her activities in support of K-12 edu
cation, which include the Center for a New
Generation, which she started in East Palo
Alto to provide students the academy expe
rience that helps them reach their lull poten
tial. Commendably.she has also expressed in
terest in getting out amongst the students
and visiting dorms to have dinner and ques
tion-and-answer sessions as a way to reen
gage with the campus, as well as teach semi
nars or guest lecture informally.
Stanford also benefit from Rice's unique
position as an academic-turned-policymak
er. In the coming years, she will discuss and
engage in debate on all the issues that will
come to define the legacy of the Bush admin
istration. As she herself pointed out. she will
oversee many of the dissertations at Stanford
discussing the mistakes that were made, and
having her on campus to engage in this de
bate will prove invaluable in advancing the
discussion. Popular or unpopular. Rice has
much to teach the Stanford community.
This editorial is not meant to suggest we
should ignore Rice's role and policies, or re
fuse to debate their legitimacy. We should de
bate them. And Rice has already indicated in
her interview with the Stanford Report that
she will "absolutely" engage with her critics
and be open to debate surrounding the ideas
she promoted and the decisions she made in
Washington. We encourage her to engage
with her deepest critics, including groups like
Amnesty International. Stanford Students
Say No to War and The Stanford Progressive.
But it is important for Stanford to foster an
environment of discourse that actually pro
motes discourse, and this means engaging in
a respectful dialogue with Rice, free from a
hostility that would necessarily fail it) elicit
thoughtful discussion.
Eegality and constitutionality are things
the Stanford faculty should certainly discuss,
but not for the University administration to
decide. So let's start the conversation, re
membering that it is one that should be had
— respectfully.
