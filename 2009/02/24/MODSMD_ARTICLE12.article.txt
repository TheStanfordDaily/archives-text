## "Vagina Monologues" performance strays from V-Day ideal 
### 
As a feminist studies major and a
Women's Community Center staff
member. I think about vaginas a lot. 1
also think about domestic violence, maternal
mortality, sex trafficking of women and girls,
sexual assault in times of war and of peace,
the spread ol 111 V and other issues that re
late to global gender imbalances on a daily
basis. But I reali/e that I may be in the mi
nority. which is why programs like "The
Vagina Monologues" and V-Week are vital
to bring awareness to these issues.
I walked in to my fourth viewing of "The
Vagina Monologues" with a lot of excite
ment. I was expecting to see a beautiful,
funny and ultimately moving and educa
tional piece of art that subtly elucidates
through poignant personal narrative the
prevalence of issues surrounding gender in
our everyday society. As l.ve I nsler. the
woman who wrote "The Vagina Mono
logues." said. "The purpose of the piece
changed from a celebration ol vaginas and
femininity to a movement to stop violence
against women." Today. V Day is a global
movement to stop violence against women
and girls it is a catalyst for creative events
to increase awareness, raise money and revi
talize the spirit of existing anti-violence or
ganizations.
I was shocked and disappointed with the
performance, which painted issues sur
rounding feminism and global women's
health and rights in a flippant tone. I guess I
should have known going into it.considering
the advertising campaign based off the "My
Dick" song, with lyrics such as "my clit...
Britney's comeback. Your clit... Britney

when she's fat" and "my clit... tastes like
Sprinkles. Your clit... gots shit-ton of wrin
kles." These portrayals of women's clitorises
as hierarchical, as in some are "fat" and oth
ers are smelly, hairy or wrinkly, fundamen
tally goes against "The Vagina Mono
logues'" celebration of till female sexuality
and beauty by reinforcing negative female
imagery.This may have been a very success
ful tactic to bring people to the performance
that might otherwise not have attended, but
I think that if that was the intent, once the
audience was present the message did not
get to the reality and depth of the issues.
At the end of the performance, the organ
izers left the audience with the cheeky note,
"I hope you guys out there learned some
thing. too." I'his production not only upheld
cssentialist attitudes about women and the
women's movement, but essentialized men
as ignorant and the cause of all problems. As
I left the performance. I was almost embar
rassed to be categorized as a feminist — I
am embarrassed that my fellow feminists
and I were portrayed as women who merely
want to shout about vaginas, female orgasms
and the chance to look at their genitals in the
mirror. To couch serious issues of women's
rights in this way demeans the goals of the
event and of women's rights worldwide.
Violence against women is a serious
issue. One-third to one-half of all women
worldwide will experience violence at the
hands of an intimate partner at least once in
their lifetimes, and women aged Hi-24 have
the highest rates of intimate partner vio
lence. Homicide is the second leading cause
of death for women who are pregnant in the

United States — 324,000 pregnant women
are battered by their intimate partner every
year in the United States. Rape occurs in the
U.S. every six minutes. Beyond violence,
women struggle worldwide for their lives
during pregnancy. Every day, 1,400 women
die from pregnancy-related issues, which is
more than half a million women each year,
globally. It is estimated that around 130 mil
lion women and girls have undergone fe
male genital mutilation in the last 50 to W)
years, a procedure in which the clitoris and
sometimes the labia or all external genitalia
are cut off using a variety of instruments, and
sometimes even a sharp stone. In some cases,
the skin is then sewn closed to assure chasti
ty, only to be cut open by force on the girl's
wedding night.
Since the events surrounding the tradi
tional V Week were not mentioned at "The
Vagina Monologues." I thought I would
spread the word about what remains. On
Tuesday, Feb. 24 at 7:30 p.m. in Cubberley
Auditorium. Men Against Abuse Now wiil
host Jackson Katz. who is internationally
recognized for his groundbreaking work in
gender violence prevention education with
men and boys, particularly in sports culture
and the military.
Though Stanford is often called "The
Happiest Place on Earth," it still suffers from
cases of relationship abuse and sexual as
sault I hope that these events will help to
move the dialogue and change the culture
around such issues on campus.
