# Crime and Punishment
## Emily Grubert Monster Jungle X-Ray the snake and other tales 
### 
I have this indescribably awesome 2(X)8
calendar from the California Department
of Oil. Gas and Geothermal Resources
(DOGGR),and I'm going to describe it any
way, just because I can't.
My DOGGR calendar features about one
part calendar, one million parts energy re
source-superhero cartoons. There's Magma,
the high-flying tiny red lava dude, a plug for
the giant network of geothermal power
plants up in wine country; there's Tank, who
is really huge, really scary and really noncom
mittal as to what s/he/it actually is — my best
guess is an evil grey Lego-constructed mani
ac with a sensitive side; and there's Petrolia,
who is blue, icily enticing and probably in
tended to look vaguely foreign. Drill Rig
Commander is there to keep all the other en
ergy superheroes under control.
I hear the James Bond establishment is
trying to buy the concept from DOGGR:
much like this calendar, the last Bond had no
plot and a lot of oil references. So it would be
a good transition. Plus, the last Bond movie
killed off a hot girl by dunking her in a vat of
oil. so using Petrolia as the new Bond girl
would actually make sense.
Energy has long been deeply intertwined
with mythologies, though the connection is
usually not as explicit as my DOGGR calen
dar makes it. Both Greek gods and Emperor
Palpatine formed and threw lightning bolts,
and almost every mythology has a sun figure.
People have historically been fascinated with
explaining where energy comes from. It is
kind of amazing, really — put seeds on
ground, sun shines, have food. Dig hole, get
black stuff out, light on fire, use laptop.
In these modern times, we've managed to
come up with a few energy myths of our own.
Some are harmless, some aren't — but cor
recting them can be perspective-altering.
First of all, you are almost certainly not re
ducing the need for foreign oil by turning off
the lights.
Oil accounts for a minuscule amount of
electricity production in the United States.
I lawai'i uses it because it's an island, and oil
is easier to ship than other things; Alaska and
refineries use it because, hey. it's there; some
parts of Florida use it for some reason I have
not yet divined.

The United States used to consume a lot
more oil for electricity generation. (If you're
wondering,oil emits more carbon than natu
ral gas and less than coal.) Then oil got too
precious for power plants, at least if you're
the United States and have 1) a lot of natural
gas of your own and 2) Canada nearby with a
lot of natural gas it can sell you. For now. gas
is a locally traded commodity because it's
hard to transport over water — Liquefied
Natural Gas (LNG) terminals are few and far
between, and those chilled tankers aren't
cheap, so it's usually safe to assume that nat
ural gas is only traded among countries that
are somehow land-connected.
In conclusion, in the continental United
States, oil is basically unrelated to electricity.
Keep turning off your lights, but you're not
sticking it to Middle Eastern oil tycoons
when you do.
Urn,secondly, the United States gets most
of its oil from North America.
Shocking. I know. We use around 20 mil
lion barrels of oil a day in the U.S.. and about
a third of that is produced domestically. We
get around another sixth from Canada and
Mexico. The top four oil suppliers to the
United States? ITie United States, Canada,
Saudi Arabia, Mexico. I"hen Venezuela and
Nigeria. It's a dependency, to be sure, hut the
geography of our oil dependency is some
times twisted a bit to take advantage of the
fact that the U.S. is not scared of Canada. 1

mean, we have a peace garden with it! In
North Dakota! I don't know about you. but I
love peace, gardens and North Dakota, so I
figure Canada must be alright. (That "Saudi
Arabia," though, man. I hear we have no such
thing as a peace garden with //.and it relies on
desalination for fresh water.)
And now, for 10 points, debunk one of the
following:
Myth 3, Candidate 1: Harry S. Truman
owned a snake named Monster Jungle X-
Ray.
Myth 3, Candidate 2: Porn is unrelated to
climate change.
There's an environment-shaped cake
waiting for anyone who can present to me a
reasonable estimate of how much electricity
use and/or carbon emission is globally attrib
utable to the Web-hosting and viewing of
porn. If the answer is something like "enough
to provide electricity to every rural villager in
India." you get two. Parameters: start once
it's uploaded, then tell me how much electric
ity it takes to run and cool data centers where
it's stored, then how much electricity people
use to view it. You have one week.

Emily is serious about that environment
shaped cake. Send your findings on the electric
ity footprint of adult entertainment to gru
herte@stanford.edu so she can spend her time
wondering what the palm trees will drink.
