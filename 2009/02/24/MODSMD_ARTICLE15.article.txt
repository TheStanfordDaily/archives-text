## Zack Warma What condition my condition was in 
### 
Upon official review, it appears that I
committed a flagrant act of negli
gence last week. I claimed that two of
the only real tangible connections between
Stanford students are our ability to lounge
about on this gorgeous campus and our
drinking habits. What I so foolishly forgot is
the campus-wide fixation on mental health.
Fifteen-yard penalty, replay first down!
In all sincerity, just as USC has its coke
binges. Berkeley its belligerent bums, and
Arizona its morons (both state and school),
we have our mental health concerns. As far
as resources go, we have the exceptional
Bridge Peer Counseling Center. CAPS,
Vaden, SHPRC, PHEs, RAs. the ASSU's
new anti-bystander campaign and the soon
to-be-unveiled (and in my estimation, rather
promising) Wellness Room, among others.
We have lectures up the wa/oo about
healthy sleep patterns, alleviating stress and
eating habits. We cannot forget those inane
"Sleep and Dreams" projects that everyone
does.The only thing the undergraduate body
seems to agree on, other than Hillary Rod
ham Clinton was intrinsically evil for run
ning against the Messiah Obama, is that we
have mental health issues!
What I at times have difficulty wrapping
my feeble mind around, is how 6.500 sue
cessful, intelligent and "well-rounded" stu
dents (because God knows we have ;ill seen
those brilliantly absurd glossy mailers that
our parents and the alums receive) can be
turned into Arkham Asylum (sans the
badass villains). Yet. the god-forsaken
"duck" mentality is held up to the world as
some absurd badge of pride, that we can be
both "laid-back" and motivated at the same
time.
Contrary to the bizarre little song and
dance we all compulsively engage in during
Admit Weekend, all is not well in paradise.
Unpleasantries stemming from stress over
academics and potential careers, feelings of
loneliness and isolation, frustration over the
lack of romantic interests, unhealthy eat
ing/drinking habits; it's all here in abun
dance, which to an extent is a good thing, be
cause it proves that we do not lack a basic
sense of humanity (cough. Arizona, cough).
But the question still remains: Why are such
negative emotions and feelings so abundant
here at the Stan?
A solid friend and former columnist him
self (and one of the few Zonies whom I hold
in extremely high regard). Paul Craft, once
made the spectacularly insightful comment
that we Stanford students are essentially
programmed to "do. not think "And while I
look forward to Craft's further exploration

of this notion, it bears mentioning to the
point at hand. Here at the Stan, our drug of
choice is hyperactivity, which manifests itself
into a myriad of student groups, academic
pursuits and a variety of other ventures.
We seem incapable of not joining six or
ganizations. playing a club sport and carry
ing 18 units. Be it out of external pressure, a
need to prove oneself or simply a byproduct
of our overwhelmingly tvpe-A personalities
that have propelled us since our first com
munity service event at the age of eight, we
have a tendency to reflexivelv engage our
selves in activities, regardless of our demon
strated interest or level of commitment.
Compounding the problem is this irra
tional need to exert a facade of normalcy,
that in fact, the ship isn't going down in
flames, that we are just as happy as those
smiling faces that glare back at us on the
"Stanford Challenge Newsletter" that we all
receive in our P.O. boxes. Last week. I
brought up the issue of drinking on campus,
but I made no mention of reasons behind
our levels of consumption. I am willing to
wager a portion of us booze for sheer bac
chanalian decadence and others because it's
merely something to do with friends. How
ever. I have no doubt in my mind there is a
good degree of students who throw a few too
many back over the weekend as a means of
relaxation, to de-stress and in a way to tem
porarily remove the specter of excessive
work and responsibilities.
We are ultimately left with a system that
leaves us both victims and ultimately perpe
trators of this ridiculously unhealthy culture.
Even so. we have the ability to fight back.
I lere's a crazav notion for us all: DO LESS!
Coming from someone who recently had a
come-to Jesus moment about his own un
healthy habits.it is shocking how fantastical
ly more fulfilling life feels when your day
isn't totally mapped out.
In addition, getting off campus is singu
larly one of the most refreshing experiences
to have. I recently escaped to Santa Cruz to
enjoy a beautiful day and get away from the
insanity of the Farm, and it was exactly what
I needed. So. friends and fellow high-achiev
ers, the time has come for us to get rid of that
horrific "duck" mentality, and to enjoy life a
little bit more. Just throwing it out there, but
a ( aucasian and " TTie Big Lebowski" is a
good wav to start ...
