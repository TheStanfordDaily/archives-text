# MEN'S SWIMMING
## THE 						LEGENDARY SKIP KENNEY 
### CHRISTIAN L. TOM SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
For a Marine Corps vet who
never swam in college and
doesn't believe in times, Skip
Kenney is a different kind of
swim coach. Yet he is one of the most
successful in collegiate sports histo
ry, having racked up seven NCAA ti
tles and 27 consecutive top-four fin
ishes since coming to Stanford 30
years ago.
In a candid interview with The
Daily, Kenney talks about recruiting
and admissions, this year's team and
his personal philosophy on coach
ing:
The Stanford Daily (SD): How
many straight Pac-1() Champi
onships has Stanford won?
Skip Kenney (SK): Twenty-seven.
. SD: Wow.
SK: When you get up to a number
like 27. it's just crazy.
SD: Has any other Stanford team
done so well?
SK: No. I don't think there's any in
the country.
SD: What factors do you think con
• tributed to this run?
SK: I would have to first say admis
sions. Without admissions, we just
don't get the student athletes here to
do that. And of course. Stanford is
pretty easy to sell. The second factor
is the athletes themselves. The way I
look at it, Stanford student athletes
don't get to this level by accident. As
they become better students, they
take their family philosophies and
bring them to Stanford.
SD: How does your squad help out
, with getting recruits to attend?
' SK: It is so much easier to get out of
bed in the morning for practice
when you love your teammates. My
guys sell themselves by being who
they are. It would be crazy for me to
hoard the recruits when they're the
Stanford guys: their personality,
their intelligence, family back
grounds, their kindness is what real
ly sells this place.
SD: What is your matriculation rate?
How many do you miss out on every
year?
SK: You always miss out on one or
two, maybe even three. We've had
Olympians not get in — and right
fully so; they didn't deserve to get in.
SD: What about walk-ons?
SK: We have to take a chance; we
want to. When you talk about the
team atmosphere, the people at the
bottom third of your team are the
ones who set the table for the cham

pions. They're the ones with the
great attitude. I've given scholar
ships to kids who will make the rest
of the team better by what they do or
what they say. not because of their
swimming.
SD: How can you pick those stu
dents out?
SK: On the recruiting trip to Stan
ford. I spend a couple of hours one
on-one with every recruit we bring
in. In fact, we go for a drive to Sky
line [Boulevard], look at the ocean
— the guys from the Midwest can't
believe it. You get a feel [ifj they
make the team better. Those Pac-10
Championships, those guys who
don't score, are as valuable and get
as much credit as guys who win indi
vidual events.
SD: How is your team composed?To
what extent do you see yourself as
more of a general manager, and
what is the role of the team cap
tains?
SK: The role of the team captain is
everything and anything. They help
make decisions such as who is on
travel team. If there is ever a team
problem. I bring the captains in.
They know these guys away from the
pool; I know them at the pool. I don't
think I've ever made an important
decision without the captains —
they play a huge role. Basically, this
is their team.
SI): What do you think about this
year's team?
SK: Well, there's two things: No. 1,
it's as good a team chemistry as any
team we've ever had. There is not
one bad egg on this team and it's our
largest team — it's 30 guys. I just
love this team. I love to go to prac
tice. This team has made me feel like
I'm 35 years old again ... They also
happen to be really talented, very
talented. This has been a fun year.
SD: So how did you get into swim
ming?
SK: Oh man. I really don't know
that. I'm not sure how to explain it.
I never swam. I taught Red Cross
lessons for a summer job. before I
even went to college. You don't have
to know how to swim to teach Red
Cross lessons. ITicn I went into the
service, and my last year in the serv
ice I taught combat swimming,
which has not one thing to do with
swimming; it is how to get across the
river with a helmet, flak jacket and
rifle with boots on. It's survival
swimming.
After that, I started [teaching)
again in the recreation department,
and one woman asked me about
coaching. I said."l don't know any
thing about that." She told me she
had other people who thought they
knew things, and "You say you don't
know anything, so what's the differ
ence?" They had a Christmastime
training trip. 1 had no idea what I
was doing, but I wanted to go to
Hawaii. So I signed up. One thing

led to another.
SI): What was the program like
when you first got here?
SK:They had won an NCAA title in
1967; this was now 1979. There was
room for improvement, let's say
that. My first recruiting class was 14
guys, 14 came in. It was the largest
class we've ever had, and it was our
first class. That's what really jump
started our team.
SI): Swimming is a such quantifiable
sport with race times and splits. How
does this numbers game affect your
strategy?

SK: I don't deal with numbers at all.
First of all. I don't know times. I can't
remember times. To me, they're not
important. What difference does it
make? Either you touch the wall
first or you don't. Because I was
never a swimmer, I had no reason to
learn times and it didn't make any
sense to me.
I don't ever want to look at
what other teams are doing. I don't
want to get that in my psyche. We
just try to make each one of our
guys better.

training trip. 1 had no idea what I
was doing, but I wanted to go to
Hawaii. So I signed up. One thing

led to another.
SI): What was the program like
when you first got here?
SK:They had won an NCAA title in
1967; this was now 1979. There was
room for improvement, let's say
that. My first recruiting class was 14
guys, 14 came in. It was the largest
class we've ever had, and it was our
first class. That's what really jump
started our team.
SI): Swimming is a such quantifiable
sport with race times and splits. How
does this numbers game affect your
strategy?

SK: I don't deal with numbers at all.
First of all. I don't know times. I can't
remember times. To me, they're not
important. What difference does it
make? Either you touch the wall
first or you don't. Because I was
never a swimmer, I had no reason to
learn times and it didn't make any
sense to me.
I don't ever want to look at
what other teams are doing. I don't
want to get that in my psyche. We
just try to make each one of our
guys better.

For a Marine Corps vet who
never swam in college and
doesn't believe in times, Skip
Kenney is a different kind of
swim coach. Yet he is one of the most
successful in collegiate sports histo
ry, having racked up seven NCAA ti
tles and 27 consecutive top-four fin
ishes since coming to Stanford 30
years ago.
In a candid interview with The
Daily, Kenney talks about recruiting
and admissions, this year's team and
his personal philosophy on coach
ing:
The Stanford Daily (SD): How
many straight Pac-1() Champi
onships has Stanford won?
Skip Kenney (SK): Twenty-seven.
. SD: Wow.
SK: When you get up to a number
like 27. it's just crazy.
SD: Has any other Stanford team
done so well?
SK: No. I don't think there's any in
the country.
SD: What factors do you think con
• tributed to this run?
SK: I would have to first say admis
sions. Without admissions, we just
don't get the student athletes here to
do that. And of course. Stanford is
pretty easy to sell. The second factor
is the athletes themselves. The way I
look at it, Stanford student athletes
don't get to this level by accident. As
they become better students, they
take their family philosophies and
bring them to Stanford.
SD: How does your squad help out
, with getting recruits to attend?
' SK: It is so much easier to get out of
bed in the morning for practice
when you love your teammates. My
guys sell themselves by being who
they are. It would be crazy for me to
hoard the recruits when they're the
Stanford guys: their personality,
their intelligence, family back
grounds, their kindness is what real
ly sells this place.
SD: What is your matriculation rate?
How many do you miss out on every
year?
SK: You always miss out on one or
two, maybe even three. We've had
Olympians not get in — and right
fully so; they didn't deserve to get in.
SD: What about walk-ons?
SK: We have to take a chance; we
want to. When you talk about the
team atmosphere, the people at the
bottom third of your team are the
ones who set the table for the cham

pions. They're the ones with the
great attitude. I've given scholar
ships to kids who will make the rest
of the team better by what they do or
what they say. not because of their
swimming.
SD: How can you pick those stu
dents out?
SK: On the recruiting trip to Stan
ford. I spend a couple of hours one
on-one with every recruit we bring
in. In fact, we go for a drive to Sky
line [Boulevard], look at the ocean
— the guys from the Midwest can't
believe it. You get a feel [ifj they
make the team better. Those Pac-10
Championships, those guys who
don't score, are as valuable and get
as much credit as guys who win indi
vidual events.
SD: How is your team composed?To
what extent do you see yourself as
more of a general manager, and
what is the role of the team cap
tains?
SK: The role of the team captain is
everything and anything. They help
make decisions such as who is on
travel team. If there is ever a team
problem. I bring the captains in.
They know these guys away from the
pool; I know them at the pool. I don't
think I've ever made an important
decision without the captains —
they play a huge role. Basically, this
is their team.
SI): What do you think about this
year's team?
SK: Well, there's two things: No. 1,
it's as good a team chemistry as any
team we've ever had. There is not
one bad egg on this team and it's our
largest team — it's 30 guys. I just
love this team. I love to go to prac
tice. This team has made me feel like
I'm 35 years old again ... They also
happen to be really talented, very
talented. This has been a fun year.
SD: So how did you get into swim
ming?
SK: Oh man. I really don't know
that. I'm not sure how to explain it.
I never swam. I taught Red Cross
lessons for a summer job. before I
even went to college. You don't have
to know how to swim to teach Red
Cross lessons. ITicn I went into the
service, and my last year in the serv
ice I taught combat swimming,
which has not one thing to do with
swimming; it is how to get across the
river with a helmet, flak jacket and
rifle with boots on. It's survival
swimming.
After that, I started [teaching)
again in the recreation department,
and one woman asked me about
coaching. I said."l don't know any
thing about that." She told me she
had other people who thought they
knew things, and "You say you don't
know anything, so what's the differ
ence?" They had a Christmastime
training trip. 1 had no idea what I
was doing, but I wanted to go to
Hawaii. So I signed up. One thing

led to another.
