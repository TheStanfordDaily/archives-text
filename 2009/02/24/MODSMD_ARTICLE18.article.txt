# Harbaugh works his magic
## 
### 
Memo to Stanford football
recruits: If you expect to
play only the position
you excelled at in high
school,you're sorely mistaken.
Jim Harbaugh. mad scientist ex
traordinaire. will take a tight end and
put him on the defensive line, or take
a running back and make him a line
backer. You play corner? That's nice;
try wide receiver.
Harbaugh's never-ending quest
for the optimized roster leads to posi
tion changes for many of his players,
even those that have become en
trenched in previous roles. The phi
losophy is simple: Try and field the
most effective team possible, and if a
safety is better suited for an offensive
position, then that's where he'll play.
Hut it's a constant process of trial and
error to find the right place for each
of his players.
