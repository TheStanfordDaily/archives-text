# Harbaugh works his magic
## 
### 
Memo to Stanford football
recruits: If you expect to
play only the position
you excelled at in high
school,you're sorely mistaken.
Jim Harbaugh. mad scientist ex
traordinaire. will take a tight end and
put him on the defensive line, or take
a running back and make him a line
backer. You play corner? That's nice;
try wide receiver.
Harbaugh's never-ending quest
for the optimized roster leads to posi
tion changes for many of his players,
even those that have become en
trenched in previous roles. The phi
losophy is simple: Try and field the
most effective team possible, and if a
safety is better suited for an offensive
position, then that's where he'll play.
Hut it's a constant process of trial and
error to find the right place for each
of his players.

Which is why spring practice,
which starts today (weather permit
ting), becomes all the more impor
tant, as Harbaugh tries to fit together
all the pieces of his elaborate puzzle.
But with seniors graduating and
prospective freshmen still wrapping
up high school, there's also a depth
issue. As a result, even players that
are penciled in as starters at one posi
tion could find themselves spending
time at another.
Take Tom Keiser, for instance. As
a redshirt freshman in 2(X)8, he led
the team with six sacks per game, and
was named to the freshman Ail-
American first team — even though
he only started two games. He's ex
pected to start at left defensive end,
but he'll be seeing time at tight end
during spring ball.
Same with Mike Thomas, pegged
to start at right cornerback, who will
work out at wide receiver. Chike
Amajoyi. the starting weak-side line

backer, will take reps at running
back, his high school position.
Are they likely to move to offense
full time, if at all? No, but for depth
purposes, they'll play two ways in
practice. And the possibility is still
there: If Keiser looks like Tony Gon
zalez, then the chances that he lines
up at tight end next fall are very real.
Once you get past the first level of
the depth chart, the potential for po
sition switches can increase. Mark
Mueller is but one example of a re
serve at one spot who will be spend
ing some time on both sides of the
ball. He was a backup cornerback in
2008, but will get time at wide receiv
er— his old position — during the
spring. Where is his value highest? At
cornerback, for instance, there are
seven players listed on the depth
chart. By contrast, there are only four
athletes listed at wide receiver — if
he impresses on offense, could
Mueller's contributions be maxi
mized there?
For some, the decision to switch
positions already appears final. De
lano Howell, who excited on offense
last season as a backup running back,
is currently slotted in as the starting

strong safety and doesn't appear to
be moving again. Previously, Har
baugh compared Howell to All-Pro
safety Troy Polamalu, and now he's
putting his claim to the test.
Some players have bought into
the position switching on their own.
Richard Sherman, who led the Cardi
nal in receiving yards in 2006 and
2007, requested a move to corner
back for 2009, and Harbaugh cur
rently has him penciled in as a re
serve on the right side.
These are all considerations for
Harbaugh as he builds his team for
2009. when expectations will be high
— at the least, a bowl game should be
attainable. As the program evolves,
so too does Harbaugh's philosophy.
These moves are not simply from one
place to another — he envisions that
some players will compete on both
offense and defense. His plans are
not simply a way to improve the Car
dinal: Harbaugh believes that two
way players are "the wave of the fu
ture," both in the collegiate and pro
fessional games.
If Stanford really is the testing
ground for this new style of roster
composition, then little is set in stone.
The players that fans saw tackling
ball carriers in 2008 might be the ones
carrying the pigskin in 2009, and vice
versa. Harbaugh's legacy early in his
Cardinal career is one of blue-collar
work ethic and experimentation ap
plied to football — the result is that
no one's job is safe, and that every
thing is open to reinterpretation.
Formal practices for the 2009
squad are finally here, and the mad
scientist is back to work.
