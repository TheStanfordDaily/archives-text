### NATE ADAMS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite its third and final day
being cancelled due to rain, the Stan
ford Nike Invitational Tournament
last weekend proved a more-than
ample opportunity for the Cardinal
Softball team to showcase its talent.
No. 8 Stanford (12-1) blew by its
opponents — Sacramento State and
Notre Dame on Friday, then Western
Kentucky and Notre Dame again on
Saturday — outscoring them by an
impressive total of 23-6 and passing
some historical milestones in the
process. The four victories extended
the Cardinal's current winning streak
to 11 games.
In Friday's second game, senior
pitcher Missy Penna held Notre
Dame (3-5) scoreless as she earned
her 36th career shutout — good
enough to break Stanford's all-time
record. The Miami-raised senior is
also on pace to break records in wins,
strikeouts and innings pitched this
season.
Saturday, more than anything
else, was the Missy Penna show. The
Cardinal ace pitched all seven in
nings of each game and allowed only
one earned run on seven hits en
route to picking up both wins. She
walked only one batter and struck
out 12. and gave up only one extra
base hit.
Hie Cardinal offense, meanwhile,
played a solid game against Sacra
mento State (2-4) on Friday. But
Stanford had trouble bringing run
ners home against Notre Dame that
afternoon. Juniors Alissa Haber and
Shannon Koplitz each went 1-2 with
a walk and two RBI as the Cardinal
out-hit the Hornets 6-4 in a 6-1 victo
ry. In the 2-0 win over the Fighting
Irish, however, runs were hard to

GAME NO FES: Stanford Softball got a big
boost over the weekend, winning all four of
its games in a rain-shortened tournament.
The hosts scored just under six runs per
game, while holding opponents to a total of
six runs. Senior Missy Penna won three of the
Card's contests, while juniors Allisa Haber
and Rosie Neill continued their hot hitting.
Stanford is now 12-1 on the season, and
looks to continue its winning ways tonight
against Saint Mary's. Gametime is set for 6
p.m. at Smith Family Stadium.
