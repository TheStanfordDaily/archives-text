# Softball cruises at Stanford Invite

### NATE ADAMS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite its third and final day
being cancelled due to rain, the Stan
ford Nike Invitational Tournament
last weekend proved a more-than
ample opportunity for the Cardinal
Softball team to showcase its talent.
No. 8 Stanford (12-1) blew by its
opponents — Sacramento State and
Notre Dame on Friday, then Western
Kentucky and Notre Dame again on
Saturday — outscoring them by an
impressive total of 23-6 and passing
some historical milestones in the
process. The four victories extended
the Cardinal's current winning streak
to 11 games.
In Friday's second game, senior
pitcher Missy Penna held Notre
Dame (3-5) scoreless as she earned
her 36th career shutout — good
enough to break Stanford's all-time
record. The Miami-raised senior is
also on pace to break records in wins,
strikeouts and innings pitched this
season.
Saturday, more than anything
else, was the Missy Penna show. The
Cardinal ace pitched all seven in
nings of each game and allowed only
one earned run on seven hits en
route to picking up both wins. She
walked only one batter and struck
out 12. and gave up only one extra
base hit.
Hie Cardinal offense, meanwhile,
played a solid game against Sacra
mento State (2-4) on Friday. But
Stanford had trouble bringing run
ners home against Notre Dame that
afternoon. Juniors Alissa Haber and
Shannon Koplitz each went 1-2 with
a walk and two RBI as the Cardinal
out-hit the Hornets 6-4 in a 6-1 victo
ry. In the 2-0 win over the Fighting
Irish, however, runs were hard to

GAME NO FES: Stanford Softball got a big
boost over the weekend, winning all four of
its games in a rain-shortened tournament.
The hosts scored just under six runs per
game, while holding opponents to a total of
six runs. Senior Missy Penna won three of the
Card's contests, while juniors Allisa Haber
and Rosie Neill continued their hot hitting.
Stanford is now 12-1 on the season, and
looks to continue its winning ways tonight
against Saint Mary's. Gametime is set for 6
p.m. at Smith Family Stadium.

a runner to the plate only after soph

Stanford's batters found a groove
by the following afternoon, however,
as they trounced Western Kentucky
(6-3) by a score of 10-3. On the Car

Maya Burns added three hits and
three RBI of her own. Overall. Stan
ford out-hit the Hilltoppers 11-5.
Cardinal sophomore hurler Ashley
Chinn remained undefeated on the
season — she pitched a full seven
innings for her third win of the sea
son.
Stanford's offensive momentum
carried over into its rematch with
Notre Dame Saturday afternoon,
which proved to be the premature
ending of the tournament. Haber
continued her one-day tear from the
batter's box, going 2-for-3 and hitting
her 13th career home run as the Car

dinal handed Notre Dame its second
loss at the hands of the tournament's
host in as many days. This time, Stan
ford didn't need unearned runs to
come out on top. Penna pitched an
other complete game and earned her
ninth win. giving up five hits to an
Irish team that was only just begin
ning to figure her out.
After her three-win weekend.
Penna was named the Pacific-10
Conference Pitcher of the Week and
is 9-1 on the season. Neill. who called
all four games lr§m behind the plate
and guided her pitching staff to a 1.25
ERA in four games, was selected as
the Pac-10 Player of the Week. Neill
had 23 put-outs and recorded her
31st career home run in the tourna
ment. She is now one of only five
Stanford players in history to have
more than 30 homers.
Stanford will continue its home

stand on Tuesday against Saint
Mary's — a team it has historically
dominated.The Cardinal boasts a 24-
6 all-time record against the Gaels,
with only one loss since 1997. Just
over a year ago, the Cardinal defeat
ed Saint Mary's via mercy rule in five
innings, by a score of 8-0. The Gaels
