## A 						LOOK AT THE GER APPROVAL PROCESS GER accreditation involves multiple levels of review 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
All Stanford undergraduates must ful
fill a number of General Education
Requirements (GERs) before gradua
tion, but the process by which these
courses gain accreditation has remained
largely ambiguous. Now. the recent con
troversy surrounding Professor William
Dements "Sleep and Dreams" course
has thrust this procedure into the spot
light.
"We have to take a broad range of
interdisciplinary classes so [that] we have
extensive knowledge in all fields of aca
demics." noted Dennis Chan "11. who is
contemplating a major in psychology. Hut
like many of his peers. Chan remains
uncertain as to why some classes qualify
for GERs while others do not.
"Basically, you do what you have to
do," Chan said,"but I'm worried because
I have to finish my pre-med require
ments — and requirements for my major
— in addition to the GERs."
The General I duration Requirement
In order for a class to attain GER cer
tification. it must meet a number of basic
requirements. Instructors must have
received their Ph.D., and the course must
be offered for a letter grade and a total of
at least three units. While graduate stu
dents are not allowed to teach GER
courses, lecturers and adjunct faculty are
entitled to have their courses accredited
as satisfying these University require
ments.
Integral to the certification system is
the Committee on Undergraduate
Standards and Policy (C-USP), which is
responsible for formulating and evaluat
ing the guidelines that govern undergrad
uate education. The committee handles
policies related to the structure and qual
ity of the curriculum, and oversees
I University requirements for earning a
baccalaureate degree.
"C-USP does much more than certify
GERs." emphasized Philippe Hue. the
committee's chair and a professor of his
tory. in an email to Hie Daily. "The stu
dent body can expect it to take on new
issues and bring recommendations to the
Faculty Senate for further discussion and
vote."
The committee is presently examining
grade inflation, as well as the advantages
and disadvantages of allowing the use of

electronic devices in the classroom.
Furthermore, it hopes to encourage
faculty members to release their syl
labi before the quarter opens so that
students may view the required read
ings and assignments in advance.
Within C-USP. the Senate
Subcommittee on General Education
Requirements plays a vital role in
determining which classes receive
GER certification. During the aca
demic school year, the subcommittee
meets at least once each quarter to
evaluate applications for GER
approval.
According to Academic
Committee Coordinator Lindi Press,
the entire GER system underwent
significant changes four years ago.
"[ln the past] a department would
list every single course that it wanted
for every single GER. submit it to its
chair, then to the school dean, and
then [to] the Registrar's Office," Press
said of the old certification system. "It
could only be done once a year in
time for the Bulletin — that was a
very cumbersome process."
The current GER system involves
three different processes for classes
that fulfill the Disciplinary Breadth.
Education for Citizenship and
Introduction to the Humanities
requirements.
Disciplinary Breadth
The Disciplinary Breadth course
offerings consist of classes that satisfy
the general education requirements
for Natural Sciences, Engineering and
Applied Sciences. Humanities, Social
Sciences and Mathematics.
In order to ensure that these
courses meet University standards in
rigor and content. Disciplinary
Breadth classes are chosen by the
departments themselves and by inter
disciplinary programs.
"There are sensible characteristics
in this [process]," Press said.
"Essentially, math does not designate
its courses for humanities and
Portuguese doesn't designate its
courses for Engineering and Applied
Sciences."
She added that the applications for
GER accreditation "are submitted by
departments and [that] the Registrar
does a quick final review to make sure
everything is fine."
Since the review process is
based solely on class descriptions
submitted by the instructors, the
process of approving classes for a
Disciplinary Breadth GER status

is swift. Press noted.
Education for Citizenship
The Education for Citizenship
requirement asks students to take two
classes among the Global Community,
American Cultures, Gender Studies
and Ethical Reasoning course offer
ings. Instructors must submit detailed
applications in order to obtain GER
approval within these areas of aca
demic concentration. These applica
tions include a full course description,
syllabus, reading list and the instruc
tor's explanation for why the course
should receive GER standing.
The Senate Subcommittee on
GERs is responsible for approving
courses pertaining to the Global
Community, American Cultures and
Gender Studies. The Ethical
Reasoning Advisory Board, on the
other hand, has the task of deciding
which courses gain Ethical Reasoning
GER status.
In her nine years of experience
with this certification process. Press
has worked with the subcommittee
on GERs and has served as a liaison
between the academic departments
and the two aforementioned govern
ing bodies.
Elaborating on this system. Press
said, "An instructor or department
will submit all the materials for a
course to the subcommittee on
GERs. which will meet at least quar
terly to review the courses."
if the subcommittee confers GER
status upon reviewing, as is generally
the case, "then the course will be
added to People Soft and Axess to
become effective at the beginning of
the next quarter, [or] occasionally at
the beginning of the current quarter,"
according to Press.
Introduction to the Humanities
Without question. Stanford under
graduates are well acquainted with
the Introduction to the Humanities
(IHUM) requirements, typically ful
filled during the three quarters of
freshman year.
IHUM courses are designed to
provide students with a solid founda
tion in the liberal arts. They aim to
emphasize the study of human
thought, values, beliefs, creativity and
culture.
Classes that fulfill IHUM require
ments go through an accreditation
procedure that is wholly distinct from
the approval processes for
Disciplinary Breadth and Education
for Citizenship GERs.
"Departments and faculties create
these courses and submit them to the
IHUM governance board, which does
a very thorough review" Press
explained.

In general, IHUM classes focus on
interdisciplinary methods in the fall
quarter and discipline-specific meth
ods in the winter and spring quarters.
Evaluating Class Quality
"We see all syllabi for new courses
that seek certification and discuss
whether they fit the exact description
of the various GERs," Buc said.
"While it is not our central responsi
bility, we also keep an eye on the seri
ousness of the course."
Once a course receives GER
approval, it usually retains its certifi
cation. According to Buc, "there is no
evaluation of GER courses after their
having been taught."
At the end of the day, accredita
tion is given solely on the basis of the
syllabus and statement provided by
the instructor. Buc noted.
When it comes to fulfilling
University requirements, the
Registrar recommends that students
consider the GERs early on in their
academic career.
"Freshman and sophomore advi
sors should encourage their students
to look at the GER requirements
early," Press said. "This is one of the
things that I always did when I was an
advisor — to make sure that my stu
dents are aware of the requirements.
Don't wait until senior year. Explore."
