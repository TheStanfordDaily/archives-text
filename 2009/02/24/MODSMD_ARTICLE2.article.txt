## A
						LOOK AT THE GER APPROVAL PROCESS GER accreditation involves multiple levels of review 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
All Stanford undergraduates must ful
fill a number of General Education
Requirements (GERs) before gradua
tion, but the process by which these
courses gain accreditation has remained
largely ambiguous. Now. the recent con
troversy surrounding Professor William
Dements "Sleep and Dreams" course
has thrust this procedure into the spot
light.
"We have to take a broad range of
interdisciplinary classes so [that] we have
extensive knowledge in all fields of aca
demics." noted Dennis Chan "11. who is
contemplating a major in psychology. Hut
like many of his peers. Chan remains
uncertain as to why some classes qualify
for GERs while others do not.
"Basically, you do what you have to
do," Chan said,"but I'm worried because
I have to finish my pre-med require
ments — and requirements for my major
— in addition to the GERs."
The General I duration Requirement
In order for a class to attain GER cer
tification. it must meet a number of basic
requirements. Instructors must have
received their Ph.D., and the course must
be offered for a letter grade and a total of
at least three units. While graduate stu
dents are not allowed to teach GER
courses, lecturers and adjunct faculty are
entitled to have their courses accredited
as satisfying these University require
ments.
Integral to the certification system is
the Committee on Undergraduate
Standards and Policy (C-USP), which is
responsible for formulating and evaluat
ing the guidelines that govern undergrad
uate education. The committee handles
policies related to the structure and qual
ity of the curriculum, and oversees
I University requirements for earning a
baccalaureate degree.
"C-USP does much more than certify
GERs." emphasized Philippe Hue. the
committee's chair and a professor of his
tory. in an email to Hie Daily. "The stu
dent body can expect it to take on new
issues and bring recommendations to the
Faculty Senate for further discussion and
vote."
The committee is presently examining
grade inflation, as well as the advantages
and disadvantages of allowing the use of

questioning of the class's ability to fulfill
the Natural Sciences GER requirement
has brought attention in general to the
process of GER certification.
