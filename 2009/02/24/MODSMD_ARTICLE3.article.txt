# GSB accepts GRE takers
## Business school opens up admission requirements to diversify student body, attract variety of applicants 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
Stanford's Graduate School of
Business (GSB) has decided to
accept the (iRE exam in place of
the more traditional GMAT in
applications to its MBA program.
Many other top-tier business
schools, including MIT, the
University of Chicago and Johns
Hopkins, have made a similar
policy change in recent years.
The GRE is a general stan
dardized test for graduate school,
whereas the GMAT is used
exclusively by business schools.
Hie move was motivated by a
desire to attract undergraduate
applicants from a broader range
of majors and interests to the
MBA program.
"We believe in the validity of
the GMAT. but we do not feel the
GMAT is the only way to meas
ure aptitude for graduate study in
management," said Derrick
Bolton, director of MBA admis
sion at the GSB. in an email to
The Daily. "We hope this decision
removes a barrier — mental,
financial or otherwise — and
gives us exposure to a talented
group of candidates we might not
otherwise see."
According to the Educational
Testing Service, the largest stan
dardized test organization, the
GRE is offered in 165 countries
while the GMAT is offered in
onlv 100. Therefore, schools that

accept the GRE may hope to
build a larger international stu
dent body.
But some are skeptical of the
impact the decision will have in
reality.
"In my opinion at least, the
verbal section of the GRE is way
tougher than that of the GMAT."
said Cristoph Dankert. a first
year MBA student. "Overall, I
don't think it will have a big
impact."
Further, lack of diversity in
the GSB's student body is not as
large a problem as some might
think. Bolton said it is a miscon
ception that only individuals with
undergraduate degrees in busi
ness or accounting should or do
apply to business school.
"We have always accepted
students from a wide variety of
undergraduate concentrations
and majors, and that continues,"
he said. "1 believe our 360 or so
first-year MBAs comprise well
over 120 majors."
Bolton added that the majori
ty of current MBA students at
Stanford received liberal arts
degrees as undergraduates, with
only about 15 percent of current
MBA students having majored in
business or accounting as under
graduates.
The Graduate School of
Business was unable to comment
on specific application data for
this year, as the application
process has not yet concluded.
