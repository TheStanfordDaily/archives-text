## Email system offers easy address finding "SEAmail" allows users to email by category rather than contact info By FATIMA WAGDY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
### 
University researchers plan to test a new email sys
tem that will allow users to send email simply by speci
fying the characteristics of their recipients — without
even knowing their names or email addresses.
SEAmail. the new program, will allow users to type
criteria like 'Stanford Professors who went to Harvard.'
and the database of the system will send the email to
those people who fit that criteria. The user does not
need to know the email address, create a list or even
know the recipients' names. It is a way of interacting

with software, without having to pay attention to all the
details.
"You want to send messages to people or roles, not
to strings of characters." said Associate Professor of
Computer Science Michael Genesereth.
In a prototype that was recently tested, users could
input "Michael Genesereth" and the email would he
sent to his most recent email address. In addition, the
system would not require users to keep track of an
address book.
SEAmail is short for Semantic Email Addressing, a
research project that first began three to four years ago
in the University's computer science department.
Michael Genesereth and Senior Research Associate
Charles Petrie were the main developers behind the sys-
tem. They worked on the project
with two graduate students —
Michael Kassoff.a Ph.D. student, and
Lee Ven, who now works for
Microsoft.
The email system has been in use
since 2005 within the Digital
Enterprise Research Institute, in col
laboration with their counterparts in
Ireland and Austria. It was used as
support for a larger institute to allow
people within the consortium to
communicate. This trial proved to be
particularly useful for communica
tion within the organization.
"Those who have had a chance to
use this email see it as a strong and
valuable idea," Genesereth said.
"However, the performance depends
critically on the availability of high
quality data. This is one of the rea
sons the project is first planned to be
used at Stanford."
The first big step will be to use the

system within the Stanford computer
science department, and later this
year, to begin expanding the system
across campus. Genesereth
explained that the system would
work well for groups with accurate
and detailed databases of all the peo
ple within that group.
The system will then be used
within large companies that also
have detailed and accurate databases
to make business communication
easier and more efficient. A number
of companies have already
approached Stanford about the use
of the SEAmail system and may
begin using the system soon.
The idea is that some day this new
technology will spread to the entire
Internet and be a very useful tool,
just like certain networking Web
sites today. This would require hav
ing access to multiple databases
without affecting the way each of
them function.
"There is no question in my mind
that there would be a great interest
in the technology," Genesereth said.
"If it succeeds, we will see it very
broadly adopted, and I'm very opti

mistic that this will succeed."
This spread is contingent on the
availability of a widespread and
accurate database of information
that is consistent and reliable, so the
technology cannot spread to the
entire Internet as of right now.
There are some security concerns
with the system, namely, making sure
that information cannot leak out of
the system. Genesereth said that
other issues, such as spam, would
probably not be any more problem
atic than they are now.
"[SEAmail] might work positive
ly to decrease the amount of spam
that is generated in the first place
because the same technology can be
used to filter email." he said.
Genesereth explained that spam
mers would like to get information to
people who want to see it.and often
these spammers don't know how. so
they just send emails to a random list
of people. This system would help
them reach their target audience
instead of simply emailing randomly.
