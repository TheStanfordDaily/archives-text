## Email system offers easy address finding "SEAmail" allows users to email by category rather than contact info By FATIMA WAGDY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
### 
University researchers plan to test a new email sys
tem that will allow users to send email simply by speci
fying the characteristics of their recipients â€” without
even knowing their names or email addresses.
SEAmail. the new program, will allow users to type
criteria like 'Stanford Professors who went to Harvard.'
and the database of the system will send the email to
those people who fit that criteria. The user does not
need to know the email address, create a list or even
know the recipients' names. It is a way of interacting

with software, without having to pay attention to all the
details.
"You want to send messages to people or roles, not
to strings of characters." said Associate Professor of
Computer Science Michael Genesereth.
In a prototype that was recently tested, users could
input "Michael Genesereth" and the email would he
sent to his most recent email address. In addition, the
system would not require users to keep track of an
address book.
SEAmail is short for Semantic Email Addressing, a
research project that first began three to four years ago
in the University's computer science department.
