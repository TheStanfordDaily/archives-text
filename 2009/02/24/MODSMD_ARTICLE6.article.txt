## Stanford splits pair in SoCal Card wins close contest on Saturday to snap skid 
### JEFF LU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A combination of overwhelming offen
sive play and steady serving carried the
Stanford men's volleyball team to their first
conference victory on the road last week
end, effectively ending a five-game losing
streak away from home. Despite an initial
loss to No. 4 Cal State-Northridge in a
slugfest, the Cardinal pulled through on
Saturday to defeat No. 13 UC-Santa
Barbara in a five-set nail-biter.
No. 7 Stanford (9-7,5-6 Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation) kicked off its baek-to
back road games with a visit to Cal State-
Northridge on Friday. Outsider hitters
sophomore Spencer McLaughlin and junior
Evan Romero had IK and 17 kills, respec
tively. and were boosted by 49 assists by
junior setter Kawika Shoji. But Stanford
was unable to convert strong individual
performances into a team victory as the
Cardinal crumbled in a 36-34, 27-30, 30-21,
35-33 loss to the Matadors.
From a statistical point of view, the
Stanford team had all the ingredients nec
essary to concoct a victory. The Cardinal
put up 12 team blocks to Northridge's four,
limited service errors to 12, managed an
overall .310 team hitting percent
age and hit an outstanding .500 in
the fourth set. In total, Stanford
had 155 attacks.
"You look at those numbers and
you wonder, 'How do you lose?'"
said Stanford coach John Kosty.
"We hit well enough to win. we
blocked well enough to win and we
passed well enough to win."
Unfortunately for the Cardinal,
the team was unable to offer an
adequate response to Northridge
setter Matt Stork's 81 assists and
the combined 50 kills put up by the
Matadors' opposite hitters Tanner
Nua and All-American Eric Vance.
Kosty thought that although the
Stanford team hit well on Friday
night, Northridge created greater
opportunities and had the higher
quality swings.
"It was a battle," Kosty said.
"I'm just disappointed we lost."
Saturday found the Stanford
men in Robertson Gym battling
UC-Santa Barbara to a hard
fought 30-26, 26-30, 24-30, 30-21,
15-13 victory. McLaughlin and
freshman outsider hitter Brad
Lawson led the Cardinal with 22
kills apiece to help gain the edge
over the Gauchos' hitters, of whom
four set or tied career-highs in kills.
Instrumental to Stanford's vic
tory, however, were the respective
contributions from Shoji and junior

GAME NOTES: The Stanford men's volleyball
team split a road set over the weekend,
falling to No. 4 Col State-Northridge but
beating No. 13 Santa Barbara. Despite
Friday's defeat at the hands of the
Matadors, Stanford played well on offense
and put up a great stat line. Saturday's
contest went the distance, and the Cardinal
orchestrated a comeback victory to snap its
road losing streak. Next weekend will be a
homecoming of sorts when Stanford heads
to Hawaii to take on the Warriors â€” six of
the Cardinal's players hail from the Aloha
State.

middle blocker Garrett Werner.
The latter single-handedly put up
six of the team's 12 blocks and also
chipped in 12 kills, good for an
errorless .571 hitting percentage.

Shoji managed 65 assists and
three service aces, one of which
came at a crucial moment for the
Cardinal. Trailing 12-9 in the final
set, Stanford was able to bounce
back due to Shoji's service ace and
four consecutive points off the sen
ior setter's serve. Santa Barbara
managed to stave off one match
point after Shoji's five-point run,
but eventually succumbed after a
combination play by McLaughlin
and Shoji ended the game.
With Stanford's nightmarish
road trip drought finally over,
Kosty is now turning his attention
to the upcoming Hawaii double
header and the remaining half of
the season. With the greater major
ity of its road games completed.
Stanford can look forward to play
ing II of its final 13 matches at
home.
"As much as I don't like our
record, we're in a really good spot."
Kosty said. "We're playing close to
.500 in league and we've only
played four home games."
"The early road games will ben
efit us down the road ... we hope
to see that benefit soon," he added.
Stanford heads to Honolulu.
