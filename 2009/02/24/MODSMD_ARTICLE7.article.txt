# NO PLACE LIKE HOME
## Women's tennis beats Gaels 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
There's no place like home —
especially for the Stanford
women's tennis team, which is
nearly invincible on the Farm.
The No. 11 Cardinal women
kicked off a six-match home stand
with a 5-2 win over Saint Mary's,
raising their dual-match record to
6-2 on the season.
The much-needed victory came
after a disappointing showing at
the National Indoor
Championships in Madison, Wise.,
where Stanford was eliminated in
the first round by No. 5 Notre
Dame. Adding to its road woes, the
Cardinal dropped its final consola
tion match to No. 10 Miami.
"They're a pretty good team,
and it's always tricky scheduling
after the Indoors — it's a big tour
nament." said Stanford head coach
Forood. "There are always a
lot of physical and emotional let
downs. It was a good match to get
us back on track."
l ike its performances prior to
the Indoors, Stanford took the
early lead with a sweep in doubles
action by scores of 8-3.8-1 and 8-5.
The top duo of sophomore Hilary
Barte and junior Lindsay Burdette
led the charge as Stanford's lone
ranked doubles team in the latest
collegiate rankings.

Carrying the intensity into sin
gles, the Cardinal quickly wrapped
up the match, winning on four of
the six courts.
At No. 1, Barte won a 6-0. 6-2
decision over Saint Mary's Alex -
Poorta. Barte has yet to lose in a
singles dual match this season.
Sophomore Carolyn McVeigh fol
lowed with a 6-1. 6-3 win over
Sabina Gunnarsson for the 3-1
edge.
Finally, Burdette clinched the
match with a 6-2,6-4 win at No. 2,
her first match at the second spot
this season.
Senior Jessica Nguyen added a
fifth point with a 6-2,4-6 (10-7) win
over Anna Chikhikvishvili, after
dropping down to No. 3 in the line
up.
"Jessica felt she had to work on
her game a little bit." Forood said
of the switch. "Playing at No. 2 is a
bit of a struggle if you're not com
pletely sharp. Lindsay's been play
ing well, so it was mutually decided
to be the best thing to do at the
moment."
"Jessica was great with the
plan." Forood added.
After an eye-opening Indoors,
the freshmen on the squad contin
ued to struggle on the court.
Freshman Veronica Li dropped a
