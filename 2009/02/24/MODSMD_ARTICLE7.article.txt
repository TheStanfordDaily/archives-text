# NO PLACE LIKE HOME
## Women's tennis beats Gaels 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
There's no place like home —
especially for the Stanford
women's tennis team, which is
nearly invincible on the Farm.
The No. 11 Cardinal women
kicked off a six-match home stand
with a 5-2 win over Saint Mary's,
raising their dual-match record to
6-2 on the season.
The much-needed victory came
after a disappointing showing at
the National Indoor
Championships in Madison, Wise.,
where Stanford was eliminated in
the first round by No. 5 Notre
Dame. Adding to its road woes, the
Cardinal dropped its final consola
tion match to No. 10 Miami.
"They're a pretty good team,
and it's always tricky scheduling
after the Indoors — it's a big tour
nament." said Stanford head coach
Forood. "There are always a
lot of physical and emotional let
downs. It was a good match to get
us back on track."
l ike its performances prior to
the Indoors, Stanford took the
early lead with a sweep in doubles
action by scores of 8-3.8-1 and 8-5.
The top duo of sophomore Hilary
Barte and junior Lindsay Burdette
led the charge as Stanford's lone
ranked doubles team in the latest
collegiate rankings.

Carrying the intensity into sin
gles, the Cardinal quickly wrapped
up the match, winning on four of
the six courts.
At No. 1, Barte won a 6-0. 6-2
decision over Saint Mary's Alex -
Poorta. Barte has yet to lose in a
singles dual match this season.
Sophomore Carolyn McVeigh fol
lowed with a 6-1. 6-3 win over
Sabina Gunnarsson for the 3-1
edge.
Finally, Burdette clinched the
match with a 6-2,6-4 win at No. 2,
her first match at the second spot
this season.
Senior Jessica Nguyen added a
fifth point with a 6-2,4-6 (10-7) win
over Anna Chikhikvishvili, after
dropping down to No. 3 in the line
up.
"Jessica felt she had to work on
her game a little bit." Forood said
of the switch. "Playing at No. 2 is a
bit of a struggle if you're not com
pletely sharp. Lindsay's been play
ing well, so it was mutually decided
to be the best thing to do at the
moment."
"Jessica was great with the
plan." Forood added.
After an eye-opening Indoors,
the freshmen on the squad contin
ued to struggle on the court.

an early exit from the Indoor Championships last weekend.
at No. 5. Similarly, freshman Court
ney Clayton was on the wrong end of
a 2-6,6-3 (10-7) loss.
Forood attributed their dips, how
ever, to the normal ups and downs of
any freshmen on campus.
"I would have to say it's not so
much a wall as they're kind of learn
ing what it takes to be successful,"
Forood said. "There are a lot of tran
sitions in the freshmen year, especial
ly with time management and course
work and getting enough rest. 1 think
they're still learning how to do it here,
so that's shown up in our results a lit
tle bit.
"But I know that they're going to
get better as we go forward through
the spring quarter, since they'll get
that much better at getting things
done," Forood added.
On a bright note, the victory ex
tended Stanford's home win streak to

"It's another
match we
have to win."

139 dual matches.including 111 in the
regular season.
This Friday, Stanford will host fel
low Pacific-10 Conference opponent
Washington State. Last year, the Car
dinal upended the Cougars in a 5-1
victory in Pullman, Wash.
"I'm not totally familiar with their

team," Forood said. "But the impor
tant thing is that it's opening Pac-10
play for us for the year,so we're going
to be very ready next Friday. It's going
to be a good match,and we're looking
forward to starting conference play."
As an added incentive to the
match, Friday marks the 10-year an
niversary of Stanford's last loss on the
Farm. That came in a 5-4 decision to
California back on Feb. 27,1999.
Nonetheless, the streak seems to
be an afterthought for a focused Car
dinal squad.
"There's been no conversation,"
Forood said of the winning streak. "I
don't think anyone's aware of it —
things like that we don't care about at
all. It's another match we have to
win."
After Friday's match, the Cardinal
women will not leave home for a
month until their Southern California
road trip, when they will face No. 8
UCLA and No. 9 Southern Califor
nia.

Washington State. Last year, the Car
dinal upended the Cougars in a 5-1
victory in Pullman, Wash.
"I'm not totally familiar with their

team," Forood said. "But the impor
tant thing is that it's opening Pac-10
play for us for the year,so we're going
to be very ready next Friday. It's going
to be a good match,and we're looking
forward to starting conference play."
As an added incentive to the
match, Friday marks the 10-year an
niversary of Stanford's last loss on the
Farm. That came in a 5-4 decision to
California back on Feb. 27,1999.
Nonetheless, the streak seems to
be an afterthought for a focused Car
dinal squad.
"There's been no conversation,"
Forood said of the winning streak. "I
don't think anyone's aware of it —
things like that we don't care about at
all. It's another match we have to
win."
After Friday's match, the Cardinal
women will not leave home for a
month until their Southern California
road trip, when they will face No. 8
UCLA and No. 9 Southern Califor
nia.
