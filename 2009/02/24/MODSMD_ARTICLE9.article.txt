## Sparking intellect... and conversation Students cite intimidation as a barrier to attending professor office hours 
### JOCELYN SEARS 
Approaching a Nobel laureate is
no casual undertaking.
Professors at Stanford are
one of the most touted resources
available to students, yet many
find it difficult to talk to professors face to
face. Others simply don't make use of office
hours.
And while some students certainly utilize
office hours to ask questions or get to know
faculty members, the extent to which under
graduates visit professors varies drastically
from person to person.
"Some students, including first-quarter
freshmen, will visit my office hours for dis
cussion many times in a quarter," said
Associate Professor of Psychology James
Gross. "Other students, including advanced
students, never visit."
Talking with and getting to know profes
sors produce many tangible benefits for stu
dents. It may signal interest in a class, get
questions answered, make connections for
future research opportunities or determine
whom to choose as a faculty advisor.
"It's a really valuable resource," said
Anton Strenger '10. "Almost more than the
classes you take because it's a one-on-one
setting."
Still. Strenger admits that even he doesn't
utilize this resource frequently.
So why does this discrepancy exist?
There's a myriad of reasons — one is the
fear factor.
Many students simply find the intelligent,
knowledgeable and often famous Stanford
faculty intimidating. Having a professor who
is a successful writer, a prize-winning
researcher or a premier thinker in his or her
field is enough to strike fear even in the

hearts of talented and accomplished
Stanford undergraduates.
"I had Tobias Wolff for Journeys [IHUM]
last year," said a sophomore who chose to
remain anonymous for privacy reasons. "He
was pretty intimidating because he's so suc
cessful."
Finding something to say to impress such
remarkable faculty can be such an obstacle
that some students would rather not bother.
Others are simply shy, and getting over the
initial hump of nervousness may be the
hardest part.
"I was intimidated the first time [I met
with a professor]." said Katie McCaffree '12.
She noted, however, that having that first
successful experience lessened her anxiety.
Yet not all experiences are successful,
and one indifferent or rude professor can
leave students a bit slighted such that anoth
er meeting seems bound to be unpleasant.
For while some professors' achievements
cause intimidation, others may just seem
standoffish or unwelcoming.
"Some professors are simply unap
proachable," noted Cameron Mullen '11.
Certain undergraduates also shrink from
infringing on professors' busy schedules.
Olivia Haas '11, a student in Gross's popular
Psychology 1 course last fall, said that while
she enjoys meeting one-on-one with profes
sors often, she is cautious about requesting a
slot in their schedules.
"I am very, very aware of how busy they
are, and that can be intimidating," Haas said.
"I would have loved to go to Prof. Gross's
office hours; it's just that he appeared so
busy. Even if he said/email me a time,' I just
couldn't do it because I knew how busy he
was."
The faculty's hectic schedules lead some
students to defer attending office hours

until they have a very clear question or goal
in mind. This often causes pressure to come
up with earth-shattering insight or a partic
ularly thorny question that they feel will
justify their taking up a professor's time.
But coming up with such an impressive
question or point can create stress, such
that students may put off making appoint
ments with faculty to the point that they
never attend one.
Additionally, Stanford students them
selves lead exceptionally busy lives. So busy,
in fact, that they may struggle to find a free
block of time, or think that doing so will add
more stress to an already packed schedule.
"(Finding time] is a big part of it. for me,
being excessively busy myself," Haas noted.
In the midst of such busyness, the small
est misgiving could be enough to stop an
already timid student from making the extra
effort to meet with a professor outside of
class.
Yet the relatively small size of Stanford
means that professors are more available for
one-on-one consultations than they might
be at larger universities. Professors may hold
significant knowledge on life or careers in
fields students can tap into, and give their
expertise in a particular discipline. What,
then, can be done to encourage hesitant stu
dents to knock on that door?
Funnily enough, professors can appeal to
students' stomachs and intense love of free
food.
"My Math 51 professor had cupcakes,"
said Mullen, who often attended her office
hours, along with the biology department
socials that offer free pizza.
But really, nothing is more encouraging
than the professor's desire to spend time
with students. Mullen commented that he
enjoyed his Math 51 professor's office hours

because she made a point to he approach
able and open to students' questions and
concerns. ITie cupcakes simply served as
physical evidence of this welcoming atmos
phere.
The best thing professors can do, then, is
to express their desire to meet with students
and emphasize that office hours are a low
pressure time — a simple opportunity for
students to discuss their problems or ideas,
whether they are based on class or life con
tent.
One short comment can go a long way.
Associate Professor of English Nicholas
Jenkins asked members of his Poetry and
Poetics class to come meet with him. joking
that he is lonely when no students come to
office hours.
"Faculty are sometimes puzzled by an
apparent disconnect," Jenkins said.

"Students consistently tell us that they
would like more direct, intellectual contact
with professors. And yet in office hours
many professors stare at an empty chair
opposite them where a student who wanted
direct, intellectual contact would come in
and sit."
Students can relax, because the bottom
line is that most faculty members sincerely
want to talk with students, despite their busy
schedules.
"If there were one message I could give
to students, it's that the faculty are happy to
talk with students." Gross said. "Indeed, one
of the greatest pleasures as a faculty mem
ber at Stanford is talking with the amazing,
talented and diverse students who make up
the undergraduate student body."

face. Others simply don't make use of office
hours.
And while some students certainly utilize
office hours to ask questions or get to know
faculty members, the extent to which under
graduates visit professors varies drastically
from person to person.
"Some students, including first-quarter
freshmen, will visit my office hours for dis
cussion many times in a quarter," said
Associate Professor of Psychology James
Gross. "Other students, including advanced
students, never visit."
Talking with and getting to know profes
sors produce many tangible benefits for stu
dents. It may signal interest in a class, get
questions answered, make connections for
future research opportunities or determine
whom to choose as a faculty advisor.
"It's a really valuable resource," said
Anton Strenger '10. "Almost more than the
classes you take because it's a one-on-one
setting."
Still. Strenger admits that even he doesn't
utilize this resource frequently.
So why does this discrepancy exist?
There's a myriad of reasons — one is the
fear factor.
Many students simply find the intelligent,
knowledgeable and often famous Stanford
faculty intimidating. Having a professor who
is a successful writer, a prize-winning
researcher or a premier thinker in his or her
field is enough to strike fear even in the

hearts of talented and accomplished
Stanford undergraduates.
"I had Tobias Wolff for Journeys [IHUM]
last year," said a sophomore who chose to
remain anonymous for privacy reasons. "He
was pretty intimidating because he's so suc
cessful."
Finding something to say to impress such
remarkable faculty can be such an obstacle
that some students would rather not bother.
Others are simply shy, and getting over the
initial hump of nervousness may be the
hardest part.
"I was intimidated the first time [I met
with a professor]." said Katie McCaffree '12.
She noted, however, that having that first
successful experience lessened her anxiety.
Yet not all experiences are successful,
and one indifferent or rude professor can
leave students a bit slighted such that anoth
er meeting seems bound to be unpleasant.
For while some professors' achievements
cause intimidation, others may just seem
standoffish or unwelcoming.
"Some professors are simply unap
proachable," noted Cameron Mullen '11.
Certain undergraduates also shrink from
infringing on professors' busy schedules.
Olivia Haas '11, a student in Gross's popular
Psychology 1 course last fall, said that while
she enjoys meeting one-on-one with profes
sors often, she is cautious about requesting a
slot in their schedules.
"I am very, very aware of how busy they
are, and that can be intimidating," Haas said.
"I would have loved to go to Prof. Gross's
office hours; it's just that he appeared so
busy. Even if he said/email me a time,' I just
couldn't do it because I knew how busy he
was."
The faculty's hectic schedules lead some
students to defer attending office hours

until they have a very clear question or goal
in mind. This often causes pressure to come
up with earth-shattering insight or a partic
ularly thorny question that they feel will
justify their taking up a professor's time.
But coming up with such an impressive
question or point can create stress, such
that students may put off making appoint
ments with faculty to the point that they
never attend one.
Additionally, Stanford students them
selves lead exceptionally busy lives. So busy,
in fact, that they may struggle to find a free
block of time, or think that doing so will add
more stress to an already packed schedule.
"(Finding time] is a big part of it. for me,
being excessively busy myself," Haas noted.
In the midst of such busyness, the small
est misgiving could be enough to stop an
already timid student from making the extra
effort to meet with a professor outside of
class.
Yet the relatively small size of Stanford
means that professors are more available for
one-on-one consultations than they might
be at larger universities. Professors may hold
significant knowledge on life or careers in
fields students can tap into, and give their
expertise in a particular discipline. What,
then, can be done to encourage hesitant stu
dents to knock on that door?
Funnily enough, professors can appeal to
students' stomachs and intense love of free
food.
"My Math 51 professor had cupcakes,"
said Mullen, who often attended her office
hours, along with the biology department
socials that offer free pizza.
But really, nothing is more encouraging
than the professor's desire to spend time
with students. Mullen commented that he
enjoyed his Math 51 professor's office hours

because she made a point to he approach
able and open to students' questions and
concerns. ITie cupcakes simply served as
physical evidence of this welcoming atmos
phere.
The best thing professors can do, then, is
to express their desire to meet with students
and emphasize that office hours are a low
pressure time — a simple opportunity for
students to discuss their problems or ideas,
whether they are based on class or life con
tent.
One short comment can go a long way.
Associate Professor of English Nicholas
Jenkins asked members of his Poetry and
Poetics class to come meet with him. joking
that he is lonely when no students come to
office hours.
"Faculty are sometimes puzzled by an
apparent disconnect," Jenkins said.

"Students consistently tell us that they
would like more direct, intellectual contact
with professors. And yet in office hours
many professors stare at an empty chair
opposite them where a student who wanted
direct, intellectual contact would come in
and sit."
Students can relax, because the bottom
line is that most faculty members sincerely
want to talk with students, despite their busy
schedules.
"If there were one message I could give
to students, it's that the faculty are happy to
talk with students." Gross said. "Indeed, one
of the greatest pleasures as a faculty mem
ber at Stanford is talking with the amazing,
talented and diverse students who make up
the undergraduate student body."
