## Editorial Sweat-Free Week should not be debate-free 
### 
The Sweat-Free Stanford Coalition has
mobilized to declare this week
"Sweat-Free Week" on campus — a
reference to its anti-sweatshop labor cam
paign. not a plug to skip the gym this week.
The student group hosts a number of events
throughout the week to raise awareness for
the appalling working conditions that seam
stresses who produce Stanford University
apparel work in.
The editorial board is in full support of
the mission that the Sweat-Free Coalition
fights for. hut hopes a more comprehensive
academic debate about the issue of interna
tional laborer rights can occur in order to
bring further awareness to the student body.
While it may seem like a no-brainer to
conclude that sweatshops are harmful to the
economy and human rights, the results are
not yet final. National experts are still debat
ing the merits of sweatshops as we speak,
and the conclusions are a bit counterintu
itive. Sweatshop labor may actually be the
first step out of poverty for citizens of the
world's poorest countries, and global cam
paigns against sweatshop labor may be un
dermining this development.
The debate was further brought into
question by a recent flurry of policy actions
from Washington and the media attention
surrounding it. This month, in response to
President Obama's announced support for
fair labor standards in free-trade agree
ments. New York l imes columnist Nicholas
I), Kristof fed readers a harsh dose of reality.
"In the hierarchy of jobs in poor coun
tries, sweltering at a sewing machine isn't the
bottom." Kristof said, lie elaborated."Talk
to those families in the dump, and a job in a

sweatshop is a cherished dream, an escalator
out of poverty, the kind of ambition parents
everywhere often have for their children."
Kristof has firsthand experience with the
destitution that spurs competition for sweat
shop jobs from the years he spent living in
Fast Asia, lie depicts families in Cambodia
who subsist scavenging through toxic waste
dumps and even living in them, dreaming of
the scarce manufacturing jobs that Ameri
cans boycott in disgust. He notes that while
imposing labor standards on countries har
boring sweatshops may seem to benefit
workers, enforcing standards comes with
costs.
Sometimes these costs are so prohibitive
in the current financial crisis that entire fac
tories are forced to close — leaving thou
sands of workers without jobs, and forcing
them back to starvation and the slums. The
best way to combat extreme poverty in de
veloping countries, some economists sug
gest. lies in encouraging manufacturing,
which runs counter to most efforts of the
anti-sweatshop movement.These arguments
should be debated and examined during
Stanford's "Sweat-Free Week."
This editorial is not meant to question the
laudable motives of the Sweat-Free Stan
ford Coalition, but to encourage an open de
bate where people of all opinions can ad
dress every surrounding issue. We are hope
ful that a week dedicated to addressing this
issue will evoke a response about the use of
sweatshops that produce Stanford gear, as
well as help the University move forward in
addressing as a whole this longstanding issue
between certain students and the adminis
tration.
