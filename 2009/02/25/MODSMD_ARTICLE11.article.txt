## Is voicemail really dead? 
### 
Last summer, in a post callcd "Think
Before You Voicemail" on Ins popular
blog.TechCrunch. writer Michael Ar
lington argued that the method is obsolete.
"Voicemail is dead." he wrote. "Please tell
everyone so they'll stop using it."
Arlington alleged that voicemail is slow
and inconvenient when compared to text
messages or email, and that in any case, most
messages just say."l ley.call me back."
I'm all for efficiency, both in personal life
and work settings, but the seeming decline in
voicemail somehow troubles me. And it's
particularly acute among the generation
now in college. Most of my friends regularly
just call back without listening to messages I
leave.and many others keep their mailboxes
permanently full.
l or complete disclosure. I am a very thor
ough voicemailer. ITie sheer peer pressure of
living as an outlier at Stanford has made me
tone it down, but I still leave messages most
ol the time. Some of them are of the "llev.
call me back" variety, but many have much
more detail. Besides.once I've already start
ed to call you, hanging up and typing. "I ley.
call me back.' is just as time-consuming. And
if you listen to my message. I won't have to
re-explain myself when you do call.
But I'm way out of the mainstream. To
confirm just how out of touch I am. I decid
ed to ask several ol my residents in Burbank
all of whom are much cooler than I
about their voicemail habits.
"I probably check it once a week." said
Christina Tliirv'l2."lt's just such a process.
You have to call in. listen to the greeting,
and then half the time (the message| is
pointless."
"When you can text. I can't understand
why you'd use voice messages," she added.
According to Harrison Kay '12, "voice
mail's like a last ditch thing" after leaving a
missed call or sending a text. "The only rea
son I listen to it is to get rid of the little sym
bol on the screen," he confessed.
I hcre is lots of new technology allowing
people to ignore voicemail more efficiently,
iPhones have visual voicemail, allowing
users to listen to or delete any voicemail in
any order. A number of companies offer
voicemail transcription services using voice
recognition software toemail you the result.
Maybe that saves time, but it seems like
the decline ol voicemail is also a sign of our
increasingly impersonal society. II we don't
have to interact directly with others, we
often choose not to. Icxting requires no need
to prepare for a coherent conversation in
which answers must be given with carefully
calculated deliberation. Luring someone to
call back with a missed call keeps you from
appearing too over-eager and puts the bur
den on the other person.

Rationales like these reminded me of
Stanford's semi-mythical anti-dating cul
ture. Lots of people are so used to success,
the common wisdom goes, that putting
themselves on the line — risking rejection
— is simply too scary. Explicitly asking
someone is abnormal, to the extent that
some students even consider such boldness
off-putting. It's easier to move in tiny steps
like I acebook messages and texts with giant,
"just friendly" escape hatches. Or to finally
gel drunk at the same party.
Maybe voicemail also has too high a risk
for rejection, even in non-romantic scenar
ios. What i! you leave a really long, rambling
message -which I do all the time — and
someone doesn't like your voice? What if
you say something strange and sound like a
moron? II someone listens to your detailed
message and chooses not to call back, the re
jection is explicit. It can't be explained away
like a missed call that didn't show up.
Despite efficiency or social anxiety, the
truth is that voicemail can't die.
"I guess it is good for. like.appointments."
conceded Brandon I'aing '12. who said he
hasn't set up his voicemail.
Along with helping if I cdbx or the doc
tor calls, voicemail is also necessary in most
business environments. Even for current stu
dents, what if a potential employer calls? Or
your boss? Are they really going to hang up
and text like all your friends?
lb get a professional perspective, I asked
one of my resident fellows (KI s). Stephanie
Eberle. who works at the School of Medicine
Career Center. Eberle, too. has noticed that
students have migrated away Irom voice
mail. and cautioned that while other meth
ods might work socially.it is bad practice for
the future.
"Some of the stuff you're supposed to he
doing on campus is learning how to be social
and how to interact with people — future
teammates and bosses," she noted. "It wor
ries me that we're getting away from the per
sonal."
So I guess in the long run. all the voice
mail practice I have will be useful. Someday,
il I ever get a job.someone will have to listen.
I or now. my friends are welcome to keep ig
noring the messages. I'm already used to it.

Want to have Michael a long, rambling voice
mail? I mail him at \vilker\on( n Stanford.cdu
to vet his number.
