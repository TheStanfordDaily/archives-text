# The
						Voice of Experience

The idea that America's educational sys
tem is failing — and has been failing
for decades — is not news to anyone.
In fact, it's as ingrained into our conscious
ness as the fact that American cars are lousy
compared to foreign ones. And yet. just as
our car companies stubbornly refused to
change, we have stubbornly refused to tackle
our educational woes with anything resem
bling sufficient passion or intensity.
The problem is incredibly complex and I
don't pretend to know the whole answer. But
my own experience teaching high school for
four years has left me with a strong convic
tion that a big part of the answer, perhaps
even the biggest part, is improving teacher
pay.
I he logic is as follows. Hrst. the single
most important determinant of student suc
cess — beyond facilities, supplies and cur
riculum— is teacher quality. Second, the
qualifications and talent required to allow an
individual to teach effectively in our coun
try's most struggling schools are significant
and broad. Third, to get individuals with
these kinds of skills into the worst kind of ed
ucational environments, we need to pay them
like the professionals they are. Let's look at
each of these points.
In the last 10 years, the research has be
come increasingly clear that students learn
best from highly qualified teachers. In an in
terview with Edutopia magazine, Stanford
Education Professor Linda Darling-Ham
mond stated. "Teacher qualifications,
teacher's knowledge and skills, make more
difference for student learning than any
other single factor."
Moreover, such teachers can actually
close achievement gaps. According to I .earn
ing Point, a non-partisan educational consul
tancy, "As a number of studies have demon
strated. disadvantaged students who have
highly effective teachers for several consecu
tive years are able to catch up to their more
advantaged peers."
So what exactlv does a highlv effective

teacher in a disadvantaged school look like?
My own experience taught me this the hard
way when, in 2003. I signed on to work as a
math teacher in a public charter high school
in San Francisco. Ihe teaching staff was
young,smart and dedicated, but it was a diffi
cult school to teach in. Within a single class
room. we would often face an impossibly
wide range of skill levels, behavior patterns
and motivation levels.
To succeed, teachers in my school had to
work to become not only experts in subject
matter and pedagogy, but 111 a myriad of sup
plementary skills. We had to be social work
ers. therapists, cheerleaders and disciplinari
ans. We had to develop the spontaneous cre
ativity needed to deliver the same curriculum
in multiple ways to kills with vastly different
learning styles and disabilities.
So the question becomes: I low do we get
individuals with these skills or the talent to
teach them into the right classrooms — and
keep them there? To answer this question,
let's start by looking at the elephant in the
room: the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001
(NCLB).
The most significant educational reform
of the past decade. N( 1 B is a mixture of ini
tiatives designed to focus schools on improv
ing test scores in core areas like reading and
math. Ambitious hut controversial. NCI B
has yielded mixed results and is hardly a
Manhattan Project for education.
112 lawed to begin with, it was also under
funded by the Bush administration, which
consistently provided less mone\ each year
than called for in the original legislation. Ac
cording the American Federation ol leach
ers. that under-funding amounted to at least
$71 billion since the bill's inception, a signifi
cant figure for a program that has received an
average of about $20 billion a year since
2(H)2.
One of the provisions of NCI B that suf
fered both from inherent flaws and from
under-funding was the Highly Qualified
Teachers provision, which was designed to

put the kind of effective teacher I have de
scribed into all of our public school class
rooms. Most states interpreted this law as re
quiring that teachers have a credential (usu
ally a one-year program equivalent to a Mas
ter's) and demonstrate subject matter com
petence. usually by passing a test.
Hut the problem is that having a creden
tial does not necessarily make a teacher ef
fective. In fact, there is a myriad of evidence
that there is little or no correlation between
the two. For example, a Harvard study on the
New York City school system concluded that
"on average, the certification status of a
teacher has at most small impacts on student
test performance ... among those with the
same certification status, there are large and
persistent differences in teacher effective
ness."
Clearly, the NCLB's method for getting
truly qualified teachers into the classroom is
flawed. So how can we legislate that great
teachers are at our neediest schools?
The answer is we can't. You cannot legis
late good teachers into public school class
rooms.
You need to pay them to be there. It's a
simple fact of the market that every school
child knows: you need to pay for talent. My
own story illustrates this point After two
long, painful years at the public charter. I had
begun to achieve real success in the class
room and wason my way to becoming (I be
lieve) the kind of teacher that could make a
difference for underserved kids.
But 1 was also making $41,3(X) a year while
living in San Francisco. I simply couldn't af
ford to keep working for that salary and
under those conditions, which often required
exhausting. N)-hour weeks. So I left lor a
higher-paying job at a private school.
But the sad story of our schools might still
have a happy ending. Next week, we'll look at
some possible solutions to the problem.
