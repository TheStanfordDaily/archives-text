son and 8-1 in dual matches. Klahn.
Thacher, Bruch and Wire all swept
through their singles matches at
Nos. 2-5. respectively. Wire was par
ticularly impressive and is now 6-0 in
the year in the No. 5 singles spot, and
15-5 overall.

lineup. Stanford won the doubles

I and 2 doubles.The Cardinal domi
nated singles yet again, winning all
six matches — five in straight sets.
Only Clayton at No. 1 singles split
the first two sets, but rallied for the
10-point tiebreak victory to capture
the match

highly ranked singles players and
doubles teams. The Bruins are the
defending Pac-10 champions, while
the Trojans were last year's runners
up.
Ihe two matches will not count
in the conference records, however.
These two matches will be a prel
ude to two future matches that will
take place on the Farm, with those
counting in the Pac-10 record. Nev
ertheless. the weekend will be a
great opportunity to plav high
quality opponents and give the Car
dinal a sense of where they stand

will take place Friday and Saturday,
respectively. Both will begin at 1:30
