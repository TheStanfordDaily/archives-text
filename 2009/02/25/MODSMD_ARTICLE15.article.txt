## 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 6 Stanford men's golf team took
the University of Southern California Invi
tational team and individual crowns yester
day for its first tournament win this season.
The Cardinal ripped apart some of the na
tion's top teams, finishing 10 strokes ahead
of the competition.
Unranked Brigham Young University
posted a second-place finish with an overall
three under par. followed by No. 27 Califor
nia at six over. No. I Southern California at
seven over, and No. 19 UCLA at 15 over.
"The guys have been working so hard. I
felt like it was just a matter of time before
they would earn the win." head coach Con
rad Ray said. "After losing to USC in our
last tournament, we definitely wanted to
show them what we're made of at their
home event. [Sophomore Steve) Ziegler
helped us to keep off the competition by
shooting a great final round."
Leading the way for Stanford and grab
bing his first individual tournament win was
No. No. 32 Ziegler with an overall nine
under-par score of 204. Ziegler stayed at the
top of the individual ladder throughout the
tournament, finishing the second round in a
tie for second with teammates freshman
David Chung and senior Dodge Kemmer.
To complete an already stellar perform
ance. Ziegler racked up seven birdies in the
final round to post a six-under 65. the lowest
single-round score of the tournament.
Chung earned his personal highest indi
vidual rank in this tournament, finishing in
a tie for fifth place with a four-under-par
209. Chung recorded his personal-best sin
gle-round score in the second round with a
four-under 67. and then went on to post a
one-under 70 in the final round.
Sophomore Sihwan Kim jumped 12
spots up the ranks yesterday to finish in a tie
for 10th place. Kim struggled in the first
round, posting a two-over 73. but stepped
up in the last two rounds to push him to his
even-par overall score of 213.
Dodge Kemmer claimed a piece of the
18th spot after completing the tournament
with a four-over 217. The senior began the
tournament much like Ziegler. with a two
round. two-under-par score of 139. Unfor
tunately. Kemmer was soon plagued by bo
gies and garnered a seven-over 78.
Just behind Kemmer was fellow senior
Daniel Lim with a six-over 219. Like Kem
mer. Lim had a nice first and second round,
finishing with an even-par 142. Alas, Lim's
bogies on just a couple of holes in the final
round cost him a higher finish after he com
pleted the final round with a six-over 77.
Rounding out the Cardinal were junior

round, however, when he shot a 15-over K6.
"If you put yourself in a position enough
times, you will improve regardless of what
year you are." Ray said. "Both Ziegler and
Chung have played a lot for us this year.
When we lost [junior] Joseph Bramlett to

injury this year, a lot of guys have had to
contribute more and step up to their posi
tions. I .uckily for us. it all came together this
week."
