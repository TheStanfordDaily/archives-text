### MICHAEL LAZARUS 
Two weeks ago. the Stanford women's water
polo team blew a two-goal lead against South
ern California to lose the championship game of
the Stanford Invitational.This past weekend at
the Irvine Invitational, the Cardinal nearly
watched history repeat itself en route to win
ning the Invitational for the second time in
three years.
In Irvine, the No. 1 Cardinal squared off once
again against the then-No. 1 Trojans in the title
game. With two minutes to play in regulation,
freshman Pallavi Menon scored to put Stanford
up by one. Yet just as in the first match-up be
tween the top two teams in the nation. Stanford
could not hang onto the late lead, allowing USC
to force the game into overtime tied at 10.
After a scoreless first overtime session. Stan
ford struck first in the second session on a goal
byjunior Kelly Eaton. With one minute left,the
Cardinal watched what it had already seen
twice in the young season: a USC goal to extend
the game.
In the sudden-death period.Stanford lost the
sprint, but denied the Trojans on the opening at
tack. In the only counter the Cardinal would
need, freshman Melissa Seidemann netted her
fourth goal of the game to deliver Stanford the
title and revenge.
"In both games against USC. we've scored

GAME NOTES: The women's water polo team won its sec
ond Irvine Invitational Tournament title in three years last
weekend as it racked up four victories, including a 12-11
double-overtime victory over USC in the championship
match. The No. 1 Cardinal will now host San Jose State,
one of the teams it beat in the Irvine Tournament, at Avery
Aquatic Center on Saturday afternoon.

and given up goals in bunches," said head coach
John Tanner. "The difference this time was sim
ple — we played better defense in the overtime
periods."
Stanford reached the championship game
after surviving a grueling three-game stretch
against No. 16 UC-San Diego. No. 8 San Jose
State and No. 3 Hawaii.
ITie Cardinal opened up the Invi
tational on Feb. 21 with the easiest
game it would have all weekend, de
feating IJC'SD Ui-6. All-American
senior Lauren Silver, sidelined with
injuries tor the first eight games,
paced Stanford with three goals in
her season debut. Freshmen Alyssa
Lo and Menon each added hat tricks
as well.
"Lolo [Silver] was excited to be
back in the water "Tanner said. "She
added some energy and scored a lew
important goals"
Stanford hardly had time to cele
brate before jumping back in the
pool for the second game of the dou
bleheader versus San Jose State.
Buoyed by two more goals by Silver
and three from Seidemann. the Car
dinal jumped on the Spartans early

and often, winning 13-7.
In the semifinal match against
Hawaii on Feb. 22. Stanford was in
an unfamiliar place — trailing.
I lawaii led 5-4 at the end of the first
quarter.putting the Cardinal's hopes
of avenging its loss against USC in
jeopardy. Stanford's defense, al
though shaky at times this season,
came through for the Cardinal, al
lowing only five more goals the rest
of the game and giving the high-pow
ered offense a chance to win the
game.
()nce again.Seidemann and Silver
delivered. I"he duo.already one of the
most feared scoring threats in a mere
four games, scored six goals to lead
Stanford to an 11-10 victory and
championship game berth.
ITiis Saturday, Stanford will see
what it's like playing a team looking
for revenge, as it rematches San Jose.
While the C ardinal had the best of
the Spartans in Irvine. Tanner is not
expecting another eas\ victory.
"San Jose is a challenge to play
against because they have si/e,speed

and shooting" he said. "Their play
against us Saturday was a poor indi
cator of their ability, because they got
in foul trouble right away."
Stanford, though, has a simple an
swer to the Spartans' athleticism:
depth.
"All 17 players who suited up
made significant contributions dur
ing the weekend, and lh played
against I JSC while we built our lead."
Tanner said."Teams normally rely on
11 or 12 in a game like that."
Stanford will surely look to its
bench this weekend to counter San
Jose's aggressive play. With so many
quality players on Stanford's roster,
the Cardinal can afford to give its
starters rests throughout the game,
keeping them fresh and effective. If
the game is close heading into the
fourth period, Stanford will have the
advantage.
I"he rematch starts at 1 p.m this
Saturday at Avery Aquatic Center
