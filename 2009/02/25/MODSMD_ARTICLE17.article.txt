# Sports shouldn't be free ride

### 
Stanford Athletics lias faced
two major problems this
year: a growing budget
deficit and the lack of stu
dent interest and attendance at
sporting events. As previously re
ported by The Daily, Stanford sports
continue to lose money, and budget
cuts are looming. Additionally, mem
bership in the Sixth Man Club — the
student section at men's basketball
games and the only sport students
must pay to attend — is about half of
what it was a year ago.
Although it may sound counterin
tuitive on the surface, there is a sim
ple way to help case both problems:
start charging students for other
sports, especially football.
Currently, students can pay $65
for season tickets to men's basket
ball, and every other sport is free.
However, when attendance at men's
basketball, as well as other sports,
was well higher in years past, men's
basketball was not the only sport
fans paid to attend.
After going 111 in 2006, student
seats in the Red Zone — the student
section at football games — were
made free, maybe understandably so.
However, the team is now much im
proved. while the men's basketball
team is in a down year, making the
idea of charging for one of the
school's least successful sports a bit
confusing.
So here is a proposition that
seems to fulfill all goals. Charge $100
for access to men's basketball games
and football games. II the athletic de
partment sees fit, even make that
$100 go toward women's basketball
and baseball as well — two other
sports that are historically popuhir
