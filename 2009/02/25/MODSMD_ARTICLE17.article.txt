# Sports shouldn't be free ride
## 
### 
Stanford Athletics lias faced
two major problems this
year: a growing budget
deficit and the lack of stu
dent interest and attendance at
sporting events. As previously re
ported by The Daily, Stanford sports
continue to lose money, and budget
cuts are looming. Additionally, mem
bership in the Sixth Man Club — the
student section at men's basketball
games and the only sport students
must pay to attend — is about half of
what it was a year ago.
Although it may sound counterin
tuitive on the surface, there is a sim
ple way to help case both problems:
start charging students for other
sports, especially football.
Currently, students can pay $65
for season tickets to men's basket
ball, and every other sport is free.
However, when attendance at men's
basketball, as well as other sports,
was well higher in years past, men's
basketball was not the only sport
fans paid to attend.
After going 111 in 2006, student
seats in the Red Zone — the student
section at football games — were
made free, maybe understandably so.
However, the team is now much im
proved. while the men's basketball
team is in a down year, making the
idea of charging for one of the
school's least successful sports a bit
confusing.
So here is a proposition that
seems to fulfill all goals. Charge $100
for access to men's basketball games
and football games. II the athletic de
partment sees fit, even make that
$100 go toward women's basketball
and baseball as well — two other
sports that are historically popuhir

with Stanford students.
Under the plan, it seems unlikely
that the $35 increase in price for
men's basketball fans would deter
many who already pay $65 from buy
ing tickets. These students wouid
then also have an incentive to attend
other Stanford sporting events.
ITie argument is even stronger on
the other side. Football fans who pay
the fee to see a much-improved team
would now also have tickets to men's
basketball games — something they
lacked in the past — and thus may
attend those as well, helping to fill
the student section.
The idea that fans must only pay
for one sport makes that sport all the
more unattractive to those same
fans. Students can go watch the
fourth-ranked women's basketball
team for free instead of paying to see
the men's basketball team fight to
stay out of the cellar in the Pac-10.
By charging for a combination of
fans, there will undoubtedly be an
overlapping of interest that leads to

larger crowds at all encompassed
Stanford sporting events.
This means a packed Red Zone
and a louder Sixth Man Club.
If you include the women's bas
ketball team and highly ranked base
ball team in the equation, it likely
means larger crowds at their games
as well.
Then there is the economic aspect
of this. By no means am 1 arguing
that charging an extra $35 is going to
solve a massive budget crisis, but 1
am saying that it eould help. It could,
in fact, be the difference between
having to out an entire sport and just
having to eut members of coaching
staffs.
As a member of the Stanford
Sixth Man Club — it pains me to say
it — maybe it is good that the athlet
ie department is selling seats in the
student section for the games against
the L.A. schools this weekend. Fans
have shown lukewarm support for
the team all season, and the depart
ment is in dire need of the income.
That being said, the athletic de
partment might not have had to
make this decision had it simply
been charging for sports other then
men's basketball. I lopefully this will
be the last season in which this is the

case and we can soon return to the
days of camping out before basket
ball games and filling up the Red
Zone.
