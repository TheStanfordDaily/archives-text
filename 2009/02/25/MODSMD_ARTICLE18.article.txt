## Women gear up for Pac-10 challenge Card readies itself for a tough conference tournament 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
ITie Stanford women's swimming and diving team
looks to continue its conference domination as the un
defeated Cardinal heads to Federal Way. Wash, for the
Pac-10 Championships this week.
No. 2 Stanford (20-0, 7-0 Pac-10) comes into the
meet riding a wave of momentum. The team has won
19 straight Pac-10 dual meets and 41 ol its last 42 head
to-head competitions. I fowever, members of the team
are aware that postseason competition is a new obsta
cle that must be overcome. Stanford coach Lea Maur
er views the Pac-lOs as an opportunity to continue to
grow and improve as a team.
"The scoring for the championship meet is differ
ent, so we are looking to get as many qualifiers to
N( A As as possible," Maurer said. "Last year we had
14 people go to NCAAs and we are hoping to match
or beat that this year."
Ilie Pac-10 boasts one of the deepest conferences
in collegiate swimming. Six teams, including Stanford,
currently rank inside the top-25, with Arizona and
California joining the Cardinal in the top-10. Stanford
had relatively little trouble managing its inter-confer
ence rivals, but nonetheless displayed vulnerability on
occasion, narrowly defeating teams in last-minute ef
forts.
Despite Stanford's conference success, Maurer was
quick to dismiss the possibility of her team as the fa
vorite to win the meet. She sees Arizona, the defend
ing Pac-lOand national champion,as the team to beat.
"Arizona is the favorite team — they have won the
last 2 years and they won NCAAs last year." she
noted.
Fortunately for Cardinal fans, Stanford has already
proven that it is capable of defeating its toughest op
ponent. Stanford won, arguably, its most impressive
meet of the season on Jan. 24. when it beat the Wildcats
in Tlicson. The 150.5-147.5 victory came in dramatic
fashion, with Stanford rallying in the final few events to
secure a win.
A major key to success for Stanford, as has been
stressed time and time again by veteran members of
the team, is keeping its new. inexperienced swimmers
confident and focused. Although this appeared diffi
cult earlier in the year, the talented freshman class has
improved exponentially.
Freshman Betsy Webh leads this group, having al
ready qualified for the NCAA Championships with
her outstanding 100-yard backstroke swim in last
week's regular season finale at Cal.The Cardinal will
look to qualify more young swimmers for NCAAs.
which begin on Mar. 19.
"We are focusing on maximizing our potential"
Maurer said.
Although the Pac-lOs are at the top of Stanford's
priority list, the team is also looking ahead to NCAAs
where it will be in search of its ninth national title, and
first under Maurer. Barring any colossal upset durum
the conference championships, Stanford will enter na
tionals ranked No. 2,just behind Georgia.
When asked about Stanford's chances in the final
meet of the season, Maurer was once again reluctant to
speak too highly of the team.
" rhe NCAA meet is going to be incredible," sh«.
said. "I can't predict or control what others do."
For Stanford swimming fans, anything less than a
Pac-10 championship may seem like
a disappointment, despite the team's
regular season performance. With a
talented core of veterans with
NCAA and even Olympic experi
ence. this squad could end up as one
of the best in the programs illustri
ous history.
However, as Maurer and the rest
of the Stanford team understand,
there is a lot of swimming left, and
only time will tell where the team fin
ishes the season.
The Pac-10 Championships begin
today in Federal Way, Wash.
