# WOMEN'S LACROSSE
## Orange slices Card women Syracuse hands Stanford its first loss 
### ALISSA HABER 
The No. 17 Stanford women's
lacrosse team suffered its first loss
of the season last Friday in a wild
non-conference match against No. 3
Syracuse, eventually falling 15-10.
The first half of the game was up
and-down for the Cardinal. After

falling behind early by five goals,
Stanford rallied back to tie the score
at 8-8 by halftime.
But in the second half, the Cardi
nal could not keep up with the Syra
cuse offense, who responded with
six unanswered goals to start the pe
riod. The Cardinal would have been
shut out entirely in the second half
had it not been for late scores from
sophomores Ashley Aruffo and
Maggie Sachs.
Stanford was led by sophomore
Leslie Foard and junior Lauren
Schmidt, both of whom tallied two

first-half goals. Sophomore goalie
Annie Read recorded seven saves in
net — six in the first half — to keep
the Cardinal in the game.
Although Syracuse ran away in
the second half, Stanford head
coach Amy Bokker believes that the
score is not indicative of her team's
ability to compete with top-ranked
teams.
"We really fought to play with a
team of that caliber," she told
GoStanford.com. "To be in the
game is a real positive in knowing
where we are as a team."
With the loss, the Cardinal drops
to 3-1 on the season, its first loss
under Bokker.
This week, the Cardinal looks to
bounce back from its first loss as the
women travel to play conference
opponent UC'-Davis tonight at 7
p.m. This match comes the day after
Lauren Schmidt was named the
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
(MPSF) co-Player of the Week for
her performances against Syracuse
and Albany last week.
The junior attack, back in the
starting lineup after missing last
year due to a season-ending injury,
totaled five goals and two assists in
last week's games against the Great
Danes and the Orangewomen.
Schmidt is the third Stanford player
to receive MPSF Player of the Week
honors this season.
UC-Davis is 1-1 on the season
and is coming off of a double-over
time victory against conference op
ponent Saint Mary's. Sophomore
midfielder Gina Hoffmire led the
Aggies with four goals, the last prov
ing to be the game winner in the sec
ond overtime period. The perform
ance garnered her co-Player of the
Week honors to share with Stan
ford's Schmidt.
In order to get back on track, the
Cardinal will need a big game from
attack/midfielder Dana Lindsay.
The junior is the Cardinal's leading
scorer on the season, tallying 10
goals and four assists, to go along
with a .556 shooting percentage.
The game against Davis will be
Stanford's third conference game of
the year, with the first two resulting
in blowout victories over Oregon
and Fresno State.
With a win, Stanford will put it
self in a great position to win the
MPSF. as the women will be unde
feated halfway through the six
game conference schedule, with
only three MPSF opponents re
maining: Saint Mary's, the Univer
sity of Denver and rival Califor
nia.
