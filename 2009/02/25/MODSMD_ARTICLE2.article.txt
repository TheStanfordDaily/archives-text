## Campaign spending bill rejected Senate disputes with GSC over reform; bill fails, 9-3 
### MARISA LANDICHO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
During a clash over instituting a cam
paign spending cap, upset Graduate
Student Council (GSC) representatives
and undergraduate senators wrestled with
maintaining civility at last night's Senate
meeting. Following a divisive discussion,
the Senate rejected the spending cap bill
and in effect denied half of the Executive's
program to reform the ASSIJ election
process.
I Vie bill, which has been consistently
supported by the majority of the GSC.
would have limited campaign spending for
each candidate to $1,500 — any legislative
candidate or executive slate that exceeded
the limit would be summarily disqualified
by the Elections Commission.
While the GSC handily passed a ver
sion of the bill at its Feb. IK meeting, the
same bill failed 9-3 last night, with two sen
ators absent.
The two GSC members who attended
last night's Senate meeting. Co-Chair
Polina Segalova. a third-year mechanical
engineering graduate student, and third
year chemical engineering graduate stu
dent Ryan Peacock, were forced to defend
the bill against an at times hostile Senate.
Senator Luukas lives '09, a Daily
columnist, opened up the discussion with a
slew of constitutional and policy objec
tions. I lis written handout enumerated five
problems with the bill, along with relevant
cases considered by the Constitutional
Council in the past 10 years.
"We're knowingly undercutting the law
here." lives said, referencing the possible
legal challenges that might come from the
bill. 1 le argued that a spending cap would
be a restriction of students' free speech
rights.
Segalova discounted the related cases
because thev weren't at a time when exec
utive slates were spending thousands of
dollars on their campaigns. Moreover, she
claimed his constitutional quibbles were
irrelevant for approving the bill.
"1 don't want people to shy away from
this bill out of fear of invoking the
Constitutional Council," she said. "They
are supposed to be a body that is engaged."
lives had more problems with the regu
lations, stating that the agreed amount was
arbitrary, the process would encourage
cheating and there was no way to properly
enforce the regulations. He detailed how
third-party groups, particularly campus
newspapers, could effectively campaign for
candidates and subvert the monetary cap.
Senator Orr Keshet '09 was both highly
critical of the bill and also offended by the
tone of the GSC members.
"I really don't think (the bill] is going to
work." he said. "There are so many kx>p
holes to exploit."
Others were more sympathetic to the
bill, but wanted a lesser punishment for
those who violated the terms. Deputy
Chair Patrick Cordova '09 thought the bill
included "ten) dramatic of a punishment."
The few Senate supporters, GSC repre
sentatives and Vice President l agan Harris
'09 wanted the rest of the Senate to look
past the wording and instead approve the
spirit of the bill.
"We are seeing ridiculous amounts
of money being spent on elections and
we are seeing people who are unable
to run on the basis of funding," said
Senator Yvorn "Doc" Aswad-Thomas
'11. "Money, quite frankly, is a barrier
to getting people elected."
Many other universities already
have spending caps on elections.
Claremont McKenna limits candidates
to $40. while Yale currently has a cap of
$50 and Harvard has a cap of $4(X),
according to Senator Jonathan
McMaster '11. Belli are significantly
below the proposed $1,500 cap pre
sented 10 the Senate.
Nevertheless, only three senators
approved the spending cap bill, disap
pointing the GSC members and the
Executives.
A second bill dealing with elections
reform fared better in the Senate.
Ten senators approved a public
financing bill, which would reimburse
executive slates for campaign costs up
to $750. Keshet was the only senator to
disagree.
"[The bill] gives false hope for peo
ple thinking they can run without
money." Keshet said. Earlier in the
meeting, he had stated that winning
the election was 90 percent about
money.
Harris, who spent over $3,500 on
his campaign with Jonny Dorsey '09,
said that $1,500 was enough to win an
election. 1 le claimed that $2.2(X) spent
by his slate went towards T-shirts that
were never disseminated and, there
fore, did not affect his win.
Amendments to the public financ
ing bill will be approved at next week's
meeting. Another bill to be considered
next week is a resolution to support
community centers on campus.
Other items on the agenda includ
ed plans for finalizing the second wave
of student budget input and the possi
ble creation of a public relations repre
sentative or press secretary for next
year's Undergraduate Senate.
