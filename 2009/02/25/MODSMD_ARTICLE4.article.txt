### ZOE RICHARDS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Jackson Katz attempted to per
suade more men to join the cause
against violence directed towards
women last night in C'ubberley
Auditorium.
The educator, author and filmmak
er spoke about the problem of defin
ing gender violence as a women's issue
and the importance of establishing ini
tiatives of prevention. Self-proclaimed
feminists and curious students alike
welcomed his talk, who saw Katz's lec
ture as an opportunity to become
more involved in a movement towards
gender equality.
Donnovan Somera Yisrael. staff
advisor for Men Against Abuse Now
(MAAN) introduced Katz bv describ

ing the activist's accomplishments,
including his position in the U.S.
Secretary of Defense's Task Force on
Domestic Violence in the military
from 2(K)()-2(K)3. award-winning films
and a new book. The Macho Paradox,
as well as the Mentors in Violence
Prevention (MVP) initiative that Katz
launched in 1993 to galvanize profes
sional athletes in the fight to end vio
lence against women. A football star in
college himself. Katz was the first male
at his alma mater to obtain a minor in
women's studies.
Katz's address paid particular atten
tion to the role of Stanford students as
future leaders. He emphasized that
men should take the responsibility to
denounce gender violence and to chal
lenge other men over insensitive
actions such as misogynistic comments.

"Most men are not rapists," Katz
said."ln a nutshell, we need more men
to break the complicit silence."
Katz reinforced the gravity of his
message with footage from his film
"Tough Guise." which compiled clips
of media representations in the music
and wrestling industries of dominating,
violent men exercising power over
hyper-sexualized images of women.
He also challenged the journalistic
tendency to sympathize with perpetra
tors of gender violence.
Katz sent waves of laughter
through the crowd when he challenged
the negative propaganda that has
sought to silence women's rights
activists.
