## Katz talks gender violence 
### ZOE RICHARDS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Jackson Katz attempted to per
suade more men to join the cause
against violence directed towards
women last night in C'ubberley
Auditorium.
The educator, author and filmmak
er spoke about the problem of defin
ing gender violence as a women's issue
and the importance of establishing ini
tiatives of prevention. Self-proclaimed
feminists and curious students alike
welcomed his talk, who saw Katz's lec
ture as an opportunity to become
more involved in a movement towards
gender equality.
Donnovan Somera Yisrael. staff
advisor for Men Against Abuse Now
(MAAN) introduced Katz bv describ

ing the activist's accomplishments,
including his position in the U.S.
Secretary of Defense's Task Force on
Domestic Violence in the military
from 2(K)()-2(K)3. award-winning films
and a new book. The Macho Paradox,
as well as the Mentors in Violence
Prevention (MVP) initiative that Katz
launched in 1993 to galvanize profes
sional athletes in the fight to end vio
lence against women. A football star in
college himself. Katz was the first male
at his alma mater to obtain a minor in
women's studies.
Katz's address paid particular atten
tion to the role of Stanford students as
future leaders. He emphasized that
men should take the responsibility to
denounce gender violence and to chal
lenge other men over insensitive
actions such as misogynistic comments.

"Most men are not rapists," Katz
said."ln a nutshell, we need more men
to break the complicit silence."
Katz reinforced the gravity of his
message with footage from his film
"Tough Guise." which compiled clips
of media representations in the music
and wrestling industries of dominating,
violent men exercising power over
hyper-sexualized images of women.
He also challenged the journalistic
tendency to sympathize with perpetra
tors of gender violence.
Katz sent waves of laughter
through the crowd when he challenged
the negative propaganda that has
sought to silence women's rights
activists.

Renowned author and filmmaker Jackson Katz speaks to students
at Cubberley Auditorium about redefining the masculine image
and the need to curb violence against women.
pie." he said. "If you are not a femi
nist. how do you proclaim yourself a
proud American?"
On a more sobering note. Katz
noted that violence contradicts basic
desires for human connection.
"Violence and trauma are the
antithesis of the intimacy that we
intend to aspire," Katz said, empha
sizing the need to acknowledge
men's humanity and make them
aware of the fact that violence
against women is a very personal
issue for them as well.
Katz urged the audience to re
define how society socializes young
boys, focusing heavily on the institu
tional forces of American culture
that are producing a pandemic of
abusive men.
"Boys can either rise to our
expectations or sink to our expecta
tions," he said. "It's anti-intellectual
to say that [abusive] men are aberra
tions as opposed to products of our

culture."
MA AN member Nick Isaacs '12
agreed.
"(Gender violence] is not an issue
people really think about" he said.
"It's on the news all the time, but I
always saw abusive men as socio
pathic killers and thought there was
nothing I could do."
Isaacs' sentiments seemed to
echo those of many students who
admitted to having friends who have
experienced sexual abuse.
"My sister raised me as a feminist,
so some of my first political thoughts
were on the equality of women." said
Sam King '12. "I'm always looking
for ways to inspire myself to chal
lenge violent comments against
women."
Yet for Katz, the fundamental
crux lies in altering the male perspec
tive i)n gender issues and what it to
means to be a "man."
"It men can feel these issues in
our hearts, they can create change."
Katz said. "That's Social Justice
101."
