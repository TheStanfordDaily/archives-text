# IDENTITY THIEF
## UNIV. DISTANCES ITSELF FROM R. ALLEN STANFORD 
### PAUL CRAFT 
llie Stanford name has been in headlines
around the world as of late, hut it hasn't been
the University that's gaining worldwide atten
tion.
Robert Allen Stanford, a Texas-born
investor worth an estimated $2.2 billion, has
been accused of large-scale, on-going fraud
through his Houston-based investment firm,
Stanford Financial Group. On Feb. IIJ.l l J. the FBI
served papers to R. Allen Stanford after a
weeklong search, the culmination of a lengthy
$K billion fraud investigation by the SEC.
The high-profile scandal has been cause for
concern on campus, striking at the heart of one
of the University's most prized possessions —
its brand name.
Within days of the start of Stanford Financial
Group's legal troubles, the University forcefully
distanced itself from any possible association
with the Texas billionaire and his companies.
"Stanford University is aware of media
reports that the Securities and Exchange
Commission filed a civil action in federal court
today against Robert Allen Stanford and three
of his companies, including Stanford Financial
Group," read a public statement from the
University. "Stanford Financial Group and
other companies associated with Robert Allen
Stanford are in no way affiliated with or related
to Stanford University."
This statement was only one attempt by the
University to distance itself from R. Allen
Stanford. In the past decade, the University has
disavowed a number of ties with the business
man and his companies in an attempt to pre
serve its name and brand.
Last year, the University took Stanford
Financial Group to court, in what is now an on
going legal battle. On Oct. 2 l ). 2(K)<S. the
University's Board of Trustees filed a trade
mark infringement complaint against the
Stanford Financial Group Company in U.S.
District Court in the Northern District of
California.
While the original complaint has been
amended several times, the University's basic
goal is the protection of its trademarked goods
and name.
"Defendants Stanford Financial Group
Company — are using confusingly similar imi
tations of Stanford's registered mark STAN
FORD and the Stanford Trade Dress (as
defined herein) in connection with its goods,
services and events that it sponsors," read the
latest complaint filed on Jan. If).
TTie Office of the General Council, which
represents the University, has also weighed in
on the matter.
"The University has an active enforcement
program," said senior University counsel
Patrick Dunkley. "We aggressively enforce our
trademark."
ITie University had trademarked the word
"Stanford," known as the Stanford mark, first in
IW2 and again in IW9. It also claims ownership
over the Stanford mark in association with the
color Cardinal and Stanford apparel.
"The public has come to associate the
STANFORD Mark alone, and the STAN

FORD Mark in connection with the color
Cardinal, with excellence, innovation and out
standing achievement in scholarship, business,
science and technology, medicine, law. engineer
ing. the arts and athletics and government."
reads the complaint.
While R.Allen Stanford owns the trademark
for the word group "Stanford Financial Group"
and "Stanford Wealth Management." he does
not have the right to use any names similar to
the University's trademarks.
"Stanford Financial Group is a registered
mark." Dunkley said. "But over the course of
time, the group has attempted to register marks
beyond just Stanford Financial Group and to
use just Stanford instead of Stanford Financial
Group."
The University alleges that R. Allen
Stanford used "willfully confusing imitations" of
the Stanford brand on his company Web site, on
company apparel, advertisements in The New
York Times and sponsorships of various sport
ing events.
In particular, the University's lawsuit targets
R. Allen Stanford's Caribbean cricket empire.
In 2(KM. he first funded the building of the S(HH)-
seat Stanford Cricket Ground on the island of
Antigua. Since then, cricket apparel and equip
ment have been emblazoned with just the name
"Stanford."
The University's lawsuit seeks to stop
Stanford Financial Group from using any trade
mark that can be misinterpreted as part of the
Stanford I Iniversity brand. It also hopes to gain

as damages all profits that R. Allen Stanford
accumulated as a result of his implied connec
tion to the University, an amount to be deter
mined by the court.
The hearing is set for March 20 in the U.S.
District Court in San Francisco.
Stanford's "Ties" to the University
Adding to the confusion over the Stanford
name has been R. Allen Stanford's claims of
familial connections to Leland Stanford,
Stanford University's founder.
In the Stanford Financial Group's 2(XH mag
azine. Allen Stanford claimed that his great
great-great grandfather was related to Josiah
Stanford, father of Leland Stanford.
rhe company magazine also featured a
photo of R. Allen Stanford, his father James
Stanford, and former Governor of California
Gray Davis standing on the front steps of
I eland Stanford Mansion in Sacramento.
"I am not aware of any genealogical rela
tionship between Allen Stanford, founder of
Stanford Financial, and Leland Stanford," said
Susan Weinstein. director of business develop
ment and University privacy. "Of course this
does not mean that there is not a distant rela
tionship — but it does not show up in any of our
records." ("$2.5 million donor claims ties to
Stanfords," May 23.2(KKi)
In July of 2(K)1. Allen Stanford donated $2.5
million to the Leland Stanford Mansion


LEFTERIS PITARAKIS/The Associated Pres;

ing that the Texas businessman has unrightfully use its copyrighted "Stanford mark." R. Aller

Foundation. Former Stanford
Professor Peter McCuen founded
this organization in 1991 to restore
the Sacramento mansion built by
Leland Stanford. Today, the mansion
hosts official state functions.
R. Allen Stanford's donation also
coincided with Stanford Financial
Group's entrance into the California
market. According to The
Sacramento Bee. the group
announced its intentions to do busi
ness in California in 1996, but only
became active in 2001.
That same year. Allen Stanford
also gave $KK).(KK) to the re-election
campaign of former California Gov.
Gray Davis, whose wife was the hon
orary chair of the Leland Stanford
Mansion Foundation at the time.
To this day, R. Allen Stanford
remains a member of the organiza
tion's board, according to the founda

tion's Web site. A foundation
spokesman was not available for
comment.
In 2(X)4. R. Allen Stanford again
insinuated relations to Leland
Stanford during a company promo
tional video, according to Stanford
University's most recent complaint.
"I am proud to say that we have
been a major financial supporter for
restoration of the Leland Stanford
Mansion in Sacramento, helping to
preserve an important piece of
California and Stanford family histo
ry." R.Allen Stanford said in the film.
University archivists have never
encountered a connection between
R. Allen Stanford and the Stanford
family that left New York in the mid
19th century and settled in the Bay
Area. He himself has never provided
any genealogical evidence.
But for now, R. Allen Stanford's
only relationship with the University,
it seems, is as a defendant in the
University's trademark complaint.
