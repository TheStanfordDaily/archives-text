## Row faces multiple blackouts 
### LIZ STARK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A series of electricity blackouts hit
Upper Row residences in recent
weeks—power was cut as recently as
Sunday night, marking the third such
outage in the last six months.
According to Rich Bitting, power
systems manager for the University's
utilities division, the blackouts, which
lasted from 7:15 p.m. to midnight, were
caused by a fallen tree on an off-cam
pus Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E)
power line on Alpine Road.
Upper Row houses are one area on
campus where electricity is provided
through individual house accounts
with PG&E, instead of Stanford utili
ties. In addition to residents of the
Upper Row. faculty houses and 1350
total PG&E customers were affected
by the blackouts.
Bitting reported that power went in
and out during those five hours as
PG&E workers examined the wires.
"[P( i&F.) has to send people physi
cally out there in the rain and the wind,
and that's why it takes so long." Bitting
said. "They had to try a couple of dif
ferent things, and that's the line crews
out there trying to do their work,"
Igor Popov '09, residential assistant
(RA) for Slavianksii Dom. also report
ed blackouts during the weekend
before.
"When the rain started last week
end. we had a few blackouts and the
power was mostly out for an hour or
so." Popov said. "(This past Sunday]
night, it was on and off for two hours."
Sunday night. Popov called other
houses on the Upper Row and con
finned that all student residences south
of Campus Drive were experiencing
blackouts.
Phi Sig I louse Manager Cassie Kull
*10 spoke with the Housing Office,
which did not have a time estimate for
the return of the power.
"The most frustrating thing is that
the Internet router stopped working."
Kull said. "That was the biggest prob
lem with doing homework, which is
what everyone wanted to do."

Kull said that the level of frustra
tion varied in Phi Sig.
"The people who had lots of home
work were upset, but then they moved
pretty quiekly to the library." Kull said.
"Most people were calm although
inconvenienced."
Executive Director of Student
Housing Rodger Whitney said in an
email to The Daily that Housing
learned of Sunday's power blackout
from the after-hours maintenance hot
line.
"As is our standard process, the
supervisor on duty for maintenance
checked in with PG&E to learn about
the cause and expected duration of
the outage" Whitney said.
"Maintenance staff checks the build
ings impacted when power goes down
and again when it comes back on."
Although Whitney described the
outages as "irregular." Bitting said
residences serviced by PG&E have
been subject to more outages than
those receiving electricity from the
University.
"The south side of campus, which
includes the faculty, staff and student
housing area in the hills. PG&E
serves those buildings as individual
customers rather than the
University" Bitting said. "We've had
problems in the past because a lot of
their electrical lines are traditional
overhead wire distribution systems."
Bitting indicated that these over
head wires are more susceptible to
weather-related failures than the
underground alternative.
"Some of the existing equipment
in the housing back there is very old."
he added. "Some of those houses
were built in the 19205, and some of
the systems out there are probably
original."
Because the contracts with PG&E
are in the name of the individual
houses and not the University, the
University has no direct control over if
and when the overhead lines will be
replaced. The University only provides
electricity to central campus buildings
such as the Main Quad, libraries, labs
and Escondido Road residences
through a series of underground

power lines from the Cardinal Cogen
plant.
According to Whitney, I lousing will
meet with Facilities Operations and
PG&E next week to "discuss recent
outages and PG&E's plans to improve
their equipment and response times."
Bitting stated that the University
has no plans to expand its utilities to
cover the Upper Row and faculty
housing.
"It would be a major staffing issue
to try to take over that many individual
services." Bitting said. "We deal with a
bunch of large buildings... there'd be
a lot of work with new power lines...
and there's been no discussion of that."
He then went on to defend
PG&E's ability to adequately service
Upper Row houses.
"PG&E is perfectly capable of pro
viding good service," Bitting said. "We
just need to keep pushing them to
update their technology... they actu
ally do a pretty good job given the
immensity of what they deal with."
