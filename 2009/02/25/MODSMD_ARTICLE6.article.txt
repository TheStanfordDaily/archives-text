### LIZ STARK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A series of electricity blackouts hit
Upper Row residences in recent
weeksâ€”power was cut as recently as
Sunday night, marking the third such
outage in the last six months.
According to Rich Bitting, power
systems manager for the University's
utilities division, the blackouts, which
lasted from 7:15 p.m. to midnight, were
caused by a fallen tree on an off-cam
pus Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E)
power line on Alpine Road.
Upper Row houses are one area on
campus where electricity is provided
through individual house accounts
with PG&E, instead of Stanford utili
ties. In addition to residents of the
Upper Row. faculty houses and 1350
total PG&E customers were affected
by the blackouts.
Bitting reported that power went in
and out during those five hours as
PG&E workers examined the wires.
"[P( i&F.) has to send people physi
cally out there in the rain and the wind,
and that's why it takes so long." Bitting
said. "They had to try a couple of dif
ferent things, and that's the line crews
out there trying to do their work,"
Igor Popov '09, residential assistant
(RA) for Slavianksii Dom. also report
ed blackouts during the weekend
before.
"When the rain started last week
end. we had a few blackouts and the
power was mostly out for an hour or
so." Popov said. "(This past Sunday]
night, it was on and off for two hours."
Sunday night. Popov called other
houses on the Upper Row and con
finned that all student residences south
of Campus Drive were experiencing
blackouts.
Phi Sig I louse Manager Cassie Kull
*10 spoke with the Housing Office,
which did not have a time estimate for
the return of the power.
"The most frustrating thing is that
the Internet router stopped working."
Kull said. "That was the biggest prob
lem with doing homework, which is
what everyone wanted to do."
