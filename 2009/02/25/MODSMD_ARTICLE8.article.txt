## In Paris, they live la vie Students get immersed in French language and culture through Bing 
### JENNIFER RABEDEAU 
Y — cliches about Paris exist for a
reason. It is the 'City of Light'
where people gather in cafes to
discuss politics and current events
m over coffee and pastries. I"he mys
tique of Paris draws people from all around
the world to this cosmopolitan center, and
Stanford students are no exception.
Ihe first Stanford Overseas Studies
Program in France opened in 1960 in the city
of'lours, and the center moved to its current
location in Paris in 1991. Paris offers Stanford
students a unique variety of activities both
through the program ;md throughout the city
itself.
"Paris is a haven to anyone and every
one," said Jenny Mullowney, overseas semi
nars and programmatic research coordinator.
"It's a mosaic experience."
Ihe academic coursework is only one ele
ment of the Paris program.
"The center staff is organized about let
ting students know what opportunities are
available through the program," Mullowney
said.
Prior to the start of the program and dur
ing the orientation, the center staff informs
students about internships and volunteer
opportunities. Students are also strongly
encouraged to sign up for the language part
ner program, which pairs Stanford students
with French students from local universities.
For students staying two or more quarters in
Paris, the program offers opportunities to
take classes at other Parisian universities
such as the Sorbonne.
Ihe center also encourages students to
attend lectures, which are given throughout
the city and cover topics ranging from
medieval art to politics to fashion. Students

can choose lectures which
interest them while immers
ing themselves in Parisian
culture and the French lan
guage.
Maggie Oran '09 had a
unique experience through
the Paris program. She spent
winter quarter 2008 studying
with the program, and
returned to Paris during the
summer to continue the
internship she had begun
during that year.
"I enjoyed the experience
of living where 1 had to speak
a different language each
day." she said. "It was fun to
see the progression of my lan
guage skills: I improved expo
nentially the entire time. I
began understanding even
before I was comfortable
speaking. There were days
when I just didn't want to
speak French, but it was
rewarding."
The Bing Overseas
Studies Program strongly
encourages students to live in

a homestay while studying in Paris to further
develop their speaking abilities.
"It's culturally more beneficial," said Lee
Dukes, student relations specialist. "It helps
with the language. You have to speak French
while you're in the house."
Jessica Long '09, who studied in Paris dur
ing spring quarter of 2008. particularly
enjoyed her homestay experience.
"I liked the idea of living with a host
mother," she said. "It was engaging and excit
ing to interact with such an interesting per-

son. The homestay experience was the closest
glimpse I had into what it means to be
French."
Despite the numerous opportunities
afforded by the center and the structure of
the Paris program, the best way to discover
and familiarize oneself with Parisian culture
is to explore the city and take advantage of
what it has to offer.
"You will not learn French by going there
expecting to be a sponge and absorb every
thing," Mullowney said. "You can't stay in the

computer lab at the center."
Paris has something to
offer everyone — from the
'foodie' to the art geek to the
fashionista.
Paris is well-known for its
food, and as such, the city is
the foodie's paradise. There is
cheap food everywhere that
is highly popular with the
Stanford students — crepe
stands and falafel counters,
such as L'As du Fallafel, a
falafel stand that is a cult
favorite among Stanford stu
dents and the general popula
tion alike. The famous
Parisian cafes are also a pop
ular student hang-out.
For Stanford students who
enjoy history or art. there are
dozens of museums in Paris
to explore. Even Parisian
architecture is a window to
the city's rich history. The
ruins of the Roman baths,
Notre-Dame, the Louvre and
the Centre Pompidou the
millennia of Paris's history.

And of course there are
the famous shopping districts. Still, the city
offers more than just the traditional tourist
destinations.
"My absolute favorite thing to do was pick
a Metro stop I had never been to and walk
around," Long said. "You can discover things
like gardens, parks and museums you could
never have found if you stayed in the touristy
parts of Paris."
Perhaps the largest adjustment for
Stanford students beyond simply the lan
guage barrier is the urban experience.

Program Director Estelle Halevi identifies
this transition as "acculturation not assimila
tion." F or both Oran and Long, the Paris pro
gram was the first time either had lived in a
city, let alone a foreign city.
"In Paris, everyone has their 'metro face'
on all the time," Oran said. "You have to
learn how to be alone —how to be in your
own head. You learn to enjoy things around
you and can get lost in your thoughts without
being lonely. I would walk around and try to
blend in."
And while the adjustment is difficult, it is
surely rewarding.
"After the summer, I was comfortable
there in a way I wouldn't have been after one
quarter." Oran said. "Now I 'm more comfort
able with the idea of moving away after col
lege."
When students return from Paris, many
have to readjust to life on the Farm, throwing
the Stanford experience in sharp contrast
with the experience of life in Paris.
"I see Stanford differently; its more like a
bubble" Oran said. " But I enjoy Stanford bet
ter because I know myself better now. I know
what I like to do and how I want to spend my
time."
Although Long rejected the idea of the
Stanford bubble, she agrees that time away
brings a unique perspective to life on campus.
"In France, there's less emphasis on mean
ingful productive work than on life," she said.
" ITie French invest a sense of importance in
being well-educated, in eating good things
and in thinking about beauty. The Paris pro
gram allows you to see much of the world and
other wavs to live."
