The (explorer

explained that he was home

but primarily because his parents
believed he and his siblings could
get a better education at home.
Although his parents always left the
decision open to him to attend the
public school. Klopfer decided he
liked it better at home.
Klopfer was mainly taught by his
mother, although his father often
contributed to math lessons.
"I remember him describing
such things as why a number raised

recalled.

Alter what would have been his
sophomore year of high school,
Klopfer taught himself most of the
material he needed to learn, but his
education was extended through
conversations with his family mem
bers.
"I learned very early on, and in
a visceral sort of way, that learning
need not take place in the class

up early to go tide-pooling in the
five-year low tide or casually debat
ing around the dinner table,'school'
was often taking place without my

less important than active educa

The 13-year-old College Student
Chris Chelberg MO was home
schooled from halfway through his
first grade year until his arrival at
Stanford. Starling at age 13, he took
standard curriculum courses, such as
lab sciences and foreign languages.

at Ohio University, focusing more
on humanities at home with his par
ents.
For Chelberg, high school was a
continuation of his earlier years of
home schooling. When given a
choice to attend the local public
school, the right decision was obvi
ous — taking university-level classes
and studying at home was clearly
the best option for him.
"I think that it was a very good
experience for me," he said. "I was
able to keep focused on what inter
ested me, while being challenged
and acclimated to a rigid time sched
ule by the university classes."
Chelberg started with the basics
physics, chemistry and calculus —
and then later broadened his hori
zons and took whatever seemed
interesting to him. He took SCIJBA
diving, freshman English via Lord of
the Rings and a class called 'Human
Aspirations.' to name a few. At
home, his parents taught him history

and English.
The Social Scene
It's easy to assume that being
home-schooled is somewhat corre
lated with a stagnant social life, but
for Jeffery. making friends wasn't a
problem.
"I knew a lot of kids from when I
attended the public elementary
school before 1 was home-schooled
in fourth grade," he said.
At the local high school. Jeffery
not only took classes but also partic
ipated in the science fair, as well as
the basketball and wrestling teams.
Unfortunately, he was not allowed
to participate in competitions.
"Because I wasn't taking enough
courses at the high school, I wasn't
allowed to compete in very many
matches," Jeffery said. "Of course it
makes sense, but it was pretty tough
because I went to every practice and
worked as hard as everyone else."
Klopfer admitted that he came to

Stanford slightly behind his peers
socially, but feels he had meaningful
friendships during high school.
"My circle of friends was certain
ly smaller than [those of] many my
age," he said, "but my friends were
of a high caliber, to be sure."
Chelberg noted that socially, he
might not have been stretched
quite as much as those who went to
traditional schools, but he was still
involved in many activities outside
of school where he could branch
out and make friends. Boy Scouts,
church youth group and mock trial
were positive social outlets for him.
and of those he has found memo
ries.
"Being able to be on the first
home-schooled mock trial team in
the state and making it to the state
level competition two years in a row
was a great experience — some
thing that I would not have gotten if
I had gone to the local public high
school," Chelberg said.

Transitioning to College
'Hie transition from high school
to college is tough enough. With a
deeper connection to home to cling
onto, home school students, it seems,
would have a harder time adjusting
when they arrive on campus. Jeffery,
however, did not face any challenges
that had to do with the fact he was
home-schooled.
"I never re;illy felt ahead or
behind of everyone else," Jeffery
said. "Everyone comes here and
sees how smart their peers are and
asks those 'why me'?' questions. I
obviously did the same thing, but
other than that I was never really
concerned about my abilities."
Klopfer had a slightly diflerent
experience. Having never received a
grade in a class, his greatest chal
lenge was t;tking tests and dealing
with great nervousness before
exams. He also acknowledged that
his social experiences from high
school were limited, but after find
ing the co-op community at
Stanford, he felt very comfortable.
For Chelberg. a number of ini
tial challenges arose, but in general
he saw his home schooling back
ground as helpful. Learning from his
mother, in fact, seemed to humanize
his professors once he came to
Stanford.
"I've known for a long time that
there are real people behind the
professors," Chelberg noted. "I
think that just being able to relate to
professors as people first and teach

ers second has been a great help."
Chelberg's greatest challenge
since coming to Stanford is dealing
with what he term 'make-work,' or
homework designed to make sure
students arc keeping up with the
material.
"While I was home-schooled,
such a thing was nonexistent, out
side of math," he said. "Even if by
now I understand why it exists, it is
still hard from time to time to think
of it as 'counting.' Not giving myself
enough time to complete these
homework sets has been a problem
during my time at Stanford."
All things considered. Jeffery,
Klopfer and Chelberg have pro
found and unique memories of their
home-schooling years.
"It seems that many look back
on their high school days as painful.

[and] others long to relive them,"
Klopfer said. "I look hack on them
as wonderful and essential to who I
am today."

because the local public school was

"When your local school is pretty

The (explorer
Brannon Klopfer '(W was home
schooled since kindergarten He
explained that he was home
schooled for a number of reasons,
but primarily because his parents
believed he and his siblings could
get a better education at home.
Although his parents always left the
decision open to him to attend the
public school. Klopfer decided he
liked it better at home.
Klopfer was mainly taught by his
mother, although his father often
contributed to math lessons.
"I remember him describing
such things as why a number raised
to the zero power is one," Klopfer
recalled.

Alter what would have been his
sophomore year of high school,
Klopfer taught himself most of the
material he needed to learn, but his
education was extended through
conversations with his family mem
bers.
"I learned very early on, and in
a visceral sort of way, that learning
need not take place in the class
room," Klopfer said. "Me it getting
up early to go tide-pooling in the
five-year low tide or casually debat
ing around the dinner table,'school'
was often taking place without my
knowing it. Passive education is no
less important than active educa
tion, in my opinion."
The 13-year-old College Student
Chris Chelberg MO was home
schooled from halfway through his
first grade year until his arrival at
Stanford. Starling at age 13, he took
standard curriculum courses, such as
lab sciences and foreign languages.

at Ohio University, focusing more
on humanities at home with his par
ents.
For Chelberg, high school was a
continuation of his earlier years of
home schooling. When given a
choice to attend the local public
school, the right decision was obvi
ous — taking university-level classes
and studying at home was clearly
the best option for him.
"I think that it was a very good
experience for me," he said. "I was
able to keep focused on what inter
ested me, while being challenged
and acclimated to a rigid time sched
ule by the university classes."
Chelberg started with the basics
physics, chemistry and calculus —
and then later broadened his hori
zons and took whatever seemed
interesting to him. He took SCIJBA
diving, freshman English via Lord of
the Rings and a class called 'Human
Aspirations.' to name a few. At
home, his parents taught him history

and English.
The Social Scene
It's easy to assume that being
home-schooled is somewhat corre
lated with a stagnant social life, but
for Jeffery. making friends wasn't a
problem.
"I knew a lot of kids from when I
attended the public elementary
school before 1 was home-schooled
in fourth grade," he said.
At the local high school. Jeffery
not only took classes but also partic
ipated in the science fair, as well as
the basketball and wrestling teams.
Unfortunately, he was not allowed
to participate in competitions.
"Because I wasn't taking enough
courses at the high school, I wasn't
allowed to compete in very many
matches," Jeffery said. "Of course it
makes sense, but it was pretty tough
because I went to every practice and
worked as hard as everyone else."
Klopfer admitted that he came to

Stanford slightly behind his peers
socially, but feels he had meaningful
friendships during high school.
"My circle of friends was certain
ly smaller than [those of] many my
age," he said, "but my friends were
of a high caliber, to be sure."
Chelberg noted that socially, he
might not have been stretched
quite as much as those who went to
traditional schools, but he was still
involved in many activities outside
of school where he could branch
out and make friends. Boy Scouts,
church youth group and mock trial
were positive social outlets for him.
and of those he has found memo
ries.
"Being able to be on the first
home-schooled mock trial team in
the state and making it to the state

was a great experience — some
