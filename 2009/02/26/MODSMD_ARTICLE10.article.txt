## Nicole Demby Sex and student government 
### 
Like almost all endeavorsof young peo
ple. my impetus in writing this column
is 20-25 percent to get laid. While I sus
pect that the majority of Stanford Daily read
ers are actually middle-aged women. I have
this fantasy that if I can write a sexy.provoca
tive column that showcases my deliciously
snide wit each week. I will have hordes of el
igible young literary bachelors knocking on
my co-op door.
So when some abstemious, non-jay-walk
ing person, undoubtedly sobered by their
many years, commented on my column last
week, reminding me that we don't need to
overthrow the system to effect change, my
initial reactions were both a genuine feeling
that they were wrong and a revealing defen
siveness. Was this upstanding citizen right?
Was I just romanticizing revolution? Maybe
I only advocate skepticism toward authority
because telling people to work "within the
system" is about as sexy as chamomile tea.
I ,et me be fair to myself. What 1 was advo
cating wasn't violent revolution or even any
revolution, per sc. but rather turning a critical
eye toward the social structures around us. I
don't think it's implausible to say that Stan
ford, like any institution, has a vested interest
in making its citizens think it is doing a good
job. and that it has interests other than its
own in mind when it makes its decisions. All
I was saying was that we should make an ef
fort to learn for ourselves what's what, be
cause otherwise we have no epistemological
option other than to blindly accept what
we're told.
Yet two weeks ago. in this very newspa
per. I read something alarming that suggest
ed that maybe rhetoric like my own could
have a dangerous backlash. An article on the
front page said that out of the entire student

body that was invited to participate in a town
meeting about the Draw, fewer than 30 stu
dents had chosen to attend. I'm guessing
every one of you reading this column, includ
ing myself, has said at least one negative thing
about the Draw system since entering Stan
ford. Yet when finally given a chance to air
these legitimate grievances. 1/500 of us actu
ally took up the opportunity.
The next week. I received an email from
the ASSIJ presidents, telling me about the ef
forts the school was taking to consider com
munity members' opinions when making the
massive budget cuts that need to be made.
The email offered me a link to a survey where
I could tell the ASSIJ which Stanford pro
grams I think are important, and invited me
to another town hall meet ing. this time on the
topic of the cuts (and a bribe of In-n-Out for
the first 50 attendees). I vaguely promised
myself to fill out the survey, and even more
vaguely noted that attending the meeting
was probably something I should do but
wouldn't.
In his book "On Violence." Slovenian
philosopher and cultural critic Slavoj Zizek
says we live in a post-political world in which
citizens only have the illusion of political
agency. Instead of real political considera
tions, every decision the government makes
in this post-political system is chalked up to
universal' ideals like justice' and democra
cy.' For example, in a two-party democracy,
Zizek says we merely have the illusion of sig
nificant choice between two essentially iden
tical options. Or take, as another example, the
mass protests in I .ondon against the Iraq war
a few years ago to which George Hush re
sponded gleefully that protestors were exer
cising precisely the rights that the U.S. mili
tary was fighting for in Iraq. In such a system,

even resistance is complicity. In order to
evade this. Zizek advocates that individuals
withdraw from the system by non-participa
tion such as abstaining from voting.
So was that it? Did we miss the Draw
meeting and not fill out the budget cut survey
because of our theory of abstention as the
only true form of protest? Did we think that
holding these meetings was the University's
way of simulating democracy while really
foreclosing it. of letting us feel like we have
some say in order to appease us while really
ignoring our input?
Evidence suggests that perhaps this is not
far from the truth. For example after the
Stanford Labor Action Coalition fasted for
eight days to support living wage for Stan
ford employees in 20(17. the University final
ly agreed to meet some of SLAC's demands.
Despite their rhetoric, however, the Univer
sity has delayed making the promised
changes. I "hey have come up with standards
for a 'living wage' that is essentially deter
mined by other employers in the Bay Area,
effectively changing very little.
Yet despite this disheartening sign, per
haps we shouldn't give up on the University
before we fully explore the modes in which it
invites us to participate in it. It's not quite as
sexy as defying authority, but maybe a new
revolution will be when 14.(HK)studentsshow
up to a town hall meeting to voice their opin
ions. It might be an exercise in futility, but at
least we'll better know how to affect change
if we know how we can't affect it. Esther way.
they're going to need a lot more In-n-Out
burgers.
