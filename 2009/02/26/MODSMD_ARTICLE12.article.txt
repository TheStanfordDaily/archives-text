# Steal This Column
## The 						return of an old friend 
### 
Suites Special Dinner at Middle Earth
Eating Club last Friday'.' Phenomenal.
Having Ram's Head Theatrical Society
geniuses turning our suite common room
into an African Safari for a party Saturday
night (and at no cost!)? Amazing. Welcoming
the great Andrei Markovits (brilliant visiting
professor of Political Studies and German
Studies) into my family's home for brunch on
Sunday morning? Wonderful.despite the less
than four hours of sleep that preceded it.
But with all respect and thanks to every
one involved in the aforementioned activi
ties, what really set this weekend apart was
what — or rather, who — 1 saw Sunday
evening. Whether you are the most ardent
classical music aficionado, or the ignoramus
who knows Mozart only as that character
whose picture adorns those tasty chocolate
marzipan candies, the experience of Itzhak
Perlman in concert (and it is indeed an expe
rience) is one that lasts you a lifetime.
And inside Davies Symphony Hall, ele
gantly positioned across the street from the
beautiful San Francisco City 1 lall to the east
and the War Memorial Opera House to the
north, I was fortunate enough to see the
greatest violinist of his generation (and per
haps of any) perform his craft.
Though 1 was raised as a violinist, playing
for thirteen years (seven of which I spent
building up the cajones to tell my parents
that I would rather switch to guitar, which 1
subsequently did), classical music has never
quite spoken to me the same way that that of
Neil Young, Leonard Cohen or John Frus
ciante has. When I quit violin, 1 never had a
second thought. It will likely always be my
best instrument, but guitar will forever be my
favorite. Only on rare occasions can classical
music truly move me.
Hut an It/hak Perlman concert represents
more than simply a performance of classical
music; it is a tour de force. Perlman's viva
cious, joyous performance of pieces by Han
del. Beethoven and Messaien was the utter
mastery of a craft personified. The verve and
flair with which he brought each piece of
music new life had a contagious quality about

For each of us in the
audience, that piece spoke
to something both
individual in our
experience and common
in our humanity.

it.and the audience soaked it in. Even those
like me, not directly affected by the music it
self, could not help hut take to heart the way
that classical music can connect with the hu
manity in that room.
But of all the great moments that stood
out. the one that I will take most to heart was
a single piece Perlman performed in his en
core. After having just completed a lively,
perpetual-motion-esque piece lasting no
more than a couple minutes, he and his ac
companying pianist suddenly swept into per
haps one of the few classical musical works

that truly speaks to me: the theme from
"Schindler's List." Perlman was the violinist
for the movie's original score.
1 studied and worked in Berlin for six
months through Stanford's Overseas Pro
gram. As a Jew with two grandparents who
lived in Berlin (who were fortunate enough
to escape in 1938), living as an echo of their
memory took on a special meaning for me
during that half-year journey. Berlin gave to
me a series of experiential gifts, a period of
reflection and a score of emotions and real
izations that I have held onto dearly even
since returning. Some of these emotions 1
have kept to myself, believing them to carry
an ineffable quality best left to silence.
But Perlman tapped into something in me
on Sunday night as he performed this one
piece. As he played 1 sat captivated.and with
out warning, images began to Hood through
my buzzing brain. Perlman's performance
had me suddenly exposed. 1 le transmitted all
the feelings I had experienced in Berlin
through his hands and fingers.seemingly em
anating my experiences through his body,
and my most meaningful emotions, though
not translatable into words, were suddenly
crying out from his violin.
By the end of the piece I was in tears. I was
not the only one. For each of us in the audi
ence. that piece spoke to something both in
dividual in our experience and common in
our humanity.
I returned to my room that night, thankful
for the opportunity to have gone, struck by
the brilliance of Perlman's performance. I
was still emotionally moved as 1 went to bed.
The following evening, still reflective on
my experience. I was still lost in thought. Sud
denly I found myself swiftly moving my bed
sheets out of the way. maneuvering my desk
a bit until my old friend revealed itself.
And then, for the first time in years. I took
out my sheet music and began to play.
