## TROPIC THUNDER Card rides wave of momentum into Hawaii 
### JACOB JAFFE CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
After finally securing an elusive road win over a
ranked conference opponent, the Stanford men's vol
leyball team faces a 2000-mile excursion to face anoth
er ranked foe this weekend.
Following five consecutive losses against ranked
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) teams, the
No. 7 Cardinal (9-7.5-6 MPSF) broke through against
U- Santa Barbara last Weekend, winning a five-set
thriller 30-26,26-30,24-30,30-21.15-13.
"It gave us confidence that we can battle through in
consistencies and raise our level of play to win a long
match." said head coach John Kosty.
"It was a big win,especially since we've had trouble
winning on the road." added senior middle blocker
Brandon Williams. "It was nice to stop our losing streak
and start a winning streak. It built up the energy level
for us. which we'll need with this quick turnaround."
The turnaround is quick indeed,as the Cardinal has
to travel across the Pacific to face No. 11 I lawaii for two
straight matches this weekend. Being so far removed
from the rest of the MPSI geographically. 1 lawaii plays

all its matches in sets of two, so the Cardinal will play
Hawaii today, get Friday off. and then play the team
again on Saturday. This format changes the way the
matches are played.
"It's beneficial to play a team twice in a row." Kosty
said. "You get to play them, look at the video and then
play them again, and it only happens a few times a year.
Both teams get an advantage because they can make
adjustments between matches, so the second match is
usually much better than the first."
Apart from the scheduling, playing in I lawaii brings
other new elements to the matches. For one thing,going
to 1 lawaii is a bit of a homecoming for the Cardinal, as
it boasts six players that hail from the Aloha State, more
than Hawaii even has on its own roster. 1 lawaii is also
known for being one of the hotspots for volleyball, and
the crowd lives up to its billing.
" Hie atmosphere is great — S,(XX) people in the sta
dium." said senior libero Jarod Keller, one of the
I lawaiian natives for Stanford. "All the fans are there to
watch good volleyball, so they'll cheer for whoever
makes good plays."
Stanford hopes this crowd will help the team play to
its full potential.

GAME NOTES ; Stanford's victory over UCSB was its first win over a
ranked MPSF team in its last six attempts. Hawaii i* ranked No. 11
in the nation despite being five games under .500. The Cardinal
plays a second match against Hawaii on Saturday.

"The crowd is just wonderful "Williams said."When
there's a strong crowd, it helps us be more energetic."
However, the Cardinal also knows that playing in
I lawaii can turn into more of a vacation than a road
trip. With its warm weather, the I lawaiian setting can be
an enormous distraction, but the Cardinal does not
want to get sucked into the trap.
"It's one of the biggest advantages Hawaii has,"
Kosty said."But for us. it's just another road trip. It just
might be a little warmer."


GIULIO GRATTA/The Stanford Daily
The No. 7 men's volleyball team heads to Honolulu this weekend for a clash with No. 1 1 Hawaii. Stanford is fresh off a five-set thriller againt UCSB in which the Cardi
nal beat its first ranked conference opponent in six tries.
Following their coach's example,
the players are focused on what they
need to do to succeed this weekend
on the court.
"We need to improve our consis
tency" Williams said. "We've been
doing the basics consistently, but
we've got to start cutting down on
small errors. If we do that, we'll be
very successful."
Stanford feels like it is gaining
consistency, and this can help the
team succeed.
"We need to put a full match to
gether," Kosty said. "We're at a point
in the season where we have the abil
ity to do that."
The Cardinal will need a complete
match to beat a Hawaii team that
Kosty said has "played extremely
well on the island" this year. Despite
its 3-8 record, Hawaii is ranked No. 11
in the country because all 11 of its op
ponents were ranked among the top
10 nationally at the time of the match.
Stanford plays at Hawaii today
and Saturday at 10 p.m. PST before
returning home on Tuesday to face
UC-Santa Cruz.
