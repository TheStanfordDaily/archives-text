With only three days left before the
Pacific-10 Conference Tournament and
the finale of the wrestling season, the
Stanford wrestling team looks to fulfill
many of the teams' season goals and
push its wrestlers up to the next level.
Hosted by Cal State-Fullerton. this
year's Pac-1 OTournament involves nine
teams, with eight-man brackets and the
ninth wrestler subbing in. This after
noon. the Pac-1() coaches will find out
the rankings of their wrestlers, which
will determine the brackets. On Satur
day, the teams will learn how many
players from each bracket will qualify

for the 2009 NCAA Championships,
which will tell the athletes how high
they need to place in the Pac-lOs to
qualify.
"We obviously have team goals but
we are mostly focusing on individuals."
coach Jason Borrelli said. "This time of
year, the focus is on the individual. 11 the
individual goals are met. then the team
stuff will fall into place."
Redshirt freshman Nick
Amuchastegui (26-5), who now stands
with the fourth most wins of any fresh
man in Stanford history, looks to fulfill
his season goal of qualifying for nation
als on Sunday, lie has defeated every
Pac-10 wrestler in the 165-pound
weight class at least once, proving his

great potential to climb to the top this
weekend. I le will most likely be ranked
second in the tournament.
"I'm pretty revved up about it."
Amuchastegui said. "I feel good about
everybody, certainly, but a couple guys
have beaten me too so they're going to
keep me on my toes. It's time for things
to pay off now, this is what we've
worked for all season."
Boise State, who now stands unde
feated in the Pac-10 Conference, will
put forth the greatest competition for
Stanford and for Amuchastegui in par
ticular. Boise wrestler Tyler Sherfy
handed Amuchastegui his only loss of
2009 when he scored a takedown with
only 20 seconds left to steal

GAME NOTES: Stanford redshirt freshman Nick
Amuchastegui has defected every Pac-10
wrestler in the 165-pound weight class at least
once this season. Boise State is the meet favorite
as it comes to the tournament with an undefeat
ed Pac-10 record. The Cardinal is returning 10
Pac-10 competitors from last year.

Amuchastegui's lead. Besides Sherfy.
Boise presents two other defending
Pac-10 champions.
In this final week of practice, the
team looks to keep its fitness level high
and touch up on little things that have
plagued them all season. Since the sea
son's commencement, the team has
struggled with how to hold on to a lead
throughout the match. Lately, many
wrestlers have improved in this area,
winning difficult matches in the final
moments.
"This is the chance to make up for
some mistakes earlier in the season."
said Stanford senior Luke Feist. "I'm
wrestling against three guys I've lost to.
It's been things I can fix. so if I can fix
them this weekend that's all that mat
ters. Iliis is one last try to get one last
try."
For seniors like Feist, this Pac-10
tournament signifies the final stop in
five years of collegiate wrestling. Feist
has led the team in his past three Pac-10
performances and boosted his rankings
each time. Having placed fifth in 2006,
fourth in 2007. and third in 2008. he
hopes to continue to improve. He head
lines the team's 10 returning Pac-10
competitors, six of which will most like
ly compete again this year.
However, several wrestlers on Stan
ford's young team will also make their
Pac-10 debut this season. Coach Borrel-
