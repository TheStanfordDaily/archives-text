### JENNY PETER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 3 Stanford men's gymnastics team finished second
to the Japanese Collegiate All-Star team on Feb. 21, but was
victorious over all of the NCAA teams present at the Pacific
Coast Collegiate Classic in Oakland. Calif. The Cardinal men
posted their highest team score of the season at a 356.9. the
best of any team in the NCAA this season.
Berkeley (355.35), University of Michigan (354.2), Univer
sity of Illinois (350.55), University of Minnesota (344.5) and
U.S. Air Force Academy (324.5) were all participants who
placed behind Stanford at the meet.
The Cardinal began the competition by improving its high
est pommel horse team total by four points with a 58.65. Senior
Bryant I ladden posted Stanford's best score of the season with
a 14.85. Big executed routines from redshirt junior GregTer-
Zakhariants (14.6) and sophomore Kyle Oi (14.7) also boost
ed the team score.
"Kyle Oi was true to form." said head coach Thorn Glielmi.
"It wasn't a matter of if Kyle was going to hit, but rather how
good he was going to hit."
On the rings, the Cardinal yet again procured its highest
event score of the season with a 60.85. The team now holds the
nation's highest event total thanks to hit routines from sopho
more Tim Gentry (15.15), redshirt senior Sho Nakamori
(14.95) and a season-best performance from redshirt sopho

Despite losing to the Japanease Collegiate All-Stars, the
Stanford men's gymnastics team looked very impressive
against its fellow NCAA competition. At the meet, the Cardi
nal set both a team and NCAA season-best by notching an
outstanding 356.9 points.
nal with a 15.65.
"Hadden was last up and demon
strated why he is the No. 1 ring man
in the country," Glielmi said. "[He]
held strength, level positions, great
swing and a stuck piked double front
dismount merited his 15.65 score."
On vault, Ter-Zakhariants gave
Stanford a solid start, sticking the
landing and netting a 16.0 for second
place. Huge vaults were also seen
from sophomores Alex Busgalia
(15.65) and Josh Dixon (15.6), but
big deductions on landings prevent
ed the team from getting over a 62.8.
On parallel bars, sophomore
Rvan Lieberman (14.55), Ter-Za
khariants (14.6) and Nakamori con
tributed the most to the team score.
Nakamori nailed a season-best rou
tine at a 15.55 and is currently the na
tion's leading gymnast on the paral
lel bars.
High bar was the only event
where Stanford visibly struggled and
was forced to count a fall.
Nakamori's 14.4 was the highest
score the team put up and placed
him among the top 10 finishers of the
meet.
"On high bar, we're just focusing
on perfecting tiny breaks in the rou

tines," said freshman Jordan Nolff.
"However, it is usually one of our
top scoring events, so our perform
ance on Saturday was very unchar
acteristic and just a matter of re
maining focused throughout the en
tire competition."
Stanford is ranked second nation
ally behind Cal in the event.
Going into floor, the Cardinal
men knew they had to nail their rou
tines to solidify a victory over Cal.
They did just that, posting their high
est total of the year at a 60.8. Dixon
executed a great routine, earning
himseld a 15.5 and a first-place fin
ish. Ter-Zakhariants placed third,
scoring just a tenth behind Dixon
with a 15.4. Stanford is ranked first in
the country in the event.
Lieberman.who is ranked No. 12,
was the only gymnast to represent
Stanford in the all-around and fin
ished eighth with an 82.5.
The Cardinal will get a second
chance to go up against the Japanese
Collegiate All-Star team this Friday
at 7 p.m. in Burnham Pavilion.
"Our team goal for this Fridays
meet is to hit 6-for-6 on every event,"
said freshmen Jordan Nolff. "We're
especially focusing on cleaning up
parallel bars, because that's the one
event that seems to consistently
cause us some problems."
