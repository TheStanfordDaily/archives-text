# WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
## A 						shorthanded surprise Stanford victorious despite absence of top three athletes against Cal 
### KENAN JIANG STAFF WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford women's gymnastics team, led by a
talented class of freshmen, easily defeated California
197.175-190.625 last Sunday, despite resting their top three
gymnasts in preparation for a highly anticipated show
down with Alabama on Mar. 21 in Tuscaloosa.
The rotation of ten gymnasts scored 21 season-bests in
a highly impressive showcase of young talent. With the win,
the teamed moved to 12-0 on the year.
Senior captain Kelly Fee was impressed with the per
formance of the younger members of the team.
"We faced a very similar situation my sophomore year
when two of our top performers suffered injuries," Fee
said. "We ended up getting our highest score of the sea
son."
Sophomore Shelley Alexander stepped up for the Car
dinal, as she expanded her event line up last weekend.
Alexander, who only competed on vault last year, started
the meet off with a 9.8 on the uneven bars, and scored 9.8
or better on the rest of the events (floor, vault, beam) to
win the all-around competition
with a career-best 39.4. Alexander's
performance was especially im
pressive considering she has only
competed in the all-around three
times.
"As a team, we talked about that
experience and how this meet was
an opportunity for new people to
rise up." Fee said. "Entering the
meet, wc were not quite sure what
to expect. Almost 30 percent of the
performances were new, and many
young faces were making their
debut. On the other hand, after a
solid practice on Friday, we were
confident in each lineup."
Sunday marked Stanford's third
consecutive meet in which it
achieved at least 197 points. This is
a feat it did not accomplish until the
postseason last year. The Cardinal
has clearly made big steps toward

breaking into the national elite,and
this season seems like the perfect
time for a serious run at a national
championship.
"1 feel that our day-to-day
training has been much more chal
lenging this season compared to
past seasons and that it has helped
us," Fee explained."We are doing a
lot of repetitions in the gym in ad
dition to weight training twice a
week. All of this training is clearly
paying off. While other teams pass
the season's halfway mark and
begin to feel the effects of compet
ing every weekend, our team is
only getting stronger. Compared
to past seasons, I think we are
ahead of the curve in terms of
preparation both physically and
mentally."
The Cardinal has two regular
season meets remaining before at
tempting to defend its Pacific-10
Conference title on March 21 (4
p.m.) at Maples Pavilion.
