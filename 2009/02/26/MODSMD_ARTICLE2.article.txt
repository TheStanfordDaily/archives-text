# LUXURY HOTEL TO OPEN IN SPRING

Amid a troubling sea of budget cuts
and layoffs, a University-owned luxury
hotel — the Rosewood Sand Hill — is
scheduled to open the first week of
spring quarter.
While most strain to tighten purse
strings and businesses are cutting down
on budgets. Michael Casey, managing
director of Rosewood Sand Hill, is
working hard to ensure that every
piece of furniture and every light fix
ture is in place in time for the April 2
opening of the Stanford-owned addi
tion to the management chain of
Rosewood Hotels & Resorts.
Despite the hotel market's recent
drop — the industry has been on the
decline over the last six months, accord

- MICHAEL CASEY, Rosewood managing director

ing to Steve Elliott, managing director
of real estate for Stanford — no con
cerns about the effects of the economic
crisis t>n consumer demand have been
expressed by those involved in the
Rosewood Sand Hill. To the contrary,
both Elliott and Casey feel confident
that the hotel will be met with the
expected public response. The location

and lack of competitors on Sand Hill
Road plays a key economic advantage
for the new hotel. Casey said.
"I think, despite the economic out
look. the prospects for the hotel are
extremely favorable given the fact that
we have such a unique product." Casey
said. "The whole project has been so
long-awaited and much-anticipated

that the community here. I believe, is
just welcoming us."
Indeed. Rosewood Sand Hill is part
of an office and hotel complex for
which the final round of planning
began as early as 2004. General plans
for commercial investments on the 1 fi
acre Stanford property, on which
Rosewood Sand Hill now stands, have
been in the works for more than twen
ty years.
"It's always been the plan to come
up with an attractive development
project that would benefit the commu
nity and benefit the University." Elliott
said. "Since 2004. the primary plan was
to do a mixed use development that
included both offices and a hotel,
[although] I think initially there was

probably some analysis looking at
potentially residential or some other
mix of uses."
The closest attempt before now
was in the '80s when Stanford
entered another luxury hotel ven
ture only to abandon it on account
dI pour economic conditions.
"The hotel back in the "80s was
really in planning stages when the
downturn hit," Elliott said. "The dif
ference here is that the hotel was
ready to open when the crisis really
peaked. It's certainly a difficult tim
ing to open up a hotel, but I think in
the long term we're still very opti
mistic."
The landscaping and construc
tion that began in 2006 deliberately
incorporated a distinctly Northern
California feel to blend in with the
surrounding area of the Santa Cruz
Mountains. Rosewood Sand Hill's

lush accommodations, premier
event spaces and opulent amenities
— 123 guest rooms and suites, a ball
room and a spa — features local
architectural tradition that plays
with the transparency between
indoors and outdoors, all of which
have access to terraces and bal
conies. Everything from its designers
to much of the displayed artwork to
its executive chef comes from within
the Bay Area, helping to further
cement that theme. The hotel's sig
nature restaurant. Madera, even has
its own herb garden on hotel
grounds from which many of the
ingredients for the menu will come.
Just over a month away from its
debut. Rosewood Sand Hill has
kicked into full-gear preparation,
adding last minute touches, training
a staff of 250 employees, advertising
more actively and bracing for the
four wedding events and several
corporate and social group pro
grams to plan for the year.
