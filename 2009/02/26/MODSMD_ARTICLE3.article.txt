### JOANNA XU MANAGING EDITOR 
Yesterday. eßay Inc. CEO John Donahoe,
along with a number of other top information
technology executives, spoke at the 15th
Annual Stanford Accel Conference. Hosted
by Media X. the conference covered the
effects of the economic downturn on the retail
industry, e-commerce in general and innova
tion on top of existing online social network
platforms.
One ol the markets most negatively affect
ed by the economic downturn and credit
freeze is retail. eßay.com, one of the leaders of
online retail, has certainly not remained
unscathed.
"A big retailer can survive through six
quarters ol losses." Donahoe said. "But small
business cannot: that's why we provided near
l\ $120 million worth of coupons to buyers to
help our sellers."
I lowever, Donahoe sees a bright future for
the e-commerce business.
"It's still the early days in e-commerce,"
Donahoe said Right now, e-commerce con

number of free Internet calls on Skype in the
fourth quarter." Donahoe said. "There was
also a 65 percent increase in the number of
eomputer-to-phone calls."

low-cost position on communication.
Present!). Sk\pe is a $500 million business that
is growing at 30 to 40 percent a year.
Donahoe also expressed high hopes for the
future ol Paypal. While started initially to
complement eßay.com as a convenient form
ol payment for eßay users, it has now grown
into an entirely separate platform.
"Paypal should eventually be bigger than
eßay.' Donahoe said. "Retail is a big industry
but very fragmented."
However. Donahoe believes that Paypal
