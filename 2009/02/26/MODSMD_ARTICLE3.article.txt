## Technology execs speak on campus eBay Inc. CEO John Donahoe bullish on e-commerce 
### JOANNA XU MANAGING EDITOR 
Yesterday. eßay Inc. CEO John Donahoe,
along with a number of other top information
technology executives, spoke at the 15th
Annual Stanford Accel Conference. Hosted
by Media X. the conference covered the
effects of the economic downturn on the retail
industry, e-commerce in general and innova
tion on top of existing online social network
platforms.
One ol the markets most negatively affect
ed by the economic downturn and credit
freeze is retail. eßay.com, one of the leaders of
online retail, has certainly not remained
unscathed.
"A big retailer can survive through six
quarters ol losses." Donahoe said. "But small
business cannot: that's why we provided near
l\ $120 million worth of coupons to buyers to
help our sellers."
I lowever, Donahoe sees a bright future for
the e-commerce business.
"It's still the early days in e-commerce,"
Donahoe said Right now, e-commerce con
stitutes about seven percent of online retail.
That figure should be 15 to 20 percent, just
because of the security and ease of comfort
that it provides. Ihe only way that percent
age is going to double is through innova
tion."
()f course. eßay Inc.'s revenue comes from
much more than just eßay.com. Donahoe
explained thai eßav.com comprised 50 per
cent of the company's business: Paypal made
up 33 percent, Skvpe eight to nine percent and
Stub! I üb. K11i|i and a number of other smaller
local businesses constitute the rest.
Skype. in particular, did exceptionally well
in the fourth quarter of 2008, when the eco
nomic downturn really hit consumer demand.
"There was a 73 percent increase in the
number of free Internet calls on Skype in the
fourth quarter." Donahoe said. "There was
also a 65 percent increase in the number of
eomputer-to-phone calls."
This is. Donahoe added, due to Skype's
low-cost position on communication.
Present!). Sk\pe is a $500 million business that
is growing at 30 to 40 percent a year.
Donahoe also expressed high hopes for the
future ol Paypal. While started initially to
complement eßay.com as a convenient form
ol payment for eßay users, it has now grown
into an entirely separate platform.
"Paypal should eventually be bigger than
eßay.' Donahoe said. "Retail is a big industry
but very fragmented."
However. Donahoe believes that Paypal
has the potential to become the
leader in online payment networks
— it"it does not become the fourth
big player in global payment net
work — in addition to the existing
Visa. Mastercard and American
Experience payment networks.
However, all these develop
ments depend on product develop
ment and innovation — and
Donahoe emphasized that all busi
nesses under eßay Inc. are focused
on developing around user experi
ence.
"In many ways, eßay was the
first social networking platform."

Donahoe said. "We want to build a
great platform and commerce net
work upon which users can then
expand. We want to keep providing
this marketplace."
During the Q&A session that
followed Donahoe's talk, a number
of interesting questions were raised
regarding eßay's future and
growth. One question, in particular,
asked what effects the Obama
administration's stimulus plan
would have on eßay's market
space.
"Fundamentally, 1 think some of
the stimulus money should go
towards broadband." Donahoe
said. "The broadband coverage in
the U.S. is embarrassing compared
to some Asian countries." With
greater broadband use, an entirely
new and different class of users

could emerge.
Donahue envisioned a scenario
in which a man would research an
item online, walk into a store to see
the product in real life, video chat
with his spouse on his phone about
the product — while conducting an
online price comparison check on
his mobile Internet — then order
the item off his phone while walk
ing out of the store.
"Product exploration will
expand." Donahoe said. "And more

and more innovation will occur
online. Those lines will blur."
Other notable keynote speakers
at the Accel Conference included
Sir Martin Sorrell, chairman and
CEC) of WPP; Jayshree Ullal, presi
dent and CEO of Arista Networks;
and Bob Muglia, president of
Servers and Tools Business at
Microsoft Corp.
