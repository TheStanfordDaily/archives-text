week away, Stanford men's basketball

Angeles schools at 7:30 pm tonight in
Maples Pavilion. The Cardinal is coming
off three consecutive losses — all on the
road — and hopes some time at home

might offer at least a positive finale to an
otherwise disappointing conference sea

After a very promising start to the season, the Stanford men's basketball team has fallen near the bottom of the Pac-10 standings.
The team will look to this weekend to salvage any hopes of basketball in March.
chance revival.
Stanford encounters the tougher
of its weekend competition first —
UCLA (20-7. 9-5) is tied for third in
the Pac-10, shooting better than 50
percent from the field on the season,
and handed Stanford its worst loss of
the year on Jan. 31.97-63, in L.A.The
Bruins are led by senior guard Darren
Collison and senior center Alfred
Abova. two of five UCLA players to
score in double digits (with 15 apiece)
in the first meeting.
Collison. who averages 15 points,
"We've just
got to play"
- MITCH JOHNSON,
senior point guard
1.7 steals and a conference-leading
five assists per game, will pose an
exciting threat to Stanford's back
court along with freshman Jrue
Holiday (9.1 ppg. 1.5 steals) and red
shirt junior Michael Roll (7.6 ppg).
However, the Bruins' advantage
lies mainly in their big men. Aboya
averages 9.9 ppg and six boards, but
finds substantial support in junior for
ward Nikola Dragovic (8.8 ppg) and
senior small forward Josh Shipp (13
ppg). The three Bruins form a versa
tile combination down low. especially
because both Shipp and Dragovic
have the ability to step out and shoot
the long ball. Although not usually
dominant in the paint, the Bruins will
try to capitalize on Stanford's habitu
al struggles near the basket, which
senior forward Lawrence Hill
deemed the Card's greatest weakness.
"Other teams aren't scared of us
they know they're going to beat us
in the lane." Hill said resignedly.
"[They'll beat us on] dribble penetra
tion [and] rebounding. Other teams
see us there, and they don't believe
we can push them out. We're not
physical enough, not aggressive
enough."
UCLA, though, is not unbeatable,
and Stanford knows it. The Bruins
have dropped three of their last four
games, as well as their last three
games on the road. Stanford, more
over. should capably challenge what's
typically the bread and butter of
I ICLA's defense: steals. Although the
Bruins average 8.7 steals per game.

Stanford ranks second in the confer
ence with at 2.76 turnover margin
against its opponents.
Hill, in fact, thinks the brutal loss
to the Bruins last month was unchar
acteristic for the Cardinal, and said
Stanford won't go down the same
way at home.
"We (won't] lay down like we did
last time," Hill said. "We've always
played them tough, except this year at
their place, and we have that to look
on. If you look at teams coming in
here after a tough loss, they're work
ing hard. We are too. But. we need to
go out and do what we know we can
do."
Similarly, senior guard Mitch
Johnson doesn't feel that there's a
huge discrepancy in talent between
the squads, and sees the potential for
a strong showing against UCLA this
time. "When you look one to 10
in the league, the talent level is really
not too much of a difference," he said.
"I still think we're capable of beating
any team ... [and] on a given day.
there's almost no such thing as an
upset anymore."
Coach Johnny Dawkins agreed,
emphasizing that Stanford is far from
throwing in the towel this season.
"You've got to just keep fighting;
you've got to overcome." Dawkins
said. "That's what we're telling our
guys.Take them one at a time, and try
to just go out there and get better, and
see if we can't overcome.'"
Stanford will "keep fighting"
against USC during its Senior Day
game, 5:30 pm on Saturday. 'Die
Trojans, too. have lost four of I heir last
five, but will challenge the Cardinal in
different ways.
For one. junior forward Taj Gibson
(13.8 ppg, 9.3 rebounds, conference
best 2.7 blocks) inherently offers
tougher competition in the paint than
any of the Bruins. Gibson leads USC
with a conference-second 36
rebounds and a conference-best 4.7
blocks per game. Freshmen forwards
DeMar Deßozan (12.6 ppg. 5.5
rebounds) and Leonard Washington
(6.7 ppg,4.5 rebounds) offer dominat
ing depth to the USC frontcourt that
the Card won't encounter on
Thursday.
Meanwhile, junior guard Dwight
Lewis leads the team with 15.4 points
per game, while fellow junior Daniel
Hackett offers another i 1.6 and dish
es 4.7 assists per game. But, Johnson
reiterated that Stanford can hang
with any opponent, and that the
Cardinal's biggest threat is its own
mindset.
"Once you get on the wrong end
of those things a couple times, you can
start second-guessing yourself." he
said. "And that lack of confidence ...
you can't let that doubt creep in.
We've got to just play."
