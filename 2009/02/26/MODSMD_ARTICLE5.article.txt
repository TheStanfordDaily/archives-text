## ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT SLASHES JOBS 
### JACOB JOHNSON DESK EDITOR 
Yesterday, the Stanford University
Department of Athletics
announced plans to cut 21 positions
from its administrative staff.
According to a department press release, the
job cuts are part of an effort to compensate
for a projected $5.4 million decrease in rev
enue over the next three years. The shortfall
in funding is expected to continue for the
foreseeable future, as are the cuts in the ath
letic department's workforce.
The specific jobs to be cut have not been
announced out of respect for the privacy of
the individuals concerned. They will all
come from "administrative and service
areas." The laid-off individuals will receive
three months salary and two months of full
benefits — in addition to the standard sever
ance package.
"As there remains great uncertainty as to
how deep and how long the economic down
turn will be. we believe that the difficult
decisions we have made to date will place
Stanford Athletics in a prudent position to
deal with the present challenges," said
Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby in
Wednesday's press release. "As is the cir
cumstance throughout the Stanford campus,
we will continue to assess our budget projec
tions and will make further adjustments as
needed, which may include programmatic,
staff and sports reductions."
The release stated that the University is
facing endowment losses of 20-30 percent
this year. Every department has been asked
"to plan for budget reductions of at
least 15 percent" over the next two
years.
The layoffs are part of the athlet
ic department's strategy to stay
within its limited budget through
2012. The 21 layoffs represent a 13
percent reduction in administrative
staff, and could save the department
close to $1.5 million. Further cuts
have also been authorized, including
"freezing open positions, mandatory
use of vacation accruals, reduced
facility maintenance and reduced
travel expenses. In addition to
reducing costs. Stanford Athletics is
examining all potential sources for
additional revenue, including ticket
sales, multimedia rights and facility
use fees."
The reductions could total $2.5
million. I lowever. that still leaves an
almost $3 million gap in the athletic
department's budget — if the pro
jected losses are accurate. Last year.
Stanford Athletics brought in about
$1.6 million in extra revenue.
"We've never had budget surplus

es." Bowlsby said in an interview
with Hie Daily after yesterday's
announcement. "In the previous
five years [prior to last year], the
department had run a deficit."
When asked about the lack of a
built-in surplus or "cushion" in the
budget. Bowlsby dismissed the idea.
"You've got to be able to pay for
what you need before you think
about a 'cushion.'" he said.
The athletic department's
endowment was valued at about
$410 million in December — down
more than $100 million since May of
last year. Despite the massive losses.
Stanford's endowment is the richest
of any athletic department in the
nation.
Bowslby said the new cuts were
carefully planned so as to not
adversely affect Stanford teams or
athletes. He was adamant that staff
whom directly interact with athletes
would not see cuts — specifically
mentioning "sports medicine, athlet
ic training and strength and condi
tioning" as areas that would retain
their current staff. Coaches are also
expected to be exempt from the
reductions.
An all-staff pay cut was discussed
as an alternative to layoffs, but it
was determined that a large

decrease in pay —as much as 10
percent — would be required to
achieve comparable savings.
A smaller staff will mean more
work for administrators, but
Bowlsby doesn't think that the qual
ity of Stanford's athletic program
will suffer.
"We did most of it through reor
ganization ... and redistribution of
duties." Bowlsby said.
"I don't think right now it will
have an effect on teams and ath
letes." he added. Currently, there
are no plans to cut any of Stanford's
varsity programs. With an uncertain
economic forecast for the next few
years — and possibly longer — that
could change.
"I can't say definitively that we
won't have sport cuts if the econo
my continues to decline." Bowlsby
said yesterday. In 2011 or 2012,
"who knows what the economy will
be like."
Nevertheless. Bowlsby has prom
ised to do everything possible to
avoid cutting any of Stanford's var
sity sports.
"I've always said is that it will be
a course of last resort." he noted.
