### JACOB JOHNSON DESK EDITOR 
I.ast week's announcement that the ath
letic department will sell seats to season-tick
et holders and Buck/Cardinal members in
what was part of the Sixth Man section in
Maples Pavilion provoked an outcry from
many Stanford students. Much of the finger
pointing and blame has been levied against
the athletic department and Athletic
Director Bob Bowlsby. Yesterday. Bowlsby
responded.
()ne of the hottest issues is the claim made

by Sixth Man Managing Director Alexis Link
'10 that the Sixth Man was not informed of
the decision to sell seats in Section 13.
Bowlsby reiterated the department's claim
that the Sixth Man leadership was informed
ol the impeding move for months.
"YVc started looking for ways as early as
December to increase student attendance."
he told the Daily.
Bowlsby also addressed a major concern
among students that the Sixth Man section is
too expensive. Membership fees for the
2<K)X-2(MN season were
"What we'd eventually like to do is have

our student section in football and men's
basketball endowed." he said. "We need to
see if we can get it to the point where it can
be free like football is."
Short-term changes have been imple
mented during the 2(H) 1 ) men's basketball
season in an attempt to increase student
attendance. They have produced limited
results. "We reduced the price of single
game tickets in an effort to get students to

and 14 to student-athletes," a move
that was effective hut still failed to
fill the Sixth Man area.
Nonetheless. the third-year
Stanford athletic director feels that
his department "dropped the hall"
in promoting the men's basketball
team and its once-formidable stu
dent section.
"We did everything we could do
... to make games affordable [dur
ing the season]." Bowlsby said.
However, he noted that the ath
letic department — specifically the
men's basketball program — is
also responsible for the lack of stu
dent interest.
"I do think it's fair to say with a
new basketball staff coming in,
they weren't sure what their
responsibilities were," he said.
Even with a tightening budget,
Bowlsby made it clear that student
input is one of the athletic depart
ment's top concerns.
"The students are always a high
priority for us." he said.
