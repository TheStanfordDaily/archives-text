## Editorial The
						antidote to low basketball attendance: make Sixth Man free 
### 
The recent announcement that Stan
ford Athletics will sell seats in section
13 of Maples Pavilion for both
tonight's men's basketball game against
UCLA and Saturday's game against IJSC
came as a shock to many of the team's
diehard fans, as well as members of the
team's official student fan organization, the
Sixth Man Club.
Section 13. which sits courtside opposite
the team benches, has long been reserved as
part of the Sixth Man's student fan section,
and the choice to sell tickets to season-ticket
holders and Buck/Cardinal club members
drew the ire of the Sixth Man Club's leaders
who were left in the dark on the decision
— and dismay from the team's fans.
The administration justified the choice to
sell the tickets by pointing to declining Sixth
Man Club membership and dwindling atten
dance at games this year. At recent games,
the Sixth Man Club has failed to show up in
sufficient numbers to fill the courtside
cheering section: in fact, only 64<X students
purchased the $65 membership for this sea
son. off from the recent peak of nearly 2,000
students during the 2005-2006 campaign.
Even at the best-attended game of the sea
son. Stanford's upset win over Cal in Janu
ary, only 50 percent of club members showed
up to root for the Card.
Given these underwhelming attendance
figures, it is understandable that the athletic
department — already facing a $5.4 million
revenue decrease over the next three years
would try to raise some money by selling
out seats that would otherwise stand con
spicuously empty right across from the Stan
ford team's bench.
While the editorial board not believe the
athletic department's decision was out of
line, we still think it speaks volumes about
the state of the Sixth Man Club and high
lights the need for Stanford Athletics to step
in and help reverse the fortunes of this vital
institution.
The announcement provoked an angered
reaction from the club's managing director.
Alexis Link, who decried the move as setting
"a bad precedent for the future" in a Feb. 19
Daily brief ("Athletic department to sell
Sixth Man seats"). Link was further quoted
in Monday's Daily as saying that the section
had been filled at the Cal game, meeting the
athletic department's conditions for not sell
ing the seats (see "Sixth Man Meltdown").
While the editorial board emphatically
agrees with Link that the Sixth Man Club
has been an important contributor to the

team's success and that the players "thrive
on the enthusiasm" of its members, the
board feels that a partially empty student
section does not serve the team well either.
According to administration officials, the
entire Sixth Man membership can fit. along
with the Band, in Sections 9 through 12.
without need for Section 13. And while the
department's actions do constitute a bad
precedent, they set no worse a precedent
than its decision to not intervene as the Sixth
Man Club atrophies in the wake of the
Lopez twins' departure.
'Hie best short-term solution for reviving
the club is to discard the fee. currently $65,
for obtaining Sixth Man membership. With
every other athletic event at Stanford free to
attend, the Sixth Man fee is unique and evi
dently depressing turnout. (Not even Stan
ford football has a fee anymore, and it has
seen increased attendance since the change.)
In the long term, removing the cost seems
like not only a great way to reignite interest
in men's basketball but also a savvy business
decision on the part of Stanford Athletics.
Based on the $65 fee and the 2008-2009
membership, the department only raised
about $42,000 from the Sixth Man fee. a
small part of a men's basketball revenue
stream that was nearly $6 million in 2006. ac
cording to the San Francisco Business Times.
About half of this funding goes directly to
the Sixth Man committee to finance promo
tions and T-shirts.
The Sixth Man committee does an ad
mirable job of trying to stir up student inter
est, hut can ultimately be stymied by the high
price of membership, which is set by Stan
ford Athletics. Earlier this year. Sixth Man
members rallied through Branner. trying to
raise awareness and sign up freshmen for the
club. Unfortunately, many students balked
at the high cost of tickets, especially those
that might be interested in attending only
one or two big games a year.
Selling tickets in Section 13 to make a lit
tle extra money is fine for the rest of this sea
son. but is a very unsatisfactory long-term
solution. Next year, we want to see an intact
student section that runs the length of the
court and fills up regularly. Ultimately, the
editorial board hopes to see a revived Sixth
Man Club, reminiscent of those of yester
year that regularly packed the house and
stormed the court after Stanford's come
back victory over then-second-ranked
UCLA in 2007. Free membership.granted to
all students,can enable Sixth Man to enjoy a
thrilling comeback of its own.
