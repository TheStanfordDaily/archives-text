# Love's Labour not lost on Shakespeare performance
## 
### 
Caught last week's Shakes performance
but still hungry for more from the
Bard? Lucky you: This weekend the
Drama Department offers "Sketches from
'Love's Labour's Lost,"' playing at 8 p.m. in
Pigott Theater on Friday and Saturday.
This Shakespearian comedy revolves
around the young king of Navarra and his
three friends who take an oath to renounce
women and frivolity for three years in order to
focus on their studies. (I'm sure all of you
made a similar pact upon entering Stanford).
The lads arc destined to renege though; the
moment they sign the agreement, they are
told that the Princess of France and three
lovely ladies-in-waiting are stopping in to the
court. Cupid's arrows strike both the men and
women quickly, and the whole scene devolves
into a battle of the sexes as both groups of
friends vie for the hearts of their counterparts,
all while playing a series of practical jokes and
falling prey to a variety of mishaps. The sub-

plots typical to Shakespeare's comedies
abound as well, here including a lovesick,
blabber-mouthed, Spanish king and the clas
sic "play-within-a-play," though I found the
comic relief to be less amusing than the other
familiar shows like "A Midsummer Night's
Dream."
As per usual for Shakespearian shows,
potential audience members should bear in
mind that two hours of Elizabethan English
can be a lot to handle, and "Love's Labour's
Lost" is teeming with beautiful, complicated
language. That being said, the performers
more often than not do a commendable job of
delivering their lines in an intelligible, mean
ingful way, which, as anyone who has seen a
bad Shakespeare show or has had to read
"Hamlet" out loud in high school English can

attest, is no easy feat.
The play is shown on a blank stage,
flanked on either side by a row of wooden
chairs and backed by a plain black curtain.
Actors themselves sometimes fill in as set
pieces, strategically standing in the shadows
around the tableau to signify when their char
acters may be relevant, though not involved in
a scene. Simple costumes and lighting keep
the focus on the linguistic interplay between
characters as well as their physical interac
tions. During the first few scenes of the show,
I found myself frustrated by the lack of con
text; often in plays of this style, visual cues
help audiences to understand content.
However, as 1 warmed back up to the lan
guage, I found that the lack of distractions like
fancy period costume or elaborate sets
focused my attention on the words, making a
fairly straight rendition of Shakespeare seem
far more modern.
Call me old-fashioned, but in a season of

stunningly creative though utterly confusing
performances from the Drama Department, I
found a more traditional show refreshing.
Theater by definition is an ephemeral medi
um — no specific performance is ever repeat
ed twice; thus if a performance is intended for
entertainment or enlightenment, an audience
must achieve a certain level of comprehension
upon first viewing. By cutting away extrane
ous elements, "Sketches from Love's Labour's
Lost" allows its audience to move beyond
sheer spectacle and approach a far more
important goal: understanding.
