# MUSiC FEATURE
## THE 						JAKES The 						Jakes set to rocket into fame... hopefully. 
### 
Elcctric guitar riffs blast through the
dingy "sound-proofed" walls of what
looks like a nondescript warehouse in
Santa Ana, CA. Mid-chorus during a catchy,
Strokes-inspired ballad, a guitar shrieks and
brings the music to an abrupt halt.
"No, no, no," Eric Cannata yells over the
drums, dropping his guitar and letting it dan
gle from his shoulder. The 20-something
scruffy guitarist of The Jakes shakes his head.
"This pre-chorus definitely needs work."
Cannata nimbly fingers out a staccato chord
progression on his shiny electric a few times,
then strums out a fluid melody. "If we get the
dynamics down on this one, it'll be legit.
Sameer, give me vocals to this, okay?"
Situated near a dilapidated exterminator
business and the seedy-looking O'Malley's
pub, this is no Sunset Boulevard, but for
Irvine-based breakout indie garage band The
lakes, you'd never know it. They treat their 12-
by-12-foot practice space like home.
Christmas lights dangle haphazardly from a
cracked white ceiling, and crumpled jeans and
chord scribblings lie strewn among open
instrument cases on the floor. For the sextet of

OC natives, their starving-artist lifestyle has
been successful. Professionally, at least, every
thing is going their way.
The Jakes were just a blip on the local
music radar when these members formed a
year and a half ago, until their August 2008
release of an upbeat seven-track EP, "Shake
My Hand," catapulted them into the indie
spotlight. Almost overnight, it was Battles of
the Bands and gigs at the House of Blues.
Now, The Jakes arc working on their first full
length CD under Red Light Management, an
artist management company in charge of
notables like Dave Matthews Band and Alanis
Morisette. It's a big step for a fledgling band,
and an even bigger one for lead vocalist
Sameer Gadhia.
A sophomore studying Hum Bio and
International Relations at Stanford until last
Christmas, Gadhia's focus was problem sets,
not set lists. "Becoming a musician was always
a dormant dream of mine, but 1 never really
knew that I was going to do this full-time," he
said. "1 was all about school." But now, The
Jakes' 19-year-old front man is jettisoning


MYSPACE. COM/THEJAKES

academics and striking out as a full
time musician. He says the switch is
temporary, but The Jakes show no
signs of slowing down, leaving
Gadhia with the eventual choice:
Stanford or The Jakes?
Gadhia sweetly laments, "If I
could find n way to see this straight
I'd run away/To some fortune that I
should have found by now"
The lyrics to "Cough Syrup," off
of The Jakes' EP, could easily be a
line out of Gadhia's diary.
Artistically, it's a romantic hypo
thetical — run toward your passion.
In practice, Gadhia is finding the
reality harder to swallow.

During his freshman year at
Stanford, Gadhia led a double life:
dedicated student by week and indie
band front-man on weekends. Bi
weekly, he road-tripped to Santa
Cruz and Orange County to
rehearse with his band mates, and
during that time The Jakes managed
to tease out an enormously success
ful EP despite the distance. But the
stressful schedule soon became too
much; in December, The Jakes got
Gadhia — who gave Stanford a
rain-check — full time.
The decision to go on academic
hiatus was a difficult decision for

The Jakes, but selling the idea of
dropping academics for a shot at
musical success to their parents was
an even bigger hurdle. Gadhia, who
comes from a musically-inclined
family, wasn't going to take any
chances about a parental veto.
"During Thanksgiving, we [the
band | had a joint four-hour meet
ing with our parents," he remem
bered. "We dressed up and got
paperwork and contract info and
basically did everything possible to
impress the shit out of our parents."
It worked — Gadhia convinced
his parents, but there was one

caveat: Music was a hobby.
Academics had to be the career.
But that distinction is gradually
eroding for Gadhia. While he still
wants to go back to Stanford, every
show he plays pushes academics fur
ther into the future.
"1 could be back next fall, the
year after that or a few years down
the road," Gadhia admitted. "At this
point, we're playing it by ear."
"Pude, if things go the way we
want them to," interjected Cannata,
speaking to Gadhia, "we won't be
going back."
Still, the band has yet to make
any Faustian deal with a major
record label. But with their funds
drying up, Gadhia hopes by next
month they'll be signed. He's excited
— but cautious.
"I have second doubts all the
time," Gadhia said. "It's really easy,
in fact, to have second doubts
because there are points where we
have extensive downtime — it's
then that you drive yourself insane.
If you're a Stanford student and go
from always being busy to suddenly
having nothing but music on your
plate, it's a tough transition. I defi
nitely think about it and wonder if I
made the right choice."

impress the shit out of our parents."
It worked — Gadhia convinced
his parents, but there was one

caveat: Music was a hobby.
Academics had to be the career.
But that distinction is gradually
eroding for Gadhia. While he still
wants to go back to Stanford, every
show he plays pushes academics fur
ther into the future.
"1 could be back next fall, the
year after that or a few years down
the road," Gadhia admitted. "At this
point, we're playing it by ear."
"Pude, if things go the way we
want them to," interjected Cannata,
speaking to Gadhia, "we won't be
going back."
Still, the band has yet to make
any Faustian deal with a major
record label. But with their funds
drying up, Gadhia hopes by next
month they'll be signed. He's excited
— but cautious.
"I have second doubts all the
time," Gadhia said. "It's really easy,
in fact, to have second doubts
because there are points where we
have extensive downtime — it's
then that you drive yourself insane.
If you're a Stanford student and go
from always being busy to suddenly
having nothing but music on your
plate, it's a tough transition. I defi
nitely think about it and wonder if I
made the right choice."
