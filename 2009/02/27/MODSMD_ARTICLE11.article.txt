Elcctric guitar riffs blast through the
dingy "sound-proofed" walls of what
looks like a nondescript warehouse in
Santa Ana, CA. Mid-chorus during a catchy,
Strokes-inspired ballad, a guitar shrieks and
brings the music to an abrupt halt.
"No, no, no," Eric Cannata yells over the
drums, dropping his guitar and letting it dan
gle from his shoulder. The 20-something
scruffy guitarist of The Jakes shakes his head.
"This pre-chorus definitely needs work."
Cannata nimbly fingers out a staccato chord
progression on his shiny electric a few times,
then strums out a fluid melody. "If we get the
dynamics down on this one, it'll be legit.
Sameer, give me vocals to this, okay?"
Situated near a dilapidated exterminator
business and the seedy-looking O'Malley's
pub, this is no Sunset Boulevard, but for
Irvine-based breakout indie garage band The
lakes, you'd never know it. They treat their 12-
by-12-foot practice space like home.
Christmas lights dangle haphazardly from a
cracked white ceiling, and crumpled jeans and
chord scribblings lie strewn among open
instrument cases on the floor. For the sextet of

OC natives, their starving-artist lifestyle has
been successful. Professionally, at least, every
thing is going their way.
The Jakes were just a blip on the local
music radar when these members formed a
year and a half ago, until their August 2008
release of an upbeat seven-track EP, "Shake
My Hand," catapulted them into the indie
spotlight. Almost overnight, it was Battles of
the Bands and gigs at the House of Blues.
Now, The Jakes arc working on their first full
length CD under Red Light Management, an
artist management company in charge of
notables like Dave Matthews Band and Alanis
Morisette. It's a big step for a fledgling band,
and an even bigger one for lead vocalist
Sameer Gadhia.
A sophomore studying Hum Bio and
International Relations at Stanford until last
Christmas, Gadhia's focus was problem sets,
not set lists. "Becoming a musician was always
a dormant dream of mine, but 1 never really
knew that I was going to do this full-time," he
said. "1 was all about school." But now, The
Jakes' 19-year-old front man is jettisoning
