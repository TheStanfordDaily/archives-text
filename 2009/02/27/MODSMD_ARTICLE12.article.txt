## "Dark was the Night:" Not just another crappy charity compilation album 
### 
Normally when people think of compilation
albums, the first things that come to mind arc the
"Now" or "Kidzbop" series. Then when people try
to recollect charity compilation albums, the albums get
even worse. Remember the 9/11 album released two weeks
after the tragedy? If not, You l übe Alan Jackson s Where
Were You? (When The World Stopped Turning)" and you
will be reminded of just how bad music on these records
generally are.
However, this is where "Dark Was the Night ups the
standards for the dreaded but well-intended charity compi
lation album. Assembled by the Dessner brothers, who
make up the incredible music group The National, "Dark
Was The Night" is a compilation CD whose proceeds goes
to fight AIDS. The compilation itself is a double-disc set

filled with essentially every single
indie group that has had a large
impact on today's music scene.
You probably think that I am
exaggerating — I swear I'm not.
On the CD jacket you'll find lists
of songs from artists such as The
Decemberists, Arcade Fire, Iron &
Wine, Conor Oberst from Bright
Eyes, Sufjan Stevens, Bon Iver,
Spoon, the New Pornographers,
Cat Power, My Morning Jacket

and many, many more. One look and you 11 know that this
album is made up of the biggest names — the bands who
headline the largest festivals across the globe.
However, Intermission also considers factors aside
from the awesome artist line-up. For example, are the
tracks on this album decent and not simply thrown togeth
er? Also, compilation albums can very easily fall into the

curse of a clunky, disorganized track list — do the songs fit
together into a coherent album?
This album has a lot of tracks for your dollar — 31
tracks costing a mere $15.00 on iTunes. Obviously, some
tracks are going to fall through the cracks, regardless of the
artist attached, because the album is just so long. Songs like
"Hey, Snow White," a cover of a Destroyer song done by the
New Pornographers, are very pop-esque and uplifting, with
an encouraging message and breezy sound. Others like
"Die" by folk artist Iron & Wine and"I Was Young When I

Left Home," an exquisite Bob Dylan cover by Antony with
Bryce Dessner (from The National), have a much sadder
sound, but arc still wonderfully sweet at the same time.
In fact, "Dark Was The Night" is full of songs that a lis
tener could pick for singles based on his or her favorite

the vital stats.

indie artist. However, I would say
this compilation achieves the near
impossible — flowing coherently
as a whole set. For the most part,
the general sound throughout the
album, regardless of different styles
of artistry, is that of folksy
Americana, not necessarily the
Death Cab for Cutie indie that the
mainstream world is used to. In my
opinion, this is better.
That beine said, some of the

tracks, while potentially noteworthy, still simply do not fit
in with the rest of the album. Sufjan Stevens, while tradi
tionally Americana, decided to forgo his regular sound.to
try something experimental. His song "You Are i he Blood
will be incredibly hard to swallow tor even the most-experi
enced experimental listeners. Clocking in at ten minutes
and 14 seconds, it's a track you'll definitely skip if it pops up
on shuffle.
"You Are The Blood" definitely isn't the only dud on
this album. Even some songs from the biggest and best

names in the business are just mistakes that should not have been
included in the album. This is a rarity, though; the vast majority of
the album is a sheer treat for listeners who will not only feel good
about the music, but also about the great cause they spent their
money on.
"Dark Was the Night" is a rare jewel amongst the endless num
ber of compilation albums available. Not only is it dedicated to an
enormously worthy cause, but the music is also incredible. Ihe
Dressner brothers — arguably geniuses themselves and highly
revered throughout the indie music world — have brought together
some of the best artists of our generation to contribute new materi
al in which listeners will find pure joy. This is one album you should
definitely own. Forget Limewire this time, and spend the money on
great music and a truly good cause.
