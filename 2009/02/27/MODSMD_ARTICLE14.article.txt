# Looking for a bedroom bailout?
## 
### 
Let's face it: the economy is going down
faster than Britney Spears at a tractor haul.
Times are tough, but for some reason
Washington seems for more stressed about
banks and the auto industry that about what's
going on in your pants. John McCain isn't exact
ly using his time back in the Senate to push for a
vote on vibrator tax reductions.
John McCain may not care about your sex
life, but Roxy does. She understands that
romance can be tricky on a budget, but encour
ages her campus readers not to try anything free
but stupid to spice up their sex life — anything
involving a bollard is probably a bad idea.
Roxy wishes she could be here to bail out
your love life. Unfortunately, sex is not where
you want to save money — there's a reason the
Sexual Health Peer Resource Center (SHPRC)
doesn't sell used dildos for half off. The best
advice is to spend your cash on top-quality sex
products and avoid throwing away money on
items that won't get you hot and heavy, like your
o-chem textbook. If your o-chem textbook does
get you hot and heavy, well, Roxy hates to think
what you're doing with those model molecules
they give you.
If you're anything like Roxy, you probably
notice a plethora of phallic-shaped objects

around campus. You may be thinking this is a
way you can get out of spending $50 for the
Rabbit, but think again. Let's take a closer look
at those under-ripe bananas in the dining hall.
There's no way Stanford Dining actually expects
you to eat those bananas. But some words of
wisdom: when it comes to the bedroom, green
and hard isn't usually a good thing.
In general, sex toys are an area where it's
worth spending the extra buck. Roxy knows that
not everyone likes whips and chains, but

she's pretty sure no one likes whips
and bike chains. Thanks to the

rainy season, there's also a good
chance your bike is rustier than,

well, Britney Spears at a tractor
haul. Do you really want to

have to explain to the emer
gency room staff why you
need that tetanus booster?
Plus, there's always a chance

you can't get the rusty chain
unlocked after your love play is

complete. Roxy has an inkling that

Stanford Bike Shop staff are right up there
with OSA employees on the list of people
you don't want to involve in your post-coita
affairs.

Sex toys, however, are not the only costly
aspects of a healthy relationship. You may also
think that you can forego that weekend at the
spa for a little in-house love romp. Roxy, howev
er, has a few words that should strike fear into
every lover's heart: low-flow showerheads. These
may be great for the environment, but when it
comes to your sex life, you probably want to
make avoiding anything labeled Mow-flow' a rule
of thumb (or hand).

Most importantly, Roxy read
ers, never try to scrimp and
save on protection. That

dining hall lasagna may
look like rubber; it's not

And while those gloves
you wear in bio lab might

be extra-protective, you
probably don't want any

thing in your nether
regions that an amoeba

has touched. Pay the extra

money tor the sturdy con
ioms. If you don't, chances are

you re likely to get pregnant
("aster than, well, Britney Spears

at a tractor haul.
