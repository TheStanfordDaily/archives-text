# Hello, Parents!
## 
### 
Dear Parents,
I'm addressing this letter to
you, because this is your weekend.
Yup, that's right. This weekend is all
about you. All of the other weekends
at Stanford are dedicated to your
children and their homework, their
extra-curricular activities and their
loud rap music. Those weekends are
really pretty similar to every single
weekend you spent raising them,
and those, as we all remember, were
just one long headache. Hut no, this
weekend is different. This weekend
is when Stanford and its students
(your kids) finally give you the
respect, recognition and special
treatment that you deserve.
So go ahead and enjoy it. There
are lots of fun things to do. You can
go to lectures and remember how
much fun it is to learn things. If
you're an alumnus, you can go
around to all your old haunts and
remember how much fun it is to
haunt things. If you have a son or
daughter here on campus, you can
hang out with them and remember
how much fun it is to foot the bill at
restaurants. If you don't have a son
or daughter here on campus, then

you might want to reconsider your
status as a "parent," or at least
reevaluate your reasons for making
the trip out.
But while you're out there lis
tening to lectures, haunting haunts
and loving the monetary black hole
that is your child, you might start
feeling a little out of place. Don't
worry. You can admit it. You feel a
little intimidated by the whole "col
lege scene."
For some of you, this might be
somewhat disappointing. Back
when you were in college, you were
totally hip. You were diggin' sweet
vibes like ditches, grooving to
crunchy jams and generally keeping
things copasetic. But now every
thing is different, and you might feel
left behind. You might walk around
campus and overhear conversations
in which you can understand only
half the words being spoken. You
might see people zipping around on
bikes or playing hackey-sack or
making diving grabs at Frisbees and
think, "I remember when my body
could do all of those things."
Well, if that is the case, you
should at least take comfort in the
knowledge that you arc not alone.
Things like that happen to me pret
ty much every day, and I'm a bona
fide young person. Sometimes you
just have to embrace your differ
ences. That's what diversity is all
about. And Stanford loves diversity.
I think. It might just love a variety of
culturally based drumming and
dance styles, which is still a kind of
diversity. At the very least, Stanford
loves parents, so embrace your par
enthood with brash enthusiasm!
For one thing, if your son or
daughter has friends, they will try
hard to impress you. A lot of
Stanford students grow up being the
"favorite friend." Namely, we arc
that kid whose friends' moms
always wished would come over
more because we're such good influ
ences. We make eye contact when
we talk to adults, we speak clearly
and sincerely and we say please and
thank you. Now, imagine going out
to dinner with a group of kids des
perate to reaffirm themselves as the
"favorite friend." That's going to be

fun for everyone. And if you find
yourself in this situation, don't shy
away from announcing a winner.
You might even want to establish a
hierarchy so the losers know how
close they came to your affections.
Your approval is desirable. Don't
waste it.
In the same vein as reserving
your approval, you want to main
tain your status as "parent." A classic
mistake made by many of the par
ents in teen comedies is that they try
to be too relatable. We don't want to
relate to you. We want you to not
understand us at all. We want you to
be frustratingly un-cool until you
come through with some sage
advice that turns out to be just what
wc needed to hear, even if we didn't
know it at the time. Think along the
lines of Pat Morita in the Karate
Kid. We want you to make us wax
the car, even if we think it's totally
lame at the time, because later on it
will mean we can kick ass.

It might help to take a crash
course in what young people are up
to these days. For example, young
people these days still love to rebel.
Counter-culture is still the only cul
ture worth embracing, but it gets
confusing nowadays because things
aren't as clear-cut. We have a whole
spread of vintage counter-cultures
to draw on (punks, hippies, civil
rights activists, feminists,
Darwinians, etc.) as well as a whole
bunch of relatively new ones
(oppressed urban youth, depressed
suburban youth, etc.). l ong hair on
a boy isn't really going to get anyone
that riled up anymore. Marijuana is
a less inflammatory substance than
tobacco. Being a pacifist isn't quite
as powerful a statement sans draft,
and we have a black person as presi
dent.
Aside from that, being a college
student today is pretty much the
same as always. We don't know what
we're going to do with our lives, so

please don't push us too hard on the
subject, especially if we're not your
kid. Some of us have really well
rehearsed monologues we can
throw at you, but a lot of us don't.
So if you ask us what are plans are
post-graduation and we respond
with "I don't know," then please
accept this as our well-rehearsed
monologue and move on. This
would be a perfect time for that
Karate Kid-style advice, however.
Channel a little Pat Morita and
teach us to kick ass.
All in all, enjoy the weekend.
Relish in the child you raised and
the college experience you have
managed to provide for them.
Speaking from my own position as a
child of parents, I think 1 can speak
for all of us when 1 say that we are a
wonderful group of kids, and you
did a wonderful job raising us.
