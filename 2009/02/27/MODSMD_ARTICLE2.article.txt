## Welcome to THE "Dollhouse" 
### 
For all Joss Whedon fans out there, something very exciting
was introduced into your lives recently: "Dollhouse,"
Whedon's new sci-fi show, has already aired two episodes
on FOX, and now it's time for Intermission to give you its take
on the new drama.
"Dollhouse" is Whedon's second foray into broadcast
ing on FOX. His first attempt, "Firefly," was canceled despite
attracting adoring fans across the globe. Let me attempt to
explain the premise of his new show to you all, but don't worry
if you don't follow — it is sort of confusing.
"Dollhouse" tells the tale of genetically altered super
humans who are called "dolls." They are all beautiful and live in
the Dollhouse, the laboratory where they are cared for and
watched over. And billionaires come to the Dollhouse to hire
dolls for different tasks — where the main premise for the show
lies. Every doll has the ability to be anything and anyone because
they have personalities of experts uploaded into their brain as

each mission dictates, similar to "The Matrix." After every mis- i
sion, the dolls return to the Dollhouse, where they have their
memories wiped, and return to child-like zombies with no recol- <
lection of anything before the mind-wipe. I
Eliza Dushku ("Buffy the Vampire Slayer," "Angel,"
"Bring It On") stars as Echo, a doll who is slowly realizing that ;
there may be more to her past outside of the Dollhouse. In the

first two episodes, she takes on the roles of prosti-

tute, hostage negotiator and ruthless killer. She

is an expert in all types of operations due to

the wide variety of personalities the lab-

oratory has on hand.

While this seems to be a
promising concept, many pitfalls j
.... t • i

and critical errors were made in the
pilot episode. For those of you
familiar with Whedon's work — J

he created "Firefly," "Buffy the
Vampire Slayer" and "Angel

— you know that he has a
penchant for interesting dia-

logue with lots of quirks
thrown in. "Dollhouse" is full

of clunky dialogue and sur
prisingly bad direction, with

the majority of Dushku's
expressions reflecting blank

confusion and zero investment in
the character.

Once the hurried exposition
is over and the action starts, however,

Whedon shines once again. I found

myself literally gasping out loud as the sus-
pense and action scenes are perfectly executed

by the master. The plot is also interesting and has
great possibilities — after all, Echo transforms into

new person every show.
Unfortunately, that aspect could also be the
death of the show. If Echo is never her own character, will
the audience ever be invested in the show's lead? I trust
Whedon to have seen this plot hole, though, and to have
already created a solution.

1 have great hope for a show like "Dollhouse."
With a fun sci-fi plot, pretty girls and badass action

sequences, there could very well be more Whedon
classics for us fan-boys and fan-girls to devour.

Cross your fingers that the initial

j slipups won't enact the FOX

KmL curse and leave it cancelled

early on
