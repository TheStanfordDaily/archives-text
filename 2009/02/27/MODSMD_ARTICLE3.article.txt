For those of you that think Stephanie Meyer and "Twilight" were
the forerunners of our generation's obsession with vampires, you are
utterly mistaken. Edward Cullen has nothing on Buffy the Vampire Slayer,
who captured the hearts of millions. Whedon was the creator of the
smash television series "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" and its equally success
ful spinoff, "Angel."

In fact, Dushku, the star of "Dollhouse," shone
in an incredibly large role on both of these series. Once
Whedon deems you science fiction material, you are set
for life; millions will wait in line anticipating your
appearance at Comic Con and other such giant conven
tions.
However, the crown jewel in Whedon's collec
tion may be "Firefly," the short-lived television series that
becime a cult classic after its cancellation — it even gar
nered a wide-released film as an extension of the beloved
series. "Firefly" tells the story of a group of nomadic
space wanderers who live their life as smugglers, but sud
denly find themselves facing a much bigger problem
than that of a life on the run.
Most recently, Whedon forayed into Internet
TV with "Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along-Blog," which starred
Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillion (from "Firefly).
The series is a wonderful dip into Whedon's twisted,
genius mind.

Here at Intermission, we can only hope that "Dollhouse" lives up
to its predecessors and keeps Whedon comfortably on his throne as the
ultimate king of science fiction.
