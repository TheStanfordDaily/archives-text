Annika Heinle

was born in the far reaches of
Siberia and was raised by a pack

or wolves, learned the bnglish %
language from a prisoner with whom 1
she roomed in the Gulag (a Russian
concentration camp), where she also
learned how to distill a fine potato
vodka. After escaping the Gulag and
simultaneously killing four members of
the KGB, she moved to the great nation

of America and began attending regular school with regular children
not wolves. Annika learned that music and movies were her i

life. She then came to Stanford and was shocked to find the
publication that is Intermission. Intermission was basically
. a conglomeration of everything she knows and loves^

so naturally she is now the desk editor of

this incredible, life-saving piece of

Amanda Zhang is a New York

City-native transplanted to the scary world of
palm trees, clean air (relatively speaking) and driv
ing everywhere. She misses eating shitty Greek diner
food at 4 a.m., but she doesn't miss the construction
workers at the site one block away. Amanda is
obsessed with knee-high boots, tiny little dresses,
wearing all black and fashion in general. That and her
position as photo editor means she spends way too
much time per week looking at pictures online. She
loves sushi and Indian food, and — most crucial fact

— her favorite Disney movie is "Pocahontas." She is fluent in three lan
guages. You can tell her apart from everyone else on Intermission from her
hair — it's getting way too long. She has a two-year-old half-sister
named Lea and a 10-year-old half-brother named Yves (as in Yves
Saint Laurent). Amanda has adopted quite a few manner
isms from her little sister, including pronouncing
the word "egg" as "eeg."

As our loyal readers might already know after three issues

Kelsey, Mae and Alice all left with the last volume — leaving Intermission to a brand new staff! It's a while
into the volume already, but we thought we might introduce ourselves anyway. Beware, though: We

are a very quirky bunch. As a result, you are bound to see differences in content and layout this

volume — such as the sudden increase in fashion-related articles. If there's anyone to blame
. for that, it's me. If you have any complaints, compliments, suggestions, whatever. I'd love
X. t0 hear them. Feel free to email me at intermission.dailyfamnail.com. Until then!

Kyle Evaldez — our newly appointed

desk-editor — could not be present to write a biography of himself.
He's too busy celebrating his upper-classman status. (Read: He's partying it
up at Senior Night.) However, you probably remember him as the guy who
wrote all those Oscar lead-up movie reviews. But now that the Oscars are
over, he's still writing movie reviews ... so we took the hint and just
dragged him onto staff. Expect even more — if that's even
possible — from him soon.

Joey Xu (pronounced: Shoe) is an illusionist and a

serious problem child. She may look like a nice, friendly person
sometimes, but don't be fooled. She loves to wear crazy clothes and her

favorite place to go buy shoes is a strip
store. Since her parental units realized *
that she was going to be short for the rest
of her life (a harsh blow and great surprise
considering her parents' formidable stature),
1 she has been forbidden from wearing flat
shoes — or any heel below three inches for
that matter. Her greatest desires are to get in
a physical fight, live underwater for a year,
get one more tattoo on top of the existing
eight, go bald and never have to eat or I
sleep ever again in her life. She is A
determined to make all of these come
true. You arc most likely to find her
living in her own bubble, where

she is always reading WSJ, updating her fashion blog or
people into writing for Intermission^^^

A lot of Chinese guys arc named Jin,
and a lot of Chinese people have the
last name Yll — but make no mis- <

take, Jin Yu is a full-blooded Korean
female. There are only a few things you need

to know about her: A) She was abandoned
by her parents at age six and again at age
13. B) She likes to say she loves to draw.

but when she really has to draw, she
doesn't want to draw. C) She likes draw
ing naked ladies. She can do it all day.

She's done it all day. If you find an)
weird or inappropriate doodles
stuck on Intermission . . .
shhh, but she did it.
