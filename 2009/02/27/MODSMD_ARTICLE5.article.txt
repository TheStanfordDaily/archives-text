# Michael Uslan
## THE
						MAN BEHIND THE BAT 
### 
Crossing the stage in a dark suit and pristinely shined shoes, Michael
Uslan exudes Hollywood. A closer look at his attire, however,
reveals a crucial feature of his wardrobe: a Spider-Man tie.
It reflects Uslan's character very well. The producer of the "Batman"
films since 1989, Uslan had been working for 20-plus years to achieve the
monumental success of "The Dark Knight." Last Sunday, Heath Ledger
received a posthumous Oscar for his "phenomenal portrayal of a dis
turbed individual" as the Joker. At around the same time, "The Dark
Knight" hit the $1 billion mark in box office revenues.
But Uslan wasn't at Stanford last night to boast of his paramount
achievements; he was here to tell of his journey from being a young fan of
graphic novels in New Jersey to becoming a big name in Hollywood pro
ductions.
Uslan's parents encouraged his early fascination with graphic novels.
While other parents discourage the childhood fantasies that comic books
induce, his parents supported Uslan's obsession — so long as he continued
to read the news and other novels. Over time, Uslan managed to amass a
collection of over 35,000 comic books dating from 1936 onward.
Within his vast collection, he found Batman to be the most interest
ing comic book character. To Uslan, the Batman comics had the coolest,
most relatable and human hero and villains. Uslan was convinced that "if I
studied hard, 1 worked out real hard and my dad bought me a cool car, I
could be Batman." He fell in love with the dramatization of graphic novels
and, wanting to eliminate the POW, ZAP, and WHAM factors in graphic
novels, Uslan soon realized that his goal was to create a dark, serious rep
resentation of Batman.
After high school, Uslan pursued a degree in history at Indiana
University in Bloomington. During his junior year, Uslan decided to par
ticipate in the University's "experimental curriculum:" If a student had an
idea for a course, he or she could petition to appear before a panel and
argue the case for accreditation of the proposed course. Not one to forget
his love of comic books, Uslan pitched the idea of a course on graphic
novels. He went to the folklore department and argued that comics are art.
"Comic books are modern-day mythology — ancient gods in spandex
and capes," Uslan said. "Greeks had Hermes, Romans had Mercury — I
call him the Flash. The Greeks had Poseidon, the Romans had Neptunes—
I had Aquaman."
Initially, Uslan was rejected. A comparison likening Moses to
Superman finally sold his idea, though, and that's how Uslan became the
world's first professor of comic books.
Introducing graphic novels into mainstream culture was crucial
toward eventually dramatizing Batman. The day after his acceptance,
Uslan called United Press International with the news that, at Indiana
University, a professor was teaching a class that was a "Communist plot to
subvert the youth of America." The next day, reporters from magazines,
ranging from "Parade" to "Playboy," sat in on lectures. He attracted the
attention of the heads of both Marvel Comics and DC Comics. Since DC
Comics owned the rights to Batman, Uslan eventually took a job with
them in New York.
At that point in life, with his future in Hollywood uncertain, Uslan's
backup plan was law school. After attending law school at Indiana, howev
er, he realized that he'd never realize his goal of bringing Batman to the
big screen as a serious figure unless he refused to take no for an answer.
Thus, in 1979, Uslan began pitching a Batman movie. After 10 years and
numerous rejections saying that Batman could never be anything more
than the vibrant crime-fighter portrayed by Adam West, Tim Burton saw
promise in his proposal and later that year, the movie "Batman" was
released starring Michael Keaton as the brooding, complex Bruce Wayne.
Twenty years and six "Batman" movies later, Uslan has revolutionized
the role of graphic novels in Hollywood. But for him, the success he has
achieved today is not as important as the journey.
"If you think it's about the numbers or awards ands statues and
things like that, you're completely wrong," he said. "It has nothing to do
with anything. It's about a dream. It's about a journey."
