# intermission? Q&A
## 
### 
with Executive Producer Michael Uslari

Intermission (i): First off, 1 want to
take this opportunity to thank you
for taking time out to discuss your
recent and upcoming projects.
Wonder Con is this weekend, and 1
know you're scheduled to appear, so
tell us how you feel about
Hollywood's recent influences in
these comic-based conventions.
Uslan: I just came from the New
York Comic-Con at the lavits
Center in New York — 77,000 peo
ple — where the emphasis was on
comic books and comic art. That
was the greatest rave and buzz going
around this convention. The graph
ic artists and comic book dealers
weren't stuck way in the back —
they were featured and it was a won
derful thing to see. It is very differ
ent from the Comic-Con in San
Diego, and Hollywood is putting
that in jeopardy.
i: You've attended so many of these
conventions. What was your favorite
Comic-Con?
Uslan: I was at the very first comic
book convention ever held. I was in
seventh grade, it was July 1964 at the
Broadway Central Hotel at the
Barry — it later collapsed on itself
— and there were 200 of us at the
first Comic-Con. My mom and dad
took us and we literally had to step
over unconscious drunks in the
hallway at the hotel in order to reg
ister. My parents were absolutely
freaking out. But that was the origin
of Comic-Con that weekend — the
July 4 weekend. It's really cool to

remember that and go to San
Diego, where there are now
135,000 people in attendance,
i: That's right! You were at the
last convention. I think the

movie at the time was
"Twilight," which completely domi
nated.
Uslan: I completely agree; it attract
ed a different audience, and it's
almost like they could've split that
convention in two: one Comic-Con
and one Media-Con.
i: Well your work has largely influ
enced the series that are there today.
How do you feel when you hear
claims that your work has revolu
tionized the role of graphic novels
in Hollywood? So many people have
recognized that Michael Kcaton's
role as Batman laid the framework
for the "Spider-Man" series, "Iron
Man," "The Incredible Hulk,"
"Transformers," "The Spirit" and
other movies.
Uslan: I am honored by so many
acknowledging that the first
"Batman" movie of'B9 was the one
that started it all — that if it wasn't
for that movie, none of these would
be the way they are, and when Zach
Snyder tells you that and other film
makers tell you something like that,
it's a great honor. It's been years of
an uphill battle all the way through,
but in retrospect, it was one worth
fighting. My kids got a big kick out
of it because, on the Internet,
they've been calling me the godfa
ther of comic books from Jersey, so
that's an honor as well, I suppose.
i: Before I let you go back to the
party, I have one last question that
I'm sure everyone wants to know: In

your time producing the "Batman"
films, who was your favorite
Batman, and who was your favorite
villain?
Uslan: The question is not who my
favorite Batman is, hut who my
favorite Bruce Wayne is. Christian
Bale portrays Bruce exactly as 1
wanted him to be portrayed — the
dark, serious Batman with internal
struggles. As for villain, I would
have to say the loker — Heath
Ledger, not lack Nicholson. The
Joker is the greatest villain ever cre
ated in the history of comic books.
He's been portrayed so many differ
ent ways, from a silly clown to a
stark-raving, homicidal maniac.
The joker's facade hides the horror
lurking beneath the surface. I see
Batman and the Joker along the
same face at a very thin line. Batman
could ve gone to the dark side, and
the joker could've joined the other
side, which is why it's interesting
that the good guy is the dark bat and
the bad guy is under the guise of a
happy guy. Nicholson was over the
top. Ledger conveyed the maniacal,
chaotic villain, which is interesting,
given the 9-11/post-9-11 themes on
the undercurrent. This is a guy that
has no value placed on life. It's ran
dom, it's chaotic, and in the last 10
years or so this has obviously
echoed and hit a nerve.
i: I'd never thought of the Joker as
that complex. Well, 1 wanted to
thank you again for this opportuni
ty —it's an amazing legacy.
Uslan: No problem. I'll see you at
Wonder Con.
