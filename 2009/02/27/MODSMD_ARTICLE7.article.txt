# FiLM REVIEW
## So in love with "Two" Is Joaquin Phoenix's "final" film worth the trip? 
### 
Oscar season is over, folks. If you
haven't already seen films like
"Slumdog Millionaire" and"The
Reader," then you clearly have a lot of catch
ing up to do. Now, as these award winning
lilms slowly recede from the movie theaters,
one central question remains: what is left to
watch? Are we doomed to mediocre films
until the summer wave of blockbusters?
I hankfully, that answer is a resounding no
— James Gray's latest film "Two Lovers" is a
heart-wrenchingly poignant story about love
and loss.
Drama-romance movies are always a
tough genre to tackle because there are sim
ply only so many ways in which a love story
can be conveyed on screen. Because of this,
the best romance films are the ones that offer
something fresh and unique. Basically, the
fewer cliches these films have, the better.
Thankfully, " Iwo Lovers' does this right and
offers an honest, almost too realistic account
of how relationships form and often fail.
Set in the bleak and isolated area of
Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, the story opens
with the character of Leonard, played by
Joaquin Phoenix, who has been making an
interesting 'name' for himself recently (just
You Tube him to see what I'm talking about).
Right away, we realize that Leonard is dam
aged as he tries to commit suicide in the
movie's first scene. We then quickly learn that
this wasn't his first attempt, and that Leonard

is constantly waging war against his
inner demons. Can you really blame
him, though? He is a thirty-some-

thing-year-old man living with his '
parents and working in their dry
cleaning business — all because his

fiancee, the love of his live, left him
after she found out they could not have
kids together. On the flip side, Leonard

regardless of his emotional baggage, is
also a very goofy and kind-hearted, albeit
off-beat, fellow.

Leonard isn't the only intricate char
acter here. His love interest, Michelle,
played by (Iwyncth Faltrow, is also incredi-

bly flawed and layered. Leonard falls in love
at first sight with Michelle, his apartment
neighbor. However, she isn't the typical girl
next-door; she is currently entangled in an
affair with a married man — her boss. Not to
mention her recreational drug-using habits.
Regardless of her "flaws," however, we quick
ly realize that she is the one that Leonard
wants. Thus begins the emotional roller
coaster that is this film.

Setting up these complex characters
early on is always a good strategy in films
because it skews all future character interac
tions in the story. Predictability goes out the
window — since Leonard and Michelle are
so erratic and sometimes volatile, you never
know what to expect from them, making this
love story so intriguing and gripping that you
easily ignore the slow and quiet pacing of the

film itself.
As for the movie itself, "Two Lovers" also
looks beautiful. The dark and dreary colors ol
Brighton Beach really accent the loneliness ol
the characters, and the framing used in several
shots made anally retentive film people like
myself drool. Fhe music is also very subtle, but
adds well to the overall emotional tone of the
film.
So we have complex characters and a pret
ty film, but how is the story itself? The rela
tionship between Michelle and Leonard is not
simple by any means. Leonard clearly has feel
ings for his neighbor, but she is too caught up
with her current affair. To make matters even
more complicated, Leonard has to deal with
pressure from his parents to date a family
friend, who happens to also fall head-over
heels for Leonard. As the story progresses, we
basically get a needlessly complicated Woody
Allen-esque love triangle among the charac
ters.
Unlike other love triangles in movies, this
one is much more than about drama and
entertainment. During many times in the
course of the film, I found myself nodding,

completely relating to the characters. The situ
ation in the film is a very common yet tragic
question: should we fight for the one that we
truly love even though they don't love us in
return, or should we just be choose the person
that is "safe" for us? Regardless, the film builds
on these questions until a climax that is as

depressing as it is realistic. Be ready to feel
bad for the characters — but at the same
i time know that this is just how life works

out sometimes.
The situations that Leonard and the cast
i get into are incredibly gut-wrenching at

times. We've all been confused and hurt
by love; we've all been there. So if you are
| looking for a heartbreaking slice-of-life

story about relationships, then I would

definitely recommend checking out "Two
Lovers." If this film is truly Joaquin Phoenix's
last film — well, at least he ended on a high
note.

It.
