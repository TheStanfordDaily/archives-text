# London Fashion Week Grows Up
## 
### 
1 GILES
Giles Deacon put together an incredi
bly experimental collection. He
showed a print based on fishing flies,
huge hats with mirrored brims, hand
cuffs, rubber t-shirts, big fur arm
warmers, spiked gowns and plastic
skirts. Some pieces were fantastic, and
others were questionable, but the
show is definitely something we've
come to expect from London.

10 trend: dyed fur
We are seeing obnoxiously big and bright furs at Marios
Schwab, Jaeger London, Aquascutum and Giles Deacon.

11 VIVIENNE
WESTWOOD
RED LABEL
The. theme at this show was prep
school gone punk. Westwood cast Jo
Wood, who was recently left by her
husband Ronnie Wood, the Rolling
Stones guitarist, for a younger
woman, as the sexy, cleavage-flashing
principal. Carelessly disheveled jack
ets, flashes of plaid pattern, rumpled
sweaters and asymmetrical silhou
ettes dominated the show. The final
effect was surprisingly cohesive, and
the footwear was stunning as usual.

12 MODEL profile:
JOURDAN DUNN
Jourdan Dunn landed in Paris with a splash last fall as the first black
model in ten years to walk for Prada. Last November, she was named
Model of the Year by the British Fashion Council. So far this season,
she's had an amazing week in New York — and she followed it up
with an equally stellar show list in London, her native city. She
opened and closed three shows: Mary Katrantzou, Issa and Mulberry.
She closed Morno, TwentyBTwelve and Betty Jackson, and opened
Vivienne Westwood Red Label. On top of that, she walked Ossie
Clark, Giles, Jaeger London, Julien Macdonald, Topshop Unique,
Christopher Kane and Aquascutum. She must be exhausted after the
last two weeks — she booked 21 major shows in New York, including
Oscar de la Rcnta, for whom she opened and closed.

London has always been the rebellious little sister of the four
major fashion weeks (New York, London, Milan and Paris). Avant
garde designers like Gareth Pugh get their feet wet there before
moving on to Paris, but this season, collections seem to have
grown more refined, color palettes are more restrained and outfits
are cinched in at the waist.

2 BIGGEST WTF

What is this vaguely phallic Giles
piece meant to invoke? The model
looks rightfully miserable. Yves Saint
Laurent was more successful at
pulling this concept off when he
tried it out.

9 JASPER CONRAN
Here is the collection that exemplifies the trends we are seeing on London's runways. Models with carefully coifed hair strode down the
catwalk with waists pinched to preposterously tiny circumferences. The clothes feature a touch of Spanish glamour, delicate lace details
and garter belts hidden underneath. Every single piece was black.

3 trend: clinched waists
The hourglass figure is back in London. Perhaps Pugh took the city's pen
chant for fantastically absurd geometric volume with him when he left.

4 AQUA
SCUTUM
Aquascutum combined the
old and new in both model
choice and fashion design.
Pieces were voluminous and
combined a variety of tex
tures and fabrics. But out
side the excitement of seeing
the veteran models of yester
day, nothing was very inspir
ing or particularly pretty.

CHRISTOPHER
KANE

This was probably one of the
best collections this season in
London. The relentless circle
scales last season were a bit
repetitive and even campy, but
his show this time around was
very well-edited. The scalloped
circles have been replaced by
clean lines that lend the clothes
a graphic feel without being
overdone. The colors are more
toned down so we can see that
the real focus was the design.
The dresses were wonderful,
and the splash of holographic
color in the middle of the show
was used with great effect.

5 trend: paint splatters
Back to finger painting? A lot of British designers featured prints that
resembled paint splatters. Check out Erdem, Jaeger London, Richard
Nicoll, Peter Pilotto and Marios Schwab.

6 TOPSHOP UNIQUE
It's nice to be able to look at one show where you
can actually afford the clothes. The creative
designers drew inspiration from science fiction,
rave culture and the grunge era, but weren't too
literal about it. As a result, we get great layered
looks that break apart into very wearable sepa
rates, a bunch of fun dresses and some very
interesting pants.

8 MARION SCHWABB
You only need one word to describe Marios
Schwab's collection: crystalline. He adorned neck
lines with encrusted stones, but the shapes of the
dresses themselves had a vaguely geographic quali
ty as well. The strongly tailored pieces featured
double layers, with a larger size concealing a small
er dress beneath, revealed through cracked fissures.
Some of the prints looked like veined marble, and
overall, the collection was quite interesting and
beautiful.
