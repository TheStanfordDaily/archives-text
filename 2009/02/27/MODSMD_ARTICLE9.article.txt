# Student musicians welcome interactive songwriting workshops
## 
### 
Stanford Lively Arts is known for bringing world
renowned string quartets, theatrically staged readings
and interdisciplinary choreo-poems onto Stanford
stages. Their events are high-class, culturally elevated affairs
and are very popular among the middle-aged, cveningwear
crowd. As a rule, these performances are also exceptionally
unfrequented by Stanford students. Either the cost of a ticket
or the prospect of wearing a tie discourages many students
from attending the performances of these skilled artists that
come to Stanford every year.
So Lively Arts decided to switch it up a bit.
Lively Arts, along with Stanford's student-run SOCA
(Student Organizing Committee for the Arts), has brought a
new songwriting workshop series to Roble. The workshops,
led by renowned artists whom Lively Arts brings to Stanford,
are a chance for budding student musicians to interact with
professional artists on a casual level.
Within the group of artists coming to Stanford for the
2008-2009 season, the directors of Lively Arts noticed an
unusual number of musicians skilled in teaching and com
fortable in small, intimate gatherings. With Lively Arts pro
viding the musicians and the funding, SOCA giving the stu
dent-level involvement and promotion and Roble donating
the space, the songwriting workshops were born.
"This isn't a concert," said Lisa Mezzacappa, Lively Arts
campus program manager. "We have plenty of concerts, but
this is a participatory event.
"If you're a shower singer, and you bring that song you
sing in the shower, you can pair up with a guitarist,"
Mezzacappa said. "Don't be afraid to bring anything you
might be working on. You can bring an instrument, you can
sing; if you're an artist that works in digital form, you can set
up on our P.A."
Depending on the temperament of the workshop leader,
the workshops can showcase the featured artist playing his or
her own music, describing a personal songwriting process, lis
tening to the work of other students or having everybody jam
on whatever instrument they can find.
"My favorite part is when the featured artist calls for
people from the audience to come up and play, and some
fledgling singer-songwriter walks up, looking worried, and
the audience is worried, and then the featured musician and
the students start playing together," said Jake Constine, the
music director of SOCA. "Then there's this wonderful syner

getic effect, things that completely defy genre, and it's amaz
ing to see people's faces light up.
The workshops are all free and held in Roble Hall
Theater. Three workshops have already occurred with artists
Rokia Traore, Mike Block and Esperanza Spalding, respective
ly-

Block is trained as a
classical cellist, but he's
also a songwriter and
plays "charming pop
songs" on his cello, as
described by Mezzacappa.
Traore, born in Mali, is a
singer, songwriter and
guitarist.
In Traore's work
shop, two students
improvised together so
well that others in the
room assumed they had
played together before.
The two seniors, Ben
Burdick on the harmoni
ca and Alex Greenberg on
guitar, played with a
"campfire-side jam" feel,
according to Constine.
When Traore began to
sing along with their

tune, her African influence invested their simple jam with an
otherworldly quality. This genre-bending collaboration is
exactly the result that the workshop series encourages.
I had the fortune to attend the third songwriting work
shop with Esperanza Spalding. A jazz musician, Spalding sang
a few songs of her own for us, accompanying herself on an
upright bass that dwarfed her small frame.

For Future Reference ...
There are two more workshops in this series. Rinde
Eckert — a theater artist, librettist and lyricist — will hold a
workshop March 5. Lila Downs, a vocalist and songwriter, will
hold her workshop March 31.
Aside from the songwriting workshops, there are other
opportunities for amateur musicians on campus to get to
know artists or get exposure. Mezzacappa recommended the
artist show-and-tell series at the CoHo and at Wallenberg this
school year, which are as informal as the songwriting work
shops. Artists will show videos on their laptops and do magic
tricks for the crowd.-Constine also suggested SOCA's "An Art
Affair," coming up April 16-19. Art Affair is a non-competitive
format for all student-created art; everyone who signs up can
present their music, writing, performance, photography or
visual art. You can get more information at livelyarts.stan
ford.edu/campus and soca.stanford.edu.

Along with playing music, Spalding also described her
own songwriting process. She shared anecdotes from her
life as a songwriter — including a memorable day when
Stanley Clark sat her down with a pen, paper and some
music he had written — and asked her to finish the lyrics
to his song.
"Stanley Clark — he's like the wolverine of bass play
ers," she said ruefully. "And I had one day in Los Angeles. I
sat there, and it took me three hours."
Writing songs, Spalding said, is a talent to be practiced
like any other. She finished her song for Clark because she
had been practicing the skill of completing a song. Hutting
fragments of a tune together and finishing the piece is hard
to do, she acknowledged, but being able to create some
thing acceptable — and to do so quickly — is a valuable
skill.
"You can always go back and fix it," Spalding reminded
us.
To demonstrate her songwriting process, she decon
structed one of her own original songs to demonstrate how
inspiration struck and how she built on it.
"I was practicing leaps in tune, she said, plucking ran
dom notes up and down the neck of her bass. She hit four
or five notes in a pleasing sequence, saying, "And then that
happened." Spalding played the same notes, and then added
a higher trill and a quick sweep down the scale. "And then
that happened."
Showing is clearly easier than telling when describing
the songwriting process. In light of that, Spalding pulled
four audience members to demonstrate the songs they were
in the process of writing. She helped a singer with no
chords create a backup to his song, created a bass line for a
piano piece and talked a guitarist through his difficulties in
finishing his piece's lyrics.
For those of us in the audience with whom Spalding

couldn't work person
ally, she recommend
ed collaboration.
"One of the
good things about liv
ing on a planet with,
like, eight billion peo
ple on it, is you don't
have to do everything
by yourself," she said.
"Art is meant to be
out and shared."
Spalding's off
hand comment can be
expanded to the
whole workshop
series. Art isn't just
musicians performing
on the stage of
Memorial
Auditorium. By creat
ing a forum for
Stanford musicians to

collaborate and learn together, SOCA and Lively Arts are
encouraging us to share our music and expand our art.
Bonus? Admission is free — and the dress code is most def
initely casual.
