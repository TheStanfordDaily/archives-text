## Editorial ASSU must reign in campaign spending 
### 
Last Tuesday, the ASSU Undergraduate
Senate voted down an election reform
bill that would have limited campaign
expenditures to $ 1.500 per candidate or exec
utive slate. While the Graduate Student
( ouncil ((iS(') passed a version of the bill on
I eh. IK with almost unanimous support,con
cerns over enforcement caused the same
measure to fail in the Senate by a margin of 9-
3. A second elections reform bill fared better
than the spending limit bill, as undergraduate
senators passed a measure that reimburses
executive slate campaign costs up to $750.
While the editorial board acknowledges
that it will be a challenge to reform and en
force campus campaign spending, we dis
agree with the Senate's decision to reject a
spending cap for campaigns. There should be
a limit on the amount of money students are
allowed to spend on a bid for election.
('ampaign spending is out of control. Just
hist year, ASSU President Jonny Dorsey '09
and his running mate. Pagan I larris *09, spent
more than $3,500 on their campaign —about
two dollars for every vote they received. Un
controlled spending on campaigns will favor
the personally wealthy, and makes it difficult
for some highly qualified candidates to run a
formidable campaign if they lack the re
sources.
ASSU elections should not be a bidding
process that allows some students to buy a po
sition in student government. Rather, it
should be a process where students can hear
from all candidates and pick the best one
based on their ideas. I he editorial board ap
plauds the efforts ol Dorsey and Harris in
pushing for legislation to reign in election
spending.
Many colleges and universities— includ
ing Claremont McKenna. Yale and Harvard
already have spending caps on elections
that range from $40 to more than $400 per
candidate. Stanford should follow suit in time
for the 2009 election cycle by putting rules in
place to keep students' campaign pocket
books in check. The spending cap ought to be

compatible with ASSU election policies,
which place restrictions on the quantity and
timing of fliers, signs and emails disseminated
by candidates during the campaign.
It goes without saying that the spending
limit should not be arbitrary. But what is sig
nificant about the $1,500 mark? $1500 seems
extravagant when students at schools such as
Claremont McKenna are running successful
campaigns on a $40 budget. Stanford may
have more students and a larger campus, but
the Senate should work closely with the
ASSI I I lections Commission to formulate a
dollar amount that makes sense and takes
into account the volume of campaign materi
als candidates are allowed to generate.
A monetary cap does not represent an at
tempt to stifle candidates' free speech, but
rather an opportunity to exercise fiscal re
sponsibility and creativity. With less money to
spend, candidates will be forced to develop
creative measures to get their message across
rather than the traditional fliering of rest
rooms and handing out of T-shirts. The Elec
tions ("ommission should enforce the spend
ing limit bv requiring candidates to submit ex
tensive financial disclosures. Legislative can
didates and executive slates that either ex
ceed the dollar limit or fail to adequately re
port expenditures should be summarily dis
qualified.
l inally, the editorial board commends the
C JSC' and Undergraduate Senate for approv
ing a public financing bill. The $750 reim
bursement guarantee marks a solid first step
toward leveling the socioeconomic playing
field when it conies to campus elections, that
being said, the board believes that the GSC.
Undergraduate Senate and ASSU Execu
tives owe the student body an explanation for
why this sum of money was selected. Students
deserve to know how their tuition is being
spent. With greater transparency and new
spending limits. Stanford's student govern
ment has a chance to set a good example by
promoting fiscal responsibility throughout
the I niversitv as ;i w hole.
