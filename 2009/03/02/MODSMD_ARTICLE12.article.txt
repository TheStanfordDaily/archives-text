## Fraiche, the great campus unifier 
### 
Since Fraiche arrived at our campus in
late January, it has been a pleasant sight
in an area of campus blighted by the eat
ing travesties known as the Axe and Palm
and Tresidder Union. Despite my general ap
proval of Fraiche, however. I refused to eat
there for quite some time.
I have never particularly liked frozen yo
gurt. Add that to my general aversion to yup
pie pseudo-environmental consumerism and
we have a recipe for stringent aversion. If 1
didn't jump on the Obama bandwagon until
after the primaries. I certainly couldn't sur
render in a month to the admittedly tastv
looking swirled towers of white yogurt cov
ered in strawberries.To me. it seemed like an
other commoditization of what was once a
lower-end treat into a "yupster" (yuppie +
hipster) status symbol.
And yet I found mvself.on this past Friday
night, requesting a friend of mine that she
take me to Fraiche (which, to its credit, is
open far more often than anything else on
campus) and "order me something tasty." 1
did not want to sound un-initiated, of course,
and did not want to repeat my most recent
encounter with eateries of Fraiche's ilk. like
Sprinkles Cupcakes at the Stanford Shop
ping Center. Fhere. I misguidedly ordered a
strawberry cupcake, which was awful. (The
chocolate cupcake I also had. though, was de
licious.)
The "natural" yogurt I had with blueber

ries and wildflower was quite unlike any
frozen yogurt I have had before, tangy and
lighter. It was,against my better instincts.quite
delicious. There go the rest of my Cardinal
Points for the quarter. But the real reason why
I like Fraiche is not due to its very scrumptious
blueberries and cutesy aesthetic.
Fraiche is the great campus unifier that we
have never had before. I have walked by the
place often, and the lines were always im
pressive not only for their length, but for the
variation in the people. Nowhere else at
Stanford do you see Ugg-booted sorority
girls, sweatshirted athletes, V-necked hip
sters. bleary-eyed graduate students and
Stanford-'T-shirted freshmen all in line to
gether for something.
Every other campus hangout, it seems,
caters only to certain demographies at Stan
ford. The be-sweatered humanities majors
people-watch at Moonbean's and pretend to
work on their black Macßooks. The fresh
men eat at the Axe and Palm. The techie
study groups along with the empty-fridged

Mirrielees residents are at the CoHo.The all
male packs of sports fans consume their bur
ritos and pizza slices at the Treehouse.
Provost Etchemendy. for his part.seems to be
an Olive's loyalist. "ITie clientele at Cantor
Arts Center cafe seems to be exclusively
middle-aged intellectuals from central and
eastern Europe.
But Fraiche is different. Everyone goes
there, and I hope that trend continues. This,
unfortunately, is a campus where students
can self-select into a certain demographic,
live in certain residences (not only Greek
houses) and go days without being near any
one unlike them. Maybe Fraiche will lead to
a deeper common basis for students to relate
now that the Obama campaign is over. We
can talk about whether we prefer strawber
ries or blueberries, whether we prefer the
wildtlower or the agave honey. Maybe, just
maybe, this discussion will lead to more sub
stantive discussion among different groups
of students on issues that are rarely dis
cussed.
And maybe 1 can go somewhere for my
snacks and avoid the people-watching kill
zone that is the space between Green and
Mever.
