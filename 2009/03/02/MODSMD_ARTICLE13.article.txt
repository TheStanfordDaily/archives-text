# Pith and Pleonasm
## Matt Gillespie Contort your way to enlightenment 
### 
I"'ve been doing a lot of yoga lately.and I've
got to say. it's been glorious.
Specifically. I've been doing Vinyasa yoga,
which (iregor Maehle defines as:"Sequential
movement that interlinks postures to form a
continuous flow. It creates a movement med
itation that reveals all forms as being imper
manent and for this reason are not held on
to." (iregor Maehle. in addition to being so
enlightened that he gets to end a sentence
with a preposition, can literally say anything
he wants, and we interpret it as brilliant just
because he can hold all three kinds ol splits
for hours and can probably also do tongue
pushups.
In Vinyasa. the heat is cranked to around
110 degrees Fahrenheit. You're pouring out
sweat and toxins and spiritual impurities be
fore the instructor even runs through her first
series of animal poses That's a word they toss
around a lot "purity," as in purify your
body, purify your mind, purify your soul
so much, in fact, that by the time class is over,
you're probably expected to be a virgin again
(except for the Menlo Mom with the ('hinese
character lower-back tattoo who's wearing
her daughter's spandex absolutely no one
expects this of her).
Now believe me. I know that yoga, with its
hilarious chants, obnoxious lingo and dubi
ously spiritual WASP clientele, is a pretty
easy target for a smart aleck kid with a news
paper column that reaches five to six readers
a week. What I'm really doing here is what all
good Stanford students do when they aren't
good at something: mocking it in public to de
flect the sting of my own failure. I he sad truth
about me is that I am an awful, awful yoga
practitioner, lust terrible. My typical 90-
minutc class goes something like this:
■ lor the first 10 minutes, my eyes dart nerv
ously around the room as I try to remember
what each of the animal pose names corre
spond to. and I then proceed to desecrate
them so badly that poor (iregor Maehle. il he
were dead, would roll over in his grave.
■ I he next 20 minutes or so are dominated by
a false sense of security- the poses here
aren't too difficult, and while I know I'm not
matching up to the golden-boy Stretch Arm
strong in front ol me in any aspect ol mas
culinity. I feel like I'm holding my own llus
confidence.of'course, will be shattered by ...
■ I he next 20 minutes, also known as the Wet
Season, are when I become acutely aware ol

how ungodly hot the room is. At some point
she begins a sentence with, "II your hand
stand practice here is strong ..." and imme
diately every pair of legs in the room shoots
into the air. splits open and looks like heli
copter blades. It's horrifying. Meanwhile, I
cease sweating, and my clothes, which are
now saturated, begin sweating themselves.
■ From minutes 50-75,1 simply black out.
■ Now. the last 15 minutes are where the
magic happens. In yoga, you get to say and
believe metaphysical nonsense all the time
end any sentence with openness, center,
puritv or completeness, and a whole room full
of the most heavily muscled and least well
read philosophers you have ever met will all
nod in assent. We go through a series of "re
gressions." where we assume increasingly
submissive poses. At the end of the regres
sion, I'm curled into the fetal position and
weeping for the last shards of my dignity,
which I had lost only moments ago when I
yelped like a schoolgirl as the instructor tried
to extend my back. Class ends, and I feel
buried in shame.
As I hear the chatter around me exec
utives talking about what deals went down
today.over-caffeinated parents talking about
the latest playing time travesty on their kid's
traveling soccer team. I start to wonder: Is
this all just another outgrowth ol the ever
present upper-niiddlc-class search for mean
ing. manifesting itselt as a completely artifi
eial spiritual experience that's in fact little
more than pay ing $I<S to a fly b\ night con
tortionist who tells us we'll find nirvana once
we can interlock our toes behind our heads'.'
These doubts, though, are soon chased
from my mind and replaced bv a different re
alization: I feel absolutely unstoppable. It's
escapism for sure, but the hell i! it isn't con
structive escapism. In a world that demands
we strive, achieve and succeed at all costs,
what's wrong with the occasional sweat
drenched awakening ol the soul, even if it is
pretty embarrassing to perform sacred Mud
dlust chants with complete yuppie strangers
before we go back out into the world to ruth
lessly dominate all facets ol life'.'
Whatever at least I'm not cheating on a
test, skipping an important job interview or
shootinu heroin.
