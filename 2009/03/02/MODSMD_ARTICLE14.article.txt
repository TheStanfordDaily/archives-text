## Sweat-free is about creating choices for workers 
### 
We thank the editorial board for its
support of the Sweat-Free Stanford
Campaign ("Sweat-Free Week
should not he debate-free," Feb. 25,2009). We
would like to address the board's concerns
regarding the role of sweatshops in providing
economic opportunities in developing coun
tries. particularly the article they cite by
Nicholas Kristof.
Kristof mistakenly uses the term "sweat
shop" throughout his piece as another way to
refer hi garment factories. I lowever.a sweat
shop is not the same as a factory, and to be
"anti-sweatshop" is not to be against manu
facturing. Rather, to be anti-sweatshop, or
"sweat-free," is to be against poor working
conditions within the garment industry.
Sweatshops are defined by abusive condi
tions such as forced overtime.discrimination,
sexual harassment, hazardous working envi
ronments. union-busting and poverty wages.
Currently most factories are sweatshops,
but it is possible for factories to be "sweat
tree" by providing a local living wage, the
right to unionize, freedom from harassment
and intimidation and a safe working environ
ment. American Apparel, for instance, does
n't quite meet the standard of "sweat-free"
because ol its past union-busting activities,
but it is better than manv other manufactur

ers because it provides a living wage for
workers. Likewise, Knights Apparel is work
ing on building two model sweat-free facto
ries in the Dominican Republic to attract the
college market.
For pundits like Kristof, the attraction of
framing everything in terms of "choice" is all
too irresistible. Kristofs argument is that
people mired in poverty would undoubtedly
choose sweatshops over starvation, and the
sweatshop debate should end there. But the
unstated premise here is breathtakingly
naive: that extreme destitution is purely one
"choice" among many, when in reality it is no
choice at all.
The Sweat-Free Stanford Coalition is not
against manufacturing in the U.S. or in other
countries — we agree that manufacturing
creates jobs — but we believe that the big
corporations reaping the most profit from
the industry can and should take more re
sponsibility tor working conditions in their
factories.
Where does that leave us. at Stanford?
The Designated Suppliers Program (DSP)
incorporates the Basic Needs approach into
the global garment industr\ b\ requiring fac
tories to be certified sweat-free before they
can tap into the university apparel market.
Under the DSP. universities have guaranteed

three-year contracts with these factories,
which is good lor universities because it en
sures that collegiate apparel is made in
sweat-free conditions. This benefits workers
because it protects their right to unionize and
create better working conditions, and also
benefits factories because it guarantees them
long-term orders in a notoriously unpre
dictable industry.
The Sweat-Free Coalition and kristof
agree that poverty and had working condi
tions are not good for anyone, but we think
that inaction is not a solution. We believe the
DSP is a great answer to the issues Kristof
raises, and 45 other universities — including
Columbia. Duke and the entire UC system
agree. The goal of Sweat-Free Week is to
encourage Stanford to join these prestigious
universities in reshaping the garment indus
try to provide a real choice for workers.
