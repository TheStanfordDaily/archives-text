### ERIK ADAMS DESK EDITOR

to advance to the College World Series.This year, the
annual early-season meeting went differently.
No. 14 Stanford pitched well but couldn't muster
much of an offense against the No. 7 Titans. As a re
sult. Fullerton sandwiched blowout victories around
a less-dominating 3-2 win on Saturday.
"I think we are coming together offensively," said
Stanford sophomore closer Drew Storen. "Hits just
haven't been falling for us right now, but the guys are
going to step up. and the runs will come eventually."
At one point. Stanford went without a run for 14
innings over the first two games of the series.
"We need to swing the bats better," head coach
Mark Marquess said." We haven't put much pressure
on any of our opponents in any of our games, and
hopefully we can start pushing over more runs."
With the sweep. Fullerton advanced its record to
4-2, while Stanford fell to 2-4 on the season.
Friday: Stanford 1, Cal State-Fullerton 8

nings. Inman appeared on his way to making a 1-0
lead stand-up at the start of the sixth. But. without
hitting the ball out of the infield on the fly. Fullerton
pushed across four runs to take back the lead and
end Inman's night.
Sophomore Danny Sandbrink — who was
bumped from the rotation this weekend in favor of
freshman Brett Mooneyham — went to the mound
in the seventh trying to hold the score at 4-1. but only
got one batter out before loading the bases in front
of'Jared Clark. Clark tipped a foul with his first mas
sive swing, and connected on his second, crushing a
grand slam well over the scoreboard in left field.
Meanwhile, Titan pitcher Daniel Renken struck
out seven, walked none and allowed only a single run
in seven innings to get the win. Senior Joey August
had a pair of hits for Stanford, sophomore Jonathan
Kaskow added a RBI single, and sophomore Jake
Schlander hit the ball very sharply three times.
Saturday: Stanford 2, Cal State-Fullerton 3

starter and struggled with control in the first inning,
walking three and allowing three runs to score on
just a pair of singles. But. he hit his stride after that
and shut the Titans down over the next four innings.
"After the first inning, [Mooneyham) did a real
good job." Marquess said. "He threw a lot of strikes
and controlled the running game well, which is very
tough to do against [Fullerton]."
