## 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY MANAGING EDITOR 
For the first time this year, Stanford sits alone atop the
Pac-10.
Entering the weekend, the Cardinal was tied for first in
the conference with Cal. but after the Golden Bears' loss
to UCLA and Stanford's sweep of the Los Angeles
schools, the Cardinal is on the brink of its ninth straight
regular-season Pac-1 () championship.
Just a year after being swept in Southern California.
Stanford rode the play of sophomore forward Kayla Ped
ersen to two hard-fought victories over UCLA. 69-58. on
Friday and USC. K5-74. on Sunday. Pedersen scored 20
points in both games and totaled 17 rebounds on the week
end.
"I've been working really hard, and 1 think shots just fi
nally started to fall." she said."l felt really good."
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer agreed, pleased to see
another player step up after weeks of dominance by junior
center Jayne Appel.
"Kayla had a fabulous weekend." VanDerveer said.
"She should be our nomination for Player of the Week.
[She was| making shots, doing what we needed her to do
defensively, and she stayed in the game for nearly 40 min
utes."

GAME NOTES; The Cardinal's win against U5C placed Stanford alone
atop the Pac-10 for the first time this season. The Card has won 12
consecutive meetings with Arizona, including a 70-61 victory over the
Wildcats on Jan. 4
10-1 run to create a little bit of separation, and held a 33-
28 lead going into the locker room. Stanford started
strong after the break, outscoring UCLA 12-5 over the
first three minutes to create a double-digit advantage.
The Cardinal did not acquiesce from there — the Bruins
could only momentarily bring the deficit into single fig
ures, as Stanford was able to maintain its lead throughout

the latter part of the game.
Pedersen and fellow classmate
Jeanette Pohlen led the Cardinal at
tack with a combined seven three
pointers on 70 percent shooting from
behind the arc. Appel was held to 10
points, but she led Stanford with five
assists, including two during the Car
dinal's early second-half run.
The moment of the night, though,
belonged to senior Jillian Harmon,
who scored her I.oooth career point
against the Bruins; she's the 2 t )th
Stanford player to do so. Harmon en
tered the game with 992 points and
scored her eighth point on a jumper
early in the second half. It was a cru
cial one at that, giving Stanford its
largest lead yet.
The Bruins refused to break,
though, and the game was not se
cured until just over a minute left,
when VanDerveer took out all five of

her starters. UCLA was led by Darx
ia Norris. who scored IS points off
the bench, a season high for the
sophomore. She was the only Bruin
to tally double figures on the
evening.The Cardinal was dominant
in the post, holding UCLA's starting
forwards to just 13 points on 36 per
cent shooting.
That theme carried over to Sun
day's match-up with the Women of
Troy. Pedersen was once again domi
nant. notching a double-double with
20 points and 10 rebounds, and was
joined in the offensive attack bv
Appel. who scored 20 points of her
own. The duo was complemented by
fellow post player and freshman
Nnemkadi Ogwumike. who scored
18 points — she was the only other
Cardinal player to score in double
figures.
The Women of Troy focused on
stopping Appel early, but that en
abled Stanford's guards to hit
jumpers from outside, forcing USCto
guard all five players on the floor.
"Once people knocked down
some shots, it was easier to get the

hall inside," Pedersen said.
In the hackcourt. Stanford had to
play most of the game without start
ing point guard Pohlen. She left the
game after being hit in the eye. did
not return from the locker room until
the second half had already started,
and never returned to play. With jun
ior .IJ 1 Jones already out for the year
with a torn ACL. VanDerveer was
forced to use freshman Lindy
Laßocque and redshirt sophomore
Melanie Murphy at the point for the
second half. Murphy and Laßocque
combined for seven assists.
"I thought this was really an inter
esting challenge for us to play with
out Jeanette." VanDerveer said.
"When you take away .IJ. then
Jeanette. I think this is a great win for
us without Jeanette because she is so
important to our team. I thought
Lindy stepped up and did a really
nice job for us. She hit some big bas
kets and stie really ran the floor for us
really well."
With the wins. Stanford is now two
games away from winning the Pac-10
regular-season championship, if it

can emerge victorious over the Ari
zona schools at Maples later this
week.
But the team refuses to take any
thing for granted.
"Whether [Cal] wins or loses, it
doesn't make us better," VanDerveer

said. "The best thing we can do is stay
healthy and keep improving."
Pedersen echoed her coach's
thoughts.
"It doesn't matter to us: we have
the Ari/onas next and that's all we're
looking at." she said. "Our No. 1 goal

is to win the Pac-10 Tournament and
then go on from there. Its great that
we're on top. but now we have to stay
