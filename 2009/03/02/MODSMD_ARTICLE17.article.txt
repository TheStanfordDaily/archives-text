# WOMEN'S SWIMMING
## Card sets records at Pac-1 Os Smit and Breeden set individual records at conference champs 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
The Stanford women's swimming and diving team
wasn't able to secure a team win at the 2(KW Pac-10
C hampionships.but that didn't stop individuals from per
forming at an historic level.
Ihe No. 2 Cardinal finished third in last week's four
day meet, just behind Arizona and Cal in the final stand
ings with 1,317 points. Despite ending the regular season
with an undefeated record and with 19 straight dual
match victories over Pac-10 competition, Stanford had an
uncharacteristically sluggish start, when the 2(X)-meter
medley relay team was disqualified in the opening event.
Ihe rest of the opening day of competition was un

eventful for Stanford.The only standout moment was the
settingof a school record by the 8(X)-meter freestyle relay
team, smashing the previous mark by 3.7 seconds with a
time of 7:(K).2Â«5. Although this performance was enough
to rewrite history, the relay swimmers fell short of clinch
ing a first-place finish.touching after Cal's NCAA-record
6:56.87 finish.
A lackluster beginning proved to be just a little rusti
ness, though, as the following three days for the Cardinal
were exceptional, highlighted by school. Pac-1(), NCAA
and even American records.
The second day of competition belonged to Stanford
junior Julia Snut. Smit. a 200 X Beijing ()lympic medalist,
dazzled the crowd in Washington with her winning effort
in the 2(X)-meter individual medley. Her time of 1:53.11
set an American. U.S. Open and NCAA record for the
event. Teammate and fellow Olympian junior Hlaine
Breeden finished second in the event with a time of
-1:54.32.
"Tonight was a great race for Julia
and the team," Stanford head coach
Lea Maurer told GoStanford.com.
"Both Julia and Elaine Breeden feel a
huge motivation to help lilt up and in
spire the team, and they felt the 2(H)
1M was a great chance to start build
ing momentum."
Stanford continued to swim well,
scoring five swimmers in the 500-
meter freestyle and four swimmers in
the 50-meter freestyle.The team's ef
fort was enough to catapult it into
third place in the standings after two
days of competition.
Smit. Breeden and the Cardinal
picked up right where they left off on
the third day of the Championships.
The team's veteran stars stood out
once again with hack-to-back Pac-10
titles.
Smit kicked things off by setting

an NCAA record in the 400-meter in
dividual medley with a superb time of
4:01:56. She was followed by Breeden
who set a school record in the 100-
meter butterfly with a time of 50.87.
Stanford remained behind Ari
zona and Cal as the third day drew to
a close, but hoped to work some
magic in the final day of competition.
Breeden saved her best for last,
setting an American, U.S. Open and
NCAA record in the 200-meter but
terfly with a time of 1:49.92; the victo
ry marked Breeden's third consecu
tive Pac-10 Championship in the
event stemming back to her freshman
year. Her performance topped the
NCAA record of 1:51.91, which was
set by Natalie Coughlin of Cal in 2002.
"Elaine's effort today was out
standing." Maurer said. "We'll put her
right back to work, as this is definitely
a swim we can build on for NCAAs."
Stanford diving, led by junior Car
men Stellar, also had a fantastic show
ing. Stellar won her first career Pac-10
Championship by clinching the plat
form title with a score of 257.55, im
proving upon her career best by near

ly 45 points. For her efforts, she was
named Diver of the Meet.
"We are thrilled for Carmen, and
she was very deserving of Diver of the
Meet honors," Maurer said. "All of
our divers were sensational during
the entire meet."
As a whole, the Cardinal had a
very good showing at Pac-lOs. The
team had six NCAA "A" qualifying
scores and nine "B" scores in addition
to the aforementioned feats of Bree
den and Smit.
"We are pretty happy with the way
things turned out overall," Maurer
said."We struggled with some injuries
this year, and we knew the writing was
on the wall a bit in that we didn't have
as many healthy bodies. Overall, we
feel with the number of (NCAA)
qualifiers we have, that we are in a
good position to have a real good
meet at the NCAAs."
NCAA Championships are, in
deed. the next step for the Cardinal,
which begin Mar. 19.
