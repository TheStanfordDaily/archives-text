# Dawkins' real struggles start after March
## 
### 
It was a good night to he a fan of
Stanford basketball — an occur
rence that has been all too rare of
late in 2(X)9. But the team's dra
matic comeback win over the Trojans
in its final home game of the season,
led by a cadre of seniors on a night to
honor their contributions, was truly :i
sight to behold.
For a brief second, one couldn't
help but feel that maybe this team
does have something left in the tank
for a stretch run into the conference
tournament. A hope that maybe.just
maybe, anything is possible — and
not just for the Boston Celtics
(thanks for ruining that phrase. k( i).
But really, I'm not here to talk
about that. As nice as a magical run
into the postseason would be and

as a sports fan in my final year at
Stanford. I can tell you it would be
glorious — it wouldn't really impact
the team in the long run. And that's
what I'd like to think this column has
always been about.
It's probably fitting, you see, that
on Senior Night, the Cardinal's great
est flaw was exposed: just who is
going to take over for these guys next
year? To be sure, there was much
wailing and gnashing of teeth at the
departure of the I.ope/ twins and
coach Trent Johnson last year. But
Johnny Dawkins looks to be an excel
lent long-term lit for Stanford, and
the team had the veteran backbone
to be competitive even without the
star power and post presence that
Brook and Robin provided.

But in just a few short weeks, the
2(H)K-2(H) ( ) season will definitely be
over for the ( ardinal. no matter how
much magic Dawkins and his veter
an-heavy roster can scrape together
for one last run. And then the ques
tions will really begin to mount.
I"he Cardinal has definitely been
outmatched on several occasions this
season, and that was with seniors
Lawrence Mill, Mitch Johnson. An
thony Goods and Kenny Brown on
the roster. (loods and I lill have con
sistently led the team in scoring,night
after night. Johnson has emerged to
become a steady team leader at the
point. Kenny Brown, as he demon
strated Saturday against the Trojans.


Denis
Griffin
Rants and Raves
is the kind of shooter every good
team needs to help provide a spark
from off the bench.
All that, next year, will be gone.
And on the surface, at least, it doesn't
look like the Cardinal has waves of
talent coming in to replace it. Coach
Dawkins' only commitment thus far.
according to both Scout.com and Ri
vals.com. is a three-star prospect
from Santa Ana, Calif.: Andy Brown.
The 6-foot-8, 200-pound power for
ward has the frame to potentially
help the Cardinal's post-game signif
icantly. but expecting that kind of
production to come immediately in
the 2009-2010 season is probably un
realistic.
So we're left with the knowledge
that if the men's team is to succeed
next year, a lot will have to go just
right. Freshman Jeremy Green, who
has flashed quickness and a decent
outside shot in the 27 games he's
played in this year, can take over for
Goods at shooting guard. Junior
Landry Fields will need to become
even more of a scoring presence than
he's been this season, averaging 13.4
points per game. And sophomore
forward Josh Owens, who was

thought to be a strong breakout can
didate for 2008-2009 earlier this sea
son. will have to build on the strides
he's made of late and become a
leader for the Cardinal offensively.
If those three guys. Fields, Green
and Owens, maximize their potential,
then maybe the Cardinal can come
back just as strong in 2009-2010. Who
knows, they could even be better in
some ways? But if you haven't gotten
the picture yet, let me spell it out for
you:The stars are really going to have
to align just right on this one. If just
some of those things happen, or none
of them do. well, that's game over be
fore things even really start. In short,
next year could be a very long season
for the Cardinal.
What does all that mean to you.
the Cardinal fan who is going to be
staying on the Farm beyond this
year? Simply this: that you need to
have patience with Dawkins and the
rest of the Cardinal men's hoops pro
gram. It's traditional for fans to write
off a new coach's first season, espe
cially when his team has lost stars like
Brook and Robin Lopez to the NBA
before he even arrives. It's a kind of
honeymoon period, when most fans
are willing to grant a coach the time
he needs to implement his own sys
tem and restock the roster with his
players.
In this case? It's probably better
for Dawkins if you hold him more ac

countable for this season and write
off 2009-2010. Personally, I'm con
vinced that he's the right guy for this
program, or at the very least, he
brings the right style with him. Ag
gressive defense, plenty of passing
and deadly outside shooting are all
things Dawkins believes in and qual
ities the Cardinal should be able to
acquire or teach, even with the limi
tations on its recruiting.
And in large part. Dawkins had a
roster that fit his vision this year. He
had good shooters in Goods, Hill and
Brown, and his idea for what the Car
dinal's defense should look like has
been progressing. Throw in a little
more athleticism on offense and a
post presence who can grab some re
bounds, and the 2008-2009 Cardinal
is probably exactly what Dawkins
would like his long-term team to look
like. Next season's roster, however,
promises to be a horse of a different
color.
So if you're going to cut Dawkins
some slack for being new on the job
to a team in transition, you might
want to save it for next year — be
cause there's a very good chance
that's when he'll reallv need it.

Denis Griffin is a big believer in taking
a long-term view of a team's future.
Maybe that's because he likes the Gi
ants and 49ers. Contact him at dj
