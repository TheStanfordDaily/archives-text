# Dawkins' real struggles start after March
## 
### 
It was a good night to he a fan of
Stanford basketball — an occur
rence that has been all too rare of
late in 2(X)9. But the team's dra
matic comeback win over the Trojans
in its final home game of the season,
led by a cadre of seniors on a night to
honor their contributions, was truly :i
sight to behold.
For a brief second, one couldn't
help but feel that maybe this team
does have something left in the tank
for a stretch run into the conference
tournament. A hope that maybe.just
maybe, anything is possible — and
not just for the Boston Celtics
(thanks for ruining that phrase. k( i).
But really, I'm not here to talk
about that. As nice as a magical run
into the postseason would be and

as a sports fan in my final year at
Stanford. I can tell you it would be
glorious — it wouldn't really impact
the team in the long run. And that's
what I'd like to think this column has
always been about.
It's probably fitting, you see, that
on Senior Night, the Cardinal's great
est flaw was exposed: just who is
going to take over for these guys next
year? To be sure, there was much
wailing and gnashing of teeth at the
departure of the I.ope/ twins and
coach Trent Johnson last year. But
Johnny Dawkins looks to be an excel
lent long-term lit for Stanford, and
the team had the veteran backbone
to be competitive even without the
star power and post presence that
Brook and Robin provided.

But in just a few short weeks, the
2(H)K-2(H) ( ) season will definitely be
over for the ( ardinal. no matter how
much magic Dawkins and his veter
an-heavy roster can scrape together
for one last run. And then the ques
tions will really begin to mount.
I"he Cardinal has definitely been
outmatched on several occasions this
season, and that was with seniors
Lawrence Mill, Mitch Johnson. An
thony Goods and Kenny Brown on
the roster. (loods and I lill have con
sistently led the team in scoring,night
after night. Johnson has emerged to
become a steady team leader at the
point. Kenny Brown, as he demon
strated Saturday against the Trojans.
