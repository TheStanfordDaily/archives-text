tational in Fullerton, Calif. Next up for the Cardinal is a home game
against Illinois State to open the Stanford Louisville Slugger Classic
on Friday. The Redbirds are coming off a 7-0 victory against South
Carolina.

Huber was an integral part of the Stanford rally,
which started with hack-to-back one-out singles by
sophomores first baseman Melissa Koutzand pinch-hit
ter Brittany Minder. With two on, the Cardinal then got
some help from the Mustang defense. Freshman center
fielder Sarah 1 lassman reached on an error by Cal Poly
third baseman Cristen Lee to load the bases. I laber then
followed with an RBI single bring the Cardinal within
one.
With the pressure building, Lee made her second
error of the inning, trying to double off a runner after
freshman shortstop Ashley I lansen lined out; the error
allowed the tying run to score. Junior second baseman
Shannon Koplit/ then followed with a walk-off infield
single.
Before this down-to-the-wire encounter with the
Mustangs. Stanford had opened the weekend with an
easy 10-1 five-inning victory over Indiana. Sophomore
Ashley C'hinn picked up the victory for the Cardinal in
the circle.The Card was led offensively by 1 lansen. who
went 3 for .1 with three RBk
In its second game Friday, Stanford rolled over yet
another Big Ten opponent. Minnesota.
Senior pitcher Missy Penna was dominant in the 7-0
Cardinal's triumph, going the distance by allowing just
two hits and striking out nine batters.
Stanford jumped out to an early lead, scoring six runs
in the bottom of the first. The biggest blow came off the
bat of freshman third baseman Jenna Becerra. who
knocked a three-run homer - the first ol her career
over the left field fence with two outs.
"Our offense was on this weekend," Penna said.
"When you go out there and you are leading five or six
(to] nothing, if someone gets on base you know in the
back of your mind we have these runs and we will score
more. It is comforting."
The following day, Stanford's offense was hoi again,
as the Cardinal beat UC-Riverside in just five innings,
14-1. Stanford collected Ih hits on the game, including
three apiece for I laber and Koplit/.. Chinn also picked
up her second victory of the weekend.pitching all five in
nings and allowing just one unearned run.
Finally, the Cardinal concluded its stay in southern
California by beating host Cal State Fullerton 7-0 on
Sunday.
In what had become Stanford's winning habit — the
Card scored early — notching two runs in the opening in
ning. I laber scored first on her way to
continuing a torrid start to the season;
she went 3 for 3 in the game, with three
runs scored and a stolen base. The
two-time All American is now hitting
.540. contributing 10 doubles and 27
runs scored, and leads Stanford in al
most every offensive category.
"I have more of a plan when I go
up to bat this season. I pick up on the
pitcher's tendencies. I've also had a

combination of good luck and the
ability to guess the right pitch," she
said.
Meanwhile, Penna pitched a com
plete game shutout against the Titans,
allowing just two hits in the process.
In the game she also recorded her
l(HH)th career strikeout, becoming
the only active pitcher in the nation to
reach this milestone.
