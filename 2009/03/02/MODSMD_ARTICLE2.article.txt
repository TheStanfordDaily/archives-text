This past weekend. Stanford welcomed the parents of
undergraduate students with sunshine and a full schedule of
programming. From student residences to the Bookstore to
the Quad, parents were spotted wearing their red lanyards and
enjoying time with their kids.Though the recession and cuts to
the University budget were hot topics, they didn't dampen the
spirit of the weekend.
In fact.organizers did not even see a decline in the number
of parents who attended. Elaine Enos. executive director of
Stanford Events, said that including student siblings and
grandparents, the total number of Parents' Weekend visitors
neared 3.000 attendees.
"Because of the state of the economy, we thought that we
might ultimately see a significant decline in the number of par
ents attending," Einos said. "However, that was not the case,
which to us was very positive."
The three days of events featured talks with University offi
cials in Memorial Auditorium, receptions at the community
centers, four sessions of "Back to School Classes for Parents"

and an "Entertainment Extravaganza."
On Friday. Provost John Etchemendy welcomed parents to
Stanford with a speech that addressed concerns regarding the
economic downturn and its impact on the University.
"We expect to lose 30 percent [of our endowment],"
Etchemendy said. "Let me explain how jarring this is: the
largest [previous loss] was eight percent in 1974."
Etchemendy explained that, with these losses, the endow
ment would equal its size in 2005.
Regarding next year's 7.25 percent payout rate from the
endowment. Etchemendy expressed concern.
"[The payout rate] actually worries me a little bit. and mo\ -
ing forward we have to think about whether we're comfort
able with that." the Provost said.
Etchemendy reassured parents that the academic goals of
the University will be preserved despite budget cuts.
"It's my guess that when all is said and done, your children
will only feel the slightest impact from these cuts." he said.
" Hie changes will not have a meaningful effect on their under
grad experience â€” that's our goal."
