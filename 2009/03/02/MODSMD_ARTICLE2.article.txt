## More than 3,000 attendees despite economic recession 
### LIZ STARK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This past weekend. Stanford welcomed the parents of
undergraduate students with sunshine and a full schedule of
programming. From student residences to the Bookstore to
the Quad, parents were spotted wearing their red lanyards and
enjoying time with their kids.Though the recession and cuts to
the University budget were hot topics, they didn't dampen the
spirit of the weekend.
In fact.organizers did not even see a decline in the number
of parents who attended. Elaine Enos. executive director of
Stanford Events, said that including student siblings and
grandparents, the total number of Parents' Weekend visitors
neared 3.000 attendees.
"Because of the state of the economy, we thought that we
might ultimately see a significant decline in the number of par
ents attending," Einos said. "However, that was not the case,
which to us was very positive."
The three days of events featured talks with University offi
cials in Memorial Auditorium, receptions at the community
centers, four sessions of "Back to School Classes for Parents"

and an "Entertainment Extravaganza."
On Friday. Provost John Etchemendy welcomed parents to
Stanford with a speech that addressed concerns regarding the
economic downturn and its impact on the University.
"We expect to lose 30 percent [of our endowment],"
Etchemendy said. "Let me explain how jarring this is: the
largest [previous loss] was eight percent in 1974."
Etchemendy explained that, with these losses, the endow
ment would equal its size in 2005.
Regarding next year's 7.25 percent payout rate from the
endowment. Etchemendy expressed concern.
"[The payout rate] actually worries me a little bit. and mo\ -
ing forward we have to think about whether we're comfort
able with that." the Provost said.
Etchemendy reassured parents that the academic goals of
the University will be preserved despite budget cuts.
"It's my guess that when all is said and done, your children
will only feel the slightest impact from these cuts." he said.
" Hie changes will not have a meaningful effect on their under
grad experience — that's our goal."

Parents meet students at a reception at Arrillaga Alumni Center. The three-day event included question
and-answer sessions with University officials, classes and an entertainment extravaganza.
Etchemendy also addressed three
main concerns — housing, student
health and security — from a recent
online parent survey that received
2.5(H) responses. He outlined policy
changes in those areas.such as the new
Draw system and an increase in the
number of on-campus therapists.
Other talks included a question
and-answer session with President
John 1 lennessy and conversations for
the parents of freshmen, of sopho
mores, and of juniors and seniors with
various University administrators.
Parents enjoyed the many simulat
ed lectures offered by University pro
fessors such as I listory Prof. David
Kennedy and even by the members of
Stanford Taiko.
"We found again this year that par

ents really enjoy seeing the actual ac
ademic work students are doing,"
Enos said. "I even met a parent who
flew in from the East Coast just to
come to the weekend's activities and
classes, even though her student was
away on the Stanford Overseas Study
1 Program. She wanted to experience
t the University as a student herself
I once again and said she was loving it."
Joanne and Ken Kauvar, parents
of Isaac Kauvar '12. spoke with The
Daily after attending a showing of the
UNAFF film "Missing in Tibet."
"TheTibet movie lecture showed a
l mix of the film as well as the profes
r sor's approach to the class," Joanne
said. "Sitting in on that was not a con
-1 ventional academic experience."
The Kauvars also attended their
son's classes.
"We enjoyed getting a sense of
I who his teachers and who his class
f mates are." Joanne said.
Both parents were pleased with
the organization of the weekend.

"(It's been] very efficient, very
well-organized, and everything that
we've attended is quite impressive,"
Joanne said.
"Our kids went to other schools
and the other schools were good,"
Ken added."but this is great."
The Kauvars looked forward to at
tending the reception in their son's all
freshman dorm and meeting his
friends.
"Move-in and Parents' Weekend is
about the only chance you have to
meet your own child's friends and
their parents until graduation."
Joanne said.
Allen and Maryanne Merritt. par
ents of Brvce Merritt '09, were veter
ans of Parents' Weekend but returned
this year to visit their son.
"There's much better weather this
year than last." Allen said. "This is a
wonderful place."
In addition to attending one Back
to School class and the USC basket
ball game on Saturday, the Merritts
wanted to "try to spend as much time
with our son as possible," Allen said.
"We've been in past years to talks,
and those are helpful, but this year we
wanted to focus on our son's accom
plishments and to fit his schedule."
Allen added.
Even some grandparents, such as J.
Fred Weintz *48. grandfather of Jake
Serf'l2. and his wife Rosemary Ross-
Weintz.came for the weekend.
Weintz. an alumnus of Stanford's
Board of Trustees and Goldman
Sachs, described Etchemendy'stalk as
"very interesting."
"They will survive this." Weintz
said. Weintz. whose ringtone is the
Stanford Band playing "All Right
Now." said he has seen many positive
changes since his children attended
Stanford.
"1 really like the way you just get
the feeling that everybody's pulling
the same direction here." Weintz said.
"(Former President! Gerhard Casper
initiated a lot of things to focus on un
dergrad education and also increased
the class [of'oB. etc.] feeling of the stu
dents."
All parents relished the opportuni
ty to get a better understanding of
their children's everyday lives.
"You get to feel that you're part of
the whole thing." Ross-Weintz said.
"Otherwise, you sort of give money,
but you don't have the feeling of what
their day-to-day life is like once
you've been in the cafeteria."
John and l.isa Counts, parents of
lan Counts'l2 felt the same.
"We sat in front of the Bookstore,
and that's when we really got a flavor
of life here." John said. "Students wel
comed us to Stanford at the parking
lot. and that was a very nice touch."
" ITie best part is seeing your kid."
