### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The troubled economy hasn't affected Stanford stu
dents' philanthropy — sororities and fraternities report
that their recent charity events have been as successful as
last year's efforts, if not more.
On Feb. 21. the second annual Charity Dodgeball
tournament brought in over $1,000 for the Make-A-Wish
foundation. The event hosted by Sigma Nu and Chi
()mega. asked participants to contribute $10 each towards
the foundation's goal of granting wishes to young children
in the linited States.
According to current Sigma Nu member Jay de la Torre
'10. the tournament attracted IS teams of dodgeball enthu
siasts. Participants had the opportunity to win Pac-10 bas
ketball tickets in return for their participation.

"Last year we raised around $7(K)." de la Torre said.
"This year, surprisingly... we were able to raise even
more money."
I .auren Swart/ '11, assistant community service director
for Chi Omega, also expressed satisfaction with this year's
turnout. As a chapter, the sorority sponsors the Make-A-
Wish Foundation as its national philanthropy organization.
"We didn't really have any expenditure costs, and all of
our profits went directly to the Make-A-Wish
Foundation," Swart/ said.
Similarly.Tri Delt experienced a relatively large turnout
for its charity brunch, also on Feb. 21. Katie White " 11 said
that over 300 people made an appearance.
"There was a pretty big turnout, and we ran out of
food." the Tri Delt member said. "We raised over $2,000
[and] we're still collecting money from people for it."
While the function did garner a large sum of monev

from the Stanford community. White noticed that it was
much more difficult to convince local businesses to help
out.
"We collect donations from restaurants and Safeway in
order to keep the cost down for the event — that was pret
ty hard to get," White said. "Businesses were less willing to
donate and we had to bother them more."
With the fundraising season well underway, Tri Delt,
Chi Omega and Sigma Nu are all planning future charity
functions.
"Every year, we usually have a big event called Safeway
Sleep Out," de la Torre said. "Fraternity members in
groups of two for two hours each group stand outside
Safeway and collect food donations for Second Harvest
Food Bank."
