## 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The troubled economy hasn't affected Stanford stu
dents' philanthropy — sororities and fraternities report
that their recent charity events have been as successful as
last year's efforts, if not more.
On Feb. 21. the second annual Charity Dodgeball
tournament brought in over $1,000 for the Make-A-Wish
foundation. The event hosted by Sigma Nu and Chi
()mega. asked participants to contribute $10 each towards
the foundation's goal of granting wishes to young children
in the linited States.
According to current Sigma Nu member Jay de la Torre
'10. the tournament attracted IS teams of dodgeball enthu
siasts. Participants had the opportunity to win Pac-10 bas
ketball tickets in return for their participation.

"Last year we raised around $7(K)." de la Torre said.
"This year, surprisingly... we were able to raise even
more money."
I .auren Swart/ '11, assistant community service director
for Chi Omega, also expressed satisfaction with this year's
turnout. As a chapter, the sorority sponsors the Make-A-
Wish Foundation as its national philanthropy organization.
"We didn't really have any expenditure costs, and all of
our profits went directly to the Make-A-Wish
Foundation," Swart/ said.
Similarly.Tri Delt experienced a relatively large turnout
for its charity brunch, also on Feb. 21. Katie White " 11 said
that over 300 people made an appearance.
"There was a pretty big turnout, and we ran out of
food." the Tri Delt member said. "We raised over $2,000
[and] we're still collecting money from people for it."
While the function did garner a large sum of monev

from the Stanford community. White noticed that it was
much more difficult to convince local businesses to help
out.
"We collect donations from restaurants and Safeway in
order to keep the cost down for the event — that was pret
ty hard to get." White said. "Businesses were less willing to
donate and we had lo bother them more."
With the lundraising season well underway, Tri Delt.
C hi Omega and Sigma Nu are all planning future charity
functions.
"I very year, we usuall) have a big event called Safeway
Sleep Out." de la Torre said. "Fraternity members in
groups of two for two hours each group stand outside
Safewav and collect food donations for Second Harvest
Food Bank."
Since last fall's event raised over
20(H) pounds worth of food, the fra
ternity hopes to hold the event again
in the near future,although the exact
date remains undetermined.
"We've been doing it for 10 years,
so it's probably safe to say that we're
going to do it again soon."de la Torre
said.
White said that Tri Delt plans to
hold a car wash this coming spring.
The charity event, aptly named the
Delta Bubble, is intended to raise
money for St. Jude Children's Re
search 1 iospital.
According to Adriana Chou,
community service director for Chi
Omega, the sorority hopes to contin
ue its involvement with Rebuilding
Together next quarter.
"Wo essentially gather girls to
help rebuild homes in local commu
nities. and that's been a rewarding
experience," Swart/ explained.
"With the economic recession,
hands-on work — which is the most
beneficial of all — can be the easiest
and most accessible."
Chou added that Chi Omega also
plans to do beach clean-ups, tutoring
and other activities that do not re
quire much funding.
And although past charity events
have proven successful, the future
remains uncertain.
"I think you have to be creative to
get people to come out. especially
since money is harder to come by
nowadays,"de la Torre stated. "Hut I
also think that people are pretty al
truistic and are looking to do good
things and have a good time, so if you
can find a great mix of doing both
then you can still probably have a
successful event."
