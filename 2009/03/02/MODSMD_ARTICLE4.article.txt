## SENIORS STOP TROJANS Seniors lift Card in final home game 
### DENIS GRIFFIN DESK EDITOR 
It took far longer than the ('artlinal. its
coaches or its fans would have liked, but
a home win over USC has. at long last,
assured Stanford men's basketball that
the 2008-2009 season won't be its first los

After enduring a four-game losing
streak, the Cardinal men rebounded with
a 75-63 triumph over the Trojans (16-12.
7-9 Pacific-10 Conference), bringing the
team's record to 16-1 I and its conference
mark to 5-11. Hut perhaps more impor

team a measure ol much-needed momen

has just two regular-season games

or at least in the second half we did. I
think we need to just sustain that effort
for 40 minutes, and then (we'll] make
some things happen."
