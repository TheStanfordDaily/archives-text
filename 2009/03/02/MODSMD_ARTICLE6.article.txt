### AMY HARRIS CONTRIBUTING WRITER

ended the fiscal year as the top fundraising university
in the country.

tions. according to the annual Voluntary Support ol

Council for Aid to Education. Hie I niversity raised
$135 million more than Harvard, which was second
on the VSI list with $650 million.

rhe $7<S5 million given in
2<X>N represents the third
best overall fundraising
year in Stanford's history,
surpassed onlv b\ the

$N32 million raised in
2(K)7 and Stanford's

peak fundraising
year ol 2tX)6.
when the univer
sity received $ l M 1
million.

Martin Shell, vice presi
dent for development at
Stanford, attributed Stanford's
success to its capital campaigns.

200N marked the midpoint of The
Stanford Challenge, the multi-year
capital campaign announced by
President John Hennessy in October
2006 that seeks to raise $4.3 billion
over the course of five years.
"Response to The Stanford
Challenge has been nothing short of
remarkable." Shell said.
()f the $7<N5 million received, indi
viduals— alumni, friends and non
alumni parents — donated $593.2
million, foundations provided $142.6
million and corporate gilts totaled
$49.2 million.
The nearh 112.0(H) gifts Stanford
received in 2(K)«S will be allocated
based on donor designation into

annual expendable programs, con
struction projects, faculty positions,
research programs and endowed
funds. For example. Shell said. $50
million was earmarked for annual
expendable programs like The
Stanford Fund, the giving program
that supports undergraduate educa
tion. line overall division of 2(K)S
donations was $437.5 million for
expendable support (including annu
al funds, research and facilities) and
$347.5 million for endowed funds
(including scholarships and financial
aid).
Though they were the best in the
nation, the 2(X)8 numbers mark a 5.7
percent decline from the $K32 million
received by Stanford in 2007.
Ann F. Kaplan, director of the
VSF survey, said this decline repre
sents a decrease only when com
pared to Stanford's peak fundraising
vear in 2006.

"Response to The Stanford
Challenge has been nothing
short of remarkable."

"When you peak like that, there's
no way thai you ean maintain the sta
tus quo." Kaplan said."What you end
up doing is tapering off."
Shell added that despite the 5.7
percent decline in funds from 2007,
the 2008 fiscal year was not signifi
cantly affected.
"During July and August 2008. we
did see a slowing in activity particu

larly in some annual giving programs
and at certain gift levels." he said.
"We saw some decline in the total
number of donors and dollars
received via stock gifts, hut many ol
these donors supported Stanford in
other ways."
However, with insecurity in the
financial markets. Shell said,
Stanford could see some delay in

multi-year commitments from
donors in the coming years, meaning
less money for Stanford in the imme
diate future.
"Individual commitments made
during capital campaigns often are
paid over a multi-year period." he
said. "For example, if a donor decides
to establish a new professorship in
the history department, payments for
that commitment can be phased over
several years — traditionally five
years or less. With financial market
uncertainty, however, there could be
some delay."
With a volatile economic climate
on the horizon, some are worried
about fundraising's future and its
impact on universities, (living com
prises only five percent or less of
Stanford's total $3.5 million budget
each year, explained University
spokeswoman l.isa Lapin.
"With an operating budget the

size of Stanford's, fundraising sup
port in any given year does not dras
tically affect the overall budget pic
ture." Shell said. " llie importance of
gift support, however, varies among
specific units, departments, schools
and programs."
Kaplan, however, is worried about
endowment values in (lie future.
"Capital gilts to endowments and
buildings are quite sensitive to the
stock market." she said, "l arger gifts
are very often made in the form of
stocks or securities. So when the
stock market declines, the tax benefit
of making such a gift goes down. If
you say you're going to donate UK)
shares ol a certain stock, the value of
the stock goes down, even if your
intention is the same. So right now.
the tuture doesn't look too good."
