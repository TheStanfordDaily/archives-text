## Generals shape Iraq withdrawal Combat troops out by aug. 2010, residual force to remain 
### JENNIFER LOVEN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
President Barack Obama leaned heav
ily toward field commanders' preferences
in setting a time frame for an Iraq pullout,
as he weighed the fervent desires of anti
war supporters who propelled him into
office and the equally strong worries of
war generals.
"To this very day, there are some
Americans who want to stay in Iraq
longer, and some who want to leave
faster." Obama said in his announcement
Friday, summing up a debate that has
divided the country like no other since
former President George W. Bush
launched the U.S. invasion six years ago.
Obama's description suggests he
arrived at a split-down-the-middle com
promise with one of the first and most
important tasks of his young presidency.
Accounts of the process from officials
in the White I louse, at the Pentagon and
across the administration, who all
requested anonymity so they could
speak more candidly about behind-the
scenes discussions, show a more compli
cated picture.
At stake was the promise that most
defined Obama's presidential hid: to
bring all combat troops home — effec
tively. to end one of the nation's longest
and most controversial wars—l 6
months after taking office. The details he
offered in an appearance Friday before
Marines at Camp Lejeune, N.C.. depart
from that pledge in several ways:
rhe combat withdrawal will take
three months longer than he promised. It
is now be to completed by the end of
August 2010. 19 months after Obama's
inauguration. Though what Obama
emphasized most as a candidate was his
determination to bring about a quick
end to the war, in the fine print of almost
all his statements was a commitment to
flexibility.
The withdrawal will not happen at
an even pace of one combat brigade per
month, as he had repeatedly said. Instead,
it will be backloaded. ITie force posture
for this year and into the first few months
of 2010 probably will be essentially the
same as it would have been under Bush.
Under Obama's plan, troops will start
leaving in large numbers probably only
next spring or summer. Die president
intends to leave decisions about the pace
to field commanders.
— Even after the drawdown, a large
force of as many as 50.000 troops —
about a third of what is there now — will

remain, causing neartacne among anti
war Democrats who wanted a fuller pull
out.
This residual force will have a new,
technically non-combat mission: train
Iraqis, protect U.S. assets and personnel,
and conduct anti-terror operations. But
those soldiers and Marines will remain in
harm's way and engage at times in some
form of fighting.
Understanding how Obama, his aides
and his generals came to this plan must
start with how the candidate arrived at his
campaign promise.
According to one administration offi
cial, there was never any magic to the 16-
month period. At the time Obama first
made the pledge, there were about 16
combat brigades in Iraq, and military
experts told the candidate that Iraq was
too fragile for a drawdown much faster
than one combat brigade per month.
As early as last July, Obama signalled
to the military leadership that they could
influence his thinking.
During a trip to Baghdad. Obama pri
vately assured Gen. David Petraeus —
then the top U.S. commander — that
although he favored a 16-month pullout.he
would do nothing rash if elected to endan

ger security gains in Iraq, according to a
U.S. official familiar with their meeting.
When he won, Obama and his team
began meeting on the issue right away.
But the process didn't really begin
until he held the reins of the presidency.
On Day One, Obama directed the
Defense Department to start the plan
ning for "a responsible military draw
down." Also that first week, he gathered
top national security advisers in the
Situation Room, with commanders par
ticipating in person and from the field via
secure videoconference. A week later, he
made his first trip to the Pentagon, to see
the chairman and the viee chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff and all four uni
formed service chiefs.
More discussions with field command
ers followed, as well as with Defense
Secretary Robert Gates and Adm. Mike
Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff. At the beginning, the White I louse
encountered clear skepticism — both
about the need for any defined timeline
and about how rigorous Obama had been
in devising his 16-month proposal, said
one senior Obama aide.
A dozen working groups were con
vened and 10 interagency meetings were

held, said two White House officials.
Another administration official said that
while it was understood the final decision
resided in the West Wing, it was also
encouraging to those outside the White
House that they were being engaged and
heard, with a lot of back-and-forth and
draft-sharing.
Gates and Mullen presented Obama
with three withdrawal options: one for a
16-month pull-out, another with a 19-
month schedule and one that stretched it
over 23 months.
So with the December elections as a
starting point, the team added a two
month buffer requested by Odierno. The
rest was logistics: I low long would it take
starting in February to get all the rest of
the combat troops out safely? ITiey set
lied on six months.
As Obama told the Pentagon
Channel: "I think it's a responsible plan
that meets our objectives, and it's one that
was created in close consultation with our
military commanders on the ground."
