Mullen: Iran has fissile materials for
bomb
The top U.S. military official said Sunday that
Iran has sufficient fissile material for a nuclear
weapon, declaring it would be a "very, very bad
outcome" should Tehran move forward with a
bomb.
Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, offered the assessment when ques
tioned in a broadcast interview about a recent
report bv the U.N. nuclear watchdog on the state
of Iran's uranium enrichment program, which can
create nuclear fuel and may be sufficiently
advanced to produce the core of warheads.
Mullen was asked if Iran now had enough fis
sile material to make a bomb. 1 le responded, "We
think they do, quite frankly. And Iran having a
nuclear weapon I've believed for a long time is a
very, very bad outcome for the region and for the
world."
N. Korea, U.N. command hold urgent
talks at Korean DMZ
High-level military officials from North Korea
and the U.S.-led U.N. Command held urgent
talks at the border Monday amid heightened ten
sions in the region and concerns that the North
intends to test-fire a long-range missile.
The talks at the village of Panmunjom inside
the Demilitarized Zone dividing North and
South Korea — the first meetings between gen
eral-level military officials since 2002 — were
hastily arranged after the North proposed them
last week, U.N. command spokesman Kim Yong
kyu said.
"These talks can be useful in building trust
and preventing misunderstanding as well as
introducing transparency regarding the inten
tions of both sides." the UN. command said in a
statement. Kim said his office would disclose
details about the meeting after it was over.
