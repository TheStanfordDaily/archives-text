# Crime and Punishment
## Emily Grubert Not just ice: Climate change is about justice 
### 
I "admit to listening to Depeche Mode on
occasion. Stop judging. I have my reasons.
.( ... something something, almost at a
concert, something something, municipal golf
course sprinkler systems, something some
thing ... ) Anyway.
I was listening to "A Question ol I list,"
which almost gets the " The Doors" prize for
its innovative rhyming scheme in places (cf."l
need to drink/ More than you seem to
think"). At the phrase."lt's a question of lust/
It's a question of trust/ It's a question of not
letting what we've built up/ ('rumble to dust."
I leapt out of my seat. No. I cried. It is not a
question of not letting what we've build up
crumble to dust, nor is it "all about pants," as
Banana Republic might have you believe
(three days only!).
It's a question of justice.
Of course, as it usually does, "it" here
stands for "the hyper-complicated blight of
climate change, mitigation strategies and all
the rights, honors and privileges pertaining
to" it.
And that, my friends, is indeed a question
of justice.
It is well understood that the climate
change will probably disproportionately af
fect the poor and those least able to adapt. It
is also well understood that historically, at
least, these same groups have been least re
sponsible for the climate forcing caused by
global greenhouse gas emissions: non-indus
trialized countries weren't really a part of the.
er. Industrial Revolution.
Hie United Nations Framework Conven
tion on Climate Change (IJNI CCC), the
Kyoto Protocol's mom. recognizes this justice
disparity with an almost universally agreed
upon principle:"common but differentiated"
responsibility. (It's also almost universally
poorly defined so people don't have to admit
thev disagree.)

Probably the most public result of the
"common but differentiated" clause is the
Clean Development Mechanism (CDM).the
international carbon market that was estab
lished to allow developed countries buy car
bon offset credits from developing countries.
The general idea is that by establishing a mar
ket. carbon offsets will he procured at least
cost,and wealth will flow from the industrial
ized. historically responsible countries to the
less developed countries that can mitigate
more cheaply.
Iliis makes sense, but is predicated on the
assumption that developing countries are not
and will not he asked to reduce their carbon
emissions. If developing countries eventually
do take mandatory targets for reducing emis
sions, things get sticky fast since the emissions
reductions suddenly have value at home.
1 .et's consider what pricing un emitted green
house gases means.
Commoditizing carbon is one of the larger
paradigm shifts that accompany climate regu
lations. Essentially, by placing a price on
greenhouse gases, we turn the right to emit
into a tradable resource. Much as you might
buy a barrel of oil to enhance your activities
(here, by providing fuel for some process),
you will now buy some amount of not-emit
ted greenhouse gas. Its invisible, but nonethe
less a real product with real monetary value.
What this means in the justice context is
that there is potential for resource exploita
tion. Namely, if developed countries buy car
bon credits 'from developing countries under
the current system, where developing coun
tries have no legal obligation to reduce emis
sions. competitive markets will tend to lead
developing countries lo sell their cheapest
mitigation potential, last forward several
years. Now. either the entire world has obliga
tions to constrain emissions, or a developing
country is deemed sufficiently developed that

it must begin to limit its emissions.
What jumps out here is that countries have
already sold much of their cheap, easy solu
tion. Gone are the low-capital cost projects
like efficiency, prevention of deforestation
and the like. Now. these either still-develop
ing or newly-developed countries must tackle
more technically difficult, more expensive
projects to meet their targets.
For those of us who would like to see cli
mate change policy be as much about pro
moting global well-being, the potential for
sustainable development and long-term in
frastructural upgrades as it is about immedi
ately reducing carbon emissions, a better sys
tem might entail foreign investment in carbon
mitigation projects that are too expensive for
developing countries to implement, but still
cheaper than what is possible in the devel
oped world. Think about food drives it's
more helpful for affluent people to donate
nutritious, more expensive foods like vegeta
bles and soups than it is to donate the cheap
staples that the poor are more likely to be
able to afford, like rice.
The issue of mining cheap negative carbon
emissions may be a good argument for devel
oping countries to voluntarily assume limited
carbon constraints or targets, particularly on
the order of magnitude of what is achievable
at zero or negative net cost, like efficiency
measures.This can ensure that national cheap
"negative carbon" reserves belong to and are
valued by domestic governments, and may
lead to a more just outcome than "no devel
oping world targets" proposals can deliver.
Emily's got her claim staked on a really nice
scam of negative carbon emissions somewhere
in the ( on go. California's drought has ns in a
statewide State of Emergency as of Friday.
