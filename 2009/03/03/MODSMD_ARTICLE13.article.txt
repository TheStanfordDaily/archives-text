## CARD DOUBLES DOWN Men sweep Hawaii in Honolulu for first time since 1992 
### JEFF LU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's volleyball team will add two
more notches to its belt as it returns this week after en
gineering two consecutive sweeps against the Univer
sity of Hawaii. The pair of victories extended the Car
dinal's winning streak away from the Farm to three
games, bolstering what would have been an otherwise
disappointing season on the road.
No. 7 Stanford (11-7, 7-6 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation) arrived in Honolulu on Thursday for its
second-to-last road trip of the season. With six Hawai
ians in the Cardinal lineup, two more than host No. 11
Hawaii, the match was a homecoming of sorts.
Any lingering feelings for home, however, were
kept off the courts. Honolulu natives junior Kawika
Shoji and freshman Erik Shoji, set season highs for a
three-set match as they respectively contributed 49 as
sists and 23 digs to Stanford's 30-28,30-26,30-27 victo
ry. Junior Evan Romero knocked in a match-high 21
kills and Hawaiian outside hitters, freshman Brad
Lawson and sophomore Spencer McLachlin. chipped
in 11 and eight kills respectively.
"Evan Romero was definitely on," said Stanford
head coach John Kosty. "He was the deciding factor
for us by far."
A short, daylong intermission proved insufficient
for Hawaii to recuperate and formulate a winning
strategy, as the Warriors found themselves over
whelmed once again on Saturday, losing to the Cardi
nal 30-27, 30-21, 30-26 before a crowd of 3,565 at the
Stan Sheriff Center.
Stanford began the first set neck-and-neck with
Hawaii and was only able to edge out a lead after a
pair of kills by senior middle blocker Brandon
Williams gave the Cardinal a 21-19 advantage. Al
though the Warriors came back to tie up the game on
three separate occasions, they were unable to ward off
an ace by Kawika Shoji and a kill by Lawson, giving
Stanford the necessary momentum to wrap up the set
in its favor.
The Cardinal dominated the next two sets, refusing
to allow Hawaii the lead.The Warriors were able to tie
Stanford in the second set. but a 12-3 run helped the
Cardinal take control of the game.
Romero. Williams and junior middle blocker Gar
rett Werner had four blocks apiece. McLachlin led
Stanford with 15 kills.
Overall, the Cardinal hit at least 70 percent in each
set and managed to limit Hawaii to a .160 hitting per
centage. The Cardinal also served at an incredible 89

percent efficiency.
"It was a good effort by all of the team." Kosty said.
The double-header wins against Hawaii mark the
first time since 1992 that the Warriors were swept by
Stanford at home, and the first time in six years that
the Cardinal has managed a win on Hawaiian soil.
The long overdue wins over Hawaii weren't the
only groundbreaking events that Stanford was able to
celebrate last weekend. On Friday, the NCAA an
nounced that the Cardinal would be the host of the
2010 National Collegiate Men's Volleyball Champi
onships. marking the first time in Stanford history that
the event will grace the Bay Area.
