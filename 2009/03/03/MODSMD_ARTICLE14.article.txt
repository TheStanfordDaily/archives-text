## Ladies sneak by UC-Davis, but lose perfect record to San Jose State 
### KENAN JIANG STAFF WRITER 
ITie No. 3 Stanford women's gymnastics team lost for
the first time this season, falling victim to San Jose State on
the road.The loss brought the Cardinal's overall record to
12-1. Stanford's 12-0 start to the season was a school
record.
"We were unable to stop the snowball effect of mistakes
that started on the first event," said senior Kelly Fee. "It
showed us that we need to work on our mental toughness
a bit more. We came off a bad practice a few days before,
but we warmed up well and expected to deliver a solid per
formance.
"We have already bounced back from last weekend,"
Fee added."We are determined not to waste this opportu
nity to grow as a team. We're getting tougher each day and
building confidence in the process. Alabama won't know
what hit it when we leave Tuscaloosa."
Stanford will face the Alabama squad on the road on
March 6 for their final regular season meet. The team will
then go on the Pacific-10 Conference championships on
March 21, which will be hosted at the Maples Pavilion on
campus beginning 4 p.m.
TTie Cardinal had a poor start against unranked San
Jose State and suffered from miscues in the opening rota
tions of the three-team meet at I.IC-Davis. Stanford's mis
takes set the tone for a poor performance bv the team's
high standards. San Jose would go on to win 194.7. with
Stanford and Davis close behind with scores of 193.95 and
192.7. respectively.The score was a season low for the Car
dinal. and Stanford had not lost to San Jose State since
2005.
San Jose State also had a subpar performance, failing to
win a single event outright and totaling fewer than 195
points. Stanford still managed to win all four of the events.

GAME NOTES: Stanford's loss to San Jose State was its first of the season.
The Cardinal narrowly edged out Alabama in their only meeting last
year. Stanford's point total of 193.95 against San Jose was its lowest of
the season.
but the supporting cast performed
poorly despite the efforts of the win
ning rotation.
in the opening event, junior cap
tain Carly Janiga withdrew from the
meet after winning the balance beam
with a 9.875. On the floor, senior
Nicole Ourada tied San Jose's
Thomasina Wallace to win the floor
with a score of 9.9. Freshman Alyssa
Brown and sophomore Shelley
Alexander tied San Jose's Lily Swann
with a 9.85 to win the vault, lee
capped things oi l by clinching victory
on the uneven bars with a score of 9.9.
Still, Stanford was unable to
muster enough points in the closing
events to land a comeback victory.

"I think that our performance on
Friday night was a combination of a
lot of things/' Janiga said. "After the
first event, it seemed like we never
turned the meet around and it snow
balled into the other events."
"We are definitely prepared to hit
our routines, as we've shown consis
tently all of season." Janiga contin
ued. "We are just writing it off as a
fluke night that will never happen
again. We are looking at it as a wake
up call that even we can never get too
comfortable."
Despite the Cardinal setting 21
season-best scores against Cal on
Feb. 22, Fee's uneven bars perform
ance marked the only season best
score against San Jose.
"Last week, we had the men's
crew team shout and heckle us as we
went through a beam line-up," Janiga
said. "Those scenarios are what are
going to prepare us to compete in

front of K).(KK) people at Alabama
and Nationals. The meet made us
more fired up for this weekend in Al
abama. Iliey may be counting us out
because of our score this past week
end. but we are ready to bring it."
Alabama is currently ranked No.
11 and will be led by Ail-Americans
Kayla Hoffman and Casey Overton.
Last year, Stanford hosted Alabama
and narrowly edged out the four-time
national champions. Alabama came
in second in a tri-meet over the week
end against Penn State and Ohio
State, but has beaten some
competition this year, including cur
rent No. 5 Auburn.
Stanford will face off against Al
abama on Friday, March 6 in
Tuscaloosa. The meet is scheduled to
begin at 5:30 p.m.
