### KENAN JIANG STAFF WRITER 
ITie No. 3 Stanford women's gymnastics team lost for
the first time this season, falling victim to San Jose State on
the road.The loss brought the Cardinal's overall record to
12-1. Stanford's 12-0 start to the season was a school
record.
"We were unable to stop the snowball effect of mistakes
that started on the first event," said senior Kelly Fee. "It
showed us that we need to work on our mental toughness
a bit more. We came off a bad practice a few days before,
but we warmed up well and expected to deliver a solid per
formance.
"We have already bounced back from last weekend,"
Fee added."We are determined not to waste this opportu
nity to grow as a team. We're getting tougher each day and
building confidence in the process. Alabama won't know
what hit it when we leave Tuscaloosa."
Stanford will face the Alabama squad on the road on
March 6 for their final regular season meet. The team will
then go on the Pacific-10 Conference championships on
March 21, which will be hosted at the Maples Pavilion on
campus beginning 4 p.m.
TTie Cardinal had a poor start against unranked San
Jose State and suffered from miscues in the opening rota
tions of the three-team meet at I.IC-Davis. Stanford's mis
takes set the tone for a poor performance bv the team's
high standards. San Jose would go on to win 194.7. with
Stanford and Davis close behind with scores of 193.95 and
192.7. respectively.The score was a season low for the Car
dinal. and Stanford had not lost to San Jose State since
2005.
San Jose State also had a subpar performance, failing to
win a single event outright and totaling fewer than 195
points. Stanford still managed to win all four of the events.
