# Kenny Brown's moment in Card history
## 
### 
Some performances stick with
individual fans long after
they've been forgotten by
the rest of the sports world.
ITiey seem inconsequential years
down the road, but to that one per
son. or to t hat one fan base, they exist
as far more than a footnote in histo
ry. It isn't John Paxson winning the
championship with a single shot, or
Vince Young trotting into the end
zone to take the BC S crown — those
are tremendous moments that tran
scend time. No. these instances are
smaller in magnitude, but carry
heavy significance.
Take this December, for example,
when New York's Derrick Ward ran
wild over the Carolina Panthers. In
his last regular-season game in a Gi
ants uniform, and with the top play
off seed on the line, the reserve tail
back took to the icy field and carried
his struggling team to a second half
resurgence and overtime victory. His
line on the night: 15 carries,2ls yards
and a No. 1 seed.
In the end.it was all for moot:The
Giants were bounced in their first
postseason game, and a season of
high hopes ended in disappoint
ment. But Ward's performance was
emblematic of more — it was his

lasting imprint on his tenure with
team. It summarized, in just over 60
minutes of football, everything that
Ward brought to the Giants: a gritty
runner who could trample defenses
that forgot about him in focusing on
more well-known threats. His end
less motor.even as he was kept in the

game without rest, was representa
tive of a career that took him from
Fresno State to Ottawa (Kansas, not
Canada), to the Jets' practice squad
and finally to a regular role with the
Giants; despite the obstacles, he
never stopped running.
I was one of the fans in atten
dance that night. I stood and
watched from the upper deck of Gi
ants Stadium. I had on four pairs of
socks and three layers of pants for
what was sure to be an epically
windy and cold affair. Instead of
worrying about how many extremi
ties I could lose to the frost. I found
myself admiring Ward's tenacity,
even as the game extended close to
midnight and respites were hard to
come bv.

It was a great and lasting per
formance, but one that fans of other
NFL teams have likely already for
gotten — that is, if they were ever
cognizant of it at all. But now that
Ward has signed a long-term deal
with Tampa Bay, that is the memory
that will remain with me. And that's
why he'll always be a Giant in my
eyes.
Athletes move on to different
teams and careers, but as sports fans,
we remember them in the ways we
see fit, and keep them stuck in the
time. After Sunday, Kenny Brown,
even if he goes on to be a celebrity
dentist extraordinaire, will forever
be clad in Stanford white, falling
back against the Cardinal bench as
he drains a three-point dagger.
Why? Because on a night in
honor of him and his classmates, in
front of a crowd and teammates
looking for any salvation to a largely
lost season. Brown delivered a shot
that few would take and even fewer
would make.
The Cardinal was up by five at
this specific moment, but USC re
fused to quit, and given Stanford's
tendencies to lose leads late, nothing
was certain. Anthony Goods missed
a three, and the ensuing rebound
began to carom out of bounds.
Brown leaped and. in the air, tossed
the ball back to Landry Fields.
Brown immediately headed to the
corner, took the pass and. fading
away with a hand in his face, stayed
true to his nickname and knocked
down the prayer.
It deflated the Trojans and threw
Maples into a frenzy. There were
nearly five minutes left in the game,
but the outcome was practically se
cured.
"Kenny showed the moxie of
stepping back and having the three
ball go," said coach Johnny Dawkins.
"No hesitation, bottom of the net."
Barring a miracle, Stanford will
miss the NCAA Tournament. They
may not even have an NIT bid se
cured. It's been a frustrating and
heartbreaking season for the Cardi
nal. which, just a year removed from
the Sweet 16. has battled everything
from three one-point conference
losses to struggling attendance. But
on Sunday, all was right. Stanford
showed resiliency and flashed bril
liance — and Brown summarized it
all with one play.
It's moments like those that make
a season of tribulations worth the ef
fort.
"It was pretty amazing," Brown
said.
He wasn't going to be a Cardinal
this year — he was supposed to be at
dental school, and had already been
accepted when Dawkins invited him
back. He returned, and with his shot
and performance on Sunday, Down
town Kenny Brown became more
than just a loveable fan favorite —
he secured his place in Stanford lore.
It may not be on the level of Nick
Robinson's buzzer-beater against
Arizona, but it doesn't have to be.
When Cardinal fans remember this
season, they'll recall the ups and
downs, but they'll also remember
that on Senior Day.the former walk
on made his mark.
At the press conference after the
game. Brown was asked if it was
worth it to come back and play this
year — if it was worth it to go out
with a team that would likely not
have the same success as its direct
predecessor.
Without hesitation. Brown
laughed and delivered a perfect an
swer: "Yes."
