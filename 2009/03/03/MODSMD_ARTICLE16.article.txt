slaught, scoring three unanswered goals in a
two-minute span. With San Jose unable to ere

ate any scoring opportunities on offense or
stop the Cardinal on defense, it looked as if
Stanford could safely notch another tally
under its win column.
Yet the Spartans would not go down with
out a fight. San Jose immediately responded to
Stanford's three-goal streak with one of its
own, cutting the lead to 7-4 at halftime.
"Each time we had a chance to put our

stamp on the game and put it out of reach
emotionally, we couldn't do it." said head
coach John Tanner.
After a quick goal by freshman Pallavi
Menon to open the second half, San Jose
scored two straight goals to draw within two
points of the Cardinal.That, however, was the
closest the Spartans would come to upsetting
the best team in the land.

with a goal off a Stanford steal. Menon then

the Cardinal a little breathing room.

they had two post players, but only one today.
That threw us off a little bit."

The Stanford women's water polo team jumped out to an early lead on Saturday to defeat San Jose State. Despite exhibiting shaky defense at times,
the No. 1 Cardinal was able to use its offensive firepower to its advantage, proving too explosive for the Spartans.
â€” similar challenges."
With Arizona State's athleticism
and scoring threats, Stanford's de
fense, which has been an issue for the
team all season long, will be tested.
Against San Jose, the Cardinal may
have found a solution for sub-par de
fending: more offense.
"We played well on offense and
made them play tough defense." Tan
ner said. "They never got comfort
able on offense because of it."
Even with the firepower Stanford
has on offense, including the terrify
ing trio of Seidemann, Eaton and
senior Lauren Silver, Tanner is not
planning on relying solely on his of
fense.
"We just need to be more as

serlive on defense," he said.
After the Arizona State match,
Stanford will make the quick flight
back home and head to Davis for a
doubleheader against No. 11 UC-
Davis and No. 17 Cal-State Makers
field on Sunday.
Davis boasts an 11-5 record, with
quality wins over No. 18 UC-San
Diego and San Jose. Bakersfield is
currently 9-4 on the year, with mar
quee victories over No. 13 UC-Santa
Barbara and No. 14 Michigan.
While neither team should pose a
serious problem for the Cardinal,

Stanford's biggest challenge may be
overcoming fatigue after what will
be a very physical match against Ari
zona State. Luckily for Stanford,
Davis plays Santa Clara earlier in the
day before facing the Cardinal, so
neither team will be completely
fresh and rested.
Both the Arizona State and Davis
matches are scheduled to begin at
noon.and the Bakersfield match will
start at 3 p.m.
