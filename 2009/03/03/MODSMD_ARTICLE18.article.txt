# Lacrosse falters in South Bend

### SARAH OHR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford women's lacrosse team suffered a disap
pointing loss in Indiana over the weekend as it dropped
its game against No. 12 Notre Dame, 17-8.
The Fighting Irish outscored Stanford 9-3 in the first
half, making a recovery near impossible.The Cardinal im
proved its performance after halftime. hut a second-half
score of 8-5 in favor of Notre Dame left the game in the
hands of the Fighting Irish.
"We didn't play anywhere near our caliber," said
sophomore midfielder Karen Nesbitt. who came away
with one goal and one assist. "We played frantic and re
acted to them. It was a terrible feeling, and I know it won't
happen to us again because none of us want to feel like
we did after that game."
Head coach Amv Bokker blamed the loss on a lack of
aggression and too little selfishness. This was also a rea
son for Stanford's first loss of the season last weekend
against a very physical Syracuse team.
"It was a really physical game," Bokker said. "I felt
that we needed to be a little bit tougher. Everybody's
scoring and we have different threats; that's a positive.
But we need to get more physical to allow ourselves to
take advantage of our skills."
Senior defender Maris Perlman agreed.
"Our team has a very different feel than past years,"
Perlman said. "Everyone in the offense is a threat; we
don't really have 'superstars' who score the majority of
the team's goals, like some other teams.
"This is a huge strength of ours as our offense is really
well-rounded and hard to shut down," she continued.
"This can also be otir weakness sometimes as everyone
plays as a team player, and sometimes you just need
someone to be a little selfish and make the decision that
today, in this game, they are going to score four goals —
and that didn't really happen in our game against Notre
Dame."
Looking forward, the Cardinal hopes to maximize in
dividual efforts in an attempt to strengthen team play.
The team resumed practice on Monday and has four
practices before its next game.
"I think this weekend was an eye-opener for everyone
and showed us the importance of needing to bring our
best game and individual effort for 60 minutes of every

game." said senior attacker Bess Siegfried. "In moving
ahead, we are going to be working on holding each other
more accountable in practice and taking more individual
responsibility and initiative. We all know the talent is
there, but it takes each player's belief and confidence in
herself to achieve team success."
Sophomore goalkeeper Annie Read agreed that the
Cardinal has tremendous potential, and that this overall
team potential is what needs to be focused upon.
"I think we all just want to try to move forward and
not let the loss dictate the rest of our season," Read said.
"We have so much talent and potential on our team and
hope that these traits will shine over the next few weeks."
Fortunately.it appears that the loss came early enough
as to not completely hamper the Cardinal's playoff
hopes. Stanford has eight games left until the Mountain
Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) Tournament begins.
"Our goal is to make it to the tournament again this
year." Perlman said. "To do this, we need to beat the top
teams. Losing to Notre Dame hurts us. but we have more
games against top-ranked teams that we can use to prove
who we are this year. I am confident in our team that we
can bounce back from this."
The Cardinal will indeed have plenty of chances to
face top-ranked teams, as four of its final eight games are
against teams currently ranked in the top 20.
Stanford will take on St. Mary's in Moraga. Calif, on
March 6. but returns home to face William & Mary on
March 8.
