## Stanford salaries more moderate than peers' 
### LIZ STARK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A recent report on private col
lege compensation by The Chronicle
of Higher Education has drawn the
ire of legislators including lowa
Senator Chuck Grassley, who lam
basted universities for paying large
sums to football coaches and med
ical specialists.
But no Stanford employee came
within $500,000 of cracking The
Chronicle's list of the top 10 highest
paid private college employees.
According to the University's
IRS Form 990 from fiscal year 2007
the latest provided to The Daily
Stanford's highest-paid employee
is Dr. Frank Hanle, a professor of
cardiothoracic surgery who made
$1,735,417 in total compensation
that year.
The top-paid employee on the
Chronicle list is USC football coach
Pete Carrol, who made $4,415,714 in
fiscal year 2007. The 10th highest
paid is James A. Grifo, professor of
obstetrics and gynecology at New
York University; Grifo made
$2,393,646.
Surprisingly, the Chronicle found
that chief executives made up only
11 of the 88 private university
employees earning more than $1
million. By â€¢comparison, 46 medical
administrators and specialists
earned more than $1 million.
Stanford is no exception.

President John Hennessy made
$667,440 in fiscal year 2007 he did
not make the list of the five highest
paid university employees.
In comparison, the most highly
paid university president in fiscal
year 2007 was Vanderbilt's E.
Gordon Gee, who made $2.1 mil
lion. Yale University President
Richard Levin made $955,407, and
Princeton University President
Shirley Tilghman made $724,444.
In light of Stanford's budget cuts,
Hennessy announced in December
that he, along with Provost John
Etchemendy, would immediately
take a 10 percent pay cut.
According to data from The
Chronicle, Stanford's Chief
Financial Officer (CFO) Randy
Livingston is the ninth highest-paid
CFO in the country. Livingston
made $577,061 in fiscal year 2007.
As is the case at other universi
ties, the top earners at Stanford were
predominantly medical specialists
four of the top five are medical
faculty.
The only non-medical profes
sional in the top five was Sunica
Tyler Edelstein, a former managing
director of the Stanford
Management Company. Edelstein
earned $1,467,750.
The salaries of medical specialists
and top administrators dwarf those of
the average professor at universities
