### KAMIL DADA DESK EDITOR 
Students, trekked through early morning
rain to hear former Secretary of State Colin
Powell tell personal anecdotes of his time in
government and discuss the importance of the
.American Dream on Monda\ tit Memorial
Auditorium.
A capacity crowd attended Powell's talk,
w hich covered personal memories and lessons
learned from his time in Washington. Powell
engaged the audience with his humor, but ulti
mately left mam attendees disappointed with
the lack of serious intellectual content.

f ormer Secretary of State George
Shultz introduced Powell with a brief
description of the former states
man's numerous accomplish
ments in public service. He
pointed out that Powell
served in the Vietnam
and Gulf Wars, com
-1 manded "5.000
troops in Germany

and "rejuvenated" the State Department, but
argued that he did not wish to simplv list
Powell's accomplishments. Instead. Shu It/
chose to focus on Powell's human characteris
tics.
"I le is just a wonderful human being and
has a terrific sense of humor." Shult/ said."! le
is a wonderful public servant."
Indeed, audience members were readiK
rewarded with Powell's sense of humor. I le
joked thai since he is no longer Secretary of
State or Chairman of the .Joint (' Jiiels of Staff,
it was simply "a great pleasure to be any
where" and have something to do. 1 le added
that the lack of intellectual and emotional
stimulation was a serious problem for him.
"1 gave it a great deal <>t thought [about
how to solve the problem}." he said wryly. "I
bought a Corvette."
hie went on to humorous I v recount how
the biggest thing he missed about being
Secretary of State was access to his private
plane. Audience members laughed as he told a
story of how hordes of onlookers would wav e
to him as he boarded his plane and how the
plane would take off as soon as his own per
sonal assistant poured him a can of Coke after
he was seated.
"As soon as 1 left office, they took my plane
aw ay" he joked."They gave it to Condi. Now 's
Hillary's got ii. and I'll never see it again."

Former Secretary of State Colin Powell
spoke to a packed oudience in Memorial
Auditorium yesterday Powell shared a variety
of humorous anecdotes along with
political opinions in his talk.
Powell then transitioned his talk,
using humor as a foundation for mak
ing political statements. Speaking of
how he was searched by immigration
control at the airport after he showed
up late to board a plane, paid in cash
and had no luggage, he questioned
whether the U.S. was paying "tcx) high
a price for [its] own safety."
"In this globalized, tlattening world,
we were communicating the message
[to foreign students] that America is
not a welcoming place." he said. "We
want them to get the skills that their
country needs when they return home
â€” or perhaps stay here."
He added that it was important to
stick to the notion of America as a
place of hope and realization of
dreams.
"Terrorists can't change who we are
as a people." Powell argued. "Only we
can do that to ourselves."
He continued on to offer advice to
the crowd on the importance of human
connection through a personal anec
dote. Audience members laughed as
the former Secretary of State described
his vivid memory of how workers in the
garage of the White I louse would park
airs of guests nearby if the visitors
would smile and say good morning to
the workers.

"It is just the simple connection to
human beings," Powell emphasized.
'ITie fits of laughter only grew
stronger as Powell moved on to
detailed narratives ol how his grand
children played video games such as
Guitar Hero and would Twitter and
send text messages on their cell
phones. I le added that he ended up
endorsing President Ohama in his hid
for president when he realized how the
former senator was using technology.
"In an almost military-like fashion,
he organized efforts." Powell said.
1 le added that the I J.S. needed the
generational change and transforma
tion that Ohama would bring to the
government. Powell explained that his
support for Ohama also stemmed
from his realization that the presiden
tial candidate had a strong vision, but
was not ideologically rigid. I le pointed
to the poor state of the economy as an
example and explained that Ohama
did not pretend to have a quick and
easy fix.
"The Republicans came up with an
answer: Joe the plumber," he said to a
crowd roaring with laughter. "I'm not
kidding."
Powell ended with some parting
advice for the audience. I le warned stu
dents that the issue of race was not
going to disappear overnight and
stressed the importance of addressing
poverty and the lack of education in
many parts of the I Jnited States.
"Don't walk away from those in
need," he said. "Carry out service in

your community.
Many students reacted favorably to
the former General's talk and pointed
to his sense of humor as being particu
larly effective. I lowever, others felt that
the talk was more of a whimsical reflec
tion rather than an intellectually stimu
lating lecture.
"I thought it was an entertaining
talk."' said James Adelston, a second
year law student. "1 lowever, there was
not much content and I came away
from the talk having learned little
about his experiences as Secretary of
State."
Steven Adamosuki, a former
colonel under Powell in the Vietnam
War. agreed.
"I thought that there was certainly
not enough meat in the lecture."
Adamosuki said. "I was definitely not
pleased with Powell's cheap attempts at
humor in place of real information.
Someone who had as deep an experi
ence as Powell did should share the les
sons they learned."
I le added that the lack of open dia
logue with the student body in the form
ol a question-and-answer session par
ticularly compounded his frustration
with the event.
"The fact that he didn't want stu
dents to ask him the tough questions
shows that he viewed this entire lecture
as a bit of a charade." Adamosuki said.
"I am very disappointed."
