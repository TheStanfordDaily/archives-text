Students, trekked through early morning
rain to hear former Secretary of State Colin
Powell tell personal anecdotes of his time in
government and discuss the importance of the
.American Dream on Monda\ tit Memorial
Auditorium.
A capacity crowd attended Powell's talk,
w hich covered personal memories and lessons
learned from his time in Washington. Powell
engaged the audience with his humor, but ulti
mately left mam attendees disappointed with
the lack of serious intellectual content.

f ormer Secretary of State George
Shultz introduced Powell with a brief
description of the former states
man's numerous accomplish
ments in public service. He
pointed out that Powell
served in the Vietnam
and Gulf Wars, com
-1 manded "5.000
troops in Germany

and "rejuvenated" the State Department, but
argued that he did not wish to simplv list
Powell's accomplishments. Instead. Shu It/
chose to focus on Powell's human characteris
tics.
"I le is just a wonderful human being and
has a terrific sense of humor." Shult/ said."! le
is a wonderful public servant."
Indeed, audience members were readiK
rewarded with Powell's sense of humor. I le
joked thai since he is no longer Secretary of
State or Chairman of the .Joint (' Jiiels of Staff,
it was simply "a great pleasure to be any
where" and have something to do. 1 le added
that the lack of intellectual and emotional
stimulation was a serious problem for him.
"1 gave it a great deal <>t thought [about
how to solve the problem}." he said wryly. "I
bought a Corvette."
hie went on to humorous I v recount how
the biggest thing he missed about being
Secretary of State was access to his private
plane. Audience members laughed as he told a
story of how hordes of onlookers would wav e
to him as he boarded his plane and how the
plane would take off as soon as his own per
sonal assistant poured him a can of Coke after
he was seated.
"As soon as 1 left office, they took my plane
aw ay" he joked."They gave it to Condi. Now 's
Hillary's got ii. and I'll never see it again."
