## Fed. money slated for Work-Study 
### KATE ABBOTT STAFF WRITER 
A total of $2OO million was allotted
to colleges for Federal Work-Study
(FWS) as a part of the economic stim
ulus bill signed by President Obama
last week. Though the funds will not
be allocated until April 1, Stanford
hopes to see a share of these funds for
distribution to both undergraduate
and graduate students.
Ibe plan is expected to give aid to
an additional 130,000 college students
across the nation, with each earning
an average of $1,500 a year. Last year,
675 Stanford students participated in
the Work-Study program.
Mary Morrison, director of funds
management in the Office of
Financial Aid, said she hopes the num
ber of participants will increase if
Stanford receives additional federal
funding, but it is too soon to tell.
"We're expecting some changes [to
the funding distribution system] but
we don't know what they are," she
said. "We're not counting on seeing
anything."
According to Morrison, the
Department of Education considers
numerous factors, including student
enrollment and the number of stu
dents with Pell Grants when assigning
federal funds for Work-Study. The
University then also provides funding
to students enrolled in the program,
although federal money accounts for
75 percent of the income.
"We don't know what [the
Department of Education] is going to
do with this new money, because
they're changing so many rules,"
Morrison said. "There's an extremely
elaborate formula that has been
developed over the years, and it isn't
even as simple as asking for a part of
the national allocation."
Morrison said that the Office of
Financial Aid was given an estimate
by the government of how much
funding they could potentially receive
before the stimulus plan was
announced, so the University is plan
ning around this budget without
expectation of receiving additional
aid. Because of this planning, there
are no foreseeable changes to the cur
rent program.
"They told us what we're |receiv
ing! before the changes, and that's
what we're planning on operating
with." she said, "but if we get more
money, we will use it."
Before the stimulus package,
Stanford was expecting to see around
$2.1 million in federal money for the
Work-Study program, although this
number had not been finalized. The
extra $2(M) million will be spread thin
ly across colleges.This extra boost will
help universities meet the new nation
al minimum wage, which is expected
to rise to $7.25 over the summer.

The importance of the I WS pro
gram is recognized by both political
parties, and has received much sup
port because of its influence, accord
ing to a recent article in The Chronicle
of I ligher Education.
"Everyone understands the con
cept of working your way through
school." said Cynthia A. Littlefield,
director of federal relations for the
Association of Jesuit Colleges and
Universities in an interview with The
Chronicle.
Caitlin Smith '(W praised the I WS
program for providing opportunities
that some students would not be open
to otherwise because of monetary
issues. Smith participated in the
Community Service Work-Study pro
gram through the I laas ( enter in con
junction with normal Work-Study
over the summer.This program places
individuals in community service
organizations outside the I Iniversity,
but pays students with I ederal Work-
Study funding.
"I got to work somewhere that fit
really well with my career goals."
Smith said. "Work Study allows you
to work for a nonprofit organization
or government agency where you
normally wouldn't be able to be paid

because they can't afford it."
Smith was awarded $4,000 in
Work-Study funds, which helped pay
for her apartment in San Francisco
while working as a mentor to foster
children.
"[With community service Work
Study] students don't have to choose
between what they want to do and
getting paid." Smith said. "And it's
valuable. There's a lot of things you
want to do post-graduation that you
need to apply for. Graduate schools
want to see that you have something
more to you than being able to take a
test, and work experience is a really
good way to show that."
Morrison reiterated the impor
tance of the Work-Study program.
"Itie advantage to having federal
money is that students would be paid
mostly by the government instead of
by the department," Morrison said.
"We [hope there will be) more money
to give to people to make it easier for
them to find jobs on campus. People
who really need a job from the gov
ernment's point of view will have a
job because of this extra money."
