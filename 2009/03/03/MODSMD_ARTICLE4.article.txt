## Fed. money slated for Work-Study 
### KATE ABBOTT STAFF WRITER 
A total of $2OO million was allotted
to colleges for Federal Work-Study
(FWS) as a part of the economic stim
ulus bill signed by President Obama
last week. Though the funds will not
be allocated until April 1, Stanford
hopes to see a share of these funds for
distribution to both undergraduate
and graduate students.
Ibe plan is expected to give aid to
an additional 130,000 college students
across the nation, with each earning
an average of $1,500 a year. Last year,
675 Stanford students participated in
the Work-Study program.
Mary Morrison, director of funds
management in the Office of
Financial Aid, said she hopes the num
ber of participants will increase if
Stanford receives additional federal
funding, but it is too soon to tell.
"We're expecting some changes [to
the funding distribution system] but
we don't know what they are," she
said. "We're not counting on seeing
anything."
According to Morrison, the
Department of Education considers
numerous factors, including student
enrollment and the number of stu
dents with Pell Grants when assigning
federal funds for Work-Study. The
University then also provides funding
to students enrolled in the program,
although federal money accounts for
75 percent of the income.
"We don't know what [the
Department of Education] is going to
do with this new money, because
they're changing so many rules,"
Morrison said. "There's an extremely
elaborate formula that has been
developed over the years, and it isn't
even as simple as asking for a part of
the national allocation."
