# FEATURES PRESENTS
## The 						Mascot is STRANGE 
### ELLEN HUET STAFF WRITER 
Jonathan "Shu-Fry" Strange 'll is
the kind of person whose smell
reaches you a couple seconds
before he does. It's nothing par
ticularly strong—just a linger
ing odor of fast food, dining hall fare
and other things that toe the line
between edible and questionable.
It's probably safe to assume that he

wasn't always this way, but since he

was selected as the new Stanford Tree,
Strange now has to wear the Tree
Vest, which can only be described as
an elegant shade of fecal brown, par
ticularly reminiscent of a shag rug, and
fashioned in a wholly unflattering cut.
It's also never been washed.
"Actually, part of my job today is to
wait for it to start pouring so I can go
out and wash it in the rain," explained
Strange, motioning to the suspicious-

looking stains that cross from the
side around to the back of the vest.
Like the rest of the traditions sur
rounding the Stanford Tree, it is mys
terious, somewhat absurd and just a
little bit gross.
Strange was chosen to be Tree last
Thursday after a week of competi
tion against Free contenders Kyle
Owen '10 and Jack Cackler '09. The
process, though shrouded in mystery,
is generally very involved — candi
dates are interviewed and perform
numerous stunts across campus,
among other things.Tree Week saw a
wide range of stunts from the com
petitors, including zip lines and a
blood drive.
Strange began brainstorming for
stunt ideas after last year's Tree
Week, when he was inspired by the
antics of last year's competitors.
Many of his friends suggested that
he would be a good candidate for
Tree, and he took their advice to
heart. He started with a vast list of
ideas and eventually narrowed them
down to the most entertaining and
feasible.
"I was going to dress as Homer
Simpson, shave my head, do yellow
body paint and do a skateboard
jump." Strange said. "But I almost
hurt my ankle learning to skate
board. so I had to cross that off my
list."
In his campaign. Strange wanted
to emphasize entertainment over
shock value of the stunts.
"Tree Week is meant to entertain
the public." he said. "A lot of people
misinterpret it and do painful things.
Some people think it's impressive to
go to extreme limits to show how
much you want (to be Tree]. I under
stand their point of view, but my Tree
campaign had little to no pain
involved at all. I was mainly out
there to prove that if you can enter
tain people, you can make a good
Tree."
While some stunts were highly
publicized, others were less targeted
toward the public. Strange explained
that some stunts function well in a
public setting, but what really mat
ters is that the former Tree —
Patrick Fortune '09 — sees the stunt.
As for the actual selection
process, the details remain hidden
from the public.
"It's actually a very complicated
process, and even I'm not 100 per
cent sure what goes on." Strange
said. "I'd like to keep the mystery,
though, because that's another cool
thing about it — no one reallv knows

exactly what's going on. except those
trying out."
In keeping with the secretive ten
dencies of the Band and the Tree,
Strange declined to describe all of
his stunts in order to keep the
intrigue alive. His largest and final
stunt had him dressed up in a gorilla
suit as "Shu Kong" and chased
around by his friends with torches
and pitchforks. Against a backdrop
of machine fog and red lights, he was
"captured" by the angry mob and
welded into a cage ball that he had
constructed earlier.
"They welded me inside the cage,
but I broke out with the strength of
10 men." he explained.
"You definitely need a
lot of energy...and
probably no shame."

The cage ball, which Strange
began constructing long before Tree
Week, was also used in an earlier
stunt: human bowling.
"We set up a bunch of empty kegs
in howling pin fashion and people
would roll me like crazy to knock
them over." he described. "I welded
the cage ball so that you could sit.
strap yourself in and roll. It was
about 60 hours of work, bending
metal poles—l was struggling the
whole time."
Being mascot to the country's
most eccentric band isn't something
to be taken lightly. Strange explained
that the Tree must have dedication,
creativity and, most importantly,
lightness of foot.
"I've danced all my life — mostly
high school dance ensemble stuff,"
he said. "I like to mix it up. A lot is
inspired by swing, tango, stuff like
that. I have a lot of stuff in my arse
nal."
Apart from the often underesti
mated dancing involved, however.
Strange agreed that the Tree is a
highly demanding role.
"You definitely need a lot of
energy, a lot of enthusiasm and prob
ably no shame," he said.
Strange referenced his first night

as Tree when he had to dance with
out the costume at the basketball
game, wearing just the Tree Vest and
little green shorts.
"A lot of people would have a
hard time going out there in front of
thousands of people, just dancing,"
he said. "I just have no shame."
In addition to the Tree's regular
duties — dancing for hours on end.
protecting the Dollies and being
voted "worst college mascot ever" by
people who obviously have no taste
— Strange will be spending the sum
mer constructing his own Tree cos
tume. Costumes are usually based
off of a backpack-mounted metal
frame with fabric and hoops.
"I*ll be doing a pine tree again,
and I'll probably hook up a
Camelßak to it to get some water
while the costume is on," Strange
said.
I le also hopes to turn some of his
Tree Week stunts into something
lasting. He has plans to open up the
cage ball to the public and donate
the profits from rides to the Williams
Syndrome F-bundation. in memory of
"Super Dave" Hahn. an ardent fan
of Stanford athletics and the Hand,
who passed away last fall.
With regard to his fellow com
petitors. Strange was grateful for
their participation.
"I'd like to give a big thank you to
the rest of the candidates." he said.
"They really upped the competition
this year, and they kept me guessing
the whole time and kept me on my
game."
Strange especially respected the
dedication of Kyle Owen '10. who he
said put all he had into the cam
paign.
"If there were more people in
Sixth Man and Red Zone like
[Owen], our school would be a lot
better," he said.
Strange will be taking over as
Tree beginning this spring and con
tinuing until next year's mascot is
selected. He looks forward to the
excitement of sports games, bringing
back the "cool pants" to the costume
and the added recognition.
"It's a big step to go from walking
around campus as a prospective Tree
to walking around campus as the
Tree," he said. "It was a lot of work,
but I had a lot of friends who sup
ported me and my goal. |Being
named Tree] was one of the coolest
moments of my life."

ideas and eventually narrowed them
down to the most entertaining and
feasible.
"I was going to dress as Homer
Simpson, shave my head, do yellow
body paint and do a skateboard
jump." Strange said. "But I almost
hurt my ankle learning to skate
board. so I had to cross that off my
list."
In his campaign. Strange wanted
to emphasize entertainment over
shock value of the stunts.
"Tree Week is meant to entertain
the public." he said. "A lot of people
misinterpret it and do painful things.
Some people think it's impressive to
go to extreme limits to show how
much you want (to be Tree]. I under
stand their point of view, but my Tree
campaign had little to no pain
involved at all. I was mainly out
there to prove that if you can enter
tain people, you can make a good
Tree."
While some stunts were highly
publicized, others were less targeted
toward the public. Strange explained
that some stunts function well in a
public setting, but what really mat
ters is that the former Tree —
Patrick Fortune '09 — sees the stunt.
As for the actual selection
process, the details remain hidden
from the public.
"It's actually a very complicated
process, and even I'm not 100 per
cent sure what goes on." Strange
said. "I'd like to keep the mystery,
though, because that's another cool
thing about it — no one reallv knows

exactly what's going on. except those
trying out."
In keeping with the secretive ten
dencies of the Band and the Tree,
Strange declined to describe all of
his stunts in order to keep the
intrigue alive. His largest and final
stunt had him dressed up in a gorilla
suit as "Shu Kong" and chased
around by his friends with torches
and pitchforks. Against a backdrop
of machine fog and red lights, he was
"captured" by the angry mob and
welded into a cage ball that he had
constructed earlier.
"They welded me inside the cage,
but I broke out with the strength of
10 men." he explained.
"You definitely need a
lot of energy...and
probably no shame."
JONATHAN STRANGE
11, new Stanford Tree
The cage ball, which Strange
began constructing long before Tree
Week, was also used in an earlier
stunt: human bowling.
"We set up a bunch of empty kegs
in howling pin fashion and people
would roll me like crazy to knock
them over." he described. "I welded
the cage ball so that you could sit.
strap yourself in and roll. It was
about 60 hours of work, bending
metal poles—l was struggling the
whole time."
Being mascot to the country's
most eccentric band isn't something
to be taken lightly. Strange explained
that the Tree must have dedication,
creativity and, most importantly,
lightness of foot.
"I've danced all my life — mostly
high school dance ensemble stuff,"
he said. "I like to mix it up. A lot is
inspired by swing, tango, stuff like
that. I have a lot of stuff in my arse
nal."
Apart from the often underesti
mated dancing involved, however.
Strange agreed that the Tree is a
highly demanding role.
"You definitely need a lot of
energy, a lot of enthusiasm and prob
ably no shame," he said.
Strange referenced his first night

as Tree when he had to dance with
out the costume at the basketball
game, wearing just the Tree Vest and
little green shorts.
"A lot of people would have a
hard time going out there in front of
thousands of people, just dancing,"
he said. "I just have no shame."
In addition to the Tree's regular
duties — dancing for hours on end.
protecting the Dollies and being
voted "worst college mascot ever" by
people who obviously have no taste
— Strange will be spending the sum
mer constructing his own Tree cos
tume. Costumes are usually based
off of a backpack-mounted metal
frame with fabric and hoops.
"I*ll be doing a pine tree again,
and I'll probably hook up a
Camelßak to it to get some water
while the costume is on," Strange
said.
I le also hopes to turn some of his
Tree Week stunts into something
lasting. He has plans to open up the
cage ball to the public and donate
the profits from rides to the Williams
Syndrome F-bundation. in memory of
"Super Dave" Hahn. an ardent fan
of Stanford athletics and the Hand,
who passed away last fall.
With regard to his fellow com
petitors. Strange was grateful for
their participation.
"I'd like to give a big thank you to
the rest of the candidates." he said.
"They really upped the competition
this year, and they kept me guessing
the whole time and kept me on my
game."
Strange especially respected the
dedication of Kyle Owen '10. who he
said put all he had into the cam
paign.
"If there were more people in
Sixth Man and Red Zone like
[Owen], our school would be a lot
better," he said.
Strange will be taking over as
Tree beginning this spring and con
tinuing until next year's mascot is
selected. He looks forward to the
excitement of sports games, bringing
back the "cool pants" to the costume
and the added recognition.
"It's a big step to go from walking
around campus as a prospective Tree
to walking around campus as the
Tree," he said. "It was a lot of work,
but I had a lot of friends who sup
ported me and my goal. |Being
named Tree] was one of the coolest
moments of my life."
