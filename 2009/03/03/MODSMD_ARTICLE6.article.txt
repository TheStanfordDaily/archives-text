## Santorum draws interest, ire 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Last night, former Senator Rick Santorum (R-
Penn.) spoke to an intimate audience at Kresge
Auditorium about the threat of Islamic fascism to
American national security.
Broaching the politically sensitive topic of his
lecture, titled "The Gathering Storm in the Age of
Obama: Challenges and Opportunities," Santorum
expressed his desire to engage the audience in a
hearty dialogue.
"I came out and started this discussion because I
wanted to enlist the Left," he said.
Santorum's speech covered a variety of issues,
from the need to examine the ideological basis of
terrorism to the importance of understanding differ
ences between the Sunni and Shiite branches of
Islam.
Explaining his concept of Islamic fascism,
Santorum said, "If you don't understand their theol
ogy and what they want to accomplish, what their
goals are, what's driving them to do what they're
doing, then you have very little understanding of
how we should fight this war or why we should fight
this war."
Santorum also expressed discontent with the
Bush administration's execution of the war in Iraq

a campaign that he initially supported.
Carl Kelm 'O9, a political science major and edi
tor emeritus of The Stanford Review, which cospon
sored the event, said that he was very happy to
engage Santorum as the publication's guest speaker.
"It was mostly just a convergence of interest,"
Kelm said. "We were interested in him and he was
on the lecture circuit and wanted to come here, so it
worked out well. As a [former] United States sena
tor, he has a perspective that few of us can experi
ence ... I think he is a well-spoken guy; he's an
intelligent guy. There's no accident that he became a
two-term U.S. senator."

Kelm also stressed the significance of Santorum's
discussion on national security.
"The whole point of calling it a 'gathering storm'
is to highlight the fact that it's still building," Kelm
added regarding the lecture's title. "A change in
administration is not necessarily going to mean that
it's going to disappear."
Not all students, however, harbored positive sen
timents towards Santorum. During the question
and-answer portion of the lecture, a number of audi
ence members challenged the validity of Santorum's
claims about Islamic extremism.

In addition, prior to Monday's lecture, a number
of Facebook groups cropped up in protest of the
former senator's presence at Stanford.
Frank Nothaft 'll was among the numerous stu
dents who opposed Santorum's lecture.
"He is the opposite of a civil rights leader,"
Nothaft said. "His views are very backwards and
really only hurtful toward large sections of the U.S.
He's very strongly anti-gay. He's very strongly anti-
Arab ... I don't really feel that hateful viewpoints

Protestors gathered outside of Kresge to show their
opposition to Santorum's opinions. Though the issue
did not arise in his talk, Santorum's well-known position
against gay rights drew opposition.
