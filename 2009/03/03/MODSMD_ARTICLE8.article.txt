JL JLrWelcome to the 2009
Athlete Date Auction: A Cardinal
Council Event." A blue and green
Camp Kesem banner hangs forlornly
to the side.
The seats of Dinkelspiel
Auditorium are half-filled with vari
ous costumed freshmen from
Stanford's athletic teams — from the
red fleece robes of the men's water
polo players to the black shorts and
gold-decaled tank tops donned by the
women's swimmers — as well as
other student onlookers.
Beyonce's "Single Ladies" can be
heard faintly playing over the inces
sant chatter. The auction's black and
white programs feature several
Stanford-won national championship
rings, a familiar image of leotard-clad
Beyonce and the event's theme."Put a
Ring On It."
Around 7:15, the host of the event,
jolly football player James
McGillicuddy '09 takes the stage. He
looks sharp, wearing a red and white
button-down shirt, khakis and brown
leather shoes. He energetically
recounts the success of last year's auc
tion— more than $5,000 was raised
for charity — and expresses his hope
that this year will be equally lucrative.
A former Stanford track and cross
country runner comes to the podium
and gives a brief history of Camp
Kesem. the beneficiary of the auc
tion's earnings. He discusses the
"great partnership" between Stanford
Athletics and the camp, and he rattles
off names of athletes who have been

involved with it.
"Camp Kesem is a weeklong sum
mer camp that was started by four
Stanford students and a staff member
in partnership with Hillel in 2(X)1," he
explains to the crowd.
According to the brochures hand
ed out at the event, the camp has a
philanthropic purpose — it is a week
of safety, fun and support for children
whose parents currently have, or had.
cancer. What started with just one
camp based out of Stanford has now
grown to include more than 20 differ
ent college campuses, from UCLA to
MIT.
Now that introductions are fin
ished. it's time for the auction.
McGillicuddy returns to the stage and
a team photo fills the overhead
screen. He briefly highlights the vari
ous accolades of the opening act —
the women's squash team — and
announces the prize to be auctioned
off: a barbecue with the team.
Two girls emerge from offstage
wearing black squash skirts and
sweaters, and share a brief dialogue.
Two other girls, also in uniform skirts
and white Nike tops, hop around with
rackets in hand, performing a sort of
squash-themed interpretive dance to
Enya's "Sail Away." A fifth girl, wear
ing gray sweatpants and a red jacket,
also enters the scene.
Suddenly, the peaceful music stops
and "Womanizer" by Britney Spears
fills the auditorium. The five squash
players break into a choreographed
routine, ending with a huddle.
"Women's squash!" they chant.
Hie act receives polite applause,
and McGillicuddy opens the bidding
at $50. No one bids. There is a brief
silence, and people begin to look
around expectantly.
"$5O? C'mon. It's for the kids!"

McGillicuddy urges, chuckling nerv
ously.
"We're the only West Coast
women's squash team!" chimes in one
of the five dancers.
Eventually, a girl with crutches
raises her hand, signaling her bid.'lTie
barbecue with the squash team is sold
for $50.
The evening starts off slow, with
the next team — track and cross
country— selling an "evening on the
town" for $60, just $10 over their start
ing bid.
"No one went for less than $ 1 (K)
last year," whispers Charley
Henrikson '1 l.a member of the men's
volleyball squad who participated in
last year's Athlete Date Auction.
But very quickly, the bidding picks
up. Following a riveting lip-svncing
and hip hop dance performance to
"I'm On a Boat" by The Lonely Island
and T-Pain, the sailing team auctions
off a "day spent sailing on the San
Francisco Bay with head coach John
Vandemoer and members of the cur
rent varsity team.'"l"his sells for $375.
Next is the football team, repre
sented only by McGillicuddy due to a
"big practice" earlier in the day.
"That is so unfair that they don't
have to do this," says an irked female
athlete to her friend. "There are other
sports here that are actually in season
right now."
Nonetheless, the football team
offers four field-level tickets to the
California and Notre Dame games
next season and a football signed by
the team.These also receive a notable
sum, going for $275.
The team introductions, talent
show-esque acts and subsequent bids
continue for some two hours. In total.
18 different teams — women's
squash, track and cross-country, sail

ing, football, men's and women's gym
nastics, men's and women's swim
ming, men's and women's crew, syn
chronized swimming, men's and
women's soccer, field hockey,
women's lacrosse, wrestling and men's
and women's water polo — do brief
routines.
The scantily clad men's swimming
and water polo teams — one per
forming a dance and the other, an
original rap. in only Speedos — are
crowd pleasers. The men's gymnastics
team wows the crowd with their toned
physiques and superhuman strength:
one athlete does handstand push-ups.
"Dude, you're ripped!" an envious
male yells at the gymnast.
The women's teams largely stick to
coordinated dance routines — soccer
to Sir Mix-A-Lot's "Baby Got Back,"
lacrosse to a medley of pump-up
music, swimming to "Hot Stuff" and
so on.

About two-thirds of the way
through the night, two girls, both
wearing red tank tops and jeans, are
brought onstage. Elaine Breeden '10
and Julia Smit 10 both won medals at
the Beijing Olympics and hold numer
ous other records and titles. Greeted
with rousing applause by the audi
ence. the Olympians are auctioning
themselves off for a date.
"Who can say they've been on a
date with a world record-holder?"
inquires the Cardinal Council chair
who introduces Breeden and Smit.
"Yeah, pretty cool opportunity."
McGillicuddy adds, "And if you go
on the date, you can try on the
medal!"
ITie dates with the Olympians sells
for a respectable $175.
Finally, 17 acts and two Olympians
later, the women's gymnastics team
comes out for the grand finale. They
do not fail to disappoint, performing

an impressive array of splits, flips,
handstands and leaps.
"[We're offering] a day at the
gym!" one of the gymnasts says cheer
fully. "It will be awesome. We'll do
whatever tricks you want!"
This is met by excited howls and
loud laughter from the many male
attendants in the audience. An intense
bidding war between the men's swim
ming and crew teams follows, with the
eventual prize going to crew for $300.
Around V p.m., the auction has
ended and McCiillicuddy thanks
everyone for coming.The student ath
letes and other audience members
slowly exit Dinkelspiel, pleasantly
reflecting on the evening of debauch
ery, silliness and. most importantly, a
plethora of money raised for Camp

Scantily clad members of the Stanford men's swim team dance at the Athlete Date Auction, held Sunday in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium as a fundraiser for Camp Kesem.
A thletes are everywhere. It's
/m ' ust before 7 P m - last
/ % Sunday. An overhead
/% screen on stage reads,
JL JLrWelcome to the 2009
Athlete Date Auction: A Cardinal
Council Event." A blue and green
Camp Kesem banner hangs forlornly
to the side.
The seats of Dinkelspiel
Auditorium are half-filled with vari
ous costumed freshmen from
Stanford's athletic teams — from the
red fleece robes of the men's water
polo players to the black shorts and
gold-decaled tank tops donned by the
women's swimmers — as well as
other student onlookers.
Beyonce's "Single Ladies" can be
heard faintly playing over the inces
sant chatter. The auction's black and
white programs feature several
Stanford-won national championship
rings, a familiar image of leotard-clad
Beyonce and the event's theme."Put a
Ring On It."
Around 7:15, the host of the event,
jolly football player James
McGillicuddy '09 takes the stage. He
looks sharp, wearing a red and white
button-down shirt, khakis and brown
leather shoes. He energetically
recounts the success of last year's auc
tion— more than $5,000 was raised
for charity — and expresses his hope
that this year will be equally lucrative.
A former Stanford track and cross
country runner comes to the podium
and gives a brief history of Camp
Kesem. the beneficiary of the auc
tion's earnings. He discusses the
"great partnership" between Stanford
Athletics and the camp, and he rattles
off names of athletes who have been

involved with it.
"Camp Kesem is a weeklong sum
mer camp that was started by four
Stanford students and a staff member
in partnership with Hillel in 2(X)1," he
explains to the crowd.
According to the brochures hand
ed out at the event, the camp has a
philanthropic purpose — it is a week
of safety, fun and support for children
whose parents currently have, or had.
cancer. What started with just one
camp based out of Stanford has now
grown to include more than 20 differ
ent college campuses, from UCLA to
MIT.
Now that introductions are fin
ished. it's time for the auction.
McGillicuddy returns to the stage and
a team photo fills the overhead
screen. He briefly highlights the vari
ous accolades of the opening act —
the women's squash team — and
announces the prize to be auctioned
off: a barbecue with the team.
Two girls emerge from offstage
wearing black squash skirts and
sweaters, and share a brief dialogue.
Two other girls, also in uniform skirts
and white Nike tops, hop around with
rackets in hand, performing a sort of
squash-themed interpretive dance to
Enya's "Sail Away." A fifth girl, wear
ing gray sweatpants and a red jacket,
also enters the scene.
Suddenly, the peaceful music stops
and "Womanizer" by Britney Spears
fills the auditorium. The five squash
players break into a choreographed
routine, ending with a huddle.
"Women's squash!" they chant.
Hie act receives polite applause,
and McGillicuddy opens the bidding
at $50. No one bids. There is a brief
silence, and people begin to look
around expectantly.
"$5O? C'mon. It's for the kids!"

McGillicuddy urges, chuckling nerv
ously.
"We're the only West Coast
women's squash team!" chimes in one
of the five dancers.
Eventually, a girl with crutches
raises her hand, signaling her bid.'lTie
barbecue with the squash team is sold
for $50.
The evening starts off slow, with
the next team — track and cross
country— selling an "evening on the
town" for $60, just $10 over their start
ing bid.
"No one went for less than $ 1 (K)
last year," whispers Charley
Henrikson '1 l.a member of the men's
volleyball squad who participated in
last year's Athlete Date Auction.
But very quickly, the bidding picks
up. Following a riveting lip-svncing
and hip hop dance performance to
"I'm On a Boat" by The Lonely Island
and T-Pain, the sailing team auctions
off a "day spent sailing on the San
Francisco Bay with head coach John
Vandemoer and members of the cur
rent varsity team.'"l"his sells for $375.
Next is the football team, repre
sented only by McGillicuddy due to a
"big practice" earlier in the day.
"That is so unfair that they don't
have to do this," says an irked female
athlete to her friend. "There are other
sports here that are actually in season
right now."
Nonetheless, the football team
offers four field-level tickets to the
California and Notre Dame games
next season and a football signed by
the team.These also receive a notable
sum, going for $275.
The team introductions, talent
show-esque acts and subsequent bids
continue for some two hours. In total.
18 different teams — women's
squash, track and cross-country, sail

ing, football, men's and women's gym
nastics, men's and women's swim
ming, men's and women's crew, syn
chronized swimming, men's and
women's soccer, field hockey,
women's lacrosse, wrestling and men's
and women's water polo — do brief
routines.
The scantily clad men's swimming
and water polo teams — one per
forming a dance and the other, an
original rap. in only Speedos — are
crowd pleasers. The men's gymnastics
team wows the crowd with their toned
physiques and superhuman strength:
one athlete does handstand push-ups.
"Dude, you're ripped!" an envious
male yells at the gymnast.
The women's teams largely stick to
coordinated dance routines — soccer
to Sir Mix-A-Lot's "Baby Got Back,"
lacrosse to a medley of pump-up
music, swimming to "Hot Stuff" and
so on.

About two-thirds of the way
through the night, two girls, both
wearing red tank tops and jeans, are
brought onstage. Elaine Breeden '10
and Julia Smit 10 both won medals at
the Beijing Olympics and hold numer
ous other records and titles. Greeted
with rousing applause by the audi
ence. the Olympians are auctioning
themselves off for a date.
"Who can say they've been on a
date with a world record-holder?"
inquires the Cardinal Council chair
who introduces Breeden and Smit.
"Yeah, pretty cool opportunity."
McGillicuddy adds, "And if you go
on the date, you can try on the
medal!"
ITie dates with the Olympians sells
for a respectable $175.
Finally, 17 acts and two Olympians
later, the women's gymnastics team
comes out for the grand finale. They
do not fail to disappoint, performing

an impressive array of splits, flips,
handstands and leaps.
"[We're offering] a day at the
gym!" one of the gymnasts says cheer
fully. "It will be awesome. We'll do
whatever tricks you want!"
This is met by excited howls and
loud laughter from the many male
attendants in the audience. An intense
bidding war between the men's swim
ming and crew teams follows, with the
eventual prize going to crew for $300.
Around V p.m., the auction has
ended and McCiillicuddy thanks
everyone for coming.The student ath
letes and other audience members
slowly exit Dinkelspiel, pleasantly
reflecting on the evening of debauch
ery, silliness and. most importantly, a
plethora of money raised for Camp
Kesem.
