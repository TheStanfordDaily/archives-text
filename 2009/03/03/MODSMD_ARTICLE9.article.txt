## Editorial Univ. should step up foreign language requirement 
### 
tan ford is an institution that encourages
its students to think globally. We have an
Wjimpressively diverse student body hail
ing from every corner of the planet, faculty
experts in do/ens of foreign cultures and po
litical systems and the capacity to offer stu
dents fluency in almost as many languages as
you would hear at a typical United Nations
summit. Our enormous linguistic fortune
begs the question: What good is our foreign
language requirement il it is apparently not
designed to encourage students to capitalize
>11 these resources?
The foreign language requirement of one
year of basic language study, and the abun
dance of ways students are able to effective
ly escape it,grossly underemphasi/es fluency
and maintenance of foreign language skills
lot students admitted to Stanford. Under
graduate students who pass a proficiency
exam at any time in their Stanford career are
not required to follow up ever again with a
language advisor, or even take a basic re
fresher tutorial. I ven more egregiouslv, any
one who crammed enough verb conjugations
into her or his head in high school to score
sufficiently high on an AP or S/YI II test re
ceives a free pass on the language require
ment and is never compelled to revisit for
eign language study again.
\S hile the I Jniversity does not recognize a
high school I nglish or historv class as an ac
ceptable substitute for any ol the general ed
ucation requirements, we seem willing to ac
cept that a ludimentary survey of a foreign
language in out teenage years precludes us
Irom needing to retain or enhance valuable
language skills ;is adults at an internationally
renowned and internationally engaged
university.
I"he editorial board understands that the
minimal requirements were not expressly de
signed to disqourage language study and that
man\ students and prospective freshmen ap
preciate the chance to avoid a three quarter
foreign language requirement that is a hassle
lor the uninterested to fulfill. I urthermore,
there are many sell stai ting students who il<>
opt to take a foreign language and go well be
yond the year's stuily required to graduate in

order to gain a skill they can apply to travel,
networking, job applications and relation
ship-building with people from other coun
tries. We would merely like to point out the
futility of the current language requirement
as a means of achieving any sort of meaning
ful language retention among the majority of
students. Hie editorial board would like to
challenge the University to take a bolder,
more creative approach to making foreign
language study a component of a holistic lib
eral arts education at Stanford.
Rather than imposing more placement
tests on students who place out of first-year
language classes at Stanford — a solution
which has been met with vehement and un
derstandable objection in the past — the
I Jniversity could introduce major-specific
language tutorials with relevance to specific
fields. Ihe popular Spanish for Medical Stii
dents tutorial offered periodically already
could serve as a model for tutorials in other
subjects, building a student's vocabulary and
conversation skills in engineering, computer
science or philosophy, in a foreign language
spoken by one of the professors from that
field. Picture I rancophonic history majors
learning about the Irench revolution in
I rench,or perhaps German-speaking philos
ophy students reading "The Critique of Pure
Reason" in its original form.
(iiven the international diversity of facul
ty members across the academic spectrum, it
seems highly feasible for these tutorials to be
built into the curriculum without needing to
hire more professors or greatly over-burden
departments. In a more intimate and tailored
way.students could retain and revisit foreign
language skills, and apply them to their fu
ture goals more aptly.
I his is just one way foreign language
could be re-emphasized so as not to be lost in
the shuffle. The loss to the University if we
fail to encourage a multilingual student body,
especially when the world (and job market)
is becoming increasingly globalized, is unde
niable and demands attention. I he editorial
board calls for a re-examination of the for
eign language (>IR as a Inst step toward a
worldlier Stanford.
