# The
						Voice Of Experience

In ni\ hist column. I argued that a big part
ol the problem plaguing our nation's edu
.eational system, particularly in urban and
under-performing schools, is teacher pay.
Recall my argument: I irst. the single most
important determinant of student success -
p beyond facilities.supplies and curriculum
is tcachei quality. Second, the qualifica
tions and talent required to allow an individ
ual to teach effectively in our country's most
struggling schools are significant and broad,
third, to get individuals with these kinds of
skills into the worst kind of educational envi
ronments. we need to pay them like the pro
fessionals they are.
My own experiences teaching in a public
charter school made me reali/e that it takes
an incredibly broad skill set to effectively
teach students 111 difficult educational envi
ronments I he individuals who possess these
skills tend to be our nation's top students.
ITiev are also the kind ol individuals who
make great lawyers, doctors, engineers, man
agers. professors, financiers, etc.
When we take a look at how much more
these professions pay. it is unsurprising why
our educational ssstem is starved ol our top
graduates.
for example, both the San I rancisco I Jni
lieel School District and the New York City
public schools start new teachers at about
$45,000. According to Stanford's ( arcer De
velopment Center, the 2007-200.X average
starting salar\ lot Mastei's graduates with an
engineering degree was $76,161 :and for Mas
ter's graduates with a humanities degree, it
was $63.05 l ). I veil education Master s gradu
ates averaged $59,420 I'm guessing most
ol them went into research,administration or
richer school districts.
And il we look at ongoing, rather than
starting salaries, the picture is just as bad. Ac
cording to the American federation ol leach
cis. the average salarv for traditional public
school teachers in 2<X>6 2007 was $51.(KW. My
comparison, the average salary for a sample
ol 2.* comparable professional occupations
was over $71.(MX), a $20,000 gap.
It can be argued that teacher's salaries are

higher than they seem, because teachers have
the summer oil. Hut even if we adjust the
salaries upwards by 20 percent, they still fall
well short, finally, when we consider that
graduates at top schools, who go into highly
paid professions, can earn hundreds of thou
sands a year after becoming established in
their field, that $51,009 average teacher's
salary starts to look painfully meager.
So how do we get our top professionals
into our most needy classrooms? 'ITie answer
is to pay them as professionals. Anecdotally. I
know that there are tons of well-meaning
young people out there who would love to go
into teaching il il afforded them a modestly
affluent lifestyle, instead of one that was mod
estly squalid. I myself might still be teaching
at that charter school if the pay hadn't been so
low that I was actually eating into my savings
while working there.
II salaries for classroom teachers were es
sentiallv doubled so they started at. say.
$Â«S().(HH) and increased to. sa\. $130,000 over
twenty years. I believe the dynamic of staffing
our schools.even the most difficult, would in
stantly and dramatically change.
()ur top college graduates, instead of claw
ing their wa\ over each other into positions at
(ioldman Sachs, would instead beat a path to
the doors of our schools. I hey would eagerly
obtain the best certification or graduate
preparation needed to obtain these teaching
positions, without having to be forced by leg
islation like No ('hild I .elt Behind.
In short, they would act as individuals do
when competing for legal, medical, technical,
financial or almost all non teaching profes
sional roles.
I inally. note that I'm not talking about
merit pay, where the very best teachers get a
few thousand extra, or even $10,000 or
$20,000 extra litis is too fraught with imple
mentation problems.and more importantly it
won't solve the problem of professionalizing
teaching. I'm talking about systemic change
and across the-hoard pay raises. (()nce that's
accomplished, we can still look at bonuses for
