# The 						Voice Of Experience
## David Goldbrenner Its the salaries, stupid-part II 
### 
In ni\ hist column. I argued that a big part
ol the problem plaguing our nation's edu
.eational system, particularly in urban and
under-performing schools, is teacher pay.
Recall my argument: I irst. the single most
important determinant of student success -
p beyond facilities.supplies and curriculum
is tcachei quality. Second, the qualifica
tions and talent required to allow an individ
ual to teach effectively in our country's most
struggling schools are significant and broad,
third, to get individuals with these kinds of
skills into the worst kind of educational envi
ronments. we need to pay them like the pro
fessionals they are.
My own experiences teaching in a public
charter school made me reali/e that it takes
an incredibly broad skill set to effectively
teach students 111 difficult educational envi
ronments I he individuals who possess these
skills tend to be our nation's top students.
ITiev are also the kind ol individuals who
make great lawyers, doctors, engineers, man
agers. professors, financiers, etc.
When we take a look at how much more
these professions pay. it is unsurprising why
our educational ssstem is starved ol our top
graduates.
for example, both the San I rancisco I Jni
lieel School District and the New York City
public schools start new teachers at about
$45,000. According to Stanford's ( arcer De
velopment Center, the 2007-200.X average
starting salar\ lot Mastei's graduates with an
engineering degree was $76,161 :and for Mas
ter's graduates with a humanities degree, it
was $63.05 l ). I veil education Master s gradu
ates averaged $59,420 I'm guessing most
ol them went into research,administration or
richer school districts.
And il we look at ongoing, rather than
starting salaries, the picture is just as bad. Ac
cording to the American federation ol leach
cis. the average salarv for traditional public
school teachers in 2<X>6 2007 was $51.(KW. My
comparison, the average salary for a sample
ol 2.* comparable professional occupations
was over $71.(MX), a $20,000 gap.
It can be argued that teacher's salaries are

higher than they seem, because teachers have
the summer oil. Hut even if we adjust the
salaries upwards by 20 percent, they still fall
well short, finally, when we consider that
graduates at top schools, who go into highly
paid professions, can earn hundreds of thou
sands a year after becoming established in
their field, that $51,009 average teacher's
salary starts to look painfully meager.
So how do we get our top professionals
into our most needy classrooms? 'ITie answer
is to pay them as professionals. Anecdotally. I
know that there are tons of well-meaning
young people out there who would love to go
into teaching il il afforded them a modestly
affluent lifestyle, instead of one that was mod
estly squalid. I myself might still be teaching
at that charter school if the pay hadn't been so
low that I was actually eating into my savings
while working there.
II salaries for classroom teachers were es
sentiallv doubled so they started at. say.
$«S().(HH) and increased to. sa\. $130,000 over
twenty years. I believe the dynamic of staffing
our schools.even the most difficult, would in
stantly and dramatically change.
()ur top college graduates, instead of claw
ing their wa\ over each other into positions at
(ioldman Sachs, would instead beat a path to
the doors of our schools. I hey would eagerly
obtain the best certification or graduate
preparation needed to obtain these teaching
positions, without having to be forced by leg
islation like No ('hild I .elt Behind.
In short, they would act as individuals do
when competing for legal, medical, technical,
financial or almost all non teaching profes
sional roles.
I inally. note that I'm not talking about
merit pay, where the very best teachers get a
few thousand extra, or even $10,000 or
$20,000 extra litis is too fraught with imple
mentation problems.and more importantly it
won't solve the problem of professionalizing
teaching. I'm talking about systemic change
and across the-hoard pay raises. (()nce that's
accomplished, we can still look at bonuses for
particularly outstanding teachers,
hut for now it's a red herring.)
There are several arguments
against this.The first is likely to come
from conservative think tanks or
from those who have never set foot
in a classroom and think all teachers
have easy lives with free summers
spent frolicking with bunnies, and
therefore deserve their low salaries.
For example, if you Google "teacher
pay", the second link is an article
from our very own Hoover Institu
tion arguing that teacher pay is actu
ally commensurate with other pro
fessions when adjusted for the short

er work year and a few other factors.
I"his conflicts with the data 1 pre
sented above,and I would like to see
their calculation of an average pro
fessional's salary. But even if we as
sume their figures are correct, they
are missing a fundamental point:
The question is not whether, when
calculated on an hourly basis, a
teacher is making roughly the same
as the actuary next door. The ques
tion is. what do we need to pay to get
really good teachers into the class
room?
This leads to the second and
more important objection: that the
money simply isn't there to double
teachers' salaries. For example, k-12
education is already 30.2 percent of
California's 2008-2009 budget.
One approach to mitigate the
cost increase would be to implement

the pay raises in "concentric circles."
The innermost circle would be the
neediest schools, and the salary
changes would move outward to
more affluent school districts. The
best public schools are highly desir
able to teach in. and would not rc
quire as much of an increase to keep
really good teachers there.
In fact, it might even be better to
have more desirable schools pay
somewhat less, to prevent them from
continuously drawing the best teach
ers from more difficult environs.
But eventually, we are going to
have to cough up more money to put
our best in the classroom in front of
our kids. It's a crying shame we
haven't vet.

more important objection: that the
money simply isn't there to double
teachers' salaries. For example, k-12
education is already 30.2 percent of
California's 2008-2009 budget.
One approach to mitigate the
cost increase would be to implement

the pay raises in "concentric circles."
The innermost circle would be the
neediest schools, and the salary
changes would move outward to
more affluent school districts. The
best public schools are highly desir
able to teach in. and would not rc
quire as much of an increase to keep
really good teachers there.
In fact, it might even be better to
have more desirable schools pay
somewhat less, to prevent them from
continuously drawing the best teach
ers from more difficult environs.
But eventually, we are going to
have to cough up more money to put
our best in the classroom in front of
our kids. It's a crying shame we
haven't vet.
