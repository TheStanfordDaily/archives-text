# Too Big to Fail
## Baby, you can drive my car 
### 
We ;ill know about biking at Stanford:
Among our almost 15,000 students,
we have over 12.0(H) bikes! (irad stu
dents wear bike helmets! Iliis roundabout,
right next to the cloek tower, was formerly
known as the Intersection of Death, but now
isn't beeause we are all super-eautious and
never running late for anything!
Which is all well and good — it makes
sense. Hut the other, less-celebrated form of
private transportation at Stanford remains
veiled in contradiction and mystery.
I speak, of course, of the practice of stu
dents owning cars at Stanford — an absurd
and rather Borgesian situation that defies :tll
logic of space, time and integrity.
Were I a math major or a string theorist.
I'm sure I would understand it. Alas, as a hu
manities major, all I do is weep and write sen
tence fragments in moleskin notebooks.
There are three major paradoxes in the
way we drive on campus. I irst off. 50 percent
of upperclassmen, including myself, own cars.
What. I ask. do we actually use them for?
Stanford students have little time to do any
thing cool off-campus, but having a car at our
disposal allows us to imagine that we could, if
we really wanted to.
In my mind. I use my car for culturally en
riching museum trips, job interviews and off
campus community service. In reality, I use it
for Savers expeditions. BevMo runs and raid
ing mv parents' fridge (this is real talk,folks).
ITius. my car is a symbol of myself, both as
I am and as I aspire to he — a benchmark of
my personal growth, or lack thereof.This is a
great reason for everyone to own a set of
wheels, especially considering the existence
of a free shuttle service all across campus.
I Tie second car-related paradox at Stan
ford is parking.
Whether or not Stanford's campus actual
ly is the second-largest in the world — be
cause Wikipedia.Ask.com and Stanford Visi
tor Information Services, three of the most
reputable sources of information out there,
give me three different answers to this query,
my integrity as a journalist prevents me from

contending one way or the other — you've
got to admit that our school is fairly gargantu
an.
Indeed, Brodie Hamilton, the director of
Stanford Parking and Transportation Ser
vices. avowed that "Stanford has over 22.000
parking spaces. On a typical day. there are less
than IN.OOO cars parked." As a fun side note,
he estimated that 12.000 of these cars belong
to faculty, staff and student commuters. 5.000
belong to (mostly student) residents and
around 600 to 1.000 belong to visitors.
Mr. Hamilton also very nicely sent me a
map showing where all this mysterious park
ing is located. Answer: LroSoCo. Which
would be fine, were I not a child of the Inter
net Age. bored by and indifferent to anything
other than instant gratification. T he idea of
walking for 15 minutes to drive for 10 is illog
ical even tome. I could just bike.but I'd rather
complain.
The third automotive absurdity at Stan
ford is of an ideological nature. Like being
Spider-man. having a car on Stanford's cam
pus confers both great power and great re
sponsibility. Students who own cars must eon
tend with the wrath of our eco-friendly
friends who would never dream of being so
selfish as to own a car. yet never miss an op
portunity to ask us for a ride to Whole I-bods.
Locally farmed blueberries for everyone!
Just as President Obama once spoke of
those Americans who. in fear and ignorance,
cling to "guns and religion." I now bashfully
identify myself among those Stanford stu
dents who, swept away by delusion of
grandeur and independence.cling to our cars.
We know that most of the time wi don't real
ly need them. We also know tlh.i. based on
both the parking crunch on campus and the
precariousness state of the environment in
general, we shouldn't all have them. So what?
I would encourage all of us to ditch our
cars — provided we keep around that one
eco-indifferent friend who will drive us to In-
N-()ut. But since I know thai I'll never do it. I
highly suspect that you won't either.
T he best solution I can offer to this mad-

The idea of walking for
15 minutes to drive for
10 is illogical even to
me. I could just bike,
but I'd rather complain.

ness. I lien, is for us to at least consider car
pooling whenever possible. l ast week I
talked with John Zimmer. COO and founder
of Zimride.an ingenious little service that uti
lizes Facebook to let you superficially judge
strangers based on their favorite television
shows and quotes before you commit to
spend several hours trapped in a confined
space with them. (Zimmer also assured me
that his company, which I'm guessing is named
after him. doubles as great dating service.)
Zipcar is another option. v\hich l'\e heard de
scribed as "fairly sweet." I'll never use it. but
you should.
And of course, there also is the Marguerite.
It does run at times other than I'ub Night.
Or biking.
