# The 						Wanderer
## Eulogy for a newspaper 
### 
Before last I ridav. it had been a while
since I actually cried. But on Friday,
mv hometown newspaper died. Hie
Denver-based Rocky Mountain News was
founded on April 23. 1859 and it shut down
for good on Feb. 27,2009.Tw0 more months,
and it would have been 150 years old.
I ike many newspapers across the coun
try. I he Rocky was in deep financial trouble,
operating at an annual loss of millions of dol
lars. Its parent company. F..W. Scripps. had
been trying for months to find a buyer and
ultimately could not.
I ortunatelv. Denver was not left newspa
pei less.The other major newspaper in town,
the Denver Post.is losing money at the same
rate, but lias yet to close down its owners
perhaps hoping that, without a competitor, it
may be able to turn things around.
I he Post's survival is of little comfort to
most «>! those who had lost their jobs at The
Rocky. (hit of more than 200 news and edi
torial employees.only 11 have been hired by
Ihe Post. Already, both papers had a joint
operating agreement in which advertising
and circulation were run out of the same of
fice and printing facilities were shared.
II I he Post is still alive (for now), why am
I so sad? I'here are many other places, one
might say. where the lone newspaper in town
is lacing the same possibility of collapse. I os
Angeles, ol all places, has seen the I A.
l imes cut its news staff in half.
Much of my sorrow is purely and
unashamedly sentimental. The Rocky was
always the paper I considered to be mine. We
got it at home, and in second grade I started
reading the comics every day. eventually ex
panding to the whole paper. I his routine of
comics in the morning and everything else
after school was my Inst foray into the fine
ait ol procrastination to avoid homework
Interestingly, the first letter to the editor I

ever wrote was to defend some of my teach
ers amid sweeping criticism of the serious
problems in Denver Public Schools.
File Rocky also had deep ties to my fami
ly. Decades earlier, the paper gave extensive
coverage to my aunt Katie when she won the
National Spelling Bee. She eventually be
came a writer at the paper, where she met
her husband. Cyrus, a photographer who
would be part of a Rocky team that won a
Pulitzer for its coverage ot the Columbine
high school shootings in 1999.
Though Cyrus moved to I lie Post several
years ago. Katie and my other aunt, her sister
Anne, were still working at I lie Rocky when
it closed. Sensing what was coming. Anne, i
copy editor, took me with her to the office
over winter break so that I could see the
news room while it was still operational. As
we stood on a balcony looking out at the
Christmas lights below in downtown Den
ver.shc said something like."We don't know
what's going to happen, but we just keep get
ting the paper ready to come out tomorrow."
112 inally, last week, they were told to stop.
And that's when the torrents ot tears began.
"Don't feel sorry for us — feel sorry lor
Denver, for Colorado. You may not nuss us
now. but you will most certainly miss us
later." wrote Rob Reuteman, Ihe Rocky's
business editor in Ins farewell column.
"There will be many nooks and crannies
around this town that won't see the light ol
day any more." he continued. "It will be
somewhat easier for all manner ol crooks to
prosper. Corruption at all levels of govern
meiit will grow some. Politicians will escape
embarrassment. Businesses will hoodwink
their employees and shareholders. More tax
payer money will be wasted. Ami far fewer
people will be looking out loi you."
11 ere. at the start ol campus election sea
son noted by the vast increase in unso

licitcd email it's worth thinking about
what a newspaper does lor a community. As
usual. Die Daily itsell will go on the ballot
and request help from students. And. as
usual,many students will vote against it. say
ing it is error-ridden, too liberal, never read,
liist sucks or any variety of other complaints
making it not worth a few dollars a quarter.
11l is year, more than any other. I urge you to
reconsider.
Ihe Daily is not perfect. Its writers and ed
itors are full time students paid almost noth
ing for the large amounts of time they spend
working there. With I lie Daily's own loss of
ad revenue by far its major funding source
all staff may soon truly be just volunteers.
Hie Daily makes mistakes. It gets things
wrong on occasion. It hires crappy opinion
columnists like me (though we are unpaid).
But consider the death of I lie Rocky Moun
tain News before voting against ITie Daily.
Without it. "There will be far fewer people
looking out for you."
I he Daily questions both the administra
tion and student government. It promotes
the accomplishments of students, professors
and staff, and also airs their opinions. It re
views and announces student performances
and covers athletics. It tries to entertain.
When voting for special fees, maybe none
ol the above is worth the cost to you. Maybe
in a recession those few dollars a month add
up. Or buy you extra Starbucks But what
other student organi/atii >n covers as broad a
spectrum in building community and in
forming the campus'.' I will be voting lor spe
cial fees for many groups, which all add
something to the campus community. But
none is as irreplaceable as our newspaper.
It is possible that I am biased.

\tii Intel's trim for lite Roeky and Denver are
real ('onsole him <n wHkersonQ' sianford.ethi.
