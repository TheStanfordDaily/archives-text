# CHRIS DERRICK '12
## ON THE FAST TRACK 
### 
The Stanford track and field locker room is adorned
with four poster boards, each representing a cross
country national championship. Four national titles in
one of the most dynamic collegiate sports pay tribute
to the tradition of Stanford running. But for freshman phenom
Chris Derrick, four is a lonely number.
"We really want to have one. two or three of our own

up there bv the time I graduate," Derrick said.
"We want to get to there. We want to recreate

the dominance Stanford had in the distance
community."
As the 2008 Gatorade Cross Country

Runner of the Year. Derrick appears to
have been horn running. But if you ask
him, he'll dispel that myth pretty quick-

ly.
"I played basketball and baseball
in middle school," Derrick re-

called. "I wasn't quick. I wasn't
strong and I couldn't jump
very high. I realized my days

in those sports were num

bered."
It was at this point
that Chris' parents
were told of a summer
camp for cross coun
try â€” a sport he want
ed no part of. at first.

"I thought it was
going to be stupid." Der
rick said. "But I actually en
joyed it.The rest, as they say. is

history."
And what a history it has
become. As a high school
competitor at Ncuqua Valley
High School in the Chicago

suburbs. Derrick was domi
nant. He led his team to the

Nike Team National Cham
pionship in his senior sea
son. and qualified for the
Footlocker Individual
National Championship.

"We won the Nike Team Nationals in my senior year," Der
rick said. "That was pretty sweet."
The highlight of his illustrious high school career came
when he completed a 5k in 13:55, which ranked as the sixth
best all-time mark in high school history. Members of the glob
al running community recognized his excellence, which would
have easily gained him top honors in years past. But 2008

turned out to be an exception.

The runners from the Class of 2008 were considered
by many to form the best class in recruiting history. Der
rick is quick to turn the attention to his freshmen peers,
whom he believes deserve the utmost recognition.

"1 was top-10 all time in the SK. and we had three
other guys that went sub-8:50 in the two-mile, which is
unheard of," Derrick said. "And then, [German] Fer-

nandez [from Oklahoma State] has the world indoor
junior record for the mile, and the American junior
record for the 3k. indoor or outdoor. Beyond that.

there is another guy that ran 4:01 in the mile in high
school."
"Those guys are my natural rivals," he con
tinued."lt's just something that is hound to happen. I

do feel a little hit of pressure to beat them, but you
have to have respect for people that are really good."
Stanford was always the first choice for Derrick, who
had his sights set on Palo Alto from the moment the
first recruiting letters began to arrive.This season, he
led the Cardinal to a third-place finish at the NCAA
Cross Country Championships, finishing in seventh

place overall. Derrick said that he has enjoyed the
adjustment from high school to collegiate running.

"Training-wise, 1 have a bunch of people to
train with all the time.and we all work out on a sim
ilar level," Derrick said. "On the racing side, the
fields are more competitive, and people take a much
longer time to drop. And when you drop them, it is

never by as much. Everything's in doubt until the last
kilometer or so of the race."

As the indoor track and field season draws to a close.
Derrick and his Cardinal teammates are poised for success.
"We have 10 guys who have broken nine minutes for
the two-mile in high school or have made [the Footlocker
National Championships] in the freshman and sophomore
classes alone," Derrick said. "That's the standard for a real
ly good runner. We have top recruits, and we definitely have
the tools and the coaching and the environment."
This environment has allowed for Derrick to progress as a
runner. He has already qualified for the NCAA Champi
onships and the World Junior Cross Country Champi
onships, which will take place in late March in Jordan, 112 or
Derrick, the latter opportunity gives him the chance to prove
himself on a global level.
"This is my first time ever representing the U.S.. which is
very cool," Derrick said. "It will also be my first time testing
myself against non-Americans. I've grown up in the insulated
bubble of American running, so it's time to see how I stack up
on the world stage."
