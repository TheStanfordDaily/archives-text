on Saturday, it beat the No. 7 Bruins by the same
score. Both matches came down to the final singles
match after the teams were tied at 3-3. and both
days Stanford came out victorious. The matches

however.The actual conference matches will take
place in a few weeks when the L.A.-based schools

After struggling to win the doubles point in the
last three matches against highly ranked oppo
nents, the Cardinal needed to turn around its dou
bles game in order to have a good shot at winning.

the doubles point on both days, which were both

up a win at No. 2. and freshman Bradley Klahn and
sophomore Ted Kelly won at No. 3 to give the Car
dinal the 1-0 lead.
The Trojans would not give up. though, as they
came right out and won at No. 6 singles to tie the
match. Wins by Bruch and Wire at No. 4 and 5 sin
gles. respectively, put the Cardinal back on top, 3-
1. Sophomore Alex Clayton then fell to Farah. the
No. 3 singles player in the country, to pull USC
back into the contest, as his doubles partner Steve

Johnson heat Thacher at No. 3 for USC to tic it at
three apiece. It was up to Klahn at No. 2 singles,
and the freshman won a third-set tiebreak to seal
Stanford's victory.
Against UCLA, the Cardinal went with the
same doubles lineup. It worked again, as both the
No. I and No. 2 teams won their doubles matches
easily,giving Stanford the 1-0 lead.
In singles, the Card started a bit slowly, with
U( I .A capturing wins at No. 3 and No. 6 singles to
