# WBC is great in theory, but not in reality

### 
Let me ask you this: With the
second-ever World Baseball
Classic starting tomorrow,
who's excited?
Not me.
This isn't to say I don't love base
hall. because I do. In fact. I find the
lead-up to the Major League Base
hall season to be the most exciting
time of the year.
For me. there are just too many
shortcomings with the WBC. It is a
meager attempt at finding an inter
national competition in baseball
since the sport was booted from the
Olympics in 2005 (the 2008
Olympics were the final games held
with baseball).
Baseball was removed from
Olympic competition, in large part,
over anger on behalf of the Interna
tional Olympic Committee at Major
League Baseball preventing its
players from participating in what is
supposed to be a collection of the
greatest athletes in the participating
sports.
The problem with the WBC is
that it still has many of the problems
that Olympic baseball possessed
when it existed. The best players
aren't compelled to play, and the
rules of baseball are altered for fear
of injury. In essence, it does not
achieve the goal of figuring out
which country is the best at baseball,
nor does it serve as compelling en
tertainment.
Yesterday, the New York Yan
kees scrimmaged Team USA, and to
be perfectly honest, even though the
United States won 6-5, I may have
taken the Yankees starting lineup
over that of Team USA. Mark Teix
iera. clearly the best American first
baseman in baseball, was in the Yan
kees lineup, not the American line
up.
1 he I Jnited States is supposed to
be the center of the baseball uni
verse and have more baseball talent
than any other nation. Yet players
on its roster include Matt I indstrom
and Joel Hanrahan. I would be very
impressed if any of you readers can
say much of anything about either of
those pitchers.
