# WBC is great in theory, but not in reality
## 
### 
Let me ask you this: With the
second-ever World Baseball
Classic starting tomorrow,
who's excited?
Not me.
This isn't to say I don't love base
hall. because I do. In fact. I find the
lead-up to the Major League Base
hall season to be the most exciting
time of the year.
For me. there are just too many
shortcomings with the WBC. It is a
meager attempt at finding an inter
national competition in baseball
since the sport was booted from the
Olympics in 2005 (the 2008
Olympics were the final games held
with baseball).
Baseball was removed from
Olympic competition, in large part,
over anger on behalf of the Interna
tional Olympic Committee at Major
League Baseball preventing its
players from participating in what is
supposed to be a collection of the
greatest athletes in the participating
sports.
The problem with the WBC is
that it still has many of the problems
that Olympic baseball possessed
when it existed. The best players
aren't compelled to play, and the
rules of baseball are altered for fear
of injury. In essence, it does not
achieve the goal of figuring out
which country is the best at baseball,
nor does it serve as compelling en
tertainment.
Yesterday, the New York Yan
kees scrimmaged Team USA, and to
be perfectly honest, even though the
United States won 6-5, I may have
taken the Yankees starting lineup
over that of Team USA. Mark Teix
iera. clearly the best American first
baseman in baseball, was in the Yan
kees lineup, not the American line
up.
1 he I Jnited States is supposed to
be the center of the baseball uni
verse and have more baseball talent
than any other nation. Yet players
on its roster include Matt I indstrom
and Joel Hanrahan. I would be very
impressed if any of you readers can
say much of anything about either of
those pitchers.


Daniel
Bohm
Of course. Lindstrom and I lanra
han aren't the best relief pitchers
America has to offer. Instead, two of
our nation's best relievers. Joe
Nathan and B.J. Ryan, pulled out of
the tournament for fear of injury.
The case of Albert Pujols is even
more egregious. The Domincan Re
public had the potential to boast a
lineup that included Pujols. Alex
Rodriguez. Hanley Ramirez and
David Ortiz.That may actually have
been worth watching. Pujols, how
ever, cannot find an insurance com
pany to cover his participation in
the tournament because of a nag
ging elbow injury, so he will not be
playing.
This is supposed to be a display of
the greatest baseball players in the
world and that is what keeps ar
guably the best player in the last
half-decade from participating? In
addition, players like Mariano
Rivera won't be playing for Pana
ma. nor will Johan Santana take the

hill for Venezuela.
It is also difficult for an American
audience to embrace the baseball of
the WBC. Ilie inaugural champi
onship game in 2006 was played be
tween Japan and Cuba, which meant
that only a handful of players on the
field were recognizable to the
American audience.
In addition, because of the fear of
injury, pitchers are limited in how
many pitches they can throw, which
completely alters conventional
baseball strategy. When Jake Peavy
takes the hill in the United States'
opening game against Canada, he is
required to exit the game after just
65 pitches. He will be lucky if he
pitches three innings.
1 low can one discern which team
is best if players' abilities are being
limited?
One additional problem with the
way the tournament is set up is the
way in which players are permitted
to plav for multiple countries.
Nineteen of the members of the
Italian team were born in the Unit
ed States. It seems as if all you need
is a name ending in a vowel,and you
can play for Italy.
This is. of course, a larger mani-

festation of the controversy sur
rounding Alex Rodriguez playing
for the Dominican Republic.
Rodriguez is the only member of
Team Dominicana to be born in the
United States — although he did
spend some of his youth in the Do
minican Republic — and he of
course played for the U.S. in the pre
vious WBC.
Allowing a player to choose what
country he identifies with, so long as
he has some heritage in that country,
seems to undermine the goal of find
ing out which country breeds the
best baseball talent.
If a player grows up in the U.S.. is
trained by American coaches and
has played on American fields, he is
an American baseball player, peri
od.
Until these problems are recon
ciled. all the WBC will be is a
sideshow that delays the beginning
of the MLB season and detracts
from team unity during Spring
Training.

Dan Bohm needs a name change so he
can play for the Italian baseball team.
