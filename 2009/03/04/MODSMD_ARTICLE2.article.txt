## Senate passes community ctr. resolution Senators argue over separation from other budget priorities 
### MARISA LANDICHO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Alter some initial hesitation, the
Undergraduate Senate unanimously approved
a resolution to support community centers
during Tuesday night's meeting. Next week,
similar resolutions in support of sustainability,

"The fact that these people made an effort
to provide us with this information means that
we should pass this resolution." Icasiano said.
