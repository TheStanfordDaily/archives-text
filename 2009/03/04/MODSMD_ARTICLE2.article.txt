## Senate passes community ctr. resolution Senators argue over separation from other budget priorities 
### MARISA LANDICHO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Alter some initial hesitation, the
Undergraduate Senate unanimously approved
a resolution to support community centers
during Tuesday night's meeting. Next week,
similar resolutions in support of sustainability,
mental health, academics and the arts are
expected to be considered by the body.
The new Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education (VPIJE) budget, which will make
the final decision as to what programs will be
cut. is expected to be released this month.
Prompted by both constituent concerns
and a direct presentation by student leaders to
the Senate on Feb. 17. the Senate resolution
further explained the necessity and value of
community centers.
Purposely avoiding specifics, it echoed the
advocacy letter released by the ASSU
Executives at the end of January, which named
community centers, mental health, academies
and frontline staff as the top four priorities.
"We're looking for a statement of solidari
ty." said Melissa Morales '09. who spoke on
behalf of community centers two weeks ago
and also defended the resolution last night.
Although present Senators approved the
message of the resolution, some worried that a
separate resolution on community centers
would de-legitimize previous budget advocacy
efforts by the ASSU.
"Once we start passing a bunch of resolu
tions about separate things, the idea of having
some kind of coherent recommendation by
the student body has fallen apart and implod
ed." said Senator L.uukas lives '09, who is a
Daily columnist. Moreover, he reiterated the
troubling precedent of passing resolutions for
any group that gave a presentation.
Moth Senators Yvorn "Doc" Aswad-
Thomas'l I and Herwin Icasiano' 10, however,
believed that the presenters' efforts should be
recognized and a resolution would not under
mine the other three priorities.
"The fact that these people made an effort
to provide us with this information means that
we should pass this resolution." Icasiano said.
ASSU Vice President l agan Harris "(I 1 ) also
sided with the community center representa
tives. While the ASSIJ's previous four priori-
ties have already been made clear
to Provost John Etchemendy,
Harris said the active student con
cern for community centers should
be channeled into a resolution.
lives and Senator Stuart
Baimel '09, also a Daily columnist,
preferred to table the bill for next
week and vote on all the similar
budget resolutions at the same
lime. Both, though, supported the
main idea behind the community
center resolution.
Following discussion, the reso
lution passed 10-0 with two sena
tors absent.
On previous notice for next
week are resolutions covering the
remaining three priorities origi
nally established, along with bills
for sustainability and the arts.
At last night's meeting, Lauren
Finzer '09, co-president of Students
for a Sustainable Stanford present
ed a sustainability bill to the
Senate, which called the University
to set a concrete goal for reduction
of emissions.
The Senate also heard a pres
entation from Charlie Syms '11,
who proposed creating a queer
studies track through the feminist
studies program. Citing the cur
rent related course offerings and
the existing structure already in
place, Syms said the track would
not cost a substantial amount of
money.
"Historically at Stanford, cul
tural studies has come from stu
dent pressure," he said. "The only
way that queer studies will come
is through students saying, 'We
want this.'"
The Senate was receptive to the
idea and various senators volun
teered to help draft a resolution.
