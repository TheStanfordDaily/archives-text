# RICE ENGAGES CRITICS
## Daily exclusive interview "...every day after Sept. 11 was Sept. 12, and that was until the day we left" 
### ANDREA FULLER KAMIL DADA 
Condoleezza Rice officially returned to
Stanford just this week, but the political sei
ence professor already appears at home in
her Hoover Institution office. Her shelves
are neatly organized, displaying auto
graphed footballs, photos of Rice with
world leaders and even a model of the USS
Condoleezza Rice.
The former Secretary of State and
National Security Advisor is confident that
she will have a smooth transition back to
the Farm. In an exclusive interview with The
Daily yesterday, Rice displayed poise and
composure, and she dismissed student con

cerns about the Bush administration's
authorization of harsh interrogation meth
ods.
In April 2008. ABC News reported that
senior White I louse officials, including Rice,
approved "enhanced interrogation tech
niques" such as waterboarding. Hie news
outlet reported that Rice told the CIA.
" This is your baby. Go do it." Rice later pub
licly admitted to the Senate that these dis
cussions took place, although she declined
to go into detail about her own positions.
Some campus activists believe this news
is evidence that Rice supported torture, and
they suggest that she does not belong at
Stanford as a result. (See "Few equate Rice.
Rumsfeld" in the Feb. 23 issue of The

— CONDOLEEZZA RICE

Daily.) Rice was unfazed and steady in
responding to these allegations, and empha
sized multiple times that the administration
repeatedly ensured that its actions were
legal and in accordance with U.S. treaty
responsibilities.
"I think it would have been unusual if
there had not been discussions at the high
est levels of government about what we
were going to do in a post-y/11 environ
ment." she said. "The one thing that I am
absolutely confident of and certain of in my
own mind, is that we did what we thought
was necessary, but also what we believed
was legal."
Though Rice primarily emphasized that
the harsh interrogation techniques were

fully legal, she also dismissed the argument
that these techniques were immoral. She
pointed out how it may he hard for some
people to understand what it was like to be
in a position of authority after Sept. 11.
"When your highest responsibility is to
protect the country and save innocent lives
in the wake of a time when I had to watch
Americans jump out of 80-story windows
on the day that the towers were attacked,
then I think that you have an obligation to
do what is legal and necessary." she said.
"You have a moral responsibility as well,
not to let Americans die unnecessarily."
"For us, those of us who were in respon
sible positions," she added, "every day after
Sept. 11 was Sept. 12. and that was until the
day we left."
Rice, however, carefully sidestepped
questions about whether she personally
supported or raised moral objections about
the use of any harsh interrogation tech
niques. refusing to comment on "'internal
deliberations in the administration."
She also declined to state whether she
thought waterboarding was a form of cruel
and usual punishment, simply noting that
the President told his advisors only to
authorize interrogation methods that were
legal, within U.S. treaty obligations and not
forms of torture. When pressed again about
whether waterboarding was cruel and
unusual. Rice responded, "Obviously any
thing that we authorized was in the context
of our treaty obligations and within the
law."
Rice was similarly careful not to openly
condemn President Obama's decision to
roll back the harsh interrogation methods
and close Guantanamo Bay and CIA pris
ons, though she noted the rising debate over
the difficulty of safely closing Guantanamo.
Even while serving in the Bush administra
tion. Rice said she had been an advocate for
closing the prison if it could be done safely.
"Yes. it was not a luxury hotel, but it was.
I think, a well-run facility," she said of
Guantanamo. "But people now recognize
there are very dangerous people there."
Rice framed other conflicts that arose
during her term as Secretary of State in
moral terms. She recalled meeting raped
and battered women in Darfur and called it
"the hardest thing I did as Secretary." Rice
said that while the U.S. did everything it
could to assuage the situation, bar military
action, she was disappointed with the
results.
Rice also framed the Iraq war in moral

Condoleezza Rice was in her Hoover office yesterday after her official return on March 2. Rice's office was already set up with sports
memorabilia, pictures with world leaders, a model of the USS Condoleezza Rice, and other memorable objects from her time in office
as National Security Advisor and Secretary of State for the Bush administration.
terms, recalling the 3(K).(KK) civilians
buried in mass graves during Saddam
Hussein's rule. She also questioned
the morality of letting Iraqis starve
under economic sanctions.
"How can you say you cared
about human rights, and you let
Saddam Hussein stay in power, put
ting his people in mass graves, using
weapons of mass destruction against
his own people and his own neigh
bors?" she asked.
She did draw distinctions between
Iraq and Darfur. however, in explain
ing the Hush administration's decision
to forego military action in Darfur.
Rice cited America's history of war
with Iraq to explain this decision, and
noted that Darfur's situation was
more complex because of the involve
ment of rebels and ethnic conflict.
Rice isn't fazed by students who
disagree with her political actions and
opinions, however, and hopes that
they both recognize her history of
affiliation with the University and
welcome differing opinions.
"1 would just say know your facts,
and try to actually look at the circum
stances that produced certain deci
sions," she said.
"It's interesting that some of the
very polices that are being protested
have now produced circumstances in
Afghanistan or in Iraq that people
can protest." Rice added. "If some
body had protested in Iraq under
Saddam Hussein, if somebody had
thrown a shoe at a visiting leader
under Saddam Hussein. I don't think
they would have survived."
'ITie former Secretary of State also
said she was open to discussing these
issues with students, including her
critics, as long as the engagement was
respectful. She said that she previous
ly enjoyed visiting dorms as a profes
sor and as provost, and hopes to con
tinue the practice.
"I think we have to have in demo
cratic circumstances respectful
engagement." Rice said. "It should
not be confrontational. It doesn't help
anybody to have confrontation, but
I'm willing to talk about the decisions
that we made and the difficulty of
those decisions under the c;rcum
stances."
When not around the discussion
table, "You will see me at sports, def
initely," Rice added.
Students, however, will not see her
in the classroom right away, as Rice
plans to focus on writing her mem
oirs. Rice said that she would resume
teaching undergraduate classes as

early as the next academic year, most
likely by winter quarter. While she
was unsure of her projected course
content, she explained that she
looked forward to teaching through
decision simulations, much as she did
in the past.
Rice said she fully believed that
through her teaching, she could step
back and teach in an analytical way
that isn't biased.
"1 won't say that I won't have
strong views about what we did
obviously 1 was a part of [it] — but I
think that it will be good for people to
have a chance to engage in some of
these very controversial issues," she
said. "The only thing I would ask is
that in a democracy, it's important
that you engage really respecting still
the integrity of the people and not
question their motives."
She added that she was not per
sonallv hurt bv criticisms of those

who feel her image was compromised
by her time in Washington, and that
the nature of universities was to
debate controversial issues.
"I know that people hold strong
views, but I also think that it's very
important that universities not fall
into a pattern of only one political
line of thought." Rice said. "It's
important that people are heard from
across the spectrum."
For now. Rice has no plans to
leave Stanford, and she denied specu
lation that a run for president is in her
future with a laugh.
"1 can't predict the future, but I
don't have any plans to do more than
I'm doing now." she said."l'm a terri
ble long-term planner —I always
have said that."

Condoleeza Rice has always been a huge sports fan, and she decorated her
office with signed footballs, helmets and other memorabilia. She intends to
attend Stanford sporting events, though she is holding off on teaching for a year.
