Condoleezza Rice officially returned to
Stanford just this week, but the political sei
ence professor already appears at home in
her Hoover Institution office. Her shelves
are neatly organized, displaying auto
graphed footballs, photos of Rice with
world leaders and even a model of the USS
Condoleezza Rice.
The former Secretary of State and
National Security Advisor is confident that
she will have a smooth transition back to
the Farm. In an exclusive interview with The
Daily yesterday, Rice displayed poise and
composure, and she dismissed student con

cerns about the Bush administration's
authorization of harsh interrogation meth
ods.
In April 2008. ABC News reported that
senior White I louse officials, including Rice,
approved "enhanced interrogation tech
niques" such as waterboarding. Hie news
outlet reported that Rice told the CIA.
" This is your baby. Go do it." Rice later pub
licly admitted to the Senate that these dis
cussions took place, although she declined
to go into detail about her own positions.
Some campus activists believe this news
is evidence that Rice supported torture, and
they suggest that she does not belong at
Stanford as a result. (See "Few equate Rice.
Rumsfeld" in the Feb. 23 issue of The

â€” CONDOLEEZZA RICE

Daily.) Rice was unfazed and steady in
responding to these allegations, and empha
sized multiple times that the administration
repeatedly ensured that its actions were
legal and in accordance with U.S. treaty
responsibilities.
"I think it would have been unusual if
there had not been discussions at the high
est levels of government about what we
were going to do in a post-y/11 environ
ment." she said. "The one thing that I am
absolutely confident of and certain of in my
own mind, is that we did what we thought
was necessary, but also what we believed
was legal."
Though Rice primarily emphasized that
the harsh interrogation techniques were

fully legal, she also dismissed the argument
that these techniques were immoral. She
pointed out how it may he hard for some
people to understand what it was like to be
in a position of authority after Sept. 11.
"When your highest responsibility is to
protect the country and save innocent lives
in the wake of a time when I had to watch
Americans jump out of 80-story windows
on the day that the towers were attacked,
then I think that you have an obligation to
do what is legal and necessary." she said.
"You have a moral responsibility as well,
not to let Americans die unnecessarily."
"For us, those of us who were in respon
sible positions," she added, "every day after
Sept. 11 was Sept. 12. and that was until the
day we left."
Rice, however, carefully sidestepped
questions about whether she personally
supported or raised moral objections about
the use of any harsh interrogation tech
niques. refusing to comment on "'internal
deliberations in the administration."
She also declined to state whether she
thought waterboarding was a form of cruel
and usual punishment, simply noting that
the President told his advisors only to
authorize interrogation methods that were
legal, within U.S. treaty obligations and not
forms of torture. When pressed again about
whether waterboarding was cruel and
unusual. Rice responded, "Obviously any
thing that we authorized was in the context
of our treaty obligations and within the
law."
Rice was similarly careful not to openly
condemn President Obama's decision to
roll back the harsh interrogation methods
and close Guantanamo Bay and CIA pris
ons, though she noted the rising debate over
the difficulty of safely closing Guantanamo.
Even while serving in the Bush administra
tion. Rice said she had been an advocate for
closing the prison if it could be done safely.
"Yes. it was not a luxury hotel, but it was.
I think, a well-run facility," she said of
Guantanamo. "But people now recognize
there are very dangerous people there."
Rice framed other conflicts that arose
during her term as Secretary of State in
moral terms. She recalled meeting raped
and battered women in Darfur and called it
"the hardest thing I did as Secretary." Rice
said that while the U.S. did everything it
could to assuage the situation, bar military
action, she was disappointed with the
results.
Rice also framed the Iraq war in moral
