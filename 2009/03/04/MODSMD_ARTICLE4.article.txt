## Warming speeds ahead Greenhouse gas report exceeds IPCC worst-case scenario 
### CASEY LINDBERG 
Stanford researchers involved in the Nobel
Pri/e-winning Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (II'CC) now say that global warming may
be happening faster than previously anticipated, in
light of alarming new data on greenhouse gas emis
sions.
"The main message from the new data is that the
window of opportunity for getting the emissions
under control in rapidly closing." said ( hris Field, a
professor of biology and environmental earth sys
tem science who was involved in the IPCC.
Field explained that the worst-case scenario
explored in the last IPCC report was based on
annual emissions of eight billion tons of carbon
from burning fossil fuels and manufacturing
cement. New figures from the Department of
Energy indicate that in 2(K)7, 8.5 bil
lion tons were actually burned — 500
million tons more than the worst
case scenario.
This unexpected bump in carbon
emissions is due primarily to the
prodigious use of coal in developing
nations like China. However. Field
pointed out that even though China
is now the worst emitter of green
house gases, it is also the most popu
lous nation in the world, while the
United States burns four times more
fuel per capita.
The next step for the scientific
community is to better understand
the consequences of this increased
pace of emissions. The task of dis
cerning global warming's total effects
is difficult, as many different environ
mental systems are affected, and cur
rent computer models are not sophis
ticated enough to project their inter
actions. However, scientists do under
stand how some of the world's envi
ronmental systems, like oceans and
forests, might be affected individually
by an increased pace of warming.
Ilie earth has some natural ways
of reducing carbon dioxide levels,
called carbon sinks.'l"he oceans work
as sinks as they absorb CQ2 from the
atmosphere, and forests work as sinks
through photosynthesis. However,
the amount of CO2 these carbon
sinks can absorb from the atmos
phere is limited, and global warming
may create some maladaptive feed
back loops that hasten their ineffec
tiveness.
Recent studies show that higher
surface winds cause the oceans to
absorb less C()2. which in turn leads
to increased warming and still higher
winds. Tropical forests are normally
under little threat to burn, but
increased warming may dry out these
areas to the point where fires could
start more easily, release carbon back
into the atmosphere, and perpetuate

the cycle.
Field explained that forest fires in
places like the United States are also
affected by global warming.
"There is strong evidence that
warming is a very strong inducer of
fires in the mid-latitudes," Field said.
In the United States, there were four
times as many forest fires in the last
decade than from 1979 to 1989.
Rising sea levels are another cited
result of global warming that could
lead to devastating consequences.
Previous estimates pegged the sea
level rise at one or two feet for the
remainder of this century.
Stanford climatologist Stephen
Schneider,also on the I PC X .said that
the seas may actually rise to twice
that level, about a meter, and that
such an increase would mean a lot
more than just "getting your feet
wet." Schneider explained that any
increase in sea level changes affects
the way storms play out on the coasts.
A seemingly small increase in sea
level can drastically change the coast
line in low-lying areas, allowing for
storm surges to impact cities with
more force.
Increased flooding, widespread
species extinction, water supply prob
lems and more deaths from heat
waves and droughts are all cited as
risks of a quickening pace for global
warming.
Fields pointed out that we need to
see aggressive action taken in the
next few years to stabilize global tem
peratures. And by aggressive action,
he is not talking about buying a Prius.
"At this point, the most important
thing that average citizens can do is
to actively encourage their elected
officials (from the city council to the
President) to make climate a priority
and to enact legislation that moves us
off of fossil fuels and onto renew
ables. efficiency and conservation."
Field said. "Lifestyle and consump
tion choices make a difference, but at
this point, we really need the frame
work."
