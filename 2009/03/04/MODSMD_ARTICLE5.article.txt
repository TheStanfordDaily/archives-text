# STUDENT GOV'T
## Record numbers run for ASSU Five Executive slates, 60-plus Senate candidates on tap 
### MATT SERNA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
More than 60 students have declared
their intent to run for a seat in the
Undergraduate Senate, and five slates
have declared their candidacy for
Executive, setting the stage for an
extraordinarily competitive ASSU elec
tion season this spring.
ASSU Executive
Of the five executive candidates, two
slates — Bennett Hauser 10 and Matt
Sprague '10. and David Gobaud 'ON M.S.
'(i l .) and Jay de la Torre '10 — have previ
ous ASSU experience.
Mauser is the manager of The
Stanford Store, and Sprague currently
oversees Stanford Student Enterprise's
(SSE) capital group.
"We will also apply our role as finan
cial leaders to student groups by fighting

to increase funding for all those in need,"
I lauser said. "We must make sure that no
Stanford student, community center or
student group is overlooked in these cuts
and remain strong during these times."
Gobaud is currently the operations
manager for the ASSU Executives, and
de la Torre has been involved in planning
the upcoming ASSU Service Summit.
Gobaud ran unsuccessfully for execu
tive last year, and he hopes to leverage
his experience from that campaign in this
year's election.
"I know the issues better [than I did
last year): it definitely helps to have run a
previous campaign," he said. "The biggest
problem next year is the budget crisis. We
need to make sure we're fighting to
maintain staff and members of our com
munity."
Also running for Executive are Blake
Miller II and Nicholas Murray 'II
(The Green Party), Benjamin Hersh 'ID
and Richard Furtell (The Grand Math
and Science Coalition) and John Lyman
'11 and Garret Werner" 10 (Just A Couple

ASSU Undergraduate Senate
This year's crop of at least 60 Senate
contenders is much larger than in previ
ous years. In last year's election. 39 stu
dents received more than 10 votes in
competition for the Senate's 15 seats.
Bryce Kam '12. a Frosh ( ouncil mem
ber and Senate candidate in this year's
election, feels that one of the biggest rea
sons for this increase in competition is
the unusually large number of frosh run
ning for Senate.
"There are a lot more freshmen, and a
lot more people from Frosh Council."
Kam said. "[ASSU President Jonny
Dorsey 'ol>0 l > and Vice President lagan
I larris W] have raised awareness regard
ing what the ASSU does as a whole,
which has inspired freshmen to get
involved. People are more aware ol the
ASSU. which translates to more people
running."
Like Kam. Howard Tan "II believes
that outreach by the current student gov
ernment has increased the number of
candidates.

"People are running because last
year's senators have done a great job
reaching out to people "Tan said.
Tan did not run as a freshman, partial
ly because he had had no interaction with
the ASSI I at that time.
"It speaks well of the current Senate
that they've actively looked at the issue
of leadership rejuvenation." he said.
Some Senate candidates see the cur
rent ASSU as excessively bureaucratic,
and are running because they feel they

could do a better job.
"There is a significant amount of
bureaucracy." Kani said. "For exam
ple. when the Senate chair [Shelley
Gao "111 didn't allow the reporters
into that one meeting. There's a lot
of reform that needs to go into mak
ing the Senate appear as more than

a dysfunctional body. In general,
there's an image that the Senate
doesn't do all that much."
Hie slumping economy has also
played a significant role in inspiring
candidates to run for elected office.
For Shinjini Kundu '11. the difficul
ties that students are facing to pay
tuition hills has inspired her Senate
run.
"It's becoming really hard during
the economy for people to pay."
Kundu said. "I want to find a com
mon intersection between interests

of students, parents and the
University."
"The budget cuts and economic
situation have highlighted the
importance of the ASSIJ in making
decisions regarding resource alloca
tion " Tan added. "When student
government might actually impact
the lives of students, that's when you
get more awareness and more can
didates."
