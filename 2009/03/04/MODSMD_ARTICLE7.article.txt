## Students craft their own recipes to escape dining hall monotony Cook it yourself 
### STACIE CHAN STAFF WRITER 
"Tjjj ven though our parents told us
never to play with our food,
I the endless possibilities avail
able in the dining hall just beg
JL—J Stanford students to do other
wise. Some innovate out of necessity;
others craft concoctions to satisfy
unique cravings. Whatever the reason,
more and more students across campus
are exploring their creative sides, creat
ing unique, and often tasty, alternatives
to the already prepared food.
"I didn't see anything I liked so I
started making my Raisin Bran sand
wich." said Jean Lam '12. Hie Raisin
Bran sandwich is comprised of two may
onnaise-slathered pieces of white bread
that envelop a handful of Raisin Bran
cereal.
"My dad used to make it and I
always copied him. so I think it's per
fectly normal and tastes good," Lam
said. "But everyone else thinks it's
weird."
But this "weirdness" seems to be
exactly what Stanford students want.
Wilbur serves breakfast for lunch and
dinner on Wednesday nights by popular
demand. Omelets and waffles open up
endless culinary possibilities for student
innovation. With both the waffle station
and salad bar fully stocked with top
pings. there is an infinite number of

breakfast concoctions possible.
Stephanie Castro's '12 approach to
waffle innovation is minimalist, but
effective. After spraying a liberal
amount of non-stick spray, Castro care
fully ladles a scoopful of multigrain waf
fle batter in half of the iron, and then
proceeds to ladle another scoopful of
the regular batter, creating a uniquely
different waffle that somewhat resem
bles the yin-vang symbol.
"It's not super weird, but 1 just want
ed to do something different," Castro
said. "I like the multigrain side because
it's healthier, but the regular side tastes
slightly better, so I use both."
The waffle station is just one of the
"Do It Yourself" stations available at
Lakeside Dining that seem to be foster
ing creativity. Lakeside even provides an
open stove top as another way for stu
dents to produce unique options.
Natth Bejraburnin *09 takes advan
tage of the stove top to make chow fun
mixed with sausage links and sliced deli
meat from the salad bar. Bejraburnin
explained that he liked the idea of being
able to cook his own food with his own
choice of ingredients.
Like Bejraburnin, Roxna Irani '10,
who has written for The Daily in the
past, also utilizes the salad bar for ingre
dients. Her concoction of cottage cheese
and honey mustard is a mixture that
isn't as well-received by her friends.
"I swear it's delicious — you just

have to try it." Irani promised, despite
her friends' disgusted reactions.
Yet while some students enjoy creat
ing food concoctions for fun, others are
resorting to them as ways to combat din
ing hall monotony.
"There was no sauce that was spicy
enough in the dining hall," said Tim
Garibaldi MO. "So. I watched a friend
make a 'special sauce' of ranch dressing,
sriracha [chili sauce] and BBQ sauce,
and now I always use it as a dip for fries
and cheese sticks."
"Food was getting redundant."
agreed Monchette Gonda '12. "so I
started making my own pasta sauce out
of the condiments and spices available
at Flo Mo."
Lipon hearing these comments of
"redundancy" or "monotony." however,
Eric Montell, executive director of
Stanford Dining, was puzzled, citing
Stanford Dining's high levels of food
satisfaction — including variety, quality
and menu choices.
"Our chefs change the menu each
day and every meal to provide greater
variety than any restaurant or eatery,"
Montell said in an email to The Daily.
"Students are often surprised that they
have so much influence over the menu
and our team of chefs is happy to pro
vide this customized service."
Yet many students still seem
unaware of this student feedback option
and prefer to take personal control of

their food options. For some, the best
creations sprang from accidents and
have become favorites ever since. Mike
"Tubbz" Tubbs '12 started eating
pineapples with hot sauce after those
were the only two items left on his plate.
"It's so good: it's like an Ujamaa dish
now." Tubbs explained, referring to its
growing popularity. "I eat it with every
meal because it's like Pringles: once you
pop, you don't stop. Plus, it tastes like
the pineapple is biting back at you."
But not all foods have to be based on
mismatched ingredients. Some students
imitate already-made products to create
refreshing alternatives to dining hall
food.
"1 make coffee smoothies (what
Starbucks calls the Frappuccino), using
coffee, milk, ice and fro-yo," wrote
Deniz Kahramaner '12 in an email to
The Daily. The frozen blend comes sur
prisingly close to the original, he added.
And when the creative juices just
aren't flowing, the default sandwich area
in each dining hall is always stocked with
various types of bread, spreads, sauces
and other options. So before you find
yourself dreading i\ meal at the dining
hall, look at it as an opportunity to spice
up your meal. You just might find yourself
with a customized Frappuccino or Raisin
Bran sandwich on your empty plate.
