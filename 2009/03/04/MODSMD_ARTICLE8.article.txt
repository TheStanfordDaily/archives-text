One of Stanford's nationally competitive teams proves
itself not on a tield. on a court or in a pool, hut around a
table. Elena Grewal. a graduate student in education; C. J.
Jameson '10: Alex Lovejoy, a graduate student in biochem
istry: Eric Mayefsky, a graduate student in economics; and
Zizhuo Wang, a graduate student in management science
and engineering, are among the top bridge players in the
nation. In a relaxed, informal conversation, they shared
their enthusiasm for the game and encouraged their peers
to give bridge a chance.
The bridge club meets twice a week — Tuesday
evenings for informal games and teaching, and Iliursday
evenings for a formal duplicate game in which players can
earn points toward their national bridge rankings. Both
meetings attract alumni and community members, along
with students.
Although attendance varies, club members estimate
between 10 and 25 players at each meeting. Members
enthusiastically welcome beginners, and advanced players
offer informal lessons at Tuesday night meetings. The
group also promotes bridge education by teaching a stu
dent-initiated course on bridge, which drew 15 students
this year and 20 last year.

This summer, four club members will compete in the
2009 North American Collegiate Bridge Team
( hampionships. Iwo Stanford teams competed in the
26-team online qualifying round, and Grewal, Lovejoy,
Mayefsky and Wang emerged as the top-ranked team of
eight qualifying teams. They will travel to Washington.
D.C. in July to compete against teams from Harvard,
Princeton. Davidson, University of Chicago. University
of North Carolina, McGill and UCLA.
In addition to the collegiate events, this 11-day
national competition features many other events for
beginners and experts alike.
"You could be playing 100 hands a day." Jameson
said.
Team members agreed that it can be tiring, but that
stamina increases.
Mayefsky went to his first nationals in 2003, when the
Stanford team placed first. Subsequent Stanford teams
placed second in 2004 and 2007. and third in 2005.
ITie team won 't be doing any special preparations for
the competition.
"At this level, we know that we are better than every-

body," Mayefsky said. "We have the best team in the
event."
The Stanford players have played many of their com
petitors in previous tournaments, as well as the quali
fiers. Mayefsky added that doing well in the event is
"just a matter of not screwing up" and "not doing fancy
stuff."
"Just plav normally," Grewal said.

Many members learned bridge in high school from par
ents, grandparents or teachers, and learned more
advanced techniques through books and Web sites.
"I think the way that I actually learned how to play was
just to play a lot," Grewal said.
"We throw a lot of pointers back and forth." Jameson
agreed. "We work together to teach each other and get
better."
Members estimated that they play bridge about once a
week, although this varies widely. The continual challenge

draws them to the game.
"Its always a new puzzle." Ixwejoy said. "Bridge gives
you the right amount of information in a puzzle so you can
figure out an intelligent thing to do without it being obvious."
Wang agreed.
"You can always find clues on the table." he said. "I
don't really like playing online, because I cannot see the
people."
Mayefsky added that the growth potential in bridge
might be another attractor.
"For the first 15 to 20 years you're playing, if you
always want to learn more to improve your game, there's
always new systems and things you can learn." he noted,
drawing contrasts with other card games.
In fact, unlike chess, backgammon and checkers, not
even a computer can compete against the best human
bridge players, according to Mayefsky.
Additionally, as bridge is played with partners, he
suggested that this social nature often converts chess

players to the game.

What do team members have in common aside from a
love of bridge?
"Just liking games, if that makes any sense," Grewal
offered, "liking a puzzle, liking a challenge."
"I have a word for it. hut other people find the word
derogatory," Mayefsky said. He mouths "nerdiness," and
others debate amongst themselves whether the label fits.
Grewal disagreed.
"There are people who are really into bridge who are
not that nerdy." she said. "It's not true. At one point. 50
percent ot college students played. My grandparents
played when they were in college. You just have to like
games, and everyone likes games."
"1 think it's more like a sport," Grewal said, prompting
laughter from the group."Like you have to invest in it, and
then vou get more out of it.and it's social."

Members note that although one can learn the
mechanics of the game in an hour, playing bridge necessi
tates a greater commitment.
But Mayefsky suggested that cultivating bridge players
may not be so difficult.
"You really just need to get them hooked." he said. "It's
not that you need to teach them everything there is to
know — you just have to get them to a point where they
want to learn more. And then it's very easy for them."

( lub members acknowledged the perception of bridge
as a game for older people, saying that they always get
reactions when they tell people they play bridge. To some
extent, the perception is real, and some attribute the
decline in young players to the rise of computers in recent
decades.
"Every young bridge player is always sort of wrestling
with this issue that there aren't very many young bridge
players." Mayefsky said. But members cited a good com
munity of young bridge players, particularly in the Bay
Area.
Many young players also convene at the summer
nationals event.
"It's nice to have them all in one place," Mayefsky
added. "We hang out. We have fun."
Members also noted the networking potential that
comes with being able to play an intergenerational game.
" Iliere are actually a lot of really powerful people who
play bridge," Grewal said.
Lovejoy agreed, adding. "The best way to meet Bill
(iates and Warren Buffet is to sit down at a bridge table."
