## Editorial In praise of practical public service for education 
### 
Somewhat lost in the commotion over
Condoleezza Rice's return to Stanford
was another Stanford political science
professor's concurrent departure for govern
ment ser\ ice. Prof. Michael McEaul's appoint
ment as Special Assistant to the President for
National Security Affairs and senior director
for Russian and Eurasian affairs at the Na
tional Security ( ouncil serves as yet another
reminder that Stanford has much to gain from
the continuous exchange of Stanford aca
demics in policymaking positions.
While it is readily evident that one's per
formance as a public servant is more likely to
invite controversy than t\pical academic pur
suits. the editorial hoard believes that such
real world experience is invaluable and that
Stanford can benefit from professors with
public service records placing a greater em
phasis on applying their hands-on experience
in the classroom.
Stanford is blessed to have a wealth of ac
ademics with experience in all realms of pub
lic policy. Economics Prof. John Taylor
best known for his eponymous rule for setting
interest rates and his übiquitous introductory
economics textbook served as the Under
Secretary ol the Treasury for International
Allairs under President George lI.W. Bush.
I he popular MSiVI N3 course "Technology
and National Security" is co-taught by former
Clinton Secretary ol Defense William Perry.
Meanyvhile, Professor ol Education I inda
Darling-Hammond has been named one of
the nation's 10 most influential people in
shaping education policy, and her name was
floated for the top job at the Education De
partment before current Secretary Arne
I )uncan yyas nominated.
And this breadth of sery ice is hardly limit
ed to the social sciences. President Obama's
Secretary ol I nergy. Steven Chu, was until
2001 a physics professor at Stanford.yvhere he
\yas instrumental in establishing the Uio-X
program.
( urrently, McEaul leaves to fill a post pre
yiously held by Prof. C'oit Blacker in the first
Clinton administration. And in McEaul's
fareyvell party last I riday. Blacker jokingly re
fen ed to the monopoly that Stanford has had
on the position. Meanwhile. McEaul's re
placement at the ( enter for Democracy. De
velopment and the Rule of l.aw. Prof. Earry
Diamond, is a frequent advisor to the State
Department. I nited Nations. World Bank
and the Iraq ( oalition Provisional Authority.
(iiyen this staggering richness of experi
ence, all that is left is to encourage these pro
lessors to import their policymaking experi

ence to the classroom experience. Some pro
fessors already do so: Blacker's ' Internation
al Security in a Changing World" class tradi
tionally participates in a generally well-re
ceived three-day U.N.simulation. Rice herself
is known to have performed similar practical
simulations in her own courses during her
teaching days at Stanford.
In addition to emphasizing practical poli
cymaking instruction, what Stanford would
greatly benefit from is a consolidation of the
many professors with this experience into a
single.cohesive program.
Since 2000. Yale has boasted the Brady
.lohnson Program in Grand Strategy, a year
long course combining intensive study, plum
internships, prominent guest lecturers and
"hands-on" policy simulations. Proponents of
Yale's course have "argued that universities
had become too specialized, focusing on nar
rower and narrower topics without offering
students a general, big-picture vieyv of the
world or an intellectual framework for under
standing how the different pieces fit togeth
er." according to a recent Wall Street Journal
editorial. Duke and West Point have already
taken up conservative philanthropist Roger
Hertog on his offer of up to $10 million to
jumpstart similar endeavors. Stanford yvould
have much to gain from a program based on
the (irand Strategy model.
But we must acknowledge that there are
potential risks in combining policymaking
with teaching. Political Science Prof, emeritus
Hubert Marshall wasquoted in a Daily article
on Rice's return.stating his concern that " pro
fessors should not mix policy-making yyith
teaching because it precludes objectivity." In
applying policymaking to the classroom, pro
fessors must be conscious of this prospect. In
fact, the risk ol subjectivity provides further
reason to embrace a program like Yale's,
wherein multiple professors yy it h differing
ideologies may be able to offer a more bal
anced policymaking perspective.
Stanford faces a difficult economy, and
new programs — even ones with potential
philanthropists are unlikely to get off the
ground. Nonetheless, even as our university
grapples with the current economic crisis, we
must remember that the outside world is
struggling too. ITiis university was founded on
the idea of practical education in addition to
immersion in humanities and the arts, and a
concerted effort to offer realistic instruction
about the challenges outside the classroom
would be invaluable to Stanford students as
they leave and prepare to make their mark on
the yvorld.
