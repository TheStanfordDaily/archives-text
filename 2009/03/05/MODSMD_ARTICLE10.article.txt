## Parents react to tuition increases 
### MEGAN DOHENY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last weekend, parents from around the world
descended on the Farm to get a glimpse of every
day lite for their sons and daughters. But this
year, parents were especially concerned about
the impact of the recession on Stanford.
Next year, tuition will increase by 3.5 percent,
while the University plans to cut 15 percent of
general funds over the next two years. This com
bination was on the top of many parents' minds
over the weekend.
Still, the University has made it clear that the
recession will not affect financial aid. Currently,
families with incomes lower than $100,000 are
not asked to pay more than the yearly earnings
from work-study.
"Stanford's budget cuts and tuition increase
are largely due to the ioss in value of its endow
ment funds and seem to be consistent with the
overall economic crisis we are facing as a nation."
said Susan Adamson '78 "S2 J. 1)., mother of two
current Stanford students. "I lowever, I am heart
ened by the fact that Stanford will maintain its
commitment to families with annual incomes of
less than $100,000.
"While I am able to afford the tuition for my
two children at Stanford, my own Stanford edu
cation was paid for by scholarships." Adamson
added."! think Stanford's commitment to access
to higher education for students from every
income level should remain a priority."
Hut some other families who do not receive
financial aid are not exactly welcoming the
increased tuition and concurrent budget cuts.
Specifically, some parents are upset that the
University is raising tuition for some while at the
same time increasing financial aid for others.
"The ever-increasing amount of tuition is making
it incredibly difficult to afford if you aren't on the
very high or low end of the economic scale," said
the parent of one Stanford sophomore, who
asked to remain anonymous for fear of repercus
sions for her child. "Stanford's done wonderful
things for people that have very little income and
people that are extremely wealthy don't have anv
issue with tuition.
