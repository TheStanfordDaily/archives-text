## Parents react to tuition increases 
### MEGAN DOHENY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Last weekend, parents from around the world
descended on the Farm to get a glimpse of every
day lite for their sons and daughters. But this
year, parents were especially concerned about
the impact of the recession on Stanford.
Next year, tuition will increase by 3.5 percent,
while the University plans to cut 15 percent of
general funds over the next two years. This com
bination was on the top of many parents' minds
over the weekend.
Still, the University has made it clear that the
recession will not affect financial aid. Currently,
families with incomes lower than $100,000 are
not asked to pay more than the yearly earnings
from work-study.
"Stanford's budget cuts and tuition increase
are largely due to the ioss in value of its endow
ment funds and seem to be consistent with the
overall economic crisis we are facing as a nation."
said Susan Adamson '78 "S2 J. 1)., mother of two
current Stanford students. "I lowever, I am heart
ened by the fact that Stanford will maintain its
commitment to families with annual incomes of
less than $100,000.
"While I am able to afford the tuition for my
two children at Stanford, my own Stanford edu
cation was paid for by scholarships." Adamson
added."! think Stanford's commitment to access
to higher education for students from every
income level should remain a priority."
Hut some other families who do not receive
financial aid are not exactly welcoming the
increased tuition and concurrent budget cuts.
Specifically, some parents are upset that the
University is raising tuition for some while at the
same time increasing financial aid for others.
"The ever-increasing amount of tuition is making
it incredibly difficult to afford if you aren't on the
very high or low end of the economic scale," said
the parent of one Stanford sophomore, who
asked to remain anonymous for fear of repercus
sions for her child. "Stanford's done wonderful
things for people that have very little income and
people that are extremely wealthy don't have anv
issue with tuition.

"But for the people that are in the
middle that make good income and
don't qualify for financial aid. in
creasing tuition is a big problem,"
she continued. "It seems incongru
ous to me that Stanford kept raising
tuition when the endowment was in
creasing, and now that the Universi
ty is cutting its budget, it continues to
increase tuition. You can't have it
both ways."
Many parents understand that
like almost everything else, the Uni
versity too is forced to deal with the
recession, and that changes must
come.
"1 think President Hennessy is
doing a great job, and 1 think the
University is trying to hang on as
best they can. but it must be devas
tating for them because they depend
on donations for many of the stu
dents." said Sharon Grimes, mother
ofTavlor Grimes '09. "If the school is

going to continue providing money
for those kids who need financial
aid. then they have to cut corners
everywhere else. 1 really admire
President Hennessy, and I'm sure
he's doing everything he can. Do I
like tuition going up? No. But every
thing's going up."
Last Friday at the onset of par
ents' weekend, Provost John
Etchemendy reassured parents that
the academic goals of the University
will be preserved despite budget
cuts.
"It's my guess that when all is said
and done, your children will only feel
the slightest impact from these cuts."
he said. "The changes will not have a
meaningful effect on their under
grad experience — that's our goal."
Parents provided input on how to
pare down the budget.
"Cut the extra fat, but don't elim
inate the programs that make the
Stanford experience what it is." said
