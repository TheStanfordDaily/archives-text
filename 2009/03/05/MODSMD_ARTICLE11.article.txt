## Editorial New Palo Alto Police Chief is on the right track 
### 
Less than half a century after Brown v.
Hoard of Education, in which the
Supreme Court ruled segregation was
unconstitutional, the United States elected
its lirst black president.The rate of progress
is astounding, and it can he easy, particularly
as some pundits suggest, to assume that in
the early part of the 21st century, true racial
equality lias been reached in America. Un
lortunately, this is far from the case, and
there are disturbing,powerful counterexam
ples even in our own backyard of Palo Alto.
On October 30, at a community meeting,
Palo Alto Police Chief Lynne Johnson, who
served on the police force for 34 years, was
quoted as saying, "If my officers see an
African American who has a do-rag on his
head, absolutely the officers will be stopping
and trying to find out who that person is."
Following these comments — and days of
backlash among the Palo Alto and Stanford
communities — Johnson decided to step
down. I ler insinuation of racial profiling on
behalf of the Palo Alto Police Department
was appalling. A few months later, however,
the editorial board is hopeful that the new
Palo Alto Police Chief, Dennis Burns, will be
able to ease racial tensions with his newly
announced programs to prevent racial pro
filing in the department.
Based purely on statistics from the Palo
Alto Police Department, there appears to
be a significant and alarming trend. In 2008,
one out of every 167 white residents was ar
rested. while one out of every 6.5 black resi
dents was arrested, at a traffic stop at some
point during the year. While differences in
education and socioeconomic background

can be used to explain this disparity, the ad
mission of racial profiling by the police
chief,coupled with the shocking,2s-fold dis
parity in arrests, is a chilling indication that
even in our backyard, racial equity is far
from a reality-
Steps are being taken to combat these is
sues. Last week. Burns hosted a forum that
discussed racial profiling, among other
things. At the meeting. Burns announced he
was assembling a community advisory group
to tackle race relations and diversity in po
lice work, tolerance training for 10 high-level
officers (at the time of writing, two have
completed this training) and a class for all of
ficers on racial profiling taught by a profes
sional criminologist. These are steps in the
right direction, but we have yet to see how
much of this is simply to mollify the rightful
ly outraged public, and how much of this is
sincere change that will lead to tangible im
provements in the Palo Alto Police Depart
ment. If successful, the program could set an
example for police departments around the
country in cooling race relations and im
proving community outreach.
It's easy to stroll to class in a "post-racial"
Stanford and pretend that nothing bad hap
pens anymore, but it couldn't be more obvi
ous that, even in 2009,0ur own local commu
nity — let alone America as a whole — has
lived up to the expectation of racial equity.
This university is full of amazing people w ho
will goon to lead communities and the world
in many different fields, and hopefully this
close-to-home lesson in discrimination will
remind us all of our responsibility to contin
ue the fight for equality.
