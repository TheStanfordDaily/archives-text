# DEMBY DOWNER

Alter last week's Deniby Downer enti
tled "Sex and student government," I
encountered a number of frustrated
indi\ iduals who felt duped into reading a col
umn that was mostly just about student gov
ernment. Apparently the masses want sex,
and I won't deny them of it.
My sister once made the apt comment
that if I had no sex drive. I would be utterly
incapable of functioning in school. The con
text of the conversation was yet another in
stance of me telling her that I had a crush on
one of my professors.
In his article "Love on Campus" pub
lished in I he American Scholar, former Yale
professor William Deresiewicz argues that
there is a certain passionate intensity "erotic
in its urgency and its intensity" between a
professor and his or her student, but that this
intensity is not truly sexual in nature and
should not be misinterpreted and/or abused
as such. I le tries to show the distinction be
tween this intensity of intellectual mentor
ship and real sexual intensity by recalling a
conversation he had with one of his TAs. I le
asked her whether she had ever wanted to
have sex with a professor, to which she
replied that there was one professor she had
in grad school with whom she wanted to
"have brain sex." but not "real" sex.
Maybe I'm just a young, naive student
who. when confronted with the aforemen
tioned erotic urgency in the classroom."mis
takes this earthquake for sexual attraction."
Yet I'm not sure 1 can draw such a firm dis
tinction between my libidos and my intellec
tual passions. I don't think I'm alone in feel
ing that the two are very linked. After all.
there's a reason nubile young undergradu
ates in the humanities quest after bespecta
cled. bescruffcd. besweatered graduate stu
dents. To try to classify the stimulation I feel
hanging off of the words of Professor Sex and
the excitement of making eyes at student Joe
Sex in the line at Moonbean's is to deny the
complexity of both kinds of attraction.
Maybe I'm over determining the similari
ties between "real" sexual attraction and
vaguely sexual classroom attraction. While
the first leads to real sex ("you know. PFNIS
AND VA( UNA." to roughly quote the qual
ity film "Wet Mot American Summer"), the
second manifests itself in no more than a
faint blush in class or an extra visit to office
hours. Hut I don't think the outcome of the
attraction means that it is any less sexual in
nature.There are many ways in which sexual
attraction functions in my life that don't nec
essarily manifest themselves in the act of sex.
My libido drives me toward everything en
joyable that I do. It's like how we young peo-

has caused me to abstract
my basic drives.

pie love to throw around the adjective "or
gasmic." I don't just enjoy good movies or
good art; I find them orgasmic.That's why my
sister was so right. My creative and intellectu
al fervor is so intrinsically connected to my
sexual energy that they couldn't function
without each other.
You might think I'm confused. Like Freud
you may think that I've displaced my attrac
tion toward the real objects of my sexual de
sire. Maybe I just intellectualize sex and sex
ualize intellect because society has caused
me to abstract my basic drives. But if this is
true, this diffusion of sex into other realms of
my life is one function of civilized culture I
rather like. Freud thought this displacement
led to a frustration of our real sexual urges.
While I will grant this to him in the deep.dark
realms of repression that psychoanalysis
deals with (society does disallow me from
having sex with my dad so 1 displace that at
traction onto other boys, etc.). I tend to think
that a little confusion between the realms of
sex and academia enhances rather than di
minishes the actual act of sex. It makes it the
culmination of more than just physical at
traction. I"he fact that my sex drive and my in
tellectual drive are mutually reinforcing just
maximizes my pleasure 011 both counts.
So while I may not sleep with my profes
sor because common sense tells me its a bad
idea. I won't deny that my attraction to him is
sexual, just like I won't pretend like I don't
get a little hot when I read a good book.
