## KZSU: Stanford's hidden (beneath Pigott Theater) jewel 
### 
It was almost too easy, I remember think
ing to myself. You mean all I have to do is
go to a couple of informational meetings
on Tuesdays, learn the ropes, submit a demo
CD, perform a couple of hours of service for
the station, take a very, very open-note final
(the answers were literally the writing on the
walls) and then, poof: I get my own show?
And yet, that is how it happened (alright,
we had to lobby a little for a time slot, but we
got one). I. along with the great Scott
Hofmeister (of "insert world-renowned
achievement here" fame) entered the cocoon
of KZSU (90.1 FM) Studios winter quarter of
sophomore year with a dream, and emerged a
quarter later as Stanford Radio's newest cre
ative butterflies. Only a few weeks later.
"S&M in the Moi ning." aii ing 5-6 on Wednes
day evenings, was born.
Scott and I were two students who, by the
end of freshman year, knew we wanted a
radio show. It was just meant to be. You ever
make a friend whose comic timing matched
yours nearly perfectly? A friend who you
knew you could do something zany no one
else would get. and you would therefore
never think to do around anyone else, but you
knew this person would fall over himself
laughing? Yep. that was Scott (or rather, it still
is: he isn't dead —just graduated).
KZSU is one of those hidden gems at Stan
ford that too few students take advantage of.
Stanford's radio station is ready and willing to
have any student with some semblance of
music taste or entertainment value as a part of
their lineup. A wonderful (if slightly eccentric,
and proudly so) staff is willing and able to
help at every turn.
KZSU studios itself is a marvel. A quick
walk around the studio itself reveals room
after room teeming with old vinyl records and
C Ds of e very di I fere nt k in d of m usic i m agi na -
ble. (A highlight of my year occurred when 1
happened upon an old vinyl from Red Hot
Chili Peppers' 1985 album. "Freaky Stvley."
It's a terrible album, but as the world's biggest
Chili Peppers fan. I am morally obligated to

say I highly recommend it).
Among the many highlights a show
granted me was the opportunity to speak
with a couple Bay Area sports icons. By
working a few KZSU contacts. Scott and I
had the pleasure of interviewing Damon
Bruce, co-host of "Sportsphone" on KNBR
680 AM (the Bay Area's preeminent sports
station), and Dave Flemming '98, MA '98,
nationally known broadcaster of the San
Francisco Giants and of Stanford Cardinal
football and basket ball. These kinds of op
portunities are there at KZSU, waiting for

students to seize them.
But where are the students? Granted, a
couple of mv friends have gotten involved
with the station, and a few have shows of their
own. By and large, the station's DJs and talk
show hosts are predominantly adults from the
greater Bay Area, looking to spend a few
hours spinning their favorite indie tunes for
the world (or at least, the Peninsula.and any
one with Internet) to hear. Not that there's
anything wrong with that, but my question is:
if you have something to say. and the chance
to have your ideas broadcast is literally right
here in your backyard, why wouldn't you
want to try for your own radio show'.' (1 would
recommend that you get your own opinions
column as well, but only a select few can be so
lucky.)
"Howard Stern" or "Car Talk." "S&M in
the Morning" was not (nor was my other
show, "The Slippedy Doo Da." co-hosted by
Jake "the Doo" Wachtel and Blake "Da
Funk" Woodard). But KZSU didn't ask us to
be. and besides, that wasn't the point. From
our perspective, the point was to try to enter
tain each other, and to see if we could do it for
an entire hour without a single reference to
scatological humor (we did have one episode
on Nov. 20 called "S&M's Erection Spesher"
— if you don't get it. imagine you couldn't
pronounce your I's-but that was pretty much
as close as we came). After all. if we could
make each other laugh, there was a good
chance that both of the other people listening
to the show were laughing, too.
And from k/.SU's point of view, their goal
was to give us a chance to have a radio expe
rience.and for that I am grateful."S&M in the
Morning" was an absolute pleasure. How
could it not be? I. a college student, had my
own radio show.
You could, too.

Type "S&M in the Morning" or the author's
name into the i Tunes search bar; and see what
happens. Give it a listen, /'hen send your com
