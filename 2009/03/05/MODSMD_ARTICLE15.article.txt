## My beef with Meatless Mondays 
### 
lused to be half-vegetarian. Last year. I
was a vegetarian every other day of the
week. Tuesdays. Thursdays. Saturday and
an optional Sunday were vegetarian days. I
would load up my tray with the organic
greens and root veggies from Lag Dining,
and opt for the spinach lasagna instead of the
meat option (which, by the way, tastes much
better). Unfortunately, this year, living off
campus and sharing groceries with two om
nivorous roommates, it is all I can do to veto
the beef and buy cage-free eggs in my house
hold. My roommates still lament about my
food restrictions and buy sausages. But don't
get me wrong: There are a few reasons for
which I decided to eat less meat, all of which
were good reasons.
As an earth systems co-term, I learn about
the detriments of meat every day in my class
es. F rom talking to vegetarians and my fellow
earth systems buddies. I've concluded that
there are three main reasons to go for the
spinach over the beef. Raising meat is bad for
the environment, an inefficient use of natural
resources and unethical, due to bad condi
tions for animals and meat industry workers.
Most of these problems occur within
America's large, corporation based agricul
tural system. When we think of chickens
being de-beaked or spending their lives con
fined in cages tot) small to ever stretch their
wings, what we are thinking of are condi
tions that exist inside CAFOs (Confined
Animal Feeding Operations, where most of
our meat is raised nowadays). In addition to
that, farmers around the world continually

participate in deforestation in order to cre
ate more grassland for their livestock to
graze. The sewage and waste buildup from
CAFOs also degrade the environment.
Grain-fed animals (most livestock and poul
try) are also extremely inefficient, when tak
ing into consideration the fossil energy
used, from gr;iin production to transport,
ending at the dinner table.
When looking at all these facts, it seems
unfortunate that Stanford students were not
excited about Meatless Mondays ;it I'loMo.
However, as students, we tend to resent
changes and lack of choice, [-specially in Cal
ifornia. the slightest hint towards narrow
mindedness and imposition of values sparks
immediate defensiveness and anger. ITiank
fully. there are ways to eat meat sustainably
that perhaps the environmentalist and vege
tarian students should focus their efforts to
wards. instead of attempting to regulate the
omnivorous members of our dorms.
Stanford Dining is taking big strides to
wards sustainability. At an\ dining hall you
can see local farmer produce and organic
greens, as well as occasional grass fed beef
signs proudly displayed above the hamburg
ers. As students, we can encourage Stanford
Dining to buy meat that is raised sustainably
from small, local.organic farms ITiese farms
exist in California, raising cows on pastures
and allowing chickens and pigs to roam
freelv. ()ne such farm is the Midden Villa or
game farm, located in I os Altos I his small
farm is a lar cry from a ('AFO. Its local lo
cation. sustainable practices and excellent

working and living conditions for workers
and animals should satisfy environmental
ists and animal and labor riehts advocates
alike.
We can work with Stanford to encourage
not only dining halls, hut also Row houses, to
plan ahead enough to order from local or
ganic farms. Students can help by eating the
organic vegetables and meat that Stanford
already supplies, thereby increasing the de
mand for sustainable food. Students in Row
houses can plan with their dining managers
and chefs about ways to buy more sustain
ablv. Students who are especially dedicated
can even volunteer to become sustainability
coordinators for their own dining hall, co-op
or Row house.
Vegetarians, if your chief complaint with
meat lies with environmental concerns or
animal cruelty, why not eat the grass-fed
beef when it appears in the dining hall, or
pasture-raised chicken meat from .1 local or
ganic farm? Similar to sweatshop-made
clothing, the solution is not to just stop buy
ing clothes, but instead to change your buy
ing habits to purchase from places that you
know are ethical. |ust and sustainable. In
stead of try ing to eliminate meat from the
dining hall, let's help Stanford to buy meat in
a sustainable manner.
