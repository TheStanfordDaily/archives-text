The Stanford men's gymnastics
team fell to the Japanese Collegiate
All-Star team last Friday in Burnham
Pavilion, 358.8-361.0. However, the
Cardinal maintained a lead until the
last event and the meet ended with
Stanford producing the highest team
score of any team in the NCAA.
"1 think this gave us the exact
boost that we need going into the
postseason," said sophomore Alex
Buscaglia."We have the fire we need
to continue improving, but we also
aren't too comfortable about it."
The top-ranked Cardinal started
out the meet hitting all six floor rou
tines and receiving its best event
score of the year with a 61.35.
Sophomore Josh Dixon notched the
night's highest score with a 15.6.
while redshirt senior Sho Nakamori
and sophomore Tim Gentry tied for
second with a 15.35. Buscaglia also
performed well, procuring a career
best 15.05.
With the exception of the first
man up. everyone hit their pommel
horse routines as well. Once again,
the Cardinal set a season high with a
59.0. Stanford swept the top four
spots of the night with Nakamori's
14.95, sophomore Kyle Oi's 14.9.
redshirt junior Greg Ter-Zakhari
ants' 14.6 and junior Eric Hergen
rader's 14.55. After two events, the
men had a 4.6-point lead over Japan.
Rings was yet another solid event
for the Stanford squad. Senior
Bryant Madden, ranked No. 1 in the
NCAA on the apparatus, won with a
15.55. Gentry tied for second with a
season-best 15.35.
However, with three solid events
behind them and a significant lead
over the All-Stars from Japan, the
Cardinal began to let up. On vault,
the Stanford men had three unchar
acteristic falls, and only Buscaglia
placed in the top three with a score
of 15.85.
"I feel like we went into vault a
bit too relaxed." Buscaglia said.
"When you are too comfortable, you
sometimes relax into the landing
which, like we experienced, leads to
falls."
Stanford lost momentum on
vault and allowed the Japanese team
to climb back into contention. All
but one of the visiting vaulters
scored 15.650 or higher, highlighted

by Go Tagashira's spectacular per
formance — his vault included a
somersault with a half twist onto the
apparatus, followed by three aerial
twists and a stuck landing — that
earned him a 16.250. Going into the
fifth rotation, the Japanese team
trailed Stanford by just 1.4 points.
On the parallel bars. Nakamori
— No. 1 in the nation — has consis
tently produced the team's highest
score. The redshirt senior placed
third with a 15.45, while Hadden's
14.6 and redshirt senior Jason Shen's
14.5 also helped out the Cardinal.
Meanwhile, the Japanese team took
to the high bar — where they excel
— and continued to shave points off
the Cardinal's lead.
"The event faired better this
meet compared to previous meets."
said freshmen Jordan Nolff."But the
team still feels it has room for im
provement."
After the event, the Japanese
team had moved to within half a
point of the Cardinal's score.
"Going into the last event, we
knew we were going to have to hit
high bar perfectly to maintain our .5
lead over Japan." Nolff said, because
they are excellent on parallel bars."
Unfortunately for Stanford, form
breaks and very hard judging kept
the high bar scores low. Buscaglia
was the top Stanford performer and
placed third with a 15.05. but it ulti
mately wasn't enough. Stanford fell
by 2.2 points. 361.0-358.8. Despite
the loss, the Cardinal put up the
highest NCAA team score this sea
son.
"We are still very satisfied with
our performance." Nolff said. "Hav
ing the best team score in the coun
try this season — during a meet
when not everything went right —
gives us a lot of confidence. We fell
short of our potential on vault and
high bar. but still came out as the top
NCAA team."
The Stanford men certainly be
lieve they have a shot at becoming
NCAA champions this April. On
Saturday, the Cardinal will compete
in Minneapolis against the Golden
Gophers and defending national
champion Oklahoma. With its new
No. I ranking, Stanford must now
prove that it truly is the best team in
the land.
