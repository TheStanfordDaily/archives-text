## Stanford shines at Pac-10 Tourney Card in contention for multiple NCAA bids 
### ZOE LEAVITT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On Monday. Stanford wrestling
posted a seventh-place finish at the
2009 Pacific-10 Conference Tourna
ment. boasting eight individual
place-winners and four top-three
finishers.
For a team that has struggled to
gain confidence throughout the sea
son with a first-year coach and many
rookie wrestlers, the Pac-10 Cham
pionships provided an arena for
proving how greatly its individuals
had grown since August.
While none of the Cardinal
wrestlers qualified automatically for
the NCAA Championships, redshirt
freshman Nick Amuchastegui, red
shirt senior L.uke Feist, junior Jake
Johnson and redshirt sophomore
Lucas Espericueta still hold a slim
chance for qualifying. Placement re
quirements vary by weight class, and
the final qualifications will be an
nounced on March 11.
"I feel we wrestled the best we
wrestled all year." Stanford coach
Jason Borrelli emphasized yester
day. "Unfortunately, the results
don't show that. Even the matches
we lost, the guys were super compet
itive — in the beginning of the sea
son. that would not be so much the
case. 1956 was the last time we had
four guys place in the top three —
that's 20 years — so to not have any
automatic (NCAA| qualifiers is
frustrating. But. we still have an out
side chance at four qualifiers. I'm
happy with that.
Highlights of the tournament

came both from rookie wrestlers
and Pac-10 veterans. Amuchastegui.
one of the Cardinal's rising stars this
season, placed second in his confer
ence tournament debut.The redshirt
freshman had the team's highest fin
ish on the weekend, validating his
impressive season record on a large
stage. With his season record of 75
dual meet points — 23 more than
anyone else on the Stanford team
Amuchastegui established himself
in 2009 as a rookie to be reckoned
with.
Though he had defeated every
other 165-pound wrestler in the Pac
-10 at least once this season.
Amuchastegui knew Boise State's
Tvler Shcrfy — ranked No. 19 in a
January coaches poll — would be his
most difficult opponent. Sherfy and
Amuchastegui battled back and
forth throughout the season:
Amuchastegui defeated the Bron
cos' star in November, but Sherfy
took his revenge by breaking the
Cardinal rookie's 12-match win
streak in the Boise-Stanford duel on
I eb. X. After defeating two other op
ponents to start the weekend,
Amuchastegui faced Sherfy again in
the conference title match. Sherfy
proved an insurmountable oppo
nent, claiming a 4-1 victory over the
Stanford freshman.
"I wanted to win. but I'm not hor
ribly disappointed about it,"
Amuchastegui said. "From the be
ginning of the match I could tell I
wasn't moving well, and [Sherfy| did
a couple things I'd never seen be
fore It was a good showing. If you
told me at the beginning of the year
I'd be second, I wouldn't have be
lieved it."
In his last Pac-10 competition,
senior Luke Feist fulfilled some of
his goals for the year. He placed
third in the 197 pound class, replicat
ing last year's impressive finish, 112 eist
placed fifth in his first Pac-10 ap

pearance, then fourth, then third
but he could not complete the climb
to the top. The five-year veteran
holds mixed feelings about his
achievements.
"It's a bit of a letdown; I didn't
wrestle as well as I would have
liked." Feist admitted. "I followed
last year's pattern pretty much ex
actly. so that kind of sucks. I didn't
come out real well the first day, 1
came out a bit flat, but [on the sec
ond day | I cleaned things up and
came out with a game plan."
Feist fell in his first match to UC-

Davis's Abe Otrombo. After two
subsequent victories, the Stanford
senior once again found himself fac
ing his Aggies rival in the third-place
match. While Otrombo defeated
heist 5-2 in the opening round. Feist
came back to trounce him 6-1.1 low
ever. seventh-ranked Brandon
Halsey of C"al State-Bakersfield
stopped him 12-6 to cement Feist's
position at third.
Junior Jake Johnson far outdid
his performance at last year's Pac-10
Tournament, placing third on Mon
day. He cited clean wrestling as the
reason for his success, something the
coaches have also tried to drill into
the team.
"I wrestled really smart the
whole weekend," Johnson said. "I
had a strategy going into each match
and stuck to it. At the beginning of
the season, I'd get over-fired up and
make mistakes."
Borrelli agreed that Johnson's
improvement was the result of solid
fundamentals and mental strategy.
"Jake never got offensive points
scored on him all weekend, except
for one point for stalling," he said.
Johnson achieved his 30th win of
the season during the tournament,
and lost only to No. 4 Kirk Smith of
Boise State.
"I'm going to be Pac-10 champi
on next year, that's the goal." John

son concluded.
In an unfortunate symmetry,
Tyler Parker — who began the sea
son plagued by injuries and only re
cently recovered — injured his arm
in his semifinal match and was
forced to withdraw. Borrelli called
Parker's injury "the most frustrating
thing in the tournament."
Espericueta netted a career-best
third-place finish after defeating
Oregon State's Jon Brascetta, and
sophomore Cameron Teitleman
achieved a sixth-place finish. Sopho
more Porfirio Madrigal placed sev
enth, and freshman Matt Sccnee
baugh placed eighth.
"Espericueta wrestled the best
he has all year." Borrelli said. "He
was only beat in the finals by a kid in
the top six in the nation."
Now. all the Cardinal wrestlers
can do is wait for the NCAA to an
nounce invitations to the national
championships. On March 11, the
Stanford men will find out if their
season will continue.

Espericueta netted a career-best
third-place finish after defeating
Oregon State's Jon Brascetta, and
sophomore Cameron Teitleman
achieved a sixth-place finish. Sopho
more Porfirio Madrigal placed sev
enth, and freshman Matt Sccnee
baugh placed eighth.
"Espericueta wrestled the best
he has all year." Borrelli said. "He
was only beat in the finals by a kid in
the top six in the nation."
