# Manny, still being Manny
## 
### 
Last weekend. I traveled to Fuller
ton with the baseball team. As
the team boarded the bus for the
long ride back to Stanford after the
final game. 1 sat in the press box scram
bling to write and submit my game
story. While 1 was writing, a single
coach from the Titans remained on the
field, hitting ground balls to a teenage
boy whose father watched from the
dugout while talking on his cell phone.
The boy's father was Scott Boras.
I le was pacing and gesturing as he
spoke animatedly into the phone,
clearly on a business call. At one point,
the drill on the field required a third
person, so he walked to first base, put
on a glove, and started to receive
throws from his son fielding balls at
third — all with the cell phone still to
his ear.
Only one call could have been so
important that he couldn't even hang
up for 15 minutes to help his son prac
tice: it must have been about Manny
Yesterday, the Dodgers and
Manny Ramirez finally agreed to a
two-year deal worth $45 million
the same offer that the Dodgers put on
the table in early November. At that
time, Boras brushed the Dodgers
aside and said he would start consider
ing more "serious offers" from other
teams.
ITie economy tanked and no other
serious offers ever surfaced, but big
name players like Sabathia and
Mark Teixeira still landed massive
contracts. Yes. these came from the
Yankees.but Boras and Manny appar
ently thought that the numbers he put
up in 1..A. — which were absurd, es
pecially in the postseason — could
command the same value.
But they underestimated one
thing: Manny is Manny, and everyone
knows it. Shortly after the trade that
sent him to the Dodgers from Boston,
I wrote in this column that Manny did
n't deserve a contract anywhere and
that he was completely unprofession
al. I le doesn't respect the game and he
doesn't respect whatever contract he
is under. 1 le is a great hitter and can be
hilarious to watch in the field, but he
simply isn't worth the headache.
In that same column, I also said
that someone would inevitably give
him the money he wanted and he
would just continue to do the same
things. 1 le is 36 now and has been act
ing this way for years — you just can't
net an old Mannv to change his wavs.

The Inside Pilch
I was wrong. Someone did pay him
great value, hut no team was willing to
cater to his every demand during the
offseason.Thank you for that, if noth
ing else, economic collapse.
Tlie Dodgers didn't budge, and
they should he applauded for that. $45
million dollars is a huge sum of money,
and they are clearly willing to pay for
the offensive production (and. per
haps even more, the tickets sales) that
he provides. But they weren't willing

to be jerked around or baited by the
threats — "I'll just sit out if I don't get
more money" — of an overgrown
child. The Dodgers' front office and
the broader economic circumstances
forced Manny to "swallow his pride"
and take what was offered — if you
can call signing such a rich contract
that.
But the saga is by no means over.
Now the Dodgers have to keep
Manny content for the next two years
or risk suffering through the same
tantrums he threw in Boston because,
with Manny, contract negotiations
never really end. He can decide he
doesn't want to play — or get on an
airplane before a road series —

whenever he isn't happy. It doesn't
matter if his contract says he is paid to
play baseball; he knows he can do
whatever he wants and still get his mil
lions.
A player with Manny's talent will
get signed somewhere no matter what
baggage he brings, but you can't help
but feel that Scott Boras is a master of
negotiation just for getting someone to
take him at all. And. as I learned
watching him on that field in Fuller
ton, he can pick it at first while doing it.

Erik Adams wonders who is going to be
the agent for Scott Boras 'son ... Nego
tiate with him at ekadams@stanford.
