# Manny, still being Manny
## 
### 
Last weekend. I traveled to Fuller
ton with the baseball team. As
the team boarded the bus for the
long ride back to Stanford after the
final game. 1 sat in the press box scram
bling to write and submit my game
story. While 1 was writing, a single
coach from the Titans remained on the
field, hitting ground balls to a teenage
boy whose father watched from the
dugout while talking on his cell phone.
The boy's father was Scott Boras.
I le was pacing and gesturing as he
spoke animatedly into the phone,
clearly on a business call. At one point,
the drill on the field required a third
person, so he walked to first base, put
on a glove, and started to receive
throws from his son fielding balls at
third — all with the cell phone still to
his ear.
Only one call could have been so
important that he couldn't even hang
up for 15 minutes to help his son prac
tice: it must have been about Manny
Yesterday, the Dodgers and
Manny Ramirez finally agreed to a
two-year deal worth $45 million
the same offer that the Dodgers put on
the table in early November. At that
time, Boras brushed the Dodgers
aside and said he would start consider
ing more "serious offers" from other
teams.
ITie economy tanked and no other
serious offers ever surfaced, but big
name players like Sabathia and
Mark Teixeira still landed massive
contracts. Yes. these came from the
Yankees.but Boras and Manny appar
ently thought that the numbers he put
up in 1..A. — which were absurd, es
pecially in the postseason — could
command the same value.
But they underestimated one
thing: Manny is Manny, and everyone
knows it. Shortly after the trade that
sent him to the Dodgers from Boston,
I wrote in this column that Manny did
n't deserve a contract anywhere and
that he was completely unprofession
al. I le doesn't respect the game and he
doesn't respect whatever contract he
is under. 1 le is a great hitter and can be
hilarious to watch in the field, but he
simply isn't worth the headache.
In that same column, I also said
that someone would inevitably give
him the money he wanted and he
would just continue to do the same
things. 1 le is 36 now and has been act
ing this way for years — you just can't
net an old Mannv to change his wavs.
