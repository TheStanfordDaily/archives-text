Cardinal a chance to get revenge on
Saint Mary's and gain some momentum

Texas Longhorns. one of the top ranked
squads in the country.

knew that Fullerton was a good team."

that we could go down there and win
some games. Again, we were surprised to
lose all three, but sometimes that just
happens in baseball. We will just have to

NOTES: After a three-game sweep at Cal State-
Fullerton last weekend, the Cardinal hopes to get
back on track against an undefeated Longhorns
squad. But Stanford must first contend with the
Gaels, a team that has already proven dangerous
by beating the Cardinal last Wednesday. Junior
righthander Jeffery Inman should get the start Fri
day, while a variety of Cardinal pitchers are ex
pected to take the mound against the Gaels this
evening.

GIULIO
The Gaels (6-2) seem to be stick
ing to what they know against Stan
ford. and have chosen to start fresh
man right-hander Kyle Barraclough.
Barraclough went five strong innings
last week against No. 17 Stanford (2-
5) in his college debut, allowing only
three hits, two walks and no runs on
his way to earning the first win of his
collegiate career. Overall, the Gaels'
pitching staff boasts a 4.44 ERA with
opponents hitting .279 against them.
In contrast. Stanford seems to be
saving its pitchers for the match-up
against Texas over the weekend.
More than likely. Stanford will be
"'pitching by committee." with many
players pitching one or two innings
just as a warm-up for the weekend.
The Cardinal has a 6.49 ERA with op
ponents batting .295 against them for
this season, which doesn't bode well
against the Gaels' rookie starter.
Stanford's pitcher in shining armor
of the moment is freshman left-han
der Brett Mooneyham. In his colle
giate debut on Saturday, Mooneyham
struggled in the first inning, doling out
three runs to No. 10 Fullerton. but
managed to shut them out for the next
four frames. Unfortunatelv. Mooney

ham lost his first college baseball
game by only one run.The young lefty
has the second lowest ERA on the
team at 3.6 X, and also has five strike
outs over 7.1 innings pitched.
Offensively, the Gaels' not-so-se
cret weapon seems to be freshman
Troy Channing, who is hitting at a
.4X4 clip with three homers and a .561
on base percentage for the season.
Last week alone, he hit one double,
two home runs and had six RBI.
Backing up Channing's impressive
statistics is sophomore Greg Ditmer
with a .345 average over all eight
games of the season and a .441 on
base percentage.
For tomorrow's game. Stanford's
prime concern is offense. In its three
game series against Fullerton. the
Cardinal had trouble stringing hits to
gether. In its last game of the series.
Stanford got nine hits to Fullerton's
10. and the Titans took the game. 9-3.
Some of Stanford's recent top hit
ters include Kiilsgaard, sophomore
Zach Jones and senior Joey August.
Jones sports a .222 batting average,
having played in all seven games this
season. He also smashed one over the
fence and hit a timely single this past

weekend to help the Cardinal effort.
August.also a routine starter, grabbed
two hits off Fullerton and boasts a
.250 average. Lastly, Kiilsgaard had
two RBIs and a double over the
weekend â€” he has tallied a solid .333
batting average over five games
played.
Though Stanford has been strug
gling. the men have shown promise.
The rain has crunched Stanford's
schedule together, but it seems to
have rallied the players even more for
a great weekend of baseball.
"Our main focus is definitely to
step up our offensive game." Kiils
gaard said. "With all the rain, we have
to be pretty flexible, but it's really just
an issue of staying focused. We want
to come out with a vengeance and
have a good game to get started on for
the weekend against Texas."
Today's game kicks off at 5 p.m.. as
does Friday's opener against No. 4
Texas (10-0). Games will start at 1
p.m. on Saturday and Sunday, and all
contests will be played on Klein Field
at Sunken Diamond.
