# WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
## BRING THE HEAT Stanford women welcome Arizona, ASU to Maples 
### NATE ADAMS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
ITie Stanford women's basket
ball team will wrap up its regular
season this weekend, playing the
final home games of 2008-2009
against Arizona and Arizona
State. After California's loss to
UCLA last Sunday, a split would
secure a share of the regular-sea
son Pacific-10 Conference title for
the Cardinal, while a sweep would
win it outright. This would be
Stanford's ninth consecutive Pac
-10 championship.
Despite its recent stretch of
commanding victories, a pair of
Cardinal wins — and in this case,
the outright conference title —
are far from a sure thing against
the Arizona schools. When the
now-No. 2 Cardinal (24-4. 15-1
Pac-10) visited Tucson to kick off
2009. the Sun Devils and Wildcats

both put Stanford to work, com
bining to hold Stanford to its nar
rowest combined margin of victo
ry for a two-game series against
conference opponents this season.
In the two months since. Ari
zona State (22-6.14-2) has earned
a No. IS national ranking, is third
in the Pac-10, and is riding a con
ference-leading 14-game winning
streak. Arizona (11-16, 4-12) has
struggled in conference play, but
remains a challenging opponent.
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer gave plenty of respect to
both.
"Both teams are really, really
good — despite Arizona State's
much better record." she said.
"Our last road trip [toTucson] was
very tough.They both gave us fits,
and we're really going to have to
play well and do the right things in
order to be successful against
them."

VanDerveer has confidence
that her team, though relatively
young, will not he distracted on
the court by the prospect of a con
ference title. Rather, she thinks it
will only improve their play.gi\ ing

"I think it's definitely motivat
ing." she said."lt doesn't get better
than having a chance to win a
championship in your own gym.
Everything that we do is focused
towards winning a championship,
whether its giving a screen,taking
a charge, getting out and playing
defense. So as a player or a coach,
we'll do whatever we need to get it
done."

the Cardinal will be boosted by

mid-January, Stanford has gone un
defeated at home and won 1 1
straight — including an impressive
sweep of USC and UCLA last
weekend in Los Angeles.
Of particular note against the
L.A. schools was sophomore Kayla
Pederson. who averaged 20 points
and (5.5 rebounds per game on the
weekend. The 6-foot-4 forward also
went 7-12 from beyond the three
point line,and was awarded with her
first U.S. Bank Pac-10 Player of the
Week award for her efforts.
Pederson's coach couldn't have
been more pleased with her efforts,
and is looking forward to seeing her
take the court again this weekend.
"She had a great weekend. "Van
derveer said. "Her scoring and her
rebounding were great, and I
thought she was consistent, which
has always been her trademark.
She's steady, and puts in a great ef
fort in practice and everywhere. She
really battles adversity and encour
ages teammates."
"I guess evervthing finally start-

Ed to click,and my shots were falling
[last weekend]," Pederson said."l'm
not much for individual awards: I'm
just trying to help my team. We're
going to look at Arizona and move
on from there."
Pederson knows her team has
work to do to prepare for this week
end.
"We're going to watch a lot of
video on Arizona, especially for de
fending their high close drives," she
said. "We had a lot of trouble with
that last time. And for ASU, we just
need to get used to their pressure
defense."
While Pederson was playing her
way to an award last weekend, one
of her teammates, sophomore Jean
nette Pohlen. had a bad scare when
she took an elbow to the eye against
USC. VanDerveer is confident she'll
be alright soon, however.
"It was scary, like any injury with
an eye," the coach said. "But. she
should be line to start this week
end."
Adding to the weekend's excite

ment, this Saturday will be Stan
ford's Senior Night. The Cardinal's
graduating class this year comprises
only two players: Jillian Harmon
and Morgan Clyburn.
"For the two of them, it's been a
case of extremes, in a way," Van
derveer reflected. "Jill's had four
years of a lot of play time, a thou
sand points, and started almost
every game. Morgan's been more of
a behind-the-scenes role-player, and
this year with her foot injury she's
been out of action. Both have been
key to this team's success in differ
ent ways. We'll be sad tosee them go.
and I'm glad to have had both in our
program."
Stanford will open up against
Arizona tonight at 7 p.m.. and will
continue against Arizona State on
Saturday at 12:30 p.m. Both games
will be in Maples Pavilion, and will
be broadcast live on 90.1 I'M k/Sl I
