## BRING THE HEAT Stanford women welcome Arizona, ASU to Maples 
### NATE ADAMS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
ITie Stanford women's basket
ball team will wrap up its regular
season this weekend, playing the
final home games of 2008-2009
against Arizona and Arizona
State. After California's loss to
UCLA last Sunday, a split would
secure a share of the regular-sea
son Pacific-10 Conference title for
the Cardinal, while a sweep would
win it outright. This would be
Stanford's ninth consecutive Pac
-10 championship.
Despite its recent stretch of
commanding victories, a pair of
Cardinal wins — and in this case,
the outright conference title —
are far from a sure thing against
the Arizona schools. When the
now-No. 2 Cardinal (24-4. 15-1
Pac-10) visited Tucson to kick off
2009. the Sun Devils and Wildcats

both put Stanford to work, com
bining to hold Stanford to its nar
rowest combined margin of victo
ry for a two-game series against
conference opponents this season.
In the two months since. Ari
zona State (22-6.14-2) has earned
a No. IS national ranking, is third
in the Pac-10, and is riding a con
ference-leading 14-game winning
streak. Arizona (11-16, 4-12) has
struggled in conference play, but
remains a challenging opponent.
Stanford head coach Tara Van-
Derveer gave plenty of respect to
both.
"Both teams are really, really
good — despite Arizona State's
much better record." she said.
"Our last road trip [toTucson] was
very tough.They both gave us fits,
and we're really going to have to
play well and do the right things in
order to be successful against
them."

VanDerveer has confidence
that her team, though relatively
young, will not he distracted on
the court by the prospect of a con
ference title. Rather, she thinks it
will only improve their play.gi\ ing
them extra iocus.
"I think it's definitely motivat
ing." she said."lt doesn't get better
than having a chance to win a
championship in your own gym.
Everything that we do is focused
towards winning a championship,
whether its giving a screen,taking
a charge, getting out and playing
defense. So as a player or a coach,
we'll do whatever we need to get it
done."
Besides a chance at the title,
the Cardinal will be boosted by
the considerable wave of momen
tum they've built up over the last
few weeks. Since losing to Cal in
