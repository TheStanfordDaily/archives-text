## GROUP CONDEMNS RICE Anti-Rice petition makes war crimes allegations 
### ZOE RICHARDS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford Says No To War (SSNW) has
begun distributing a petition regarding
Condoleezza Rice's return to Stanford.
"We are concerned about serious allega
tions that Rice has violated our constitution,
domestic laws and international law." reads
the petition letter, which is addressed to the
Stanford community. SSNW is concerned
that Rice's actions have "endangered
American people."
"(The petition was drafted] in light of
Rice's war mongering and torture." said
Symbolic Systems Prof. Todd Davies, who is
a member of SSNW.
The petition alleges that Rice was
involved with perpetuating misinformation
surrounding the threats posed by Iraq to

U.S. national security and condemns her
alleged support of torturing detainees at
Guantanamo Bay.
It was presented at the Condi Un-wel
coming Committee Meeting attended by
students, professors and activists in the sur
rounding community, Wednesday night in
Old Union.
"We don't want to be a part of an institu
tion that legitimates a war criminal," said
Charlotte Silver '()9. "In the name of aca
demic freedom, people are okay with what is
a matter of fundamental values and turning
our back to the international community."
SSNW has goals both within and outside
of University jurisdiction. The organization
hopes to break a perceived double standard
between students and faculty and would like
to educate people about Rice's actions and
lower her stature on campus. Adam I iudson
'10. president of the organization, empha
sized the need for the University to apply
the Fundamental Standard not only to stu
dents. but to faculty as well.
"Students are held to a very high stan
dard in and outside the University." Hudson

said. "That standard should be applied to
faculty as well."
Geoff Browning, minister of United
Campus Christian Ministry on campus, said
that the primary goal of the petition is
accountability.
"We can't prevent war crimes unless we
hold people who commit crimes account
able," Browning said. I le challenged the fac
ulty handbook, and the University's lenient
policies about welcoming faculty back
regardless of their actions outside of the
University.
"It's as if it doesn't matter if you're Hitler
or anyone," Browning said.
SSNW would also like to see a city reso
lution passed, calling for Rice's arrest and to
see Rice put on trial or have tenure hearings
for her actions.
"Neutrality helps oppression," Browning
said. "If we don't condemn [Rice's actions]
or seek justice, we are supporting it."
I le demanded that the University take a
strong position to let students know that it is
aware of Rice's alleged offenses against
human rights, the U.S. Constitution and

international law.
Although some attendees of the town
hall admitted that they initially decided to
come to the meeting to vent their rage, one
activist mentioned that Rice is a great wit
ness of alleged war crimes that were com
mitted and that going after her may not be
the right approach.
Regardless of this point, others contend
ed that Rice doesn't belong at an elite insti
tution that they say should be standing
against war criminals.
"I don't think she should be here."
Hudson said.
But as long as she is. Hudson emphasized
the importance that she answer to students
as a public servant rather than dominate the
discussion. I le also implored students to ask
her meaningful questions.
"It is my conscience that is my main moti
vation." Hudson said. "We can't take back
the lives of dead Americans and dead Iraqis
— but we can say we won't put up with it."
