## Slates fail to agree on spending caps 
### MARISA LANDICHO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Campaign finance reform in student elections has
been a priority of ASSU Executives Jonny Dorsey '09 and
Fagan Harris '09. and has been discussed repeatedly by
the Undergraduate Senate and Graduate Student
Council in recent weeks. But with no ASSU-mandated
solution on the horizon, the three sophomore slates met
yesterday in hopes of establishing a spending cap them
selves.
Because of timing and disagreements on enforcement,
no dollar amount or formal policy was agreed upon at the
meeting, though the three contending slates did promise
to uphold certain ideals.
In the past. ASSU election policy has not included any
spending limits. Recent campaign chests have mush
roomed due to the introduction of campaigning via T
shirts. In total, slates running for ASSU Executive in 2(X)8
spent a reported $5,606.16 on shirts alone.
"It has become the issue of who has more T-shirts, and
it becomes a spending race." said Ross Darwin '12. run
ning under the slate "Hardcore as a Sophomore." "We
want it to be more about our platforms and what our
ideas will be when we're in office."
Darwin's slate approached the other two slates last
week about setting up a meeting and creating an opt-in
finance limit for the sophomore class president race.
"Stanford doesn't have any sort of limit at all on
spending, and I think that it'd be really cool if we were the
innovative class that decided to change the way races are
run.' said fellow Hardcore as a Sophomore candidate
Erin Olivella-Wright '12.
Members from all slates were present at the meeting
and Edith Wu. director of New Student Programs and
advisor to Frosh Council, acted as mediator.
The hopes for swiftly accepting a comprehensive poli
cy. however, were quickly dashed.
The slate Hardcore as a Sophomore initially proposed
a limit of $800 for the entire value of campaign materials,
and included donations in the money limit.
Last year's sophomore class slates "McLeven," "Oh-
Lovin " and"The Soph Touch" spent $605.01. $331.00 and
$667.32 respectively. Soph Touch won the election.
Darwin argued that the figures from 2008 were artifi
cially low because they did not include the value of donat
ed goods. He said an $800 total cap would be reasonable.
The classification of donations halted the progress of
the meeting.
"We got caught up in some of the details, so really
nothing got decided at all." said Francisco Martinez '12.
from the slate "Soph Corps."
Martinez reported that the croup did leave with a con

sensus on election
values, like being
responsible and fru
gal throughout the
campaign.
Any further
agreement was
hampered by the
fact that the infor
mational campaign
policy meeting, origi
nally to be held last
Monday, was pushed
back to March 9.
The candidates still
did not know the
actual election reg
ulations and were
hesitant to sign any
thing before receiv
ing the rules.
Darwin and
Olivella-Wright
were optimistic about instituting some kind of cap. and
they plan on holding another meeting before the end of
the quarter. Without a cap. the two said they would tenta
tively spend around $800. depending on the spending of
the other slates.
Many in the current ASSU have expressed the need
for reining in exorbitant campaign spending, but the body
is yet to agree on the specifics.
In the last two weeks, both the Undergraduate Senate
and the Graduate Student Council (CISC) approved a
public financing scheme that will refund up to $750 to
slates running for Executive. The GSC version of the bill
included an overall cap of $ 1.5(H).
A mandated spending cap of $ 1.5(H) for all ASSU can
didates. however, was rejected by the Senate on Feb. 24.
As it stands, candidates are able to use an unlimited
amount of personal funds for their own campaigns.
Martinez of Soph Corps acknowledged the complexi
ties of producing a binding spending limit.
"Our slate felt that we're all capable of self-regulating,
and maybe imposing a spending cap may restrain some
people." he said. "But at the same time, we do understand
that this is an economic recession."
Martinez said his slate would spend in the ballpark of
$200-SI(HH). hinging upon Monday's informational meet
ing.
The remaining sophomore slate, "So-Phly," declined to
comment.
