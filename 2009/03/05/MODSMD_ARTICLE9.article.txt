## GSC discusses future activities Council members concerned with high cost of planned events 
### DANIEL BUI STAFF WRITER 
Willi financing running low across the University, the
Graduate Student Council (GSC) discussed funding
options for a number of upcoming student activities last
night.
The council primarily talked about ways in which the
$1,700 dollars allocated to increasing voter turnout in the
upcoming GSC elections could be used. Assistant Director
of Graduate Elections Natasha Cave spoke with the dele
gates about a proposed "Grad Vote and Dine" program
that would offer a catered meal to those who come to vote.
However, a number of delegates expressed concern
over the high cost of the event and wondered if there were
more cost-effective options to encourage turnout. Even so.
others believed that the extra cost would be helpful to the
graduate community in other ways.
"This is not just about getting people to vote." said GSC
co-Chair Polina Segalova. "We have funding set aside for
events that make graduate students happy, and this is
something [that they would enjoy]."
With the Vote and Dine program being only one of
many potential student activities, delegates also considered
the need to transfer funds from the reserve account to help
fund future events. While most members agreed that
finances were running low. some questioned the immedia
cy of the issue.
"I think the only thing that we need to be concerned
about now is if we're willing to transfer the money at some
point" suggested Nanna Notthoff. first-year graduate stu
dent in psychology. "We just have to decide whether or not
we have to do it and how much."
Delegates also expressed concern about potential abus
es of the new funds. A few members suggested a transfer
cap as a means of preventing student groups from taking
advantage of the new resources.
"I see the necessity of having a cap because it shouldn't
be indiscriminant," added Addy Satija. second-year stu
dent in electrical engineering.
Members also discussed a remodeling of the CiSC Web
site to increase its ease of use.
"What we've decided to do is look into hiring a profes
sional contractor to get the Web site up and running,"
explained co-Chair George Bloom. Stanford students
would be hired to maintain the Web site henceforth.
The CiSC ended the meeting by approving a $2,000
budget for the Easter Egg Roll to be held later this year.
