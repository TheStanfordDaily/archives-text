# Gaiman Wins Newberry, revives spirit
## 
### 
This year's Nevvbery Medal —
the most prestigious award in
children's literature — went to
the acclaimed author Neil Gaiman for
his most recent work "The Graveyard
Book." The story, according to
Gaiman, is that of "this two-year-old
whose family is killed and who is
adopted and brought up by dead peo
ple — and taught all the things that
dead people know." (Any echoes of
Kipling's The Jungle Book are entirely
intentional.) As thousands of readers
fell in love with the orphaned protag
onist, Nobody Owens, "The
Graveyard Book" rapidly rose to num
ber one on The New York Times's chil
dren's bestsellers list — where it has
remained for twenty-one weeks and
counting.
While appearing on the best
sellers list is not out of the ordinary
for the likes of Neil Gaiman, it is the
first time in five years that the
Newbery winner has even appeared
on the list. The author himself com
mented that that "there are books that
are best sellers and books that are win
ners.
Librarians, too, have in recent
years observed a disheartening trend
in Newbery picks that tend towards
more literary merit at the expense of
accessibility. They have argued that
the Newbery, by virtue of its commit
tee's annual selections, has done more
to dissuade children from reading
than encourage them. Recent winning
titles have all been laden with somber,
mature, and frankly depressing
themes, not to mention prose edging
well into adult territory. Gritics of the
Newbery panel have accused it of los
ing sight of its original goals and the
population it was created to serve,
deviating from the original goal of
selecting the finest of each year's chil
dren's literature to choosing books
that the judges themselves, as adults,
find most artistic and enjoyable.
This year's selection temporary
ends that debate — Gaiman's "The
Graveyard Book" is a favorite amongst
children and adults alike. Librarians,
too, rejoice over a winner that — at
long last — hast both literary merit
and is engaging. As "The Guardian"
said when it released news of the win
ning book in the U.K.: "Gaiman's
Newbery win is a vote for populism
— and for excellenc."
