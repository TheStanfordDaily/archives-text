# THEATRE REVIEW
## Make way for "BroadwAsian" 
### 
This weekend, drama major Ellie
Wen '09 will debut her senior
project, entitled "BroadwAsian,"
at the Prosser Studio Theater.
"BroadwAsian" is not your average
musical; instead, it's a compilation of
Broadway numbers and monologues.
But "BroadwAsian" is not just a fun
show to watch with music from
Broadway and charming monologues —
there is a moral behind the story.
"BroadwAsian" is specifically about
the role of Asian performers on
Broadway. Typecasting and stereotypes
are only two of the number of subjects
that the show touches upon — the cast
urges the audience to think about the
broader spectrum of Asian influence.
Interspersed between music from the
modern day ("Mulan") going back to the
fifties ("Miss Saigon") are personal
monologues from the actors. The mostly
Asian cast uses the stereotypes intro
duced to ask questions about aspects of
Asian-American culture not typically
discussed.
The show begins with a light-heart
ed yet pithy song from "Avenue Q" —
"Everyone's a Little Bit Racist" to intro
duce the touchy subject of racism. The
song is happy enough, though, to inspire
a communal relationship between the
audience and players, immediately free of
negativity — and that is what Wen is try
ing to do. Through the song and dance,
she shares some of her own doubts about
theatre and her expected role in it. Her
worries about typecasting, stereotypes
into which Asians are forced, and the
limited mobility of Asian actors are vent
ed to the audience in order to foster the
recognition of inequality. Llowever, the

musical is not meant to bludgeon moral
ity onto the audience by any means. It is
simply a clever showcase of talent meant
to unearth an unthought-of issue.
Wen does not do it alone, though —
a talented four-piece band led by music
director Nick Hersh performs against the
back wall. Songs from "Miss Saigon,"
"South Pacific" and "Flower Drum Song"
promote the musical's Asian aura. All the
music is played by a band consisting of
cello, drums, brass and piano, lending a
professional air to the entire perform
ance.
The cast and ensemble also dip into
the strengths of Talisman, Ram's Head
theatre group and the Stanford
Symphony Orchestra — who all come
together to create a great performance.
The staging is simple and the set is plain,
but the actors move about as if the stage
were their bedroom. During their mono
logues, they are comfortable in their
space and inspire the audience to invent
a greater set for them.
The most important part of
"BroadwAsian," however, is the sensitivi
ty with which Wen wrote the mono
logues. You may agree with her ideas, or
you may find yourself arguing silently
with her — but that's the point. Wen
inspires thought. Either way, you won't
look at Broadway the same again.
"BroadwAsian" will play March 5, 6,
and 7 at 8 p.m., with a special 2 p.m.
showing on March 7. All performances
are in Prosser Studio Theater in
Memorial Hall.
