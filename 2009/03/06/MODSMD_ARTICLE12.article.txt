# FiLM REVIEW
## Harvey Milk: the original hero 
### 
Un Feb. 28, the Stanford Film
and Media Studies Department screened a
newly restored version of the 1984 Academy-Award
winning documentary "The Times of Harvey Milk" at
Cubberley Auditorium. Afterward, the film's cine
matographer, Frances Reid, and editor, Deborah
I foffman, answered questions from the audience.
"As President of the Board of Supervisors, it is
my duty to announce that Mayor George Moscone
and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot and
killed. The suspect is supervisor Dan White." Dianne
Feinstein's grave comment, accompanied by the
crowd's screams of anger and disbelief, marks the
beginning of the film. Thus is how the audience
immediately learns of the tragic 1977 assassination of
the first openly gay San Francisco supervisor Harvey
Milk, whose dazzling political career and gay rights
activism inspired the film's director, Rob Epstein.
"We decided to start the movie with Dianne
Feinstein's announcement because we wanted to let
our audience know that Harvey would get killed
eventually" said Deborah Hoffman, the documen
tary's editor. "The hardest task, however, was to make
the audience fall in love with Harvey during the
movie and mourn his death through showing his suc
cessful election as a supervisor and his efforts in bat
tling Proposition ft (the ban on gay teachers in
California, initiated by John Briggs in 1978]
In light of the success of California's Proposition
8, which banned same-sex marriage, "The Times of
Harvey Milk" is an eye-opening documentary which
makes one realize the amount of effort that was put
into achieving equality for gay citizens and just how
fragile and relatively new these rights are. For audi
ences, even long after the movie ends, the image of
I larvey Milk, a charismatic gay businessman from the
Castro district who had to wait four years before
finally winning elections to the Board of Supervisors,
remains with the audience.
In addition to relating the message of Milk's
ground-breaking social activism, the filmmakers were
also revolutionaries in their own right; in the early
'80s, when the film was made, it was considered out-

rageous to be shooting a movie about
homosexuals.
"We couldn't tell people outside of

San Francisco what we were working on
— the theme was so shocking for the
majority of Americans," Hoffman said.
The creators of "The Times of
Harvey Milk" didn't want to produce a
one-dimensional eulogy to Milk.
Instead they brought together the
results of significant archival research
and interviews to illuminate Harvey's
complex personality, good and bad,
and reconstruct the feeling of that
time. "We didn't use the archival
* news footage in order to announce

news in the story line but to show how
Harvey's contemporaries received the news,
so that the movie audience could better
understand those people's reactions, emo
tions, what kind of time they were living in,"

Hoffman explained.
Understanding the title of the documentary
is the key to understanding the idea behind the
film and the reason for this documentary's
refusal to put Milk's personal relationships at the
center of the film (as the recent new film "Milk"
starring Sean Penn does). The original 1984

movie tells a story that is larger than Milks biog
raphy in order to demonstrate the political and social
situation in America of the '70s — a time when the
country was reluctant to accept the existence of open
ly gay citizens.
both Hoffman and Reid attributed the relative
absence of stories about Harvey's partners on fheir
insistence to relate the story of Milk in the context of
his time, and stressed their desire to not simply pro
duce a biography of the talented politician.
Considering the current increased attention to
Harvey Milk's life in light of the Oscar-winning fea
ture film, "The Times of Harvey Milk" is a must-see
for those who want to know how the movie "Milk"
was born. Epstein's documentary is a skeleton for the
later "Milk" — a fact that becomes clear after watch
ing both films. The screenwriter of "Milk," Dustin
Lance Black, had been fascinated by the documentary
ever since college when he started thinking of ways of
bringing 1 larvey's storv to the wider public. Many of
the ways in which the documentarians frame their
story are curiously used by Black in his script.
In response to what she thought of "Milk," cine
matographer Frances Reid added, "1 came out of this
movie and thought to myself: That's why I love doc
umentary films."' Despite its purely brief mention of
Milk's personal life, "The Times of I larvey Milk" is far
more convincing and authentic in its effort to make
the audience fall in love with the politician. The doc
umentary offers something that Sean Penn could not
replicate — the real Harvey, not the overly flamboy
ant, effeminate and fake Sean Penn version but rather
an intelligent, at times obnoxious yet charismatic
coalition builder who galvanized not only the gay vot
ers but also senior citizens and the working class into
forming an effective voting bloc.
