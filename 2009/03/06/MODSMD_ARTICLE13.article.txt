# All the single ladies, put your hands up

"All you other girls, go ahead and stick 'em up.
Boys? Hey, go for it. We're not judging you"
If you don't know what I'm talking about, you clearly are not familiar with
the viral hit music video, "Single Ladies (Put a Ring On It)" by Beyonce —
or Sasha Fierce, if you buy into her new alter ego. Rather than creating a
typically tasteless music video featuring nakecT women writhing in saunas
(Britney Spears, I'm looking at you), Beyonce created a full, three-and-a-half
minute-long choreographed routine. The Fosse-inspired dance routine is so
catchy and appealing that many of Beyonce's fans have taken it upon them
selves to learn it. There's a plethora of YouTubc videos featuring Beyonce fans
of every color and gender shaking their hips, sashaying fiercely and kick-ball
chain-ing for all they're worth.
As all good things do, this trend has come to Stanford.
Half of Urban Styles and about 50 wannabe Beyonces gathered in Eliot
Program Center Thursday night to learn the "Single Ladies" dance. The work
shop was led by a fantastic team from Urban Styles and headed by a woman
named Anna Maria.
The event was organized by Natie Ermyas, a program coordinator for the
Black Community Services Center. Although he had originally considered get
ting a professional choreographer to come in and hold a workshop, he ended
up partnering with Urban Styles to lead the event — an excellent choice. The
students leading the workshop were drastically more excited than any paid
choreographer could be, and learning from fellow students was far less impos
ing than a master class with a professional dancer.
Ermyas conceived of the workshop as a comfortable space to turn the
popular trend into a party.
"Everyone docs this in their room," he said. "So I thought, make a space
for it!"
Considering the diversity of the group who wanted to learn Beyonce's
dance, this idea was exactly on the money. The attendees included a large fol
lowing from the Black Community Services Center, a quarter of the women's
Ultimate Frisbee team and one Intermission reporter rockin' out in the back.
Although the crowd was mostly female, a pleasantly surprising number of men
turned out too. We ranged in ability from me, the groove-less girl, up to Anna
Maria, who apparently does not have any bones.
Despite the apparently random sampling of students, we all danced and
had a great time together. The crowd was riotous, hollering at the more sug
gestive moves and occasionally jokingly talking back to the instructors; when
Anna Maria asked us if we felt warmed up and ready to dance, one man yelled
back, "Warm like biscuits!" When we split the group in half and performed for
each other, the audience catcalled and cheered for the other dancers. Ermyas
achieved his goal: We all learned and danced in a comfortable space with each
other's support.
I'm not sure what everybody else at the workshop will be doing with their
newfound knowledge, but I'm planning on hitting the Row this weekend to try
out my new moves. Single ladies? Anyone with me?
