## U2: good, but not revolutionary 
### 
For a band that prides itself on reinven
tion and relevance, U2 seems to be
struggling to find something new after
almost 30 years in the music business. Not
that there's anything wrong with that — the
style they've settled on suits them perfectly,
and their rousing rock ballads make "No
Line" a guaranteed commercial success. But
to say that U2 is "not staying where it is," as
Bono claimed it would with its newest album,
is being a little too generous and detracts
from the album's positive qualities.
The opening track, also called "No Line
on the Horizon," sets the tone for most of the
album: heavy, Edge-driven rhythms (the
iconic sound that so many young bands strive
to imitate), Bono alternating between rasping
and impassioned cries and plenty of "oh, oh,
oh" riffs. With this song and a handful of oth
ers on the album, the lyrics aren't the carry
ing force here; in fact, looking at them too
closely just highlights their haphazard quali
ty. Instead, it's better to consider them as ves
sels for the sound of the music.
Most of "No Line" falls into two cate
gories: songs that attempt, with varying
degrees of success, to push the boundaries of
U2's sound for something fresher, and songs
that capitalize on the epic, larger-than-life
style that U2 has used to great effect for
almost a decade. In the middle of the album,
however, a few songs break outside the
boundaries of these categories. "Unknown
Caller" opens with intriguing birdsong but
quickly shifts into technology-laden lyrics
("Force quit and move to trash / Restart and
re-boot yourself") in a monotone chant — a
heavy-handed attempt at relevance to an
information age that distances the listener
from the band.
"Get On Your Boots" was chosen as the
album's first single, to the dismay of many U2
fans. "Boots" is not only a disjointed overly
eager mess catered for radio play, but it's also
far from representative of the album — so for
those who were worried that "No Line"
would play out like a rehash of "Vertigo," rest
assured. " This docs make for a bit of a jolt
when "Boots" comes on after five soaring and
meditative tracks, as Bono announces "I
don't want to talk about wars between
nations / Not right now" and goes on to extol
the virtues of sexy boots — not exactly the

anthem one might expect from the global
activist.
To the band's credit, however, this isn't
just a revisiting of their two previous
albums. U2 mixes up some slower, more
experimental ballads with sampling, synthe
sizers and seven-minute epic pieces. A cou
ple fall short of what they could have been,
especially "White as Snow." "Moment of
Surrender," however, is a success with pon
derous lyrics: "It's not if I believe in love /
But if love believes in me." But "punching
numbers into the ATM machine"? Come on,
Bono, we all know the "M" already stands
for machine. Otherwise, the meditative and
sparse sound highlights the inner turmoil of
the lyrics and provides a welcome breather
in an energetic album.
The rest of "No Line" wastes no time
giving the fans what they've come to love
and expect from the Dublin band. "I'll Go
Crazy if I Don't Go Crazy Tonight" is your
typical U2 pop song, with spoken-word
poetry lyrics and those soaring melodic
lines that feel as though they should be sung
from the top of a mountain. "Magnificent"
and "Breathe" are also quintessential U2
pieces — with catchy riffs and idealistic
lyrics about "Only love/Only love can heal
such a scar," "Magnificent" is especially the
atrical with Bono putting naysayers to
shame with his still-strong vocal stylings. In
the end, these are the tracks where the band
really seems to fall into place; although their
experimentation paid off at times, this is the
kind of music they were made to play, famil
iar as it might sound.
"No Line," on the whole, is a comfort
ing and inspiring foray into U2's already
established sound. The pace, with a few
exceptions, is relentless; tiring but tiresome.
For a band that once completely overturned
expectations with innovative albums such as
"Achtung Baby," it's somewhat sad to see
them producing more of the same and
claiming, as they do each time, that the
album is something completely new. If you
were a fan already (and not one of the fans
who refuses to listen to anything post
"Joshua Tree") then there's no reason not to
enjoy this album. "No Line" is another fine
album in a vast and respectable discography
— but it probably won't be winning over
new hearts anytime soon.
