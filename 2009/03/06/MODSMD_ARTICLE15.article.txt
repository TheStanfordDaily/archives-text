## Kelly Clarkson: back to the original winning formula 
### 
I firmly believe that people who say they don't
like Kelly Clarkson are definitely not telling the
truth. She captured our hearts as the first
American Idol (back when the show was still
good) and proceeded to become a very successful
artist on her own. In fact, she became so popular
that people even forgot she made her name on
American Idol.
Then, two years ago, "My December" hap
pened. Kelly's third album, which was very badly
received and did very poorly in sales, hurt her rep
utation so much that she ended up having to can
cel her tour and fire her manager. "My December"
was a foray into a completely different sound; that
album wanted to proclaim that the Kelly who sang
uplifting ballads or girly pop-rock anthems was
gone. However, the new Kelly sang rock songs that
completely wasted her incredible vocals and made
a fool out of an otherwise reputable artist.
This time around, however, Intermission pre
dicts that Kelly Clarkson's fourth album, "All I Ever
Wanted," will be a smash success. Everything about
this album screams mainstream, but this fact is
pulled off so perfectly that the album still sounds
entirely new and different. It's just the sort of
catchy, spunky, artful pop that will translate into
healthy album sales.
For all of the ladies — single or otherwise -
there are plenty of' Since U Been Gonc'-esque
anthems on this album. If the album s first single,
"My Life Would Suck Without You," was not to
your liking, do not fret. That single's purpose was
to finally get Kelly back on to the radio airwaves.
The rest of the album shows Kelly trying on a
number of different sounds — though all pop
sounds (she won't test any other waters anymore).
Singing two songs originally written and per
formed by Katy Perry, Kelly manages to make them
completely her own. "I Do Not I look Up" is one
such example, where Kelly's vocals shine through
out the fun anthem.
I lowever, not every song is a success on this
album. In "Whyyouwannabringmedown," Kelly
again goes into an awkward attempt at a mix of
rock, rap and whine. In Intermission's opinion, she
should stay away from this kind of sound at all
costs; this is the kind of song that will be skipped
in the tracklist. The rest of the material is all solid,
though.
"All I Ever Wanted" is exactly the album Kelly
needs at this stage in her career. After the disaster
that was "My December" — leaving her with zero
self-confidence and a thinner following — this
new album is a surefire comeback for her. While
"All I Ever Wanted" is nothing groundbreaking or
particularly deep and soulful, it will nonetheless be
a treat for those who have always liked Kelly
Clarkson — which, face it, is all of us.
