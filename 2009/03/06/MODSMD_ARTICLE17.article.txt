# Looking back at Parents' Weekend
## 
### 
Roxy doesn't fail a lot. She's never failed a
test (especially a French test). She's never
failed to get a guy — Roxy once saw a hot
guy in a coma, and well, let's just say she can raise
the dead. She's never even failed to get a job
(details not necessary).
But, dear reader, Roxy failed you last week.
While Ms. Sass discussed how the economic cri
sis might dampen your spirits but not your
underwear, she overlooked a very important
event happening on campus: Parents' Weekend.
Roxy looks at Parents' Weekend like whale does a
school of fish — lots to nibble on, and every
thing's wet. She spent last weekend rattling head
boards harder than an 8.0 earthquake, and deeply
(very deeply) regretted not sharing some valuable
tips with her readers.
Never fear, loyal readers. Parents' Weekend
comes every year, and you can too. True, twelve
months will pass before you get a chance to move
the parents' welcome out of Mem Aud and into
your bedroom. But you'll also have ample oppor
tunities throughout the year to scam on a visiting
MILF, DILF or even GILF, so Roxy hopes her tips
come in, well, "handy."
Roxy found a lot of different locations to
scope out parents, but there's none more conven
ient location than your own room. Your room
mates' parents will probably drop by for a visit, so

try to make sure your roommate is out of the
room at that time. (Maybe they're into weird
stuff, but even Roxy has her boundaries.)
Suggestively leave your thongs on the floor. Ask
your roommates' parents if they'd like to feel how
firm your mattress is. Then ask them if they'd like
to feel how firm something else is.
You will also find hordes of parents in the
dining halls. The food is always better on Parents'
Weekend, so you may already be close to orgasm
to begin with. Plus, the dining staff always serves
hot fudge on Parents' Weekend, and Roxy thinks
they're looking out for her needs. Sit down at a
table full of parents, suggestively eat your hot
dog, and you, too, can be full of parents before

the hour is over.
Don't forget classes, however

Loads of parents go to classes with

their children, and a lecture hall

is a good place to make a move.

Let's face it: parents arc no

more interested in hearing

about cell division than you

are, so use that as an oppor

tunity to replicate some

DNA of your own. Use a

reach for your pen" as an

opportunity to make a move. If

things go right, you don't even have to

worry about the other parents noticing — they're
I all asleep anyway.
Last but not least, try to use those structured
Parents' Weekend activities to your advantage. In
' particular, Stanford offers guided campus tours
for parents. Pretend to be a tour guide and lead
parents around campus. While at the Rodin
Sculpture Garden, try stroking the statues in
"new" places until a parent of your liking crum
i bles to his or her knees. Don't take them to the
; traditional tourist spots of the Stanford Libraries
; — it's all about the stacks. And the "Natural
i Wonders Tour" oozes with sexuality, so no one
t would be surprised if you display some of your
; own natural wonders. Parents may think they're
going to see the Cactus Garden, but they'll

be getting a tour of you instead.

I know what you're thinking:

Roxy, why didn't you tell me this a

week ago? How could you have

let me miss out on all that hot

lovin' from those balding, mid-

dle-aged Silicon Valley dads? At

least you're now prepared for

the 2010 festivities. So when the

next Parents' Weekend rolls

around, you can do some rolling

around of your own
