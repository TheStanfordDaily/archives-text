# Words spoken to the parents

### 
There are many reasons I have
always loved Spoken Word
— there is just something
magical about getting together and
reading good poetry. It reminds me
of home and the "Dead Poets
Society," which are both awesome.
For that reason, I was very excited to
attend the winter show of the
Stanford Spoken Word Collective
this past Saturday.
The show took place at the
Hillel House — a surprisingly fit
ting venue for the performance.
Spoken Word requires an audience,
but is a lot more intimate then many
other public shows. The lighting of
the Hillel House, the fact that the
location was large enough to house
a good sized audience — but small
enough that almost none of the
poets needed to use the microphone
— all enhanced the performance of
the material Spoken Word was
working with.
Spoken Word also did an out
standing job in choosing the order
of poets, especially since its headlin
er went in the middle instead of the
end. Chinaka, a Def lam poet, is a
tough act to follow, so Spoken Word
made a good choice in line-up by
placing Brian Yoo, whose tone is
very different, after her. The show
itself had mixed materials: some
poems were meant to raise social
consciousness in the classic style of
lyrical poetry while others focused

on the nature of writing or art.
Unsurprisingly, sexuality and gen
der were consistent themes, with
multiple poems focusing on the
relationship between gays in society
and the definition of femininity —
the most successful of which, titled
"Womanhood," managed to simul
taneously acknowledge the unique
struggles of women while celebrat
ing the discovery of a whole person
in which gender is a part but not the
sum of that identity.
There were many parents in the
audience, which made the dynamic
of the show rather interesting, espe
cially since much of the work
focused on parental relationships.
One poem entitled "Beautiful
Depression" was deeply personal
and changed the tone for the rest of

the night for me; I could no longer
find things to be as funny as they
were before that poem, even though
Lyla's work about Sarah Palin's
cleavage and unicorns was out
standing. However, Lyla's poem and
Max Hare's poem "Perfect Writing"
were the best possible closing and
opening acts, respectively, that
Spoken Word could have chosen;
those pieces set the tone and pro
vided the needed structure to the
show.
Spoken Word Collective's
shows at its best are a good forum to
talk about issues, but they can also
be painful to watch for that same
reason. 1 think that Stanford could
probably use more spaces to talk
about the themes that came up in
the show, such as gender, class, race,
mental challenges, what it means to
be an artist or intellectual and social
consciousness. For that reason I
applaud Spoken Word Collective's
work and highly encourage others
to attend their shows. It might make
you depressed for about an hour
afterward — but sometimes we
need to be reminded of the greater
issues in life.
