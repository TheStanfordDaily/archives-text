# FiLM REVIEW
## Send out an S.O.S... to get me out of this movie! 
### 
I'm warning you right now: if you love the
musical trio that is the Jonas Brothers,
then stop reading this review right now.
What I'm going to say will upset you into see
ing this movie for yourself. On the other
hand, if you have no feelings toward the three
some, or absolutely despise them, read on.
For those of you who are clueless of the
pre-teen sensation "High School Musical," let
me explain: the Jonas Brothers are composed
ot three curlv-haired (though one straightens
hisearnest, virginal pop stars. Kevin, the
oldest, is stuck playing the guitar in the back,
while Joe, the heartthrob middle son, is the
lead singer of the band. Nick, the baby-faced
youngest, is the sensitive one, playing both the
piano, guitar and drums — proving that he
may have some real talent.
The money-making machine Disney has
made these boys incredibly famous, and"The
Jonas Brothers 3-D Concert Experience" is
designed simply to prove just how many
young girls are absolutely obsessed with them.
The movie opens with Big Rob, their body
guard, waking them up obscenely early to go
over their schedule. This expository scene
introduces each personality— Joe, the clown
with charisma, won't stop playing with the
table and interrupting the business-like and
older Kevin, who has a calendar on his
Blackberry. Nick, the youngest, sits there
sleepily, contributing nothing to the conversa
tion.

The boys are then filmed stuck in rush
hour traffic, trying to get to Madison Square
Garden in time for their sold-out concert.
Their Escalade can't move — so naturally
they climb out of the sunroof and run toward
a helicopter atop a building ... with thou
sands of girls chasing and screaming after
them.
This is the extent of the plot for this par
ticular film; it is by no means a "movie."
Rather, the entire movie is simply footage of
their Madison Square Garden concert with
guest appearances by Disney sweetheart Demi
Lovato and Joe's then-girlfriend Taylor Swift.
"But wait," you say, "it's in 3-D! That should

equate for fun and cxciting viewing pleasure!"
With the Jonas Brother at least, this is totally
untrue.
The main camera is placed at the foot of
the stage amid screaming tween girls whose
cameras and cell phone lights mix with the
haze of glow stick haze. I'he 3-D aspect is cre
ated by glow stick lights, Joe's tambourine
(because he has zero other musical talent) and
sometimes the guitar picks Kevin throws into
the audience, which instead look like thev are
heading straight for your face. The 3-D aspect
was created simply to provide an excuse for
this "movie" to go to movie theatres, as
opposed to straight for the Disney Channel.

After a few songs at the concert, there is a silly
transition into another ridiculous scene show
ing that the Jonas Brothers are indeed incred
ibly famous. These parts are so pathetic at
times — you can't help hut feel sorry for the
brain-washed, sobbing twelve-year-old girl
who touched Kevin's hand while he was on
the way to the stage for Good Morning
America ... she waited in line for 72 hours for
that moment.
This being said, you may enjoy this movie
if you are a Jonas Brothers fan — though you
may want to re-evaluate exactly why you are a
fan in the first place. If you have never heard
of the Jonas Brothers or couldn't care less one
way or the other, stay away from this movie,
for you will get nothing out of it except per
haps the knowledge that these brothers are
potentially the most overrated musicians
since KISS. Despite the short length (the
movie is only seventy minutes), you will find
yourself checking your watch the entire time.
Leave the Jonas Brothers to the people who
love them the most: girls under the age of 13.
