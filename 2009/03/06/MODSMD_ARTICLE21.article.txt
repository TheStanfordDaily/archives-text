# Coho: Spanish poet Lorca displayed in visual form
## 
### 
Monday night found the CoHo buzzing with people
enjoying live jazz, pastries and the artwork of
Stanford undergraduate Jessica Cornwell. Her
exhibition entitled "The Illustrated Lorca Project" was on dis
play on the walls of the CoHo for the evening.
Cornwell's work was inspired by"Poema del Cante
Jondo," a collection of poetry by prominent Spanish author
Federico Garcia Lorca. Cornwell had received a grant to
spend time last summer in Spain, where she created these
pieces. As part of her project, Cornwell traveled to Andalusia,
the region where Lorca grew up, and spent a year at the
University of Salamanca in Spain.
Lorca's "Poema del Cante Jondo (Cante Jondo)" took the

tradition of gypsy songs and translated them into poetry.
Cornwell converts "Cante Jondo" into yet another form: visu
al art. The beauty of "Cante Jondo" lies in how it captures the
vitality of the gypsy culture as well as the themes of anguish
and love. Cornwell's personal interpretation of the poem is
successful in that it conveys these themes in a creative and
thought-provoking manner.
Cornwell's painting "Song of the Beaten Gypsy" depicts a
lifelike hand against a backdrop of greenish leaves, with water
(or tears?) running through the fingers. Observing the paint
ing, which is done in acrylic on canvas, one does not imme
diately think "Ah, inspired by Lorca!" However, the work sub
tly invokes the sense of pain against a natural backdrop in a
manner very reminiscent of "Cante londo."
"Riddle of the Guitar" is a painting done in watercolor. A
man's face is outlined in blue. His expression is pained, pen
sive. Although the painting is a relatively abstract vision of
Lorca's poem by the same name, it is possible that the man's
expression reflects his pondering of the riddle in the title.
The exhibition also includes two paintings entitled "Dos
Muchachas." Lorca's poem of the same title describes two
passionate women, Lola and Amparo. Cornwell's "Dos
Muchachas" is a work done in bold colors. The original poem
is filled with references to color — for example, Lola's "voice
of violet" or "the weak yellow trill of the canary." The paint
ings' vibrancy not only makes them pop from the off-white

walls of the CoHo, but, more importantly, reflects the vivacity
found in Lorca's poetry.
As an avid fan of Fcderico Garcia Lorca, I personally own
a copy of "Poema del Cante Jondo." The cover of my copy
depicts a giant pink flower against a dark background, which
I have always disliked. It is a joy to sec Cornwell's interpreta
tions of his work, which relate to the poems without using
overly literal illustrations. Cornwell's paintings are visually

intriguing and appeal
ing; in that way, they
are an excellent hom
age to Lorca's poems
— but they also defi
nitely stand out in
their own merit.
"The Illustrated
Lorca Project" exhibi
tion was established
with the support of the
Student Organizing
Committee for the
Arts.
