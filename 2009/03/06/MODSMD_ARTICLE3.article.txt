## TOP 10 MULTIPLAYER VIDEO-GAMES 
### 
. FIFA 200 X
A soccer game at the top of the list? Really?
Nobody even likes soccer! Whether or not the
real version of soccer is becoming America's
favorite pastime, virtual soccer definitely is. With
immense depth of customizability for the soccer
buffs, and simple control schemes for video
gaming neophytes, FIFA offers something for
everyone. Little is more fun, frustrating and
rewarding than a four-player soccer match in
golden-goal overtime.
2. Halo 2/3
The granddaddy of the XBox franchise, Halo has
evolved into every frat guy's default shooter
game. Many fans will argue that Halo 2 was the
pinnacle of the multiplayer experience, though
others enjoy the added game types, items and
improved graphics of Halo 3. Easy to pick up
and hard to master, Halo may be one the most
addicting videogames out there.
3. Rock Band/Guitar Hero
Never quite had the drive to learn real guitar
and go homeless in the hopes of becoming a
rock star? Well fear no more, for now you can
become a rock star in your very own living
room — with friends! The Guitar Hero/Rock
Band franchises have perfected a wonderful sys
tem that is both fun to participate in and watch
for lovers of all kinds of music.
4. Mario Kart Wii/64
A classic since the SNES days of our childhoods,
the Mario Kart series has become a staple of

competitive party gaming. A go-kart racing
game featuring famous characters from the
Mario franchise and ridiculous maps and items,
Mario Kart can provide endless fun whether in
race or battle mode, drunk or sober.
5. Super Smash Brothers Brawl
The third in the Super Smash Brothers series,
many will argue that Brawl is the best yet.
Featuring characters from all over the Nintendo
universe, SSBB lets you pick an avatar and then
beat the ever-loving crap out of everyone in
sight. Items and constantly changing maps add
to the fun, making SSBB a consistent fan
favorite.
6. Madden/NCAA Football 200 X
What better way for our inner nerd to live out
his or her own athletic dream than by merciless
ly hit-sticking their opposition on the muddy
gridiron? Whether in the professional or college
settings, the Madden/NCAA series provides a
dynamic and ever more nuanced football expe
rience. Though this game is not for the easily
frustrated, the learning curve has also evolved
into quite a formidable one. A beginner is best
off playing other beginners else risk seeing a 77-
0 landslide by the end of the first half.
7. Wii Sports
Although just a humble add-on that shipped
with every Wii system in America, Wii Sports
provides surprising depth and re-playability.
Though many of the games may not be ideal for
a party setting, few games are as fun as four-per

son tennis or bowling. Nothing is better to settle
a drunken bet than a best-of-three Wii tennis
match. Period.
8. Left 4 Dead
A new XBox 360 release that pits the player as
one of four survivors trying to escape the zom
bie apocalypse, this game is unique in the list in
that it's a game focused on cooperation and not
competition. Very tense and fast-paced, 1.41) will
require coordinated teamwork to survive. Not
for the faint-hearted.
9. Street Fighter IV
The next "true" follow-up to the international
mega-hit Street Fighter 11, SF4 has just launched
to rave appeals. A game with much greater
depth, SF4 builds on all the great points of the
original while eliminating many of the annoying
details. Look for it to slowly creep into dorm
rooms everywhere over the next few months.
10. Gears of War 2
A gritty and apocalyptic/futuristic shooter,
Gears of War 2 offers both competitive multi
player and an intensive co-op experience. One of
the best-reviewed games of the last year, GoW2
provides a visceral, gory and adrenaline-packed
experience whether playing with or against your
friends.
