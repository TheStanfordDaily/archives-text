# THEATRE REVIEW
## "You can't get pregnant the first time" didn't come naturally... 
### 
I'd first like to say that I'm usually a
fan of the Robber Barons — a
hilarious, talented and incredibly
sexy group of people. There is no
comedic group like them on campus,
but that being said, I'm a little easy .. .
to make laugh. But the Robber Barons'
latest show, "You Can't Get Pregnant
the First Time," just didn't do it for
me. Maybe it's just because I'm a
woman and, as you'll learn at the
show, "girls can't orgasm." Somehow 1
left the show feeling .. . unsatisfied.
Let's just say the Robber Barons came
a little too quickly for my taste.
Don't get me wrong: the Robber
Barons' performance was still quite
pleasurable and definitely a must-see
for your Friday night entertainment.
Opening last night at Campbell
Recital Hall, they had the crowd
rolling in the aisles. It was just that —
well, there were moments in which
they were still funny but in an "aww
honey, it's so cute that you're trying"
kind of way. Sometimes when you're
making comedic love, things fall apart;
this time, the show lacked a unifying
theme like the one that bound the skits

together in their last performance,
"The Robber Barons: IN HIGH-DEF!"
But so what if it isn't all mind-blow
ingly orgasmic? These kids are work
ing their craft, stretching their limbs
and learning and growing. They
should be admired for that fact alone.
One of my favorites in the show,
actor and director Olive Harewood
'09, says, "I'm really excited about this
quarter's material. Last quarter was
only our second show as a group, so I
think we were finding our voice, and
the response was fantastic. Now we're
expanding on that. I think we've
grown a lot as writers and performers,
and I'm immensely proud of the
group."
As she should be. And as am I.
The material of the show definitely
resonates with student life at Stanford.
The skit "Drunk One-Ups," which
plays on the competitive nature of
Stanford students and the ultimate
question that plagues us all ("Will I
party or will I study?") is subtly bril
liant. Also brilliant is the "Librarian"
skit, which strikes a personal note with
this writer. Who isn't irritated by the

invasion of personal privacy every
time the librarians at Green check
your bags and put their hands all up in
your business? The Robber Barons are
at their best when they tackle the
issues that can really make people
uncomfortable — such as ugly babies,
abortion and euthanasia — and turn
them into something hilarious. My
favorite skit by far, though, has to be
the "Napkin" skit with sophomores
Emily Goldwyn and Alex Connolly. So
funny. Man! I can't even ... yeahh.
So go out and see the Robber
Barons do their thing on Friday,
March 6 at 9 p.m. in Campbell Recital
Hall. The show is free for students
with a valid SUID, $5 for faculty and
staff and $10 for general admission. If
you're up in San Francisco, the Robber
Barons are also performing at 8 p.m.
on March 7 at The Purple Onion,
located at 140 Columbus (between
Jackson and Pacific).
