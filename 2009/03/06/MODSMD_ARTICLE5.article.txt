# "The Waste Land:" a Bharatanatyam dance
## 
### 
This weekend the Drama Department presents the
fourth of five productions in The Waste Land Project.
This production is a modern dance performance titled
"Hurry Up It's Time." As with other shows in the production,
"Hurry Up It's Time" is an original piece drawing inspiration
from T.S. Eliot's troubling poem on the decay of the modern
world, "The Wasteland." Co-directed by Stanford Dance
Division's lony Kramer and visiting choreographer Parijat
Desai '92, an fellow Institute for Diversity in the Arts fellow,
the show's choreography melds elements of Indian classical
dance with modern techniques.
"The Wasteland" teems with allusions to other literature and
quotations in some half-dozen languages, and nearly all of the
directors in The Waste Land Project have selected specific ref
erences to shape their works. "Hurry Up It's Time" focuses on
the final allusion in the text: "Datta, Dayadvam, Damyata," a
quotation from Hindu scripture the Upanishads which trans
lates to, "Give alms, be compassionate, and have self-disci
pline." Kramer says that in comparison with the poem as a
whole which is "an odyssey through the fractured modern
world," the Upanishads appear finally as "a prescription for

unity and peace." To help express this idea of finding hope in
chaos, much of the choreography for the show derives from
the Indian style of Bharatanatyam dance, a form that allows
dancers to express deep "spiritual devotion" through move
ment. Movements traditional to Bharatanatyam recur
throughout the piece and provide the jumping-off point for
modern choreography.
Accompanying the beautiful choreography is a spectacle on
par with other performances in The Waste Land Project, all of
which have been stunning. Haunting, original guitar music
changes to suit each scene, ranging from bluesy funk to dis
torted space-age noise, and clips from T.S. Eliot reading his
own poem interject periodically. Lights play into the equa
tion, too, resulting in a sensory experience that complements
each segment of the choreography: as a pair of dancers moves
together, the stage is dappled in soft circles of blue light as the
sound of raindrops plays; the tinkling of dancers' anklet bells
is accompanied by a maelstrom of swirling flashlight beams
as dancers run from an explosion.
Though much of the deeper-level meaning of "Hurry Up It's
Time" will be lost on audiences unfamiliar with Eliot, the
production manages to seem more accessible than previous

Waste Land shows, which featured dance but also included
actor-delivered dialog. Audiences accustomed to non-experi
mental theater often try to derive meaning principally from
dialog, making it frustrating when that dialog is fraught with
multiple levels of literary allusions and in competition with
all the other theatrical elements in place. Perhaps by remov
ing the burden of verbal storytelling from its performers,
"Hurry Up It's Time" allows the audience to create a story
and derive meaning using other pieces of the performance
the dancers' movements, Eliot's narration, the scattered news
papers and books that litter the stage. When asked to describe
the show, composer and guitarist Matt Spitz '08 calls it half
in-jest, a "vortex of expression." As it turns out, the epithet
may be an appropriate description for the whirlwind of sen
sations offered to the audience, which finally for The Waste
Land Project, appear to be working not as distractions to one
another, but in concert.
