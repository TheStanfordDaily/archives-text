# Milan fashion week zooms in on SEX
## 
### 
times of economic crisis, fashion
I designers return to what they know best
JL—the staples that made them famous.
' -"Christopher Bailey designed some classic yet
beautiful trench coats for Burberry
Psorsum, whose signature has always been
outerwear, and at Jil Sander, Raf Simons
came out with a breathtaking collection
with sweeping geometric silhouettes that
conveyed the brand's minimalist aesthetic to
the max. And what about the rest? As it hap
pens, what most of Milan knows best is sex.
This week, the most commercial fashion city
showed runway after runway of tall boots,
high heels, metallic colors, tiny skirts, tight
pants, and rocker girl dresses — all worn by

models aggressively strutting to sexy dance
songs.
Sex as a theme is not new at houses like
Gucci, Versace, and Roberto Cavalli. Cavalli
featured thigh-high boots, corset details,
and sheer fabric in his collection, which crit
ics thought was trying a bit too hard. Gucci
also received negative reviews — the overly
commercial formula of low-cut v-neck
tunics paired with painfully tight leggings
and pants got old quickly. Versace was better
received. It has always been the place to go
for pieces that are gorgeous but nbt exactly
fashion forward. Donatella Versace is also
reviving her defunct offshoot line, Versus, by
firing Christopher Kane to design a line of

crystal-studded stilettos, boots, and shiny
handbags.
Less famously sexy designers still made
use of the theme. Bottega Veneta designed
clothes that looked like they were cut from
bedroom materials, like an uneven silk t
shirt and nude-colored dresses with lingerie
details. At Emporio Armani, models donned
flirty knee socks and skirts with scandalous
ly high slits. Peter Dundas, debuting at
Pucci, turned to leather pants, asymmetrical
gowns, shiny fabrics, and suede boots to
make his mark. Blumarine showed looks
with leopard print jackets, sequined dresses,
and mesh overlays.
Of course, Prada always is the exception

to the rule. The collection was part cave
woman, part gladiator, part forest tanger
slash-wildlife explorer. But Prada's schtick
has always been the careful reclamation of
fashion ugliness. What seems hideous to us
now will be soon plastered over the pages of
Vogue, tested out gingerly by the more dar
ing socialites, and finally translated to the
high street.
The highlights of the week were Marni's
fantastic necklaces, Missoni's layered knits,
and Ter et Bantine's interesting plays with
volume.

Versace
I'll be honest: I miss the Gianni days at
Versace. I've never been a fan of Donatella.
When I visited the Versace boutique in
Milan last summer, I walked out almost
puking tacky glitter, silver and shiny.
However, the F/W 09-10 surprised me —
it's surprisingly sober luxe. Of course,
there's still plenty of over-sexed glam —
that's the Versace signature — but at least
this time around is a lot more appealing
and toned-down. Strong distinct details like
scars and scales on the dresses really stand
out but don't detract from the tastefulness
of the dresses. Sophisticated, elegant, rich
— I'm a fan.
PUCCI
Peter Dundas' debut collection for Pucci is
Versacexßalmain mix. It definitely breaks
from Pucci's usual colorful prints and fun
vibe that it had with Matthew Williamson
as creative director. Bring back PUcci I say
Dundas needs to either realize that he's not
designing for Ungaro anymore or just create
his own line.

Foot Fetish
If money's tight, it's smart to splurge on one statement accessory like a handbag or a shoe to
update old clothes, rather than"B«[ying a whole new wardrobe. This season in Milan, designers
showed modern, interesting, attention-grabbing footwear — all complete with a very skinny
high heel. Blumarine's sexy crystal-studded gladiator sandals, Prada's coral reef stilettos and the
variety of shapes at Marni all stuck in our heads.

GUCCI
A polarizing collection. Gucci has already targeted the dark, sexy, glamorous woman;
but this collection completely destroyed that image. Almost every piece is either too
shimmery, sequined, or patent — the 80's at its worst. Gucci used to be about a dark
unattainable chic and sensuality; now it's bordering on trashy. And eye-sore polka
dots? Really?

Dolce &
Gabbana
it
This, is Dolce & Gabbana,
Spring/Summer 09 Part 2. They
need to go back to what they do
best: trashy and tacky. When the
house tries to make a serious col
lection it looks sort of silly, espe
cially compared to the similarly
themed collections that other
houses have been showcasing.
The Marilyn Monroe prints are
interesting but seem lazy, and 1
hate — HATE — the huge pink
fur jackets. But I guess it doesn't
matter what I think — whether
Dolce & Gabbana sells or not, the
government will save them any
way. The U.S. bails out our auto
industry, the Italians bail out
their fashion houses . . .

Marni
Marni has gotten great reviews for their new line, which consists of giant jeweled accessories,
oversized mittens/gloves, beautifully printed dresses, flattering coats, and gorgeous textures.
Marni is usually shapeless, severe and artistic clothing, but this season took that
concept into a whole different level. Many in the fashion community have commented that it
looks very Prada from a few seasons ago, but to me this is a younger version. This Marni collec
tion proves that women can be sexy even with a lot of clothes one.

Prada
Prada is usually the queen of Milan Fashion Week: it's always the most innovative, the biggest
event with the most fanfare — not to mention they essentially determine future famous super
models. Last season, the theme was wrinkle and crinkle — and shoes so tall and paired with
satin socks so slippery that at least three models fell. This Prada season, however, focuses on an
out-door theme — full of tweed shorts, knit sweaters, tall rubber waders usually seen on fisher
men, hints of fur, and riding coats with side-splits — yet also warrior-glam, with appearances of
leather fringe/flapper dresses, red crystal studs and shoes inspired by Trojan helmet/headgear.
Too many collections this season has been about punk-rock glamour, and Prada is F/W 09-10 is
exactly the opposite. Even if it's not affordable, at least it remotelv looks it.

Model Profile: Jac
Monika Jagaciak, who prefers the nickname "Jac," is a remark
ably versatile, delicate-featured new model. She booked pretty
much every major name in Milan — amazing for a new girl '
— and surely is the sign of the next great star. She closed Marni,
Missoni and Pollini, and walked for Prada, Gucci, Fendi, Versace, Dolce
& Gabbana and more. In the past, she has stirred controversy by expos
ing most of her breasts in a beach photo shoot at the age of 14.
Nonetheless, she is a veritable chameleon, and her look can range from
commercial pretty to strikingly exotic to gothically editorial. Milan's
catwalks were disappointingly whitewashed, however, especially com
pared to New York's this season — few ethnic models were seen on the
runway. While Jac deserves the work she's been getting, and surely will
be beautifully featured in future campaigns, she also signifies the
Milanese casting directors' return to a safer look.
