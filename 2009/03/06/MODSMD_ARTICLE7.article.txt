# Comic nerds, sci-fi geeks, costume crazies: it must be WonderCon 2009
## Wondercon overview 
### 
San Francisco is generally very accepting of oddballs. Public
nudity is legal, and no one will give you a second glance on
the street if you dress somewhat out of the ordinary. This
past weekend, however, even the regularly unfazed San
Franciscan may have done a double take at seeing some of the
people gathered at the Moscone Center to attend the 23rd
annual Wonder Con.

People wearing costumes of all kinds, ranging
from simple kitty ears to elaborate getups, could be
spotted interspersed within the thousands of con
vention attendees who flocked to San Francisco for

the three-day event. In case you don't know, Wonder Con is a
comic book, science fiction and motion picture convention
that brings together fans to celebrate pop culture on a grand
scale.
Like most conventions, Wonder Con offers a wide variety
of events and opportunities about a specialized topic. The
exhibition floor was packed with vendors selling everything
from original art to Golden and Silver Age comics, plush toys
to costume accessories. Throughout the three days, the sched
ule also boasted a broad range of panels, aimed at both large
and small audiences, covering topics from comic storytelling
to R2D2 droid-building — probably the reason behind the
handful of real-size droids scattered about the floor that dav.

On Saturday, the events hosted at the Moscone Center
included spotlights on comic book artists and writers such as
lill Thompson, Alex Robinson, Mark Evanier and Sergio
Aragones. For those less familiar with specific artists,
Wonder Con also hosted general panels about comics, includ
ing one where several artists collaborated together to create
original art live in front of an audience.

While smaller events were usually held in smaller confer
ence rooms, larger high-profile events (usually centered
around upcoming motion-picture films) were held at the vast
Esplanade Ballroom. Keeping in line with the theme of the
convention, most of the movies featured throughout the week
end were related to comics, animation or science fiction.
For the highly anticipated panel about the upcoming film

"Watchmen," the line stretched out the doors and eager fans
filled every seat. "Watchmen" is based on the legendary 1987
graphic novel of the same title which tells the story of out
lawed freelance costumed vigilantes who discover a plot to
stave off nuclear war by killing millions of innocent people.
Since its publication, the graphic novel has gained renown and
a fierce cult following. Presently, there is great mystery and

excitement surrounding the film's upcoming release on March
6.
The "Watchmen" panel included director Zack Snyder
("300," "Dawn of the Dead"), several members of the cast and
original graphic novel artist Dave Cibbons. They joked about
the casting process, the uncomfortable costumes and produc
ers' incessant questions about a sequel (a project Snyder refus-

es to undertake). The cast, which includes both smaller
names and more famous stars such as Jackie Earle Haley
and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, discussed their experiences
adapting such a seminal work of comic literature into a

film.
Snyder also covered logistical details of the film, such a

the controversy about the film's decision to drop from the film
the "Tales of the Black Freighter," a pirate story embedded
within the original graphic novel. Although the production
company made an animated version of the "Black Freighter," it
won't be included with the theatrical release of the film —
which is already a staggering two hours and 40 minutes.
Instead, it will be added on to the DVD.
Next, the panel showed an exclusive clip from the upcom
ing film. Wonder Con, known for its motion picture exclusives,
treated the panel attendees to an early peek at the first eight
minutes of "Watchmen," which included a montage of pictures
to establish the alternate universe.
The first few scenes quickly established "Watchmen" as a
movie that was both true to the graphic novel and utterly
thrilling on its own — and the audience greeted the sneak
peak with uproarious applause.
The other movie panels of the day were equally grand in
scale — "Star Trek," a film to be released Mav X, is a re-imae-

ining of the saga's beginnings with
an all-new cast. Convention atten
dees flooded in expecting the panel
to consist of only the cast members,
but were instead presented with
the cast and the visionary director
}. J. Abrams — because oh, by the
way, Wonder Con is also known for
its surprise guests. Abrams showed
the audience a brand-new trailer
and opened up the panel for ques
tion and answer. The panel dis
cussed everything from the "daunt
ing" idea of pleasing such a dedicat
ed fan base to Leonard Nimoy's
involvement with the film produc
tion. Abrams assured audiences
that the film was made with Star
Trek fans in mind but also with the
goal of reintroducing the franchise
to a new generation. Other motion
picture panels on Saturday includ
ed Disney/Pixar's "Up," Warner
Brothers' "Terminator Salvation,"

Focus Features' "9" and "Alien
Trespass."
In addition to the panels and
events, convention attendees also
came for the unique atmosphere
and the exhibition floor, both of
which pulsated with science fiction
and comic fan energy. Spotted
walking around: several people
dressed as Poison Ivy, six different
Batmans, Jokers of all kinds,
Captain Han Solo and Chewbacca,
several appearances of Watchmen
characters (especially Rorschach)
and a good handful of V imperson
ators (from V for Vendetta).
Cartoons also made their appear
ance with a pack of Teen Titans, an
Optimus Prime and a wide variety
of anime characters.
'Hie exhibition floor also
housed hundreds of booths selling
all kinds of comics and parapher
nalia from Serenity action figures
to Japanese swords, as well as

the "Artists' Alley," where comic
artists held appearances and sign
ings. Additional famous faces in the
crowd up for autographs included
Carrie Fisher, Mark Hamill and
Adam West. A side room even
housed a small gaming competi
tion with tournaments for "Magic:
The Gathering" and 16 other game
titles.
Wonder Con, if nothing else, is
a chance for people to celebrate all
that is nerdy and wonderful. Where
else will you see someone in a
Princess Leia outfit waiting in line
to talk to an independent comic
artist? Within the doors of the
Moscone center, the wondrous and
fantastic become absolutely com
monplace — at least for one week
end.
