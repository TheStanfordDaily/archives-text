Q&A'
with Executive Producer Martin Start

Santa-Monica native actor Martin Starr
is a geek by trade. He played Bill
Haverchuck on the short-lived NBC
comedy-drama "Freaks and Geeks," and since
then has played a number of smaller roles in
comedy films "Knocked Up" and "Supcrbad."
Intermission snatched an exclusive interview
with Starr at Wondercon 2009 in San
Francisco.
Intermission (i): Thank you so much for
meeting with us. I'm very excited to get to
talk to you about your new movie
"Adventurcland," in theaters March 27. In the
film, you play a "pipe-smoking, Russian liter
ature loving, drolly philosophical game
booth worker." In what ways do you identify
with this character?
Martin Starr (MS): He's definitely well
thought out — very neurotic with very low
self-esteem, which is somewhat related to the
poverty stricken circumstances in which he
grew up. But it's so easy because lie feels sim
ilar to "Freaks and Geeks" and Bill — he's the
everyman. He's a good guy but you find your

self to be more awkward around him, espe
cially with his attitude, which is just a guy, sit
ting there, watching everything unfold, just
wanting to be a part of it and not having the
self-control to do it or the self-respect to just
go up and do the things that you want to do.
You're so scared of living almost, so it's easy. I
don't know. It's easy.
i: How much did you prepare for this role, or
how much of this were you playing yourself
or were you playing a character?
MS: I feel like you're always playing some part
of yourself in order to do it in the first place.
You read a script and you get a feel for a char
acter. I listen to a lot of' Bos music, but I love
that anyway, so it's not different from a nor
mal day, I guess. When I auditioned for Greg,
I thought it was horrible. I thought it was the
worst audition, and he liked it, so 1 said, okay,
I'm onto something. I ended up getting the
part, which I had two days to prepare for.
That was the foundation for what ended up
on film.
i: What in particular attracted you to this
script?

MS: Greg is an amazing storyteller. He has
such compassion in directing and writing that
all of his characters have here — even Frigo in
the movie, who's kind of a total douche bag.
The person that he cast, Matt Bush, who is

immensely talented, brought so much

heart to him because he's such a

genuinely nice guy; it's hard

to think that's the guy he

picked to be the asshole.

You kind of want

someone you're going

to hate initially, so

that the film all

makes sense, but 1

because he had such

heart, it made it work

so much better. There's

so much history and back

story between the two charac

ters that it works so much better if

he's a human being and not just a complete

asshole. I think that's an immense talent that i
Greg has: to write and cast and direct people
that brings out compassion — he's such a
compassionate director.

i: Your character is very similar to some of the other
roles that you've played that have made you famous.
Are you afraid of being typecast or have you ever tried
to actively seek out different roles?

MS: I definitely like trying new things, but I

feel like people told me that right after

I did "Freaks and Geeks" ten years

ago. I didn't really know what it

meant and I was so young. I

think I worried about it

then, but at this point, I'm

so fortunate to be able to

do this anyway. These arc

characters that I loved

playing, so I 'm not worried

about it. 1 definitely try to

avoid small details that are

identical. I don't want to say the

same line that 1 said in something

else because I don't like it

i: You mentioned what you envisioned in your future?
What does that entail?
MS: At this point, I've been writing a lot more and tak-

ing control of my own career. As an
actor, it's very easy to sit back and
wait and hope that things happen.
They either do or they don't and it's
not based on talent as is obvious
because there are a lot of immensely
famous people that I don't think are
talented. Well, I wouldn't say a lot;
there are a few. I think that's reason
able in that way.
i: We won't ask who they are.
MS: (Laughing) I'm not going to go
and list them all. They all must have
some good qualities or they wouldn't
have made it as far as they have —
and they're probably amazing busi
ness people. But I wanted to take con
trol of where my future is, and I
found out how much 1 enjoyed the
writing process, so I've been writing
with my writing partner Charlcne Yi
for the last two years. We'll have our
first project finished probably in a
couple of months, so that's exciting.
That's part of what keeps me going.

I've gone through droughts in my life and probably

just due to my own growth as a human being. I've had
years of horrible auditions and feeling so bad about
myself as a person and allowing this business to have
such an effect on me, but now I feel like I've taken a lot
more control over the last two years and it doesn't
phase me anymore if I have a bad audition, because I
know that I'm my own creator — or whatever that line
is. I'm in charge of my own destiny.
i: Do you consider yourself a geek in real life or do you
just play one on TV?
MS: (Laughing) I definitely am a gamer geek. I would
love to call myself a comic book geek but I don't know
enough about comic books to classify as one — but I
would love to say it. My favorite at the moment is
Straczynski. I read anything he's written. I have the
new Thor, which I haven't read yet — but he's crazy
talented. I probably am a bit of a geek. Proud to say it.
i: Thank you for giving us an exclusive interview.

years of horrible auditions and feeling so bad about
myself as a person and allowing this business to have
such an effect on me, but now I feel like I've taken a lot
more control over the last two years and it doesn't
phase me anymore if I have a bad audition, because I
know that I'm my own creator — or whatever that line
is. I'm in charge of my own destiny.
i: Do you consider yourself a geek in real life or do you
just play one on TV?
MS: (Laughing) I definitely am a gamer geek. I would
love to call myself a comic book geek but I don't know
enough about comic books to classify as one — but I
would love to say it. My favorite at the moment is
Straczynski. I read anything he's written. I have the
new Thor, which I haven't read yet — but he's crazy
talented. I probably am a bit of a geek. Proud to say it.
i: Thank you for giving us an exclusive interview.
