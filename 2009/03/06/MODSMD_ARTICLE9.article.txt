Q & A

The name "Adam West" has instant
associations with every genera
tion. For our parents, he is the
man who brought Batman into their liv
ing rooms in the 1960s popular television
series. To anyone who has seen "Family
Guy," he represents the hilarious, para
noid mayor. Your younger siblings will
recognize his voice as a character in "The
Fairly Oddparents." No matter which
generation you ask, "Adam West" means
something.
On a rainy Sunday afternoon at
Wondercon 2009 in San Francisco, Mr.
West promoted his new film
"Super Capers" and entertained members
of the press and many fans, whom he
charmed with his self-deprecating, down
to earth attitude. "Super Capers" is a spoof
on superhero films that will be released
March 20th.
Intermission (i): You're the original bat
man.
Adam West (AW): I'm the classic batman.
You've heard of the Dark Knight? I'm the
Bright Knight. It was forty years ago that
I started playing Batman and wearing
that cape. I still have my batman jammies!
i: Flow do you feel about today's Batman?
AW: Well I'm so jealous ... it's hard to
talk about it (laughs). It has become so
different from ours. Ours was comedy,
adventure for the whole family with some
social commentary and a bit of irony here
and there. But the new one is, you know,
considerably more grim, nihilistic, dark,
foreboding ... I like me better (laughs).
i: Since your debut as Batman, which por
trayal of the character has been vour

favorite?
AW: You know it's difficult for me to
answer because I really haven't seen the
movies. I was really upset about not get
ting the $20 million (laughs). But I think
I like the last one with Christian Bale, It's
humanized a little more, and the relation
ships are a little stronger. There is talk that
Christian Bale and I are going to do a
project... he will be playing my father
(laughs).

i: Did you have to learn any kind of mar
tial arts to do those fight scenes in
Batman?
AW: No. Let me tell you, that's kind of
amusing because I was kind of a jock in
school and I grew up on a

ranch, so I got to be fairly coordinated and
strong. I was able to handle those things
pretty well. But martial arts, no. I left that to
Burt Reynolds, who thought he was pretty
good at the stuff until he met Bruce Lee
(laughs).
i: Do you keep any memorabilia from your
movies?
AW: Would you like to buy some? (laughs)
I've got maybe three warehouses full of stuff
and someday it will all be sold on eßay.
i: In your new movie, "Super Capers," you
play a taxi driver. What kind of car are you
driving?
AW: Well, we turned the Batmobile into a
taxi with air conditioning.
i: I think your character on "Family Guy" is
one of the funniest parts of the show.
AW: Mayor We? Two of the letters slipped off
the name thing on my desk. All 1 can say is,
please vote for me. It's a very funny show, so
absurd, cutting edge. We make fun of anyone
and everyone; it is not politically correct.
Which I like, I think we're all too politically
correct now — we can have fun with each
other.
i: How did you decide to appear on "Family
Guy"?
AW: Like Madonna ... I am constantly rein
venting myself.
i: Tell us about your experience with
Stanford.
AW: Stanford? Um, I like to tell people that I


went to Stanford. I went to like five
universities, but I did go to
Stanford. I lasted six weeks. It was a
bit of a renegade. What happened
was, I was doing postgraduate work
at Stanford, and it was a year during
which there were few jobs. Then
there were auditions, and I got a
job! And I said, "Bye bye, Stanford."
(laughs)
i: Any advice for up and coming
superheroes?
AW: Don't sit on the toilet while
wearing your cape and flush it.
