# "Colored Girls" experience common to us all
## 
### 
I've heard that Ntozake Shange's play, "For
Colored Girls Who Have Considered
Suicide When the Rainbow is Enuf," was
an amazing piece of poetry, and after seeing
the play, I can't help but agree. Blackstage
Theatre Company's production of this power
ful piece of dramatic literature captured the
play's nuances and inspired both spiritual and
physical emotions within the audience.
Directed by A-lan Holt '11 and produced by
Gabby Randle '09 and Cassaundra Vergel '10,
"Colored Girls" played on March 9 and 10 to
packed houses and enthusiastic audiences.
In its history, Blackstage has consistently
brought relevant and thought-provoking the
atre to the Stanford stage. In a similar vein,
this production showcases the issues faced by
black women and universalizes them so that
women and cmpathetic men, of all races, can
understand and relate to the issues. First-time
director Holt articulated this sentiment beau
tifully in her note in the program: "This play
is for all of us who have considered giving up
but instead are moving, dancing, singing, cre
ating — doing anything but stopping."
Utilizing the professional talents of cho
reographer and Stanford Drama Lecturer
Aleta Hayes, student choreographers Tiffany
James '09 and Ama Thrasher '10 worked to
arrange lyrical movement and visual com

plexity to the stage. Under their direction, the
actors executed vibrant ensemble work that
carried forth the message of the play — that
one should move through one's sorrows. "We
gotta dance to keep from crying... we gotta
dance to keep from dying..." The connec
tion and energy of the ensemble hooked the
audience into the rhythm of the play, bringing
them to climactic moments of tension and
cathartic sighs of relief.
Individually, the actresses shincd too. Yaa
Gyasi '11, playing Lady in Brown, embodied
the dance-like sounds of the play with the
poetic lilt of her voice. The physical commit
ment and strength of Candace Jones '09, play
ing Lady in Orange, made the audience laugh
and applaud. Delivering her lines with a wist
ful and light-hearted air, Lady in Yellow
Faradia Pierre *12 maintained her character's
innocent yet alluring demeanor. Each girl's
story will break your heart, but something in
particular about senior Ariella Tai's delivery of
Lady in Blue's monologue, in which she waxed
poetic about entrapment and fear of the dan
ger of one's own beauty when living in a big
city, was especially moving. Lady in Purple
Sara Silbcrstein '12 also had some poignant
and moving moments; when expressing her
character's desire to be with someone who
didn't realize how great her love was, she said,

"I want to dance with you and 1 want to love
you."
The characteristic tying all the women in
the play is that they all loved too well, too eas
ily and too much. Lady in Green, played by
freshman Monzi Oni, gave a monologue that
captured this sentiment perfectly: "I want my
stuff back. This is mine and he don't know he
got it," she proclaims, alluding to the oblivi
ousness of a man who does not realize how
much she loves him. The play proves its abili
ty to transcend race and connect women of all
colors — these issues are every woman's, and
if being moved by the world is what makes
these women colored, then I don't know a sin
gle woman who isn't.
Senior Tiffany James, as Lady in Red, is in
particular an amazing story-teller; she seam
lessly flows from one character's point of view
to another with dynamic vocal and physical
presence.
Hats off to Blackstage, hands together for
the young women who brought the play to life
and hearts and hands together for every
woman who loves fiercely. If you missed the
play, read it. It is one that should not be over
looked.
