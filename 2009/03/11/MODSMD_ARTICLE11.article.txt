you re gonna make it...fucking
spring break!

Roxy has two regrets about dead week:
First, that she already used up her "raise
the dead" pun last week. Second, that she's
covered with finals — and Roxy never likes to be
covered. Ms. Sass fortunately sees a light at the
end of the tunnel. Just thinking about spring
break turns her on faster than Michael Jackson in
a McDonald's playpen.
That's right, readers: Finals are hard, but if
things go right, you will be as well. To make sure
of that, you need to find the right spring break
spot. While Hewlett 200 may generally get you
hot and heavy, it's probably not where you want
to spend those nine or so days of freedom. This is
where Roxy, well, comes in. She has some tips for
you, whether you want to be wet or hot, or best of
all, hot and wet.
A Cruise
Roxy like the idea of any vacation that has
her constantly rocking back and forth. A cruise
presents a vast array of seduction spots.
Gambling? Tell a fellow sailor that your slot
machine has great returns. In for a massage? Tell
your masseuse just where to put that hot stone.
Swimming? Ask a gentleman if he'd like a blow
fish in the pool. Don't forget Roxy's cruise motto:
Make like the Titanic and go down.
Best of all, a cruise is the only vacation on
which you can say that you, in the words of T-
Pain, "engaged in fornication with a finned part
human female."

Mexico
The Vice Provost for

Student Affairs recently
sent out an email warn
ing students not to

travel to Mexico over
break. But how are
you supposed to
have any fun with
out going down
south, Roxy asks?
The incidents of'
crime make it all the
more exciting. If
someone is pick pock

eting you, just say, "Oh, that
feels nice. Move your hand a lit
tle to the left." Perhaps you are

worried about a car-jacking, but Roxy

thinks that anything with the word
"jacking" in it can't be that bad. Ms. Sass
believes the State Department needs to calm
down with their warnings and lay off the "if
Hillary's not getting any, no one can" policy.
Disneyland
I know what you're thinking: Mickey Mouse
doesn't really turn you on. (Actually, if he does,
remind me not to be with you when you watch
Fantasia.) But Disneyland is fully of sexual possi
bility, and no, not in a Michael Jackson in a
playpen kind of way. Suggest that your lover

brandish his sword on Pirates of the
Caribbean, or just imagine that he

looks a lot more like Johnny
Depp and a lot less like the

Cracken. Men, if you're travel

ing with a new significant
other, hint that those ele
phants on the Dumbo ride
"remind you of something."
Or just make sex noises
when you scream on Space

Mountain to whet your lover's
appetite. Roxy, however, would

suggest you forego making a move
on It's a Small World — neither the

word "small" or miniature Dutch chil
dren are likely to get your libido moving.

The Old Chem Building
Let's say you can't afford that trip to Old
Europe. Never fear — the Old Chem Building is
a steady (actually, rather unsteady) backup. The
castles of old might be too far away for a week's
vacation, but if you have a creative mind, the Old
Chem building can provide you with a better
tower than you ever imagined. Scale the fence,
and pretend the cops are dragons. Bust down the
door and ravish your maiden on a wooden desk
with the word "ass" carved into it. (Mmm,
romantic.) You'll be heaving for sure, though that
might be just because of the asbestos.
