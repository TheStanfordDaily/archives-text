# Model Profile: Liya Kebede
## 
### 
Liya Kebede was one of the few eth
nic models in Paris this week. It's
not a surprise that the casting agents
made an exception for her —as
much a veteran as Poly, her
absolutely stunning features have
given her lasting power in a very
flighty industry. As of Monday, she
has opened Balenciaga and walked
for Viktor & Rolf, Lanvin, Stella
McCartney, and Givenchy, among
others. Unlike Natasha Poly, she
announced that she would only be
appearing in Paris this season. With
a reputation such as hers (and a
third US Vogue cover coming in
May), she could easily afford to skip
out on the lesser fashion weeks and
still expect to walk for the big names
in Paris.
