# Paris FW: really old or really new
## 
### 
The designers at Paris Fashion Week — the most
avant-garde and fashion forward week — can
be categorized into two sets this season: those
that offered more of the same old, same old, and those
that completely surprised us with collections seeming
ly out of the blue.
Not surprisingly, Balmain offered us more sequined
minidresses, buckled boots, and rock 'n roll attitude.
Trashy chic is awesome for a while, but Christophe
Decarnin needs to take his aesthetic one step further
and not offer last season's dresses in different colors.
Dior was theatrical as usual, with models wearing
dresses that featured Oriental designs on the front and
buttocks covered by sheer gauzy fabric on the back.
Stefano Pilati at Yves Saint Laurent did what YSL is
known for — masculine tuxedo suits fit for a woman's
body. The tailoring was exquisite, and the styles are
timeless, so we can't complain about not seeing any
thing new. The clothes at Dries Van Noten embodied
effortless style and careless shapes combined with fear
less color, but they seem a bit redundant after the phe
nomenal, fan-favorite collection last season. Isabel
Marant came out with yet another collection meant for
those seeking casual streetwear with a cool French girl
vibe. Sonia Rykiel's collection was as cheeky and rhine
stone-covered as always.
Other designers took a completely different direc
tion — and sometimes not for the better. Rumors of
Martin Margiela retiring and leaving his house to his

apprentices have been abuzz, and this season's collec
tion seems to hint at that possibility. It was gimmicky
rather than brilliant and revolutionary. Nicolas
Ghesquierre stepped Balenciaga away from the futuris
tic approach of the past season and instead focused on
tulip skirts, colorful draped dresses, and satin wrap
belts; it's definitely not the edgy Balenciaga we expect
ed. Hussein Chalayan was another big surprise: he
stunned everyone with his aerodynamic, sculpted,
wing tipped, art-inspired dresses — they seemed like
clothing from 3000 AD. He has a tendency to make his
creations with rubber, paper, LED light, and lasers
rather than with cloth. This season, he turned to the
sleek and sexy instead: we saw bustiers, mini-dresses,
and thigh-high leather boots. I loved it all — Chalayan
left a bit of the old him in the synthetic fabrics and
unusual colors. Still, it was an unusually wearable and
less conceptual collection coming from him. Does this
have something to do with news that he is teaming up
with denim label J Brand for a capsule collection?
Olivier Threyskens came out with an amazing (and
supposedly final) collection for Nina Ricci. His
unsellable Victorian gowns turned into sexy dresses
with volume and some super cool jumpsuits. What a

welcome (and potentially profitable) change!
