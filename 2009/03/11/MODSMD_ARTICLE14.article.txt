# Model Profile: Natasha Poly
## 
### 
Paris followed Milan in model
casting trends — safe, pretty, and
not very diverse. Model veteran
Natasha Poly has been everywhere
this season. Poly is known for her
super bad-ass walk and her run
way composure (her shoe slipped
out at the Victoria's Secret
Fashion Show once, and she con
tinued strutting down the runway
on tiptoe without a flinch). With
razor sharp cheekbones that keep
her from being too generic-look
ing and an ultra slim figure, Poly
can pretty much book any show
she wants. It leaves me wondering
if she's a bit overexposed: she
doesn't need to walk the runways
to book ad campaigns anymore
— she could take a lesson from
the supermodels that came before
her and take a break from the cat
walks.
