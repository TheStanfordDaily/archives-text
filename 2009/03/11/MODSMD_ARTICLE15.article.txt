# Trend: the broad shoulders are still in
## 
### 
I'm personally sick of the pro
nounced shoulders trend, but it's
still Ã¼biquitous on the runways.
Balmain, who spurred the rage last
fall, kept it going this season, along
with Margiela's interesting, trans
parent take on the trend. Balenciaga
dresses had particularly sharp
shoulders that pointed upwards and
looked out of place with the paint
splattered prints. The weirdest man
ifestation of the shoulder trend was
at Manish Arora, where one model
walked down with lion heads peek
ing out from each shoulder.
