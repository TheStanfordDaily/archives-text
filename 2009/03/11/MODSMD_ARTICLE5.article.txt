## e-How of ebay

Nobody loves a good deal better the folks over at Intermission. Thankfully, the World Wide Web
has made it very possible to find those Marc Jacobs jeans at a much, much lower price. Sure,
you can search for your special item on Google and hope for a sale in Nordstrom, but chances
are you will find a much better deal if you just use eßay. It's surprising how few students here on cam
pus utilize this incredible service, though it is one of the largest dot com corporations in the history of
the Internet. Why is it that Stanford students arc not all savvy deal hunters? Perhaps it's because they
aren't familiar with the ins and outs of eßay. Intermission guessed as much, so we're going to help you
save lots of money through this eßay tutorial. Just don't bid on the items we have our eyes on.

(2) Buy It now
If you know you want that Ron Weaslcy shirt and
it doesn't matter to you how much it costs, then the
"Buy It Now" button is your best friend. If an item is
available with "Buy It Now," it isn't really an auction;
it's just a sale. This means that as soon as you click
"Buy It Now," you have committed to purchasing the
item and it's yours — no competition with other bid
ders, no confusion, just a simple Pay Pal step away
from you and your beloved Ron. However, if you want
Ron for cheaper and are willing to fight for him, read
on.

(3) Actually bidding

Most items on eßay are up for auction, but there are certain rules
regarding online auctioning that you should know before you start. Do not
bid until, at the earliest, the last hour of the auction. If you find your item
and the auction has another three days to go, just click "Watch this item"
and you can monitor how the bidding is going. Toward the end of the auc
tion, determine just how much you are willing to pay for this item, and
write it down. That way, you don't let the heat of the competition make you
spend way more than you intended to. Believe me, it happens way too often.
Then prepare yourself to click to the death until you have either won the
item or your limit has been reached and outdone by iluvbritney22. Victory
is sweet, but only if you spent the amount you were comfortable with.

If, after reading this tutorial, you become an eßay addict but find
that half of your favorite auctions end during class, worry no more; just
download an eßay Sniper program. Set in your maximum bid and, if no
one bids a higher price, you will surely win the item — the Sniper pro
gram will immediately and automatically raise another bidder in the
seconds before the auction ends.
eßay is definitely not for the faint of heart, but if you are willing to
throw down for that obscure meteorite with the best of them, then
chances are you will find some great deals on eßay. If you follow the tips
above, you will become a much richer, stress-free bidder. Good luck!

(X) Harrow your search

eßay is home to literally millions of items. If you are desperate for that t
shirt with Ron Weasley's face on it, don't type "Harry Potter" in the search bar.
You will likely be way overwhelmed. Type in exactly what you are looking for,
and if your search still doesn't return any finds, check the box that says "Include
title and description." That will widen your pool.
Finding the right item is only the first step. Now, new questions arise: Do
I bid right away, even if there arc days left on my auction? What does 'Buy It
Now' entail? What if I am outbid? Calm down and read on.
