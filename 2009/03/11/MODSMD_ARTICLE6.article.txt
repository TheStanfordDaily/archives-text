# Harmonics: out to change what you know about a cappella
## 
### 
Last Saturday night, I entered Manzanita
Dining to find it completely trans
formed by the eerie glow of blue and
green lights and looming digital sound equip
ment. I found one thing to be certain — this
was not your ordinary university a cappella
concert. That night, Stanford Harmonics pre
sented "Shamßock," a show that delivered
vocal rock with the intensity and heart
pounding exhilaration that Harmonics is well
known for. Fresh off of the release of their new
album, "Escape Velocity," along with four
nominations for the 2009 Contemporary A
Cappella Recording Awards (CARA), the
Harmonics were more than ready to rock out.
The evening began with a performance
from Stanford Tiiko, who nearly blew the
audience members out of their seats with two
ear-splitting, earth-shaking pieces. Not to be
outdone, Stanford Harmonics took to the
stage and gave a performance worthy of their
concert slogan: "Everything you know about a
cappella is about to change." Their first song
began with sounds of white noise and radio
transmission that was produced by the singers
themselves. Equipped with individual micro

phones, the singers then launched into full
vocal harmonies complemented by beat-box
ing. Harmonics is known throughout the a
cappella community for their impressively
accurate emulation of musical instruments,
especially the pulsating bass and the vibrato of
the electric guitar. Harmonics also make no
short use of technical equipment; they
installed booming amps on either side of the
stage and a soundboard at the back of the
room.
In additional to the sound equipment,
there was also remarkable lighting (including
lasers!) in the background. Throughout the
concert, these effects greatly enhanced the
mood of the pieces, highlighting certain areas
of stage choreography and adding that extra
touch of drama that the audience went wild
for. Certain crowd pleasers included a cover of
Kevin Rudolf's "Let It Rock" and a mash-up of
Aerosmith's "Dream On" and Eminem's "Sing
for the Moment." At times, the atmosphere
became like that of a rock concert, with audi
ence members dancing and cheering loudly.
Kate McGrath TO brought down the house


with her powerful belt in Evanescence's "Whisper," while Erica Lozoya '10
wowed the audience with her soulful alto voice. Even with his voice
enhanced by the use of a synthesizer, the musicality and stage presence of
sophomore Davey Feder was unmistakable.
The group sound was blended extremely well, and it's easy to tell that
the members of the Stanford Harmonics make up a tight-knit group that
knows how to have fun together on stage. This was especially apparent dur
ing the gospel-influenced "A Change in My Life," when a handful of past
members, decked in St. Patrick's attire, climbed onstage, exchanged some
greetings and hugs and proceeded to back up soloist Robbie Ruelas '11 with
an alumni song.
The Harmonics wrapped up the night with "Sound of Silence," nomi
nated for Best Song and Arrangement by the CARA — and deservingly so.
Simon and Garfunkel's soft, acoustic piece was brilliantly transformed into
a rocking, show-stopping number that retained the haunting tones of the
original song. Although the show ended with a collective exhaling whisper,
the powerful force of "Shamßock" will certainly linger.
