# Film gives voice to those "Sin Nombre"
## 
### 
cc Sin Nombre," a film produced by Diego
Luna and Gael Garcia Bernal and
directed by Cary Fukunga, is the pow
erful story of a Honduran teenager, Sayra, as
she endures the arduous journey from
Honduras to the United States. The storyline
may be fictional, but the problems and situ
ations are glaringly real.
On Sunday night at Cubberley
Auditorium, Fukunaga spoke to an audience
of students and answered questions before a
screening of his film. Fukunaga said named
it "Sin Nombre" ("without a name" in
Spanish) as a memorial to the many undoc
umented immigrants who cross the border
and are voiceless and unrepresented in their
journey.
In preparation for the film, Fukunga
spent two months in Central America to
conduct first-hand research. He visited shel
ters, stayed in prison, rode freight trains and
communicated with Honduran gangs. He
interviewed people in the places he visited
and also met with local professors and state
police.
Fukunga used these experiences to write
and direct a film that would be palpably real.
He not only wanted to open peoples eyes to
a different world — he also wanted to share
the danger himself. He recounted during the
Q&A the gunshots from bandits on his train
ride. However, instead of leaving at the
moment of danger, Fukunaga kept going
because he felt that after such an event, he
couldn't "just leave them."
During the casting, Fukunga empha
sized that he wanted Central American
actors who could portray the characters as
closely as possible. The cast was a mix of
professional and amateur actors — some of
them actual gang members. He assured the
audience that there was nothing "made up"
in his movie.
At the Sundance Film Festival, "Sin
Nombre" won Best Cinematography, and
Fukunga won Best Director. However, the
film can be painful for some to watch. The
harsh world shown is indeed the reality of
many peoples' struggles; it stirs an array of
emotions within the audience, exposing sen
timents of love, fear, hatred and hope.
If the gripping story is not enough, the
images and juxtapositions in the film are
beautifully artistic. The gorgeous scenery of
Central America is contrasted with the harsh
life of its underprivileged sectors. The typi
cal, Central American music throughout the
film provides an upbeat and hopeful con
trast to the dire and impossible situations of

the film

The plot of "Sin Nombre" follows two
initially unrelated narrative paths. Willy
(Edgar Flores) recruits young Smiley
(Kristian Ferrer) into the "Mara
Salvatrucha," a tough gang in impoverished
Tapalucha, Mexico. Smiley is initiated by
being kicked and beaten by the other gang
members and then ordered to kill a rival in
order to prove his loyalty and strength.
Within the gang, Willy acts like a brother
towards Smiley, helping him arrange furtive
encounters with his girlfriend, Marta
Marlene (Diana Garcia).
The other narrative path is the story of
Sayra (Paulina Gaitan), a teenage girl from a
poor community in Honduras who joins her
previously absent father and uncle on a
hope-filled journey to New (ersey. Their
journey through Central America mostly
consists of riding freight trains with hun
dreds of other immigrants. The two stories
intersect when Lil* Mago forces Willy and
Smiley to help him rob innocent refugees of
their money; Willy and Sarya meet and both
of their lives are dramatically changed
through the encounter.
The film appropriately balances dra
matic plot with glaring realism. The most
terrifying moments still seem completely
natural. The film never feels fake or forced;
instead, it communicates truth as efficiently
as a documentary does. The gang is violent,
threatening and realistic — however, Willy
gives the audience a different insight into
gang life, showing his redemption, his ten
derness with Marta and his admirable char
acter with Sayra.
At its heart, "Sin Nombre" is an evoca
tive film about redemption, faith, romance
and gang warfare. It delightfully displays the
contrast between the brutal life in the ghet
tos and the stunning beauty of Central
American landscapes.
