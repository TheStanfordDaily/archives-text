# intermission Q&A?
## Intermission gets an attitude adjustment from John Cena 
### 
with wrestling champion John Cena

lohn Cena, it seems, is everywhere — except the Stanford
campus. Cena, the World Wrestling Entertainment
(WWE) Superstar and star of the upcoming film "12
inds" is one of the most recognizable faces in a wildly pop
ular entertainment company. His weekly showcase, WWE
Monday Night Raw, is seen in over 100 countries by millions
of fans each week, yet he is virtually unknown at a school
where books, for better or for worse, always seem to come
before body-slams. For the 12-year-old Midwest wrestling
fanatic in me, though, interviewing Cena was a dream — a
chance to ask someone from inside the pantheon of larger
than-life heroes 1 worshiped in junior high anything and
everything I'd always wanted to know about "the Business,"
where they don't call them pro wrestlers but instead use an
even more accurate moniker: Superstars.
Cena recently sat down with Intermission to discuss his new
film, life on the road and where he sees pro wrestling — and
himself— in the future.
Intermission (i): Well, first off, let's talk about your film. What
can fans of your last film [2007's "The Marine") get excited for
in "12 Rounds"?

John Cena (JC): They can get excited for a completely differ
ent movie. The Marine was great for what it was — it was cer
tainly in-your-face, superhero, this-guy-can-never-be-stopped
kind of action. 12 Rounds is an everyman's kind of action pic
ture. Now, there's certainly no denying the fact that I'm six feet,
250 pounds [side note: he's right, there absolutely isn't], but in
the same sense, I'm put into a very believable action scenario.
I, as a character, really doubt I can do all this stuff — you
see weakness for the first time in Danny Fisher. It's not
like in The Marine, where I knew I could never be M
stopped. In [12 Rounds], the circumstances seem so
insurmountable that I really don't even know if I

can do it.
i: How was training for the role with t
Police Department?
JC: It was awesome, man. Those guys
were great, and I got to follow them
around during Mardi Gras. I got to see
them work, and they've got a tough gig,
man — they've got a very busy city to

patrol and a city that never shuts down. It's tough work.
i: So, this being your second feature film and a wider release
than The Marine, do you ever sec yourself leaving wrestling
to focus solely on acting? Do you think it's possible to bal
ance the commitments?

JC: Totally possible. I think they work hand in hand. The
WWE Universe is so big — we have so many fans worldwide
— that 1 would be foolish to ignore that. I'm glad that I love

my job as a WWE Superstar, and I only think that it can
help any film that I come out with. I know a large amount
of the WWE fan base is going to go see 12 Rounds just to

see a WWE Superstar in the movie, but I also know that with
FOX on board and the great promotional team that they have
on things, a lot of moviegoers will come in just to see a great
movie. Maybe then afterward they'll say, "Maybe I'll check him
out on Monday Night Raw."
i: Talking more about the WWE — when I started watching, it
was in the late '90s, when the WWE was going from having just
its niche market to really becoming more of a global company.
Now that the WWE seems to be everywhere, where do you see
things going in the next 10 years?
JC: Well, hopefully I personally can hang around for as long as
they'll let me. I think as a company, global expansion has been
incredible. Even in the late '90s, when domestic business was
fantastic, the only overseas markets that existed were in lapan
and Europe. We, since then, have added every market except
Russia — we are literally everywhere. Not only just talking
about global expansion touring-wise, but global expansion
network-wise. We have number-one rated shows in [dozens
of] international markets, and on top of that, we're now start
ing to see pay-per-view revenue from these places as well, so
international expansion definitely seems to be the future of
this company.
i: I have also read you've been to Iraq to entertain the troops.
JC: Yeah, I've been to Iraq twice and Afghanistan once. As long
as there's military out there to be entertained, we're going to go
out there and entertain them. I've been out there a bunch and

met thousands of soldiers; we spend four or five
days with the soldiers and then set up a ring
, and perform, and we film a Christmas special
1 over there as well.

i: Most people don't realize how many nights
you guys are on the road. In reality, you're
doing 250 shows a year, not just the stuff
' that ends up on TV.

JC: Right, and it is 250 cities a year
too, not like a baseball team where

you play the same place three or
four times in a row. It is very tax
ing, but it certainly is worth it.
i: So what's the hardest part
about being on the road that
much?
JC: I guess just not being able to
lead a normal life. I talk to all my
close friends that are my age and
they're already settled down,
A having kids, doing the

tereotypical thing. I guess
there's always a portion
of you that wants that,
but I know this is a

unique scenario and I love what
I do, and that's why I stick
around.

i: Getting back to acting —
who is an actor you would
really want to work with?

JC: Kind of a strange
answer, actually, but
Robert Duvall. That guy is

hilarious in everything
he's in when he wants to
be, but also such an
accomplished, well
rounded actor.
i: How about a direc- J
tor? I

JC: Another unex
pected answer here,
I think — George
Lucas.
i: Really?

JC: Yeah, I've
been a huge Star

112 Wars fan my whole life; it's
just so different. I'd really
love to work with him.
i: What about action stars
you really admire?
I Af_ll a L . 1 •

I JC: Well, the obvious ones,
[ Schwarzenegger and Stallone.
Jason Statham has done some
pretty incredible stuff lately.
Matt Damon, too — people say
we look a lot alike — maybe I can
be in a movie where I play some
jacked-up version of him [laughs].

112 At this point, Mr. Cena has more or
less answered every question I pre
pared for the interview. What I antic-

ipated as being well over the amount
of material needed for the 15 minute
time slot has taken nine minutes and
39 seconds. For the rest of our time

■ together, I did the only thing I could
■ think of: I turned my Stanford brain off,
I turned my adolescent Midwestern brain
[ on and asked every single question my
7th grade self would have died to know

the answer to. Hopefully the seven to eight wrestling fans at
Stanford will be happy with what I got.
i: Besides your own finishing moves [the FU and more recent
ly the Attitude Adjustment], what's your favorite all-time fin
ishing move?

JC: Without question, the Stone Cold [Steve Austin] Stunner
That thing made arenas explode.
i: Dream tag team partner, any wrestler, alive or dead.
JC: Again, Stone Cold.
i: Your opinion: top three Royal Rumblers o all time?

JC: Stone Cold Steve Austin, "The Rock" Dwayne
Johnson and Hulk Hogan.
I

i: Your favorite all-time match?

JC: Oh, without a doubt, Wrestlemania 111, 1 logan ver
sus Andre the Giant (the iconic match in which Hogan
picked up and body slammed the 7 feet 4 inches, 500-
pound Giant).

i: What kind of specialty match would [youj most want to
wrestle in that you haven't yet?

IJC: Hell in a Cell,
absolutely (Hell in a >
Cell being a match 112 )
in which the ring is
surrounded by a 20-
to 30-foot fence,
and the winner is the
first to climb out and

i: I can't believe you've never been in
one of those.

JC: I've been in a ton of crazy matches but never
a Hell in a Cell. Hell in a Cell is kind of the gold
standard — the one that every wrestler wants to

do at some point in their career.
i: So, I know that when hockey players win the
Stanley Cup, each guy takes the Cu:> for a day
and brings it around with him anywhere he
wants — hunting, to bars, to restaurants. Have
you ever done that with your championship belt
[Cena famously re-designed the VAVE World
Heavyweight Championship belt as a "spinner"
belt, with more flashy jewelry and a spinning
faceplate similar to the platinum jewelry you'd
j see in rap videos|?
I JC: (laughs) No way, man. They don't let me

t take that thing anywhere but out to the ring. You'd be in a fight
in five seconds if you tried to take that thing into a bar or
something.
i: Last question — what would you see yourself doing after
you retire from the WWE?
JC: Well, when the sports entertainment thing is done and the
movie thing is done, I certainly wouldn't mind going back to
West Newbury [Cena's hometown] and being a high school
football coach.
I: I really don't know which team would be more terrified.
12 Rounds opens nationwide March 27, and John Cena will be
featured at Wrestlemania XXV on Sunday, April 5.

250 pounds [side note: he's right, there absolutely isn't], but in
the same sense, I'm put into a very believable action scenario.
I, as a character, really doubt I can do all this stuff — you
see weakness for the first time in Danny Fisher. It's not
like in The Marine, where I knew I could never be M
stopped. In [12 Rounds], the circumstances seem so
insurmountable that I really don't even know if I

can do it.
i: How was training for the role with t
Police Department?
JC: It was awesome, man. Those guys
were great, and I got to follow them
around during Mardi Gras. I got to see
them work, and they've got a tough gig,
man — they've got a very busy city to

patrol and a city that never shuts down. It's tough work.
i: So, this being your second feature film and a wider release
than The Marine, do you ever sec yourself leaving wrestling
to focus solely on acting? Do you think it's possible to bal
ance the commitments?

JC: Totally possible. I think they work hand in hand. The
WWE Universe is so big — we have so many fans worldwide
— that 1 would be foolish to ignore that. I'm glad that I love

my job as a WWE Superstar, and I only think that it can
help any film that I come out with. I know a large amount
of the WWE fan base is going to go see 12 Rounds just to

see a WWE Superstar in the movie, but I also know that with
FOX on board and the great promotional team that they have
on things, a lot of moviegoers will come in just to see a great
movie. Maybe then afterward they'll say, "Maybe I'll check him
out on Monday Night Raw."
i: Talking more about the WWE — when I started watching, it
was in the late '90s, when the WWE was going from having just
its niche market to really becoming more of a global company.
Now that the WWE seems to be everywhere, where do you see
things going in the next 10 years?
JC: Well, hopefully I personally can hang around for as long as
they'll let me. I think as a company, global expansion has been
incredible. Even in the late '90s, when domestic business was
fantastic, the only overseas markets that existed were in lapan
and Europe. We, since then, have added every market except
Russia — we are literally everywhere. Not only just talking
about global expansion touring-wise, but global expansion
network-wise. We have number-one rated shows in [dozens
of] international markets, and on top of that, we're now start
ing to see pay-per-view revenue from these places as well, so
international expansion definitely seems to be the future of
this company.
i: I have also read you've been to Iraq to entertain the troops.
JC: Yeah, I've been to Iraq twice and Afghanistan once. As long
as there's military out there to be entertained, we're going to go
out there and entertain them. I've been out there a bunch and

met thousands of soldiers; we spend four or five
days with the soldiers and then set up a ring
, and perform, and we film a Christmas special
1 over there as well.

i: Most people don't realize how many nights
you guys are on the road. In reality, you're
doing 250 shows a year, not just the stuff
' that ends up on TV.

JC: Right, and it is 250 cities a year
too, not like a baseball team where

you play the same place three or
four times in a row. It is very tax
ing, but it certainly is worth it.
i: So what's the hardest part
about being on the road that
much?
JC: I guess just not being able to
lead a normal life. I talk to all my
close friends that are my age and
they're already settled down,
A having kids, doing the

tereotypical thing. I guess
there's always a portion
of you that wants that,
but I know this is a

unique scenario and I love what
I do, and that's why I stick
around.

i: Getting back to acting —
who is an actor you would
really want to work with?

JC: Kind of a strange
answer, actually, but
Robert Duvall. That guy is

hilarious in everything
he's in when he wants to
be, but also such an
accomplished, well
rounded actor.
i: How about a direc- J
tor? I

JC: Another unex
pected answer here,
I think — George
Lucas.
i: Really?

JC: Yeah, I've
been a huge Star

112 Wars fan my whole life; it's
just so different. I'd really
love to work with him.
i: What about action stars
you really admire?
I Af_ll a L . 1 •

I JC: Well, the obvious ones,
[ Schwarzenegger and Stallone.
Jason Statham has done some
pretty incredible stuff lately.
Matt Damon, too — people say
we look a lot alike — maybe I can
be in a movie where I play some
jacked-up version of him [laughs].

112 At this point, Mr. Cena has more or
less answered every question I pre
pared for the interview. What I antic-

ipated as being well over the amount
of material needed for the 15 minute
time slot has taken nine minutes and
39 seconds. For the rest of our time

■ together, I did the only thing I could
■ think of: I turned my Stanford brain off,
I turned my adolescent Midwestern brain
[ on and asked every single question my
7th grade self would have died to know

the answer to. Hopefully the seven to eight wrestling fans at
Stanford will be happy with what I got.
i: Besides your own finishing moves [the FU and more recent
ly the Attitude Adjustment], what's your favorite all-time fin
ishing move?

JC: Without question, the Stone Cold [Steve Austin] Stunner
That thing made arenas explode.
i: Dream tag team partner, any wrestler, alive or dead.
JC: Again, Stone Cold.
i: Your opinion: top three Royal Rumblers o all time?

JC: Stone Cold Steve Austin, "The Rock" Dwayne
Johnson and Hulk Hogan.
I

i: Your favorite all-time match?

JC: Oh, without a doubt, Wrestlemania 111, 1 logan ver
sus Andre the Giant (the iconic match in which Hogan
picked up and body slammed the 7 feet 4 inches, 500-
pound Giant).

i: What kind of specialty match would [youj most want to
wrestle in that you haven't yet?

IJC: Hell in a Cell,
absolutely (Hell in a >
Cell being a match 112 )
in which the ring is
surrounded by a 20-
to 30-foot fence,
and the winner is the
first to climb out and

i: I can't believe you've never been in
one of those.

JC: I've been in a ton of crazy matches but never
a Hell in a Cell. Hell in a Cell is kind of the gold
standard — the one that every wrestler wants to

do at some point in their career.
i: So, I know that when hockey players win the
Stanley Cup, each guy takes the Cu:> for a day
and brings it around with him anywhere he
wants — hunting, to bars, to restaurants. Have
you ever done that with your championship belt
[Cena famously re-designed the VAVE World
Heavyweight Championship belt as a "spinner"
belt, with more flashy jewelry and a spinning
faceplate similar to the platinum jewelry you'd
j see in rap videos|?
I JC: (laughs) No way, man. They don't let me

t take that thing anywhere but out to the ring. You'd be in a fight
in five seconds if you tried to take that thing into a bar or
something.
i: Last question — what would you see yourself doing after
you retire from the WWE?
JC: Well, when the sports entertainment thing is done and the
movie thing is done, I certainly wouldn't mind going back to
West Newbury [Cena's hometown] and being a high school
football coach.
I: I really don't know which team would be more terrified.
12 Rounds opens nationwide March 27, and John Cena will be
featured at Wrestlemania XXV on Sunday, April 5.

with wrestling champion John Cena

lohn Cena, it seems, is everywhere — except the Stanford
campus. Cena, the World Wrestling Entertainment
(WWE) Superstar and star of the upcoming film "12
inds" is one of the most recognizable faces in a wildly pop
ular entertainment company. His weekly showcase, WWE
Monday Night Raw, is seen in over 100 countries by millions
of fans each week, yet he is virtually unknown at a school
where books, for better or for worse, always seem to come
before body-slams. For the 12-year-old Midwest wrestling
fanatic in me, though, interviewing Cena was a dream — a
chance to ask someone from inside the pantheon of larger
than-life heroes 1 worshiped in junior high anything and
everything I'd always wanted to know about "the Business,"
where they don't call them pro wrestlers but instead use an
even more accurate moniker: Superstars.
Cena recently sat down with Intermission to discuss his new
film, life on the road and where he sees pro wrestling — and
himself— in the future.
Intermission (i): Well, first off, let's talk about your film. What
can fans of your last film [2007's "The Marine") get excited for
in "12 Rounds"?

John Cena (JC): They can get excited for a completely differ
ent movie. The Marine was great for what it was — it was cer
tainly in-your-face, superhero, this-guy-can-never-be-stopped
kind of action. 12 Rounds is an everyman's kind of action pic
ture. Now, there's certainly no denying the fact that I'm six feet,
250 pounds [side note: he's right, there absolutely isn't], but in
the same sense, I'm put into a very believable action scenario.
