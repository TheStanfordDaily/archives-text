## "I Love You, Man:" I love you, indeed 
### 
The art of the buddy comedy has been perfected over the
past couple of years by the once-unknown, now a
brand himself ludd Apatow. "I Love You, Man" has
everything you would expect from an Apatow movie — the
raunchy humor, the odd yet effective combination of gross
out jokes and sentimentality, the slightly hom-oerotic — but
not quite romance — between male characters, and two of his
most frequent collaborators, Paul Rudd ("Role Models") and
Jason Segel ("Forgetting Sarah Marshall" and TV's "How I Met
Your Mother").

However, the one ingredient missing from the mix is
Apatow himself. "I Love You, Man" was written and directed
by John Hamburg ("Along Came Polly") and while it owes
much to the Apatow brand, it benefits from his absence by giv
ing the audience a new, refreshing, and almost-always original
take on issues that Apatow has tackled before.
In "1 Love You, Man", Peter Klaven (Rudd) becomes
engaged to Zooey ("The Office's" Rashida Jones), the woman
of his dreams. Everything goes smoothly with the engagement;
however, it suddenly becomes apparent to Zooey that Peter

has no male friends.
Peter has always been a
girlfriend's man, mov
ing from one romantic
relationship to the
next. This realization
launches Peter in a
quest for a best man

and, most importantly, for a real best friend. His attempts to
find a male friend lead him to some incredibly awkward
encounters, which include online dating with the elderly and an
uncomfortable kiss with one of his man-dates. Just as he is
about to give up, Feter meets Sydney Fife (Segel) at one of his
open houses and they immediately bond. Here, the film turns
into a romantic comedy — but the twist is that in this case Feter
and Zooey's relationship takes a backseat to Peter's entangle
ments with Sydney.
The slightly implausible premise of the film does a disserv
ice to this fantastically entertaining movie because it makes the
film seem derivative and stale. Nevertheless, the script's laugh
per-minute dialogue moves the story along naturally while find
ing the right balance between crude humor and vulnerability in
its characters. The writing is, in turn, hilarious and cringe-wor
thy. A scene during the engagement party in which Sydney asks
Zooey in a not-too-subtle manner to perform fellatio on her
soon-to-be husband captures this mix perfectly.
In addition, every character is utilized to maximum effect.
As a matter of fact, in several occasions the supporting players
end up stealing scenes from the movie's leads. Case in point: the
married couple played by Jamie Fressley and John Favreau serve
not only as comedic relief (Fressley's sailor-mouthed wife and
Favreau's typical man's man define the very line between love
