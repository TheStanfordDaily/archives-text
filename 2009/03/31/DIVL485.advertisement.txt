Queer Studies is an interdisciplinary approach to lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender,
and queer political movements, identities, theories, and cultures.
Queer Studies courses interrogate dominant conceptions of sexuality and gender identity and how
these concepts intersect with critical race theory, feminist theory, scientific and cultural debates, etc.
