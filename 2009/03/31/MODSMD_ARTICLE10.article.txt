While many of my friends spend end
less hours scouring Facebook for
men and women, I refrain entirely.
My lack of participation in this college ritual
does not stem from ;iny superciliousness. On
the contrary, I think Facebook is an excellent
medium for meeting the opposite, or the
same, sex.
The truth is that I am technologically inept.
I am utterly incompetent. I do not know how
Facebook works: I do not understand its social
conventions, its pseudo-hierarchies or its tag
ging ;ind dctagging.
I low can this be, you ask. I low can a mod
erately intelligent Stanford student not under
stand Facebook? After all, Stanford is the epi
center of technological innovation, the birth
place of Silicon Valley. You would think that
just being here for four years ;md breathing the
air would have allowed me to acquire a rudi
mentary understanding of social networking.
Hut alas. I am a lost cause. I have tried, and
tried, only to fail miserably.
Recently, in (act, I met an attractive young
girl who, if I say so myself, was quite enamored
with me after our first encounter. At the sug
gestion of a friend, I decided to do some due
diligence and look up her Facebook profile.
Unfortunately, I typed her name in my "status
bar" — I didn't even know what the thing was
instead of the search field. After repeated
ly hitting search and wondering why nothing
was happening, I concluded that Facebook
was broken and left it at that. Fater in the day,
a friend of mine called me to ask me about my
status. I panicked, suffered a bout of hysteria
and then logged on to Facebook. It took me
another 30 minutes to figure out how to delete
her name oil of my status. As you can imagine,
I have not met her since.
The point of all this, dear reader, is not to
engage in an exercise of egomania, insincere
as that may sound. See, while I may not under
stand the new-age world of Facebook, I do un
derstand the world of finance. So let me tell
you how a financier (read: investment banker)
would navigate the treacherous online waters
of Facebook profiles.
First, and foremost, know your target. Any
prospective investment should be thoroughly
researched.and you should start with a l()K or
lOQ.That means checking the Info page. See
what guidance or forward-looking statements
she has to give, what her past performance has
been like and what her favorite movies are.
You can never know your investment too well.
Second, look for value. As the greatest in

vestor ever. Warren Buffet,says."Price is what
you pay. Value is what you will get." In the
stock market, a good metric forjudging value
is price to earnings or P/F ratio. Similarly, you
want to measure a Facebook profile by its own
IVF ratio: photos to exposure.
Do not be fooled (or excited) by someone
who has a thousand pictures on display.
Analyze those pictures carefully. If all
you're getting to see is an up-close picture of
her face, be wary. She has an extremely high
P/l ratio,akin to a small technology company.
She might turn out to be the next Google or
Ebay, but then she might also end up on the
pink sheets.
On the other hand, if you find a profile that
contains a good number of photos with a di
verse range of exposures, you've found your
self something steady and bankable, some
thing that will do well in a boom and weather
a recession — a Wal-Mart.
You're never going to double your invest
ment overnight with a Wal-Mart, but at least
you know exactly what you're getting into. I Ex
cellent disclosure policies and solid corporate
governance means that there will be no sur
prises when you actually meet.
Once you've scoured through prospective
investments and found value,you need to start
thinking about execution. There are several
ways to go along one of your portfolio watch
list's members. It all comes down to risk ap
petite. If you are extremely bullish on a partic
ular profile, then send a Facebook message.
While this is the riskiest strategy — it might
forever alienate your target and label you a
stalker — the reward, should it work, is high
est. Those of you who are slightly more risk
averse might want to hedge your message by
throwing around a few pokes at other profiles.
If your message fails, at least you have some
pokes that might materialize.
With these strategies and slightly more
competence than I possess, you are well on
your way to becoming a 112 acebook superstar
just remember to keep your hands off the
mouse.
