# Crime and Punishment
## Emily Grubert Gentlemen, flatten your supply curves

I'm a senior,and I'm a math major. I took
!• con IA this fall, did my first problem set
without looking at the textbook while
sprawled out on my porch in the sun and re
joiced at how surprisingly intuitive it was.
Right?
Wrong. I got like a 4.5 out of 10 on that
problem set. Urn, tee hce.
I've been chuckling to myself about that
one for a few months and readily admit my
own arrogance. Hut something about why I
did so badly on that problem set has consis
tently nagged at the part of me majoring in
" Iree Hugging and Frolicking in the Sun for
Academic Advancement" (the spring alias of
•"Atmosphere/luiergy Engineering," updat
ed from winter's title of "Climate Change
Will Kill IJs All").
Enter, stage left, a motorcycle-jacketed
former student and current friend of mine
who encouraged me to read Natural Capital
ism. a 1999 effort bv Paul Hawken and

Amory and Hunter Lovins. The general
premise: Nature has a stock of capital that
humans have been drawing from over the
years, and for the first time, there are enough
of us doing enough things that the availabili
ty of natural capital is starting to be a limiting
factor for our activities.
Hie creepiest place imaginable to read
this book is on the San Joaquin Amtrak line
between L.A.and San Jose (which I was rid
ing to avoid traffic cops), mostly because it's
been 10 years since the book was written
about how we can fix the world in the next 10
years.
Let's just say that reading about what Cal
ifornia might look like by 2009 while in Cali
fornia in 2009 is a little disconcerting,even in
the sun.
While reading about sustainable water
management and how we could fix up Cali
fornia's Central Valley agriculture, I almost
fell out of my chair when I elanced out of the

window and saw a live illustration of Natural
Capitalism's bad-choice scenario. There was
the California Aqueduct, with the normally
underwater inflow pipes like fountains, a foot
above the surface. There were the irrigation
sprinklers that are probably the spawn of Po
seidon and Icarus, spraying water into the air.
where the sun can evaporate it before it gets
to the plants.
And. my children. I have looked drought
in the eye and lived: there were the fields of
nut trees with their patterns of two rows of
healthy, watered trees alternating with a row
of trees that cannot be watered. Green,
green, gray. Green, green, gray. Occasionally
giving way to a polka-dotted landscape of
stumps where whole fields were sacrificed so
that the water could be allocated elsewhere.
I lard not to think that water is starting to
be a limiting resource.
