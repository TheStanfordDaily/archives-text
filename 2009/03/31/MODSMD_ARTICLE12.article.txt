# Crime and Punishment
## Emily Grubert Gentlemen, flatten your supply curves 
### 
I'm a senior,and I'm a math major. I took
!• con IA this fall, did my first problem set
without looking at the textbook while
sprawled out on my porch in the sun and re
joiced at how surprisingly intuitive it was.
Right?
Wrong. I got like a 4.5 out of 10 on that
problem set. Urn, tee hce.
I've been chuckling to myself about that
one for a few months and readily admit my
own arrogance. Hut something about why I
did so badly on that problem set has consis
tently nagged at the part of me majoring in
" Iree Hugging and Frolicking in the Sun for
Academic Advancement" (the spring alias of
•"Atmosphere/luiergy Engineering," updat
ed from winter's title of "Climate Change
Will Kill IJs All").
Enter, stage left, a motorcycle-jacketed
former student and current friend of mine
who encouraged me to read Natural Capital
ism. a 1999 effort bv Paul Hawken and

Amory and Hunter Lovins. The general
premise: Nature has a stock of capital that
humans have been drawing from over the
years, and for the first time, there are enough
of us doing enough things that the availabili
ty of natural capital is starting to be a limiting
factor for our activities.
Hie creepiest place imaginable to read
this book is on the San Joaquin Amtrak line
between L.A.and San Jose (which I was rid
ing to avoid traffic cops), mostly because it's
been 10 years since the book was written
about how we can fix the world in the next 10
years.
Let's just say that reading about what Cal
ifornia might look like by 2009 while in Cali
fornia in 2009 is a little disconcerting,even in
the sun.
While reading about sustainable water
management and how we could fix up Cali
fornia's Central Valley agriculture, I almost
fell out of my chair when I elanced out of the

window and saw a live illustration of Natural
Capitalism's bad-choice scenario. There was
the California Aqueduct, with the normally
underwater inflow pipes like fountains, a foot
above the surface. There were the irrigation
sprinklers that are probably the spawn of Po
seidon and Icarus, spraying water into the air.
where the sun can evaporate it before it gets
to the plants.
And. my children. I have looked drought
in the eye and lived: there were the fields of
nut trees with their patterns of two rows of
healthy, watered trees alternating with a row
of trees that cannot be watered. Green,
green, gray. Green, green, gray. Occasionally
giving way to a polka-dotted landscape of
stumps where whole fields were sacrificed so
that the water could be allocated elsewhere.
I lard not to think that water is starting to
be a limiting resource.


I got to the part about renewable
energy generation right about the
time when I looked up into the sun
and found myself going over Alta
mont Pass, which hosts the densest
concentration of wind turbines in the
world. Which tells you how small
they are. It was like a tiny, adorable
museum of power that the itsy bitsy
spider and friends designed. The
farm is, for the most part, over 30
years old. And why was it built? Be
cause of a resource shortage in the
19705; and it's slowly being redevel
oped because of another one now.
But back to the Econ problem
set.
Natural Capitalism managed to
explain to me what felt wrong about

that marking, and it also under
scored one of the greatest challenges
that people face in trying to advance
programs aimed at preserving na
ture and its resources. Here's what 1
lost points on: instead of drawing a
straight diagonal line stretching to
infinity. 1 drew all my supply curves
with horizontal asymptotes, signal
ing that at some point, even infinite
ly high prices could not buy more of
something. Introductory economics
says: no credit, five times.
I'm not hitter about the grade, but
I am concerned that those of us who
never get to advanced economics are
taught that price alone determines
resource availability.
The world that relies on econom
ics to make choices says: It's not eco
nomically sound to preserve forests;
to water more efficiently: to redevel
op Altamont Pass with big. more ef
ficient turbines that actually work.
And it shows.

Economic analysis can be a valu
able tool. However, it's becoming in
creasingly clear that some of the ob
viously wrong but historically irrele
vant assumptions it makes — like
the idea that natural resources are
never a limiting factor to growth —
are starting to be relevantly incor
rect. Given that so many major deci
sions are made based on standard
economics, we have to at least ac
knowledge the weaknesses of our
theories that we know are there and
have not needed to address before.
As for me. I'm taking more Econ
this quarter, and I intend to keep
drawing flattening supply curves.
