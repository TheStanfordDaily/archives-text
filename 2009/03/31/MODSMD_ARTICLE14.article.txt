cussed his experiences in internation

everyone can do something," he

and compassion."

speaker, and I did learn something
from it,"he said. "It was nice to get
a direct perspective on these
things."

ple resources, such as water, to
strengthen his argument." he said.

boiled down to water, supplies and
supply and demand."
