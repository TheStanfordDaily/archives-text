Jason Dunford said. "We didn't have
some swims go our way, but there
were some really good swims where
we went beyond people's expecta
tions. C )verall. it was a very successful
meet. It was a three-horse race like
we knew it would be. but Auburn just
pulled some swims out from some
where."

2:47.97.
"Obviously, we wish it could have
been better, but we still did very
well." Kornfeld said. "Maybe we're a
little hit disappointed, but we can't
he too disappointed with our per
formance. As a senior, mayhe I'm
more disappointed since I'm gradu
ating and the younger guys still have
a chance to win."
When it was all over, Auhum heat
out Texas to win the meet with 486
points. The Longhorns led over the
first two days hut scored no points in

went, we're not disappointed at all."

ty proud of what we achieved, and
we're just happy with what a great
season we've had."
Regarding the role of suit tech
nology in the meet's all-around
speed. Dunford said the quick times
were a combination of advanced
technology and plain old hard work.
"I think there is the suit effect."

Dunford said. "And while the new
suits caused (times] to jump. I think
swimming is progressing, too."
. Regardless of the final outcome
at NCAAs, Stanford's captains re
flected on the unique make-up of the
team.
"The No. I thing this year is that
the team unity has just been remark
able," Dunford said. "It is in every
body's nature to support each other
— get the best out of each other in
every swim."
Kornfeld added that he was
happy every day to come to practice
and train with his teammates.
"That's what 1 love about this
team." Kornfeld said. "You don't
look back on the accomplishments
but. you do look back on the friend
ships."
As for getting back in the pool,
most of the team will take some time
off, but some of the Cardinal men
will be back in the pool soon.
"A number of us are preparing
for the World I Jniversity (iames and
the World Championships in the
summer "Dunford said,"so it is back
to work sooner rather than later."
