cased the power of the Pacific-10 Conference. ITiree
schools within Stanford's conference came home with
trophies, with the California Golden Bears snatching first
place and Arizona, the defending national champion, fin
ishing in third. Georgia joined the three teams from the

tremely pleased with her team's overall performance on
the biggest stage of women's collegiate swimming.
Led b\ 2(K)<S Beijing Olympian Julia Smit. Stanford
started the Championships off with a bang. Smit led the
charge on day one. breaking her own American. NCAA

and US. Open record in the 200-vard individual medley
by .32 seconds with a time of 1 minute. 52.79 seconds.The
event marked Smit's second NCAA Championship and
Stanford's first victory in the 2(H) IM since Olympian
Jenny Thompson in 1995.
"Julia had just a spectacular swim." Maurer said. "She
is definitely carrying the big burden, and to do it with an
American record is phenomenal."
Smit continued her impressive swimming, combining
her efforts with those of sophomore Kate Dwelley. junior
Elaine Breedenjind freshman Sam Woodward to come
away with a fourth-place finish in the 200 freestyle relay.
The group broke its own best time by .39 seconds as it
touched the wall in 1:27.62. Smit's leadoff leg stood out:
her split of 21.91 set the Stanford record in the 50
freestyle.
The Cardinal finished the day by almost breaking a
school record in the 4(X) medley relay, narrowly missing
the top mark bv .23 seconds.


The Stanford swimmers rode strong performances from sophomores Austin Staab and Alex Coville, among others, to bring another trophy back to the Farm
Divers Dwight Dumais and Brent Eichenseer both scored points to help push the Cardinal onto the medal stand, its ninth consecutive top-three NCAA finish.
Although it seemed as if Smit
could not perform any better,she con
tinued to amaze and electrify as she
rewrote the history books once again
on the second day of competition.
Smit became the first swimmer to
sweep the 2(H) IM and the 4(H) IM at
the NCAA Championships since
Olympic gold medalist Summer
Sanders in 1991 and 1992. Her time of
4:00.56 in the longer distance was an
American. U.S. Open and NCAA
record, breaking the previous mark
set by Dagny Knutson last December.
"For Julia to set another American
record under these circumstances is a
Herculean task.'' Maurer said. "It's a
tight field and a star-studded group;
just to win is a phenomenal achieve
ment in and of itself, but to do so while
setting an American record is a tribute
to her will."
Kate Dwelley followed Smit's lead
with a tremendous showing in the 2(H)
freestyle. The sophomore standout
broke the school record with an as
tounding time of 1:43.61. breaking the
previous standard set by Jenny
Thompson.
"Kate swam a great race, and
swam with all her heart." Maurer said.
"She also led off the K(H) free relay,
since the 2(H) is her baby,and she truly
did a great job in a phenomenally
tough field."
The third and final day of competi
tion belonged to another Stanford
Olympian, junior Elaine Breeden.
Breeden became a two-time
champion in the 2(H) fly. touching the
wall in a meet record time of 1:50.98.
"Rlaine had been amazing this
whole week." Maurer said. "She has

n't been feeling that well all week.and
to stay totally poised and swim near
to her best times — which arc
NCAA-record times — is a tribute to
her confidence and will. It is a great
story that will be told next year
how even [when] sick, you can be a
champion."
Stanford finished strong but was
unable to crack the top three, ending
the meet in fourth. Overall, the 2(H)9
NCAA Championships were a defi
nite success for the Cardinal: the team

finished with three NCAA Champi
ons, three American records, two
NCAA records. 10 Ail-Americans
and eight Stanford records.
"'lTiis team handles adversity with
a lot of class, and really takes to heart
the Stanford heritage." Maurer said.
"We want to continue to build upon
each year, and continue the excellent
tradition of Stanford swimming."
