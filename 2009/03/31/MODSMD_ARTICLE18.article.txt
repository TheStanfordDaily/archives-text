contests by double-digit margins. But
against a partisan crowd in Corvallis,
that run came to an end.
Nevertheless, Stanford head
coach Johnny Dawk ins was proud of
the effort his team displayed in his
first season at the helm of the Cardi
nal program.
"They were amazing." Dawkins
said following the loss. "They gave
everything they had. They changed
systems, changed styles, defense and
offense. Those kids have been re
markable, and I wanted to share that
with the younger guvs from the
standpoint that they have set an
amazing example about what Stan
ford is all about: the kind of effort,
ttje kind of enthusiasm, and to be
good at everything they do. We
shared those moments. They were
great.
"We cried together and we shared

an amazing moment, and that's what
it should be like." he continued."You
should end the season laughing, or
you should end the season crying."
Stanford hung with the Beavers
throughout the seesaw battle, which
had the lead change hands 10 times
through regulation and one overtime
period. Senior forward Lawrence
11 ill even hit a dramatic jumper with
just one second remaining in regula
tion to tie the game at 54 and send
the contest into overtime.
But in that extra period. Oregon

State rallied from an early five-point
deficit, scoring eight unanswered
points. ITie Beavers were keyed by
Roeland Schaftenaar. who started
the run with a three-pointer and
layup to tie the game at 61. Hill
couldn't summon last-second hero
ics for a second time, missing a last
second desperation shot to close out
the game.
Stanford was led offensively on
the game by senior guard Anthony
Goods, who scored 20 points on 7-15
shooting from the floor. Hill con

tributed a solid double-double scor
ing 14 points and pulling down 12
boards, while junior Landry Fields
scored 11 and grabbed eight re
bounds.
In the closely contested game, the
stat sheets for OSU and Stanford
wound up looking remarkably simi
lar. Only a slight edge in shooting per
centage for the game — 49.1 to 44.4
percent — separated the Beavers
from Stanford. That slim margin was
all Oregon State needed to advance
to the finals of the College Basketball

Invitational, taking on UTEP in a
best-of-three series for the tourna
ment title. Hie CBI finals began last
night as the Beavers won 75-69 in
Corvallis.
NOTES: The Cardinal men finished
the year with at least 20 wins for the
20th time in school history, greatly
buoyed by a 13-0 mark in non-confer
ence games ... Mitch Johnson's five
assists against the Beavers put his
final career total at 534.second on the
all-time Stanford leaderboard be
