coming from shortstop Ashley
Hansen. The freshman broke up
L.awrie's no-hitter, which lasted
eight full innings.

person to get ihat hit." Hansen said.
"The key was to tire her out and
make her throw a lot of pitches."

the game, aided by three Cardinal
errors and two walks from Penna.
But the Huskies left 11 runners on
base, including six in scoring posi
tion. The loss marked just the third

better job of trusting her stuff on
Saturday."

Koplitz said.
Stanford could muster just two
hits in the winning effort Sunday.
Maddy Coon guided a hit inside the
left field line, but was held to a sin
gle after a quick relay to second.

Nevertheless, koplitz pointed out
that Stanford showed signs of im
provement in the two-hit effort.
"We put a lot more halls in play
[on Sunday]." she said. "Just seeing
Lawrie a few times detinitely
helped us out."

Saturday and adding another eight
on Sunday. Lawrie dropped to 19-3
on the year, while Penna (21-2)
nabbed a school-record 45 career
