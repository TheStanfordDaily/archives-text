53 Stanford victory.
In the Berkeley Regional final at
Haas Pavilion. Appel scored a
career-high and school record 46
points — two more than Candice
Wiggins 'OS dropped in the NC'AAs
last year. Appel's total stands third
all-time in the tournament, and is
the most by any player this year.
The junior center tallied 27
points in the first half alone, single
handedly outscoring the entire
Cyclones team in the first 20 min
utes. She was efficient, as well as
prolific she knocked down 19 of
28 shots and, after struggling with
free throws earlier in the tourna
ment, made HO percent of her
attempts from the line. Appel also
pulled down 16 rebounds and
blocked three shots — both game
highs.

ing without getting back to the Final
Four," Appel said to ESPN.

plays went through Appel in the
paint, as no other Stanford player
had more than five attempts from
the field. Sophomore Jeanette
Pohlen tallied eight points and

GAME NOTBS: Monday night was the Jayne
Appel show. The junior center put an a clin
ic against lowa State University, scoring a
career-high 46 points, while pulling down
16 rebounds. Appel's 46-point onslaught
was almost enough to single-handedly
defeat the Cyclones — and it was more
than enough to set a school record for
points scored. The Cardinal faces a poten
tially much tougher challenge in its next
contest, as it could face undefeated LJConn
on Sunday. If ASU is able to pull off an
upset, Stanford will undoubtedly be pleased
— the Cardinal beat the Sun Devils in both
meetings this season.

Kayla Pedersen and redshirt junior
Rosalyn Gold-Onwude each dished
out eight assists.

Appel's 46 points are the most of any player in the women's tour
nament this year and ranks third all-time. Her 16 rebounds were
just two shy of matching ISU's team total.
Appel was able to find success
early because of a perceived weak
ness in the lowa State game plan.
Stanford coach Tara VanDerveer
pulled her star over before tip-off and
told her that the Cyclones did not in
tend to double-team her.
"I had to score," Appel said.
And score she did. By the time
lowa Stale realized its drastic mis
take, the damage had been done.
While Appel was knocking them
around on both sides of the floor, the
Cyclones struggled to find any consis
tency. Their lone stalwart was for
ward Amanda Nisliet. who is not usu
ally a main option on offense. The
senior led lowa State with 17 points.
Otherwise, production was hard to
come by: leading scorer Heather
E/ell was only 3-13 from the field, in
cluding 1-8 from beyond the arc, and
Alison Lacey — the hero of the Cy
clones' Sweet 16 win over Michigan
State — shot just 10 percent on the
night.
The game was never particularly
close. Appel netted four baskets in
quick succession to push a 9-5 lead to
a 17-9 Cardinal advantage. Stanford
never looked back, opening up a 38-
25 lead at halftime. Appel scored the
first five points of the second half,
widening Stanford's already substan
tial lead.
It was the second time this season
that the Cardinal downed the Cy
clones. Stanford decimated lowa
State back in November at the Waiki
ki Beach Classic.B3-45.
Prior to Monday's game, Appel
noted the determination with which
the Cardinal had played throughout
the latter part of their season.
"We developed our game a lot
more," she said."We got our team to
gether and decided we want to get the
Final Four."
After her record-breaking per
formance. Appel noted that it was im
portant for the Cardinal to assert it
self outside of the shadow of Wiggins,
the most prolific scorer in school his
tory. and establish itself as a team to
be reckoned with.
The women achieved just that:
their effortless performance in the
Elite Eight mirrored Stanford's ef
forts throughout the tournament thus
far. The Cardinal's run through the
Berkeley Regional didn't generate
much suspense,as the women beat all
challengers by at least 18 points.Their
stiffest competition — Ohio State in
the Sweet 16 — was able to hang

tight in the first halt, but faded as the
game reached its conclusion.
The final two games of the region
al were essentially played at home, as
a large Stanford contingent made the
short drive to Berkeley to take in
each contest. Freshman forward
NnekaOgwumike recognized the ad
vantage this gave the Cardinal, but
still felt that it was Stanford's superi
or play that put them over the top.
"It was almost like we were at
home," Ogwumike said. "Wherever
we play, we will plav as hard as we
want to. I feel no matter where you
play.it doesn't matter. It's all what you
leave on the court. Of course, there
were a lot of fans here. But really, it is
just our players and our coaches."
The Cardinal now heads to St.

Louis, where the women will try to
win what they came ever so close to
obtaining last season: a national title.
Stanford will face the winner of the
Arizona State/Connecticut Flite
Fight matchup.The (Cardinal downed
the Sun Devils twice this year and
beat the I luskies in the Final Four last
season, but U( onn has yet to lose this
season and is the favorite to win its
sixth championship.
Still, Stanford is as hot as any team
in the nation and has not lost since
mid-January. With Appel continually
asserting herself as one of the preem
inent posts in the country, the Cardi
nal remains a potent force.
