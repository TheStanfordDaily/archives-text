win for the Cardinal. Mooneyham is
the first freshman pitcher to throw a
10-strikeout game in Stanford histo

walks, while earning 10 strikeouts
over seven innings of work.
"I've been working on hitting the
target and getting more control and
consistency." Mooneyham said after
the game. "We never take an oppo
nent too lightly: we just do our job
out there and hope that we come out
with a win."
Offensively. Gerhart got things
started in the bottom of the third
with Stanford already sporting a 1-0
lead, he brought in sophomores
Colin Walsh and Schlander on a
triple to deep center field. Sopho

of the game in the eighth, followed
by Kiilsgaard's two-RBI base hit
that brought the score to 11-0 and
put the contest safely out of reach.
"Today's game was a big-picture
performance," Stanford coach Mark
Marquess said. "We have struggled
so much that it has been contagious
on the team for the good and the
bad. This has been the best we have
swung the bats all year."

you don't play well no matter what
in a league as tough as this," Mar

footing, so whether we are home or
away, we have to play a solid game."
