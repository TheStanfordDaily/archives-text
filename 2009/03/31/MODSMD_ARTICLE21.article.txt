### Jacob Johnson 
Ex-Stanford standout scores first
WPS goal
The Women's Professional Soccer
league played its inaugural game last
Sunday, as the Los Angeles Sol host
ed the Washington (D.C.) Freedom at
the Home Depot Center in Carson.
Calif.The Sol emerged victorious in a
hard-fought. 2-0 game. The first goal
came in the sixth minute, and it came
from a name familiar to Stanford
fans: Allison Falk.
A four-year starter for the Cardi
nal. Falk was selected 10th overall in
the WPS amateur draft on Jan. 16.
She was a standout defender for
Stanford, and left school after winter
quarter to join the I .A. franchise.

Falk said she has enjoyed the move to
Southern California â€” where her
younger sister is enrolled at UCLA
hut the Danville-native misses the
Farm.
"L.A. is great," she said, "but 1
miss Stanford."
Talk's goal on Sunday was the
first-ever goal in the new Women's
Professional Soccer (WPS) league.
The six-foot defender came up on of
fense during a corner kick and head
ed the ball past Washington goal
keeper and U.S. Olympian Briana
Scurry. Initially. Falk didn't know she
had scored.
"It was really exciting."she said."l
didn't realize it had gone in [at first]."
With the goal. Falk vaulted into

the national spotlight. Her goal was
featured on SportsCenter's "Top
Ten" plays on Sunday night.
"This whole thing is so surreal."
she said Monday. "I haven't actually
seen the SportsCenter clip, but peo
ple keep telling me i saw you on the
Top Plays!'"
But the fame hasn't gone to her
head. As her Stanford teammates
know. Falk is a team player. After
Sunday's win with her new team, she
directed attention away from her his
toric goal and onto the Sol's collec
tive accomplishment.
"It was awesome to have a win in
our home opener," Falk said.
