## Tiger's back, watch him roar But golf's future looks bleak without him 
### TIM DAHLBERG THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Tiger Woods has some work to
do before the Masters begins next
week. His caddie could use some
practice, too.
You would think they would
have it all worked out by now.
They've done it so many times it
should be routine.
But there they were in the
gloaming (I'll explain this word
later) in Florida, engaged in an
awkward dance of sorts on the
18th green as a bemused Arnold
Palmer looked on. The fist pump
was fine, but when it came time to
hug and give each other high fives,
neither player nor caddie seemed
quite sure which should come
first.
Arnie couldn't help because, in
his day. celebrating a win meant
tipping your hat to the crowd and
shaking your playing partner's
hand. Players didn't give high
fives, and hugging your caddie
would do nothing but get a lot of
tongues wagging at the next tour
stop.
I bring this up because Augus
ta National is a place Woods has
done quite a bit of celebrating,
and not all of it well. Case in point
was the curling chip on the 16th
green in 2005 when he and Stevie
Williams ran around looking like
a couple of computer nerds who
had just scored their first dates.
I also bring it up because right
now there's not a lot more Woods
needs to work on other than his
dance moves and his victory
speech at the Masters.
His left knee seems as good as

new. and he's hitting the ball per
haps better than he ever has. He
can still make more putts when it
really matters than anyone who
ever played the game,and his Sun
day glare remains the most intim
idating look in sports since
Michael Jordan was sticking his
tongue out (a move Woods imitat
ed on Sunday, by the way).
And, yes, as you may have no
ticed at Bay Hill, he hasn't lost his
flair for the dramatic.
Nothing, of course, was going
to match his last win, when he
hobbled his way to an overtime
victory over Rocco Mediate to
win the U.S. Open atTorrey Pines.
But if Woods needed to make a
statement that he was back, com
ing from five shots behind and
sinking a birdie putt as flashes
went off everywhere in the near
darkness wasn't a bad way to do it.
Once again, the country was
riveted. Once again. Woods deliv
ered in a way that only he can.
NBC got a break when rain
earlier in the day forced the con
clusion into prime time, but it was
Woods and Woods alone who
drew a bigger television audience
than watched either of the last
two majors played without him.
Sean O'Hair is a nice enough guy,
but he was merely a role player in
this drama, and his role was to be
just good enough to make Woods
seem even better.
Mission accomplished, and
now Woods heads to Augusta
fresh off his 66th PGA Tour win
and in search of his fifth green
jacket. At the age of 33 he's now
within a handful of major wins of
passing Jack Nicklaus and there
aren't many who have watched
him play who don't already con
sider him the greatest golfer ever.
Count me among them, and
I've been along for the ride since 1
walked the fairways with Woods
in his first pro win in Las Vegas in
1996. I've had a front row ticket to

13 of his 14 major championship
wins, and I've seen him hit shots
and do things that just didn't seem
possible.
More importantly, he brings a
presence and star power to a sport
that has sorely lacked both ever
since Nicklaus and Palmer faded
into the background. Woods tran
scends the sport, bringing eyeballs
to television screens and fans to
tournaments who don't know the
difference between a bunker shot
and a putt.
That's great for golf, which
muddled along in Woods' absence
only to be invigorated again by his
return. But it's not so great for the
Sean O'Hairs of the world, who
rise up to challenge Woods only to
get knocked down time and time
again.
And it certainly doesn't bode
well for the future of the sport be
cause there will be a time when
Woods is no longer playing and a
lot of people will be no longer
watching. We got a taste of it dur
ing his forced hiatus from the
game and it wasn't pretty, though
Padraig Harrington tried his best
to make it interesting.
Golf was a niche sport before
Woods arrived on the scene, and it
will become one once again when
he leaves. He gives people a rea
son to care, something the mostly
robotic group of players who
make up the PGA Tour can't even
come close to doing.
Which, as I promised, brings us
back to gloaming. It's a word golf
writers tend to use when they're
searching for something dramatic
to describe the time of day when
light is fading and darkness is
about to envelop everything.
You know, precisely the time
Tiger Woods decides to call it
quits.
