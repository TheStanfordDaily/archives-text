## Number of ASSU candidates drops Record 60 candidates falls to 39 participating in election 
### FATIMA WAGDY CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
At (he end of last quarter, a record 60 stu
dents declared their intent to run for the
Undergraduate Senate, and five slates
announced that they would run for Executive.

Mut after the petition deadline, just 39 Senate
candidates and three Executive slates made
the ballot.
The 21 Senate candidates no longer run
ning dropped out on their own. either because
they didn't have enough signatures, or they no
longer had interest for personal reasons,
according to Flections Commissioner Briana
latum 11.
"Last year there were about 30 to 35 seri
ous candidates, which is not much different
from this year," said current Senator Zach

Johnson '10, who is running again. "It would
seem that the drop could he attributed to neg
ative perceptions of the ASSU. but this year,
in my opinion, the ASSII has done far more
than it has in previous years."
Johnson also cited a realization of the
Senate's responsibilities as a reason for drop
ping out.
"I think the reason a lot them dropped is
because they didn't fully understand what the
Seriate role entailed," he said.
"Talking to this year's senators could
have deterred some people from
running because there were certain
aspects of Senate as a whole that
could have been perceived as block
ing actual action. Initially, the coali
tions divide kind of slowed down the
process and was something we had
to work through."
Vang Xiong *12 said he did obtain
the mandated number of petition
signatures (100), but eventually
decided not to run.
"After speaking with many com
munity leaders. 1 came to the conclu
sion that the Senate is a significant
political body, but there are plenty of
other effective vehicles of change
which 1 can be a part of." Xiong said.
Xiong also failed to get endorsed
by the Students of Color Coalition,
which he felt was a blow to his cam
paign.
"I'm a leader with long-termed
investment in communities of color,
and not being in the Senate isn't
going to decrease my involvement."
he added.
Compared with last year's field of
six slates, this year will feature a
much smaller group of Executive
candidates.
Of the five slates who intended to
run for Executive, two did not make
the ballot —The Green Party
(Blake Miller "11 and Nicholas
Murray '11) and I"he Grand Math
and Science Coalition (Benjamin
Hersh "10 and Richard Furtell).
