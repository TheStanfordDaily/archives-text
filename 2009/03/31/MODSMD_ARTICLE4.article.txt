# SLAC GIVEN $68 MILLION
## Research facility awarded large portion of Department of Energy stimulus funding 
### SALONE KAPUR 
The U.S. Department of Energy
(DOE) announced last week that SLAC
will receive $68.3 million in funding
from President Obama's American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act. ITiese
stimulus funds are part of $1.2 billion
total allocated to the DOE's Office of
Science by the Recovery Act.
"SLAC, in partnership with Stanford
and our local communities and Bay
Area workforce, is privileged to have the
opportunity to contribute to the goals of
the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act (ARRA)," said Keith
Hodgson, director for Photon Science at
SLAC. "The funding that is coming to
SLAC will accelerate the development
of new scientific capabilities and provide
much-need upgrades to infrastructure
that will help insure more reliable, safe
and cost-effective operations."
In a press release. Secretary of
Energy Steven Chu explained the
importance of investing in long-term sci
ence institutions and projects like
SLAC.
"These projects not only provide crit
ically needed short-term economic relief
but also represent a strategic investment
in our nation's future," he said. "They
will create thousands of jobs and
breathe new life into many local
economies, while helping to accelerate
new technology development, renew our
scientific and engineering workforce,
and modernize our nation's scientific
infrastructure."
Operated in partnership with the
University, SLAC develops and operates
major accelerator-based scientific user
facilities and carries out research in
many areas related to particle physics,
energy and physical chemistry.
The funding is particularly helpful to
SLAC as federal funding for basic sci
ence and R&D over the past few years
(including that for SLAC) has been very
constrained. In fact. SLAC underwent a
significant numbers of layoffs last year.
However, Hodgson said that the Obama
administration's emphasis on scientific
development seems to underscore the
importance of basic science and innova
tion in underpinning future technologies

needed to deliver breakthroughs in
many areas of the energy arena.
"[The core capabilities at SLAC] are
important to the Department of Energy,
and the Nation, in enabling scientific dis
coveries that advance our understanding
and provide platforms for the next gen
eration of technologies which will pro
vide for our future security and prosper
ity." he said. "Enhancing and sustaining
them is a sound investment strategy."
SLAC plans to use the ARRA fund
ing to accelerate building of new instru
ments for a premier research tool, the
Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS),
which will generate the world's brightest
X-rays, enabling scientists to take stop
motion pictures of moving atoms and

SLAC will be awarded $68 million of
President Obama's federal recovery funds
for new research projects and seismic
retrofitting. SLAC is the site of physics and
energy research.
