## Students break safely in Mexico Students relax south of the border, despite travel advisory 
### JULIA BROWNELL DESK EDITOR 
Despite a travel advisory put into effect
by the U.S. State Department in February,
several Stanford students traveled to
Mexico over spring break without experi
encing any problems.
The advisory, put into effect Feb. 20. was
a response to the increased violence relating
to drug cartels near the U.S. border. The
areas most cautioned against visiting were
Tijuana, Chihuahua City and Ciudad Juarez,
where violence had occasionally trapped
U.S. travelers in the city, and shootouts have
occurred in public places in daylight hours.
Students, however, were mostly headed
to tourist areas further south, like
Cancun. Cabo San Lucas and
Acapulco. and did not let the adviso
ry hinder their plans.
"Yes. I considered canceling," said
Sarah Loomis 12. who traveled to
Acapulco over spring break, "but
then I went online, checked the trav
el advisory, and checked the areas
that were under threat."
After seeing that her area was not
under threat, Loomis decided to go
because the lodging was safe, and she
could stay out of the town and still
have fun.
"We were in a really safe hotel...
We never really went far into the
town, we just stayed on Main Street."
she said. "When we went out at night,
it was just about 200 yards away from
the hotel in one of the touristy hang
outs across the street."
Others didn't cancel because of
money issues regarding their reser

vations.
"No," Diana Liu '09 said when
asked whether she thought of can
celling her plans. "But only because
everything was non-refundable."
Though many initially had reser
vations about going, students gener
ally felt more comfortable once they
arrived.
"Going into it, we were definitely
a little worried, but once we got on
shore we loosened up a little," Liu
said. "It was nothing like the media
had portrayed it. It was pretty safe."
Most did not run into increased
security either in the airports or in
the hotels. Liu said, however, that she
did see strict security at the ports she
stopped at on her cruise along the
west coast of Mexico.
"I did see some people at the
ports with machine guns." she said,
"but I don't know if that was differ
ent."
In addition, it is speculated that
the police may have ties to the cartels
and may not be safe either.
"The Mexican police are one of
the scariest parts of being in
Mexico," Deßon Brown '09 added.

Brown spent the break in Cancun
on Senior Trip, a spring break vaca
tion for approximately 70 seniors,
organized independently of the
University through the senior class
presidents.
Brown felt safer traveling on sen
ior trip because they had organized
activities with people who knew the
area.
"It seemed a little bit safer that

way because we were with people
who knew where to go," he said. "It
was a lot more controlled. People in
Cancun still spoke English and
[took) U.S. dollars."
ITiough few decided to cancel
their trips, most travelers took extra
precautions.
"People definitely didn't want to
go off on their own." Brown said.
"Just generally, people were being
more responsible."
"We definitely tried to stay
together when we were on shore,"
Liu said. "We tried not to wander too
far from the port."
In fact, much of the worry came
from students' parents, especially
those of female travelers.
"[Cancelling] definitely would
have made my parents feel better,"
Liu said.
"Their parents made them a little
scared," said Deßon of some of his
fellow female travelers. Brown also
noted a gender imbalance at the
tourist locations, saying "There were
a lot more guys than girls."
However, everything appeared
quite normal about the spring break
vacation scene.
"It was still pretty crowded,"
Loomis said. "Il still felt like people
were there for spring break."
l"he travel advisory is in effect
until October and warns that vio
lence is spreading freely. Though
many students went through with
their plans for this spring break,
some are wary about making further
plans.
"I think 1 would [go back]." Liu
said, "but I would definitely still be a
little bit cautious about where I
would plan to go."
