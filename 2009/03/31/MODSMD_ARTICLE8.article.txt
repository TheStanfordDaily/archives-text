(SEE) in 2006. Neiman and his business
team offer free SAT preparation classes

In the summer of 2008, SEE part

Girls Club of East Palo Alto and
Upward Bound to serve 250 students in
Los Angeles. Santa Clara and Orange
County. According to Neiman. "99 per
cent of students improve their scores
and % percent of students go on to
four-year colleges immediately after
high school graduation."
ITie Daily caught up with Neiman.
who has already raised approximately
$24,000 for his initiative, to hear about
his passion for education and his plans
to expand SEE's operations.
The Stanford Daily (SD): Following
your other fundraising endeavors, how
did vou get the idea to start these edu

cational opportunities?
Garrett Neiman (GN): After co-found
ing an SAT preparation company in my
freshman year, I was still unhappy with
the idea that some students could
afford our services, while others could
not. The idea initially came about in an
effort to meet the needs of individual
students from low-income families who
wouldn't be able to afford any sort of
preparation with our help. We realized
that if we wanted to make a real differ
ence. we would need a more systematic
solution. Stanford's Social
Entrepreneurship Collaboratory, a
course offered through the urban stud
ies department, really helped us trans
form those ideas into reality.
SI): Where do you think your passion
for education comes from?
CiN: 1 come from a family of educators,
and I have always enjoyed learning. Just
as importantly. I have come to see edu
cation as the best existing medium for
social mobility. It just seems so unfair
that some of our nation's most hard
working students are unable to reach
their potential because of systematic
barriers that have been in place since
they were born. More generally. I think
my passion for service comes largely

from some adversities my family faced
when I was younger. There is definitely
a notion of compassion and responsibil
ity in my family that is unusual.
SI): At Stanford in Washington (SIW),
you had the opportunity to intern with
the Department of Education. How did
your SIW experience tie in with the
summer programs and your career
goals?
(JN: SIW was a very different experi
ence for me. but reaffirmed my belief
that social entrepreneurship is indeed
the best preparation for policy because
it has enabled me to identify some of
the greatest weaknesses in the system
and then establish a sense of how I can
innovatively change it. Interning at the
U.S. Department of Education really
opened my eyes to the enormity, both in
terms of breadth and depth, of the
problems with our education system.
Having that awareness is daunting but
also motivating.
SD: How do you plan to expand your
educational programs? What are you
planning for this summer?


Junior Garrett Neiman founded Stanford Educational Enterprises (SEE) to help low-income kids improve
their SAT scores after he saw the failures of the educational system firsthand.
