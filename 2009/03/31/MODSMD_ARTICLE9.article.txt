## EDITORIAL Wellness Room a good first step for mental health 
### 
Many of you may have noticed that
the usually dour brown walls and
unassuming couches of the confer
ence rooms in Old Union have been en
hanced with eight-foot crepe-paper flowers,
lush shag carpets and board games. Upon
entering the new ASSU sponsored Wellness
Room, open many afternoons and evenings,
a wellness guide warmly invites visitors to sit
down, relax and de-stress.
I he room truly harkens back to the halcy
on days of kindergarten, where life's main
worry was figuring out which color crayon to
use in one's drawing. It can seem a little out
of place in the middle of Old Union, sur
rounded by students working furiously on
papers and problem sets. Careful observa
tion reveals that the Wellness Room is part
of a larger mission of promoting a dialogue
of mental health on campus.
Working in parallel with the ongoing "I
am not a bystander" campaign that the
ASSU is sponsoring, the Wellness Room has
gotten people around campus talking about
mental health.The oft-mentioned "Stanford
duck syndrome" — which describes the
phenomenon wherein students look serene
and collected above the surface, but are in
reality paddling furiously to stay afloat aca
demically. socially and psychologically —
was identified by the Stanford Mental
Health Task Force as one of the key obsta
cles in engaging students and overcoming
mental health struggles. Issues like depres
sion, eating disorders and academic prob
lems in particular can be difficult for stu
dents to talk about. Promoting an open dia
logue about the problems is a great start to a
healthier, more honest campus. While the
practical effectiveness of the Wellness Room
has yet to be proven.it has certainly generat
ed discussion on campus about mental
health and raised the profile of the ASSIJ's

campaign.
[Tie original idea for the Wellness Room
came out of the need for a scheduling office
for Counseling and Psychological Services
(CAPS) in Old Union. At the direction of
Dr. Ira Friedman and Carole Pertofsky, Di
rectors of Vaden and Health Promotion Ser
vices, respectively, the Wellness Room was
designed to have a more relaxing, friendlier
atmosphere, in keeping with current psycho
logical research demonstrating that a re
laxed state of mind helps people combat
mental health issues.
The Wellness Room does offer, upon re
quest. a complete list of referral organiza
tions for a w ide variety of problems separat
ed by category. Each counselor has gone
through a three-hour training regimen on
how to succeed as a "wellness guide" and
navigate the complex referral system. While
a three-hour training session offers nowhere
near the expertise of a trained psychologist
at CAPS or the rigor of the quarter-long
training of a Bridge Counselor, the friendly
face of a wellness guide is certainly a wel
come and more accessible alternative for
students who don't need immediate help,
but just want to relax and de-stress.The edi
torial board fears, however, that it might not
be as useful for those in need of more exten
sive help, many of whom might not choose to
visit the Wellness Center in the first place.
According to Associate Vice Provost of
Student Affairs Chris Griffith, the Wellness
Room is "one of the most incredible group
projects I've seen at Stanford in over 20
years." With time, we will be able tojudge the
overall effectiveness of the room, but the
focus on expanding open student discussion
of mental health is laudable. We'd tell you
more about it. but right now the Editorial
Board is heading off for a relaxing cup of tea
and a game of Twister.
