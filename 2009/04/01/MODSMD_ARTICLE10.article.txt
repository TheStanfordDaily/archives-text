While the climate around this column
seems to be that I have a penchant
for rambling incoherence (thank
you again. Chappie), every so often, certain
campus issues are of such import that my
myriad of colloquialisms must be temporar
ily put aside.The almost total absence of stu
dent influence over campus life, though cer
tainly not a new problem, is a continuing
flaw of the Farm that merits a serious discus
sion (not unlike I JSC's problem of having
too many morons).
For all those — and there are many of
you — who have ever had a valid complaint
ignored or disregarded bv a University de
partment. it is all too apparent that Stanford
University does not value or prioritize stu
dent input, consultation, advising—hell,
even a shred of student autonomy. While I
am not asking for students to manage the en
dowment or beginning architecture students
to build the next material sciences building. I
do not believe it is unreasonable for such a
talented and engaged population to have
some influence over our student life.
And given that so often the decisions
made by administrators affect students in
less than positive manners (White Pla/a's
$4.O(K).(KM) price tag. anyone?), it takes little
thought to realize we have a giant issue.The
most recent act of top-down imbecility has
been delivered to us. courtesy of I lousing
and Residential and Dining Enterprises.
Swirling around the co-ops has been the
proposed plan to re-do "priority." lbe sys
tem. which is used by themed houses and co
ops to make the residences accessible to
those interested in their respective benefits,
is going to be "revamped" such that co-op
staffs will be allotted half of the available
slots to choose whom they wish (see: their
friends), both dashing away the preferred
"two-tiered" priority system and adding to
the nepotism and muddled joyousness that
currently dominates Mayfield Avenue. And
for the grimly unsurprising, hut nonetheless
disturbing kicker: Other than the incredibly
representative contingent of three or so stu
dents on the Draw Reform Board,THERE
WAS NO REAL STUDFiNT CONSULTA
TION THAT WENT INTO THE DECI
SION MAKING PROCESS!
Housing's edict is merely another act of
bureaucratic closed-mindedness that short
changes the undergraduate population. I
think there is not a single undergrad that
does not realize their peers arc some of the
more engaging, innovative and dynamic
people they have yet come upon in life. Hut

for some reason,our administration does not
seem to truly appreciate our capacity to
make informed decisions that affect our
time at Stanford.
In no way do I mean to insinuate that
there is a vast conspiracy to subjugate the
student body being perpetrated by Greg
Boardman or Chris Griffith, because this
school does employ some pretty spectacular
administrators.
While we do live in virtual paradise, our
Eden is one where any semblance of deci
sion-making power is decidedly out of our
reach. Dining monopolizes our dining op
tions and limits/hinders the proliferation of
independent retailers (Fraiche no longer
takes dining hall meal points as of two days
ago, for example). The OS A tells us how
many damn sober monitors and EANABs
our parties must have, lest the VSO forever
fall out of favor with the current regime.
And if you care to raise a legitimate issue,
your options consist of a) ignored emails; b)
sitting on a Nominations Commission-ap
pointed board whose power and effective
ness is non-existent;or,my personal favorite,
c) callous indignation from particular stu
dent affairs administrators. In short, what we
are left with is a gargantuan bureaucracy
that does not want our input and provides
minimal avenues for students to effectively
articulate their beliefs.
This column may very well be written off
as some needless whining on the part of an
overly pampered brat, that my concerns are
beyond trivial, and that my time raging
against the man is misguided and misplaced.
I am not trying to fool myself: I realize these
individual concerns are essentially meaning
less once you step onto University Avenue
and out into the real world.
But I will not shy away from these issues,
because they speak to a culture of blind sub
mission. of unwillingness to stand up to re
strictive forces, regardless of their benevo
lence, and make a case against them. If Stan
ford is. as our hired propagandists make the
world believe, filled with the future leaders
of the free world.yet we cannot argue for our
beliefs and concerns, then perhaps the god
damned plane has indeed crashed into the
mountain.

/tick wants to see students installed on the
Hoard of Trustees with full voting rights, and a
student review hoard for the OS A. Any other
ideas for making the University administra
tion less controlling? Email /.tick at zwar
