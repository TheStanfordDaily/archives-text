When I was an undergraduate at Har
vard in 1995. John Kenneth Gal
braith spoke to my introductory eco
nomics class. Galbraith. who died in 2006 at
age 98, was a leading liberal economist of the
20th century. I have to admit. 1 don't remem
ber much from the speech, but one anecdote
stands out in my memory.
Galbraith joked about the title he had
given to one of his books, specifically his 1954
bestseller on the 1929 stock market melt
down. Apparently, he said, the title had cost
him sales in one major retail channel — be
cause you can't sell a book called "The Great
Crash" in an airport. Well, times have
changed. I was hunting for reading material in
SFO last week, and there it was. in full splen
dor. in an airport bookstore.
But what caught my attention even more
was the book sitting literally right next to it, a
book that perhaps explains better than most
pundits why Galbraith's cautionary tale of
markets separated from reality is now making
an unfortunate comeback.
"The How of Happiness," by Sonja
Lyubomirsky, is a truly unique work I would
recommend to almost every individual on the
planet. Lyubomirsky. who earned her PhD
here at Stanford, is a professor of psychology
at UC-Riverside. I ler career has been devot
ed to studying human happiness, and her
book is a rigorously researched treatise on
the science of contentment.Transcending an
ecdotal self-help, she explains what her work
and others' say about what makes us happy or
unhappy
I yubomirsky has much to say on the rela
tionship between material wealth and happi
ness. One fact shouted particularly loudly at
me. given the tenor of the times. In 1967, an
annual study of college freshmen reported
that 42 percent believed it's important to be
"very well-off financially," while K6 percent
thought it was essential to "develop a mean
ingful philosophy of life." In 2005, those num
bers had swung to 71 percent and 52 percent,
respectively.
Ibis, of course, has occurred despite the
fact that there's very little connection be
tween wealth and contentment. As
Lyubomirsky reports, research shows that
"we think money will bring lots of happiness
for a long time, and actually it brings a little
happiness for a short time."
Moreover, longitudinal studies of college

freshmen show that those who expressed ma
terialistic goals as freshmen were less happy
two decades later than their peers. And my fa
vorite statistic: Americans earning more than
10 million dollars annually report levels of
personal happiness only slightly greater than
blue-collar workers.
It's too bad for all of us that the executives
at Merrill Lynch, Bear Stearns. Citigroup,
AIG and so many other financial companies
didn't get the memo. Because the systemic
dysfunction we now face results from more
than lax regulations or sub-prime mortgages.
It's also the result of an unrelenting focus in
this country on material wealth at all costs.
Last week in The New York l imes, colum
nist Paul Krugman remarked how. up to the
1980s, the finance industry accounted for
roughly four percent of GDP. In the three
decades since, that number has risen to eight
percent. According to Krugman, the explo
sion of financial wheeling and dealing set off
by the deregulatory mindset of the Reagan
years "attracted many of our sharpest minds
and made a select few immensely rich."
It's not surprising that given a Zeitgeist that
lauds and rewards legal but incredibly risky
financial wizardry, our college freshmen
would show the dramaticswingin their values
and attitudes toward money that Ly
obomirsky reports. When you couple this
with an inviolable sense of entitlement
that because I've gone to the right schools and
landed the right job and worked hard. I de
serve this huge bonus, despite the circum
stances — it's easy to understand what's
going on.
I'm not arguing that finance is evil or that
we should all move out to the country and
grow rice in agricultural collectives. ()ur soci
ety needs a functioning financial system as
much as we need a legal system or a physical
infrastructure. And even the much-maligned
derivative products we've heard so much
about lately may have a constructive role to
play.
Fhe problem is when these tools fall into
the hands of those who care more about
building personal wealth beyond all measure
than about building a society with solid.com
petent institutions. AIG is a perfect example.
The company consists of a number of divi
sions. many of which are solid and profitable
life insurance, aircraft leasing, etc.
But incredibly risky bets made by a few

hundred people in the financial products divi
sion brought the company down. Those hets
essentially involved selling vast, reckless
amounts of insurance policies (called credit
default swaps) on mortgage-hacked bonds
and hoping they would never need to be paid.
Joseph ( assano, who led the I P group, made
$280 million in the past eight years — all of it.
as is now apparent, pulled out of thin air.
America's greatness was built by those
who built — roads, com put e rs, so ft ware, med -
icines, companies, educational systems, non
profits— in other words, goods, services or
institutions that helped drive productivity
growth and create real value.
Cassano and his ilk. on the other hand,
abandoned value and responsibility in the
name of profit. But even if they had gotten
away with it. would it be worth it? I'm willing
to bet that those who build — who measure
their accomplishments in lives touched, in
products created, in infrastructure laid — are
much happier than those who measure it in
dollars.
