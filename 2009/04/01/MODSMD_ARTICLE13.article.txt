GAMfc NOltS: The men's volleyball team will take its last
road trip of the season this weekend as it travels down to
Southern California to take on No. 7 Cal State-Long
Beach and No. 10 UC-San Diego. The Card is on a
three-game winning streak after defeating Cal Stote-
Northridge and UC-Santa Barbara, both by a score of 3-
1, and then sweeping Pacific 3-0 yesterday at Maples.

This past weekend, the Stanford men's vol
leyball team reached new heights in its pursuit
of the national championship. In spite of having
its historic, six-game winning streak abruptly
snapped by Cal Baptist, the Cardinal proved it
self unwavering in its determination to engi
neer a late-season surge: The men swept two
more conference opponents. No. 2 Cal State
Northridge and No. 12 UC-Santa Barbara, in
two of their strongest offensive performances
thus far.
Two Saturdays ago. Stanford's hopes of ex
tending its winning streak of six games — its
longest in 11 years — were cut short by a 30-27.
30-26,30-28 loss to the NAIA's (National Asso
ciation of Intercollegiate Athletics) top-ranked
Cal Baptist. Despite a strong effort by No. 5
Stanford (Ift-K. 9-6 Mountain Pacific Sports
Federation), the Cardinal had no effective re
sponse to the 23 kills put up by the Lancers' out
side hitter, Adiel Tiedjop, and the 10 team
blocks put up by the Cal Baptist players.
What may have been a disastrous blow to
Stanford's momentum, however, turned out
onlv to he a lull in fortune. On Friday, the Car

dinal faced Northridge for the third time this
season, with both past encounters having ended
in 3-1 losses for Stanford. A huge defensive ef
fort by the Cardinal players helped turn the ta
bles as the men edged the Matadors 30-27,34-
32.30-32.30-22. bagging their second victory of
the season over a second-ranked team.
Freshman outside hitter Brad Lawson led
Stanford with IS kills, supported by junior set
ter Kawika Shoji.who totaled 43 assists. Sopho
more outside hitter Spencer McLaughlin also
chipped in 12 kills.
Junior outside hitter Evan Romero knocked
in 17 kills against Northridge to set a school
record for career kills, moving him into first on

Stanford's all-time list in the rally-scoring era
(since 2(X)1). Romero's 1,155 career kills edges
out CurtToppel's 1.143. set in 2003.
"I'm honored." Romero said. "I came here
not knowing what I was doing, but what I've
done is a testament to the team. [Setter] Kawi
ka Shoji helped me, [assistant coach] A 1
Shibuya got on me all the time, and Coach
[John j Kosty gave me the confidence to learn."
"Evan's just a good physical player, and
that's what you need at the opposite position."
Kosty said.
Despite Romero's record-breaking per
formance. it was the Stanford team's defensive
effort that helped absorb Northridge's line of

big hitters and gave the Cardinal the breathing
room it needed to convert its offensive play into
a victory. Overall. Stanford put up 13 team
blocks to the Matador's five, with six blocks
coming off of Romero and five off of freshman
middle blocker Gus Ellis.Together they helped
limit Northridge opposite hitters Nua Tanner
and All-American Eric Vance to a .229 hitting
percentage for the night.
"We worked on stopping their outsides,"
said junior middle blocker Garrett Werner, who
contributed four blocks of his own.
On Saturday, Stanford completed its week-

Junior outside hitter Evan Romero rises for a kill against the Pacific Tigers in yesterday's match. Romero, now the school record-holder for career
kills in the rally-scoring era, helped Stanford sweep Pacific 30-22, 30-23, 30-18 to bring the team's current win streak to three.
end sweep bv beating UC-Santa Bar
bara. 30-27. 30-19, 23-30, 30-24, and
extending its conference winning
streak to five. Four Cardinal players
reached double-digit kills on Kawika
Shoji's 57 assists, with Romero's 19
leading the pack. McLaughlin and
Lawson contributed 12 kills apiece,
and Werner chipped in another 11.
Romero's .359 hitting helped
bump his overall career hitting per
centage to .272. which began the sea
son at .191.This incredible improve
ment is undoubtedly a result of the
.310 average hitting Romero has
maintained throughout the previous
nine matches, eight of which Stan
ford has won.
"Any time your opposite hits .300,
you're scoring a lot of points," Kosty
said. "That's what we're looking for."
On the defensive end. Stanford
put up nine team blocks to the Gau
chos' five, and freshman libero Erik
Shoji picked up 21 digs to give the
Cardinal 47 digs for the night.
With expectations mounting,
Stanford moves into the final seven
matches of the season, all of which
are to be played against conference
opponents. Yesterday, the Cardinal
swept Pacific at home, winning 30-22,
30-23,30-18. This weekend, the team
will take its last road trip of the sea
son, where it will visit No. 7 Cal State-
Long Beach and No. 10 UC-San
Diego.
