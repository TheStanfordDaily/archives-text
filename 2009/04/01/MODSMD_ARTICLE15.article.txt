## Cardinal men suffer spring slump Men drop three matches in a row, all 4-3 
### DANNY BELCH sTAFF WRITER 
Spring break wasn't kind to the Stan
ford men's tennis team, as the Cardinal
lost three matches in the past week, all to
highly ranked teams and all by scores of 4-
3. The team did bounce back yesterday
though, beating Cal Poly 6-1.
A week ago. No. K Stanford (13-4. 0-2
Pacific-10 Conference) traveled to Waco.
Texas to play No. 10 Baylor.The match was
tight the whole way through, with Baylor
capturing the doubles point, but Stanford
fighting back in singles. After No. 13 Alex
Clayton's loss to Baylor's sixth-ranked
Denes Lukacs at No. 1 singles, it came
down to senior Blake Muller at No. 6 sin
gles. with the match tied 3-3. Muller lost
the first set. 7-6. but came back to win the
second set. 6-4. But Muller was not as for
tunate in the third set, falling 6-1. Baylor is
the only team that Stanford has never
beaten in its long history.
Over last weekend, the Cardinal hosted
No. 11 UCLA and No. <X USC in confer
ence matches. Again, Stanford played
tough both matches, but could not come
away with wins, falling 4-3 in both.
Against UCLA, the doubles point was
tightly contested. After a loss at No. 3 dou
bles. Stanford rallied hard to win at No. 1
and 2 doubles to capture the first point.
After trading off victories in singles plav.
the match again was lied 3-3 with the No. 6
singles match yet to be decided.This time,
it was sophomore Greg Hirshman taking
on UCLA's Amit lnbar. I lirshman won the
first set 7-6 and lost the second set 6-3. In
the final set. Inbar clinched the overall win
for the Bruins with a 6-4 victory.
"We could not pull out three singles
matches, something we've been doing all
year long," head coach John Whitlinger
said.
On Saturday against I ISC. it was yet an
other nail-biter. The Trojans captured the
doubles point with a clean sweep of the
three spots. Stanford suffered a bit of bad
luck when Clayton rolled his ankle during
his singles match against I JSC's Jaak Pold
ma. After taking a medical timeout. Clay
ton elected to continue playing, but could
not perform at his best and lost the match.
1 reshman Bradlev Klahn won his
ninth match in a row at No. 2 sin
gles, and senior Matt Bruch rallied
from behind in the third set to win
7-5 and win his match. But USC had
an answer to the Cardinal tough
ness, capturing the match when Ab
dullah Magdas outlasted freshman
Rvan Thacher at No. 3 singles. 7-6.
6-7.7-5.
"It's just the way it's going to be
this year." Whitlinger said of the
three close losses. "We just came up
on the wrong end."
"All of them [were] winnable
matches." he continued. "We had
chances and couldn't quite pull it
out."
Though losses are tough to han
dle, the Cardinal battled throughout
every match and was in a position to

win every single one. Matches like
this, early in the season, are neces
sary if the team is going to make a
deep run in the NCAA Tournament.
The two home matches against
UCLA and USC were highly at
tended. and the crowd provided a
great tennis atmosphere.
"It was so much fun to be a part
of." Whitlinger said. "The crowd re
ally helped the team."
Stanford returned to the court
yesterday, getting off the losing
track by beating Cal Poly. Stanford
swept the doubles matches and
Klahn made his first appearance at
No. 1 singles, earning a straight-set
victory for his 10th straight win.
With a win back under them, the
Cardinal men will travel to Tucson,
Ariz, this weekend to take on the
No. 20 Arizona Wildcats in another
Pac-10 match.
