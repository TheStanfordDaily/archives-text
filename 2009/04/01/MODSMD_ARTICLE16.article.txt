# Don't sleep on Appel, Cardinal
## 
### 
It would seem almost criminal to
write about anything other than
Jayne Appel and the Stanford
women's basketball team this week.
After all. riding the junior center, the
Cardinal is headed back to its second
consecutive Final Four in search of a
National Championship.
But that isn't even what makes
this so special. The performance
Appel put on during the champi
onship game of the Berkeley Re
gional on Monday against lowa State
was truly legendary.The Pac-H) play
er of the year scored 46 points,
grabbed 16 rebounds and blocked
three shots in her herculean effort.
The numbers alone don't do the
performance justice. Appel
outscored the entire lowa State team
in the first half. 27-25. The game
marked the third-highest scoring
performance by a player in NCAA
tournament history, and the most
ever by a Stanford player.
lowa State head coach Bill Fen
nelly opted to single-cover the sec
ond team All-American throughout
the game, a bold strategy that didn't
exactly play out well for him. When
the two teams met earlier in the sea
son, double and triple teaming Appel
only led to her kicking the ball out to
open three point shooters, which
killed the Cyclones.
You would think that after Appel
scored 15 points in the first 7:44 of
the game. Fennelly might have given
other Stanford players a chance to
beat the Cyclones. Instead, the Car
dinal supporting cast was left feeding
Appel, who consistently established
great position. leading to a barrage of
lavups and hook shots.
TTie Stanford win has deeper im
plications for both Appel and the
team. This was the junior's coming
out party. For two years, Appel was
great for the Cardinal,yet often over
looked. Coming off the bench as a
freshman and then starting as a soph
omore. Appel was always a solid con
tributor. but was often times stuck in
the shadow of hallowed Stanford
great Candice Wiggins.
This year has been Appel's time
to shine, and Monday night she
showed the world that she is one of
the best players in the game, and
that Stanford has the ability to beat
anyone.
Speaking of beating anyone, Stan
ford's next opponent, the Connecti
cut Huskies, hasn't lost since Stan
ford beat them in the Final Four a
year ago. Not only that, but UConn
has won all of its games this season by
double digits and has been anointed
by many as the greatest women's col
lege basketball team ever.
Maybe, just maybe, Appel's game
on Monday will strike some fear into
the Huskies and the Cardinal will be
able to be the David to UConn's Go
liath this coming weekend.
If Stanford wins its first game, it
will have a chance to do what it fell
one game short doing last year
win a National Championship. The
Cardinal has unfinished business in
the Final Four, but the way the team
has played in the tournament, it
looks very determined to sew up old
wounds.
If it is able to win the national title,
the women's basketball team will be
overcoming a hump that has haunted
Stanford sports teams all year.
The women's volleyball, soccer,
synchronized swimming and men's
water polo teams have all come with
in a breath of a national champi
onship year, but each has fallen one
game or two short of eternal glory.
I"he women's basketball team could
be poised to stop that trend.
After all. this team has continual
ly been overlooked, yet still exceed
ed expectations. Despite being
ranked second in the country before
the tournament. Stanford was not
given a number one seed, even
though it played one of the most dif
ficult schedules in the country.
With Wiggins' graduation last
spring, nobody expected Stanford to
be where it is today, but as we all saw
Monday night, Appel stepped into
Wiggins very big shoes, and Stanford
is headed back to the Final Four.
