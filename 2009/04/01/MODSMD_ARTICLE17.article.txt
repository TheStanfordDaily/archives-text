where we needed to be. We all felt
the trust that everyone was going to
do their part, and that's exactly what
happened. We were very consistent
and composed under pressure."

through our routine, so the amazing
part was that nobody was shaken bv
it." she continued. "We just got out
of the pool and were ready to go
again. We still felt confident that we
