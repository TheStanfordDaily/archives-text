# Campaign week to start TONIGHT
## Grads vs. undergrads in Executive race; new coalition of 10 candidates in play for Senate race 
### MARISA LANDICHO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Tonight at 12:01 a.m. marks the official
start of campaign week for the ASSU elec
tions. but there are already multiple stories
shaping up before the clock starts ticking for
candidates to make an impression.
Executive Race
Next week's ASSU elections will again
feature a battle between Stanford's graduate
and undergraduate populations — David
Gobaud M.S.'OB M.S.'IO, who narrowly came
in second place in last year's Executive elec
tion. is running again this year along with Jay
de la Torre '10. Undergraduates Bennett
Mauser '10 and Matt Sprague '10 will be
Gobaud-de la Torre's main competition.
Last year, under the slate Go Go Gobaud
Goldgof. Ciobaud and Greg Goldgof 'OS fin
ished second out of five slates for the 2008
Executive spot, earning 1880 votes to Jonny
Dorsey and Pagan Harris' 2150 votes.
The breakdown of first-choice votes, how
ever. revealed the divide between grads and
undergrads in last year's campaign.

Dorsey-Harris, with 1534 votes, had 1.000
more first-choice votes from undergrads than
the next highest slate, Gobaud-Goldgof.
However. Gobaud. the only grad student
in the Exec race, earned nearly four times as
many graduate first-choice votes than the
ultimate winners, Dorsey and Harris.
Gobaud is now trying to rewrite history
with current running-mate de la Torre.
This year, there is only one competitive
undergrad slate: Bennett Hauser 10 and
Matt Sprague *10. Last year, the Dorsey-
Harris slate split the undergraduate vote
between four other undergrad slates — this
time there will be far less competition for the
undergraduate vote.
Gobaud views his grad status as a strong
asset.
"If anything, running as a grad/undergrad
team with Jay is beneficial because it allows
us to truly represent the entire student body,"
Gobaud wrote in an email to The Daily. "For
years, important issues such as grad mental
health, grad cost of living and the lack of
dependent health care have been ignored at
the Executive level."

Senate Race
In the Senate, a new coalition of candi
dates has formed. Anchored by current
Senate Chair Shelley Gao'l I."Students for a
Better Stanford" could change the way the
Senate race is run. Ten Senate candidates
have indicated their participation in
"Students for a Better Stanford."
In previous elections, endorsements, pri
marily from the Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC) and The Stanford Review, have been
very important. But with Gao's new coali
tion. the value of endorsements may change.
Campaign Finance
Financial reforms passed by the
Undergraduate Senate and the Graduate
Student Council (GSC) will also attempt to
change the playing field this campaign sea
son.
This year, students running for Executive
are eligible to receive $750 in ASSIJ funds to
subsidize their campaign. Candidates accept
ing public money are required to cap their
total spending at $1,500.
The Gobaud-de la Torre slate has said that
they will be accepting the public funds and

the subsequent spending limit, though they
still plan on ordering T-shirts, which typically
run up campaign costs.
Last year. Gobaud spent a reported total
of $3,768.55 on his campaign, including
$1787.81 on shirts. The winning Dorsey-
Harris slate purchased $2046.35 in shirts and
spent a total of $3,597.31.
"The spending limit has encouraged us to
use our creativity to come up with ways of
campaigning that aren't centered around
spending money." Gobaud said.
The Hauser-Sprague slate, on the other
hand, said they won't be taking the public
ftinds.
"While we value the principle of public
financing, we do not believe it is prudent for
our slate to accept money from a weakened
ASSU in this time of economic crisis."
Hauser and Sprague wrote in an email to The
Daily.
"However, public financing is great for
those who would otherwise be dissuaded
from running," they added. The slate has
agreed to cap their own spending at $2,000
and have taken steps to limit their
expenditures, such as spray-paint
ing the designs onto their campaign
shirts.
As the rules stand, there are no
spending caps for the class president
races or the Senate race. Although
the Elections Commission
Handbook recommends candidates
to limit themselves to certain
amounts ($150(1 for Executive. $200
for class president slates and $150
for Senate candidates), the amounts
are not enforced.
One sophomore class slate.
Hardcore as a Sophomore, attempt-

Ed to establish their own spending
cap in early March, but no consen
sus was ever reached between the
three slates running and the plan
fizzled.
Some senators have expressed
worries that the lack of a cap will
result in an explosion of spending
during this election season.
Hardcore as a Sophomore, lack
ing a spending cap, said they would
spend around $800 on their cam
paign depending on the actions of
other slates, far exceeding the $200
guideline advised by the Elections
Commission.
The Daily will have complete
coverage of the 200V A SS U Elections
throughout campaign week.
