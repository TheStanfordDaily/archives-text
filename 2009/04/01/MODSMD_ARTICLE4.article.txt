## Senate discusses grad role in funding Senators question funds for Student Services Division 
### ZOE RICHARDS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As its term nears the end. the
Undergraduate Senate discussed
the budget for the new Student
Services Division (SSD). which
will act as an operational arm of
the ASSU providing additional
resources for students. Among its
services are the Green Store,
Wellness Room. Airport Shuttles
and Informational and
Pducational Resources (IPR),
which became a major source of
contention at Tuesday's meeting.
I PR would involve workshops
proposed by the Graduate
Student Council (GSC). includ
ing tax aid. legal informational
meetings and possibly seed
money for student projects.
Senator Puukas lives '09, the
Administration & Rules Chair,
explicitly rejected the proposi
tion for significant
Undergraduate Senate funding
on the grounds that the programs
primarily serve the Graduate stu
dent community. Others dis
agreed with lives.
"We don't want to see this be
completely nixed because it is a
service to our students." said
Yvorn "Doc" Aswad-Thomas "11,
who saw the mutual benefits of
tax aid and other programming
for undergraduate students.
After completing a pilot year
of the Wellness Room, the ASSU
eventually hopes that it can be
moved to the Special Fees Ballot,
which will open up more funds
for other ASSU initiatives within
the nearly $32,000 SSD budget.
However, the possibility did not
seem to satisfy those in the
Senate who demanded that dol
lars spent by the Undergraduate
Senate primarily benefit under
graduate students.
lives emphasized the impor
tance of sharing burdens
between the Undergraduate
Senate and GSC.
"If graduate students benefit,
I want them to pay something
commensurate to how they bene
fit," lives said.
The senator pointed out the
importance in ensuring that

funding for lER he financed hv
the GSC and Undergraduate
Senate in proportion to how
undergraduates and graduate
students benefit, with the GSC
paying more for programs that
primarily cater to graduate stu
dents.
"Until I see something reflect
ing that. I'm not comfortable
signing off on it." lives said.
Senate Deputy Chair Patrick
Cordova ('O9) agreed and said
"[The GSC has] great interest to
participate, but great hesitance to
contribute funding."
"It's unfortunate and discon
certing . . . I'm losing compas
sion." he added.
Vice President Pagan Harris
'09 contended that because the
ASSU discriminates on pricing
for Airport Shuttles and Green
Store products, by charging grad
uate students more for these
services, the Undergraduate divi
sion of the ASSU ought to make
a better effort to support IPR
that will help graduate and
undergraduate students alike.
At the end of his term and
faced with a contentious funding
question, Harris did not take on
his typical role of mediation
between the Undergraduate
Senate and the GSC. Harris
remained doubtful about success
ful negotiations between the two
parties regarding proportional
shared funding for the new lER.
"I'm utilitarian right now and I
hate it." I larris said.
He later deemed funding for
the Green Store among the top
priorities, moving funding for I PR
that primarily benefit graduate
students to the back shelf.
The meeting concluded with a
decision to write what the Senate
described as a "friendly amend
ment" to the bill, which subsidized
the undergraduate student por
tion of lER. The Senate also made
the decision to pass the remainder
of the SSI) budget.
Reflecting on the divide
between undergraduate and grad
uate interests that had dominated
the meeting, Harris was somber.
"It's going to require a culture
change," Harris said of the GSC's
feeling of separation from the rest
of the ASSU. "It's frustrating our
efficacy."
