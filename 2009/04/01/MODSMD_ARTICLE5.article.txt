## Students undeterred by Wall Street mess Soon-to-be grads see opportunity amidst downturn 
### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Growing anger and frustration with Wall
Street hit a high note this month, as mass pub
lic furor with compensation in the finance sec
tor. particularly with insurance giant AICi,
resulting in Congressional efforts to tax bonus
es at all companies receiving significant bailout
funds.
But despite watching the vilification of Wall
Street over the last several weeks, many busi
ness and finance students at Stanford remain
optimistic about the market they will enter
after graduation.
Those students who plan to soon enter the
world of business and finance will do so amid
one of the worst economic downturns since
the Great Depression,and in an atmosphere in
which Federal Treasury bailouts, irresponsible
investment practices and CFO bonuses have
fed public animosity against big business.
Despite this climate, Stanford students seem
largely resilient, and even hopeful, for the
future.
Alex Song W. who is completing degrees
in both economics and bioniechanical engi
neering. is still heading to the Street after
graduation — lie will be joining Morgan
Stanley's fixed income division upon gradua
tion.
Song is hopeful about his chances of suc
ceeding durum the recession: he believes that

he will have more opportunities for success
than many who were in the industry prior to
the recession.
"The landscape has changed so much that,
il there's any time to enter the industry it's
now," Song said. "Three or four years from
now. people entering will have a much better
advantage than other generations."
Evan Reas MBA '() l ) hasn't changed his
plans due to the current economic climate,
and plans to enter the business world after
graduation. Reas noted that the funding cru
cial for starting a new business is harder to
find than it was just a year ago, as investors are
much less likely to trust a Hedging company
with their capital.
"I'm looking all over the place." Reas said.
"You really have to show that you're making
money before investors will get on board."
Reas came to the (iSB with the long-term
plan of either founding his own business after
graduating or joining a start-up. He has had to
alter his immediate business plans somewhat
as a result of the times. In response to a grow
ing reluctance toward risk within the invest
ment sector, Reas has had to look at safer,
more traditional options for the company he
hopes to begin.
"There's a narrower selection of ideas that
I'm going after right now." he said. "It makes
it much tougher on which business models
you can go after."
Hie recession nonetheless could offer
some benefits for Reas: layoffs, for example,
could mean that he will be able to staff his

company much more cheaply by
offering lower wages. Reas hopes to
be able to capitalize on these kinds of
effects. Those starting businesses at
this time, he said, have the potential
to wind up on top when the economy
recovers.
Even with their optimism for the
future, both Reas and Song noted
that these are undoubtedly risky
times for those entering business and
finance. Song also added that, on
Wall Street, the demand for finance
jobs right now greatly surpasses the
actual supply available. Yet both felt
comparatively secure taking their
first steps in their respective sectors,
and for the same reason — they will
have Stanford degrees.
According to Reas, having a
Stanford MBA means that the
"opportunity cost" of starting a new
business from scratch will be better
for him than for other young entre
preneurs. For one thing, he will
already have an impressive contact
network of fellow CiSB graduates,
which could make it easier for him to
find funding sources. Song believes
that his degrees will help to make an
impression on Wall Street.
"In New York, there's not actual

ly that many people from the West
Coast," he said." I think coming from
Stanford gives me the advantage of
setting me apart from the Harvard
and Princeton [crowd]."
Alex Wu '09 is also confident that
his Stanford economics degree will
give him an advantage over many
others.
"Being at a place like Stanford,
there is still going to be a demand for
you," Wu said.
It remains to be seen how much
their degrees will wind up helping

those students entering the business
world after graduation. What does
seem to be clear is that, for many stu
dents at Stanford, the recession does
not present a hardship so much as an
opportunity for analysis and future
gain.
"It's rare that you actually get to
live through an economic downside of
this magnitude," Wu said. "It's been a
really great learning environment."
