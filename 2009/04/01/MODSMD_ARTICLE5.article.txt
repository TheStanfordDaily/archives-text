### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Growing anger and frustration with Wall
Street hit a high note this month, as mass pub
lic furor with compensation in the finance sec
tor. particularly with insurance giant AICi,
resulting in Congressional efforts to tax bonus
es at all companies receiving significant bailout
funds.
But despite watching the vilification of Wall
Street over the last several weeks, many busi
ness and finance students at Stanford remain
optimistic about the market they will enter
after graduation.
Those students who plan to soon enter the
world of business and finance will do so amid
one of the worst economic downturns since
the Great Depression,and in an atmosphere in
which Federal Treasury bailouts, irresponsible
investment practices and CFO bonuses have
fed public animosity against big business.
Despite this climate, Stanford students seem
largely resilient, and even hopeful, for the
future.
Alex Song W. who is completing degrees
in both economics and bioniechanical engi
neering. is still heading to the Street after
graduation â€” lie will be joining Morgan

graduation. Reas noted that the funding cru

find than it was just a year ago, as investors are
much less likely to trust a Hedging company
with their capital.
"I'm looking all over the place." Reas said.
"You really have to show that you're making
money before investors will get on board."
Reas came to the (iSB with the long-term
plan of either founding his own business after
graduating or joining a start-up. He has had to
alter his immediate business plans somewhat
as a result of the times. In response to a grow
ing reluctance toward risk within the invest
ment sector, Reas has had to look at safer,
more traditional options for the company he
hopes to begin.
"There's a narrower selection of ideas that
I'm going after right now." he said. "It makes
it much tougher on which business models
you can go after."

some benefits for Reas: layoffs, for example,
could mean that he will be able to staff his
