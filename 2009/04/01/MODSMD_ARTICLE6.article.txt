## Students help out in Big Easy Groups pursue service and business projects New Orteans for spring break 
### ERIC MESSINGER DESK EDITOR 
Most college students heading to New Orleans for
spring break used to arrive ready for a week of revelry
in a hustling city with an infamously wild nightlife. But
after Hurricane Katrina. New Orleans is attracting a
different kind of attention from college students, includ
ing those at Stanford.
Since the death and devastation left by the hurricane
in 2005, New Orleans has had to weather even more
misfortune, reeling from the flight of thousands of its
citizens and slow or ineffective responses to the dam
age. A group from Stanford's Alternative Spring Break
program (ASB) went to the city for a busy week that
included meetings with local volunteers and hurricane
survivors. Students sought primarily to gain a further
understanding about the complex situation in the city,
and also to assist in educational and service projects,
including planting wetlands to help decrease future
storm surges.
"We wanted to get our hands dirty" said Nick
Mclntyre '11. "We (tried) to expose ourselves to as
many of the major issues as we could."
The trip leaders were Mclntyre and Jess Hawkins
'11. both of whom had participated in the program the
previous year and found themselves excited at the
opportunity to return.
"We knew there was so much more to be done."
Hawkins said. "When we were there. I felt there wasn't
enough time to explore everything."
Hawkins and Mclntyre agreed that a key experience
was tutoring for a day at the Sophie B. Wright Charter
School.There, they were able to observe the severe gaps
in learning evident in the education system, and attempt
to help with fundamental skills.
"It seemed like we were plugging a serious gap."
Mclntyre said. "Instead of helping explain who [19th
century Senator] Henry Clay was. we would be showing
them how to use an index and glossary."
"We put far more of a focus on how to learn, rather
than teaching them a few facts," he added.
The ASB group prepared throughout w inter quarter,
enlisting both knowledgeable students and professors
to provide introductory lectures.
While the undergraduate students focused on their
efforts. Stanford GSB students also made their wa\ to
New Orleans for a different project. Second-year MBA
students Ashley Dayton and Luke Stewart worked with
the non-profit IDEACorps to help with local start-up
Feelgoodz, which produces eco-friendly flip-flops
Dayton explained that the students focused on making
two main contributions to the two-man company they
aimed to assist.
"We had to make sure the company had the capaci
ty to fulfill sales, and to generate demand so people
know this product exists." Dayton said. "We ended up
giving (Feelgoodz] an action plan â€” tactical steps thev
could take."
Dayton observed that New
Orleans is providing many opportu
nities for new businesses.
"I would say there's a burgeon
ing community" Dayton said. "It's
really supporting businesses, mak
ing sure that it's easy for entrepre
neurs. Right now it's still a chal
lenge. but it's getting better."
Stewart emphasized that busi
nesses face significant challenges
operating out of New Orleans.
"There is not a lot of the infra
structure, both on the capital side
and the legal side, to build a big
business." Stewart said.
Stanford students from New
Orleans have kept an eye towards
the volunteer efforts, both those of
their classmates and the larger vol

unteer network present in the city.
"I think it's exciting," said
Richard Futrell "10. "I really do feel
like these college and religious
groups are doing unequivocally
good work."
"I sometimes feel like the city is
being rebuilt by volunteers," he
added.

Sarah Woodward '09 added that
the volunteers provide a much
needed energy to the city's efforts to
recover from the tragedies of 2(H)5
and beyond.
"It's a hard thing for the city,
where there are only pockets of
leadership." Woodward said.
"There's a lot of pessimism on the
part of many of the people, where
it's hard to persist."
Hawkins felt that the people she
met within the city were, in their
own right, an inspiration for volun
teer efforts.
"Outside of New Orleans a lot of
people have, given up." Hawkins
said. "People see it as destined for
failure."
"But people really are invested,"
she added. "A huge majority of the
city doesn't feel like the rest of the
world. Thev want to rebuild."
