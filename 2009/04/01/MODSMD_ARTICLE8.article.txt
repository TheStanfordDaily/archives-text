Officially "Viticulture and Oenology,"
hut better known among students as the
"wine-tasting class." this course is more than
a group of alcoholic seniors looking for an
excuse to binge-drink on a weekday
evening.
"Students really learn how to recogni/e
good wine from bad wine: that's the point,"
said Patricia de Castries, assistant director of
the Stanford Language Center and faculty
affiliate for La Maison Francaise."You learn
how to drink it. sip it. enjoy it. You don't
binge."
The viticulture class was founded in 1998

by a master's student interested in teaching
people how to appreciate wine. The class
was immediately full and has been filling up
ever since. Although restricted to students
over 21 (they do check student records), the
class has remained one of Stanford's most
popular classes.
Students cite a variety of motivations for
taking the course, but everyone wants to
learn about wine and appreciate it.
"The whole purpose of the class is to
enjoy wine more," said A.J. Ferrari, course
instructor and bartender at Michael Mina in
San Francisco. "I'm trying to take away the
anxiety surrounding wine, to demystify it.
Wine is like art — if you don't know any
thing about it. it's hard to talk about."
Ferrari, who has spent 14 years in the
wine industry, lends his many insights to the
class, condensing a year or two of experience
in the industry into the nine weeks of the
course.
Ferrari brings five or six different wines

for everyone to taste at the weekly class
meetings at La Maison Francaise. As student
volunteers pour the wine, Ferrari talks about
each label, explaining the process of making
different types of wine or the flavors that
characterize each varietal. After inhaling the
bouquet and tasting the wine, the students
discuss their impressions.
Some of the course meetings have

themes, such as sparkling wines or Italian
wines.These meetings allow students a more
in-depth understanding of different wine
making processes and of specific regional
wines.
Ferrari also incorporates guest lectures
and a field trip into his syllabus. Last fall.
Chris Benziger of Benziger Family Winery
in Sonoma came to discuss the biodvnamic

process in making their wines. Students also
visited a wine-tasting event at Rosenblum
Cellars' tasting room in Alameda, where
they had the opportunity to try over 40
wines.
By the end of the quarter, students
understand the basic process of wine-mak-
