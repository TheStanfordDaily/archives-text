Officially "Viticulture and Oenology,"
hut better known among students as the
"wine-tasting class." this course is more than
a group of alcoholic seniors looking for an
excuse to binge-drink on a weekday
evening.
"Students really learn how to recogni/e
good wine from bad wine: that's the point,"
said Patricia de Castries, assistant director of
the Stanford Language Center and faculty
affiliate for La Maison Francaise."You learn
how to drink it. sip it. enjoy it. You don't
binge."
The viticulture class was founded in 1998

by a master's student interested in teaching
people how to appreciate wine. The class
was immediately full and has been filling up
ever since. Although restricted to students
over 21 (they do check student records), the
class has remained one of Stanford's most
popular classes.
Students cite a variety of motivations for
taking the course, but everyone wants to
learn about wine and appreciate it.
"The whole purpose of the class is to
enjoy wine more," said A.J. Ferrari, course
instructor and bartender at Michael Mina in
San Francisco. "I'm trying to take away the
anxiety surrounding wine, to demystify it.
Wine is like art — if you don't know any
thing about it. it's hard to talk about."
Ferrari, who has spent 14 years in the
wine industry, lends his many insights to the
class, condensing a year or two of experience
in the industry into the nine weeks of the
course.
Ferrari brings five or six different wines

for everyone to taste at the weekly class
meetings at La Maison Francaise. As student
volunteers pour the wine, Ferrari talks about
each label, explaining the process of making
different types of wine or the flavors that
characterize each varietal. After inhaling the
bouquet and tasting the wine, the students
discuss their impressions.
Some of the course meetings have

themes, such as sparkling wines or Italian
wines.These meetings allow students a more
in-depth understanding of different wine
making processes and of specific regional
wines.
Ferrari also incorporates guest lectures
and a field trip into his syllabus. Last fall.
Chris Benziger of Benziger Family Winery
in Sonoma came to discuss the biodvnamic

process in making their wines. Students also
visited a wine-tasting event at Rosenblum
Cellars' tasting room in Alameda, where
they had the opportunity to try over 40
wines.
By the end of the quarter, students
understand the basic process of wine-mak-


AGUSTIN RAMIREZ/The Stanford Daily
Students line up at 10 p.m. last night for a spot in "Viticulture and Oenology" - the popular wine-tasting class. These hopefuls have been waiting
since 1 p.m., and many more are expected to wait throughout the night.
ing and have a great deal of experi
ence in wine tasting.
"You become more open-mind
ed about different types of wine,"
said Katharine Wulff '09. "The goal
is to know what you like and what
you don't like. Hie class gives you
more confidence and encourages
you to fully engage your senses and
be thoughtful about it."
Brian Chavarria *08 emphasized
the importance of developing per
sonal taste through the class.
"[Ferrari] told us that the most
important part of the class wasn't to
all agree on what is a 'good' wine,
but to focus on finding what each of
us liked in wine, how to describe
that and to really build up our own

personal knowledge of wine so we
could enjoy it more," he said in an
email to The Daily.
Although they might not remem
ber every wine they taste, students
develop the confidence to purchase
a bottle or order a glass in a restau
rant.
"One of my favorite wine experi
ences was at a restaurant with
another friend from wine-tasting
class." Chavarria said. "We decided
to go with the wine pairings for each
course. Having taken the course, I
was able to appreciate how well the
wine was paired with the food."
"It was amazing to observe how
much food can affect the wine and
vice versa," he added. "A wine that
originally smelled light and fruity
was transformed into something
totally different when paired with
the food."
The course, however, is not sim
ply about wine appreciation. For

many students the viticulture class
teaches a set of valuable skills for
life after graduation.
"It was one of the best classes I
took at Stanford ... in terms of
actual learning," said Owen Li 'OS in
an email to Fhe Daily.
Li, a trader for a hedge fund in
New York, goes out to dinner pro
fessionally almost every weeknight.
"The lessons learned have defi
nitely helped me navigate wine lists
confidently," he said. "Last week,
there was a medium-sized wine list
at a restaurant with a modest set of
Napa [cabernet sauvignons], I was
actually able to discuss each one."
Although the material covered in
the viticulture class might not be
directly applicable to professional
life after Stanford, the course helps
develop the ability to talk about
wines, which many students have
found to be a useful social skill.
"The class definitelv gave me

more confidence in picking wines at
dinner and talking about wine with
friends and colleagues." C'havariia
said.
Niji Jain '08 agrees
"I love talking to people about
wine now and defining feel more
confident at social gatherings,' Jain
said in an email to The Daily "I've
found that talking about wine is a
great conversation starter, and peo
pie enjoy talking about ii "

"Cio to a wine bar or wine shop,"
he said. "Beltramos in Menlo F' irk

"We're so close to Sonoma and
Napa. It's all about posonal experi

added.
Jain also had advice for students
interested in developing their wine-

tasting skills outside of class.
