## EDITORIAL Fostering corporate ethics through the humanities 
### 
The New York Times printed an article a
few weeks ago on the need to retrain
business schools and instill responsible
management and values in business students,
especially in light of the failures of so many
MBA-holding financial executives that led us
into the current financial disaster.
The Times' description of the failures of
business executives to conduct moral reason
ing or consider their responsibility when mak
ing financial decisions was reminiscent of Mitt
Romney's performance during his presiden
tial run, which in many ways illustrated the po
tential drawbacks of the business education
system and business reasoning. Few could
deny that Romney — who earned joint law
and business degrees from Harvard, graduat
ed in the top five percent of his business school
class and amassed a fortune of several hun
dred million dollars as a consultant — is a very
smart guy. Hut Romney's business abilities
seemed to have left him short-handed as a
public servant during the presidential cam
paign and reflected the deep and entrenched
failings of American business reasoning.
People can and often do change their mind
on many policy questions, but Romney
seemed to display no moral base at all — he
became notorious during the campaign for
flip-flops on positions from abortion to gay
rights to gun control. What he did display,
however, is the thinking of a business execu
tive: he sized up the situation, calculated the
positions most likely to help him win the elec
tion. and adopted them. Just as the business
world typically requires no normative ques
tions of its CEOs — only empirical questions
about hew to maximize efficiency and attain
narrowly defined corporate goals — Romney
seemed unable to ask himself normative ques
tions about what was realistic, good and hu
mane policy.
ITie business executives brought on the fi
nancial crisis with their overly-riskv maneu
vers when they proved unable to ask ques
tions beyond how best to maximize efficiency
and make money The editorial board does not

wish to assert that every leader in the business
community is morally corrupt, but there was
clearly some deep failing in the reasoning of
many of our nation's business leaders.
While infusing the business world with a
stronger sense of responsibility could prove a
difficult task, we believe that a renewed focus
on the humanities in both business schools
and undergraduate institutions might be ben
eficial.
Recently, a broad discussion has emerged
on the fate of the humanities, particularly as
the financial crisis has seemed to have a dis
proportionate and dire effect on the humani
ties departments at many schools when com
pared to departments seen as more pre-pro
fessional. Stanford, for example, cut funding
for its Interdisciplinary Studies in the I luman
ities program last month. In such moments of
economic crisis, perhaps it would be useful to
consider what the humanities can offer the
business world. What could a little more nor
mative and ethical reasoning — a subtle skill
honed best through the study of moral ques
tions and gray-area dilemmas characteristic of
the humanities — have done for the many
business executives who recklessly disregard
ed the risks they were taking in the market
place?
Rethinking the business school curricu
lum. perhaps by introducing social and envi
ronmental issues, as well as interdisciplinary
perspectives on complex problems, is neces
sary in light of the great ethical failures some
of our MBA-holders have committed in the fi
nancial sector. But this failure in ethical disci
pline also points to a more far-reaching imper
ative: to emphasize a foundation of normative
thinking in every discipline through funding
the humanities and increasing the interaction
between the humanities and the more pre
professional disciplines.
The investment we make in humanities
"training" for our next generation of leaders
could pay off several-fold if it serves to avert
another economic crisis precipitated by
morally questionable practices.
