## EDITORIAL VPSA cuts need to be more openly discussed 
### 
On Wednesday, Vice Provost Greg
Boardman announced nearly $3 mil
lion dollars in budget cuts for the Of
fice of the Vice Provost for Student Affairs
(VPSA). Iliese cuts will reduce the VPSA
budget by approximately 15 percent for fiscal
year 2010, impacting every unit of the VPSA.
including residential education, Vaden
I lealth Center and community centers.
While the Vice Provost would not com
ment on unit-specific budget cuts, he noted
that 11 staff members had been laid off. Ac
cording to the VPSA, priority was given to
maintaining funding for programs and serv
ices that focus on student health, safety and
wellbeing, academic achievement, compli
ance obligations and risk management. (See
"VPSA unveils overall cuts" in today's
Daily.)
Plans to slash $100 million from the Uni
versity budget over the next two years pres
ent the VPSA with a serious challenge in de
termining how and where to make reduc
tions. The economic situation has forced ad
ministrators to make difficult choices that
may negatively affect Stanford students, fac
ulty and staff.The editorial board commends
the VPSA's commitment to protecting core
services and minimizing the impact of budg
et cuts on student life. I I forts to communi
cate with the ASSU executives and student
groups about the reductions have helped the
student body understand how the VPSA is
carrying out its budget process.
However, the editorial board urges
VPSA unit directors to be more transparent
in how their offices are being affected by the
cuts. We find it unfortunate that the Office of
the VPSA has been vague about how much
has been cut from each unit, arguinn that

unit directors have discretion in disclosing
how the reductions will he met. While it is
appropriate for unit directors to reallocate
program funding in light of limited re
sources, the student body has a right to know
how much money has been cut from pro
grams important to student life, such as resi
dential education and community centers.
The Vice Provost emphasized that stu
dents should feel little to no impact based on
the strategic manner in which the budget re
ductions are being carried out. However,
unit directors now face hard choices as to
which programs to keep, cut funding from or
eliminate altogether. Micro-level decision
making across VPS As various units are like
ly to shed light on the day-to-day conse
quences of budget reductions for Stanford
students.
Until information regarding unit-specific
cuts is made public, it is difficult to anticipate
how the VPSA budget decisions will affect
the quality of student lite. It is also important
to note that this is only the first round of
VPSA cuts; the Vice Provost will announce
more reductions in the coming months in
order to meet the full 15 percent reduction
that has been mandated by the University
budget office. Although the VPSA has near
ly met its reduction goal in this initial round,
the lull force of the budget cut has yet to be
realized.
The editorial board urges the VPSA to
continue to minimize layoffs, as the majority
of VPSA staff provides direct support for
students. Most importantly, the VPSA must
do its very best to ensure that adequate
funding is still available for the community
center and residential education program
mint: that is so vital to student life.
