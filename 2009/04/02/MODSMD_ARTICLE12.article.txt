I "possess neither the self-righteous indig
nation nor the naive ignorance to expect
.Stanford students to believe that Spring
Break is a time for service or sacrifice. In
deed. it plans had turned only slightly differ
ently. I might well have found myself this
past week relaxing on the beach in Hawaii
with three of my best friends. As it hap
pened. my decision to go on I lillel's Alterna
tive Spring Break trip to help rebuild in New
Orleans did not arise out of some great
moral clarity, but rather, because my friend
Raquel asked me to come with her.
This place needs our help, and more than
you think. I"he disparity between what still
needs to be done there and most Americans'
lack of awareness of those needs is stagger
ing. It's been three and a half years, and still
New ()rlcans is er\ ing out for our help. You
walk down the streets ol St. Bernard's Parish
I list east of the Mississippi River, and you see
house after house after house still with those
spray-painted "X"s beside a number on the
front â€” the former signifying the residence
as uninhabitable, the latter number repre
senting the dead bodies that were found in
side.
The city is broken, physically and spiritu
ally, and. without help, perhaps permanently.
The recovery effort has been shamefully
slow and inadequate. It is happening in our
country, on our watch. And yet my fear is
that the longer the conditions remain the
same, the more complacent we become. We
are already forgetting.
We are forgetting that the traumatic suf
fering of those who have lost loved ones is
still unbearable not only because ol their
loss, but also because too few ol us have kept
them in our minds and hearts, and fewer are
willing help them recover.
My first night staying at our Camp in St.
Bernard's Parish shook me to my core. (her
dinner, as some of the ASB leaders asked for
reflections and thoughts among participants,
an older man. sitting alone in a t-shirt and
dirt> jeans, rose and began to speak.
Steve had. as he would repeat again and
again during his short sermon, lost every
thing. He lives in the very IT MA trailer
where his wife died, and the government is
threatening to kick him out soon. As he
began to despair over the loss of his former
life, his catharsis was palpable, but in a sense
that could never be complete. I he more he
talked, the more he shook and cried. As we
listened, stunned and spellbound. Steve's
dignified voice rose out as a cry against his
undignified condition.
But Steve finished with a simple message:
that it was seeing volunteers who had not
forgotten his community that gave him
hope.
More than one expert with whom we met
during our trip called the New Orleans re
covery ellorl the Civil Rights movement ol
our lime. In the 1%()s. Martin I uthcr . Jr.

called on those in his community and his
country to seek to attain a state of what the
ancient Greeks called agape love toward
their fellow man. Agape refers to a love that
needs no reciprocity, a love that seeks noth
ing in return. One simply has agape toward
Ins fellow man because both he and his fel
low man are human. Agape is the love that
New Orleans requires from us. because it is
through the spirit of agape that man can w ill
inglv give himself. That is the love that will
cause us to give all of ourselves and to help
raise the city from its ruins.
Raquel and I extended our trip for two
days to get a sense of the city's heart, the
I 'rench Ouarter. As we walked lazily past the
small bars, clubs and jazz musicians. I felt as
if I had walked into a dreamland. This city,
miraculously, still has more soul, more vi
brancy and more spirit than just about any
where else I have been in the United States.
It is indeed suffering through a tragedy from
which it may never hilly recover. But walk
down the streets of the french Ouarter. and
you will see that the people of New Orleans
are still singing. Their song is no longer a
mere celebration of life. Today it is an emo
tional summon.
I have no illusions about what it was that
our group accomplished in real terms. We
helped floor and paint a single house, be
longing to a (i2 year-old woman and her dis
abled son.That house is but one of hundreds
of thousands of unrepaired homes in that
city.There is indeed a strong case to be made
that the money spent sending me and my
classmates on this trip could have been bet
ter spent on hiring trained laborers to do the
work more efficiently and at a lower cost.
Hie only possible way that our giving ol
time and energy on this ASB trip will have
been as worthwhile as a simple donation is il
those of us who have been to New Orleans,
and who have born witness to the suffering
there the suffering the rest of America
has pushed to the back of our minds, choos
ing instead to look after our life ol conven
ience rather than our country give that
suffering new light, so that others may be in
spired to bear witness anew and give ol
themselves. It is this love ol our citizens that
will allow the people, and city, ol New Or
leans to recover.
