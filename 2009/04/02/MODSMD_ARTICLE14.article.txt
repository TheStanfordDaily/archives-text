## Nicole Demby My sweaty first time 
### 
I felt m\ hands getting clammy as I waited
for the Marguerite on Campus Drive. I
.started to feel the performance anxiety
welling up within me. Was it glaringly obvi
ous that this was going to he my first time?
Sorority girls who'd definitely done it their
first week of Stanford hiked out of the C'ow
ell Cluster. Phey looked freshly showered
and radiant. I het they did it this morning, I
thought. I looked down at m\ own revealing
attire. I was about to pop my Stanford gym
cherry.
As joggers walked by I became increas
ingly aware of the irony of my waiting to take
a two-minute bus ride to the gym. I could feel
passerby eyes moving from my athletic
shorts to my sneakers to the Marguerite stop
sign, their stares boring straight through my
athletic facade.
When I got off the shuttle by the Track
House. I stood perplexed for a minute. Sur
rounded by different athletic facilities. I real
ized I didn't actually know where the gym
was. I wisely decided to follow the girl in the
running shorts and Stanford sweatshirt, who
led me to more gym-shorted folk gathering
outside ol what 1 assumed was my destina
tion. Walking inside Arrillaga. I w as unsure of
how to proceed next. 1 handed my ID to the
boy behind the desk I le looked confused for
a moment, then smirked as the situation
dawned on him. "You're supposed to scan it
over there." he said, pointing to a little black
box on the desk I looked down at mv feet
and muttered thanks, knowing that he knew
Much to the surprise of those at Stanford
who know me. I was once an athletic person.
Starting with gymnastics. I moved on to bas
ketball. ultimate 1 risbee. soccer, volleyball
and e\en football during m\ pre-college life,
llien one day. I stopped moving. I made the
decision to give up team sports because of
other time commitments I was occupied with
other things that felt more important to me at
the time. Because the prospect of running on
a treadmill in a g\ m had always felt too much
like being a hamster on an exercise wheel,
and because I lacked the discipline for jog
ging, the end of my team sports career spelled
the end ol my career as an active person. At
lirst the change was simply pragmatic, but
soon I began to relish my new role as a I a/y
Person with a mildly unhealthy lifestyle. In
the morning I drank coffee, smoked and
scorned the bright vounc health\ people

I could feel passerby
eyes moving from
my athletic shorts to
my sneakers to the
Marguerite stop
sign...

heading to the nearest Crunch. Let the ple
beians toil away. 1 thought. I w;is concerned
with loftier matters.
While the athlete in me may have gone
into submission then, it always remained la
tent. waiting for those moments when it
could manifest itself through marathon
nights dancing at clubs, or could show off dur
ing a casual Frisbee toss on the beach. After
years of denying any form of regular expres
sion. 1 decided, for a slew of complicated rea
sons, to go to my local YMCA while home in
Brooklyn over spring break. What I discov
ered surprised me. I actually enjoyed myself.
It felt great to move my body seriously again,
to pump some adrenalin through my limbs. I
exited back onto the street an hour later with
a layer of dried sweat on myself and the
spring of endorphins in my step.
Walking into the Stanford gym. I felt I had
entered a new realm of the healthfulness
stratosphere. In Brooklyn I would have been
surrounded b\ slightly tubby tattooed hip
stcr guys trying to make peace with their
bodies after their weekend hangovers, older
women who shopped at the Park Slope I ood
Co-op and twecner kids visiting from the
public school nearby. In Arrillaga I felt I'd
walked into some Grecian urn covered with

young sweaty nubile bodies running,
writhing, lifting and stretching. Maybe 1
was infected by the pheromones these kids
were secreting into the air. but 1 considered
for the first time that the Stanford exercise
culture I'd always sneered at was actually
founded on the simple logic 1 had been deny
ing: that it's not ideal to be a brain that simply
floats from class to class, that moving feels
good, that our bodies are meant to exert
themselves and that bodily health has a pro
found effect on one's mental health. 1 real
ized that part of my condescension, of my tr\
ing to convince myself that all gvm-goers
were superficial exercise bunnies, had come
from a deep-seeded guilt I felt for not exer
cising. I took a deep breath and inhaled this
strange new landscape. Exhaling. I entered
the throng and headed for the nearest open
Elliptical.
An hour and a Marguerite trip later. I
walked back into my co-op."Did you just ex
ercise?!" my friend asked me incredulously. I
gave her a sheepish smile and quietly admit
ted it had been mv first time.
