### ZOE LEAVITT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford men's crew jump-start
ed its spring season last weekend at
the seventh annual Pacific-10 chal
lenge. Two full days of rowing
brought both experience to the
younger Cardinal rowers and excit
ing results for the team.
A beautiful weekend aided the
600 student-athletes competing in the
San Francisco Bay on Mar. 2N and 29.
Teams from across the country at
tended.and the first 1500-meter races
of the spring gave teams a chance to
show off their power after the longer
endurance races of the fall.
The Stanford men's top eight
emerged undefeated from the week
end. after dominating four races
against four teams. The Cardinal
rowed for easy victories over UCLA
by 26.4 seconds. Southern California
by 36.1 seconds and UC-Davis by
16.3 seconds. The varsity men kept
up with the varsity women's eight,
who also left the regatta undefeated.
"[These teams] are where our
program was five years ago." said
I lead Coach Craig Amerkhanian. of
the three California schools. "They
are developing teams with great
pride."
Northeastern, however, has beat
en Stanford rowing several times in
the past, so the Cardinal's win by 5.5
seconds last weekend brought a
greater surprise. Amerkhanian
called the race a "quality win" and
hoped that the improvement bodes
well for the rest of the season.
The second men's varsity eight
also performed well in its races, walk
ing away with two strong victories.
The team rowed a 5:58.1 to beat
Gonzaga by 20.3 seconds and UC-
Davis by 23.4 seconds.
The men's freshman team proved
its sprinting ability for the first time
in the spring season, showing it can
bolster the rest of the team. After a
slow start, the team opened up and
let its skills shine. The first race
proved difficult for the Cardinal
freshmen, and they narrowly fell to
Orange Coast College, finishing in
6:03.6 to the Pirates' 6:01.7.The Stan
ford team solidified its performance
in the following races. After falling
behind at the start. Stanford surged
to take back Gonzaga's lead and
earn a close 3.7-second win. Thev

also blew past DSC by 32.3 seconds.
Since the Cardinal boasts a rela
tively young team this season, the
freshmen clearly represent the fu
ture of the squad.
"The freshmen will grow and gain
speed throughout the season."
Amerkhanian said. "We are a very
young team. Our varsity raced with
five sophomores."
After a long season of winter train
ing, the team's first spring race served
as an indicator of the Cardinal's im
provement since the fall, and of the
rough edges that need smoothing.
"We are still searching out for
consistent rhythm." Amerkhanian
noted."[The team) will learn and im
prove each race."
Next weekend will offer plenty
more opportunity for improvement,

"We race all the national champi

Wisconsin," Amerkhanian said.
"[Then] we race Wisconsin on April
