at USC. Barte and Nguyen were the
only bright spots in the match for
Stanford, as each won in straight sets
on the first and third courts, respec
tively. The Trojans had just enough to
beat the Cardinal, though, as both Li
and freshman Logan Hansen lost in
three sets on the fourth and sixth
courts.

match win streak over USC, and it
was the Cardinal's first loss of the
