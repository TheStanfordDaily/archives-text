In the world of Kentucky bas
ketball. 22 wins are as satisfying
as an Ashlee Simpson concert.
By now. most of us have heard of
the Wildcats' decision to make
John C'alipari. the former leader of
the Memphis basketball program,
their new head coach. On the sur
face. this move would appear to al
leviate the dying animal that is
Wildcat basketball.
Calipari had tremendous sue
cess at the helm ol the Memphis
basketball program, taking the
rather unknown Tigers and turning
them into a perennial powerhouse.
I lis list ol credentials is flawless.
At Memphis, he was able to bal
ance hair styling with top-notch re
cruiting. During his reign, lie was
able to steal elite talent from major
programs, landing such stars as
Darius Washington Jr.. Derrick
Rose, and lyreke I \ans. ( alipari
posted an unprecedented nine con
seeutive 20-win seasons, and this
year, became the Inst coach in
NCAA history to post loin consec
utive 30-win seasons.
The guy was royalty in Mem
phis. with popularity rivaling that
of country music and Al (lore. Yet
he still made the decision to leave
his love child for a program devoid
of a soul. Why?
Because the Kentucky Wildcats
paid our friend $35 million over
eight years.
With this contract. C'alipari
leapfrogged Hilly Donovan of
I lorida as the highest paid coach in
college basketball. It's hard to
blame the guy for leaving, lie was
struggling financially in Memphis,
barely clawing at the poverty line
during this economic crisis with a
measly salary of $2.35 million per


Zimmerman
Dishing the Rock
year. As fellow life superstar La
trell Sprewell is quoted as saying:
"I have a family to feed."
As hitter as I am now, I loved
Johnny. Until recently, he was the
only coach in recent memory to
avoid the corruption that is the ex
traterrestrial contract. He truly ap
peared to love and cherish the Uni
versity of Memphis; he was the up
and-coming Joe Paterno of our
generation, willing to sacrifice
heart, sweat and money in order to
maximize the potential of the bas
ketball program and the university.
However, he — like so many of
my favorite players and coaches of
all time — managed to prove me
wrong. And he. like those same
sports figures, is bound for a rude
awakening.
It is important to understand
how Calipari achieved success at
Memphis. He spent his time in the
Volunteer State splashing with
mediocre teams in the talent-de
prived waters of Conference USA.

His winning ways were largely fu
eled by the commitments of sever
al one-and-done phenoms, utilizing
Memphis as a platform to jump
into the NBA. Calipari knew that
the chances of Rose returning for
his sophomore year were compara
ble to the chances of Lil' Wayne
giving up cough syrup.
He now must take on the SEC,
which, although outrageously terri
ble this year, is sure to boast a high
er level of competition than Confer
ence USA. 1 le will also have to com
pete with other high-profile coaches
within the conference, like Dono
van. for the elite recruits. Sure, he'll
have a fair number of high school
seniors following him around like
Lorenz's geese, but he now lacks the
ability to promise these kids NCAA
Tournament appearances.
More importantly for Calipari is
the recognition of his new spot in
the basketball hierarchy. He is no
longer the Big Kahuna, chilling
with FedEx founder and CEO Fred
Smith, a notable Memphis booster
who desperately tried to retain the
coach. John now finds himself on a
very short leash.
Initially, the members of the
Wildcat communitv are likely to

embrace Calipari as they do with
all of their new coaching boy toys.
He will be considered a savior at
the welcome banquet, surrounded
by the standard smiles and cheers.
Lexington will probably throw a
parade, celebrating the reappear
ance of the Messiah.
Yet. it will only take as much as
a 22-win season for Calipari to
wake up from his fairy tale to real
ize that he's not in Memphis any
more. He is no longer in control of
his fate, like he was with the Tigers.
His wallet will be padded, but can it
cushion him from the verbal blows
of the Kentucky faithful? Can he
survive the national pressure at the
reigns of the winningest program in
NCAA history? Is $35 million
enough to support the necessities
of personal security and hair gel?
Only time will tell with John
Calipari. One thing that is certain is
that he just dumped the hottest girl
in school to get with the broad with
potential in five years. At least the
new girl has a rich father.

Zach Zimmerman wonders if John
Calipari will be able to lend him a few
bucks for a Caltrain ticket. Email him
