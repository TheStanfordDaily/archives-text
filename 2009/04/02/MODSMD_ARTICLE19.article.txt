In the world of Kentucky bas
ketball. 22 wins are as satisfying
as an Ashlee Simpson concert.
By now. most of us have heard of
the Wildcats' decision to make
John C'alipari. the former leader of
the Memphis basketball program,
their new head coach. On the sur
face. this move would appear to al
leviate the dying animal that is
Wildcat basketball.
Calipari had tremendous sue
cess at the helm ol the Memphis
basketball program, taking the
rather unknown Tigers and turning
them into a perennial powerhouse.
I lis list ol credentials is flawless.
At Memphis, he was able to bal
ance hair styling with top-notch re
cruiting. During his reign, lie was
able to steal elite talent from major
programs, landing such stars as
Darius Washington Jr.. Derrick
Rose, and lyreke I \ans. ( alipari
posted an unprecedented nine con
seeutive 20-win seasons, and this
year, became the Inst coach in
NCAA history to post loin consec
utive 30-win seasons.
The guy was royalty in Mem
phis. with popularity rivaling that
of country music and Al (lore. Yet
he still made the decision to leave
his love child for a program devoid
of a soul. Why?
Because the Kentucky Wildcats
paid our friend $35 million over
eight years.
With this contract. C'alipari
leapfrogged Hilly Donovan of
I lorida as the highest paid coach in
college basketball. It's hard to
blame the guy for leaving, lie was
struggling financially in Memphis,
barely clawing at the poverty line
during this economic crisis with a
measly salary of $2.35 million per
