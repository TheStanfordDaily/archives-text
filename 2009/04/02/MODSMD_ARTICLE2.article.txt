# Admit rate sinks to 7.6 percent
## Dotal applications break into 30,000 range for the first time in history

In Stanford's most competitive round
of admissions ever. 2,300 of this year's
30,428 applicants were accepted â€” the 7.6
percent admit rate is a record low.
The Office of Undergraduate
Admission predicted roughly 25,000
incoming applications for this year, only
to face 20 percent more than anticipated

with a record-setting surge of applicants
that broke into the 30,000's for the first
time. This number reflects a significant
jump from the 25.299 undergraduate
applications received in 2008, when the
admit rate was 9.48 percent.
The rush of applicants to the
University occurred in the midst of a
recession that has not been kind to higher
education. Columbia and the University
of Pennsylvania saw their admit rates stav

almost the same, and Princeton actually
increased its admit rate by .5 percent.
Both Harvard (at seven percent) and Yale
(at 7.5 percent) remain slightly more
selective than Stanford.
"It's impossible to determine the root
of the.surge in applicants this year," said
Director of Admission Shawn Abbott.
"We certainly believe a volatile economy
had something to do with the increase, but
it is premature to speculate much more

than that. We do think our outreach pro
grams and new financial aid policy fueled
the interest."
Stanford's new financial aid policy
reaches out to low- to middle-income
families, making the University much
more affordable to students than in past
years and in comparison to many other
top schools. Families with an income less
