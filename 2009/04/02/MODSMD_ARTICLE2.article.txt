# Admit rate sinks to 7.6 percent
## Dotal applications break into 30,000 range for the first time in history 
### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
In Stanford's most competitive round
of admissions ever. 2,300 of this year's
30,428 applicants were accepted â€” the 7.6
percent admit rate is a record low.
The Office of Undergraduate
Admission predicted roughly 25,000
incoming applications for this year, only
to face 20 percent more than anticipated

with a record-setting surge of applicants
that broke into the 30,000's for the first
time. This number reflects a significant
jump from the 25.299 undergraduate
applications received in 2008, when the
admit rate was 9.48 percent.
The rush of applicants to the
University occurred in the midst of a
recession that has not been kind to higher
education. Columbia and the University
of Pennsylvania saw their admit rates stav

almost the same, and Princeton actually
increased its admit rate by .5 percent.
Both Harvard (at seven percent) and Yale
(at 7.5 percent) remain slightly more
selective than Stanford.
"It's impossible to determine the root
of the.surge in applicants this year," said
Director of Admission Shawn Abbott.
"We certainly believe a volatile economy
had something to do with the increase, but
it is premature to speculate much more

than that. We do think our outreach pro
grams and new financial aid policy fueled
the interest."
Stanford's new financial aid policy
reaches out to low- to middle-income
families, making the University much
more affordable to students than in past
years and in comparison to many other
top schools. Families with an income less

than $100.(XX) are exempt from
tuition, while those under $60,000
pay neither tuition nor room and
board.
Stanford hopefuls didn't just
have to combat a much larger appli
cant pool, though: due to a severe
housing crunch, fewer students were
admitted than in past years.
"We admitted 100 fewer students
than last year." Abbott said. "2.300
students were admitted to the Class
of 2013. We acted more conserva
tively in making our admission deci
sions this year, to avoid having a
larger-than-expected freshman
class, which is targeted to be 1.700."
High school students with their
sights set on Stanford definitely felt
the pressure this year.
"I knew it was going to be diffi
cult. but 1 didn't know it was going
to be this difficult." said Parkrose
High School senior Carmen Avram
from Portland. Ore. Avram was one

of the 689 candidates accepted in
December through Stanford's
Restrictive Early Action program.
"The reality is that admission to
Stanford is more competitive than
ever before." Abbot said. ' While
many will perceive a record number
of applications and a record-break
ing low admit rate as wonderful
news, it does mean that we disap
pointed more than nine out of 10
students who applied for admis
sion."
"That's hard news to swallow for
lots of deserving students, their fam
ilies and their counselors." he
added.
W hen asked if a similar jump in
applicants was predicted for next
year. Abbott said that it was too pre
mature to speculate at the moment.
Accepted students have until
May 1 to respond to the Office of
Undergraduate Admission and
finalize their decisions. All admit
ted students have been invited to
campus for Admit Weekend April
23-25.
