and parried its way to a ninth-place finish over four days
of competition against 25 of the nation's best teams. Stan

which won the title on its home turf.
Although the Cardinal was hot coming into NCAAs.
having won the West Regional two weeks beforehand, it
ran into national powerhouses such as the Nittany Lions.
Notre Dame and Ohio State, all of which claimed the top
spots at the Championship.
"We've done better in the past, but it was a tough com
petition this year," said sophomore Kersten Schnurle.
Indeed,the Cardinal had a taste of all three squads ear
lier this season, as it was downed by each school
ranked Nos. 1.2 and 3 in the country at the time — at the
Mid West Invitational.

"It was a tough
competition this year"

Still, the Cardinal was able to find both individual and
team success. The N( AAs were broken into six categories
saber, epee and foil with events for men and women.
Sophomore I.ucas Janson helped lead Stanford early in
the championships, utilizing his saber to take ninth place
in the men's side of the event — a six-spot improvement
from last season. I le totaled 14 wins and a 60.9 winning
percentage, the onl\ ('ardinal to emerge victorious in the
majority of their matches.
Janson's ninth-place finish was the highest of any Stan
ford fencer, a far cry from the West Regional, when the
Cardinal had a top finisher in five of the six events to earn
automatic bids into the N( 'A As. even against teams such
as UC-San Diego and Air Force, who also made the na
tional tournament.
"Lucas certainly did well." Schnurle said." I he men in
general were pretty strong, though not their strongest."
Janson and classmate Max Murphy earned All Ameri
cam honors for their performances. Murphy's 11 wins
helped him place 12tIi in the men's saber event. Rounding
out the men's side were senior Clayton Kenney and fresh
man Kevin Mo in epee — they placed 16th and 17th. re
spectively. Sophomore Alex Khoshnevissan was the last
men's competitor to place, taking 16th in foil.
Three women competed on the female side of the vent,
with one fencer in each category. Senior captain I va Jelli

son. who was named an All American in each of her first
three years on the team, came ever so close to picking up
her fourth such honor, hut came just short, finishing 15th
in saber with nine wins in the NCAAs.
Schnurle placed 22nd in epee. and she was optimistic
about how the experience would affect her in the future.
"I or my first NCAA Nationals, it was a satisfactory
performance." she said."lt made me realize that I need to
work on my sports psychology a bit,especially because the
venue and competition are rather intimidating.but I'm in

dined to think that next year will show great improve
ment."
The women's side was wrapped up by junior Jessica
Wacker, who took 22nd in the foil competition.
Hie eight participating Stanford fencers were one
more than last season, when the ( ardinal sent seven to the
NC 'AAs and placed eighth.
Despite the lower finish this year. Schnurle felt the
team was "well prepared" foi its competition and that
they met their season expectations.

Iliat said, she allowed room for improvement for the
2009-2010 season.
"1 think we're going to be very strong next year, despite
the fact that we're losing our seniors." Schnurle said
"We've got good recruits and enthusiastic upperclassmen
I know that I personally am motivated to iron out m\
fencing for next year's competition, and I think everyone
else is. teio."
