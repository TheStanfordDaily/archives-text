## WITH THE Cardinal Stanford football's search for an iron boot attracts eager students to tryouts 
### JOSH ALVAREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Coach D..1. Durkin held the foot
ball up. I'll ere was a slight breeze flut
tering across the goal posts. A trainer
stood behind the end /one ready to
snag incoming balls. I lie practice
fields were vacant, the sun felt unsea
sonably hot. Stanford football's spe
cial teams coordinator had a clip
board with notes on the potential
walk-ons' performance.
"Whenever you're ready." Durkin
said.
This wasn't the first time Stanford
football had turned to the student
body to fill a position especially
for the kicker spot. Derek Belch
walked tin in 2003 and earned his var
sitv letter in 2006 as the kickolf spe
cialist lie later took over as the
lull time kiekei in 2007. Aaron /ago
ry walked on in 2004 and was the
starting place kicker in 2006 and
200 N.
"This wasn't a matter of'we don't
have kickers. " Durkin said ol the
Cardinal's tryouts on March 7. "We
have three vers capable guvs that can
do the job. We were looking for some
body who could bring something to
the team that we didn't have already.
" I he kicking team has a very com
petitive environment." he continued.
"I very thing is graded and posted.
When we sat with the [current kick
ers| and told them that we were going
to look lor somebody to take their
jobs, it wasn't anything new to them.
I hey laughed and told me to bring
on the competition.'"
Ultimately, four students, includ
ing this writer, tried out. But before
any of us could start swinging at
pigskin, we faced a long, arduous
journey of paperwork and bureau

cracy. 1 "lie paper trail began with the
electronic Pre-Participation Evalua
tion (e-PPE) form, an Internet
based, comprehensive and detailed
risk-assessment questionnaire that
all student-athletes complete in ad
vance ol their physical examinations.
ITie form includes personal profile
information, past medical problems,
injuries, family health history, med
ications. allergies and eating habits.
The catch, though, is that the
length of the form depends on the an
swers given. If you have ever injured
your arm. for example, an entire sec
tion of follow-up questions like
"When did the injury occur?" and
"Are you back to 100 percent?" pops
up. ()n average.it takes3o-40 minutes
to complete the e-PPI Ihe complet
ed and printed e PPI divides itself
into four forms. Besides the e-PPI . a
packet filled mostly with NCAA
"Catch-22 policy agreements" (in
which the student-athlete provides a
signature agreeing with a policy il
von don't sign, you can't play) like
consent to random drug tests and
other not-so-obvious forms that, for
example, ask for your consent to be in
pictures used for advertisements.
Once all this is done, the prospec
tive walk-on has to set an appoint
ment for a physical examination with
the Sports Medicine office located in
the Arrillaga Sports and Recreation
Building. After the physical, the doc
tor signs a form that must then be
taken to the ("ompliancc (>ll ice in the
Arrillaga family Center, where a
final signature is obtained.

have .ill the paperwork." said sopho

The Stanford football team held open tryouts for a kick off specialist for next season. Despite the efforts of four Stan
ford students, the team foiled to find a sufficient addition. The Cardinal will look to improve upon a 5-7 record.
