## WITH THE Cardinal Stanford football's search for an iron boot attracts eager students to tryouts 
### JOSH ALVAREZ CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Coach D..1. Durkin held the foot
ball up. I'll ere was a slight breeze flut
tering across the goal posts. A trainer
stood behind the end /one ready to
snag incoming balls. I lie practice
fields were vacant, the sun felt unsea
sonably hot. Stanford football's spe
cial teams coordinator had a clip
board with notes on the potential
walk-ons' performance.
"Whenever you're ready." Durkin
said.
This wasn't the first time Stanford
football had turned to the student
body to fill a position especially
for the kicker spot. Derek Belch
walked tin in 2003 and earned his var
sitv letter in 2006 as the kickolf spe
cialist lie later took over as the
lull time kiekei in 2007. Aaron /ago
ry walked on in 2004 and was the
starting place kicker in 2006 and
200 N.
"This wasn't a matter of'we don't
have kickers. " Durkin said ol the
Cardinal's tryouts on March 7. "We
have three vers capable guvs that can
do the job. We were looking for some
body who could bring something to
the team that we didn't have already.
" I he kicking team has a very com
petitive environment." he continued.
"I very thing is graded and posted.
When we sat with the [current kick
ers| and told them that we were going
to look lor somebody to take their
jobs, it wasn't anything new to them.
I hey laughed and told me to bring
on the competition.'"
Ultimately, four students, includ
ing this writer, tried out. But before
any of us could start swinging at
pigskin, we faced a long, arduous
journey of paperwork and bureau

cracy. 1 "lie paper trail began with the
electronic Pre-Participation Evalua
tion (e-PPE) form, an Internet
based, comprehensive and detailed
risk-assessment questionnaire that
all student-athletes complete in ad
vance ol their physical examinations.
ITie form includes personal profile
information, past medical problems,
injuries, family health history, med
ications. allergies and eating habits.
The catch, though, is that the
length of the form depends on the an
swers given. If you have ever injured
your arm. for example, an entire sec
tion of follow-up questions like
"When did the injury occur?" and
"Are you back to 100 percent?" pops
up. ()n average.it takes3o-40 minutes
to complete the e-PPI Ihe complet
ed and printed e PPI divides itself
into four forms. Besides the e-PPI . a
packet filled mostly with NCAA
"Catch-22 policy agreements" (in
which the student-athlete provides a
signature agreeing with a policy il
von don't sign, you can't play) like
consent to random drug tests and
other not-so-obvious forms that, for
example, ask for your consent to be in
pictures used for advertisements.
Once all this is done, the prospec
tive walk-on has to set an appoint
ment for a physical examination with
the Sports Medicine office located in
the Arrillaga Sports and Recreation
Building. After the physical, the doc
tor signs a form that must then be
taken to the ("ompliancc (>ll ice in the
Arrillaga family Center, where a
final signature is obtained.
"I thought it was a good step to
have .ill the paperwork." said sopho
more I'revor Stevens, one ol the tr\
out participants. "It weeded out the

guys who weren't serious about try
ing out."
"1 wondered why we needed a
physical." said freshman Jack Jor
gensen. another participant. "The
process was a little excessive, but
then again, trying out for Stanford
football isn't an everyday thing."
In fact, football wasn't an every
day thing for any of the aspiring Car
dinal kickers. All of the participants
were former or current soccer play
ers.
The tryout took place March 7 at
2 p.m. (my tryout was at 9:30 a.m.
due to a scheduling conflict). It
began with a 20-minute warm-up
led by a trainer. Then, a large por
tion of the coaching staff came out.
Cameras were set up to film the
form of the participants, but those
weren't the only cameras operating
â€” a local television station crew
showed up and filmed the event.

The first challenge was field-goal
proficiency. Participants attempted
field goals from varying distances
and angles ranging from 15 to 30
yards and from the left to right hash
marks. This mostly served as a
warm-up for the real purpose of the
tryout: the kickoff. Hv this time,soc
cer players were observing from the
fence, and some football players re
turning from practice stood by to
watch.
"The criteria we were looking for
was a hang-time of at least four sec
onds and the ball landing beyond the
10-yard line," Durkin said. "We tried
to make it as laid back as possible."
"It wasn't competitive,but we still
tried our best." Stevens said.
Nonetheless.the environment did
have an effect on some of the partici
pants.
"I didn't go in with too many ex
pectations," Jorgensen said. "The
presence of the coaches and the cam
eras was kind of intimidating, and the
amount of people present was unex
pected. In the end. it was fun. 1 didn't
do as well as I had hoped.The kicks
went pretty far. but they were mostly

line drives."
"I did alright," Stevens said."l was
getting the hall up for like 3.4-3.6 sec
onds. It was landing around the 10-20
yard lines."
"There wasn't anyone who could
provide more than what we have."
Durkin said. Despite this, the tryout
was.in Durkinswords."asuccess."
"We had great participation, [hut]
the measuring stick was higher than
what any of the participants have had
to match up against," he said. "Just
goes to show that kicking a football
isn't all that easy.
"We are going to keep working
with our guys." Durkin continued.
"There are four guys competing for
the kickoff job. They have Division-I
talent,and i expect great things from
them in the future."
So how did this writer fair in the
tryout? 1 did not make the team. But
in the end, I was quite content with
myself after taking the ball from
Durkin's hands and sending it 30
yards through the uprights.

ing out."
"1 wondered why we needed a
physical." said freshman Jack Jor
gensen. another participant. "The
process was a little excessive, but
then again, trying out for Stanford
football isn't an everyday thing."
In fact, football wasn't an every
day thing for any of the aspiring Car
dinal kickers. All of the participants
were former or current soccer play
ers.
The tryout took place March 7 at
2 p.m. (my tryout was at 9:30 a.m.
due to a scheduling conflict). It
began with a 20-minute warm-up
led by a trainer. Then, a large por
tion of the coaching staff came out.
Cameras were set up to film the
form of the participants, but those
weren't the only cameras operating
â€” a local television station crew
showed up and filmed the event.

The first challenge was field-goal
proficiency. Participants attempted
field goals from varying distances
and angles ranging from 15 to 30
yards and from the left to right hash
marks. This mostly served as a
warm-up for the real purpose of the
tryout: the kickoff. Hv this time,soc
cer players were observing from the
fence, and some football players re
turning from practice stood by to
watch.
"The criteria we were looking for
was a hang-time of at least four sec
onds and the ball landing beyond the
10-yard line," Durkin said. "We tried
to make it as laid back as possible."
"It wasn't competitive,but we still
tried our best." Stevens said.
Nonetheless.the environment did
have an effect on some of the partici
pants.
"I didn't go in with too many ex
pectations," Jorgensen said. "The
presence of the coaches and the cam
eras was kind of intimidating, and the
amount of people present was unex
pected. In the end. it was fun. 1 didn't
do as well as I had hoped.The kicks
went pretty far. but they were mostly

line drives."
"I did alright," Stevens said."l was
getting the hall up for like 3.4-3.6 sec
onds. It was landing around the 10-20
yard lines."
"There wasn't anyone who could
provide more than what we have."
Durkin said. Despite this, the tryout
was.in Durkinswords."asuccess."
"We had great participation, [hut]
the measuring stick was higher than
what any of the participants have had
to match up against," he said. "Just
goes to show that kicking a football
isn't all that easy.
"We are going to keep working
with our guys." Durkin continued.
"There are four guys competing for
the kickoff job. They have Division-I
talent,and i expect great things from
them in the future."
So how did this writer fair in the
tryout? 1 did not make the team. But
in the end, I was quite content with
myself after taking the ball from
Durkin's hands and sending it 30
yards through the uprights.
