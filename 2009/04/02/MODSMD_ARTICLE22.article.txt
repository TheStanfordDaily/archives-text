## Ladies ready for UConn 
### GREG BEACHAM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Jayne Appcl rolled past the euca
lyptus trees and up to Maples Pavil
ion on her shiny red bicycle,reclining
her 6-foot-4 frame in the seat. The
Stanford center wore a T-shirt with
three huge words on the chest:
"'Biggest. Upset. Ever."
The shirt is a souvenir of Stan
ford's astonishing football victory
over USC in 2007. but it's no stretch
to see its significance in Appel's next
endeavor with her Cardinal team
mates: They're headed to the Final
Four in St. Louis this weekend to face
mighty Connecticut, which is prohib
itively favored to cap its undefeated
season with an NCAA title.
Appel scored a school-record 46
points in the Cardinal's 20th straight
victory on Monday, yet Stanford* (33-
4) knows it's just as much of an un
derdog as anybody who tangles with
the physically fearsome, high-scor
ing. media-darling Huskies (37-0),
who haven't even allowed an oppo
nent to finish within 10 points of
them.
"But last year,they were the team
that was supposed to win it as well."
Appel recalled. "As (coach) Tara
(VanDerveer) says, that's why we
play the games."
After surviving a rugged Berke
ley Regional to reach back-to-back
Final Fours for the first time this
decade, the Cardinal seem pretty
much finished feeling pressure for
the year. They're enjoying a few re
laxing days on their idyllic campus
before heading off to a game in
which the Huskies will shoul

der all the expectations.
What's more. Stanford is still the
last team to beat UConn. winning
82-73 in the semifinals at last sea
son's Final Four. If anybody can top
ple the Huskies, why shouldn't it be
the calm, tournament-tested Cardi
nal?
"We ended their season last year,
so they're highly motivated to play
us." senior Jillian Harmon said."You
can tell. They've been talking about
us for a few weeks now ... We have
to play well, (but) we don't have to
play a perfect game. We didn't play
the perfect game last year, and it'll
probably be a little tougher this year,
but we'll have a chance."
Stanford finished the regular sea
son ranked No. 2 behind UConn
after winning the Pac-10 regular-sea
son and tournament titles, yet the
Cardinal received only a second seed
in the NCAA tournament. Van-
Derveer has become resigned to
such slights for West Coast teams
over her wildly successful quarter
centurv at Stanford, but she realizes
UConn's unbeaten run deserves
much — if not quite all — of the
hype it's getting.
"They have great TV coverage.
ITiey have great media coverage.
They travel, like. 60 reporters," Van-
Derveer said with a grin. "Let's just
play the game, and we just have to
play well. I don't want to get caught
up in all the hyperbole of it. That's
part of the excitement. Roll the ball
out there, and let's see what we've
got."
Although VanDerveer and
UConn coach Cieno Auriemma have
been in their share of disagreements

over the years while competing for ti
tles and recruits on opposite coasts,
she admiringly refers to Auriemma
as "the kid in school that will get in a
fight with everybody, but you like
him."
That doesn't mean Stanford isn't
working furiously on a way to stop
UConn's powerful lineup, which
doesn't go terribly deep, but doesn't
need to. VanDerveer speet Wednes
day morning on the phone with Ari
zona State coach Charli Turner
Thorne, who gave her former coach a
full page of notes on ways to slow
down the Huskies, just as the Sun
Devils did for part of their regional
final loss on Tuesday night.
"I'd rather prepare for Connecti
cut with five days than with one."
VanDerveer said when asked if she's
disappointed the showdown won't
decide the title. "Of all the three
teams (including Louisville and Ok
lahoma). I'd most like to have five
days to prepare for Connecticut."
But thanks to last year. Stanford
doesn't need to be convinced it can
beat the Huskies. Although star Can
dice Wiggins graduated. Appel. Har
mon and sophomore starters
Jeanette Pohlen and Kayla Pedersen
were part of last season's team, which
knocked off UConn in Tampa before
losing the title game to Tennessee.
"The whole weekend is a whirl
wind." Harmon said. "I think the
most nervous I. was, was before the
first practice, when you had 2().(XX)
people watching you . . . Even
though we were kind of awe-struck,
we settled down and concentrated
on our first game. We just have to do
that again."
