## GSC discusses elections Debate continues over newly formed services division 
### DANIEL BUI STAFF WRITER 
Last night, the Graduate Student
Council (GSC) discussed legislation
for the upcoming election and housing
information for graduate students.
ASSU Vice President Pagan Harris
'09 announced the ongoing progress in
another version of a bill designed to
establish caps on campaigns for stu
dent elections. With a number of slates
for ASSU already agreeing to a self
imposed cap of $2,000 for this year's
campaigns, Harris is optimistic about
the future of caps for election cam
paigns.
"We've covered our bases for this
year, and we'll be working on legisla
tion for next year," Harris said.
I larris also highlighted the Stanford
Service Summit, an event that will be
held this Saturday, allowing faculty,
students and other members of the
Stanford community to voice their
opinions on the future of public service
at the University.
" Hiis will be constructing a vision
for Stanford public service for the next
10 years, and it's something that we're
excited about," I larris said.
In his ASSU Senate report. Harris
addressed the concerns voiced in the
recent Undergraduate Senate meeting
regarding the graduate student role in
funding the newly formed Student
Services Division (SSD). SSI) is a new
body under the ASSU that is designed
to organize a variety of resources for
the use of both undergraduate and
graduate students.
Harris noted the importance of
allowing the SSD to benefit the entire
Stanford student community, stating
that the "operational of the ASSU
should benefit all students."
A number of undergraduate sena
tors worried about the possibility that
graduate students might not pay for a
proportional amount of costs for their
use of the programs. While recognizing
their concerns, Harris did not believe
that the issue of funding should be a
major hindrance in providing the
resources to everyone.
"[Solving the funding issue] is not
yet feasible," Harris added. "We'll have
to talk about funding that program
down the line on a more case-by-case
basis. I think that's a much more rea
sonable solution at this point in time."
The GSC also discussed issues with
student housing for upcoming quar
ters.
"We scheduled a meeting with
housing, and they clarified some
things." assured Nanna Nottholl, a
first-year graduate student in psy
chology.
