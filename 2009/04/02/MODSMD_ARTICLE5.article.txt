## VPSA unveils overall cuts Boardman announces $3 million In budget cuts: 11 staff members laid off 
### RYAN MAC DESK EDITOR 
The Office of the Vice Provost for Student Affairs
(VPSA) announced yesterday that it will slash
approximately $3 million from its budget next fiscal
year, as part of the University's $100 million budget
cut for 2010. Included among the cuts. 11 staff mem
bers have already been laid off. with a few planning to
continue until the end of the school year.
Community center budgets, which have drawn sig
nificant attention from students, were cut on a case
bv-case basis. According to Vice Provost Greg
Boardman. percentage changes in funding varied
among the centers.
"This was something we've been looking at for the
past several months in the growing economic crisis."
Boardman said. "Initially we were looking at up to
about a 10 percent cut over the next two fiscal years,
but then that changed to 15 percent for fiscal years
2010 and 2011. In March, we got the word that we
were looking at close to 15 percent to take place in fis
cal year 2010."
Part of the cuts will include a number of layoffs
within the VPSA
"Last week, those Student Affairs staff that had
been laid off were informed." Boardman said. "We
had 11 staff within the VPSA organization that have
been laid off as part of this process. There are 230 staff
in VPSA."
According to Boardman, these layoffs, which
reflect a less than five percent decrease in workers
under VPSA. were minimized to reduce the impact to
students and student life on campus.
The \'ice Provost also mentioned
that while the final decisions on the
budget were his own. each decision
was the result of considerate delib
eration since October. Among his
efforts to better gauge the situation.
Boardman took into consideration a
number of views. meeting with stu
dent groups who requested his
attention and developing a constant
dialogue with the ASSI and its
executives.
Boardman went on to cite that
those programs which are consid
ered core entities were shielded as
best as possible from change.
"Our guiding priorities in mov
ing forward with these decisions
were health and wellbeing. academ
ic success or achievement, risk man
agement and compliance man
dates." Boardman said.
Aside from the layoffs, a variety
of other measures are being taken
to reduce the budget, among them
pay cuts and a reduction in full-time
equivalency. For example, some
VPSA staff will now only be full
time during the 10-month academic
year and half-time during the two
summer months.
Around a quarter of the current
VPSA staff have been affected by
such changes.
For Associate Vice Provost and
Dean of Educational Resources
Sally Dickinson, the cuts for each
particular unit within the VPSA
were considered on three fronts.
"I think that our main approach
at looking at the entire VPSA budg
et is considering what are the core
services of the unit and how we

could cut in a wa\ that would not
drastically and negatively impact
our students." she said. "Our second
approach was considering what
would be the impact on staff No. 3.
we had to take into account the pop
ulations that each unit in VPSA
served."
While Boardman and his staff
thoroughly discussed the thought
process behind the reductions, they
were reluctant to divulge exact fig
ures. Instead, the Vice Provost
insisted that the budgets of each
individual VPSA unit, from the
Office of Student Activities to com
munity centers, should be consid
ered as contributing to some part of
the 15 percent reduction.
"We're looking at this as the
VPSA organization." Boardman
said. "Student affairs in the past has
given a lot of autonomy to its units,
and we're trying to centralize that.
Coming out publicly with who got
cut by what would put undue focus
and negativity on the process."
"Each unit director knows of
their own cuts." he added. "Some
units certainly had more than 15
percent and other had less. We
weren't going to do just across the
board 15 percent, that would have
been the easy way and we wanted to
do it strategically and more pur
posefully."
On the other hand, some units
under VPSA jurisdiction such as
Residential Education and the Haas
Center for Public Service, were rela
tively unaffected by the current
budget cuts. Boardman stated that
more time would be given to decide
on their financial futures, especially
in light of each unit having a recent
ly appointed director.
As for the community centers, a
topic that has caused quite a stir
among students, the VPSA was firm

in saying that there would be no
complete cuts of community cen
ters. However. Associate Vice
Provost Dickinson did mention that
each community center was consid
ered differently in making budget
reductions.
"We looked at each center, rec
ognizing that the size of the popula
tion that they serve is not the same."
she said. "We looked at very careful
ly and considered each mission of
centers. While there is some com
monality across the centers, some
have particular missions and focus
es. The staffing was also looked at.
Ultimately, it was what the impact of
w hat the cut would be on continuing
to provide excellent and thoughtful
services to the student body."
Given the financial situation.
ASSU President Jonny Dorsey *09
and Vice President Fagan Harris '09
believe that the V'PSA has done an
admirable job in considering stu
dent input for the new budget.
"We have the utmost respect for
Greg as he has done his best to lis
ten to the student input." said
Dorsey. who has maintained fre
quent communication with V'PSA.
"N ice Provost Boardman has been
very receptive to the ASSL' and has
worked very hard in developing a
fair budget."
As for the rest of the year.
Boardman hopes that students
won't have to feel an\ of the finan
cial pinch that has affected his
office.
"Students will not see a change
hopefulh for the rest of the year."
he said. "The overall impact should
have little direct impact on the qual
