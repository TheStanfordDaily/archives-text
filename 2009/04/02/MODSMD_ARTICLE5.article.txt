### RYAN MAC DESK EDITOR 
The Office of the Vice Provost for Student Affairs
(VPSA) announced yesterday that it will slash
approximately $3 million from its budget next fiscal
year, as part of the University's $100 million budget
cut for 2010. Included among the cuts. 11 staff mem
bers have already been laid off. with a few planning to
continue until the end of the school year.
Community center budgets, which have drawn sig
nificant attention from students, were cut on a case
bv-case basis. According to Vice Provost Greg
Boardman. percentage changes in funding varied
among the centers.
"This was something we've been looking at for the
past several months in the growing economic crisis."
Boardman said. "Initially we were looking at up to
about a 10 percent cut over the next two fiscal years,
but then that changed to 15 percent for fiscal years
2010 and 2011. In March, we got the word that we
were looking at close to 15 percent to take place in fis
cal year 2010."
Part of the cuts will include a number of layoffs
within the VPSA
"Last week, those Student Affairs staff that had
been laid off were informed." Boardman said. "We
had 11 staff within the VPSA organization that have
been laid off as part of this process. There are 230 staff
in VPSA."
According to Boardman, these layoffs, which
reflect a less than five percent decrease in workers
under VPSA. were minimized to reduce the impact to
students and student life on campus.
