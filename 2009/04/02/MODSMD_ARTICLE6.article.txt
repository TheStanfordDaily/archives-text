## S.F. mayor campaigns in Palo Alto Newsom amis to target youth through social networking 
### DEVIN BANERJEE DEPUTY EDITOR 
San Francisco Mayor Gavin
Nevvsom continued his statewide tour
of town halls Wednesday evening, dis
cussing a variety of state issues in a
packed Palo Alto I ligh School gymnasi
um. The mayor opened a gubernatorial
exploratory committee in July of last
year. 2N months ahead of the 2010 elec
tion that will replace incumbent
California Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger.
The audience was diverse — from
business suits to high school sweatshirts
as were the questions on the table,
which attendees submitted on index
cards. State health care, education and
water management dominated the
hour-long session, along with same-sex

marriage rights and the proposed high
speed rail system.
On education, Newsom emphasized
"our biggest strength has been human
capital." and committed himself to
expanding mandatory preschool educa
tion if elected governor. He noted his
commitment to the environment, citing
reductions in carbon dioxide emissions
in his city, and expressed concern about
softening of cap-and-trade regulation.
Newsom also pushed for universal
health care — a continuing light he is
leading in San Francisco — as well as
reform of the high-speed rail adminis
trative board to be more receptive to
public opinion.
While Newsom has become known
for hard-left stances — most notably
his forceful campaign against the recent
ban on same-sex marriage he contin
ually emphasized on Wednesday that
he is not strictly ideological, but instead
"open to evidence" that contradicts his
own beliefs.
"I don't want to cast aspersions on

people that disagree," Newsom said
specifically of the gav marriage debate.
"Good people disagree."
Asked after the event if he is con
cerned about the view that he is too lib
eral to he governor. Newsom shrugged
it off as a non-issue, instead touting to
The Daily his track record as mayor of
San Francisco over the past lour years.
Also in the running on the
Democratic side are Jerry Brown,
attorney general and former governor,
and Lieutenant Governor John
Garamendi, and potential entrants
include Senator Dianne Feinstein and
Los Angeles Mayor Antonio
Villaraigosa. A field poll released last
month put Feinstein in the lead with 38
percent support among Democratic
primary voters, followed by Brown and
Villaraigosa at 16 percent each.
Newsom followed with 10 percent sup
port.

strategy."

ultimately be person-to-person
offline tasks." said Byrd. w ho has not
