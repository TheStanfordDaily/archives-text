pins gleaming on his chest — and challenged
the silver-haired historian at the podium, a
former Stanford president now aged 85. to a
verbal joust.
I"he older man was Richard W. Lyman.
Slightly bent now. he once steered Stanford
through the tumultuous "60s and '70s. So this
was somewhat of a showdown.
The majority in the room at least half
expected this encounter, and they showed up
to the Stanford Historical Society's book talk
in droves.
The first few heartbeats passed in silence.
Then came chuckles of neutral amusement.
And finally the room reacted in full — the
groans of irritation, the few squeals of

approval, each a little
personal declaration of
sympathy for either the
stubborn administrator
or the student rebel,

visions, maybe — from
an unforgotten period
that polarized every

his recollection of those
chaotic times.
Fridii\. April 3 marks 40
years since the day 14
activist groups, com
prising 800 students,
gathered in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium and demand
ed an end to classified and
Vietnam- related
research at Stanford and
closer oversight of the
Stanford Research
Institute in Palo Alto.
That day yielded a name
to an entire movement
at Stanford whose first
collective action, the
nine-dav sit-in at the
Applied Electronics
Laboratory (A EL).

powerfully symbolized the high-water mark of
an era at this institution.
The peaceful occupation of AEL, the lab
which conducted classified research funded
by the Defense Department during the
Vietnam War. was the last major protest
before demonstrations took a violent turn.
On the final day of April 1969, students
who dubbed themselves the A3Mers (April
3 Movement members) seized Encina Hall,
prompting Lyman, as acting head of the
University, to call in police. Although the
sheriff's deputies encountered no violence,
that first incursion of police presence on
campus crossed a line that could never be
reversed. The University's internal antago
nism worsened dramatically.

It is difficult today to imagine how dire
campus unrest eventually became in the
early "70s. when running battles between
police and students, armed with teargas and
rocks, raged in the open yards of Wilbur and
Stern Halls. The President's office was
bombed in 1%.5. and at some points nearly
every window along the Quad was smashed
and permanently boarded up. There were
daily protests in White Plaza. Old Union was
gridlocked by sit-ins. Alumni donors called in
with concern and threats. Students yelled
insults at faculty and then went home to yell
at their successful, well-off parents whose
cold liberalism was deemed hypocritical.
In a recent interview. Lyman shared a
story of his son. who once told an undergrad
uate that he feared someone might shoot his
father one morning as he walked out of
Hoover House, the President's mansion.
According to Lyman, the student replied.
"Yeah, and I might be the one with the gun."
lu tin." two months since an excerpt of Lyman's

book appeared in
Stanford Magazine, the
University community
that experienced the
unrest in the mid-'6os
and "70s has revived a
firestorm of debate,
unmatched in recent
memory.
Kevin Cool, the
magazine's editor since
1999. remembered only
one issue that roused a
comparable reaction:
exactly seven years
prior, just months after
September 11. the mag
azine ran a story sug
gesting that Stanford
consider reinstating
ROTC on campus. The
program was shut
down by the Faculty
Senate in 1969. a year
after its building near
the football stadium
was torched twice by
antiwar protestors and
ultimately razed.
The thorny back
drop of the "60s quickly
overshadowed the
ROTC issue as discus
sion heated up. The
magazine never again
received such a frenzv

of letters, phone calls and emails, nostalgic or
raging or both, until this January, when
Lyman's perspective on campus turmoil in
the late 1960s struck that same, singularly
polarizing nerve among alumni.
Cool said he would set aside room in the
two subsequent issues, the March/April and
May/June issues, to run extensive letters to
the editor.
"That period still inspires such passion by
people who lived through it.and we knew
that excerpt and the book itself would gener
ate a reaction." Cool said in early March.
"That wasn't a surprise at all."
Hut Cool wasn't banking on his own role
being dragged into the crossfire. In inter
views. alumni and faculty have accused him

of poor editorial judgment, of offering an
unfairly favorable presentation of Lyman's
excerpt, of failing to grant protestors a fair
chance to voice their rebuttals — all this
atop criticism of Lyman's writing itself.
Lenny Siegel hasn't changed much from the
earnest, lower-middle class Jewish boy who
appeared in an obscure 1%9 documentary
filmed on campus by local public television
crews.
Siegel said he joined the movement after
he arrived to study physics and realized, as
did other students in technical fields, that his
career path after graduating would be chan
neled towards working for the government
at facilities like the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI), and hv association, the war
machine that ravaged Vietnam.
While ALL might have been memorable,
the Research Institute off Page Mill Road, a
government-funded lab that also conducted

classified research, was the main target for
students.
"I can't explain the level of violence here
except that the students identified Stanford,
and not without some truth, with the conduct
of the war." said Bob Rosenzweig. a top
University official loathed by radical stu
dents and one of Lyman's staunchest defend
ers at the time, in an interview with The
Daily "We were at the time one of the two or
three preeminent engineering and technolo
gy universities with a lot of defense depart
ment money and classified research. It was
n't unreasonable to make that identification
and maybe that produced greater frustration
and more violence."
Never blessed with great charisma,
Siegel was instead organized and cerebral,
planning demonstrations or dragging con
sensus meetings out of the usual quagmires
that plagued productivity. Siegel was never
the loudest, but he tried hardest to keep

things together.
Hut on May 16,1%9, Siegel did more than
just plan demonstrations. It is with great
pride and a wink that Siegel recounts the
May protest at the SRI labs on Hannover
Street, where a traffic blockade erected by
students was ultimately dispersed by teargas
and I'M/ policemen charging with batons.
Many activists — and Siegel's son. he noted
know the story of how he dramatically
picked up and hurled an.open teargas canis
ter 40 yards into an SKI window.
"Years of play ing football paid off." Siegel
said.
By forcing a lab that conducted Vietnam
related research to a halt by their mere pres
ence. Friedman argued, the students "were
harming the war machine." A famous San
Francisco ( hronicle columnist stopped by to
chat, and the students found and operated a
printing press in the basement of the build
ing to publish leaflets and daily reports that
they slipped under doors in every dorm
room.
During the period that peaked with the
All. sit-in, before the minority pro-violence
groups splintered and outshouted the major
ity. the movement enjoyed broad support
from the community. Women from Palo Alto
brought fresh laundry and food to AEL. and
students swept the floors and baked bread
on each of the nine days before heading ofl
to class.
"We were creating this alternate sort ol
reality." said Jean Friedman, who headed the
occupation as a political science graduate
student in 1% 1 ). "It was open. Campus police
could walk through, campus administration
could walk through, anybody could walk
through and talk on the microphone."
In many ways the movement was at its peak
when it was most articulate and thoughtful,
considering that there was a campus consen
sus that agreed with its general position on
the war.
To be sure, the majority of the faculty.
Lyman and most of his administration col
leagues. disagreed with U.S. involvement in
Vietnam — "I thought it was stupid," Lyman
said recently, in typically bullish fashion. But
the ideological conflicts of the '60s. for all
their roughness of expression, were often

GERRY SHIH/The Stanford Daily-
In the '60s and '70s, Lenny Siegel helped to organize antiwar student demostrations against the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), protesting
the lab's Vietnam-related research. During the May 1969 protest at the SRI labs, Siegel joined throngs of students in a traffic blockade that
was ultimately broken up by police teargas.
