the silver-haired historian at the podium, a
former Stanford president now aged 85. to a
verbal joust.
I"he older man was Richard W. Lyman.
Slightly bent now. he once steered Stanford
through the tumultuous "60s and '70s. So this
was somewhat of a showdown.
The majority in the room at least half
expected this encounter, and they showed up
to the Stanford Historical Society's book talk
in droves.
The first few heartbeats passed in silence.
Then came chuckles of neutral amusement.
And finally the room reacted in full — the
groans of irritation, the few squeals of

approval, each a little

stubborn administrator
or the student rebel,

gathered in Dinkelspiel

Vietnam- related
research at Stanford and

Stanford Research
Institute in Palo Alto.
That day yielded a name
to an entire movement
at Stanford whose first
collective action, the
nine-dav sit-in at the
Applied Electronics
Laboratory (A EL).

powerfully symbolized the high-water mark of
an era at this institution.
The peaceful occupation of AEL, the lab
which conducted classified research funded
by the Defense Department during the
Vietnam War. was the last major protest
before demonstrations took a violent turn.
On the final day of April 1969, students
who dubbed themselves the A3Mers (April
3 Movement members) seized Encina Hall,
prompting Lyman, as acting head of the
University, to call in police. Although the
sheriff's deputies encountered no violence,
that first incursion of police presence on
campus crossed a line that could never be
reversed. The University's internal antago
nism worsened dramatically.

It is difficult today to imagine how dire
campus unrest eventually became in the
early "70s. when running battles between
police and students, armed with teargas and
rocks, raged in the open yards of Wilbur and
Stern Halls. The President's office was
bombed in 1%.5. and at some points nearly
every window along the Quad was smashed
and permanently boarded up. There were
daily protests in White Plaza. Old Union was
gridlocked by sit-ins. Alumni donors called in
with concern and threats. Students yelled
insults at faculty and then went home to yell
at their successful, well-off parents whose
cold liberalism was deemed hypocritical.
In a recent interview. Lyman shared a
story of his son. who once told an undergrad
uate that he feared someone might shoot his
father one morning as he walked out of
Hoover House, the President's mansion.
According to Lyman, the student replied.
"Yeah, and I might be the one with the gun."
lu tin." two months since an excerpt of Lyman's

book appeared in
Stanford Magazine, the
University community
that experienced the
unrest in the mid-'6os
and "70s has revived a
firestorm of debate,
unmatched in recent
memory.
Kevin Cool, the
magazine's editor since
1999. remembered only
one issue that roused a
comparable reaction:
exactly seven years
prior, just months after
September 11. the mag
azine ran a story sug
gesting that Stanford
consider reinstating
ROTC on campus. The
program was shut
down by the Faculty
Senate in 1969. a year
after its building near
the football stadium
was torched twice by
antiwar protestors and
ultimately razed.
The thorny back
drop of the "60s quickly
overshadowed the
ROTC issue as discus
sion heated up. The
magazine never again
received such a frenzv

of letters, phone calls and emails, nostalgic or
raging or both, until this January, when
Lyman's perspective on campus turmoil in
the late 1960s struck that same, singularly
polarizing nerve among alumni.
Cool said he would set aside room in the
two subsequent issues, the March/April and
May/June issues, to run extensive letters to
the editor.
"That period still inspires such passion by
people who lived through it.and we knew
that excerpt and the book itself would gener
ate a reaction." Cool said in early March.
"That wasn't a surprise at all."
Hut Cool wasn't banking on his own role
being dragged into the crossfire. In inter
views. alumni and faculty have accused him

of poor editorial judgment, of offering an
unfairly favorable presentation of Lyman's
excerpt, of failing to grant protestors a fair
chance to voice their rebuttals — all this
atop criticism of Lyman's writing itself.
Lenny Siegel hasn't changed much from the
earnest, lower-middle class Jewish boy who
appeared in an obscure 1%9 documentary
filmed on campus by local public television
crews.
Siegel said he joined the movement after
he arrived to study physics and realized, as
did other students in technical fields, that his
career path after graduating would be chan
neled towards working for the government
at facilities like the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI), and hv association, the war
machine that ravaged Vietnam.
While ALL might have been memorable,
the Research Institute off Page Mill Road, a
government-funded lab that also conducted

classified research, was the main target for
students.
"I can't explain the level of violence here
except that the students identified Stanford,
and not without some truth, with the conduct
of the war." said Bob Rosenzweig. a top
University official loathed by radical stu
dents and one of Lyman's staunchest defend
ers at the time, in an interview with The
Daily "We were at the time one of the two or
three preeminent engineering and technolo
gy universities with a lot of defense depart
ment money and classified research. It was
n't unreasonable to make that identification
and maybe that produced greater frustration
and more violence."
Never blessed with great charisma,
Siegel was instead organized and cerebral,
planning demonstrations or dragging con
sensus meetings out of the usual quagmires
that plagued productivity. Siegel was never
the loudest, but he tried hardest to keep

things together.
Hut on May 16,1%9, Siegel did more than
just plan demonstrations. It is with great
pride and a wink that Siegel recounts the
May protest at the SRI labs on Hannover
Street, where a traffic blockade erected by
students was ultimately dispersed by teargas
and I'M/ policemen charging with batons.
Many activists — and Siegel's son. he noted
know the story of how he dramatically
picked up and hurled an.open teargas canis
ter 40 yards into an SKI window.
"Years of play ing football paid off." Siegel
said.

related research to a halt by their mere pres
ence. Friedman argued, the students "were
harming the war machine." A famous San
Francisco ( hronicle columnist stopped by to
chat, and the students found and operated a
printing press in the basement of the build
ing to publish leaflets and daily reports that
they slipped under doors in every dorm
room.
During the period that peaked with the
All. sit-in, before the minority pro-violence
groups splintered and outshouted the major
ity. the movement enjoyed broad support
from the community. Women from Palo Alto
brought fresh laundry and food to AEL. and
students swept the floors and baked bread
on each of the nine days before heading ofl
to class.
"We were creating this alternate sort ol
reality." said Jean Friedman, who headed the

student in 1% 1 ). "It was open. Campus police
could walk through, campus administration
could walk through, anybody could walk
through and talk on the microphone."
In many ways the movement was at its peak
when it was most articulate and thoughtful,
considering that there was a campus consen
sus that agreed with its general position on
the war.

pleted "Campus in Turmoil," a recollec
tion of the University's turbulent history in
the midst of student antiwar unrest in the
1960s and '70s.


GERRY SHIH/The Stanford Daily-
In the '60s and '70s, Lenny Siegel helped to organize antiwar student demostrations against the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), protesting
the lab's Vietnam-related research. During the May 1969 protest at the SRI labs, Siegel joined throngs of students in a traffic blockade that
was ultimately broken up by police teargas.

grounded in more sophisticated differences
than the dualisms that have come to charac
terize the post-1990s 1 "culture wars."
Antiwar groups tussled over the morality
of resisting the draft. Some activists pon
dered how to engage the civil rights issue
that swirled underfoot — many students
had wealthy families to return home to.
while poor blacks and whites had little
choice but to fight in Vietnam. Questions
emerged: Interrupt disagreeable faculty or
respect academic freedom'.' Pander to the
liberal center or rebel? Violence or non-vio
lence? Liberal democracy or socialism?
Even LSD couldn't guarantee the path to
discovering answers.
Ideological ferment raged along the full
spectrum of political thought. Faculty and
alumni alike retell the story of a nervy meet
ing during the spring of 1969 when students
demanded that the Board of Trustees
demonstrate that they were not "out of
touch" by confessing their own political
views. A prominent trustee — possibly
William Hewlett himself — stood up and
pointed out the Democratic or Republican
affiliation of each trustee around the table as
if to show bipartisanship.
Point proven. The students were exasper
ated.
"The board just didn't get it," recalled
Barton Bernstein, a professor of history. "To
only consider Democrat or Republican was
such a narrow understanding of politics. The
'60s offered a different conception; it offered
a different worldview."
And this troubled parents greatly.
Born to a family of activists in Los
Angeles. Siegel arrived at the Farm in 1966
poorer than many of the student activists
he fell in with. They included sons and
daughters with names like Katzenbach and
Rusk and Rockefeller, great families that
recognized Stanford's ascendency in the
West, but failed to understand why their
children despised them so when they
returned home.
Movement leaders relished their influence
over so many members from distinguished
families who would become "the very top
leaders of society." In November 1968, The
Daily published a telling profile of the
Stanford branch of the Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS). noting, "Hal
I lamilton. a junior and leader in SDS believes
'Stanford is a ruling class school. We've got
the big targets here,' Hamilton told the Daily
reporter, 'not only in University associations
but in the student bodv.'"

Concerns iihout Stanford's public prestige,
institutional inteeritv and trustee relations

during the tumult linger prominently in
Lyman's book, written almost 30 years after
he stepped out of an administrative role. His
critics say he misses the point, that his
account is ahistorical because he was so
hung up on the actions of the antiwar move
ment and ignored the war itself.
"It was like. "War? What war?'" Friedman
said, "as if we were in a vacuum and all he
was considering was our actions. That was
infuriating then, and frankly it's infuriating
now. All these years later, he's still writing a
book with the same analysis."
But on one level, a preoccupation with
the University's security and ensuring that
it did not shut down was Lyman's responsi
bility, and it understandably consumed him.
"He was against the war, but he was so
wrapped up in trying to keep the
University alive that the war fades into the
background because there was a battle
ground right here," Wyman, the former
dean, said. "Students got hurt, police got
hurt. Police were hospitalized. Students
were coming out of their rental places with
MI rifles. There was some tough stuff going
on."
Freidman said for the students, the
rationale for the sit-ins and property damage
was that "this is what it's going to take to
stop this war." She thought it was "more than
tolerable in the context of an academic insti
tution debating issues that are at the front
and center of civic life."

Bernstein and. in fact, Lyman himself now
agree in retrospect that the institution of the
University was never fundamentally endan
gered.
"When 1 look back on American educa
tion," Bernstein said, "the story is all of these
years elite places keep raising money, keep
adding faculty and nothing happens. No
school was ever destroyed."
On a higher level, the truly scarring battle of
the '60s and '70s did not involve rocks or fire
bombs— it was over the academic institu
tion and it represented the crux of the larger
contest over the Left.
Journalist George Packer, whose father
was a Stanford provost in 1%9, eloquently
described the traditional liberal beliefs of
Lyman's generation of academics and those
befuddled elite parents: "Society imposes
mutual obligations from which no one is
excused .. . The rational mind, uncon
strained by religion or tradition or authority,
has the capacity to solve our problems."
The clamp on emotions and the ivory
tower's sedentary rationality had no chal
lengers in that previous era of prosperous,
postwar stability. But it came to be seen as
just empty words. To a certain extent, as
Lyman put it somewhat harshly in his book,
"rationality itself was widely scorned in the
1960s and suffered setbacks ... it has never
entirely regained its place in its supposed
Temple, the University."

So it was with great pain that even teach
ers who opposed the war found their ideals
derided bv their students, capable but
unwilling to debate ad infinitum, disinterest
ed in intellectually sparring within the sys
tem until a resolution was reached. Youth
and time couldn't wait — the casualties and
atrocities of war mounted in Vietnam daily,
and the draft loomed inescapably over
everything.
Still, the two sides saw themselves as a
clash of ideals, where the stakes were limit
less. Students collided with liberal academics
who, for the sake of institutional integrity,
offered themselves as the opposition. Lyman
had something much more valuable than the
physical security of the University to pro
tect.
"The students weren't looking for our
agreement, they were looking for our sup
port." said Rosenzweig. who eventually
headed the American Association of
Universities. "And supporting them
would've been a betrayal of what the univer
sity stands for.The university stands for mak
ing it possible for everyone to speak their
mind and act within the law to make their
ideas reality. It doesn't stand for supporting
one side or another in a dispute."
Stanford's turmoil outlasted that of other
universities. Some say it was because of the
long trial and ultimate dismissal of Bruce
Franklin, a professor of English who was

accused of inciting violence. Others point to
Stanford's location outside a city, with the
movement swelling toxicallv inside an isolat
ed, suburban echo chamber of its own mak
ing. Whatever the cause, when the draft
ended, so did the chaos.
No other generation has been shaped by
their college years like the one that experi
enced it during the '60s.
"For many Stanford students from "55 to
'68 or from '75 to the present, they would not
have a defining* time." Bernstein said.
Hut for the A3Mers, it would be the oppo
site.
"If you asked the A3Mers something
about their grad school or high school years
they'd be fuzzy," he added.
Indeed, many activists continued work
consistent with their ideals. Today, Siegel
runs his Center for Public Environmental
Oversight out of a cramped office in
Mountain View. Others, though — including
some of the most vocal activists — went on
to fields like investment banking or venture
capital or politics, cautious about disclosing
their past.
Still, the April 3 Movement continues its
reunions every 10 years. Siegel is the organ
izer this year, and it will be held this May 1-
3. A3M also maintains an active email list,
administered by Siegel. that recently lam
basted Lyman's magazine excerpt.
After Lyman's hook talk, there was a final
moment that seemed to defy the passage of
time. As Lyman walked to the parking lot
with Siegel nearby. Lyman turned and blunt
ly asked Siegel if he was ever one of the stu
dents who threw rocks. Siegel proudly
replied that no. he didn't throw rocks, but he
once lobbed a teargas canister into an SRI
window.
Considering all of the insults that have
been hurled in the past, the distrust and
antipathy, the two men were civil as they
approached their respective vehicles and
drove home knowing full well that even if
the proposed debate occurs, they will never
quite see eye-to-eye.
For both sides, deep differences in ideals
so fundamentally powerful could only be
buried over time, never quite resolved or
forgotten. It was just 1%2 when the writer
David Harris '68 looked back with the
heavy realization that the '60s were well and
truly over and penned his memoir describ
ing how those years at Stanford, which
transformed him into a nationally famous
protestor, left a lasting mark on so many
students and teachers.
But Harris also foresaw the struggle for
many to find and accept closure. He titled his
memoir "Dreams Die Hard." and some 27
years later, those words still resonate with
telling candor.

ground right here," Wyman, the former
dean, said. "Students got hurt, police got
hurt. Police were hospitalized. Students
were coming out of their rental places with
MI rifles. There was some tough stuff going
on."
Freidman said for the students, the
rationale for the sit-ins and property damage
was that "this is what it's going to take to
stop this war." She thought it was "more than
tolerable in the context of an academic insti
tution debating issues that are at the front
and center of civic life."

Bernstein and. in fact, Lyman himself now
agree in retrospect that the institution of the
University was never fundamentally endan
gered.
"When 1 look back on American educa
tion," Bernstein said, "the story is all of these
years elite places keep raising money, keep
adding faculty and nothing happens. No
school was ever destroyed."
On a higher level, the truly scarring battle of
the '60s and '70s did not involve rocks or fire
bombs— it was over the academic institu
tion and it represented the crux of the larger
contest over the Left.
Journalist George Packer, whose father
was a Stanford provost in 1%9, eloquently
described the traditional liberal beliefs of
Lyman's generation of academics and those
befuddled elite parents: "Society imposes
mutual obligations from which no one is
excused .. . The rational mind, uncon
strained by religion or tradition or authority,
has the capacity to solve our problems."
The clamp on emotions and the ivory
tower's sedentary rationality had no chal
lengers in that previous era of prosperous,
postwar stability. But it came to be seen as
just empty words. To a certain extent, as
Lyman put it somewhat harshly in his book,
"rationality itself was widely scorned in the
1960s and suffered setbacks ... it has never
entirely regained its place in its supposed
Temple, the University."

So it was with great pain that even teach
ers who opposed the war found their ideals
derided bv their students, capable but
unwilling to debate ad infinitum, disinterest
ed in intellectually sparring within the sys
tem until a resolution was reached. Youth
and time couldn't wait — the casualties and
atrocities of war mounted in Vietnam daily,
and the draft loomed inescapably over
everything.
Still, the two sides saw themselves as a
clash of ideals, where the stakes were limit
less. Students collided with liberal academics
who, for the sake of institutional integrity,
offered themselves as the opposition. Lyman
had something much more valuable than the
physical security of the University to pro
tect.
"The students weren't looking for our
agreement, they were looking for our sup
port." said Rosenzweig. who eventually
headed the American Association of
Universities. "And supporting them
would've been a betrayal of what the univer
sity stands for.The university stands for mak
ing it possible for everyone to speak their
mind and act within the law to make their
ideas reality. It doesn't stand for supporting
one side or another in a dispute."
Stanford's turmoil outlasted that of other
universities. Some say it was because of the
long trial and ultimate dismissal of Bruce
Franklin, a professor of English who was

accused of inciting violence. Others point to
Stanford's location outside a city, with the
movement swelling toxicallv inside an isolat
ed, suburban echo chamber of its own mak
ing. Whatever the cause, when the draft
ended, so did the chaos.
No other generation has been shaped by
their college years like the one that experi
enced it during the '60s.
"For many Stanford students from "55 to
'68 or from '75 to the present, they would not
have a defining* time." Bernstein said.
Hut for the A3Mers, it would be the oppo
site.
"If you asked the A3Mers something
about their grad school or high school years
they'd be fuzzy," he added.
Indeed, many activists continued work
consistent with their ideals. Today, Siegel
runs his Center for Public Environmental
Oversight out of a cramped office in
Mountain View. Others, though — including
some of the most vocal activists — went on
to fields like investment banking or venture
capital or politics, cautious about disclosing
their past.
Still, the April 3 Movement continues its
reunions every 10 years. Siegel is the organ
izer this year, and it will be held this May 1-
3. A3M also maintains an active email list,
administered by Siegel. that recently lam
basted Lyman's magazine excerpt.
After Lyman's hook talk, there was a final
moment that seemed to defy the passage of
time. As Lyman walked to the parking lot
with Siegel nearby. Lyman turned and blunt
ly asked Siegel if he was ever one of the stu
dents who threw rocks. Siegel proudly
replied that no. he didn't throw rocks, but he
once lobbed a teargas canister into an SRI
window.
Considering all of the insults that have
been hurled in the past, the distrust and
antipathy, the two men were civil as they
approached their respective vehicles and
drove home knowing full well that even if
the proposed debate occurs, they will never
quite see eye-to-eye.
For both sides, deep differences in ideals
so fundamentally powerful could only be
buried over time, never quite resolved or
forgotten. It was just 1%2 when the writer
David Harris '68 looked back with the
heavy realization that the '60s were well and
truly over and penned his memoir describ
ing how those years at Stanford, which
transformed him into a nationally famous
protestor, left a lasting mark on so many
students and teachers.
But Harris also foresaw the struggle for
many to find and accept closure. He titled his
memoir "Dreams Die Hard." and some 27
years later, those words still resonate with
telling candor.

The May 1969 student protest of Stanford Research Institute on Hannover Street turns violent as police use teargas and batons to

the silver-haired historian at the podium, a
former Stanford president now aged 85. to a
verbal joust.
I"he older man was Richard W. Lyman.
Slightly bent now. he once steered Stanford
through the tumultuous "60s and '70s. So this
was somewhat of a showdown.
The majority in the room at least half
expected this encounter, and they showed up
to the Stanford Historical Society's book talk
in droves.
The first few heartbeats passed in silence.
Then came chuckles of neutral amusement.
And finally the room reacted in full — the
groans of irritation, the few squeals of

approval, each a little
personal declaration of
sympathy for either the
stubborn administrator
or the student rebel,

visions, maybe — from

activist groups, com
prising 800 students,
gathered in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium and demand

Vietnam- related
research at Stanford and
closer oversight of the
Stanford Research
Institute in Palo Alto.
That day yielded a name
to an entire movement
at Stanford whose first
collective action, the
nine-dav sit-in at the
Applied Electronics
Laboratory (A EL).

powerfully symbolized the high-water mark of
an era at this institution.
The peaceful occupation of AEL, the lab
which conducted classified research funded
by the Defense Department during the
Vietnam War. was the last major protest
before demonstrations took a violent turn.
On the final day of April 1969, students
who dubbed themselves the A3Mers (April
3 Movement members) seized Encina Hall,
prompting Lyman, as acting head of the
University, to call in police. Although the
sheriff's deputies encountered no violence,
that first incursion of police presence on
campus crossed a line that could never be
reversed. The University's internal antago
nism worsened dramatically.

It is difficult today to imagine how dire
campus unrest eventually became in the
early "70s. when running battles between
police and students, armed with teargas and
rocks, raged in the open yards of Wilbur and
Stern Halls. The President's office was
bombed in 1%.5. and at some points nearly
every window along the Quad was smashed
and permanently boarded up. There were
daily protests in White Plaza. Old Union was
gridlocked by sit-ins. Alumni donors called in
with concern and threats. Students yelled
insults at faculty and then went home to yell
at their successful, well-off parents whose
cold liberalism was deemed hypocritical.
In a recent interview. Lyman shared a
story of his son. who once told an undergrad
uate that he feared someone might shoot his
father one morning as he walked out of
Hoover House, the President's mansion.
According to Lyman, the student replied.
"Yeah, and I might be the one with the gun."
lu tin." two months since an excerpt of Lyman's

book appeared in
Stanford Magazine, the
University community
that experienced the
unrest in the mid-'6os
and "70s has revived a
firestorm of debate,
unmatched in recent
memory.
Kevin Cool, the
magazine's editor since
1999. remembered only
one issue that roused a
comparable reaction:
exactly seven years
prior, just months after
September 11. the mag
azine ran a story sug
gesting that Stanford
consider reinstating
ROTC on campus. The
program was shut
down by the Faculty
Senate in 1969. a year
after its building near
the football stadium
was torched twice by
antiwar protestors and
ultimately razed.
The thorny back
drop of the "60s quickly
overshadowed the
ROTC issue as discus
sion heated up. The
magazine never again
received such a frenzv

of letters, phone calls and emails, nostalgic or
raging or both, until this January, when
Lyman's perspective on campus turmoil in
the late 1960s struck that same, singularly
polarizing nerve among alumni.
Cool said he would set aside room in the
two subsequent issues, the March/April and
May/June issues, to run extensive letters to
the editor.
"That period still inspires such passion by
people who lived through it.and we knew
that excerpt and the book itself would gener
ate a reaction." Cool said in early March.
"That wasn't a surprise at all."
Hut Cool wasn't banking on his own role
being dragged into the crossfire. In inter
views. alumni and faculty have accused him

of poor editorial judgment, of offering an
unfairly favorable presentation of Lyman's
excerpt, of failing to grant protestors a fair
chance to voice their rebuttals — all this
atop criticism of Lyman's writing itself.
Lenny Siegel hasn't changed much from the
earnest, lower-middle class Jewish boy who
appeared in an obscure 1%9 documentary
filmed on campus by local public television
crews.
Siegel said he joined the movement after
he arrived to study physics and realized, as
did other students in technical fields, that his
career path after graduating would be chan
neled towards working for the government
at facilities like the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI), and hv association, the war
machine that ravaged Vietnam.
While ALL might have been memorable,
the Research Institute off Page Mill Road, a
government-funded lab that also conducted

classified research, was the main target for
students.
"I can't explain the level of violence here
except that the students identified Stanford,
and not without some truth, with the conduct
of the war." said Bob Rosenzweig. a top
University official loathed by radical stu
dents and one of Lyman's staunchest defend
ers at the time, in an interview with The
Daily "We were at the time one of the two or
three preeminent engineering and technolo
gy universities with a lot of defense depart
ment money and classified research. It was
n't unreasonable to make that identification
and maybe that produced greater frustration
and more violence."
Never blessed with great charisma,
Siegel was instead organized and cerebral,
planning demonstrations or dragging con
sensus meetings out of the usual quagmires
that plagued productivity. Siegel was never
the loudest, but he tried hardest to keep

things together.
Hut on May 16,1%9, Siegel did more than
just plan demonstrations. It is with great
pride and a wink that Siegel recounts the
May protest at the SRI labs on Hannover
Street, where a traffic blockade erected by
students was ultimately dispersed by teargas
and I'M/ policemen charging with batons.
Many activists — and Siegel's son. he noted
know the story of how he dramatically
picked up and hurled an.open teargas canis
ter 40 yards into an SKI window.
"Years of play ing football paid off." Siegel
said.

related research to a halt by their mere pres
ence. Friedman argued, the students "were
harming the war machine." A famous San
Francisco ( hronicle columnist stopped by to
chat, and the students found and operated a
printing press in the basement of the build
ing to publish leaflets and daily reports that
they slipped under doors in every dorm
room.
During the period that peaked with the
All. sit-in, before the minority pro-violence
groups splintered and outshouted the major
ity. the movement enjoyed broad support
from the community. Women from Palo Alto
brought fresh laundry and food to AEL. and
students swept the floors and baked bread
on each of the nine days before heading ofl
to class.
"We were creating this alternate sort ol
reality." said Jean Friedman, who headed the
occupation as a political science graduate
student in 1% 1 ). "It was open. Campus police
could walk through, campus administration
could walk through, anybody could walk
through and talk on the microphone."
In many ways the movement was at its peak
when it was most articulate and thoughtful,
considering that there was a campus consen
sus that agreed with its general position on
the war.
To be sure, the majority of the faculty.
Lyman and most of his administration col

Vietnam — "I thought it was stupid," Lyman

pleted "Campus in Turmoil," a recollec
tion of the University's turbulent history in
the midst of student antiwar unrest in the
1960s and '70s.


GERRY SHIH/The Stanford Daily-
In the '60s and '70s, Lenny Siegel helped to organize antiwar student demostrations against the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), protesting
the lab's Vietnam-related research. During the May 1969 protest at the SRI labs, Siegel joined throngs of students in a traffic blockade that
was ultimately broken up by police teargas.

grounded in more sophisticated differences
than the dualisms that have come to charac
terize the post-1990s 1 "culture wars."
Antiwar groups tussled over the morality
of resisting the draft. Some activists pon
dered how to engage the civil rights issue
that swirled underfoot — many students
had wealthy families to return home to.
while poor blacks and whites had little
choice but to fight in Vietnam. Questions
emerged: Interrupt disagreeable faculty or
respect academic freedom'.' Pander to the
liberal center or rebel? Violence or non-vio
lence? Liberal democracy or socialism?
Even LSD couldn't guarantee the path to
discovering answers.
Ideological ferment raged along the full
spectrum of political thought. Faculty and
alumni alike retell the story of a nervy meet
ing during the spring of 1969 when students
demanded that the Board of Trustees
demonstrate that they were not "out of
touch" by confessing their own political
views. A prominent trustee — possibly
William Hewlett himself — stood up and
pointed out the Democratic or Republican
affiliation of each trustee around the table as
if to show bipartisanship.
Point proven. The students were exasper
ated.
"The board just didn't get it," recalled
Barton Bernstein, a professor of history. "To
only consider Democrat or Republican was
such a narrow understanding of politics. The
'60s offered a different conception; it offered
a different worldview."
And this troubled parents greatly.
Born to a family of activists in Los
Angeles. Siegel arrived at the Farm in 1966
poorer than many of the student activists
he fell in with. They included sons and
daughters with names like Katzenbach and
Rusk and Rockefeller, great families that
recognized Stanford's ascendency in the
West, but failed to understand why their
children despised them so when they
returned home.
Movement leaders relished their influence
over so many members from distinguished
families who would become "the very top
leaders of society." In November 1968, The
Daily published a telling profile of the
Stanford branch of the Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS). noting, "Hal
I lamilton. a junior and leader in SDS believes
'Stanford is a ruling class school. We've got
the big targets here,' Hamilton told the Daily
reporter, 'not only in University associations
but in the student bodv.'"

Concerns iihout Stanford's public prestige,
institutional inteeritv and trustee relations

during the tumult linger prominently in
Lyman's book, written almost 30 years after
he stepped out of an administrative role. His
critics say he misses the point, that his
account is ahistorical because he was so
hung up on the actions of the antiwar move
ment and ignored the war itself.
"It was like. "War? What war?'" Friedman
said, "as if we were in a vacuum and all he
was considering was our actions. That was
infuriating then, and frankly it's infuriating
now. All these years later, he's still writing a
book with the same analysis."
But on one level, a preoccupation with
the University's security and ensuring that
it did not shut down was Lyman's responsi
bility, and it understandably consumed him.
"He was against the war, but he was so
wrapped up in trying to keep the
University alive that the war fades into the
background because there was a battle
ground right here," Wyman, the former
dean, said. "Students got hurt, police got
hurt. Police were hospitalized. Students
were coming out of their rental places with
MI rifles. There was some tough stuff going
on."
Freidman said for the students, the
rationale for the sit-ins and property damage
was that "this is what it's going to take to
stop this war." She thought it was "more than
tolerable in the context of an academic insti
tution debating issues that are at the front
and center of civic life."

Bernstein and. in fact, Lyman himself now
agree in retrospect that the institution of the
University was never fundamentally endan
gered.
"When 1 look back on American educa
tion," Bernstein said, "the story is all of these
years elite places keep raising money, keep

Richard W. Lyman, former Stanford presi

pleted "Campus in Turmoil," a recollec
tion of the University's turbulent history in
the midst of student antiwar unrest in the
1960s and '70s.


GERRY SHIH/The Stanford Daily-
In the '60s and '70s, Lenny Siegel helped to organize antiwar student demostrations against the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), protesting
the lab's Vietnam-related research. During the May 1969 protest at the SRI labs, Siegel joined throngs of students in a traffic blockade that
was ultimately broken up by police teargas.

grounded in more sophisticated differences
than the dualisms that have come to charac
terize the post-1990s 1 "culture wars."
Antiwar groups tussled over the morality
of resisting the draft. Some activists pon
dered how to engage the civil rights issue
that swirled underfoot — many students
had wealthy families to return home to.
while poor blacks and whites had little
choice but to fight in Vietnam. Questions
emerged: Interrupt disagreeable faculty or
respect academic freedom'.' Pander to the
liberal center or rebel? Violence or non-vio
lence? Liberal democracy or socialism?
Even LSD couldn't guarantee the path to
discovering answers.
Ideological ferment raged along the full
spectrum of political thought. Faculty and
alumni alike retell the story of a nervy meet
ing during the spring of 1969 when students
demanded that the Board of Trustees
demonstrate that they were not "out of
touch" by confessing their own political
views. A prominent trustee — possibly
William Hewlett himself — stood up and
pointed out the Democratic or Republican
affiliation of each trustee around the table as
if to show bipartisanship.
Point proven. The students were exasper
ated.
"The board just didn't get it," recalled
Barton Bernstein, a professor of history. "To
only consider Democrat or Republican was
such a narrow understanding of politics. The
'60s offered a different conception; it offered
a different worldview."
And this troubled parents greatly.
Born to a family of activists in Los
Angeles. Siegel arrived at the Farm in 1966
poorer than many of the student activists
he fell in with. They included sons and
daughters with names like Katzenbach and
Rusk and Rockefeller, great families that
recognized Stanford's ascendency in the
West, but failed to understand why their
children despised them so when they
returned home.
Movement leaders relished their influence
over so many members from distinguished
families who would become "the very top
leaders of society." In November 1968, The
Daily published a telling profile of the
Stanford branch of the Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS). noting, "Hal
I lamilton. a junior and leader in SDS believes
'Stanford is a ruling class school. We've got
the big targets here,' Hamilton told the Daily
reporter, 'not only in University associations
but in the student bodv.'"

Concerns iihout Stanford's public prestige,
institutional inteeritv and trustee relations

during the tumult linger prominently in
Lyman's book, written almost 30 years after
he stepped out of an administrative role. His
critics say he misses the point, that his
account is ahistorical because he was so
hung up on the actions of the antiwar move
ment and ignored the war itself.
"It was like. "War? What war?'" Friedman
said, "as if we were in a vacuum and all he
was considering was our actions. That was
infuriating then, and frankly it's infuriating
now. All these years later, he's still writing a
book with the same analysis."
But on one level, a preoccupation with
the University's security and ensuring that
it did not shut down was Lyman's responsi
bility, and it understandably consumed him.
"He was against the war, but he was so
wrapped up in trying to keep the
University alive that the war fades into the
background because there was a battle
ground right here," Wyman, the former
dean, said. "Students got hurt, police got
hurt. Police were hospitalized. Students
were coming out of their rental places with
MI rifles. There was some tough stuff going
on."
Freidman said for the students, the
rationale for the sit-ins and property damage
was that "this is what it's going to take to
stop this war." She thought it was "more than
tolerable in the context of an academic insti
tution debating issues that are at the front
and center of civic life."

Bernstein and. in fact, Lyman himself now
agree in retrospect that the institution of the
University was never fundamentally endan
gered.
"When 1 look back on American educa
tion," Bernstein said, "the story is all of these
years elite places keep raising money, keep
adding faculty and nothing happens. No
school was ever destroyed."
On a higher level, the truly scarring battle of
the '60s and '70s did not involve rocks or fire
bombs— it was over the academic institu
tion and it represented the crux of the larger
contest over the Left.
Journalist George Packer, whose father
was a Stanford provost in 1%9, eloquently
described the traditional liberal beliefs of
Lyman's generation of academics and those
befuddled elite parents: "Society imposes
mutual obligations from which no one is
excused .. . The rational mind, uncon
strained by religion or tradition or authority,
has the capacity to solve our problems."
The clamp on emotions and the ivory
tower's sedentary rationality had no chal
lengers in that previous era of prosperous,
postwar stability. But it came to be seen as
just empty words. To a certain extent, as
Lyman put it somewhat harshly in his book,
"rationality itself was widely scorned in the
1960s and suffered setbacks ... it has never
entirely regained its place in its supposed
Temple, the University."

So it was with great pain that even teach
ers who opposed the war found their ideals
derided bv their students, capable but
unwilling to debate ad infinitum, disinterest
ed in intellectually sparring within the sys
tem until a resolution was reached. Youth
and time couldn't wait — the casualties and
atrocities of war mounted in Vietnam daily,
and the draft loomed inescapably over
everything.
Still, the two sides saw themselves as a
clash of ideals, where the stakes were limit
less. Students collided with liberal academics
who, for the sake of institutional integrity,
offered themselves as the opposition. Lyman
had something much more valuable than the
physical security of the University to pro
tect.
"The students weren't looking for our
agreement, they were looking for our sup
port." said Rosenzweig. who eventually
headed the American Association of
Universities. "And supporting them
would've been a betrayal of what the univer
sity stands for.The university stands for mak
ing it possible for everyone to speak their
mind and act within the law to make their
ideas reality. It doesn't stand for supporting
one side or another in a dispute."
Stanford's turmoil outlasted that of other
universities. Some say it was because of the
long trial and ultimate dismissal of Bruce
Franklin, a professor of English who was

accused of inciting violence. Others point to
Stanford's location outside a city, with the
movement swelling toxicallv inside an isolat
ed, suburban echo chamber of its own mak
ing. Whatever the cause, when the draft
ended, so did the chaos.
No other generation has been shaped by
their college years like the one that experi
enced it during the '60s.
"For many Stanford students from "55 to
'68 or from '75 to the present, they would not
have a defining* time." Bernstein said.
Hut for the A3Mers, it would be the oppo
site.
"If you asked the A3Mers something
about their grad school or high school years
they'd be fuzzy," he added.
Indeed, many activists continued work
consistent with their ideals. Today, Siegel
runs his Center for Public Environmental
Oversight out of a cramped office in
Mountain View. Others, though — including
some of the most vocal activists — went on
to fields like investment banking or venture
capital or politics, cautious about disclosing
their past.
Still, the April 3 Movement continues its
reunions every 10 years. Siegel is the organ
izer this year, and it will be held this May 1-
3. A3M also maintains an active email list,
administered by Siegel. that recently lam
basted Lyman's magazine excerpt.
After Lyman's hook talk, there was a final
moment that seemed to defy the passage of
time. As Lyman walked to the parking lot
with Siegel nearby. Lyman turned and blunt
ly asked Siegel if he was ever one of the stu
dents who threw rocks. Siegel proudly
replied that no. he didn't throw rocks, but he
once lobbed a teargas canister into an SRI
window.
Considering all of the insults that have
been hurled in the past, the distrust and
antipathy, the two men were civil as they
approached their respective vehicles and
drove home knowing full well that even if
the proposed debate occurs, they will never
quite see eye-to-eye.
For both sides, deep differences in ideals
so fundamentally powerful could only be
buried over time, never quite resolved or
forgotten. It was just 1%2 when the writer
David Harris '68 looked back with the
heavy realization that the '60s were well and
truly over and penned his memoir describ
ing how those years at Stanford, which
transformed him into a nationally famous
protestor, left a lasting mark on so many
students and teachers.
But Harris also foresaw the struggle for
many to find and accept closure. He titled his
memoir "Dreams Die Hard." and some 27
years later, those words still resonate with
telling candor.

The May 1969 student protest of Stanford Research Institute on Hannover Street turns violent as police use teargas and batons to
dispel demonstrators.

one recent afternoon, a man in

pins gleaming on his chest — and challenged
the silver-haired historian at the podium, a
former Stanford president now aged 85. to a
verbal joust.
I"he older man was Richard W. Lyman.
Slightly bent now. he once steered Stanford
through the tumultuous "60s and '70s. So this
was somewhat of a showdown.
The majority in the room at least half
expected this encounter, and they showed up
to the Stanford Historical Society's book talk
in droves.
The first few heartbeats passed in silence.
Then came chuckles of neutral amusement.
And finally the room reacted in full — the
groans of irritation, the few squeals of

approval, each a little
personal declaration of
sympathy for either the
stubborn administrator
or the student rebel,

visions, maybe — from
an unforgotten period

chaotic times.
Fridii\. April 3 marks 40
years since the day 14
activist groups, com
prising 800 students,
gathered in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium and demand
ed an end to classified and
Vietnam- related
research at Stanford and
closer oversight of the
Stanford Research
Institute in Palo Alto.
That day yielded a name
to an entire movement
at Stanford whose first
collective action, the
nine-dav sit-in at the
Applied Electronics
Laboratory (A EL).

powerfully symbolized the high-water mark of
an era at this institution.
The peaceful occupation of AEL, the lab
which conducted classified research funded
by the Defense Department during the
Vietnam War. was the last major protest
before demonstrations took a violent turn.
On the final day of April 1969, students
who dubbed themselves the A3Mers (April
3 Movement members) seized Encina Hall,
prompting Lyman, as acting head of the
University, to call in police. Although the
sheriff's deputies encountered no violence,
that first incursion of police presence on
campus crossed a line that could never be
reversed. The University's internal antago
nism worsened dramatically.

It is difficult today to imagine how dire
campus unrest eventually became in the
early "70s. when running battles between
police and students, armed with teargas and
rocks, raged in the open yards of Wilbur and
Stern Halls. The President's office was
bombed in 1%.5. and at some points nearly
every window along the Quad was smashed
and permanently boarded up. There were
daily protests in White Plaza. Old Union was
gridlocked by sit-ins. Alumni donors called in
with concern and threats. Students yelled
insults at faculty and then went home to yell
at their successful, well-off parents whose
cold liberalism was deemed hypocritical.
In a recent interview. Lyman shared a
story of his son. who once told an undergrad
uate that he feared someone might shoot his
father one morning as he walked out of
Hoover House, the President's mansion.
According to Lyman, the student replied.
"Yeah, and I might be the one with the gun."
lu tin." two months since an excerpt of Lyman's

book appeared in
Stanford Magazine, the
University community
that experienced the
unrest in the mid-'6os
and "70s has revived a
firestorm of debate,
unmatched in recent
memory.
Kevin Cool, the
magazine's editor since
1999. remembered only
one issue that roused a
comparable reaction:
exactly seven years
prior, just months after
September 11. the mag
azine ran a story sug
gesting that Stanford
consider reinstating
ROTC on campus. The
program was shut
down by the Faculty
Senate in 1969. a year
after its building near
the football stadium
was torched twice by
antiwar protestors and
ultimately razed.
The thorny back
drop of the "60s quickly
overshadowed the
ROTC issue as discus
sion heated up. The
magazine never again
received such a frenzv

of letters, phone calls and emails, nostalgic or
raging or both, until this January, when
Lyman's perspective on campus turmoil in
the late 1960s struck that same, singularly
polarizing nerve among alumni.
Cool said he would set aside room in the
two subsequent issues, the March/April and
May/June issues, to run extensive letters to
the editor.
"That period still inspires such passion by
people who lived through it.and we knew
that excerpt and the book itself would gener
ate a reaction." Cool said in early March.
"That wasn't a surprise at all."
Hut Cool wasn't banking on his own role
being dragged into the crossfire. In inter
views. alumni and faculty have accused him

of poor editorial judgment, of offering an
unfairly favorable presentation of Lyman's
excerpt, of failing to grant protestors a fair
chance to voice their rebuttals — all this
atop criticism of Lyman's writing itself.
Lenny Siegel hasn't changed much from the
earnest, lower-middle class Jewish boy who
appeared in an obscure 1%9 documentary
filmed on campus by local public television
crews.
Siegel said he joined the movement after
he arrived to study physics and realized, as
did other students in technical fields, that his
career path after graduating would be chan
neled towards working for the government
at facilities like the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI), and hv association, the war
machine that ravaged Vietnam.
While ALL might have been memorable,
the Research Institute off Page Mill Road, a
government-funded lab that also conducted

classified research, was the main target for
students.
"I can't explain the level of violence here
except that the students identified Stanford,
and not without some truth, with the conduct
of the war." said Bob Rosenzweig. a top
University official loathed by radical stu
dents and one of Lyman's staunchest defend
ers at the time, in an interview with The
Daily "We were at the time one of the two or
three preeminent engineering and technolo
gy universities with a lot of defense depart
ment money and classified research. It was
n't unreasonable to make that identification
and maybe that produced greater frustration
and more violence."
Never blessed with great charisma,
Siegel was instead organized and cerebral,
planning demonstrations or dragging con
sensus meetings out of the usual quagmires
that plagued productivity. Siegel was never
the loudest, but he tried hardest to keep

things together.
Hut on May 16,1%9, Siegel did more than
just plan demonstrations. It is with great
pride and a wink that Siegel recounts the
May protest at the SRI labs on Hannover
Street, where a traffic blockade erected by
students was ultimately dispersed by teargas
and I'M/ policemen charging with batons.
Many activists — and Siegel's son. he noted

The May 1969 student protest of Stanford Research Institute on Hannover Street turns violent as police use teargas and batons to
dispel demonstrators.
