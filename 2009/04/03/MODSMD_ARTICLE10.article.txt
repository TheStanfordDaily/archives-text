### ELLEN HUET CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Public service has been a theme for
ASSIJ Executives Jonny Dorsey '09 and
Fagan Harris '09. tracing all the way back
to their campaign last spring. This
Saturday, members of the Stanford com
munity will gather at the Y2F.2 building for
the first Stanford Service Summit, which is
meant to be the culmination of Dorsey and
Harris' election promise.
Comprised of a Service at Stanford
Showcase, nine different focus area forums
and a variety of speakers, the Summit will
focus on discussing the role of public serv
ice as a part of the University's mission and
identity. Currently, over 300 participants
have already signed up for the events.
The original inspiration for the Service
Summit came when ASSIJ President
Jonny Dorsey '09 attended the Service
Nation Summit last summer in New York.
Last fall, an assembled student team began
to plan an event that would realize (his
vision.
"The impetus for the Summit came
from the ASSIJ Execs, but our role has pri
marily been to bring the different stake
holders together for a community conver
sation." explained Anuraag C'higurupati
'09, one of the co-organizers of the
Summit, in an email to The Daily. "The sin
gle biggest goal for the Summit is to gath
er the community together to develop a
ten-year vision for advancing public serv
ice at Stanford and a roadmap with specif
ic action steps for achieving the vision."
Organizers hope that participants will
find plenty of inspiration for public service
in the large number of planned events and
panels for Saturday. ()ne event, the Ser\ ice
Showcase, will focus on service work done
in academic departments, as well as by stu
dent organizations such as Stanford in
Government and Students for a
Sustainable Stanford.
"Hopefully, this particular showcase
will help enhance the roles of existing serv
ice [Voluntary Student Organizations) on
campus, because what these groups have
been doing is not negligible," said Philippe
de Koning ' 10. the Summit's student group
outreach coordinator.
Focus area forums will also take place
throughout the afternoon, addressing
areas such as education, the environment,
health and public interest law. I ach panel
will have three to five speakers, drawing
from students, local leaders, alumni and
professionals in fields ol public service.
According to organizers, the keynote
address will be given by Steve Westly '7K
MBA *K3. managing partner ol The WestK
Group and former California State
Controller. Video messages will also be
played from the chair of the Board of
Trustees. Leslie Hume Ph.D. '70. and
President John Hennessv. The day will
conclude with a Fireside Chat with Dr.
Larry Brilliant, Google's Chief
Philanthropy I vangclist.
While the Summit s goals are ambi
tious. organizers are optimistic of its long
term benefits, already developing plans for
what is to come after the event.
"We were very concerned with building
a follow-up plan, to make sure that the
energy and vision that came out of the
Summit didn't lizzie the Monday after."
Chigurupati said. "We have decided to
develop an oversight body of students, fac
ulty, and stall to push the roadmap for
ward after the Summit."
Chigurupati stressed that the Summit
will not be a yearly event. Instead, its focus
is to gather the community for a long-term
vision. I he Summit organizing team hopes
to see a shift in the locus on public service
at Stanford, such as with Branner's recent
Iv announced change to become a public
service focus dorm.
"Branner s public service focus for next
year is not directly connected to the
Summit, although we're obviously quite
excited about it. said Chigurupati.
"Branner RF Nancy Buflington was one ol
the core members of our Summit Task
Force."
As for this weekend's event and its far
reaching influences, the Summit organizers
have high hopes for its timeliness and last
ing impact.
"We simultaneously have enormous
national challenges, a president who has
made a call to service a large part of his
message, and bipartisan support for things
like the Serve America Act. Chigurupati
said."l think you see that there couldn't be
a better time lor the Stanford community
to come together to talk about service."
