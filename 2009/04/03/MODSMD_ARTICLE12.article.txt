## EDITORIAL Advanced online posting of syllabi makes shopping easier 
### 
The world may be suffering from a glob
al economic recession, hut at Stanford,
it always seems like students are still
shopping — for classes. Visiting and evaluat
ing multiple classes is a hectic.time-intensive
process that consumes the lives of students
and faculty for the first two weeks of the
quarter.
But it can be easier. Shopping for courses
at the beginning of the quarter would be
greatly improved if faculty would make bet
ter use of online resources that would allow
for students to shop for classes well before
they actually start, using services such as
Coursework. Stanford Syllabus. You Tube
and iTunes University.
Many students shop classes to ascertain
basic information about workload, course
texts, grading, course expectations, lecturing
style and other data that can easily be ob
tained from a syllabus. In fact.many students
drop by a class merely to pick one up.
It is likely that many professors already
have a set syllabus, or at least a preliminary
one. a few days prior to the start of the quar
ter. It is relatively straightforward and not
unrealistic to ask that professors take the ad
ditional step of uploading their syllabi to
"Stanford Syllabus," a database of class syl
labi accessible to students, a week or more
before the start of the quarter. Yet at this
point in the quarter, there are still a large
number of syllabi not online. This may create
additional difficulty for students juggling
five or more classes without basic informa
tion to guide them.
There can be tangible financial benefits
for students if professors upload their syllabi

early on. Many students choose to order
their course texts online, often for greatly re
duced prices. Knowing in advance what
books will he needed means that students
can order cheaper copies and not he without
their books for the first weeks of the quarter.
Given the frequently large differences in
Stanford Bookstore versus outside pricing,
these are not savings to he ignored due to
faculty indifference.
While students might get enough from a
syllabus to make their course decisions,
many also like to see the teaching style of the
professor first-hand in order to discern
whether the class looks as good in person as
it does on paper. Video is certainly not an ad
equate substitute for actually attending
class, but it can give a student a sense of the
professor — perhaps enough of a sense that,
along with a syllabus.she can opt not to cram
another class into her first week.
With many lectures and some entire
classes on Stanford's iTunes University
page, the editorial board believes that we
have a tremendous resource that can still be
better utilized to provide students with a
more complete picture of a course. Stan
lord's You lube channel offers similar op
portunities.
By making better use of the online re
sources we already have — perhaps encour
aging departments to upload syllabi or sub
mit reader materials in advance and urging
the tech-savvy to post sample lecture videos
will simplify the shopping period for stu
dents and faculty alike. It is up to the depart
ments to ensure that we. the students, do not
shop "til we drop.
