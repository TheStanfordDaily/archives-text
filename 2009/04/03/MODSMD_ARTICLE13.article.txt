Raise your hand if you have ever blacked
out from alcohol at a party.
You look around, and see who else has
raised their hand. You soon notice that no one
around you has. Self-consciously, you put your
hand back down, only to realize that the rea
son no one else's hands were raised was per
haps because they. too. are self-conscious, or
more likely, because they are not currently
readingthiscolumn. But between you and me.
let's be honest: they have probably blacked
out at a party. And so have you.
Does blacking out mean you have an alco
hol problem? Not necessarily. ITiat kind of
thing has happened to the best of us But the
frequency with which it happens in our culture
not American culture, per se. but modern
American college culture — is troubling.
I'm a senior who, by the time you read this,
will have turned 22 years young (so write
something witty on my lacebook wall, please,
if you haven't already). Ihis means that,
among other things. I do not frequent Irat par
ties as often as I used to.
But according to Stanford's Alcohol Ads i
sorv Board, "serious alcohol incidents' this
past fall quarter exceeded those of previous
fall quarters (See ' Bd. reviews alcohol policy "
in the Jan.9 issue ofHie Daily). As it happens,
this recent revelation coincides with the
Board's upcoming review of the standing New
Student ()rientation alcohol policy
()f course, when the incidence of alcohol
related emergencies on campus suddenly in
creases. there ought to be cause for concern.
But what is at work here is much bigger than
something an Advisory Board policy can lix.
What we are dealing with here is a culture of
binge drinking.
As we all know, this culture is not unique at
all to our generation, nor does it belong solely
to our university or even to American univer
sities at large. But the tolerance in universities
across America when it comes to the idea of
drinking with the intent to get hammered is
at a level matched by few countries on earth.
How many ol us have Iriends who drink
heavily three, l« >ur, live tunes a week! Ihe cul
ture in place at our school, and in our country,
tolerates Ihis. l ew pe<ipleon this campus blink
an eye when one < >1 theii Iriends till them they
got trashed three nights in a row. (Juite the
contrary,in tact, we usually laugh anil then ask
for some stories. Ihis is not to say that such be
havior is expected, but it is indeed acceptable.
But that is something that we as students
all know. What has been less explored, though,
are the real roots ol what h.ts caused binge
drinking t«» lake hold .is a cultural phenome
n<m Iw< mid propose a couple ol Iheoiles:
I ifstly. college is the place and tune in

which many of lis expect to come into our own
as people and become the person we want to
be. It is not a gross overgeneralization to claim
that, coming out of high school, a lot of us
Stanford students were nerds. Many of us ex
perimented with alcohol for the first time as
freshmen, l or such people, alcohol is a symbol
ol their assertion of their own ability to feel
cool, contrary to the way they were seen in
high school, it is the feeling that, perhaps for
the first time, others around them are legit
imizing them. In an attempt to maintain that
sense of legitimacy, some of us go overboard
when it comes to drinking without ever realiz
ing it. And when we see others doing the same,
we feel no reason to assume there is anything
wrong with that.
Second, drinking at college has become a
sort of rite of passage. How many conversa
tions with our friends involve weekend de
bauchery? How many of those stories could
have happened without alcohol, or. dare I say
without extreme!) copious amounts of alco
hol? Ihe reason that our conversations tend to
revolve so disproportionately around these
stories is that alcohol is. more often than not.
the place where we find that common bond
with our friends. Not as alcoholics, but as col
lege students experiencing college life.
It cannot be denied that there is a certain
demographic of students at Stanford who. in
fact, do not drink at all. But for the majority of
us.alcohol was and is central to our social tran
sition into college.To the incoming freshman,
the frat party, an "Animal House'-type expe
rience. is synonymous with getting integrated
into college.
Finally, binge drinking exists at colleges
today because, well, it existed yesterday It is.
just as all other cultures are. self-propagating.
College students will argue that, normatively
speaking.the fact that most other Western cul
tures drink socially, rather than aggressively
and belligerently, does not make our drinking
culture more wrong or right.
Indeed, what is most important to under
stand is that binge drinking is not a mindset
it is a culture. And as with other cultures, it will
take more than administrative policy to affect
change: it will require a change of mindset on
behalf ol the students themselves.
