lam not a fan of a cappella. For those of
you who (somehow) don't know, a cap
pella is the tradition of taking perfectly
good songs and rearranging them so that
people sing all the parts that our forebears'
designed instruments do much, much better.
Stanford (somehow) has nine of these
groups.
Based on science, a cappella began in the
time of cavemen, when our primitive ances
tors would harmonize their rudimentary
caveman utterances into a sound so vile that
it could take down a stegosaurus from 50
paces. 1 low were cavemen and stegosaurus
es. creatures separated by 150 million years,
around at the same time? Ask lestimony.
(For those of you who play drinking
games to my columns/Testimony" should be
the top "buzzed-word" on your list for
today.)
Now. some may say that my dislike of a
cappella stems from the fact that my own
singing voice sounds like a cross between
Mob Dylan's and some sort of cat pinned
down by a tractor. 1 low ever, my sense of jeal
ousy accounts for no more than 15 percent of
my antipathy. From two songs into the first
Fleet Street performance I saw at Admit
Weekend. I knew that I disliked a cappella.
with itsoverdramatic soloists and its progres
sively less ironic use of beatboxing.
Hut unfortunately, a cappella has bur
rowed itself deep into the intestines of Stan
ford like no other system of groups here
have. Take, for example. The () Show — a
ceremony that essentially serves as a show
case for all nine a cappella organizations and
one or two other performance groups Not
only is having such a show unfair to the hun
dreds of other groups we have on this cam
pus. it's also unfair to the hundreds of inno
cent freshmen who sit through it in .in al
ready very busy orientation week.
Additionally, whenever dorms need
someone to perform tor parents, dorm shows
or ProFros. a cappella groups are normally at
the top of their lists Why not a dance troupe,
or. much cooler, a rock band ' At least with a
rock band, you can stand up and dance; with
a cappella shows, you tr\ to remember the
songs as you once loved them as you pray lor
the whiskey you snuck in to hit soon.

More frightening, unless you stop them, a
cappella groups will multiply. For every
singer given a spot in a group, three others
are jilted ( Hi is is an estimate. No one wants
to fess up to being rejected by Mixed Co.).
Nursing their wounds, these members re
group into an even worse a cappella troupe,
calling themselves something revolting like
"the Harmonics."
Now. this is not an attack on members of a
cappella groups I count many (or. at least,
once counted many, depending on how many
people read this column) as friends, and I'm
happy to see people really enjoying them
selves in performances after spending count
less hours charting and learning to sing diffi
cult songs. But why do we need nine different
a cappella shows every quarter? Why can't
groups do more collaborative shows? ITie
number of new songs these groups come up
with per quarter is not particularly high, and
I think sharing shows might help whittle
down the best material from each.
On a more social level. I can assure you
from experience that nothing kills a party
quite as fast .is the Mendicants drunkenly
belting "Brown-F\ed Ciirl." Actually. I take
that back I can only imagine how terrible
a party would be il an inebriated Talisman
started singing a 40-niinute rendition of the
national anthem. And anything by lestimo
nv. I fear, would be much, much worse.
I guess I don't really know what I want to
come out of this column, though I have a few
ideas. Maybe we could see a couple groups
merge, or better yet. we could create a
school-wide ban on a cappella group prolif
eration. (It we don't do something now. our
children may be forced to attend a Stanford
with an '"KOs video game theme music"
group, a "songs of Neil Diamond" group or
maybe even a "jazz infused Kabbalah
praise" group.)
()r mavbe I'd like to see other groups on

this campus more proportionately involved
in school events. We could have fewer roll
outs with Fleet Street singing in the lounge,
and more with StanfordTaiko pounding the
hell out of drums. That's sure to put a kick in
any freshman's morning.
Maybe we could even see a day where a
cappella shows engage audience members,
instead of expecting them to pay for admis
sion and sit through up to 9() minutes of songs
they have mostly heard before.
i think what I want most of all. though, is
to be able to say openly 'I don't really care
for a cappella." without making it personal.
When the topic comes up. I don't want to
have to see if anyone easily offended is
around.
I w ant to be able to state my dislike proud
ly. because it means that 1 have discovered
something about my personal tastes, which,
really, is what the arts community we need
here should be about: self discovery through
interaction with art. So if sou like a cappella
or it you're a member of a group, that's fan
tastic— I hope you'll keep doing what you
love and won't hate me for writing this. But it
you don't fall into either of those categories,
know that it's ()k not to like everything.
