Extending its winning streak to three

look to beat up an old foe. freshly returned
to action this weekend.
'ITie C ardinal (9-11.3-3 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) continued its recent run of spring dom
inance with a tight victory over Santa Clara
(10-13), aided by sophomore Kellen kiils
gaard's single in the bottom of the eighth to
bring in sophomore shortstop Jake Sch
lander for the 6-5 non-conference victory.
With Stanford down 2-3 entering the bot
tom of the fifth inning, Santa Clara pitcher
Jason Westerberg was victimized by a pair of
Cardinal home runs as senior Joey August
hit a line-drive rocket over the right-field
wall to lead off the inning and fellow senior

Brent Milleville bombed one over left field
in a two-run shot. When August,sophomore
Xacli Jones and Milleville all crossed home,
Stanford took the 5-3 lead over the Broncos.
"It was really nice to get a little rally
going in the fifth," August said."l was just
trying to hit a ball hard, and I was fortunate
enough to get a good pitch to hit. Then we
were able to get a guy on for Milleville, and
I can't say enough about how huge his home
run was — it really gave us a spark and a kit
of confidence going into the later innings of
the game."
Strong defensive play in the sixth made
for a scoreless inning, as Stanford's defense
executed the play at first base for the first
out. won the squeeze play for the second out
and carried out an easy second to first play
to shut the Broncos down. But Santa Clara
came back with tough defense of its own to

shut the Stanford bats down in the bottom
half of the inning.
"I really think that our pitching is step
ping up for us when we need them to,"
Milleville said."l feel like you can throw any
of our pitchers against anyone and they wiil
be able to get the other team out."
In the seventh, though, the Broncos' of
fense showed signs of life against sopho
more Michael Marshall, who gave up a pair
of runs. A strikeout, followed by a double,
two walks and a sacrifice rallied in the tying
runs, putting the score at 5-5. Stanford was
unable to respond with its own bats in the
bottom half of the inning, and sent out soph
omore closer Drew Storen in the eighth,
who retired the side on three consecutive
strikeouts, all swinging.
Nearing the end. Stanford made noise in
the bottom of I he eighth inning. A Sch

lander single, sophomore Colin Walsh's
walk and sophomore Jonathan Kaskow's
single loaded the bases with two outs. With
the count at 1 -2. Kiilsgaard hammered a sin

run.

coming in a shutting door like he always
does." August said after the victory. "I also

again for us in the clutch, like he has all

Storen took the mound again in the ninth
and siruck out two consecutive batters be
