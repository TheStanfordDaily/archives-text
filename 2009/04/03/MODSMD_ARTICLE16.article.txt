With Stanford down 2-3 entering the bot
tom of the fifth inning, Santa Clara pitcher
Jason Westerberg was victimized by a pair of
Cardinal home runs as senior Joey August

wall to lead off the inning and fellow senior

Brent Milleville bombed one over left field
in a two-run shot. When August,sophomore
Xacli Jones and Milleville all crossed home,
Stanford took the 5-3 lead over the Broncos.

going in the fifth," August said."l was just
trying to hit a ball hard, and I was fortunate
enough to get a good pitch to hit. Then we

I can't say enough about how huge his home
run was â€” it really gave us a spark and a kit
of confidence going into the later innings of
the game."
