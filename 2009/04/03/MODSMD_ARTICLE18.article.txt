# SQUASH
## Card extends helping hand to archrival Cal 
### ZOE LEAVITT STAFF WRITER 
Overcoming the rivalry to make the ri
valry stronger. That's men's squash coach
Mark Talbott's idea behind the latest Cal-
Stanford competition. I Jowever. this seem
ingly normal face-off follows a higher call
ing. On April 4. Stanford men's squash will
travel to C'al to play both a regular and an
alumni match in order to help C'al raise
money to replace courts currently in faulty
condition.
"The C a I coach and I decided t his would
be a good opportunity to raise funds and
raise awareness." Talbott said. "We're just
hoping we can help them raise awareness
They really need new courts."
While Stanford practices on new squash
courts that opened three years ago in the
Arrillaga ( enter for Sports and Recreation.
Cal has been suffering for many years, play
ing on slippery floors, in dark lighting and
amid stale smells. Over the years, as the
courts have deteriorated. ( al squash coach
Ashley Kayler believes it has absolutely af
fected his team.
"The poor state of the courts has hurt the
program in ways that are not easy to quan
tify," he said.
But he and the rest of his team look for

ward to a concrete vision of what the C'al
squash program could he like with the
addition of money and support.
"A nicer facility, where all the courts are
in the same area- not divided hv three
floor stairwell and two security nates
would make practices seem less divided,
and allow the coach to work with each ol
the players more easily" Kavler said. With
the improvement of the facilities, he hopes
to attract more and better players.as well as
a highly qualified coaching stall
But Kavler recognizes the underlying is
sues that will require the money, time and
effort of many to li\ the program from the
ground up.
"There are ground water leakage issues
in the 'dungeon' courts." he said. " These is
sues are very [expensive] to fix. and given
the perennial budget deficits in ( alifornia.
unlikely to get fixed. And while there are
water issues, the university is unwilling to
renovate the courts for fear of water dam
age to the new courts."
While this alumni match will make a
start towards raising the first hinds towards
updating ( als facilities, it will only serve as
a jumping off point from which to base tin
ther fundraising efforts Ihe team hopes
eventually to raise over a million
dollars, and the Stanford team stands
behind them 100 percent.
"Originally. Cal had offered to do
a joint match to promote both pro
grams," Talbott said. "But I felt we
should promote one strong message.
My idea was to make the entire focus
on helping Cal."
As Talbott has built up the Stan
ford squash endowment and spear
headed fundraising on the Farm, he
would appear to be more than quali
fied to aid the Golden Bears in their
time of need. But some at Stanford
might find the very idea troubling:
Why should the Cardinal colors be
used to help the school's greatest
rival, while receiving nothing in re
turn? In fact, this support goes to
wards not only that school across the
Bay. but furthers the entire dream of
the future for West ( oast squash.

First, as any true Cardinal fan
knows, rivalries are only exciting
when both teams have the potential
to take home the victory. Since Stan
ford men's squash has played far
more strongly than Cal's in recent
years. Talbott hopes to bolster the
competition by revamping the Cal
facilities. Not only will the existing
Cal-Stanford rivalry help generate
more funds from blue-and-yellow
bleeding alumni, but as Cal im
proves, it will push Stanford to keep
up. The squash programs will nour
ish in sync, and so the vision for more
exciting competitions has rallied
support from both schools.
"We don't have a great rivalry
right now because they don't have a
great team."Talbott said."They want
a better team. We'd like to have a
better rivalry."
Broadening the outlook from just
two schools, the Cardinal squash
team believes the publicity from this
fundraising, and from the ever-im
proving rivalry, will push the sport
forward along the West Coast.
Squash, typically pictured in gentri

fied Ivy League halls and New Eng
land prep school gymnasiums, has
yet to reach the same heights of pop
ularity out west. Talbott and Kayler
hope to instigate increased western
interest.
"[Squash] has really grown at a
collegiate level, and it's just amazing
how it's started to boom out here,"
Talbott said. "C'al recently formed a
women's team; it's quite exciting.
[With the better facilities] it will be
nice to see Cal and Stanford making
inroads to the national rankings."
Stanford's work for Cal demon
strates that sometimes rivalries need
to be overcome for the bigger pic
ture and the good of the sport. It also
shows,however, that sometimes,aid
ing an enemy can sometimes boost
two opponents at the same time.
Riding in the stream of these ideas,
the Beat ( al banner will continue to
fly at Stanford, perhaps someday for
a squash match, as well as before Big
Game.
