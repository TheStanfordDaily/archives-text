# WOMEN'S GYMNASTICS
## Stanford falls short in Pac-10 
### KENAN JIANG STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford women's gymnastics
team finished third at the Pacific-10
C "onference ( Tiampionships this season
and was not able to defend its confer
ence title from a year ago. Stanford
lacked the depth of If( I A, which fin
ished with 196.725 points. I he Cardinal
finished third with 196.525 points.
Stanford was led by the Pac-10 all
around champion, junior ( arly Janiga.
as well as senior Nicole Ourada, who
won two Pac-10 individual titles. Jani
ga s performance continues the strong
tradition of all-around titles at Stanford,
as Cardinal gymnasts have won the all
around four times in the last six years at
the Pac-10 Championships.
Stanford head coach Kristen Smyth
won Coach of the Year honors as the
Cardinal took four out of five individual
titles.This was Smyth's fourth C oath of
the Year award after eight seasons with
Stanford.
The ('ardinal was on the verge of re
peating as conference champions going
into the final rotation, but two poor
floor exercise routines resulted in a sub
optimal finish. UCLA and Oregon
State then took advantage of the Cardi
nal's poor final rotation and overcame
Stanford's lead by nailing their final
routines.
"Going into Pac-lOs. we wanted to
compete like we train in practice." Jani
ga said."lf we did that, without a doubt
we would have had another Pac-lOtitle.
Unfortunately, we had some mistakes
in the final event, which made us drop
below I 'CI .A and OSU.When it conies

to championship meets, it doesn't mat
ter how many personal bests that you
have if you have to count a fall. You just
can't miss."
Janiga notched the balance beam
title with a score of 9.95. The Cardinal
was also aided by Ourada. who tied for
first on the floor exercise and was one of
four athletes, including Janiga. to tie for
first on the uneven bars with a score of
9.9.
Stanford sophomore Shelley
Alexander stepped up with three per
sonal bests. Senior captain Kelly Fee
also brought her best performance on
the bars.beam andfloor.earningat least
9.825 on all three. She was especially in
strumental in replacing injured fresh
man Alyssa Brown on the bars, where
she earned one of her three personal
bests.
"Our goals going into Pac-lOs were
to hit 24 for 24 routines, which is always
our goal in any meet." Ourada said."We
knew that was what it was going to take
to win the Pac-10 title. We were also try
ing to improve each routine by .05."
"At practice we have been working
on cleaning up details in our routines.so
our goal was to make these changes in
our routines at the competition." she
continued."The key to winning Pac-lOs
is hitting 24 for 24 routines. When you
have to count a miss, it allows the other
teams to sneak in."
On bars. Stanford as a team scored
49.275, with Ourada and Janiga leading
the way. both scoring 9.9s as five girls
tied for first. Stanford.however,tallied a
9.675 on the beam, on its way to a
49.125. which proved devastating to the
Cardinal's chances at the Pac-10 title.

UCLA led the nation in the vault, hut
did not stick its routine at Pac-l()s. Stan
ford followed up with two falls on the
floor routine, but Janiga and Ourada
salvaged the floor exercise by scoring
9.85 and 9.9. respectively. Stanford's
mistake cost them the title, as UCLA
won its 14th Pac-10 title.
Overall, Stanford had a very solid
meet with Janiga. Alexander and junior
Allvse Ishino earning first-team all
conference selections, while Fee and
Ourada earned second-team selections.
Hie Stanford team will go on to the
N'CA A Regional on April 4. ranked as
the No. 1 seed at the NCAA South Cen
tral Regional in Fayetteville.Ark.
Stanford is ranked fourth overall in
the country and will compete against
No. 2 Arkansas. No. 3 Michigan, No. 4
Arizona. No. 5 Southern Utah and No.
6 Arizona State. The top teams at the
Regional will advance to the NCAA
Championships in Lincoln, Neb. April
16-18.
"We are glad that this didn't happen
at the Regional competition." Janiga
said,referring to the Cardinal's final few
mistakes. "We learned that the meet
isn't over until the last person finishes
their routine. A lot can happen on the
last event, which can be a good or bad
thing.
"Regionals should be a good com
petition, "she continued."and we will go
into it again with the same goals as be
fore: doing what we train, hitting our 24
routines and focusing our attention on
us."
