# CONQUERING UCONN
## Cardinal just two wins away from national title 
### NATE ADAMS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Pacific-10 Conference Cham
pion Stanford women's basketball
team is headed to St. Louis this week
end for its second consecutive appear
ance in the NCAA Tournament's Final
Four. The Cardinal will square off
against undefeated Connecticut in
semifinal play on Sunday evening,
where a win would send them to Tues
day's championship game against ei
ther Louisville or Oklahoma, and give
the Cardinal a shot at its third national
title.
Stanford and UConn are both en
tering familiar territory, having last
played each other in the 2()()<S semifi
nals. The No. 2 Cardinal (34-4. 17-1
Pac-10) emerged victorious in that
meeting, defeating the Huskies 82-73
before losing toTennessee in the finals.
Stanford boasts an all-time record of 5-
3 against UConn. including a 2-1
record in tournament play.
This year's Connecticut team (37-0.
16-0 Big East) is only two wins away
from its program's sixth national title
and undoubtedly poses the biggest
challenge Stanford has faced all sea
son. The I luskiesjed by Cieno Auriem
ma in his 24th season as head coach,
entered the tournament as the top
overall seed and have been ranked No.
I in both national polls all season.They
remain undefeated since losing to the
Cardinal a year ago, and perhaps more
impressively, have not won by less than
10 points over that span. The Huskies
boast two Wade Trophy finalists on
their roster. Maya Moore and Renee
Montgomery; each is averaging nearly
20 points per game. Hie Huskies are
widely favored to defeat Stanford in
Sunday's rematch.
Despite the national media's exten
sive and favorable coverage of
UConn, the Cardinal remains un
daunted by the highly touted zero in
Connecticut's loss column. Stanford

NOTES .' The second-seeded Stanford women
will take on their sport's top dog on Sunday,
when they face UConn in the Final Four round
of the NCAA Tournament. The Huskies have
not lost a game yet this season, and it hasn't
even been close. Connecticut has won by at
least 10 points in each of its games this sea
son. Stanford was the last team to defeat
UConn in the semifinal round of the NCAA
Tournament last year. The Cardinal is coming
off of a dominant, 74-53 win over lowa State
in which junior Jayne Appel scored a team
record 46 points.

head coach Tara VanDerveer empha
sized that the outcome of Sunday's
game depends not on past statistics or
what is said about the teams in ques
tion. but on what actually unfolds on
the court.
"UConn gets a lot of press and at
tention, but they still need to come out

and play." she said. "They still travel,
they still foul — there's so much hy
perbole [surrounding them). Let's just
play the game. Let's roll it out and see
what we've got."
While it always helps to look on the
positive side of things regardless of the
situation. Stanford has some very real
reasons to be optimistic. One is its re
cent stretch of great play: indeed, al
though UConn has effectively coasted
from win to win for an entire season,
the Cardinal enters Sunday's game rid
ing a no-smaller wave of momentum.
Stanford is fresh off both tournament
and regular-season conference cham
pionships. and currently owns a 20-
game winning streak that dates back to
Jan. IS. The Cardinal extended its
dominant plav into the NCAA Tour
nament, winning three of its four tour
nament contests by over 20 points.
No Cardinal player has felt this mo
mentum more than junior center Jayne
Appel. who bested Candice Wiggins'
'OS school record for points in a game
when she scored 46 against lowa State
on Monday. Appel. a Wade Trophy fi
nalist herself, was honored as the Pac
-10 Player of the Week four times this
season and is a member of the Associ
ated Press Ail-American Second
ream. Her recent string of particularly
dominant performances has lent Stan
ford at least a measure of hope going
into its game against the undefeated
I luskies.
Appel agreed with VanDerveer
that the aura surrounding UConn
means nothing compared with what
actually takes place during their game.
"Last year. [UConn was] 'sup
posed' to win it as well." she recalled.
"It's important to not be intimidated
— they're going to make some shots,
so are we.They're going to make some
rebounds, so are we. That's why you
play the game: to see who wins. It all
happens on the court."


AGUSTIN RAMIREZ/The Stanford Daily
Stanford may have yet another,
less apparent advantage: its losses.
VanDerveer, recalling her time at
the helm of an undefeated Olympic
team, knows all too well that a per
fect season, while impressive. doesn't
teach lessons or foster the fierce
tenacity of a team that has mound

out plenty of close wins, while also
e x per ie n ci n g de fe at.
"UConn has a terrific team, we
know this," she said. "But our losses
have taught us things. We've learned
and benefited from them, and we're
in a situation where we're playing
very well right now. We learn a lot
from a h*ss — I can't deal with an un
defeated team."
Jillian Harmon, the only senior
likely to start for Stanford on Sim
day. agreed with her coach as she
heads into what she hopes is not her

last game in a Cardinal uniform.
"We're definitely tested, and that
will help us." she said. "We're confi
dent in a close game."
Stanford and Connecticut begin
their semifinal matchup on Sunday
at 6:30 p.m. PL The game will be tel
evised from St. Louis's Scottrade
Center on ESPN, while it will also be

"UConn has a terrific team, we
know this," she said. "But our losses
have taught us things. We've learned
and benefited from them, and we're
in a situation where we're playing
very well right now. We learn a lot
from a h*ss — I can't deal with an un
defeated team."
Jillian Harmon, the only senior
likely to start for Stanford on Sim
day. agreed with her coach as she
heads into what she hopes is not her

last game in a Cardinal uniform.
"We're definitely tested, and that
will help us." she said. "We're confi
dent in a close game."
