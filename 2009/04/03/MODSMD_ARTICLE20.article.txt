## No. 1 Stanford rolls into spring 
### MIKE LAZARUS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the Stanford student body was
relaxing on the beach over Spring
Break, the No. 1 Stanford women's
water polo team was busy in the
pool, winning five games in seven
days with an average margin of victo
ry of more than eight goals per game.
Stanford's final game of the week
against No. 17 Cal State-Long Beach
was its toughest outing.The Cardinal
persevered against the 4 l )ers in a de
fensive struggle, winning 7-2. It was
the first time that Stanford failed to
reach double-digits in scoring since
the second game of the season.
Stanford jumped out to a 3-0 lead
at the end of the first period, ensur
ing a Cardinal victory early on. Ju
nior goalkeeper Amber Oland's
seven saves anchored the Cardinal's
defense, which has been steadily im
proving ewer the second half of the
season.
"We held Long Beach to two
goals in 12 power play chances and
no even-strength goals." head coach
John Tanner said. "That was one of
our better defensive efforts this sea
son."
On the offensive side of the ball,
freshmen Melissa Seidemann had a
game-high two goals, while senior
Lauren Silver, junior Kelly Eaton,
sophomore Kelly Kruegerand fresh
men Alvssa Lo and Pallavi Menon
each scored once.
The victory extended Stanford's
win streak to 17 games and improved
the Cardinal's record to 20-1 on the
season.
Stanford kicked off its Southern
California swing with an 11-5 victory
over No. 16 UC-San Diego on March
24.'ITie Tritons managed to pull off a
feat only accomplished by a few
teams this season — taking a lead
against the Cardinal. San Diego
scored two quick goals to open the
match.but that would prove to be the

GAME NOTES: The top-ranked Cardinal
women are set to take on the No. 3 Bruins
tonight at 6 p.m. Stanford has lost just one
game this season, all the way back on Feb. 7
against (JSC. The Cardinal has since won 1 7
straight, including a 10-5 win over UCLA on
Feb. 8. Stanford has been led offensively by
freshman Melissa Seidemann, with 50 goals
on the season, including two in the team's
most recent win over Long Beach.

only time it led.
In the final four minutes of the
first period. Silver and fellow seniors
Koree Blyleven and Kira Hillman
scored three unanswered goals to
give Stanford the lead. Two more
three-goal periods put the game out
of reach. Junior Kim Hall took care
of business in the goal, blocking five
shots.
The most important match of the
road trip was its only conference
match, a contest with No. 7 San
Diego State on March 25. Stanford
knocked off the A/tecs 11-6 to re
main undefeated in Mountain Pacif
ic Sports Federation (MPSF) play.
Entering the second period with a
slim, 3-2 lead, Stanford's defense,
with Oland in the cage, shut out San
Diego to allow the offense to give the
Cardinal a little breathing room.Two
goals later, Stanford went into hall
time up by three.
After each team scored twice in
the third period, the Cardinal
outscored the A/tecs 4-2 in the
fourth to cement the win. Seidemann

led Stanford with four goals, with Sil
ver tacking on another hat trick.
While the San Diego State victory
was the most significant in terms of
the postseason, the March 21 match
against Harvard was perhaps the
most gratifying for Stanford.
The Cardinal did not show its
East Coast academic rival any hospi
tality, simply dismantling the Crim
son, 20-2. Stanford jumped out to a 7-
0 lead by the end of the first period
and was up 12-0 at hall time. The
Crimson managed to score twice on
Hall in the third period, hut eight sec
ond-half Stanford goals drowned out
any chance of a comeback. Twelve
Cardinal players scored in the match,
with Silver and Blyleven leading the
way with three goals apiece.
Stanford will return to MPSF play
tomorrow against No. 3 UCLA. The
Cardinal knocked off the Bruins ear
lier in the season 10-5, but both
teams have undergone considerable
transformations since then.
Stanford was without Silver in the
first match-up, which forced the of
fense to rely on Seidemann and
Eaton. Since Silver's return, oppos
ing defenses have been unable to
slow down the Cardinal's multi
pronged offensive attack.
The Bruins are 21-3 on the season,
including two one-goal losses to No.
2 USC and No. 4 Hawaii. UCLA is
peaking at the right time, riding a 10-
game win streak into the Stanford
contest.
"UCLA has several dynamic, ath
letic goal scorers who present chal
lenges in all phases of offense," Tan
ner said. "We hope to slow them
down and take advantage of the op
portunities we expect to generate."
Hie final home game of the sea
son for the Cardinal is set to begin at
6 p.m. tonight in Avery Aquatic Cen
ter.
