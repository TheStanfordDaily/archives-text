# "Monsters vs. Aliens"
## A 						fun flick for the family...but that's about it 
### 
Everyone loves epic clashes. Who doesn't love the idea of
taking two destructive forces and pitting them against
one another? Such classic examples from film history
include "Freddy vs. Jason", "Alien vs. Predator", and my per
sonal favorite "Godzilla vs. King Kong." The main reason
these film crossovers do so well is that fans of both franchises
are always eager to fiock to the theater to see if their favorites
come out on top. In a way, these films become a kind of com
petitive spectacle - like rooting for your favorite sports team
during a game.
So where does Dreamworks' latest animated adventure,
"Monsters vs. Aliens," fall into this category? Well, if you're

looking for an all-out crazy war
between flying saucers and mon
sters, 1 have to say that you

might be a bit disappointed
in "Monsters vs. Aliens."

Instead of delivering a
humorous and visually

stunning animated war
between these two factions,
Dreamworks

decided to
focus on the
family
friendly issues

of friendship and
acceptance. Of course,
focusing on these topics

is not inherently bad — this is a family oriented movie after
all — but naming this flick "Monsters vs. Aliens" does create
a certain level of expectation for audiences above the age of
12 — an expectation that is never fully realized.
Unmet expectations aside, the film still has a lot going

for it. The story starts off with a bang (literally), when the
movie's heroine, Susan (voiced by Reese Witherspoon), is
clobbered by an alien meteor that transforms her into a giant
that is later renamed "Ginormica." The newly changed Susan
is then whisked away by the government to be confined in a
secret facility — think Area 51 but for monsters. Here, she
gets to know her fellow non-human comrades which consist
of: Dr. Cockroach, a mad scientist that is half human and half
cockroach; 8.0.8., an indestructible yet brainless gelatinous
blob; The Missing Link, a muscle-bound fish creature; and
finally Insectasaurous — think Godzilla but instead of a
lizard, it's a giant, cute grub.

If is in these characters where I think this film truly
shines. Like most animated films nowadays,
H, the voice acting is all done bv well-known

actors. "Monsters vs. Aliens" is no excep
tion. In addition to Witherspoon's voicing
of Susan,

her fellow monsters
are voiced by the likes of Hugh Laurie, Seth
Rogan, and Will Arnett, while other peripheral
characters arc voiced by Paul Rudd, Rainn
Wilson, and Kiefer Sutherland, just to name a

few. The voice work throughout the film is pret
ty spot on and you can tell that the actors real
ly do get into their animated roles. Seth
■■ Rogan is absolutely perfect as 8.0.8.
pretty much all of his lines are hilarious
Bp and mad props to Hugh Laurie who cre
j?, ates a completely new and unique voice for
■ his role as Dr. Cockroach.
Getting back to the story, Susan
and her fellow monsters get a chance to win

O
their freedom when they are charged with fighting off a mys
terious alien threat that has invaded Earth. The story then
takes an interesting turn when the aliens abduct Susan. The
film's climax occurs when Susan's monster friends embark on
a daring mission to rescue her, which results in a final show-

down between the monsters and the
aliens. The storyline here is
surprisingly well-written;

there are a fair share of plot
twists and insightful

character develop
ment.
Even though the
monsters do indeec
fight the aliens in

this film, it really is not as
epic as it sounds, which
brings me back to my ini
tial problem with the
movie mentioned earlier.
By framing this film .is a
versus" story we think that

that's what the movie is all about —
monsters fighting aliens. I lowever,
much of the actual "fighting" is
spread out and far in between
in the film. The rest of the
film consists of fillers, jokes, and antics
that cater more to the younger crowd.

Unlike other animated films such as "The Incredibles"
and "Wall-F" — movies that do a great job appeasing audi
ences of all ages — "Monsters vs. Aliens" only really succeeds
in entertaining the younger demographic.
Finally, one last thing that I should mention about this film is
that its in 3-D (complete with the glasses and everything).
I his was actually my first 3-1) movie ever, but I will say that
although it definitely made the film look cooler, it (Jul not by
all means revolutionize my overall experience. On that note,
if you are out with your family or with younger siblings, this
would be a great and fun choice. But, if you're with your fel
low college buddies and looking to check out a movie, you
might want to look elsewhere. Now it only they would make
a Pirates vs. Ninjas movie ...
