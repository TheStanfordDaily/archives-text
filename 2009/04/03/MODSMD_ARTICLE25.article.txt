## Not too fast, but sometimes furious 
### 
£ £ Fast and Furious" has all the elements one would expect
from a movie about street racing and drug dealers —
lots of gorgeous cars, gorgeous women, heart-racing
chases, gratuitous lesbianism, a "we're not so different, you
and I relationship between good badass and bad badass and
many, many explosions. The film begins in the Dominican
Republic, where the first ot these explosions takes place as
familiar racer Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his girlfriend
! etty (Michelle Rodriguez) attempt to hijack a gasoline
.inker-truck.
['he story quickly shifts to L.A., where street-racing, dou
le-crossing undercover cop Brian O Conner (Paul Walker) is
vorking on infiltrating the heroin trafficking cartel of myste
rious drug-dealer Braga through the organization's use ot
mport-racers to transport the product. Meanwhile, Toretto's
gasoline heist stirs up too much heat for the daredevil to
land, forcing him to flee the Domincan Republic and part
vavs with Letty. Toretto eventually ends up in L.A. too, where
l turns out Letty has been murdered by the same people
3'Conner is investigating. Toretto quickly gets back into his
-Id racing contacts looking for leads on Letty s murderer, but
ipparently things have changed in the time he - been away,
md as a grease monkey reminds him, 'this ain t 112 his i scene
invmore, dawg.' Soon, he and O'Conner arc back racing

together tor a spot on Braga's drug-driving
team, who move heroin through the desert
along the Mexico/U.S. border through a sys
tem of tunnels constructed specifically to
somehow to evade the Feds.
"Fast and Furious" is at its best when the
i ai's are racing in intense sequences of speed
and stunt. Diesel and Walker race the police,

the drug dealers and even each other, in one of 1
the mm ie's best scenes. The racing and revving I
is truly entertaining and embody entertainment |
in the gripping and most basic sense of the
word. The trouble is, when the cars aren't mov
ing, nothing else is. When Diesel and Walker are
not sitting in their driver's seats, the film slows to
a diorama-still pace. Manv of the film's non-rac
ing scenes indeed seem to have been calculated in
just this way — as frozen tableaus, rather than as

moving pictures. The action in "Fast and Furious" separates
itself into dialogue and motion, wooden figures and expres
sive machines: only when the cars are speeding and swerving

does the film move forward in
any meaningful way for the audi
ence and for the spectator.
Some of Diesel's one-liners
would be effective, funny or
powerful if they hadn't been
delivered in such a granite mon
otone. But despite the occasional
moments of emotion or of steely
badass ballsiness in the script,
Diesel and Walker deliver these
lines haltingly and ineffectively,
i he two are no more, in most
scenes, than the cardboard
cutouts that promoted the film
in theatre lobbies. The cars are
the films true actors; their crash
es howling engines and smoking
tires are far more expressive than
Diesel's pudgy stoicism. "Fast
and Furious"' is designed to
entertain, and the plot and the
dialogue are really onlv present

as necessary filler between
races and chases — t he chas
sis to hold the film s figura
tive "ten-second car togeth
er.
That's not to say the
movie doesn't aim for
grand moments — some
parts of "Fast and
Furious" aspire to a long
lasting literary relevance
— doubtlessly the writ
ers' attempt to appeal to
a deeper subject matter
than revving engines and
crunching sheet-metal.
In a Shakespearian turn

toward the end of the film, Torctto stands over Braga
with an immense shotgun as the drug dealer prays at the altar
of his church. "You're not saved" is the movie's stand-in for
"That would be scanned." But Vin Diesel doesn't have to

struggle with consequences or with indecision — he has the
;ilt of being able to "do the right thing." Diesel's hulking,
'rulf magnanimity has no complexity and moral quandary
for all the film's claims of good guy/bad guy ambiguity) but
s instead stone fixity and basso boldness. As for Diesel's
naintenance of his marginally declining body it's just a hair
\ist its action-hero youth.
Still, "Fast and Furious has its bright spots. The opening
v-ene is rousing and exciting, as are all of the action
icquences, and lohn Ortiz throws in a great performance as
Saga's second-hand man, Campos. And the cars — gleani
ng, snorting, chromed — look gorgeous and alluring. The
novie thrives on bare skin and bare sheet-metal, taught and
nolded to form, and what more can we really ask for as we
runch our popcorn?
