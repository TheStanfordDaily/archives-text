## A 						disappointment in "Duplicity" 
### 
If there is one strictly positive thing to say about
"Duplicity," it's that it certainly lives up to its name. lust
as the title suggests, there are indeed two sides to this film
— on one side, the charm of the cast, and on the other, the
disappointment of the rest of the cinematic elements.
Starring Clive Owen ("Inside Man,""Closer,""Children of
Men") opposite Julia Roberts ("Pretty Woman," "Mona Lisa
Smile," "Closer") and peppered with appearances by Paul
Giamatti and Carrie Preston, "Duplicity" looks set to be a
smash-hit based solely on its outstanding choice of cast.
If one added together the brilliance of Clive Owen with
the return of Julia Roberts to the big screen, one would
expect a far better movie than "Duplicity." From the opening
scene, however, "Duplicity" promises to be a tough film to

navigate. It is, quite frankly, far too
confusing — any fun moments are
quickly overwhelmed by a sense
of bewilderment, and not in

a good way. Unlike the
intrigue and mind-gripping
mystery of the wildly popu
lar "bourne" trilogy,
"Duplicity" offers only layer
upon layer of unnecessary
details that clutter the audi
ence's minds. In fact, it is
difficult to believe that both
stories are products of the

same writer/director, Tony Gilroy.
While there is a great deal of chemistry and excitement
surrounding the dynamic duo of Owen and Roberts, their
skill alone is not enough to counter the unfortunately mis
guided script and plotline. The movie follows the adventures
of suave former MI-6 Agent Ray Koval (Owen) and alluring
former CIA officer Claire Stenwick (Roberts) as the two
engage in a corporate death match spearheaded by Burkett
and Randle CEO Howard Tully (Wilkinson) and Equikrom
CEO Dick Garsik (Giamatti). "Duplicity" attempts to chann<
all the fun of the "Oceans" series while maintaining the sus
pense of the "Bourne" movies. These objectives arc thwarted
however, by the "trying-too-hard" nature of the plot.
Though the movie features breathtaking vistas of Italy
and other countries, snippets of witty dialogue, as well as a
plethora of romantic moments between clandestine lovers
Koval and Stenwick, it does not explore any one plot avenue
fully. The movie instead tries to take on too much in the rela
tively short span (two hours and five minutes) of the film.

Rather than working together and building on one
another, the various elements of the plot and script
merely coexist in cacophony — twist after twist is
introduced, only to vanish as quickly as they
appeared, leaving the viewers cold at the antidimac
tic ending of the film. Indeed, the movie may well
have been better titled "Complexity." In the end, tin
entire viewing experience for this film can be sum
marized by its tagline: "Outwit. Outspy. Outsmart.
Outplay. Then get out."
