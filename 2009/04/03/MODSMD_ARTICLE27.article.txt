## The
						latest horror movie rehash... 
### 
The horror genre is not one that is highly
respected amongst moviegoers. In most
cases, horror audiences are divided into
two groups: the die-hard fans that will pay to sec
any classic horror remake. Then there is the
other 75% of the population that either hates
horror films because it requires them to cover
their eyes for 90 minutes, or because nearly every
one made in the last ten years has been lacklus

the killers end up in the home of one of the girls
parents as drifters, looking for a temporary place
to stay. By the end of the film, the parents find
out that their guests are the people who killed
their daughter and murder them all.
The movie's promotional poster featured
the infamous and chilling tagline "Mari, seven
teen, is dying. Even for her, the worst is yet to
come!" When the original version was released, it
shocked audiences with its brutality and graphic
depictions of rape and disembowelment. While
many critics initially dismissed this as cheap
exploitation, the movie itself later garnered
praise as a unique tale of revenge. Regardless of
the criticism, Wes Craven's movie was immedi
ately solidified as a classic in the minds of horror
fanatics, which catapulted Craven to fame.
Fast-forward to 2009 and we have the
remake, which made some slight — but notice
able — changes in characterization and plot. For
one, Mari, the main character of the two girls,
