## The 						latest horror movie rehash... 
### 
The horror genre is not one that is highly
respected amongst moviegoers. In most
cases, horror audiences are divided into
two groups: the die-hard fans that will pay to sec
any classic horror remake. Then there is the
other 75% of the population that either hates
horror films because it requires them to cover
their eyes for 90 minutes, or because nearly every
one made in the last ten years has been lacklus
ter. Keeping that in consideration, "Last House
on The Left" is a horror movie remake, which
probably makes it automatically a no-go for
many movie buffs. While this horror movie was
by no means great, that should not be expected.
Horror movies tend to abide by a different set of
standards anyway.
A bit about the origins of the film: in 1972,
Wes Craven directed the original "Last House on
The Left" and caused every stomach on his set
and in the movie's audience to take a nosedive.
The movie tells the story of two teenage girls
from good homes with loving parents who are
just trying to score some good weed. Instead,
they are kidnapped, tortured, raped, and mur

dercd by three criminal escapees who leave their
mangled bodies in the midst of a densely wood
ed area. In an unexpected Shakespearean twist,
the killers end up in the home of one of the girls
parents as drifters, looking for a temporary place
to stay. By the end of the film, the parents find
out that their guests are the people who killed
their daughter and murder them all.
The movie's promotional poster featured
the infamous and chilling tagline "Mari, seven
teen, is dying. Even for her, the worst is yet to
come!" When the original version was released, it
shocked audiences with its brutality and graphic
depictions of rape and disembowelment. While
many critics initially dismissed this as cheap
exploitation, the movie itself later garnered
praise as a unique tale of revenge. Regardless of
the criticism, Wes Craven's movie was immedi
ately solidified as a classic in the minds of horror
fanatics, which catapulted Craven to fame.
Fast-forward to 2009 and we have the
remake, which made some slight — but notice
able — changes in characterization and plot. For
one, Mari, the main character of the two girls,

went from average 17 year-old to a superstar swimmer — an aspect
that becomes somewhat crucial to her survival, which brings up
another change... she doesn't die in the re-make. Despite having
been raped and shot as she attempts to escape by swimming, Mari

v2.0 is miraculously able to
drag her body to shore and
crawl to the front steps of her

parents summerhouse. Initially,
this seemed to be a minor detail, but in

retrospect, it lessens the bit
tersweet tinge of revenge
that the parents were feel
ing by the end of the orig
inal movie. Somehow,
I letting Mari live is at
once both a bright spot
amongst a dark plot, but
also a sign that the film
has simply been dumb
ed down to fit contempo-

rary Hollywood tastes.
If you go watch "Last I louse on the Left," you will undoubted
ly spend the first 30 to 40 minutes yawning and checking your
watch, as the first half is ridden with awkward, almost embarrassing
dialogue and blase characters. Fven the villains arc laughable and
not quite sadistic enough to cause a hard-

ened horror fan to tremble. Also strange
were the relationship dynamics, which
were underdeveloped, thereby making it
even more difficult for the actors to make
their exchanges seem normal. It also does
n't help that 17-year-old Man has a mom
who doesn't seem to be more than ten
years older than her.
The second half of the film, however, is
much more interesting. Director Dennis
lliadis is far from breaking any new cine
matic ground or setting a milestone in
horror directing, but that did not seem to
be his intent with this remake from the

beginning. Great horror films tend to come when directors and
screenwriters get sick of using creaking door hinges and cliche
background music crescendos to get their points across, and there
fore decide to do something a little different. In this case, Hindis
does not get any bonus points for innovation but he certainly does
keep the audience — myself included — entertained during the
ultimate vengeful ending. While "The Last House on the Left" cer
tainly needed more character development and better dialogue, its
violent premise and effective directing nonetheless left a significant
impact.
