## "Grease:" Lightnin' tracks, groovin' dances 
### 
There are plenty of subtly insightful books
and films that we experience at a young
age but only truly understand once we are
older. When I was in grade school, 1 adored the
film "Grease," starring John Travolta and Olivia
Newton-John. But only now, as a college student,
do I realize that huge parts of the plot, like
Rizzo's unexpected pregnancy and the entire
concept of a "greaser," had gone completely over
my head. That's why when 1 headed to San
Francisco's Golden Gate Theater last week for the
local premiere of the national tour of "Grease," I
was hoping to get a second chance at under
standing the innuendos and appreciating the
humor and meaning of the story.
Sadly, it was not meant to be. A sing- and
dance-along to '50s tunes before the start of the
show set a nostalgic, lighthearted mood, but 1

On April 3 and 4, Cardinal Ballet
Company will present its annual
Urban Nights: Dance Fusion perform
ances. Joining the ballerinas will be
Basmaati Raas, Bent Spoon, dvB, Jam
Pac'd, Los Salseros, Stanford Chinese
Dance, Swingtime, Tap Th@t,
Troposomatic and Urban Styles. On
the program arc pieces by student and
guest choreographers, in addition to
re-stagings of traditional and classical
pieces. This diverse set of dance per
formance groups will share the stage
at Dinkelspiel Auditorium on Friday
and Saturday nights at 8 p.m.
Admission for students is free with
SUID, and tickets can be picked up at
lunchtime in White Plaza throughout
the week.

was quickly dismayed by the noticeable lack of
chemistry between Sandy and Danny, the romantic
leads. Sandy comes off as cold and distant, even
while singing, and Danny seems disinterested in the
entire affair. Rizzo, the leader of the Pink Ladies
with a reputation for getting around, was far less
soulful than I would have hoped, thereby diminish
ing the impact of the character as a foil for virginal
Sandy. The rest of the supporting cast is relatively
solid — particularly the supporting female charac
ters — and the chorus numbers are fun and busy.
The stage settings, like the costumes, are kitschy and
colorful, and 1 couldn't help but smile during
"Greased Lightnin,'" when a junker is transformed
into a shiny red racecar on stage.
"Grease" is billed as starring "American Idol"
winner Taylor Hicks. Hicks is lovably hammy in his
Teen Idol role as he descends from a giant ice cream

cone over a diner to sing to Frenchie, the beauty school dropout, in a
sparkly suit. His bluesy voice is not really suited for musicals —
most of his song's words are pretty garbled — but you have to give
him credit for getting into the role.
Though "Grease" boasts a vocally talented cast, slick technical
production and energetic choreography, the acting is suspect and the
show offers little in terms of substance. As it turns out, "Grease ' has
undergone several makeovers over the years. Originally a raunchy,
sexually charged musical, it was toned down considerably to satisfy
censors for the 1978 film. Two subsequent revivals, intended to make
the stage show more like the film, have stripped the show of nearly
all of its remaining grit and social commentary, leaving behind a
vapid, borderline plot-less show. The saving grace of the whole affair
is the music, which has a pop sensibility that is as satisfying as a hot
fudge sundae loaded with whipped cream.
Don't get me wrong: despite its flaws, "Grease" is a pretty tasty
pop confection. Hut it's like what your mom used to tell you —
dessert is not a meal. If you're looking for a night at the theater and
are willing to drop some money on tickets, by all means go check
out the show. Otherwise, you might be better off with a pint of
Rocky Road, a hairbrush microphone and an evening on the couch
singing along with the movie.
