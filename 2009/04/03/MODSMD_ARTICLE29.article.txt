# Diplo starts spring quarter off right with dope concert at XOX
## 
### 
Spring quarter got off to a bumping start Tuesday night
as the Stanford Concert Network (SCN) brought DJ
Diplo to the Stanford campus for a free concert on the
Chi Theta Chi front lawn. Diplo, short for Diplodocus (yes,
as in the dinosaur,) is a Philadelphia-based DJ, producer
and record-label manager known for inventive remixes of
contemporary songs, as well as for supporting more obscure
genres of music like Brazilian Baile Funk. Also famous for
producing for hip-hop darling M.I.A. and for his solo work
' and other collaborations, Diplo was a much-anticipated vis
itor to the Stanford music scene.
Perhaps expecting that they'd need some fun after a
long first day of class, eager students snatched up every tick
et for the show within 15 minutes of release time.

Undeterred by their lack of tickets, other fans lined up
around the block at Theta Chi to get a chance to see the
show. Fortunately, the lawn provided ample room for all the
hopeful concert-goers, and clear skies and mild tempera
tures, often unusual for the first week of the spring, made
the outdoor venue rather pleasant.
Issues with the speakers delayed the start of the open
ing act, DJ Dillon Alexandra, but with a required end time
of 11 p.m.,Diplo went on as planned at 9:30 p.m. His set
sampled heavily from familiar songs, from Nirvana to Lady
Gaga, with, of course, multiple musical references to his col
laborator and former paramour M.I.A. A remix of the
Diplo-produced M.I.A. track "Paper Planes" toward the end
of the set sent cheers through the closely-packed crowd. The

revelers danfyd close around and on the stage, and more
than a few excited party-goers had to be asked to step down
from a section of the roof off the Chi Theta Chi balcony.
SCN brings all manner of live music to campus.
Recendy, there's been a recent trend toward bringing big
name DJs in addition to bands. Notable concerts within the
past three years include RJD2, Girl Talk and The Hood
Internet, the latter two of which were held in the back and
— front yards of Theta Chi, respectively. SCN representative
Josh Constine '08 told Intermission that Diplo was an obvi
ous choice to bring to campus not only because of "his con-

tributions to the new music landscape, but also because he
can truly rock a party" and because he "exposes new audi
ences to a deeper, less cliche-ed branch of hip-hop." Diplo's
commitment to innovation in hip-hop has led him to work
with other ground-breaking artists like Justice and
Santogold. rfis record label, Mad Decent, has served as an
entry point for Bafle Funk, also called Funk Carioca, a still
developing style originating in Rib de Janeiro that combines
Miami bass music with drum beats from Brazilian instru
ments.
Though all in all the evening proved to be a great time

for anyone looking to dance off the first day of class, one
has to wonder about how the timing of the show affected its
quality. With neighborhood noise restrictions requiring the
show to end by 11 p.m., Diplo was forced to play an hour
and-a-half-long set — far shorter than normal for a DJ and
a restriction that perhaps affected the music he was able to
spin. The music was certainly fun and danceable and
included Diplo's core set of solid material, but the short for
mat prevented fans from hearing some of his more experi
mental remixes. The weeknight timing, even for the first
week of the quarter, also seemed a bit odd, especially since
at eleven the crowd was still full of energy but had no place
to go to continue the party.

Technical snafus and timing aside, a good hour-and-a
half of Diplo was far better than no Diplo at all, and a
Theta Chi dance party was a pretty sweet way to shake off
winter quarter and get ready for spring. Here's hoping SCN
can continue to attract quality DJ concerts to campus and
to feel out the best venues and scheduling options for DJ
shows.
