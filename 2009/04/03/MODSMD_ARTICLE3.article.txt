Despite her stellar accolades.
Penna refuses to take all the credit
for herself.
"Mv team was really behind me
this weekend, played great defense
and came through to score runs in
key situations." Penna told
GoStanford.com. "I'm excited by
how our team is playing right now
and hope to carry that momentum
into the rest of the Pac-10 season."
As she indicates. Penna has not
been the only Stanford player to
excel this season. In fact, she is one
of three Stanford players to recent
ly earn a spot on the 25-person

USA Softball's Collegiate Player
of the Year award watch list. Join
ing her on the list are junior left
fielder Alissa Haber and freshman
shortstop Ashley Hansen.
On the year, Haber is leading
the team with a .441 batting aver
age. 39 runs scored and 10 stolen
bases.
Hansen is right behind her with
a .427 batting average to go along
with 33 RBI.
After facing a menacing slate of
competition last weekend. Stan
ford (31-2. 2-1 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) stands to have an easier time
with Oregon (10-20.0-4) and Ore
gon State (16-16. 1-3) who are cur
rently in last and ninth place in the
Pac-10. respectively.
I he Beavers are coming off a
weekend in which they were swept

at the hands of Arizona and Ari
zona State.
Pitching has been a problem for
Oregon State,as they have failed to
get consistency out of returning
starter Kelly Dyer, who has strug
gled to a 7-11 record. Recently,
freshman Paige Hall has been see
ing more action as a starter with
marginally better success.
Offensively, the Beavers are led
by catcher Audrey Roderfield.The
sophomore leads the team in most
offensive categories, as she is hit
ting .330 with seven home runs and
23 RBI.
The Ducks are still looking for
their first Pac-1() victory, having
started the conference season with
a loss to Oregon State before being
swept in Arizona.
Oregon is led offensively by out

fielder Neena Bryant. The junior is
hitting .357 with four home runs
and 23 RBI on the year.
In the circle. Sam Skillingstad is
the leader of a quartet of pitchers
for the Ducks. Skillingstad is 8-7
with a 2.20 ERA on the season.
Now that it has established itself
as a national power. Stanford
would be disappointed with any
thing less than three victories this
weekend, as the rest of its upcom
ing Pac-10 schedule looks to be in
credibly grueling. Next up for the
Cardinal women after this week
end's action is a three-game set
against California, with the first
contest slated to be played at Stan
ford and the latter two at Berkeley.
