## Hazard the Decemberists a try... You might fall in love 
### 
The Decemberists have always been a band with unique
ambitions — musically experimental, always open to
collaboration and focused on lyrical strength and com
plexity. With their latest work, the concept album/indie rock
opera "The Hazards of Love," they turn their musical ambi
tions toward a perhaps more questionable genre: prog rock.
Depending on your personal taste, the word "prog" can bring
to mind anything from Pink Floyd to Jethro Tull, and can
rouse feelings anywhere from glorious nostalgia to skepticism
and disdain. Add to that many critics' anti-concept album
biases, and it becomes clear the Decemberists are not looking
to appease the masses.
Not that any of this should come as a surprise. The band's
previous album, "The Crane Wife," already showed smatter

ings of progressive rock, with a three-part song cycle based on
a Japanese folk tale. This is because frontman Colin Meloy has
always been fascinated with instilling narrative in music. "The
Hazards of Love," however, is more than just a flirtation with
the genre; it's a complete hour-long, 17-track saga that's full of
Joseph Campbell archetypes — the hero on a quest, the
damsel in distress, the jealous mother — and whose intricate
tale of love and revenge takes more than a couple listens to
fully appreciate.
In a nutshell, it's the story of Margaret (voiced by Becky
Stark of Lavender Diamond), the aforementioned damsel, who
falls in love with a shape-shifter (Meloy), who switches
between faun by day and human by night. His jealous mother,
the forest queen (voiced by Shara Worden of My Brightest
Diamond), schemes for an immoral man to abduct Margaret,
and the two lovers must persevere and sacrifice in order to be

together.
Without breaks
between tracks, the album
morphs smoothly from the
eerie prelude through the i
character introductions, '
action and conflict. True to |
its rock-opera roots, the
songs include musical
motifs for each character,
which return again and
again and signal a change in

scene. Margaret is portrayed with sweet and ethereal refrains
("Isn't it a Lovely Night?"), while the forest queen's appearance
showcases the band's heaviest, riff-laden rock yet ("The
Wanting Comes in Waves / Repaid") — something a bit out of
character for their typically folksy sound. And yet the
Decemberists embrace the genre and its excessive, overdramat
ic qualities — they employ a myriad of instruments, the two
recruited female vocalists (Worden makes a wonderfully
growling forest queen) and even a children's choir.
If you were waiting for an album of catchy singles and
instant appeal, this isn't it. The format of the album puts the

emphasis on the story, which is highly intriguing but some
what confusing at first listen. The music serves more as a sup
plement to the story than a stand-alone feature — riffs are
repeated, melodies re-used throughout, which gives the narra
tive cohesion but doesn't exactly make for your typical album.
And yet, the Decemberists have achieved something different,
perhaps even better, than a regular indie album ... the lovers'
tale compels listeners to take a second, closer look in a way that
most albums can't.
It goes without saying that "The Hazards of Love" is best
listened to in its entirety, but a small handful of tracks shine on
their own, if you don't mind the cryptic lyrics taken out of
context. "The Rake's Song," in which a shady man sings about
murdering his children, is sinfully catchy despite its morbid
subject, and"The Hazards of Love" parts two and four could
both hold their own on any indie playlist. It's up to the listen-

er's personal taste to decide if an indie hand
going prog-rock-opera is heavy-handed and
pretentious, or simply ambitious and
admirable. If you're of the former school of
thought, you can stick to the few "singles," but
you'll be missing out. Those of more open
minds can sit down with the album as a whole
and enjoy a gritty, tender, rollicking tale of folk
inspired fantasy melodrama.
So what exactly are the "hazards of love"? If
you're asking Meloy, he seems to be saying that
the hazards of love are 1) if you venture out on

a walk, you may fall in love with a shape-shifting animal, 2) if
you fall in love with a guy, his envious mother may send a mur
derer after you i'nd 3) if you murder your own children, they
may come back and get their ghostly revenge. Absurd ideas to
some, the Decemberists have embraced them and made "The
Hazards of Love" all their own. For all the prog-rock influence,
it's still a fascinating, unique album from a worthy band that
deserves a little faith, even in their ambitious experiments.
