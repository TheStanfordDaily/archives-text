# Lila Downs: a truly multi-talented musical performer
## 
### 
Lila Downs enchanted her audience in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium last Wednesday night with her exuberant
stage presence and stunning vocals. Downs was born in
Oaxaca, Mexico, the daughter of a Scottish-American and a
Mixtec Indian, but grew up and attended college in
Minnesota.
She sings in Spanish, English and "Spanglish." However,
you do not need to be bilingual to feel the raw emotion of her
music. Her songs reflect pride in her heritage, as well as frus
tration with current social issues.
The song "Minimum Wage" tells the story of Mexican
laborers who struggle to carve a place for themselves in
America. "Taco de Palabras" is an upbeat number that mocks
politicians and their false promises. Her compositions are
not only about social justice, however; themes of love, heart
break and searching for identity are woven into her music.
Downs also does covers, such as the Fleetwood Mac song,
made famous by Santana, called "Black Magic Woman."
Downs' songs highlight her formidable vocal range; she hits
incredibly high falsetto notes and switches to throaty, lower
pitches with dexterity.

Confidence radiates from Downs, who lit up the stage
wearing traditional, colorful Mexican garb. She is clearly a
musician who truly loves performing. She picked up various
small percussive instruments to play as she sang.
Uninhibited, Downs did a humorous chicken dance to the
song "Los Polios."
The musicians that joined her onstage included trom
bonist Dana Leong, who showed a powerful command of his
instrument during the many solos he played throughout the
evening. His soulful improvisations meshed well with
Downs' similarly expressive style. There was no intermission
during the concert, so the band was really able to get into a
groove together. Their synergy allowed them to easily switch
from down-tempo ballads to spicier numbers.
You may have seen Downs in the 2002 movie "Frida,"
starring Selma Hayek. Downs performed "La Llorana" and
"Burn it Blue," and is on the film's soundtrack. Her new
album, "Shake Away," has received high praise from Rolling
Stone, Billboard and The New York Times. Downs won a
Latin Grammy in 2004 for her album, "Una Sangre."
With each album, Downs continues to grow and explore

different styles. She may not be a household name in the U.S.,
but keep an eye on this soulful singer and lyricist; Downs is a
musician on the rise.
