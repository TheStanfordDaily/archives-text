## "Adventureland:" Quite the ride 
### 
As college students, most of us have fresh memories
from our first summer job. For a minority of students
it was a rewarding and transformative experience; for
the rest of us it was just a tedious affair, one we endured in
order to get a paycheck ever two weeks that satisfied our
monetary needs but had little to do with our career goals.
Oddly enough, the characters of Adventureland belong to
both of these groups. They joined the staff of a local amuse
ment park with no expectations, yet by the end of the movie
their lives have been transformed — whether for better or
worse is left for the audience to decide.
The movie is set in Pennsylvania in the late 1980s, a pre
il J od, pre-facebook America that seems strange yet familiar to
most college students today. The story revolves around James
Brennan (played by Jesse Eisenberg of "The Squid and the
Whale"), an earnest college graduate who takes a job at a
local amusement park to save money before he enters
Columbia grad school. The movie plays very much like a
conventional romantic comedy set in a "what I did this sum
mer" frame. As James gets accustomed to Adventureland, he
meets a group of characters who despise supervising the
games and rides as much as he does. As expected, they quick
ly bond over their dislike for the job while James falls for the
beautiful, yet slightly screwed-up Em (played by Kristen

Stewart of "Twilight"). However, the movie escapes pre
dictability thanks to the subtlety of its director,

Greg Mottola — which
is surprising given the
fact that Mr. Mattola's
last film, "Superbad", was
anything but subtle.
"Adventureland" is
bound to defy the expec
tat ion of moviegoers. For D
one, it is not the laugh-out ■
loud comedy which the
previews circulating the
web make it out to be. This 1
is not "Superbad Part II."
Instead, Greg Mottola has 1
created a much more
restrained, quiet, and serious

movie. That is not to say that
the film is devoid of humor —
on the contrary the jokes spread
throughout the movie are quite
funny — yet they seem super
fluous to the main narrative. In
fact, they distract from the
main plot so much that the film
feels unfocused at times, as if
unsure of whether it wants to
be a full-fledged comedy or
drama. "Adventureland" is at its
best when it is dealing with
character development rather
than the wacky situations that
occur at the amusement park.
In these scenes, Mottola allows
his characters to behave like
young people confused about
their role in this world, preoc
cupied with what they will do

once summer is over and the rest of their lives begin. Thus he
allows the audience to relate to them, instead of just making
us laugh.
The movie owes much of its success to the fantastic cast.
Eisengberg infuses lames with enough nervousness, wit, and
innocence to makes us believe in his journey. It is a variation
of the character Eisenberg played in "The Squid and the
Whale" except much more sympathetic. As great of a job as
Eisengberg does, he is outdone by Kristen Stewart, who turns
in a delicate, grounded performance. Stewart manages to
convey the pain and anger in her character from the get go,
even before the revelations about Em start to unravel. It is a
surprising feat given her subpar acting in last year's
"Twilight." The interactions between Jesse and Em give the
movie its emotional core and make the audience root for
both of them, even when they are at odds with each other.
"Adventureland" thrives in nostalgia. It is a movie which
intends to capture the preoccupations of a generation, yet it
doesn't fall in the trap of evoking memories by directly allud
ing to historical events, music, and other defining touch
stones of the 1980s. Instead the references are nuanced and
accomplished by characterization rather than exposition. In a
small, yet relevant scene in the film, Em asks Jesse why he
finds it necessary to attend Columbia in order to become a
travel journalist. His response is not shocking: he wants to
establish himself among the elite and Columbia will place
him in a prestigious place where he can make such connec
tions. Yet he realizes at this moment that if he really wanted
to be a travel journalist, all he has to do is travel and write.

The scene is almost a throwaway amid the larger plot points,
yet it captures what was important to the yuppie genera-

tion of the day, especially their preoccupation with status.
The movie will be more rewarding for those in the audi
ence who lived through the 80s and experienced many of
the same anxieties, musical exposure, and fashion trends
as the characters in "Adventureland." Yet, the nostalgic
element does not prevent younger generations from

enjoying the film. At the end of the day,
"Adventureland" is a coming-of-age tale, and the trials
and tribulations of growing up are universal. The time
period might seem distartt to many of us, yet the
I movie feels relevant nonetheless. Adventureland, the
L amusement park, might not be much fun, but this
I movie is quite a ride.
