# iShuffle v3.0: even smaller!
## 
### 
If Apple makes its iPod shuffle any smaller, it's going to disappear.
Released March 11, the third generation shuffle is the newest ultra
tiny, ultra-light music player in the company's plethora of il'ods. At
nearly half the size of the second gen shuffle, the new player looks akin
to a memory stick, and.it 4 GB can hold up to 1,000 songs.
Owners of a second generation iPod shuttle, the brightly colored
running/workout accessory, may not be completely blown away by the
more compact look and feel of the new shuffle. But for those of us who
still go jogging with a large, unattractive white stick hanging around our
neck (the original shuffle), the third generation player is quite an
upgrade.
Available in brushed black or silver, the new shuffle body features a
similar clip-on design as the old one. The controls, however, have been
moved off the body of the player onto a small remote on the ear buds
that are included in the $79 price. This design change has ignited a flur
ry of Internet chatter, and rightly so. While a control on the headphone
cord is an extremely convenient location, many people do not or cannot
use the headphones included with Apple products, especially when run
ning or going to the gym. 1 usually have no problem with this — 1 do,
however, have a serious issue with misplacing/mismatching Apple head
phones, and if you happen to grab the wrong pair on your way out the
door, you're out of luck.
Appie is assuring customers that third-party headphones with built
in remotes are on the way, and that they will be making an adapter so
users can plug in their own headphones. Still, at a $79 base price, it
seems unlikely that consumers will be thrilled to spend on additional
accessories for tlie player.
Like most Annie updates, the change in the shuttle's

physical design is coupled with a few unique new pro
gram features. First, the third generation shuffle is the
first-ever player with what the company lias dubbed
the Voice Over feature. Voice Over enables the shuttle to
read sonu titles and artists to the listener in an elec-

Tronic voice.
While Voice Over may seem unneces
sary at first, the electronic voice will also
read off names of playlists, thereby adding
an entirely new dimension to the shuttle.
Whereas before your only options were to
play in order or to "shuffle' the songs
loaded on the iPod, Voice Over allows users

to scroll through play lists and select
groups of songs. This makes the
player much more versatile, and
lets users organize the 4 GB of

pace effectively.
