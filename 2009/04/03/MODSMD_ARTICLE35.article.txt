# Sex @ Stanford vs. "Gossip Girl"
## 
### 
Spotted: Stanford sophomore watching Gossip Girl and won
dering if she'll ever catch her own Chuck Bass. Why so sad,
Little S? Don't think sex could be that good if it's not on the
Upper East Side?

Sex at Stanford may not be as glamorous
as what you see every Monday at 8 p.m. —

the fluorescent lights of FloMo cast an
unfavorable light on Winter quarter com
plexions — but Roxy thinks that Gossip
Girl has more in common with the
A

Farm than you think.
After all, who hasn't had a hot TA
that tempted them just like Ms. Carr
did Dan? Take it from Roxy — TAs are
the hottest sources for a little T & A. Get

an IHUMmer from your Ancient Empires
TA or try a little diplomacy role-play with that hot

tie in International Relations.
Been there, done that? When Roxy has played with
all of her TAs, she knows its time to pursue her Ph.D.

That is, the occasional scorching hot professor that keeps her noth
ing short of titillated during lecture. After all, tenure means they
can last forever.
But perhaps you aren't looking for intellectual stimulation and
you'd prefer to find some stimulating conversation. No need to look
far: there are plenty of cunning linguists a'la Chuck Bass right here
on campus. Roxy knows that Chuck's signature pick up lines — the
ones so bad they're good — are imitated everywhere from Phi Psi
to SAE to Chi Theta Chi.

Roxy's advice? Going down is always fun, even if it's due to a
bad pick up. They don't call them "come-ons" for nothing, after all.
Stanford shares another trait with Gossip Girl, though one that
is much less sexy. Just like in Gossip Girl, private lives aren't all that

private on campus. While we may not have a single source for
the airing of everyone's dirty laundry, Stanford is small

enough that by senior year, most people's dating histories
are a matter of public record.
Roxy has never minded this fact, as she wants
word to spread around about her sexual prowess. You,
too, can use Stanford's extensive grapevine to your
advantage. Say you find your own Nate Archibald, who
you hear is pining away for his own Blair and Vanessa.
You know he's the kind of guy who likes to have several
iris at once - why not ask him to arrange a four-some?

One thing Roxy is glad Stanford students do not have in com
mon with Manhattan's elite, however, is the consistent practice of
making bad relationship choices. Why do Dan and Serena contin
uously go back to each other when they have no chemistry? Why on
earth would Lily and Rufus compare lists of past sexual partners?
Why do Blair and Chuck take turns pursuing one another? WHY
DON'T THEY ALL JUST SHUT UP AND DO IT ALREADY?
As you can tell, this show is sexually frustrating for Roxy, who
hasn't been satisfied since Dan gave it to Ms. Carr in the school cos
tume closet and subsequently dumped her ass. Thus, Roxy must set
her sights back on the Stanford campus for pleasure-seeking pur
poses. Any takers?
XOXO,
— Roxy SASS.
