day 30-22..10-2.V 30-IS. Ihe win was the ( ardinal's ninth in its last
10 matches and its sixth straight victory in league play
"()urteam is starting to get on a roll." said junior opposite Ivan
Romero, who was recently named MI'S! Player of the Week after
totaling 3ft kills in the ("ardinal's two matches last week."lt's excit
ing because not onlv are we gaining momentum, but we are also
learning new things every day Put those two together and our
team is iiist getting better and better."
Pacific, which has lost 31 consecutive MI'S! matches, is the
only team in the 12-team MINI that is not ranked among the na
tion's top 15 teams, and it showed immediately. Stanford scored
five of the first six points in the match and never looked back, trail
ing for onl\ three points all match.
Ihe ('ardinal used a balanced attack to defeat the Tigers, as six
players tallied at least five kills, led by sophomore outside hitter
Spencer Mcl with 12. freshman outside hitter Brad Uiwson

blocked b\ three. Stanford dominated in nearl\ even other statis
tical category. Ihe key to the victory for the ( ardinal w;is hitting,
as Stanford had 21 more kills than Pacific in the same number of
attempts, leading to a hitting percentage of 427 compared to onlv
.175 for the Tigers. I lilting so consistent

the ( ardinal to succeed in the final
stretch of the season.

against this same team on the road.
"The Pyramid is a tough venue to
play at. so we are Kx»king forward to the
challenge." said Romero, who ranks first
in Stanford history in career kills during
the rally-scoring era.
"I listoricallv. Long Beach State has

always had a strong digging and jump

have to control their servers so we can
run our offense consistently."
In order to succeed against D>ng

junior opposite Dean Bittner. who ranks
second in the nation with an average of
nearly five and a half kills per set.

losses coming against the top two teams
in the nation.'llie Cardinal knows it will
face a tough test playing a team that has
won four of its last five home matches
against ranked teams.
"San Diego is a rapidly improving
team with plenty of energy and heart,"
Williams said. "They have the potential
to create large upsets, so we will need to
maintain focus and keep the pressure on
them as we did with Pacific."
