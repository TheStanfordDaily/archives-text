### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
New York limes Executive Editor
and Pulitzer Prize winner Bill Keller has
seen the best of times and the worst of
times in the newspaper industry.
Thursday, lie shared his insight and
opinions on the current state of print
journalism, as well as his visions for its
future, in front of an audience of
Stanford alums and students at Kresge
Auditorium.
Hie talk was the first of a series of
events for the dedication of the new
Lorrv I. I.okey Stanford Daily Building.
I.okey '4 whose $2 million donation
funded much of the construction of the
new facility, was present for the speech,
as were some 2(H) former and current
Daily staffers.
Keller discussed the dire situation
facing the print newspaper industry
which he saw as the result of both the
emergence of online news sources and
the economic downturn. As representa
tive examples, he cited the Eos Angeles
Times news staff, which is half of what it
once was. and his own staffs five per
cent pay cut for the rest of this year. In
light of the current situation, he quipped
that the ceremonies surrounding the
building dedication might feel like "a

ribbon cutting at a new Pontiac dealer
ship."
Still, the editor was guardedly opti
mistic about the future, both of his
newspaper and of the industry as a
whole.
While acknowledging the increasing
number of people who read news
online, Keller argued that Web reader
ship far from belittles that of established
print sources, such as The New York
Times. Furthermore, he maintained
there is still an enormous profit oppor
tunity for traditional newspaper jour
nalism. simply because of the quality of
news content available through such
organizations when compared to their
online-only counterparts.
"[The Internet] has yet to become a
significant indigenous source of the
kind of high-quality reporting that I
have been talking about," Keller said.
"Wikipedia. for instance, does not have
reporters stationed in Baghdad or
Beijing, following stories up at their
source."
The lecture was followed by a U&A
conversation moderated by Phil
Taubman, a former New York limes
editor and a former Stanford Daily edi
tor in chief.
