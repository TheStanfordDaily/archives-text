## Discussing news' future New York Times Executive Editor Bill Keller talks about his visions for print journalism 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
New York limes Executive Editor
and Pulitzer Prize winner Bill Keller has
seen the best of times and the worst of
times in the newspaper industry.
Thursday, lie shared his insight and
opinions on the current state of print
journalism, as well as his visions for its
future, in front of an audience of
Stanford alums and students at Kresge
Auditorium.
Hie talk was the first of a series of
events for the dedication of the new
Lorrv I. I.okey Stanford Daily Building.
I.okey '4 whose $2 million donation
funded much of the construction of the
new facility, was present for the speech,
as were some 2(H) former and current
Daily staffers.
Keller discussed the dire situation
facing the print newspaper industry
which he saw as the result of both the
emergence of online news sources and
the economic downturn. As representa
tive examples, he cited the Eos Angeles
Times news staff, which is half of what it
once was. and his own staffs five per
cent pay cut for the rest of this year. In
light of the current situation, he quipped
that the ceremonies surrounding the
building dedication might feel like "a

ribbon cutting at a new Pontiac dealer
ship."
Still, the editor was guardedly opti
mistic about the future, both of his
newspaper and of the industry as a
whole.
While acknowledging the increasing
number of people who read news
online, Keller argued that Web reader
ship far from belittles that of established
print sources, such as The New York
Times. Furthermore, he maintained
there is still an enormous profit oppor
tunity for traditional newspaper jour
nalism. simply because of the quality of
news content available through such
organizations when compared to their
online-only counterparts.
"[The Internet] has yet to become a
significant indigenous source of the
kind of high-quality reporting that I
have been talking about," Keller said.
"Wikipedia. for instance, does not have
reporters stationed in Baghdad or
Beijing, following stories up at their
source."
The lecture was followed by a U&A
conversation moderated by Phil
Taubman, a former New York limes
editor and a former Stanford Daily edi
tor in chief.

assured the Kresge crowd that there remains a need for print journalism in the current information era.
and authority of The New York
Times and other reputable print
news sources, features that are
absent from online news sources.
"Online, there are few clear
markers between blogs and news
sites that operate independently
under specific professional guide
lines." Keller said. "Online news
sources can be short on objective
fact-checking or reporting, and long
on incendiary gossip and opinion."
At the same time, he stressed the
central role the Internet would
surely play in the future of journal
ism. and predicted that higher stan
dards for online news sources
would ultimately have to develop.
"People often talk about how
Gutenberg's printing press revolu
tionized peoples' access to informa
tion. and it did." Keller noted. "But
in the years immediately following
its invention, there was chaos. It was
hard to know what printed material
was worth reading, and there was a
lot of uncertainty about where soci
ety was going."
"This is what real revolutions are
like." he added. "Eventually.
Gutenberg's innovation led to
widespread literacy and the dawn of
the Renaissance."
Keller emphasized that a central
goal for his news organization going
forward would be figuring out how
to increase online revenue.
Many in the audience found
Keller's remarks insightful.
"It was interesting to hear from
a high-ranking editor for a paper
like The New York Times, and how
his paper is dealing with the chal
lenges facing the newspaper indus
try today." said Will Atwood '11.
"And it was comforting to hear how
confident he was that the paper
would survive."
The editor certainly remained
optimistic throughout the after
noon talk. He said he was confident
that the printed New York Times
would be around for many years to
come, appealing to. among other
things, "that certain elusive quality
found in a newspaper's physical
presence."
