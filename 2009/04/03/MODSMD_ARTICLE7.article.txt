# STUDENT GOV'T
## Public service is key for ASSU hopefuls 
### MARISA LANDICHO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
While typical candidates for student gov
ernment malign sitting office holders, this gen
eration of ASSU hopefuls is almost idolatrous
of their predecessors. Current Executives
Jonny Dorsey "09 and Fagan Harris '09 have
inspired not only imitators and humorous par
odies. but also a bevy of determined students
pledging to tackle "serious issues."
Beginning with their initial campaign, the
two current I xecutives have attempted to
transform student government from a resume
booster to an effective organization, according
to Harris. They began with an attack on the
perception of a trivial and petty ASSU.
"The whole reason we decided to run is we

felt the ASSU had the ability, capacity and
responsibility to work on more serious issues
on campus." Dorsey said. "We don't think
we're hot shit, but we do think we've succeed
ed in changing the tone of the ASSI
A crop of young candidates seems to be in
agreement. Citing the example of Dorsey and
Harris, many students have enthusiastically
embraced student government.
A record 60 students initially announced
their intention to run for Undergraduate
Senate, nearly twice the amount as last year.
Hie candidate list is lull of students who lot
merly served the Dorsey Harris executive
cabinet in some unelected capacity.
Six of the 2(X)K-2(X)9 Executive bellows,
freshmen who shadowed executive cabinet
members, are currently runninu for either

sophomore class president or for undergradu
ate senate.
Hie two main executive candidates were
even part of the Dorsey-I larris cabinet them
selves.
As the ASSU Executive Operations
Manager. I )avid (Jobaud 'OS M.S. "10. running
with Ja\ de la Torre - 10. was the technical advi
sor for the ASSU and created the online stu
dent events calendar.
His competition is ASSU Executive
Cabinet Cost of Living co-Chair Bennett
Mauser 10. who is partnered with Matt
Sprague 10. director of ASSI' ( apital Group.
Mauser and Sprague were motivated to
run after seeing how student government
works from the inside. Both were complimen
tary of Dorsey and I larris. and plan on adopt

inti and expanding the current executive pro
grams for promoting mental health, public
service and sustainability.
"1 think every exec brings a unique focus, a
unique flavor," Sprague said. "[Dorsey and
I larris] left big shoes to fit. and they set a
tremendous example for the next execs."
Gobaud similarly admired the changes
wrought by the current executives. If elected,
he vowed to continue and increase the num
ber of town halls, a forum utilized bv Dorsey
and I larris throughout winter quarter.
Not to be outdone, the last executive slate
of John Lyman "II and Garrett Werner i()
made their connection to the public service
gurus Dorsey and I larris perfectly clear. Ifieir
paragraph of a slate title reads,"Just a
Couple of Affable, Public-Service
Oriented Guys Trying to Exercise the
Student Voice While Bridging the
Gap between Our Peers and the
Faculty/Administrative Complex."
Lyman, speaking on the
Executives,said."l think they're both
pretty handsome guys, and pretty
charming."
The Lyman-Werner slate has gone
so far as io release a video parodying
the "elbow touch" from Dorsey and
Harris' You l übe video directed
towards the student body last quar
ter.
Most of the Dorsey-Harris fans,
however, are entirely sincere.
Senate candidate and Executive
Fellow Sam King "12 rethought his
attitude on student government after
hearing a presentation by Dorsey
and I larris last fall.
"Jonny and Fagan are of course
the people who inspired me," he said.
"Before 1 became an executive fel
low. 1 wasn't even thinking of going
into the ASSU at all."
Another senate candidate and
previous Executive Fellow Ben
Laufer '12 shared the same positive
view of the two execs.
"Those two guys are pretty
incredible." he wrote in an email to
The Daily "Talk about two guys who
have made an impact far beyond the
Stanford Bubble — their legacies will
be felt on the Farm for years to
come."
ITie talking points of the Dorsey-
I larris platform — sustainability,
mental health, student outreach
are littered in the voter guide briefs
of the candidates. Notably, though,
only three out of 37 Senate candi
dates included public service, a major
focus of Dorsey and Harris, in their
briefs.
Ilie execs themselves are glad
that people have been inspired, but
maintain their humility.
"These guys are running after
they've seen us tired and grumpy."
Dorsey said. "The fact that they still
want to run shows that they realize
how difficult |the ASSU] is to come
into."
