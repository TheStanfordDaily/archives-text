Water Conservation Awards

recently recognized Stanford for its achievements in
water conservation. This is the first time the event has
taken place, debuting at De Anza College's kirsch
Center for Environmental Studies in Cupertino.
Stanford was among the eleven local businesses, agen
cies, organizations and individuals to be awarded.
Stanford, nominated in the "Large Organization"
category, was commended for reducing its water usage
from 2.7 to 2.3 million gallons per day over the past
eight years through its comprehensive water conserva
tion program.
"Student Housing, with its 4.2 million square feet of
buildings covering about one-third of the campus, over
the years h;is undertaken a number of measures to
help the University conserve water." said Executive
Director of Student Housing Rodger Whitney in an
email to The Daily. " These include simple things such
as installing flow restrictors on our faucets and chang
ing our landscape irrigation systems from domestic
water to lake water taken from various natural sources
on Stanford lands, as well as putting our landscape irri
gation on a soil moisture detection system rather than
a traditional time-clock management system."
In the third consecutive year of a drought.
California has found itself concerned with water con
servation. Recently, in response to the climate change.

servation. Recently, in response to
the climate change. Governor
Arnold Schwarzenegger called for a
20 percent reduction in water usage.
The Silicon Valley Water
Conservation Awards were present
ed in hopes of drawing attention to
those, like the University, that serve
as role models for conservation.
Whitney went on to list other
ways in which Stanford has con
served water, including the installa
tion of over 2,000 low-flow toilets in
all restrooms and bathrooms, low
flow sprayers in all campus kitchens
and the current implementation of

low-flow washing machines.
Yet even with its noble inten
tions, these preservative actions
have not been without controversy.
Hie installation of low-flow shower
heads in all undergraduate resi
dences last year caused a stir among
students.
In response to these new shower
heads. hundreds of students circulat
ed petitions calling for their
removal. Some students even went
so far as to remove the showerheads
themselves in a boycott that
received national attention.
However, the showerheads,
invented by Stanford student Jonas
Ketterle "OS. were one of the main
reasons Stanford was able to
achieve this recent recognition.
"In the end, it did have an
impact on the award and the

University was commended for its
proactive approach to water con
servation. specifically mentioning
the showerheads," Whitney said.
"This measure along with other
campus-wide water conservation
measures undertaken by the cam
pus utility division resulted in sig
nificant water savings across the
entire campus."
The showerhead controversy
was resolved last year when
Resident Assistants agreed in a
campus-wide meeting to their
installation with the compromise of
including either one handheld
showerhead or higher-flow shower
head in each bathroom.
"The reactions of a few students
caused us to consider the timing of
our projects and to address some
peripherally related issues about

shower head height," he added.
"With minimal modification, we
were able to keep the installations
and the net result was a considerable
contribution to water conservation."
Student housing is responsible
for 28 percent of the water used
daily across campus, while contribut
ing to about 30 percent of the cur
rent overall campus water savings.
The Silicon Valley Water
Conservation Awards were present
ed by the Water Awards Coalition,
which consists of 10 local, environ
mental ly-a ward organizations.
Among them is Acterra, which also
awarded Stanford for sustainability
efforts at the Annual Acterra
Awards last vear.
