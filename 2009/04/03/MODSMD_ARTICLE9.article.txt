the I okey Building is the culmination
of almost 20 years' work, and represents

opportunity.
"I have an opportunity to give
remarks at many building dedica
tions" he said, "i like to note that,
on one level, any building is just
nails, wood, some mortar, glass and
so on. But. on another level, a good
building is a symbol of what
Stanford values. This building is a
good building. It represents our
commitment — and that of gener
ous supporters like Lorry Lokey —
to our students and to supporting
their dedication to creating a better
community and a better world."
The dedication ceremonies
ended with Torres presenting a gift
to Lokey. who then gave a short
speech. The ceremony also doubled
as a unique opportunity for Daily
alumni to reconnect and recollect
on their days of reporting for the
now 116-year-old campus newspa
per.
"[ rhe Daily] started me off and
I've been a newspaperman ever
since," said Press, who worked at
The Daily over 70 years ago.
Press was joined by almost 200
other alumni, many of whom were
also greatly influenced by their
years of writing for the campus
newspaper.
"At The Daily. I found the calling
of my life, which was journalism, and
that's not too shabby for an extra

curricularsaid Phil Taubman '70.
Taubman, after whom the new
editor in chiefs office is named,
found more than just his job at The
Daily. It was at the Storke Building,
The Daily's previous home, where he
met his wife. Felicity Barrineer '72.

"Its a community of talented
people who care about one thing in
common, and that's The Daily''
CHARLIE HOFFMAN '73

Taubman went on to serve as the
Washington bureau chief for The
New York Times before moving
back to California with his wife, who
is currently an environmental corre
spondent for The New York Times.
Both husband and wife were struck
by the significance of the dedication
ceremonies.
"It memorializes all the mosaic
of experiences of all the people who
are here," Barringer said.
Taubman echoed her remarks
saying, "There won't be another day
like this until this new building is
replaced."
Despite The Daily's current
financial difficulties and the decline
of the newspaper industry, the dedi
cation events were filled with a
sense of pride for The Daily's

accomplishments thus far and a
sense of optimism for the years to
come.
"It's a community of talented
people who care about one thing in
common, and that's The Daily —
and that's why we have this build-

ing." said Charlie Hoffman '73, the
president and founder of the
Friends of The Stanford Daily.
"Most of all, it's very rewarding."
"What we have here in this
room, it's worth caring about," he
added.
Hoffman was joined by a large
contingent of Daily alumni from the
19705, but there were many other
generations represented as well.
Reb Rebele '57 recalled working
on a "big story" following President
Truman's recall of General Douglas
Mac Arthur from Korea during the
19505. He still remembers traveling
to the airport and then the Saint
Frances I lotel in hopes of interview
ing Truman at this key point in his
tory.
"It was a good case studv in

working with other journalists and
understanding what motivates jour
nalists and editors and columnists,"
said Rebele, who went on to own a
chain of seven daily newspapers
with his wife Pat.
The keynote speaker for the ban
quet was Rajiv Chandrasekaran '94.
associate editor for Ilie Washington
Post. Chandrasekaran. a former edi
tor in chief of The Daily, directed his
remarks to the current generation of
Daily staffers.
"in my career thus far, I ran the
Washington Post Bureau in
Baghdad. I ran the Post's national
news staff, but still the most respon
sibility that I've had in life thus far
has been running The Daily," he said
in an interview. "I never thought I'd
actually see The Daily in a swanky
new building. It's a little more like a
tech start-up than a newspaper, but
I'm sure it will look suitably grimy
in a short time."
Michael Londgren '90, chairman
of the Board of Directors of The
Stanford Daily Publishing
Corporation and former Daily busi
ness manager, also spoke at the ban
quet. thanking students, donors,
alumni and the University for their
collaboration in making the Lorry I.
Lokey Stanford Daily Building a
reality.
"We could not have asked for a
better location," Londgren said of
the new building. "It will serve as a
great campus hub for journalism."
