## EDITORIAL Increase dining plan flexibility 
### 
What with the fresh jicama and Swiss
chard regularly served in cafeterias
or the private chefs who greet hun
gry Row-dwellers with barbecued ribs on any
given weeknight,you'd think a Stanford stu
dent might be hard-pressed to argue the in
justice of the dining situation on campus.
While the editorial board agrees that we are
a privileged lot. and does not mean to attack
the quality or quantity of the cuisine that
Stanford Dining works hard to provide, we
feel the need to beg the question: Why aren't
all options open to students on an equal
basis? And what is this dining disparity doing
to our level of wellness and sense of commu
nity on campus?
Few stop to consider how greatly the Uni
versity-assigned meal plan they have been
assigned affects their social circle, budget and
day-to-day satisfaction. Consider the sopho
more who draws into Mars to be with friends,
but cannot afford a board bill that demands
she spend an extra several hundred dollars
per quarter on food. Or the upperclassman
with a high Draw number who must choose
between the guilt of "wasting a meal" he's al
ready paid for to eat with friends off campus,
or trying to fit in at a freshman discussion of
PWR in Wilbur Dining.
The University is sprinkled with many
such cases of dissatisfaction and even serious
hardship endured under the currently rigid
and effectively mandatory meal plan policy.
And thus far. Stanford Dining has been un
reasonably unwilling to accommodate stu
dents' diverse financial, nutritional and social
preferences.
Dining argues that by constricting stu
dents to their residentially assigned meal
plan, it is "helping to build a sense of commu
nity within a house and promote interaction
between residents, faculty and guests." The
current policy dictates that students must ac
cept the dining plan offered by the residence
to which they were randomly assigned unless
they can get a religious leader, or the Office
of Accessible Education (OAF), to certify in
writing that there is a conflict between their
lifestyle and assigned dining facilities. Even
then,students are assessed a quarterly fee for
the privilege to opt out and spend their
money as they see fit.
Stanford Dining should take an approach
to meal plan selection that more aptly re
flects students' means and social habits — an

approach that is not so contingent upon a stu
dent's place of residence. If students could
choose a personalized meal plan that includ
ed more co-op eating or self-op eating, a
wider range of dining hall meals and Cardi
nal dollars for purchase, or the chance to be a
Row-house eating associate without having
to fake a new interest in keeping Kosher or
pay a penalty, students would be able to take
better advantage of all the great options on
campus without paying above and beyond
what Stanford charges for board bills.
On the F.ast Coast, a number of institu
tions. including Cornell University and
Boston College, offer students a far wider
range of dining options, recognizing that it
should be students' prerogative to decide
whether they spend more money in a dining
hall or a local or off-campus eatery. They
have instituted a prepaid debit card service
that allows card holders to eat both at dining
halls and a number of privately owned local
eateries, and students can decide for them
selves how much they spend at each location.
ITiese universities understand that not all
students benefit from all-you-can eat pro
grams. and that going out can be a positive
eating experience in addition to eating in a
residential program.
Given that so much of Stanford life is con
tained on campus, our dining system might
be more feasibly amended by giving each stu
dent a set number of meal points to spend
anywhere on campus — including Row
houses, cafes and dining halls — and to let
students decide what works best for them.
M;inv students would still most likely choose
to eat close to their homes most nights of the
week, but the flexibility advantages to the
students currently socially isolated or unsat
isfied by their meal plan options would be
tremendous. While it may cost more to imple
me nt.asdini ng ha 11 managers are less cert ain
about how much food they should prepare,
the student body will reap more than enough
benefit to justify the expense.
Food is one of our most essential needs,
and mealtime provides not only nourish
ment, but also pleasure and social connectiv
ity. Hie student meal plan system is as arbi
trarily and dispassionately assigned as our
Draw numbers, and is not well-equipped to
provide students with the choice and flexibil
ity that we. as adults with diverse needs and
interests, deserve.
