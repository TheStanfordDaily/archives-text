# Pith and Pleonasm

On my first day of my summer class at
Northwestern last year, the professor
— an egg-shaped man with beady char
coal eyes and perpetually zipped-though-the
fiv sh s irt tails — began class with a red-faced,
sweaty diatribe that ended with something
close to this: Many of yon will not make it. Many
of you do not have what it takes, and you will
find that von don 7 have what it takes out very
quickly in MY classroom. I know most of you
are here because you want to he doctors — by
the end of summer, many of you will need to con
sider a new career path.
Your terrified narrator is looking around
the classroom, fully expecting to see his own
shock, disgust and confusion reflected on the
faces of his classmates.
I get nothing. No one looks up or rolls her
eyes at this ridiculous, blotchy oval of a human
being. The girl in front of me. instead, has writ
ten on the top of her paper (no joke) DAY 1
NO EXCUSES THIS TIME.
If I were lucky, this would just be a night
mare.
Hut no. this is Organic ( hemistry.
Organic Chemistry, or "O-Chem." as it's
called bv every kid who ever leaned over to ask
what you got on a physics midterm, is thought
by most to be the most difficult hurdle on the
track to medical school. In addition.premedical
students complete a year of general chemistry,
biology and physics, plus additional course
work that might be required by whichever holy
grail of medical instruction they one day hope
to attend. It's obscenely time consuming, com
petitive and out-of-this-world stressful. In
short, it all really, really sucks.
As I suffered through organic chemistry. I
went through all the standard states of disen
chantment (I am told everyone goes through a
fairly set series of states of disenchantment in
organic chemistry). Somehow. I escaped the
summer with my life, but when I turned in my
last exam at the end of week nine, all I felt was
disappointment. I had just finished the hardest
set of classes I'd ever taken, and I felt terrible,
like I'd wasted a summer, like I'd forgotten
everything already, like... wait.//j« is what just
decided whether or not I'm qualified to k; a
doctor? Seriously?
There probably isn 't a group on campus that
gets stereotyped more harshly than pre-meds.
They're so competitive! They're such robots!
Don t they ever have any fun? It's an easy trap
to fall into, to think that pre-meds are a differ
ent breed. Hut think about it —the pressure

that's being put on these kids, from parents,
classmates or the document you can download
that has the average admitted GPA for every
med school on the planet, is so immense,so un
thinkable even a generation ago. that the ques
tion shouldn't be how pre-medscan be so crazy;
it's how pre-meds can possibly not be so crazy?
1 lazing is almost uniformly illegal on college
campuses, but that's all the full pre-med cur
riculum really comes down to. If a campus or
ganization forced its new members through the
beer-chugging or ass-paddling equivalent of a
year of organic chemistry, they'd be kicked off
campus faster than you could say Organiza
tional Conduct Board. Having been on sports
teams in high school, a fraternity at Stanford
and then taken a full year's worth of pre-med
masochism at Northwestern. I can promise you
that nothing even remotely approaches the in
tensity or humiliation of what happened on a
daily basis in mv summer chemistry classes.
The Ancient Powers that be of the Ameri
can Medical College Application Service (w(w
ho I'd imagine are well over SO and sit in cedar
trimmed. Montgomery Hums-style offices that
haven't been ventilated since 1973) simply go
by a we-did-it-and-so-should-they mentality.
TTiey completely miss the point that the climate
of today's colleges, not to mention the state of
healthcare in America, is so radically different
than it's ever been in the past that the system
simply needs to change to accommodate the
times.
I ligh grades and test scores certainly selett
for a competent.calculating bunch, but this ap
proach, especially at a college where everyone
already had to claw tooth and nail in high
sch<H)l just to get in the door, crowds out a ton
of students who could have made excellent
physicians but fell on the wrong side of one too
many (iaussian curves.
To call the 45 or so required pre-med under
graduate units unnecessary and excessive
would be unfair i Jnnecessary' and 'excessive'
are far too benign of terms to describe the ab
surdity of forcing kids though all that class just
so they can do it for seven more years. It's stu
pid. and it forces totally qualified students to
look for other lines of work. It's not just unnec
essary and excessive — it's insane.
