## Ballot box budgets: Keeping student life solvent 
### 
As the tawdry details of ASSU elections
and campaign financing initiatives arc
splayed across the pages of the Daily, a
lower-key. but to most students far more im
portant, annual drama is unfolding behind the
scenes: Special Fees.
Each year, the student body votes to tax it
self over $2 million to fund the activities of its
large student groups, supporting everything
from Club Sports to MEChA.The process be
gins in February, when financial officers pres
ent comprehensive budgets for the coming
year to the Undergraduate Senate's Appropri
ations Committee, which shoehorns the budg
ets into its funding guidelines before they can
appear on the ballot. We then vote on the fees
in the Spring ASSU elections. As a final meas
ure, students can request refunds from specific
groups each quarter.
The focal point of the process is fee inter
views in February. (Disclaimer: I participated
in this process last year as an ASSU Senator).
The Appropriations Committee spends 25
hours in a windowless.Gulag-like room in Old
Union over the course of a weekend, going
through several-hundred pages of Special l ee
applications, interviewing more than 50
groups. Last year's committee had to supple
ment its regular quorum requirements with a
'sober quorum' to account for the hapless sen
ators who took to drinking to deal with the
stress. The process has its absurdities. Groups
are asked to submit detailed line-item budgets
for events that are often more than a year
away, leading the appropriations committee
to discuss sundries like the cost of napkins or
whether speakers deserve $5 or $10 gift coffee
mugs.
Despite all this, the system functions.
Groups get their money in a mostly fair and eq

uitable manner: voting on fees and electing
senators provide a democratic check on the
process and. unlike the University administra
tion. the ASSU transparently makes all docu
ments and figures about the fees available.
Whatever its imperfections. Special Fees are
preferable to an administrator wantonly dis
bursing funds.
That the system works is a testament to the
mutual trust and solidarity of Stanford stu
dents. Most students benefit directly from only
a few student groups, but our collective willing
ness to support groups of which we are not
members allows the student body to fund a
wide range of student groups in a democratic
manner without falling prey to the interest
group politics and populism that plague the
California initiative process.
Student fees have weathered the budgetary
storm thus far. Because they are collected di
rectly from students and spent that same year,
endowment and market losses won't drive
down student group funding. Rather, fees are a
source of last resort, serving as a backup for
groups that can no longer rely on departments,
grants, student affairs and other sources.
This year, the quarterly Special Fees bill
has crossed the $ 1 (K) threshold for the first
time-to $110. Next year, the fee is slated to
grow further.The increase has been met with
increasing refund requests.The fee refund was

created to allow students to express dissatis
faction with particular groups hy asking for
their money back, but that is not how it's used.
Students who ask for their money back go for
broke, asking on average for 80 percent of the
total fee.
According to SSI-', the ASSU's business
unit, autumn and winter quarter refund re
quests increased 40-80 percent over last year.
If refunds increase dramatically next year, the
ASSIJ will face a repeat of the Special Fees
crisis of 2004. when the system nearly went
bankrupt. If too many students ask for re
funds. the ASSIJ needs to claw back money
from groups' accounts. In 2004. this led to
fro/en accounts and slashed budgets that de
pressed student life lor several years. A repeat
w hen the rest of the I Jniversity is cutting back
would be devastating.
Nobody knows how Special Fees elections
this year and refunds next year will pan out
under the current economic crisis. Two things
make sense, however. Students: don't just
blindly sign petitions and vote for every group.
While you may not have time to read every
group's budget, inform yourself. It is better that
one or two egregious fees get voted down than
that the whole system collapses. Financial offi
cers and group leaders: nobody knows how
students will react in votes this year. Don't be
complacent â€” make sure you campaign hard
and explain to students the benefits your
group provides. Hopefully, we will show the
University that when students run things,
things run well.
