## The
						unique place of car companies in our culture 
### 
In the current economic crisis, the Hush
and Obama Administrations have
"bailed out," to use such an amorphous
term, two main industries — the financial in
dustries, which supply the capital and credit
that underlies the entire American economy,
and the automobile industry. It is easy to un
derstand why loaning money to financial
companies is important — without them,our
entire economy would collapse.
Hie rationale for bailing out car compa
nies, however, is much harder to understand
in purely economic terms. (Out of the three
American-based companies. General Mo
tors and Chrysler have taken federal money;
Ford believes it can survive on its own.) 1 low
have the car companies — only one type of
product that the American economy pro
duces— acquired such a privileged place in
the political discourse? Why are we bailing
out car companies, but not newspapers, uni
versities, law firms or other industries that
have witnessed massive layoffs? Why are
cars so important?
The obvious answer is that they are
portant to the overall functioning of the
American economy. Automobiles are not a
national security interest. Saving GM and
Chrysler will not assist t he larger economy (as
helping financial institutions will), and at this
point, there are no illusions about GM and
Chrysler ever producing cars at the levels that
they did just two years ago. The answer given
by the Obama administration is that they
want to save jobs. To a certain extent, the
President is right —car companies and the
associated firms that supply them employ a
lot of people. But layoffs are occurring every
where. And bankruptcy — the other option if
the money stops coming — won't result in the
dissolution of the companies.
The explanation for the billions of dollars
directed to these two companies is not about
economics. Instead, it is about culture and
politics. We have been here before. In a high
ly controversial 1979 decision, the Carter ad
ministration chose to make $3.5 billion avail
able to Chrysler, which was tottering on the
edge of insolvency.That money may seem like

a pittance in the era of trillion-dollar asset re
covery schemes, but it was a lot of money
then. (And now. too. It would do wonders for
my Fraiche-consumption frequency.)
On a political level, unions are strong in
Democratic politics. The Obama campaign
courted them during the Democratic primar
ies and they put considerable muscle behind
his general-election campaign. Despite the
fact that union membership as a share of the
total workforce has declined, year-on-year,
for about three decades, unions' influence in
Democratic politics has not waned. It is diffi
cult for a Democratic president to take on
the unions. Mill Clinton earned years of union
enmity by advocating for the North Ameri
can Free Trade Agreement (NAITA), and
most Congressional Democrats abandoned
him. NAIT A passed on the back of Republi
can. not Democratic votes.
On a cultural level, cars are deeply en
trenched in the American consciousness.
There is no industry that is as übiquitous. We
remain a car culture — every American fam
ily owns one. if not two. Television advertis
ing is mostly the domain of car companies
and beer companies. But even more than cars
generally, American car companies hold a
special place in our postwar economy. (ien
eral Motors was once, long ago, the foremost
symbol of American industry and manufac
turing. Lee lacocca. the former CEO of
Chrysler, is an icon of management studies
and thousands of executives read his books
every year. Finally, cars are our last big man
ufacturing sector. Textiles, electronics and
most other industries have long been moved
abroad, but there are still a lot of automobile
plants in the U.S. employing hundreds of
thousands of people.There is something tan
gible and real about a car that can never be
replaced by a piece of software or a "service."
The question is whether the unions are
now standing between President ()bama and
a better economic outcome. It makes no
sense to keep throwing billions at (iM and
( hrysler at a time when Americans are rein
ing in their spending, especially on big-ticket
items such ;is cars. Republicans have long

been advocating Chapter II bankruptcy as
the best option. A lot of big companies do this
it seems like the airlines are constantly
bankrupt and they still operate, somehow. It
would give the government more leverage to
slim down the companies and change the
range of models to be smaller and more fuel
efficient. (>M and C hrysler have been much
slower to produce fuel-efficient sedans and
hybrids than their more agile Japanese coun
terparts, Toyota and Honda. Chapter II
bankruptcy would also be the most fair
cars, after all, have no more right to bailout
money than newspapers.

Stuart Hairnet is currently driving a car tlmt is
not even produced anymore. Hooray for
progress, h.mail him your proposals to make
every car a hybrid to sbaimeK" stunford.edu.
