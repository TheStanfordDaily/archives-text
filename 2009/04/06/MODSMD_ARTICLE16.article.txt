## BASEBALL FINDS ITS SWING Stanford streaks in Pac-10 play 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY MANAGING EDITOR 
Stanford baseball's first trip to Eugene,
Ore. in 25 years proved successful, as the Car
dinal took a best-of-three series from a first
year Oregon program, two games to one. The
Ducks, whose baseball program took a 26-year
hiatus from 1981-2(X)7.are in their first year of
competition since their revival. But the young
team — made up almost entirely of junior col
lege transfers and freshmen — could not hold
back the Cardinal, despite taking Friday's con
test. 2-1.
In a series that was focused almost entirely
on pitching, Stanford (11-12, 5-4 Pacific-10
Conference) was able to come back to win the
latter two games, 3-1 and 6-3, respectively.
Freshmen starters Jordan Pries (3-0) and
Brent Mooneyham (2-1) excelled in the week
end games; they both worked into the seventh
inning (with Pries pitching into the eighth)
until sophomore Drew Storen came in to pick
up his second and third saves of the year.
Oregon (12-17.2-4) boasts a pitching staff
that came into the three-game set ranked No.
2 in the Pac-10 and No. 19 in the country in
ERA,and Stanford depended mainly on small
ball tactics to pull out the series victory
bunting and stolen base attempts were com
monplaces the ( ardinal tried to score runs in
any way it could. At first. Stanford shied away
from such techniques, but after Oregon's
starter Tyler Anderson (2-3) shut the Cardinal
down in the opening game on Friday, Stanford
coach Mark Marquess recognized the need for
a change in strategy.

GAME NOTES: With the victories last weekend, Stanford
has now won two straight series in the Pac-10. The
Cardinal focused on small-ball against Oregon,
dropping four sacrifice bunts in Sunday's win.
Stanford's next opponent, USD, is coming off of a 22-5
victory over Santa Clara.
"There's not many runs being scored, so if
you get an opportunity to get one or two runs
an inning, that may be enough to win.as it was
in the first two games," Marquess said. "When
runs are hard to come by,you try to get them as
early and in any way you can."
Anderson,a left-handed freshman,allowed
the Cardinal practically nothing in 7.2 innings
of work — he struck out nine, his lone blemish
coming in the form of a sixth-inning line drive
home run from senior Brent Milleville. Ore
gon's closer Drew Gagnier. who was practical
ly unhittable coming into the series against

Stanford, went the rest of the way.
Gagnier almost allowed the tying run to
score in the eighth, though, when sophomore
designated hitter Ben Clowe hit a scorching
ground ball up the middle with a man on sec
ond that seemed destined for the outfield. But
second baseman Josh Hogan made a diving
stop and threw out Clowe, ending the Cardi
nal's last rally.
Junior Jeffrey Inman (1-4) threw about as
well as one could throw and still get tagged
with a loss, going 7.1 innings and allowing just
two runs on seven hits, while striking out five.
On nearly any other day, that would have
brought home a win, but Stanford's offense
could not touch Anderson.
"We didn't really swing the bats well —
their pitcher Anderson pitched a great game."

Marquess said. "We had some opportunities,
some guvs on base, and just couldn't get a hit."
Stanford's bats didn't exactly wake up on
Saturday, but they did enough to support Pries'
gem. He took a scoreless game into the eighth
inning before surrendering the lone Oregon
run of day Pries struck out seven on the day to
best Ducks hurler Erik Stayvert (2-3), who
threw a nice game — 7.1 innings and five
strikeouts, with the three runs coming on just
four hits — but suffered a similar fate as
Inman did the day before.
"(The series has) been dominated by pitch
ing. not much hitting, and the ballpark is con
ducive to pitching.The ball doesn't get through
the infield too quick," said Marquess before
Sunday's game. "We've had great pitching and
pretty solid defense and two real close games."

The Cardinal's first run came as a direct re
sult of small ball — in the third, sophomore
shortstop Jake Schlander took first on a walk,
then moved to second on a sacrifice bunt be
fore jetting to third on a ground out. He scored
on Stayvert's wild pitch to give Stanford its first
lead of the series. Later in the inning, senior
Joey August sent a long fly ball over the fence
in right field for a solo home run. Junior Adam
Gaylord scored the Cardinal's final run in the
eighth inning on a throwing error by relief
pitcher Rvan Heckenstein.
Junior Toby Gerhart, who was one of the
main offensive contributors for Stanford
throughout the weekend, stole two bases on
Saturday, and by Sunday's rubber match, the

Stanford baseball continued its recent surge in conference play, defeating Oregon in a three-game series over the weekend. The Cardinal has
now won two straight series in the Pac-10, and will look to ride its momentum against a powerful San Diego team at home on Tuesday.
Ducks' pitchers were visibly anxious
whenever Stanford was able to get
men on base — the threat of a steal
was always imminent.
Oregon's Sunday starter Madison
Boer appeared particularly affected,
and, despite throwing well in general,
struggled with his control when the
Cardinal reached base. I le was pulled
in the fifth inning as Stanford, already
holding a 2-0 lead, seemed poised to
add to that total. Even after the Ducks

went to the bullpen, the Cardinal was
able to add a run in its half of the fifth
to take what appeared to be a com
manding 3-0 lead, given the lack of of
fense throughout the series.
Stanford rode Mooneyham tor
most of the game, and the big fresh
man did not disappoint, striking out
six in his first four innings, and seven in
total — he gave up three runs on five
hits before being relieved by Storen.
The Ducks did stage a rally in the
seventh inning,closing Stanford's lead
to just one run at 4-3 as K.C Serna hit a
mammoth homerun to left center,and
Mitch Karraker hit a long double off
of Storen to score Curtis Raulinaitis
(the run was charged to Mooney

ham). But the Cardinal added some
separation in the top of the ninth, with
Schlander scoring on another wild
pitch — this one from Gagnier, who
suddenly seemed human — and
sophomore Colin Walsh coming
home on classmate Kellen Kiils
gaard's double.
ITie Ducks could not rally against
Storen in the ninth, and the Cardinal
will return to the Farm victorious in its
second straight conference series.
Next up for Stanford is a Tuesday
evening game against San Diego,
starting at 5 p.m. at Sunken Diamond.
