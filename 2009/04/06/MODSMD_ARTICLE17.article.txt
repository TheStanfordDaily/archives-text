ence) opened the weekend series against Ore
gon State with a 4-2 win.The decision gave sen
ior Missy Penna her 106 th win of her career,
enough to pass Dana Sorenson ('O4) for first
place on the all-time wins list at Stanford. Penna
topped off her record-setting night with a whop
ping 13 strikeouts.
Stanford coach John Rittman was quick to
praise his senior starter.
"[Penna] did a great job of mixing up her
pitches, speeds and locations this weekend," he
said.
Cardinal freshman Ashley Hansen did her
part on offense, going 2-3 at the plate and scor
ing two of Stanford's four runs. Junior Shannon
Koplitz added two hits and two RBI in the win.
Lor the Beavers, sophomore Audrey Roder
field was the offensive leader. She scored Ore

trips to the plate. Freshman hurler Paige Hall
surrendered eight hits and four earned in seven
innings of work to take the loss.
Penna tossed three complete games over the
weekend, the marquis performance coming on
Saturday when she coughed up just one hit en
route to a 11 -0 throttling of ()regon.The hit was
all that kept the Miami native from her first ca
reer perfect game.
Offensively, Stanford took its cue from
Penna's dominance on Saturday. Stanford's bats

runs from junior Rosey Neill. Senior Maddy
Coon followed Neill's example, belting her 27th
career home run at 1 lowe Field in Eugene. Coon
and Koplitz both came around to score three
times in the victory. The pair combined for five
of the team's 14 hits.
Coach Rittman reflected on a strong week
end for Stanford in the circle and at the plate.
"Overall. I'm very impressed with the team
how we handled ourselves and how we pre
pared." he said.
But after dominating the Ducks Saturday,
Stanford stayed close with Oregon on Sunday.
An unseasonably warm day in Eugene
brought the Duck fans out in force. Cardinal jun
ior Alissa I label responded to the crowd, swat
ting a leadoff double off the wall in left-center
on the third pitch of the game. Haber scored the
game's first run after a wild pitch from freshman
Sam Skillingstad.
The scoring didn't stop there. A Coon walk
led to a Neill homer, her third of the weekend.
After one inning of play. Stanford's
bats were in control.
But the hats would quiet, totaling
six hits on the day. Only two more
runs would score in a 5-2 win over
Oregon. Neill added a double in the
third, notching another multi-hit
game. The Ducks managed to collect
just three hits off Penna, combining

for four in the two-game series. But
two Stanford errors helped Oregon
produce valuable runs.
"We're a good enough team that
we can overcome some mistakes,"
Rittman said of the errors.
The Cardinal ace surrendered
just her third home run of the year
on Sunday, a solo shot off the bat of
senior Sari-Jane Jenkins. Nonethe
less, the win meant a clean sweep in
Oregon for the Cardinal, now win
ner of five straight.
On the outcomes, Rittman com
mented on the three-day difference

when keeping Penna in the circle.
"Missy on day three is not going
to be as sharp as on day one and day
two" he said. "But. I'm happy with
her change in locations today."
Stanford improved to 5-1 in the
Pac-l()with the wins.sharing the lead
in the conference, and trailing only
Florida in the national polls. ITie
Cardinal will face Cal at Smith Fam
ily Stadium on Thursday, with the
first piteh scheduled for 7 p.m.
