# America's pastime: The ultimate sports depression cure
## 
### 
Sometimes, 1 just don't know what to
tell you.
I try and keep it mostly positive around
here, because I've never been a big fan of
the run-of-the-mill, gloom-and-doom
columnist that seems to appear in virtually
every paper around the country.
But sometimes that job is hard. L.ike
today, when we've all just watched the
Stanford women fail in their bid to upset
top-ranked UConn last night in the Final
Four. You have to start by saying the Stan
ford women turned in another fantastic
season, and applaud them for never saying
die against a Huskies team that was just
too much for them. But then the frustra
tion sets in.
Long story short, it's enough to make
you glad that there's something else to
focus on. Because when it comes to forget
ting your frustrations, there's nothing bet
ter than a national pastime. And believe it
or not. even though there may not be any
heavy favorites to contend for a World Se
ries in the area, there should be plenty to
watch in the coming months.
Starting in the Major Leagues, neither
the A's nor Giants look like World-beaters,
but they do both offer one thing in spades:
hope. The A's will trot out a lineup that
should be dramatically improved from a
year ago - Matt Holliday, Jason Giambi.
Orlando Cabrera and the shell of Nomar
Garciaparra should make certain of that.

But it's the philosophical shift behind the
moves that's the real eye-catcher of the or
ganization's fanbase.
For years. Billy Beane was all about
the long-term — stocking and restocking
Oakland's farm system with premium tal
ent. Big names were traded away from
Oakland, not the other way around. But a
funny thing happened when the economy
tanked: Just as every other franchise in
baseball, minus the always-be-spending
Yankees, started screaming "Sell! Sell!
Sell!" Beane turned calmly and said
"liuy."
Years of sensible spending have, re
markably, left Oakland in the perfect posi
tion for a smaller market team in this econ
omy. Rather than panicking and shipping
off their high-priced players to whoever
would take them, a strategy that would
seem likely to only drive more business
away rather than bring the crowds back to
the ballparks, the As were able to add
players who may now be undervalued. (ii
ambi. Cabrera. Garciaparra and even the
trade for 1 lolliday. who is due to make big
money in free agency after this season.are
all players you never would have expected
the A's to make a move for in other years.
Except suddenly, when everyone else
started worrying about money. Oakland is
playing for today.
But if you're a sucker for the future, you
can still just watch their young arms Brett
Anderson and Trevor Cahill.They're iust a

couple of the best young pitchers in the
game — nothing too unusual for an As
roster.
The Ciiants. meanwhile, will trot out
one of the best rotations in baseball.
From pint-sized reigning Cy Young win
ner Tim Lincecum to fire-balling right
hander Matt Cain, to legendary ace
Randy Johnson (who should capture his
3<)()th career win this season). the Giants
rotation is bound to at least keep things
interesting. And if you're in the mood for
a good laugh, there's always Barry Zito's
contract scheduled to take the mound
once every five days. Just five years,
$101.5 million to go!
But there's more. These Giants just
might be a little more exciting at the plate,
led by the young Pablo Sandoval ITie
comparisons that have been Hung around
range from a young Albert Pujols (accord
ing to Giants legend Willie McCovey) to
Vladimir Guerrero, to even some whispers
of a slower Tony Gwynn.
While living up to any of those compar
isons would be a tall order indeed, if the
early returns are to be trusted, Sandoval
may just be the kind of player who defies
any comparison. Watch him play and
you'll see a hacker, a guy who will swing at
anything — a bad habit that will surely,
eventually, catch up with him. And vet.
look at the stat sheet and you'll see that it

hasn't. At least not yet.
Sandoval hit .357 in 145 big league
at-bats last season and walked just
four times. And yet he struck out just
14 times. A hacker he may be. but so
far. he's an effective one. And that's a
trend that's carried him forward into
this spring. He dominated winter
ball, a home run derbv against the

likes of Miguel Cabrera (search for it
on You lube) and batted .457 this
spring. His energy and love for the
game is effusive and infectious. In
short, if his numbers stay good, he's a
megastar in the making.
Not enough for you? Well, the se
rious prospect hound has another
Bay Area option. ITie San Jose Gi
ants will start the season with one of
the most stacked rosters in the minor
leagues. A Single-A affiliate of San
Francisco, the Giants can legitimate
ly claim four of the top 50 prospects
in the minors — lefty Madison Bum

garner, catcher Buster Posey, righty
Tim Alderson and first baseman
Angel Villalona are all key prospects
in the Giants' hopes going forward.
And there are plenty of other solid
prospects to go with the star power at
the top of San Jose's roster. So il you
can't afford a trip to a big league
park, San Jose could offer you a view
to Bay Area baseball's future.
Wherever you turn, baseball's
back. And just in the nick of time.
