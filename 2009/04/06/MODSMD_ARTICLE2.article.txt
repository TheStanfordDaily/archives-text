# Summit sets tone for service
## Westly calls on students to stand up for what they know is right 
### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Across campus, the demand for public serv
ice opportunities has increased as more students
seek ways to use their Stanford education to
contribute to society. While budget cuts and the
weakened economy have strained campus
resources, students and faculty remain opti
mistic that public service has a bright future at
Stanford.
On Saturday, the ASSU — in cooperation
with the President's Office, the Vice Provost
for Student Affairs, the Haas Center for
Public Service and other campus organiza
tions— sponsored the Stanford Service
Summit. Bringing together students, faculty
and alumni from all disciplines, the summit
examined and rethought the future of public
service on campus.
Former California State Comptroller Steve
Westly '78 MBA 'S3 gave the keynote presenta
tion and called upon Stanford students to
always stand up for what they know is right.
Drawing on his own experiences as a former
ASSU president —who in the spring of 1977
led student protests against the University's
investments in South Africa Westly claimed

that no student should rule out the benefits he
or she can create by becoming involved with
public service.
"Even with someone like me, with no train
ing. no background [in public service]... you
can make a difference," he said.
Westly told The Daily that there was a
strong need for young Californians to join pub
lic service.
"It's going to be a tough time. 1 think, for
Californians this year because of the difficult
economic straits we're in." Westly said. "But I
think, by the same token, there has never been a
more important time for the best and brightest
amongst us in California, and especially for
Stanford students, to come into the public see
tor."
Students attending the summit were asked to
give their opinions on what the University could
do to improve public service resources and to
envision what role public service might play on
campus in 2020. Gabriel Garcia, faculty director
of the I la as Center, spoke during a session on
public health about the importance of commu
nity awareness in medicine.
"One of the things we do poorly as a univer
sity is honoring the knowledge of the communi
ty," Garcia said. "If we are only inspired by the

previous literature to create the future litera
ture. then that may be a good academic life, but
it is a poor [citizenship]."
Garcia and his session group brainstormed
ideas for how public service could become more
ingrained in the academic culture of the
University. The ideas they put forth included
wide-sweeping reforms and additions to
Stanford curriculum, including the addition of a
public service GER and the creation of a school
of public health that would collaborate with
other schools in the state. In general, the stu
dents called for a greater faculty effort to inter
weave aspects of public service into course syl
labi.
""Mountains Beyond Mountains' influenced
the junior class with a lasting feeling of public
service." said Tommy Tobin "10. referring to the
Tracy Kidder work about Partners in Health co
founder Paul Farmer that was included in the
required summer reading for the Class of 2010.
"We could change the three books requirement
to make one of the books service-oriented."
As the principle source of public service
resources on campus, the I laas Center has seen
a dramatic increase in the number of students
