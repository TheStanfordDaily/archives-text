# Summit sets tone for service
## Westly calls on students to stand up for what they know is right 
### ANDREW VALENCIA SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Across campus, the demand for public serv
ice opportunities has increased as more students
seek ways to use their Stanford education to
contribute to society. While budget cuts and the
weakened economy have strained campus
resources, students and faculty remain opti
mistic that public service has a bright future at
Stanford.
On Saturday, the ASSU — in cooperation
with the President's Office, the Vice Provost
for Student Affairs, the Haas Center for
Public Service and other campus organiza
tions— sponsored the Stanford Service
Summit. Bringing together students, faculty
and alumni from all disciplines, the summit
examined and rethought the future of public
service on campus.
Former California State Comptroller Steve
Westly '78 MBA 'S3 gave the keynote presenta
tion and called upon Stanford students to
always stand up for what they know is right.
Drawing on his own experiences as a former
ASSU president —who in the spring of 1977
led student protests against the University's
investments in South Africa Westly claimed

that no student should rule out the benefits he
or she can create by becoming involved with
public service.
"Even with someone like me, with no train
ing. no background [in public service]... you
can make a difference," he said.
Westly told The Daily that there was a
strong need for young Californians to join pub
lic service.
"It's going to be a tough time. 1 think, for
Californians this year because of the difficult
economic straits we're in." Westly said. "But I
think, by the same token, there has never been a
more important time for the best and brightest
amongst us in California, and especially for
Stanford students, to come into the public see
tor."
Students attending the summit were asked to
give their opinions on what the University could
do to improve public service resources and to
envision what role public service might play on
campus in 2020. Gabriel Garcia, faculty director
of the I la as Center, spoke during a session on
public health about the importance of commu
nity awareness in medicine.
"One of the things we do poorly as a univer
sity is honoring the knowledge of the communi
ty," Garcia said. "If we are only inspired by the

previous literature to create the future litera
ture. then that may be a good academic life, but
it is a poor [citizenship]."
Garcia and his session group brainstormed
ideas for how public service could become more
ingrained in the academic culture of the
University. The ideas they put forth included
wide-sweeping reforms and additions to
Stanford curriculum, including the addition of a
public service GER and the creation of a school
of public health that would collaborate with
other schools in the state. In general, the stu
dents called for a greater faculty effort to inter
weave aspects of public service into course syl
labi.

interested in public service opportu
nities. According to Abbie
Connover. post-grad public service
coordinator for the Haas Center,
there has been increased attendance
at each recent workshop and infor
mation panel hosted by the center.
In addition, applications for the
I laas Center's postgraduate fellow
ships have increased by approxi
mately 20 percent since last year.
"As my colleagues and 1 reflect
on the trend, there is a conflation of
variables." Connover said, citing the
economy as well as the sense of pub
lic service inspired by Barack
Obama's election as likely factors.
At the same time that the Haas
Center is working to meet increased
demand, financial difficulties have
presented the center with the dilem
ma of how they will keep up. The
I laas Center, which receives only 10
percent of its funding from the
University general budget and as
much as 70 percent from the endow
ment. is reeling from both budget
cutbacks and endowment losses.
Interim Executive Director
Jackie Schmidt-Posner explained
that in order to keep up with student
demand, the center is working to
tighten finances through cutbacks in
operating expenses and personnel,
Ilie goal for the center is to be able
to balance its finances without cut
ting core services for students, espe
cially in this time of increased inter
est in public service.
"It's hearteninc for us to see so

many qualified students who want
to work in public service," Schmidt-
Posner said. "But it's disheartening
to not be able to meet all the
demand."
Schmidt-Posner said that the
Haas Center is working to keep
from having to cut student opportu
nities. but she warned that further
endowment loses could eventually
mean that the center will not be
able to offer as many fellowships.
However, she added, the center
continues to work with potential
donors whose contributions may
help offset current loses. She also
said that she is "delighted" that
interest in public service on campus
is growing, even with financial diffi
culties at hand.
ASSIJ President Jonny Dorsey
'09, one of the principle organizers
of the Service Summit, said that he
is enthusiastic about the role that
ASSU can play in public service on
campus. Plans are currently in devel
opment. he said, for a student-run
group that would offer tutoring
services to the children of
University custodial staff and other
workers. The role of the ASSU in
campus public service, he argued,
should include advocacy, assistance
and bringing students together to
serve the Stanford community.
"The ASSU has the ability to
bring people together around a
topic," Dorsey said. "We want to
keep expanding the demand and
keep meeting it."
Dorsey admitted, however, that
the ASSU does not have the means
to be an equal partner with the I laas
Center and that voluntary student
organizations (VSOs) must initiate
the bulwark of public service activi

ties on campus. With Dorsey's term
in office quickly approaching its
conclusion, he acknowledged that
his administration has done all they
can for public service on campus
and that the next ASSU Executives
will have to pick up the torch.
At the conclusion of the Service
Summit. University President John
Hennessy offered a congratulatory
video message to those who had
participated in the event.
"One of the things I've found
quite remarkable is our students'
willingness to participate in public
service," I lennessy said.
The President's remarks were
followed by the unveiling of the
Stanford Vision 2020 platform, an
outline of goals designed to bring
public service to the forefront of
University culture within the next
11 years.The goals included facilitat
ing students to "leverage their
Stanford education to create public
impact." and to engage with the
greater community.
The final event of the summit, a
fireside chat featuring Garcia and
physician Larry Brilliant, a member
of the l c ->73 World Health
Organization program to eradicate
smallpox. Brilliant shared stories
about his life, from time spent in a
Himalayan monastery to marching
with Martin Luther King. Jr.. and
challenged Stanford students to use
their education for the greater good.
"The life of the mind is impor
tant. but the life of the heart is more
important," Brilliant said.
Those students who attended the
Service Summit were generally
impressed by the event. Rebekah
Lucien "12 came to the summit with
a long history of interest in tutoring

and public service through medi
cine. She believes that serving the
broader community is becoming
more accessible and important to
the average student.
"I feel that people are now aware
that, in whatever career they're in.
there are opportunities for service
within it," she said.

As for the future of public serv
ice at Stanford, the University will
continue to place important empha
sis on this facet of education even
with financial difficulties at the
moment. In addition to its Vision
2020 goals, the University has laid
down plans to establish Branner as a
public service-oriented dorm and

create an online database of public
service opportunities available to
students. All initiatives come with
the end goal of fostering an endur
ing culture of public service on cam
pus.

of the Service Summit, said that he
is enthusiastic about the role that
ASSU can play in public service on
campus. Plans are currently in devel
opment. he said, for a student-run
group that would offer tutoring
services to the children of
University custodial staff and other
workers. The role of the ASSU in
campus public service, he argued,
should include advocacy, assistance
and bringing students together to
serve the Stanford community.
"The ASSU has the ability to
bring people together around a
topic," Dorsey said. "We want to
keep expanding the demand and
keep meeting it."
Dorsey admitted, however, that
the ASSU does not have the means
to be an equal partner with the I laas
Center and that voluntary student
organizations (VSOs) must initiate
the bulwark of public service activi

ties on campus. With Dorsey's term
in office quickly approaching its
conclusion, he acknowledged that
his administration has done all they
can for public service on campus
and that the next ASSU Executives
will have to pick up the torch.
At the conclusion of the Service
Summit. University President John
Hennessy offered a congratulatory
video message to those who had
participated in the event.
"One of the things I've found
quite remarkable is our students'
willingness to participate in public
service," I lennessy said.
The President's remarks were
followed by the unveiling of the
Stanford Vision 2020 platform, an
outline of goals designed to bring
public service to the forefront of
University culture within the next
11 years.The goals included facilitat
ing students to "leverage their
Stanford education to create public
impact." and to engage with the
greater community.

about his life, from time spent in a

challenged Stanford students to use
their education for the greater good.
"The life of the mind is impor

important," Brilliant said.
Those students who attended the
Service Summit were generally
impressed by the event. Rebekah

a long history of interest in tutoring

and public service through medi

broader community is becoming
more accessible and important to
the average student.
"I feel that people are now aware
that, in whatever career they're in.
there are opportunities for service
within it," she said.

As for the future of public serv
ice at Stanford, the University will
continue to place important empha
sis on this facet of education even
with financial difficulties at the
moment. In addition to its Vision
2020 goals, the University has laid
down plans to establish Branner as a
public service-oriented dorm and

create an online database of public
service opportunities available to
students. All initiatives come with
the end goal of fostering an endur
ing culture of public service on cam
pus.

Across campus, the demand for public serv
ice opportunities has increased as more students
seek ways to use their Stanford education to
contribute to society. While budget cuts and the
weakened economy have strained campus
resources, students and faculty remain opti
mistic that public service has a bright future at
Stanford.
On Saturday, the ASSU — in cooperation
with the President's Office, the Vice Provost
for Student Affairs, the Haas Center for
Public Service and other campus organiza
tions— sponsored the Stanford Service
Summit. Bringing together students, faculty
and alumni from all disciplines, the summit
examined and rethought the future of public
service on campus.
Former California State Comptroller Steve
Westly '78 MBA 'S3 gave the keynote presenta
tion and called upon Stanford students to
always stand up for what they know is right.
Drawing on his own experiences as a former
ASSU president —who in the spring of 1977
led student protests against the University's
investments in South Africa Westly claimed

that no student should rule out the benefits he
or she can create by becoming involved with
public service.
"Even with someone like me, with no train
ing. no background [in public service]... you
can make a difference," he said.
Westly told The Daily that there was a
strong need for young Californians to join pub
lic service.
"It's going to be a tough time. 1 think, for
Californians this year because of the difficult
economic straits we're in." Westly said. "But I
think, by the same token, there has never been a
more important time for the best and brightest
amongst us in California, and especially for
Stanford students, to come into the public see
tor."
Students attending the summit were asked to
give their opinions on what the University could
do to improve public service resources and to
envision what role public service might play on
campus in 2020. Gabriel Garcia, faculty director
of the I la as Center, spoke during a session on
public health about the importance of commu
nity awareness in medicine.
"One of the things we do poorly as a univer
sity is honoring the knowledge of the communi
ty," Garcia said. "If we are only inspired by the

previous literature to create the future litera
ture. then that may be a good academic life, but
it is a poor [citizenship]."
Garcia and his session group brainstormed
ideas for how public service could become more
ingrained in the academic culture of the
University. The ideas they put forth included
wide-sweeping reforms and additions to
Stanford curriculum, including the addition of a
public service GER and the creation of a school
of public health that would collaborate with
other schools in the state. In general, the stu
dents called for a greater faculty effort to inter
weave aspects of public service into course syl
labi.
""Mountains Beyond Mountains' influenced
the junior class with a lasting feeling of public
service." said Tommy Tobin "10. referring to the
Tracy Kidder work about Partners in Health co
founder Paul Farmer that was included in the
required summer reading for the Class of 2010.
"We could change the three books requirement
to make one of the books service-oriented."
As the principle source of public service
resources on campus, the I laas Center has seen
a dramatic increase in the number of students

interested in public service opportu
nities. According to Abbie
Connover. post-grad public service
coordinator for the Haas Center,
there has been increased attendance
at each recent workshop and infor
mation panel hosted by the center.
In addition, applications for the
I laas Center's postgraduate fellow
ships have increased by approxi
mately 20 percent since last year.
"As my colleagues and 1 reflect
on the trend, there is a conflation of
variables." Connover said, citing the
economy as well as the sense of pub
lic service inspired by Barack
Obama's election as likely factors.
At the same time that the Haas
Center is working to meet increased
demand, financial difficulties have
presented the center with the dilem
ma of how they will keep up. The
I laas Center, which receives only 10
percent of its funding from the
University general budget and as
much as 70 percent from the endow
ment. is reeling from both budget
cutbacks and endowment losses.
Interim Executive Director
Jackie Schmidt-Posner explained
that in order to keep up with student
demand, the center is working to
tighten finances through cutbacks in
operating expenses and personnel,
Ilie goal for the center is to be able
to balance its finances without cut
ting core services for students, espe
cially in this time of increased inter
est in public service.
"It's hearteninc for us to see so

many qualified students who want
to work in public service," Schmidt-
Posner said. "But it's disheartening
to not be able to meet all the
demand."
Schmidt-Posner said that the
Haas Center is working to keep
from having to cut student opportu
nities. but she warned that further
endowment loses could eventually
mean that the center will not be
able to offer as many fellowships.
However, she added, the center
continues to work with potential
donors whose contributions may
help offset current loses. She also
said that she is "delighted" that
interest in public service on campus
is growing, even with financial diffi
culties at hand.
