Stanford women's basketball's 2(X)8-2(X)9
season came to humbling conclusion Sunday
night as the Cardinal fell to top-seeded

Louis' Scottrade Center.

digit points, while Stanford's Jayne Appel tied
UConn's Renee Montgomery in scoring with
26. The defeat marked the end of a 20-game
Cardinal winning streak and dashed any
hopes for this year's squad to earn the school's
third national title. UConn. meanwhile, will
proceed to Tuesday's championship game
against Louisville, which defeated Oklahoma
in Sunday's first semifinal game.
Stanford (33-5) was the last team to defeat
Connecticut, eliminating them in last year's
semifinals by a score of 82-73. Sunday's
rematch, however, was all UConn. I"he

tinued to control the ball for most of the first
half. After just six minutes of play, the ( ardinal
had turned the ball over six times and had
taken it away from UConn only once. Ihe
Huskies took advantage of Stanford's offen
sive missteps, scoring 13 points off turnovers in
the first half, while holding the Cardinal to
only two. UConn threw Stanford's defense off
its game as well, attacking from all angles and
positions. Four Husky players had at least one
field goal after only four minutes of play.
Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer was
impressed by the preparedness of the I luskies.
"They're an extremely aggressive, athletic
team." she said. "Their whole team came out
and made plays that they had to make, lliey

don't make a lot of mistakes, and they don't
take bad shots."
Stanford certainly had chances to score,
trailing the I luskies in attempted shots by only
five after the first half (2 l ) to 34) and one alter
40 minutes (h2 to 63). Most of the Cardinal
shots came from leading scorer Jayne Appel,

played with toughness, leading the Cardinal to

two consecutive baskets, one coming after she

took a hard fall
Appcl received relatively little help as the
game went on. however, and that small lead
proved to be the only time Stanford wasn't
playing catch-up to I ("onn. No other C ardinal
player had more than four points until kayla
Pederson scored at the 10:15 mark, by which
point Appcl had scored 17. Free throws and
three-pointers proved to be a struggle as well
