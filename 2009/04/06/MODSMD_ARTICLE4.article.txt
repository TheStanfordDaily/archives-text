first five and a half minutes of the second half.

Stanford women's basketball's 2(X)8-2(X)9
season came to humbling conclusion Sunday
night as the Cardinal fell to top-seeded
Connecticut. 83-64 in semifinal play at St.
Louis' Scottrade Center.
Four Husky players finished with double
digit points, while Stanford's Jayne Appel tied
UConn's Renee Montgomery in scoring with
26. The defeat marked the end of a 20-game
Cardinal winning streak and dashed any
hopes for this year's squad to earn the school's
third national title. UConn. meanwhile, will
proceed to Tuesday's championship game
against Louisville, which defeated Oklahoma
in Sunday's first semifinal game.
Stanford (33-5) was the last team to defeat
Connecticut, eliminating them in last year's
semifinals by a score of 82-73. Sunday's
rematch, however, was all UConn. I"he
I luskies (38-0) won the opening tip. and con
tinued to control the ball for most of the first
half. After just six minutes of play, the ( ardinal
had turned the ball over six times and had
taken it away from UConn only once. Ihe
Huskies took advantage of Stanford's offen
sive missteps, scoring 13 points off turnovers in
the first half, while holding the Cardinal to
only two. UConn threw Stanford's defense off
its game as well, attacking from all angles and
positions. Four Husky players had at least one
field goal after only four minutes of play.
Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer was
impressed by the preparedness of the I luskies.
"They're an extremely aggressive, athletic
team." she said. "Their whole team came out
and made plays that they had to make, lliey

don't make a lot of mistakes, and they don't
take bad shots."
Stanford certainly had chances to score,
trailing the I luskies in attempted shots by only
five after the first half (2 l ) to 34) and one alter
40 minutes (h2 to 63). Most of the Cardinal
shots came from leading scorer Jayne Appel,
who tallied 10 of Stanford's first 14 points. She
played with toughness, leading the Cardinal to
;i 14 13 lead midway through the first half with
two consecutive baskets, one coming after she

took a hard fall
Appcl received relatively little help as the
game went on. however, and that small lead
proved to be the only time Stanford wasn't
playing catch-up to I ("onn. No other C ardinal
player had more than four points until kayla
Pederson scored at the 10:15 mark, by which
point Appcl had scored 17. Free throws and
three-pointers proved to be a struggle as well

Despite tallying 26 points, Stanford star center Jayne Appel was unable to provide enough to
defeat top-seeded UConn. Appel led the Cardinal offensively with a strong tourney showing.
— Stanford didn't score in either
category until well into the second
half.
VanDerveer. while insisting her
team made a solid effort on re
bounds and other areas, acknowl
edged her team's struggle to find the
basket, especially in the first half.
"We took some bad shots. 1
thought, early," she said. "Some
quick shots. We missed some shots
that we needed to make. We really
have to help ourselves more by
knocking down shots and making
free throws. Those are things that as
a team we have to do to be able to
stay in it."
UConn didn't give Stanford a
chance to find its swagger after the
intermission, opening up the second
half with a 13-0 run led by Renee
Montgomery and Maya Moore, who
finished the game with a combined
50 points. Despite a series of substi

tut ions by VanDerveer, Stanford
simply couldn't find an answer to
UConn's dynamic offense, and with
12:09 left, found itself buried in a 60-
29 hole — by far the biggest deficit
Stanford has faced all season. While
the Cardinal was able to open up its
offense a bit after this point,outscor
ing UConn 25-23 over the final 12
minutes, it was simply too late to
climb back into competition.
Connecticut head coach Geno
Auriemma, giv ing credit to Stanford
for a great season, was proud of his
team's performance.
"I can't say enough about the ef
fort these kids put forth, especially
defensively," he said. "[Moore and
Montgomery) were unbelievable.
Everyone was just so determined to
play one more game."
The Cardinal, meanwhile, is taking
the loss in stride. Despite the lopsided
defeat, the women seemed far from
discouraged. Many of them, including
sophomore guard Jeanette Pohlen.
believe that Sunday's loss will only
help improve their team.
"We're young." Pohlen said. "We
have our All-American, [Jayne

Appel], coming back and we're just a
young team that's still growing. The
fact that we made it this far is amazing.
Of course, making the finals was our
goal, but we've still accomplished a
lot. We know what we can do. we
know what we are capable 01. and I
think we'll just keep getting better and
better."
VanDerveer showed confidence
that her team could indeed learn such
lessons from Sunday's loss, citing the
game as an example of the strong
character her team already possesses.
" Ilie best thing that happened was
the fact that when things were not
going our way. our kids stayed with
things really well." she said, "fliey
competed. They weren't sniping at
each other. They didn't have excuses
when they came to the bench. 1 was so
proud of that. We've really grown up a
lot this season.
The Huskies may be the ones
moving on. But in a way, so too are
the Cardinal women, setting their
sights on the 2009-2010 season in
which all but two players will return.
The team's attitude, even after the
semifinals loss makes it obvious that
despite the score Sunday, the Pac-10
Champion Stanford women have
much to be proud of and plenty to
look forward to.
