## Coalition sets sights on Senate Students for a Better Stanford aim for 12 of 15 Senate seats 
### MARISA LANDICHO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students for a Better Stanford (SBS).
a new coalition of 12 Senate hopefuls,
share a flashy Web site and a strong
desire to get elected â€” but no uniting
ideological vision, according to the mem
bers.
Before the start ol campaign week,
the 12 candidates, led by current Senate
Chair Shelley Gao '11 and candidate
Zachary Warma '11. allied themselves
publicly.
"These are 12 people with a verv com
mon vision ol what student government
should look like and form a responsive
Senate that would really help the under
graduate population." said Warma. who
is also a Dailv columnist.
But when pressed on what their "com
mon vision" entails. SBS candidates
could offer little more than a pledge to
be civil if elected to the Senate.
"What unifies lis is how v\e will con
duct our business."' said SBS candidate
Adam Creasman 11. "We all work well
together and are willing to compromise."
Other candidates have questioned the
intentions of SBS. saying their stated
credo of working for a better Stanford
carries little meaning, as the notion of
Senate candidates hoping to improve the
University is seeminglv obvious.
"Every single person running for
Senate should want to improve Stanford
in even, way" said Michael Cruz 12.
questioning the SBS moniker C'tuz is
endorsed by the Students ol Color
Coalition (SC)CC).
(ietting elected
The student candidates that comprise
SBS do share one idea getting them
selves elected to the I ndeigraduate
Senate.
