## Coalition sets sights on Senate Students for a Better Stanford aim for 12 of 15 Senate seats 
### MARISA LANDICHO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Students for a Better Stanford (SBS).
a new coalition of 12 Senate hopefuls,
share a flashy Web site and a strong
desire to get elected — but no uniting
ideological vision, according to the mem
bers.
Before the start ol campaign week,
the 12 candidates, led by current Senate
Chair Shelley Gao '11 and candidate
Zachary Warma '11. allied themselves
publicly.
"These are 12 people with a verv com
mon vision ol what student government
should look like and form a responsive
Senate that would really help the under
graduate population." said Warma. who
is also a Dailv columnist.
But when pressed on what their "com
mon vision" entails. SBS candidates
could offer little more than a pledge to
be civil if elected to the Senate.
"What unifies lis is how v\e will con
duct our business."' said SBS candidate
Adam Creasman 11. "We all work well
together and are willing to compromise."
Other candidates have questioned the
intentions of SBS. saying their stated
credo of working for a better Stanford
carries little meaning, as the notion of
Senate candidates hoping to improve the
University is seeminglv obvious.
"Every single person running for
Senate should want to improve Stanford
in even, way" said Michael Cruz 12.
questioning the SBS moniker C'tuz is
endorsed by the Students ol Color
Coalition (SC)CC).
(ietting elected
The student candidates that comprise
SBS do share one idea getting them
selves elected to the I ndeigraduate
Senate.
Several SBS candidates com
mented on the synergies that ean be
harnessed in a coalition of 12. The
group has a Web site, staged a photo
shoot and has collaborated exten
sively on advertising tactics.
Although the SBS candidates
quickly denied the intention of
installing all 12 of their members on
the Senate, Warma admitted the
advantages of running in a recogniz
able coalition.
"In the messiness of student pol
itics. with 12 people working togeth
er. thbre is going to be strength in
numbers," he said.
SBS purposely selected 12 mem
bers. three less than the available
Senate seats, so as to avoid the per
ception of a monopoly.
Raillan Brooks *12 echoed his
sentiments and argued the group
was more "altruistic" than observers
might think, highlighting their over
lying goal to improve the Senate.
However, in regards to getting
elected. Brooks acknowledged,
"You increase the statistical likeli
hood by pooling resources."
Still. SBS candidates would not
admit to simply hoping to dominate
the Senate.
"1 don't think anyone here can
say we 12 are the most competent
people running for Senate," said
SBS candidate Alan Guo "11. "What
I can say is that these are the people
I have met and worked with for
months now, and I think they are the
people I know are the most compe
tent senators."
Diverse and conflicting views
SBS members pride themselves
upon their diversity, championing
the fact that SBS-affiliated candi
dates have secured endorsements
from every group on campus.
Endorsed by groups ranging from
The Stanford Review to the
Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC), individual members have
varied, and conflicting, platforms.
However, past the glossy group
photos and the lofty vision, the stu
dents who compose SBS simply
don't agree on the issues.

date Alex Katz '12 has adopted a
position on community centers

Coalition or clique?
Alliances during election season
are not uncommon, but typically
these coalitions have been based
upon endorsements announcing
shared political views, as seen most
notably in the past few years bv
SOCC.
SBS. however, has changed the
elections game by announcing a
self-selecting alliance, essentially
an endorsement of themselves.
While led by Gao and Warma. SBS
is said to be the brainchild of out
going Senators Luukas lives '09.
Stuart Baimel 09 and Patrick
Cordova '09, who were referenced
as the "founders" by Varun
Sivaram. lives and Baimel are both

current Daily columnists; Baimel is
also the columns editor.
Nevertheless, charges of exclu
sivity and elitism dog the ambigu
ous SBS.
"[SBS| seemed too exclusive to
me," wrote non-SBS and non-
SOCC candidate Ben Laufer '12 in
an email to ITie Daily. "It is hard
for me to believe that this almost
clique-like group represents the
best interests for everyone."
Laufer was never approached to
join the group, hut also maintained
that he never felt he was unable to
join.
Michael Tubbs "12 was less for
giving of the coalition. Tubbs. after
receiving the most petit ion votes
and a SOCC endorsement, dropped
out of the race, but cast doubt on
how members were recruited.
"I don't see why I wasn't
approached ... if this coalition was
really about being inclusive," he
wrote in an email to The Daily. "It
is incredibly presumptuous to sin
gle out 10 people out of 50."
Forgoing a formal application
process. SBS members relied on
personal connections to recruit
other candidates.
After the election
Executive candidate Matt
Sprague '10 worried over the brew
ing controversies in the Senate
race.
"1 don't want it to turn out to be
a huge battle." he said. "At the end
of the day. Undergraduate Senate
is the really the only way for under
graduates to get heard — to waste
a second arguing with each other is
wasting priceless time."
SBS members were unclear
about what would happen to the
group after this week's elections,
saying that they haven't completely
planned out their next steps.
Several members said they were
not sure what would happen to the
SBS brand itself after the election.
Hie coalition members contend
ed that they have not allied them
selves against any group on cam
pus. but have had little success in
convincing others of this fact.
Warma. trying to clarify the pur
pose of SBS. said. "This is not a
political drama of us versus them
— this is not a dichotomy. We are
pro-us and making the school a
better place."

upon their diversity, championing
the fact that SBS-affiliated candi
dates have secured endorsements
from every group on campus.
Endorsed by groups ranging from
The Stanford Review to the
Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC), individual members have
varied, and conflicting, platforms.
However, past the glossy group
photos and the lofty vision, the stu
dents who compose SBS simply
don't agree on the issues.

"On community center funding.
I don't think -that every dollar
should continue to go there." Kat/
said. "I think that some cuts are
allowable."
Brooks vehemently disagreed
and prioritized funding to commu
nity centers.
"I feel community centers are
extremely important." he said.
Coalition or clique?
Alliances during election season
are not uncommon, but typically
these coalitions have been based
upon endorsements announcing
shared political views, as seen most
notably in the past few years bv
SOCC.
SBS. however, has changed the
elections game by announcing a
self-selecting alliance, essentially
an endorsement of themselves.
While led by Gao and Warma. SBS
is said to be the brainchild of out
going Senators Luukas lives '09.
Stuart Baimel 09 and Patrick
Cordova '09, who were referenced
as the "founders" by Varun
Sivaram. lives and Baimel are both

current Daily columnists; Baimel is
also the columns editor.
Nevertheless, charges of exclu
sivity and elitism dog the ambigu
ous SBS.
"[SBS| seemed too exclusive to
me," wrote non-SBS and non-
SOCC candidate Ben Laufer '12 in
an email to ITie Daily. "It is hard
for me to believe that this almost
clique-like group represents the
best interests for everyone."
Laufer was never approached to
join the group, hut also maintained
that he never felt he was unable to
join.
Michael Tubbs "12 was less for
giving of the coalition. Tubbs. after
receiving the most petit ion votes
and a SOCC endorsement, dropped
out of the race, but cast doubt on
how members were recruited.
"I don't see why I wasn't
approached ... if this coalition was
really about being inclusive," he
wrote in an email to The Daily. "It
is incredibly presumptuous to sin
gle out 10 people out of 50."
Forgoing a formal application
process. SBS members relied on
personal connections to recruit
other candidates.
After the election
Executive candidate Matt
Sprague '10 worried over the brew
ing controversies in the Senate
race.
"1 don't want it to turn out to be
a huge battle." he said. "At the end
of the day. Undergraduate Senate
is the really the only way for under
graduates to get heard — to waste
a second arguing with each other is
wasting priceless time."
SBS members were unclear
about what would happen to the
group after this week's elections,
saying that they haven't completely
planned out their next steps.
Several members said they were
not sure what would happen to the
SBS brand itself after the election.
Hie coalition members contend
ed that they have not allied them
selves against any group on cam
pus. but have had little success in
convincing others of this fact.
Warma. trying to clarify the pur
pose of SBS. said. "This is not a
political drama of us versus them
— this is not a dichotomy. We are
pro-us and making the school a
better place."
