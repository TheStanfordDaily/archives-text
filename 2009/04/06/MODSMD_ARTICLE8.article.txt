## SOCC endorses 12 Senate candidates 
### ZOE RICHARDS STAFF WRITER 
The historically powerful Students
of Color Coalition (SOCC) has
endorsed 12 Undergraduate Senate
candidates in this week's election.
Committed to protecting commu
nity centers, reducing Voluntary
Student Organizations (VSO) costs,
increasing ASSU transparency and
safeguarding diversity. SOCC
endorsed candidates have pledged to
a vision that also directly addresses
issues of diversity in their personal
platforms.

Anton Zietsman "12 affirmed an
interest that seemed to be shared hv
ail of the SOCC-endorsed candidates
in protecting the sanctity of commu
nity centers in the face of budget
slashing.
"Because of the economic crisis,
we have focused on protecting the
community centers when it comes to
budget Lilts." Zietsman said. "What I
would like to do as a senator is pro
mote that more."
Senate candidates seeking the
stamp of approval from SOCC
undergo a rigorous application
process before the hoard reaches
consensus on which candidates will
be endorsed. The process includes
screening applicants based on their
responses to questions that particu
larly address SOCC issues and an
interview for finalists, cutting a typi
cal applicant pool of 20 to 30 down to
anywhere between 10 to 15
endorsees. SOCC board members
span a variety of student organiza
tions dedicated to promoting diversi
ty on all fronts of student social and
academic life.
Ashley Anderson '09. of SOCC.
noted the importance of the coalition
as a mechanism for setting select
candidates apart from the pack.
"In a Senate race in which candi
dates tend to be indistinguishable
from one another based on the
majority of their platform points, the
SOCC endorsement functions as a
wav for voters to readilv distinguish

which candidates have communities
of color in mind and will advocate for
issues that are specifically important
to these communities," she said.
SOCC-endorsed candidates have
promised to push against so-called
"acts of intolerance" at the
University. This devotion has seen
candidates focus on everything from
dispelling gender biases to ensuring
that offensive party themes that
play into stereotypes are reconsid
ered.
Also committed to faculty diver
sity, SOCC-endorsed candidates
have vowed to play a part in pre
serving and communicating the
importance of a diverse staff to
Executive officers and school
administrators.
However, being a poster child for
this coalition doesn't mean that these
candidates will not have their indi
vidual differences on various issues if
elected to the Senate. Ben Jensen 12
pointed out the plurality of views
even among SOCC candidates.
"We're all very different people,
and we do represent SOCC. but for
very different reasons," Jensen said.
However. Matt Miller '12 con

tended that these differences will,
ideally, not interfere with Senate
decision-making.
"1 would believe [the Senate] to
be very similar to what [SOCC can
didates] are doing now." Miller said.
"You have those informal and neces
sary. impromptu meetings on things
that aren't quite clear. That air of col
laboration will definitely translate
into the senate."
It is this kind of shared attitude
about how to address problems in
the Senate in addition to their shared
vision and commitment to address
ing issues of diversity on campus that
defines SOCC-endorsed candidates.
As for disagreement, all agreed
that they do not consider themselves
as SOCC-endorsed candidates to
simply be a monolithic force. Some
feel that bringing problems to the
table and allowing them to be dis
cussed openly might be the best way
to bring about progress in the Senate.
"Yes. we're going to butt heads."
Wharton said. "And that's the best
wav to work out differences."
