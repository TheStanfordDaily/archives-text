## Lyman, Werner campaign for hope, change Candidates call for a revamping of the Executive 
### ELLEN HUET CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
During last November's presidential
election, candidates and citizens alike
harped on change. This week, the executive
slate of John Lvman '11 and Garrett Werner
•10. two candidates whose platform promis
es to highlight issues that, until now. the
ASSU has never even considered discussing,
are pushing the concept of change to new
heights.
Although their slate is named "Just A
Couple Of Affable. Public Service-Oriented
Guys Trying To Help The Student Body
Exercise Its Voice While Also Bridging The
Gap Between Our Peers And The
Faculty/Administrative Complex
(JACOAPSOGTESVW B( i BOPATFAC),"
Lyman and Werner are not to be confused
with the typical executive slate. Boasting the
elusive endorsement of the Stanford
Chaparral — the only Chappie-endorsed
slate or candidate in this vear's entire elec

tion — JACOAPSOGTESVWBC. BOPAT
FAC is calling for a complete revamping of
the executive position, focusing specifically
on the student voice, unity under pressure
and a standardized greeting system to
encourage open communication.
The slate's presidential candidate.
Lyman, sat down with TTie Daily to discuss
his vision for Stanford's future. Lyman said
that he. like others, was initially inspired by
the leadership of current ASSU Execs Jonny
Dorsev '09 and Fagan Harris '09. He specifi
cally cited a video in which Dorsey and
Harris make an appeal to the student body
to engage in more public service.
"Since [the video], we've been inspired
— not just by what they said, but how they
said it." Lyman explained. "After all. the
message was to better exercise the student
voice, and their voices sounded hearty and
had great projection."
TTie slate's main platform extends
around helping the entire student voice
emulate the qualities of Dorsey and Harris.
Lyman stressed that in the interest of feasi
bility, the slate will focus on tangible goals:
making the student voice "more booming,
louder and more in-your-face," as well as
touching elbows while projecting.

"in the end. we have these general ideals
that involve various metrics of the student
voice that we want to improve," he said. "We
also want to give the student voice a slightly
nicer timbre — it's probably the most ambi
tious of our goals at this point, but I think
the timbre is really going to be key if we
want our student voice to be ready for a cap
pella tryouts next fall."
The slate also showed the financial savvy
and awareness necessary in such an eco
nomic crisis, explaining that their budgetary
concerns would focus around choosing
between expensive voice lessons or studio
time with synthesizers to achieve the end
goal of vocal excellence.
Other platform initiatives lor JACOAP
SOGTESVWBGBOPATFAC include a
standardized Stanford greeting and more
emphasis on elbow contact throughout the
student government.
"If we could somehow apply some of the
formalities of creating a secret handshake
and make it open to everyone, we wouldn't
have this problem of people approaching
each other from different age groups and
being at a loss," he said. "It would be nice if
we knew what kind of greeting was appro
priate. Maybe a belly tap."

When asked about their fellow executive
candidates, the Lyman-Werner slate
expressed serious concern about David
Gobaud 'OS M.S. iO, stating that his cam
paign seemed to be asking students to "go
bald" with him. Lyman worried that the
Gobaud-de la Torre platform was rushing
students into "growing up too fast." and he
promised to adhere to "ushering the student
body through young adulthood to normal
adulthood gradually and comfortably in
the interests of student safety and well
being.
As for their chances. Lyman and Werner
perhaps best sum it up in the ASSU's official
voter guide.
"You miss KM) percent of the shots that
you don't take, so we've decided to give this
student government thing a try — for better
or for worse." they wrote. "Our shot at
ASSU Exec will hopefully be a slam dunk,
but we are also prepared to launch an air
ball, a brick, an off-the-backboard or even
one of those weird spinners that goes
around the rim a bunch of times and gets
everyone going all 'ooooh' before it catches
a bad bounce and Hies out."
