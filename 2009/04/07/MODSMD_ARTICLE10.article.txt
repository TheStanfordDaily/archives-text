## EDITORIAL Gobaud/de la Torre for ASSU Executive 
### 
Alter sitting down with each of the
three Executive slates Sunday after
noon, the Editorial Hoard deliberat
ed and came to the unanimous conclusion
that David Ciohaud and Jay de la lor re are
exceptionally impressive candidates and the
clear choice to lead the ASSU during the
2009-2010 school year.
David Gobaud's unrivaled command of
the issues and his record of results, along
with Jay de la Torre's evident commitment to
public service and mental and sexual health,
struck the perfect tone when the pair sat
down with The Daily over the weekend.
While both the I.yntan/Werner and
I lauser/Sprague slates brought some fresh
ideas to the table. Gobaud/de la Torre
brought an avalanche of common-sense pro
posals— and. just as importantly, the leg
work and accountability mechanisms to
hack them up.
The slate's sustainability agenda serves as
a good example of their details oriented
platform. The candidates want to make
Iresidder and Old Union zero percent
waste buildings and they bemoaned the lack
of composting bins in the dining areas The
ability ol Stanford's composting facility to
turn away contaminated materials and even
fine Stanford non compostable contamina
tion causes the dining halls to refrain from
offering a composting option at Iresidder.
As a result. (iobaud and de la lorre pledge
to lobby the administration to include condi
tions in the leases that will require compost
ing availability. Additionally, because Union
Square is contractually obligated to use the
11011 compostable cups provided by Pepsi,
the slate pledges to work with the procure
ment office to pressure Pepsi to offer a com
postable cup. While I lauser/Sprague offer
proposals like a (ireen 1 .iving E(' and work
ing with Stanford I )ining to expand sustain
ability practices, their platform is frustrating
l\ short on specifics. ()n this issue and others,
it was clear that (iobaud and de la Torre had
done their homework.
But (iobaud and de la lorre also offer a
broader vision of campus diversity. As a
computer science co-terminal student,
(iobaud would be the first graduate student
ASSU President in recent memory, bring
ing a unique perspective to the question of
reaching the S.OOO strong grad student pop
ulation. Uniquely among the slates, (iob
aud/de la lorre emphasized graduate stu
dent issues for example, the lack of de
pendent health care that can place a huge
financial burden on graduate students with
children that are off the radar screens of
most undergraduates. De la lorre. mean
while. volunteered his status as a financial
aid student and protested the expense of
ASSI I lections, which can prove to be a fi
nancial barrier for some students looking to
run. I ike I lauser/Sprague. the slate sup
ports very modest campaign spending lim
its that will even the playing field, litis sen
timent also resonated in the form of a pro
posal to equalize board bill rates across
dorms and Row houses so that no student
would choose l<> forgo a chance to live in
preferable housing because of extra ex
pense.

Additionally, the slate impressed the
hoard with its diverse reeord of achievement
in the public service sphere. Gobaud, after
his slate's close loss to Dorsey/Harris in last
year's ASSII Executive elections, has served
as the ASSU's Executive Operations Man
ager. overseeing volunteer projects like the
2(M)9 Dance Marathon Hack-a-thon and —
near and dear to our hearts — the ASSU
Student Events Calendar, which David un
dertook in response to an editorial that ran
in this space decrying the lack of such a cen
tralized. one-stop calendar for the Stanford
student community, .lav de la Torre, mean
while. has served as a Haas Center Public
Service Fellow and was a lead organizer for
last weekend's Stanford Service Summit,
which was widely hailed as a major success.
The editorial board does not mean to di
minish the valuable experience of Bennett
Mauser and Matthew Sprague, who bring a
tremendous amount of financial acumen
and managerial experience to their cam
paign. Both Stanford Student Enterprises
veterans, the two have overseen sizeable
staffs and have experience with employee
evaluation and bonus incentives, which they
pledge to make an integral facet of their ad
ministration. if elected.They admirably sug
gested that even their salary be at least
somewhat performance-based, perhaps only
fully delivered il the ASSl 1 Senate approves
of their work.
But while their experience is enviable, we
question its direct transferability to the
ASSlJ's top job. As (iobaud and de la Torre
pointed out. the ASSU Executive does not
set the budget, and is mostly responsible for
promoting student interests and enacting
proposals, not managing an endowment. Be
sides. the editorial board reacted favorably
to some of C iobaud/de la Torre's innovative
plans to hold themselves accountable —
among other ideas, the slate hopes to hold
waste audits both before and after adding
"These ( ome f rom Trees" stickers toTresid
der paper towel dispensers to see if they
have any measurable impact.
When considering the endorsement, the
editorial board sought to answer a few basic
questions: Which slate is most likely to deliv
er on its platform? Which slate can bring the
most passion and charisma to bear when ad
vocating student interests? And which slate
has demonstrated the most knowledge and
competence? When considering those fac
tors. we felt there was one slate that stood
out from the rest. With their bountiful plat
lorm. well-researched and thoughtful pro
posals and personal embodiment of campus
diversity, the (iobaud/de la Torre slate de
serves your vote on April 9 and 10.
Correction

I iist Tuesday's editorial incorrectly stated
that Wellness Room counselors only receive
three total hours of training each. In actuali
ty. counselors attend additional training ses
sions for two hours every week after their
initial three-hour training. The editorial
hoard initially questioned this apparently in
sufficient training and regrets the error.
