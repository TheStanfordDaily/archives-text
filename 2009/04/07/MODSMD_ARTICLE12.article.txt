## Emily Grubert Jumping off the coal train 
### 
No train tracks cross Campus Drive.
This is unfortunate for at least two
reasons: first. I have to walk all the
way to Palo Alto to save damsels in distress.
Second, well, have you seen that warning
sign featuring an exploding hiker in the
right lane of Palm Drive, ostensibly getting
hit by a car turning onto Campus?
.. . Can you imagine how awesome a
similar sign with a train on it would be?
But I digress.
No train tracks cross Campus Drive, but
we have a 45 MW power plant within the
bounds of Campus Drive. And here lies my
point: how often do you see a giant moun
tain of coal lying around? (Hands down if
you're not in California: that's cheating.)
A lot of universities have power plants on
their campuses. We're lucky — the one that
Stanford hosts and buys power from is a
pretty efficient natural gas-fired, combined
cycle cogeneration facility. Combined cycle
means it uses the gas it burns twice, once in a
gas turbine and once in a steam turbine: co
generation means it produces multiple use
ful products. In this case.electricity and heat.
(And yes. that does mean you can end up
inside the power plant if you explore the
steam tunnels.They have a lot of alarms and
a guard waiting to tell you to go away. Ap
parently the guard sometimes laughs at you
if you're surprised that the steam pipes are
hot when they burn you.)
Quite a few schools with on-campus
power plants have coal-fired ones, actually
even the ones with really good environ
mental programs, like Duke. This also
means they have train tracks running right
up to the power plants to bring carloads of
coal to be burned to power and heat the
school.This is not a failure of environmental
sentiment; it's a fact of location and avail
able resources.
('alifornians have it really, really good on
the climate street cred front. We like to talk
about how our annual per capita CO2 emis
sions are half of U.S. levels and a shocking
one-third of Texan levels. And I give the
state credit: we have made serious efforts to
improve efficiency since the l l )70s. We have
a strong environmentalist culture. Califor
nia's system is good because it was built that
way: what we can often lose sight of is that
it's built well because it has to be.
California has no coal.
This tiny fact has had massive impacts on
the development of our electricity system.
Coal generation is still and has traditionally
been cheaper than natural gas generation,
hut California couldn't use coal. That made
our electricity expensive as we burned oil
and natural gas.Then the'7os happened. Oil
got expensive, and we stopped burning oil

for electricity (that's pretty much universal
ly true in the United States).
Left with natural gas and expensive im
ports (imports are why Los Angeles is hall
coal-fueled even though California has no
coal), we pressed on. realizing that we could
not keep wasting energy or we'd bankrupt
ourselves. Enter strict efficiency legislation,
and voila — the average California!! is
using about the same amount of energ\ now
as 40 years ago while the rest of the countr\
has been steadily increasing per capita con
sumption.
Japan is doing even better at energy effi
ciency than California. California has no
coal: Japan has no anything. This is a com -
mon trend: those with very little are forced
to use it well. Which brings us to this painful
point:
The U.S. has a lot of coal.
So do a lot of other countries.
Basically, what good climate policy says
is that we need to convince people without a
resource shortage to act like there is one.
Why? Because of bad side effects that are
cumulative but show up about 40 years after
gases are emitted.
Here's a cake metaphor: Imagine you
love cake.To businesspeople. the idea of re
stricting access to cheap energy sounds like

someone handed you a huge cake and told
you that you can't eat it because unspeak
ably horrific things will probably happen if
you do. On the other hand, that'll be in 40
years, and the moderately horrific things
that will happen during your lifetime are
due to whatever someone did 40 years ago .
. . so why not eat the cake?
In short, this is a Cake Wreck.

What seems to be missing from the envi
ronmentalist's arsenal right now is a good
precedent, an entity that embraces efficien
cy. renewable power and technology invest
ment when it doesn't have to.California and
Japan are great examples of how things can
work, but we need someone well-endowed
by the coal fairv to step up and follow.
America. I 'm looking at you.
Texas. I 'm looking at you so hard that I'm
moving to you.
I et's go.

Plough the exploding biker sign is prefix clas
sic . Emily'.v favorite sign at Stanford is the one
that savs. "Economic Research/BehavioralSci
ence/C iolft Ourse" over behind Eag. Email her
at gruhertei" stanford.edu to debate the aptness
of that sign.
