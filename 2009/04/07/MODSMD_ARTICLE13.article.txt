# Too Big To Fail
## Rated E for Everyone 
### 
This past weekend, I was visiting my
great aunt, who is ninety-six years
young and more lucid than I am. After
exchanging the usual pleasantries about the
weather and our respective physical therapy
regimens. Aunt Bernice asked me il I'd written
anything lately.
When I mentioned that I have a humor col
limn, she dclightedlv asked to see it. Only by
switching the conversation back to how expen
sive canned goods have gotten since l ( )2 l .)
another favorite topic was I able to avert
disaster.
I'm sure there are things more agoni/ing
than reading abortion jokes to nice old ladies,
but I can't think of any oil the top of my head.
Still, this disconnect isn't entirely my fault.
It's no secret that a lot ol humor is specific to re
gion. culture and age.and even the best crafted
satire ol Stanford culture would hardly be en
tertaining to the folks down at.say. I S(' ( insert
gratuitous I'S( joke here).
Hut. being the devoted grandniece that I
am. I decided as I left the retirement communi
tv that day to at least attempt to write a column
that could be enjoyable lot multiple genera
tions
llie Inst step. I realized. \%as to figure out
what niv peer group actuallv finds amusing.

Raising this question over lunch. I learned that
my friends are diverted by dogs, farting and that
You l übe video of a turtle trying to impregnate
a shoe, in that order. I am currently accepting
applications for new friends.
From there. I called my mother, who pro
fessed a love for puns and Monty Python. "Is
that it?" I asked, hoping she would mention my
column. "Oh." she added, "Those H*Trade
commercials with the babies are hilarious."
('an t argue there.
The last step of my investigation was recon
necting with my great aunt to ask what she
found funny. Iliis took multiple tries as I
later learned, the first time I called.she was get

was at a building wideWii lennis tournament.
When I finally got heron the line. Aunt Her

cfifferent nationalities are gathered in one place
and accidentally offend each other "Apparent

I louse.
Iluis concludeth my anthropological study
ol humor and age. lor a humor columnist,
you've got to agree that I exerted mysclt con
siderably.
I )isregarding for a second the obvious bias
es within my sample pool. I found aspects of my

findings to be noteworthy.
First of all. I don't think it's a coincidence
that my great aunt and my mother both find
humor in interpersonal interactions, whereas
my friends, both male and female, profess to be
most amused by random visual (or olfactory)
gags. I Inlike previous generations, we early
twenty-somethings get a lot of our laughs from
short viral videos that we watch fifteen times in
a row and then forget about — after all. there's
always something newer and more absurd in
the pipeline.
Recently, a number of publications includ
ing l ime Maga/ine. have published statistics
suggesting that audiences for traditional sit
coms are continually dwindling. 'Ihere are ex
ceptions, ol course "I low I Met Your Moth
er" and "Two and a 1 lalf Men" arc both wildly
popular but in general, it appears to be the
case.
While I'm not arguing that watching prime
time is equivalent to reading Proust, I do think
there's something to be said for comedy that
demands a little investment — of time, atten
tion, intellect or what have you from the au
dience. After all. the best comedy has the power
to bring people together by identifying some
thing unexpected and universal in the human
experience, and. in some cases, challenging you
to think about it
Sure, watching that poor sexually frustrated
turtle is funny, but in a rather limited way. You
squirm, laugh, move on and hopefully never
think about it again.

Granted, there's certainly nothing wrong
with getting your regular fix of You I iibc. I oleat
or fmylife — I certainly do, and besides a se
verely decreased attention span and rapidly de
teriorating spelling and punctuation skills. I've
experienced no negative effects.
But it struck me this being m\ second big
observation that I don't think anyone would
disagree with my Aunt Bernice about the fact
that culture clash is still comedy gold. And who
doesn't love a good pun now and then?
There are infinite sources of corned) out
there in the world, many of which actual!) de
mand something of us. In recent months. Will
Ferrell's impersonation ol George Hush and
Tina ley's She-Who-Will Not Be-Named
demonstrated how humor can actually be polit
ically relevant (indeed, perhaps too much so).
Ultimately. I guess my attempt at writing a
column for both you and my great aunt was a
failure. But that doesn't mean one shouldn't trv

put down this newspaper and go find it
