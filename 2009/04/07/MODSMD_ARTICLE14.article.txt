Once again, junior captain C'arlv
Janiga stepped up. hacking up her
Pacific-10 Conference title with a
39.45 in the all-around to beat Casey
Jo Magee of Arkansas, who scored a

all-around championship. Janiga
also scored a 9.875 on the beam, a
9.85 on floor and a 9.825 on the vault
— solid scores for the Arizona na
tive.
"The regional competition is by
far the most pressure-filled compe
tition of the year. Since only two
teams go on. it all comes down to
who can hit," Janiga said. "We were
close to counting a fall on three
events, but we managed to stay on
the equipment and qualify. It defi
nitely wasn't our best work."
"I think that we are in a great po
sition for nationals," Janiga added.

"In these final days of practice,
we will be fine-tuning and going
through tons of pressure situa

championship meets have not done
us justice to the level of preparation
that we have and our capabilities of
doing huge routines."
