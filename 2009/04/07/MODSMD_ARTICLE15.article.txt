# Cardinal squeaks by UCLA on Senior Night
## 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 1 Stanford women's water polo team
had little trouble finding motivation for the April
3 match against UCLA: it was the Cardinal's final
home game of the season, it was Senior Night and
the Cardinal's opponent was a top-five team try
ing to extend its 17-game win streak and perfect
conference record.
Stanford needed every hit of that motivation
to defeat the Bruins 9-8.
The night began with a celebration of Stan
ford's four seniors: kira Hillman, Koree Blyleven,
1 leather West and Lauren Silver.The good times
did not last lone, though, as UCLA scored two

quick goals to take a 2-0 lead into the second pe
riod.
"We expected them to come out with energy
and challenge us. and they did." said head coach
John Tanner.
Almost on cue. the seniors rose to the occasion
to stop the Bruins' momentum. Following a Stan
ford defensive stop. West received an outlet pass
and found Blyleven open inside to tip in the Car
dinal's first goal of the night.
The underclassmen then had their time to
shine. Sophomore goalkeeper Amber Oland
blocked a Bruin shot and then made a cross-pool
pass to freshman Melissa Seidemann. who beat
her defender and made her open shot to tie the
game at two apiece.

4/3 vs. UCLA W 9-8

UP NEXT CAL (28-5,3-3MPSF)
4/1 1 Berkeley
7 p.m.

GAME NOUS: No. 1 Stanford extended its winning streak to
18 games by beating No. 3 UCLA on Senior Night. Stan
ford scored six of its nine goals in the second half in the
win. The Cardinal looks to continue its undefeated run
through conference play and avoid losing for just the sec
ond time all season when it plays Cal on Saturday.

The teams traded goals.sending the game into
halftime knotted at 3-3.
"We withstood their initial surge and then cre
ated more opportunities," Tanner said. "We were
more patient on offense and were able to get high
er quality scoring chances."
UCI.A was the first to get on the board follow
ing the break, though, scoring on a power play just
after the six-minute mark. Stanford immediately
countered on its own power play when junior Jes
sica Steffens scored to tie the match at 4-4.
Once again UCLA took the lead, yet once
again Stanford tied the score on a power play.
I lillman lobbed the ball inside to Seidemann. who
batted the ball into the net without ever securing
it. looking more like a volleyball player than a
water polo player.
With I minute, 11 seconds left to play in the
third period, the Cardinal grabbed its first lead of
the game on a score from Silver following a pass
byjunior Kelly Eaton.The lead would not last for
long.though.as IJCLA immediately countered to
tie the game at 6-6.
Stanford regained the lead in the dwindling
seconds of the third period on a goal by sopho
more Kim Krueger.and tacked on another one at
the start of the fourth on a Silver penalty shot.
I Jp by two goals with less than seven minutes
left, the Cardinal defense clamped down.denying
UCLA any scoring opportunities or legitimate
threats.
At the 1:20 mark, however, the Bruins strug
gled to get the ball down low and had to settle for
a deep outside shot that snuck by the outstretched
arms of ()land for a goal.
With the game suddenly close again and the
drama of Senior Night heightening the pressure.
Stanford turned to the seniors.
As the clocked ticked away into the final
minute of the game, I lillman found the back of
the net on a mid-range shot. The goal ended up
being the difference in the game,as U( I.A scored
once more to close within one.
"The seniors are all such good verbal leaders,
but they back it up too,"'Tanner noted."They play
with energy and are willing to do anything to win."
The season does not get any easier for Stan
ford. as the Cardinal faces No. 7 Cal on April 11
and No. 2 I JSC" on April 18.
Stanford has split two games against the Tro
jans this year, with both going into overtime.
While the games may not be as conducive to
motivation as the UCLA game, with a perfect
MI'Sl- record on the line and two hated rivals in
the pool.Stanford should not have too much trou
ble finding a little added inspiration.
The Cal match begins at 7 p.m. this Saturday in
Berkeley.
