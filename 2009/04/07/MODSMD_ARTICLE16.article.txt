### JEFF LU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Stanford men's volleyball team
concluded its final road tripof the season
this weekend by securing two hard
fought victories over No. 7 Long Beach
State and No. 10 UC-San Diego, further
extending its winning streak to five
games. Since mid-February, when the
Cardinal found itself struggling to main
tain a .500 win-loss record, Stanford has
won 11 of 12 matches and proven itself
stubbornly committed to maintaining
the momentum of its late-season surge.
On Friday night,No.s Stanford (19-8,
12-6 MI'Sl ) visited Long Beach State
and, in a grueling five-set match, engi
neered a dramatic comeback to edge the
49ers 28-30.30-18.30-26,26-30,20-18. Ju
nior opposite Fvan Romero guided the
Cardinal through two precarious mo
ments in the final set. knocking in three
kills to close an 11-7 deficit and staving
off a match point with another kill to
help Stanford rally from behind.
"They really pushed us to the limit,"
said head coach John Kosty. "Hut the re
sult is a testament to our players. They
know how to win."
Three Cardinal players reached dou
ble digits in kills with Romero leading
the pack with 20. Outside hitters fresh
man Brad Lawson and sophomore
Spencer McLachlin chipped in with l l >
and II of their own. respectively. Junior
middle blocker Garrett Werner hit .533
to contribute an additional nine kills of
his own.
Stanford's offensive effort, however,
was met point for point by -Wers' junior
opposite hitter Dean Bittner.who had 36
kills and hit .375, and sophomore setter
Mike Klipsch. who had 71 assists. The
Cardinal defensive wall appeared to be
the key factor for determining Stanford's
victory, as the Cardinal front row put up
15 team blocks to Long Beach's 3.5.
Defensively, Stanford also managed
50 digs, including 22 by freshman libero
Rrik Shoji, who leads the nation in the
statistic. Friday's match puts Shoji's total
digs for the season up to 362. placing him
within range of the Stanford single
season digs record of 379 previously
set by three-time Olympian Scott
Fortune in 1986.
"(This is a] great for end-of-the
season thing." Kosty said. "But for
us. it's most important to play our
volleyball and not be chasing
records."
On Saturday, the Cardinal
wrapped up its southern California
road trip with a 30-26,21-30.30-26,
30-25 victory over UC-San Diego,
extending the Stanford winning
streak against MPSF conference
opponents to eight. Romero once
again led the way with 21 kills, and
Lawson and senior middle blocker
Brandon Williams knocked in 15
and 11 kills, respectively. Junior set

ter Kawika Shoji had 57 assists, his
third 50-plus game in the past four
matches.
The Cardinal players also man
aged 9.5 team blocks to the Triton's
7.5. including four individual blocks
by Williams and three by Romero.
"We're on a good roll right now."
Kosty said. "We're really confident,
and that's exactly where we need to
be heading into the playoffs."
I"he Stanford men's volleyball
team will be moving into the final leg
of its season, with all four of its re
maining matches being played at
Maples Pavilion over the next two
weeks. This week, the Cardinal will
