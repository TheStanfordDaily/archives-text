# Beware of Orlando's Magic touch
## 
### 
Growing up in Florida in a
family devoid of any hint
of fandom, I was left to
discover the world of
sports on mv own. As a six-year-old.
I naturally chose to passionately
follow a team with a name synony
mous with birthday parties and a
mascot resembling a greener ver
sion of Barney.
Ladies and gentlemen, it is now
time for me to publicly make the
case for the Orlando Magic. Ameri
ca's newest version of The Beatles.
Hie other day I was approached
by a Pro Fro, a fellow sports maniac,
who. in obnoxiously bragging about
the Boston Celtics, asked me about
my NBA inclination. I proudly stilt
ed that 1 was a "huge Magic fan."
1 lis response?
"I didn't know they existed."
Normally, this would rev my en
gines more than when a Taco Bell
drive-thru employee forgets to put
ranchero sauce on my soft taco.
However. I no longer feel the need
to defend the best team in the Asso
ciation.
This year. Orlando is closing in
on its best season since the Shaq
era. It currently boasts a record of
57-19, only one win back of the
Celtics for the second spot in the
Eastern Conference. With the in
jury to defensive leader Kevin (iar
nett, it is a safe bet to say that
Boston will slide to the third seed,
leaving the Magic with the sexy
prospect of home-court advantage
in the second round of the playoffs.
Sure. I loward and Co. still get re
peatedly manhandled by a Detroit
Pistons team that has more psycho
logical control over the Magic than
the Spice Girls had over teenage
girls. But what about the elite teams
repping the mighty Western Con
ference?
This year, Orlando swept the
Lakers and the Spurs, effortlessly
strolling into two of the most hostile
arenas in the league and defeating
two of the NBA's favorite children
in Kobe Bryant and Tim Duncan.
Not enough?
This weekend, the boys in blue
hosted the Cleveland Lebrons, a
game predicted by many analysts to
have Eastern Conference finals im
plications. The last meeting be
tween the two resulted in a narrow
comeback by Cleveland, fueled b\
visibly horrendous officiating
(watch video of the March 17 game
for proof), and a 42-point outburst
by Lebron.
How did Orlando respond? Bv
emphatically smacking Cleveland
by 29 points, easily serving the Cavs
and their bandwagon fans their
worst loss of the year The Magic led
by 41 at one point. Rumor has it the
Clippers were laughing.
The Magic currently ranks first
in the league in defensive efficiency,
made three-point field goals per
game and defensive rebounding, as
well as third in opposing teams'
field goal percentage and sixth in
team blocks.
This team has one of the most
balanced attacks in the NBA. led by
superhuman center Dwight
Howard, whose post dominance is
almost as impressive as his bowling
ball-sized shoulders. Howard's job
is made easy, as double and triple
teams simply lead to three-point
barrages from any one of the
Magic's six perimeter threats.
To top if off. the team has done
all of this without All-Star point
guard Jameer Nelson, who was lost
this season due to injury.
Last but absolutely not least is
head coach Stan Van Ciundy. AI
though he looks like the progeny ol
Papa Smurf and Rosie O'Donnell.
he is unquestionably a proven
leader. Many of you have heard his
prepubescent screams on ESPN
when the Magic was up 25,and have
questioned his mental acuity.
But the numbers speak for them
selves. I le has improved the Magic's
win total in each of his seasons at
the helm. Stan has his team per
forming at a level comparable to
the NBA Finals team of the mid
19905.
The bottom line is that this is not
a team to sleep on. The Magic con
tinuously flies under the radar, lail
