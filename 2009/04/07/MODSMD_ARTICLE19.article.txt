## Med. school discloses research affiliations Policy change offers greater transparency on financial relationships 
### FATIMA WAGDY 
In a move to increase overall transparency,
the School of Medicine announced this past
week that medical and research-related affilia
tions of physicians and faculty will be made
available to the public.
The policy will mandate that faculty or
Stanford physicians release information about
consulting in which they were given an hono
rarium or payment greater than $5,000 on an
annual basis. Any instance where a physician or
faculty member has an opportunity for royal
ties, holds stock or holds a board of directors
role will also be disclosed.
Medical School Dean Philipp Pizzo
explained the move in the March edition of his
Dean's Newsletter.
"Transparency is a key feature of ensuring
the trust of our community — including our
students, fellow colleagues and all whom we
serve," Pizzo said.
The idea for the move came from similar
proposals being made at other institutions
across the country.
"A fair number of state governments, the

federal government and a large number of
pharmaceutical companies are all moving
ahead with plans to put out their own disclo
sure notification," said Dr. Harold Greenberg,
senior associate dean for research at the School
of Medicine.
Stanford's decision follows a similar deci
sion made by The Cleveland Clinic, which in
December became the first clinic to make these
relationships public.
Greenberg told The Daily that the idea had
taken some time to become a reality.
"It's like anything else — we got around to
it." Greenberg said. "The School of Medicine
and the University have been updating a vari
ety of policies around their interactions with
industry.
"This is just part of that effort to continuous
ly improve our policies and guidelines," he
added.
Greenberg noted that there has been little
resistance to the transition. While there was lit
tle faculty response to the issue one way or the
other, the responses received were positive.
"We did discuss it at the Executive
Committee of the School of Medicine,"
Greenberg said. "In that discussion, there was
generally a lot of positive support."
The policy also allows for consistency, as
some Stanford physicians wanted to let their
patients know about their specific affiliations

on their own, increasing the desirability of a
universal policy.
The information will he available through
the individual profiles of physicians and faculty
on the Community Academic Profile (CAP)
Web-based system, near a list of their recent
publications. Creenberg explained the system
with reference to his own page.
"It is part of your profile," he said. "If I con
sulted for a drug company about medication,
that would be up there. We purposely have cho
sen to display the info as a part of each person's
profile."
"You'll see the companies I consult for,"
Greenberg added, it's really a profile of who 1
am in my academic life. I think all of that would
be important to the public."
Pizzo explained in his Dean's Newsletter
that the change brings the medical school in
line with the high ethical standards for which it
strives.
"The information we will be posting is com
parable to what faculty would disclose for an
educational program or for a journal publica
tion." Pizzo said. "It is appropriate to make it
publicly available and accessible."
"In my opinion, this is the right thing to do
— a position that is shared by our school lead
ership." he added.
