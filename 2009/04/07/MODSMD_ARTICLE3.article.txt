### THOMAS YEH STAFF WRITER 
CNN political commentator and
former A 1 Gore campaign manager
Donna Brazile spoke about the his
toric presidency of Barack Obama
and its implications for communities
of color Monday evening.
Students, faculty and members of
the general public alike filled Kresge
Auditorium to see Brazile in an
event entitled "100 Days... 100
Years: Obama's Report Card and
Black America." The event coincid
ed with the NAACP's I OOtli year,
and Brazile sought to establish the
importance of his status as the first
black president and assess his
achievements.
Currently age 49. Brazile has
served the Democratic Party on
every presidential campaign from
1976 to 2000. She has also consulted
for a number of gubernatorial and
local races. Brazile's political career
started in Louisiana at age nine
when a local candidate in her home
town promised to build a playground
in her neighborhood.
Equipped with a lengthy catalog
of accomplishments and an arsenal
of humorous stories, Brazile spoke
extensively about her past, change
and issues that still need to be
resolved. I ler bubbling enthusiasm
for the Obama administration was
met with nods, cheers and applause
from the audience as she described
the impact of his taking office.
"I must tell you that I never
thought I would see this day as a
young girl," Brazile said. "1 grew up
on the other side of the train tracks.
In fact, there were two sets of train
tracks when I was growing up. There
was a side that divided blacks from
whites, and then (the one dividing]
the poor blacks from those in the
middle class. We didn't know any
rich black people."
"That was before the lluxtables."
she added, referencing "The Cosby
Show."
As an author, strategist, political
advocate, pundit and commentator.
Brazile now attributes her success to
all those who preceded her in the
civil rights movement.
"I've been in politics for 40
years," Bra/ile said. "Forty years of
nonstop political activism ... It is
because of their sacrifice that I stand
here as the living embodiment of
what the movement created. And it
wasn't just a civil rights movement
for blacks... it was a human rights
movement for all people."
Brazile praised President Obama
extensively.
"It feels good to have a president,
who. when he speaks, he articulates
our values, and can do so in a way
that you understand what he's say
ing," Brazile said.
"A president who's going to
restore the rule of law?" she asked.
"To close Guantanamo Bay? A pres
ident who says that we're not going
to torture? ... I'm in love."
The event moderator sought to
touch on a range of topics related to
race, America and the new
President. University of San
Francisco Politics Professor James

Lance Taylor steered the conversa
tion loosely, touching briefly on
Brazile's role as a super-delegate, on
the importance of the upcoming
2010 midterm elections, and on the
recent controversial article in The
Washington Post that claimed some
African Americans were potentially
being overly critical of the President.
Throughout the conversation,
Brazile continually stressed the
important and constructive roles
that constituents must now play in
influencing President Obama.
"lie actually listens, and I think
he will benefit from our criticism,"
Brazile said. "You've got a president
now who's putting in money for jobs,
for education, for healthcare. So the
whining and complaining days are
all over."
Brazile affirmed that President
Obama has played his part and is
fulfilling his promise for change, but
she insists that there is still a lot of
work to be done.
"We're not there yet." Brazile
said. "People keep saying we're
post-racial. We're not there yet.
We're going there. But we're not
there yet. We are heading in that
direction because we see the

Promised Land. But this time, we
don't just see it — we also know how
we can get there. And we cannot get
there as black people or white peo
ple or all our different categories,
our little boxes."
"That's what President Obama
represents: the breaking down of all
these boxes that we put ourselves
in." she added. "We don't need them
anymore. What we need is the abili
ty to see how we get to that
Promised Land ... We're all archi
tects in this ... "
Brazile added a light-hearted
closing note to her serious senti
ment.
"And everyone will have good
real estate." Brazile said. "No more
foreclosures in the Promised Land."
The event was held on Day 86 of
President Obama's administration
(two weeks shy of the 100-day mark)
and was also part of "We Are 100."
an ongoing centennial celebration
for the NAACP. Founded in 1909,
the NAACP is now the oldest and
largest civil rights organization in
the nation.
