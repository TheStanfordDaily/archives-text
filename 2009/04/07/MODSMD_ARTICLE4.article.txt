# GSB AIMS TO WIN BACK PUBLIC TRUST
## Administration building on 2007 curriculum overhaul; courses focus on ethics 
### JOANNA XU MANAGING EDITOR 
With the economy in shambles, there is plen
ty of blame to go around surrounding the ori
gins of the financial crisis. Under intense scruti
ny. top executives have been some of the
biggest targets — as well as the business
schools that trained them.
Top business schools around the nation,
including the Stanford Graduate School of
Business (GSB), are facing questions about
whether their curricula adequately emphasized
topics such as risk management and ethics.
In response to these questions, GSB Dean
Robert Joss recently wrote a column titled

"Restoring Trust" to be published in the
upcoming summer issue of the Stanford
Business School Alumni Magazine, addressing
these issues, defending Stanford's curriculum
and defining the necessary roles of future busi
ness educators and leaders.
In an interview with The Daily. Joss empha
sized his faith in Stanford's current practices.
"The basics of the curriculum won't
change." Joss said. "Professors are re-emphasiz
ing the importance of the basics, the body of
knowledge that we know to be very useful. But.
they're also bringing in new material to analyze
what's happening in the marketplace and to
relate how the knowledge base applies to real
world problems."

Stanford recently underwent a major cur
riculum overhaul in 2007. ITie changes pro
duced a large number of new courses aimed to
allow tailor-made academic experiences and
emphasize critical thinking about leadership.
"What does it mean to be a leader? It's not
about fame, money or power." Joss said. "It's
about responsibility — what it means to own
that responsibility, to feel it and exercise it.
That's why we do a lot of leadership labs and
experimental opportunities."
"it's not enough to just talk about it,"he
added. "We get into how to build relationships
of trust with other people."
Joss did note, however, that there would
probably be new courses added to the curricu

lum.
"We have a lot of turnover in electives; half
of them are new every five years." he said.
"Faculty are always coming up with new ideas."
New courses may aim to expand on the
University's current offerings, which attempt to
address many concerns relating to business
education. One of the core first-year GSB
courses, called "Ethics in Management." has
recently been revamped to draw upon business
cases and recent studies in cognitive psycholo
gy. economics and "experimental ethics."
The course now begins with a discussion of
"greed — individual self-interest — and when
it may lead to good and had social
outcomes," wrote GSB Professor
Saumitra Jha. one of the course's
teachers, in an email to The Daily.
"We motivate the class hy discussing
the strong incentives of financial in
stitutions to lend during the suhprime
mortgage crisis.
"The next section of the class ex
amined the different psychological
biases that lead to moral outrage on
the part of others, such as AIG Hon us
es." Jha continued."A major theme of
the course is learning to anticipate
psychological flaws in both our own
and others' reasoning, and develop
strategies to counteract them."
Business ethics is not a theme ex
clusive to the first year of business
school. A task force recently intro
duced a new course titled "Synthesis
Seminar" that will be offered in the
spring to all GSB students in their
final year.
Professor Meehan, one of the
three professors spearheading the
course, said that the course is meant
to help students in their final year dis
cern their own aspirations, synthesize
what they've learned and highlight
"the timeless lessons of general man
agement."
"The mission of the business
school is 'Change Lives. Change Or
ganizations. Change the World,"'
Meehan said. "That speaks to a
school that is not focused on narrow
questions of maximizing business
performance in the short term, but is
in fact to help business and social sec
tor organization — and to shape soci
ety for the better."
GSB students, too. feel that their
school in particular emphasizes social
impact. Benjamin Kornell, a graduate
student at both the GSB and the
School of Education, said that Stan
ford teaches social responsible lead
ership through three venues: business
cases on social responsibility, ethics
courses and clubs and social activities.
"The (3SB has a program called
'Public Management Program.' of
which 10 clubs are a part." Kornell
said. "Roughly 70 percent of students
are involved, and those students at
tend meetings, conferences on health

care, volunteer, etc."
Elizabeth Ivester. a first-year stu
dent at the GSB. agreed and said that
in the past few years. Stanford has put
a lot of effort into focusing on non
market issues such as social responsi
bility.
"I think a lot of GSB students as
pired to be CEOs of Fortune S(H)
companies or to start their own com
panies— but to do it a socially re
sponsible way." Ivester said. "But
there are also a large number of stu
dents who want to do entrepreneurial
work focused on clean tech or who as
pire to work in the nonprofit sector."
Despite the media criticism and
scrutiny. Joss remains confident that
the brand of Stanford GSB remains
unscathed.
"There's been a lot of negative sto
ries about how this is a crisis that was
caused by MBA trained people, but
there are lots of people who bear re
sponsibility for the current crisis,"
Joss added. "Journalists, lawyers,
technical folk. This was a real failure
of professionals in many respects.
One thing is certain: We need better
leadership. That is what a school like
ours is all about."
"It's never been more important
to learn the things that we teach
here," Joss added.
