# GSB AIMS TO WIN BACK PUBLIC TRUST
## Administration building on 2007 curriculum overhaul; courses focus on ethics 
### JOANNA XU MANAGING EDITOR 
With the economy in shambles, there is plen
ty of blame to go around surrounding the ori
gins of the financial crisis. Under intense scruti
ny. top executives have been some of the
biggest targets — as well as the business
schools that trained them.
Top business schools around the nation,
including the Stanford Graduate School of
Business (GSB), are facing questions about
whether their curricula adequately emphasized
topics such as risk management and ethics.
In response to these questions, GSB Dean
Robert Joss recently wrote a column titled

"Restoring Trust" to be published in the
upcoming summer issue of the Stanford
Business School Alumni Magazine, addressing
these issues, defending Stanford's curriculum
and defining the necessary roles of future busi
ness educators and leaders.
In an interview with The Daily. Joss empha
sized his faith in Stanford's current practices.
"The basics of the curriculum won't
change." Joss said. "Professors are re-emphasiz
ing the importance of the basics, the body of
knowledge that we know to be very useful. But.
they're also bringing in new material to analyze
what's happening in the marketplace and to
relate how the knowledge base applies to real
world problems."

Stanford recently underwent a major cur
riculum overhaul in 2007. ITie changes pro
duced a large number of new courses aimed to
allow tailor-made academic experiences and
emphasize critical thinking about leadership.
"What does it mean to be a leader? It's not
about fame, money or power." Joss said. "It's
about responsibility — what it means to own
that responsibility, to feel it and exercise it.
That's why we do a lot of leadership labs and
experimental opportunities."
"it's not enough to just talk about it,"he
added. "We get into how to build relationships
of trust with other people."
Joss did note, however, that there would
probably be new courses added to the curricu

lum.
"We have a lot of turnover in electives; half
of them are new every five years." he said.
"Faculty are always coming up with new ideas."
New courses may aim to expand on the
University's current offerings, which attempt to
address many concerns relating to business
education. One of the core first-year GSB
courses, called "Ethics in Management." has
recently been revamped to draw upon business
cases and recent studies in cognitive psycholo
gy. economics and "experimental ethics."
The course now begins with a discussion of
"greed — individual self-interest — and when
