# STUDENT GOV'T
## Hauser/Sprague push experience 
### MARISA LANDICHO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Steadily rattling off an extensive list
of platform points in an interview with
The Daily, Executive candidates
Bennett Hauser '10 and Matt Sprague
'10 were unrecognizable from their
humorous turn as cutlass-wielding
"pirates" in their much-circulated cam
paign video. Far-removed from their cin
ematic video spoof, which features the
two as costumed heroes rescuing a
Stanford Tree in distress, the slate styles
themselves as serious financial experts
in trying times.
Throughout the campaign, Hauser

and Sprague have consistently stressed
their financial leadership experience.
Among their strengths, they explained,
is an established network of administra
tive relationships from their previous
roles on campus.
For the past two years, Hauser has
managed the Stanford Student Store in
Tresidder, from which he has derived his
knowledge of management.
Likewise. Sprague has served as the
Director of ASSU Capital Group, over
seeing the funding and banking of the
multi-million-dollar ASSU endowment.
"The University is a business,"
Hauser said, establishing a campaign
message that plays to both his slate's job

history and a University undergoing
budget cuts in a poor economic climate.
As appointed members of the
Dorsey/Harris administration. Hauser
and Sprague have overwhelmingly
praised the sitting Executives and have
publicized a similar platform.
More important, the slate said, is
their pool of established contacts from
their prior ASSU work.
"We are already respected among
administration for our work." said

ASSU Executive candidates Bennett Hauser '10 and Matt Sprague '10 have strong ties with the current Executives, and they
emphasized that they would build off their administrative experience if they took over the office.
banked the success of their plat
form upon the strong relationships
already fostered with faculty and
administration, particularly in the
realm of budget affairs.
However, the slate wanted to
make clear how their financial
knowledge would be put to use if
they are elected.
"We're not making the stock
picks for the Stanford endowments,"
Sprague said. "That's not the sort of
financial leadership that we'll be
bringing to the University."
Nevertheless, in campaign ads
and other materials, their skill with
money has figured prominently as
they hope to add a new perspective
to the ways in which student affairs
are handled.
The difficulty for the slate, then,
comes not from their record, but dif
ficulties in reaching the large and
varied graduate student body.
Their main competition for
Executive has taken the form of
returning challenger David Gobaud
'08 and his running-mate Jay de la
Torre '10. As a graduate student liv
ing in Munger. Gobaud. who also
holds experience within the
Dorsey/Harris administration, has
emerged as the champion of gradu
ate affairs.
While the position of ASSU
Executive is intended to represent

both undergraduates and graduate
students, many grads have expressed
disenfranchisement with the percep
tion of an undergrad emphasis.
Hauser and Sprague have called
for a culture shift in the grad popula
tion. already continuing the out
reach begun by Dorsey and Harris.
The two candidates have spoken
with key members of the Graduate
Student Council (GSC) and met
numerous graduate students over
brunch.
Although Sprague is also current
ly a co-terminal student, he said that
sitting next to graduate students in
class made him an expert on gradu
ate affairs. He currently lives in
Toyon. where he is a resident assis
tant. and does not live in graduate
housing.
"Graduate students want to feel
like they are represented." Hauser
said.
Looking to reform other aspects
of the ASSU. Hauser and Sprague
have proposed steps to create insti
tutional memory and invigorate
student government. These less
publicized planks are "less sexy"
than their initiatives in sustainabili
ty and sexual health, said the candi
dates. but important nonetheless.
"A problem with the ASSU has
been the idea that 'we will get (the
administration] to do stuff for us.'"
Hauser said. "The attitude we want
to have is that we will do the work
for (the administration), and just
[have them] implement it for us."
Delivering high praise for the
multi-year campaigns undertaken

by the GSC. the two candidates
pledge further cooperation
between outgoing and incoming
governments.
"In the past, the training
between the Executives has been
so. so bad." Sprague said. "It's sad to
have a whole year's work lost just
because there has been no training
between Executives."
On the other side of their plat
form. Hauser and Sprague have
chartered a course tackling sustain
ability. diversity, public service, stu
dent health and student life.
Merging sustainability with his
previous job experience. Hauser
planned to expand green initiatives
by partnering the ASSU Green
Store, started this year by selling
biodegradable cups, with the
Stanford Student Store. Moreover,
the slate supports the efforts of
Students for a Sustainable Stanford
in seeking a University-written
pledge to reduce carbon emissions.
The two acknowledged the
broadness of "diversity" as a pillar,
but have suggested the concrete
reforms of changing the ASSU
Cabinet Diversity Chair from an
appointed to an elected position
and setting up an ASSU diversity
task force.
Recognizing the difficulties
faced by student party-planners in
abiding by "cumbersome" and
"unnecessary" requirements,
Hauser and Sprague hope to intro
duce the idea of a level 2.5 party on
the Office of Student Affairs
(OSA) scale.

"We don't think there is a one
size-fits-all approach." Sprague said
about planned parties. "We look
forward to working with the OSA
to give students a little more flexi
bility."
ITie slate has also continued the
perennially revived campaign goal
of making Old Union and a campus
eatery open 24 hours a day.
Given the extensive nature of
their platform. Hauser and Sprague
remain confident of not only
achieving their platform initiatives,
but doing so in the face of rough
economic times.
"I believe the ASSIJ needs two
strong leaders, and I think me and
Ben are the best people to take that
on," Sprague said.
