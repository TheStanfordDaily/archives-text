## Former gov. calls for education reform 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
Hob Wise, president of the Alliance for
Excellent Education and former governor of
West Virginia, said that fixing America's edu
cation system is key to solving other national
problems in a speech last night.
In front of a crowd of Stanford students
and alumni packing Cubberley Auditorium,
Wise emphasized the gravity of this educa
tional crisis and laid out his plan to revitalize
the quality of American high schools. He Ire-

quentlv alluded to his new book on the topic,
"Raising the Grade: How High School
Reform Can Save Our Youth and Nation."
As representative examples. Wise stated
that our nation's public high schools fail to
graduate 1.2 million students every year, that
70 percent of eighth graders are reading one
grade below their level and that 30 percent
are reading two or more grades below their
level.
In his opinion, the Bush administration's
No Child I .eft Behind Act is not sufficiently
well-designed to address these shortcomings.

for two principal reasons: First, the act focus
es primarily on the early grades and does not
allocate enough money to high school reform.
Second, it involves what Wise called a "one
si/e-fits-all" approach to reform, failing to tai
lor the classroom experience to the needs of
the individual students.
As a response to these shortcomings. Wise
laid out a reform plan that included school
environments more specifically tailored to
the needs and abilities of the students. Me
proposed that by the eighth grade,
every student should have a personal
graduation plan laid out to maximize
his or her opportunities. He also
urged an increase in federal govern
ment spending on high school educa
tion reforms.
Wise repeatedly suggested a
causal relationship between these
educational failings and other crises
our nation currently faces, including
the economic downturn and health
care.
"Reforming high school educa
tion lies at the root of many of our
country's most pressing issues today,"
Wise said. "We need transformed

high schools to boost the economy, to
ensure national security, to ensure
social stability."
Stressing the relationship between
educational standards and the econo
my. he continued, "We have heard a
lot about non-performing, tftxic
assets recently. Hut perhaps the
largest non-performing asset of nil in
America is drop-outs. These people
could be contributing billions of dol
lars to our economy if they were
properly educated."
Another focus of Wise's reform
plan was the institution of detailed
common standards across states and
of federal benchmarks.
"Just as there is no question of
whether medication manufactured in
Michigan will be higher or lower
quality than medication manufac
tured in Massachusetts, algebra in
Idaho should be the same as algebra

in Brooklyn," Wise explained.
Wise applauded Obama's newly
passed federal stimulus bill, which is
the first stimulus bill in the nation's
history to dedicate a larger percent of
money to education reforms than to
developing national infrastructure.
However, he stressed that more sys
temic changes are still necessary.
"There is a crisis in our country."
Wise said. "We basically know what
to do about it. We just have to build
the public will."
Wise served as governor of West
Virginia from 2(X)I to 2(H)5. The
Alliance for Excellent Education, the
organization he currently heads, is a
Washington-based nonprofit organi
zation devoted to secondary educa
tion policy.
