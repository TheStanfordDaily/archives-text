New York Times Executive Editor Bill Keller
bemoaned the effects of shrinking budgets on quali
ty journalism in an interview with The Daily, and said
that everything is on the table in the search for a
business transformation at The Times and other
newspapers around the world.
The Gray Ladv has fallen victim to the same pres
sures that are plaguing the newspaper industry as a
whole — the paper, which is facing heavy debt, has
accepted a $250 million loan from Mexican mogul
Carlos Slim Helu. and just last month laid off 100
employees and cut all salaries by five percent.
In an hour-long interview with The Daily at its
new building. Keller spoke at length about how
much economic pressures have affected The Times.
A newspaperman through and through. Keller is
now forced to spend the majority of his time working
on his paper's business model, instead of directing
news coverage. Whereas interaction with the paper's
business side was once limited, Keller said that he is
now constantly searching for ways to cut costs and
add revenue, as advertising income continues to
shrink unpredictably.
"When 1 was managing editor, we had a budget
once a year, and there was a fair amount of contact
with the business of the paper during that time, justi
fying our budget and preventing cuts that we thought
might do damage, but that was in a more expansive
time." he said. "Now we've reached the time where it
feels like we have a budget of the month."
But Keller still makes time every day to attend
the 10:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. news meetings, and spends
a fair bit of time in between working on journalism.
'i get enough of that, so I don't feel like I've
moved into a monastery or something." he said.
Though he readily admitted that he. like most life
long reporters, isn't an expert at solving the indus
try's business problems, Keller said that journalists at
the nation's top papers are getting deeply involved in
the search for a new business model.
Keller looked favorably upon one foreign corre
spondent's suggestion that the paper be used as an
English learning tool in the developing world.
Both because of the efforts underway to find solu
tions to the newspaper industry's problems, and his
views on the importance of newspapers. Keller is
guardedly optimistic about his industry's future.
"My optimism is framed as the law of supply and
demand; there is a limited and decreasing supply of
really good, in-depth journalism, and there is a con
tinuing demand for it."he said, adding. "That is the
context, but that in itself is not a solution."
According to Keller, the papers that are most at
risk —metropolitan dailies like the now defunct
Seattle P.I. and Rocky Mountain News — have made
some poor decisions that have softened demand for
their products, and are not simply victims of the
Internet age.
These papers, which Keller said have traditionally
counted on the now almost-dead classified advertis
ing market for 40 percent of revenues, have cut hard
news coverage almost across the board, which has
then worsened their financial situations.
"I'm sure there are editors around who lament
the fact that thev decided to move towards the
