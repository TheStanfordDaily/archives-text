New York Times Executive Editor Bill Keller
bemoaned the effects of shrinking budgets on quali
ty journalism in an interview with The Daily, and said
that everything is on the table in the search for a
business transformation at The Times and other
newspapers around the world.
The Gray Ladv has fallen victim to the same pres
sures that are plaguing the newspaper industry as a
whole — the paper, which is facing heavy debt, has
accepted a $250 million loan from Mexican mogul
Carlos Slim Helu. and just last month laid off 100
employees and cut all salaries by five percent.
In an hour-long interview with The Daily at its
new building. Keller spoke at length about how
much economic pressures have affected The Times.
A newspaperman through and through. Keller is
now forced to spend the majority of his time working
on his paper's business model, instead of directing
news coverage. Whereas interaction with the paper's
business side was once limited, Keller said that he is
now constantly searching for ways to cut costs and
add revenue, as advertising income continues to
shrink unpredictably.
"When 1 was managing editor, we had a budget
once a year, and there was a fair amount of contact
with the business of the paper during that time, justi
fying our budget and preventing cuts that we thought
might do damage, but that was in a more expansive
time." he said. "Now we've reached the time where it
feels like we have a budget of the month."
But Keller still makes time every day to attend
the 10:30 a.m. and 4 p.m. news meetings, and spends
a fair bit of time in between working on journalism.
'i get enough of that, so I don't feel like I've
moved into a monastery or something." he said.
Though he readily admitted that he. like most life
long reporters, isn't an expert at solving the indus
try's business problems, Keller said that journalists at
the nation's top papers are getting deeply involved in
the search for a new business model.
Keller looked favorably upon one foreign corre
spondent's suggestion that the paper be used as an
English learning tool in the developing world.
Both because of the efforts underway to find solu
tions to the newspaper industry's problems, and his
views on the importance of newspapers. Keller is
guardedly optimistic about his industry's future.
"My optimism is framed as the law of supply and
demand; there is a limited and decreasing supply of
really good, in-depth journalism, and there is a con
tinuing demand for it."he said, adding. "That is the
context, but that in itself is not a solution."
According to Keller, the papers that are most at
risk —metropolitan dailies like the now defunct
Seattle P.I. and Rocky Mountain News — have made
some poor decisions that have softened demand for
their products, and are not simply victims of the
Internet age.
These papers, which Keller said have traditionally
counted on the now almost-dead classified advertis
ing market for 40 percent of revenues, have cut hard
news coverage almost across the board, which has
then worsened their financial situations.
"I'm sure there are editors around who lament
the fact that thev decided to move towards the
recipe-based, do-it-yourself, movie
critic-driven newspapers, instead of
actually covering the city govern
ment. police and schools," Keller
said.
A former foreign correspondent
himself, Keller was most vocal
about the consequences of the
decreased foreign coverage that
comes with shrinking budgets.
Foreign bureaus, and interna
, tional coverage in general, has been
sacrificed as costs are cut. The Los
Angeles limes, for example, no
longer has a Tokyo bureau, a con
spicuous hole for one of the Pacific
Rim's most influential newspapers.
Keller said that he has already
noticed something lacking from
public discourse as a result of cuts in
foreign coverage. He pointed to the
American media's slow coverage of
unrest in Mexico, and lack of
Pakistan coverage. Keller said most,
foreign coverage now revolves
around Iraq and Afghanistan, which
are both mainly covered from
Washington, in addition to coverage
of countries the President may be
visiting.
"There are areas of the world
that don't get the attention they
deserve." he said. The remaining
foreign coverage, Keller said, lacks
texture and sophistication due to
decreased competition amongst
papers.
Iliough he said that everything is
an option as he tries to preserve the
quality of journalism at ITie Times,
Keller approaches each idea with a
healthy dose of skepticism.
Charging for online content has
commonly been cited as an easy
way to generate additional revenue
for newspapers. Keller, however,
voiced a number of qualifying fac
tors that would reduce any gains,
from charging for content — put
ting content behind a pay wall could
decrease advertising revenue, and
also significantly reduce traffic from
search engines like Google.
Other seemingly cost-free plans
also have drawbacks
Keller said he was concerned
with the ethical conflicts posed bv
any sort of government bailout,
such as a tax break or stimulus.

endowment funding, causes prob

there is an
aspect of the
business of the
newspaper that
I find pretty

lems — Keller noted that even char
ity comes with strings attached.
Still. Keller said that if a $5 bil
lion endowment were ever offered
to The Times, he would not have an
immediate answer for the donor.
In the end, Keller said, there sim
ply won't he an easy solution to the
many problems facing the newspa
per industry, as expecting to discov
er a business tactic that will sudden
ly bring back millions of dollars of
lost revenue is unrealistic. Instead,
newspapers will, through a process
of trial and error, slowly grow into a
more sustainable, long-term busi
ness strategy.
"The truth is, there is an aspect of
the business of the newspaper that I
find pretty satisfying," Keller said.
"Nobody has a magic answer ...
but at least at The Times, and I think
at some of the better papers, jour
nalists are getting involved in that
search for a news business model."
