## FARM ACCEPTS FRESH CROP OF ADMITS MEET THE ADMIT CLASS OF 2009-SOON TO BE THE CLASS OF 2013 
### VINEET SINGAL 
It was the most competitive admission year in
Stanford's history. Though 30.428 students applied,
only 2.3(H) were accepted. For some, admittance
into the Farm represents a ticket to a corporate
future: to others, a fulfillment of a long family lega
cy. Hie reasons are diverse: the relief at securing a spot
the same. Members of the incoming Class of 2013 guided
The Daily through their admission process and discussed
just what their acceptance to the third-most competitive
university in the country means to them.
Thomas Colby Isabel, a prospective freshman
(Pro Fro) from Carrboro High School in Chapel Hill.
N.C. comes from a family tradition of Stanford graduates.
"My parents got their masters degrees at Stanford,"
he said. "That's where they met."
But Stanford's pull was more than just furthering the
family tradition — both the location and academic rigor
drew in Isabel.
"I'm originally from Los Angeles, so I've been yearn
ing to come back to California," he said. Location, plus
the draw of "outstanding business and engineering
schools," put Stanford at the top of Isabel's college list.
"Of course, we can't forget Stanford's reputation,
beautiful weather and campus, scholarly aura and con
nections to the working world." he added, citing Silicon
Valley.
Although Isabel had above average test scores like
most Stanford applicants, he felt that his essays got him
in.
"1 made sure to express my true passions in my essay
and give the admissions officers a look into my life, not
just a boringly perfect list of stats and achievements," he
said.
It worked.
On the other side of the country. Andrew Martin, a
Pro Fro from Radford High School in Honolulu, "was
expecting a rejection, what with the ridiculous amount of
applications." Despite the competitive climate. Martin
secured a spot.
"1 euess admissions saw something they liked." he

said.
A self-described "Navy brat," Martin relied on his
strong recommendations and his status as valedictorian
to gain admittance.
"One teacher told me he wrote 1 was the best student
he's had in his career." Martin said. "I kept my essays
[and] short answers personal and informal. I just talked
about my Navy upbringing and how it shaped my per
sonality."
Daniel Khalessi, a Pro Fro from Mountain View High
School, applied to Stanford because he "hadn't decided
on a major."
"As an undeclared major. I wanted to experience the
best of different fields before committing to a field of
study." he said.
And Stanford's location at the center of the corporate
world didn't hurt either.
"Stanford's location in Silicon Valley also makes it the
optimal choice because it provides the opportunity to
implement my ideas in corporate circles." Khalessi said.
Stanford is the envy of many for its academic stand-

"I made sure to express my true passions in my
essay and give the admissions officers a look into
my life, not just a boringly perfect list of stats and
achievements"

ing. but Matt Grossman, a Pro Fro from Hunter College
High School in New York had never even heard of
Stanford until a good friend with family ties to Stanford
raved about the Farm.
Grossman looked into Stanford, talked to students
and thought the University would be a good fit.
"I loved the idea of a place that had all the stellar aca
demics of an Ivy League school but a less competitive
and buttoned-down student body," he said. "No one in
my family had even seen the place until I got in."
While the 2009 admits were overjoyed to receive their
acceptance letters, for some, getting into Stanford kicked
senioritis — the phenomenon in which seniors tend to
slack on school assignments after college acceptances
roll around — into high gear.
Grossman, Isabel and Martin all have noticed that
their attitude towards school has changed now that they
have received their acceptance.
"I feel like it must've been a different person who
signed up for classes this rigorous in September,"
Grossman said.

On the other hand. Jennifer lee. a Pro Fro from
Scripps Ranch High School in San Diego, actively resis
ted senioritis.
"I didn't want to do anything to jeopardize going to
Stanford, so my work in my classes has been pretty sta
ble," Lee said.
But even Lee. who has maintained a conscious effort
to stay on top of all her classes, noticed a subtle change
in her attitude towards them.
"I am definitely more laid back in my classes now that
the pressure is off, and that I really can learn just for the
enjoyment of learning," she said.
Many ProFros will visit Stanford for Admit Weekend
at the end of April. For ProFros like Lee. that isn't soon
enough for visiting the Farm.
"I've already been waiting since December to go to
Stanford!" she said.
