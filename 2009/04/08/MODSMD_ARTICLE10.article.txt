## EDITORIAL Make your voice heard in ASSU election 
### 
Five years ago, a question many people,
particularly the youth, asked them
selves was, "Why vote?" Then, the
youth vote jumped significantly from 2004 to
2008. from 47 percent to 52 percent. But
what was maybe even more significant was
the fact that a record number of young or
ganizers from both parties helped to shape
the campaign. Perhaps it was the increased
sense of urgency and dire situations on the
economic, military and healthcare fronts, or
maybe it was the charismatic and inspiring
leaders that finally drew out the youth vote.
But whatever the cause, in a qualitatively
different way from 2004. we felt personally
invested in the 2008 election.
Similarly, the ASSU has long been a joke.
Regarded by most students as a resume-pad
der for social climbers, students never really
saw the ASSU as good for anything hut
throwing a lew parties and giving out free
bike lights. This year has substantially
changed that reputation. Perhaps the dear
est indication of the way Dorsey and Harris
has changed the perception of the ASSU is
in the platforms of its potential successors,
l ast year, nil six executive slates promised a
significant departure from the previous
ASSU, while all three slates this year
most notably LymanAVerner â€” have prom
ised to continue in the tradition of the cur
rent Executive. I mm the Wellness Room to
the Service Summit, this year's I xecutive
has left a palpable mark on the University,
and a substantive precedent that the ASSU
can actually do some amazing things.

Yet there are still some areas in which the
ASSIJ could still improve.They still have not
effectively reached out to the graduate pop
ulation. and some of their initiatives, while a
huge step up from the previous year, still
lacked in attendance. While these small set
hacks pale in comparison to their accom
plishments. if the faults of the ASSI J contin
ue to bother you. then do something about it
and make your voice heard.
As the new administration gets ready to
take over this month, there will be many op
portunities to get involved. Regardless of
your background, department, class year or
favorite color, there will be a niche within
the ASSU for you to fill in order to make a
lasting impact on the University now and for
years to come. Both Hauser/Sprague and
Gobaud/de la Torre have made open trans
parency a key component of their cam
paigns, and both are hungrily soliciting feed
back and ideas. So if you have a new idea for
the ASSU, share it.
So vote. Make your voice heard tomorrow
and I ridayat ballot.stanford.edu. Regardless
of your beliefs, the candidates and student
groups you support, or the potential lunch
date you have on Friday, take a couple min
utes out of your day to really look at what
each candidate, slate and student group has
to offer, and make an informed decision.The
stakes aren't nearly as high as a presidential
election, but each and every one of you has
the opportunity once again to change the so
ciety you live in through the democratic
process that this country was founded on.
