# Too Big to Fail
## A
						platform for everyone! 
### 
/)i'<ir prospective constituent:
My name is Kevin Webb, and I am run
ning to represent you as your ASSU
.Senator. Why'.' Simply put. I am hop
ing my election to office will make me feel ac
cepted and loved. As you can see, I am
painful!) honest, a trait that, though detri
mental in m\ personal interactions.should be
endearing in a representative. Right?
Because the race for the 15 ASSU Senate
slots is so heated. I have decided to differenti
ate m\ sell from ni\ technically qualified com
petitors by taking as many opposite tacks as
possible from their oft-similar stances.
Faculty diversity: I am sodirely opposed to
increasing faculty diversity that under my
ASSI J Senate reign (and yes. I use the word
reign because I intend to use student body
funds to pamper myself royal). I will push to
reduce Stanford's faculty to International
Relations Professor Svetlana l.orendsheim,
thereby eliminating faculty diversity alto
gether. A wise man probably once said some
thing about learning more by visiting one
mountain a thousand times than a thousand
mountains once why not apply that to our
teaching stal l? Bonus: budget crisis solved!
Parties: I would end them. Not so much be
cause I dislike parties - on the contrary, I
enjoy dancing poorly and yelling at people
over music as much as the next person â€” but
rather because it is exactly the opposite of
what the ()SA is expecting. I intend to catch
theOSA oil guard, in much the same way that
a motorboat might catch a manatee oil guard.
< herwhelmed by my good will, the ()SA will
become putty in my power-hungry hands.
Sustainability: Shmustainability. Until I
become immortal. I will continue to hold
nothing but contempt lor the 1 litnre genera
lions that will undoubtedly and quite unjustly
outlive me.Tomaxinii/e my enjoyment at the
expense ol theirs. I will use money saved on
faculty to purchase every student a I lumnier
limo and a lull suite of enormous non-Fnergy
Star-approved appliances.
Iransparency: lla! I will build myself and
that rubber stamp formerly known as
"ASSU's other 14 Senators" a gigantic, se
cluded fortress near the Dish using funds no
other groups will know exist. ()ncc there, we
v\ill announce any decisions we reach (I
make) v la smoke signals at completely unpre
dictable intervals, and we will expect full and
immediate compliance with whatever inane,
unnecessary measures we pass. Punishments
will be severe.
Dining: I wholeheartedly support the sta
tus quo. as my campaign finds absolutely no
fault with the quality, variety, cost, service or
availability of Stanford I)ining.
By now. you are probably wondering if I
am espousing such radically unusual ideals.
I rankly. this is my fourth year of hearing cam
paign promises, and I really don't think what
I propose here makes much of a difference.
I lie fact that students are still striving for

greater transparency in the Senate, better
representation in administrative decisions,
more (acuity diversity, different dining plans
and greener policies suggests to me that while
some progress has certainly been made, it
clearly is not enough.
My theory is simply that we students are
on a vastly different time scale from the rest
of the University. Freshmen don't know
enough to really make much of a dent, most
sophomores and juniors are too busy and sen
iors are generally too apathetic about im
proving the school to keep pushing for re
form. Meanwhile. I Jniversity staff can be em
ployed for decades, which takes away all im
petus for them to act quickly and work with
students in that small timeframe where we
have the time and motivation to really change
the school for the better.
l or truly significant change on this campus,
first and foremost, we need to have an estab
lished review process for administrators, so
that students' experiences with Stanford staff
are institutionally factored into job perform
ance. We have this with teachers, and should
treat other Stanford staff no differently.
Next, we need to have a greater number of
recent graduates in I Jniversity administrative
positions,as this is perhaps the best way to en
sure that students who are dedicated and re
form-minded can see their ideas come to
fruition. Many of the most passionate, helpful
administrators I have worked with here have
been recent graduates.
Finally, we need a voice in major staffing
decisions;that is.our next President should be
chosen with student body opinion as a factor.
I have no qualms with President Hennessy,
but student opinion ought to have some say
along with the Hoard of Trustees' in whom
Stanford hires for jobs that affect all of us.
We're smart kids, and we aren't going to
choose someone who will destroy our school
(unless, of course, one of the candidates'
names is ( huck Norris.in which case we sadly
will have no choice but to vote irrationally).
So to my opponents running: If you really
want to make a difference next year, please
focus on pushing for true representative re
form, because if you don't, it won't really mat
ter whether you win or I do.

Kevin isn't actually on the ballot per sr. hut feel
free to write him in. And if there isn't a write-in
option, please email your vote and a link to this
