Suburban living has its disadvantages.
When I first moved to Escondido Vil
lage (which, based on the high tree-to
building ratio, may actually count as exur
ban). I noticed one disturbing fact — there
were no nearby food sources.
I had just left San Francisco's Mission Dis
trict. which, like Santa Cruz's Mystery Spot,
bends the laws of nature. The Mission's par
ticular brand of magic makes it possible to
have three corner coffee shops, two corner
taquerias and a corner dive bar all located at
one four-corner intersection.
After exploring my new environs. 1
learned the closest establishment approxi
mating an eatery was the Starbucks at El
C'amino and Stanford Ave., a full five blocks
from my home. This disturbed me deeply at
the time. Yet it would also lead to a wonder
ful discovery.
About this time last year. I was returning
from said Starbucks one Sunday morning
when I decided to take a slightly different
route home across EV. Almost immediately,
I stumbled upon the Escondido Village com
munity garden.The EV garden is an amazing
little oasis nestled between the Barnes and
Dudley buildings. Surrounded by tall hedges
on three sides, you only really notice it if you
pass the open side, as I did. giving it a secret
garden-ish quality that I love.
I walked among the fifty or so individual
plots, marveling at the agriculture I beheld.
Many of the plots were immaculately
groomed, with neat rows of vegetables care
fully covered by bird nets. Other plots had
not yet been planted for the spring — some
were just dirt, but a few were completely
overgrown bv a cacophony of weeds and
wildtlowers, which enhanced the garden's
charm.
1 was immediately taken by an over
whelming urge to grow a garden, something
that had never happened to me before. Per

haps it was some tangential manifestation of
a paternal instinct, except less fraught with
responsibility because no one calls Child
Protective Services if you neglect your
rutabaga.
In any case, I applied for a plot of my own
and tackled it with gusto. I weeded until my
hands bled (okay, kind of), turned 50 square
feet of earth, put up a fence, spread chicken
manure fertilizer and installed a timed drip
irrigation system that kept my plants moist
throughout the hot day. I planted tomatoes,
corn, basil, lettuce and mini-watermelon
seedlings.
Alas, the watermelons never really got
past the seedling stage. But everything else
thrived. It was an amazing process. At first,
the plants grew slowly, but you could still see
a change from day today if you looked close
ly. As they got larger, however, the rate accel
erated until I could swear my tomatoes were
growing several inches a day. Soon, you
couldn't see the ground anymore. I spent
long hours staking the plants and weeding.
It was worth it. By the end of the summer,
a little bit of beginner's luck and California's
near-perfect climate and rich soil had yielded
me a bumper crop. 1 had produced over a
hundred edible tomatoes, including some of
the most delicious I have ever tasted. But the
real story was the cucumbers. I bought two
cucumber seedlings of the "burpless" variety
at OSH. Yes. that's what they're called. I have
no idea why.
But they must have been genetically engi
neered mutants because I produced monster
cucumbers,some reaching 19 inches in length
and 2-3 inches in width. They were literally
the largest cucumbers 1 have ever seen. I sent
pictures to my friends and family. And sur
prisingly, they were incredible flavorful too.
Now, as I begin to prepare my garden for
this year's planting, I write about my experi
ence for two reasons. First. I hitjhlv recom

mend to everyone that you grow a garden at
some point in your life. It has given me a huge
amount of food, enjoyment and a real appre
ciation for the work that goes into producing
the abundance we take for granted at the su
permarket. There's also something peaceful
and centering about tending to a garden and
watching the plants develop and manifest
themselves. The garden forces you to slow
down — no matter how hard you work, the
plants will grow at their own pace. You can't
speed it up by working all night or sending a
lot of emails.
The second reason I'm writing about my
agricultural proclivities is to support the EV
garden, which has reached capacity. All plots
are taken and there is a long waiting list and
low turnover. Al Atwater. the garden coordi
nator. has emailed the Escondido adminis
tration requesting the garden be expanded.
Now is a perfect opportunity, because EV is
being re-landscaped and the field right adja
cent to the garden is just a torn-up field of
dirt. The garden could easily be almost dou
bled in size, giving many more gardeners —
many of whom are grad student families with
little children — the chance to grow.
And. as Atwater writes. "\Ve have seen
first-hand the cost savings of having a garden
while living in Escondido Village and the
added health benefits of eating organic veg
etables. In this historic time of economic un
certainty. we have the opportunity to show
California, America and the rest of the world
that sustainable living is the future, and it
does not compromise our way of life — it en
hances it."
I strongly urge those in charge of the EV
re-landscaping project to move quickly to
commit to expanding this wonderful re
source.
