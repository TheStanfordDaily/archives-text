As members of Students F 7 or a Better
Stanford, we would like to strongly object to
the mischaracterization of the group in Mon
day's Daily article. "Coalition sets sights on
Senate." According to the article, SBS is an
elitist organization that shares "one idea —
getting themselves elected to the Undergrad
uate Senate." that we are forcing down the
throats of the undergraduate population a
pre-selected group of individuals.
This description could not be farther from
the truth. Students For a Better Stanford is a
collection of 12 highly diverse Senate candi
dates who recognized in each other a shared
vision about effective, transparent student
government. Each member believes that the
best student government is one that governs
pluralistically and keeps in mind the interests
of the ENTIRE student body.
Though generally disregarded by the arti
cle,every student organization that endorsed
this campaign season supports at least one
SBS member; from Fhe Review to SOCC (six
members applied; only one was accepted) to
Students for a Sustainable Stanford, this
group of candidates enjoys varied support
from different organizations, and we are
proud of this diversity, and see it as a sign of
strength.
According to The Daily, "past the glossy
group photos and the lofty vision, the stu
dents who compose SBS simply don't agree
on the issues." We would like to encourage
everyone to visit our Web site,
http://better.stanford.edu, to get a chance to
see exactly what our issues are. and the nu
merous points on which we agree.
Not only does each member have certain
key values that often overlap on their per
sonal platforms page, but we have a detailed
reform agenda that we strongly believe will
help improve the lives of the greater under
graduate community. Yes. we have our differ
ences. but we believe our collective commit
ment to effective student government far
outweighs any ideological disagreements.
We also fervently disagree with the notion
that we "have had little success in convincing
others" that SBS members "have not allied
themselves against any group on campus."
We challenge The Daily or any Stanford stu
dent to find a single example of Students For

a Better Stanford articulating the notion we
are competing against any candidate, or
group of candidates.
Students For a Better Stanford does not
presume superiority over any other candi
dates or a sense of entitlement to elected of
fice; however, all 12 recognize the value and
importance of a competent and responsive
student government that values input from
ALL reaches of the undergraduate body.

Members of Students lorn Heller Stanford
1 appreciate Gerry Shih's April 2 article,
"Civil Disobedience," for the many perspec
tives it offered on the April 3 Movement
(A3M ),an effort by students to challenge the
University's military contracts. ITie article
describes how the A3M was born at a meet
ing of K(X) students representing 14 activist
organizations in Dinkelspiel Auditorium on
April 3. and then went on to occupy the
Applied Electronics Laboratories (AIL)
later in the month for nine days.
But I was frustrated that the article
seemed to miss the main point of the A3M;
that Stanford University was an active partic
ipant in the Vietnam War. Stanford was not
an academic debating society; it was an active
war contractor helping to wage the war by
doing military research and development
work. And it was doing that work at the Al l
building, at the computer center and at the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI) on
Hanover Street.The University had brought
the Vietnam War to campus. The debate was
over whether this activity should continue on
campus or whether it should be stopped.
Shih's article was immersed in the frame
work promulgated by the Stanford adniinis

tration: that the A3M was an anti-war group
that brought its protest against the United
States government to Stanford. Within the
administration's frame, the conflict was real
ly over whether there should be a civil, aca
demic debate about the Vietnam War or
whether that debate should be stopped be
cause people were dying in Vietnam and the
government continued to draft young peo
ple. President Lyman was opposed to the war
— he was sympathetic to the anti-war posi
tion— so within this frame there was no
need for protests. But the University had al
ready taken a side in the dispute — it had ac
cepted millions of U.S. military dollars. The
point of A3M was to challenge the Universi
ty's decision to side with the war-makers, to
force the University to stop being a military
contractor working for the war and to go
back to being an academic institution. The
Stanford Trustees were not just trying to
keep the University open to wide, nonviolent
debate.They were trying to continue the Uni
versity's role as an active war contractor.
Since Lyman was and still is oblivious to
the role of the University as a military con
tractor. he could not understand the opposi
tion, so he assumes it was irrational. If he had
actually listened to the rational arguments
put forth by the A3M,then he might under
stand that this wasn't an academic debate, as
scholars might have about Kantian philoso
phy. but a challenge to the war-making that
the University was actively engaged in.
