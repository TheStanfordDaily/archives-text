The Farm played host to the annual Climbers Rage
Against Gravity competition this weekend in the
Arrillaga Center for Sports and Recreation.
Nicknamed CRAG, the event is an entirely student-or
ganized competition that brings together student climbers
from all over the Bay Area.This year's event, the third of
its kind, was a raging success, including 7«S climbers from 15
different schools, including 18 female participants.
"We were very happy with the turnout," said sopho
more Garrett Fowler.special events manager for the Stan
ford Climbing Wall. "We had 78 this year as opposed to 67
last year."
The competition is of a specific type of climbing called
bouldering. meaning no ropes are used and climbers do
not ascend higher than twelve feet on average.
Each climber has live hours to make as many climbs on
the fifty "problems" set up on the wall as they would like,
but only the top five climbs count toward the score. Each
successful climb is worth between l.(KK) and 6.0(K) points,
with a 20-point deduction for a fall.The man and woman
with the highest combined point totals in each of the three
categories are declared the winners.
Ot the 50 problems presented to this class of climbers,
only 4.S were actually solved. Still, the men's open division
winner, senior Mike Kerzhner, managed an impressive
score of 27,480 (a perfect score was 29.000). Elena Bobyr.
a chemistry graduate student, won the women's open divi
sion with a score of 21,520.
Each winner received a prize pack that included a
hoodie, a chalk bag. a chalk brush and a water bottle. Ac
cording to Fowler, between $2.(HH) and $3,000 dollars
worth of prizes were given out or raffled off to attendees.
This included a Mammut belay device prototype that is
not yet available to the public as well as climbing gear,
clothes and products from CRAG's 25 corporate spon
sors.
But as sweet as the loot was.it wasn't the real reason the
climbers showed up.
"One ol the coolest things is that it gathers climbers of
all abilities — it 's a really good vibe inside when you get 65
people into a room.'' Fowler said. "That many climbers to
gether and something takes over, surpassing previous po
tential and climbing at a level they hadn't climbed at be
fore."
The winners ot the less experienced divisions might
have benefited from the psychological boost and aid of ex
perience in the room. Sophomore Kevin l ing won the in
termediate event on the boy's side with a score of 22.420.
while classmate Samantha Larson, who works at the
climbing wall, won the girl's side with 20.540.The beginner
division titles were taken by sophomore Nick Riva with
13.180 and senior Ava Glasrud with 11.8(H).
In order to orchestrate the event, extensive planning
was required by the climbing staff — the event brought in
outside climbers to help prepare routes, and before the
competition, the walls had to be entirely stripped,at which
point Route-Setting Manager Phil Sandlin had three days
to design and place the different problems. Several
climbers from the area were brought in to help tweak,
score and rank the difficulty of the climbs, which Fowler
described as a "very fun process."
Looking forward. Fowler is confident CRAG will re
turn again next spring, but is even more excited about
other plans.
"Next year, we are considering offering a second com
petition during the fall in conjunction with the ABS
j American Bouldering Series, a professional organiza
tion |. bringing one of their events to Stanford." he said.
