home-court dominance over the weekend with a sweep of
Arizona and Arizona State.The wins pushed the Cardinal's
record to 15-3 overall and 5-1 in Pacific-10 Conference play
as it heads closer to the postseason.
"I thought it was a hig step forward for everyone," said
sophomore Hilary Barte. 'There were definitely a lot of
positive things to come away with from the weekend."
In the middle of a seven-match homestand, the Cardi
nal women had a strong start to their weekend with a 7-0
win over No. 59 Arizona — their fifth shutout of the year.
In doubles, Stanford took the early lead with wins on all
three courts by scores of 8-2,9-8(5) and 8-3, respectively.
The intensity continued into singles where sophomore
Carolyn McVeigh won 6-0. 6-2 over Arizona's Claire Ri
etsch. Barte continued her dominance at the top with a 6-
1,6-3 win over Danielle Steinberg. Clinching the match was
freshman Veronica Li with a 6-1.6-2 decision over Ariane
Masschelein.
Li. who has been playing at No. 4. has impressed her
teammates with her recent strong play.
"I think Veronica has done a great job and is definitely
becoming the teammate and player that I knew she could
reach and sustain throughout the season." Barte said.
On Saturday, Stanford hosted No. 21 Arizona State in a
league dual-match. Again, the Cardinal started off strong
with a sweep in doubles.
Junior Lindsay Burdette would follow with a 6-2. 6-4
win over Nadia Abdala at No. 2.
"I'm beyond proud of I .indsav — she's played so well,"
Barte said.
At No. 1. Barte faced off against third-ranked Kelcy
McKenna from Arizona State. Barte easily dispatched her
opponent with a 6-3,6-3 win.
"I knew she won All-Americans in the fall, so 1 knew
she'd be tough," Barte said of McKenna. "I came in ready

for ;i tough match and it was even, though the score does
n't reflect it. It was definitely a battle."
Li would clinch the second straight match of the week
end with a 6-3,6-3 win over Micaela I lein.
Also of note, senior Jessica Nguyen continued her win
streak at No. 3 with a 6-7 (1). 7-5. (10-4) comeback win on
Friday and a 6-4,6-1 victory the next day.
"I 'm definitely really happy for Jess," Barte said. "She's
coming back to the form that I've always known her to be
[at]."
Riding on a modest three-match win streak, Stanford
was scheduled to face No. 15 Fresno State yesterday. ITie
Bulldogs had upset archrival California earlier this season.

third straight year.
