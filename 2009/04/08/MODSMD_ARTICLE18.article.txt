team dropped a Pacific-10 Confer
ence match to Arizona last Saturday,
falling 4-2 in Tucson.The No. 20 Wild
cats gave the Cardinal its fourth loss
in its last five matches.
Traveling toTucson is never an easy
road trip for the team, with different
courts, scorching weather and a bit of
altitude. Because of inclement weath
er. the match started with singles play.
Arizona started out hot, capturing
wins at No. 5 and 6 singles. At No. 5.
Stanford sophomore Greg Hirshman
lost 6-2,6-1 to Arizona's Pat Metham.
Sophomore Ted Kelly, making his fifth

Arizona's Andres Arango, 7-6 (7-5).
6-2 at No. 2 singles.
But Arizona would counter, win
ning at No. I singles. With the Card's
usual No. 1 player Alex Clayton not in
the lineup, freshman Bradley Klahn
took the top spot for this match, and
lost for the first time since Feb. 20.
Arizona's Jay Goldman broke
Klahn's 10-match winning streak
with a hard-fought 7-6 (7-5),6-4 victo
ry.
Arizona clinched the match with a
win at No. 3 singles, as Andres Carras
co bested junior Richard Wire in three
sets. 2-6.6-3.6-3. Senior Blake Muller
was winning his match when Arizona
clinched, and was credited with the

GAMF NOTES: The Stanford men's tennis
team will look to get back to winning ways
as it hosts Fresno State at Taube Tennis Cen
ter at 1:30 p.m. this afternoon. After going
on a seven-match winning streak during late
February and early March, the Card has
dropped four of its last five matches, most re
cently losing 4-3 to Arizona in Tucson. After
playing Fresno State, the team will travel to
face Oregon and Washington on Friday anc
Saturday, respectively.
"Arizona is a tough place to
play," said senior captain Jeff Zeller.
"The wind was tough."
"Arizona is a [really good] team
this year," he continued. "It was not
too had of a loss for us ... they are
in the top 20 in the nation. Playing
[without Clayton| was tough, too."
Clayton has been sidelined since
rolling his ankle in a match a few
weeks ago, and has not been able to
get back on the court since.
Last week, Stanford came off of
two weekend losses to heat Cal Poly

in a weekday match. Stanford will
see if it can replicate that this week
when the men take on Fresno State
today. The match was supposed to
take place yesterday, but because of
the rain, it was moved to today.
After tomorrow. Stanford will
look to get back on the right track
this weekend in the Pacific
Northwest. The Cardinal will play
the University of Oregon on Friday
and the University of Washington on
Saturday. Both matches are Pac-10
matches and will give the team a
chance to get into the win column in
conference play.The matches will be
at 12:30 p.m. on both days.
