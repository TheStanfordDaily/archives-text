In Forrest (jump, the line goes.
"Don't you just love New Year's'.'
You can start all ewer: everybody
gets a second chance."
For baseball players, their New
Year's Day was Monday. Opening Day
a day that is. to many of us fans, the
greatest day of the year. It is the unoffi
cial beginning of spring and summer.
I lope is in the air. as fans of every team
can put the past year behind them and
move on to a new. and of course better,
season — as ESPN's new ad campaign
shows.
Being the baseball fan I am. I have
been looking forward to spilling out on
paper what I think will happen this sea
son. What I 'm going to do here is make
a few bold predictions, along with a bit
of a season preview.
The Kansas City Royals will make the playoffs for
the first time since 1985

ITie last playoff game the Royals
participated in was an 11-0 victory over
the St. 1 xrnis Cardinals in game seven of
the 1985 1-70 World Series. Just think
what has changed since then — Ronald
Reagan was just beginning his second
term in office.personal computers were
solely a pipe dream and the Colorado
Rockies, Florida Marlins, Tampa Bay
Rays and Arizona Diamondbacks did
n't exist.
So why will the Royals end this 24-
year draught now? Two reasons: First,
they have a young nucleus of players
acquired through the draft and by

shrewd personnel moves by (iM Day
ton Moore that are ready to break out.
Third baseman Alex Gordon (who
homered in his first at hat ol the season
yesterday) was a massive prospect
when he came up,and now in his third
year seems poised to fulfill his world of
potential. Starting pitchers Zack
Greinke and Kvle Davies are both
young and have massive upsides,giving
the Kansas ("itv rotation depth behind
veteran (iil Medic. Some even forecast
Greinke to win the Al. CY Young
Award this year.
The second reason is that the AI.
Central is weaker then usual this sea
son. The White Sox are getting older
and shed payroll 111 the offseason. The
Twins are already battling injuries early
on this season, with star catcher Joe
Mauer and starling pitcher Scott Baker
