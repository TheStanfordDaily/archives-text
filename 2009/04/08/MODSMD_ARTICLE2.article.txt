FanatAXE, a fan support organiza
tion founded bv ASSU
Undergraduate Senate candidate
Zachary Warma *11. was shut down
early winter quarter after an unsuc
cessful run of just a few months. The
Daily has learned. In its run.
FanatAXE spent slightlv more than
$10,000.
Warma won approval for the group
and secured $21,000 in funding by way
of a one-time transfer from ASSIJ
general funds. After he closed the
account last quarter, the approximate
ly $10,000 that remained unspent was
returned to the ASSIJ.
Because the program was not suc
cessful, Warma did not accept his
$1,340 salary, which Stanford Student
Enterprises (SSE) CEO Matt
McLaughlin "ON subsequently con
firmed.
'*1 didn't think I deserved a dime of
that money," Warma said.
Warma said that other than a
$2.<5()5 charge for Web site expenses,
all other FanatAXE expenditures
directly benefited the student body.
The group began as an idea in 2007;
Warma hoped to bring student sup
port to more of Stanford's athletic
teams, recognize more athletic
achievement and bring students
together. Operations began in mid
.lulv. and money was first withdrawn
from the group's account in the last
days of October.
While in operation, the group spon
sored a tailgate for the USC football
game, T-shirts and bus rides for Big
Game and small events at one
women's field hockey game and one
men's soccer game.
Warma attributed the group's fail
ure to several different factors â€”
mainly difficulty in working with the
Office of Student Activities, problems
getting the full support of small athlet
ic teams and. most importantly, a fail
ure to grow the number of students
