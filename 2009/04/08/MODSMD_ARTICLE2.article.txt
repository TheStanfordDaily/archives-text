## Failed FanatAXE spent $10,000 Senate candidate Zack Warma led shut-down club 
### NIKHIL JOSHI MANAGING EDITOR 
FanatAXE, a fan support organiza
tion founded bv ASSU
Undergraduate Senate candidate
Zachary Warma *11. was shut down
early winter quarter after an unsuc
cessful run of just a few months. The
Daily has learned. In its run.
FanatAXE spent slightlv more than
$10,000.
Warma won approval for the group
and secured $21,000 in funding by way
of a one-time transfer from ASSIJ
general funds. After he closed the
account last quarter, the approximate
ly $10,000 that remained unspent was
returned to the ASSIJ.
Because the program was not suc
cessful, Warma did not accept his
$1,340 salary, which Stanford Student
Enterprises (SSE) CEO Matt
McLaughlin "ON subsequently con
firmed.
'*1 didn't think I deserved a dime of
that money," Warma said.
Warma said that other than a
$2.<5()5 charge for Web site expenses,
all other FanatAXE expenditures
directly benefited the student body.
The group began as an idea in 2007;
Warma hoped to bring student sup
port to more of Stanford's athletic
teams, recognize more athletic
achievement and bring students
together. Operations began in mid
.lulv. and money was first withdrawn
from the group's account in the last
days of October.
While in operation, the group spon
sored a tailgate for the USC football
game, T-shirts and bus rides for Big
Game and small events at one
women's field hockey game and one
men's soccer game.
Warma attributed the group's fail
ure to several different factors —
mainly difficulty in working with the
Office of Student Activities, problems
getting the full support of small athlet
ic teams and. most importantly, a fail
ure to grow the number of students
devoted to leading the group.
"There were never enough
hands on deck." Warma said.
Though he initially intended for
the group's hoard to consist of
eight to nine people. Warma said
that board membership dropped
rapidly. A lack of a strong commit
ted core of students eventually

doomed the organization.
Despite the eventual failure of
FanatAXE. Warma maintains that
he learned a lot throughout the
process, which he described as
responsible for both the most
rewarding and frustrating times of
his life.
"I don't regret this process," he
said. "The process was frustrating,
nerve-racking, but it was illuminat
ing. I do not regret trying."
In FanatAXE's wake. Warma is
running a Senate campaign as one
of the leaders of the Students for a

Better Stanford coalition. He said,
however, that the experience has
taught him a lot about the
University, and equipped him with
skills that will come in use in the
Senate.
"Risks need to be taken — the
responsibility falls on me," Warma
said. "If the student body judges me
because of this |as] unfit to serve
on their behest, that is their deci
sion."
