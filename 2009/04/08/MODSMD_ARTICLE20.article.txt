and a half, so I was unsure if I could finish three
rounds," she said. "I'm happy that I was able to com
plete the tournament, but I cannot wait to work on my
game for the next few weeks. I played this tournament
not completely healthy and with minimal preparation
time, but even so. it felt great to compete again."
