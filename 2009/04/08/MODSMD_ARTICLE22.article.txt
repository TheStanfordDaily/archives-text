meetings from 9/80/08 to 3/31/09
Several ASSU undergraduate senators have not regularly attended
the body's meetings in the current Senate term, which will come to
an end in the next few weeks. Senator Orr Keshet '09 missed six
meetings of the 18 that The Daily obtained records for. Four other
senators missed four or more meetings. The two Senators that are
running for re-election have very different attendance records:
Chair Shelley Gao '11 has not missed a meeting, while Zach
Johnson 10 has missed four meetings. Gao is joined by three other
senators with perfect attendance records. Last year, only one sena
tor, Jon Kass '10, had perfect attendance.
