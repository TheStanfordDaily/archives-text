## Senate passes press secretary bill New position created to increase transparency 
### ZOE RICHARDS STAFF WRITER 
The ASSU Undergraduate Senate
passed a hill on Tuesday to hire a
press secretary to cover its meetings.
The hill received overwhelming
support from many Senators in
attendance. It reflects the Senate's
desire to make its proceedings "'as
transparent as possible." as stated in
the bill, and to improve communica
tions with the undergraduate stu
dent body and Stanford publica
tions.
Senator Jonathan McMaster '11.
who authored the bill and has been
working on the project since winter
quarter, shared his hopes for this
new addition to Senate transparency
with The Daily.
"The goal [of the press releases]
would be to get Senate out to the

public and out to the undergraduate
body." McMaster said.
The press secretary would be
selected from outside of the Senate
to maintain objectivity, but would be
selected through an applications
process organized by the ASSU. The
position is likely to be tacked onto
the already existing communications
committee of the Undergraduate
Senate but would report to the col
lective body, rather than to an indi
vidual senator.
The press secretary would attend
all of the Senate's meetings and
write a short report afterwards. That
report would be emailed out to the
undergraduate community and
other interested publications the fol
lowing day.
The tone of press releases would
be similar to that of a formal report,
"to state the facts [and] be really
objective and detailed but still con
cise," McMaster explained.
In terms of finding the ideal sec
retary. Senator Yvorn "Doc" Aswad-
Thomas '11 expressed the impor

tance of finding a writer who is
familiar with the Senate.
"We will be looking for someone
who knows the Senators and Senate
issues and will be able to field ques
tions," Aswad-Thomas said.
Senator Stephanie Epps '10 was ;
also excited about the bill passing \
and agreed with Aswad Thomas
about the need for a press secretary
who has a vested interest in Senate
and what it does.
"It's up to the next Senate to -
actually implement [the bill]." â€ž
Epps said, suggesting that the press ~
secretary could be hired by the end
of spring quarter if the next Senate
is especially quick to start on the
project.
Senate Chair Shelley Gao' 11 also
applauded the bill.
"By institutionalizing [press
releases], we will be moving towards *
more comprehensive reporting of
Senate activities," she said.
