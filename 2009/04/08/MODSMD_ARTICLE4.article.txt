## A 						look at Gobaud/de la Torre Daily sits down with Executive state 
### ELLEN HUET ZOE RICHARDS 
ASSLJ Executive running
mates David Gobaud '08 M.S. '10
and Jay de la Torre *10 spoke ani
matedly about their platform
especially on graduate affairs and
public service — in an interview
with The Daily. The unlikely pair
Gobaud, a graduate student,
and de la Torre, a junior, were
introduced through a mutual
friend only recently — feel that
their differences strengthen their
ability to represent the entire stu
dent community.
Gobaud. whose name is famil
iar to many, ran for Executive last
year with Greg Goldgof '09 and
iost by a narrow margin to cur
rent Executives Jonny Dorsey'o9
and lagan Harris '09. Gobaud
has returned this year for a sec
ond race, hoping to benefit from
the previous campaign experi
ence. He also developed new
platform points, which focus on

bringing new issues intri the juris
diction of the Executive post.
Graduate/undergraduate
slates like Gobaud/de la Torre
have been a rarity in previous
undergraduate-dominated elec
tions. Gobaud and de la Torre
expressed optimism about their
unique ability to involve gradu
ate students, who typically feel
detached from a sometimes
undergraduate-biased student
government.
In last spring's election
Gobaud and Goldgof won more
than four times as many first
choice graduate student votes as
Dorsey and Harris, but lost the
undergraduate vote by a large
margin.
"We want to change the way
the ASSIJ is seen," Gobaud said.
"Over half of the student body at
Stanford is graduate students.
Executive has access to top
administration and money, and
only equal representation makes
sense."
Unlike the other Executive
slate of Bennett Hauser '10 and
Matthew Sprague '10, friends
who have previously worked
together within Stanford Student
Enterprises. Gobaud and de la

Torre come from very different
backgrounds. De la Torre
expounded upon the strengths
that come with these differences,
explaining that they better allow
the slate to represent all parts of
the student body.
"We label our strength as our
diversity of experience and back
ground." de la Torre said. "David
is a graduate student, a techie
and a successful tech entrepre
neur. I am an undergraduate, a
I lizzie and I've dedicated much
of my Stanford career to public
service."
The team hopes that their
relationships with diverse net
works will help them reach out to
more students as they continue
the new trajectory for student
government that the Dorsey-
Harris administration pioneered
this year.
"Jonny and Fagan changed
what the Executive works on."
Gobaud explained. "It used to be
a primarily student life-based
organization with some other
things tacked on. which was what
I had last vear. Iliis year, I have

seen the amazing things that can be
done in other areas."
Some aspects of Gobaud's plat
form have changed since 2008's
campaign, including his original
push for keeping Old Union open at
all hours.
"It's not because I don't want
that or students don't want it."
Gobaud said."lt's because [24/7 Old
Union] is not fiscally responsible."
For de la Torre, addressing sexu
al abuse on campus has been of par
ticular importance. As an intern at
the Center for Relationship Abuse
Awareness, he has worked closely
with abuse survivors and would like
to raise awareness about sexual and
relationship abuse on campus.
Furthermore, de la Torre's expe
rience working with the ASSU to
organize its first Service Summit this
year will help shape his initiatives,
he said, to broaden the scope of
public service on campus.
Gobaud has also already begun
changing the definition of public
service. This past year, he estab
lished a Hack-A-Thon, Dance
Marathon's techie counterpart, join
ing together computer science stu
dents to code 24 hours for philan
thropic organizations.

Gobaud's technological experi
ence as the Executive Operations
Manager for the Dorsey-Harris
administration, as well as his com
puter science background, have pre
pared him with the tools needed to
enhance communication between
the ASSU and students through
new technology-based initiatives, he
said.
'ITie slate has already designed a
Web site targeted specifically at
tackling budget cut questions and
student concerns and transparency,
including forums and question sub
missions for town halls. Gobaud also
discussed plans to enable all stu
dents to have an ©Stanford.edu
email for life if they so choose, stat
ing that he is "confident that this is
going to happen in the next year."
He also intends to scale up the
computer science teaching assistant
model, which currently employs
undergraduates as teaching assis
tants. by pushing for similar pro
grams throughout the University
departments and emphasizing that
students learn better in introductory
classes from their peers.
Gobaud and de la Torre said they
are also committed to working on
the housing Draw and expanding
safe and open spaces, by implement
ing training programs to familiarize
residential assistants (RAs) to
LGBT-sensitive issues. Cultural sen
sitivity training will be held for
future R As and faculty, while social

events will be screened for poten
tially offensive themes.
The team also stressed their
green thumb on sustainabilitv
issues. Gobaud and de la Torre have
pledged to partner with Old Union
and Tresidder to make them zero
percent waste zones by urging the
reinstitution of compost bins
throughout eating areas and
encouraging Union Square and the
CoHo to work together to reduce
waste. Gobaud and de la Torre also
hope to mobilize greener move
ments in housing and dining areas
throughout campus and attain a
waste reduction at the beginning -
and end of the academic year as stu-.
dents move in and out of dorms.
De la Torre and Gobaud empha
sized that their plans as Executive
w ill respond to the needs of students
regardless of the size of the
University's pocket during the try
ing times of economic recession.
"The spirit of the ASSU is....
not in the money that we have, but'
in the students that are the
resources." de la Torre said. "No
budget can cut the wealth that we
have through our students — pas
sion. determination, empathy and m
kindness. These are the things that •
we want not only our campaign, but
our administration, to emphasize."
