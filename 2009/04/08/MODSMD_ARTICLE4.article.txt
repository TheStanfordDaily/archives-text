ASSLJ Executive running
mates David Gobaud '08 M.S. '10
and Jay de la Torre *10 spoke ani
matedly about their platform
especially on graduate affairs and
public service — in an interview
with The Daily. The unlikely pair
Gobaud, a graduate student,
and de la Torre, a junior, were
introduced through a mutual
friend only recently — feel that
their differences strengthen their
ability to represent the entire stu
dent community.
Gobaud. whose name is famil
iar to many, ran for Executive last
year with Greg Goldgof '09 and
iost by a narrow margin to cur
rent Executives Jonny Dorsey'o9
and lagan Harris '09. Gobaud
has returned this year for a sec
ond race, hoping to benefit from
the previous campaign experi
ence. He also developed new
platform points, which focus on

bringing new issues intri the juris
diction of the Executive post.
Graduate/undergraduate
slates like Gobaud/de la Torre
have been a rarity in previous
undergraduate-dominated elec
tions. Gobaud and de la Torre
expressed optimism about their
unique ability to involve gradu
ate students, who typically feel
detached from a sometimes
undergraduate-biased student
government.
In last spring's election
Gobaud and Goldgof won more
than four times as many first
choice graduate student votes as
Dorsey and Harris, but lost the
undergraduate vote by a large
margin.
"We want to change the way
the ASSIJ is seen," Gobaud said.
"Over half of the student body at
Stanford is graduate students.
Executive has access to top
administration and money, and
only equal representation makes
sense."
Unlike the other Executive
slate of Bennett Hauser '10 and
Matthew Sprague '10, friends
who have previously worked
together within Stanford Student
Enterprises. Gobaud and de la

Torre come from very different
backgrounds. De la Torre
expounded upon the strengths
that come with these differences,
explaining that they better allow
the slate to represent all parts of
the student body.
"We label our strength as our
diversity of experience and back
ground." de la Torre said. "David
is a graduate student, a techie
and a successful tech entrepre
neur. I am an undergraduate, a
I lizzie and I've dedicated much
of my Stanford career to public
service."
The team hopes that their
relationships with diverse net
works will help them reach out to
more students as they continue
the new trajectory for student
government that the Dorsey-
Harris administration pioneered
this year.
"Jonny and Fagan changed
what the Executive works on."
Gobaud explained. "It used to be
a primarily student life-based
organization with some other
things tacked on. which was what
I had last vear. Iliis year, I have
