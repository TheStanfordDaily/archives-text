## Debate erupts over off-campus senators Students question ability to perform duties while away 
### MATT SERNA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As students debate the merits
of various ASSIJ Executive and
Undergraduate Senate candidates
this week, another debate has
emerged over the relevance and
importance of senators being on
campus during their one-year
terms.
As reported by The Daily on
Monday, current Senate Chair and
returning candidate Shelley Gao
'11 will be in Washington, DC. for
fall quarter. While the ASSU
Constitution does not prohibit

being away from campus, it does
note that the "Senate shall create
and enforce b\ appropriate meas
ures a policy to ensure atten
dance." Gao said to The Daily that
she intends "to actively participate
in Senate proceedings via Skype.
and travel back periodically to
physically attend the meetings."
In recent memory, however, no
member of the Undergraduate
Senate has spent the fall quarter ol
their term away from campus, and
just three senators in the last two
years — Stuart Baimel '09. Vang
Kou Khang 'OS and Sarah
Golabek-Goldman '10 — have
spent time in the Senate while off
campus, all in the spring, a time o!
transition for the Senate.
