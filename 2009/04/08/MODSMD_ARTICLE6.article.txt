## Debate erupts over off-campus senators Students question ability to perform duties while away 
### MATT SERNA CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As students debate the merits
of various ASSIJ Executive and
Undergraduate Senate candidates
this week, another debate has
emerged over the relevance and
importance of senators being on
campus during their one-year
terms.
As reported by The Daily on
Monday, current Senate Chair and
returning candidate Shelley Gao
'11 will be in Washington, DC. for
fall quarter. While the ASSU
Constitution does not prohibit

being away from campus, it does
note that the "Senate shall create
and enforce b\ appropriate meas
ures a policy to ensure atten
dance." Gao said to The Daily that
she intends "to actively participate
in Senate proceedings via Skype.
and travel back periodically to
physically attend the meetings."
In recent memory, however, no
member of the Undergraduate
Senate has spent the fall quarter ol
their term away from campus, and
just three senators in the last two
years — Stuart Baimel '09. Vang
Kou Khang 'OS and Sarah
Golabek-Goldman '10 — have
spent time in the Senate while off
campus, all in the spring, a time o!
transition for the Senate.
In this year's campaign, no candi
date who is part of the Students for a
Better Stanford (SBS) coalition or
endorsed by the Students of Color
Coalition (SOCC) admitted in
group interviews with The Daily this
past Sunday that they would be
away from campus for any portion
of their term; the two groups feature
23 of the 47 total candidates. SBS
candidates Howard Tan '11 and
Ruthie Arbeiter '12 were not pres
ent at the interviews, while all 12
SOCC candidates were present.
When asked, "Who will be miss
ing any part of their term?" none of
the candidates present at the meet
ings, including Gao, said they would
n't be on campus for any part of
their potential Senate term.
Pressed further by The Daily late
Sunday night. Gao first declined to
answer and then confirmed that she
would be attending Stanford in
Washington (SIW) in the fall. The
commitment deadline for SlW's fall
program was last week.
When asked why she did not ini
tially acknowledge that she would be
away from campus in the fall. Gao
said, "I think this was not a very fair
question because not all candidates
on the ballot were asked."
Baimel, w ho serves as The Daily's
columns editor, was in Washington
last spring and missed the last five
weeks of his first Senate term and
the first five weeks of his second
Senate term. Baimel said that he
believes it is possible to be a con
tributing senator while in
Washington.
"1 think a lot can be done not in
person," he said, "especially because
most Senate business is conducted
via email."
When Baimel was asked about
being in Washington during last
spring's campaign season (see
■"Campaign from the capital." April
7. 2(M)8), he emphasized that spring
quarter was not a vital time for the
Senate.
"There are some things that 1
can't do in the final five weeks [of
spring quarter], but. to be honest,
*some of the issues I'm interested in
don't require me to be there."
Baimel said last spring. "That's a
time when first-term senators have

"Apparently, the role
of an ASSU senator
is so insignificant,
that it can be fulfilled
from across the
country''
— LAUREN SMITH '09
to figure out what to do."
Aside from being away from
campus. Gao will participate in a
program known for a high workload.
Sagar Doshi '09, a peer mentor for
Stanford in Washington, explained
the time commitments required for
SIW.
"As long as you have email
access, it's doable, but you're going
to have to make sacrifices," Doshi
said. "You might not be able to
attend other events and keep up
other obligations. All the internships
work at least 40 hours a week:
they're full-time jobs. You're also
required to take at least 12 units, the
same rule as on campus."
Baimel said that he did "a lot of
the emailing when [he] was at [his]
internship" while in DC.
"It was tiring, but 1 really wanted
to do it."he said. "I think I was able
to participate adequately — 1 defi
nitely fulfilled my responsibilities."
Student reaction to Gao's
planned absence has been mixed.
In response to The Daily's
Monday article on Gao's decision to
go to Washington, Lauren Smith '09
expressed dissatisfaction with Gao's
actions.
"Please offer my congratulations
to Ms. Gao on her deception of the
constituency —an important skill
for a future in politics." Smith wrote
in a letter to the editor for The Daily.
"Apparently, the role of an ASSU
senator is so insignificant, it can be
fulfilled from across the country."

Khanh Le Ml fears that a senator
can't appropriately represent the
student body while not on campus.
"I feel that senators represent
students." she said. "I don't think
they can represent students properly
if they are away from the student
culture that they are trying to under
stand."
In contrast, many students are
taking a wait-and-see approach.
"Given that we now know that
she's going abroad, it's something
that I'd like to see her address," said
Salik Syed '10.
"It's something that should be
held against her. but if she has other
positive qualities that outweigh her
being abroad, people should vote
accordingly," added David
Phillipson '10.
Dawn Ho '11 thinks that Gao's
planned absence may set a poor
precedent for the future.
"I would feel a little betrayed."
Ho said. "It might be a little unfair
for other candidates who are also
vying for this position. If someone
does do it.it might set a bad example
for other senators in the future."
Andy Lomeli '09. who gave up a
chance to go abroad so that he could
serve in the Senate his junior year,
had a unique perspective on Gao's
decision.
"I don't know how much it
would really impact somebody's
performance, because people have
different skills and abilities that they
bring to the Senate." he said. "I did
definitely sacrifice a chance to go
abroad in order to serve in the
Senate my junior year. While 1 do
not regret my decision, the fact that
I did not go abroad is something
that really stuck with me. I had
dreamed of going to Italy—l got
accepted to the program. I took
Italian classes, but that was a sacri
fice I chose to make."
Gao. for her part, said that she
believes that she will be able to do
her job as a senator, regardless of
where she is fall quarter.
"I am very confident in my abili
ty to serve as a very effective sena
tor." she said, pointing out that as a
returning senator, she would hope to
provide valuable institutional mem
ory and guidance to the new sena
tors this spring.
