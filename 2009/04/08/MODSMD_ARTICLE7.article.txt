## Columnist Gail Collins offers humor on Obama 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
New York limes columnist ("mil Collins
spoke last night at Kresge Auditorium about
Barack ()bama's rise to office and the manner in
which Ins legacy will be judged.
Collin's lecture, entitled "The Election and
Then." began with an argument that the most
important part of the 2008 presidential cam
paign was not the run-up between President
Obama and Senator John McCain, but rather
the heated contest for the Democratic nomina
tion. She examined at length why American vot
ers ultimately chose Obama over Hillary
Clinton, despite their strikingly similar plat
forms.
Collins emphasized that both candidates
were "people who were clearly adept at learning
from experience." However, in the race for the
Democratic nomination, the deciding factor was
the synergy between the right people and the
right moment. ITie Obama campaign demon
strated this quality in abundance. Collins sug
gested.
"I think it was because people just wanted to
turn a page they wanted new eyes looking at

problems," Collins said. "To he able to speak to
a nation that is so fractured in the stuff that it is
interested in and the way it pets its information
and the way it communicates — it's a trick that
Barack Obama is really, really good at."
Collins was more elusive about the legacy of
the current administration, acknowledging that
it is too early to judge what will happen in the
next four years. Nevertheless, she pointed out
that Obama must confront many difficult prob
lems. from the economic recession and an ailing
auto industry to energy demands for the future
and education reform.
In an interview with The Daily after her lec
ture. Collins said that providing health care to
Americans is one of the most important factors
in determining the relative success of the
()bama Administration.
"lie said all the way through the campaign
that.. this has to be done." Collins said. "It is
both a social responsibility and the key to our
future economic success."

had read the columnist's New York
l imes articles.
"I wasn't quite sure what she was
going to talk about." Finley said.
"Afterwards. I thought she had a .
great sense of humor, which came
out much more vibrantly in per
son."
Indeed. Collins mixed serious
business with wry humor through- ■
out her speech, frequently making
hotshots in Washington the targets
of her wisecracks. She garnered a
loud round of applause and laugh
ter in a remark about treasury
Secretary Tim Geithner.
"lie cannot get a deputy to save
his soul because apparently nobody
in the entire economic sectot has
tax returns that bear scrutiny."
Collins quipped to an amused audi
ence. "He's just there all by himself,
like some kid whose parents didn't
show up to bring him up for
Christmas from boarding school
Collins concluded the interview
after her lecture on a more serious
note about the role ol lournalism in
society.

comes next preserves that criti
cal news-gathering ability, she told

ways."
