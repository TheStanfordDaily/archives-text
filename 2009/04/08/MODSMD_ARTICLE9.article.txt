\j \j tently throughout
t the year, one art
project will remain a permanent fix
ture on the walls â€” the caricatures
of famous, or infamous, people affil
iated with the University.
The idea of placing caricatures of
famous individuals originated from
CoHo owner Ray Klein's desire to
replicate the adorned walls of
Sardi's. a famous restaurant in New
York. The 82-year-old joint, herald
ed hv many as a Broadway legend,
is known more for its famous clien
tele than the actual food. As a trib
ute to the celebrities, caricatures are
drawn of the famous frequenters of
the restaurant.
"1 had a restaurant in Santa
Barbara where I did the same thing
as Sardi's." Klein explained. "It's
just a niee way to peak people's
interest and let them gaze at the art
on the walls, which also feature peo
ple associated with the University."
But which lucky individuals
receive the honor of having their
faces permanently scotch-taped on
the walls for all to view?
Before the CoHo even re
opened. Klein asked Stephanie
Werner '11, the CoHo Events
Programmer and former Daily
opinions editor, to begin the selec
tion process and submit the individ
uals' headshots to Zach Trenholm. a
San Francisco Chronicle caricatur
ist.
"There weren't any specific crite
ria." Werner said. "Ray told me his
idea and to make it happen."
So Werner began messaging
email lists to get an idea of whose
headshots she should submit. The
response, however, was lackluster,
so Werner went ahead with her own
submissions. She chose the obvious
celebrities like Condi, Reese and
Chelsea, but some students won
dered how current students, like
Shelley Gao 'II and Alex Clayton
'11. were able to land a coveted spot
on the wall.
"The more famous faces are
obvious why I chose them, but I've
definitely gotten a few questions
about why Shelley Gao was on
there." Werner said. "For these cur
rent students, it was totally random:
I looked through The Daily's head
lines and picked the people who
appeared a lot."
Gao often strolls by her carica
tured face when she stops for a cup
of coffee.
"It's mind-blowing to see me up
there with these other famous and
incredibly accomplished people,"
she said. "I feel really honored. It
really resonates with me of what we
all can do at Stanford."
At $25 per caricature. Klein is
looking to expand the project "until
the walls are covered." Werner
explained.
Many students and alumni love
the idea of being able to recognize
famous alums, even wishing for
more information about each indi

vidual, such as graduation year and
major.
"We've been getting nothing but
positive feedback." Werner said.
Some students, however, have a
few suggestions of their own.
"It's a really cool idea, but
there's no uniformity." said Kristen
Maria '09. "Right now. it just seems
messy."
And others, including alumni, are
completely opposed to this art
form.
"I think they are ridiculously
goofy and utterly distracting in that
environment and a rather inappro
priate way to pay tribute to our
noteworthy alumni." wrote Erin
Browne Montoya '94 in an email to
The Daily."By trivializing the honor
of being recognized, it belittles both
their association with Stanford and
what should be our pride in that
association."
Josh Wong 10 agreed.
"They're tacky; I feel like I'm
smacked in the brain every time I
look at them." he said. "The CoHo
should be decorated with tasteful
art that should stimulate conversa
tion. Coffee houses are quintessen
tial places where ideas and conver
sations take place. Why are we cele
brating individuals? These would be
more appropriate in the Old Union
or The Axe & Palm where there's
more of a diner atmosphere."
While completely moving the
caricatures isn't a future plan that
Werner and Klein have in mind,
they are open to a more transpar
ent. engaging selection process or

any other suggestions regarding the
project. Both Werner and Klein are
receptive to nominations, as they
are the lirst to admit that some peo
ple are likely missing.
So if the idea of seeing your car
toon face on the CoHo walls is
enticing, win a Nobel Prize or lead
your team to the NC'AA
Championships and in the next few
months. CoHo frequenters just
might he admiring or pondering
your impressive achievements.
Any nominations or constructive
suggestions regarding the selection
process can be sent to Stephanie
Werner at swernerl@stanford.edu.
