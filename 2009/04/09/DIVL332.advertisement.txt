After several weeks of debate over public financing in the ASSU, the Gobaud/de la Torre Executive slate spent $1,496.49, just a few dollars shy of the $1500 total it was
allotted after accepting ASSU funding. The Hauser/Sprague Executive slate, which did not choose to accept public financing, spent $1,840.81. Spending in the Executive
race fell dramatically from last year, when the winning Dorsey/Harris slate spent $3,597.31 and the second-place Gobaud/Goldgof slate spent $3,768.55.
