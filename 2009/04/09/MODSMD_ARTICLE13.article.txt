## EDITORIAL Service Summit an inspiring success 
### 
If you ask anyone who worked on last
weekend's Stanford's Service Summit,
they will tell you that that the path to the
summit was hard, but the view from the top
was breathtaking.
Thursday's "Vision 2020" session and the
weekend summit itself were outstanding re
minders of what we, as a campus community,
can achieve in terms of setting the agenda
and tone for this university. While this sum
mit is only the beginning of what we hope
will be a major push for an expanded campus
role in public service, it was a truly impres
sive beginning.
The summit's nine focus area forum ses
sions covered topics ranging from more tra
ditional service areas such as health, poverty
and education to public interest law. techno
logical solutions for social challenges and so
cial entrepreneurship. Each was filled with
highly accomplished and inspirational pan
elists— everyone from a former president
of Stanford, to tenured professors, to law and
education school students, to the current
ASSU Vice President, to representatives of
local nonprofits and social entrepreneurs —
and a diverse and engaged group of students,
and even community members determined
to reshape Stanford's role in public service.
Brainstorming within the sessions led to a
number of creative suggestions and insights
that the ASSU's dutiful note-takers record
ed. Many of these suggestions, such as creat
ing a highly publicized database for service
opportunities, establishing a public service
GER and integrating service into the class
room — especially in departments outside
the humanities and social sciences — are
tangible proposals that can. and hopefully
will be. implemented.
After the focus sessions, former Califor
nia State Comptroller and ASSU President
Steve Westlv '7<X MBA '83 spoke of the im
portance of and need for students to become
involved in public service. He was followed
by a fireside chat with Dr. Larry Brilliant, ex
ecutive director of Google's philanthropic
division and a participant in the World
Health Organization's successful effort to
eradicate smallpox from the world. Both
men were passionate, inspirational, enter
taining and earnest about the increasing
need for students such as ourselves to go into
public service and the keynote capped an
enormously successful weekend.
The extremely well-run summit facilitat
ed the ideas and excitement. At check-in at
tendees were handed nametags and infor
mation sheets directing them to their pre
registered sessions. Multiple ASSIJ note
takers were on hand to for each session.The
spacious and airy Yang and Yamazaki Envi
ronment and Engineering (Y2E2) building
proved an ideal space for the summit. Even
the summit's Web site was crisp and well-or
ganized, with events and speakers listed, off
campus directions provided and the sum

mit's partners and sponsors catalogued.
Summit co-organizers Anuraag Chiguru
pati "09 and Karen Warner '10 in particular
deserve special recognition for the tremen
dous job they did. as do numerous other stu
dents who brought the summit to fruition.
The dedication of so many campus
groups,students, faculty and staff involved in
making the summit a success illustrates how
significant an issue public service at Stanford
is and should continue to be.
Even in a time
of budget cuts and
economic anxieties,
public service at
Stanford must be
a priority...
One of the most notable changes in this
year's ASSU elections versus last year's is
the degree to which candidates have made
public service expansion a greater part of
their platforms.The Lyman/Werner ticket, in
fact, features "Just A Couple of Affable Pub
lic Service-Oriented Guys" and both Gob
aud/de laTorre and 1 lauser/Sprague have in
dicated their desire to build on the public
service momentum initiated largely bv our
current ASSU Executives Jonny Dorsey '09
and Fagan 1 larrisMß
De la Torre's emphasis on his public serv
ice background — he was Pre-Summit
Events Coordinator — was one of the crite
ria that led to The Daily's endorsement of
the Gobaud/de laTorre ticket.
We hope this push for public service con
tinues. I - ven in a time of budget cuts and eco
nomic anxieties, public service at Stanford
must be a priority. After all. in the midst of a
global economic crisis, the United States
Senate recently managed to overwhelming
ly pass the Edward M. Kennedy Serve
America Act to expand public service op
portunities.
Stanford's Service Summit was a re
sounding success, but we must work hard to
ensure that the ideas and excitement of the
past weekend are harnessed going forward.
The summit offered Stanford a glimpse of
what we're capable of in transforming public
service. I et's not lose sight of that goal.
