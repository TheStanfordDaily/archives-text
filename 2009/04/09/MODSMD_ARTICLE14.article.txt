My name is Anton Zietsman. and I am
currently running for Undergraduate Sen
ate. I am the only SOCC -endorsed candi
date to he a part of Students for a Better
Stanford. Given my unique position, I be
lieve that my perspective on the Senate race
and how it has developed over the past tew
days would be a valuable supplement to the
growing debate on candidate slates and
coalitions.
As the idea of Students for a Better Stan
ford gradually took form. 1 applied for the
SOCC endorsement. I did so because I be
lieve strongly in the value of our community
centers, because I vvill not allow acts of intol
erance. and because graduate student and
faculty diversity is paramount lor the educa
tion of our students. Ihese were my beliefs at
the time; I stand by them today.and will con
tinue to so in the luture.
Along with myself, six out of the 12 cur
rent members of Students for a Better Stan
ford applied for a SOC( endorsement for
the same reasons I did. ()ne can only specu
late as to why they ultimately did not get the
endorsement, but the fact remains that I was
the only one left on both sides.
As campaign week drew closer. I grew
concerned that the student body would per
ceive the two groups as running in opposi
tion to one another. This conception trou
bled me because nothing could be father
from the truth. I made a point of telling my
colleagues on SBS that we would have to
work hard to represent ourselves in such a
way as to avoid the negative effects of biased
and uneducated judgments. Unfortunately,
The Daily never gave us a chance, and the
very situation I dreaded being placed in

seems to have occurred.
While the primary concern for every can
didate is to get elected, the fashion in which
the campaigns are conducted will inexorably
have repercussions on the development of
interpersonal relationships on the Senate. It
was my hope that we could wade through
this election cycle without abasing ourselves
to smear-campaign tactics.
The inaccurate depiction that The Daily
gave of SMS in Monday's article ("Coalition
sets sights on Senate") served as a catalyst to
precipitate the Senate race into an exacer
bating spiral.'Flie article portrayed SBS as an
insubstantial, elitist and power-hungry
clique, thereby providing others with the
stick with which to beat us.Though we strove
during the interview to avoid precisely this
conception. I was disappointed to find that
the article still managed to cast a negative
shadow on the electoral landscape.
What I want, beyond all other things, is
for the next Senate to he collaborative,com
petent and effective.
I now know every candidate on both
coalitions and consider many of them to be
my friends. If I do happen to get elected. I
look forward to working with all of them be
cause I know that we share the same passion
and zeal when it comes to the betterment of
our community. But most importantly, I can
now say with the full measure of my confi
dence that, on an individual level, each and
every one of the candidates both on SOCC
and SBS can work with one another towards
a goal that is common to us all: a better Stan
ford.
