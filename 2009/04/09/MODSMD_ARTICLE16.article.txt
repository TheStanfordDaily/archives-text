# Mark My Words
## A 						house divided 
### 
On May 9, 1754, perhaps the most fa
mous political cartoon in the history of
the United States was published. De
picted was a serpent, cut into eight separate
pieces meant to represent the British colonies
of America. Underneath the snake read the
words "Join, or die." The cartoon accompa
nied author Ben Franklin's editorial on the
need for unity among the colonies in the face
of the French and Indian War. and later the
American Revolution.
Ilie meaning behind the cartoon has not
lost importance in the 250 years since its cre
ation. Today, more than ever, we the people
need to unite as one or else risk having our
rights and liberties picked apart by the very
government once envisioned to protect them.
Across the country today, we see hun
dreds. if not thousands, of individual special
interest battles being waged. Gay marriage,
sin taxes, drug prohibition, gun control — all
are smaller issues of the larger whole, the con
tinued fight for personal liberty.
Just this week, a new federal tax on tobac
co was instituted, which raised taxes on every
thing smoking related, including a 1,250 per
cent increase on the price per pound of un
packed (loose) tobacco.
Upon hearing this, most would probably
react with apathy; some may even be in sup
port of the measures — if smoking is bad for
you. why not punish those who do it?
1 myself disapprove greatly of smoking,
but that's not the point.
The point is that as soon as we stand by
while our fellow citizens are stripped of the
most basic of liberties, to do as you wish to
your own body, whether through prohibition
or de facto prohibition via exorbitant taxa
tion (the practice of which helped spawn the
Revolution in the first place), then we implic
itly surrender every other right in its own due
time.
Ilie same legal reasoning used to strip
smokers of their right to do as they wish can,
in turn.be used for other unnecessary vices or

luxuries. New York State wants to tax unsatu
rated fats to make up for its budget deficit and
"encourage health." Oregon is trying to raise
its tax on beer by nearly 2.0(H) percent for the
same reason. Are we starting to see a trend?
And yet. we are too busy fighting each
other over differences of moral opinion, so
much so that we divide ourselves in the over
all fight against the government to protect
our liberty.
While religious fundamentalists battle the
leftist homo agenda, the liberal democrats
rally to take the guns and ammo out of the
hands of right-wing NRA whackos. And all
the while, as we are busy yelling ourselves
hoarse at one another, the government quiet
ly moves in and takes all of our rights from un
derneath us.
Divide and conquer has been used as a
military and geopolitical strategy for cen
turies. Why? Because it works. It plays on the
dependable tragedy of the common action
problem; group A won't help group B be
cause B's cause is not important to group A.
and vice versa.
The big hand of government, however,
sees no distinction between the groups; it only
sees the power it aims to acquire and the pop
ulation it seeks to regulate.
Ilie government is not on our side, as many
activist groups might like to think. through
the years of court cases and legal evolution,
the government has conveniently declared
some rights "fundamental" and others not.
Without getting into too much legal mumbo
jumbo, this just means that judges pay more
attention to some rights than others.
Ilie primary difference? Ilie overwhelm
ing majority of laws that abridge fundamental
rights get thrown out upon judicial review
and the overwhelming majority of laws af
fecting "other" rights are left as is. free to
trample on our liberties.
What are the fundamental rights? Ilie
"civics class rights": speech, religion, discrim
ination. voting, etc.

The not-so-fundamental rights? The right
to your property, for one. and the right to pur
sue your own devices as long as they do not
harm anyone else, for another.
Are these issues as black and white as I
make them out to he? Of course not.
Smoking has externalities such as second
hand smoke, saturated fats really aren't good
for you and some cases of eminent domain
may truly be justifiable.
I understand that. Moral beliefs are beliefs
(usually) for good reason, issues of health and
safety have a plethora of perspectives and
empirical research to back them.and the gov
ernment isn't always enacting a malevolent
plan to enslave humanity.
What I am asking is not that everyone
dump their own individual opinions immedi
ately and join together in one big happy com
mune. I only ask that instead of sitting idly by.
or worse, fighting against someone trying to
protect their individual liberty, you instead
join them in their fight for their rights, be
cause their fight is your light too.
Ilie fight for liberty affects lis all as Amer
icans. Our government was structured to rely
on the people to protect themselves from the
government by way of the Constitution. II
the people do not defend themselves, the
government has no incentive to respect their
boundaries.
By turning on our neighbors, we undercut
our own freedom and help those who would
intrude on our liberty place the noose around
our own necks, for as Ben I ranklin also once
famously said,"We must all hang together, or
assuredly we shall all hang separately"

When they came for the smokers, I remained
silent; I win not a smoker When they came for the
drinkers, I remained silent; I was not a drinker.
When they came for the gun owners. I remained
silent, for I was notarial owner When they came
for me, there was no one left to speak out for me.
