# Dem by Downer
## Nicole Demby CS co-terms gone wild 
### 
I received an email at the end of last quar
ter informing me that mv department. In
terdisciplinary Studies in Humanities, is
ceasing to exist at the end of next year be
cause the University is cutting its funding.
Despite this rude insertion of the global eco
nomic crisis into my life, the situation still
feels abstract, like a vague specter haunting
my life from a distance.
Part of the reason the crisis seems less
concrete to me than perhaps it does to others
is because I have long since resigned myself
to a life of dubious monetary stability. Con
centrating in Visual Arts and Philosophy. 1
can't say I ever really had pretensions of hav
ing a six-figure job right out of college. So
while the terrible job market certainly does
n't help, it doesn't really drastically change
any of the prospects I have long held for my
self.
Talking to qualified seniors whose recent
experiences searching for jobs makes them
vouch that the situation is actually as bad as
everyone says it is. I try to empathize, but can
only muster sympathy. 1 know on an intellec
tual level that there are probably hundreds of
ways in which the state of the global econo
my is making my current and future life more
difficult, yet I can't help but feel viscerally
that not that much has changed for me.
While I don't wish to insinuate that all hu
manities students have resigned themselves
to a life of artistic starvation, there is a gal
lows humor now detectable among upper
classmen from all disciplines that has been
something humanities majors have engaged
in since the dawn of time. This humor might
entail jokes about making post-college plans
that postpone real life (graduate school, hu
manitarian adventures, etc.). or making

cracks about throwing away X thousands of
dollars on a university education, only to he
totally unemployable upon graduation.
These jokes have always been made with a
wry smile and a slight sigh. We knew what we
were getting ourselves into when we decided
to study comparative literature instead of
management science and engineering, so the
least you can do is let us be appropriately bit
ter about it.
Vet as the economic crisis renders the
playing field of (un)employability equal for
both teehies and fuz/ies, the former group
may be beginning to understand a wisdom
the latter group has long possessed — the
understanding that rushing into "real' life
right out of college isn't always the best thing.
I was recently talking to a CS co-term
friend of mine (yes, I have CS co-term
friends) who told me that on a whim he al
most forwent his long-time dream of working
in Silicon Valley to go teach programming to
children in Africa. A hidden boon of the cri
sis may be that, suddenly, life choices that

once seemed daring, or perhaps even sell de
structive to those on a teleological trajectory
to riches, now seem like wise choices. A year
long soul-searching trip to India alter gradu
ation? It's not like you have anything better
to do. Opting to work on a creative project
that may or may not pay off in the end? What
have you got to lose?
While we all w ill undoubtedly suffer, and
probably in some quite painful ways, at the
hands of the worst economic downturn since
the (ireat Depression, perhaps we are all
freer now to evaluate what's meaningful, in
dependent of money. While the crisis will
devastate those who decided before that
money w;is of utmost importance to them,
the rest ol us can embrace this silver lining.
The aforementioned gallows humor is in
dieative of taking life a little less seriously in
a w;iy that enables us to experiment through
our life choices, perhaps ending up in inter
esting places we never envisioned.
