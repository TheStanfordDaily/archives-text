## Tending the Stanford garden 
### ELIZABETH TTTUS 
Sarah Wiederkehr stared hard at
a stand of fruitless trees on the
Stanford Community Farm.
"These ones need some atten
tion." she explained to her students
one recent afternoon. "They haven't
been pruned in tjnite a while."
Wiederkehr concentrated on the
orchard a moment longer, then
turned back to the dozen students in
her Sustainable Agriculture Issues
class.They stared back.
"Anyway." she said, breaking into
smile, "shall we take a little tour?"
Wiederkehr understands the diffi
culty of growing things, and she is on
campus as Stanford's first-ever "farm
educator" to help students under
stand. too. Hired last fall to teach
classes, maintain part of the farm, put
its produce in dining halls and run
outreach projects, the 32-year-old
represents the latest in Stanford's
efforts to address the main agricul
tural sustainability question.
"One of the huge challenges is
how to grow enough food to feed the
population, but at the same time,
doing it in a way that reduces the
negative environmental impacts and
the social impacts." explained Pamela
Matson, dean of the School ol Earth
Sciences.
The question is a salient one lor
Wiederkehr's new students. They
have read Michael Pollan's "The
Omnivore's Dilemma." seen a new
farm bill passed, and know that one
billion people go hungry for lack of
economic — not just physical
access to food. The students are
keenly interested, hut lew have had

hands-on experience in agriculture.
That is partly why she brought her
class to see the dormant orchard on
that unseasonably warm day. Perhaps
if she can teach them to nurture trees,
she can bring an agricultural educa
tion program to life.
Wiederkehr wasn't always a
farmer.The daughter of a safety engi
neer and an Episcopal Church work
er, she grew up around New
England, went to the University of
New Hampshire tin work-study and
found herself on the student farm the
summer after her freshman year. She
loved the work, the plants and the
people.
"It just kind of changed the course
of my life." she said. She graduated
with a degree in horticulture and
agronomy, then went west to see
large-scale agriculture for herself.
Wiederkehr arrived in northern
California and began working agri
cultural research jobs at UC-Davis
and the United States Department of
Agriculture before putting down
roots in two masters' programs at
Davis. One program. Integrated Pest
Management, allowed her to travel
around the state.
"Lettuce in the Salinas Valley
[was] awing to me." Wiederkehr said.
The other program. International
Agricultural Development, gave her
a community made up largely of
Peace Corps alumni and her first
taste of "real social science" —eco-
nomics and theory, she said — that
was a needed complement to her sci
ence coursework.
But in the middle of writing her
second thesis, a friend offered
Wiederkehr land outside Davis to

start a farm. And Wiederkehr knew
where she wanted to be.
"I pretty quickly realized that 1
couldn't do it all "she said."l quit my
thesis." Wiederkehr named the place
Full Circle Farm and ran it for the
next three-and-a-half years.
She loved the work — being her
own boss, managing five acres of
organic produce and raising animals.
In fact, a man named Burger sold her
a dairy goat. Josefina; Weiderkehr
married Burger and brought Josefina
back with her.
But her farm was less sustainable
economically.
"I think two years ago. my grand
income was $H.5()0. Wiederkehr
said. "So I was struggling."
I let - quick laugh belies how much
she seems to miss Full Circle when
she talks about it.
"I really enjoyed being in my dirty
clothes and dirty hands, and not feel
ing like anyone was going to care."
she said.
So she got a job managing a farm
in Sunnyvale. It was closer to Burger,
the animal husbandry manager at a
farm called Hidden Villa in Los Altos
Hills. One day. Burger got an email
that Stanford was looking for a "farm
educator" — someone, the job
description said, who could "support
the academic mission of Stanford
University by educating students and
the Stanford community about sus
tainable food and agriculture sys
tems."
Wiederkehr applied, and her
experience as a researcher and tarm
operator stood out.
"She brings something very spe
cial to Stanford." Matson said.
Wiederkehr not the job. It was fall
