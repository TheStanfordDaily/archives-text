# Sarah Wiederkehr thrives in role as Stanford's first "farm educator"
## 
### 
2008, and she began to take stock of
this new Farm.
On Feb. 19, Joel Salatin — the
self-described "beyond organic"
farmer turned motivational speaker
featured in "The Omnivore's
Dilemma" — came to campus.
Wiederkehr was his guide for the
day.
Salatin's visit marks the latest of
the half-dozen projects in which
Wiederkehr has become involved
during her short tenure. There are
two classes this quarter: Earth
Systems 180B: Local Sustainable
Agriculture, and Earth Systems 1 S3:
Agriculture in Film. There is also
management of the teaching section
of the community farm, a pilot gar
den program at Row houses and a
proposal for a new. 10-acre teaching
farm — something that, if successful,
would be an unprecedented step in
agricultural education for Stanford.
Administrators explained that it is
all driven by student demand.
"Our classes have had population
explosion." said Deana Fabbro-
Johnston. associate director of the
Earth Systems program.
With no unified academic pro
gram for agriculture to speak of, stu
dents interested in food and farms
often choose Earth Systems. lT»is
year, there are 130 students majoring
in the program.
"It's a record high." Fabbro-
Johnston said. "Once students found
out we had a farm educator on board
who knew what she was talking
about, the flood of emails just started
coming."
Erin Gaines '07, the sustainable
foods coordinator for Stanford

Dining and an Earth Systems alum
nus herself, concurred.
"We're getting a record number
of people contacting me or
[Wiederkehr] about gardening." she
said."The great thing is all the differ
ent disciplines; everyone's connected
to eating."
The interest is evident by the stu
dents who Hocked to Salatin's events.
He spoke to Wiederkehr's and oth
ers' classes, toured the farm, ate din
ner at Ricker Dining and lectured in
Annenberg Auditorium that evening.
Wiederkehr was not fazed by
Salatin, whom she calls a "celebrity
farmer." In the hallway after class,
they chatted with Gaines about
lunch.
"'That could be the centerpiece ol
a meal." Salatin raved about
Wiederkehr's soup. "What was the
spice?"
"Some rosemary and black pep
per." she said.
Wiederkehr told them about
cooking for her own wedding, and
then said it was about time to gel
moving. Celebrity farmer or not. she
had work to do.
Wiederkehr is not immune u
doubts about her job. She question 1
the feasibility of one person educat
ing an entire campus about tht
20,000 meals people eat each da>
here, where those meals came Iron
and what it will take to keep produc
ing them.
"1 wish there were two or thret
more of Erin and me." she said. ()n<
day in her office in the Yang am
Yamazaki Environment and Energ]
Building. Wiederkehr buried her fact
in her hands while talking about he

classes.
"I've never read the farm bill." she
said. "Maybe I structured the class
wrong, starting with stutt I didn't
know about. Ah! I'm stressed about
next quarter's class."
Charles Parker, an agricultural
education expert, agreed that
Wicderkehr's order is a tall one.
"How does one person get to
I4.(H)0 students?" he asked. "It has to
be a consolidated effort."
Parker consulted in the California
Department of Education's agricul
tural education unit for 13 years. He
discussed techniques he found suc
cessful when he was a high school
agriculture teacher.
"The freshmen, they taught the
class." he said of one assignment.
"They developed a 50-minute lesson.
Talking about apples in California,
maybe they're going to make apple
pie. They're teaching their fellow
classmates. It's not me lecturing. It's a
group of people."
Despite her doubts. Wiederkehr
has created a protocol in the
Sustainable Agriculture Issues class
that mirrors Parker's carelulK honed
method, right down to the minutes in
the class. Each meeting, two students
are assigned to lead the discussion;
Wiederkehr jumps in only when nec
essary.
On a Tuesday in the second-tloor
classroom in the Geology Corner, it
seemed to be engaging students.
"Alright, you guys had all that
reading to do, all that inspiring read
ing." a discussion leader starts. "Who
did all SI pages?"
it was only 42 alter the photos."
Wiederkehr shot back with a smile.
"Okay.so let's talk about confined
animal feeding operations." the stu
dent said. Fifty minutes later, time
was up. but the class was si ill talking.
Despite her doubts, then.
Wiederkehr is making progress on
the mission for which she was hired.
She spoke of one student who told
her that he was paying closer atten
tion to his meat consumption since
taking the class.
"I was just excited to hear that
from talking in our class, he's started
making conscientious decisions
about choosing food." she siiid. She
collects these small interactions with
students, her measure of success for
now.
She looked out her office window
and talked about the plans she is
making for a new orchard. Apricot,
plum and fig trees, she hopes. They
are a "representation of what you
have on a small local farm." she said.
Wiederkeher's mind is on seeing this
crop through.
