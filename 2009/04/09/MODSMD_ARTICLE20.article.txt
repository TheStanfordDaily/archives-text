## HOME-ING IN 
### JACOB JAFFE DESK EDITOR 
Entering the final two weekends of the reg
ular season, the Stanford men's volleyball
team is looking forward to continuing its re
cent surge of momentum.
" This is the part of the season we've been
looking forward to." said junior opposite Evan
Romero.
After playing 14 of its first IS matches away
from the Farm, the No. 5 Cardinal 12-6
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation) has final
ly reaped the benefits of its schedule, playing
11 of its ! .st 13 matches at home, including the
four remaining matches.
"During this home stretch, we've been able
to feed off the energy from our fans." said
freshman middle blocker ( ins Ellis."lt spilled
over into our last road trip, and it's given us a
lot more confidence."
This last road trip included wins over two
top-10 teams. No. S Cal State-Long Beach in a
five-set comeback thriller, and No. 10 UC-San
Diego in four sets. Romero led the way for the
Cardinal in both matches with a combined 41
kills over the weekend, including several cru
cial kills in the fifth set against Long Beach.
These two wins extended the Cardinal's
conference winning streak to eight matches
and its overall run to II wins in its last 12
matches.
"The key is our consistency all around,"
said Romero, who leads Stanford with 415
kills this season. "We're not trying to do too
much."
Stan ft. id's consistency will be tested this
weekend when it faces No. 6 BYU twice in a
row. The two teams have not met since both
teams' opening match of the season on Jan. 9.

very familiar with BYU's strengths.

"They are a really good blocking team,"
said head coach John Kosty. "They've been
putting up really good numbers. Historically,
they've always had great blocking and de
fense, and this team is no different. It should
be interesting because both [Stanford and
BYU] have been playing really well in the sec
ond half of the season, so we know we're in for
a tough test."
"It will be one of the toughest matchups we
have all season." Ellis said. "Both teams are
lighting for position in the M PSF playoffs, and
BYU has extra incentive because they're host
ing the NCAA championships this year."

series between the Card and
Cougars could determine who re
ceives the fourth spot in the MPSF
tournament, and therefore who will
host the first-round match.
"All year, our main thing is to get
in the playoffs." Romero said. "Now
that we are in. it would be huge to
host a first-round match. The fans at
home give us lots of adrenaline, and
playing at home would be very ben
eficial to us."
The fight for home-court advan
tage in the first round of the playoffs
will be heated, as both teams have
much more success at home than on
the road. In MPSF play. Stanford is
6-1 at home, but 6-5 on the road,and
BYU is 8-2 at home but 3-5 on the

road. Therefore, the winner of this
weekend's series will have a much
better chance at advancing in the
M PSF playoffs.
In order to set itself up for success
m the MPSF playoffs and possibly
the NCAA playoffs, the Cardinal
knows it must keep progressing.
"Our side-out game needs to
keep getting better, and our block
and defense need to keep improving
also," Kosty said. "They're all good
now. but we have to keep improving
them. No team can achieve a perfect
game, but we have to get as close as
we can."
Stanford will attempt to reach
this level in its two matches against
BYIJ this weekend. The Cardinal
will face the Cougars tomorrow and
Saturday, with both matches begin
ning at 7 p.m. in Maples Pavilion.
