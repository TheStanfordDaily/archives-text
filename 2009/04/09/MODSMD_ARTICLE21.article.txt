13.55 would have destroyed his own
school record, 13.78 seconds, and been
a regional standard, hut the wind was
over the allowable amount. Despite his
impressive time, Bradley still looked to

"My race had many aspects that
were technically poor, so I have confi
dence that once I fix the problems, I
will be able to run these times and
faster later in the season," Bradley
wrote.
Also with a strong finish in a hur
