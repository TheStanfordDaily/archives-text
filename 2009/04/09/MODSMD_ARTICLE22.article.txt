# FRESHMAN PHENOM
## BY JACOB JAFFE DESK EDITOR

It only takes a simple You Tube search to see the amazing talent of
Erik Shoji.Or you couldjust turn on Sports Center, which ranked
his absurd kick assist as the second-best performance of the day
on its Top-10 Plays segment earlier this week. If you want to see
his true abilities, though, the only place to be is courtside at a Stanford
men's volleyball match.
Standing at a mere six feet, with a soft voice and a friendly grin,
freshman libero Shoji does not look like an imposing force or a future
All-American.That is. until he steps onto a volleyball court.
Shoji grew up in 1 lawaii and was raised in an athletic family. I lis sis
ter ("obey works for the Stanford women's volleyball team and his
brother Kawika is an Ail-American setter as a junior for the Cardinal.
I lis mother. Mary Shoji, played basketball in high school and current
ly coaches high school volleyball, while his father, Dave Shoji, has
coached the University of Hawaii's women's volleyball team for over
30 years. This background helped Eirik become interested in volley
ball.
"Because my dad is a coach. I was exposed to volleyball since the
day I was born," Shoji said. "Fiver since I can remember. I was always
going to practices and games, and because of this I fell in love with the
game."
In high school, Shoji led his Punahou High School team to three
straight state championships in one of the most talented states lor vol
leyball. Hawaii. During this stretch, Shoji was twice named an All
American, and was a first-team all-state performer all four years. 1 le
also won a state title in tennis and was also twice named All-State for
tennis.
Apart from high school sports, Shoji played on the U.S. youth na
tional team for volleyball, winning awards as the best libero and de
fender in the world.
"Competing against some of the best competition in the U.S. and
throughout the world in my age group helped give me some great ex
perience," he said.
Shoji brought that experience to the college level, following Kawi
ka to Stanford.
"The opportunity to be playing volleyball at a school with such
prestige in both athletics and academics made me choose Stanford."
I rik said. "It's good to know that when volleyball ends. I will have a
Stanford education to go back on."
Since his arrival at Stanford. Shoji
has stood out for more than his dif
ferently colored shirt. Point after
point, he constantly dives all over the
court with no regard for his hodv. He
uses all parts of his body to keep the
play alive, even if that means sliding
his hand under a potential kill or
kicking the ball crosscourt for an as
sist.
"I think my role on
the team is to be
one of the calm guys
on the court."
ERIK SHOJI,
freshman libero
Being a libero. there are few sta
tistics to truly capture Shoji's
achievements. The one standard for
liberos. though, is the dig. and no
body is better than Shoji. As only a
freshman, he leads the nation in digs
with 377. which is nearly 25 percent
more than anyone else in the coun
try.
This achievement is even more
remarkable considering its historical
relevance. With just three more digs.
Shoji will pass three-time Olympian
Scott Fortune's Stanford single-sea
son record of 379 digs. This record
will likely be broken in the first or
second set against liYU. and based
on his current pace. Shoji should de
molish Fortune's record.
Despite his record-setting num
bers. Shoji still focuses on the team's
success first.
"Obviously, our No. 1 goal is to
win a national championship, but we
have smaller goals that can help lead
to that final goal." he said." I am hop
ing that we can win an MPSF Cham

pionship and play in the Final Four."
Led by Erik and Kawika Shoji,
the Stanford men's volleyball team is
currently ranked No. 5 in the nation
and has won 11 of its last 12 matches.
With few seniors receiving much
playing time, the Cardinal figures to
get even better in years to come, so
Shoji's hopes of a Final Four have a
legitimate chance.The success of the
team for the next few years could
rest on Shoji's shoulders, but he
doesn't overvalue his job on the
team.

"I think my role on the team is to
be one of the calm guys on
court,"he said. "There are times
when I can get really excited, but for
the most part, I try to stay calm and
in control to hopefully try and keep
everyone calm."
If Erik Shoji keeps making the
plays he has been making, though, it
could be hard for anyone to stay
calm.
