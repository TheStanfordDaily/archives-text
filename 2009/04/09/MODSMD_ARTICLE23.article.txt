# Card finds a second life
## 
### 
Baseball is finally here! Stan
lord baseball, that is. Sure
they started their season way
back in February, and it is al
ready getting close to the halfway
point, but the team that was widely
expected to make another postseason
run didn't show up until recently.
The Cardinal won just four of its
first 14 games and lost six straight at
one point. Many people, including
myself, were beginning to believe that
just too much talent had been lost
from last year's College World Series
team to have any chance at a repeat
run to Omaha. But then they woke up.
The Card, which hosts UCLA at
5:30 this afternoon, has won seven of
its last nine and has nearly reached
the .500 mark for the first time since
Feb. 27. Another solid series with the
Bruins this weekend, and they could
even climb as high as third in the con
ference.
It isn't possible to pinpoint one
thing that sparked the turnaround.
Iliis team has simply played better in
every facet of the game over the last
two weeks. The pitching has been
much more consistent than it was in
the opening month, and the offense is
finally producing runs with reliability.
Consider this: in the 11 games
played before the break for winter
quarter finals, Stanford managed
double-digit hits just twice. In the 12
games since, they have done it six
times.The power has improved great
ly as well — seven home runs in II
games before the break, Ifi in 12
games after The result was an in
crease from just under 4.1 runs per
game before the break to 6.5 since.
Combine that jump in scoring with
the pitching staff's ability to cut its
runs allowed per game from 5.9 to just
under 4.2 over the same period.and it
is pretty easy to understand why Stan
ford is suddenly winning consistently.
And just at the right time, too. Hie
next two series are hugely important
for this team and could determine
how the final weeks of the season will
go-
Since the break, Stanford hasn't
really played much of anybody
('al. Washington and Oregon are all
among the bottom four of the Pac-10
so far, and only Cal is currently above
.500, and just by one game. But
IJC IA is tied with Stanford for fourth
in the conference and next week's op
ponent. Arizona State, is 23-6 and
ranked in the top-five in two of the
three major polls.
If the ( ard can take four or five of
the six contests against those two
teams — which will be very difficult,
especially with the ASH series being
played in Tempe —it will find itself
solidly in the top-three of the confer
ence, something unthinkable the way
Stanford was playing just a few weeks
ago. II it drops four or five of them, the
Card will slide back toward the bot
tom half of the conference standings
and remain below the S(H) line for a
few weeks longer.
Either way. Stanford will have to
plav strong baseball over the final
month to give itself a decent chance at
the postseason. After the ASU trip. 16
of the Cardinal's remaining 24 games
are at Sunken Diamond, and it will
have to improve on the 6-6 home
record it has amassed so far.

The Inside Pitch
But the next two weeks are a gold
en opportunity not only to climb out
of the hole Stanford dug itself at the
start of the year, but to surge out of it
and establish itself in the thick of
things in the Pac-10.
For now. the season is saved. Lets
see what these guys can do with it.

Erik Adams would feel even better
about Stanford's chances if Ryan
Garko and Carlos Quentin were still
