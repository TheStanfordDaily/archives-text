## Study shows expansion OK University growth in next 25 years won't affect foothills 
### ELIZABETH TITUS 
The Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors ap
proved the Stanford Sustainable Development Study, a
plan that outlines how the University will accommodate
growth until 2035, at its Tuesday meeting.
The 3-2 vote included a finding by the board: that even
at an "aggressive" growth rate, in which the University
adds five million square feet of academic and housing fa
cilities by 2035, development would not need to extend to
the foothills, which are some 2,000 acres of land between
Alpine Road and Junipero Serra Boulevard owned by
Stanford.
"We are pleased with the outcome." Provost John
I tcheincndy wrote in an email to The Daily. I le added that
the University has no plans to develop the foothills.
"But all University lands are important University as
sets." he continued. "Twenty-five years before the radio
telescope was built, the University could not have fore
seen the need for this instrument, and 25 years before the
linear accelerator was built, the University could not have
foreseen its importance, either."
Yesterday's vote clears the way for further develop
ment. Ihe approval comes as Stanford approaches the
halfway mark in development authorized by the county in
its 2000 (ieneral Use Permit. I he permit stipulated that
before Stanford could apply for the second half of devel
opment two million square feet of academic space and
3,000 housing units, in total a sustiiinability study had to
be completed.
