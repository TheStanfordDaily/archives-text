## Study shows expansion OK University growth in next 25 years won't affect foothills 
### ELIZABETH TITUS 
The Santa Clara County Board of Supervisors ap
proved the Stanford Sustainable Development Study, a
plan that outlines how the University will accommodate
growth until 2035, at its Tuesday meeting.
The 3-2 vote included a finding by the board: that even
at an "aggressive" growth rate, in which the University
adds five million square feet of academic and housing fa
cilities by 2035, development would not need to extend to
the foothills, which are some 2,000 acres of land between
Alpine Road and Junipero Serra Boulevard owned by
Stanford.
"We are pleased with the outcome." Provost John
I tcheincndy wrote in an email to The Daily. I le added that
the University has no plans to develop the foothills.
"But all University lands are important University as
sets." he continued. "Twenty-five years before the radio
telescope was built, the University could not have fore
seen the need for this instrument, and 25 years before the
linear accelerator was built, the University could not have
foreseen its importance, either."
Yesterday's vote clears the way for further develop
ment. Ihe approval comes as Stanford approaches the
halfway mark in development authorized by the county in
its 2000 (ieneral Use Permit. I he permit stipulated that
before Stanford could apply for the second half of devel
opment two million square feet of academic space and
3,000 housing units, in total a sustiiinability study had to
be completed.
The purpose of the study was to
examine future urban growth, pro
tect natural resources and evaluate
potential foothills development, said
the county.
Board of Supervisors President
Liz Kniss made the motion to
approve the study, saying she added
the foothills findings so that future
boards would see it on record.
"The maximum buildout could be
accomplished on the core campus,
which is what I was looking for, and
they acknowledged that that could
be done." Kniss told The Daily.
"The reason for me is that if you
can keep everything within the core
campus, it really does lessen the car
bon footprint." she added. "It makes
everything easier, transportation eas
ier. Ihe Marguerite, bv car — every
thing is going to be shorter."
Kniss said that the University is
not bound to adhere to the growth
scenarios in the study, explaining
how "it doesn't mean they're
obliged."
The county's Department of
Planning and Development noted in
a memo that the board's approval of
the study does not imply approval of
the amount or location of growth
described in the study.
The study faced criticism by sev
eral groups, however, prior to yester
day's vote.
Brian Schmidt JD'99. a legislative
advocate for the Committee for
Green Foothills, said that he would
have liked Stanford to make a "per
manent or 99-year commitment" to
not develop the foothills. I le said the
study lacked coherence.
"Right now. it's an incoherent
jumble of various, very good things,
but its not in and of itself a coherent
analysis of whether Stanford is sus
tainable." he said. "There are no con
clusions. I think it's intellectually not
very rigorous."
The C "ity of Palo Alto told the
board in February that the study
should extend to 2050 and that a def
inition of sustainabilitv should be
included.
The County of San Mateo also
told the board a longer time horizon
should have been used and that they
would be curious to know whether
University expansion might reach
beyond the Academic Growth
Boundary, which surrounds central
campus from Junipero Serra
Boulevard northeast to I I (amino
Real, separating it from the foothills.
" Ihe (San Mateo County| Board
is also curious to know whether this
longer planning timeframe would
reveal the potential for growth
beyond the Academic Growth
Boundary," wrote the Santa Clara
County Board of Supervisors in a
Feb. 12 letter.
Ihe study said that beyond 2035.
analysis becomes less meaningful.
"While it might be possible to
project growth rates over 50 years.
1(H) years or longer, the assumptions
about the likelihood of a particular
growth rate and how that growth

might be accommodated, grow more
speculative over lime." the study
notes.
Supervisor Don Gage voted not
to approve the study, citing what he
called "llth-hour" findings and rec
ommendations by Supervisor Kniss.
""You don't have an opportunity
It) analyze the impacts," he said. "To
not understand what to do when you
vote is not something I'm willing to
do."
Stanford Director of Community
Relations Jean McCown explained
the limitations that any foothills
development would face.
"The Academic Growth
Boundary in the GIJP protects the
foothills until at least 2025."' she
wrote in an email to The Daily. "Also,
the zoning designation for the
foothills allows only extremely limit
ed buildings — no more than IS,(HH)
square feet in almost 1.8(H) acres."
Supervisor Dave Cortese, who
voted to approve the study, said the
foothills' value is difficult to quantify
and that he would not support any
development plans there.
The foothills have "the highest
value when it comes to quality of life
for the citizens of the county, and 1
think that's the overriding rationale

" We are
pleased
with the
outcome."
for conversation," he said.
" Ihere's a commitment right now,
and I think it will continue among
elected officials, to make sure that
growth doesn't continue unchecked
in a horizontal fashion," he said.
Schmidt said the foothills are also
"several thousand acres of important
space" for sensitive species.
The California red-legged frog,
the California tiger salamander, the
western pond turtle and steelhead
trout are found in the foothills,
according to Charles Carter.
Stanford's director of Land Use and

Environmental Planning. The frog is
listed as threatened under the
Endangered Species Act. as is the
salamander.
Students for a Sustainable
Stanford co-President John Mulrow
"09 said the group did not take action
on the study, though it was asked
about it.
"We were contacted by
Committee for Green Foothills —
they are resisting approval," Mulrow
wrote in an email to Ihe Daily.
"However, our advice from both
Fahmida Ahmed (sustainable pro
grams coordinator) and Pam Matson
(dean of the School of Earth
Sciences) has been in strong support
of the study."
Mulrow cited "lack of expertise
on the study, as well as our massive
plans around Earth Day [Apr.22]"as
reasons why SSS did not get
involved.
