# MIDSEASON SURGE
## Card looks to continue turnaround against UCLA 
### DENIS GRIFFIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
I he good news for Stanford baseball
is that the team finally looks like it's
ready to prove itself once again as one of
the nation's most elite programs. And
this comes not a moment too soon.
Beginning this afternoon at 5:30 p.m.,
the Cardinal (11-12; 5-4 Pac-10 Confer
ence) will resume its run through the
heart of its schedule. Since returning to
action after a break for exams on March
21, Stanford has played 12 games in IS
days, and was scheduled to play its 13th
on Tuesday, which was cancelled due to
rain. Before the end of its regular season
on May 24. the Cardinal will play 31
more, including 20 against Pac-10 Con
ference opponents, starting tonight in the
first of a three-game series against
UCLA.
"We're excited for sure," said sopho

more second baseman Colin Walsh. "As
[Coach Mark Marquess] told us. we're
still a week away from getting halfway
through our season, and baseball's a long
season, so a lot can happen. A lot of good
things can happen, a lot of bad things can
happen, so we've just'got to stay focused
on what's coming up. get a couple of wins
this weekend."
Adding to the Cardinal's optimism,
though, is the fact that the team is coming
off a tremendous run to right itself mid
way th rough i t s season. A ft e r going 3-9 to
start the year. Marquess' squad has gone
8-3 since, with an average run differential
of plus-29 over that 11 -game span.
Walsh found it hard to qualify exactly
what had changed, saying that now the
team was playing as well as he thought it
could all along.
"We've just been playing better over
all." he said. "I don't know that I can
point to a specific point in time or some

thing that we're focusing on more. We al
ways were a good team talent-wise; we
just didn't play up to our talent in the first
couple of weeks of the season. So now I
think we're coming together and just
playing better overall."
The Bruins (12-17.5-4) certainly hope
that they are in the midst of a similar
turnaround. From Feb. 22 through March
(S. UCLA lost 10 straight games, before
righting the ship just in time for the start
of conference play. Still, the Bruins are
just 2-3 thus far in April.
The Bruins will look to come after the
Cardinal with a talented rotation, led hv
right-handed Gerrit Cole. The hard
throwing freshman made headlines be
fore his collegiate career even began,
when he decided to play at UCLA de
spite being drafted by the New York Yan
kees in last June's MLB Draft. The 2Sth
