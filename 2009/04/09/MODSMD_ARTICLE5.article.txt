Beginning today. No. 2 Stanford soft
ball will take on No. 1 17 Cal at Smith
l amily Stadium in Palo Alto. After one
game at Stanford, the teams v\ill then trav
el north to conclude their three-game sc
ries at Berkeley on I ridav and Saturday.
The Cardinal (34-2,5-1 Pacific-10 ( (in
ference) boasts a five-game win streak
after upending the Oregon schools in
three games this past weekend. Stanford's
, ( »44 winning percentage is among the best
in the country, trailing only Florida (39-3)
in the national rankings.
The Bears (2(vl I. 3-3). meanwhile, are
led bv twin sisters Jamia and Ilia Rcid. I lie
freshmen are Nos. I and 2 in batting aver
age on the team, and have combined for 54
stolen bases on the year. I ielp conies from
sophomore Sanoe Ketakuna. who has

eight home runs with 2ft runs batted in this
season.
Among the biggest threats the ( ardinal
will faee is Cat's speed — the Bears are
110-122 in stealing this year.
Stanford head coach John Rittman ac
knowledged Cal's aggressive nature on the
b;ise paths.
"We know they have outstanding
speed." Rittman noted. "The biggest thing
we can do to prevent that is to keep them
off the bases."
To do so. Stanford will look to its circle,
where senior ace Missy Penna (24-2) flirt
ed with perfection on Saturday. She gave
up |list one hit. blanking the Ducks to pick
up her 23rd victory o! the season. With the
decision. Penna moved into the top-30 on
the nation's all-time wins list. I"he ace
threw a complete weekend, surrendering
just two earned runs in Oregon, lowering
tier I RA to 0.74 on the vcar.

The tandem of Penna and sophomore
Hurler Ashley C'hinn holds a combined
ERA of 0.91. One of only four sub-one
staff 1 RAs in the nation, the mark also
sets Stanford OYI pace to best the previous
team record of 1.20 set in 2001.
ITie Bears have two options to counter
Penna and C'hinn s expertise. An All Pae
-10 Second Team selection as a freshman,
sophomore Valerie Arioto has picked up
where she left off last season ITie Pleasan
ton. Calif -native is 10-3 on the season,
holding a 1.49 I RA. On the other hand,
junior Marissa Drew rev boasts ,i record of
16-8, with 17| strikeouts in innings
pitched. Drew rev also shut down the C ar
dinal on April 20 last year, fanning 10 to
help her team pull off the I <) win.
C'al finds support for its talent in head
coach Diane Ninemire. who provides
longevity at the helm of the program. In
her 22nd season with the Bears, Nine
mire was inducted into the NI C A I {all of
Fame earlier this year. She presided over
the team from 1999-2005. when Cal reg
istered seven consecutive Women's Col
lege World ("up appearances.
I lowever. Stanford is far from intimi
dated by the arrival of the Bears, and the
team looks to pick up where it left off last
weekend. In a clean sweep of the ()regon
schools, the Cardinal received produc
tion throughout the lineup. Stanford bats
produced 2K hits over the three-game
weekend series. Junior catcher Rosey
Neill belted home runs Nos. 7 and K on
the year, while senior Maddy Coon
added five hits over the weekend to help
out her team.
Stanford's 34-2 record makes the
Card well-poised to improve upon its 20-
29 lifetime record against the Bears, but
the team does anything but take the ri
valry lightly.
"In this conference, teams are bring
ing their A-game every day." Rittman
said.

Thursday, with the first pitch scheduled
for 7 p.m. The series moves to Berkeley
