## STUDENT GOV'T A 						LOOK AT THE ASSU EXECUTIVE PLATFORMS 
### MARISA LANDICHO ZOE RICHARDS 
Sustainability, public service,
diversity and wellness — the buzz
words of the previous ASSU admin
istration — have dominated the race
for 2009 Executive. The two slates
embrace many of the same key
goals, though the ease at which to
achieve these ends varies.
The two slates' platforms differ in
detail and methods of goal imple
mentation. But with comparable
platform headings, overlaps
between the David Gobaud '08 M.S.
'10 and Jay de la Torre '10 slate and
the slate of Bennett Hauser TO and
Matt Sprague TO are nearly
unavoidable.
The greatest point of agreement
lies in the area of outreach to gradu
ate students — a population that has
expressed feelings of marginaliza
tion and disconnection from main
stream ASSU politics in recent
years. More than 8,000 of the
University's 15,000 students are
graduate students, though voter
turnout has been historically lower
for grads than undergrads.
Support for faculty and graduate
diversity has also been written into
both platforms, along with advocacy

pledges for low-cost graduate hous
ing and affordable healthcare for
grads.
Referencing one of the primary
concerns of undergraduate student
life, the two slates remain commit
ted to party regulation reform and
the negotiation of the "2.5 Level"
party — an intermediate level
between an invite-only and a cam
pus-wide party.
"This is an idea that has been in
formulation in our office for quite
awhile under the guidance of Snehal
Naik (associate director) and
Robert Watkins (one of the office's
student peer advisors) working in
conjunction with Jake .Fuentes, for
mer president of Sigma Nu," wrote
Director of the Office of Student
Activities Nanci Howe. "Yes, some
type of new party level is possible
and probably desirable, but we
would need to see more specifics of
their proposal."
Presidential hopefuls Gobaud
and Mauser also share key experi
ence — both served in the previous
Executive cabinet of Jonny Dorsey
'09 and Fagan Harris '09. In the past
year. Gobaud worked as ASSU
Executive Operations Manager,
while Hauser held the title of ASSU
Executive Cabinet Cost of Living

co-Chair.
Several pet projects of the
Dorsey-Harris administration will
be continued regardless of which
slate gains office.
Their best tools for increasing
student involvement, both slates
have explained, are the town halls
meetings. Although the slates plan
to diversify the geographic locations
of the town halls, only the
Gobaud/de la Torre slate proposed
posting videos of the town halls on
You Tube.
Both slates admire the Bystander
campaign, wanting to see it integrat
ed into New Student Orientation
(NSO) programming. They have
both stated wishes to expand the
Green store to sell more than just
biodegradable cups.
Director of Unions Jeanette
Smith-Laws confirmed that the
Llniversity is already making strides
in sustainability mentioned in the
Gobaud/de la Torre platform.
Smith-Laws noted that the move
ment towards zero percent waste
Tresidder and Old Union has been
underway since the beginning of this
academic year.
"But 1 don't know if that's
obtainable within the year," she said
in regards to the timeline.

More innocuous goals round out
the resemblance between platforms,
including the expansion of the
ASSU table-loaning program and
an increase in Wi-Fi access.
The extensiveness of each plat
form. however, begs the question of
how everything will actually be
accomplished post-elections season.
Addressing diversity, the Hauser-
Sprague slate supports the expan
sion of financial aid at a time when
the Llniversity is barely holding on
to its existing program. The pair sup
ports aid to undocumented students
and international need-blind admis
sions.
For similar budgetary reasons,
the Hauser-Sprague platform goal
to raise Peer Health Educator
(PHE) pay faces unfortunate timing.
Still, Director of Wellness and
Health Promotion Services Carole
Pertofsky appreciated the idea of a
pay raise and remains hopeful for
the future.
"I'm an optimist,"she wrote in an
email to The Daily. "Once the econ
omy recovers, I think this well
earned promise for the PHEs will be
quite workable."
Budget problems may also limit
Gobaud's vision of dependent
healthcare for grad students.

Gobaud described the complexity of
healthcare, especially for interna
tional students who, even if married,
cannot get their children or spouse
covered by the same healthcare
plan.
"Because of the budget cuts —
it's a very complicated issue, it's
expensive and needs to be worked
on at the Executive level and not
just the GSC [Graduate Student
Council]," he explained.
In an email to The Daily. GSC co-
Chair Polina Segalova said. "The
GSC has worked with both I lousing
and Health Services in previous
years, with one outcome being the
formation of the Dependent Health
Insurance Task Force."
The task force would be charged
with finding solutions for the prob
lem, she said. The formation of this
Task Force is an initiative that
Gobaud intends to harness as he
tackles these federal level problems.
Some goals, however, face obsta
cles other than money.
To continue Dorsey and Harris"
public service crusade, Hauser and
Sprague propose incorporating
service projects within the freshman
dorm experience.
But freshman dorms, packed with
"heavy programming," may have

too many bases to cover already,
wrote Branner Resident Fellow
Nancy Buffington in an email to The
Daily.
"Students and staff are already
pretty busy," she said. "But a fresh
man dorm with a supportive dorm
staff and RFs could definitely exper
iment to see what they might accom
plish."
Gobaud and de la Torre have also
vowed to lobby for immigration
reform at the federal levej. working
alongside the Bechtel International
Center, the GSC and the National
Association of Graduate
Professional Students (NAGPS) to
make visas more accessible and
make international travel an easier
process for students. Gobaud is
adamant about sending students as
far as Washington. D.C. to advocate
for extending healthcare programs
to international students.
"We recognize this is not a trivial
problem or something that can be
fixed overnight," Gobaud said. "But
it is something that we will work
towards with multiple organiza
tions,"

"Students and staff are already
pretty busy," she said. "But a fresh
man dorm with a supportive dorm
staff and RFs could definitely exper
iment to see what they might accom
plish."
Gobaud and de la Torre have also
vowed to lobby for immigration
reform at the federal levej. working
alongside the Bechtel International
Center, the GSC and the National
Association of Graduate
Professional Students (NAGPS) to
make visas more accessible and
make international travel an easier
process for students. Gobaud is
adamant about sending students as
far as Washington. D.C. to advocate
for extending healthcare programs
to international students.
"We recognize this is not a trivial
problem or something that can be
fixed overnight," Gobaud said. "But
it is something that we will work
towards with multiple organiza
tions,"
