# STUDENT GOV'T
## Late endorsements create online stir Emails sent just hours before voting began 
### NIKHIL JOSHI MANAGING EDITOR 
In the hours before voting began
at 12:01 a.m. Thursday, a Hurry of
endorsements by key outgoing
ASSU officeholders and student
groups hit students around campus,
and could shake up the Executive
and Undergraduate Senate races.
Current Executives Jonny
Dorsey '09 and Fagan Harris '09
publiciy endorsed David Ciobaud
"08 M.S. "10 and Jay de la Torre '10.
Dorsey and Harris said they
spent considerable time deliberat
ing before endorsing Gobaud/de la
Torre, and even took the time to
personally meet with Bennett
Hauser '10 and Matt Sprague '10
earlier in the day yesterday to let
them know about the endorsement.
But Hauser and Sprague went on
to circulate an email across campus,
making it clear that they were dis
appointed with Dorsey and Harris'
actions.
"For the past few weeks, it's been
clear that Jonny Dorsey and Fagan
Harris, the current Executives, have
been pushing behind the scenes for
Gobaud/de la Torre," Hauser and
Sprague wrote. "Jonny and de la
Torre are in Sigma Nu together, and
Gobaud has been an ardent sup
porter of all Dorsey/Harris initia
tives this entire year."
Harris told The Daily that he
does not agree with Hauser and
Sprague's characterization of his
endorsement.
"Bennett is our cost of living
chair. Matt is director of Capital
Group," Harris said. "They are all
employees of us. I don't think an
argument ground in nepotism holds

a whole lot of water."
In their email, Mauser and
Sprague expressed disappointment
that Dorsey and Harris were the
first sitting Executives "in any mem
ory" to endorse one of their poten

But Dorsey told The Daily that
he doubted that history, and in any
case was not going to he guided by
past precedent.
"Like a lot of like other aspects
of ASSU, I would not look to recent
history as to how to do our jobs." he
said.
In another controversial move,
Stanford Democrats President
Ashwin Mudalair '09 and Stanford
Conservative Society President
Grant Starrett '09 issued a widely
circulated joint endorsement of
Hauser and Sprague.
Mudalair, the Stanford
Democrats president, came under
fire for his endorsement of
Hauser/Sprague, because the
Stanford Democrats had already
issued a public endorsement of
Gobaud/de la Torre.
"I personally support Matt and
Bennett, and I wanted to get that
out to their supporters." Mudalair
told The Daily. "It was supposed to
go to the private email list. There
was a miscommunication."
In a statement, five members of
the Stanford Democrats Board
Patrick Cordova '09, Sarahi
Constantine '11, Andy Parker '11,
Caitlin Smith '09, Sam Kaspick '10
â€” made it clear that Mudalair's
endorsement does not reflect the
views of their organization.
"Ashwin Mudaliar, the current
president of the Stanford
Democrats, has separately decided
to endorse the Hauser/Sprague
slate," the group wrote. "Ashwin's
endorsement is an individual deci
