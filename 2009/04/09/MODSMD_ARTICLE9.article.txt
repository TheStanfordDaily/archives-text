## GSC hosts ASSU Exec slates Graduate students seek greater presence within ASSU 
### DANIEL BUI STAFF WRITER 
Last night, the Graduate Student Council
(GSC) reviewed the recent changes to costs in
student healthcare announced by the University.
Council members also met with the
Hauser/Sprague and Gobaud/de la Torre execu
tive slates to discuss their campaigns and policies
with regards to the graduate student population.
Delegates first discussed the Campus Health
Service Fee announced by the University. As
reported in Wednesday's Daily, the fee would
require all students enrolled on the main campus
to pay $lb7 each quarter for services at Vaden
Health Center, regardless of their health insur
ance.
While the council remained aware of the eco
nomic downturn that has affected a number of
student resources across the University, many
members were incensed at the notion of pushing
off costs of health services onto the students.
"Every time they offer us new health services,
they just charge us more for it." objected Ryan
Peacock, a third-year graduate student in chemi
cal engineering. "That's not really a way for the
University to help us out."
In a unique year, with the potential for gradu
ate student representation in the ASSIJ
Executive, the GSC also invited the
I lauscr/Sprague and Gobaud/de la Torre slates to
speak about their policies and platforms in rela
tion to the graduate student population.
Moth campaigns placed a strong emphasis on
equalizing representation between graduates and
undergraduates in the ASSI J, a student organi/a

tion that has long been run primarily by the
undergraduate population.
David Gobaud'oB M.S. '10 and Jay de la Torre
'10 both plan on tackling a number of graduate
student issues that include rising costs for gradu
ate housing, affordable healthcare, resources for
student mental health and creating more social
events for graduate students.
"[WeJ want to
work with the
graduate student
population..."
— DAVID GOBAUD,
ASSU Exec candidate
"The ASSIJ Executive has money and access
to top administration, and we need equal repre
sentation among both graduate and undergradu
ate students," (iobaud said. "These are issues that
require more unique programs and integration
than what is currently offered for undergraduates.
We're definitely going to work closely with the
(iSC, and we also want to work with the graduate

student population in general."
Matthew Sprague '10 admitted that he, as an
undergraduate, could not personally represent
the needs of the graduate student population, hut
also emphasized the importance of equal repre
sentation. In order to achieve this balance,
Hauser/Sprague will nominate graduate students
into appropriate ASSIJ positions that hest serve
the graduate community.
"Bennett [Hauser'lO] and I intend on having
multiple members of our cabinet to be graduate
students for both equal representation and for
their experience." Sprague said.
Both campaigns agreed that their slates would
place a priority on improving the coordination
between the ASSIJ Senate, the ASSI! Executive
and the CiSC in order to minimize the conflicts
between each of these bodies seen in previous
years.
The CiSC" challenged both campaigns with a
question regarding the Campus Health Service
Fee. In his response, Sprague emphasized the
importance of speaking with the administration
to determine the reason for the new costs before
taking action.
On this point. Gobaud agreed, and added his
disgust over the University's actions without ask
ing for student input. He also noted the lack of
financial aid for graduate students, who generally
receive much more aid than undergraduates.
