## Intermission looks ahead at this summer's biggest blockbusters 
### 
I LOVE THE SUMMER. Besides not having to take classes, I like that Hollywood always rolls out its big guns
by way of blockbusters. Granted, during this time period we don't really see too much of the artsy, independ
ent type of films, but hey, that's what Oscar season is for. Instead, we get movies that privilege high octane
action and special effects above all else — which is precisely what your average movie-goer wants to see when
chomping on a bucket of popcorn in a cool, air-conditioned theater to escape the summer heat.
Thankfully, even though our summers don't officially begin until lune, the summer movie season actually
kicks off in May. So, if you're looking for an incredibly fun distraction come May, we have got you covered with
our official Summer Movie Preview Guide. Below, we at Intermission have selected some notable titles that
should definitely be on your radar. Can anyone say dorm trips to midnight showings?

Star Trek
Director: J J Abrams
Release Date: May 8
I'm not going to lie, my knowledge of the Star Trek universe is very limited, if not non-existent. Not to
say that I never liked the show/franchise; I just never got into it. Throw in the fact that the show made its firsl
debut in the '60s, which could potentially explain why 1 missed that boat... or spaceship, I guess. I know
there are probably a lot of other people in my situation, which makes the soon-to-be-relcased 2009 re-hash,
"Star Trek," all the more exciting. By the looks of the trailers thus far, this movie is looking to be the "Star
Wars" of our generation — an epic, sci-fi Hick complete with damaged and unique characters that go around
saving the universe. It's a tried and true formula that easily works and begs for sequels. The film itself is defi
nitely structured to be only the beginning, as it chronicles the life of the esteemed Captain Kirk before he
became a captain in the Federation. I can already picture the birth of a new generation of "Trekkies" immedi
ately following the release of this film.

Year One
Director: Harold Ramis
Release Date: June 19

Moving away from
the action blockbusters,
another promising film
for the summer is the
stone-aged comedy, "Year
One." Helmed by the likes
of lack Black and awkward
teen sensation Michael

Cera, this comedic pairing

looks to be a match made in

heaven. The film's premise

already promises a bucket-full of

laughter. Set in the year 1, Black and Cera

play a couple of hunter-gatherers in a primitive village. Things take a turn for the
funny when they are both banished from the village, forcing them to embark on a
quest throughout the ancient world. This comedic outing looks to offer a breath of
fresh air in the realm of the comedy — a unique spin on an area of history often
overlooked. If you get tired in the summer of watching nonstop action films, "Year
One" could be your cure-all.

Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen
Director: Michael Hay
Release Date: June 24
Out of all the summer blockbusters mentioned thus far, "Revenge
of the Fallen" is probably one of the most anticipated ones. Sequels
don't get any bigger than blockbuster sequels — just look at other
sophomore films like "X-Mcn 2" or "The Dark Knight" and you will
get my point. In his first iteration, director Michael Bay did the seem
ingly impossible by turning a kid-friendly cartoon show and popular
toy franchise into a monster action flick in "Transformers." The film
did extremely well, grossing over $700 million worldwide in the box
office. Hay hopes to break this record with "Revenge of the Fallen,"
which looks to be even bigger and badder than the first. Picking right
up where the first left off, after being defeated by the Autobots, the
Decepticons are angry and out for vengeance. Megatron is revived and
ready to lead an army of newly recruited Decepticons on a rampage to
destroy all of Earth. Can the Autobots stop this onslaught of revenge?
There is definitely more than what meets the eve here!

Terminator Salvation
Director: McG
Release Date: May 21
The "Terminator" franchise is over two
decades old and was one of the paramount
films that introduced this concept of "Man vs.
Machine." Since its first film inception in 1984,
there have been two other sequels as well as a
Fox television series titled "Terminator: The
Sarah Connor Chronicles." "Terminator
Salvation" finally brings the franchise's story
full circle — focusing on the all-out war
between the surviving humans and the
machines they helped build. John Connor is all
grown up, played by the rising action star
Christian Bale, as he is charged with leading
the fight against the terminators. Where's
Schwarzenegger when you need him?
