# Fall Out Boy and friends prove that punk-pop IS fun
## 
### 
Walking into the arena at San lose State for the Fall
Out Boy "Believers Never Die:
Fart Deux" tour, all 1

could see were Hot Topic-clad,
giddy middle- and high-school
students who could not believe
that they were about to witness
the veritable Mount Olympus of
punk-pop deities. Tonight's lineup

is a dream come true for these
teenagers, and while I may hail from
the Green Day and Blink-182 era, the
excitement was definitely contagious,
and 1 found myself anxiously awaiting
the beginning of the concert.

The lineup for this particular leg of
Fall Out Boy's world tour was impres

sive. The concert opened with newcomer
Hey Monday followed by Cobra Starship, Metro Station and
All Time Low. The stage was relatively big, with a pit for the
die-hards to stand in and a balcony for the parents waiting to
drive their kids home. When I went into the concert — after
missing the opener, Hey Monday — the stage was quickly
being reset for Cobra Starship, with '80s-style graffiti banners
with the phrases "Get Awesome" and "Cobra Starship blasted
colorfully across the stage. When the band came on stage, the
crowd went wild, with many fans in the pit throwing up
stuffed snakes as well as digital cameras in order to document
the experience for their MySpace.
The extent of my Cobra Starship knowledge was very
limited — the only song I've ever heard from them is the
theme from "Snakes on a Plane." (1 have seen that movie way
too many times.) So, 1 was pleasantly surprised to discover
that the songs were catchy and the band incredible perform
ers. About halfway through the set, the lead singer jokingly
quipped, "On our first tour, a few years ago, we opened for
Fall Out Boy. Now, on our last tour for a little while, we are
still opening for Fall Out Hoy!" As they left the stage, the
applause was thunderous, and it was evident that they do

have a strong fan following.
After Cobra Starship per
formed, there was yet

another set changeover
before Metro Station
took the stage. Metro

Station is responsible

for the wildly popular
summer anthem
"Shake It,"and their

set list consisted of
the better songs on
their album, all of

which were fun

and upbeat and had the crowd

iumpinc. Frontman Trace Cyrus (yes, Miley's

brother) was full of charisma, and was definitely the most
vocal and energetic member of the band, flinging himself all
over the stage and never dialing it down or losing steam. It
was fun hearing everybody singing along to their songs, and
the fans definitely helped lift the otherwise weak live vocals
from the two singers. Metro Station received even more
applause than their predecessors, but it was nothing com
pared to when All Time Low came onto the darkened stage.
The appeal of All Time Low was obvious as soon as they
opened their set. The vocals were spot on and the energy so
infectious that one often found himself singing along, even if
he didn't know the words. The four men in the band were all
incredibly attractive, driving the teenage girls into an absolute
frenzy. The set was seamless, and even the parents were sit
ting there bobbing their heads. The screaming from the fans
was so deafening and fervent that it soon became obvious
that All Time Low is the Jonas Brothers equivalent in the
punk-pop world. Expect these guys to come to the forefront
of this genre very soon.
The longest set changeover came after All Time Low
before Fall Out Boy. While all of the previous bands used
huge banners to tell the audience who they were, Fall Out
Boy had the set stripped to some large TV screens and noth-

ing else. The show opened with some footage of the war in
Iraq and other scenes of dissent throughout the world. After
establishing the show to be one with a political message, the
band walked somberly on stage, wearing business suits and
stage makeup depicting violent bruises and bloody noses.
There was none of the excited energy that was obvious in the
other bands — Fall Out boy seemed to want to establish
themselves as the veterans of the lineup, having played too
many concerts to be anything other than mechanical.
However, after a couple songs, the opening riff of their first
hit, "Sugar, We're Going Down," had the audience going
absolutely insane. Lead vocalist Patrick Stump, while relative
ly composed in appearance, was flawless on the microphone.
He sounded exactly like a studio recording, and he more than
delivered what the audience expected. Bassist Pete Wentz
served as the ambassador to the crowd, introducing each
song in some clever manner. When the lights went down for
"This Ain't a Scene (It's an Arms Race)," the stage became a
lot less simple — pyrotechnics and light-up spinning guitars
provided gimmicky appeal to the chants coming from the
audience.
Fall Out Boy is clearly at a career peak, playing a show
that, while a bit mechanical, was technically flawless and
beautifully executed. The guys were an incredible climax for a
show that provided unbridled energy and excitement leading
up to the headliners. Cobra Starship and All Time Low were
both great performers, feeding off the energy of their adoring
fans. Metro Station, while paling in comparison to the others,
played crowd favorites, and with a charismatic frontman, the
weak technical aspects went unnoticed. The "Believers Never
Die: Part Deux" tour may not have made me into an avid
punk-pop fan, but I did find myself immensely enjoying the
underappreciated genre onstage.
