# Spring quarter means... GREEN LIGHT!
## 
### 
Spring Quarter at Stanford is great for sex. We all are more
relaxed and care-free, there are plenty of wild parties to find
that special one night stand, and all the sexual tension that
has built up for your neighbor down the hall finally erupts with
delicious results. On the topic of dorm neighbors, Roxy wants to
share with all of you a juicy little tidbit that she overhead the other
day. While planning my next conquest, I came across some of my
dorm staff talking about an unofficial "traffic light" system that
they use to govern their behavior in the dorm. Simply put, it goes a
little something like this: Fall Quarter is Red Light, Winter Quarter
is Yellow Light, and Spring Quarter is GREEN LIGHT.
Now I'm sure Roxy does not have to spell out what this "light" sys
tem means. When it comes down to it, the only thing you all
should care about is that green means GO — push forward, accel
erate, move faster, don't stop. After hearing my staff talk about this,
you can only imagine where my mind jumped to. I am sure many
of you have had the same fantasy — bedding one of your staff
members, ESPECIALLY your friendly neighborhood RA. Of course
Roxy knows that this definitely happens around campus, but within
freshmen dorms, this is the biggest of scandals. I have heard many
stories of RAs and other staff members losing their jobs because
they were dating the frosh next door, which I think is just plain
silly.
As an upperclassman, even Roxy knows that you should never date
a freshman. Frosh aren't for dating; they are only good for no
strings-attached sex. What better way to get your rocks off than
doing it in the comfort of your own dorm — especially in your
staff single. On the llipside, this "situation" is most ideal for fresh
men as well. Your first year at Stanford shouldn't be spent attaching
yourself to a ball-and-chain, even worse, a lone-distance relation-

ship (Roxy shudders at
the thought). Instead,
your first year should be
all about loose morals
and fun times, and what
better way to live it up thar

to turn to your RA for a couple
of closed-door sessions? In my book,

this is a win-win situation.
But Roxy doesn't want to focus all of her

attention on staff-resident scandals. Spring Quarter Green Light
means that EVERYTHING should be a go. Having pent up feelings
for the guy or girl next door? lust go for it! Better yet, go out and
get drunk with them and see where that leads you. Worried about
telling your roommates that you're gay? Come out of the closet
already! Roxy is down with the rainbow and knows that Stanford is
too. Plus you'll get plenty more action instead of trolling around on
craigslist (Yeah, I just went there).
So what's the moral of the story here? Correction, what's the mes
sage of the story here (Roxy doesn't have morals)? Life is too short,
especially here on the farm. Spring Quarter is your last chance to
do who you want to do before people leave for the summer. And
for all you seniors out there, this is your last chance to sleep around
without having to worry about petty terms like "sexual harass
ment," which I here is a common term in the professional work
place. Happy hunting Stanford, Roxy is going to go and talk to her
RA now.
