# KID CUDI:
## The
						Man on the Moon 
### 
Last month, Kid Cudi announced on his blog
(kidcudi.com/news) that he was officially quit
ting from hip-hop. What? Did Eifel 65
announce they were retiring from dance music after
releasing "Blue (Da Ba Dee)"? Does the average per
son even know who Kid Cudi is? Maybe not, but
everyone can sing his song "Day 'N Night" which is
now No. 7 on the Billboard Charts. Not to mention,
the Crookers remix rose to as high as No. 2 on the
U.K. singles chart. Others in the music industry,
namely Kanye West, don't seem to think the
Cleveland, Ohio-native is one-hit-wonder material.
Kanye recruited Cudi to join his G.0.0.D. music
group and help him with his latest album, "808 sand
I leartbreak." (Cudi was featured on "Paranoid" and
"Welcome to Heartbreak," and he even helped write
"Heartless.") Kanye now posts Kid Cudi material on
his blog almost every day.
Several days after Cudi announced his retire
ment, he stopped the buzz in the music industry by
announcing his un-retirenient at the South by
Southwest concert in Austin, Texas this past month.
Anticipation has been growing tremendously over the
release of Kid Cudi's first album, coming this sum
mer, called "Man on the Moon: The Guardian." Kid
Cudi has launched himself to the top of the music
scene, showing up everywhere from MTV perform
ances to Louis Vuitton launch parties.

What is the appeal of Kid Cudi? Today's under
ground and club music scenes have been shifting to
futuristic, outer-space-sounding production and Kid
Cudi, the "Man on the Moon," has just that. With
production from Dot Da Genius ("Day 'N Nite"),
himself ("Super Boo") and Italian electro Dls ("Day
'N Night" remix), Kid Cudi has achieved the modern
sound that has caught the attention of hip-hop and
dance music fans around the world. Vocally, Cudi is
an incredibly talented rapper that is easy on the ears
but he also likes to sing, a trend we have started to
see in hip-hop with Bone Thugs'N Harmony, contin
uing with Kanye West. Something refreshing about
Kid Cudi is his individuality as an MC: He doesn't try
to be a gangster rapper — instead, he is genuine and
even treats women well! In his song "Pillow Talk,"
Cudi says:
"Don't be sad, I ain't goin' nowhere. Let's just lay
and talk. Girl I know you feel it, this chemistry that
we got. Girl don't be shy, I ain't goin' nowhere. I'm
here for the night."
If genre-transcending, futuristic beats and cre
ative yet real lyrics are something that interest you,
