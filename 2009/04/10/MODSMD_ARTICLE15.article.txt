"Day N Night" the video
There is also a video for the Crookers Remix
but the video for the original is Cudi-endorsed,
unlike the Crookers video The video features
a cross between a normal city suburb and odd
animations, which represent the Lonely Stoner
theme in stunning fashion.
"The Sky Might Fall"
This song is very much "808's and Heartbreak"
style but I think Cudi's vocals sound better
than Kanye's on this one. Cudi re-uploaded
the trailer for Transformers 2 onto Youtube
after adding "The Sky Might Fall" to the back
ground and Dreamworks decided it was a
good idea. The song will be the featured
theme track for next summer's blockbuster hit.
"She Came Along" ft. Sharam
This song was produced by Sharam, an
Electronica/House DJ. If you are a Gnarls
Barkley fan you will like this song.
"I Poke Her Face" ft. Kanye West &
Common
This song was leaked about a week ago and
samples Lady Gaga vocals from "Poker Face."
How could you not download a song with
Cudi, Kanye, and Common?
