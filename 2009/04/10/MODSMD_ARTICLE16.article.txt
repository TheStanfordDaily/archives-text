# David Harrington spins a variety-pack
## 
### 
As I stepped into the CoHo, 10 minutes before the Stanford Arts
Initiative DJ Session, David Harrington, co-founder and violinist of
the Kronos Quartet, fiddled around with a soundboard, cuing the
sound of stringed instruments intertwined with a techno-like bass.
The track, entitled "Tashweesh," was originally arranged by a
Palestinian musical collective known as Ramallah Underground, was per
formed by the Kronos Quartet. Throughout the night, Harrington played .1
list of his favorite songs, which he has compiled for over 35 years.
Much of the music he played was incredibly diverse, ranging from the
revolutionary recordings of an Iranian group called The Plastic Wave to the
mechanical clanging and complex rhythms of a Finnish band, Cleaning
Women. Interestingly, Harrington explained to the audience that the band's
unique sound comes from instruments made out of objects such as a vacu
um. Also after a playlist from Harrington's esoteric compilation of distinc
tive tracks, the upbeat African tune "Avramandole" by Staff Benda Bilili pro
vided a lively contrast to the techno rhythms of Cleaning Women.
Aside from tracks that slightly induced head bobbing, each song that
1 larrington played differed vastly from the previous. The sounds, consisting
of an organ-like instrument and higher pitched notes of an accordion,
evoked melancholic emotions in "Parvi intervallo," a piece by the Estonian
composer Arvo Part.
Originally composed by Stravinsky, Harrington chose a heartfelt piece
performed 011 the theremin by Clara Rockmore (if you have never heard of
a theremin before, I recommend You Tube-ing it). The emotional poignan
cy of the song can also be found in the Greek rendition of "Smyrneiko
Minore" by Marika Papagika. The incorporation of subtle piano chords,
along with Papagika's voice, convey a depressing and mournful tone.
Some of the music that I larrington chose to play was performed by the
Kronos Quartet. Amongst the pieces chosen, he played an unrcleased ver
sion of Damon Albarn's "It Felt I ike a Kiss." Harrington also played the
Kronos Quartet's interpretation of "Flugufrelsarinn," a track performed by
the Icelandic band Sigur Ros.
Commenting on the last track of the night, Harrington said, "I could
write a novel about that note at the end of song. There is so much human
ity and knowledge about the most difficult things in that note."
As Victoria Spivey's "Blue Valley Blues" reverberated throughout the
Col 10, the sentimental impact of the song was reinforced by Spivey's vocals
and aesthetic quality of the song.
As Harrington began to pack up, I spoke with him briefly about his
musical tastes and inspirations. I was also able to gather a list of the music
that he played (if you are curious, you can email me). 1 le explained how the
majority of his music is given to him by various musicians around the
world.
I also asked about his time with the Kronos Quartet and their contri
butions to the "Requiem for a Dream" soundtrack. Speaking fondly of
working with Clint Mansell and Darron Aronofsky, he was greatly satisfied
with how he was able to product- music that was embedded into the psy
chology and timing of the film.
Before parting, we ended our conversation with Harrington speaking
optimistically of musicianship. In a modest yet insightful tone, he told me,
"It's a great time to be a musician, to be a listener and involved in the world
of music. You never know what you're going to hear next just be ready."
