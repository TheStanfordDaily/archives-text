# RESTAURANT REViEW
## Dining bliss at Boulevard 
### 
As we enter spring, it's time to think
about celebrating the conclusion of
another great year on the farm. Palo
Alto may have some nice options to choose
from, but how exciting can a trip to University
Avenue be? A real celebration calls for a trip
to the city, and among the most popular ven
ues for a high end meal is Boulevard.
Even before walking inside, the location
of Boulevard is impressive in itself. Located at
the end of Mission Street by The
Embarcadero, the restaurant offers views of
the Ferry Building to the left and the Bay
Bridge to the right. While the restaurant has
only existed since 1993, the building — which
has its own interesting history — dates back
to before the 1906 earthquake, unlike all of
the other buildings around. After the earth
quake hit, the Army was sent in to raze build
ings throughout the city in an effort to quell
the spread of fire that would certainly cause
even more destruction. Boulevard's building
was at the time occupied by a pub, the owner
of which persuaded the demolition crews to
spare his building in exchange for compli
mentary libations.
While the historic exterior remains, the
interior was completely renovated to make
way for the restaurant styled in the art nou
veau theme of turn-of-the-century Paris.
Several touches including the loeo immediate

ly evoke the style of the original famed
entrances to the Paris Metro.
It would seem that Boulevard's clientele
operate with an East Coast mindset. Even at
9:30, when most California Restaurants might
be shutting down, clientele — some with
reservations — are still waiting for a table.
That wait would most likely take place at the
attractive bar since space was otherwise
extremely limited given the number of tables
that re squeezed in the dining area. Eventually
you could be seated either along the relatively
narrow and heavily trafficked corridor near
the front door — which offers views of the
hardworking kitchen staff — or in the calmer,
roomier back with views of The Embarcadero
and the Bay.
Nancy Oakes' cooking can best be
described in one word: excellent. The New
American menu doesn't have an overwhelm
ing number of choices, but everything sounds
enticing. Perhaps the only constraint was that
the offerings were a little sea food-heavy, but
with choices like calamari stuffed with
Dungeness crab, it's hard to complain. To
make a long story short, this tasted just as
good as it sounds.
Chicken is generally something that is
served far too often and rarely is done well.
There are few things more annoying than a
tasteless and dry piece of grilled chicken

breast. But Boulevard's chicken entree should
not be ignored — a slow roasted free range
chicken from Petaluma, some wrapped
around sausage served over polenta and
topped with truffles. The chicken was slightly
crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and
actually had its own real flavor. Of course,
anything that is good gets better when it is
wrapped around sausage, and the polenta
was made with generous amounts of fine
cheese and was nothing short of amazing.
Overall, it was probably the best chicken dish
I have ever had.
Not surprisingly, the service matches the
quality of the food. It was the kind of service
that is not overly pretentious but is so good
you simply don't even notice it. Even on the
way out, when one server was blocking the
way as he put the order to the kitchen, the
captain immediately noticed the situation and
silently signaled the obstructing waiter to get
out of the way.
Such a dining experience obviously
comes with a hefty price tag with appetizers in
the $15 to $20 range and main entrees mainly
being north of $30. But for a special occasion
in San Francisco, it's a meal that's hard to beat
at any price.
