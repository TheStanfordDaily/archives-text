# Hot or Not? The best Thai in town
## 
### 
The Bay Area is a special place. The
juxtaposition of so many culinary
traditions in such a small region
offers us (and our taste buds) a multi
tude of possibilities. Thai offerings are
particularly a-plenty, as anyone who has
strolled down University Ave can attest.
While 1 am but one man on a mis
sion for good food and a full tummy,
Intermission readers probably wouldn't
appreciate it if I attempted to review all
of the closest Thai restaurants to cam
pus. I'll focus my attention and appetite
on a few eateries, ranging from the casual
to some real black Thai affairs.
On the informal side, Stanford stu
dents can't really beat the Jordan Hall
Thai Cafe, in the basement of Building
420. With cheap eats, such as the BBQ
Chicken Noodle Salad or Chicken Soup,
the Cafe's consistently long lines give vis
itors some idea of the allure of the tastes
to come. I'd recommend deciding what
you want before you get to the counter,
especially as you're certain to have
enough time! Remember that the noodle
salads are cold, except for the warm
sauce. For those of you with peanut aller
gies, stay at Ricker, as this is not a
peanut-free environment.

Understanding that the Thai Cafe is
probably the most convenient eatery for
your Thai fix, try to get off campus for
more variety of your grub. Not far from
campus, you'll find Thaiphoon, a whirl
wind of flavor. Their food's been rated
the best Thai in Palo Alto in 2006 and
2007, according to the Palo Alto Daily
News. I've always come away satisfied in
my many ventures out to the restaurant,
especially with the extensive menu and
convenient location close to Pizza My
Heart on Emerson Street.
A little farther down University Ave,
you'll come across Siam Royal. Favorites
include their interpretations of the
papaya salad, panang salmon and the
mango sticky rice. Siam Royal tends to be
a bit milder than spice fanatics might
want, but the wait staff is nice and help
ful. Also recommended are their fried
bananas, which have a special appeal.
Down Lytton Ave. in Paly, you'll find
Bangkok Cuisine. Hillary Lin '11 raves
about the eateries Pad Sec Ew.
Acknowledging that the portions arc on
the small side, Lin recommends the Pad
See Ew (a flat rice noodle dish with a
choice of meat) as well as the Pineapple
Fried Rice.

Venturing to Mountain View's Castro
Street, Amarin Thai Cuisine is a great
lunch or dinner destination. Lunch is
particularly attractive, as the dishes fall in
the $5-$6 range and are good quality.
However, since it's located about 20 min
utes away from campus, it's not so con
venient for students on the go. If you do
head over, though, definitely try the spicy
prawns.
What's hot and what's not? It's up to
you to explore, I've tried quite a few
places and I can say that I can't pick a
favorite — it's a Thai!
