## Wayne Hwang Introduction to Charity Fashion Show 2009 
### 
Charity Fashion Show is the largest fashion show in the
West Coast. This year, the show will feature over 52
international designers. The line-up ranges from Oscar de
la Renta to three Stanford break-out designers (Wayne
Hwang, profiled here, Monica Miklas, and Karen Lum) and
even two high school designers. There will be just under 50
models for the 30 set show, with 8 to 12 garments per
show. Most of the models are Stanford students, and two
are even high school students.
Charity Fashion Show will take place on May 2 at
Roble Field.
Intermission (i): How did you get into fashion?
Wayne Hwang (WH): My mother was a model. She was a
fashion designer for Donna Karan, so when 1 was 16 years old
she got me into modeling for Donna Karan. 1 went through
their modeling track — Donna Karan only uses their own
models — and since then have done work for some children's
collections and DKNY men. I also learned to style hair and
make jewelry. In my show, all of the jewelry and hair are done
by me. The only things not made by me directly are the
shoes. When I was a freshman at Stanford, 1 did a bit more
modeling, but had to give it up. I started designing clothes
only about a little over a year ago. My mom taught me some
techniques so 1 wasn't just all making it up. Then 1 applied
for a SiCA grant to get the budget to design a couture set.
(i): So what's your upcoming collection like?
WH: Well, yellow is this season's color, so 1 pushed toward
the metallics with gold and royal blue, color-wise. 1 use a lot
of aquatic motifs, a lot of marine-themed shapes, designers
and decor. It's basically a bit like mermaid couture-wear. The
men's clothing is based on a marines and army theme. It's a

lot of structured

suits. My collection last year was a lot simpler; I'd just started,
so it was a lot of draping with easy-to-work-with fabrics such
as stretchy cotton. This year, I'm working on leathers, organ
za, tulle, pleated fabrics — I even wove some freshwater
pearls and crystals into the dresses. So the dresses are heavy,
and they have a lot of padding too, to create the rigid struc
ture for the torso.' It's kind of like a really elaborate corset
that's made from a wash of fabrics.
(i): Where did you get your inspiration for the marine-theme
from?
WH: I was inspired after visiting Kenting in Taiwan. I laid on
the beach a lot there — the water is amazing. While sitting on
the shore, I watched the waves come in, creating sea foams.
So that's the inspiration for the women's collection. As tor the
men's clothing — well, I hate making all women collections.
My cousins have been drafted into the Taiwanese army, so
their army clothes inspired me. Royal blue is one of my
favorite colors too.
(i): Once you've created and showcased your clothes, what's
the next step?
WH:For me personally, most of what 1 make is just highly
couture, which is un-wearable in everyday life. As tor the
other designers, that depends; if they're just donating, then
100 percent of the profits from the sale goes to Doctors

Without Borders. If designers arc sell
• _ _ A.i u ... in

ing through us, then 10 percent
of the profits go to Doctors

Without Borders. So yes,
designers have the option of

donating or selling. Some of

the designers that will be selling are Nanette Leporc,
Tibi, BCBG, Oscar de la Renta and others. The sale is

geared toward students, so the price will range

from $20 to $200 depending on what the

piece of clothing is.
The designers tell us
what they want. But
the prices will be
below retail.
(i): The fashion
industry has by no
means been immune

from the economic downturn. In tact, just rcccntly the Italian
government bailed out many of the top Italian fashion hous
es, including Versace and Dolce & Gabbana. How do you
think fashion will evolve through the recession?
WH: In my opinion, there are two ways the fashion industry
will respond to the economic crisis: the first route is some
will go with the flow, go with the economic times and tone
down everything so the clothes arc more realistic and fashion
is simpler. The second route is to really turn it up, make fash
ion even more extravagant and over-the-top — that way, you
stand out. As for our fashion show, we're getting a bit of both
groups. Also, now is the best time for up-and-coming design
ers to start shining because we don't have to deal with exten
sive fashion lines, a lot of employees, etcetera.
(i): With the four major Fashion Weeks just behind us, what
are your reactions? Favorite city or trend?
WH: I'm biased toward the Mercedes Benz Fashion Week just
because I used to work for it. 1 have to say, though, that Asia's
fashion weeks are really growing — for example, Tokyo,
Beijing and Seoul. They're really starting to have a big pres
ence and have gotten much more extreme, decorative, elabo
rate and glamorous.
(i): What do you think about the fashion community and
knowledge —or actually, the lack thereof— at Stanford?
WH: People at Stanford on average aren't very aware of the
fashion world and industry. The Bay Area's fashion industry
is abysmal — there's almost no groundwork, no solid fashion
groundwork here. So I figured, why don't we start it now?
We're really fortunate to have strong corporate sponsors to
make this happen. I feel like simply just by having a charity
fashion show and using student models makes students more
aware of designers and the world of fashion. After all, it's a
very big industry. They then spread what they know to their
friends. Charity Fashion Show might not give everyone full
knowledge, but at least people become more aware of what
the fashion industry is.
