# Miley Cyrus returns to her roots
## 
### 
Before you all hunt me down for titling this article with
such blasphemous words, 1 will say that when I first
walked into the theater, 1 was completely expecting yet
another Disney train wreck — Lizzie McGuire, I'm looking at
you. You can then imagine my personal surprise when 1 dis
covered that Disney's latest tween franchise movie was actual
ly not half-bad.
If you aren't, like myself, familiar with the franchise,
here's the gist of it. "Hannah Montana" is a popular television
show about a girl named Miley, who is basically similar to a
superhero with a secret identity. But instead of being an actu
al hero, she is a pop star. At home, she lives a normal life, but
when she hits the stage, she throws on a blonde wig and dolls
herself up to become Hannah Montana. The story in the
movie doesn't detract too much from this secret pop star

formula — which isn't actually a bad thing.
The film starts off with Miley loving the
Hannah pop star life, which you can't really
blame her for — who wouldn't want to be a

rich and famous celebrity? However,
after standing up her best friend and
getting into a humorous cat fight

with Tyra Banks, Miley's father (played by her actual dad,
famous country singer Billy Ray Cyrus), decides to give Miley
a big ol' slice of humble pie, and takes her back to her home
town roots in the Tennessee countryside.
Here she engages in your stereotypical southern activi
ties: riding horses, going to barn hoedowns and falling in love
with the cute cowboy next door. Miley quickly rekindles her
love for the simple life, but conflict rears its ugly head when
Miley eventually has to make the decision to keep things sim
ple or keep up her pop star facade. This tension is actually
pretty believable and makes for some touching, albeit cheesy
and predictable, moments.
I really did appreciate the film's overall plot because

besides focusing on Miley's identity crisis, the
movie also places a good amount of attention on
Miley's father and other family members. This

helps to add an extra layer of depth to the film that is
often missing in other similar Disney tween

movies — think "High School Musical," and
Lizzie McGuire, I'm looking at you again.
Of course the story isn't completely perfect

and there were still certain elements that
made me cringe. Hailing from the south
ern state of Texas, I am always amused b>

the public media's perception of the
"South." This was no exception in

" "Hannah Montana," and 1 was amused
although internally horrified, to witness

the film's conception of what happens in the South

According to the movie, everyone in the South spends their
nights singing country songs on the porch with Rascal Flatt

— seriously, they are in the movie. Then, during their barn
yard hoedowns, the likes of Taylor Swift also stroll on by to
sing a song or two. Everyone is happy, gorgeous and carefree
Granted, 1 can see why Disney would choose to glamorize
movie like this, but it's just utterly unbelievable.
Besides this over-hyped lifestyle, the ending of the film

also felt a bit overdone. Technically, what happens is pretty
significant, so I won't spoil it for you. 1 will, however, say that
during this point in the film, it felt like the heartless Disney
Corporation stepped in and set its foot down on how the rest
of the film should play out.
So what do we get when all is said and done? Is "Hannah
Montana" a great film? No. Is it horrible? Surprisingly, no. Its
story and musical elements cast a broad enough appeal to
mildly amuse the general masses, but when it comes down to
it, only the Hannah Montana fans will actually truly enjoy
this film. Now I wonder when the Jonas Brothers are going to
do a movie ...
