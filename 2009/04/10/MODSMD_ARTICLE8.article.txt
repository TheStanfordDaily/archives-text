# AATP recreates Asian-American experience

### 
After being handed a program for the Asian American
Theater Project's "Forgetting Tiburon," 1 had to check
the line "written and directed by" multiple times. The
fact that "Forgetting Tiburon" is written and directed by the
same person is extraordinary.
Karmia Cao did an incredible job creating her vision and
weaving together the rather complicated tapestry of Asian-
American history. Her play is complicated, disjointed from

the start, with several set changes, a stage that shares multiple
plot lines and actors developing on an arch that is anything
but linear. Initially, this lack of structure concerned me, if
only because I was a skeptic. "Could they pull it off?" I won
dered. By the end of the play, I had been proven foolish in my
skepticism a thousand times over.
This play reminds the viewer of the struggles of Asian
Americans during the ugly period that began during the

Gold Rush and haunted America well into the '40s. During
that era of Asian exclusion, paranoid racism drove white
America to imprison people from China, who had been
exploited in earlier periods for their labor. The story follows
such a Chinese family into the current era. Asian stereotypes
and family secrets haunt the stage and the characters; this is
clearly not some simple, perfect Asian family — it's also an
American family, and with all that entails.
This was not a perfect production, but the highlights far
outweigh any flaws that I might have seen. There were some
extraordinary performances on stage. On what is typically
stereotyped as a techie campus lacking in artistic talent, the
actors in "Forgetting Tiburon" challenge that stereotype. Of
particular note is the lead actor who is on stage for the
entirety of this nearly two-hour performance. Luc-Van Victor
Luong invoked the incredible level of emotion experienced
by his character's captivity. Allie Dunworth as Katherine
Mauer also notably performed as an American missionary on
the island. Her performance perfectly projected Cao's wishes
to portray a complicated and compassionate character. There
were some performances that were mediocre, but these were
not bad performances — they got the job done, but were
out-shone by others on stage. Overall, the acting in this play
is on a level that has, at least for me, been unmatched at
Stanford.
The fact that the play is a complicated tale did lead to
some loose ends; this, however, is a minor gripe. Kiren Sen,
played by Prachi Priyam, is a character that I left feeling as if

I couldn't completely understand her develop-1
ment. It's a symptom of Cao's sweeping vision,
but it is one loose end that she could tie up in
the future. This same holds Mario Suntanu's
character, Wolfgang Yoshizawa, in another great
performance that was clouded in a slightly con
fusing plot development.
This was a play that was too big tor its
stage. I losted in the AAAC Ballroom, it would
have benefited from a bigger stage, but given

what the cast was working with, the set maximized its space and held the play together. I look for
ward to seeing more performances like "Forgetting Tiburon" in the future.
