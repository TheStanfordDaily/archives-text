# Ram's Head produces rockin' rendition of "Aida"
## 
### 
M Stanford are often a
mixed bag, but this is not any one person's fault

Stanford's population is small, and we arc definitely not known as a
performing arts school. Student talent can also vary over the years.
However, it seems that this tradition has changed: "Aida," the
Ram's Head Theatrical Society's spring show this year, not only has
a plethora of powerhouse vocal talent, but also combines poetic
details to create an overall memorable experience.
Before diving into the actual musical, it is important to recog
nize that a part of the musical's quality is its source material. "Aida"
is a rock musical based on Giuseppe Verdi's opera of the same
name. The musical was originally produced by Disney Theatrical,
with lyrics by Tim Rice and music by Elton John. The story itself is
based upon a children's story by Linda Woolverton, Robert Falls
and David Henry Hwang. "Aida' made its world premiere Sept. 16,
1998 and was titled "Elaborate Lives: The Legend of Aida. The
Broadway-produced version debuted on March 23, 2000 and was
then titled "Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida." The Broadway show
was instantly a success, winning a Tony Award for best score and, to
be cliche, the rest is history...
Flash forward to Stanford — Ram's I lead's latest musical out
ing showcases the style of Elton John and Tim Rice the way it was
written. The story starts oil in a modern-day museum setting.

Patrons arc sipping champagne and enjoying the

cultural atmosphere of Egyptian history. The

stage freezes as a statue of Amneris, an Egyptian

princess, comes to life, and begins weaving the

epic love story that is "Aida." Amneris, played

by Gianna Masi Ml, captivates the audience

with her strong vocal talent; and as she begins

to sing, the actors and staging take us back in

time to the story of Aida in ancient Egypt,

The story begins with Egyptian Captain

Radames celebrating the spoils of a victory

•— — — d — ~r —■/
while on a cartographic mission in Nubia, Egypt's

enemy. Three Nubian women are taken by his sol

diers and taken back to Egypt. The strength of one of

these women sets her apart and captures the attention ol

the young captain. We soon realize that she is Aida, the
princess of Nubia. From this point, the bulk of the story is
fairly predictable, as Aida and Radames fall into a forbidden
love. The development of their romance is fairly rushed, but
this is not uncommon in musicals, where much of the charac

ter development is through song,
which this performance does well.
As previously mentioned, vocal
talent can be hard to come by at
Stanford, but thankfully this is not an
issue, as Alex Nourishad '09 and Re
Phillips '10 deliver outstanding vocal
performances for the lead roles of
Radames and Aida. But the vocal tal
ent doesn't just end with the leads.
Other notable performers are those
who play the characters of Mereb
(Julian Kusnadi Ml) and Zoser,
Radames' father (Benno Rosenwald
'11). Besides the main characters,
many of the others bring great
singing parts as well.
The plot of the musical is not
incredibly unique — as you can

imagine, the
love story
between
Aida and
Radames,
which is
surround
ed by con
flict, lasts

through all tri
als. The Haws of

this story are by no
means the fault of the

Stanford company, however, as

they are better attributed to the source

material. Thankfully, the focus of a musical is not its plot. The vocals arc well-supported by
the orchestra, which does a good job reproducing the rock/opera sounds of Elton John's
musical score.
Now, for those of you who aren't familiar with the idea of a rock opera, the premise of
using pop/rock music in a story that takes place in ancient Egypt might sound off-putting,
but it works well because this musical blends both elements of the past and present, which is
important in the show's overall theme — that "love is timeless." This can be heard in the
Egyptian-esque tones that are subtle in songs and the strong ballads that are heavily inspired
by the pop/rock background of Elton John. Moving away from the music, the group's per
formance also blends the elements of modern and ancient. For example, Aida often speaks
like the noble princess she is, but also has a bit of sass and modern colloquial thought.
Besides the dialogue and lyrics, the production is notable in other ways. The staging and
setting are well-thought-out, and the use of lighting is particularly well-done in Aida and
Radames' love duet, "Written in the Stars."
The musical itself is weak in comparison to other great Broadway productions, such as
"Phantom of the Opera" or "Rent.' Once again, the fault is not the performers', but that of
Elton John and Tim Rice. The lyrics and music are simply not as strong, but Stanford's rendi
tion of the performance is a good piece of work.
Spring musicals should be extravagant and moving. It should end the year on a high
note, showcasing that although a techie school, Stanford has its fair share of performing arts
talent. This aim has been something of a hit-or-miss over the past few years, but this year's
Rams Head production of "Aida" not only meets all of the expectations of what a spring
musical should be, but it surpasses them, combining poetic subtleties with an array of talent
to bring us a timeless story about love.
