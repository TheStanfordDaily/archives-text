The 2009 Asia-Pacific Student
Entrepreneurship Society (ASHS)
Summit attracted a panel of business
luminaries and 47 student delegates
from halfway around the world last
week to a weeklong conference on
Stanford's campus. The delegates,
representing some of the finest col
leges in Asia. Australia and even
Africa, gathered on the Farm from
April 5-11.
Starting their days at 9 a.m. and
often ending after 11 p.m.. the dele
gates divided their time between pre
sentations. workshops, discussions
and company tours.They also teamed
up with each other to compete for the
annual E-Pitch project, with the goal
of creating a plan for a socially signif

icant nonprofit business.
From energy organizations to
biotech firms and venture capital
start-ups. companies featured at the
summit provided speakers from a
spectrum of fields and perspectives.
Large crowds of Stanford students
joined the delegates as they covered
subjects ranging from the benefits of
brainstorming to the top 10 legal mis
takes of start-ups.
"It used to be the trend [for entre
preneurs] to go from the U.S. to
Asia," said ASES President Yesul
Myung '09. "Right now what people
are saying is that there are a lot of
trends coming from Asia to the U.S.
That's why having a focus and an out
look on the Asia-Pacific region is cru
cial."
The ASES Summit has been con
necting future entrepreneurs in the

Asia-Pacific region since 2(KM).
"The whole purpose of the summit
is to bring people from Asia-Pacific
together, and to hopefully share the
same dream, same kind of mission,
same hopes that we have of starting
companies wherever in Asia or in
Silicon Valley." said Summit Director
Simon Kim Ml.
Sumat Mittal. from the Delhi
College of Engineering in New Delhi.
India, emphasized the value of the
issues raised in the summit's work
shops.
"The values that we're obtaining
here are pretty different from what
we would have obtained in any other
country." he said. "The issues are
addressing are so important right now
for us future entrepreneurs. They tell
us the mistakes that I hey made and
that we're not to make. Tilings like
that are not easy to get from any
where else."
Damian Powell, from the
University of Stellenbosch. South
Africa, was the first African delegate
to take part in the summit.
"I'm sort of a social entrepre
neur." he said. "Hearing |the speak
ers'! stories, how they made it big.
really inspires me to go back to my
country and work with what I've
learned. Even with my continent,
with Africa having a lot problems
right now. South Africa provides a
good platform with a lot of entrepre
neurship going on."
Yin Wang, a Ph.D. candidate in
optics at /.hejiang University in
('hina. hopes to one day start his own
company in fiber communications.
"Silicon Valley is the heaven for
all entrepreneurs," Wang said."We all
want to know what's happening here.
It's quite exciting."
Gautam (iarg. a junior majoring
in electronics and communication at
the Delhi College of Engineering,
had never been to the I J.S. before last
week. C iarg said he was impressed by
both the architecture and the wel
coming students at Stanford.
"I've never seen a University like
this before it's really beautiful," he
said. "The professors are really inspir
ing. I want to keep in touch with

them."
Equally content on campus was
an alumnus who has met with consid
erable success since finishing his
Stanford education. Jen-I Isun I luang
M.S. '92. Co-founder and CEO of
NVIDIA and one of the keynote
speakers of the summit, recently
donated $30 million to Stanford for
the construction of the Jen-I Isun
Huang School of Engineering
Center.
Huang, who spent eight years at
Stanford, fondly remembered the
"fabulous gift" from Stanford profes
sors. labeling his Stanford experience
"a very large part of my life."
"When I was a student, I greatly
enjoyed being a student, so you
should do that," he advised. "Relish
the opportunity to be here and also
the people you're with ... you're
likely already in a class or are friends
with somebody who is going to
change the world. Relish the moment
and be aware of the moment â€” then
you'll get a lot more out of the educa
tion."
And the summit's delegates seem
to be doing just that.
"It's really nice to meet so many
people from various areas and to
build a human network that will go a
long way in the future" Mittal said.
Australian delegate Jonathan Tsc
echoed this sentiment.
"All of a sudden, you look around
and you have 40 friends from all over
the world." he noted. "You don't get
to do that very often."
