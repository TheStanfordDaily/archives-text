## EDITORIAL Vaden service charge unequal and unpublicized 
### 
Last Wednesday, the University Admin
istration announced that Vaden
Health Center will charge students a
mandatory $167 Health Services Fee per
quarter beginning fall of this year. Vaden's
health services were previously free to stu
dents because they were financed through
Stanford University's general funds. Ser
vices supported by the new fee include pri
mary care services. Counseling and Psycho
logical Services (CAPS), as well as health
outreach programs, such as the Peer Health
Educator (PHE) program (see "Vaden fees
convey extent of crisis." April 10,2009). Vice
Provost for Student Affairs Greg Boardman
cited the rising cost of health services and
the ongoing economic crisis as reasons be
hind the fee's institution.
While the Editorial Board appreciates
the gravity of financial circumstances and
understands that painful cuts are being
made throughout the budget, we are con
cerned about the effect that the Health Ser
vices Fee will have on student life. Stanford
may be reeling from the reported 25 to 30
percent drop in its endowment, but students
are also suffering in the face of economic un
certainty. For many, it is hard enough to
make ends meet with tuition, room and
board payments. This is not an appropriate
time for Stanford to push more of its finan
cial burden onto undergraduates and gradu
ate students. We are thankful that the fee is
covered under current financial aid pack
ages but still fear that the extra payments
could affect grad students and uncovered
undergrads.
Administration officials argue that it is
justified instituting a fee for campus health
services because such fees are common at
many universities, but this reasoning is falla
cious. This argument would only withstand
scrutiny if there were no relevant differences
between Stanford and other universities that
charge for health services, but Stanford has
one of the largest endowments of any uni
versity in the country. Thus, the Administra
tion is wrong to conclude that it is justified or
reasonable for Stanford to charge its stu
dents a health services fee merely because it
is common practice at other universities with
far fewer resources.
Moreover, the Editorial Board believes
that the mandatory fee places an undue fi
nancial burden on students who use Vaden

infrequently or choose to seek healthcare off
campus. It is important to have readily avail
able health services at Stanford, but the
healthy majority should not be asked to sub
sidize the cost of care for those who are often
sick and visit Vaden more than the average
student. While Administration officials
sought to spread the costs of healthcare
among the entire student population, under
standably not wanting to target those who
happen to fall ill with higher bills,a small co
pay for each visit can help defray the ex
pense for all while deterring those who
abuse Vaden's services and drive up operat
ing costs. At the very least, a co-pay system
would be consistent with the healthcare
process students are used to dealing with
through insurance.
Finally. Stanford's student body is right to
be insulted by the manner in which the new
1 lealth Services Fee was publicized — or. to
be more precise, not publicized — by the
University. The Editorial Board is dismayed
by the Administration's apparently premed
itated attempt to subvert transparency. The
original notice of the fee was sent by the Vice
Provost of Student Affairs to campus admin
istrators and higher-ups on April 7. The
email stated that students would be in
formed about the fee in the "coming weeks"
through a short article in the Stanford Re
port. and that the Administration
"expect[ed]" that The Daily would also in
clude coverage. The Editorial Board be
lieves the University should have reported
to students directly about the fee. The Ad
ministration's reliance on campus media to
publicize the fee sends the wrong message,
suggesting that I University officials are with
holding crucial information from the student
body, unwilling to face student responses. We
have heard administrators pledge to include
students in the budget-cutting process and
communicate the changes, but in this in
stance the process seems to have broken
down.
In the end. we recognize that price hikes
in these times of budgetary turmoil are un
avoidable, and we agree that CAPS and pri
marv-care services are worth saving. Still, the
even application of fees to frequent Vaden
patients and those who stay away — as well
as the strangely indirect method of dissemi
nating the news — makes these fees all the
less palatable.
