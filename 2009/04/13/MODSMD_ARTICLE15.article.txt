(The following is otic man 's Declaration of In

that plagues this university. Tommyhave a

When in the Course of human events it
becomes necessary for one people
to dissolve the hierarchical bands
which have connected them with another and
to assume among the powers of the Farm, the
separate and equal station to which the Laws
of Nature and of Hennessy entitle them,a de
cent respect to the opinions of their fellow
students requires that they should declare tile
causes which impel them to the separation.
Also: USC blows.
We hold these truths to be self-evident,
that all Stanford Students are created equal,
that they are endowed by their admission
with certain unalienable Rights, that among
these are a superior education, intellectual
autonomy and the pursuit of Happiness, in
whatever form that may be (Natty v. Key
stone. for example). — ITiat to secure these
rights, administrations are instituted among
students, deriving their just powers from the
consent of the governed, and the funds of
John Arrillaga.— That whenever any Form
of bureaucracy becomes destructive of these
ends, it is the Right of the Student Body to
alter or to abolish it.and to institute new
structures, laying its foundation on such prin
ciples and organizing its powers in such form,
as to them shall seem most likely to affect
their Safety and Ifappiness.
But when a long, Southern Pacific train of
abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably
the same Object to reduce them under ab
solute Despotism, it is their right, it is their
duty, to throw off such shackles, and to pro
vide new Guards for their future education
and wcllbeing. — Such has been the patient
sufferance of this student body; and such is
now the necessity, which constrains them to
alter their former Systems of autonomy. The

history of the present head of the Office of
Student Activities (OSA) is a history of re
peated injuries and usurpations, all having in
direct object the establishment of an absolute
Tyranny over these students.To prove this, let
Facts be submitted to a candid campus.
She has forbidden her underlings to help
VS( )s and starter groups with issues of imme
diate and pressing importance, unless sus
pended in their operation till her Assent
should be obtained; and when so suspended,
she has utterly neglected to attend to them.
Meetings with groups/individuals can literal
ly be held up for months based on her whims.
Favoritism is rampant within the bowels of
the OSA.
She has refused to consent to the throwing
of large-scale parties for the accommodation
of large districts of students, unless those peo
ple would relinquish the right of having par
ties not watched over directly by the SUPD.a
right inestimable to them and formidable to
tyrants only. Moonsplash. based upon her
whims, was supposed to be staffed by SIJPI)
officers, who are both a) ridiculously expen
sive and b) not the security required for near
ly any event.
She has called together meetings with stu
dent group leaders and house managers at
places distant from the depository of their
Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatigu
ing them into compliance with her measures.
Browbeating, cajoling are not infrequent oc
currences in the OSA meeting room.
She has obstructed the Administration of

dent accountability for her actions. It
makes no sense, that a two-decade
bureaucrat, who has slid her tentacles
over EVERY aspect of student life, is
never held to defend her actions to
the undergraduate population. A stu
dent review board of the OSA must
be created.
In every stage of these Oppres
sions We have Petitioned for Redress
in the most humble terms: Our re
peated Petitions have been answered

only by repeated injury. A Director,
whose character is thus marked by
every act which may define a Tyrant,
is unfit to be Ihe ruler of a free student
body.
We. therefore, the Representa

People of this campus, solemnly pub
lish and declare. That this united
body, and of Right ought to be Free
and Independent from the OSA.that
they are Absolved from all Alle
giance to the Crown, and that all po

the second floor of Old Union, is and
ought to be totally dissolved; and that

as Free and Independent students,
have full Power to speak our minds,
plan responsible parties, fundraise
from outside sources and to do all
other Acts and linings which Inde
