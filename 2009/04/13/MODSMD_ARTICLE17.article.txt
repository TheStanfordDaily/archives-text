## Endorsements and the ASSU 
### 
There was a remarkably high level of in
terest in the ASSU elections this year.
Undergraduate turnout was up 15 per
cent from last year, which featured a wild
five-slate contest for ASSU President and
Vice President. Despite only two slates (and
the Chappie's long-winded effort) running
for ASSU Executive ihis year, which is by far
the most visible race in the election, hun
dreds more students voted.
I"he defining feature of ASSU elections as
we have come to know them is remarkable
reliance on endorsements from student
groups to win the election. The Stanford
Daily, the Stanford Democrats (disclaimer: I
was on the committee selecting Senate and
Executive candidates for endorsements), t lie
Queer Coalition.Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC), Students for a Sustainable Stanford
(SSS) and many other groups made endorse
ments for Senate and/or Executive candi
dates. We've also seen an increase in the
number of endorsing student groups. In my
Senate campaign in April 2008, I collected
more than 10 student groups' support.
Endorsements were also used to tar other
slates. Supporters of David Gobaud and Jay

de la Torre attacked the Uauser/Sprague
campaign because they were endorsed by the
Stanford Review and the Stanford Conserv
ative Society. (Gobaud and de la Torre them
selves had nothing to do with the attacks). ()n
a broadly liberal, Obama-loving campus,
being associated with conservatives is not the
way to win votes.
This system certainly benefits student
groups, who can exact high amounts of lever
age over candidates desperate to get elected.
It's a constant concern among candidates
that if they lack the all-important endorse
ment. they will not get any votes from the
community represented by those student
groups.The groups can force students to ac
cede to their agenda to get elected.
But I am not sure it benefits the student
body as a whole.
The paradox is that while student groups
endorse candidates for their narrow organi
zational imperatives, candidates use these
endorsements to win support among the
broader populace. So while the Stanford De
mocrats' endorsement questionnaire, for ex
ample, is mostly about the concerns of organ
ization — fundraising issues, free speech.

hosting events on campus — candidates use
the endorsement to appeal to students who
want to vote for the "liberal" candidates.
The unfortunate nature of the endorse
ment process is that candidates are forced to
highlight certain elements ol their agenda to
appeal to endorsing groups, such as queer
rights, diversity issues, sustainability and
community centers I'hese issues are all very
important, ol course, but other ke\ issues,
such as academics. ()SA party-planning poli
cies. housing policies — issues that affect all
students but don't have an interest group to
advocate for them, receive much less atten
tion during the annual ASSI I elections.
It's hard to argue that academics don't
matter to students, or that the evolving re
strictions on parties do not affect most stu
dents. Hut because there are no student



Baimel
groups to offer endorsements to stu
dents who care about those areas of
policy, candidates have little incen
tive to make those issues a key part
of their platform. And when they are
elected, they will be advocating for
the issues they were elected for.
There is no "Academic Advocacy
Coalition." and as a result, there is no
incentive for Executive and Senate
candidates to highlight academic is
sues. Nor is there an "OSA Commis
sion" to induce candidates to make
relations with the OSA a main part of
their platform. Despite these issues
ostensibly being high on the priority
list for student voters, candidates do
not seem to care much about them.

The issue. I think, is similar to one
that is common in American politics.
The best-formed advocacy groups in
national politics are centered on a
narrow issue with a limited group of
members who speak loudly. The Na
tional Rifle Association is a good ex
ample of this phenomenon. Groups
that attempt to form a larger base
around a broader issue often have
problems mobilizing members —
my favorite example is the ludicrous
"SUV Owners of America."
The myopic, endless focus on only
a few hot-button issues has distorted
the nature of student political dis
course. I received many all-caps
emails demanding that community
centers get cut less than every other
department on campus: meanwhile,
the Peer Mentoring and HPAC pro
grams were cut entirely without a
word from any student.The Interdis
ciplinary Studies in the Humanities

department was liquidated entirely
without any student comment. I re
ceived many emails urging me to sign
a petition to urge Jamba Juice not to
use Styrofoam, but not a single email
about half of the academic advising
programs simply disappearing next
year.
The only way out of the strangle
hold that endorsements have on stu
dent government elections is to
allow candidates to gain votes in
other ways. We have already seen
that this year and last year, with the
innovative use of You Tube to reach
voters directly rather than through a
student group intermediary. But the
restrictions on fliers, emails and
other forms of speech privilege the
student groups who are not bound
by those same rules. Allowing more
creative forms of campaigning will
break the lock that endorsing stu
dent groups have on the ASSU elec
tions process.
