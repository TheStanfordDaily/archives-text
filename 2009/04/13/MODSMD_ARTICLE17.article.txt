## Endorsements and the ASSU 
### 
There was a remarkably high level of in
terest in the ASSU elections this year.
Undergraduate turnout was up 15 per
cent from last year, which featured a wild
five-slate contest for ASSU President and
Vice President. Despite only two slates (and
the Chappie's long-winded effort) running
for ASSU Executive ihis year, which is by far
the most visible race in the election, hun
dreds more students voted.
I"he defining feature of ASSU elections as
we have come to know them is remarkable
reliance on endorsements from student
groups to win the election. The Stanford
Daily, the Stanford Democrats (disclaimer: I
was on the committee selecting Senate and
Executive candidates for endorsements), t lie
Queer Coalition.Students of Color Coalition
(SOCC), Students for a Sustainable Stanford
(SSS) and many other groups made endorse
ments for Senate and/or Executive candi
dates. We've also seen an increase in the
number of endorsing student groups. In my
Senate campaign in April 2008, I collected
more than 10 student groups' support.
Endorsements were also used to tar other
slates. Supporters of David Gobaud and Jay

de la Torre attacked the Uauser/Sprague
campaign because they were endorsed by the
Stanford Review and the Stanford Conserv
ative Society. (Gobaud and de la Torre them
selves had nothing to do with the attacks). ()n
a broadly liberal, Obama-loving campus,
being associated with conservatives is not the
way to win votes.
This system certainly benefits student
groups, who can exact high amounts of lever
age over candidates desperate to get elected.
It's a constant concern among candidates
that if they lack the all-important endorse
ment. they will not get any votes from the
community represented by those student
groups.The groups can force students to ac
cede to their agenda to get elected.
But I am not sure it benefits the student
body as a whole.
The paradox is that while student groups
endorse candidates for their narrow organi
zational imperatives, candidates use these
endorsements to win support among the
broader populace. So while the Stanford De
mocrats' endorsement questionnaire, for ex
ample, is mostly about the concerns of organ
ization — fundraising issues, free speech.

hosting events on campus — candidates use
the endorsement to appeal to students who
want to vote for the "liberal" candidates.
The unfortunate nature of the endorse
ment process is that candidates are forced to
highlight certain elements ol their agenda to
appeal to endorsing groups, such as queer
rights, diversity issues, sustainability and
community centers I'hese issues are all very
important, ol course, but other ke\ issues,
such as academics. ()SA party-planning poli
cies. housing policies — issues that affect all
students but don't have an interest group to
advocate for them, receive much less atten
tion during the annual ASSI I elections.
It's hard to argue that academics don't
matter to students, or that the evolving re
strictions on parties do not affect most stu
dents. Hut because there are no student
