Wine is the most civilized thing in the world.
— Ernest Hemingway
As both a drinking man and an aspiring
elitist jackass. I can't begin to de
scribe the joy I felt when I trans
ferred to Stanford and first heard about
FRENLANG6O. the legendary "Viticulture
and Oenology"course, a class I soon came to
believe was as much of an undergraduate
rite of passage as surviving IHIJM or getting
forcibly thrown out of Rudy's by a bouncer
with an antebellum mustache. I had my
sights set on Senior Spring, when I would at
last cast off the shackles of my Pabst-soaked
Midwest upbringing and finally accomplish
what I came here to do in the first place:
learn completely useless knowledge I could
hring up unsolicited in mixed company with
a ridiculous amount of self importance. I
was going to understand intricacies and vo
cabulary associated with line wine consump

tion, which, save for pheasant hunting or
completing monetary transactions solely
with briefcases of blood diamonds and un
marked Benjamins, is probably the most
awesome and elitist activity in the whole en
lire world.This was fate. I thought. This was
destiny.
My (iod. how wrong I was.
Of course, the most storied tradition
about PRKNLANGftO doesn't have any
thing to do with what actually goes on in the
class, but with what goes on before il. Stan
ford students,alrcadv famous for their tenac
ity. set up camp outside Building 30 long be
fore signup opens in order to ensure a spot.
At other schools, they do this lor basketball
tickets or to get into huge, over-enrolled
intro level lectures. At Stanford, we only doit
for drinking. It's absolutely beautiful.
After days of planning, the boys and I set
out for the quad with all the necessary sup
plies (tents, sleeping bags. 2.71 of Charles

Sh;iw per capita), ready to rough il lor a
night and wake up to the glorious reward ol
enrollment in the eourxe ol our dreams.
Needless to say, we were more than a little
disappointed when v\e got there. The class
had eiosed a day early. ail the spots snatched
up by kills who camped out .111 unprecedent
ed two da\s before signup was supposed to
begin.
Describing the emotions that followed
would be like trying todesci ibe p;iin or loss or
tear true griel means something pro
foundly different to everyone, and it's point
less to even try but I'll say this li I never
see such shattered looks on the laces ol my
friends ever again. 11 won't be long enough.

li s nothing short of incredible what
missing out on a chance to drink in an
academically sanctioned environ
ment will do to even the most stone
laced of Stanford seniors.
So we screamed, cried, held each
other close. We questioned every
thing. We drank a whole lot of the
types of wines that would make the
I RFNLANG6O instructor (experi
enced San I rancisco sommelier A.J.
Ferrari) throw up in public.and after
all that — the pain, the heartbreak,
the cascades of self-pitying zinfan
del — it seemed that all the rage and
emotions of the group could be
summed up into one concise inter
rogative: What the hell?
Now. I have no hard feelings what
soever for my intrepid senior class
mates who camped early and made it
into the course. On the contrary, their
dedication and commitment has re
juvenated my belief in the funda

mental goodness of the Stanford stu
dent body more than a million Ser
vice Summits or ASSU elections ever
could. The problem here isn't with
the students at all. Did I get beaten to
the punch? Absolutely, fair and
square. Does that mean I'm not enti
tled to spend part of my last quarter
at Stanford paying an additional $90
on top of the $150,000 I've already
spent on this I lumßio degree to kick
back on Tuesday nights and learn a
thing or two about how to incorpo
rate world-class, monocle-fogging
levels of snobbery into my everyday
life? Absolutely not.
We deserve better. Wine-tasting
courses are a staple of gigantic state
universities everywhere, places with
eight times our enrollment, and any
senior who wants in on one of these
courses is generally able to pull it off
(notwithstanding that a good friend
at the University of Illinois has her
wine class at 10 a.m. on Monday
mornings, but for Senior Spring I
have a feeling most of us would take
that in stride).
After knocking out 72 units of
GER coursework and spending

more money on college than 60 per
cent of the world earns in a lifetime,
I don't think one unit of fun and in
dulgence my last quarter here was
too much to ask.
Truly, there's got to be a better
solution than the renegade "classes"
senior groups are putting together
to counteract the mighty thirst
we've all got for old-fashioned
Dionysian revelry. While the select
few are going to spend the quarter
with pinkies thrust skyward whilst
sipping Mondavi and Ecco Domani.
only that trio of dastardly charlatans
Franzia, Rossi and Shaw — will
now be explored and enjoyed by
most of the senior class, and while
I'm more than excited about meet
ing friends on Thursday nights to
sample the best of what the box
and-jug section of the liquor aisle at
Safeway has to offer. I know Stan
ford could have done us better.
