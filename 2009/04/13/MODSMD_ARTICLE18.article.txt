Wine is the most civilized thing in the world.
â€” Ernest Hemingway
As both a drinking man and an aspiring
elitist jackass. I can't begin to de
scribe the joy I felt when I trans
ferred to Stanford and first heard about
FRENLANG6O. the legendary "Viticulture
and Oenology"course, a class I soon came to
believe was as much of an undergraduate
rite of passage as surviving IHIJM or getting
forcibly thrown out of Rudy's by a bouncer
with an antebellum mustache. I had my
sights set on Senior Spring, when I would at
last cast off the shackles of my Pabst-soaked
Midwest upbringing and finally accomplish
what I came here to do in the first place:
learn completely useless knowledge I could
hring up unsolicited in mixed company with
a ridiculous amount of self importance. I
was going to understand intricacies and vo
cabulary associated with line wine consump

tion, which, save for pheasant hunting or
completing monetary transactions solely
with briefcases of blood diamonds and un
marked Benjamins, is probably the most
awesome and elitist activity in the whole en
lire world.This was fate. I thought. This was
destiny.
My (iod. how wrong I was.
Of course, the most storied tradition
about PRKNLANGftO doesn't have any
thing to do with what actually goes on in the
class, but with what goes on before il. Stan
ford students,alrcadv famous for their tenac
ity. set up camp outside Building 30 long be
fore signup opens in order to ensure a spot.
At other schools, they do this lor basketball
tickets or to get into huge, over-enrolled
intro level lectures. At Stanford, we only doit
for drinking. It's absolutely beautiful.
After days of planning, the boys and I set
out for the quad with all the necessary sup
plies (tents, sleeping bags. 2.71 of Charles

Sh;iw per capita), ready to rough il lor a
night and wake up to the glorious reward ol
enrollment in the eourxe ol our dreams.
Needless to say, we were more than a little
disappointed when v\e got there. The class
had eiosed a day early. ail the spots snatched
up by kills who camped out .111 unprecedent
ed two da\s before signup was supposed to
begin.
Describing the emotions that followed
would be like trying todesci ibe p;iin or loss or
tear true griel means something pro
foundly different to everyone, and it's point
less to even try but I'll say this li I never
see such shattered looks on the laces ol my
friends ever again. 11 won't be long enough.
