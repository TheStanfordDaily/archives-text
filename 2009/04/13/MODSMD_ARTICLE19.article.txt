Freshman outside hitter Brad Lawson notched 29 kills during No. 5 Stanford's two-game meeting with No. 6 BYU. The Cardinal split the series with
the Cougars, losing in five sets on Friday, but winning in straight sets on Saturday.

"Their blocking and defense
were better than ours, and it just put
us in a rut." said Ellis, one of many
Cardinal blockers who were held
down by BYU "I give their blocking
credit for their win."
The Cardinal had trouble putting
away the Cougars early in the
match, and it was ultimately the dif
ference. In the second set. the
Cardinal held a commanding 25-19
lead, but gave up seven straight
points and ultimately lost the set.
giving BYU momentum for the rest
of the match. After scoring the first
three points in the fifth set. the

Cardinal let the set and the match
slip avvav. gaining only eight of the
final 23 points.
After the disappointing loss, the
Cardinal played the same BYU
squad on Saturday, but with far dif
ferent results. Stanford looked like a
different team in the second match,
winning in straight sets 30-24,30-19.
30-19. The match was never close, as
BYU only led a set for one point at
8-7 in the first. From that point on.
the Cardinal was clearly the superi
or team. Stanford hit .386 for the
match, despite Romero, who leads
the team in kills, heing held to only
five kills and five errors. Lawson and
McLachlin, on the other hand, led
the Cardinal with 15 and 10 kills,
respectively.
"The coaches told the outside
hitters to hit more line shots, which

made their block less effective,"
Ellis said.
BYU's blocking was indeed sti
lled by the Cardinal, who out
blocked the Cougars 11-4.5. The
Cardinal middle blockers complete
ly shut down their BYU counter
parts. led by senior Brandon
Williams and junior Garrett Werner,
who combined for 10 block assists
and 13 kills with no errors.
"Everyone played better." Ellis
said. "In particular. Brandon and
Garrett hit for a very high percent
age. Everyone made a few improve
ments. and we finished strong."
BYU could not find many
sources of offense, finishing with 29
errors, no aces and only one player
hitting over .200 for the match. The
Cougar's side out game was espe
cially weak, as it only converted 57

percent of its side outs, compared to
SI percent for the Cardinal.
Despite receiving only a split of
the matches. Stanford came out
ahead in the conference because it
gained the tiebreaker over BYU by
winning more sets than the Cougars
during the weekend. After this
weekend's matches, Stanford now
holds a one-game lead over both
USC and BYU for the fourth spot in
the MPSF standings, but USC holds
the tiebreaker over Stanford.
The Cardinal concludes the regu
lar season with two more matches at
home — against No. 2 UC-Irvine on
Friday and against No. 9 UCLA on
Saturday. Both games take place at
Maples Pavilion at 7 p.m.
