# ASSU Elections
## Senate seats split among coalitions SBS grabs eight seats; SOCC takes seven; Ali wins with most votes 
### THE DAILY ASSU ELECTIONS TEAM 
At the end of last week's ASSU
elections. Students for a Better
Stanford (SBS) had eight candidates
elected to the ASSIJ Undergraduate
Senate, and the Students of Color
Coalition (SOCC ) had seven. With
more votes needed to make the top
15 this year when compared to 2()()<S.
endorsements factored in more
heavily than ever.
SOCC-endorsed Mohammad All
'10 had the highest vote total, with
1.222 votes. [Dual-endorsed Anton
Xietsman '12 was second, followed
by SBS leader and current Senate
Chair Shelley Gao '11 in third.
"1 feel really good, very happy."
said Ali. who "definitely did not"
expect to win the highest number of
votes.
Throughout the campaign sea
son. SBS and SOCC insisted that
they were not rivals. Next year's
Senate w ill be almost evenly divided
between the two groups.
The only candidate to be elected
without the backing of either S()( '(
or SBS was incumbent Senator
Xachary Johnson '10. who placed
12th with 902 votes.
"I mainly utilized the connec
tions I'd already made through
Stanford, the Senate and student
groups," Johnson said, speaking of
his campaign tactics.
Johnson, though, was never com
pletely certain of his strategy of
campaigning alone.
"To be honest. I was slightly wor
ried in the beginning." he said. "But
even the perception of one coalition
against another encumbers the
process, and that's why 1 chose not
to join."
SBS member Xach Warma 'I I. a
columnist for Ihe Daily, down
played the influence of the endorse
ments.

"I think lor the two primary play
ers in this campaign — of SBS and
SOCC — [their success] didn't
speak to the strengths of any two
presumed coalitions, hut spoke to
the strength of the people who got
elected," he said.
Gao. who won the highest num
ber ol votes in last year's Senate
elections with 1.124 votes, was visi
bly disappointed when her name
failed to come up in the first and sec
ond Senate spots. Gao came in third
with 1.177 votes.
"I'm very grateful for the oppor
tunity to serve the student body
again," she said. Gao declined fur
ther comment, other than noting
that she is the only woman elected
to the Senate this year.
While the Senate is composed of
mainly SMS and SOCC candidates,
Warma assured that the endorse
ments will not negatively impact the
Senate.
"Our primary concern, whatever
comes from SBS ... is now about
governance and consensus-driven
action." he said. "It becomes that
much more real, now that it's not
about us versus them, but 15 people
sitting in the Senate trying to make a
better Stanford."
Warma noted that the SBS
Facebook group had been deleted as
of Sunday.
SOC ( -endorsed senate-elect.
Michael Crux 12, claimed that there
have already been steps take to pre
vent senate division.
"It's going to be an interesting
year." he said. "We've already taken
steps to prevent sectionalism by try
ing to get to know one another on a
personal level. Basically we've just
been saying we all need to get
together."
This year's Senate candidates
also faced a tougher race than in
