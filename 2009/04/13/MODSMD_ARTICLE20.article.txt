# Laundry makes loyalty?
## 
### 
When il conies to sports
fandom. there are usu
ally simple rules gov
erning the teams an en
thusiast is expected to cheer for. As
college students, we have obvious
ties to the I Iniversity and our class
mates nn its athletic teams. Rooting
for the Cardinal football squad
would seem to be an obvious choice
if you lived down the hall from Tavi
ta Pritchard. worked with Toby (ier
hart or had a class with Chris
Marinelli. And geography can ac
count for other causes ol fan alle
giance for obvious reasons.
And yet. there's something miss
ing from our thus far obvious equa
tion of fandom. Because people
move and continue to follow their old
hometown's teams. They graduate
and still root for their alma mater.
Players we cheered in their youth re
tire and are replaced by youngsters
we've never heard of before. In the
end, Jerry Seinfeld, it seems, is always
right — being a fan really does ulti
mately mean you're just cheering lor
laundry.
Which brings us to the point ol the
column, and the most overlooked as
pect of what being a fan means — the
uniforms for which we cheer. We
have a choice, you see, as far as what
jersey we choose to follow, maybe lor
the rest of our li\es. And at least for
me, a team's fashion choices can dras
tically influence how I feel about it.
Heck. I'm not going to lie. it's about
the only fashion trend I actually pay
attention to. and I'm quite alright
with that.
()l course, it's largely a matter of
personal preference, but who isn t
drawn to a certain uniform over oth
ers? I or me. that means seeing a won
derful symmetry in the rugged.north
south offensive tradition of Penn
State and its no frills blue and white
colors, without even a logo on the side
of their helmets. ()r appreciating the
timeless look ol birds on a bat in St.
I .ouis or pinstripes in New York.
hut it's not all about admiration.
Indeed, much as I might think pin
stripes. for instance, are a pretty cool
look for baseball. I'm not about to be
come a Yankees fan anytime soon.
Hut a loathed uniform is perhaps the
most surefire was to alienate a fan.
Again, it's personal choice ... mostly.
You can't tell me that if you stare long
enough at an Athletics player at bat.
