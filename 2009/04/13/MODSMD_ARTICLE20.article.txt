# Laundry makes loyalty?
## 
### 
When il conies to sports
fandom. there are usu
ally simple rules gov
erning the teams an en
thusiast is expected to cheer for. As
college students, we have obvious
ties to the I Iniversity and our class
mates nn its athletic teams. Rooting
for the Cardinal football squad
would seem to be an obvious choice
if you lived down the hall from Tavi
ta Pritchard. worked with Toby (ier
hart or had a class with Chris
Marinelli. And geography can ac
count for other causes ol fan alle
giance for obvious reasons.
And yet. there's something miss
ing from our thus far obvious equa
tion of fandom. Because people
move and continue to follow their old
hometown's teams. They graduate
and still root for their alma mater.
Players we cheered in their youth re
tire and are replaced by youngsters
we've never heard of before. In the
end, Jerry Seinfeld, it seems, is always
right — being a fan really does ulti
mately mean you're just cheering lor
laundry.
Which brings us to the point ol the
column, and the most overlooked as
pect of what being a fan means — the
uniforms for which we cheer. We
have a choice, you see, as far as what
jersey we choose to follow, maybe lor
the rest of our li\es. And at least for
me, a team's fashion choices can dras
tically influence how I feel about it.
Heck. I'm not going to lie. it's about
the only fashion trend I actually pay
attention to. and I'm quite alright
with that.
()l course, it's largely a matter of
personal preference, but who isn t
drawn to a certain uniform over oth
ers? I or me. that means seeing a won
derful symmetry in the rugged.north
south offensive tradition of Penn
State and its no frills blue and white
colors, without even a logo on the side
of their helmets. ()r appreciating the
timeless look ol birds on a bat in St.
I .ouis or pinstripes in New York.
hut it's not all about admiration.
Indeed, much as I might think pin
stripes. for instance, are a pretty cool
look for baseball. I'm not about to be
come a Yankees fan anytime soon.
Hut a loathed uniform is perhaps the
most surefire was to alienate a fan.
Again, it's personal choice ... mostly.
You can't tell me that if you stare long
enough at an Athletics player at bat.
those awful white shoes don't make
him look like a clown. And when the


Griffin
Rants and Raves
Seahawks wear the algae-green jer
seys and pants with lime green high
lights ... well, frankly it looks a bit too
much like the ocean threw up. to me.
Sometimes it even works in
reverse — a love for a team can
influence fashion in real life. As my
passion for the San Francisco
Giants grew over the years. I
noticed the quantity of orange
clothing in my wardrobe increas
ing. The amount of Dodger-blue
clothing, meanwhile, fell drastically.
My love for a team can influence
what I'm likely to wear and. in turn
over time, what I like.
And don't think for a minute that
teams don't know exactly how much
their duds mean to their fans.
There's no other explanation for the

constant jersev updates, throwback
nights, alternates and the like.
Sometimes the changes are wel
come. like when the Stanford foot
ball team eliminated the black high
lights and went with the classic, all
cardinal-and-white look. Or (hope
fully) in a few weeks, when the 49ers
unveil their new look, widely specu
lated to be. well, their old look dur
ing the NFL Draft. In both these
cases, the team's move is an admis
sion that sometimes classic looks are
best left unchanged, despite the
higher temporary revenues those
changes can bring in as fans rush to
acquire their team's latest look. But
it's the classic uniforms that can real
ly best appeal to everyone, young
and old alike.
But perhaps it's the subject that
inspired me to write this column that
is the most egregious recent incident
in recent local history, as the
Stanford women's basketball team
took to the floor against UConn

wearing their black alternates. I'm
sorry, hut when your team is a color,
you'd better wear uniforms with that
color. Especially when a national
title is on the line and the entire
country is watching you play.
More often, though, the change
of a uniform, unless it's a minor
tweak to update a style slightly, is no
less than a traumatic event for fans.
After all. when all you're really root
ing for is laundry, it's disturbing to
know it can be changed as quickly as
the latest trend can move in. And
when some franchises are judged by
the very color of their socks rather
than the content of their rosters, it's
time for teams to wise up and realize
just how vital the history of their uni
forms is to their image and mar
ketability. and to the fans who keep
the industry alive.
