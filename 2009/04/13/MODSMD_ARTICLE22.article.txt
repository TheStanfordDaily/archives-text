just five hits in Friday's defeat,

Bears. Cal (2N-12. 5-4 Pac-10)
initiated the scoring, bringing
sophomore Valerie Arioto
across the plate after she had
advanced on a base knock with
no outs. Penna struck out the
Bears' next two batters, but a
wild pitch allowed freshman

games to Cal, but looks to rebound
during its encounter with the Broncos,
who have lost their last 15 straight.
After leaving 10 runners stranded on
base against the Bears, the Cardinal
will aim to capitalize on a less-than
stellai Santa Clara defense

Koutz singled to open the frame, but was replaced on the base
paths by fellow sophomore Autumn Albers. Freshman Maya
Burns laced a double to right field, putting two in scoring posi
tion with no outs. Sophomore Brittany Minder was then hit by a
I -0 pitch to load the bases.
Seemingly out of luck. Arioto found a way to dial in. She struck
out freshman Sarah I lassman.then downed Stanford's dangerous
top of the order. When all was said and done. Stanford produced
just one run.a sacrifice fly by junior Alissa I laber to score Albers.
Just the third loss of the year for Penna. the Miami native
struck out a dozen Bear batters and finished off her 26th complete
game of the year. Notching 12 strikeouts in the meeting. Penna
moved into the nation's top 30 all-time for Ks in her career.

ticulated the challenge posed by Pac 10 play.

Senior pitcher Missy Penna's 12 strikeouts were not enough to save Stanford in Fri
day's meeting with the Bears, as the Cardinal lost 3-1. Stanford dropped again to
Cat on Saturday, 8-6
Sophomore Ashley Chinn
relieved Penna after the senior
allowed three runs off four hits in one
inning pitched. Cal's offense picked
up where it left off when Chinn took
the circle, though: the Bears tagged
the sophomore for five more runs (in
11 hits. The 15 hits mark the most
against Stanford since March 3.2(K)7.
Stanford trailed 6-1 after six
innings, but tied the game on a bar
rage of offense in the seventh. Nine
Cardinal hits, including three from
freshman Ashley I lansen. culminat
ed in an eventual losing effort.
Cal captured the win on Saturday
in the bottom of the seventh with a
home run. With one on base. Kelly
belted a rope to center field and over
the surrounding fence, helping Cal
come back to best the Cardinal in the
season series.
Stanford's biggest failure of the
weekend was its inability to capitalize
on a lackluster defensive effort from
Cal. The home team committed five
errors on the day. but Stanford left 10
runners on base, including five strand
ed in scoring position Saturday.
Stanford's twin losses at Cal repre
sent the first time this year that the
Card has suffered back-to-back
