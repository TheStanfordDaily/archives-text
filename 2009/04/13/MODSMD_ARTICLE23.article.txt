GAME NOTES) Andrew Luck will quarterback
the White team, while Tavita Pritchard will
lead the Cardinal squad. With only two
healthy passers on the roster, the coaching
staffs for the respective sides used their first
picks on quarterbacks, with Luck going first
and Pritchard going second. The contest will
be played under regular game conditions,
but with slight modifications; for example,
the quarterback cannot be hit while he is in
the pocket.

Stanford's annual spring football
game will be played tonight at 7 p.m.
at Stanford Stadium, marking the
conclusion of two sessions of prac
tices that spanned from the end of
February through the beginning of
April.
The contest divides the team into
two squads — White and Cardinal
— with half of the coaching staff
leading each side. D.J. Durkin. the
special teams and defensive ends
coach, will head the White team,
(ireg Roman, the newest addition to
the Stanford staff — he is the current
running game coordinator, as well as
the tight ends and offensive tackles
coach — will lead the Cardinal.
'ITie teams were decided via a
draft that occurred last week, with
the White team picking first by virtue
of a coin flip. Head coach Jim Har
baugh. who presided over the draft,
said the reason for it was to create
the "most competitive atmosphere
possible" during the game.
The White team chose quarter
back Andrew Luck, who will be a
redshirt freshman in the fall.with the
first pick. The highly touted signal
caller is currently in a two-man battle
for the starting quarterback job with
Tav ita Pritchard.The Cardinal squad
took Pritchard — a redshirt senior
next season and last year's starter —
with the second selection. Luck and
Pritchard are the only two healthy
quarterbacks on the roster.
The rules of the game are general
ly consistent with those of regular, in
season contests, but v\ ith notable ex
ceptions. For example, there is punt
ing but no punt returns, there are
mandatory fair catches and quarter
backs cannot be hit unless they leave
the pocket if they remain there,
then a defender can "tackle" them
simply by grabbing their jersey with
both hands.
The spring game will be broadcast
on the K/.SU-3 Internet stream. Ad
mission is free for all students, and
2(H) 1 ) Red /one memorabilia will be
handed out at Gate 3.
