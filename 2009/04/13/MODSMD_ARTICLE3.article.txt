# Gobaud, de la Torre are execs
## Candidates claim victory in landslide 
### THE DAILY ASSU ELECTIONS TEAM 
David Gobaud '08 M.S. '10 had more
than his 25th birthday to celebrate
Saturday. Gobaud and running mate Jay
de la Torre '10 picked up almost twice as
many votes as runners-up Bennett Mauser
TO and Matt Sprague '10, winning the
ASSU Executive Race 3.190 to 1,666 votes
in the second round.
Following the announcement, de la
Torre, with tears in his eyes, hugged down
a line of eager supporters. The newly pro
claimed ASSU Vice President wavered
from disbelief to uncontrolled joy as he
delivered one tight embrace after another.
"I'm a little emotional right now." he
said. 10 minutes after the results were pub
licized. "I'm on cloud nine here. I can't
really describe how I feel."
More reserved, second-time candidate
Gobaud accepted congratulations from his
running mate then stood by shocked as
well wishers offered their congratulations.
It was just one year ago when Gobaud,
who run for Executive previously with
Greg Goldgof '08. was on the losing slate
at elections night, congratulating
Executives Jonnv Dorsey '09 and Fagan
Harris'o9.
"[Winning is) a great honor, and we
accept this with gratitude." he said. "It was
a long race with many highs and lows, but
Ben [Mauser] and Matt [Sprague] are
great people, and we look forward to
working with them this year without a
doubt."
All eyes were on Gobaud and de la
Torre after the initial vote count was
released, which had the Gohaud/de la
Torre slate at 3.055 votes and the Hauser-
Sprague slate at 1.546 votes. With the office
nearly assured, Gobaud still held his
breath until the final tally was revealed.
"In preparation. I told myself,'l'm not
going to win. I'm not going to win."" de la
Torre said, though he couldn't control his
excitement once he was declared the vic
tor. Gobaud and de la Torre immediately
cut through the crowd to shake hands with
the second-place slate. Mauser and
Sprague.

ment to the Stanford Store.
"We ran in this because we both want
ed to help Stanford, and I think that's still
possible." Sprague added.
Mauser said his slate's defeat came in
part due to its failure to win big endorse
ments. which he acknowledged "played a
big role." Gobaud and de la Torre were
endorsed by the current Executives Jonnv
Dorsey '09 and Fagan Harris '09, the
Queer Coalition and The Stanford Daily
Editorial Board, among other groups.
But Gobaud attributed his win to his
election team, not his endorsements.
"Endorsements are important but real
ly we have an amazing team that without
them this wouldn't have been possible." he
said.
I lauser called on his supporters to give
the new ASSU administration their lull

backing, despite Saturday's results.
Ile pointed out that about 35 percent of
students who selected the slate as their
first choice did not vote for Gobaud and de
la Torre in the final round.
"We have to be coming together 100
percent." Mauser said.

After the election-day excitement had
calmed down. Gobaud was still surprised
by the results.
"We thought the race was very close."
he said. "[Sprague] and [Hauser| are great
guys, and they ran a great campaign. We
were nervous to the last minute."
Mauser and Sprague were equally
unsure of the outcome before the final
moment.
"It was impossible to predict the final
outcome — it seemed like everyone had a
different opinion about how things were
looking." Hauser wrote in an email to The

asked about the success of his cam
paign. again attributing the slate's
victory to the work of the election
team, which he estimated at over KM)

After the election-day excitement had
calmed down. Gobaud was still surprised
by the results.

he said. "[Sprague] and [Hauser| are great
guys, and they ran a great campaign. We
were nervous to the last minute."

unsure of the outcome before the final
moment.

10P AGUSTIN RAMIREZ/The Stanford Da ly: Jay de la Torre '10 can't
hold back the tears as he and running mate David Gobaud '08
M.S. '10 claim victory as ASSU Executives for the 2009-2010
academic year. The slate won with 3,055 total votes.
BOTTOM AGUSTIN RAMIREZ/The Stanford Daily Bennett Hauser '10
and Matt Sprague '10 look on as results are read out in the CoHo.
Hauser attributed the loss to his slate's failure to win major endorse
ments, as well as to the disparity in graduate voting.
Daily. "We always considered our
selves the underdogs in this election.
David came so close to winning last
year, and we knew that experience
gave him a big advantage.
Nonetheless, we were excited about
the challenge."
Gobaud remained humble when
asked about the success of his cam
paign. again attributing the slate's
victory to the work of the election
team, which he estimated at over KM)
undergraduate and graduate stu
dents.
"This year, we had a great team,
and that's why we won," Gobaud
said. "Jay and 1 arc just two people
— we can't be in 100 places at once.
Hie team came together behind our
platform and really believed in it.
and they were able to explain it well
to other people.They convinced a lot
of people that we could do great
things."
Hauser and Sprague also
acknowledged the Gobaud/de la
Torre slate's advantage in appealing
to graduate students, noting that the

winning slate had 1.077 graduate
votes as compared to the 284 for
Hauser/Sprague.
"From a statistical perspective, we
performed around the same as
Dorsey/Harris among the graduate
community in their race against
David Gobaud last year, which is
exactly what we were aiming for."
Hauser said. "Clearly, since David is
an older graduate student, most
grads probably felt as though he was
better able to understand and repre
sent their issues."
For their first act as ASSU
Executive, Gobaud and de la Torre
are already looking toward next
year. They have opened up applica
tions for next year's ASSU
Executive Cabinet, which can be
found online at
assu.stanford.edu/apply.
The slate especially looks forward
to shaping the University and stu
dent life during the 2009-2010 aca
demic year.
"We're excited to unite the stu
dent body and share priorities,"
Gobaud said. "Sustainability, campus
wellness, diversity, making the budg
et cut process transparent — there
are so many things to do. and it's
such an exciting time to be working
on them."
