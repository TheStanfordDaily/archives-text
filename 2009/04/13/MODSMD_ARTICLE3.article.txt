### THE DAILY ASSU ELECTIONS TEAM 
David Gobaud '08 M.S. '10 had more
than his 25th birthday to celebrate
Saturday. Gobaud and running mate Jay
de la Torre '10 picked up almost twice as

TO and Matt Sprague '10, winning the
ASSU Executive Race 3.190 to 1,666 votes
in the second round.
Following the announcement, de la
Torre, with tears in his eyes, hugged down
a line of eager supporters. The newly pro

from disbelief to uncontrolled joy as he
delivered one tight embrace after another.
"I'm a little emotional right now." he
said. 10 minutes after the results were pub
licized. "I'm on cloud nine here. I can't
really describe how I feel."
More reserved, second-time candidate
Gobaud accepted congratulations from his
running mate then stood by shocked as
well wishers offered their congratulations.
It was just one year ago when Gobaud,
who run for Executive previously with
Greg Goldgof '08. was on the losing slate
at elections night, congratulating
Executives Jonnv Dorsey '09 and Fagan
Harris'o9.
"[Winning is) a great honor, and we
accept this with gratitude." he said. "It was
a long race with many highs and lows, but
Ben [Mauser] and Matt [Sprague] are
great people, and we look forward to
working with them this year without a
doubt."
All eyes were on Gobaud and de la
Torre after the initial vote count was
released, which had the Gohaud/de la
Torre slate at 3.055 votes and the Hauser-
Sprague slate at 1.546 votes. With the office
nearly assured, Gobaud still held his
breath until the final tally was revealed.
"In preparation. I told myself,'l'm not
going to win. I'm not going to win."" de la
Torre said, though he couldn't control his
excitement once he was declared the vic
tor. Gobaud and de la Torre immediately
cut through the crowd to shake hands with
the second-place slate. Mauser and
Sprague.

ment to the Stanford Store.
"We ran in this because we both want
ed to help Stanford, and I think that's still
possible." Sprague added.
Mauser said his slate's defeat came in
part due to its failure to win big endorse
ments. which he acknowledged "played a
big role." Gobaud and de la Torre were
endorsed by the current Executives Jonnv
Dorsey '09 and Fagan Harris '09, the
Queer Coalition and The Stanford Daily
Editorial Board, among other groups.
But Gobaud attributed his win to his
election team, not his endorsements.
"Endorsements are important but real
ly we have an amazing team that without
them this wouldn't have been possible." he
said.

the new ASSU administration their lull

backing, despite Saturday's results.

students who selected the slate as their
first choice did not vote for Gobaud and de
la Torre in the final round.

first round after receiving 265 votes.
After the election-day excitement had
calmed down. Gobaud was still surprised
by the results.
"We thought the race was very close."
he said. "[Sprague] and [Hauser| are great
guys, and they ran a great campaign. We
were nervous to the last minute."
Mauser and Sprague were equally
unsure of the outcome before the final
moment.
"It was impossible to predict the final
outcome â€” it seemed like everyone had a
different opinion about how things were
looking." Hauser wrote in an email to The
