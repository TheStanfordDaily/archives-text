# ASSU ELECTIONS
## All groups are awarded special fees 44 organizations applied for funding 
### ZOE RICHARDS STAFF WRITER 
Despite the economic reces
sion. which may have cast doubts
regarding student support for spe
cial fees, all special fees funding
requests on this year's ballot
passed. The success of all 44
organizations is unprecedented
in the past 10 elections, nine of
which report special fees results,
at least one group failed to garner

a large enough constituency to
pass.
Special fees are an imperative
source of funding for many regis
tered student groups to collect
funding that cannot he covered
through the general fees budget.
In order to receive special fees,
each group needs over 50 percent
of "ves" votes on its ballot, indi
cating the voter's support ot fund
ing for the individual group.
Even K/.SI the Stanford siu
dent radio station, which was
dropped from special fees last
year, received 63.53 percent sup
port from undergraduate voters,
securing funding for the upcoming
academic vear.

According to K/SU Chief
Sports Engineer Kevin Danna '09.
the radio station changed its strat
egy b\ running for undergraduate
special fees as opposed to request
ing fees from both the undergrad
uate and graduate communities.
The joint ballot is generally con
sidered harder to pass.
Among the top five most sup
ported organizations, each receiv
ing over SO percent of the "yes"
vote from students, were the
Sexual Health Peer Resource
Center (SIII'RC). Student
Initiated Courses (SIC). Stanford
Club Sports. The Stanford Daily
and The Bridge Peer Counseling
Center. Managing to snateh just
under 90 percent of voters' sup
port, the SHPRC remains among
the top priorities for special fees
funding for students in the 2009-
2010 academic year.

Commissioner Brians Tatum '11
reflected on the overwhelming
support that Stanford students
showed for groups seeking special
fees this year.
"I'm very happy because
[groups seeking special fees]
worked very hard," Tatum said.
"They want their organizations to
receive special fees so they can
secure their own goals — it's a
very good thing for Stanford that
all of the special fees passed."
