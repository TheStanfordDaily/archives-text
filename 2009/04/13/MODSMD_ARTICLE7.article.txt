## Zimride partners with Zipcar for environment 
### NICK MCINTYRE 
ITie recent merger of ride-sharing
software startup Zimride and car
sharing service Zipcar looks to
expand and streamline community
transportation on the Farm. The two
companies, united by goals and allit
eration. saw the partnership as a nat
ural progression in their attempts to
reduce the environmental impacts of
driving alone.
"The two names are really
frickin' similar." joked Zimride Co-
Founder and COO John
Zimmerman at an event last
Thursday sponsored by Stanford
Future Social Innovators Network.
He mentioned that he first reached
out to Zipcar Chairman and CEO
Scott Griffith six months ago with
the idea of pooling resources after
asking the question. "Who else has
changed behavior in this transporta
tion space?"
Zimride currently uses social net
working. at no cost to the user, to
unite travelers with common desti
nations and subsequently arrange
car pools. Zipcar. on the other hand,
is the premier ridesharing company
on campus and in other locations
across the U.S.. providing those with
out automobiles access to cars and
ride sharing.
Nearly 1,500 members of the
Stanford Facebook network current
ly use the Zimride application — a
number Zimmerman hopes to
increase by cross-promotion on the
Zipcar and Zimride Web sites.
"It's great we prove [the business
model] a few times, but investors
want to see it more." Zimmerman
said.
The business model Zimmerman
referred to involves taking
"Facebook's social infrastructure
and building roads on it." In the cur
rent application, students are con
nected to other users in their univer
sity's Facebook network and can
request or offer rides. Having
entered a starting location and an
ending location, the application's
algorithm matches passengers with

drivers via a partnership with
Google Maps.
At Cornell University,
Zimmerman's alma mater, the net
work amassed 3.000 Zimride users in
the first six months, setting the cam
pus well on its way to reaching what
he described as "critical mass."
"By focusing on college, universi
ty and corporate communities, we
are able to build the critical mass of
users necessary to sustain Zimride as
a reliable form of transportation."
reads the Zimride Web site. "Our
approach leverages social trust and
hands-on marketing efforts to deliv
er significant savings for schools and
corporations of various sizes and
commute profiles."
Furthermore, while the Zimride
FAQ Web page states that the serv
ice is 100 percent free for users,
Stanford pays an annual fee of about
$10,000 for the service.
While some Stanford students
were already satisfied with the exist
ing car-sharing plan on campus, they
remained doubtful if the partnership
would add anything to the carpool
ing dynamic. Current Zipcar user
Quinn Slack '11 is satisfied with his
current car-sharing plan, and doesn't
intend to change it.
"I get all of the benefits of having
a car on campus without paying for
the car. insurance, parking, gas and
maintenance." Slack said. "Running
errands, which are not regular trips .
.. would be inconvenient to tailor to
two people's schedules."
iiiere are also concerns regarding
the ambiguities associated with
Zimride and the awkwardness of
ride compensation. Currently, car
poolers are left to hammer out an
agreement, which may be a strange
activity among strangers.
"Usually when I go on like a Wal-
Mart or Safeway run. at least two of
us go. so that's like four bucks a per
son. which 1 don't think is too bad."
said Zipcar user Dariusz Wodziak '11.
Furthermore, despite the added
safety measure of allowing Zimride
users to view driver and passenger
Facebook profiles before riding.

some Stanford students are wary of
the prospect of riding with a
stranger.
"Even though I'd be sharing with
Stanford students, I don't really like
the idea of just going online and
searching for people to come with
me." Wodziak said. "Safety plays a
role in my decision when it comes to
complete strangers."
In response to questions about
safety. Zimmerman acknowledged
the challenges of creating a comfort
able community of ride-sharers.
"I think there's a level for every
one." he said, explaining that some
Zimride users are only likely to
share rides with friends or mutual
friends, not their entire university
network.
Yet he remained optimistic for
the future of Zimride in light of its
new partnership with Zipcar.
Zimmerman believes the partner
ship may highlight a change in
behavior and in the way people view
transportation, summing up his 10-
year vision for the company in a sim
ple phrase.
"I could take the train or I could
Zimride."
