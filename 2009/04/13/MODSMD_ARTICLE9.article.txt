## Energy plan pushes green Farm 
### JENNY REMPEL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford has long been commit
ted to action on the issues of energy
use and climate change, hut has
lagged behind some of its peers in
setting distinct goals for reducing
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
Now, the Department of
Sustainability and Energy
Management has completed a final
draft of the Stanford Energy and
Climate Plan, which, once approved,
will produce GHG reduction recom
mendations.
The document, which will be
released to the general public upon
approval, contains a detailed analy
sis of the University's options for
addressing an institutional commit
ment to climate action.
"The Office of Sustainability and
Utilities staff... are at their last
stride in putting forth recommenda
tions to the President and Provost
for final decision making," said
Fahmida Ahmed, manager of

Sustainability Programs at Stanford.
The report contains an inventory of
current campus energy uses and
emissions, and forecasts future ener
gy demand with regard to continued
campus growth. Importantly, it pro
vides several options for emission
reduction, attaching a price tag to
each.
After testing over 35 different
projects, the team decided to focus
the University's efforts on reducing
energy demand, finding cleaner
energy sources and adhering to
greener building standards. More
specifically, the plan recommends
heat recovery through a new system
of gas boilers and electric chillers
that will replace the campus cogen
eration plant built in the 1980s.
Other options include major build
ing retrofits, more efficient demand
side energy management, sustain
able IT projects with a focus on
more efficient servers and substan
tial investment in green energy, such
as wind or solar power.
"We could write the check the

other direction." Ahmed said of
buying carbon credits, "but we want
the innovation and applications to
stay here on campus to effectively
manage and ensure their efficiency."
Now that the Energy and
Climate Plan document is largely
completed, it has been passed onto
members of the GIIG Blue Ribbon
Task Force for review and recom
mendation of campus GIIG reduc
tion goals. This task force was creat
ed in May 2(M)X to develop potential
reduction goal strategies and to con
sider the efficacy of using renewable
energy credits or other options for
GHG reduction. Currently it con
sists of Professors Jim Sweeney,
Lynn Orr. Larry Goulder, John
Weyant, Roland Home and Joseph
Stagner. executive director of
Sustainability and Energy
Management.
"We have shown in the study
what is possible," Ahmed said. "The
decision on goal setting now belongs
to the Blue Ribbon Task Force, and
ultimately to the President."
"Stanford's climate plan is com
plex and thorough. We wanted to do
the due diligence around all consid
erations involved — resource avail
ability and pricing, existing infra
structure and. of course, emissions
reduction." Ahmed added. "We feel
a sense of urgency about climate
action, but we wanted to develop
realistic, long term and innovative
solutions, and that takes time and
research to identify."
This sense of urgency is mount
ing throughout California due to
Assembly Bill 32, which requires the
entire state to reduce GHG emis
sions to 1990 levels by 2020. Interest
has also been growing on campus as
student organizations increase pres
sure on the University to commit to
greater climate action.
At their meeting on March 10.
the ASSU Undergraduate Senate
unanimously passed a resolution
expressing its support for reducing
emissions at least SO percent below
1990 levels by 2050.
The resolution comes as "an aspi
ration for eventual carbon-neutrali
ty." and its authors argue that the
University has "a responsibility to
reassert its role as a global leader in
campus sustainability and environ
mental stewardship."
Seth Silverman, a coterminal stu
dent in civil and environmental
energy who has been pushing for a
campus-wide climate plan for the
past few years, was particularly
pleased with the up swell of
momentum behind this issue.
"The current population of stu
dents and young Stanford commu
nity members prioritize this issue
across the board," Silverman said.
•This is an essential challenge. It's
part of keeping Stanford competi

tive and keeping students ready to
go out into a world that will be
eventually carbon constrained."
Students for a Sustainable
Stanford have also refocused their
energies on pushing for aggressive
emissions reductions. They will be
holding a Town I kill meeting to dis
cuss the University's climate and
energy plan tonight from 7-9 p.m. in

Old Union Room 216.
"It's really an educational
event," said Eli Pollak '12. "We're
looking at it as a way for students to
get re-involved, reenergized and re
interested in the process of grass
roots campus support."
