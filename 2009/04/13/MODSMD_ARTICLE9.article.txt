## Energy plan pushes green Farm 
### JENNY REMPEL SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford has long been commit
ted to action on the issues of energy
use and climate change, hut has
lagged behind some of its peers in
setting distinct goals for reducing
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
Now, the Department of
Sustainability and Energy
Management has completed a final
draft of the Stanford Energy and
Climate Plan, which, once approved,
will produce GHG reduction recom
mendations.
The document, which will be
released to the general public upon
approval, contains a detailed analy
sis of the University's options for
addressing an institutional commit
ment to climate action.
"The Office of Sustainability and
Utilities staff... are at their last
stride in putting forth recommenda
tions to the President and Provost
for final decision making," said
Fahmida Ahmed, manager of

Sustainability Programs at Stanford.
The report contains an inventory of
current campus energy uses and
emissions, and forecasts future ener
gy demand with regard to continued
campus growth. Importantly, it pro
vides several options for emission
reduction, attaching a price tag to
each.
After testing over 35 different
projects, the team decided to focus
the University's efforts on reducing
energy demand, finding cleaner
energy sources and adhering to
greener building standards. More
specifically, the plan recommends
heat recovery through a new system
of gas boilers and electric chillers
that will replace the campus cogen
eration plant built in the 1980s.
Other options include major build
ing retrofits, more efficient demand
side energy management, sustain
able IT projects with a focus on
more efficient servers and substan
tial investment in green energy, such
as wind or solar power.
"We could write the check the

other direction." Ahmed said of
buying carbon credits, "but we want
the innovation and applications to
stay here on campus to effectively
manage and ensure their efficiency."
Now that the Energy and
Climate Plan document is largely
completed, it has been passed onto
members of the GIIG Blue Ribbon
Task Force for review and recom
mendation of campus GIIG reduc
tion goals. This task force was creat
ed in May 2(M)X to develop potential
reduction goal strategies and to con
sider the efficacy of using renewable
energy credits or other options for
GHG reduction. Currently it con

"We have shown in the study
what is possible," Ahmed said. "The
decision on goal setting now belongs
