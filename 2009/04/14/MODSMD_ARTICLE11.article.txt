# Crime and Punishment
## Existential engineering 
### 
Fans of Stanford Professor Gil Masters
and environmentalist author Edward
Abbey have probably heard Abbey's
exhortation to humanness — " fie as I am
a reluctant enthusiast... a part-time crusad
er, a half-hearted fanatic. ... It is not enough
to fight for the land; it is even more important
to enjoy it" (1975).
Iliis sentiment punched me in the face
several times this weekend while disguised as
conversation, mountains and stars. Painful,
yes; but my soul was growing sluggish and
needed a good call to action.
It is convenient during these periods of
soul-sluggishness to have a very good friend
who also happens to be a mountain-dwelling
hippie in Colorado. More convenient still
when said friend is open to the idea of you
inviting yourself over with three days' notice.
So I flew to Denver and then went the 50
miles west and up.
It's amazing what a purple-black skv. a
coyly full moon, and a few pine trees can do.
When you find yourself suddenly stopped
dead in the darkness, gasping for breath and
staring at a sky that has actually taken your
life — not by killing you. but by taking and
holding your life for a moment before the life
rushes back into your body.crisper and fuller.
Hie sky working by catching you. pulling the
vital functions entirely out of you and an
choring them in itself.
W hen mountains are gray and green and
alive, and when rocks are the natural exten
sion of streams, and when it starts to snow,
then rain,then both.then hail.and then when
everything explodes into a blue sky — that is
when you know there's something worth liv
ing for.
Sometimes a passion isn't quite enough
I love looking at dams, reservoirs, power
plants and transmission lines as much as the
next engineer, to be sure. I am one of the for

tunate ones able to spend my time studying
something I actually do love. And yet? Ener
gy infrastructlire,climate policy,all the rest of
it — it isn't what makes being human worth
while.
That's where the green-streaked rock
faces of Death Valley, the smooth boulders of
Boulder and the fact that Orion is more than
just a three-star belt all start to come in.
On some level. I think an engineer's high
est calling is to protect the poets and the writ
ers, the painters and the philosophers. It's dif
ficult to encourage the study of the incredible
things the human brain can produce if every
family needs six people working the land just
to keep food on the table.
That is modern science's great contribu
tion. it seems; we have managed to bring our
selves to a point where it is understood that
people may productively engage in work that
increases quality of life rather than work
that, at best, ensures prolonged presence of
life.
We can study free will: we can study cul
ture: we can study beauty.
Fossil fuels were definitely good for at
least one thing: they fueled human creativity
by increasing what we were able to do. It is
because we found cheap, easily-burned fuels
in the earth itself that we were able to devote
resources to things like medical research, to
book preservation, to schools and to muse
ums.
That we were able to start sending both
girls and boys to school.That the concept of a
liberal education exists —just the fact that
graduating from Stanford signifies you've
had three quarters of I HUM and probably
no animal husbandry shows that our in
creased use of energy has allowed us to spend
more time being human.
Something else that fossil energy provid
ed us: time and expertise needed to create

better technologies.
Fossil fuels were necessarily a bridge tech
nology, and developing the global economy
in a fossil fuel-dependent way has had some
major positive impacts on human life, mostly
because it revolutionized our ability to have
as much energy as desired when we need it.
how we need it.
But it is time to move on from there. Im
perfections can always be improved upon —
the fossil energy structure is not providing
the world with many huge new opportunities
at this point, largely because of the pollution
associated with it. It has served its purpose
and enabled us to get as far as we have, but ul
timately. we will have no choice but to move
on to something better.
To let the sky keep control of its own col
ors.
To let the mountains continue to host
most of the world's rivers.
To allow us to study beauty and truth in
stead of mitigation strategies and Superfund
sites.
Because after all. I became an engineer
because I want to help solve problems that
no one will ever have to solve again because
they won't he problems anymore.
First step: Let's go stare at a mountain.

looking up walking directions to national
parks on Google Maps again. (let in on it by
