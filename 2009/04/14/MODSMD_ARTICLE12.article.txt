## Grad student diversity is everyone's problem 
### 
A friend of mine once told me that the so
lution to America's lack of environ
mental conviction was simple — instill
in children a love of nature. I le thought if par
ents took their kids to see the Redwoods or
Bryce Canyon, the children would develop a
sense of environmental responsibility. This atti
tude, while simplistic, stresses an important
point — without concrete and articulated
knowledge of what is worth saving, or worth
cultivating, we lack the will to do what is right.
For issues like environmentalism. increasing
awareness can be quite pleasant: other issues,
such as race and gender disparities in science
and engineering programs are often painful to
discuss. They require an honest disclosure of
deeply ingrained biases in our society, our I Jni
versitv and oftentimes ourselves. Consequent
ly. they are rarely discussed in a meaningful
way, and the will necessary to address the issue
is not developed.
We have a problem at Stanford when it
comes to minority enrollment. Iliis may sur
prise some readers because representation at
the undergraduate level is close to U.S. aver
ages.and foreign nationals make up a large por
tion of the graduate population. However,
when we look at numbers for women, blacks.
I atinos and Native Americans in the graduate
science and engineering communitythe story is
much worse.
A place like Stanford offers us ;i unique
view of the problem. We sit near the top of en
gineering's intellectual pyramid; from here we
see the cumulative effect of more than 20 years
of unequal education. Reasonable people ma>
disagree on solutions and their implementa
tions, but given our point of view, it is clear that
there is a problem.
It is a problem when our nation is 51 percent
female and women comprise only 21 percent of
our engineering I'lil) candidates. It is a prob
lem when our American I'lil) candidates are
1.3 percent black and 1.6 percent I lispanic ac
cording to 2(X)5 enrollment numbers. In ab
solutes, that corresponds to P> black and 23
Hispanic I'lil) candidates in the entire School
of I ngineering. Proportional representation
drops by a factor of five for both blacks and
Latinos between the undergraduate and Phi)
level. The term leakv pipeline is an understate

ment in the face of such numbers.
Iliese statistics reflect the harsh reality that
women and minorities face more obstacles on
the path to becoming a scientist or engineer
than their white male colleagues. Yes. some of
these obstacles exist outside of Stanford and
impact these groups from an early age. but to
use that as excuse for disengagement is negli
gent and cynical.There are specific areas vv here
Stanford could make a difference.Take recruit
ment. for instance. On average, only 24 black
and 25 Hispanic Americans apply to Stanford
PhD programs in engineering each year. Un
dergraduate numbers tell us that there are sig
nificantly more qualified applicants out there.
So whv aren't they applying to Stanford? It is
important to cultivate an applicant pool that
does not overlook segments of society: Stan
ford's inability to recruit outside the conven
tional sphere is disappointing.
There are multiple reasons why we should
work hard to increase the representation of mi
norities in the sciences and engineering. It is
worth reiterating here that the I IS. is in danger
of falling behind in the competitive global tech
nology market as countries like China and
India further develop their infrastructures. It is
also worth notinn that 5> percent of Stanford's

engineering PhD candidates were foreign na
tionals in 2005. Drawing on a broader spec
trum of our domestic population is essential to
keep pace in the global science R&D race. Still,
we need to move beyond this paradigm.Those
of us pursuing I'hDs in a technical field should
acknowledge that we work in a community
whose makeup is influenced by longstanding
cultural biases. A solution to this problem re
quires work done at all levels of our education
al system, and each of lis has a role to play
We have a problem at Stanford, but it is not
exclusively a problem for women, blacks or
I .atinos. It is everyone's problem. We cannot ex
pect that an issue as deeph ingrained as this
could be solved by IV) black PhD students
spread across nine departments. No. all of us
must do our part. Ik- active, ask your depart
ment chairs it any minority candidates were in
terviewed in the latest faculty search Find out
what theapplicant pool of your program looked
like last year.This doesn't have to be your full
time job. but let those whose job it is know that
you support progress in this area, l.et them
know that the w ill exists to get something done.
