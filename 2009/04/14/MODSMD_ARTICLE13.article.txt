thought things couldn't get any
worse, Fearnow struck out two bat
ters in the seventh and put the Cal
defense back on the field. Stanford
then proceeded to bring up nine
more batters and score four more
runs before the inning ended.
Along with Stanford's hitting suc

came together for the team's win.
Starter Snodgress allowed only two
runs on four hits and two strikeouts,
with no walks over three innings

runs over two innings pitched. The
final two pitchers sealed the deal for
the Cardinal; sophomore Michael
Marshall allowed no runs and one
hit in the sixth, followed by three
scoreless frames from Fearnow to

"Anything I can do to get the

ball down this week, hopefully we
will be successful."
The comeback win gives the Car

Sophomore catcher Zach Jones was one of many Cardinal baserunners yesterday, as Stanford pounded Cal pitchers with 1 3 runs between the
sixth and eighth innings to pull away for the win. The victory is Stanford's 1 Oth in its last 13 games, pushing its season record over .500.
in the lead for the first time. Then, a
smattering of RBIs from several
Stanford players put the Cardinal up
10-4.
Just when the Golden Bears
thought things couldn't get any
worse, Fearnow struck out two bat
ters in the seventh and put the Cal
defense back on the field. Stanford
then proceeded to bring up nine
more batters and score four more
runs before the inning ended.
Along with Stanford's hitting suc
cess. the Cardinal's pitching staff
came together for the team's win.
Starter Snodgress allowed only two
runs on four hits and two strikeouts,
with no walks over three innings
pitched. Danny Sandbrink came in
for some relief and allowed just two
runs over two innings pitched. The
final two pitchers sealed the deal for
the Cardinal; sophomore Michael
Marshall allowed no runs and one
hit in the sixth, followed by three
scoreless frames from Fearnow to
wrap up the victory.
"Anything I can do to get the
team the win." Fearnow said of his
efforts. "If you throw strikes like we
did today, we are hound to give up a
few runs. Momentum is everything
in baseball. If we can just keep the
ball down this week, hopefully we
will be successful."
The comeback win gives the Car
dinal some momentum going into
tomorrow's game at Santa C lara and
this weekend's road trip to Arizona

The right-fielder put the Cardinal on the
board with a double in the fifth for his first
RBI; smashed a three-run. standup triple in
the seventh: and hit a two-run single in the
eighth to boost his team-leading season RBI

"I was seeing the ball well today." Kiils
gaard said."We're all hitting the ball well. We
know that Cal can hit. and I give a lot of the
credit to our pitching staff. They really shut
them down. Also.the team did really well gel

when I got up."
The winning pitcher was senior right-han
