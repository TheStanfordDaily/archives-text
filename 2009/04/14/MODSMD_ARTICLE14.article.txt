years playing for Stanford and playing
on four different teams.'" Nguyen said.

we've battled through so much."

captains for this year's squad — was
greeted with a surprise visit from three
former teammates.

when I was a freshman come watch,"

photos on the wall from when I was a
freshman. It's funny to think thai they
were in my position when I was just starl
ing."

were so supportive and there to share the
moment with me." she added.
