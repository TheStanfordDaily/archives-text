### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Despite the speeter of winter
quarter finals looming, five
Stanford athletes took to
Ma in moth Mountain on
March 14 to represent the ( ardinal at
the 2009 Red Hull Snow War/.
It ended up being a normal jump
at the not so normal ski and snow
boarding competition that was the
highlight ol the weekend for Stanford.
Going a bit too last on the second
jump of the freestyle course, freshman
I.ucyann Murray, and her snowboard,
flew straight past the landing point.
Murrary's folly turned to fortune,
though it happened to be her
biggest jumpol the whole weekend.
"I thought it was hilarious." Murray
said. "I probably took about feet in
the air before I hit the ground. I guess
you could call that an accomplish
merit."
though that may have been her sin
gular highlight for the weekend. Mur
ray's feats didn't stop there: the fresh
man was named the top female com
petitorat the event, which drew nearly
3(H) college students from 52 schools.
As a whole, the live ( ardinal repre

sentativcs Murray, senior Clayton
Kcnncy. sophomore Mike Ortiz and
graduate students Aaron Harness and
Wes Smith came up just shy of qual
ifying for the final round. I he compe
tition. however, wasn't so much about
the results: after all. most events don't
use the letter /. to signify plural usage.
"It was still a contest, but people
were dressing up." said Kenney, de
scribing the competition's atmos
phere. "Some people could barely
snowboard.and it was more about get
ting a team there and hanging out, as
opposed to being really serious and
trying to win this thing. It was really
fun. It kind of felt like the first couple
days of school, when everyone's
friendly: we got to know ;ind meet a lot
ol people really quickly."
Despite failing to qualify for the
hist session, the Cardinal skiers were
pleased with their performances.
"We didn't quite make the finals,
but everyone had pretty solid runs and
had a lot of fun doing it." Kenney said.

"It was probably one of the high
lights of my season." added Murray,
who snowboards with the Squaw
Valley Snow Team. "It was a really
fun weekend: it was great traveling
with those guys down there, and we
had a lot of fun."
Cal Poly-San Luis Obispo ended
up winning the Snow Warz. which
were judged by snowboarding pro
Zach Leach, skiing pro Omar Otte
and 17-vear-old snowboarding phe
nom Forest Bailey.
Though this year marked the
fourth year of the Snow Warz com
petition. it was the first year that a
Stanford squad made it out to the
competition.
"I love snowboarding,so that was
a big part of it." kenney said of his
motivations to put together a team
this year. "I had kind of wanted to
have Stanford represent that people
ski and snowboard and still have fun
here, while studying hard. It was
kind of cool to put [a team] togeth
er."
Essentially the founder of this
year's Stanford team. Kenney hopes
that the Cardinal will continue to
field a team in the upcoming years.
"It's great if we can have people
go every year." he said. "We defi
nitely staked out a good reputation.
It would be cool if we could start a
legacy."
