# Tragic times in the sports world
## 
### 
Ivo been sitting at m\ computer
torn while, mulling ovei what to
write about this week, but I'm
stuck with a major moral dilem
ma. I really want to write about the
upcoming Nlll. playoffs, but I ;ilso
want people to read my column, so I
decided 1 should find a new subject.
The past week was a weird one in
sports. In many \va\s. it was rich with
action and excitement. I here was a
three-way playoff at the Masters on
Sunday — the same day that both
Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson
made late charges. It was also the
first full weekend of the baseball sea
son. and the last of the aforemen
tioned hockey season.
Despite these bright spots, how
ever, the overwhelming theme of the
week was tragedy.
()n Friday night. Los Angeles An
gels of Anaheim pitcher Nick Aden
hart was killed bv a drunk driver in
Orange C ounty. just hours after mak


Bohm
ing the best start of his career in his
season debut.
Then.just yesterday, I larry Kalas,
one of the most legendary voices in
all of sports and the longtime
Philadelphia Phillies broadcaster,
collapsed and died in the press box
before the Phillies' game at the
Washington Nationals.
These two tragedies put into per
spective the relative importance of
sports in the grand scheme of life.
The baseball world froze upon hear
ing of the death of Adenhart. and the
Angels' game against the Oakland
Athletics on Thursday was post
poned.
Athletes and role models are in
deed human, and many times we are
reminded of this for the wrongs rea
sons— highly publicized arrests or
divorces, for example. The passing of
these two baseball personalities, one
with his career waxing and the other
with his career waning, is a reminder
that tragedv can befall just about

anyone.
Adenhart was one of the most
likeable guys in the Angels' club
house. After going from being a top
prospect in high school to needing
Tommy John surgery and falling in
the draft, then working his way back
to being a top prospect in the Angels'
system. Adenhart overcame adversi
ty and looked to have a promising
career ahead of him.
One of the saddest parts about his
death — from a sports perspective
— is that he went out with all the up
side in the world. Just hours before
his passing, he threw six shutout in
nings, showing that he was indeed
ready to fulfill the promise that
made him such a highly touted
prospect.
kalas. on the other hand, was at
the tail end of his career when
tragedy struck. The 73-year-old had
been the Phillies' lead broadcaster
since 1 ( )7I and had also been the fa
mous voice of NFL Films since 1975.
Despite his old age. he was in
good health and spirits prior to his
passing, and it came as just as big a
surprise as Adenhart's.
like Adenhart. Kalas ended his
career at a high point. Just last sea

son. kalas had the luxury of calling
the World Series in which his Phillies
won just their second title during his
tenure.
Kalas was more than just a voice
on a television screen, though. As
former Phillie John Kruk alluded to
on ESPN yesterday, Kalas was a part
of the Phillie family. He traveled
with the team every day and took in
terest in each player that put on that
Philadelphia Phillies uniform.
His influence on broadcasters
and players alike has undoubted!)
been felt throughout baseball.
So. despite the joy that comes
with sports in spring time — the an
ticipation for NBA and NHL play
offs. the Masters and the beginning
of the MLB season — this week's
happiness has been overwhelmed b\
tragedy and reflection.
There are few real lessons to be
learned from the deaths of Adenhart
and Kalas. except that celebrities are
people too. and that sports extend
beyond the boundaries of the play
ing fields and into real life.

Daniel Bohm hopes he can write
about something happier next week
