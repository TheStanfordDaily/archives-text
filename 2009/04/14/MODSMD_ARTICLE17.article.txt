# Tragic times in the sports world
## 
### 
Ivo been sitting at m\ computer
torn while, mulling ovei what to
write about this week, but I'm
stuck with a major moral dilem
ma. I really want to write about the
upcoming Nlll. playoffs, but I ;ilso
want people to read my column, so I
decided 1 should find a new subject.
The past week was a weird one in
sports. In many \va\s. it was rich with
action and excitement. I here was a
three-way playoff at the Masters on
Sunday â€” the same day that both
Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson
made late charges. It was also the
first full weekend of the baseball sea
son. and the last of the aforemen
tioned hockey season.
Despite these bright spots, how
ever, the overwhelming theme of the
week was tragedy.
()n Friday night. Los Angeles An
gels of Anaheim pitcher Nick Aden
hart was killed bv a drunk driver in
Orange C ounty. just hours after mak


Bohm
