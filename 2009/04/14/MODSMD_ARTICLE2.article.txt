## Engineers find work abroad Student group focuses on environmental solutions 
### ANNEKE NELSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A group of Stanford engineers got
some hands-on experience over spring
break, traveling to two developing
countries in an effort to improve envi
ronmental infrastructure.
The Stanford chapter of Engineers
for a Sustainable World (ESW), a
national non-profit organization that
uses technical approaches to promote
sustainability in under-developed coun
tries, was formed in 2003.
"ESW is very similar to Engineers
Without Borders." said ESW President
Heather Bischel. a graduate student in
environmental engineering. "But we
operate pretty independently."
ESW at Stanford funds and coordi
nates a course entitled "Design for a
Sustainable World." which is meeting
this quarter to continue work on ESW
projects.
While the class consists mostly of
graduate students, it is also open it)
undergraduates who show initiative in
the projects. This year was the first in
which the class became a more compre
hensive experience, with a spring break
trip to the focal countries taking place
before the first day of class.
