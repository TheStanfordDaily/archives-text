## Engineers find work abroad Student group focuses on environmental solutions 
### ANNEKE NELSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
A group of Stanford engineers got
some hands-on experience over spring
break, traveling to two developing
countries in an effort to improve envi
ronmental infrastructure.
The Stanford chapter of Engineers
for a Sustainable World (ESW), a
national non-profit organization that
uses technical approaches to promote
sustainability in under-developed coun
tries, was formed in 2003.
"ESW is very similar to Engineers
Without Borders." said ESW President
Heather Bischel. a graduate student in
environmental engineering. "But we
operate pretty independently."
ESW at Stanford funds and coordi
nates a course entitled "Design for a
Sustainable World." which is meeting
this quarter to continue work on ESW
projects.
While the class consists mostly of
graduate students, it is also open it)
undergraduates who show initiative in
the projects. This year was the first in
which the class became a more compre
hensive experience, with a spring break
trip to the focal countries taking place
before the first day of class.
This year, the Stanford team is
working for the first time on two
simultaneous projects â€” the first
with SARAR, an organization
working in Oaxaca. Mexico, and the
other with GeoHazards
International, an organization
devoted to preparing for and pre
venting consequences of natural dis
asters currently working in
Indonesia.
The students took trips over
spring break to view the situations
in both Mexico and Indonesia first
hand. before the class started in
spring quarter.
According to GeoHazards
International, Padang, Indonesia is
the place in the world most at risk
for future tsunamis. While the
organization tries to educate the
community on the dangers of such
natural disasters, the Stanford team
is focusing on improvements to the
infrastructure and evacuation
routes in this densely populated city.
Meanwhile, while SARAR had
already developed methods of eco
sanitation in Mexico. Stanford stu
dents are working on making these
methods more efficient.
Bischel has worked with ESW
since her undergraduate years at
UC-Berkeley. and assists the course
this quarter as a teaching assistant.
She noted that the hands-on
approach taken by ESW is very
rewarding.
"1 think what's unique about
ESW is that we do these projects
that are real-world." she said. "All
the projects that are in this class
have a real impact. We apply these
designs to places where there is real
ly need."
Annalise Blum '10. one of 12
core officers of ESW. is planning on
taking ihe class next year to gain
valuable experience. She said she is
interested in sanitation projects in
Mexico.
While the national ESW organi
zation funds some of the projects.
Stanford's ESW chapter also
receives funding through the School
of Engineering and the Haas Center
for Public Service. In addition to the
class. ESW also hosts lecture series,
invites speakers and provides work
shops for the campus community to

get involved.
"It's one of the few organizations
that provide a way to help people in
other countries rather than just
fundraising." Blum said. "You never
really get to know how the money is
helping."
The next workshop, on April 23.
will he on water quality and how to
test for pathogens.
For Bischel. the project has been
a "long process of initiation," hut a
rewarding one at the same time.
"There's a lot of intrinsic motiva
tion of the people we're working
with." Bischel said. "It's challenging,
and if we try to be holistic in the way
we approach the problems, we can
actually have an impact."
