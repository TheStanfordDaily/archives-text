### CALLA HUAN SHENG STAFF WRITER 
Questions ahout how the Chinese economy will fare in
a depressing global market have been the source of much
speculation recently, but two experts expressed their opti
mism yesterday, in a panel sponsored by the Forum for
American/Chinese F.xchange at Stanford (I ACI S).
Political Science and Chinese Politics Professor Jean ()i
and Stanford Center for International Development Senior
Fellow Ronald McKinnon spoke about the future of
China's economic growth 111 front of a capacity audience of
students and scholars in Bechtcl Conference Center. Both
speakers were upbeat about China's performance in the

current economic downturn.
Oi began the discussion by contra
dicting the belief of "China in peril."
With exports falling by 25 percent a
year, and the growth rate shrinking
from 13 percent in 2007 to 6.K percent
in the first quarter of 2(X)8, many are
worried about China's export-led
growth.
Nonetheless, according to Oi. the
share of exports in Chinese GDP is
much lower than the press estimates.
Often cited as 30 percent, the figure
might be as low as 10 percent, lower
than most of Southeast Asia and
close to that of Japan and India. Oi
also noted that China's export
dependence is a recent phenomenon
concentrated in its southern part,
while "the heart of the Chinese eco
nomic miracle really started in the
countryside," and is sign of a "very
much domestically driven develop
ment model."
McKinnon concurred with Oi's

overall assessment, contending that
the true picture of Chinese economy
is far less dire than newspaper head
lines sometimes make it out to he.
"If you're a reader of The New
York Times, you'll likely get the
wrong idea," McKinnon joked, dis
missing the prospect that economic
hardships in China might lead to
social unrest.
The panel was part of the annual
FACES conference "On Common
Ground." A select group of 40 dele
gates from top colleges in U.S. and
China will be on campus April 12-17
for a series of panels and discussions
on U.S.-China relations. FACES
President Matt Platkin "() ( ) said the
conference fit with the group's main
goals.
"The goal of FACES is to bring in
a diverse group of future leaders that
are interested in issues across the
board." Platkin said.
Oi maintained her optimism
when discussing further challenges
posed by the crisis and even saw a sil
ver lining in the Chinese govern
ment's $586 billion stimulus package.
She considered the half-trillion in
stimulus monev a timelv resource for

China to renovate its infrastructure
and build much-needed railway and
high-speed tracks. The Chinese are
also gripping the opportunity to "go
up the value chain," she observed,
with their recent efforts in developing
electric cars and improving energy
efficiency.
From a financial perspective,
McKinnon assessed China's develop
ment through the years. Me com
pared the current pressure in the U.S.
Congress to appreciate the Chinese
currency to the historical "Japan
bashing" in previous decades.
McKinnon pointed out that Japan's
eventual decision to appreciate the
Yen "thoroughly destabilized the
Japanese economy and contributed
to the collapse of the global economy
in 1991.-
McKinnon also called the pro
posed policy to appreciate the Yuan
"a big mistake in political economy
and a major influence on American
policy."
Arguing against the continual rise
of the Yuan, McKinnon affirmed that
a fixed currency serves to anchor
China's domestic price levels and
contributes to more stable growth. A
pegged currency would, according to
McKinnon, check the pouring of hot
money into China, while the ever
higher value of the Yuan would slow
investment, without definitively
reducing saving.
"When you think of fixed curren
cy, you think of rigging the market,"
McKinnon said. "I think we should
call it international monetary harmo
nization."
McKinnon concluded his talk by
commending the economic policy of
the current Chinese government, lie
drew on the surge of corporate prof
itability and the expansion of com
mercial bank credits in China as evi
dence of the country's economic vital
ity, labeling ( liina as the only place in
the world where commercial banks
are expanding. I le also urged the I J.S.
to stop "China bashing" and to rely on
China to pull the world out of crisis.
Platkin felt the timing of the con
ference made the economic issues
particularly relevant.
"This year is special in a way,
because it's probably in the worst
global climate that the U.S. and ( hina
have faced since the founding of
FACES," he said. "I think that's an
interesting backdrop to host a confer
ence like this: as the panel shows, [the
issues are] on a lot of people's minds."
