## Civil War scholar examines pivotal conflict 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Distinguished historian James McPherson
spoke last night at a crowded Kresge Auditorium
about the turbulence that characterized the
American Civil War and Reconstruction Ira.
McPherson, a professor emeritus of American
history at Princeton University, is the acclaimed
author of 15 books and the recipient of numerous
accolades, including the Pulitzer Prize and
Lincoln Prize. In his lecture, "But There Was No
Peace: The Aftermath of the Civil War."
McPherson first expounded on the ironies found

in the annals of history.
"In one sense, there is a glaring anomaly in the
classification of history as a humanities disci
pline." McPherson stated. "The most inhumane ol
all human activities is war. yet most of historical
writing focuses on wars."
ITiis paradox is further complicated by the fact
that war brings out the best and worst in a nation.
McPherson added.
"In American history, wars gave birth to the
nation, preserved its existence, ended slavery and,
in 1945. liberated oppressed peoples of I urope
from one of the darkest tyrannies ever known."
McPherson said. "But American wars also extin

guished the title of native peoples to their land,
expanded the nation's borders by force and
resulted in atrocities that have betrayed our best
ideals."
McPherson devoted the remainder of his
speech to analyzing the Civil War and
Reconstruction period as a case study of these
contradictions. In particular, he focused on the
factors that led to the outbreak of war in April
1861, and the elusive quest for peace four years
later. According to McPherson. the Civil War sim
plv transferred a national conflict from the politi-
cal arena to the battlefield. Thus, the
war did not end with the surrender
of the Confederacy, but rather with
the difficult task of reuniting the
nation politically.
McPherson also discussed the
troubled Johnson administration,
which moved between radical, mini
malist and Reconstruction
approaches, and the disastrous long
term consequences it brought
about. He also described a postwar
world characterized by riots: atroci
ties committed by the ku Klux
klan: and black codes, which severe
ly constrained the rights of African
Americans.
The lecture appeared to strike a
chord with its audience.
"I didn't have a solid impression
of what [the lecture] was going be."
said lien Shapero'l 1. "In the end.it
was very enjoyable. 1 le's clearly pas
sionate about history and sees histo
ry as an opportunity to look at
humanity [in a way] that doesn't
bring to mind old. dusty academics
it's active and vibrant."
Last night's event constituted the
first part of McPherson's visit to
Stanford as a presidential lecturer.
It is followed today bv an informal
discussion at the Stanford

Humanities Center, which will begin
at 4 p.m.
McPherson left audience mem
bers last night by emphasizing what
he felt was the war's most important
result.
"In the war of the armies of 1861
to 1865," he said, "the North pre

vailed and unequivocally achieved
the principal goals of that war:
preservation of the United States as
one nation, indivisible, with liberty
for all."
