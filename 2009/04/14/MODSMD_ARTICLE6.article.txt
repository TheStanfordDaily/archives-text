# Controversy develops over pre-assignment process, role of co-op residents in task force
## Draw changes yield concern 
### KAMIL DADA DESK EDITOR 
Student Housing released details on
Thursday of the new Draw system being
implemented this year. The changes have
been met with controversy, however, as resi
dents of co-operative households (co-ops)
complained th;it the alterations were not in
their best interests and were implemented
without their input.
The Pre-assignment Process
Pre-assignment —in which prospective
residents can be placed into the house of
their choice and bypass the entire Draw
process — has been extended to all
focus/theme houses and co-ops this year.
Prospective residents are eligible for pre
assignment. and those who don't receive it
can still apply for a house's remaining slots
through the regular Draw process.
Nate Boswell, associate director for the
Row, said that pre-assignment applications
will be vetted by a combination of resident
fellows and faculty affiliates. He added that
the process offers numerous advantages over
the older system of priority, in which a stu
dent could garner an advantage over other
applicants, but not a guarantee of getting in.
"|ln the past], all theme houses offered a
special priority that required that students go
to each individual house to fulfill numerous,
fairly haphazard criteria," Boswell said.
"There was no cap on how many priorities
people could apply to or how many priorities
there were."
Boswell further explained how many stu
dents applied for priority based on particular
locations on campus and were not necessari
ly interested in the theme of the house; they
would apply for priority to as many places as
possible and try "gaming" the system.

"Now |that |
we arc extend
ing to all theme i
houses the abil
ity to pre
assign. you
have to he a lot

more intentional
about which hous
es you're applying
to," Boswell said.

He added that
with the shift to pre

assignment, there can
be much more oversight

and objectivity from the
houses, ensuring that peo-

ple truly interested in the
theme are able to live there.

Rodger Whitney, executive
director of Student Housing,

agreed and described how many students felt
that the priority system was one of the
inequities that needed to be fixed.
"The Draw has to feel fair... this is not a
sub-fraternity systepi. this is not meant to be
a subjective process." he said. "Simply and
objectively, [we wanted to] support the pro
gram that gives more support to the theme
houses. I think we accomplished the goal."
Co-op Controversy
Some residents in co-ops, however, have
complained that they were not consulted
about the changes. Erik Nygren '09, a house
manager in ChiTheta Chi, said that the house
was never approached for its thoughts on the
changes.
"We were all initially shocked because the
priority system has been a very good way for
getting people who want to live in co-ops.
into co-ops." Nygren said.
He added that many residents were upset

because they
found the
changes poten
tially detri
mental to the
co-op lifestyle
on campus.

also said that
residents of his

house were not
invited into the
decision-making
process.
"The students

[that were represent
ed] weren't from co
ops. and Housing

Assignments never reached out to co-ops."
Hurwich said.
Whitney however, defended the Housing
task force. He argued that the group was
meant to be a cross section of students, and
not automatically include a student from a
co-op.
"This was one of the most consultative
task forces I've ever been a part of at
Stanford," Whitney said. "Resident fellows,
the Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education, the Vice Provost for Student
Affairs. Residential Education, Residential
and Dining Enterprises and Student Housing
[were all involved]. We went to the ASSU
and talked to the Senate committee, talked to
residents in ethnic theme houses and had a
town hall meeting for all undergraduate stu
dents."
I lousing ultimately gave the task of deter
mining which students would be on the task
force to the ASSU nominations committee.

which had its own criteria for selecting stu
dents. Yet, some co-op residents were still
angered by the changes.
"This is a student-body-wide change, [so]
I'm really shocked there's been no democrat
ic student polling from even a minority of stu
dent groups." Nygren said.
Indeed, he added that Chi Theta Chi was
considering following in the footsteps of fra
ternities and sororities and removing itself
from the Draw altogether. He added that
since it is a private title house, the residents
have the freedom to make such changes.
"[However], since the Draw is happening
so soon, we are in such a short time span."
Nygren said.
Other students were more concerned
about the role of sophomores in co-ops. Matt
Bush "10. the kitchen manager at Terra, said
that the tier system would prevent some
sophomores from getting into co-ops if they
drew in tier 2.
"Some of the co-ops such as Kairos and
Synergy draw low. and it's difficult to get into
the house un-preferred." he said. "They're
worried that they are not going to get enough
sophomores [in the house]."
Whitney however, does not anticipate a
lack of sophomores in co-ops.
"If there are committed sophomores who
come to the open house, they can be pre
assigned there," he said. "I don't understand
this notion that they wont get any sopho
mores to continue their program, because
then you can pre-assign them."
Bush, too, acknowledged that pre
assignment was a possibility for drawing
sophomores into co-ops. However, he felt
that the Draw should have a quota to
ensure that sophomores are able to enter
the houses.


CRIS BAUTISTA/The Stanford Daily
"If we did the pre-assignment. we
would have the option of having more
class balance in the house." he said.
"[But] it we focus on getting more
sophomores, instead of good resi
dents. then that requires a lot of pub
licity. The pre-assignment deadline is
towards the end of April, and we are
still in the process of figuring out the
best way to publicize everything."
Boswell acknowledged that it was
difficult to cater to everyone's needs,
especially because many students are
passionate about their communities.
"I do think that sometimes these
students who are in these houses re
quire a certain amount of attention,
and they deserve that when it comes
to supporting an academic or ethnic
theme, but not at the expense ot the
other students," he said. "That's been
something that's a little tricky to navi
gate because students are passionate
about their communities."
Whitney, too, emphasized that the
task force did not want to jeopardize
the entire Draw and so had the co
ops' interest in mind.
"'lTiere's so much at stake: we want
people to move forward with us as
much as we can. he said."lt we have
to do some handholding to gel them
there and reassure them to add some
flexibility to get them over that hur

die. we are willing to do that... 1 think
we will actually end up showing more
commitment to these houses and have
a mechanism to give them more con
trol than they realize."
Changes to the In-House Draw
Outside of the contentious
changes to the priority system, the in
house draw has also become more
standardized. Sue Nunan. director of
1 lousing Assignments, explained that
the two criteria for the in-house room
selection process will be draw number
and class year. In the past, the in
house draw was somewhat arbitrary,
often determined by a process that
was unique to each house.
Hie only exceptions to the changes
will be Synergy and Columbae. which
will continue to use the consensus sys
tem to determine housing, which en
tails all of the residents agreeing to the
room allocations.
Whitney explained that the change
in the in-house process will make the
Draw even fairer.
"I've hated this [in-house draw sys
tem] for a long time, and now we're
matching that up." he said. "The same
tier number will apply to in-house
room selection."
Changes to Billing
There are also a number of
changes to the way students will be
billed for their housing, making the
charges clearer to students. Whitney
explained that there is almost no mon
etary difference between living on the

Row or in a dorm, but students have
traditionally mistakenly believed that
living on the Row is more expensive
because of the manner in which they
are billed.
"In the past, when you pay for
housing on the row. it includes your
kitchen overhead, [as well as] a sepa
rate fee for food," Whitney said.
"[Now.] we are taking the kitchen
overhead out of the housing charge
and linking it into other fees on the
Row Food costs and labor charges
will all be included into one board
charge."
"We have had confusion for years
about why housing is much more on
the Row and food is so much less: it
was time to fix some problems that
have been there for a while," he
added.
Boswell further explained how.'in
the past, [the University bill| was for
tuition, room rent and kitchen over
head. but then you had to pay a sepa
rate bill for Row board." and now. the
Row housing bill will go on the Uni
versity bill.
In addition, the bill will be consis
tent across all three quarters.
"Whatever your housing charge is.
it is will be split by three to ensure the
same charge each quarter, which al
lows parents to plan better." Whitney
said.

objectively, [we wanted to] support the pro
gram that gives more support to the theme
houses. I think we accomplished the goal."
Co-op Controversy
Some residents in co-ops, however, have
complained that they were not consulted
about the changes. Erik Nygren '09, a house
manager in ChiTheta Chi, said that the house
was never approached for its thoughts on the
changes.
"We were all initially shocked because the
priority system has been a very good way for
getting people who want to live in co-ops.
into co-ops." Nygren said.
He added that many residents were upset

because they
found the
changes poten
tially detri
mental to the
co-op lifestyle
on campus.

also said that
residents of his

house were not
invited into the
decision-making
process.
"The students

[that were represent
ed] weren't from co
ops. and Housing

Assignments never reached out to co-ops."
Hurwich said.
Whitney however, defended the Housing
task force. He argued that the group was
meant to be a cross section of students, and
not automatically include a student from a
co-op.
"This was one of the most consultative
task forces I've ever been a part of at
Stanford," Whitney said. "Resident fellows,
the Vice Provost for Undergraduate
Education, the Vice Provost for Student
Affairs. Residential Education, Residential
and Dining Enterprises and Student Housing
[were all involved]. We went to the ASSU
and talked to the Senate committee, talked to
residents in ethnic theme houses and had a
town hall meeting for all undergraduate stu
dents."
I lousing ultimately gave the task of deter
mining which students would be on the task
force to the ASSU nominations committee.

which had its own criteria for selecting stu
dents. Yet, some co-op residents were still
angered by the changes.
"This is a student-body-wide change, [so]
I'm really shocked there's been no democrat
ic student polling from even a minority of stu
dent groups." Nygren said.
Indeed, he added that Chi Theta Chi was
considering following in the footsteps of fra
ternities and sororities and removing itself
from the Draw altogether. He added that
since it is a private title house, the residents
have the freedom to make such changes.
"[However], since the Draw is happening
so soon, we are in such a short time span."
Nygren said.
Other students were more concerned
about the role of sophomores in co-ops. Matt
Bush "10. the kitchen manager at Terra, said
that the tier system would prevent some
sophomores from getting into co-ops if they
drew in tier 2.
"Some of the co-ops such as Kairos and
Synergy draw low. and it's difficult to get into
the house un-preferred." he said. "They're
worried that they are not going to get enough
sophomores [in the house]."
Whitney however, does not anticipate a
lack of sophomores in co-ops.
"If there are committed sophomores who
come to the open house, they can be pre
assigned there," he said. "I don't understand
this notion that they wont get any sopho
mores to continue their program, because
then you can pre-assign them."
Bush, too, acknowledged that pre
assignment was a possibility for drawing
sophomores into co-ops. However, he felt
that the Draw should have a quota to
ensure that sophomores are able to enter
the houses.


CRIS BAUTISTA/The Stanford Daily
"If we did the pre-assignment. we
would have the option of having more
class balance in the house." he said.
"[But] it we focus on getting more
sophomores, instead of good resi
dents. then that requires a lot of pub
licity. The pre-assignment deadline is
towards the end of April, and we are
still in the process of figuring out the
best way to publicize everything."
Boswell acknowledged that it was
difficult to cater to everyone's needs,
especially because many students are
passionate about their communities.
"I do think that sometimes these
students who are in these houses re
quire a certain amount of attention,
and they deserve that when it comes
to supporting an academic or ethnic
theme, but not at the expense ot the
other students," he said. "That's been
something that's a little tricky to navi
gate because students are passionate
about their communities."
Whitney, too, emphasized that the
task force did not want to jeopardize
the entire Draw and so had the co
ops' interest in mind.
"'lTiere's so much at stake: we want
people to move forward with us as
much as we can. he said."lt we have
to do some handholding to gel them
there and reassure them to add some
flexibility to get them over that hur

die. we are willing to do that... 1 think
we will actually end up showing more
commitment to these houses and have
a mechanism to give them more con
trol than they realize."
Changes to the In-House Draw
Outside of the contentious
changes to the priority system, the in
house draw has also become more
standardized. Sue Nunan. director of
1 lousing Assignments, explained that
the two criteria for the in-house room
selection process will be draw number
and class year. In the past, the in
house draw was somewhat arbitrary,
often determined by a process that
was unique to each house.
Hie only exceptions to the changes
will be Synergy and Columbae. which
will continue to use the consensus sys
tem to determine housing, which en
tails all of the residents agreeing to the
room allocations.
Whitney explained that the change
in the in-house process will make the
Draw even fairer.
"I've hated this [in-house draw sys
tem] for a long time, and now we're
matching that up." he said. "The same
tier number will apply to in-house
room selection."
Changes to Billing
There are also a number of
changes to the way students will be
billed for their housing, making the
charges clearer to students. Whitney
explained that there is almost no mon
etary difference between living on the

Row or in a dorm, but students have
traditionally mistakenly believed that
living on the Row is more expensive
because of the manner in which they
are billed.
"In the past, when you pay for
housing on the row. it includes your
kitchen overhead, [as well as] a sepa
rate fee for food," Whitney said.
"[Now.] we are taking the kitchen
overhead out of the housing charge
and linking it into other fees on the
Row Food costs and labor charges
will all be included into one board
charge."
"We have had confusion for years
about why housing is much more on
the Row and food is so much less: it
was time to fix some problems that
have been there for a while," he
added.
Boswell further explained how.'in
the past, [the University bill| was for
tuition, room rent and kitchen over
head. but then you had to pay a sepa
rate bill for Row board." and now. the
Row housing bill will go on the Uni
versity bill.
In addition, the bill will be consis
tent across all three quarters.
"Whatever your housing charge is.
it is will be split by three to ensure the
same charge each quarter, which al
lows parents to plan better." Whitney
said.

Student Housing released details on
Thursday of the new Draw system being
implemented this year. The changes have
been met with controversy, however, as resi
dents of co-operative households (co-ops)
complained th;it the alterations were not in
their best interests and were implemented
without their input.
The Pre-assignment Process
Pre-assignment —in which prospective
residents can be placed into the house of
their choice and bypass the entire Draw
process — has been extended to all
focus/theme houses and co-ops this year.
Prospective residents are eligible for pre
assignment. and those who don't receive it
can still apply for a house's remaining slots
through the regular Draw process.
Nate Boswell, associate director for the
Row, said that pre-assignment applications
will be vetted by a combination of resident
fellows and faculty affiliates. He added that
the process offers numerous advantages over
the older system of priority, in which a stu
dent could garner an advantage over other
applicants, but not a guarantee of getting in.
"|ln the past], all theme houses offered a
special priority that required that students go
to each individual house to fulfill numerous,
fairly haphazard criteria," Boswell said.
"There was no cap on how many priorities
people could apply to or how many priorities
there were."
Boswell further explained how many stu
dents applied for priority based on particular
locations on campus and were not necessari
ly interested in the theme of the house; they
would apply for priority to as many places as
possible and try "gaming" the system.

"Now |that |
we arc extend
ing to all theme i
houses the abil
ity to pre
assign. you
have to he a lot

more intentional
about which hous
es you're applying
to," Boswell said.

He added that
with the shift to pre

assignment, there can
be much more oversight

and objectivity from the
houses, ensuring that peo-

ple truly interested in the
theme are able to live there.

Rodger Whitney, executive
director of Student Housing,

agreed and described how many students felt
that the priority system was one of the
inequities that needed to be fixed.
"The Draw has to feel fair... this is not a
sub-fraternity systepi. this is not meant to be
a subjective process." he said. "Simply and
objectively, [we wanted to] support the pro
gram that gives more support to the theme
houses. I think we accomplished the goal."
