## DOE scrutinizes SLAC worker safety 
### ELIZABETH TITUS 
Stanford will not contest health
and safety violations recently
reported by the U.S. Department
of Energy (DOE), according to
senior University counsel Steve
Porter.
The DOE alleged in an April 3
report that the University-operated
St. AC National Accelerator
Laboratory violated many rules
leading up to the explosion of a
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) pipe on
Sep. 13,2007.
The mishap occurred during a
water pipe installation project at the
east end of the linear accelerator
facility, and one worker reported
temporary hearing loss.
"Stanford University did not
establish effective procedures to
ensure that welding and cutting
would be performed safely." the
D( )l said in its notice. It listed eight
pages of examples of improper
project planning.
During a 19-month investiga
tion, the DOF found that Stanford
broke rules regarding construction
safety, fire protection and general
procedures that eould have pre
vented the explosion. The blast
occurred when heat from a work
er's steel-cutting torch ignited
vapors from the primer of a nearby
PVC pipe.
"(The DOE) outlined what hap
pened on the day and that certain
parties did not do things that they
should have done, and we're not
going to contest that." said Porter,

resulted in serious
injuries or deaths.
"These consequences
were averted only by circumstance
and timing," it read. "DOE is partic
ularly concerned about Stanford
University's role in this event
because it was the failure of SLAC
personnel to properly plan and
design the underground utilities
upgrade project to preclude haz
ardous conditions that ultimately
put workers at risk of serious
injury."
The DOE also sent notices to
two firms involved in the incident:
Pacific Underground Construction.
Ine. (PUC). a subcontractor of the
University, and Western Allied
Mechanical. Inc.. a subcontractor of
PUC
Stanford will not face lines once
the notice becomes final, although
that is usually the consequence of a
DOE: worker safety violation. The
DOE proposed a $2 MM MM) line
based on the severity of the viola
tions. but said it would waive the
fine because Stanford operates the
laboratory for the federal govern
ment without charge.
