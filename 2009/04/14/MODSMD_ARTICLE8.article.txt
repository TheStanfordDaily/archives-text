## EDITORIAL A 						time for reconciliation for the ASSU 
### 
As Stanford's political community re
covers from one of the more divisive
election seasons in recent memory,
the editorial hoard hopes to take this chance
to remind incoming undergraduate senators
and the newly-elected Executives of why they
wanted to get involved in the ASSIJ in the
first place, and what the student body wants it
to offer.
While the past ASSU Undergraduate Sen
ate session was marked hy bickering both
within the body and with outside groups (in
cluding Hie Daily), ASSU Executives Jonny
Dorsey and Fagan I larris did much to refur
bish the ASSU's moribund image. We hope
the incoming group of elected students looks
past the recent dust-up over late-breaking en
dorsements and pointed personal emails, and
asks how best to emulate the public-relations
success of our current ASSU Execs.
When interviewing Executive candidates
last week, the editorial board heard three Ex
ecutive slates sing praises of Dorsey and Har
ris. Each slate made its own argument as to
why it would be the successor best able to
carry on the Dorsey/I larris legacy — Gob
aud/de la I on e and i lauser/Sprague empha
sized their commitment to public service and
desire to expand the outgoing team's sustain
ability initiatives, while Just A Couple Of Af

lb I lelp'lTie Student Body Exercise Its Voice
While Also Bridging The Gap Between Our
Peers And The I acuity/Administrative Com
plex touted their ability to follow in
Dorsey I larris' footsteps and touch elbows in
a show of undying unity. Last year, no slate
would have bragged that it was most like its
predecessors.
While the editorial board did not have the
pleasure of interviewing all 47 Undergradu
ate Senate candidates, we imagine that few
except, perhaps, the incumbents — would

have compared themselves to an Undergrad
uate Senate that most students consider a do
nothing group of bloviates taking themselves
far too seriously. It may be asking a lot. but we
challenge the incoming batch of senators to
carry themselves in such a way so that candi
dates next year — rather than devising ever
more-questionable puns on their names and
slapping them on their campaign flyers —
will campaign on the basis of their ability to
continue the Senate's excellent work.
The editorial board is also wary of the
conspicuous role that factions like Students
for a Better Stanford (SBS) and the Stu
dents of Color Coalition (SOCC) played in
the political process this year, and their con
tinuing prominence will likely undermine
the Senate's ability to reinvent itself. Eike
George Washington in his famous farewell
address, who decried parties as engines "by
which cunning, ambitious and unprincipled
men will be enabled to subvert the power of
the people." we are suspicious that these
coalitions have little to do with promoting
students' well-being and all too much to do
with self-promotion. We do not dispute the
right of these groups to exist, but would
hope that any such coalition would refrain
from the vapid sloganeering common in the
campaigns and focus instead on the issues.
Unfortunately, there do not seem to be
many substantial differences in the elected
candidates' platforms, or at least none that
they highlighted in their campaign flyers. In a
letter to the edit of last Wednesday. Senate
candidate Anton /.ietsman 12 asked the
Stanford community to think of the two coali
tions not as bitter rivals, hut partners that will
work together to address the Senate's busi
ness. We hope, for the sake of the Senate and
that of the ASSU. that Zietsman's conception
of the two groups takes shape, preventing the
Senate from devolving into a battleground.
