## The 						separation of marriage and state 
### 
On April 3.2009,1110 lowa Stale Supreme
( ourt rules unanimously (9-0) declared
that the state's ban on gay marriage was
unconstitutional and had it immediately over
turned. A legal declaration for gay rights right
out of America's conservative heartland, fol
lowed up b\ Vermont's recent legislative legal
ization of gay marriage, may in fact be the wa
tershed moment the homosexual movement
was looking for. Hut I have to say that, despite
my agreement and happiness in the lowa
courts decision to practice law and not morali
ty. I worry that by legalizing gav marriage we
trample on the personal beliefs and rights of
what seems to be a ma jority of Americans.
Now. before you send me a burning moun
tain of hate mail, let me qualify my statement.
Marriage is a civil, or legal, institution. In
the eyes of the law there has never been, not
should there ever be. any religious aspect to it
at all. Period.
I lie "institution" of marriage, however, is a
peculiar one in American society: it brings in ar
guments ol tradition and faith into a society
that is supposed to be governed by law. It is a
deeply personal matter, but it retains very high
salience across society.
Ilus makes it very difficult to separate argu
ments ol reason and logic from arguments ol
personal morals and subjective ethics. Every
one has their own personal stake in the mar
riage debate, whether religious, traditional or
legal, and by mixing personal morals with legal
principles, we destine marriage to be doomed
to eternal debate and conflict.
Ilus is win I don't like the idea of state-sanc
tioned gay marriage.
Thisiswhv I don't liketheideaofstate-sanc
tioned marriage at all.
Ilie joining of religion and civil function is
guaranteed to cause problems because the
state is supposed to be neutral and lair, where
as religion is inherently biased towards its be
lievers.
And that is where we run into problems.
Church "A" claims that their omnipotent
skv wizard says that redheads can't marry
brunettes, church "B" claims that their polit
burool heavenly friends find it unacceptable if
anyone with an extra dose of melanin in their
skin marries anyone without it.and most C liris
tian churches firmlv hold that (>od believes any
man who wants to marry another man is an
"abomination."
And you know what? I'm fine with that. Re
ligious organizations should be allowed to dis
criminate to their tastes who they allow to par
take in their rituals and whom they consider a
member of their congregation. It is a right in
herent to religions and a right that the govern
nient cannot limit.especially in this country.
I lowevcr.this right would also logically pre
clude anv religions involvement with state and

civil institutions.
It makes sense - religions are allowed to dis
criminate due to their protection nature. The
state, on the other hand, cannot discriminate
against any member of the public for the very
simple reason that it is illegal and unconstitu
tional to do so.
A religious institution shouldn't have the
ability to exclude individuals from federal ben
efits and privileges simply because of religious
dogma and traditionalism, right? Not only
would that be very direct public discrimination,
it would be a downright moral tyranny of a ma
jority against a minority.
Yet. despite this seemingly obvious under
standing. we have the modern institution of
marriage. A religious institution directly bound
to a civil one.
Iliis needs to stop.There's no other option.
11 we want this ongoing legal battle and social
conflict to end. and if we believe the state
should treat everyone as equal, then the state
lias no choice but to get its hands out of reli
gious marriage and vice versa.
The most logical and simple solution for the
state to take is to eliminate all state-sanctioned
marriage.The state cannot marry anyone; they
can only join them in civil union with one an
other according to the rule of law.This civil join
ing would recognize the couple in the same way
that the current state-sanctioned marriage
does. l ull tax and access privileges, both state
and federal, would be granted to the couple
upon the signing of the legal document.
Churches would still be allowed to marry
whomever they want, just without the legal or
tax benefits. In fact, this would make it much
easier to discriminate against whoever they
wish. Churches could marry only whites, only
Spanish-speakers or only turtles for all anyone
cared. What matters is that their decisions
would not have any effect upon the legal stand
ing of the couple in question.
Married in the eyes of Ckxl? Congratula
tions! If you want federal tax breaks and recog
nitions, file for a civil union simultaneously.
If the churches of America truly believe that
marriage is a religious institution, then let them
hack up their talk by reclaiming the practice
and giving up the federal benefits.
I x*t judges and civil servants do the legal pa
perwork for joining any two individuals who
wish to declare union, l et churches marry
whomever they wish before (iod.
lust keep them separate.

" The clergy, by getting themselves established by
law and ingrafted into the machine of govern
ment. have been a very formidable engine against
the civil and religions rights of man Thomas
Jefferson Agree.' I disagree? I mail Mark atmko
