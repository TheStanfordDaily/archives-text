Ken Arrow
Nobel Prize Winner in Economics
Please join us for a conversation with Kenneth Arrow, one of the most
respected and admired living economists in the world. A pioneer in the
application of mathematics to the science of economics, his theory of economic
equilibrium and his welfare theory provide the foundations for much of the
practice of economics today. His work has earned him both a Nobel Prize in
Economics (1972) and a National Medal of Science (2004).
Professor Arrow's research and its significance will be presented in a talk by
John Shoven, the Charles Schwab Professor in Economics, Director of the
Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, and Senior Fellow (by
courtesy) at the Hoover Institution.
Wednesday, April 15
