## EDITORIAL Univ. needs to be open to all immigrant students 
### 
This past week. President Obama's ad
ministration signaled that it will push
for immigration reform this year, set
ting the stage for a polarizing fight in Con
gress. This new legislation will arrive amid
thousands of migrant deaths in U.S. desert
border regions; community raids that have
resulted in the splitting of hundreds of thou
sands of families; an extremely costly border
wall that separates communities, while failing
to deter border crossings; and a large sect of
Americans who strongly oppose any kind of
realistic reform legislation.
In light of all the legislation Obama wish
es to push forth this year related to the econ
omy. healthcare and energy, placing the divi
sive issue of immigration reform on the im
mediate agenda marks an example of politi
cal courage that should inspire our I Jniversi
ty administration to rethink and reform its
own policies toward immigrants who come
to the I arm from outside of U.S. borders.
Stanford's most glaring failure with
would-be immigrant students is its lack of
need-blind admission for international appli
cants. There are 6.502 undergraduates at
Stanford.including4s2 international students
who make up about seven percent of the un
dergraduate population. The argument for
need-blind admission and a full financial aid
program for U.S.-born students centers on
making sure that severe financial hardship
does not keep qualified students from apply
ing to Stanford. We offer one of the best edu
cations in the world, and we offer it. in princi
ple. to everyone able to get in.
International students fortunate enough
to get in are guaranteed full financial aid. but
those applying weigh their decisions of
whether to apply for financial aid knowing
that their chances ot admission will be signif
icantly injured if they request University re
sources to make their education more afford
able.This is an unacceptable policy. While we
are expanding gateways for our students to
engage with the rest of the world through
wonderful international study and service
opportunities, the University has a moral re
sponsibility to expand gateways for the best

and the brightest around the world to come
to us. Many international students come on
scholarships that will only lund three years,
making opportunities such as studying
abroad and having fewer than 20 units per
quarter impossible.These are not issues to be
addressed only when stocks are soaring and
the endowment is growing. Emphasizing the
possibility of a Stanford education to all the
world's citizens should be at the core of the
University mission and no less important
when the endowment is $12 billion than
when it is $17 billion.
Beyond its lack of need-blind admission,
the University's resources to aid internation
al students in filling out government forms
and negotiating visa pronlems are severely
deficient. Many international students seek
aid from the Bechtel International Center in
order to get Social Security numbers, receive
banking services, file U.S. tax forms and deal
with visa problems in returning to the U.S.
But the Center often sends these students
back to its convoluted Web site, saying they
are not equipped to offer advice and do not
want to be liable for the risks involved in of
fering these services.
ITie difficulties international applicants
and students face at Stanford largely arise out
of their fundamental circumstances: they are
guests in this country.subject to many restric
tions that Stanford has no control over, and
have little recourse or method to appeal
against said restrictions. They are the least
powerful, and thus should be the most rigor
ously defended. Yet without much interna
tional student lobbying power.or many alum
ni pressuring for change, the University has
little incentive to improve its policies for in
ternational applicants and students beyond a
genuine concern for the difficulties they face
This incentive has proven insufficient to the
I Jniversity thus far. but it is high time for Stan
ford to realize that its responsibility to stu
dents coming from outside U.S. borders is al
the more pressing because they have less re
course and fewer alumni fighting in their de
tense. I his is why gets done to help them
ITiis is why they should be a top priority.
