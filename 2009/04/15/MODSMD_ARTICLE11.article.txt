# Too Big To Fail
## How I learned to stop worrying and love hypnotherapy 
### 
Like.' everyone else ;it Stanford. I'm usu
ally in denial about how stressed out I
am. Upon discovering that my last
quarter here was to be my busiest to date. I
started worrying about being too stressed to
enjoy it.
During yet another sleepless night last
week. I recalled an episode oP'Monk" where
the main character gets hypnotherapy in
order to combat his obsessive-compulsive
disorder and regresses into a blissful, angst
free live-year-old. It seemed like a good
tradeoff to me.
A Google search and a phone call later. I
was sitting in a classroom of the Palo Alto
School of I lypnotherapy. Established in 1 4 >77.
the school offers certificates and Master's
programs, and looks more like a tastefully
decorated business office than anything else.
The 12 students I met were ethnically di
verse professionals in their thirties and loi
ties Some had backgrounds in psychology
while others were former hypnotherapy pa
tients. They were all amicable, and had ex
tremely soothing voices.
It's tempting to dismiss hypnotherapy as
the medical equivalent ol tarot card reading
and Yahoo horoscopes, especially since as
a student pointed out there are plenty ol

programs that will give you a hypnotherapy
certificate after a single class.
Unlike tarot card reading, however, hyp
notherapy is practiced at some full- Hedged
medical institutions, including the Center for
Integrative Medicine at Stanford Hospital.
According to the program's Web site, hyp
notherapy helps patients cope with a variety
of maladies, both physiological and psycho
logical. including controlling physical pain,
quitting smoking, overcoming phobias and
managing stress.
Pat Sullivan, who instructed the PASOII
class I attended, identified all these benefits
as well, adding that the practice can sharpen
memory and increase concentration.
When I finally got the nerve to ask what
being hypnotized feels like, the class offered
to let me see for myself.
This was what I had been hoping for, but
immediately after consenting. I panicked. My

unteering to get hvpnoti/ed at hypnotherapy

stuck with irreparable psychological damage.
(I later read on the Stanford Web siie that
this isn't possible.)
I hough I never questioned the proles

sionalism and competence of l'at and her stu
dents. I was concerned about the prospect of
emerging from a trance with no recollection
of the past hour. After being assured that I d
remember everything. I felt better.
Before beginning the hypnosis, the stu
dents asked me to talk about my anxiety
what it felt like psychologically and physical
ly. triggers that made it worse, etc. While
these questions allowed them to better un
deistand my challenges and goals, they also
helped build rapport between us. After all, il
there's one thing I enjoy, it's being asked to
talk about myself.
While most of the questions I fielded
would have been asked by any counselor or
physician.every now and then,a more unusu
al one was posed: "What color do you associ
ate with stress?"
After I described a place that made me
feel safe and happy, we were ready to begin.
I was surprised to learn that in order to hvp
noti/e a patient, the hypnotist must hypnoti/e
him or herself, too. In my case. I was hvpno

hypnotherapy actually works. According t<
the literature I'at gave me. it is "the achieve

ation of brain wave patterns."
All anyone technically did. however, was
guided meditation. I sat in a chair while the
students took turns talking —- no one swunj
a watch in front of my face or massaged my
temples.
First. Pat described relaxation pulsing
through my body. Ilien the students took
turns describing my place of "comfort and
safety." Ilien we descended 10 imaginary
stairs, and that's when things got crazy.
People experience hypnotism differently

body swelling up and then dissoh ing. so that

on my thighs. I couldn't feel them. I became a
little ball of energy, receiving pulses from the
air around me. (Yes. I know how this sounds.
It was awesome.)
At this point.the students recited back to
me the goals I had stated earlier centered
ness. the ability to appreciate the present,
faith in myself - while affirming that I was
now in a place where I could achieve them.
Then we went back up the stairs, and I've
felt fantastic ever since.
I'm not arguing that hypnotherapy is a
quick fix for all of life's problems. A lot of the
reason I've been stressed, for instance, is be
cause I'm overcommitted. and no amount of
hypnotism is going to change that. But it has
helped reorient my thinking in positive ways.
I now feel that I can accomplish everything
I've set out to do. and that I can take every
moment as it comes.
At this point, cynics, i.e. everyone who
smirked at the phrase "little ball of energy."
will say that hypnotherapy only worked for
me because I believed it would Yes. obvious
ly. You can't get hvpnoti/ed it you won't let

Still unconvinced? That's okay. No one's
forcing you to be happy
