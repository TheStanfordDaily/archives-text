# The 						Voice of Experience
## The 						NRA victorious 
### 
Ten years ago, I was living in New York
when the Columbine massacre of
April 20. 1999 brutally disrupted the
euphoria of the prosperous, peaceful dot
com days. Hut Columbine was only the cap
stone of a long run of school massacres by
students.
May 1998: Four shot in Springfield. Ore
gon, killed by a 15-year-old who had also shot
his parents to death. March 1998: An 1 1-year
old and a 13-year-old pull a fire alarm at their
school in Jonesboro, Arkansas, killing five as
people flee the building. December. 1997: A
14-year-old freshman killed three at a high
school prayer circle in Kentucky. And there
were many others.
The string of incidents, each shockingly
outrageous in its own right, was so relentless
that I had actually gotten used to it. 1 filed re
ports of yet another school shooting in my
brain somewhere near the weather report.
Columbine was bad enough that it shocked
me out of my complacency. I knew that this
horrific violence had many complicated so
cial causes, but all the incidents revolved
around one central element: guns.
Determined to do something, 1 quickly
joined a group called New Yorkers Against
Gun Violence. I helped with fundraisers and
went to Albany to lobby for the passage of a
specific gun-safety bill, called Child Access
Prevention (CAP) that would have required
that guns stored at home be locked with
child-proof locks. It seemed a no-brainer
after all, studies had shown that accidental
gun deaths of children in states with such
laws were reduced 23 percent.
Yet I was stunned by the resistance we en
countered in Albany. 'I"he New York State
legislature was actually in the midst of con
ferencing on a school violence bill that was
intended to help schools deal appropriately
with troubled students. Since many of the re
cent school shootings had been committed
with guns taken from homes or neighbors'
homes, it seemed a double no-brainer to in
clude the safety-lock legislation in the school
violence bill.
Yet the Republican leadership of the New
York State Senate violently opposed the
CAP measure, having killed it every year for
the previous six years. This was my first en
counter with the power of the pro-gun lobby
and the juggernaut of the National Rifle As
sociation (NRA).To this day. New York State
still does not have CAP legislation in place.
This experience was brought back to me
by a sobering piece on CBS's "Sixty Min
utes" last Sunday on the state of gun control
in this country. Lesley Stahl reported that

gun sales have gone through the roof lately
because of apocalyptic fear over the econo
my and tinfoil-hat paranoia about the new
administration. But mostly. I was reminded
of how incredibly strong the gun lobby is in
this country.
In fact, the NRA may be the single most
powerful lobby in the U.S. (It was ranked as
just that back in 1999 by Fortune magazine,
and although I couldn't find a more recent
ranking, it's likely still way up there). For ex
ample. after Congress passed the Assault
Weapons Ban in 1994. Republicans took
over both houses.and the NRA's lobbying ef
forts were given much of the credit for the
victory. ITie Republicans then allowed the
ban to expire in 2004. Now. Senator Diane
Feinstein. who sponsored the original legisla
tion. wants to reinstate it. but. as she told
Stahl,"The National Rifle Association essen
tially has a stranglehold on the Congress."
And not just on Congress. The influence
of the NRA and the pro-gun lobby in gener
al has essentially won the battle for public
opinion. Gallup polls show that in 2000. 60
percent of Americans favored stricter gun
control laws.That number is now down to 49
percent. For another sad and shocking exam
ple, consider what happened in Virginia in
the wake of the unbelievable massacre at Vir
ginia Tech.in which a deranged student killed
32 students and teachers.
The Virginia State legislature attempted
to close Virginia's so-called gun show loop
hole. which allows any private individual to
sell guns to anyone else without a back
ground check. Something like 30 states have
such loopholes, and criminals will visit those
states, buy guns and transport them to states
with tighter gun control laws.
But despite overwhelming public opinion
in the wake of the massacre, and extensive
lobbying by families of the victims, the meas
ure failed by two votes.
The gun lobby, of course, sees things in a
different way. They argue the answer to gun
crimes is not more gun control but less. Their
argument basically amounts to mutually as
sured destruction, i.e. that criminals will be
less likely to commit crimes if they know one
of their victims might be armed, or that those
on a shooting rampage might be stopped by
an armed individual nearby.
F.ven if this logic were sound. I personally
wouldn't want to live in some sort of night
marish wild-west society where violence is
only contained by the threat of more vio
lence. But the fact is that this logic is not
based in any reality â€” countries like F.ng
land that have much stricter uun control lav\s

The logic of the
gun lobby [is]
based on fanatical
obsession with
owning large
amounts of high
powered firearms.
have far less gun deaths. In 2004.guns killed
73 people in England and Wales, and 11.344
in the U.S. If we adjust for population size,
that's still 26 times more nun deaths in the
US.
I"he logic of the gun lobby isn't even based
on a reasonable interpretation of the Second
Amendment. It is. instead, based on fanatical
obsession with owning large amounts of
high-powered firearms. It is a tragic quirk of
the American character, not a valid policy
position. And it is killing us. In the past weeks
alone, dozens have died in a number of
shooting rampages. And with many crises
higher on the nation's agenda than gun con
trol these days, the killing is likelv to contin
ue for the foreseeable future.
