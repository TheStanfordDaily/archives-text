win it."
"All the guys really stepped up [this
weekend]." added senior captain

been long, fun road." Zeller said.
"We've really been through the ups
and downs of the entire Stanford ten
nis program."

"Saturday's game means a lot sen
timentally. especially to the seniors
preparing to leave the team," Muller
said.
The three seniors have indeed seen
all facets of Stanford tennis. In their
freshman year, they came in and were
part of a Top-10 ranked team that
hosted the NCAA Championships
and lost in the quarterfinals.The next
year, the team didn't even make the
NCAA tournament. Last season, the
team rebounded to make the NCAA
tournament but was defeated in the
second round. This year, the team is
back in the top-10 and returning to the
form of the Stanford tennis teams of
past, which have won a national best
17 NCAA team titles.
"I'm really happy with the way the
seniors have been able to shape the
program." Zeller said. "We turned
Stanford tennis into a program that is
consistently competing for national
champs, [and] a program full of hard
working, good people who want to win

the program."
