# Stanford takes Big Splash thriller, 9-8
## 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
It wasn't exactly pretty, but the
No. 1 Stanford women's water polo
team found a way to defeat No. 5 Cal
ifornia 9-8 on April 11 in Berkeley.
On the heels of a 9-8 victory over
No. 3 UCLA a week earlier in which
the Cardinal trailed 2-0 at the end of
the first period, Stanford again had
to play from behind against the
Golden Bears.
Cal jumped out to a 3-0 lead in the
first period, taking advantage of poor
communication by Stanford's de
fense.
"Coming back from spring break,
we played some lower-ranked teams
and we entered the games with a ca
sual attitude," said Cardinal fresh
man Melissa Seidemann."l think we
carried that attitude over for UCLA
and Cal. who are too good of teams
to take lightly."
Just as in the UCLA game,
though, the Cardinal dominated the
second period.
On the first possession of the peri
od, senior Kira Hillman scored Stan
ford's first goal of the game on a shot
that just squeaked over the goal line.
The Cardinal kept the pressure
on. closing to within one on a five
meter penalty shot by senior Lauren
Silver.
The Golden Bears quickly re
sponded to end Stanford's momen
tum.sneaking a shot past junior goal
keeper Amber Oland.
After each team scored once
more, Hillman once again pulled
Stanford back into the game.scoring
with just under two minutes to play
in the half.
Stanford and Cal would trade
goals one more time before Seide
mann scored on an inside shot with
the clock expiring to tie the game at
5-5.
Following the break. Stanford
grabbed its first lead of the game
with 5:54 left in the third period on
Hillman's third goal of the game.

GAME NOTES: V*
The women's water polo team travels down
to Los Angeles this weekend to play a de
facto conference title game with USC on
Saturday.
Yet in what is becoming a distress
ingly common theme for the Cardi
nal. Stanford could not retain the
momentum. In a five-minute span in
the middle of the third period, Cal
outscored Stanford two to one to tie
the game once again.
With a minute to play in the peri
od. Stanford began looking like the
number-one team in the nation.
Sophomore Kim Kruger and Silver
scored on back-to-back possessions
to put the Cardinal up 9-7 heading
into the fourth period.
In the fourth, both teams' defens
es finally had their time to shine. Nei
ther team would score until Cal
found the back of the net with four
minutes to play.
lip by only one and with its of
fense suddenly unable to score, Stan
ford could only hope the clock would
tick down quickly. The Cardinal got
its wish as the defense shut out the
Golden Bears in the final stretch to
cement the victory.
The win improved Stanford's
record to 22-1 on the season and
stretched its winning-streak to IIJl l J
games. More importantly. Stanford
remains undefeated in conference
play, setting up a regular-season
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation
title game against USC this Saturday.
The Cardinal has played the Tro
jans twice this season, with both
games going into overtime.
In the first match, back in early
February. Stanford could not hold
onto a late lead, allowing USC to
score tosend the game into overtime.

The Trojans dominated the overtime
period, defeating the Cardinal 12-10
— Stanford's lone loss of the season.
In the rematch at the Irvine Invi
tational on Feb. 22. Stanford once
again blew a lead in the waning of
seconds of regulation. The Cardinal
would make the same mistake in the
first overtime period, but was able to
hang on in the second overtime to
win 12-11.
Needless to say. Stanford is ex
pecting a tough fight.
"We need to go up early, but we
need to find a level ground the rest of
the game." Seidemann said. "Play
good defense and patient offense,
and don't let them back into the
game."
The game will be Stanford's final
game of the regular season. Win or
lose. Stanford will qualify for the
MPSI Tournament in Honolulu.
Hawaii from April 24-26.
The only question is whether the
Cardinal will enter the Tournament
as the No. I seed and MPSF confer
ence winner, or as the underdog to
the Trojans.
The USC game is scheduled to
begin at 4:30 p.m. this Saturday in
Los Angeles.
