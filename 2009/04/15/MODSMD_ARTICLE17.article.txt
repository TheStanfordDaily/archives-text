# With Luck, football can be great
## 
### 
It's at our own peril that we look
too far into a spring game per
formance — essentially, a glori
fied scrimmage — but it's hard to
have witnessed Andrew Luck's per
formance on Monday and not feel in
credibly giddy.
Luck was sublime.even after a slow
first quarter when his White team
barely had the ball, lie finished IK/25
for 352 yards and five touchdowns.
More importantly than his statistical
line was the way in which he went
about compiling it — with pinpoint
precision on practically every throw,
even those that went more than 40
yards through the air.
He possessed a combination of
power and accuracy that is frequently
unseen at the collegiate level. He hit
Ryan Whalen on a deep strike that
was placed perfectly on his back
shoulder, despite double coverage.
Later, he connected with Whalen on a
short touchdown pass between
count 'em — four defenders, as the
strike hit his receiver perfectly in the
hands.
Luck's final throw of the evening
showed off both his physical abilities
as well as his mental acumen. On 4th
and 10. he avoided pressure, stepped
up and hit Cobv Fleener for a 32-yard
touchdown. It was impressive not only
because of Luck's pocket awareness,
but also because of the way in which
he saw the field and trusted his receiv
er — Fleener, a gigantic target, was in
single coverage over the middle (a fa
vorable match up), but at the time of
the ball's release.was blanketed by the
defender. Fleener was able to make a
move and haul the ball — thrown on a
line drive-esque fro/en rope — in for
the score.
Tavita Pritchard is I .uck'scompeti

tion for the starting quarterback job.
1 le also had a nice night under center
and. to his credit, has remained the
consummate professional and an erst
while leader for a fairly young (Ordi
nal team, despite Luck's nipping at his
heels for months. Even if it is to his ul
timate detriment, he had little prob
lem acknowledging just how remark
able the young freshman was. and
coach Jim Ilarbaugh went as far as to
say that Luck would be the starter if
the season began today.
But will I larbaugh's inclination be
come reality when the season actually
starts in the fall? And is it the right
move?
Let's be frank about this team for a
moment, and keep in mind that you'll
find few people in the student body
who are more optimistic about next
season than I am: this is not yet a B( S
caliber team. In all likelihood, this is
not yet a Pacific-10 championship cal
iber team. It's getting there, but devel
oping a prolific program in a confer
ence that boasts I JS(' at the top and a
number of other quality football
teams in lockstep behind them is an
arduous and time-consuming process
This all being said. Stanford can
still be quite successful — eight wins is
not out of the question. But. neither is
eight losses.
Here is where the quarterback de
cision comes into play. Pritchard's
overall potential won't blow anyone
away, but he is a veteran who has the
athleticism to make plays beyond the
pocket and knowledge to direct the of
l'ense fairly efficiently. In other words,
with Pritchard.we know what we get
and if he were to remain the starter,
the ('ardinal would likely find itsell in
a similar position to last season in
contention for a bowl game.
There is more uncertainty with
