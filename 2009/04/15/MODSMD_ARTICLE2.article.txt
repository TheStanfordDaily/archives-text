## Shopping Center plan withdrawn University opts to focus on hospital growth 
### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
ITie University announced yes
terday that it is withdrawing its pro
posal to the City of Palo Alto to
expand the Stanford Shopping
Center.
Simon Properties, the leaseholder
on the Stanford land, proposed
adding 240.000 square feet and a
120-room hotel to the Shopping
Center grounds.
Palo Alto officials "expressed dis
appointment with the University's
decision," as stated in a press release
by the city. Stanford Shopping
Center currently contributes a signif
icant percentage of the city's sales
tax revenues. Expanding the center
would increase that contribution and
create jobs for Palo Alto residents.
University officials cited a desire
to shift focus onto the expansion of
Stanford Hospital and the Lucille
Packard Children's Hospital into
Palo Alto land. The hospital expan
sion was filed jointly with the
Stanford Shopping Center develop
ment in 2007.
ITie hospital plans are bound by a
2013 seismic retrofitting deadline
imposed by state law. The project is
currently behind schedule, and the
University hopes to extend that
deadline until 2015.
Hie two expansion plans were
proposed to the city together by the
University. However. debate
remains as to whether the
University or the city was the cata
lyst behind the joint filing.
Palo Alto City Manager James
Keene noted in the city's press
release that, "we should remember,
however, that it was Stanford that
requested that the Environmental
Impact Report for both the hospital
and shopping center be processed
together."
Tine University's official press
release offered, in contrast, that "in
order to assist the city in pursuing its
goals. Stanford reluctantly agreed to
have the projects considered con
currently. but separately."

withdrawal of the Stanford
Shopping Center expansion in The
Daily later this week.
