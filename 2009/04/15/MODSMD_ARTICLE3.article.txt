## Researchers find source of arsenic Stanford scientists aid Cambodian residents 
### JULIA BROWNELL DESK EDITOR 
Faculty and students from the
Environmental Earth Systems
Sciences (I ESS) program have
found the source of arsenic that has
been poisoning groundwater in
South Asian river deltas.
The project, conducted south of
the Cambodian capital, Phnom
Penh, was orchestrated by EESS
Prof. Scott Eendorf and his team of
graduate students, in conjunction
with Research Development
International (RDI) Cambodia.
The health effects of ingesting
arsenic range from mild callusing
and darkening of the skin to lesions
on the skin and lungs, leading to
melanoma and lung cancer.
The humanitarian aspect of this
research on arsenic is very impor
tant to Eendorf and his team:
Fendorf said that he believes that
the humanitarian spirit permeates
the EESS department.
"Definitely, I I SS research has a
human element to it... It was one
of the founding ideas." he said.
"Once you see the gravity of the sit
uation in South Asia in my case ...
you start migrating to those types of
issues.
Due to intense civil war in
Cambodia over the past 30 years,
the citizens have only started to dig
wells to the aquifer for drinking
water over the past decade.
Therefore, they have fewer symp
toms of poisoning because of their
limited exposure.
"It takes often two decades
before effects start manifesting
themselves." Fendorf said.
Most health effects are more vis
ible in the Ganges-Brahmaputra
river delta in India and Bangladesh,
where thousands die of cancers
related to the toxin.
"It's really, really had." Fendorf
said. "Bangladesh and parts of India
are really getting hit hard with the
health effects now. and Cambodia is
on its way."
To get to the bottom of the mys
tery. the team dug wells in a section
of the Mekong delta to study the
distribution of the dissolved arsenic.
"We were able to figure out how
the water flows, and follow the
chemistry of [the arsenic] as it
moves down," Fendorf said.
The wells allowed the team to
study the exchange of water
between the river and the wetlands
surrounding it. The wetlands are
flooded by the Mekong River each
year, which deposits sediment con
taining insoluble arsenic from the
Himalayas. Once deposited, the
arsenic is used as fuel by anaerobic
bacteria, which turn it into a soluble
form that flows with water from the
wetlands down into the citizens'
drinking water. The aquifer then
feeds back into the river.
"We think it's about a 300-year
travel time [in the strongest spots)."
Fendorf said. "It's a steady state;
you have arsenic in the sediment
and arsenic in the water. It's been
happening for thousands of years,
and it'll just keep doing that."
Fendorf stressed that the project
was not one without hope of solu
tion. He recently returned from a
conference in Cambodia about how
to proceed using the new findings.
I'he conference stressed how scien
tists can help inform policy-makers
and the public.
In addition, Fendorf mentioned
specific measures being considered

to remedy the problem for the citi
zens of the delta who have no other
source of water and are running out
of time against the health risks.
"You can filter the water," he
said."hut you have a number of risk
factors — how do you prevent filter
failure and how do you work if a fil
ter does fail?"
Due to limited options of other
water sources, Fendorf said another
option may have to be "rainwater
harvesting."
Cambodia's civil war included
genocide against citizens outside the
government who were educated or
held positions of power. Fendorf
stressed that RDI Cambodia made
sure the project worked coopera
tively with the community in
Phnom Penh to help educate them
and provide work opportunities.
"That was RDl's mantra —
immerse themselves in the local
community and not just bring in
Westerners to do the work,
Fendorf said. "Helping to bring
back an educated class is really
important."
Though on the right track.
Fendorf qualified that this research
is by no means an end or solution to
the puzzle.
"It was an important step...
|the research) is having and will
continue to have a positive social
influence," he said. But, "We re
actually still working over there ...
It's an ongoing process."
