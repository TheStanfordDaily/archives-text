# Undergrad voter total up 14.62%
## ASSU election undergraduate vote increases dramatically; ASSU activism, current Execs cited as factors 
### DANA SHERNE 
Overall turnout in last week's ASSU elec
tions dropped 6.67 percent from 2008, but
undergraduate voting went up 14.62 percent
— the largest increase since the 2005 election
— indicating rapidly growing undergraduate
interest in Stanford student government.
Just last year, in the 2008 election, under
graduate turnout fell 7.4 percent, but this
year's results indicate another turnaround for
the ASSU. 'ITie undergraduate vote went up
10.07 percent in 2007, following a 7.55 percent
decrease in 2006.
According to Cady Glaser *10. the diversi
tv of candidates this election vear contributed

to the 14.62 percent increase in voter turnout.
"The people running for ASSU. mainly the
Execs, were people that came from very dif
ferent groups ... and they were attracting a
wider range of people than before," she said.
ASSU Executives-elect David Gobaud 'OK
M.S. MO and Jav de la Torre MO are the first
graduate-undergraduate team to win election
to the ASSU's highest office in recent memory.
Other students attributed the increase in
ASSU interest to the leadership of current
ASSU Executives Jonny Dorsey '09 and
Pagan Harris'o9.
"I think [Dorsey and Harris have] taken
on not only a stronger stance but a broader
stance in terms of looking at manv different

issues at hand: mental health, and wellness,
sexual violence, environmental matters and
financial issues." said Yihana Ritter M 1.
Under Dorsey and Harris, the ASSU has
expanded its reach into advocacy issues that
student government has not traditionally
touched.
"I think the ASSU is wonderful at plan
ning social events, community bonding
events, and works to improve the general
well-being of the students at Stanford — for
example, with the Wellness Room that
opened this past quarter." said Siddhartha
O/a.'ll.
Oza acknowledged, however, that the elec
tion process is still imperfect.

"To a degree, it's a certain amount of a
popularity contest." he said.
More than half of the undergraduate pop
ulation — 56.3 percent — chose to vote, hut
many students still question the effectiveness
of the ASSU.
"Many of the issues [the candidates] cam
paigned on. 1 know the Senate doesn't really
have any control over." said Bill Rowan "11.
Austin Keeley '11 chose not to vote
because of similar doubts about ASSU effica
cy. as well as his negative perception of candi
dates' motivations for running.
"I got the vibe from some of the candi-
dates that the election was more
about satisfying personal egos and
padding resumes than helping out
the school, although that is certainly
not true for all the candidates."
Keeley said.
On the other hand, Yesenia
Cisneros "12 did not feel prepared to
vote, despite meeting individual can
didates.
"I still don't know what the ASSU

does." she said. "I just know that we
pay fees and they are supposed to set
up stuff for us."
"All I really know about [the
Senate candidates] is that their
names rhymed with something inter
esting." Rowan added. "The ASSU
may not have that much actual
power, but whatever power it does
have seems to be concentrated in the
Executive."
