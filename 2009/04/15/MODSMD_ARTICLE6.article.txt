## Senate takes look at Association budget New senators arrive, Nom Com debated 
### ZOE RICHARDS STAFF WRITER 
Tuesday's ASSU Senate meet
ing was packed with new faces as
the 11th Undergraduate Senate
begins to make its transition into
student government and the veter
ans of the 10th Senate make their
exit.
With its term winding down, the
current Senate discussed budget
items for next year, including the
Association Budget, and debated
whether senators ought to be able
to serve on the Nominations
Commission (NomCom).
The Association Budget, which
is facing an approximately 11 per
cent cut. drew quite a bit of atten
tion from the Senate. Typically
consisting of $229,000, the budget
is mostly designated for opera
tional costs, with some set aside for
the political bodies themselves.
The Association Budget will be
voted on after the ASSIJ's political
bodies provide feedback to
Financial Manager Matt
McLaughlin 'OS. Speaking at last
night's meeting, McLaughlin noted
that after a year of involvement in
an elected capacity. Senate mem
bers should be qualified and able
to make clear decisions about
important budget items.
"I don't view it as my role to
determine what should and
shouldn't be on (next year's budg
et |." McLaughlin said. "It should
n't be me determining an issue
when I'm not an elected official."
McLaughlin urged senators to
make detailed recommendations
about where they envision feasible
cuts as the preliminary adjust
ments he made reflect what he
called "bureaucratic" judgments.

rather than informed choices
"based on policy."
"1 don't want to be the ping
pong between different organiza
tions," McLaughlin said.
Deputy Chair Patrick Cordova
'09 responded to McLaughlin's
requests by suggesting that indi
vidual senators who do have
objections to the proposed budget
communicate them directly with
McLaughlin before the Senate
votes.
In a contentious debate, sena
tors proceeded to discuss who
should be allowed to sit on the
NomCom and participate in com
mittees. The Commission, which
will be chaired by Phillip Hon 'ID
in the upcoming year, consists of
seven graduate and undergraduate
students. The Commission aims to
ensure that student voices are
present and heard in University
decision-making by nominating
students to University and Board
of Trustees committees.
Cordova was opposed to the
idea of senators participating on
NomCom, arguing that senators
already have a significant platform
to express their opinions.
"I would like to give other stu
dents the opportunity to stand on
the soapbox," Cordova said. "My
voice may already drown out [the
voices of other students |."
Senator Stephanie 1 pps' 10 dis
agreed with Cordova, pressing the
importance of letting those who
are committed to serving the
Stanford community to do so in
NomCom as well.
"I stood on four committees
I have a vested interest in the stu
dent body 1 pps s;iid.
Senator-elect Virun Sivaram
'11 agreed with I pps and cau
tioned against "depriving Stanford
of its senators." who are. in his
view, committed to serving the
public good.
After consulting the Senate
Bylaws. Senator Luukas lives '09,
chair of the Administration &
Rules committee, concluded that
Senate rules render neither posi
tion correct on the issue. Instead,
the Senate's NomCom involve
ment will he decided by the
Commission.
"It's up to [NomCom's| discre
tion to decide whether being a sen
ator aids or detracts from our abili
ty to do this job.'" lives said.
