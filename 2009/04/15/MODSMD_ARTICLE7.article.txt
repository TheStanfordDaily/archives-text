"The level of passion and integrity is greatly
changed since my undergraduate years." Hayes
said. "Now it is subterranean and frankly more
positive, with a real sense of pursuit of opportu
nities."
Hayes hoped that his speech would help "a
couple of people find what they will do in their
lives." as his remarks were woven around "mov

ing into a bold new era" with the ()bama admin
istration's new focus on improving environmen
tal conservation standards. I le envisions that this
new movement will reach the Stanford campus
as well, and said it is outrageous that the
University is not completely energy-efficient,
telling students that if they demand energy effi
ciencv. it will be achieved.
As an example. Hayes described his activism

as ASSU president. In 1%8. the Stanford
Applied Flectronics Building housed research
for the creation of an anti ballistic missile. I laves
called a meeting to vote whether or not a univer
sity campus should house classified research.
Stanford cancelled the research after percent
of the community voted against it.
