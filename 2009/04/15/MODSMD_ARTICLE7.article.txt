Students for a Sustainable Stanford's Earth
Week kicked off yesterday with a speech from
Earth Day founder and former ASSU President
Denis I laves W. Alter sharing anecdotes about
Ins student activist days. Mayes encouraged the
audience gathered on Meyer l awn to create a

"The level of passion and integrity is greatly
changed since my undergraduate years." Hayes
said. "Now it is subterranean and frankly more
positive, with a real sense of pursuit of opportu
nities."
Hayes hoped that his speech would help "a
couple of people find what they will do in their
lives." as his remarks were woven around "mov

ing into a bold new era" with the ()bama admin
istration's new focus on improving environmen
tal conservation standards. I le envisions that this
new movement will reach the Stanford campus
as well, and said it is outrageous that the
University is not completely energy-efficient,
telling students that if they demand energy effi
ciencv. it will be achieved.
As an example. Hayes described his activism

as ASSU president. In 1%8. the Stanford
Applied Flectronics Building housed research
for the creation of an anti ballistic missile. I laves
called a meeting to vote whether or not a univer
sity campus should house classified research.
Stanford cancelled the research after percent
of the community voted against it.
lliis gave 1 layes the idea to apply
such tactics to environmental protec
tion. I le moved tin from Stanford pol
itics to U.S. Congressional politics.
I lowever. 1 iayes found that too much
focus on government was ineffective
in generating change.
"One way or another, we've
failed," he said.
With the economic meltdown and
changing times, though, Hayes
believes people are more likely to
"look for quality that will endure." He
said students should use social net
working sites, such as Facebook. to
"gear up students across the country."
Marielle Price *11. one of around
50 people who attended the event,
agreed.
"Students, young people, are really
what make big changes," she said.
"We can unite on college campuses."
Heather Bischel. a graduate stu

dent in environmental engineering,
noted Hayes' importance in an
American context.
"It's kind of a big deal." she said.
"Earth Day is engrained in our tradi
tion in the United States."
And Liv Walter, also a graduate
student in environmental engineer
ing, added how the talk put "a human
face on something that has such a big
impact."
Price added that Hayes' message
is especially important in today's eco
nomic climate.
"Useless waste means you don't
have to pay for things." she said. "The
point is conserving, including conserv
ing money."
Hayes' speech was the kickoff to
Greenfest 2009. The weeklong sus
tainability event, which celebrates
Earth Day, will continue through
April 23. More information can be
