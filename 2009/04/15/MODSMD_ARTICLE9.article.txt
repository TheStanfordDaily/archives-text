## Ehrlich revisits "Population Bomb" In 1968, Paul Ehrlich predicted that the world was on the brink of mass starvation. More than 40 years later, he still thinks we're in danger. 
### LILY GUO 
In 1968, Professor Paul R.
Ehrlich. Bing professor of pop
ulation studies, published "The
Population Bomb", a book that
made his name known to any
one vaguely familiar with economic
theory. His doomsday predictions
were revolutionary.
"The battle to feed all of humani
ty is over," he claimed. "In the 1970s
and 1980s hundreds of millions of
people will starve to death in spite of
any crash programs embarked upon
now."
Since "The Population Bomb"
was published more than 40 years
ago, no famines of the magnitude
that Ehrlich spoke of have occurred,
causing many to dismiss his theory
that rapid population growth is a
crisis that demands our immediate
attention. While smaller famines
have devastated many regions of the
world, critics have nevertheless dis
credited him. In the face of such a
backlash, the aging Ehrlich laughing
ly contends that he's "still the old
crazy man that thinks overpopula
tion is a huge problem in the world."
Ehrlich's office does not seem to
have walls. On one side there is a
window, while all other sides of the
room are completely covered with
books, many of which he wrote.
During his interview with The Daily,
he offhandedly mentioned that he

has already given away 9,000 books,
and that those in the office would
have to go soon. too. Lately, books
have not been the only things to go
— Ehrlich has had to backtrack on
his radical population bomb theory.
In a recent article written by
Ehrlich and his wife Jane,
"Population Bomb Revisited." they
acknowledge there were a few
severe flaws in the assumptions that
were made more than 40 years ago.
The famines Ehrlich predicted
were somewhat prevented by the
Green Revolution, a technological
advancement in agriculture from the
•60s through the '80s that doubled
the staple food supply. ITiere are
those who claim that, due to the
Cireen Revolution, there is no longer
a hunger problem related to over
population. Ehrlich, however, point
ed out that today there are over a
billion undernourished people who
are extremely vulnerable to a multi
tude of diseases, a number that is
often overlooked.
Since publishing "The Population
Bomb", Ehrlich's views have become
much less extreme, though he retains
his belief that population growth is a
severe — albeit not the most press
ing — problem of our time.
"The biggest problem we have
today is over-consumption. If each
one of us used only what we needed
and consumed sensibly, we wouldn't
have to face the environmental
problem we have," he said.

"Reducing per-capita consumption
is a much easier task than reducing
the population."
Still, an escalating population —
the UN projects a 32 percent growth
in population by 2050 - still concerns
Ehrlich.
"When I was born, there were
about two billion people on the plan
et; now there are more than 6.7 bil
lion." he said. "This kind of change
and its effect cannot be ignored."
"Of course, reducing the popula
tion is still something that should be
done." he added. "Only then can we
have a stable society," suggesting
that the best way to achieve this in
regions of rapid population growth,
such as India — which is projected
to have a population greater than
that of China by 2040 — is through
the education of women. When he
spoke to educated women in China,
he discovered that they are wildly in
favor of the one-child policy.
Ehrlich. himself the father of only
one child, does not necessarily agree
with the one-child policy. He
believes the right course of action in
China should have been approach
ing the problem earlier in order to
implement a less drastic approach.
"At the time the policy was
passed, however, with the situation
in China at the time, it was a sensible
measure," he said.
While there are many who associ
ate over-population problems with
Asia or Africa, Ehrlich believes it to

be a problem in the U.S. as well. In
"Population Bomb Revisited." he
described this country as "a center of
over-consumption whose population
continues growing because of a rela
tively high birthrate and high immi
gration rate."
To combat this problem in
America. Ehrlich isn't opposed to
government intervention.
"Have you ever heard this issue
mentioned in the media?" he asked.
"You've got to get a President who's
got the guts to say. 'Patriotic
Americans stop at two (children].' It
needs to be brought up. then eventu
ally people will recognize its danger
and do something about it."
In "The Population Bomb,"
Ehrlich predicted many devastating
effects of population growth.
Technology helped us sidestep a few
of his predictions, and for this, many
have discredited the bulk of his
work.
But his controversial book was
one that went beyond its time —
despite taking an extreme stance,
Ehrlich was among the first to recog
nize the dangers of over-population.
He predicted "the deterioration of
the epidemiological environment
and the possibility of a 'super flu'"
long before climate change and
AIDS became serious worries.
And now. he could be right again.
