## Nicole Demby The 						new Stanford politics? 
### 
When I saw the Internet homepage of
I"he New York Times the other day.
I felt like I had walked into a differ
ent era. Sure. mv father had fought police
outside the Columbia administration build
ings in "68, but it's been rare in my lifetime to
see students in New York holding such a vis
ible public protest that resulted in police
using teargas. Yet that is exactly what hap
pened this week as students at the New
School called for the resignation of their
president, a man they criticize for running
the school like a corporation.These protests
came after IS students were suspended dur
ing protests at NYIJ in February.
I often balk at trying to decipher whether
similar events that happen synchronously in
different places are coincidental, or whether
they constitute a larger cultural trend. Yet
despite this aversion, the New School and
NYU protests can't help but evoke memo
ries of the student protests that broke out all
over (ireece last year, the recent protests in
Moldova where students used Twitter and
Face book to organize rallies against the re
strictive Communist government and other
recent political activity that has emerged
from young people around the world. Per
haps. sparked by recent events such as the
imploding economy, the "me' generation
has rev ealed more of a social consciousness
than those that dubbed them so give them
credit for.
I veil placid Stanford may be seeing the
effects of this potential trend.Though gener
ally seen as more apolitical and conservative
than some ol its collegiate peers. Stanford
has boasted recent articles in the Stanford
Magazine and The Stanford Daily which
have recalled a time when Stanford was rife
with protest against authority (spurred by a
new book by former Stanford president,
Richard Lyman, on his tumultuous terms).
While tins kind of reflexive political activity
may have since been absent from this cam
pus. a return to the authority-questionings
days ol yore may be occurring. While the
Stanford politics of the past few decades was
primarily isolated to school sanctioned hu
manitarian groups working on global issues,
lately, some recent political activity harkens
back to Stanford's more radical days with its
focus on the space and functioning of the
I Jniversity itself.
Sitting on the floor of my friend's room at
Synergy. I listened to him describe a project
he initiated called the Stanford Free School,
a community ol students devoted to public

tion. In a recent meeting, the group staged an
art blast by walking into the ( oho. hanging
up art they had made and walking out. Some
of the students involved in planning last
year's "Rumsfest," a comedic celebration
extravaganza protesting Donald Rumsfeld's
presence at Stanford.are now working to or
chestrate "Condival," a reaction to Con
dolecv/a Rice's return to campus. Both
events may be indicative of a growing inter
est among certain students to take part in a
kind of collaborative activity, one that blurs
the distinctions between art and politics.This
type of activity is nothing new — it has pre
viously manifested itself in everything from
Woodstock to flash mobs yet it strikes me
as a novelty here at Stanford.
I've long been averse to what I dismiss as
a certain brand of Northern California hip
pie utopianism. Whenever someone looks at
me starry-eyed and waxes poetical about
how Burning Man changed their life, or the
great things being done in some intentional
community living in the forest somewhere,
the cynical New Yorker in me balks. Vet with
their embrace of public art as a form of polit
ical protest, the aforementioned recent hap
penings at Stanford combine the best of
many aesthetic and political sensibilities.
They express an absurdist view demonstrat
ed by many New Yorkers, yet seem to have
roots in a particularly West Coast counter
cultural optimism that claims collaborative
action can enact real change. They are the
manifestations of what happens when you
combine the astounding minds of Stanford
students with a critical political conscious
ness. In attempting to isolate a global theme
of growing student political activity.it iscru
cial to understand that global trends mani
fest themselves uniquely in different places.
