## Mind without soul?

In fall quarter of my junior year. I took one
of the most memorable courses in my
Stanford career, entitled "The Ethics and
Politics of Public Service." taught by Profes
sor Rob Reich. On the final day of class. Pres
ident Hennessy made a guest appearance to
answer many of our questions that had arisen
throughout the course regarding Stanford's
policies toward public service, as well as
ethics in general.
When the question-answer period began.
I raised my hand. After a while. President
Hennessy called on me. This was my ques
tion:
"President Hennessy, you have men
tioned that ethical goodness ought to be in
stilled early on in a person's life by his or her
parents. Does this mean that the University
does not feel it has a duty to perform an ac
tive role in trying to shape a culture that
stresses building moral character?"
"And if so. why?" I continued. "Why
should the University not actively aid the
creation of moral character and virtue when
evidence suggests that this is so severely lack
ing on college campuses, even here at Stan
ford? Can you make the argument that learn
ing vocational subjects is more important
than learning the value of being a good per
son? What are your arguments against the
University actively pursuing this role in
stressing character building?" Then, accord
ing to my notes. I took a deep breath.
I wish I could remember President Hen
nessey's precise response because I did not
merely ask this question in order to be heard.
The question I asked Stanford's president
that morning was one that for years had
been, and continues to be. troubling me be
fore I even began attending this university.
Stanford takes a rather laissez-faire view
in the development of moral character and
civic duty among its student body, though the
University does mandate that each student
fulfills a Cieneral Education Requirement
through an ethical reasoning course. Grant
ed. opportunities abound for students to call
upon themselves to develop or strengthen
their inner sense of responsibility to others
through community service, civic action or
even through academic courses. It would
seem, however, that such students are a sell
selecting group.

It is innate in us to be
selfish, but character
and responsibility can
be taught.

Too little is asked of us by this school
when it comes to developing moral charac
ter. Stanford does everything it can to pre
pare us to be successful in whatever form we
value success, which, for many of us. is calcu
lated in monetar> terms. As indispensable as
personal success may be. I still hear those
words echoing in m\ head: "( an you make
the argument that learning vocational sub
jects is more important than learning the
value of being a good person?" Is money re
allv all that a college degree ought to be good
for?
Some hold that morality is based in reli
gion. and that to teach about ethics and re
sponsibility to others approaches religious
preaching. I disagree. To me. character, re
sponsibility. morality and ethical behavior
has. as both an academic vocation and a
daily-life practice, everything to do with act
ing according to empathy, understanding the
other as one does the self and maintaining a
passion for bettering the world. In my opin
ion. it has vers little to do with C iod's reward
for such action. Moral character is what aris
es when a person has an understanding of
this empathy, of this responsibility for some
thine outside of the self. It is innate in us to be

selfish, but character and responsibility can
be taught. It should be taught outside the
home if the home has not done its job.
Ethics in Society is still not a major. Why?
Does the I Jniversity simply care more about
the financial success of its students more than
it does how they garner such success? Have
we decided it is just too difficult to teach
morality without getting into the realm of re
ligion? Whatever the reason, the evidence
suggests that the powers that be at Stanford
do not believe it is the University's place to
instill the lessons ol moral character, civic
duty and ethical makeup into the soul of its
student body.
Certainly, we as students are not without
blame. With opportunities for service readily
available, why do so few of us take advan
tage? What does this say about our values,
about our generation? Theme-first mentali
ty so pervasive among many in the student
body is enough to make one wonder how
many of us even enter the service arena with
out one eye on our resume.
One wonders whether this culture is
changeable, it perhaps the recent financial
crisis is enough to make people our age think
twice about the culture of greed and narcis
sism that got us into this mess. If a silver lin
ing may be drawn, perhaps these hard times
may cause us to take another look both in
side and outside ourselves.
I look at this university, at universities in
general, and I marvel at the societal culture
they seek to create. A universits is. looked at
through the romanticist s glasses, a piece of
Utopia, literally separate from the rest of so
ciety. where students congregate in a thirst
for knowledge, to meet others and to find
themselves. Our mentors and teachers seek
nothing more than to stand before or walk
side by side with us. bestowing us with their
own knowledge II you allow yourself to ac
cept this vision, you cannot but conclude that
our university has indeed forged for us a
beautiful world.
Hut without ethics, the distribution ot
knowledge, technology, math and science
amounts to nothing. What is the mind with
out the soul?
