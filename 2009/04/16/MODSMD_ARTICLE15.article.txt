# NHL playoff drama back on tap at last
## 
### 
The day is finally here. Tonight,
the San Jose Sharks will begin
their 2009 playoff run with
what is easily the most com
plete and skilled team in the fran
chise's history and look to put years of
playoff disappointment behind them.
It is time for the players to put away
the ra/ors and start those playoff
beards. It is time for the growing num
ber of hockey nuts in the Bay Area to
hope they'll still be heading down to
the "Shark Tank" come June.
Just don't think that because San
Jose wrapped up the season with an
NHL-best 53-18-11 record that a trip
to the finals is anything more than
probable. In fact, even though they se
cured the most points, if by only one,
the Sharks are by no means the best
team going into the postseason. That
honor has to go to the Boston Bruins,
who finished with the same number of
wins as the Sharks, allowed the fewest
goals of any team in the league and
outscored everyone except for the of
fensive machine that is the Detroit
Red Wings.
But. as any true hockey fan knows,
it really doesn't matter at all who had
the best season or who looks the best
on paper. No game or series is a sure
thing, and a game can slip away with
only a few seconds left on the clock
(just ask Miami of Ohio, who nearly
had the NCAA title all locked up).
The closest thing to a sure thing head
ing into this year's Stanley Cup Play
offs is that many of the series, and es
pecially the finals, are going to come
down to the wire. Four of the last
seven finals have gone to seven games,
and there hasn't been a sweep in the
final round in over ten years.
That is why. without a doubt, the
NHL offers the most exciting and dra
matic postseason in any sport. It
stretches well over a month and in
cludes anywhere from 60 to 105 games
the entire NFL schedule, mean
while, consists of just 256 games in its
regular season. Throw in the handful
of games that seem to make it to
fourth, fifth or sixth overtimes every
year, and there really is nothing more
that a fan could ask for.
But back to the Sharks. The bad
news for San Jose fans is that, despite
being the top overall seed and having

secured the home-ice advantage all
the way through the postseason, the
Sharks still face an extremely difficult
road to the Cup. Anaheim, their first
round opponent,has been to the finals
twice in the last five postseasons. the
only team to do so more than once in
that span.
When the Ducks are clicking
and they have been the last month or
so â€” they can light the lamp as well as
anyone in the league. Add Scott Nei
demeyer and Chris Pronger on the
blue line, and it is easy to understand
why they were the fifth-best power
plav team in the league. And they
boast one of the most legendary play
off goalies of the last decade in J.S.
Giguere. assuming he can summon up
that playoff magic once again after a
rough season.
And that's just what the eighth
seeded team in the West brings to the
table.
The Sharks will potentially have to
knock oil both Detroit and a resur
gent Chicago Blackhawks club that
features some of the best young
skaters and scorers in the league in
Patrick Kane and Jonathan Toews in
the next two rounds just to reach the
finals. II they can get that far, it could
be a match-up of the two best regular
season teams with Boston.or other 50-
game winners like Washington and
New Jersey
But that doesn't mean there isn't
reason to hope for a ('up or to expect
great things. This is the team that led
the league in points, after all. Just re
member that, even if the Sharks fall in
the first round or two. it isn't necessar
ily a choke. ITie Sharks. Bruins and
Red Wings can all claim to be the best
team in the NHL when they are play
ing at their best, but none of them are
that much better than the other 13
playoff teams playing to their full po
tential for three lull periods.
Anything can happen, and that's
why we love the postseason. The
Sharks might take it all. but they, or
anyone else (whatever their regular
season record), will have to earn it on
every shift the rest of the way. When
the puck drops tonight, a new season
begins.
