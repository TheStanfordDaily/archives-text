# Budget cuts hit drama dept.
## Next year, improv class Drama 103 reduced to one section, while Drama 104 cut altogether 
### LAURA STAMPLER 
Reduction and cancellations of tradition
ally popular classes in the arts have hit the
University, as budget cuts are no longer a dis
tant threat to students, hut a reality.
Student-favorite Drama 103: Beginning
Improvising will be reduced from four sec
tions to one section per year, and Drama 104:
Introduction to Sketch Comedy will be cut
entirely from the drama department's list of
offered courses.
Based on high enrollment and atten
dance. as well as consistent five-star ratings
on Courseßank, Daniel Klein — a Drama
103 alumnus and the current instructor lor

both courses — previously thought his class
es would be safe.
"And then another round of cuts came."
Klein said. "And I got an email over break
saying. 'I'm really sorry, but there's only
enough funding for one section next year.*
And it was unclear what funding there would
be for SIVIPS [Stanford's by-audition
improvisational group]."
Hie University has committed itself to
education in the arts with projects like the
Arts Initiative. As faculty leader of the Arts
Initiative, Bryan Wolfs goal is for the arts to
be an inescapable part of the Stanford expe
rience.
"We want the arts to be so accessible and

so visible and so much a part of everyday life
at Stanford that you can't come through
Stanford without some contact with it," Wolf
said, "and that's what it means to he a
Stanford student."
But given that the Arts Initiative's money
is of less value in the current economic cli
mate. its income is going toward the endow
ment for its future protection, rather than
salaries or programming. Though the Arts
Initiative is maintaining its commitments to
departments and programs, the amount of
monetary support has been reduced by 15 to
25 percent. Wolf said departments them
selves choose how the money should be real
located.

With diminished resources
and a dedication to protect
the core classes, the
drama department, in
particular, has cut 15 per
cent of its budget for lec
turers. So. in spite of student
interest and consistently
positive Course Rank
reviews, Klein's courses have
been cut and drastically reduced.

Klein's former students responded to the
cuts with surprise and dismay.
There have been few classes as success-

ful as [Drama] 1()4. and certainly no
drama class more successful than it."
said Brandon Silberstein '08. M.S. "09,
a current member of Stanford's
sketch comedy troupe l"he Rubber
Barons. "What other class, when
you're done with it. turns its partici
pants into a full-fledged — and now
very popular — performing group
that makes money and performs in
The Laugh Factory and Second City
and IO West?"
Silberstein said he fears the class
is getting cut because it isn't seen as
strictly academic as others.
Claire Slatterv *09, a current
SIMPS member.took Drama 103 her
freshman year and believes it strong
ly impacted her career at Stanford
for the better.
'improv is a state of mind, a state

of play, an attitude and a tone," she
said. "It's tine of those great classes
where even if you aren't studying
drama, anyone could take it, and
everyone should take it. It allows us
to make mistakes and celebrate fail
ures."
Improvising provides students
with an unconventional problem
solving skill set for even the most
practical scenarios, and has proven
that it has mass appeal. At times,
nearly a third of the students in
Drama 103 have gone to the design
department looking to develop their
creativity, their ability to collaborate
and methods for presenting their
ideas in interesting ways. Workshops
have also been offered at the GSB.
Jamie Cornejo '10. a Humßio
major who is currently enrolled in
Drama 103. was confused about the
program cuts, given the classes'
immense popularity.
"The first day of class. 68 people
showed up for 24 spots." Cornejo
said. "Prof. Klein had to open up

another section."
Klein said another section was
possible because funding is still mal
leable for the current quarter.
Department Chair Peggy Phelan
granted Klein's request.
Drama 104 was offered for the
first time last winter to IK students. In
its second quarter, the class has
increased to 29. In a similar vein.
Drama 103's four sections are consis
tently at capacity, This creates prob
lems for deciding which students will
be accepted into its one section dur
ing the 2009-2010 academic school
year. While some courses give stu
dents priority based on seniority.
Drama 103 is a prerequisite for the
SIMPS, so younger students — who
could potentially join the group
might be at an advantage.
The sacrifice of Drama 103 and
104 is just one example of the cuts
that are being made in the ;irts
departments.
"That all departments in
Humanities & Sciences have been

asked to cut their departmental
budgets by 10 percent for 2(XW-2010
drama is in no way being singled
out." wrote Richard Sailer, dean of
Humanities & Sciences, in an email
to The Daily. "Furthermore, the 10
percent cut for departments is less
than the average that the school as a
whole is absorbing."
While it is acknowledged that the
University as a whole is hurting, the
future of the arts at Stanford over the
next few years is in question.
"While all departments at
Stanford are suffering, the domino
effect in drama is particularly acute."
Phelan said. "When we cut produc
tion staff, we limit opportunities for
students to have their work pro
duced. And when we limit those
opportunities, we do indeed cut into
the educational part of our mission,
too — to study and produce per
formance."
The music department has felt the
impact of the economic crisis as well.
"Our department runs very lean

to begin with, so trimming has been a
difficult exercise," said Department
Chair Stephen Sano.
Sano added that, although
attempts have been made to stave off
reductions in the core curriculum,
the doctoral program in composition
has experienced a 66 percent reduc
tion in funding this year alone.
Furthermore, touring for the
Stanford Symphony Orchestra and
the Stanford Jazz Orchestra has been
put on an indefinite hold, while the
Wind Ensemble s tour to Italy was
cancelled. Sano equates this situation
to a varsity athletic team only being
able to play home games.
Yet, in spite of cuts, Sano main
tains some optimism.
"We have worked hard to sustain
the core of our academic program,
and it's been both amazing and
heartening to see how everyone in
the department has pulled together
to continue delivering our core mis
sion in the musical education of our
students," he said.

This sentiment is consistent
throughout the arts faculty. Klein
postulated that the budget cuts actu
ally serve as an opportunity for
improv. bv granting the program "a
chance to redistribute it even more
broadly." Options have been dis
cussed with the Arts Initiative, the
program in design, the GSB and
numerous others to receive funding
and even a formal joint.
Klein has a two-fold mission for
the future of Stanford improv — he
believes it is crucial for improvisation
to be taken for academic credit, and
for Stanford to maintain a top-notch
improv group, because "there are
things you learn onstage that you can
never get in a classroom."
"We're improvisers," Klein said,
"and if we can't come up with a cre
ative solution to this exact scenario,
then I don't think that we've been
learning our lessons."
