# Budget cuts hit drama dept.
## Next year, improv class Drama 103 reduced to one section, while Drama 104 cut altogether 
### LAURA STAMPLER 
Reduction and cancellations of tradition
ally popular classes in the arts have hit the
University, as budget cuts are no longer a dis
tant threat to students, hut a reality.
Student-favorite Drama 103: Beginning
Improvising will be reduced from four sec
tions to one section per year, and Drama 104:
Introduction to Sketch Comedy will be cut
entirely from the drama department's list of
offered courses.
Based on high enrollment and atten
dance. as well as consistent five-star ratings
on Courseßank, Daniel Klein — a Drama
103 alumnus and the current instructor lor

both courses — previously thought his class
es would be safe.
"And then another round of cuts came."
Klein said. "And I got an email over break
saying. 'I'm really sorry, but there's only
enough funding for one section next year.*
And it was unclear what funding there would
be for SIVIPS [Stanford's by-audition
improvisational group]."
Hie University has committed itself to
education in the arts with projects like the
Arts Initiative. As faculty leader of the Arts
Initiative, Bryan Wolfs goal is for the arts to
be an inescapable part of the Stanford expe
rience.
"We want the arts to be so accessible and

so visible and so much a part of everyday life
at Stanford that you can't come through
Stanford without some contact with it," Wolf
said, "and that's what it means to he a
Stanford student."
But given that the Arts Initiative's money
is of less value in the current economic cli
mate. its income is going toward the endow
ment for its future protection, rather than
salaries or programming. Though the Arts
Initiative is maintaining its commitments to
departments and programs, the amount of
monetary support has been reduced by 15 to
25 percent. Wolf said departments them
selves choose how the money should be real
located.

With diminished resources
and a dedication to protect
the core classes, the
drama department, in
particular, has cut 15 per
cent of its budget for lec
turers. So. in spite of student
interest and consistently
positive Course Rank
reviews, Klein's courses have
been cut and drastically reduced.

Klein's former students responded to the
cuts with surprise and dismay.
There have been few classes as success-
