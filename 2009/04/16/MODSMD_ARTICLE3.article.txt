GAME NOTES: Stanford's offense rolled against
the Broncos, busting out a 10-run sixth inning.
Six Cardinal players collected multiple hits, while
six pitchers combined to allow just six hits on the
night.

ITie Stanford baseball team contin
ued its hot hitting on Wednesday when
it defeated the Broncos at Santa Clara.
16-3.
The Cardinal (15-13) broke open
what was a competitive game with a
10-run sixth inning, the team's highest
scoring inning of the year.
Stanford took the lead in the top of
the first on a solo homerun by junior
left-fielder Toby Gerhart. Hie two
sport star drove a 2-1 pitch over the
left center field fence to give the
Cardinal a lead it would not relin
quish.
The Stanford offense added two
runs in both the third and fifth innings
on a pair of RBI knocks from sopho
more second baseman Colin Walsh
and an RBI double by sophomore
shortstop Jake Schlander. The visiting
Cardinal already had a 5-2 lead before
its sixth-inning explosion.
Senior first baseman Brent
Milleville began the rally with the first
of his two singles in the inning. Two
batters later, sophomore pinch hitter
Jonathan Kaskow greeted new pitcher
Joe Supple by doubling home
Milleville and sophomore catcher
Zach Jones, who also singled.


DYLAN PLOFKER/The Stanford Daily
Sophomore catcher Zach Jones and the Stanford offense erupted for 10 runs in the sixth inning in Santa Clara to lead the Cardinal past
the Broncos, 16-3. Next up for the red-hot Stanford bats is a showdown with one of the top teams in the country: Pac-10 rival ASU.
Hut that was just the beginning.
The Cardinal would go on to score
eight more runs in the sixth, aided by
three walks and two errors by the
Broncos (14-18). Milleville and junior
third baseman Adam Gaylord both
had two RBI singles in the innings.
Milleville was quick to point out
the serendipity that was needed to
put together a l()-run inning.
"Baseball is a funny game." he
said, "livery ball we hit seemed to
find a hole. ITiey made a few errors
and walked a few guys, and we just
piled on."
Lost in the exploits of the Stanford
offense was a solid performance by
the Cardinal pitching staff. With an
upcoming series at No. 4 Ari/ona
State, head coach Mark Marquess de
cided not to wear out any arms and lie
threw a series of pitchers at Santa
Clara.
Freshman Brian Busick pitched
two perfect innings to lead a parade
of six Cardinal pitchers â€” none
going more than a pair of innings
in holding the Broncos to just six hits.
Both Busick and sophomore Michael
Marshall threw two shutout innings.
I ike the pitching, the Cardinal of
fense was incredibly balanced. No
player had more than two RBI and
Walsh was the only player with three
hits. Milleville, Jones, Gaylord, Ger
hart and Schlander all had a pair of
hits.
With another standout perform
ance. the* Stanford offense seems to
have overcome the slump that
plagued the team early in the season.
The Cardinal scored 30 runs in two
midweek victories this week and vet
erans like Milleville and Gerhart ap
pear to have found their respective
strokes that helped lead Stanford to
the ( ollege World Series a year ago.
The early-season pressure felt by
the veterans has definitely subsided
as of late.
"Being a senior. I put too much
pressure on myself to do well." said
Milleville. one of the team's two sen
ior starters. "When we started doing
poorly. I just relaxed and focused on
seeing the ball and hitting it."
Since an atrocious l-V start, which
included a six-game losing streak, the

Cardinal is 12-4. putting the team in
position to make a run at a Regional
bid.
Stanford will have a difficult time
continuing its hot streak this week
end in Tempe, Ari/. ITie Sun Devils
are not only one of the best teams in
the country, but they will also be look
ing for revenge after Stanford took
two of three from them last year,
knocking ASU from the top oi the
national rankings in the process.
Can the offense keep it up?
Milleville hopes so.
"We are definitely going to have
to hit." he said. "They have some
great pitchers and hitters, so we will
need to score some runs."
The Cardinal will look to repeat
last season's success and continues
this season's surge when its faces Ari
zona State, beginning I riday at f>:3()
