### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
Kenneth Arrow, winner of the 1 1 >72 Nobel
Prize in Economics, recipient of a 2004
National Medal of Science and professor
emeritus in Economics at Stanford I Jniversity.
spoke Wednesday night on a broad range ol
topics in front of a packed crowd in ( 'übberley
Auditorium.
ITie presentation was one in a series of
talks entitled "Stanford Pioneers in Science."
which spotlights members of Stanford's facul
ty who have received a Nobel Prize, a
National Medal of Science or a Mac Arthur
I ellowship (irant.
Economics professor John Shoven opened
the talk v\ith an overview ol Arrow's life and
accomplishments, referring to him as "one ol

the greatest living economists."
Arrow was then interviewed by Paul
Costello. executive director of communication
lor the Stanford University School of
Medicine, on topics ranging from his child
hood and time in the Army to his views on the
current economic situation and healthcare
reform.
In response to questions about the current
economic crisis. Arrow said lie believed that
the strategies employed by the federal gov
ernment— particularly by Eawrence
Summers. President Obama's chief economic
adviser and Arrow's nephew - were basical
ly sound. In particular, he praised the govern
ment's efforts to bring the financial system
back into order and to jumpstart consumer

Nobel Prize-recipient and Economics Professor Kenneth Arrow told last night's packed
Cubberly Auditorium audience that the Great Depression led him to pursue economics.
demand through the various stimulus
measures.
Nonetheless, he was hesitant to
speak too concretely about his views
on the nation's immediate future.
"The idea that we can actually
predict what's going to happen with
any certitude is foolish. It you look at
the record of economic forecasting,
it's very poor." Arrow warned.
1 le did. however, express his belief
that the economic downturn has not
vet reached its lowest point. He was
also hesitant to agree with the notion
that the economy's fundamentals
were sound, pointing to less-than

stellar GDP growth rates in the U.S.
in recent decades, the country's grow
ing trade deficit with the rest of the
world and its relatively low savings
rate.
When questioned by Costello
about his childhood. Arrow identified
his experiences as a youth during the
Great Depression as particularly
formative.
"1 think a lot of people who grew
up during the Great Depression who
might otherwise have gone into other
fields were stimulated to get into eco
nomics. to try to figure out where
things went wrong, to try to figure out
how to fix things," Arrow said.
Arrow was awarded the Nobel
Prize in Economics in 1972 both for
his breakthrough contributions to
general equilibrium theory and for
his Ph.D. dissertation, which virtually

founded the now well-established
field of social choice theory. He
received the award at age 51. which,
to this day. remains the youngest age
at which anyone has received the
award.
Social choice theory, which studies
ways in which individual preferences
can be aggregated to determine social
choices, is now a standard part of col
lege economics and political science
curricula. Fundamental to this theory
is what is now called the "Arrow
Impossibility Theorem." which
Arrow formulated in his Ph.D. disser
tation.
He was also awarded the presti
gious National Modal of Science in
2004 by President Bush, becoming
only the ninth economist to win the
award.
A total of five of Arrow's Ph.D.

advisees have also gone on to win
Nobel Prizes, a number believed to
be unparalleled in his field.
In addition to being a highly deco
rated academician. Arrow has been
active in public policy matters, serv
ing on the Council of Economic
Advisers during President Kennedy's
administration, among other posi
tions.
Arrow has also published a num
ber of seminal papers on health eco
nomics. In Wednesday's talk, he
delved briefly into his views on
healthcare reform in America,
expressing his view that the current
system is largely nonsensical and
iirguing in favor oi a single payer sys
tem.
"The current employer-based
healthcare system really does not
make any sense," Arrow said. "In
order to have a healthy, functioning
capitalist system, you are going to
have some firms getting bigger and
some getting smaller. That is how
growth and technological progress
are fueled. But if you have firms pro
viding health care to their employees,
that provides a disincentive to firms
downsizing."
