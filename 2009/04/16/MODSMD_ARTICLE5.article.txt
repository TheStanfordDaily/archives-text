# CAMPUS EVENTS
## Career Fair seen as last chance Students struggle to find paid internships 
### MOLLY SPAETH 
In the midst of the toughest job mar
ket in recent memory, many students and
soon-to-be graduates are still searching
for jobs and internships. The Career
Development Center's Spring Career
Fair, which began Wednesday and con
tinues today, provides yet another
opportunity for students to meet
employers in their continuing search -
but some fear it may already be too late.
"Compared to most Stanford stu
dents. I feel really behind." said Lauren
Swart/ "11. "The fact that 1 have an
unpaid internship already lined up
makes me feel better, but 1 really want to
try to find a paid internship."
With the global economic crisis con
tinuing to swirl, paid internships seem to
be particularly elusive. As a result, the
competition for the limited number of
available paid internships has inevitable
toughened.
"There were a few signs at the C "areer
Fair that said 'Paid Internship.* and I
noticed that those stands were super
full." Swart/ said.
But many employers say there is still
room for optimism.
Jessica Blatnik,a representative from
QUIA, a San Mateo-based educational
technology program, said her company is
offering more positions to new graduates
this year than ever before. She did note,
however, that the economic crisis has
had an effect on the application process.
"1 think we're getting less targeted
resumes." Blatnik said. "For example, we
would get a resume with all finance
experience for a sales position when nor
mally we would get a resume with more
sales or marketing experience."
Blatnik attributed the increase in
general resumes to the instability in the
financial market. ITiough the resumes
are less targeted, she still welcomes the
increase in applicants.
"It's nice to have a big volume — it
gives us more people to choose from,"
she said. "We're getting resumes from
more people than usual, which is always
positive."
Chris Weber, a representative from
software engineering firm Rapl eaf. said
that although he has seen a lot more
applications this year than in years past,
his company has not cut any position
openings this year. In addition. Weber
had some good news for job applicants.
"Just be thankful you're graduating
this year, rather than last year." lie said
"My perception is that people are start
ing to hire again. There's a percep
tion that we've gotten over the
worst of it.and now people are
more comfortable extending the
credit of hiring."
Projections of a better job market
in the future, however, don't get grad
uating seniors — or their bank
accounts — too far.
"It definitely seems that the num
ber of entry-level positions is down."
said Marisa Dowline '09. "It's really

hard, because 1 need to find some
thing that will pay. I don't want to go
into more debt before 1 go to medical
school."
Mallory Bounds '()<S first made
contact with her current employer at
last year's Spring Career Fair. She
returned this year to the fair, not as a
student, but as a recruiter for the pub
lic policy consulting firm SPHERE
Institute, where she's been working
since graduation. Bounds had advice
for anxious students worried about
finding a job.
"People are under the impression
that if you don't have a job now. it's
too late." she said. "But a lot of peo
ple my year didn't get jobs until clos

er to graduation. I was a little pan
icked. hut everything ended up heing
just fine. There is still plenty of time."
Although there are still many job
openings, some students have taken
the competitiveness of this year's
market to heart, pledging to be even
more aggressive in the job search
next year.
"I'm going to start looking this
summer for internships for next sum
mer." said Kelsey King '11.
The Spring Career Fair has its sec
ond and final session today in
Tresidder, noon to 4 p.m.
