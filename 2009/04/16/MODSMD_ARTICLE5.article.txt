## Career Fair seen as last chance Students struggle to find paid internships 
### MOLLY SPAETH 
In the midst of the toughest job mar
ket in recent memory, many students and
soon-to-be graduates are still searching
for jobs and internships. The Career
Development Center's Spring Career
Fair, which began Wednesday and con
tinues today, provides yet another
opportunity for students to meet
employers in their continuing search -

general resumes to the instability in the
financial market. ITiough the resumes
are less targeted, she still welcomes the
increase in applicants.
"It's nice to have a big volume â€” it
gives us more people to choose from,"
she said. "We're getting resumes from
more people than usual, which is always

Chris Weber, a representative from
software engineering firm Rapl eaf. said
that although he has seen a lot more
applications this year than in years past,
