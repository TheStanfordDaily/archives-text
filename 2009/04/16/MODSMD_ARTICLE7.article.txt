## GSC members criticize $167 Vaden fee Students feel left out of dialogue 
### DANIEL BUI STAFF WRITER 
Last night, the Graduate Student
Council (GSC) met with members of
the University administration to dis
cuss the recently announced 5167 per
quarter charge to students for Vaden
Health Center serv ices.
The fee. announced last week, was
met with great discontent from the
student body for its application to
even those who do not request servic
es from Vaden and for the lack of stu
dent body input in the decision.
As a result, the GSC met with Vice
Provost of Student Affairs Greg
Boardman and Vaden Director Ira
Freedman to address student con
cerns about the causes of and motiva
tions for the new charge.
Boardman cited the University's

economic difficulties, which have
made it hard for Vaden to juggle its
finances and maintain its services. He
noted that other options, notably staff
position cuts, were thoroughly consid
ered before implementing the fee.
However, in light of the many
University staff layoffs thus far and
the millions of dollars that the health
center needs to make up due to the
cuts, "we felt at this point and time it
was necessary."
In years past, a general fund
derived from student tuition had paid
for the majority of primary medical
services offered by Vaden. Boardman
and Freedman said that the health
care model for future years at
Stanford would provide much more
transparency in showing how much
money would go to each service.
"The model that we're going to be
using next year will be much more
clear," Freedman reassured. "[The
issue of transparency] just hasn't come
up prior to this because the University
has just been providing something
that was free."
One of the more controversial
areas of discussion was the decision to
distribute costs across all students,
including those who don't use Vaden
services.
"I think the University is selecting
the philosophy [of distributing costs]
because charging people at the time of
service heightens the penalty of being
ill or injured." Freedman clarified.
"[Vaden] provides a community good
that I think is appropriate to distribute
throughout the entire community."

When concerns were raised that
the fee. created as a solution to the
economic situation, would still be
imposed upon students after the
financial crisis has subsided, adminis
trators were hesitant to guarantee that
the fee would be removed from the
student bill.
"It's subject to annual review and
adjustment," Freedman said. "I think
it will be a matter of where our
expenses are relative to inflation and
our sources of funds. I don't see that
we're going to [come back to having]
a majority of the services covered bv
the general fund."
Mary van de Hoven, a third-year
earth sciences graduate student, was
concerned about the difficulties some
graduate students might have in pay
ing for healthcare and suggested a
lower base price accompanied with a
co-pay for students who use Vaden.
"It feels like a lot of people would
be happier if it were a smaller base
fee, with a little bit of co-pav." added
Fen Zhao, a fifth-year student in
applied sciences, citing similar systems
for healthcare used at the University
of California schools.
Many GSC delegates were also
incensed by the fact that the student
body was left poorly informed about
the process of creating the fee.
"1 feel like, in this case, student
input was not sought." said Ryan
Peacock, a third-year graduate stu
dent in chemical engineering."lt's dis
appointing. seeing as you're putting a
large fee on everyone's bill. At no
point were we really consulted or

were opinions gotten.
To address everyone's lingering
eoncerns, GSC co-Chair Polina
Segalova proposed the creation of a
Vaden Advisory Committee that
would serve as the liaison between the
student body and administrators in
further discussions.
Iliis is still an early part of the
process," Boardman reminded. "We
are nowhere near the final step of
every detail of our new policy. As we
continue discussions, we're going to
communicate to you any further
details."
To abate a few of the concerns,
Freedman mentioned that the
increase in Cardinal Care would he
5.<S percent, much less than in previous
years, in part because of the creation
of the fee and changes in healthcare
costs.
The GSC also welcomed its recent
ly elected delegates last night.
Delegates discussed the 33 percent
decrease in voter turnouts, citing poor
publicity strategy and lack of informa
tion about candidates prior to the
election.
Incoming ASSIJ President David
Gobaud '08. MS '10 also appeared at
the meeting, promising closer coordi
nation between the graduate student
body and the ASSIJ.
"An overall goal is getting more
graduate students involved and know
ing what the ASSU is doing to work
on uraduate issues," he said.
