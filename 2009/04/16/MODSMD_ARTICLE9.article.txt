## EDITORIAL Drop deadline change flies under radar 
### 
Unbeknownst to the majority of the
undergraduate student body,the Fac
ulty Senate passed a measure at its
March 5 meeting that seems destined to in
crease student anxiety, even though it's
under the guise of simplifying the academic
calendar. Without any undergraduate input,
the Senate voted to move the drop deadline
up an entire week, so that it coincides with
the add deadline, and combined the grading
and withdrawal deadline at the end of the
eighth week of the quarter.
I he change may appear minute, and, in
deed. it was overshadowed at the time by an
uproar over the loss of our beloved holiday
on the first Monday of every quarter. Con
sider. however, what a difference one week
of classes can make in a 10-week quarter
when it comes to determining whether you
can squeak a passing grade out of that ehem
class, or whether you need to lighten your
load for your mental sanity.
By week three, many students have yet to
hand in a major assignment or sit for an
exam, and they have no real idea of the pro
fessor's expectations for midterms or essays.
And yet. as of next year, the third week of
each quarter will be every student's last
chance to make a binding decision about
whether or not to stay in or opt out.
The Senate claims that "this (new] calen
dar simplifies life at Stanford in that it re
duces the number of deadlines from five to
three."They justify the combination by not
ing that "one ol the arguments frequently
used for keeping |these different deadlines]
relates to student stress."The Senate claims.
"What really causes the biggest stress for
students is when they mess up one or the
other deadlines. (They find] they need to
drop a class [because] they've got an awful
midterm grade, but it's too late now to drop

and it causes more frustration, more stress to
have those [deadlines] separated."
Though the editorial board respects the
Faculty Senate's consideration of our stress
levels, and admits we may have so much on
our plates that three deadlines for changing
courses are better than five, we see no reason
why the Senate did not push the add dead
line back, instead of moving the drop dead
line up. Such a move would have served the
same simplification purposes, and students
could finalize their schedules after three
weeks of class, with a far better sense of how
great a workload they are taking on as they
head into the crunch time of the quarter.The
first midterm grade is generally a good sign
of how a student is doing overall, and stu
dents under the new system will be more
likely to lack this valuable indicator when
they have to choose to drop a class so early
in the quarter.
The fairly straightforward case of this date
change exposes a larger failing in the way
Faculty Senate meetings are conducted. The
meetings are notably absent of student input,
with the exception of the ASSU Executives,
and many of the decisions under the Senate's
jurisdiction seem more suited to an ASSII
Undergraduate Senate meeting, as they
stand to affect students at least as greatly as
they affect faculty. While the Faculty Senate
has our interests in mind, their closed-door
deliberations about the academic calendar
and other issues may bind students to re
forms that may end up detracting from the
Stanford experience, and ultimately compli
cate the already frenzied add/drop/freak
out-and-withdrawal process. While three
deadlines are nicer than five, the chance to
postpone those agonizing drop decisions one
more week is worth the slight inconvenience
of our current calendar.
