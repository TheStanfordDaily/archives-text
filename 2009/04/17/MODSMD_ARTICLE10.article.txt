# ARTIST PROFILE: DESIGNER KAREN LUM

In the second part of four-part
lead-up to Charity Fashion Show,
Intermission interviews yet another
student designer .. . the talented
Karen Lum

Intermission (i): How did you get interested in fashion in the
first place?
Karen L.um (KL): My mom always sewed, so when I was
young, I took a community college class tin sewing and how to
make clothing. My mom never actively encouraged this. At
first, I just did it to fix clothing, but then I started making my
own things. I made both my junior and senior prom dresses.
That was the first time I'd ever made whole garments.
When 1 started, I used to make clothes because I couldn't
afford to buy them. So 1 thought, if I can't afford to buy it, I'll
just make it. Now I do it more as an artistic pursuit; if I had an
idea, I would make it. I don't even care if I can wear the things
I make in my life or if I have an occasion to wear it to. It's about
the design and the execution.
i: Why did you decide to showcase a collection for Charity
Fashion Show?
KL: Well, I will make clothes no matter what — Charity
Fashion Show was just a deadline to get stuff done by, and a
way to showcase my work. I have to have 12 pieces done before
the show; even if it weren't for the show, I would have done
these 12 pieces anyway, just not by the deadline.
i: Did you participate in Charity Fashion Show last year?
KL: Yes I did. It was a lot of fun — it was exciting to see my
stuff on the runway. I make my clothes to be worn, so it was
great having them shown for the first time.
i: Tell us a little bit about your upcoming line.
KL: This line will definitely be better than last year's. I wanted
my line to actually have coherency. There will be a unifying
theme for my show and I'm putting more thought into it. Last
year, my show was just a mix-and-mash of all the things I'd
ever made; this year will be better.
For example, I'm showcasing a piece that is made complete
ly out of recycled material. Some of my friends bought a ton of
sweaters for a student performance group. After they were
done, they gave all of them to me to sec if I could play with it.
I cut each sleeve open — the sweaters were made of cheap
engineered fabric, and the sweaters were so bit; that even when

I cut the sleeve open, there were giant pieces of fabric. 1 made
a military jacket-coat/dress out of all of those sleeves. So yes,
the first few pieces in my show will be made out of complete
ly unconventional fabrics.
In my opinion, fashion is about having fun and feeling
good in what you're wearing. It can be jeans and a t-shirt. I like
Rihanna's style; it's very badass, with lots of exposed zippers.
My goal in life is to never have to wear business casual,
i: What fabrics did you use in your line?
KL: Well, I used those recycled sleeves. One dress is made total
ly from tie-dye silk that I got from China. However, I only had
enough money for 3 yards, so no matter what I needed to
make sure that I had enough — I can't go back to China and
buy more. A Rodarte-inspired dress that I'm making is made
from four scarves from China. I bought the scarves in purple,
black, red and beige. 1 like nonconventional color palettes; I
like to mix it up a bit. I wish I could make a Herve Leger dress,
but I wouldn't even know where to begin.
i: Is fashion design something you're planning on pursuing as
a career?
KL: No, no .. . I'm a product design major. I want to apply
the design process into creating solutions for social change,
such as alleviating people out of poverty. I want to use tech
nology to create solutions for social problems. Fashion is fun,
but at the end of the day it's not what I want to do — I want
to do something that will make me feel fulfilled and truly
make a difference.
i: Any shopping advice for Stanford?
KL: I'd encourage the people to think outside of Northface,
Uggs and Longchamp. I just think Longchamp bags are over
priced — they're made of nylon! I'd also encourage people
here to not follow the trends or the seasons. Look for what's
interesting!
