## Japanese home cooking at Gombei 
### 
Sushi is usually the first thing that
comes to mind when people think of Japanese food, but
it is often overlooked that Japan is also home to a diverse cui
sine that goes far beyond raw fish over rice. While a bit off
the beaten track as far as the Stanford bubble goes, Gombei,
located on El Camino in the northern part of Menlo Park,
offers generous portions of Japanese cooking at reasonable
prices.
Gombei is not a place that is likely to get a lot of walk-in
business. Its location near the Menlo-Atherton border is
hardly a center of fine dining, and the exterior of the building
brings to mind that of a renovated McDonalds. But this is
not a case to judge a book by its cover. If you are willing to
stop, you will quickly find a very crowded parking lot and
will likely have to wait for a table. There is no actual list to get
on — tables are simply assigned based on who is in front of
the physical queue. And for maximum efficiency, only full

parties are seated. This highly utilitarian setup is managed by
the busy, but always friendly, hostess.
The menu at Gombei consists of very standard Japanese
fair: tcriyaki, tempura, donburi and a bit of sushi. Unless you
have your heart set on something specific, perhaps the best
way to order is the large plate special, which is not on the
menu but is listed on a whiteboard in the main dining room.
It included chicken tcriyaki, shrimp and vegetable tempura, a
few pieces of maki, a few pieces of sushi, a croquette, rice,
salad and miso soup for $11. The first time I went to
Gombei, I immediately assumed that the special was a choice
of some of these items, but indeed all are included. The
teriyaki was tasty without being too salty, and the tempura
was crispy. The croquette was surprisingly good with large
amounts of curry mixed into the potato, though it was a little
on the soggy side. The sushi perhaps was a weaker point of
the meal, but was still completely passable and superior to
now the perennial but defunct sushi punching bag that was
Sushi Tomo. Overall, the food can be described as solid.
Gombei's service is not the main attraction, but it gets
the job done. The wait staff tends to be sufficiently friendly,
albeit rushed on account of the constant crowds. The food
always arrives in a timely manner, and while the servers tend
not to be the type that constantly checks on you, it isn't hard
to flag someone down if you need something else.

There isn't a single part of Gombei that stands out
superlatively, but putting all of the pieces together makes for
a very respectable combination. The food is good, the service
does what it needs to do, and for the prices, the portions are
extremely generous. He warned that Gombei is not the place
to go for a first date; but for some reliable Japanese food at a
price that almost seems too good to be true, Gombei will get
you hooked.
