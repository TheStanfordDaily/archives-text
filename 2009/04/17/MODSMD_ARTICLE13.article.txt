# Roxy goes Greek!

Fraternities tend to inadvertently act as "man candy"
magnets for the rest of campus (loose definition of
"candy"), and with this year's rush process now
coming to an end, there is going to be a fresh supply of

hot young men ready to prove their worth. On this
note, the topic that Roxy wants to explore is, which
fraternity offers the best sex?! Stanford's frats all dif
fer in terms of the stereotypes and attributes associ
ated with them, which then affect the type of guys
that join them. So how do they all stack up against
one another? Muse along with me as I dive into
some of Stanford's popular fraternities.

The first frat that I have to talk about is Sigma Nu.
Situated comfortably on the lower Row, this frat continues

to maintain a relatively upstanding reputation on campus. Their
guys are incredibly diverse (even in sexuality), genuinely friendly
and, most of all, they all tend to have superman complexes.

Although wanting to save the world is a noble trait, it does not nec
essarily mean that you'll get good sex from them. Not to mention, 1
definitely know quite a few Sigma Nu guys who are so focused on
saving the world that they barely have time for anything else!
However, if you're looking for some romance and passion, these
guys might be your best bet — Roxy would even go so far as to say
that they are dateable! On the other hand, getting straight-up sex
from them might be hit or miss ...
Jumping across the street takes us to the front steps of Sigma
Chi. This frat is probably the most stereotypical in that it embodies
what you'd expect from a frat — womanizing, chest-thumping
hicks who can sometimes come off as jerks, to be blunt. Roxy does
n't really have any problem with this and the thought of being
"used" by one of them after a drunken night of partying in their
newly renovated house is pretty appealing. Roxy knows that if she
wants a night of no-strings-attached, hot sex, this will probably be a

good place to go.

Moving further up the Row will then
land us in the smoky den of Theta Delt.
This place is nicknamed the "stoner" frat
for good reason. Roxy was recently walk
ing their halls, and it was literally impos
sible not to get high from all the residual
fumes. Of course, 1 don't really have a
1 problem with this, but when it comes to
getting down and dirty, my only concern
is that all that smoking might affect one's

... performance ... if you know what I
mean. Roxy's definitely been with a cuv or two

who wasn't able to meet all of her needs because of
a little Mary Jane in their system.

Taking a few steps from Theta Delt will lands u:
in the jock-infested heaven that is Kappa Alpha (KA) .

KA definitely upholds its stereotype of being the "athletic" frat in
that many of its members belong to some athletic team. If Roxy
had to choose a frat to get her freak on, this would be her No. 1
spot. Although I like all sorts of guys, I would be lying if I said that
I didn't have a soft spot in my heart... or my [insert other body
part here] for a tall, muscle-bound jock who knows what it takes
for a good work out. Home run, touchdown, SCORE — it all
sounds hot to me.
Now when talking about frat sex, 1 guess I would be remiss in
not including the guys over at SAE . I'm sure that spending a night
with them is definitely hotter and kinkier than most, especially if
you're with one of those mysterious members of the infamous
KREs. That is, if you're lucky enough to have a choice, or even
remember the night...
XOXO,
