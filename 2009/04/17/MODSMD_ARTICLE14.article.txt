## Crepes Café has great TASTE UNDER WRAPS 
### 
The Bay Area has quite a few hidden food gems, especially close to Stanford campus. Don't
feel like you have egg on your face if you haven't heard about some of them. A five
minute drive or a quick CalTrain trip will take you to one of the best creperies in the area
— Menlo Park's Crepes Cafe.
Rated one of the Best Restaurants in Menlo Park by U.S. Local Business Association, the
Crepes Cafe has some of the finest crepes in the Bay Area in a quaint and homey cafe setting.
Spring is an especially good time to go and take advantage of the Cafe's spacious patio seating!
Put simply, the Crepes Cafe provides patrons with a plethora of possibilities —
Intermission has spent many a meal here and still hasn't explored entire sections of the menu!
On the savory side, crepe offerings include La Complete, with ham and cheese, to crepes
with salmon, goat cheese, chicken or scallops. Veggie options are a-plenty, with onions,
Portobello mushrooms or a medley. Also, if you can't decide, you could also create your very
own crepe. The wait staff is particularly helpful in assisting customers in navigating the Cafe's
array of edible delights.
For our sweeter readers, the Cafe's options range from fruit and chocolate mousse to its
mainstay, sweet crepes. Beginners may want to stick with the Simple Crepe, with jam or honey.
The more adventurous should try the Flambeed with Crand Merrier or Cognac. I usually stick
with my favorite crepe in town — the Gargantua, which blends almonds, crepes and three
scoops of delicious gelato.
What if you went to a creperie and you don't want crepes? Don't fret, friend! Crepes Cafe's
got you covered with sandwiches, hot and cold, soups and salads. In addition, they've got
omelets and scrambled eggs. The most expensive options at the Cafe are the Fondues, which,
focusing on cheeses, are served with a crepe, salad and some fruit. They'll set you back around
$20 per person; the average crepe costs around $8.

As crepes arc a utility food — useful for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks — the Cafe has
generous hours (Monday to Saturday, 8 a.m. to 9 p.m., and Sunday, 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.). Word to
the wise: Sunday brunch is particularly popular, and you may want to call about availability for
a scat around brunch-time. Overall, Crepes Cafe is definitely worth a visit to explore their
expansive offerings and — for those romantically oriented — a neat date spot! If you need
additional incentive, the Stanford Unofficial Guide includes a buy one, get one free coupon to
Crepes Cafe, which makes this sweet deal even sweeter.
