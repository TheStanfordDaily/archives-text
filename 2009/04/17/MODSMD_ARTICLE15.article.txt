Today marks the launch of the ninth consecutive
Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, an annual
three-day odyssey into the heart of Indio, Calif, for an
unrivaled audio experience. With over 120 artists performing
throughout a variety of stages and tents, this year's lineup
promises to be more eclectic than ever, featuring up-and-com
ing artists to well-established names in electronica, rock and
hip hop.
While students may have been thrown off by the rocket
ing prices (three-day passes cost $250 a pop) or the extreme
desert temperatures (Saturday and Sunday are forecasted to hit
the mid to upper 90s) there is no doubt that Goldenvoice, the
event's organizers, have created a lineup with something for
everyone.
This year's festival, for some, may feel like a backtrack to
the'7os and '80s. Among the seasoned veterans performing are
Paul McCartney, former Smith's front man Morrissey and
everyone's favorite goth rockers, The Cure. McCartney, who
has branded himself "The Fireman," is still going on strong, 30
years removed from The Beatles, and will close out Friday
night with a performance on the main Coachella stage. The
Cure is set to close the proceedings on the same stage Sunday
night.
For those born in the last quarter of the 20th century, do
not be disappointed! Indie favorites Fleet Foxes and Kilo Kiley
lead singer Jenny Lewis are scheduled for Saturday. Those hop
ing to immerse themselves in the newest sounds from the elec
tronic and dance scene need to look no further then Crystal
Castles, performing Sunday, and MSTRKRFT and The
Chemical Brothers, both slated for Saturday.
One trend highlighted at this festival is the return of per
formers for a second bite at the apple. Among artists perform
ing for a second time are the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, stopping by

before kicking off a transatlantic tour, Stanford-favorite Girl
Talk, Silversun Pickups and Swedish trio, Peter Bjorn and John.
Space rocker and festival regular, Perry Farrcll will be making
his ninth appearance at Coachella.
For hip-hop aficionados, the festival has penciled in a per
formance on Sunday night for Public Enemy, featuring Chuck
1) and the "timeless" Flavor Flav. Also performing are I.upe
Fiasco and Mathangi Arulpragasam, better known as M.1.A., a
substitute for the visa-challenged Amy Winehouse, who was
denied access into the U.S. — no surprise there!

Other headliners for this years event include Franz
Ferdinand and The Killers, both of whom are mid-tour. The

musical return of Travis Barker and DI A.M., performing
as TRVSDJ-AM, also promises to be a spectacle as the t
A

two were the sole survivors of a plane
in late 2008.

For those of you who shelled out the big
bucks and arc ready to brave the heat, prepare for an epic
audio journey. Ready your sunscreen, tank tops and tents, and
make some memories.
For those spending the weekend within the bubble that is
the Farm, live vicariously through the experiences of your
friends and check this section out next week for a full
Coachella Festival review.
