## Intermission's 10-Minute Guide to Amateur Photogtraphy IF YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT BUYING AN AMATEUR CAMERA, HERE'S INTERMISSION'S ADVICE... 
### 
Get either the Nikon D-40 or the Canon EOS Rebel XTi. Priced just under $500, the Nikon D
40 is the ideal starter camera; it lias a good system and is the smallest of the dSLR (digital Single
Lens Reflex) cameras on the market. The Canon Rebel is very similar in size and function.
If money is no concern, you may consider buying a more expensive camera body — they j
can go into the thousands. But in terms of image quality, you'd be doing yourself a favor if you

bought a cheaper digital SL.R body and saved your money for better lens or wireless flash; lens and
lighting have more impact on your photos anyway.
Rest assured that Nikon and Canon are the best; they make better lenses, have been around
longer and have very high-quality gear all the way to high-end professional stuff. They've been the
standard in the industry for a long time because everyone knows a camera is only as good as its lens.
From here on out, all we say will only be applicable to digital SLR cameras.

Lens
The biggest bang for your
buck lenses are the 50mm
f/1.8 prime (they do not zoom

lenses for both Nikon and Canon.
Both are much sharper and can gather
several times more light than the kit lenses

that come with most cameras, and at only around $100
new they're as cheap as you're going to find.

The
Most Important
thing

...about learning to be a photographer is just know
ing where to look for ideas and inspiration. We've
left you with tons of links and fodder to play with, so
get started! Know, though, that it's all right to try to
recreate a picture you really like — in the process
of re-creation, the image always changes and
becomes uniquely your own. Try to soak up
whatever you see and whatever you live,

and you'll be sure to improve!

Where to go
FOR INSPIRATION

The Strobists Blog
http://strobist.blogspot.coni
This site is all about learning to use your small
wireless flash, and has a ton of general point
ers. It has plenty of do-it-yourself tech
niques that won't break the bank and ha*
a very large international following.

Chase Jams' blog
http://blog.chasejarvis.com/blog/
Chase Jarvis offers unique perspectives
into life as a photographer, and the
effort and techniques used to get his
amazing shots. Some of the most inter
esting windows into being a photogra
pher tan be found in his FRAMES videos,
where he shows all the pictures taken for a

photo session in rapid succession so you can
witness how a shoot evolves and narrows down
from thousands of pictures to only a few.

Drew Gardner's blog
http://thalarkart.com
Most of us can't afford cameras with prices reaching five digits, thousand
dollar smoke machines or casually renting a water buffalo — but it sure
can be fun to read about someone who can. In his blog, Drew goes over
his gear, techniques and the hurdles he faces to achieve his breathtaking
location photography. Watch him fly to India for an authentic elephant
photo session, or re-create a swarm of tornadoes in his room. This blog is
definitely a source of inspiration.
Joe McNally VThe Hot Shoe Diaries: Big l ight from
Small Flashes"
Part coffee table, part how-to book, "The Hot Shoe Diaries" teaches how
to expertly wield your small flashes (such as the SB-600 or 580 F.X) while
sharing very inspiring pictures from McNally's esteemed career and how
he took them. It also covers everything from steady camera holding tech
niques to establishing a connection with your subject.
Flickr
Nothing's better for inspiration (and learning what not to do) than brows
ing through lots of photos. Find some pools you're interested in, such as
the Portrait Pool or the Strobists.com Pool, and just soak in the nearly
infinite photos.
