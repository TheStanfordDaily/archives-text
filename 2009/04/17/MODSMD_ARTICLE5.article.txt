## "State of Play" keeps you in state of confusion... 
### 
How deep does the rabbit hole go? "State of Play"
is a story of conspiracy at the highest levels of
media, government and business. lust when
you think you've got it all figured out, new information
is revealed that changes the game completely. While the
film is certainly fast-paced, intellectual, and fun to
watch, some elements of the narrative were initially
underdeveloped and confusing, which made the subse
quent twists and turns more difficult to follow.
"State of Play" begins with a chase scene — a

young black male sprinting through the streets of
D.C., racing through stores, and finally hiding
behind a dumpster in a dark alley. He breathes heav

ily, with deep sighs of relief—but as always in
films, characters are never more vulnerable than .
in the moments after the danger has passed. The

camera moves from a close-up of the young man's
face to the backlit silhouette of the chaser, holding .
menacing gun, who shoots the defenseless man sever

al times without blinking. A cyclist passing by gets sim
ilar treatment, presumably because he was simply in the
wrong place at the wrong time. Though the murder
unfolds clearlv before our eyes, the introductory scene

only gives us a surface-level understanding of why these
people were murdered — a mystery that the film spends the
next two hours trying to fully unravel.

Cal McAffrey, brilliantly played by Russell Crowe, is
introduced by the blast of Flogging Molly punk song, driving
his 15 year-old Saab and eating fast food as he makes his way
towards the crime scene. He embodies the figure of the irrev
erent journalist, willing to break the rules if it leads to the truth
because he sees himself as "above it all." He is fiercely inde

pendent, and seems to like it that way — as he says,"l got
mouths to feed ... goldfish."
Back at his newspaper's headquarters, a young and intel
ligent online journalist Delia Frye (played by Rachel
McAdams) approaches Cal about a seemingly unrelated

storv that she has just begun working on regarding the recent

suicide of a congressman's personal aide with whom the con
gressman was supposedly having an affair. The senator
Stephen Collins, played by Ben Affleck, had also just initiated
large-scale legal proceedings against a corporation called
FointCorps, which is vaguely described as a private military
operations company. But while Point Corps is instantly recog
nizable as the "bad guys," it's hard for the audience to follow
the charges against them without ever gaining a basic under
standing of who they are even supposed to be.
Though Cal dismisses Delia as just a "blogger," she's a thor
ough enough journalist to find out that Cal and Stephen were
roommates in college. And when Stephen shows up on Cal's
doorstep later that night insisting that his aide's death was
not a suicide, threads begin to appear between people and
events, suggesting that nothing is coincidental.
Of course, everyone and everything is connected — but not
in the ways that the audience could anticipate. 1 particularly
loved the film because it also provided a eulogy to the dying art
