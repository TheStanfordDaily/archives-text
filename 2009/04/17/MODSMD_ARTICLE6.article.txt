# Editor's Blog: Kyle's TV Corner

Greetings all, and welcome to my new blog ... even though it is in
print. Anyway, as you know, here at Intermission, we strive to
bring you coverage on the latest, exciting arts and entertainment
events that arc going on around campus, the Bay Area and the rest of the
country. Unfortunately, one thing we noticed was that we don t cover
enough is T.V.! I know for a fact that Stanford students love watching
television, since it makes for quick and amusing study breaks. Enter my
T.V. Corner! Each week, I'll be bringing you the latest scoop on some of
your favorite television shows ... or, I should say, some of MY favorite
shows.
First up this week is the seemingly never-ending phenomenon that
is "American Idol." To bring everyone up to speed, the show is currently
in its eighth season (yes, it really has been going on for eight years), and

this week the top seven remaining contestants performed songs from the
cinema. The contestants were "mentored" by director Quentin
Tarantino, who seemed to offer only semi-useful advice. In terms of the
contestants, although they all had a plethora of excellent songs to choose
from, I was actually pretty disappointed by everyone's performances. The
remaining contestants all ended up choosing and performing slow bal
lads, which when watched again, all sound oddly similar to one another.
Of course there were a few standouts amongst the bunch. Sixteen
year-old Allison Iraheta sang Aerosmith's "Don't Wanna Miss a Thing,"
and although her rendition wasn't that great, it was a good choice on her
part — not to mention it was a nice change of pace after all the other
ballads. Fan favorite Adam Lambert also stood out, as usual, as he per
formed "Born to be Wild." Although I am constantly displeased by his
choice of songs (he always chooses really old and cliche pieces) one can
not deny his talent and vocal range. America's sweetheart Danny Gokey
also pulled in a strong performance, while Kris Allen, in my opinion, had
the best song choice of the night — choosing "Falling Slowly from the
musical film "Once."
Cut to Wednesday night, the night when host Ryan Seacrest tortures
the contestants with the results. This week's bottom three consisted of
Anoop Desai, I.il Rounds and Matt Giraud. Before the final elimination
results were given, the show consisted of its usual fanfare, and even
included two live performances from previous idol contestant Jennifer
Hudson and tween sensation Miley Cyrus. Hudson's performance was
boring, and is off of her new, and first, album — apparently it took her
five years after "Idol" to release an album. Cyrus' performance was defi
nitely the more entertaining of the two. Singing her latest single " I he
Climb," Cyrus threw her passion and energy into her performance —
which was horribly amusing because it simply did NOT work tor her.

Her hair was a mess, and when she hit the "power notes" in
the song, her face looked like a gargoyle.
Getting back to the actual elimination, Anoop was sent
back to safety, leaving both I.il and Matt in the bottom two.
Lil totally deserved to go home that night — she actually
deserved to go weeks ago, but once again she was safe —
meaning that once-judge-favorite Matt was the night's elimi
nation. However, in a turn of events, the judges did some
thing for the first time in "Idol" history and used their
"fudge's safe card" to protect Matt from elimination, ensur
ing his return for next week. As "epic" as this sounds, this
was actually not that exciting.
So, all in all, this was a rather ho-hum week for
"American Idol." All of the "good" performances were really
only "good" at best and although all of the contestants really
do have a plethora of talent, no one in my mind has yet to
emerge as a frontrunner. We'll just have to wait and see what
next week brings!
