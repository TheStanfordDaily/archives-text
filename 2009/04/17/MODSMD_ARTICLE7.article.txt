Gilbert and Sullivan's "The Gondoliers" is a witty por
trait of a sparkling and vibrant Venice, complete with
gothic piazettas, dancing tlower girls, bumbling polit
ical figures and, of course, the dashing and charming men who
navigate the Grand Canal.
Although not as well-known as Gilbert and Sullivan's
other comic operas, "Pirates of Penzance" or "The HMS
Pinafore" (performed by the Stanford Savoyards earlier this
season), "The Gondoliers" never lets up in its rapid pace, bub
bling wordplay and sharp socio-political commentary.
Our two protagonists, Marco and Giuseppe (played by
Nick Bayne and Mark Thurbcr), are handsome, charming and
have landed themselves a pair of beautiful blushing brides.
Only minutes after they are married, the gondoliers are
informed by the Grand Inquisitor that one of them is the long
lost heir to the throne of the land of "Barataria." While the
identity of the true king is investigated, political chaos erupts
and lovers are torn apart. Yet, throughout it all, the singing
continues.
With a full chorus and orchestra, the Stanford Savoyards
deliver a rich sound to accompany the play. The chorus is able
to work with Gilbert and Sullivan's intricate score, and the
vocal quality of the group is highlighted by the director's stage
choreography: the routines are light and airy, and some of his
directorial choices add a playful touch to the pieces. There are

very few weak performances in the chorus, if only limited to
rigid dancing. The vocal talent, however, is strong and consis
tent throughout the cast. There are a handful of soprano
soloists who are particularly excellent. Especially notable is
Marisa Lenhardt, who plays the part of Casilda, the uninten
tional wife of the King of Barataria. Her dramatic soprano
voice carries well over the seats ol Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Although both male leads have competent voices, the tenor
Bayne possesses a healthy combination of vocal inflection and
strength. Pieces such as "Then One of Us Will Be a Queen" and
"I Am a Courtier Grave and Serious" demonstrate the leads'
abilities to blend vocally and allow the actors to truly engage
with one another.
"The Gondoliers," in true Gilbert and Sullivan form, is rife
with humorous moments, ranging from the subtle to the slap
stick. To carry off such a show requires a cast able to handle
comedy. Chemistry between some of the actors is lacking;
however, several actors do particularly well with the humorous
material — Stanford alum Joshua Solomin, who plays the
Duke of Plaza-Toro comes to mind. However, the most
delightful part of the cast is the combination of the
Gondoliers. From their extravagant first entrance off their
gondola, Marco and Giuseppe carry themselves with the per
fect air of pompousness and charisma. It is great fun to see
these two play off of one another. Overly idealistic about their

"Republican" political causes, the manner in which our pro
tagonists respond to their changing circumstances is very
amusing.
The lighting, set and costume directors arc commendable
for bringing this jovial Venetian piece to life. 'I he first set is
that of the Grand Canal, complete with an impressive moving
gondola that sails effortlessly across the stage. The costumes
for both men and women are charming and visually arresting,
lending themselves to the cheerful nature of the show. The
lighting is also well designed, whether enhancing the actors'
emotions (some characters hilariously catch a bout of seasick
ness on the canals) or creating a sumptuous ambience for the
royal court. The regal garments are rather impressive in these
scenes.
Overall, although the first act sags in momentum in some
places, by the beginning of the second act, the energy of the
actors and singers is palpable and carries on through to the
end of the show. "The Gondoliers" is definitely directed
towards a certain audience, but for fans of the works of Gilbert
and Sullivan, this is a well-produced and well-performed show
that will surely lift the spirits on these cold, windy Stanford
nights.
