# ART AFFAIR KICKS OFF!
## 
### 
If you've whizzed past White Plaza on your bikes in the last
few days, you may wondering why enormous white tents
have suddenly appeared. Last night marked the first day of
An Art Affair 2009, Stanford's largest annual art festival. The
event, hosted by SOCA (Student Organizing Committee for
the Arts), spans three days and promises to deliver exciting stu
dent performances in addition to showcasing unique artistic
talents.
Thursday night was the Artist Reception and I)J Dessert
Party, where the tents were finally opened to the Stanford pub
lic tor viewing artwork and mingling with the artists them
selves. Even from a far distance, the tents, with their transpar
ent sides, allow for a remarkable peek into a world of hard
work and inspiration. Upon entry, audiences are bombarded
with a flurry of diverse subjects and media. The event is cer
tainly eclectic: displayed are pieces from photographic por
traits, fashion boards, large acrylic paintings, even eco-friend
ly mixed media. For example, Sara Woodward '09's work

emphasizes the transformation of recycling or waste materials
into art pieces. Other exhibits that draw the eye include a
comic book by Catherine Harrell '09, and well as Mae Ryan
'09's photos from the Middle East. With the sounds of alterna
tive rock music floating in the background, groups of curious
Stanford students made their way from wall to wall, admiring
and discussing the artwork. The atmosphere at the Artist
Reception is one of warmth, enthusiasm, and celebration. The
cider fizzed, while strawberries and cheesecake were more than
enough to sustain the groups of students who came out in sup
port of their fellow artists.
All pieces displayed come from members of the Stanford
student population, and plenty of contributions are from the
members of SOCA. The first tent, alongside the general art
work, offers the student exhibits supported by the Arts Grant
Program, which provides up to $1,500 to undergraduate stu
dent artists, allowing them to create diverse art that benefits
the Stanford community. There are two grant opportunities
every year; the work displayed at An Art Affair is a result of the
winter cycle. Every one of the artists socializing at the event is
extremely proud of the opportunity to display their work. For
students such as sophomore Sasha Engelman, who believes
that "there are a lack of student arts exhibits" for the Stanford
community, this event provides a fantastic opportunity to fos
ter an awareness about the visual arts.
Although emphasis is placed on the visual arts, An Art
Affair is clearly celebrates all forms of art. A large crowd gath
ered in the second, larger white tent, where the Stanford Film
Society presented Slum ami Tell, a film festival featuring more
than a dozen student-produced films. In support of Stanford
student music, copies of the Stanford Soundtrack Vol. 8, which

features 21 campus bands, will be distributed throughout the
next tew days. The presence of representatives from
Backlight.org, an new online art forum that allows users to
share writing, art, video, and music, reflects the convergence of
several artistic disciplines over this Art Affair weekend.
Anticipation runs high in the air, as today and Saturday bring
six hours of performances on two stages, including a special
encorc of the winter one-act liloodsong on Friday. "1 can't wait
for the next few nights," gushes Emma Webster '11. Judging by
the acts lined up on the events program, neither can we.
