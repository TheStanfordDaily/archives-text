WASHING TON (AP) — Barack Obama's
mission to Latin America was about goodwill,
and he came home claiming progress, backed
by leaders from the region who took a liking
to his here-to-listen style. But the real test
awaits.
As Obama himself put it. recasting a rela
tionship takes not just words, but deeds.
So Obama embraced Cuba's overture to
put every issue on the table, but he wants the
Castro government to free political prisoners.
He had attention-snaring handshakes and
smiles with Hugo Chavez, hut he wants the
Venezuelan leader to stop being an authori
tarian figure. Obama pledged the U.S. and
Mexico are united on the drug war. but vio
lence keeps on raging.
For now. Obama has what he wanted. A
start.

"What we showed here is that we can make
progress when we're willing to break free
from some of the stale debates and old ideolo
gies that have dominated and distorted the
debate in this hemisphere for far too long." he
said Sunday at the end of the Summit of the
Americas.
The White House hopes it will all pay off -
Obama's personal diplomacy, his promises to
lead without lecturing, his willingness to hear
leftist leaders gripe about the past.
Obama even spelled out how. in his view,
that political chain of events will happen.
He said countries will be more apt to coop
erate with the United States on tough issues,
even if only on the margins. Resistance based
on anti-American conceptions of the past will
fall away. And nations already friendly to the
U.S. will be more willing to help because their
people and neighbors will "see us as a force
for good or at least not a force for ill."
Brazilian President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva

said the U.S. and Latin America are now "cre
ating a new way of looking at each other, of
defeating our differences."
Even Nicaragua President Daniel Ortega, a
critic of U.S. policy, said he found Obama
receptive to dealing with the issues raised at
the summit in Trinidad and Tobago. Ortega
said Ohama "is the president of an empire"
that has rules the president cannot change.
Nevertheless, he said. "I want to believe that
he's inclined, that he's got the will."
The dragging economy didn't consume
nearly the attention it normally would have at
a summit of the type. The U.S. relationship
with its peers framed the debate.
In a closing news conference, Obama
offered up lines hound to appeal to those fol
lowing his words across the Americas. He
spoke of standing up for freedoms hut respect
ing the cultures of other democracies, even if
the U.S. deeply opposes the policies of a coun
try.

I lis message:The United States should be a
leader in democracy, hut not a lecturer.
"And so if we are practicing what we
preach and if we occasionally confers to hav
ing strayed from our values and our ideals,
that strengthens our hand." Ohama said."That
allows us to speak with greater moral force
and clarity around these issues."
On Cuba, he said the government in
Havana should release political prisoners,
embrace democratic freedoms and cut fees on
the money that Cuban-Americans send back
to their families. Obama has lifted some
restrictions on Cuba, and Cuban President
Raul Castro responded with a broad, concilia
tory overture.
As for Venezuela, Obama's friendly encoun
ters with Chavez at the summit drew intense
publicity — partly, Obama said, because
Chavez is good at getting in front of TV cam
eras. Chavez's anti-American rhetoric has. in
the past, led Obama to call him a demagogue.
