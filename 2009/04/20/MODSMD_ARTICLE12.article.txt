## EDITORIAL Impact Abroad deserves full support 
### 
Jane Stanford once called a "University
of high degree" the means by which stu
dents will become "of greater service to
the public." In many ways, her vision has
been realized at Stanford, where no matter
the field of study a student pursues, a life of
public service is a real possibility.
But a life of service requires more than
the tools that enable us to serve the public: it
requires a deep drive on the part of those
who would serve. This passion is the means
by which students can become public ser
vants and therefore part of what any univer
sity of high degree should try to deliver.
Thankfully. Stanford has some wonderful
programs devoted to just that, and we hope
they will be around for future generations of
Stanford's up-and-coming leaders.
Stanford's Alternative Spring Break
(ASB) and its Impact Abroad programs,
sponsored by the Haas Center, are service
learning initiatives meant to transform stu
dents into advocates of social change, acting
as the first step in the long process of shaping
that passion and helping students gain
awareness of issues facing humanity. All the
better, the hands-on nature of these pro
grams provides participants with the oppor
tunity to seek potential solutions. These pro
grams are distinguished not only by combin
ing learning and service, but also by offering
financial aid to students in need, opening up
the possibility of public and international
service to all students, even those who can
not afford other programs.
The ASB program — wherein students
take a one-unit winter, quarter course and
then go on a service-learning trip over spring
break — has been around for 22 years and
has won more awards than we care to list.
More crucially, it has garnered the support of
students, on whom it depends for funding (it
was approved for special fees this year with 81
percent of the vote). With many ASB alumni
who remember the program as life-changing,
ASB's financial future is secure. However,
Impact Abroad is still emerging and is very
much at risk of cutbacks or elimination.
While Impact Abroad is still in the early
stages of development (the program was

only introduced in 2(X)8). it has the potential
to achieve tremendous things. Modeled after
ASB. Impact Abroad requires participants
to take a one-unit spring quarter course and
then participate in a 3-4 week service-learn
ing experience abroad; this summer's desti
nations are Argentina. India and Nicaragua.
The program expands the bounds of Stan
ford public service beyond U.S. borders and
beyond the short confines of a one-week
spring break. It was given funding for a
three-year pilot program, leaving it with only
two more academic years before its funding
will depend on the generosity of alumni or a
declaration of support from the University.
There can be no denying that the Univer
sity is facing tough choices in a time of eco
nomic crisis and a significantly smaller en
dowment. In such moments, the question be
comes, what should be the University's top
priorities? Be it learning about community
development in a post-Katrina New Or
leans. experiencing migrant trails along the
U.S.-Mexico border, being immersed in the
village life of rural India or volunteering in a
school system in eastern Argentina, such
service-learning initiatives are as close to the
heart of the University mission — and Jane
Stanford's founding principles — as any
other type of program.They give students an
appreciation for the urgency of problems
facing the world, a critical step in that
process of fostering lifelong passion.
When students arrive at Stanford, their
life paths are still wide open. Whatever
piques their interest during their years on
the Farm is likely to be what they pursue in
life. The power of service-learning trips is
best illustrated not by what the service stu
dents accomplish or the knowledge they ac
crue. but in the ways such experiences re
shape students' lives, giving them firsthand
insight into challenges and inspiring them to
seek solutions. If an initiative has the poten
tial to trigger a deep passion for a life of pub
lic service (and Stanford's service-learning
programs often do just that). it should be one
of Stanford's top priorities. Funding and ex
panding Impact Abroad should be an essen
tial University mission this coming year.
