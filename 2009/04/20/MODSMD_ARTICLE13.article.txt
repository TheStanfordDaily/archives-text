## Change the 15-vote rule for ASSU Senate elections 
### 
Slogan-heavy and substance-light ASSU
Undergraduate Senate campaigns have
become dominant. This is mostly be
cause it works to get people elected. Howev
er, for the reemergence of substantive cam
paigns. the electoral system should be
changed. Each voter should be allowed only
one Senate vote, rather than the 15 that we
are given now.
Perhaps the most infamous campaign slo
gan of recent years is "Holy Cow. It's Shelley
Gao" from last year. Despite relying almost
purely on this one slogan. Shelley Gao hand
ily earned the greatest amount of votes in last
year's election season. She wasted no effort
trying to explain her platform, and she was re
warded with an unambiguous victory. Just in
case people thought that last year might have
been a fluke, her campaign flyers this election
season also featured her well-known cow.
Gao again rose to success, receiving the third
highest vote totals this year.
Gao isn't the only one. In addition to Gao's
slogan-heavy campaign, many other "slogan"
candidates this year had success as well. Anton
Zietsman's flyers said little about his platf< >rni.
other than his endorsements and his slogan —
"Got it Covered from A to Z" — and he re
ceived the second-highest amount of votes.
Riding on the back of his timely "Slumdog
Sivaram" slogan. Varun Sivaram moved on to
win the fourth-highest vote total. Mohammad
Ali. this year's top vote-getter, did have plat
form details on his flyers, but he was no doubt
aided by his famous name.
My point is that slogans and catch phrases
have become the name of the game when it
comes to ASSU Undergraduate Senate cam
paigns. To be clear, this is not in any way the
fault of the candidates themselves.Those can
didates who relied on slogans and went on to
succeed are simply apt analysts of the elec
toral environment.They realized what it took
to win. Rather than blame them. I hold that
our voting system is directly responsible for
the reliance on slogans in Senate campaigns.
Imagine an average undergraduate voter.
She has 15 Senate votes to dispense with, but
when the time comes to vote, she probably
does not already have 15 people in mind. We
have a small campus, and it is quite possible
that our voter knows a few of the candidates.

Let's be conservative and say she knows and
will vote for six people running for Senate.
Now. what will she do with the remaining
nine votes? It is unlikely that she will simply
move on and abstain from using all of those
remaining votes. Instead, she will look
through the candidates again to see whom
she recognizes.Those candidates who ran slo
gan-heavy campaigns and who were widely
distributed will stick in her mind. It is quite
likely that these candidates will receive at
least some of her remaining votes.
Thus, while many students might be more
intensely passionate in support of differing
candidates, they will be more passively in
favor of the same sloganeering candidates. As
we have seen in recent years, those slogan-re
lying candidates have become some of the
highest vote-getters in a given election year.
Now. let me give my disclaimer. I am in no
way saying that Gao or Zietsman or Sivaram
or Ali only won Senate seats due to passive
votes, nor am I saying that they didn't have
enthusiastic supporters. The number of per
sonal emails that circulated the Stanford
Web-space in the days preceding the election
openly displayed the energy and enthusiasm
of their supporters. What I am saying is that
our system of 15 votes sharply incentivizes
campaigns that are slogan-heavy and that
these candidates adapted their campaigns to
fit these circumstances.
If. instead of 15 votes,each undergraduate
were only allowed one vote, we would see a
drastically different campaign. Each Senate
candidate would have to fight for each voter's
individual vote. Thus, even if a voter knew six
of the candidates, she would be forced to
choose the one she thought would best repre
sent her interests. This would force candidates
to campaign on a more substantive platform
to prove that they are most deserving of each
voter's single vote. That would make for a
more competitive, and potentially more ag
gressive campaign, sure, but ultimately it
would provide greater benefit to (he Stanford
community.
