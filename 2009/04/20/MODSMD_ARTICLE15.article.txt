## Thinking about the unthinkable 
### 
At Stanford, it's remarkably easy to for
get the way that most of America
views mental illness: as weakness, as
moral failure,and as something that's only up
to the affected individual to solve. Therapy is
stigmatized, and antidepressants and anti
anxiety drugs tend to be hidden in the back of
the medicine cabinet and never openly dis
cussed.
Why is this such a problem for people to
come to terms with, particularly given that
there is a ton of research done in the field, and
drugs to treat these disorders are targeted and
effective and overwhelmingly safe? The U.S.
tradition of treating mental health patients
isn't the most illustrious — individuals with
mental retardation were kept in cages and
shown in circuses, soldiers with anxiety and
panic disorders were branded as cowards or
worse, and schizophrenia was often misdiag
nosed as witchcraft and treated by a trip to the
stake.
So we don't have the best history with all of
this, but still, why is acknowledging mental ill
ness as being 011 par with any other type of
bodily ailment still so hard to do in America?
The root of it might just be that it's just really,
really hard for society as a whole to acknowl
edge that the human brain is every bit as much
of an organ as the liver, and just like any other
body part, a lot can go wrong with it. To be
human means to be a rational being, the one
living creature on earth with full control of its
destiny.To turn around and admit that biolog
ical defects can change how we think means
that they can change who we are. It involves
sacrificing the belief in a pure, complete free
will that was essentially the basis for the
founding of the country and the belief in self
efficacy and control that gets us through the
day.

When you have a cold, you drink orange
juice, and when you have a blocked artery.you
get coronary bypass surgery — we recognize
an illness, and then we treat it. However, the
kind of automatic reaction to treat these ill
nesses with proven medicines and techniques
isn't so automatic when it comes to mental
health. Thinking about how we view mental
health treatment seems particularly impor
tant on this day in American history; I still re
member how horrified I was 10 years ago
today when I heard what had happened in
Colorado.To think that someone, barely even
out of childhood.could commit such acts of vi
olence was scary, worldview-changing stuff to
me, as it was for so much of the country.
I~he problem, though, is that in the weeks
after the tragedy, "How could they?" was
never the right question to ask. People tried
to pin it on what they saw as logical explana
tions. but it turned out that the Columbine
killers weren't goths, or Nazis, or occultists.
They didn't listen to too much heavy metal or
decide to take innocent lives because they
watched "Natural Born Killers" and didn't
go to church. America tried to understand an
act that defied reason through what we think
of as the best ways to define the unreason
able— scapegoating and placing the blame
on the media and elsewhere — but all of
these things were incapable of explaining
mental illness as severe as that of Eric 1 larris.
It's agreed now amongst the dozens of psy
chologists and psychiatrists that poured over
the pages of his diary. Web sites and inter
viewed family and acquaintances that Harris
met the qualifications for a psychopath, and
not the way we use that term casually — the
actual disorder. It's why he reveled in the
killings, why he laughed his way through a
morning most would find the epitome of terri

tying.
Psychopaths are wired so differently from
what we'd call the "regular" human brain that
it's literally impossible for one to imagine the
thought processes of the other. Psychopaths
don't comprehend emotions like remorse or
happiness in the same way some people with
color blindness don't comprehend red or
green, so asking "How could they?" is never
going to yield a satisfactory answer — there
certainly is an answer, but a brain wired for
emotion and empathy could never under
stand it.
It wasn't the outside world that made the
boys commit their crime, but the inside one.
and an American people that fails to admit
that this sort of thing goes on is going to miss
the problem every single time. You can't tell
someone with major depression to get better
by spending more time outside or with friends,
and you can't cure a psychopath with church
camp and detention.
In "Bowling for Columbine," Marilyn
Manson famously said that if he had the
chance to talk to the two teenaged killers, he
wouldn't talk at all, but rather he would just
listen to them, because that's what no one did.
'ITiere is so much research and information as
to how to better treat mental illness in Ameri
ca, and 10 years after a tragic act, we still don't
understand. It's probably time everybody
started listening to it.

Matt Gillespie thinks the way we think is some
times worth thinking about. Contact him at
