## The 						proliferation of stop signs must be stopped! 
### 
This is the first year I have had the pleas
ure of having a car on campus. It's been
nice to be able to get off campus once
in a while and fetch toiletries without having
to wait two hours for the right Marguerite.
As someone who hails from Southern
California, I'm familiar with the "car cul
ture." Down there, highways are referred to
with the definite article attached. One says."l
am going to take the 101 to get downtown" as
if the highway is a destination itself. In truth,
it is. Southern Californians spend a lot of time
on their highways.
A lot of Northern Californians (and basi
cally everyone else in other major regions in
the United States) like to make fun of South
ern Californians for spending a lot of time in
traffic.This is not true, at least in my experi
ence. Yes, we do spend a lot of time in our
cars, but it's because there is so much space
between Point A and Point B.
Stanford is a totally different experience.
It takes a long time to get from place to place
her. too, but that is not because of the dis
tance. It is because of the stop signs.
Let's take, for example, a drive from Man
zanita, where I unfortunately reside, to Sla
vanskii Dom at the end of the Row. That is,
according to Google Earth, a distance of 0.K2
miles following Campus Drive and then up
the Row. l"here are. according to my usual
route, seven — seven! — stop signs between
here and there. That's an average of 618 feet
between each stop sign. That's ridiculous. Or,
God forbid, let's say I am trying to park in the
Tresidder lot.That is just 0.79 miles,and there
are eight — eight! — stop signs between me
and the post office. Wow.
I pity anyone trying to get from Mirrelees
to Robinson through campus — there must
be at least 15 stops signs in between. There's
simply no reason for it. I am reminded of that
opening scene in "Office Space" where one of
the characters, driving to work, is outpaced by
an old man in a walker. I am regularly beaten
to locations by people on their bikes. Pathetic.
Now. I understand the need to be safe,
blah blah blah, but it is unclear how addition

al stop signs actually make us safer. I know
many drivers — and have been in iheir cars
— where they do what is known as a "Cali
fornia roll" and only slow down, without
stopping, at a stop sign. Some particularly
brazen types don't slow down at all. This is
obviously not safe, but the vast proliferation
of stop signs only frustrates drivers and in
centivi/.es them to break the rules.
With better-constructed roads, more
"yield" signs and fewer four-way stops, driv
ing on campus would be much more efficient
and safer. Now that bikers have, at long last,
been reined in. the need for excessive stop
signs is even more questionable than it was
one or two years ago.
I secretly think — well, not so secretly
anymore — that the Powers That Be here at
our fine university are constantly trying to
make it more difficult for us to drive and use
our cars, without overtly declaring they are

doing so. The first example is, of course, the
byzantine parking system, in which it is never
clear when or where one is allowed to park.
I've racked up several parking tickets myself
through trial and error. The dearth of parking
in places where one might actually want to
park — say. Tresidder, or on the Row — is
also indicative of my suspicion.
If the administration is trying to cut down
on the number of student drivers, they might
as well come out and say it. Maybe they have
and I don't know. Hut the parking and driving
system, on East Campus at least, is hardlv
structured in a way that makes it easy or
pleasant to drive. It's not impossible,certain
ly, but I have never seen anythingquite like it.
