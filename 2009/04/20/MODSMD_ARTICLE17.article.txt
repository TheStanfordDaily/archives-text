### JEFF LU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite a tough loss to division champion
I ( -Irvine on Friday, the Stanford men's volley
ball team pulled together to end its season on a
high note by sweeping opponent UCLA. With
No. 5 I ISC upset by Hawai'i in a drawn-out
sluglest, the ( ardinal will hold home-court ad
vantage in the first round of the upcoming
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF)
Tournament.
On Friday. N0.4 Stanford (21-10.14-8 MPSF)
faced off against No. I UC-Irvine in the teams'
second encounter of the season. Despite edging
a lead in the middle of the first set. the Cardinal
eventually crumbled under the weight of the
Anteaters' offense, 30-28, 30-24, 30-22. Junior
outside hitter Evan Romero knocked in 13 kills
and lieshman outside hitter Brad Lawson
chipped in another 11, but the Stanford offense
was unable to offer an adequate response to
Irvine's nine team blocks.
Defensively, the Cardinal players took a se
vere beating from the Anteaters' outside hitters,
who combined for a total of 27 kills in just three
sets. Freshman libero Erik Shoji managed 14
digs, hut minimal blocking allowed the Irvine
players to maintain an incredible .457 team hit
ting percentage, the highest anv team has hit
against Stanford all season.
" ITiey're a good, solid team, and they have
very lew weaknesses." said Stanford head coach
John Kostv. It's tough to score in streaks against
them unless you come with your 'A' game. And
that's something we need to get better at."
Elsewhere, No. 5 USC snapped a three-game
losing streak and bridged the gap in the MPSF
rankings to tie the Cardinal at fourth place by
sweeping No. 14 Hawai'i. The two teams have
been in constant battle since earlier this month
lor the No. 4 position, which guarantees home
court advantage for the first round of the MPSF
Tournament.
Saturday saw Stanford against No. 9 UCLA,
which had previously defeated the Cardinal in a
five-game nail biter. With the help of 43 assists
from junior setter Kawika Shoji. the Cardinal

GAME NOTES: Stanford (21 -10, 14-8 MPSF) clinched home
court advantage for the opening round of its conference
tournament last weekend with a win over UCLA. The post
season starts for the Cardinal with a meeting with No. 5

from the MPSF Tournament.

cruised past its opponent in an uneventful 30-23.
30-26. 30-28 victory. Romero, who led the team
with 16 kills, was one of three Stanford players to
reach double digits in kills — Lawson and soph
omore outside hitter Spencer McLachlin put up
II and 14, respectively. Senior middle blocker
Brandon Williams put up four individual blocks,
and the team as a whole hit .366.
Saturday night's win gave Stanford its 21st
victory of the season, the most since the 1997
championship team won 27.
For the Cardinal players, the excitement of
the night lasted long after the UCLA players left
the gymnasium. Because USC held a tiebreaker
over Stanford, a victory over UCLA meant little
if the Trojans won their match against Hawai'i.
When the news came that Hawai'i had lost the
first set, the team resigned to losing its first
round home advantage.
"1 We were] just planning on going to USC this
week," Kostv said.
After waiting with bated breath, however, the
Stanford players weren't disappointed by the
final result. Hawai'i junior outside hitter Joseph
Strotman and sophomore outside hitter Joshua
Walker knocked in 30 and 29 kills apiece to shift
the momentum and help the Warriors take the

With the home-court advantage

disappointing first-round exit last
year.
