## Arizonas give Card bookend losses 
### CHRIS FITZGERALD DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
No. 2 Stanford Softball was disheartened in the
desert last weekend by losing two of three games
to the Arizona schools. Stanford was outscored 29-
11 on the trip, and fell by the run rule twice, while
Cardinal pitchers coughed up three homers in
each of the two losses. The meetings pushed the
Cardinal to 1-5 in recent conference games.
Friday night marked the first run-rule loss Stan
ford (37-6,7-5 Pacific-10 Conference) has taken all
season. No.9Ari/ona (35-9,7-2 Pac-10) produced
13 hits on the evening, including three home runs,
the most in a single game off Cardinal pitching this
season.
On the loss, Stanford head coach John Rittman
looked at the bigger picture.
"Winning in the Pac-10 on the road is extreme

ly difficult." he said."We just played twoofthe best
offensive teams in the country."
Arizona sophomore Brittany Lastrapes had
three of the Wildcats' 13 total hits, including a
three-run homer in the sixth to make it a 10-4
game.Two more runs in the inning were enough to
finish the game prematurely, 12-4. Wildcat junior
K Lee Arredondo was 3-4 at the plate, adding a
two-run blast beyond the fence at Hillenbrand
Stadium. In fact, eight of the 12 Wildcat runs were
driven across by home runs.
As for the Arizona pitching staff, junior Sarah
Akamine improved to 15-4 in the circle this sea
son. The California native struck out two and sur
rendered eight hits, allowing just two earned runs
in six complete innings of work. Meanwhile, Stan
ford senior Missy Penna took the loss.The decision
marked a stretch in which Penna has lost two of
her last three, only having pitched one inning

against Cal on April 11 to pick up ano decision.
I lowever. Stanford found some positive enercy
in the form of junior Alissa I labcr. I laber went "X
-4 and scored a run. while senior Maddie Coon con
tributed two RBI on a deep single with two on
base. Junior Rosey Neill capped an offensive effort
in the sixth with her ninth home run of the vear.
