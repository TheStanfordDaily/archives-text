# Do's and don't of the NFL draft
## 
### 
With just a few short days
between now and the
2009 NFL Draft, it's
time, finally, to talk
about the stars of tomorrow rather
than the stars of yesterday. While far
too much of the NFL's regular-sea
son storylines consist of questions
lieke "Where has he gone?" and
"Will he or won't he retire?" there's
no better gauge for where teams are
here and now — or. for that matter,
where they think they're going —
than the draft.
In years past, I've devoted plenty
of copy to explaining why the draft is
important and worth watching.
While those arguments always
seemed pretty clear to me. year in
and year out. there was always some
columnist or pundit declaring that it
was nothing more than a "crap
shoot," boring and unwatchable. For
whatever reason, though. I've been
hearing much less of that this year as
even the mainstream media seems to
have finally conceded the point that
fans have known all along — the
draft is not only worth watching, it's
the single most important event on
the NFL calendar each year. Any
given game, even the Super Bowl,
merely determines who's on top for
the here and now. The results of the
draft? Well, those ramifications can
last a decade or more.
So, with that said. I thought it
would be appropriate this year to
launch into some general draft do's
and don'ts. Take them for what
they're worth, but 1 guarantee you.
it's the best any under-qualified,
over-exuberant fan would have to
offer.
Rule No. 1: Avoid quarterbacks un
less you're really read\ for them. It's
easy to follow the prevailing wisdom
and believe that any team that does
n't currently have a" franchise signal
caller on its roster needs to do any
thing and everything to secure one
on draft day. And to an extent, that's
true. When a John Elway, can't-miss
type of OB comes along, you take
him.
But in most cases, there's no such
thing as a slam-dunk, sure-fire
prospect, and that goes double for
OBs. And when you're not staring
straight at the next Elway, Favre,
Montana or Manning, you don't pull
the trigger and take him unless
you've got the support structure
there to help his growth.
Case in point: Alex Smith v. Aaron


Denis
Griffin
Rants and Raves
Rodgers. You'll never convince me
that Rodgers was the better prospect
coming out of college, but lour years
after the Cal OH was selected, lie's
the one poised to be a franchise sig
nal-caller for years to come, while
Smith is rapidly becoming an after
thought in San 1 rancisco.The differ
ence? Smith was thrust into a situa
tion with no stable offensive system,
no veteran leadership around him
and no proven offensive playmakers
to lean on while he developed.
Rodgers got to sit on the bench and
learn behind Brett Favre for most of
three years before lie was called
upon to start.
So to Detroit and other, well, de
veloping teams, unless you see more
in the likes of Matt Stafford and
Mark Sanchez than I do, you might
be better off waiting 011 that OB of
the future so that whenever you gel
him. you're ready for him.
Rule No. 2: Reach for (lie stars, hut
don't get humeri. When ii comes to
the draft, one term that often gets
thrown around with reckless aban
don is"boom-or bust." Used to refer

to ii prospect or pick, it usually de
scribes a player with tremendous
physical capabilities, but some ques
tion marks as to whether he'll be
able to perform at the next level.
ITie best recent example would
be a player like Adam "Pacman"
Jones, who everyone knew was a
tremendous physical talent at cor
nerbaek when he was selected by
lennessee. but was also surrounded
by the same character concerns that
dog him to this day.The law and Pac
man's inability to stay within it has.
essentially, prevented him from
being the player he could have been,
and landed him decisively on the
"bust" side of the equation.
Going forward, then, the name of
the game for teams is that taking a
chance on a player with tremendous
upside is one thing if you're not sure
how that 4.4 speed will translate
from a small college to the NFL. It's
something entirely different il. like
Pacman. you think he might spend
more time in local strip clubs and
courtrooms. A player with solid
character and tremendous upside
who doesn't become a star will still
likely provide solid depth. But, a
player with the pedigree and talent,
but not the common sense to stay out
of trouble could, ultimately, be a
complete waste of a selection.

Rule No. 3: Make ail effort in the
trenches. Another common cliche of
the draft is the need to build a solid
team by building in the trenches.The
notion that solid offensive and de
fensive linemen are worth their
(often prodigious) weight in gold is
an old one. and largely true.
But when it comes to drafting
linemen, the moniker that all teams
should fear is a simple one:"inconsis
tent motor." A player built like a
bulldozer is just a massive waste of
space if he doesn't play with any pas
sion or intensity. And if that gargan
tuan guard is giving questionable ef
fort in college, when a big payday is
on the line in the draft, what do you
think he'll be like when he gets to the
pros and he's already been handed
liis signing bonus? The answer: noth
ing good. Not for your team, anyway.
So if your team breaks one of the
above cardinal rules during the
draft,you'll be able to say "I told you
so" when things turn sour. Unfortu
nately, that won't stop your franchise
from making dumb moves, but at
least you'll know the train wreck
when you see it. And I promise, you
won't be able to turn away.
