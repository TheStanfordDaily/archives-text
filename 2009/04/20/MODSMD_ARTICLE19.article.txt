# Do's and don't of the NFL draft
## 
### 
With just a few short days
between now and the
2009 NFL Draft, it's
time, finally, to talk
about the stars of tomorrow rather
than the stars of yesterday. While far
too much of the NFL's regular-sea
son storylines consist of questions
lieke "Where has he gone?" and
"Will he or won't he retire?" there's
no better gauge for where teams are
here and now — or. for that matter,
where they think they're going —
than the draft.
In years past, I've devoted plenty
of copy to explaining why the draft is
important and worth watching.
While those arguments always
seemed pretty clear to me. year in
and year out. there was always some
columnist or pundit declaring that it
was nothing more than a "crap
shoot," boring and unwatchable. For
whatever reason, though. I've been
hearing much less of that this year as
even the mainstream media seems to
have finally conceded the point that
fans have known all along — the
draft is not only worth watching, it's
the single most important event on
the NFL calendar each year. Any
given game, even the Super Bowl,
merely determines who's on top for
the here and now. The results of the
draft? Well, those ramifications can
last a decade or more.
So, with that said. I thought it
would be appropriate this year to
launch into some general draft do's
and don'ts. Take them for what
they're worth, but 1 guarantee you.
it's the best any under-qualified,
over-exuberant fan would have to
offer.
Rule No. 1: Avoid quarterbacks un
less you're really read\ for them. It's
easy to follow the prevailing wisdom
and believe that any team that does
n't currently have a" franchise signal
caller on its roster needs to do any
thing and everything to secure one
on draft day. And to an extent, that's
true. When a John Elway, can't-miss
type of OB comes along, you take
him.
But in most cases, there's no such
thing as a slam-dunk, sure-fire
prospect, and that goes double for
OBs. And when you're not staring
straight at the next Elway, Favre,
Montana or Manning, you don't pull
the trigger and take him unless
you've got the support structure
there to help his growth.
Case in point: Alex Smith v. Aaron
