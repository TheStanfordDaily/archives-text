## Caterpillar plague may return Grounds Services warns of outbreak, but is prepared 
### MARISA LANDICHO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Crawling through lecture
halls, swinging into bikers'
mouths and emerging from
backpacks, caterpillars tra-

ditionally overrun the
campus every year dur
ing spring quarter. Though
the furrv menaces were
not a problem last year,
thanks to a focused pest
management campaign. {
the caterpillars may /
make a return soon. V
Grounds Services
warned.

"We haven't seen almost
any outbreaks yet. which may
be an indication that it may be
good this year." said Max
Pinedo, supervisor for
Horticulture. Pest Management
and Tree Maintenance. He cau
tioned. however, that an out
break could happen suddenly
and Grounds Services must
continually monitor the t

trees.
Colored red and yellow,
with four distinctive white
tufts of hair, the Western

tussock C 'aterpillar is the
most common caterpil
i . <
lar species on campus.
The caterpillars usually
hatch in late February
and then feed on oak
leaves until mid-June,

when they eventually spin
cocoons and morph into
Tussock moths.
The problem comes when
there is an explosion in the
caterpillar population, which
last happened in the spring of
2006 and 2007.
In the last eight years.
Grounds Services has made
attempts to prevent the infes-

tations because trees may
suffer permanent damage
from too many caterpil
lars feeding on their
leaves. I lie main motive
for their efforts, however,
is student complaints.
"Of course they can
damage the trees il it's a big
infestation, like any
insect." Pinedo said. <
"Hut | they're J more like
a nuisance for people,
especially when they start
dropping."

As trees become too full, the
caterpillars drop on silk strings
and hang underneath the trees
often swinging in the path of
unwary bicyclists.
Many upperclassmen remem
ber these times in horror.
"I was hiking once, and one
fell in my lap |and another] one
went in my mouth." said Betty
Pham '09, who created a

Face book group, "Stanford
Union of Caterpillar Killahs"

(SUCK), in her freshman
year. "These stories aren't all
that uncommon."
Learning from the
swarms in past years,
(irounds Services has
refined its caterpillar
containment strategy to

focus on prevention. This
year, Pinedo said, they
will rely mainly on spray
