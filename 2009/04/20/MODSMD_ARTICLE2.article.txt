## Caterpillar plague may return Grounds Services warns of outbreak, but is prepared 
### MARISA LANDICHO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Crawling through lecture
halls, swinging into bikers'
mouths and emerging from
backpacks, caterpillars tra-

ditionally overrun the
campus every year dur
ing spring quarter. Though
the furrv menaces were
not a problem last year,
thanks to a focused pest
management campaign. {
the caterpillars may /
make a return soon. V
Grounds Services
warned.

"We haven't seen almost
any outbreaks yet. which may
be an indication that it may be
good this year." said Max
Pinedo, supervisor for
Horticulture. Pest Management
and Tree Maintenance. He cau
tioned. however, that an out
break could happen suddenly
and Grounds Services must
continually monitor the t

trees.
Colored red and yellow,
with four distinctive white
tufts of hair, the Western

tussock C 'aterpillar is the
most common caterpil
i . <
lar species on campus.
The caterpillars usually
hatch in late February
and then feed on oak
leaves until mid-June,

when they eventually spin
cocoons and morph into
Tussock moths.
The problem comes when
there is an explosion in the
caterpillar population, which
last happened in the spring of
2006 and 2007.
In the last eight years.
Grounds Services has made
attempts to prevent the infes-

tations because trees may
suffer permanent damage
from too many caterpil
lars feeding on their
leaves. I lie main motive
for their efforts, however,
is student complaints.
"Of course they can
damage the trees il it's a big
infestation, like any
insect." Pinedo said. <
"Hut | they're J more like
a nuisance for people,
especially when they start
dropping."

As trees become too full, the
caterpillars drop on silk strings
and hang underneath the trees
often swinging in the path of
unwary bicyclists.
Many upperclassmen remem
ber these times in horror.
"I was hiking once, and one
fell in my lap |and another] one
went in my mouth." said Betty
Pham '09, who created a

Face book group, "Stanford
Union of Caterpillar Killahs"

(SUCK), in her freshman
year. "These stories aren't all
that uncommon."
Learning from the
swarms in past years,
(irounds Services has
refined its caterpillar
containment strategy to

focus on prevention. This
year, Pinedo said, they
will rely mainly on spray
ing the egg nests with high

pressure water.
"We go and basically release the
cocoons that are attached to the
branches and trunks with power
washing," he said.
Under the Integrated Pest
Management (IPM) program,
launched in 1997, the University has
pursued a course stressing the least
impact on the environment.The IPM
program includes a move away from
chemical pesticides and towards
more inv entiv e means of suppressing
pests.
These efforts have included the
release of the caterpillar's natural
predators, such as lacewing larvae
and wasps in 1998-2(KK) and spined
soldier bugs in 2007. but neither
predator had any substantial success.
"We did the release, and we never
saw [the spined soldier bugs] again."
said Horticulture Technician Julie
Day."It was not very successful
because the caterpillars are so fuzzy
that the spiny beetles were not able
to penetrate."
Though power washing is less
harmful than chemical treatments,
some students have still complained
about the water wasted in the
process.
"I don't think there is any need to
spray." said Donald Hoang '09. "I
think it's a waste of money." Hoang
started the Facebook group "Save
the Caterpillars" in the middle of the
2006 infestation.
"I mean, it's not a big deal —
there are bugs everywhere," he
added.
Lan Mark ham '12 agreed that

power washing was preferable to
pesticides, hut only if the caterpillars
were actually a proven harm.
"Killing them for personal com
fort. for having to brush off a harm
less thing which doesn't sting, nor
itches or bites, is just foolishness and
species-ism." he said. Markhani also
cautioned against the potential dis
ruption of other wildlife living in the
trees, such as the many bird nests on
campus that may be damaged by
power washing.
Pinedo did mention that the hairi
ness of this certain species of cater
pillar was often an irritant to the skin
and triggered the allergies of some
on campus. For the most part, how
ever. students complained about the
caterpillars as a nuisance, he said.
Pham was against the insects
"particularly because they don't turn
into anything pretty — they turn into
moths."
"I'm sure there are some ecologi
cal reasons for their existence, but
aesthetically not so much." she
added.
Due to the lull in 2(X)8 and the
caterpillars' absence so far this year.
Grounds Services is optimistic that
2009 will be caterpillar-free.
But students are not as certain of
the reprieve.
Toyon resident assistant (RA)
Edgar Flores '10 was moved to send
out a warning email to the RA lists
last month, complete with photos,
places to avoid and an ominous sub
ject line. "They are coming."
Pham is already convinced that
the caterpillars will be back.
"I freaked out pretty recently
when I saw three caterpillars on my
bike within two davs." she said.
