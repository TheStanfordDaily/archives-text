## Stanford drops three as Sun Devils out-shine card in Arizona 
### ERIK ADAMS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford baseball headed south to Tempe,
Ariz, on a roll last weekend, having won nine of
its previous 11 contests, but was stopped in its
tracks by No. 2 Arizona State.
Except for the first seven innings on Satur
day, Stanford (15-16, 7-K Pacific-10 Confer
ence) was never really in control. The lone
bright spot of the weekend was freshman
starter Jordan Pries, who limited the top of
fense in the conference to no runs and just two
hits in seven beautiful innings in Saturday's 7-2
loss. The right-hander walked five but struck
out a career-high 10 batters.
"He did a phenomenal job.a great job "said
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess. "He
came up with big pitches, and in a couple big
spots, with guvs in scoring position, he stepped
up and got them out. You can't ask for much
more than that."
Pries is 3-0 this year with a 3.43 ERA, and
opposing batters are hitting just . 1K ( ) against
him.
Hie rough weekend certainly doesn't spell
doom for Stanford's postseason hopes, but the
Cardinal will need to find a way to put some
distance between itself and the cluttered mid
dle of the Pac-10 before season's end.There are
still 24 games to be played — 12 in the confer
ence — before the playoffs arrive, and ;i strong
finish could launch Stanford toward another
run at Omaha.

GAME NOTES ' Stanford looks to rebound after dropping
three straight to the Sun Devils over the weekend. Recent
history bodes well for the Cardinal (15-16, 7-8 Pac -10),
though, as Stanford easily downed the Broncos on April
15, 16-3.

FRIDAY: ASU 14, STANFORD 6
TTie Sun Devils (2X-N, 13-2) didn't waste ;mv
time getting on the board,jumping all over the
Cardinal's starter, junior Jeffrey fnman. After
allowing a pair of runs in the first inning, the
right-hander managed only a single out in the
second before being knocked out of the game.
Arizona State centerfielder Jason Kipnis
who entered the game batting over .400 with 10
homers and 14 doubles — drove in three runs
with a bases-loaded double oil the wall in right,
and sophomore Danny Sandbrink relieved
Innian after the next batter singled.
