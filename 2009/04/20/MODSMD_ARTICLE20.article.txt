## Stanford drops three as Sun Devils out-shine card in Arizona 
### ERIK ADAMS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Stanford baseball headed south to Tempe,
Ariz, on a roll last weekend, having won nine of
its previous 11 contests, but was stopped in its
tracks by No. 2 Arizona State.
Except for the first seven innings on Satur
day, Stanford (15-16, 7-K Pacific-10 Confer
ence) was never really in control. The lone
bright spot of the weekend was freshman
starter Jordan Pries, who limited the top of
fense in the conference to no runs and just two
hits in seven beautiful innings in Saturday's 7-2
loss. The right-hander walked five but struck
out a career-high 10 batters.
"He did a phenomenal job.a great job "said
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess. "He
came up with big pitches, and in a couple big
spots, with guvs in scoring position, he stepped
up and got them out. You can't ask for much
more than that."
Pries is 3-0 this year with a 3.43 ERA, and
opposing batters are hitting just . 1K ( ) against
him.
Hie rough weekend certainly doesn't spell
doom for Stanford's postseason hopes, but the
Cardinal will need to find a way to put some
distance between itself and the cluttered mid
dle of the Pac-10 before season's end.There are
still 24 games to be played — 12 in the confer
ence — before the playoffs arrive, and ;i strong
finish could launch Stanford toward another
run at Omaha.

GAME NOTES ' Stanford looks to rebound after dropping
three straight to the Sun Devils over the weekend. Recent
history bodes well for the Cardinal (15-16, 7-8 Pac -10),
though, as Stanford easily downed the Broncos on April
15, 16-3.

FRIDAY: ASU 14, STANFORD 6
TTie Sun Devils (2X-N, 13-2) didn't waste ;mv
time getting on the board,jumping all over the
Cardinal's starter, junior Jeffrey fnman. After
allowing a pair of runs in the first inning, the
right-hander managed only a single out in the
second before being knocked out of the game.
Arizona State centerfielder Jason Kipnis
who entered the game batting over .400 with 10
homers and 14 doubles — drove in three runs
with a bases-loaded double oil the wall in right,
and sophomore Danny Sandbrink relieved
Innian after the next batter singled.

this season,still managed to limit the
Card to six runs on eight hits through
seven innings, keeping a perfect <X-()
record. I le also crushed any hope of
a Stanford rally by stranding six run
tiers and allowing only one run in his
final four innings of work.
But there were a few positives for
Stanford, including Clowe's 3-for-4
day with three RBI. both matching
career highs.
"Ben has been swinging the bat
very well lately." Marquess said."l le
has been helping us. and his bat is
going to help us this year."
Sophomore Colin Walsh ran his
hitting streak to seven games, and
sophomores Alex Pracher and
Michael Marshall, along with fresh
man Brian Busick, managed to hold
the powerful ASl' lineup to just one
run on three hits over the final 4.1 in
nings.
SATURDAY: ASU 7, STANFORD 2
Hie night after being knocked
around by ASU's bats. Stanford
turned to Pries to be the stopper. I le
turned in the best performance of his
young career shutting out the Sun
Devils and holding them to just two
hits, while striking out a career-high
10 batters in seven innings — but it
wasn't enough for the ('ardinal.
Walsh scored from third on a
fielder's choice in the fourth inning
to give Stanford a I II lead, and Pi ies
made it stick until he left the game

after seven with the score still 1-0.
I"he Cardinal added an insurance
run on an RBI-double by senior Joey
August in the eighth, before turning
to sophomore closer Drew Storen in
the bottom of the eighth.
Storen had been nearly un-hit
table all year, and hadn't walked a
man since the first batter he faced
this season. Hut that streak of domi
nance came to an end in this outing,
as ASI i pushed across seven runs on
the right hander, who only managed
one out.
The line looked worse than his
performance actually was. as things
snowballed after a series of tough
breaks and close calls. Shortstop
I )rew Maggi led off the inning with a
triple to right on a ball that sopho
more Kellen Kiilsgaard appeared to
have a chance on. but he and August
collided and the ball rolled to the
wall.
After a lengthy delay to check on
August, who injured his left shin on
the play but stayed in the game.
Storen got ahead 0-2 on Kipnis. be
fore a pitch barely off the inside cor
ner nicked the batter.The ball didn't
move at all and Kipnis leaned his
elbow towards the plate — and
Storen argued the call momentarily
before returning to the mound visi
bly frustrated.
Storen walked the next man he
faced before allowing a single and a
double to the next two. I le then got a
strikeout, but issued two more walks
one intentional — and a wild
pitch before being relived by Mar
shall with the score 4-2 and the bases
loaded. Marshall allowed a three-
RBI single to Maggi before escaping
the inning.
Stanford had been 10-0 before
the loss when leading after seven in
nings this season.
SUNDAY: ASU 6, STANFORD 3
I lie Sun Devils pushed across
five iuns in the fourth inning, and
that was more than enough for
starter Setli Blair. Blair held Stan
ford to two runs on six hits through
6.2 solid innings and picked up his
fourth win of the year.

Freshman Brett Mooneyham
started for Stanford, but was never
able to find his command. In just 3.1
innings of work, he issued eight
walks and routinely fell behind ASI I
hitters. Senior Max I earnowand Bu
sick combined to allow just two runs
the resi of the way. but the damage
was already done.
Stanford did hit its first home
runs of the weekend a pair of solo
shots by junior Adam (iaylord and
Kiilsgaard. Hie homer by Gaylord
was the first of his collegiate career
and came on a rocketing line drive to
left field.
I he ( ardinal w ill look to get back

Stanford baseball headed south to Tempe,
Ariz, on a roll last weekend, having won nine of
its previous 11 contests, but was stopped in its
tracks by No. 2 Arizona State.
Except for the first seven innings on Satur
day, Stanford (15-16, 7-K Pacific-10 Confer
ence) was never really in control. The lone
bright spot of the weekend was freshman
starter Jordan Pries, who limited the top of
fense in the conference to no runs and just two
hits in seven beautiful innings in Saturday's 7-2
loss. The right-hander walked five but struck
out a career-high 10 batters.
"He did a phenomenal job.a great job "said
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess. "He
came up with big pitches, and in a couple big
spots, with guvs in scoring position, he stepped
up and got them out. You can't ask for much
more than that."
Pries is 3-0 this year with a 3.43 ERA, and
opposing batters are hitting just . 1K ( ) against
him.
Hie rough weekend certainly doesn't spell
doom for Stanford's postseason hopes, but the
Cardinal will need to find a way to put some
distance between itself and the cluttered mid
dle of the Pac-10 before season's end.There are
still 24 games to be played — 12 in the confer
ence — before the playoffs arrive, and ;i strong
finish could launch Stanford toward another
run at Omaha.

GAME NOTES ' Stanford looks to rebound after dropping
three straight to the Sun Devils over the weekend. Recent
history bodes well for the Cardinal (15-16, 7-8 Pac -10),
though, as Stanford easily downed the Broncos on April
15, 16-3.

FRIDAY: ASU 14, STANFORD 6
TTie Sun Devils (2X-N, 13-2) didn't waste ;mv
time getting on the board,jumping all over the
Cardinal's starter, junior Jeffrey fnman. After
allowing a pair of runs in the first inning, the
right-hander managed only a single out in the
second before being knocked out of the game.
Arizona State centerfielder Jason Kipnis
who entered the game batting over .400 with 10
homers and 14 doubles — drove in three runs
with a bases-loaded double oil the wall in right,
and sophomore Danny Sandbrink relieved
Innian after the next batter singled.

Freshman Brett Mooneyham and most of Stanford s pitching staff struggled to contain Arizona State batters. Some redempt.on was found
in freshman skirter Jordan ' ries, but the ( ordinal still gave up 2/ runs in just three games against the Sun Devils
Sandhrink allowed a two-RBI
double to right-fielder Matt New
man. running the score to a 7-3 ASI I
advantage.and gi\ing the Sun Devils
all the runs they would need. Sand
brink struck out the next two batters
to escape the inning.
Although Stanford held the lead
briefly at 3-2 after scoring three runs
in the top of the second, it never felt
like the Cardinal was really in the
game. Sun Devil starter Josh Spcncc.
delivering his worst performance of
this season,still managed to limit the
Card to six runs on eight hits through
seven innings, keeping a perfect <X-()
record. I le also crushed any hope of
a Stanford rally by stranding six run
tiers and allowing only one run in his
final four innings of work.
But there were a few positives for
Stanford, including Clowe's 3-for-4
day with three RBI. both matching
career highs.
"Ben has been swinging the bat
very well lately." Marquess said."l le
has been helping us. and his bat is
going to help us this year."
Sophomore Colin Walsh ran his
hitting streak to seven games, and
sophomores Alex Pracher and
Michael Marshall, along with fresh
man Brian Busick, managed to hold
the powerful ASl' lineup to just one
run on three hits over the final 4.1 in
nings.
SATURDAY: ASU 7, STANFORD 2
Hie night after being knocked
around by ASU's bats. Stanford
turned to Pries to be the stopper. I le
turned in the best performance of his
young career shutting out the Sun
Devils and holding them to just two
hits, while striking out a career-high
10 batters in seven innings — but it
wasn't enough for the ('ardinal.
Walsh scored from third on a
fielder's choice in the fourth inning
to give Stanford a I II lead, and Pi ies
made it stick until he left the game

after seven with the score still 1-0.
I"he Cardinal added an insurance
run on an RBI-double by senior Joey
August in the eighth, before turning
to sophomore closer Drew Storen in
the bottom of the eighth.
Storen had been nearly un-hit
table all year, and hadn't walked a
man since the first batter he faced
this season. Hut that streak of domi
nance came to an end in this outing,
as ASI i pushed across seven runs on
the right hander, who only managed
one out.
The line looked worse than his
performance actually was. as things
snowballed after a series of tough
breaks and close calls. Shortstop
I )rew Maggi led off the inning with a
triple to right on a ball that sopho
more Kellen Kiilsgaard appeared to
have a chance on. but he and August
collided and the ball rolled to the
wall.
After a lengthy delay to check on
August, who injured his left shin on
the play but stayed in the game.
Storen got ahead 0-2 on Kipnis. be
fore a pitch barely off the inside cor
ner nicked the batter.The ball didn't
move at all and Kipnis leaned his
elbow towards the plate — and
Storen argued the call momentarily
before returning to the mound visi
bly frustrated.
Storen walked the next man he
faced before allowing a single and a
double to the next two. I le then got a
strikeout, but issued two more walks
one intentional — and a wild
pitch before being relived by Mar
shall with the score 4-2 and the bases
loaded. Marshall allowed a three-
RBI single to Maggi before escaping
the inning.
Stanford had been 10-0 before
the loss when leading after seven in
nings this season.
SUNDAY: ASU 6, STANFORD 3
I lie Sun Devils pushed across
five iuns in the fourth inning, and
that was more than enough for
starter Setli Blair. Blair held Stan
ford to two runs on six hits through
6.2 solid innings and picked up his
fourth win of the year.

Freshman Brett Mooneyham
started for Stanford, but was never
able to find his command. In just 3.1
innings of work, he issued eight
walks and routinely fell behind ASI I
hitters. Senior Max I earnowand Bu
sick combined to allow just two runs
the resi of the way. but the damage
was already done.
Stanford did hit its first home
runs of the weekend a pair of solo
shots by junior Adam (iaylord and
Kiilsgaard. Hie homer by Gaylord
was the first of his collegiate career
and came on a rocketing line drive to
left field.
I he ( ardinal w ill look to get back
