## Women fall short of Super Six 
### KENAN JIANG STAFF WRITER 
I lie Stanford women's gymnastics team finished 0.075
points sh\ of making a third consecutive appearance in the
NCAA Super Six Finals this past weekend.The team's ulti
mate goal for the season was to make the Super Six rank
ing. which would give it the opportunity to compete for the
national title tin the last day of the NCAA Championships.
But, the ( ardinal came up short in the battle for the final
spot, as it was edged out by L.SU in the final rotation.
Of six teams in its draw. Stanford finished fourth in pre
lims. and onl\ the top three teams enter the Super Six. Stan
ford competed on Thursday at the Devaney ("enter in I .in
coln.Neb.and after 24 routines and 3.5 hours.it finished be
hind I.SI . runner-up Florida and defending champion
Georgia, which featured 2(H)4 Olympic silver medalist
Courtney Kupets.
Georgia won the Session I draw with 197.45 points, fol
lowed by Florida with 196.375, LSU with 196.3, Stanford
with 196.225, Penn State with 196.1 and Oklahoma with
195.825.
Stanford finished its season eighth in the nation, mark
ing the team's third consecutive top-10 finish during an as
tronomical rise for the women's gymnastics team since
head coach Kristen Smyth took over the program's helm.
Going into the final rotation, the Cardinal had put itself in
a great position to make the Super Six. 1 lowever.senior cap
tain Kelly Fee injured her ankle in the final parts of her rou
tine and was not able to continue. Still, the live remaining
Stanford gymnasts nailed their routines for a combined score
of 48.95. Sophomore Shelley Alexander placed 10th with a
9.S7s.coming up just short of her first All-American honors.
LSU rallied, though, and stuck all of its vault routines for
a team total of 49.95, which edged Stanford's best efforts.

Stanford performed extremely well on the uneven bars
with a team score of 49.175, losing only to Georgia's 49.375.
Stanford junior Carly Janiga posted a 9.9, while senior
Nicole Ourada. freshman Nicole Pechanec, senior Kelly
Fee. Alexander and junior Allyse Ishino also bolstered the
team with a 9.875,9.825,9.8.9.775 and 9.75. respectively.
Overall, the Cardinal showed solid scores across the
board, but the culmination of little errors was enough to
keep the young team out of a Super Six position. In the end,
the Super SixjJid not include a single Pacific-10 Conference
team, as perennial contender UCLA was edged out by
Utah in a tiebreaker, and Oregon State finished fifth.
At the end of the competition. Georgia won the nation
al championship, beating out Florida. LSU, Alabama,
Arkansas and Utah.
After the Cardinal's team season ended. Ourada and
Janiga competed in the individual event finals on Saturday.
In prelims, both earned first-team Ail-American honors in
the uneven bars. To qualify, they finished among the top
four in the session. Janiga also earned second-team All-
American in the all-around, while Ourada did so on the
floor, snagging her seventh career All-American honor.
On Saturday, Janiga went on to finish second in the indi
vidual uneven bars, with a score of 9.9125, marking the best
finish in any event for Stanford since 2001. Janiga lost to
champion Courtney Kupets who was also the NCAA all
around champion with a score of 9.95. Ourada also placed
10th in the uneven bars to cap off a stellar career.
Although the Cardinal will surely miss Ourada when it
returns to action next year. Janiga and her teammates keep
theireyes set on the Super Six for the 2010 season, and with
less than a tenth of a point separating them from that goal,
the achievement may be within reach.
