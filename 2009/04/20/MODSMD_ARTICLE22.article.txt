## Stanford cyclists host home race 
### ZOE LEAVITT STAFF WRITER 
'The Stanford cycling club team successfully hosted its
first on-campus race in years on Sunday, much to the de
light of the team, its alumni and the cheering fans who
watched blurs of bikers speeding down Campus Drive.
Over 200 racers flooded Galvez Field to sweat through a
combined hundreds of laps over the course of the morn
ing.
F.very team in the Western Collegiate Cycling Confer
ence hosts a race each season,but the Stanford team pre
viously held its races on various off-campus sites, such as
in Redwood City in 200K and Santa Clara in 2007. Due to
funding problems and bureaucratic tangles, putting Stan
ford's race on campus has been a holy grail that eluded
Stanford cycling for many years. Frustrated by the lack of
exposure from off-campus races, the team pooled its tal
ents this year to successfully organize a campus race, giv
ing this weekend more than the usual race excitement.
Looping around Galvez Field over Campus Drive,
Cialve/ Street. Arboretum and Fasuen Street, the .925-
mile course brought significant challenges despite its flat
ness. The sharp corners necessitated heightened concen
tration and focus on handling skills in order for the riders
to stay on track. Although the course was short, the 60-
minute race called for intense endurance and high
speeds.
"I got several compliments from other teams on the
quality of the course," said road captain Rae Browns
berger '10. "The pavement is good and a few turns are
pretty technical, which makes the race a lot of fun. We
thought turn three, less than 90 degrees and slightly off
camber. had the potential to cause some trouble. There
were a couple crashes, but that's bike racing. Overall, the
course was safe and fast."
The Stanford cyclists used their bureaucratic triumphs
to add momentum on the course this weekend, finishing
the day with several standout performances. Browns
berger sprinted through the women's "A" field race to a
strong victory. In the women's "B" race. Jen Daly,a grad
uate student in the School of Education, pushed forward
in the last lap to take the lead, which she held through the
finish line for first place. Stefan Meister, a graduate stu
dent in management science and engineering, finished
second in the men's "B" race.
By hosting a race on campus, the cycling team hoped
to generate publicity and invigorate a lineup that shrunk

with a high graduation rate last year. In particular, they
hoped to reach out to students who had never watched a
race before and encourage people to join the team. While
cyclists may look intimidating in their Spandex suits.
Brownsberger and the rest of the team tried toshare their
unofficial motto with the student body: "No pressure,
hike fun."
Aside from student outreach, the team also wanted to
give friends and other student fans a chance to watch a
race without worrying about off-campus transportation,
and Sunday brought great success in both.
"'Hie success of this year's event makes us optimistic
about holding our race on campus again,"said race direc
tor Meister. who was largely responsible lor the week
end's events. "The feedback was very positive from rac
ers. officials, and spectators. Repeating the event should
be easier next year, but we will still face challenges such
as securing enough funding."
As this race was the last before conference champi
onships. the stakes were high for Stanford, and the team
now looks to keep its momentum. But the cycling team,
which holds three of the hist 10 national championships
and lias produced three Olympians and IX All Ameri
cans in the past 10 years, already sees this weekend ;is an
accomplishment. Ihe team member believe their per
formance this weekend should put them in prime stand
ing for the conference championship. April 24-25. Be
cause collegiate cycling values scores at the conference
championship almost as much as the cumulative scores
from the rest of the season, the team hopes to keep up its
fitness for next weekend. I"he Cardinal is ;ilso looking to
qualify for the ( ollcgiate Road Nationals in Fort (ollins.
Colo.. May 8-10.
"Individual winners of the conference championship
road race and criterion get tostart at the front of the pack
at Nationals, which can be a great advantage when there
are 100 plus riders on the start line." Brownsberger said.
" I"he Stanford 'A' women ;ilso have a team time trial Na
tional ( hampionship to defend this year in Fort ( ollins.
so we'll be focusing a great deal on preparing for that."
I lowever.as their season stretches toward the end.the
Stanford cyclists are also looking after their health and
well-being.
"You can bet that the Stanford riders will spend some
quality time with their feet up these next few weeks to
rest up for all these races." Brownsberger said.
