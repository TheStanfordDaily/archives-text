# Summer Research College cut
## Shrinking budget leads VPUE to redirect funds toward grants instead of housing 
### ELIZABETH TITUS 
For undergraduates looking to live on
campus this summer while they do
research. Summer Research College
(SRC) is no longer an option, according to
University administrators. SR( previously
housed about 200 students in Manzanita,
hired staff and ran academic and social
programming, hut with a shrinking budget,
funding has been redirected.
"We're putting as much money as we
can into the direct student grants, rather
than spend money on that residential com
ponent." said Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education John Bravman.
Hut some students applying for summer
housing could still end up in Manzanita.
explained Executive Director of Student

Housing Rodger Whitney. Housing assign
ments will he determined hy summer
Draw numbers, and student researchers
will not have priority in those residences,
he said.
Whitney said Student Housing is pre
pared to accommodate would-be SRC stu
dents. and that to his knowledge,
Residential Education would hire addi
tional resident assistants (RAs) for
Man/anita.
While Bravman would not disclose the
cost of the SRC residential program, which
employed five to seven RAs and two
RCCs, he said that the cuts would preserve
research grants for "something like 15
more students." SRC Director Brian
Thomas wrote in an email to The Daily
that those grants usually amount to $5,200

for full-time researchers.
Thomas noted, however, that some of
SRC's academic programming will remain.
"We'll still be running a small series of
workshops and faculty dinners this sum
mer," he said. "The real academic focus of
SRC, then and now. is to provide under
graduates interested in research an oppor
tunity to participate in research-related
workshops and panel discussions."
Bravman said he does not think stu
dents' summer research experience will
change significantly.
"I think the main character of SRC?
comes through the work students are
doing with faculty and often in departmen
tal clusters," he said. "We do not have any
strong evidence that this residential com
ponent was a particularly critical part of

the program. I liked having it. hut again, I
compare that to 15 or so more students
that we could support."
Philip Bui 11. who participated in SRC
last summer, said that cutting the residen
tial program "definitely changes the expe
rience."
"I really enjoyed it."he said about liv
ing in Castano. "It was really nice talking
to people about my research. I definitely
made some good friends because of SRC."
Cecilia Jojola 'I I also really enjoyed the
program and said the SRC staff was an
important part of the summer she spent in
the program.
"The 2008 summer staff were the most
amazing bunch of people, and they were
always planning some cool event
for the dorm." she said. "[SRC] was
one of the best experiences I've had
on this campus. As a matter of fact,
it was the main reason I've tried to
convince so many of my other
friends to spend a summer at
Stanford."
Bravman said he will send a let
ter to the Stanford community in
the next two weeks "that talks
about all the reductions we've had
to endure" in VPUE. including
undergraduate research
"I think after our reductions this
year, we still have about the largest
undergraduate research program in
the country." he said. "It's still a
multi-million-dollar program. Ten
years ago. I think that number was
about $300,000. We've greatly
expanded this program over the
past decade. Unfortunately, we've
had to pull it back some because of
the large decrease in the
University's endowment."
Even though he felt the cut was
necessary. Thomas said he will miss
the residential program.
"I know I've watched a really
dedicated and engaged group of

students come together under the
same roof over the five summers
that I've been directing SRC." he
said.
Thomas added, however, that
after weighing the residential pro
gram against research opportuni
ties. the cut was "the right thing to
do."
Students can find more informa
tion on the SRC Web site or through
departments and programs that
receive VPUE research fundinti.
