## Sorority rush numbers increase Approx. 50 more girls rushed this year for over 20 percent increase 
### CHRISTINE McFADDEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
As spring sorority rush finishes up at Stanford and girls
get settled into their respective sisterhoods, statistics show a
significant increase in participants this year.
"This year. 307 girls signed up to participate in
Recruitment, and of that number, 258 girls attended the last
night. Preference Night." said Stanford's ISC Recruitment
Chair Joyce Dela Pena '10. in an email to the Daily.
According to Victoria Harman '09. a sorority recruitment
counselor, approximately 250 girls signed up for Recruitment
last year, marking an over 20 percent increase in this year's
rush.
The minimum for this year's new pledge classes was 42
girls, which meant that each participating sorority — Kappa
Alpha Theta. Pi Beta Phi. Chi Omega. Delta Delta Delta and
Kappa Kappa Gamma — gave out at least that many bids.
"The one exception was Alpha I-'psilon Phi. Stanford's newest
sorority, which took fewer members.
"These numbers are higher from last year and the year
before, both in terms of the number of girls who signed up
and how many returned every night." Dela Pena said. "There
are probably several reasons for this, one being that the fresh
men classes are just larger than they have been in the past."
Dela Pena went on to list additional explanations for the
increased number of girls who rushed, including the number
of sorority-sponsored activities put on each year that could
have perhaps helped to spread the (ireek word. From philan
thropic opportunities to sports games. Greek life is adver
tised across a broad spectrum of campus-wide events.
"With the rush statistics, the number of girls who come to
Preference Night is always lower than the number who start
out — girls pull themselves out of the process tor various rea
sons. and it happens every year." said ISC President Ali Fox
'09. "But despite that, we had incredible retention rates
the best we've had in recent memory — so we're quite
pleased with that."
The sharp increase in the number of girls rushing coin
cides with this year's Draw changes, hut the ISC' downplayed
speculation that increased interest in sororities this year
stems from students hoping to bypass the Draw
Alvssa 1.0'12. who received a bid from Delta Delta Delta,
received automatic housing in the TriDelt house next year,
which includes two-room doubles.
"It's very nice to not have to worry about learning the new
Draw system and to not worry about where I'm going to
live," Lo said when asked about avoiding the Dr.iw this
spring.
1.0 did,however.say that her primary reasons for rushing
were social.
"We don't feel that the Draw or changes to the Draw have
much to do with this grow ing interest." Dela Pena said. "Hall
of Stanford's ISC sororities are un housed, and these attract
an equal number of women .is the housed chapters."
"While many girls do go into Recruitment hoping to live
in a housed sorority, the attraction is not a stress-free housing
option, but rather the sense ol community and friendship that
this particular environment fosters." she added.
Fox agreed that the Draw had nothing to do with the
influx of girls.
"In regard to why the retention rate was so high and why
the number of girls who rushed was
also high, I think it is not a function
of fear of the Draw, hut rather a sign
that Cireek life at Stanford is alive
and thriving "she said.
Fox felt that the changes to the
Draw are so new that people are
trying to navigate it right now rather
than avoid it.
"The growing number of prospec
tive new members indicates that the
Greek community has become a
very desirable community to take
part in. providing a strong network
and true bonds that cannot be found
elsewhere on campus," Fox said. "We
are thrilled at the unprecedented
interest in sororities at Stanford and
look forward to engaging with our
newest members."
