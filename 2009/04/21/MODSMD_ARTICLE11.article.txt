# The 						Dude Abides
## Phone's ringing, dude 
### 
As I sat in the Cubberley balcony for
this year's installation of "The Vagina
Monologues." 1 looked down at the
nameless masses below me. What I saw
should have come as no surprise, but it struck
me nonetheless. In literally every row, there
were at least one to two attendees who were
plucking away on their trusty iPhones.A myr
iad of phone calls, emails, texts, Facebook
messages and nervous compulsiveness akin
to a USC student's lust for blow dominated
the crowded theater.
Other than perhaps Draw horror stories
and breakdowns before midterms, the near
omnipresence of Apple's little stab at global
domination is unrivaled in its singular übiqui
ty on campus. We are simultaneously the
United States and Colombia, responsible for
both the production and the widespread
abuse of this iDrug.
One of the developers of the i Phone was a
Stanford grad. An extraordinarily well-publi
cized course on campus, CSI93P, deals with
iPhone application programming. CS profs
are cashing in with nifty apps. and fellow stu
dents and friends are designing innovative
new apps on their own (ZHDirect Chinese-
English Dictionary: check that shit out).The
iStanford application, besides giving you ac
cess to a map, athletics scores and the Stan
ford directory, will potentially one day allow
Stanford students to register for classes. And
according to a recent Oakland Tribune arti
cle. 4,000 Stanford students own either the
iPhone or the iTouch (though the article did
misreport the number of total students on
campus by roughly 2.000 too many).
Walking around campus, it certainly does
feel as if the majority of the campus popula
tion owns one of these little bastards. Entitled
sorority sisters, impassioned Synergy ac
tivists, absurd Midwestern members of the in
telligentsia. Dean Julie (who was featured last
fall in a Stanford-centric iPhone ad), my boss
in the ticket office,community center power
brokers and delightfully misanthropic Opin-

I cannot claim the iPhone is in
some way a symbol of status
or power because literally
HALF of this damn school
seems to own one.

ions editors — there is not a single con
stituency group that Steve Jobs has not man
aged to finagle his yuppied-out handheld cash
cow into.
Except for the inarticulate, Daily-colum
nizing San Diego caucus, that is. As a Verizon
customer whose two-year-old phone gets fan
tastic coverage only at the Stadium, and then
literally dies in Arrillaga and Old Union, it is
fascinating looking into the iPhone campus
culture. On a base level, this pronounced ad
diction is somewhat reasonable. AT&T sup
posedly has exclusive contract to build a
tower over Stanford, though the alleged tale
of Sigma ("hi trying to illegally house a Veri
zon antenna in their chimney always brings a
smile to my face.
1 cannot claim the iPhone is in some way a
symbol of status or power because literally
HALF of this damn school seems to own one.

However, the collective obsession over this
little black box of wonderment seems to be
very much a campus-wide activity. Stories of
iPhones ruined in showers, pools or drunken
evenings are not uncommon to most resi
dences.
My objection with the iPhone is not the re
sult of some inherent inferiority complex, nor
am I some Amish opponent to
technology/progress. Where 1 do take um
brage with con-founded innovation is its con
tribution to a marked decrease in the quality
of actual conversation.
Call me an out-of-date old fool; really, you
are more than welcome. I get it a bunch. Re
gardless. I am of the opinion that the iPhone is
a large reason why hordes of restaurant-goers
are spending less time talking to each other
and more time texting their other group of
friends about the evening's potential trajecto
ry. Though we heretics are often no better at
combating such an imposition upon tradition
al notions of communication and etiquette (at
times 1 catch myself being an oblivious
schmuck with my texting habits). iPhones
seem to be on the forefront of this cultural
tidal wave that I am still rather leery of.
I do not want to advocate going back to
telegraphs and the Pony Express: the increas
ing interconnectedness of the planet does
offer fascinating potential for humanity.
However. I want to make sure that we do not
let our advanced contraptions take over our
lives. At least for me. there is nothing more
dynamic and intellectually riveting than en
gaging with someone in a lively and protract
ed discussion on just about any topic, and no
iPhone app will ever be able to replace such
sentiments.

Even if Apple one day offers the i Phone for Ver
izon, Zack will still probably resist the tempta
tion, unless someone creates an app that will get
him a date for this weekend. Have a technical
answer to this human problem? Email Zack at
