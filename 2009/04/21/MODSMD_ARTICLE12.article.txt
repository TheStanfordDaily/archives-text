# Crime and Punishment
## A 						call to arms 
### 
For all nt the hurt that our generation has
come to associate with the idea of pre
emptive action, there's something beau
tiful in remembering that sometimes we real
ly are acting to prevent harm.
I had the chance to talk with former ASSU
President Denis Hayes '68. one of the major
figures in the founding of the April 22 celebra
tion of Earth Day, about the roiling student
body of the '60s. I lis Stanford was a different
place from our Stanford: the environmental
movement was strong and powerful, but so
was the anger.
The student activism that many of us regret
missing was present in full force — the kind of
activism that reflects deep feeling, spearhead
ed by people who seem willing to die for a
cause. There was cooperation in the name of
accomplishment, expressing anger with the
status quo. There were sit-ins. protests and
well-organized, believable threats of conse
quences. Students were notoriously effective
in making themselves heard.
Why so different now? Earth Day is to
morrow. and student interest in the environ
ment is soaring. I took CEE 173 A "Energy
Resources" last year with 75 people — a
record enrollment — and I TA'd it this year
for 150 people.There is evidence all over cam
pus that students from all kinds of back
grounds are developing a serious interest in
climate, energy and the environment, out of
interest, concern and even because of the le
gitimate prospect of employment. And yet:
there is little evidence of the activism we asso
ciate with Hayes' era of brightly colored,
sometimes angry hippies.
I'd argue this is a sign of hope for our gen
eration.even it it's a gift in the sense that an
IKEA futon is a gift: we have to figure out how

to put it together, but the effort is worthwhile.
We have the fortune to be called to ac
tivism. not reactivism. Earth Day and the
modern environmental movement were.after
all. largely founded in reaction to environ
mental disasters that people were not able to
prevent: an oil spill off the coast of Santa Bar
bara. ozone layer depletion, excessive use of
pesticides.
Having the privilege of protesting the
threat drilling poses to a live polar bear seems
a much better starting point than having to
protest drilling with a picture of a dead, oil
covered seal.
We have the option to protest because we
know that we face harm, not a mandate to
protest the harm that has already been inflict
ed. With this option comes the potential for
true satisfaction, largely unmarred by memo
ries of the horrors we couldn't stop from hap
pening. if we accomplish our goals.
To be sure. I'm one of the first people to
point out that we have already wrought signif
icant damage on our environment with regard
to climate change. We're in for what has al
ready been observed.and what we do now will
be felt 40 years down the road.
Is it frustrating that I can't effectively
protest the lack of American climate policy by
tying myself to a tree and refusing to move?
Of course it is. Hut for the most part, the envi
ronmental problems we have inherited live in
a future that we can change if we try hard
enough. We live in a world of enough informa
tion and access to resources that we can fore
see major problems and holler our heads off
to stop things before they happen.
Instead of protesting in response to a
wound that has been inflicted because we
could not see it coming, we have the chance to

protest that someone is raising a knife.
We still have the right to he angry that the
knife has been raised. But our advantage is
that if we're successful in getting it lowered,
we can resume friendly — if wan — relations
with the knife-raiser. Once the blow is inflict -
ed, it's very difficult to forgive.
We have much to learn from the era of re
activism. not least being the types of horrors
we can expect to face if we fail in our preemp
tive activism. But we cannot forget that there
are advantages to the fact that the large-scale
demonstrations and violent protests of the
first environmental movement do not work
well when we are dealing with things like cli
mate change.
The worst has not yet happened, and with
careful effort and true, productive activism,
we can prevent it from ever happening.
This is a gift we need to read the instruc
tions to. to be sure: the problem with preemp
tive activism is that it's sometimes difficult to
know what you're fighting for. so threats seem
diminished and it's easy to see action as being
nonurgent. But we are armed with education
and societal connectivity, able to quickly iden
tify and share problems and ideas.
And therefore we can use our protests to
build, not lament.

it's awkward that she's ready to party it up for
Earth Day while with an institution that cele

March versus April Earth Days.
