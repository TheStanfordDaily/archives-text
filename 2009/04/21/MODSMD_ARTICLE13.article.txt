The Stanford baseball team bounced back with an 11-1 thrashing of Santa Clara on Monday night.
The Cardinal was able to regain its composure after being swept by Arizona State last weekend.
began with one out in the first in
ning. August began the rally by
singling up the middle. After a
walk to junior left fielder Toby
Gerhart, sophomore right fielder
Kellen Kiilsgaard began the scor
ing by hitting a hot shot to the
right of shortstop Jon Karcich.
The ball careened off his wrist and
into left field for a single, and Kar
cich appeared injured on the play
but remained in the game.
Milleville then lined his first dou
ble of the day into the right center
field gap,scoring Gerhart and Kiils

guard. Sophomore catcher Zach
Jones followed with a base hit in
front of the right fielder, scoring
Milleville. Two batters later, sopho
more shortstop Jake Schlander
capped the first inning scoring by
lacing a double down the left field
line, scoring Jones.
The Cardinal would not look
back from there,as the team pound
ed out 11 hits over the first three in
nings and IN for the game.
Lost in Stanford's hitting spree
was the performance of the Stan
ford pitching staff.
Freshman Scott Snodgress (1-2)
picked up his first career victory on
Monday. Snodgress surrendered
four hits over three shutout innings,
repeatedly getting ahead of Bronco
hitters and keeping them off bal

ance. Eight of the nine outs
Snodgress recorded were ground
balls.
The lone Santa Clara run was
scored off of Stanford closer Drew
Storen in the top of the ninth inning.
The appearance was his first since
surrendering seven runs in a third of
an inning Saturday at Arizona State.
But I lead Coach Mark Marquess
is not concerned with the perform
ance of his star closer.
"He's not a machine: he's been
phenomenal all season. Without
Drew Storen we may have eight less
wins — if he has one bad outing in
10. it's okay." Marquess said.
Storen's blown save Saturday
was part of Arizona State's three
game sweep ol the Cardinal in
Tempe this past weekend.

The Sun Devils, the top team in
the Pacific-10 Conference, made the
Cardinal look more like the team
that began the season 3-9 than the
one that had won 12 of its last 16
games prior to the series.
Milleville says the team isn't
pressing, despite the tough week
end.
"We didn't really change any
thing." he said. "Everyone was frus
trated with the weekend, but we just
came out today, the ball bounced
our way and we swung the bat well."
The team will look to continue
rebounding Wednesday when it
plays host to the rival California
Golden Bears at 5 p.m.
