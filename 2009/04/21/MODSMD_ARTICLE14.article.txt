# Stanford athletics' secret weapon: Condoleezza Rice
## 
### 
Tai-ler Jones is ;i foreign name
to practically the entire Stan
ford community, hut the high
school junior from Georgia
will soon make his presence known
on the farm. Jones, rated among the
best wide receivers in his class, com
mitted to the C 'ardinal last week over
Notre Dame, w here his father played
linebacker, and (ieorgia. his home
state school. With his verbal decision.
Jones became the top committed
prospect in Stanford's 2010 recruit
ing class, providing the ( ardinal the
victory in a difficult battle with two
traditional powers, and further indi
eating the resurgence of the I niver
sitv's football program

Jones' recruiting tale is. for the
most part, hardly unique he was
courted by schools nationwide,
watched by coaches who went to the
Peach State to see him play, and he
visited campuses, received offers and
so on Hui the process took on a lile
ol its own when he went to Stanford
Stadium to watch the Cardinal prac
tice. where lie was joined by a
Hoover fellow formerly known as
the most powerful woman in the
world.
Rial's right: Condoleezza Rice
was on the recruiting trail.
Her interest in sports is well
known after her tenure as Secre
tary ol State, she was reportedly ap

proached about becoming the com
missioner of the Pacific-i() Confer
ence. I lei I loovcr office is lined with
athletics memorabilia, .lust last
week, she wrote a diary for Ihe
Daily Heast chronicling her first ex
perience at the Masters, where she
rooted on former Stanford golfer
I'iger Woods. In an interview with
ITie Stanford Daily upon her return
to campus, she said."You will see me
at sports, definitely."
Hut when she met Jones, she was
more than just an avid fan.
"(She| actually came up tome and
said that she heard I had Notre


Makowsky
Between the lines
Dame ties even though I've never
actually seen or talked to her." Jones
told TTie Bootleg. "'lTien. she went
into the skybox for a good 20 min
utes with me. my dad and my uncle.
She told me what she thinks I could
do at this school and how I could
excel, as well as the steps I need to
take so I can graduate early to better
prepare myself."
After spending the past eight
years negotiating within the highest
levels of United States and interna
tional government, buttering up a
high school student may seem like a
small order for Rice. But the stakes,
at least within the world of collegiate
football, were remarkably high, and
it appears that her talk with Jones
had at least something to do with his
ultimate commitment. Examine
Jones' quote: Rice knew his back
ground and how to appeal to his aca
demic sensibilities, and sold the en
tire Stanford package that coach Jim
Uarbaugh so often emphasizes to re
cruits.
It is one example, but it says a lot:
in Rice. Stanford has a valuable asset
to its athletics program.
It's not hard to see why. Rice is
an intriguing and pioneering
stateswoman — that is not my
opinion as much as it is fact. When
she returned to the Farm this year,
many felt that she might get a simi
lar welcome to the one her col
league Donald Rumsfeld received
when he accepted a position at
Hoover in the fall of 2007 — that is,
protests begetting more protests,
and general dissatisfaction and out

rage at the appointment. But in
stead. Rice's return was almost en
tirely civil, and even some of her
detractors offered her respect, be
grudgingly or not.
In addition to her academic and
government work. Rice is also a
racial role model who grew up in
Birmingham during the time of Bull
Connor, going on to become one of
the most influential African Ameri
can leaders in this nation's modern
history.
With all of this combined,you can
imagine how it must feel to be a
teenager who thinks he's going to
watch a simple scrimmage, and is in
stead met by a woman who just three
months ago was trying to negotiate a
ceasefire between Israel and Hamas,
and then proceeds to tell you all the
reasons why you. and specifically
you. should choose Stanford.
And. moving away from recruit
ing for a moment, it's also prudent to
look at the Athletic Department's fi
nancial situation, and how Rice can
be of assistance there. Currently, she
commands the same fee per speech
(SISO.(KX)) that President Bush does,
a rather remarkable feat — if noth
ing else, she is a good draw. I'm sure
we can find plenty of alumni for a
thousand-dollar-plus dinner with
Condi.
Of course, this is all contingent on
Rice wanting to undertake these ef
forts, but given her devotion to both
the University and sports, I have a
feeling that her interaction with Jai
ler Jones won't be the last time she's
an active advocate for Stanford.

Wyndam Makowsky would like
someone to spot him a grand so he can
attend Condi's fundraising dinner.
