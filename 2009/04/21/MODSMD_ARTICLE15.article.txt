# ATHLETICS DEPARTMENT
## NEW FACILITY SHINES 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY MANAGING EDITOR 
Willi their old training building deteriorating
and space issues mounting, the athletic depart
ment turned to an old friend for help. John Ar
rillaga. whose surname already adorns a num
ber of Stanford buildings, is the main benefactor of a badly
needed new varsity athletics facility that opened at the be
ginning of spring quarter, and will be the main practice
space for women's volleyball and both basketball teams.
The Arrillaga (iymnasium and Weight Room.as it is for
merly known. is an extension of Maples Pavilion that sits be
tween the arena and its parking lot. Colloquially known as
"Maples Practice." the 30.0()()-foot facility took eight
months and $10 million to complete and features a multi
purpose gym. as well as a state-of the-art weight room.
I'he need for a new building developed over a number of
years and a multitude of reasons. Firstly, the old training cen
ter. located near the Varsity Field Hockey Turf, became
more inhabitable and out-of-date. Secondly, given that
Maples can only have one team practicing at a time, the bas
ketball and volleyball squads were forced to find time at
Burnham Pavilion and even the Ford Center. With their
locker rooms housed in Maples, this meant that teams had
to change in one location and practice in another.
"It was not good for programs." said Maples Facility
Manager John Erickson. who gave The Daily a personal

tour of the new facility. "'lTiis filled a prominent need . . it
was on our wish list for a while."
At first glance,the building, which was built 011 space that
was originally a part of a parking lot. appears to be a half
sized model of Maples. Its exterior is practicall) identical,
down lt> the copper lining along its roof. It is not connected
to Maples above ground, but there is ;i tunnel that runs from
the locker rooms 111 the original facility to the gym in the new
structure.
"It's very much a part of Maples." I tickson snid. " I'he
restrooms are still in Maples."
liven inside, an initial look around the 2().()()()-foot g\m
nasium does not reveal much.There are four baskets and lit
tie else.
"It's a Spartan building four walls and a roof with 110
bleachers." ITickson said."lt really is a practice facility."
But a more intensive look shows the intricate cable s\s
tem along the gym's ceiling that lowers both volleyball nets
and additional basketball hoops, with practically no manual
labor. The gym can simultaneous!) have two full-sized has
ketball or thfee regulation-sized volleyball courts, and I 1
ickson even said that the building could be used for \( 'A A
competition, although that is not currently a plan.

The new 20,000-square foot gymnasium will allow for Stanford sports teams, especially basketball and volleyball, more space
for practices. Prior to the construction of the new facility, these teams often had to train in unfavorable circumstances.
