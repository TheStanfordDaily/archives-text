# ATHLETICS DEPARTMENT
## NEW FACILITY SHINES 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY MANAGING EDITOR 
Willi their old training building deteriorating
and space issues mounting, the athletic depart
ment turned to an old friend for help. John Ar
rillaga. whose surname already adorns a num
ber of Stanford buildings, is the main benefactor of a badly
needed new varsity athletics facility that opened at the be
ginning of spring quarter, and will be the main practice
space for women's volleyball and both basketball teams.
The Arrillaga (iymnasium and Weight Room.as it is for
merly known. is an extension of Maples Pavilion that sits be
tween the arena and its parking lot. Colloquially known as
"Maples Practice." the 30.0()()-foot facility took eight
months and $10 million to complete and features a multi
purpose gym. as well as a state-of the-art weight room.
I'he need for a new building developed over a number of
years and a multitude of reasons. Firstly, the old training cen
ter. located near the Varsity Field Hockey Turf, became
more inhabitable and out-of-date. Secondly, given that
Maples can only have one team practicing at a time, the bas
ketball and volleyball squads were forced to find time at
Burnham Pavilion and even the Ford Center. With their
locker rooms housed in Maples, this meant that teams had
to change in one location and practice in another.
"It was not good for programs." said Maples Facility
Manager John Erickson. who gave The Daily a personal

tour of the new facility. "'lTiis filled a prominent need . . it
was on our wish list for a while."
At first glance,the building, which was built 011 space that
was originally a part of a parking lot. appears to be a half
sized model of Maples. Its exterior is practicall) identical,
down lt> the copper lining along its roof. It is not connected
to Maples above ground, but there is ;i tunnel that runs from
the locker rooms 111 the original facility to the gym in the new
structure.
"It's very much a part of Maples." I tickson snid. " I'he
restrooms are still in Maples."
liven inside, an initial look around the 2().()()()-foot g\m
nasium does not reveal much.There are four baskets and lit
tie else.
"It's a Spartan building four walls and a roof with 110
bleachers." ITickson said."lt really is a practice facility."
But a more intensive look shows the intricate cable s\s
tem along the gym's ceiling that lowers both volleyball nets
and additional basketball hoops, with practically no manual
labor. The gym can simultaneous!) have two full-sized has
ketball or thfee regulation-sized volleyball courts, and I 1
ickson even said that the building could be used for \( 'A A
competition, although that is not currently a plan.

The Arrillaga Gymnasium and Weight Room, which opened at the beginning of spring quarter, includes a 10,000-square foot
weiaht room for Stanford athletes. It boasts new technology including the Kaiser Performance Trainer, pictured on the right.

The new 20,000-square foot gymnasium will allow for Stanford sports teams, especially basketball and volleyball, more space
for practices. Prior to the construction of the new facility, these teams often had to train in unfavorable circumstances.
Closer examination shows off
more simplistic yet necessary addi
tions. such as subtle lines along the
floor that act as foul lines for the ad
ditional side hoops.
Further installations are still
waiting to be implemented. The
building is wired to support a video
system that would hold cameras
along the wall for coaches to watch
practice tape from multiple angles,
hut the cameras have yet to be in
stalled.
The gym will be used for intramu
rals and recreation in addition to
varsity team practices, as the facility
began extending hours to the stu
dent body on Monday.
Hut non-athletes will not be able
to use the other 1 (),()<)() feet of the
building, the weight room, which
makes efficient use of its relatively
small size, especially compared to
the old practice facility.
"You can have twice as many ath
letes training in half the space." said
Preston Greene, an assistant sports
performance coach who is mainly af
filiated with the men's basketball
program.
Greene estimated that SO to 90
athletes could use the weight room
at once, and that practically every
single team will make use of it.
It is a rectangular room that has a
turf floor near one long wall, at the
request of strength coaches. The
equipment is entirely new, and is
dedicated entirely to weight training
and stretching — calisthenics ma
chines. such as treadmills, have not
been installed yet.
Some devices provide strength
coaches with more information than
ever before. The Keiser Perfor

mance Trainer, for instance, helps
basketball players build up strength
while in defensive stances. Greene
has them grab a handle and pull it to
ward them while in a crouch and.
with each successive repetition, is
able to see what percentage of their
initial burst they are able to retain.
"1 can tell coach [Johnny|
Dawkins exactly when a guy fa
tigues." Greene said.
Beyond the machines, and much
like the hidden foul lines in the
gymnasium, there are slight modifi
cations to help athletes. For exam
ple, on pull-up bars, there are both
large and regular grips — the large
ones are for sports like basketball,
which require a player to palm a
bigger ball. Other additions protect
the building — the walls are made
of concrete, because some teams
have drills where they throw medi
cine balls against them.The walls in
Maples are made of plaster, so
dents were unavoidable: in the new
facility, they are practically nonex
istent.
Although further changes will be
made in the coming months,athletes
are already beginning to use the new
technology in the weight room and
brand-new gym. Still. Erickson pre
dicts that it will take another year to
completely figure out logistics, espe
cially in the fall, when women's vol
leyball is in the middle of its season
and the basketball teams are in in
tense preseason training.
That said, with a new gym that
will appeal to the entire Stanford
community, and a weight room that
may prompt athletes to spend even
more time working out (if only to try
out all the new gadgets). Maples
Practice is the newest addition to the
athletic departments' already im
pressive lineup of facilities.
