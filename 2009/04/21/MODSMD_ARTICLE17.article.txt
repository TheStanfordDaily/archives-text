# ACADEMIC LIFE
## "Quants" adjust to economic landscape 
### ELLIOT JIN 
"Quants," the formula-wielding
scientists-cum-financiers who
made billions during the hull mar
ket of the middle of this decade,
are now coming under fire for their
role in the financial meltdown. But
at Stanford, interest in becoming a
"quant" remains strong.
When a physics Ph.D. leaves the
realm of quarks and superstrings to
chase the allure of Wall Street, he
or she becomes a "quant." Since
the late many physicists and
other scientists have made the
jump to the financial industry to
apply methods of quantitative
analysis to the science of money.
Economics major Kunal
Khanna '10. who is also a Daily
columnist, explained the appeal of
financial mathematics to science
oriented students.
"The beauty of financial prob
lems is that you can look at them as
a financial problem, or you can
model them as. for example, the
way a particle moves." Khanna
said. "Finance is just as quantita
tive as physics."
However, the reaction to the
recent financial crisis has called
such methods into question. Wired
magazine has blamed Wall Street's
devastation on the "Gaussian cop
ula function," a mathematical
equation for modeling risk, and the
Christian Science Monitor has said
that math and science experts in
the finance industry will swiftly be
making a return to academia.
For its part. Stanford will not be
padding the ranks of its physics,
mathematics or statistics depart
ments with the depleted ranks of
the financial industry. In fact,
Stanford professors predict that
demand for highly trained quanti
tative individuals in finance will
only increase.
"It's a little too soon to see
trends, but I suspect [the financial
industry] will want top people
more than ever." said Prof. Trevor

Hastie, chairman of the statistics
department. "The companies that
use these quantitative methods
have actually survived quite well."
Mathematics Prof. George
Papanicolaou shares the consensus
regarding the success of quantita
tive methods.
"I think there's a fundamental
shift in the financial services indus
try — it's become more quantita
tive," Papanicolaou said. "Old
school bankers and finance profes
sionals are being, in effect,
replaced by much more quantita
tively and competently trained
people."
Yet both Papanicolaou and
Prof. Patricia Burchat, physics
department chair, agree that cur
rent students are considering aca
demia over Wall Street.
"I think, because of the financial
meltdown, and also because of the
Obama administration's emphasis
on science, that more students will
major in physics or the sciences for
[the sake of] science itself."
Burchat said.
However, Stanford's program in
financial mathematics has not seen
any decline in enrollment.
According to Papanicolaou, the
program's appeal lies in its empha
sis on the fundamental methods
behind quantitative finance.
"We haven't seen any drop in
enrollment — there's a lot of inter
est in these classes, because they
are fundamental mathematical sci
ence classes." Papanicolaou said.
"It's very appealing — it's a very
intense mathematical education, so
it attracts good people. I wish there
were more [students]; it's a tough
program, but it's a good one."
"The point of view of our pro
gram here is very basic."
Papanicolaou added. "Whether
you want to be academic or
whether you want to go into prac
tice, you cet the same education."
