# A
						New look at Writing
## Stanford curriculum aims to strike a balance 
### ANNEKE NELSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Besides late nights and [something witty,
give me a see], writing might be the most uni
versal feature of a Stanford education â€” and
the I University s main writing requirements are
continuing to evolve to keep students' skills at
a high level.
Currently, Stanford's Writing in the Major
(WIM) requirement consists of three parts:
PWR I (taken freshman year). PWR 2 (usual
ly taken in sophomore year) and the WIM (a
major-specific course that focuses on written
assignments).
In the broader academic world, there are
ongoing discussions as to how to best incorpo
rate writing into the curriculum. Cornell, for
example, focuses on integrating disciplinary
writing at the beginning of the undergraduate
years. At Stanford, professors introduce stu
dents to college-level research before focusing
on the disciplinary work.
According to Marvin Diogenes, associate
director of the Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR) and acting director of WIM,
finding a balance between preparation and
specialization is an ongoing process, though he
is satisfied with the current setup.
" Ihis is a lively debate at almost every uni
versity you can think of," Diogenes said.
"Stanford's no exception. There are specific
forms of engagement all the way through. The
WIM course can be taken from sophomore to
senior year. I feel fairly good about what we're
doing now."
However. Diogenes acknowledged,
"there's always room for improvement."
Much of the current philosophy behind the
program comes from studies conducted in
prior years. Diogenes and PW R Program
Director Andrea Lunsford have previously
carried out the Stanford Study of Writing to
research how to best implement the writing
requirement.
The two studied a group of students from
their entrance to Stanford in 2001 until a year
after their graduation in 2005. While still ana
lyzing data collected from surveys and inter
views about IHUM, PWR and other WIM
courses. Lunsford and Diogenes are currently
writing a book about this project, which could
eventually lead to further reform of the WIM
requirement.
At the moment, however, the effect of the
recession upon budgets is taking precedence
over curriculum revisions in many depart
ments. While it is difficult for any drastic
changes to be implemented given the fiscal cli
mate. the history department, for example, has
instituted some reforms to the way majors
meet their WIM requirement. Previously, the
department adhered to the standard
