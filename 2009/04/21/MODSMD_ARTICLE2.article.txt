# A 						New look at Writing
## Stanford curriculum aims to strike a balance 
### ANNEKE NELSON SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Besides late nights and [something witty,
give me a see], writing might be the most uni
versal feature of a Stanford education — and
the I University s main writing requirements are
continuing to evolve to keep students' skills at
a high level.
Currently, Stanford's Writing in the Major
(WIM) requirement consists of three parts:
PWR I (taken freshman year). PWR 2 (usual
ly taken in sophomore year) and the WIM (a
major-specific course that focuses on written
assignments).
In the broader academic world, there are
ongoing discussions as to how to best incorpo
rate writing into the curriculum. Cornell, for
example, focuses on integrating disciplinary
writing at the beginning of the undergraduate
years. At Stanford, professors introduce stu
dents to college-level research before focusing
on the disciplinary work.
According to Marvin Diogenes, associate
director of the Program in Writing and
Rhetoric (PWR) and acting director of WIM,
finding a balance between preparation and
specialization is an ongoing process, though he
is satisfied with the current setup.
" Ihis is a lively debate at almost every uni
versity you can think of," Diogenes said.
"Stanford's no exception. There are specific
forms of engagement all the way through. The
WIM course can be taken from sophomore to
senior year. I feel fairly good about what we're
doing now."
However. Diogenes acknowledged,
"there's always room for improvement."
Much of the current philosophy behind the
program comes from studies conducted in
prior years. Diogenes and PW R Program
Director Andrea Lunsford have previously
carried out the Stanford Study of Writing to
research how to best implement the writing
requirement.
The two studied a group of students from
their entrance to Stanford in 2001 until a year
after their graduation in 2005. While still ana
lyzing data collected from surveys and inter
views about IHUM, PWR and other WIM
courses. Lunsford and Diogenes are currently
writing a book about this project, which could
eventually lead to further reform of the WIM
requirement.
At the moment, however, the effect of the
recession upon budgets is taking precedence
over curriculum revisions in many depart
ments. While it is difficult for any drastic
changes to be implemented given the fiscal cli
mate. the history department, for example, has
instituted some reforms to the way majors
meet their WIM requirement. Previously, the
department adhered to the standard
University WIM requirements, which
call for it certain number of pages writ
ten, as well as a certain number of revi
sions.
For those who have declared a his
tory major since September, however,
the requirements have become more
rigorous, according to Prof. Jessica
Riskin. history's director of
I Jndergraduate Studies.
"I listory is a subject in which writ
ing is a core aspect." Riskin said. "For
historians, it's the heart of what we
do."
The new requirements include
writing a 20- to 25-page research
paper in the student's junior or senior
year. This includes original research
with primary sources and substantial
revisions.
Riskin hopes that students will get
first-hand experience with an histori
an's work.
"It's hard to separate thinking his

torically from writing," Riskin said.
"As long as students are hearing
about it in classes, they're not really
having a first-hand experience of it. I
hope they have a moment in the
course of their history major where
they're required to be doing it them
selves."
Riskin acknowledged that the new
history department writing require
ment can appear to be a lot of work.
"Students might be worried about
that," Riskin said. "But 1 hope it's
going to be a lot of fun. It's their own
project and it's up to them to do what
they want with that. They'll have a
chance to work independently."
While other departments are dis
cussing changes — the English
department is debating adding more
classes that will fulfill the WIM
requirement — as of yet. there are no
concrete reforms being implemented,
especially with the fiscal climate.
Interest is coining especially from
students.
Those in the new Undergraduate
Senate, elected under the platform of
Students for a Better Stanford (SBS).
promised the student body they would

look into reforming the PWR and
I HUM programs (see "SBS retools
with platform," April 10).
While only the faculty senate can
legally implement reforms to the writ
ing requirement, I.unsford was recep
tive to meeting with the senators, say
ing that students have a big influence
in the process.
"We would love to talk with [SBS
students]," she said. "[Though] We're
not sure what they want to change."
Shelley Gao.'l I. incumbent Senate
Chair, helped to clarify SBS concerns.
"Reforming the writing curriculum
was never an explicit part of the SBS
platform," Gao wrote in an email to
the Daily. "However. the
Undergraduate Senate is interested in
reviewing academic initiatives, seeking
student input and representing stu
dent voice in University decision
making regarding academics."
In addition, there are further proj
ects underway to support the teaching
of writing, including the transforma
tion of Adelfa into a writing focus
house, beginning this fall. Diogenes,
who also the resident fellow (RF) for
West Lagunita.said that forms for pre

assignment for Adelfa arc already
available.
"[The writing focus dorm] will
invite exploration of academic and
nonacademic writing: anything from
I HUM. PWR. WIM. Spoken Word
and even improv," Diogenes said.
The dorm will not have any formal
classes, but will offer workshops.
Programming will also be made avail
able for those who live outside of
Adelfa.
Those involved in the cornerstone
writing programs anticipate a contin
ued evolution of writing at Stanford in
upcoming years.
"Our ideal [as the WIM depart
ment | is to engage with students about
their writing all the way through their
undergrad experience," Diogenes
said. "We know writing is present in
undergrad life. But what differs from
university to university is the quality of
support. That's always been our aim.
to provide quality of support from
beginning to end..."
"And beyond!" added I .unsford.
