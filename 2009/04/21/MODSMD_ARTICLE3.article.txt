### JENNY PETER CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
With time ticking down in the
2008-2009 NCAA calendar,
Stanford's trophy case was beginning
to look empty. In true championship
fashion, the men's gymnastics team
took it upon themselves to bring
home the hardware, winning an
NCAA title at the National
Championships last weekend.
Stanford's first four gymnasts of
the meet started off with solid vaults.
Sophomores Ryan Lieberman and
Kyle Oi put up high scores of 15.7
and 15.75. Classmates Alex Buscaglia
(15.85) and Tim Gentry (15.95) also
produced solid attempts and quali
fied for individual finals the next day,
where Gentry became an All-
American after taking third place
with a 16.175.
The Cardinal's parallel bars lineup
was its best of the year, taking the
team title with a 59.3. Redshirt senior
Sho Nakamori, Lieberman and red

shirt sophomore Nick Noone quali
fied for finals, and all were All-
Americans, taking fourth, fifth and
seventh, respectively. For Nakamori.
this event was crucial to the team's
success.
"To he able to go to parallel bars
as our second event and knock out
routine after routine gave us a lot of
confidence and momentum for the
rest of the meet," he said.
The Cardinal continued to excel
with a good showing in the high bar.
Buscaglia (14.8) and Nakamori
(14.75) moved onto finals and
became All-Americans, coming in
third and fourth respectively.
Although floor surprisingly dif
fered from the team's usual near-per
fect performance, it was good enough
for second place thanks to the team's
depth. Redshirt junior Cireg Ter-
Zakharients qualified for finals with
a score of 15.5.
On pommel horse, Stanford hit
five of six routines for a 58.450. Ter-
Zakhariants posted a top-10 finish

The standings were close as the
meet came down to the last and most
exciting rotation. Cal was ahead of
Stanford going into the event, and
Oklahoma was finishing on vault,
which had been its best event all vear.
