## Stanford Report ends print edition Move comes as other Bay Area publishers cut back 
### AIMEE MILES 
ITie worldwide decline of print news
papers has affected a number of local
publications from Ihe San Francisco
Chronicle to The Stanford Daily. ITiis
summer. The Stanford Report will take
the most extreme step of any of the area
papers and cease print publication.
According to Ihe Report, the decision
was one of several cost-cutting measures
made in compliance with the I Jniversity's
broad mandate to reduce administrative
general funds budgets by 15 percent, all
toward $l<M) million in cuts for the next
fiscal year.
'ITie Report's move comes at a time
when the industry at large is suffering, not
I list because of the recession, but also due
to severe problems with the print media

business model.
Visiting Journalism Prof. Joel
Brinkley, a Pulitzer pri/e-winning foreign
correspondent, pointed out that the chal
lenges faced by a publication like The
Report are different from those affecting
citywide and nationally distributed publi
cations. Because they occupy a unique
niche, these publications rise and fall pri
marily upon funding issues rather than
more intractable problems.
[Free and independent newspapers]
must "simply weather the recession."
Brinkley said.
"They are not caught in the same cycle
ol destruction afflicting [district-wide and
national] newspapers." he added. "They
have the advantage of hvper-local news."
Nonetheless, the recession has been
particularly hard-hitting for local inde
pendent publications like The Palo Alto
Daily News, which has reduced its week
end print schedule by consolidating its
Saturday and Sunday editions into a sin
gle weekend edition. Across the Bay.

Berkeley's Daily Californian opted to
print four days a week, cutting its
Wednesday edition.
Other area papers are in even direr
straits â€” on Feb. 24 it was announced by
The San Francisco Chronicle that if "crit
ical cost-saving measures" could not be
implemented within a matter of weeks,
the paper would be sold or closed alto
gether.
The San Jose Mercury News is also
facing its own economic woes: Its parent
company McC 'latchy Co. was warned yes
terday that it may be de-listed by the New
York Stock Hxchange because of its rap
idly deteriorating financial situation.
Brinkley said that the Internet has
posed a serious problem for print publi
cations that, in offering their own online
editions, wind up competing with them
selves.
"You pay quite a bit to have Ihe
Chronicle delivered to your front door.
