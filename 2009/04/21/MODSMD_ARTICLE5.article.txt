# Cleantech taking off
## Silicon Valley connections put Stanford in prime position for new industry 
### ERIC MESSINGER DESK EDITOR 
Clean technology is set to become a major growth
area in upcoming years, as sustainabilitv and environ
mentally friendly products gain importance, and the
Stanford community appears poised to become signifi
cantly involved in its rise.
Clean technology, or "cleantech." is gaining nation
wide attention as part of the slow shift towards sustain
able projects, renewable energy and other measures
designed in part to fight climate change. While momen
tum has been slow to build, with the Obama adminis
tration's commitment to a cap-and-trade system to reg
ulate carbon emissions, cleantech is set to receive an
immense amount of interest from both investors and
students entering the job market.
Management Science & Engineering Prof. Tom
Bvers. who focuses upon entrepreneurship. believes
that the growth of cleantech in the area could come to
resemble Silicon Valley's last major revolution.
"This feels a lot like 1994 or 1995. when the Internet
hit escape velocity." Byers said. "The student interest is
there, these are giant markets, and the technologies are
being developed."
"This could be an amazing five years." he added.
Drew Bennett 'OS M.S. '09. Co-president of the
Stanford chapter of Energy Crossroads, shared Byers'
optimism about the potential for massive growth.
"The next Google is going to be in cleantech," he
added.
Jonah Greenberger '08 has already entered the
cleantech sector, along with current student Weston
Mc√üride '09. The two co-founded a venture called
Project Ballast, which focuses upon an aspect of the
energy storage industry called "frequency regulation
services."
Greenberger said the two felt impatient after hear
ing so much about the industry, and wanted to get
involved themselves.
"We were kind of hearing about cleantech when we
never felt like we were contributing." Greenberger said.
"I'm ME [mechanical engineering] by background."
he added, "and my interest stems from the technology."
Greenberger cited the positive aspect of cleantech in
its uniting of both technologically and environmentally
inclined students.
"We end up at the same place, even though there's a
difference in intention," he said.
Ryan Rogers '11, an officer for Energy Crossroads,
believes Stanford's institutional attitudes are a natural
fit for clean technology.
"It is getting such a big hype in part because this is a
research university," Rogers said, "and we've always
had a tech focus, especially being near Silicon Valley."
"There is so much potential, and so many opportu
nities." Rogers added.
Despite its clear promise, cleantech is facing difficul
ties due to the recession, like many other sectors.
Bennett emphasized that the problem lay mostly in
securing investment monev for startup companies.
