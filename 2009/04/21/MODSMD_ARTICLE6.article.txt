112 / Y~ 112 ho staff I had freshman year
inspired me to contribute
hack to that community," said
I eland Farmer '11 of his deci
-JL sion to apply to he a Resident
Assistant (RA) next year.
He's not alone. According to Associate
Director of Residential I ducation (Resl d) Josh
Schiller, about 4(H) applicants applied for RA
positions for next year, as compared to some
for the current year.
Although Resl d has done no formal explo
ration into the reasons behind this surge in
interest in the RA program. Schiller named
three possible main factors.

"We're thinking that it has to do with the
HPAC [Head Peer Academic Coordinator)
positions being eliminated, the poor econonn
and the much larger freshman class that came in
two years ago" Schiller said. I .ach of these fac
tors. he explained, could motivate students to
seek RA positions.
"It's some combination of those three things
altogether," he said.
According to the applicants themselves, the
main motivation behind their desire to be RAs
has remained constant — they want to give
back.
"The number one thing is that I had a really
good experience as a freshman." said Alex
Scherer Ml. "I'm motivated to bring the new
class close to the experience I had. if not better."
All aspects of the RA position appeal to
Brindha Saravanabavanandhan 10.
"It's an awesome job." she said. "There are a
lot of responsibilities, but I personally like that
challenge."
Confusion about the changes to
the Draw, which includes three tiers
of housing options, the pre-assign
ment system and changes to the in
house draw, does not appear to have
been an important factor.
Still, applicants said, guaranteed
housing can't hurt.
Saravanabavanandhan pointed
out that the new system reduces stu
dents' chances of drawing between
one and 1 .(XX) from two years to one
year, which could lead to frustration.
"Most people at Stanford like to take
the initiative." Saravanabavanandhan
said, mentioning rushing or applying to
be an RA as wavs to "have more control

and secure a good living situation for
next year."
"I think people are definitely
going to pursue it," she added.
"The mentality is that people want
to save the best for senior year,"
Farmer said. "That's probably a moti
vation for a lot of people."
Scherer reiterated other factors
mentioned by Schiller and added a
few of his own.
"More all-freshmen dorms being
open is attracting more applicants. I
think." he said, "and staff positions on
campus are decreasing."
As for economic downturn,
Scherer's thoughts were straightfor
ward.
"Anything I can do to get some
more money in my pocket is great."
he said.
