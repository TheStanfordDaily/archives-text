## "I [don't] want to ride my bicycle I [don't] want to ride my bike" Students find reasons to go bike-less 
### JESSICA WERTHEIM CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Saying you are bike-less on this
campus is more or less the social
equivalent of saying "bomb" on an
airplane. There are gasps, whis
pered profanities and the occa
sional "Oh good God!"
Stanford's campus is the second largest
in the world, so it comes as no surprise that
the vast majority of its students own bikes.
"Without my bike. I would miss all my
classes, fail out of Stanford and live a life of
abject poverty, illicit drug use and rampant
crime," said a half-serious Robert
Schiemann '11.
Alice Bosley'll had her "baby" stolen
her first quarter at Stanford.
"I was without a bike for two months
fall quarter," she said. "It was stolen and I
was too lazy to go out and buy a new one,
so I walked everywhere. Eventually, my
bike was found in a forest missing a wheel,
and was really bent out of shape."
Bosley got another bike earlier this
year. While she was bike-less, though, she
didn't mind the walking and soon realized

that hiking actually ruined a large part the
outdoors experience Stanford has to offer.
"When 1 walked. I got to listen to music
and to relax." she said. "Strolling from one
place to the next gave me a chance to chill
out. Plus. 1 learned to walk really fast."
The only downside for Bosley present
ed itself in the form of a time constraint.
"If someone wanted me to meet them
in five minutes, most of the time it just was
n't possible "she noted.
In a Stanford student's busy life, so
much time is spent getting from point A to
point B. then back to point A, only to real
ize that you left your graphing calculator
and Burt's Bees back at point B. Students
are now scheduling in time to eat,
Facebook stalk and floss, and even with a
bike, it is often hard to get everywhere on
time.
Those who are not walking enthusiasts
are less inclined to love the extra lower
body workout. Shoes wear out quickly,
bikers are ruthless and shin splints are
painful. And for many, walking back to the
dorm at 2 a.m. armed with pepper spray
seems more necessary than neurotic.
Ultimately, however, it all comes down

to location, location, location. If one of the
bike-less is fortunate enough to live in
Florence Moore Hall, the walking distance
is significantly less than that of the resi
dents of. say. Governor's Corner, where
the average walker must carve a good 15
minutes to the main quad.
Austin Lyon *09 had a less-than-positive
experience while hike-less.
"My hike was stolen sophomore year."
he said. "It was already used and sprav
painted bright orange. One night I locked
it to itself, but not to a bike rack, and the
next morning 1 came out and it was gone."
Lyon was without his bike for three
months, from the end of sophomore year
until the beginning of junior year.
Like Bosley. he cited laziness as the rea
son for his prolonged time sans wheels.
"1 wanted to find a good bike at a good
price, but I didn't know where to look," he
said. "Plus, 1 was still looking for it. even
months after it was stolen. I was talking to
the police and hoping it would just show
up around campus."
It didn't.
In the meantime, Lyon chose to walk
and skateboard his way around campus

until, unfortunately.
he ended up with Xr
knee problems, w
Physical pain turned
out to be a necessary catalyst in the bike
buying process, and Lyon bought a bike a
few days later.
While biking is the most accepted and
time-efficient mode of transportation, not
all of the Stanford student body gets the
warm 'n fuzzies when they think of their
bikes.
Sandy Yuan "11 said she used to love
her bike until the day she looked behind
her while going downhill. Within a matter
of seconds, the situation went from fun and
games to nine-year-old versus concrete
mailbox.
"That day was not so fun," she said. "I'm
just not that great at riding my bike,
although I've definitely improved my ability
to control my bike in tricky situations. For
example, playing chicken is generally not a
good idea in high traffic. Freshmen especial
ly tend to not understand this life lesson
until they crash into each other. I definitely
have gotten in near accidents because peo
ple panic and start swerving wildly"

Bike safety is indeed an
issue on campus. Parking &
Transportation Services (P&TS)
recently hosted its 15th Bike Safety Class
and Bike Citation Diversion Class in tan
dem with Public Safety Over 600 students
to date have attended.
"The post-class survey results indicate
over 95 percent of the attendees have
learned something new. and rate the class
a high five on a one to five scale," said
Ariadne Delon Scott, the bicycle program
coordinator of P&TS.
Despite concerns of safety. Scott
reports that the majority of students
choose to go between classes on wheels.
"Parking and Transportation registered
an amazing 87 percent of this year's fresh
men," she noted.
Still, while it is true that the vast major
ity of students choose biking as their pre
ferred method of transportation, a lot can
be said for the occasional walk to class,
breaking in a new pair of shoes and having
the ultimate rieht-of-way.
