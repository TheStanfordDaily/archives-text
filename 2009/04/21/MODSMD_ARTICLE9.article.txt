## EDITORIAL CDC must become more accessible, accountable 
### 
One phenomenal resource that Stan
ford has is a dedicated Career Devel
opment Center (CDC), which has
both a physical, on-campus presence next to
the I laas ('enter, and a Web site available at
cdc.stanford.edu. Devoted to connecting
Stanford students with jobs and fellowships,
the Center maintains a repository of job list
ings and offers a range of career counseling
services.There are currently 2,858j0bs and in
ternships listed on both the Cardinal Careers
search engine and iNet, a posting site for in
ternships for Stanford and nine other peer in
stitutions. The resources that are in place are
great, but students are clamoring for an over
haul. I lie CDC must revamp its Website and
public outreach strategy to become more ac
cessible to students in these times of high un
employment and rare job offers.
I he Center itself is housed in a fairly at
tractive new building,but the arrangement is
haphazard — students entering the facility
often have trouble locating the reception
desk on the second floor — and it is woeful
ly understaffed. It is a great place to go to
read through hundreds of pages of volumi
nous binders, but it offers few immediate so
lutions.
I or the more tech-savvy, the Web site is
painfully Web 1.0. and lacks many modern
database and search features that have be
come übiquitous in the modern Internet.
While it does offer basic search functionali
ty. which is useful when looking for a very
specific job or internship, the amount of
noise present in the database makes it diffi
cult to find a variety of interesting jobs or in
ternships in one area.
In general, variety is hard to come bv.
both in the database and the binders at the

center. A large proportion of the jobs can be
lumped into the consulting sector, financial
services or engineering. Only 119 of the jobs
offered are even related to public service,
and given the heavy focus around campus on
public service this past year, those listings
should be expanded.
Another huge improvement the CDC
should consider concerns its outreach to stu
dents. Two brilliant services offered at the
center — resume hosting, in which any Stan
ford student's resume is quickly and easily
sent to any company, group or fellowship a
Stanford student wishes to apply to, and the
Letter of Recommendation Service, where
the CDC acts as a confidential third party,
storing reference letters from professors and
mentors for students to submit to a variety of
recipients — are woefully underused. These
services are widely desired by students, but
are poorly marketed. Even though many
students would love to take advantage of
these services, they are unaware of their
availability. The editorial board advises the
CDC to take a more active role in promoting
these services.
Finally, we would like to see more collab
orative input. Many Stanford students' in
terests are transitioning from consulting and
other finance-focused areas to other types of
jobs.and it would be great if there were a col
laborative process through which the CDC
could reflect students' evolving interests.
The CDC lacks a mechanism to gauge these
dynamic interests and update the job data
base accordingly. Overall, the CDC offers
many great services to students, but there are
numerous areas in which it could improve
greatly by becoming more accessible and ac
countable to students.
