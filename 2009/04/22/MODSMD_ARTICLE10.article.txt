## SPEAKERS & EVENTS Carter speaks on green justice Keynote for Greenfest 2009 links environment, social change 
### ELLEN DANFORD 
Environmental justice activist Majora
Carter spoke of the links between the poor,
economic troubles and environmentalism. and
called for the creation of renewable energy
jobs to anchor an economic recovery, in a
keynote speech for Greenfest 2009 last night
in Annenberg Auditorium.
"We were a community defined by crime,
poor education, everything negative." Carter
said of the South Bronx, where she founded
Sustainable South Bronx to improve the envi
ronmental factors in New York City. The
group also led to the establishment of the
Bronx Environmental Stewardship Training
(BEST), which creates green jobs for unem
ployed Bronx residents.
Carter and BEST were integral to intro
ducing smart roofs to the Bronx. Smart roofs
grow plants on top of houses to conserve
space, keep buildings cooler and utilize 75-95
percent of storm water.
"We're not saying green roofs are the be all
and end all — this reduces the amount of
storm water that has to be transferred by an
entirely inefficient sewage system." she said.
Carter also blamed the economy for social
problems in the Bronx.
"This is about race and class — this is what
the pollution based economy does to poor
people." she said. "Our current economy was
built on the backs of poor people."
However. Carter is optimistic about her
work and the work of Americans for the
future of an environmentally just nation, not
ing how "We've had enough of building all
sorts of ickv tributes to our failures."
She believes that now is the time to take a
step forward for renewable energy and creat
ing new jobs, especially under President
Obama. According to Carter. Obama is an
acronym for "Officially Behaving As
Magnificent Americans."
The event was coordinated by a unique col
laboration of Students for a Sustainable
Stanford. Students Taking on Poverty.
Students Promoting Ethnic and Cultural
Kinship. Energy Crossroads and the NAACP.
The collaboration of such different groups
came to the attention of many involved,
including Carter.
"I go to a lot of schools, and I have not seen
a coordinated group as diverse as the one who
organized this." she said.
"(Carter) brings a new energy." said Molly
Oshun 10. one of the organizers of Greenfest.
"Her speech and the collaboration of all these

different [organizing] groups give us more Ice
way to explore what we are excited about."
"We are hitting an era where everyone
wants a stake in the environmental issue."
added John Mulrow '09. president of Students
for a Sustainable Stanford. "We need to trans
form from our vision of sustainabilitv to
encompass all other viewpoints."
Many of the organizing members and stu
dents involved came to hear Carter speak on
her work with the environment and the lower
class.
"Majora's focus on environmental justice,
advocacy for the overlooked and the incorpo
ration of social values and equity into city
planning are. and will be. essential." said Drew
Bennett '09. president of Energy Crossroads.
In her speech. Carter covered many issues
important to Mulrow. Bennet and Mulfinger.
including the environment, social problems
and community problems.
Carter grew up in the South Bronx herself,
and its poverty and poor environment led her
to environmental justice.
Brvce Golden-Chen '09 left inspired by
Carter's message, and was hopeful for the
future.
"It is great to see that the power of a grass
roots organization is something that has
potential to effect change in the environ
ment." he said. "Also, we are beginning to see
with the new administration new legislation to
reach a solution."
