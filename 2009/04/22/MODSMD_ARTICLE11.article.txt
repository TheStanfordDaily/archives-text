## Senate debates forming committee on academics 
### ZOE RICHARDS STAFF WRITER 
With its term almost over, and the transi
tion to a new Senate beginning, the 10th
Undergraduate Senate debated at length a
bill proposed by Senators Stuart Baimel '09
and Luukas lives '09 to create a new com
mittee on academic issues and policy, remov
ing the education component of the Senate's
Student Life. Housing, Education (SLHE)
committee.
The Senate also passed two agenda items:
the ASSU Operations Budget for 2009-2010
and all of the funding bills for next fall.
According to lives, there is a need for the
ASSU to develop the institutional capacity
to directly address academic issues and hold
forums to discuss educational policy.
lives simultaneously suggested the need
for the Senate to increase its institutional
capacity and envisions the formation of a
separate educational issues committee that
would support Senate growth in terms of
fortifying the student voice in academic pol
icy and elsewhere.
"You need regularized oversight — I
would critique the Senate on its underdevel
oped oversight," he added.
The majority of senators in attendance
saw the need for some kind of changes in
regards to the committee. SLHE member
and Senator Zachary Johnson '10. who was
re-elected two weeks ago, explained the his
torical problems that SLHE has had in
addressing academic policy and other issues.
"No one really worked on educational
issues — there was no one really elected to
spearhead [academic concerns]," he said.
Senator Yvorn "Doc" Aswad-Thomas '11
agreed, stating the importance of establish
ing an education committee to hold individ
ual senators responsible for academic mat
ters.
"If you have a separate committee — you
cannot hide under SLHE." Aswad-Thomas
said.
The need for reform of SLHE seemed to
be one point of agreement for some old and
new senators alike. Senator-elect Varun
Sivaram 'II suggested that the timing of
such a reform, as the Senate transitions, is
right on target.
"Luukas points out that general struc
ture reform needs to occur — perhaps this
piece-meal approach is not the best."
Sivaram said. "The timing is very good, but
should be in the context of a bigger
reform."
I lowever, for some senators, the absence
of the ASSU from educational matters and
academic concerns was not reason enough
to form a new committee. Stephanie Epps.
speaking from her experience as
Appropriations Committee co-chair and
SLHE member, felt that the formation of a
sixth Senate committee was problematic.
"I alreadv think we have a committee

with the purview of educational issues,"
Epps said. "At this point, it is about
accountability on the part of the commit
tee."
Communications Chair Jonathan
McMaster '11 also questioned the feasibili
ty of separating the educational component
of SLHE and sectioning it off into its own
committee.
"It's going to spread the Senate too thin
— coming from someone who had a small
committee." McMaster said. "If there were
more people on Senate, it would be a great
idea."
Still, others questioned the efficiency of
having to pay an additional person to fill
the post. Eipps suggested that perhaps
instead of having a deputy chair, the Senate
should move to select a point person by
adding an academic policy chairman.
But the lack of manpower was not com
pelling enough for Baimel to back down
from his proposal. He emphasized the
importance of sending a message to the
administration that there are point people
who are responsible for academic issues
and who will actively lobby on behalf of the
student body in the form of an academic
policy committee.
"I don't think SLHE has worked very
well under policy coverage," Baimel said.
"[There is J no compelling reason to keep
SLHE as SLHE."
The bill will face continued discussion in
next week's Senate meeting.
Just as the Senate sees a host of new
faces ready to fill its seats, the ASSU
Operations Budget for next fall was set
with numerous changes and some cuts.
Some of the larger cuts include the
stipend for the Nominations Commission
(NomCom) chair; next year's chair, Phillip
Hon '10. will see his stipend decrease by 33
percent. The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) newsletter will also be slashed by 60
percent.
However, some items received more
money, as funds for equipment rental will
see a 50 percent budget increase, and the
Discretionary Programming for the GSC
will be bolstered with a 150 percent
increase from this year's budget, making
the cash pool for programs $25,000.
Christina Nguyen '10 will be replacing
Matt Sprague '10 in the capacity of Capital
Group coordinator, and Roxna Irani '10
will be funding coordinator for the ASSU.
Among his final duties as Executive
operations manager before he begins work
as ASSU Executive-elect, David Gobaud
'OK M.S. 10 is in the process of developing
a public release of a "Moral Standing and
Public Spending" memorandum to address
issues of corruption within the ASSU and
how to prevent such acts through increased
student government transparency.
