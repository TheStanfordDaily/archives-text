## EDITORIAL SRC cut hazardous to summer experience 
### 
On Monday. The Daily reported that
the program known as Summer Re
search College (SRC) will no longer
guarantee housing for undergraduates living
on campus while they conduct research over
the summer (see "Summer Research Col
lege cut"). In previous years. SRC housed
nearly 200 students in Manzanita and hired
dorm staff to handle academic and social
programming for participating researchers.
Students will no longer receive any sort of
preference in the summer Draw, and will be
placed in different dorms around campus.
Administrators cited the sharp drop in
the University's endowment and resulting
budget cuts as reasons for the change. Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education John
Hravman observed that the elimination of
the housing component of SRC would allow
Stanford to hand out approximately 15 more
summer research grants than the I Jniversity
would otherwise be able to afford.
The editorial board is concerned that the
elimination of SRC's residential program
ming is likely to have a negative impact on
the quality of students' experience. Accord
ing to the Undergraduate Academic Life
(IJAL) Web site, SR(' housing programming
"is ,i series of free events intended to enrich
undergraduates' summer research experi
ence." Until now. the housing component of
SR(' was integral to creating a sense of com
munity for those participating in the pro
gram. There is reason to believe that the ad
ministration's decision to cut this part of
SR( will preclude many of the friendships
that form and intellectual discussions that
take place in the comfort and safety of the
dorm.
It is also important to note that under
classmen. who constitute a large segment of
the SR(' population, are likely to suffer from
the elimination of consolidated housing. Ris
ing sophomores and juniors benefit most

from having a sense of community, particu
larly during the summer when many of their
friends are not on campus. Without a dorm
community to fall back on, the editorial
board is worried that some students will
have a hard time managing the non-SRC so
cial environment. The consequences of dis
persed housing will vary, of course, from per
son to person, but students may flounder
without dorm planning or events. SRC is
about much more than faculty-mentored re
search. and the social experience will be dif
ferent without the highlights of residential
programming.
As stated time and again, the edit board
understands that the University faces a seri
ous economic challenge and has to make dif
ficult decisions about how to pare down the
budget. While it is important to preserve as
many grants for undergraduate research as
possible, it is also crucial to consider the mis
sion of SRC as a whole â€” particularly the
ramifications that the elimination of student
housing will have on the summer research
experience. It may be that it is less beneficial
for the University to fund an additional 15
students if the overall SRC experience is
negative due to the loss of social cohesion.
Moreover, it appears that the administra
tion's decision to redirect SRC's residential
funding was made without student input. As
far as we know, the administration did not
discuss the changes with students who have
participated in the program in years past. As
with the implementation of Vaden health
service fees, changes to the housing draw and
changes to next year's drop deadline, the
Administration did not adequately survey
the greater student body before implement
ing a change that would greatly affect them,
and once again the editorial board is decry
ing the administration's apparent lack of
concern for student input. Hopefully they
will start listening soon.
