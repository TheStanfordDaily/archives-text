## The
						lazy college kid's guide to Earth Day 
### 
Okay, so the whole world is warming up
polar bears are drowning off their
melting icebergs, our kids will never
know w hat a glacier is and Florida is going to
largely disappear underwater. Hut these
huge issues beg the question: what am I.as an
open-minded but admittedly lazy college
kid. supposed to do about it?
Luckily, there are a lot of little ways that
we can change our habits without having to
chain ourselves to ancient redwoods or eat
granola for every meal. I lere's a list of sever
al easy things you can do this Earth Day to
make a little bit of difference — and if
enough of us get on board, we might just save
a lew polar bears along the way.
Turn your lights off when you're leaving a
room for more than 15 minutes
Most college dorms still use incandescent
light bulbs, which have not significantly ad
vanced technologically since they were in
vented 125 years ago (around the same time
as the telegraph and the steam locomotive).
If you don't want to install (T l . bulbs, which
are 75 percent more efficient than tradition
al incandescent bulbs), turn your lights off
when you're not going to be around. During
the day. use windows and natural lighting in
stead of electricity.
Your computer also uses an absurd
amount of energy, which you can cut down
on by setting your computer to go to sleep
automatically during short breaks. And as
sweet as those flying toasters might be, don't
use a screen saver — they use almost ten
times as much energy as a computer in sleep
mode. When you go to sleep, turn your com
puter off — it is an urban legend that turning
your computer on and oil repeatedly hurts
the machine.
Bring your own coffee mug
hi 2005. Americans used and discarded
14.4 billion disposable paper cups for hot
beverages. If put end-to-end, those cups
would circle the earth 55 times. Based on
anticipated growth ol specialty coffees,
that number will grow to 23 billion by 2010
enough to circle the globe KM times. Plus,
those coffee cups are lined with petro
chemicals in order to keep them from leak
ing. Based on hot cup usage in 2005, the
petrochemicals used in the manufacture ol
those cups could have heated H. 300 homes

for one year.
If you bring your own to-go mug, most
places will offer you a 15 or 25 cent discount.
Or save that embarrassingly exorbitant four
dollars you'd spend on a latte and just make
a drink at home before you go.
lake a shorter shower
Eivery four minutes in the shower, you use
up to 10 gallons of precious fresh water. Plus,
heating water accounts for up to 25 percent
of the total energy used in a single-family
home.That's more energy, on average, than is
needed to drive a medium-sized car 12,(KK)
miles.
Only do your laundry when you have a full load
It takes 40 gallons of water to do an av
erage load of laundry with a top-loading
washing machine, and Kb percent of energy
consumed by washing goes into heating the
water. How to cut down? Wash only your
really disgustingly dirty clothes in hot
water. Most clothes can safely be washed in
cold, and this alone could eliminate up to
1.600 pounds of yearly CO2 emissions in
the average household (just think about
how much more a dorm emits). As for the
dryer, the lint filter on your dryer can de
crease the energy used per load by up to 30
percent,so make sure to clean it before you
start a load.
Print double-sided or oil old scrap paper
I lere's the whirlwind of statistics:
Over 40 percent of the world wood har
vest ends up as paper. Last year, the United
States threw out 20 percent of all the paper
made in the world. One fifth of all the tropi
cal rainforests in the world disappeared be
tween 1%0 and 1990. It takes about 31 mil
lion BTUs to make a ton of paper — enough
energy to power a U.S. home for two months.
The average cost of a wasted piece of paper is
$.ob.
When you're buying printer paper, buy
recycled. Set your printer to print double
sided or feed it scrap paper that you don't
need anymore. And think twice about print
ing things — are you one of those compul
sive hi-lighter kids, or could you just read or
store it on your computer instead? Once
again, not too hard.
