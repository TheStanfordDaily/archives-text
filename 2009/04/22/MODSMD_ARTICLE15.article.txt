## Taxes are patriotic 
### 
During the Presidential campaign in the
fall, Vice-Presidential candidate Joe
Biden remarked in an interview that
Americans who earn more than $250,000
should expect to pay more in taxes. "It's time
to be patriotic," Mr. Biden said. "Time to jump
in.Time to be part of the deal.Time to help get
America out of the rut."
1 remember hearing that tidbit reported on
the radio one morning as I was waking up. 1
both cheered and cringed. I cheered because
someone was finally fighting back against the
right's mindless anti-tax fanaticism. 1 cringed
because 1 was afraid anti-tax sentiment in this
country was so strong that Biden and Obama
were going to get clobbered over the remark.
Of course, the Republican ticket wasted
no time in jumping on the statement. VP can
didate Sarah Palin said "Raising taxes is
about killing jobs and hurting small business
es and making things worse," seeming to for
get at that time exactly what was paying for
the body armor being used by her son in Iraq.
John McCain was even more blunt, saying
Biden's stance was "just plain dumb."
The strength and vehemence of the anti
tax forces in this country never cease to
amaze me. According to Douglas J. Amy, pro
fessor of politics at Mount Holyoke College
and creator of www.govemmentisgood.com.
there are over 800 anti-tax groups in the U.S.
Grover Norquist. the president of one of
the most powerful groups, Americans for Tax
Reform, became one of the chief architects of
President Bush's tax cuts. Norquist is notori
ous for his statement,"! don't want to abolish
government. I simply want to reduce it to the
size where I can drag it into the bathroom and
drown it in the bathtub."
And most recently, right-wing groups have
been staging "teabagging" protests against
taxes and government spending (though I
wonder where these folks were when George

W. Bush was adding $5 trillion to the national
debt).
Now, of course, no one likes paying taxes.
And it is certainly possible for taxes to get so
high that they choke off investment and
weaken the economy, leading to decreased
economic growth. But 1 believe that there are
two essential truths about taxes that the right
wing noise machine has sought to destroy.
First, while excessively high taxes across
the board may be a bad thing (and that's even
arguable), there is a wide range of tax rates
within which the economy can prosper. 1
don't have extensive studies to back this up,
but some anecdotal evidence is compelling.
First, during the Clinton years, the top mar
ginal federal tax rate (for those earning over
roughly $280,000) was 39.6 percent.The Bush
tax cuts lowered it to 35 percent, and also cut
capital gains taxes, which was mostly a boon
to the wealthy and ultra-wealthy.
And there's no doubt that the economy
was far stronger, at least for the average
American, during the Clinton years. During
Clinton's two terms, the U.S. economy added
over 22 million new jobs, while during
Dubya's days the total is a paltry 1.9 million.
Of course, there were a multitude of factors
that went into these numbers, but clearly the
significantly higher taxes of the Clinton years
did not destroy our economy.
And here's a fact that might surprise you:
During the incredibly prosperous boom of
the 1950s and early 19605, the top marginal
tax rate was 91 percent (on incomes of over
$400,000).
The second truth about taxes is perhaps
even more fundamental. You cannot run a
complex, modern society with 300 million di
verse citizens without a strong, well-organ
i/ed government. And that government runs
on taxes. George Lakoff, a linguistics profes
sor at UC-Berkeley who writes extensively

on politics, puts it best:
"Taxes are our dues — we pay our dues to
be Americans and enjoy the benefits of
American society." he said. "Taxes are what
we pay to live in a civilized society that is dem
ocratic, offers opportunity and has a huge in
frastructure available to all citizens. This in
credible infrastructure has been paid for by
previous taxpayers. Roads and highways, the
Internet, the broadcast airwaves, our public
education system, our power grid — every
day we all use this vast infrastructure. Our
dues maintain it."
And Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wen
dell Holmes. Jr. put it even more eloquently:
"I like to pay taxes. With them I buy civiliza
tion."
Even if. unlike Holmes, you don't enjoy
sending your hard-earned money to the gov
ernment, remember that it would be impossi
ble for you to have your job as a teacher,
lawyer, investment banker, doctor, etc. if we
did not live in a stable and prosperous socie
ty, whose stability and prosperity is paid for by
our taxes.
I'm not arguing that taxes should by de
fault always be high. I believe they should be
as low as possible while still paying for the in
stitutions that keep our society just, fair and
functioning.
In short, wanting to enjoy the benefits of
American society without paying taxes is like
wanting to enjoy privileges at a country club
without paying dues. In the old days, people
with that penchant were called freeloaders.
Today, they're called conservatives.
