## My pal Al 
### 
Few things in life explain a person more
than the way he or she was raised, and
who did the raising. So whenever a per
son asks me about how I became the neurotic,
distrustful, kick-a-hobo-when-he's-down kind
of human being that I am. I tell them the fol
lowing story.
When I was six. 1 got a loose tooth. As chil
dren are to do in such situations, 1 became ter
ribly excited. My celebration was not unwar
ranted; our tooth fairy, Clarissa, was among the
greatest to ever live. She would consistently
give us $1.50 and a beautiful, if disgustingly
sappy, poem on a handwritten letter (with
handwriting that looked slightly like my father,
Reuben's). She delivered on time, every time.
That evening, when my father came home
from work. I announced the exciting news,and
his eyes lit up "Oh!" he exclaimed. Then. sud
denly his expression completely changed to
one of utter sadness He stepped back. "Oh."
he said once more, this time in a hushed tone.
"What?" I asked him quizzically."What did
that second 'Oh' mean?"
"I don't really know how to say this." my fa
ther began. He stopped. Then, regaining
strength, he said,"Clarissa had an accident."
"An accident?"
My father turned away, and then faced me
again. He explained that Clarissa had tragical
ly slipped and fallen off a cliff, at the very least
severely maiming her wings, and at worst â€”
well, the doctors said she might not make it.
One thing was for sure, though: we wouldn't be
seeing Clarissa anytime soon.
My world was collapsing around me. and
my mind exploded with questions. Why the
hell had she been hanging around a cliff.' Who
in the world was this child who was sleeping
there? And once Clarissa fell off the cliff, well,
why didn't she just use her wings to fly back on
the cliff? But I stayed silent, as I knew my fa
ther would have no answers. I remember,
though, that he seemed to be hiding a smile. I
did not know why
Eventually, I asked."Well, will 1 still get my
money?"
"Don't worry.'mv father answered,"l'm al

ready interviewing new candidates. I promise
you that by the time you lose your tooth, we'll
have a new tooth fairy, and she'll be every bit as
good as Clarissa."
I wanted to trust my father, but then again,
this was the same person who had hired a tooth
fairy who had just fallen off a cliff.
A few days later, I lost my tooth. When my
father got home that night. I showed him my
new smile. He responded with a grin of his
own. and he told me exactly what I longed to
hear.
"That's great news. Mark! Because guess
what? Just today. I hired our new tooth fairy!"
My eyes widened. "What's her name?" I
asked, heart beating wildly.
My father's smile grew. "Al."
I stared, waiting. "Al what? What's the rest
of her name?"
He gave me a look of surprise. Dad chuck
led. "No. Mark. Al.That's liis name."
"AL???!!! You got me a male tooth fairy
named AL?"
My dad interrupted. "No, you have to un
derstand! He's just great. He's specifically
promised me in the contract that he'll always
deliver on time and give even sweeter letters
than Clarissa ever did. He'll be the best tooth
fairy in the world."
As my father's smile dramatically vanished,
he said in a hushed tone."Mark, you've got to
trust me."
1 sighed. Kver the good son, I told him I did.
1 woke up early the next morning and. re
membering that I was expecting some mad
cheddar under my pillow, scrambled out of
bed, tore the bed sheets away, removed the pil
low, and there, right on my bed. lay.. my
tooth.
In a fury. I raced downstairs to interrogate
my father. Put immediately on the defensive,
my dad insisted he had told Al about the tooth,
and that he was in no way to blame for the niis
communication. Besides, he was sure that Al
would show up some time soon.
The process repeated no less than ten days.
I could not believe it. My tooth literally began
rotting in my bed. Already Al was becoming

the worst tooth fairy I could have ever imag
ined.
By the eleventh day. I had just about given
up all hope. So imagine my surprise when that
morning,as I removed the pillow, in my tooth's
place lay a brilliant $20 bill I couldn't believe
it. Perhaps. 1 thought. I had gotten A 1 all wrong.
Alas, next to the $21) bill lay a letter,reminis
cent of those Clarissa would give before her
tragic plight. Frantically, I tore it open,eager to
read a Clarissa-like sappy poem that would
make me feel as if losing a tooth were some
how a great accomplishment.
I looked at the front."you're pal al!" it said,
all in lower-case letters. The "a in "al" was
backwards. The handwriting looked slightly
like my father's. Contused. I read on. not real
izing 1 was in for the most unwelcome surprise
of my young life:
"Dearly mark, congratulation off lossing
you're toof! unfortunate, could not find
change, you owe me $19.50! accepting cash or
check!"Then,scribbled at the bottom,"you're
pal al." A picture of a toothy grin accompanied
the sign-off. It looked as if it had been drawn by
a three year-old. Once more, the "a" in Al was
backwardv
1 raced downstairs again, head pounding.
When I told my father what had happened that
morning, he unexpectedly let out a laugh
"Well," he chuckled,"l guess you gotta pay
him!" Shocked, 1 explained I did not have a
checkbook. My dad was shaking, he was laugh
ing so hard. "Well, isn't that a shame!" Tears
began streaming down his face from laughter.
And with that, tears began to stream down
mine as well, back, that was the mo
ment I began to lose trust not only in hu
mankind. but in fairy-kind as well.
That, my friends, was my childhood in a nut
shell. So if you don't like me. don't blame me
for who 1 am. Blame Al.
