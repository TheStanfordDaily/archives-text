### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
Altera beautiful weekend for golf at Stan
ford. the No. 4 Stanford men's team took
fourth at its own U.S. Intercollegiate tourna
ment this past weekend.The Cardinal held its
own. posting an 11-under 829 for the tourna
ment: however, it was not enough to over
come No. 5 Washington, which posted an un
stoppable 36-under 804 for the tournament.
"There were a lot of positives from the
week." said Stanford coach Conrad Ray. "We
had another solid showing and a fairly solid
team score. We couldve played better, but
that's just the way it went."
Just behind the fiery I luskv squad was last
year's title-holder. No. 3 Southern California,
checking in with a 21-under-par SIM. No. 16
Arizona State pulled its weight as well, post
ing a 16-under 824. just five strokes in front of
the home team.
Washington painted itself as a threat for
next week's Pacific-10 Conference Champi
onship after this week's breakthrough at the
Farm. Not only did the Huskies take the
crown from USC. but they also took all three
of the top individual rankings. No. 12 junior
Nick Taylor took the No. 1 pri/e with a 12-
under 198, followed by fellow junior Darren
Wallace with an 11-under and sophomoreTze
Huang Choo with a 10-under for the tourna
ment.
Though the I luskies posted a noteworthy
showing, the Cardinal golfers did what they
could to bridge the gap and come back.
"The team was pretty disappointed with
our finish this weekend, especially given the
advantage we have of playing the course all
the time." said senior captain Dodge Kem
mer."l lowever. there were a couple positives
to take from the week: We had a good team
first round, and [sophomore] Steve [Ziegler]
continued to play well,and wc ended up with
another top-five finish."
No. 9 Ziegler tore up the course for the
Cardinal,posting three-under-par rounds and
an eagle to put him in a tie for fourth on the
individual ladder.This marks Ziegler's fourth
top-10 finish for all four spring-season tour
naments. Ziegler fired a 68 and 66. respective
ly. for the first two days of the tournament to
put him in third. Unfortunately, his final 68-
stroke round was not enough to overcome
the Washington trinity at the top of the ranks.
"Since Jan. 1. Steve has been arguably one
of the hottest players in college golf." Ray

This week was interesting to watch him com
pete because he had to deal with some adver
