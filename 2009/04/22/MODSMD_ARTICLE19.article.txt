### JEFF LU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
ITie Stanford men's rowing team was
narrowly deprived of a perfect weekend on
Sunday, after defending national champion
Wisconsin edged the Cardinal varsity eight
hv a mere .32 seconds to claim victory at the
final event of the Stanford Invitational.
Hosted by Stanford over the course of
three days, the Stanford Invitational saw
the No. 5 Cardinal up against several of the
nation's finest crews, including No. 3 Wash
ington and No. 2 Wisconsin. Friday and Sat
urday proved to be an auspicious prelude
to Sunday's match as the Cardinal varsity
eight upset Washington by a full 4.50 sec
onds and cruised to a flawless victory
against No. 13 Oregon State.
"The racing was very good." said Stan
ford freshman coach Peter Giese. "We are
pleased with the performance of all our

boats today."
However, toppling the previous cham
pions and the current No. 2 Badgers proved

"Our crew team was in top condition
today." said Stanford head coach Craig
Amerkhanian."'The match was as close to a
dead heat as possible with just IS inches of
separation. Racing the defending national
champions to a photo finish was tremen
dous to our team morale and vision."
Amerkhanian also added that the race
against Wisconsin was the equivalent of a
mid-term examination for the Stanford
varsity eight, of which the Cardinal rowers
scored with visible improvement.
Not all news was ol defeat, however. Al

"Our crew team
was in top
condition today."
though tlie second varsity eight also fell
short against their opponents, clocking
5:59:07 to the Badgers' 5:48:57, Stanford's
novice eight fared better than their senior
counterparts. Pulling ahead at the finish,
the freshman boat raced to a 2.04-second
victory over Wisconsin.
The freshman crew, which posted a time
of 5:57:12 against Wisconsin, had previous-
