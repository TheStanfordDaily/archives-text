## Crew almost beats champs Cardinal rowers lose to Wisconsin by .32 seconds 
### JEFF LU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
ITie Stanford men's rowing team was
narrowly deprived of a perfect weekend on
Sunday, after defending national champion
Wisconsin edged the Cardinal varsity eight
hv a mere .32 seconds to claim victory at the
final event of the Stanford Invitational.
Hosted by Stanford over the course of
three days, the Stanford Invitational saw
the No. 5 Cardinal up against several of the
nation's finest crews, including No. 3 Wash
ington and No. 2 Wisconsin. Friday and Sat
urday proved to be an auspicious prelude
to Sunday's match as the Cardinal varsity
eight upset Washington by a full 4.50 sec
onds and cruised to a flawless victory
against No. 13 Oregon State.
"The racing was very good." said Stan
ford freshman coach Peter Giese. "We are
pleased with the performance of all our

boats today."
However, toppling the previous cham
pions and the current No. 2 Badgers proved
too difficult a task for the Cardinal rowers,
who found themselves deprived of a victo
ry by a single seal-length. Both crews
stayed within three seat-lengths of each
other throughout the entire race, but Wis
consin pulled ahead right at the line to
clock 5:3K:3N. .32 seconds ahead of Stan
ford's 5:38:70.
Despite what appeared to be a tough
loss to swallow, both the Stanford varsity
eight and their coach seemed pleased with
the results.
"Our crew team was in top condition
today." said Stanford head coach Craig
Amerkhanian."'The match was as close to a
dead heat as possible with just IS inches of
separation. Racing the defending national
champions to a photo finish was tremen
dous to our team morale and vision."
Amerkhanian also added that the race
against Wisconsin was the equivalent of a
mid-term examination for the Stanford
varsity eight, of which the Cardinal rowers
scored with visible improvement.
Not all news was ol defeat, however. Al

"Our crew team
was in top
condition today."
though tlie second varsity eight also fell
short against their opponents, clocking
5:59:07 to the Badgers' 5:48:57, Stanford's
novice eight fared better than their senior
counterparts. Pulling ahead at the finish,
the freshman boat raced to a 2.04-second
victory over Wisconsin.
The freshman crew, which posted a time
of 5:57:12 against Wisconsin, had previous-
ly claimed a comfortable win over
Washington hut had been unable to
replicate the varsity eight's success
on Friday against Washington. The
30.44-second loss against the
Huskies was one of the worst suf
fered by the novice eight this season.
"Our guys put in a strong effort,"
Giese said. "But in the end. Wash
ington's power and international ex
perience was too much."
The Cardinal will have to hope
that the victory over Wisconsin will
bolster the novice eight's confi
dence as it prepares for the Big
Row next Saturday, where it faces
Cal's top-ranked crews. The Gold
en Bears recently claimed three of
four grand finals at the San Diego
Crew Classic and posted a time of
5:42 to best Oregon State, UC-
Davis and Santa Clara University
at Redwood Shores Lagoon. In
their last encounter, the C'al rowers
dominated Stanford, the varsity,
second varsity and novice crews,
outpacing their Stanford counter
parts by 4.54. 23.80 and 14.24 sec
onds, respectively.
Amerkhanian hopes that diligent
training will help his rowers bridge
the gap against the Golden Bears.
"The crew team is learning from
last weekend's race and taking ad
vantage of their strengths to develop
their speed," he said.
With last weekend's performanc
es against Washington and Wiscon
sin. the Stanford crew team has
proven itself above the confinement
of its No. 5 ranking. With any luck,
the Cardinal rowers will work a little
of the same magic when they face
Cal this Saturday.
