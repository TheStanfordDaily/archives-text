# NBA needs to change playoffs
## 
### 
Is there anything more anti-cli
mactic in sports then the NBA
Playoffs?
Alter an 82-game, six-month sea
son. the NBA — in a scheme that I
am guessing is intended to increase
revenue — turns the playoffs into
another half of a season, removing
the excitement that used to captivate
basketball fans.
ITiis school year at Stanford will
be over before the NBA Playoffs are.
The playoffs last three months and a
team can be forced to play as many as
28 games (often with two days oft be
tween games) in order to win a title.
It is a layered problem, however.
The beginning of the issue is that
more than half of the league makes
the playoffs. This devalues the regu
lar season. Does a team like the De
troit Pistons, who finished 39-43, re
ally deserve a playoff bid? The result
is inevitable: they will be stomped on
by the Cleveland Leßrons — I mean
Cavaliers.
The next issue is that the first
round, which is often a foregone con
clusion, is now a seven-game series as
opposed to a five-game series. This
removes any drama — like the
eighth-seeded Knicks upsetting the
first-seeded Heat on Allan Hous
ton's runner in the lane in 1999
that may occur in the first round. Yes
the Warriors upset the Mavericks
few years back, but that was quite an
anomaly of a situation.
Compare basketball to baseball,
for example. Not only do only four
baseball teams in each league make
the playoffs — giving merit to regu
lar-season results — but the first
round of the MLB Playoffs is a five
game series. This means despite the
shorter regular season (the MLB
regular season is 162 games), the
NBA plays far more playoff games.
This allows for the league and
teams to create revenue from each
playoff game, while also extending
the time the sport is in the public's
eye/Ibis is a defensible tactic so long
as it doesn't subtract from the emo
tion of the sport, which I would argue
it does.
Some might argue that the ex
tended playoffs are fine because they
make it more likely that the best
teams advance to the later rounds.
That is a fair argument. However, if
the NBA wants to garner the fan in
terest it did back when Michael Jor
dan was tearing through the postsea
son, it might want to shorten the time
between games.
The playoffs drag on for three
months because games are never
played on back-to-back days, and
teams are often given two days oil to
travel.
Compare that to the NHL. I lock
ey is a far more physically demand
ing sport; however. Nil I players
must play every other day and some
times every day come playoff time.
This quick turnaround allows fans
to stay engaged in a series, instead of
feeling a lull between games. (The
NHL Playoffs' unpopularity stems
from a far different reason, partially
because hockey is not an American
sport and partially because of the
locked-out season a few years ago.)
Think about the excitement of the
NCAA Basketball Tournament. The
NBA Playoffs are the complete op
posite of that.

During March Madness, there
are games all the time and each
game is do-or-die. Ilie emotions on
the court are tangible through the
television screen.
In the NBA Playoffs,star players
get rested and do not necessarily
exert their full effort every night be
cause the NBA Playoffs are a
marathon, not a sprint. I don't know
about you. but I'd rather watch a
sprint.
I will watch the NBA Playoffs,
however reluctant I may be. I still
will choose to watch any baseball
game or an Nl 11. playoff game first.
Wake me up when it's the NBA Fi
nals— maybe then I'll start paying
mv full attention.
