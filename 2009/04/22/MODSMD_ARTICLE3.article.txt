# Draw opens today
## Students voice concerns, how they will handle new changes 
### ESPERANZA GUEVARA 
The Draw opens for registration today,
and students across campus are weighing
their options and planning how they will
enter into the significantly changed system.
This year, students will enter the Draw by
selecting one of three tiers to opt into, rank
ing the 76 options for on-campus housing
next year, and entering the names of their
Draw group members into the system. The
new Draw will assign them a number and a
house based on availability in the residences
and the group's rankings, but unlike in past
years, these numbers and historical cut-off
numbers will not be published before the
Draw.
The new draw changes worry some stu
dents. like Jaime Cornejo '11. who will be a
manager in Bob next year.
"I'm worried because of the division I
feel that is going to be created. I'm worried

that the Row houses are going to be mostly
upperclassmen ... 1 believe that different
classes add diversity."
Freshmen, who have not been through
the process before, are not bothered by the
new Draw system.
"Seems to me like it's a pretty fair
change." said Frank I.i "12. "It affects every
one pretty much equally."
As part of the new housing system next
year, there will be more all-freshman dorms
on campus. This new organization bothered
those who enjoy the four-class dorm
arrangement.
"(Freshmen) usually have questions
about different majors, and I feel like upper
classmen are the best resource for them to
use." Cornejo said. "That's why I've always
liked living in four-class house dorms."
In what used to be a complex strategic
undertaking, this year's Draw strategies are
limited to which tier to use and how to rank

the houses on the online registration. All
students have to do this year is to carefully
prioritize their housing options, and then
wait.
"The advantageous way [to get good
housing] is to draw into a house that has a
lot of singles, like Lagunita." said Elizabeth
Haro 11.
Many who plan on studying abroad take
that fact into consideration when deciding
which tier to draw into.
"I'm not sure whether I'm going abroad
next year, and that's going to determine
what tier I use." Haro said. "I feel like if I'm
going abroad. 1 should use Tier Three."
Upperclassmen who have not used all
their preferred years have the Tier One
option, which gives them access to the best
housing on campus.
Having used only one preferred year.
