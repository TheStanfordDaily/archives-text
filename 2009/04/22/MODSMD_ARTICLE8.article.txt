## Row fixes still not complete Renovations put on hold due to budget cuts 
### JULIE KLEIN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This year, a lucky group of students
moved into Xanadu at the start of win
ter quarter. The Row house, always
popular because of its central location
and social atmosphere, became even
more desirable after receiving a com
plete renovation.
Bob. another Row house, was origi
nally scheduled for a similar renovation
this summer. However, like many
building projects across campus, future
Row house renovations will be delayed
due to University-wide budget cuts.
Bob is scheduled for renovation as
part of the Capital Improvement
Program (CIP). The University now
expects the building project to begin in
summer 2011, according to Rodger
Whitney, executive director of Student
I lousing.
The subsequent renovations of Casa
Italiana and Storey — which were
scheduled to take place after the reno
vation of Bob — w ill now begin in sum
mer 2012 and summer 2013. respective
ly. In the meantime. Whitney assured
students that all houses are "definitely
safe and functional."
"We do not anticipate any problems
affecting students before we begin the
full CIP renovation." Whitney said.
Row house renovations, as part of
the (TP. have taken place over the past
several summers. Xanadu received a
full renovation during the past summer
and fall, while Roth. Durand.
Columbae and 717 Dolores underwent
similar renovations in the preceding
years.
The began 18 years ago after
Student Housing studied the mainte
nance and upgrade needs of all resi
dences. Since then. 42 percent of Row
houses have undergone renovations.
Bob. Casa Italiana and Storey are the
remaining three. Whitney emphasized
that Student Housing does not distin
guish Row houses from other resi
dences when considering CIP renova
tions.
When asked what criteria Student
Housing uses for determining the need
for maintenance and renovations.
Whitney acknowledged the importance
of both aesthetics and safetv.
"We aim to create a 'just like
home' setting." Whitney said. "How
ever. Student Housing's primary re
sponsibility remains the health and
safety of our residents, so life safety
issues are the primary criteria for de
termining the order and scope of the
projects."
While the renovations differ be
tween houses, the building projects
often include seismic upgrades, life
safety upgrades, new kitchens, refur
bished bathrooms, new landscaping
and furniture improvements.
Whitney explained that Student
Housing works with house staff and
residents during CI I' planning stages.
Maria Du/on '09. house manager for
Storey, attended such a planning
meeting at her house last year.
"We had a lot of opinions," Du/on
said.regarding residents' suggestions
for the upcoming renovation.
According to Du/.on. residents
said they would like to see increased
lounge space, better furniture and
picnic tables, among other improve
ments. While the overall renovation
will not take place for several years
now. the request for new picnic tables
was recently granted.
Whitney also said that house
managers "would have been noti
fied" of the renovation delays once
this decision was made, but the three
house managers interviewed said
they knew little information regard
ing the projects.
Sini Matikainen 1)9, house man
ager for Casa Italiana. said she had
heard "nothing official from Hous
ing" with regard to renovations — or
delays in renovations — of the
house.
Isheta Salgaocar '09. house man
ager for Bob, casually learned of the
delay in Bob's renovation while at a
meeting for prospective house man
agers this winter. Salgaocar received
an official email in the fall informing
her of Bob's impending renovation,
but she did not receive similar notifi
cation about the delay.
When asked if renovation delays
would have an effect on the desir
ability of these houses, Matikainen
emphasized Casa Italiana's overall
appeal.
"The house has a definite '70s Hair
that could stand to be updated, the
brown shag carpets especially." she

said."But everything's still in reason
ably good condition."
"With C'asa's fantastic location
and food." she added, "there's no
question of filling the house."
Salgaocar was a bit less optimistic
about Bob's delay.
"We really need one," she said,
though she acknowledged that the
delay is "not a huge deal. It's not like
our house is falling apart — at least
not yet."
Bob and Casa Italiana were both
built in the 19705. Storey was reno
vated in the 1980s after a fire, making
it less in need of renovation than the
other two.
CIP projects are debt-funded as
part of the University's Capital Plan.
Housing, Capital Planning staff and
Residential and Dining Enterprises
made the decision to postpone Row
house renovations as part of a Uni
versity-wide effort to meet budget
reduction targets.
The University will continue with
what it considers to be the most im
portant Housing improvement proj
ects this summer. The only Row ren
ovation included is the Grove May
field kitchen. A renovation of the
Haus Mitt kitchen, which was also
scheduled for this summer, has been
delayed and has not yet been
rescheduled.
In the meantime, housing inspec
tions will continue as always. Accord
ing to Whitney, Student Housing is
"actively inspecting" houses on a
near-daily basis, and Santa Clara
County inspections — which could
include fire marshal or public health
inspections — take place seasonally.
While a new schedule is tentative
ly set for renovations of Bob. Casa
Italiana and Storey. Whitney empha
sized that such plans could be altered
yet again.
"This schedule is re-evaluated
regularly." he said, "and could change
again in the future."
