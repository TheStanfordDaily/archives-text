## Back to his humble beginnings Emanuel Pleitez'05 runs for Congress in hometown 
### DANA SHERNE 
If you drive cast of the bustle of Los
Angeles and stay south of the wealth of
Pasadena, you might he struck by a
marked change in scenery. Some of the
windows of the small houses you will
pass have bars on them, a slight improvement
from those windows that are boarded up.
Chain link fences surround many of the build
ings. but these are no barrier to the street
artists who have covered the walls in graffiti.
For the residents of East Los Angeles. El
Monte. Monterey Park and West Covina. the
economic plight of California's 32nd congres
sional district is a testament to the need for an
administrative change. For Emanuel Pleitez
'05, an East-L.A. native, rebuilding the 32nd
district is an issue close to his heart.
Born in El Sereno. in the heart of his elec
toral district. Pleitez experienced firsthand the
conditions he is now pledging to improve. He
lived in the rundown neighborhoods, attended
the same crumbling schools that are still in
desperate need of funding and faced the same
socioeconomic challenges that continue to
plague the district's residents.
Pleitez concedes that fixing the laundry list
of problems won't be easy, but starting with
the May 19 congressional primary, he is opti
mistic that his youth and hometown roots are
just what is needed to improve the place he
calls home.

Pleitez lived the quintessential rags-to-rich
es story. He grew up in poverty, only to end up
amassing a fair share of wealth while working
for Goldman Sachs. I le also knows all too well
the disparities of the education system, having
been in under-funded East L. A. public schools

before going on to Stanford.
Pleitez does not struggle to reconcile these
differences. Instead, he thinks he can use his
range of experience to show others that they
can improve their lives and find the same
opportunities he had.
"I came from a very poor background in
East Los Angeles — a very poor area," he
said. "For me. to be able to get an education at
Stanford ... to be able to get to the top institu
tions like Goldman Sachs — well, if I am not
doing every day what I can be doing to help
other people, then 1 don't deserve these
opportunities,"
Raised by a single mother in a struggling
household. Pleitez passed through under
funded public schools like Woodrow Wilson
1 ligh School and eventually became the first in
his family to go to college.
As a Stanford student, Pleitez fostered his
political interests, taking time off to work for
such local campaigns as Los Angeles Mayor
Antonio Villaraigosa's mayoral bid, and
national campaigns like that of Senator John
Kern for President.
After graduating from Stanford, Pleitez
worked as a financial analyst for Goldman
Sachs. In November 2(X)K. he started working
for the Obama-Biden transition as part of the
U.S. Treasury Department Agency review
team.
All that, and he's only 26 years old.
Now, Pleitez is campaigning for the primary
election on May 19 in the California 32nd dis
trict. his most ambitious project to date.
He's quick to emphasize, however, that his
experiences in both the financial sector and
political world are not the most important
things in differentiating him from the other 11
candidates running.
"What's most important is that I actually

grew up in this district, and that 1 actually
understand the issues for the district, and not
necessarily my resume." Pleitez said slowly,
making every word ring clear.
Tlie district, he knows, is concerned with
education and the economy. When Pleitez
talked about his priorities, these two goals
reinforced each other. He wants to help work
toward a country where, in his words, "people
can move up that ladder and be successful, no
matter what their economic background."
It is clear in talking to Pleitez that he
believes such goals, while perhaps idealistic,
are reachable. 1 low could he not. when they
have been the defining features of his life?
"I want to incorporate [into politics] the
core belief that every single person that you
speak with has leadership ability, has some
thing of value to add in society." Pleitez said. "If
you're a leader, you're able to bring that out
and be a leader and organize other people."
His voice sped up as the conversation
turned to his clear passion for real leadership.
"You need to allow everyone to be a
leader, to have responsibility, to want to grow."
he said. "Everyone I meet has so much poten
tial to be unlocked.and if I'm a leader. I'm try
ing to bring that out. And in the end. that cre
ates an organization that is great because of
the people."
"And that bleeds into. I think, a society or a
city or a state or a county." he continued, echo
ing the same pragmatic brand of idealism that
brought Barack Obama to prominence.
Prominence, however, is the last thing on
Pleitez's mind.
"Being a congressman where I grew up —
I think that's the ultimate kind of dedication to
service." he explained.
This commitment to service is something
he is eager to apply to his community; he sees

himself as the only candidate with enough
financial background to deal with the financial
crisis. His youth, too. according to Pleitez. will
make him an effective Congressman.
"[l'm part of] the Facebook Age. where
we're a little more open-minded, where com
municating with someone from another coun
try isn't that big a deal because we can do it so
easily, because we can exchange ideas with
someone in a much more fluid manner." he
noted. "I think I'll be able to represent that in
Congress — that new generation, that new
way of thinking, while still understanding the
nuts and bolts."
But can he get to that point? Pleitez is con
sidered to be the third most likely Democratic
candidate in the race right now. trailing state
senator Gil Cedillo and Judy Chu. a member
of the state's Board of Equalization.
Despite the competition, he thinks he can
garner the candidacy.
"To voters, it's that I grew up there." Pleitez
said. "To people in the financial sector, it's that
I have the experience to understand what's
really going on. To my fellow Democrats, it's
that I represent Democratic ideas and that I'm
a fresh face."
"To me, it's more that I'm committed to
service, and I really care about these commu

nities," he continued, "and I'll he able to put
these experiences together to be the best rep
resentative for this district."
On May 19, we'll see if voters feel the same
way.

"I want to incorporate [into politics] the
core belief that every single person that you
speak with has leadership ability, has some
thing of value to add in society." Pleitez said. "If
you're a leader, you're able to bring that out
and be a leader and organize other people."
His voice sped up as the conversation
turned to his clear passion for real leadership.
"You need to allow everyone to be a
leader, to have responsibility, to want to grow."
he said. "Everyone I meet has so much poten
tial to be unlocked.and if I'm a leader. I'm try
ing to bring that out. And in the end. that cre
ates an organization that is great because of
the people."
"And that bleeds into. I think, a society or a
city or a state or a county." he continued, echo
ing the same pragmatic brand of idealism that
brought Barack Obama to prominence.
Prominence, however, is the last thing on
Pleitez's mind.
"Being a congressman where I grew up —
I think that's the ultimate kind of dedication to
service." he explained.
This commitment to service is something
he is eager to apply to his community; he sees

himself as the only candidate with enough
financial background to deal with the financial
crisis. His youth, too. according to Pleitez. will
make him an effective Congressman.
"[l'm part of] the Facebook Age. where
we're a little more open-minded, where com
municating with someone from another coun
try isn't that big a deal because we can do it so
easily, because we can exchange ideas with
someone in a much more fluid manner." he
noted. "I think I'll be able to represent that in
Congress — that new generation, that new
way of thinking, while still understanding the
nuts and bolts."
But can he get to that point? Pleitez is con
sidered to be the third most likely Democratic
candidate in the race right now. trailing state
senator Gil Cedillo and Judy Chu. a member
of the state's Board of Equalization.
Despite the competition, he thinks he can
garner the candidacy.
"To voters, it's that I grew up there." Pleitez
said. "To people in the financial sector, it's that
I have the experience to understand what's
really going on. To my fellow Democrats, it's
that I represent Democratic ideas and that I'm
a fresh face."
"To me, it's more that I'm committed to
service, and I really care about these commu

nities," he continued, "and I'll he able to put
these experiences together to be the best rep
resentative for this district."
On May 19, we'll see if voters feel the same
way.
