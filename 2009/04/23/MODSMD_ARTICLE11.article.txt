## EDITORIAL Art Affair provides great outlet for creativity 
### 
Artists of all stripes came out of the
woodwork this weekend and
brought a refreshing new vibe to
White Pla/a. An Art Affair is the kind of
event the editorial board wishes we as a cam
pus could enjov more often, especially in
these pre-summer months of sunshine and
glory.
Students and visitors, who would normal
ly dart across the plaza as quickly as possible,
slowed down to see their peers strum blue
grass.dance bangra,perform in short theatri
cal pieces and just express themselves artis
tically. Submissions from all over campus
representing students of various fields and
studies — decorated the otherwise stark
plaza. It was just about as tranquil and artsy
as it gets around these parts lately, and the
reaction from the student body was genuine
ly enthusiastic. And then, on Monday, the
tents went down and all was quiet on the cre
ative front once again.The editorial board is
in mourning.
We would like to see regular displays the
likes of Art Affair, accepting open submis
sions from average students who call their
incredible talents "just a hobby" — for more
than just three days a year. The editorial
board is dismayed to note that the Art Affair
is the only "Arts and Music" event listed on
the ASSIJ Student Events calendar for the
entire school year, indicating a clear lack of
outlets for students who are not art majors to
display their work or participate in a visible

artistic community. These gifted individuals
should be able to share their gifts with the
campus to the same degree that athletes,
thespians or academic club participants are
able to present their talents to the Stanford
community.
The Stanford Organizing Committee for
the Arts' (SOCA) tireless efforts to make
the three-day exhibit truly an affair — with
free food. CDs and professional equipment
undoubtedly contributed to the large
crowds that gathered on the plaza. The edi
torial board believes that, with the demon
strated art enthusiasm shown this weekend
at Art Affair.Stanford should sustain a more
permanent creative works display in the
plaza, led by the SOCA and other student art
groups.
What SOCA's An Art Affair proved was
that there is a great untapped wealth of tal
ent on campus that goes overlooked by the
Princeton Review and other guides which
tend to concentrate primarily on our
school's techie prowess and pre-professional
rigor. But there is more to Stanford than
what can be found in research labs and lec
ture halls. We are also a campus of poets,
painters, sculptors, actors, dancers and cre
ative voices, and we should embrace this side
of our selves as enthusiastically as we em
brace the other. A longer and more perma
nent installation of creative student submis
sions in White Plaza would be a great place
to begin.
