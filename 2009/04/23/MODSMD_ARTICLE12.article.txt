## Students deserve info on community center cuts 
### 
L;ist quarter, as the decision for the next
fiscal year's budget was drawing clos
er, numerous students gathered in sup
port of Stanford's community centers. On
March 6, there was a rally for community
centers in which students were asking for the
protection of full-time community center
employees and for the community center
budgets to not be cut by more than 10 per
cent. It has been more than a month since
then, and students have still not received
concrete answers to their concerns. Al
though some information was released earli
er this month, there has yet to be a public ad
dress or detailed release of the budget cuts.
We. the ( oneerned Students for Commu
nity Centers (CSCC).understand that it is in
evitable that cuts will be made across the
I University. I lowever. we believe there needs
to be transparency and student input in the
budget cut process, especially when it comes
to programs as vital to our student experi
ence as the community centers. From what
little information that has been released so
far. we suspect that the cuts made within the
Vice Provost of Student Affairs office will
disproportionately affect community cen
ters. We are also alarmed by Vice Provost
(ireg Boardman's announcement that the
cuts will be permanent, meaning that com
munity center budgets will stay reduced even
after the current economic recession passes.

As you know, community centers have
cultivated many student leaders on campus
and have provided many students with a
place which they can call home. The staff
members and the culturally sensitive pro
grams provided by these centers give many
students somewhere to go when they seek
the support that they cannot find elsewhere
on campus — whether they need academic
or career advice,or mental or emotional sup
port. Community centers provide a place in
which students are able to learn more about
themselves and about others,and are critical,
components of Stanford's commitment to
diversity. Community centers' budgets arc
already lean. Making unreasonable budget
cuts will force community centers to elimi
nate some programs altogether and will
make staff members' employment unstable,
diminishing the ability of the community
centers to do their job overall.
As students who actively use and benefit
from community centers, we have the right
to be kept informed about issues that affect
us. We urge you to join us at our rally this Fri
day at noon in White Plaza, as we unite for a
community-wide response to the lack of
transparency and to protect our second
homes.
