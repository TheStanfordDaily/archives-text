# Too Big To Fall
## The 						do's and don'ts of Admit Weekend 
### 
Dear Prospective freshman,
Let me just he the 300 th person to say:
Welcome to Stanford! I hope you find
your stay pleasant, memorable and,
naturally, academically enriching. As I am
sure you will discover. I. like everyone else
here, am filled with advice about what to do
here. Unlike everyone else here, though. I'm
not going to give you advice for how to make
the most of your Stanford career, or even for
how to pick the college that best fits you.
Those are your calls.
No. what I'm going to advise you on is far
more pressing: how to make the most of your
Stanford Admit Weekend experience. Who
knows, this may be the last time you spend a
full weekend sober here. Make it worth re
membering.
Below I've created a conveniently labeled
list of "do's" and "don'ts." I'm sure you can
figure out how this works.
DO: Shower. You may think I am joking,
but 1 am not. You will likely be here for three
hot spring days, and should you fail to bathe
that entire time, I can assure you that you will
no longer be greeted with open arms. The
showers may be cement-y, and they may not
close all the way. hut suck it up and have a
real Stanford experience.
DON'T: Forget who your Hollo's room
mate is. I forgot mine, and the next thing I
knew. I had followed a very confused
stranger into the laundry room.
DO: Pig out. You probably will be amazed
by the sheer amount and variety of Stanford
food while you are here. Enjoy that amaze
ment while it lasts. Plus, having long meals
means you get more chances to joke around,
have debates or start food fights.
DON'T: Obsess about attending every
event this weekend. Admit Weekend should
be helpful for deciding your college, but it
should also be a break. You stressed enough

Do literally
everything that
Dean Julie tells you
to do. Don't ask
why, just do it.

to got here.
DO:Gotoa fun class, like Drama 104 (Fri
day at 1:15 p.m. in Roble Gym room 33).
There are a million different lectures you can
go to. hut if you really want to get a feel for
Stanford, go to a class where you get to do
something.
I)( )NT: Bother going into downtown Palo
Alto. If you're going to take a trip while you're
here, take the time and hit up San Francisco
the food's comparably priced (if not cheaper),
and the city is vastly more interesting. Ask
your Rol lo about how to get there.

DO: Go fountain hopping.
DON'T: Cio "lake" hopping. Unless you
don't mind frogs and mosquitoes, in which
case you should absolutely go lake hopping.
DO: Do literally everything that Dean
Julie tells you to do. Don't ask why, just do it.
DON'T: Drink. You might think that the
Administration is kidding about this, but se
riously. if you as a Pro Fro drink, Stanford ad
ministrators will literally tear apart the fabric
of the Universe (yes. we have the technolo
gy). and it will be entirely your fault. You'll
have all of freshman year to make bad deci
sions. so you don't need to start now.
DO: I look up with someone. I say this not
because it's a good idea, but rather because 1
think ProFros sexiling their Rol los is a hilar
ious concept. If you can pull off this coup,
then by all means,shoot for the stars.
DO: Spend time with your RoHos and fel
low admits. Most of them will be interesting,
helpful and. I am sure you will be shocked at
this, at least as smart as you are. A few of
them will be tools,but you will learn to ignore
them in time.
DON'T: Mention SATs. You will seem
like one of those tools.
DO: Share your interests. You like skiing?
Sweet! You've climbed seven major sky
scrapers? Cool! You have a detailed collec
tion of dead wasps and gnats in your dresser?
Interesting! Don't be ashamed of what ex
cites you â€” it's why you're here. Just be sure
to listen to what makes your fellow Pro Fro
light up. because that's one of the best rea
sons to stay.
DON'T: Not shower I am using a double
negative to emphasize again how important
personal hygiene is.

DO: C ontact Kevin at ktwebb@stanford.edu if
yon have any Admit Weekend questions, or just
see him emcee with Robber Barons Sketch
C 'omedy at the A C appella show Friday night.
