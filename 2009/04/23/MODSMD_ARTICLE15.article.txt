## Nicole Demby Leper or realist?

We were destined to be best friends
for life, or so we thought. We had
been inseparable since we were two.
Yet slowly, I realized we were merely going
through the motions of best-friendship. Our
conversations became more forced. We had
to fight to find excuses to see each other.
Gradually, we filled the void left by our wan
ing friendship with other friends with whom
we had more in common.
It's not that I'm skeptical of the saying
"best friends forever" in general: it's just that
it's never held true in my own life. Despite
how close I've been with friends in the past,
despite how secure our friendship seemed,
in my lifetime even my longest standing
friendships have fizzled over the course of
time. This may seem like a depressing
thought, and perhaps it is for those of you for
whom friendship is contingent on sitting
next to someone on the first day of kinder
garten. and then being the bridesmaid or
best man at their wedding. I, on the other
hand, would like to see my lack of lifelong
bestfrienditude as a testament to the fact
that people tend to grow, rather than stag
nate overtime. It's either that, or I'm a
BFFAE leper.
Ibis week's Science limes ran an article
whose headline seriously read. "What Are
Friends F or? A Longer Life. "The article dis
cussed a woman who reached out to her cir
cle of childhood friends, "the girls from
Ames." when she was diagnosed with breast

cancer. These ancient friends provided her
with the support network she needed to re
cover. You know, the article says (roughly)
people with more friends are 22 percent less
likely to die young, horrible deaths.
So science reinforces our sappiest notions
of friendship. People who love and arc
beloved aren't only happier: they're healthi
er too. Listen up. all you unpopular kids out
there. You'd better try harder to make
friends, or you're going to die of cancer!
Yet maybe the paradigm of the life-long
friend isn't necessarily the ideal. Maybe it's
good that we can experience closeness with a
wide range of people over the course of our
lifetime without this closeness being contin
gent on some sort of unbreakable bond.
It sounds like a horrendous cliche, but it's
true: college is a time of change and growth.
Many of the friends I had freshman year have
since become acquaintances with whom I
merely exchange a passing "hi!" on my way
to class. I also developed friendships fresh
man year that I have sustained: these friend
ships are the ones that grew as I did. Iliey en
dured fights and even extended periods of
discomfort, yet ultimately persevered be
cause of their flexibility. It's been our capaci
ty to communicate our problems, no matter
how deep or seemingly insurmountable, that
has sustained them.
I once asked my dad what it was like to be
married to someone (my mother) for almost
30 years. I le said something like,"Your rela

tionshipgoes through a lot of stages â€” some
good and some had.The triek is that it keeps
changing, that even after so many years, it
hasn't fully settled into any one thing."
I .ife has its own natural ebb and flow, and
two friends are deluding themselves to think
their relationship will not reflect that. It is the
ability to talk about these ebbs and flows that
establishes a more solid connection, a core of
good communication that gives enduring
friendships their flexible form. My parents
may be a testament to the fact that this flexi
bility can engender really long relationships.
Yet there is a reason why half of all marriages
end in divorce. Sometimes the strain of so
much change is too much for even the most
flexible friendships. Sometimes time brings
too many tensions to the fore. Sometimes the
capability to communicate breaks down. It
isn't necessarily anyone's fault. It just hap
pens.
While I certainly hope my closest friends
here at Stanford will remain close for a long
time to come, I acknowledge the possibility
that one day we may be happy memories in
each other's Face book albums. It's a slightly
saddening notion, but not too depressing if
you value friendships for what they are. and
your enjoyment of them is not contingent on
some artificial stipulation that they must re
main unmovable for eternity.
