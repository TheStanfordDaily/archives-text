# CAL CLIPS CARDINAL
## 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Ilie No. 13 Stanford women's tennis
team dropped its final match of the sea
son to No. X California over the weekend
in a close.4-3 decision. With the loss, Sta
nford fell to 17-4 overall and h-2 in Pacific
-10 Conference play.
The Cardinal women took the early
lead in the afternoon, capturing the dou
bles point with wins by the doubles team
of sophomore Hilary Barte and junior
Lindsay Burdette, and by freshmen
Logan I lansen and Veronica Li.
Barte added to the Cardinal's lead
with a quick 6-3.6-1 win over Jana Jurico
va for the 2-0 Stanford edge. Cal came
roaring back, however, with three
straight singles wins.
Sophomore Carolyn McVeigh tied up
the match with a 7-6 (3).7-5 win over Bo
jana Bobusic. But in the decisive match.
Burdette dropped a hard-fought 4-6.7-6
(5). 6-2 decision to Marina Cossou.

"I would say that it was tough to take,
but we played an unbelievable doubles
point and we couldn't quite figure it out
in singles." Burdette said. "They were
ranked ahead of us. we were on their
home court and they played very well."
Nearing the end of a long dual-match
season. Stanford did not have enough to
push out another close win over the
Golden Hears.
"Coming towards the end of the sea
son. we have to balance pushing our
selves to the end versus pushing our
selves too hard." Burdette said."We were
a little beat up going into it."
Earlier this season, Stanford defeated
C'al 4-3 on the 112 arm, preserving its
decade-long home winning streak. Iliis
time around. C'al had just enough to pull
out the win.
"When we played them at home, we
probably should have lost, but we won."
Murdette said. "When we played at their

place, we should have won. but we
lost. It was definitely a little hit here
and there."
Adding to the weekend's woes,
the loss ended Stanford's streak of 21
consecutive Pac-10 titles, as Southern
California defeated UCLA in Los
Angeles to go undefeated in league
play.
Despite the bad news. Stanford
can immediately avenge its loss
today at the Pac-10 Championships
in Ojai, Calif.
The Cardinal will send five play
ers to the championship singles draw:
Barte. Burdette. senior Jessica
Nguyen, McVeigh and Li. In the first
round. Burdette and Nguyen will
face off against Bobusic and Anders
son of Cal.
"I know that I want to play as
many of them as possible." Burdette
said of Cal's players. "This tourna
ment brings a whole different set of
pressure from the team match. It'll
be completely up for grabs — it
should be good."
Stanford will also send Hansen,
sophomore Jennifer Yen and senior
Isamarie Perez to the Invitational
Singles draw.
In championship doubles,Hansen
and Li, and McVeigh and Nguyen
will represent the Card. Missing from
the lineup is Stanford's top duo of
Barte and Burdette. who elected to
sit out the doubles draw.
"We've got a ton of tennis left to
play, and we've already established
our doubles ranking." Burdette said.
"We're just going to focus on our sin
gles this week."
Also representing the Cardinal
are Perez and Yen in the invitational
doubles draw.
With two freshmen at the Pac-10
Championships, the team is ready to
compete for its first individual cham
pionship since the fall season.
"It's hard not to be excited about
Ojai." Burdette said. "It's super fun
since it's an individual tournament
— the venue and seeing all the play
ers you played with in juniors."
While this past weekend did not
go how Stanford had envisioned it,
Burdette is optimistic about the team
heading into postseason play.
"I think that the Cal match, al
though it would have been great to
pull it out. shows that all of the best

teams in the country are neck-and
neck." Burdette said. "It's anybody's
game on any given day. Somebody
pretty surprising is going to come out
successful in NCAAs and I hope it's
us."
