## Stanford's offense powers team to win over Cal .500 conference record 
### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Slowly but surely, the Cardinal hats seem
to he coming alive as the season goes on.The
Stanford offense was in full force Wednesday
night, giving the team an 8-3 lead after the
first four innings. The team never looked
hack en route to an 11-7 victory over Cal at
Sunken Diamond in the rubber match be
tween two rivals.
The heart of the lineup was instrumental
in rallying the troops: hatting third, junior
outfielder Toby Gerhart filled the box score
with three hits, three runs and two RBls.The
four and five spots provided the power, as
senior first baseman Brent Milleville hit a
two-run homer in the third inning and. bat
ling cleanup, sophomore rightfielder Kellen
Kiilsgaard followed suit the next inning, hit
ting a two-run shot off the right-field score
board.
Junior right-hander Kyle Thompson was

credited with the victory after taking over in
relief of freshman Brian Busick.The Cardi
nal pitching was not the story of the night —
the team called on seven pitchers over the
course of the game — but it still got the job
done in a win that moved Stanford above the
.500 mark with a record of 17-16 overall and
(S-S in the Pacific-10 Conference.
"1 think we started very slowly.and 1 think
we've gotten better." head coach Mark Mar
quess said. "Especially offensively, we really
weren't swinging the bats well [before| and
have played much better baseball, so hope
fully we can continue to improve. We're just
a little over halfway [through the season] and
hopefully these last four weekends can con
tinue to build our improvement and finish
strong."
"Anytime you can get 11 runs.you should
win the ballgame." said sophomore closer
Drew Storen. who picked up his fifth save of
the season. Wednesday night. "We had some
guys step up and il's always nice lo have some

nice offensive production. I'm excited about
our offense."
The win also marked a milestone of sorts
for Marquess, who won his 1343 rd game as
the Cardinal's head coach. The victory
moved him past USC's Rod Dedeaux to give
him sole possession of eighth place on the all
time NCAA Division-I win list.
The Bears fell to IX-20 on the season, hut
they were not lacking chances in the game's
final innings. Cal loaded the bases with just
one out in the top of the seventh, but as is
common in baseball, all of the momentum
went away with one swing; Bears freshman
Danny Oh lined out to Milleville at first base
for an easy double play, and just like that, the
Cardinal was out of the jam.
Cal reliever Michael Bugary didn't do his
part to further the Bears' cause, either. Al
though he has been one of the top relievers
for Cal this season, he was chronically wild in
the eighth inning, throwing five wild pitches
in total in his appearance. After reaching first
base on a single.sophomore second baseman
Colin Walsh scored after advancing three
times on three separate wild pitches.
By the time Bugary finally retired the
Cardinal in the eighth. Stanford had a four
run cushion, which was more than enough
for Storen — he retired the side in order in
the top of the ninth to seal the victory.
Stanford now faces the last-place team in
the Pac-10, Arizona, for a three-game series
at Sunken Diamond. Though the Wildcats
are in last, the Pac-10 is a packed conference
the Cardinal is two and a half games out of
second, but only three games ahead of last
place Arizona — and Stanford knows it
won't be easy.
