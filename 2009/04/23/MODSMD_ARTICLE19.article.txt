# How's life in the big leagues?
## 
### 
Any Stanford student who
has paid any attention to
Cardinal baseball over the
last 2()-plus years knows
that this team has had a long history
of success. The program has two Col
lege World Series victories and has
appeared in the finals five times since
1987.
Eleven of the Cardinal's 16 trips
to Omaha have come in the last 22
years, and long-time head coach
Mark Marquess just moved into a tie
for eighth place on the all-time
NCAA wins list for coaches.
ITiis program has produced star
major-leaguers, like Mike Mussina.
Carlos Quentin and a total of 76
MLB players dating back over 100
years. Of course, only a small portion
of the total players drafted and
signed every year actually make an
impact in the big leagues, but Cardi
nal baseball has regularly cranked
out players lull of potential.
This week. The Inside Pitch will
check in on some players from last
year's CWS team and see how they
are performing on their journey to
reach the Show.
Jason Castro, C: First Round, 10th
overall pick, Houston Astros
Castro started every game for the
Card last season, leading all batters
with a .376 average and 73 RBI. and
he was second on the team in homers
with 14. After signing with the Astros
last summer, he hit .275 with two
home runs in 39 games forTri-City of
the New York-Penn league. I le start
ed this year with the Lancaster
Jet Hawks of the Class-A Advanced
California League, and is batting .260
with four doubles, a triple and a
home run in just 12 games. But what
the numbers can't show is hisdefense
and his ability to control the game
and work with pitchers. Don't be sur
prised if you see him making an ap
pearance in Houston in the next two
or three years.
Jeremy Bleich, SP: Compensation
Round A, 44th overall pick, New
York Yankees
Bleich was limited to nine starts in
2008 by injury, but he was extremely
effective when he pitched. The left
hander compiled a 3-3 record and an
LRA of just 2.09 over 47.1 innings,
while striking out 42 and holding op
posing batters to just a average.
Pitching this season for the Tampa
Yankees of the Class-A Advanced
Florida State League, he is 1-0 in two
starts with an LRA of just 2.53 and
has six strikeouts in just 10.2 innings
of work. Hie road through the minor
leagues is often a long one for start
ing pitchers, but left-handers who
can strike hitters out while maintain
ing a low LRA are always in de
mand.
Cord Phelps, 2B: Third Round, 107 th
overall pick, Cleveland Indians
Phelps was the ultimate table-set
ter for the Cardinal last season, hit
ting .351 with an on-base percentage
of .445 from the leadoff spot. The
switch hitter scored a team-high 76
runs and added 13 home runs of his
own while playing solid defense
throughout the year. He played part
of last summer with the Mahoning
Valley Scrappers of the New York
Penn league, hitting .312 with two
home runs, 24 runs scored and 22


Erik
Adorns
The Inside Pitch
RBI in just 35 games.This year with
the Kinston Indians of the Class-A
Advanced Carolina League, he is
.279 with nine runs and seven RBI in
just 12 games. If he can continue to
play solid defense in the middle-in
field and get on base regularly, he
should move up through the system
steadily.
Sean Ratliff, OF: Fourth Round,
1 34th overall pick, New York Mets
The slugger piled up 22 home
runs and a .294 average for Stanford
last season, while managing to steal
eight bases as well. His average
dipped last summer to .229 while
playing for Brooklyn of the New
York-Penn league, but he still blast
ed seven homers in 59 games. This
year, he is playing with the Savan
nah Sand Gnats of the Class-A Ad
vanced South Atlantic League, and
is hitting .300 with one dinger in 12
games.
Overview of other picks:
Austin Yount: 12th Round, 367 th
overall pick, L.A. Dodgers
Currently in extended Spring
Training, he hit .301 with a homer
and 21 RBI for the Ogden Raptors
of the Rookie-Level Pioneer
League last summer.
Erik Davis, P: 13th Round, 405 th
overall pick, San Diego Padres
Davis compiled a 2-0 record with
a 2.70 ERA and 39 strikeouts in 26.2
innings last summer, and is current
ly 3-0 with a 2.16 ERA and 10strike
outs in 8.1 innings for the Fort
Wayne Tincaps of the Class-A Mid
west League.
