## Profs. criticize stimulus 13 Stanford faculty members submit appeal 
### MOLLY SPAETH 
In a paper submitted last week, 13
Stanford experts on telecommunica
tions. auctions and competition policy
joined 58 other economists in urging
the National Telecommunications
Information Agency (NTIA) and the
Rural Utilities Service (RIJS) to
award broadband stimulus grants to
the lowest bidden using auction mech
anisms to distribute grants.
The economists say that this will
lead to greater efficiency in capital
allocation of the $7.2 billion in eco
nomic stimulus money slated for high
speed Internet development. ..
The paper, which has been Hgned
by 71 different economists from vari
ous universities across the country,
was submitted in response to the
broadband stimulus Notice of Inquiry
(or NOI) that called on individuals or
groups to submit various proposals on
the most efficient means of distribut
ing grant money to improve telecom
munications and broadband service
for underserved areas.
The proposal was based on the suc
cess that procurement auctions have
had in providing universal services to
various sectors of the U.S. govern
ment. and in underserved areas of
countries like Chile and India.
Last Friday, Gregory Rosston.
deputy director of the Stanford
Institute for Economic Policy
Research (SIEPR) and former
deputy chief economist of the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC),
met with leaders of the National
Economic Council, the FCC, NTIA
and RIJS to discuss the proposal.
"I had some people at this meeting
who were very interested and some
who were very skeptical, so who
knows what's going to happen."
Rosston said. "The fact that NTIA
called me back after the meeting is a
good sign."
A key goal of the proposal was to
make the grant selection process more
transparent and less politically moti
vated.
"It allows projects in different areas
to compete against each other instead
of competing by having your
Congressman call my Congressman,"
Rosston said.
However, there are some barriers
to turning the proposal into action.
The NTIA administrator nominee,
Larry Strickling, has yet to be con
firmed by the Senate. I Jntil he is con
firmed. it will be much harder to dis
tribute the $.V-> billion that has been
allocated to the NTIA for creating
bnladband i nfrastruct u re.
Furthermore, under the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
Congress has until Feb. 17, 2010 to
deliver a national broadband plan.
I lowever. RUS has plans to distribute
a large chunk of its money by
September, and NTIA will be spend
ing its money in three phases: spring
2009. fall 2009, and spring 2010.
For this reason, many worry that
the stimulus money allocated for
broadband grants may be spent before
a national broadband plan even exists.
However, the policymakers who
worked on the proposal recognized
this problem and urged lawmakers to
allocate at least a portion of the first
wave of broadband stimulus funding
and expand if the program were suc
cessful.
"We realize (the proposal] is sort of
pushing the envelope." Rosston said.
"If you don't want to do this all at
once, then you should allocate at least
