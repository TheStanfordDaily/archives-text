## Profs. criticize stimulus 13 Stanford faculty members submit appeal 
### MOLLY SPAETH 
In a paper submitted last week, 13
Stanford experts on telecommunica
tions. auctions and competition policy
joined 58 other economists in urging
the National Telecommunications
Information Agency (NTIA) and the
Rural Utilities Service (RIJS) to
award broadband stimulus grants to
the lowest bidden using auction mech
anisms to distribute grants.
The economists say that this will
lead to greater efficiency in capital
allocation of the $7.2 billion in eco
nomic stimulus money slated for high
speed Internet development. ..
The paper, which has been Hgned
by 71 different economists from vari
ous universities across the country,
was submitted in response to the
broadband stimulus Notice of Inquiry
(or NOI) that called on individuals or
groups to submit various proposals on
the most efficient means of distribut
ing grant money to improve telecom
munications and broadband service
for underserved areas.
The proposal was based on the suc
cess that procurement auctions have
had in providing universal services to
various sectors of the U.S. govern
ment. and in underserved areas of
countries like Chile and India.
Last Friday, Gregory Rosston.
deputy director of the Stanford
Institute for Economic Policy
Research (SIEPR) and former
deputy chief economist of the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC),
met with leaders of the National
Economic Council, the FCC, NTIA
and RIJS to discuss the proposal.
"I had some people at this meeting
who were very interested and some
who were very skeptical, so who
knows what's going to happen."
Rosston said. "The fact that NTIA
called me back after the meeting is a
good sign."
A key goal of the proposal was to
make the grant selection process more
transparent and less politically moti
vated.
"It allows projects in different areas
to compete against each other instead
of competing by having your
Congressman call my Congressman,"
Rosston said.
However, there are some barriers
to turning the proposal into action.
The NTIA administrator nominee,
Larry Strickling, has yet to be con
firmed by the Senate. I Jntil he is con
firmed. it will be much harder to dis
tribute the $.V-> billion that has been
allocated to the NTIA for creating
bnladband i nfrastruct u re.
Furthermore, under the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act.
Congress has until Feb. 17, 2010 to
deliver a national broadband plan.
I lowever. RUS has plans to distribute
a large chunk of its money by
September, and NTIA will be spend
ing its money in three phases: spring
2009. fall 2009, and spring 2010.
For this reason, many worry that
the stimulus money allocated for
broadband grants may be spent before
a national broadband plan even exists.
However, the policymakers who
worked on the proposal recognized
this problem and urged lawmakers to
allocate at least a portion of the first
wave of broadband stimulus funding
and expand if the program were suc
cessful.
"We realize (the proposal] is sort of
pushing the envelope." Rosston said.
"If you don't want to do this all at
once, then you should allocate at least
a portion of the money and try this
system and see what is the price per
household."
Although the proposal wasn't offi
cially submitted until April 13. the idea
ot using procurement auctions to dis
tribute stimulus money had been cir
culated throughout the group of poli-

"We're saying that
given that we're going
to spend money, let's
at least minimize
waste."

cymakers before the stimulus hill had
even existed, back when Rosston was
working on Obama's transition team.
Once the stimulus bill was passed,
brainstorming began and 13 Stanford
economists got on board. Afterwards,
they sent their proposal out to other
notable names in economics.
"We thought this was a pretty
important thing with so much money
at stake," Rosston said. "We got a list
of names of people who were in
telecommunications â€” around 120
people. A few made comments and

had some questions on things, but we
didn't end up changing it very much
and got people to sign on."
Not every economist who
endorsed the procurement auction
proposal endorsed the stimulus pack
age. however. In fact, many disagreed
on the overall effectiveness of the
stimulus package and broadband
infrastructure development on creat
ing jobs and spurring the economy.
"I was originally hesitant to join
this team partly because I'm against
the stimulus package." said Andrzej
Skrzypacz, associate professor of eco
nomics at the CiSB. "I was thinking
that if I'm writing something about
spending the stimulus money, maybe
that will be interpreted that I'm one of
the guys who is saying that we should
be spending the money. But that's not
what we're writing about. We're saying
that given that we're going to spend
money, let's at least minimize waste."
Economics Prof. Paul Milgrom.
one of the signatories of the paper, dis
agreed with Skrzvpacz's sentiment.
"I think that for us to have a coun
try that's unified, it is really important
that communication access be widely
available," Milgrom said. "I think we
do need a stimulus package at this
point, and I think the best use of the
stimulus money is to spur investment,
and I think this is a relatively good
one."
Now that the paper has been sub
mitted for review, the 71 economists
who signed on can only wait to see
whether the NTIA and RUS adopt
their new auction approach.
"The government will have to give
the proposal a careful hearing,"
Milgrom said."lt's always the case that
bureaucrats think that they recognize
the flaws in new ways and they are less
cognizant of the flaws in the old ways.
We will advocate and ;rv to convince

people that there really are Haws in
the old approach."
If the NTIA and RUS do decide to
use procurement auctions and the
approach is successful. Skrzypacz pre
dicted that the entire process of allo
cating subsidies in areas outside the
telecommunications industry could be
revolutionized.
"I think there is a huge opportuni

ty to change, in general, how policies
are made." Skrzypacz said. "This will
be like a pilot program. We can try to
use the auctions, and if it is successful.
I think it will make it much easier for
policymakers to see auctions as a
robust way to allocate subsidies."
