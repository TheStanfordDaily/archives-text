## Students celebrate Earth Day 
### LAURA STAMPLER 
Music engulfed a packed White Plaza yes
terday in a student-organized celebration of
Earth Day 2(X)9. GreenFest. sponsored by
Students for a Sustainable Stanford (SSS).is
a week's worth of celebration and environ
mentally conscious events, its raison d'etre
being yesterday's festivities.
GreenFest coordinators Molly Oshun i 1
and Alex Luisi' 12 made sure that no student,
activist or otherwise, could walk around cam
pus without noticing the events.
White Plaza was lined with brightly deco
rated stands representing numerous student
organizations, artwork, a produce stand,
games, rallies and musical performances.
Crowds surrounded the Parking and
Transportation Services (PT&S) stand,
which had a display of stationary bikes con
nected to blenders.
"We're peddle-powering smoothies with
out electricity." said bike coordinator
Ariadne Scott. "So. it's a blender bike! Jamba
Juice donated all of the fruit and juice, so we
can get on and peddle-power smoothies on
Earth Day."
PT&S also had a "Love your bike" com
plimentary maintenance station to promote
alternative modes of transportation and put
on a raffle, the winner of which would be able

to name a Zip Car.
Some students ehose to come to the event
in costume, or even full-on body paint.
"I really love Earth Day: I think it's a fab
ulous day.and I'm down for any excuse to
wear a costume," said Jolie Glaser '08, who
dyed herself for the occasion. "Last year, 1
started dying myself green and wearing cos
tumes to Earth Day, and it was so much fun
that 1 had to do it again. I think that the
turnout today is excellent and it's also awe
some that just being green and walking
around campus, people will say "Happy Earth
Day' to me. even away from this event. It's
really fun."
"You know, every day should be Earth
Day." said Matt Lucky'lo. "It shouldn't have
to be official to be celebrated. But I actually
have my class on sustainable energy right
after this, so GreenFest is pretty appropriate
right now."
Earth Day has become the world's largest
secular holiday and its history is closely
linked to the Stanford community. Stanford's
own Denis Hayes '69 coordinated the first
Earth Day on April 22. 1970 as a way to
appreciate the Earth's environment. Haves
kicked off the GreenFest 2009 festivities by
giving a speech on Meyer Lawn on April 14
