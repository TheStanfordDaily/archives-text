## Obama: Has change come? 
### DAVID GILL 
rast November, Sarahi Constantine '11
spent the night before the election
handing out flyers for the Barack
I Obama campaign, making sure that
JL—Ji people knew where they could vote
and how to get there.
Constantine was part of the Stanford chap
ter of Students for Obama, an organization that
captured some of the excitement felt by many
students around the country who joined the
effort to elect the Senator from Illinois to
become the 44th President of the United
States.
Almost 100 days after the inauguration.

Constantine now says that while she does not
necessarily agree with all of the new adminis
tration's policies, she is very happy with the
openness that Obama introduced in
Washington — in how he listens to people and
makes decisions.
"A variety of opinions brings the best solu
tions. and I just love it when I hear how his
advisers argue over, say. economic policy,"
Constantine said. "I know that Obama is listen
ing to everyone, something we have not seen in
the past eight years."
According to a recent New York Times/CBS
News poll. Constantine's optimism is shared by
two-thirds of Americans who approve of
President Obama's performance thus far.

Recently, though, there has also been grow
ing criticism aimed at the President, including
among Obama supporters. Some have raised
questions on whether, for example, the admin
istration is doing enough to address the eco
nomic meltdown, restore faith in the financial
markets and deal with the situation in Iraq and
Afghanistan.
With the Obama team facing the transition
from a campaign to a presidency, some have
also suggested that students who went all-out
for Obama last fall have now come down to
earth and are. well, over him.
Marina Jenkins J.D. '10. who served as a
coordinator for the Stanford for Obama
chapter, may be one of those students.
"I'm very confident with Obama as
President." she said. "It's hard to imagine
how anyone else in his position, having to
face with what lie's facing, would have done
any different or better."
At the same time. Jenkins also expressed
concerns about some of the White House's
policies. For example, she fears that Wall
Street may have too big of a say on how the
government approaches the economic crisis
and that some of Obama's advisers are try
ing to "put bandages over a broken finan
cial system instead of repairing it."
Debashish Bakshi "10. who was also a
Stanford campus coordinator for Obama.
said that while he is generally happy with
the President, he is also "not sure" about the
plan to remove toxic assets from banks and
why detainees in Afghanistan are treated
differently from those in Guantanamo Bay.
So are students more realistic today
about Obama than they were during the
campaign?
"It's hard to shift from being defensive
of your candidate all the time to asking
questions and participating in an open dis
cussion." Jenkins noted. "It took me a
while, but 1 am now in a position where I
am able to provide some, let's call it 'con
structive criticism.'"
Some who worked on the campaign
reject the notion that expectations were too
high to begin with.
"The campaign used very strong rhetoric
about change, but it was clear that Obama
would not be able to solve everything at
once." Constantine said. "We have always
been realistic about that."
Stephanie Parker '11. who was also with
the Stanford for Obama group, felt that
while it is true that Obama's persona was a
key attraction for many students, support
ers who have worked on policy research
and know where Obama stood are happy
with what he has already accomplished.
"1 hear people disappointed and even
angry." she said. "1 think those who are
angry simply project onto Obama their
unrealistic expectations that all problems

will be solved within a few months. Or.
maybe they are just looking for a reason to
be mad no matter what."
Bakshi echoed this sentiment.
"People were fairly realistic during the
campaign, and for those who cared about
progressive issues like putting a lot of
money into health care, schools and renew
able energy, I think Obama has met their
expectations." Bakshi said.
Law Prof. Bill Gould, who was on the
campaign's team of advisers, said he feels
inspired by Obama's taking on so many
issues at the same time, although he worries
that he may not be politically able to fight
all of these battles at once.
Gould added that while he is also trou
bled with the approach that Treasury
Secretary Timothy Geithner and Economic
Adviser Larr\ Summers are taking with the
economic crisis, he finds that Obama has
"moved effectively to listen to what other
people are saying as well, and to public
reaction."
This overall high satisfaction with
Obama's first few months in office can also
be explained by the "grace period" the
young President is still enjoying. Or. as
Jenkins suggested. Obama's backers at
Stanford may simply need more time to
adjust to their candidate now making deci
sions that call for deeper scrutiny.
But with the election vibe fading and
finals approaching, some students who
worked day in and day out for the cam
paign have moved on. Or have they?
Gould said he would not be surprised il
fervent Obama supporters do not show the
same enthusiasm next time, assuming he
continues acting the way he has so far. At
the grassroots level, however, not everyone
agrees. Parker sensed that many students
have indeed moved on with their lives.
"An effort to redeploy them now would
probably be much more difficult." she
smiled.
In the meantime, those who worked for
the campaign are planning their next
moves. Constantine. for instance, is hoping
for a future career in Washington. Bakshi is
currently exploring new opportunities for
political activism, eyeing San Francisco

Mayor Gavin Newsom's campaign for
California governor. And Parker is "repri
oritizing school." hut said she will probably
also be involved with the upcoming race for
California governor.
At the same time, some are trvine to set

a grasp of where the political wind blows by
looking at something as simple as
University dorms.
"Stanford was one of the most Pro-
Obama campuses during the election."
Bakshi observed."! think that has not real-

I\ changed. Hey. when I go around campus
these davs. I still see a lot of Obama posters
on the windows and walls!"

same enthusiasm next time, assuming he
continues acting the way he has so far. At
the grassroots level, however, not everyone
agrees. Parker sensed that many students
have indeed moved on with their lives.
"An effort to redeploy them now would
probably be much more difficult." she
smiled.
In the meantime, those who worked for
the campaign are planning their next
moves. Constantine. for instance, is hoping
for a future career in Washington. Bakshi is
currently exploring new opportunities for
political activism, eyeing San Francisco

Mayor Gavin Newsom's campaign for
California governor. And Parker is "repri
oritizing school." hut said she will probably
also be involved with the upcoming race for
California governor.
At the same time, some are trvine to set

a grasp of where the political wind blows by
looking at something as simple as
University dorms.
"Stanford was one of the most Pro-
Obama campuses during the election."
Bakshi observed."! think that has not real-

I\ changed. Hey. when I go around campus
these davs. I still see a lot of Obama posters
on the windows and walls!"

Debashish Bakshi '10, Sarahi Constantine '1 1 and Marina Jenkins J.D. '10 were ardently pro-Obama in the fall. Now, like millions of oth
ers across America, they are evaluating Obama on the policy he has brought forward, not his campaign promises and persona.
