## Obama: Has change come? 
### DAVID GILL 
rast November, Sarahi Constantine '11
spent the night before the election
handing out flyers for the Barack
I Obama campaign, making sure that
JL—Ji people knew where they could vote
and how to get there.
Constantine was part of the Stanford chap
ter of Students for Obama, an organization that
captured some of the excitement felt by many
students around the country who joined the
effort to elect the Senator from Illinois to
become the 44th President of the United
States.
Almost 100 days after the inauguration.

Constantine now says that while she does not
necessarily agree with all of the new adminis
tration's policies, she is very happy with the
openness that Obama introduced in
Washington — in how he listens to people and
makes decisions.
"A variety of opinions brings the best solu
tions. and I just love it when I hear how his
advisers argue over, say. economic policy,"
Constantine said. "I know that Obama is listen
ing to everyone, something we have not seen in
the past eight years."
According to a recent New York Times/CBS
News poll. Constantine's optimism is shared by
two-thirds of Americans who approve of
President Obama's performance thus far.

Recently, though, there has also been grow
ing criticism aimed at the President, including
among Obama supporters. Some have raised
questions on whether, for example, the admin
istration is doing enough to address the eco
nomic meltdown, restore faith in the financial
markets and deal with the situation in Iraq and
Afghanistan.
With the Obama team facing the transition
from a campaign to a presidency, some have
also suggested that students who went all-out
for Obama last fall have now come down to
earth and are. well, over him.
