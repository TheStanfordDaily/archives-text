No. 4 Stanford (37-6. 7-5 Pacific-10
Conference) bounced hack from a los
ing weekend in Arizona, blanking San
Jose State (18-30,5-10 Western Athletic
Conference) last night. The Cardinal
rode on the shoulders of sophomore
Ashley Chinn in the circle. Chinn no-hit
the Spartans and posted nine strikeouts

The Spartans entered the game win
less against Stanford since 2002.

at the Arizona schools.
Chinn praised her team's ability to
bounce back after a pair of losses last
weekend.
