ing weekend in Arizona, blanking San

Ashley Chinn in the circle. Chinn no-hit
the Spartans and posted nine strikeouts

games, including two losses by run rule
at the Arizona schools.

"The series was pretty ugly, we
thought." Chinn said. "It's something
we don't want to repeat. We came out
and had a great practice on Monday."
Chinn tossed seven complete
innings, facing 22 Spartan hitters. She
surrendered just three walks and did
not allow a runner to move beyond sec

the inning with a base knoek and

Then, the Cardinal hats un

three runs, the entirety of Stan
ford's offense on the evening, but
it was more than enough for
Chinn.
"The pressure was on for me
to keep it a 0-0 game," Chinn
said."TTie runs took some weight
off my shoulders."
Chinn only accelerated her

game after the fourth inning. She
retired 12 of the last 13 Spartan
hitters, fanning five in the final
three frames en route to her 13th
complete game of the year.
Chinn. now the owner of an
impressive 1.82 I R A on the sea

catcher for the no-hitter.
"(Jnniorj Rosey Neill helped
out a lot," she said. "She kind of
just told me what to throw, and I
threw it."
San Jose State hung in with
Stanford, surrendering only six
hits in a losing effort. Freshman
Amanda Pridemore took the loss
after five innings of work, walk
ing six and striking out two for
the Spartans.
Pridemore struggled with her

command of tlie strike zone,
coughing up half a dozen walks
to Stanford hitters. Conversely.
Chinn noted a contrast in her
control and variance of pitches.
Since Sunday's loss at Ari

improvement.
"I worked my change-up in a
lot today, which was very benefi
cial," she said. "I didn't even
think about the no-hitter."

overall, while San Jose state
dropped to IN-30. The Cardinal
