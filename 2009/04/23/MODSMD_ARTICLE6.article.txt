## GSC discusses budget Gobaud introduces Draw matchmaker program 
### DANIEL BUI STAFF WRITER 
Last night, the Graduate Student
Council (GSC) discussed the newly
appointed members of the Nominations
Commission (NomCom). budgeting
issues and departmental responses to the
recently announced Vaden Health
Center fee.
The GSC began the meeting with the
Senate report, where incoming ASSU
President David Gobaud *()S M.S. '10
announced the development of a Web
site called the ASSU Matchmaker.
Created separately from Stanford
Residential & Dining Enterprises, the
site is designed to help students with sim
ilar living preferences connect with one
another for the upcoming Draw.
"It helps people who are entering the
lottery find roommates with similar
interests, such as social level or noise
level." Gobaud said.
After entering their preferences, the
program will run an algorithm that will
recommend the best matches to partici
pating students. Gobaud stressed that
the results of the algorithm would simply
be recommendations for finding living
partners.
"It's up to you to initiate contact and
to form a group if you want." he finished.
The GSC was introdueed to Jonathan
Bakke Grad '11. the newly appointed
chair of NomCom. a body that selects
students to take leadership positions in
University committees.
Delegates continued the meeting
with a discussion on budgeting issues for
the following year.
The recent decision by the University
to dramatically slash funding for the
Graduate Student Programming Board
(GSPB) was met with a major con
tention from the GSC.
Funding for the GSPB provided by
the Graduate Life Office and the Office
of the Provost was completely
removed, making it difficult for the
board to maintain the vast majority of
the activities that it plans for graduate
students each year.
"I know, as an off-campus student.
I'm just angry that this got cut
because the Provost subsidized on
campus programming, but this was
the only major off-campus program

ming committee," said. Ryan
Peacock, a third-year graduate stu
dent in chemical engineering."l'd like
to see [the (iSC'| work for the long
term to see that this program be fund
ed."
Delegates discussed a number of
other benefits of making sure that the
GSPB stays afloat, noting the impor
tance of the events held bv the board
in maintaining graduate student men
tal health. Members agreed that pro
viding additional funding to compen
sate for the board's losses was a high
priority.
"One of the advantages to putting

GSC money into something like this
is that we wouldn't have to abide by
all of the rules that come with run
ning through the Provost," added
Fren Zhao, a fifth-year graduate stu
dent in applied physics. "We would
have more control over decisions for
events."
The GSC proposed to move
$S.(HX) to help the GSPB hold its
events. Members also agreed to allot
$4.0(H) to the Diversity Advocacy
Committee for the following year.
The meeting ended with a discus
sion with representatives from dif
ferent graduate school departments

about the recently announced
Vaden Health Center fee. which has
met much discord from students and
administrators. Weeks after the
unveiling of the fee. the general sen
timent is still one of confusion.
"Everybody is wondering what...
is going on and what we are going to
do about it." said Adam Bederg, a
graduate student in computer sci
ence. "There still has been no formal
announcement."
While the University cites eco
nomic troubles as reasons for the
new fee. many students have seen
the financial crisis extends far

beyond the University itself and into
their own pockets, making it difficult
for them to bear a part of the bur
den.
"The whole idea of law school
funding was based upon the fact that
students would make a lot of money
over their summers and would be
able to pay it back, but the fact that
lots of students are losing their jobs
ruins that model." said Eric Osborne,
a former NomCom chair and Law
School student.
Still, other graduate departments
were feeling more optimistic about
how thev would handle the fees. The

history department noted that it
might have the funds to cover a sub
stantial part of the fee for its students.
Many of the departments also
stressed that students might have
much more say than even University
officials in how the University will
respond to difficulties resulting from
the tee.
"I think we should keep writing
letters to departments [about the
fee]," said GSC co-Chair Polina
Segalova.
