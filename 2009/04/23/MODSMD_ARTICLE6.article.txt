### DANIEL BUI STAFF WRITER 
Last night, the Graduate Student
Council (GSC) discussed the newly
appointed members of the Nominations
Commission (NomCom). budgeting
issues and departmental responses to the
recently announced Vaden Health
Center fee.
The GSC began the meeting with the
Senate report, where incoming ASSU
President David Gobaud *()S M.S. '10
announced the development of a Web
site called the ASSU Matchmaker.
Created separately from Stanford
Residential & Dining Enterprises, the
site is designed to help students with sim
ilar living preferences connect with one
another for the upcoming Draw.
"It helps people who are entering the
lottery find roommates with similar
interests, such as social level or noise
level." Gobaud said.
After entering their preferences, the
program will run an algorithm that will
recommend the best matches to partici
pating students. Gobaud stressed that
the results of the algorithm would simply
be recommendations for finding living
partners.
"It's up to you to initiate contact and
to form a group if you want." he finished.
The GSC was introdueed to Jonathan
Bakke Grad '11. the newly appointed
chair of NomCom. a body that selects
students to take leadership positions in
University committees.
Delegates continued the meeting
with a discussion on budgeting issues for
the following year.
The recent decision by the University
to dramatically slash funding for the
Graduate Student Programming Board
(GSPB) was met with a major con
tention from the GSC.
Funding for the GSPB provided by
the Graduate Life Office and the Office
