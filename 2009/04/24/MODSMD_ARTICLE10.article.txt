# Big family, "Big Love"
## 
### 
Few subjects are more taboo in America than that of
polygamy, the practice of having more than one wife.
Luckily, our cable programs serve to present shows
tackling controversial topics ("Weeds" on Showtime,
"Interventation" on A&E). HBO has made a generous contri
bution to this realm with "Big Love," a show following a fun
damentalist Mormon man, Bill Henrickson (played by Bill
Paxton) who lives with his three wives in Sandy, Utah.
Right from the get-go, the drama is palpable — Bill and
his wives are caught in a tangled web of greed, tradition, cor
rupt religion and the sheer difficulty of having three wives
and eight children. This show is incredibly intense — as soon
as one problem is solved, another is on its way. But don't
assume that the show doesn't have its funny moments, where
you find yourself laughing out load. Since 1 strongly recom
mend this show for your viewing pleasure, Intermission is
going to provide you with a character guide. Believe me, "Big
Love" can get more than a little confusing.
Bill Henrickson
The protagonist of "Big Love," Bill is a man with a trou
bled past. He was born and raised on a polygamist com
pound in Utah, but was kicked out when he was 14. He
struggled to provide for himself and ended up meeting his
future wife, Barb, while in college. Bill has become relatively
successful and, by the beginning of the show, owns three
home supply stores and other infant businesses. He spends
much of the show trying to fix things gone wrong and gen
erally means well,, though sometimes he can come off as
bumbling. Bill's character is heavily conflicted, but when it
comes down to it, all he cares about is his family, no matter
how unconventional this family may be to us. All he wants is
to protect his wives and children, which he has to do regular
ly from outside forces. Bill is a good man at the core, but he
is still vulnerable to vices and temptations. His multiple flaws
help make for a great plotline.
Barb Henrickson
Bill's first wife, Barb (played by Jeanne Tripplehorn) is
an incredibly strong woman. Marrying Bill in college, Barb
was an LDS Mormon, while Bill had renounced the
"Principle" (the calling to marry more than one wife).
However, after seeing his Barb battle uterine cancer, Bill
changed his mind and decided it was spiritually necessary to
take on a second wife. While at the core Barb didn't believe
the Principle, she was so in love with Bill that she was willing
to share him. This caused her family to completely disown
her, and Barb became isolated from the regular world. Much
of the show displays Barb with a calm, caring and motherly
demeanor, but the actor expertly displays Barb's actual dis
comfort and confusion about the path her life has taken. She
cares for the entire family, and because she

is the first wife, takes on the role of the
public wife as well as manager of the
households and her "sister-wives."
Barb's character is perhaps the most
complex in the entire series.

Nicolette Grant
Nicki (played by Chloe Sevigny), Bill's second wife, was
originally Barb's caretaker while she was sick with uterine
cancer. Like Bill, Nicki is also from the polygamist com
pound. However, her father is the "Prophet" and undisputed
leader among the group. Oh, and he also happens to be Bill's
greatest enemy, a little factoid that creates quite some conflict
and excitement. She strongly believes in the "Principle" and
dresses in complete modesty, looking very old-fashioned in
prairie garb. She is not used to living off the compound in
the real world and appears very cold and unsympathetic on
the surface. However, after a few episodes we find out that
she is actually passionate about many things and very caring
about the things that matter most. This still does not change
the fact that Nicki is very calculating and always looking out
for her best interests. She is constantly caught in the struggle
between her father and Bill, putting strains on both of the
relationships. One of the most interesting characters on the
show, Nicki's plotline is always one to pay attention to.
Margene Heefman
Bill's third wife, Margene (played by Ginnifer
Goodwin), is closer in age to Bill's oldest children than Bill
himself. While working at Home Plus as a customer service
agent, Margene got hired to baby-sit Bill's kids and wound
up the third wife. Her parents arc divorced, and she was
raised by her alcoholic and unstable mother. While not orig
inally Mormon, Margene is very happy with the arrange
ment and adores the idea of having an enormous family.
However, Margene is still desperate for a social life, and the
secrecy of a polygamist life is very stifling to this young and
beautiful character. Margene is generally portrayed as very
perky and easily influenced, and thus is often used by either
Nicki or Barb to side against the other. Her character is fun
and flirty, which adds variety to the characters in this show.
