# Coachella: the art festival
## 
### 
Coacheila is more than just a city in the middle of the Californian
desert. Every year during late April, it is the home to Coacheila
Valley Music & Arts Festival. This year, artists from Paul
McCartney to M.I.A. and Lupe Fiasco took the Polo Fields by storm,
attracting tens of thousands of fans from all over the world. But the
event is about more than iust the music — vervbody tends to forget that
it is also an Arts Festival. Every type of experimental art is on display for
the entire festival, and in some cases, the art pieces attract more atten
tion than unknown bands.
Some pieces have been shown nearly every year for the past decade.
Eight-time veteran Syd Klinge has exhibited the same sculpture - the
Ga.U.ac Twins — the largest and most powerful twin testa- coils in the
world, hurling massive lightning bolts back and forth in the night.
Christian Ristow s Hand of Man is also on display for the fifth year in a
row, allowing concert goers to throw up their rock hands, flash a gang
sign, and even pick up a car using a glove that controls a massive
steel/hydraulic hand. Another five-time vet includes the Lucent Dossier
Experience, one of the trippiest shows of the festival. The Lucent
Dossier Experience is what you would get if you crossed Cirque du
Soleil with a Pussycat Dolls Show, combining the erotic energy of a PCD
show with the acrobatic intensity of Cirque du Soleil. In truth, it is
probably enjoyed most when under the influence ol some type of sub
stance — something definitely not in low supply at Coacheila. Two
scantily clad women commandeer the stage in geisha style makeup,
while in the background various performers-twirl thirty feet above the
ground with an orb and ribbons. On the sides of the stage are other
oddly dressed ( if at all) performers, each performing varying acts on
mannequins. One performer seduces a mannequin before tearing off its
leg. While another simulates various sex acts, a third dresses it in drag
on the other side of the stage. All this is set to what they dub "apocalyp
tic funk music," which incorporates various elements of trance music
with heavy electronic sounds."
Newcomers to this year's "festival include Pyrocardium, a fiery,
interactive experiment, Serpent Mother, a fire-breathing steel dragon,
and Perhaps, a mirror mosaic and stainless steel scupture. Pyrocardium
proved to be the most popular exhibit until Saturday night when it was
out of commission. Attendees would clip a pulse monitor onto their fin
gers and watch as 40 balls of fire burst into the night sky, pulsing to the
rhythm of their hearts. Serpent Mother was also a crowd favorite, as its
head alone was longer than 12 feet, motioning toward the sky before
bellowing flames into the darkness. More traditional pieces included
Perhaps and Sphae, though their simplicity did not detract from the
wonder of the pieces. When the sun caught the glass of Perhaps just
right, the palm tree sculpture would shine brighter than the fiery pieces
surrounding. Following the trend of tall plant sculptures, five-year vet
eran Michael Christian displayed his 25-foot post-modern tree, Sphae,
seen at various other exhibits, though still never ceasing to amaze.
The festival showcased mostly nontraditional Californian artists
and artwork, allowing many unknowns to shine brightly (even in the
100-plus degree heat). Several artists have already been asked to appear
at next year's festival, leaving many of us waiting to see what flaming
creations they'll have for us next year.
