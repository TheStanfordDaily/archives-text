# the
						MUSIC festival: blend of old and new

### 
For one weekend a year, tens of thousands of concert
goers brave the intense desert heat and trek out to the
unJikeliest of locations to see the three-day wonder
that is the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. Held on
the Empire Polo Fields in Indies Calif., the festival hosts
solid big-name lineups from noon to midnight, Friday
through Sunday, and floods the Coachella Valley with peo
ple eager to wait hours in the 100-degree weather to catch a
glimpse of the performances.
This past weekend was only Coachella's 10th year, but
the festival and its organizer, Goldenvoice, have already
achieved national renown lor filling five outdoor stages
with a vibrant and diverse set of rock, hip-hop and elec
tronic) artists. This year's headliners were Paul McCartney,
the Killers and the Cure, and in the past, the festival has
boasted acts such a* R,Khohead, Rage Against the Machine.
Bjork and Oasis — as well as hundreds of smaller acts that
play throughout the day and into the night.
Although the main draw is the festival's consistently
stellar lineups, many flock to Ihdio to bask in the utterly
unique ambiance of.Coachella. Nowhere else will you find
neo-hippies, celebrities, body-painted college kids and aged
rockers all sweating together under the scorching sun. The
festival also features large-scale, often interactive, art instal
lations scattered across the polo grounds. Highlights of this
year's displays included ''Hand of Man,' an enormous steel
hand powered by hydraulics that you can control
with your own hand, and The Do Laß, an
oasis of colorful tents and
trance music that provides
much-needed shelter.

For those unfamiliar with the festival,
Coachella's five-stage setup includes a monstrous
main stage for the biggest headliners and rock
shows, a secondary outdoor stage for indie bands,
and three large tents for smaller bands and electron
ica groups. During the heat of the day, only the
intrepid and devoted made it out to the main two
stages, while others wisely sought the shade of the
tents. By nightfall, though, huge crowds gathered to
watch the headlining acts on the main stage, the
audience extending almost a quarter-mile from the
stage itself. For those less eager to muscle to the front
of the crowd, the main stage had extra speakers and
huge screens to broadcast the performance to the
outer rim of concert goers.
Friday's main lineup channeled a more classic feel
with performances by Leonard Cohen, Morrissey (the

"charming man" formerly of 1 he Smiths) and Paul
McCartney all performing within hours of each other.
Saturday saw more ol a laid-back early afternoon on the
main stage with performances by Joss Stone, Paolo Nutini
and the reggae-funk group Michael Franti & Spearhead —
and the evening started drawing crowds with the incompa
rable TV on the Radio. Sunday's mix was more eclectic, fea
turing Perry larrell (the only artist to appear at every
Coachella festival), Public Enemy — yes. complete with
Flavor Flav stage-diving four times during the set — and
My Bloody Valentine, whose 15-minute sound explosions
were the reason behind the festival organizers handing out
earplugs earlier that day.
Coachella 2009 showed that, once again, Goldenvoice

manages to deliver a festival that brings an incredibly
diverse crowd together i>n one stretch of grass for a week
end of audio indulgence. Even though this year's lineup was
occasionally criticized for reaching out to more "main
stream" artists such as Paul McCartney, the end result was a
success. Whether you go for one day or all three, whether
you camp out or retreat to a hotel each night. Whether you
come for the lone Boa tie or Steve Aoki, Coachella can
always boast an experience unlike any other.
