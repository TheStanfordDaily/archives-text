Y women, starry-eyed at the prospect of seeing one of the Beatles in the flesh.
When Franz Ferdinand had the main stage, frontman Alex Kapranos was
sporting a "George Harrison" shirt, and halfway through the set, noticed the

many Beatles shirts in the audience and quipped, "The Beatles? Oh, are they playing later?"
Later that evening, Silversun Pickups' Brian Aubcrt joked to the audience, "This one's for Paul
McCartney 1 really just want him to succeed."
For a festival known for its more cutting-edge acts, Paul McCartney's opening night
headline spot must have felt like a bit of a gamble. But Coachella's new attempts to unite a
wider audience were met with great enthusiasm from young and old. As thousands of fans
filled the grass around the main stage, DJ Chris Holmes played remixes of old Beatles songs
— as if the audience needed a reminder that a rock legend was about to grace them with his
presence. . /Y\y : '''
And then Sir Paul himself stepped out to thunderous applause, nattily dressed in a sharp
shirt and jacket that put the earlier grunge<lad bands to shame. He pulled a funny face, pre

tending he was surprised by the enthusiastic greeting, and then launched into a two-and-a
half hour set that went well past midnight arid covered the entire span of his musical career.
Switching between guitar, bass and piano, and putting to use his surprisingly strong
voice, the 66-year-old showed age-defying energy as he churned through hits for the more
ardent fan (from his later solo works such as "Jet") and Beatles classics that electrified even
the youngest fans into singing along — "Hey Jude," "Back in the U.S.S.R" and "Let It Be." As
he took off his jacket between songs, the crowd whistled, and h-e seemed to be a rock star
basking in the spotlight. And yet, just a few songs later, he confided in the multitudes of fans
as if they were his closest friends, explaining that the day was very emotional for him, since
it was the anniversary of the death of Linda McCartney, his wife for almost 30 years. "She
loved the desert, she loved music, she loved rock V roll," he told the crowd quietly. "She loved
it all."
McCartney squashed any doubts as to his ability to put on a stunnifig show, even with
out the presence of Ringo Starr (rumors of a surprise appearance had been flying around the
Internet in the preceding weeks). Some came for the nostalgia, some out of curiosity, but the
Beatle cleverly gave every demographic in the audience something to remember at the end of
the festival's first night.
