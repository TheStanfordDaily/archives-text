' Following a disappointing sot by
M.1.A., The Killers delivered an elec
trifying nighttime performance —

complete with stage sparks,
flames and fireworks —to
wrap up Saturday's lineup.

* The Las Vegas-based headliners last played
Coachella five years ago in a side tent, one
month before releasing their first hit album, "Hot
Fuss." This year, flanked both onstage by fauna — a theme of
the band's newest album, "Day & Age" — as well as offstage
by the Empire Polo Club's surrounding palm trees, The

Killers opened with hits "Human" and "Somebody Told Me,"
ensuring that few festival-goers prematurely headed for the
parking lots. Delivering a continuous blend of songs from all
four of the group's albums — "Hot Fuss" (2004), "Sam's
Town" (2006), "Sawdust" (2007) and"Day & Age"

(2008) — frontman Brandon Flowers
decided to "pick it up a little bit" with
"Spaceman," a hit from"Day & Age."
Flowers then jettisoned the guitar for
"Sam's Town," instead singing at the
piano in front of a violinist and back
ground singer, before relating to the
audience the band's beginnings in Las
Vegas in 2002. "1 liked the same bands
Dave liked," Flowers said, referring to
guitarist Dave Keuning. On a tape
Keuning gave Flowers during their first
meeting was what would become the
band's ticket to the alternative-rock
arena — "Mr. Brightside," which the
band performed Saturday night in
front of sparks and fireworks. After
leaving the stage, The Killers granted
the crowd's wish by returning for an
encore of "Bones," "Jenny Was a Friend
of Mine" and "When You Were Young."
The band was dwarfed by falling
sparks, rising flames and soaring fire
works, which continued as the euphor
ic crowd stumbled away from the main
stage toward their tents and cars.
