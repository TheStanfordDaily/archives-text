This year's Coachella found British train wreck Amy Winehouse, who was originally in the lineup, replaced
with hip-hop superstar M.I.A. on the Coachella main stage. After giving birth to her first child only a few
k months ago, the late replacement was greeted with a packed-to-the-brim audience.
The show opened with neon-clad backup dancers getting their groove on in front of massive tele-

screens showing images of dissent and war in other countries, with ironic phrases like "M.I. A. supports terrorism"
and "Media Genocide." The air was punctuated with sirens and gunshots, a very common sound in many of her
songs, before M.I.A. herself came on stage, clad in acid wash skinny jeans and neon accents. Her protege, Rye Rye,
was practically glued to her side throughout the performance, trying to pump up the crowd and help with the
vocals.

M.I.A. seemed hell-bent on making sure the audience didn't consider her a sellout, noting, "Just because I did
the Grammys doesn't mean I gone all sold out." She also acknowledged how awkwardly large the main stage was
for her performance, voicing what everybody in the audience was thinking — "I don't really know how to bring it

up on the main stage."
She tried to combat this obvious issue
using multiple tactics, most notably when she
invited her fans to the front of the pit onstage, try
ing desperately to connect with the audience on a
closer level. She then moved into her most popular
song, "Paper Planes," and performed it with an air
of boredom, seemingly rushing to get it over with
and get back to her child.
Her signature neon- and siren-infused
performance was not to be missed, but could have
been improved. M.I.A. herself said it best at the
end of her short set: "Next year, I'm back in the
tent. I like to feel the sweat!"
