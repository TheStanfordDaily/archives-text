# Franz Ferdinand

Playing their second Coachella festival, the Scottish rockers
walked — and crutched — onto the main stage for their 6:35

p.m. Friday timeslot. Despite lead guitarist Nick McCarthy's foot injury,
which confined the axeman to a walking boot, the band did not miss a beat

and played one of the most up-tempo sets of the day. With the sun setting to their
right, the band opened with "Dark of the Matinee" and current hit "No You Girls"
— also featured in the latest iPod commercials — off their new album "Tonight."
While sound bytes in Apple ads may not always translate into Coldplay-esque suc
cess, the members of Franz Ferdinand couldn't care less and their crowd sang along
to songs like "Take Me Out" and "What She Came For." The band's confidence and
classic suave were on full-display throughout the set — lead singer Alex Kapranos,
clad in striped pants and candy-apple red Oxfords, even used some of the 50-minute
set to joke with the crowd. "1 heard there's a band called the Beatles playing," he
teased the ranks of McCartney fans sporting their favorite Beatles memorabilia. And

in response to a fan
holding up a sign ask
ing for a peek show, he
quipped before break
ing into song,
"Someone in the crowd
wants to see my nip
ples. There's not a lot
going on up there, I'm
afraid."
