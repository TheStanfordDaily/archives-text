Wearing something akin to ceiling decorations from
IKEA, Karen O, flanked by guitarist Nick Zinner and
drummer Brian Chase, took the stage as the enig-

matic trio that is the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. Adeline to the visual

oddity was the massive inflatable eye that hung as the stage's cen
terpiece. Equal to the optical spectacle however, was the audio experience.
Karen O, sporting a gold-sequined cape and blue polka-dotted leggings,
had little care for the heat, much less the odd stares that have come to
define her stage attire, immediately belting out songs "Runaway" and
'Gold Lion." With a clean, powerful sound, the set itself was defined by its
emotional control, taking the crowd through fluctuations of intimacy,
excitement and love. The always-smiling Karen O, lithe and graceful, strut
ted the stage with cat-like moves, stirring the crowd with "Zero" and
"Heads Will Roll" off their new album "It's Blitz!" Yet with the sun setting
on Sunday, the set can perhaps be encapsulated by the performance of
"Maps," to which Karen O stated, "This song is about love." With the
crowd singing along, "Wait! They don't love you like I love you," the Yeah
Yeah Yeahs delivered one of the most personal experiences and perhaps
memorable performances of Coachella 2009.
