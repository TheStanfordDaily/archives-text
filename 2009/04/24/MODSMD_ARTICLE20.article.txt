Making their second Coachella appearance in three years,
Sweden's 10-year-old band Peter Bjorn and John took to
the main stage Sunday afternoon and slowly built a
decently sized crowd throughout their 50-minute set.

Frontman Peter Moren, sporting a sharp blue blazer, briefly
noted his enthusiasm at standing on the same stage that headliner
and former Beatle Paul McCartney did on Friday night, before delv
ing into a series of songs off of the band's newest album, "Living Thing."
Struggling to extract audience enthusiasm with their new material, the trio
finally summoned a set of bongos to the stage, signaling their inescapable
hit "Young Folks," which was accompanied by Sweden's Lykkc Li, fresh off of
her afternoon performance at the Outdoor Theatre. Hands finally pointed
skyward during "Young Folks" and continued to do so with hits "Let's Call
It Off and "Up Against the Wall." In the end, Moren, dancing with his gui
tar during "Nothing to Worry About" from the band's latest album,
appeared to have nothing to worry about: the audience took in the rocker's
enthusiasm along with the afternoon desert sun.
