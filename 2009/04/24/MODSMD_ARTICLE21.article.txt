Returning to Coachella on her own after playing last year with Rilo Kiley, indie-alt-country queen
lenny Lewis proved that she could again fill a set with catchy and poignant songs no matter her
backing band. She and her four-person band methodically worked through the hits of her

albums Acid Tongue and Rabbit lur Coat,' alternating between slow songs ("Pretty Bird") and fran
tic jams ("Jack Killed Mom," which culminated in a wonderfully chaotic frenzy). The audience, which
included Jake Gyllenhaal and Reese Witherspoon, gladly sang along for the 50-minute set as Lewis show
cased her evocative voice and unparalleled stage presence.
Lewis clearly thrives in the spotlight, having grown up as a child actress, and it showed as she crooned
her way into the hearts of the audience members with heartbreaking renditions of her best songs. She
played an acoustic version of the Rilo Kiley hit "Silver Lining," and belted out the refrain "I want to tell you
I love you" with incredible power in "The Next Messiah." The backing band also abandoned their instru
ments for "Acid Tongue," where Lewis sang and played guitar while the band members huddled around a
microphone and sang backup, creating an intimate atmosphere for one song. As the set came to a close,
she prepared lor the last song, and as a means of goodbye, said to the audience in her most charming voice,
"Well shit, it's about that time."
