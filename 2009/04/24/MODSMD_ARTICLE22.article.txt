Sandwiched between the set times of concert "oldies" Leonard Cohen, Morrissey and Paul
. McCartney, Los Angeles' Silversun Pickups played the last set of the day on the Outdoor Stage
Friday night. Trying not to be discouraged by the former Beatle who would be playing across

the way, lead singer Brian Aubert quipped, "I really hope the best for Paul McCartney." Yet the breakout
rock band, which recently released a new album, "Swoon," did little to disappoint, more than ready to show
that they would not be affected by the sophomore album downfall that so often characterizes one-hit fade
outs. Alternating between songs off the new album and their first release, "Carnavas," the band unleashed their
unique sound of distorted guitars layers and raspy vocals on songs such as "Catch and Release" and "Little
Lovers so Polite. And while calls for hit "Lazy Eye" from the crowd may have been premature, fans that had
disregarded Morrissey and Girl Talk to see the intriguing quartet were captivated with everything from drum
mer Chris Guanlao's head-high cymbal to bassist Nikki Monninger's girl-next-door sweetness — a direct con
trast to her overpowering bass lines. Playing with the energy and verve of Coachella veterans, Silversun Pickups
did everything to justify their set time and solidify themselves as one of today's most exciting rock acts
