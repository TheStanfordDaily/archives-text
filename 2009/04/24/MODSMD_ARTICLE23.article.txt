In 2007, Lupe Fiasco made his Coachella debut with his hit album "Food & Liquor." Two years
later, he made it back to the main stage, this time opening with his 20()f> hit "Kick, Push," and build
k ing up to his smash hit "Superstar."
Performing this year with a live band instead of as a Df, Fiasco had the crowd dancing and

singing along. Part of the reason Lupe Fiasco's set was so fantastic was his ability to perform — the best
musicians can be terrible performers, and the best performers can be terrible musicians — but when it
comes to concerts, at the end of the day the crowd wants to see a performance. Last weekend, Lupe did not
disappoint.
His performance was intense; he had incredibly high energy, and, though it was a 4 p.m. performance,
he was definitely capable of attracting a crowd. After a few songs ("Kick, Push" was performed without main
stage speakers, but that wasn't his fault), it seemed the crowd was sold. The crowd favorite had to have been
cither "Go Go Gadget Flow" or "Hip-Hop Saved My Life," but picking just one from this set list definitely
proves difficult. Regardless, Lupe's performance definitely provides a newfound respect for hip-hop.
