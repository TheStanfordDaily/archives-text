# Girl Talk

In the past couple of years, this mash-up
artist has become widely well known for his
concerts — Girl Talk, or Greg Gillis, shows up with a
waterproof laptop and nothing else, inviting fans up on
stage and thriving on the sweat pouring from the fans.
However, the traditional, wildly popular concert that Girl
Talk is known for is not what he gave at this year's Coachella.
Held in the Sahara tent, which was designed for the
dance artists, the Girl Talk stage was sparsely set. The crowd
was incredibly restless and shoved more than at any other set
attended this year.
But the dance party element of the Girl Talk concert was
lost for multiple reasons. Generally, Girl Talk gives the stage
up to the audience and acts merely as a DJ for the dance party.
But this time, with a giant security rail at the front ot the

stage, the crowd wound up pushing toward the front most of
the time, destroying anyone's chances of dancing. Instead ot
having the crowd dancing around him, Girl Talk used VIP
fans from backstage to dance in front of the group.
To incite excitement, stagehands used motor-propelled
sticks to shoot toilet paper into the crowd, but instead of
being fun, this was just disgusting.
Toward the end of the show, Girl Talk clearly decided to
turn it around. He began displaying new mash-ups that were
unfamiliar to the audience, yet still highly danceable. He
threw out his blow-up decorations into in the audience and
danced on the table. However, when it all came down to it, a
massive, shoving pit and audience disconnectedness made
Girl Talk just a guy pressing buttons on a laptop.
