You won't find a "Canadian punk rock" section at your local rccord store, but that
doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

Still relatively unknown, Billy Talent has been together since 1999. On Saturday, they made it
to the Coachella main stage, albeit at 1:30 in the afternoon before most people had arrived. The
band was grateful and relished the opportunity to be our "morning cup of coffee for the rest of the day."
They opened the show with the song "Devil in a Midnight Mass," the first track from their second
album, and continued to play songs from "Billy Talent II," such as "Surrender," "Fallen Leaves" and
"Where is the Line?" Considering their early performance, I was fairly impressed by the energy. Then
again, I am biased as a long-time fan. Between songs, Ben praised Paul McCartney, who had performed
the night before. When a fan booed, he asked, "Are you booing

Paul McCartney? You should be hung." He also made fun of his
teenage fans' ska dancing, or "skanking," as they call it, which
consists of pushing each other around while spinning in cir
cles. They brought it back to their earlier days, ending with
"Try Honesty,""Lies" and "River Below."
Billy Talent earned the WTF Award in this year's Coachella
forum, given to the band that doesn't generally fit with this
year's lineup. As a result, many Conor Oberst and Fleet Foxes
fans wandered over to the performance, nodding their heads
quietly, while less than a dozen of us (myself included) head
banged to their performances, rhythmically throwing rock
hands as a sign of approval and appreciation. Frontman Ben
Kowalewicz noticed, asking, "Where are your rock hands? Rock
hands are the greatest honor a band can receive." Perhaps with
a little more exposure, Billy Talent will be back in a couple of
years just like The Killers, who were only featured in 2004 but
were headlining on Saturday night this year.
