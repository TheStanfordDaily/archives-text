Unlike Girl Talk, the DJ set that blew the crowd
-away at this year s Coachella was TRVSDI

AM. Comprised of Travis Barker of Blink* 182 fame
and DJ AM, one of the most in-demand disc jockeys right
now, TRVSDJ-AM played for an enormous crowd at the
Sahara tent. The duo recently suffered a tragic plane crash,
with both miraculously surviving, despite horrible third
degree burns. But during this show, it was impossible to tell
that either had recently been through near-death experiences.
The show was set up like a high-octane type of call and
response. Travis punctuated DJ AM's mash-ups with his
incredible beats on percussion. 1 can safely say that Iravis
Barker is one of the best drummers of our generation — he
never stopped drumming hard the entire set, even with sweat
pouring down his bare, tattoo-covered chest.
That's not to say that L)I AM was overshadowed by the
prodigy. His skill on the turntables was undeniable, and his
stage presence was absolutely magnetic. He cheered on Travis's
solos with the crowd and showed a high degree of excitement
when changing beats and songs. He danced and sang along,
but all the while never took his hands off of the computer or
turntables.
This vear s Coachella without TRVSI)J-AM simply would
not have been as incredible. They gave it their all and certainly
did not disappoint the massive crowd with their thrilling,
exhilarating and kickass performance.
