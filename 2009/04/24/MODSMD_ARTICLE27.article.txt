Seattle-based Fleet Foxes took the Outdoor Stage
Saturday night against the picturesque background of
sunsets and palm trees, matching the peaceful setting with
their serene and folksy tunes. Drawing from their self-titled
debut album and their EF "Sun Giant," the band was casual in
between songs, joking about beer and good-heartedly asking
the audience for song suggestions.
Making the most of their live setting and the four vocal
ists in the band of five, Fleet Foxes opened the set with the a
cappella opening to "Sun Giant," their voices floating out over
the audience in soothing harmonies. The first few songs
blended into each other, and their voices and instruments
lulled the audience into relaxation, shuffling through other
tracks such as "Sun It Rises" and "Drops in the River."
Occasionally, dribbles of Thievery Corporation would
float over from the main stage in the silence between songs.
Not to be outdone. Fleet Foxes upped into some of its more
energetic songs, encouraging the audience to sing along dur
ing "Ragged Wood." Although the performance was simple
and sweet — not many changes from the album — the live
setting really let the band's qualities shine. While the voices arc
muted on the recordings, they lit up the microphones onstage,
and the band's feel on the faster-paced songs was upped to
something even more energetic — a welcome change that
made for a satisfying and still intriguing set.
