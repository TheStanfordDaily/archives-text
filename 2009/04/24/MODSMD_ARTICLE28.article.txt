# Coachella Fashion

This year at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, hipsters took the polo
fields by storm. They came in droves, clad in American Apparel and Ray-Ban
Wayfarers. Sarcasm aside, the fashion scene at this year's Coachella displayed a lot
of what you are going to be seeing this summer. Neon, plaid; fringe, feathers and studs
were all were prominent at this year's hipster fashion show.

Une or the most popular looks tins year was
the flashback to the '80s, with girls arid guys clad in
neon arid "Lets Get Physical" garb. I guarantee that
American Apparel sells more lame and neon this
time of year than any other season. Shorts were
high-waisted, headbands were prominent and
neon glasses adorned nearly every face. Arguably,
1 most people overdid this look. When outside of

festival grounds, Intermission recommends you
tread lightly when dabbling in this look — a little
goes a long way. It's a terrible idea to go out in
public clad entirely in highlighter colored span
dex. Rather, add a punch of color to an other
wise simple outfit with either colorful sunglass-

es or a headband.
On the other side of the fashion spectrum, the
folksy look was also very popular at this year's
festival. Sundresses and rompers (basically a

shirt and shorts attached) in paisley, folksy prints
accessorized with feather earrings and fringed shoulder bags made an
enormous showing. Rope headbands added that extra dash of hippie.
Those who found the flowv look unflattering found that adding a
woven belt around the waist visibly improved their figure. The folk look
is another one that can be a little bit dangerous .. . when trying out this
trend, don't be fooled by the loose fabrics and assume that they are flat
tering on everyone. They aren't. Make sure you tailor your dress or

romper to flatter your curves rather than hide them.
Another enormously popular look this year was the "hippie rocker."
This is a mixture between the aforementioned folk look, and the leather and studs tradition
ally worn by rock stars. It was hard to stomach seeing so many people in this look, seeing as
it was 10t) degrees, but I digress. This look involves frayed denim shorts (men and women)
with leather vests, gloves or headbands. Metallics and link embellishments are a nice touch

to this sort of outfit. Slouchy black boots or metallic
gladiator sandals are the ideal footwear to achieve the
'hippie rocker.' Don't forget the hippie element — add
black or white feathers where possible, and a black
fringed shoulder bag to complete the look.

Coachella is not just a music
festival — it's also a con
gregation of fashionistas
every year. Everywhere
you looked, you saw the

lifestyles of the hip and
the famous strolling
around the fields. The
three looks mentioned
were arguably the most
popular this year, but

Intermission wants to
warn you one last time:
moderation. We don't
want our stylish readers
looking like they tried too
hard and got drunk on
Ray-Bans.
