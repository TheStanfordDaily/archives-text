Robert Downey, Jr. is so hot right now. After
soaring to new heights in "Iron Man" (2008)
and pushing comedic boundaries in "Tropic
Thunder" (2008), Downey has seemingly become
Hollywood's next A-list actor. Even though Downey is
no stranger to Tinsel Town, it appears he's been win
ning over the public's affection as of recently. He has
done this not only by making use of his devilishly
charming good looks but also proving his Oscar-wor
thy acting chops. You can always tell how great an
actor truly is when they can make themselves shine in
a lackluster film.
Downey's latest cinema outing, "The Soloist," is a
good example of this. Helmed by acclaimed director
loe Wright ("Pride & Prejudice" (2005), "Atonement"
[2007]) and co-starring Jamie Foxx, this film seems
like it has all the basic elements for a great drama flick.
Based on a true story, "The Soloist" spins the tale of a
Los Angeles reporter (Downey) who becomes inter
ested in the life of a schizophrenic, Julliard-trained
homeless musician (Foxx). However, despite the film's
immediate credentials, the story fails to satisfy and
instead becomes muddled in the numerous agendas
the movie is trying to push. At first, you think the film
is just about a down-and-out musician, then the next
thing you know, it becomes a campaign to spread
awareness of homelessness in Los Angeles. Then, as if
that isn't enough, the film takes another twist and tries
its hand at tackling the often-debated issues sur
rounding psychiatric treatment.
The overextended scope of "The Soloist" is by far
my biggest gripe with the film. I'm not saying one film
can't tackle multiple issues — it can, but only if done
right. As "The Soloist" starts off and slowly progresses,
issue after issue is raised — opening yet more
Pandora's boxes. Raising so many social issues not
only makes the film feel a lot longer than it actually is
(approximately 109 minutes), but it also obligates the
film to address and resolve every issue that it throws
out, which is impossible under such a short time span.
Instead, "The Soloist" either quickly prescribes its own
solution to the problems or just glosses over them,
giving the audience a strange unsettling feeling toward
the film's end. This feeling of unsettlement can actual
ly be a good thing, since it can help to better raise
awareness about an issue, but at the same time, it can
also negatively impact the development of some of the
movie's most basic elements, like the characters and
overall plot.

Touching on this notion of characters, the acting
in "The Soloist" is phenomenal, and I would not have
expected any less from both Foxx and Downey. Foxx
seems to shine in musically-charged dramas — think
"Ray" (2004) and "Dreamgirls" (2006) — and this
time around, his portrayal as a damaged musical
prodigy is deeply convincing. Playing a glib reporter is
also a role that Downey is familiar with; he played a
similar role in "Zodiac" (2007), which was also based
off of a true story. Downey and Foxx mesh fluidly with
one another, and when their characters on screen
express genuine care and sincerity for the other, audi
ence members can't help but be touched.
Besides the acting, director Wright makes some
interesting creative decisions that both enhance and
detract from the film's look and style. On the plus side,
the film makes use of constant long shots of the city of
Los Angeles, usually done with musical accompani
ment. This technique gives the crowded city of L.A. a
life and rhythm of its own and highlights one of the
film's themes: Music can be found everywhere.
Another stylistic choice that I appreciated was the use
of voice-over narration by several of the film's charac
ters, usually done in conjunction with one of
Downey's newspaper articles being read in the movie.
This element gives the film a quirky narrative appeal
akin to the voice-over narration in the Will Ferrel film
"Stranger than Fiction" (2006).
Of course at the same time, there were a handful
of stylistic choices that were overdone and therefore
detracted from the "artsy" experience that it was try
ing to create. These come in the form of sometimes
awkward imagery during some of the film's musical
numbers — two that jump to mind involve pigeons
flying and abstract colors that look more like a screen
saver than a filmic sequence.
When all of the music is over, the title "The
Soloist" just does not seem to cut it. There's nothing
really "solo" about a film built heavily on the relation
ship between the characters played by Foxx and
Downey, as well as the myriad of issues that the film
raises. The film is not fantastic by any means but it
does contain some heart-warming messages and a few
standout performances that could make the trip to the
theater worthwhile, especially if you're a major Robert
Downey Jr. fan like myself.
