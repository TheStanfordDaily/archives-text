# Stanford grad holds reading in bookstore

### 
Although Karan Mahajan '05 is only 24 years old, he's already pub
lished his first novel, Family Planning. Last night, he gave a well
attended reading at the Stanford Bookstore during which he shared
his first one-and-a-half chapters.
Mahajan's writing comes alive through his radiant descriptions and
extended metaphors. In introducing his characters — a New Delhi politi
cian, his constantly pregnant wife and their thirteen children, the oldest of
whom can't understand why his parents arc still having sex — Mahajan
pokes gentle fun at political issues in India.
During his talk, Mahajan also poked gentle fun at himself.
"I'm probably the most formally dressed person on the Stanford cam
pus right now," he said, adding that he thinks last night was the only time
he's ever worn a button-down shirt at Stanford.
Adam Johnson, a lecturer in the English department, introduced
Mahajan, calling him "devilishly handsome" and "warmly funny," able to
"recognize something human in someone else."
Family Planning is not particularly autobiographical. Mahajan has only
one sibling, so his immediate family is nothing like that of his protagonists.
However, he said he does understand the "large crowds" that are
extended families in India.
At Stanford, Mahajan majored in English and economics — and his
current job situation combines both skill sets. On a typical weekday, he
wakes up at 5:30 a.m. to write for a couple of hours. Then, he does a few
exercises before heading off to work in New York City's strategic planning
department. He also writes on the weekends.
"That all adds up to not having a life," he deduced.
Mahajan grew up in New Delhi, India, and started writing creatively
during his senior year at Stanford. He has written for The San Francisco
Chronicle, Granta and The New York Sun.
