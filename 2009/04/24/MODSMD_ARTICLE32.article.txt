# Roxy's 11 ProFros to take advantage of this weekend
## 
### 
Oh, Admit Weekend. So many new beginnings for all those inno
cent, little ProFros out there — but for Roxy, it's all about the happy
endings. When else can she have her pick of so much young, fresh
meat?
Really, Admit Weekend is all about Stanford whoring itself out
to the young and impressionable high schoolers. Forget "commit
ment" — that's to be decided when you're back home. For now, it's
all about taking full advantage of the two- or three-night stand that
is Admit Weekend.
Of course, Roxy is more than willing to show some lost, little
ProFros the way around Stanford. In particular, here are a few
ProFros that she's on the lookout for:
1. Kid choosing between MIT and Stanford
With that engineering mindset, he probably has the technical skill
to build you a nice sex hammock. Passion be damned, Roxy doesn't
mind getting down to the mechanics of it all and developing some
friction.
2. Kid choosing between the Ivy League and
Stanford
If he's so much of a "stiff" that he does end up going to Harvard or
Yale, Roxy doesn't mind working that "stiffie" out so he has some
good stories to share of that "wild" Stanford place he almost went
to.

3. Kid choosing
between
Swarthmore and
Stanford
He probably has a few too

many philosophical thoughts for
Roxy, and he's way too into the
humanities. Then again, he might be
able to get way into this human.

4. Dorm cheers kid
Some ProFros are WAY too into those dorm cheers. It isn't even
NSO yet, and some kids are dying with Branner spirit (hah, good
luck with that next year, suckers). Still, Roxy enjoys anyone who's
willing to moan in public. Triple-O, oh yes.
5. Stanford apparel kid
This kid just spent $100 at The Stanford Store (God help him if it
was $200 at the Bookstore) and is wearing a Stanford shirt,
Stanford sweatshirt, Stanford hat, Stanford shorts, Stanford sandals
and Stanford sunglasses. Still, Roxy can't help but wonder what's
underneath all those layers of Cardinal gear. lust wait until she gets
her teeth on those Stanford boxers.

6. "Cool" kid
You know who I'm talking about. This kid just spent $200
on two Abercrombic outfits — one for Friday and one for
Saturday — just so people might actually think he's cool in
college, because we all know that didn't work out so well in
high school. Though Roxy doesn't have a taste for the fake
douche bag, she does like to add to her virgin total.
7. Nerdy quiet kid
This kid probably just saw the outside world for the first
time during his high school career. Roxy will have a few
things to teach him, but hey, he's obviously a good student.
8. Kid with helicopter parents
If Roxy's able to steal him away for even a five-minute
quickie, she'll be able to satisfy his needs. Thank goodness
for those "admit-only" events.
9. Rich foreign kids
Having paid a few thousand dollars to fly out here just for
the weekend, you know these kids are looking for a little
something more to make it all worth it. Roxy has the
goods, though, for anyone who's, uh . . . loaded.
10. Legacy kids
This kid walks around like he already owns the place, as if
he's Leland Stanford, Jr. — okay, maybe John Arrillaga, lr.
Able to claim a few dorms, buildings and events in Stanford
history as a part of his family legacy, Roxy would like to
add herself to the list. Bring your daddy along, legacy boy.
11. Kid who's read the brochure 2,000 times
This kid gets off just watching the Admit Web site load
each time he checks it out. Sure, he knows all there is to
know about how many bikes there arc on campus, about
the Draw and even about FMOTQ. Hell, he probably even
reads The Daily more than you do. Well, he sure doesn't
know Roxy until he's experienced her . ..
