# PEREZ HILTON
## 
### 
With the Internet these
days anyone with some
imagination can claim 15
minutes of fame, no matter
your age ("Charlie Bit Me!").
Yet fame has become lasting for some
of these Internet celebs, helping them
transition into real world celebrities.
For those of us who have dreams of
grandeur, what are the pointers that
we can take from people who have
successfully made names for them
selves (good or bad) through the
Internet?

Of course we cannot talk about the conversion from
eFame to real fame without including the blogger-turned
household-name Perez Hihon. (Real name: Mario
Armando Lavandeira, Jr. â€” who knew?) Known for his
ruthless techniques of outing Hollywood names, contro
versial mockery of celebrities and brash attitude, Perez
Hilton is an extremely polarizing figure. What can a
Stanford student possibly learn from Perez? I don't rec
ommend you go online right now and start your own blog
revealing every single piece of gossip and secret you know
about everyone at Stanford. No, what Perez shows us is
that having a blog that has a defined direction and an atti
tude to match can definitely take you places.
