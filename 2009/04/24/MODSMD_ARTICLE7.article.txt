# Ali Larter talks about the femme fatale and "Obsessed"
## 
### 
When one thinks about the female celebrities who
attract the geeks, nerds and science fiction lovers
out there, it is impossible not to consider Ali
Larter. Starring in the hit television show "Heroes" and
movies like "Resident Evil" and "Final Destination," Ali Larter
is constantly out there kicking ass in tight clothing, saving the
world from zombies and the like. Her new movie, "Obsessed,"
has a very different storyline than other films Ali has starred
in. "Obsessed" is about a couple, played by Idris Elban and
Beyonce Knowles, that is stalked by the obsessive (hence the
title) and psychotic Lisa Sheridan (Ali Larter). Intermission
had the chance to listen in as journalists around the country
posed questions to Ali about her new movie.
The State Press: My question is, when you first read the script
and everything, what immediately attracted you to this char
acter?
Ali Larter (AL): The first thing that attracted me was the idea
of, you know, was getting a chance to play a femme fatal. I
just, you know, with movies for me, the movies that I loved
were Barbara Stanwyck in "Double Indemnity," Rita
Hayworth in "Gilda." The real classic femme fatals are one of
the reasons I always wanted to get into this business. And this
movie is really a kiss more to that kind of sexy thriller genre
of Rebecca De Mornay in "Hand that Rocks the Cradle," and
"Fatal Attraction." So, you know, getting the chance to play
that really delicious, you know, female villain was my first
draw.
And then, after that, when I found out that Idris Elba was
doing it, I just, I have so much respect for him. He was incred
ible playing Stringer Bell on "The Wire." And Beyonce. who,
you know, 1 think is just an incredible talent.

Stormy Peitro: What I wanted to talk to you about was how
does this role compare to some of the others you've taken? I
mean, you're most well known for being on "Heroes" and
"Final Destination." What was it like to actually switch over and
be the villain for once?
AL: Well, you know, I'm usually the one beating people up, so
this movie really humbled me a little bit. I had to take one for
the team. You know, this movie differs in the fact that I really
do, I think of her, you know, she's definitely in the vein of the
classic femme fatal, and that is what drew me to this movie.
Also, the fact that she really gets lost in her psychosis, and to
understand what happened to this woman and how she could
kind of go down this path of believing one thing, when anoth
er thing is probably true. For me, it was really just kind of inter
esting to figure out the complexities of her and what makes her
tick.
Then, also, it's really a three-hander in this. You get to see
the three different points of view of people in the same situa
tion, so 1 thought that that was an interesting, fresh take on this.
And also that the movie is color blind and not once is race
mentioned, and that, to me, and I think with Idris

also, is one of the things that we
| found most appealing about it.
' The Oracle: My question was,
in this movie you have a fight scene
with Beyonce that they mentioned.
What kind of training did you have to
do in preparation for that?

AI.: We do a lot of physical stuff on
"Heroes," and it seems that I always end
up getting in some kind of fight in what
ever role I'm playing, so we start off with
getting the best stunt doubles that we can

find, and ! have an amazing girl
that I work with. Hut the other
side is that I also like to do as
much as I can. I think that you
can really tell when the actor is
in there, so we spent about a
week really breaking it down,
and we just had fun. It was like,
you hit twice. Well, I'm going
to hit you three times, and we
just really had joy in it.
And, for me, watching
Beyonce charge you is one of
my favorite moments, so I real
ly hope that comes across on
the screen that people really see
that we tried to make it so it's
believable and not tall into all
the cliches, but, at the same
time, deliver what the movie

promises to deliver.
North By Northwest: One of the things that I was curious
about, what did you find to be the most difficult aspect of your
character, and what did you like best about portraying her on
screen?
AL: The most difficult thing was that probably 1 was shooting
"Heroes" at the same time, so for a couple months, I was work
ing seven days a week, like 12 hours a day, and that was by far
the most trying thing because I'd be going from one character
and kind of one tone and hopping into another one and some
times I would be driving from one set to the next. For me, it was
just a very trying time. It was also that I was so excited to get to
play this kind of a take on the classic femme fatal character. I
love watching these movies. I love being an audience in these
kind of sexy thriller, you know, that genre and "Hand that
Rocks the Cradle," "Fatal Attraction," and this movie is really
kind of an homage to those.
And to get to play her, you know, she's really a character
that is delusional and the things that have happened to her, you
know, and figuring out how to keep a mystery to her, but also
make the audience feel for this girl and understand that, for her,
it was only about love and how things that people say can be
misinterpreted. And to me, that's really the point of this movie.
I mean, it's this imaginary office romance that has disastrous
consequences, and we really try to dissect the three different
points of view and how each person reacts to it.
The Daily Axe: I wanted to know — you talked about you liked
playing femme fatal characters. I want to know how that corre
lates in your plans for the future. What are you working on
right now?
AL: I'm about to actually go start a movie with Fd Burns, which
I'm really excited about. She's not a femme fatal, but ... actu
ally, she could ... in a way ... there are slices of it. For me, it's
like I just love intense women. 1 love strong women. I love
women that go after what they want and don't always worry
about the consequences. There's a free spirited nature in that
that I really am drawn to and a driven side of it too. Yes, I just
really love playing those girls.
In the future, there are lots of different things I want to do.
I actually would love to do a comedy. I would love to laugh. You
know, when you're on the set of movies like this, days where
we're shooting the fight scene couldn't be more amazing. We're
just having a blast, but days where we're actually shooting
scenes where there's this intense altercation between me and
Derek, I mean these are really difficult scenes to do, and they're
painful, and so there's really two sides of it, so I think that I'm
ready to lighten up a bit and maybe give me a little romance.
Give me a little lightness.
"Obsessed" opens in theatres nationwide on April 24.
