# TIM LEE YOUTUBE SYMPHONY
## 
### 
You may have heard of the You Tube Symphony
Orchestra, the online phenomenon that created a sym
phony out of musicians from around the world, of all
ages and levels of expertise. From the 15-year-old Canadian
cellist to the French horn-playing IT professional from the
U.K., all 95 musicians gathered and finally met in New York
City last week to play at none other than Carnegie Hall.
Timothy Lee, a student at the Graduate School oi Business
(GSB), was the mastermind behind this initiative. Intermission
sat down with him this past week to talk about the origins ot
the project, how it developed into larger-than-life proportions
and the awesome people he met along the way.
intermission (i): How did you come up with the idea of creat
ing a You Tube Symphony Orchestra?
Timothy Lee (TL): Well, first, I noticed two things going on in
You Tube about a year and a half ago, at the end of 2007. First,
people were becoming incredibly famous through You Tube.
This is a trend we hadn't seen before — the time it takes to
become well-known has shortened considerably. For example,
six months to a year after becoming famous online, people
could land recording contracts or major deals. Secondly, 1
noticed that a lot of mixing and collaboration was going on

online on a small scale. For example, there is a great video on
You Tube called "Every Car You Chase," which is a great mix of
"Chasing Cars" by Snow Patrol" and "Every Move You Make"
by Sting. People were combining soundtracks, creating mash
ups on You Tube. But it was on a small scale, just one or two
videos mixed together in creative ways.
This was all a new form of creativity that we hadn't seen
before — this talent discovery and online collaboration. I
wondered whether we could take it to the next level, use plat
forms like You Tube to encourage online artistic collaboration.
Out of that idea grew the You Tube Symphony Orchestra.
I worked at Google at the time I had the idea for this. I
knew the person who was head of You Tube marketing and I
explained the idea to him. He eventually became the
spokesperson for this initiative, which was great because he
always thought big. We agreed that this could be something
game-changing. From there, it just took off: We presented the
idea to a few hundred people and there was great reception —
the idea gained momentum internally. Slowly, a team emerged
with people from all areas of Google. We were able to get peo
ple seriously interested in this initiative, even when it wasn't
their core job.
(i): What did you do to publicize this initiative?
TL: A huge amount of work has gone in since the original idea.
It's amazing how a team came together around the world to
support this innovative idea. We adopted a strategy where we
allowed each country to attack how they wanted to approach
this program. We contacted the local Google team and market
ing managers around the world, and they had their own ideas
of how to publicize this. For example, in Korea, the Google
team decided to go and find pop stars, actresses, actors, etc.
who would support this initiative. There, they got Song Hye
Kyo [a famous Korean actess] to be the ambassador for this
project — there are videos of her speaking on behalf of the
events. In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra
played the piece that Tan Dun wrote for this symphony in all
traditional Chinese instruments. Within Google, we had peo
ple pushing the envelope, sorting out every last detail.
(i): Tell us about some of the more interesting video submis
sions that you received.
TL: Well, we had 10 submissions from Azerbaijan and 10 from
Kazakhstan. On the You Tube Web page, we got a surprising
number of hits from Azerbaijan. We got submissions from a
total of 70 countries. Of course, we got submissions from beat
boxers. One of the ladies who auditioned and was chosen to be
in the symphony played the piano — but her specialty was
playing toy pianos.
(i): How did you pick the ones that made it?
TL: Well, we partnered with over 40 different organizations
around the world. A subset of those helped us with judging —
the London Symphony Orchestra, Sydney Symphony, Hong

Kong Philharmonic Orchestra, just to name a tew. I his was
great because this means that we got the best professionals in
each section and instrument to choose from the auditions.
They helped us whittle it down to 200 finalists, and the final
200 videos were uploaded to You Tube for the community vot
ing.
(i): You got Michael Tilson Thomas of the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra to conduct the You Tube Symphony
Orchestra. Did he have any say in the final 200 contestants?
Why did you choose him for this role?
TL.: Michael Tilson Thomas had some artistic say in the for
mation of the orchestra — he knew how to put together an
orchestra. In many ways, Michael was the perfect conductor
for an initiative like this. He was always trying to push the fore
front of technology — how music would be perceived using
; technology. Secondly, he was used to working with musicians
from a wide range of backgrounds, from diverse ages, skill lev
els and expertise. Thirdly, he's not just the conductor of the
San Francisco Orchestra — he's also the director of the New
World Symphony.
Watching Michael in rehearsal is amazing. He has this
ability to pinpoint what musicians need to work on in pieces
and to bring out the best in every musician at every level
which was great, because in the You Tube Symphony, our musi
i cians ranged from aspiring amateurs to the very top.
(i): From the very beginning, how did you get people and
i organizations around the world to help you and become
involved?
I WONDERED WH ETHER WE
COULD...USE PLATFORMS LIKE
YOUTUBE TO ENCOURAGE
