# TIM LEE YOUTUBE SYMPHONY
## 
### 
You may have heard of the You Tube Symphony
Orchestra, the online phenomenon that created a sym
phony out of musicians from around the world, of all
ages and levels of expertise. From the 15-year-old Canadian
cellist to the French horn-playing IT professional from the
U.K., all 95 musicians gathered and finally met in New York
City last week to play at none other than Carnegie Hall.
Timothy Lee, a student at the Graduate School oi Business
(GSB), was the mastermind behind this initiative. Intermission
sat down with him this past week to talk about the origins ot
the project, how it developed into larger-than-life proportions
and the awesome people he met along the way.
intermission (i): How did you come up with the idea of creat
ing a You Tube Symphony Orchestra?
Timothy Lee (TL): Well, first, I noticed two things going on in
You Tube about a year and a half ago, at the end of 2007. First,
people were becoming incredibly famous through You Tube.
This is a trend we hadn't seen before — the time it takes to
become well-known has shortened considerably. For example,
six months to a year after becoming famous online, people
could land recording contracts or major deals. Secondly, 1
noticed that a lot of mixing and collaboration was going on

online on a small scale. For example, there is a great video on
You Tube called "Every Car You Chase," which is a great mix of
"Chasing Cars" by Snow Patrol" and "Every Move You Make"
by Sting. People were combining soundtracks, creating mash
ups on You Tube. But it was on a small scale, just one or two
videos mixed together in creative ways.
This was all a new form of creativity that we hadn't seen
before — this talent discovery and online collaboration. I
wondered whether we could take it to the next level, use plat
forms like You Tube to encourage online artistic collaboration.
Out of that idea grew the You Tube Symphony Orchestra.
I worked at Google at the time I had the idea for this. I
knew the person who was head of You Tube marketing and I
explained the idea to him. He eventually became the
spokesperson for this initiative, which was great because he
always thought big. We agreed that this could be something
game-changing. From there, it just took off: We presented the
idea to a few hundred people and there was great reception —
the idea gained momentum internally. Slowly, a team emerged
with people from all areas of Google. We were able to get peo
ple seriously interested in this initiative, even when it wasn't
their core job.
(i): What did you do to publicize this initiative?
TL: A huge amount of work has gone in since the original idea.
It's amazing how a team came together around the world to
support this innovative idea. We adopted a strategy where we
allowed each country to attack how they wanted to approach
this program. We contacted the local Google team and market
ing managers around the world, and they had their own ideas
of how to publicize this. For example, in Korea, the Google
team decided to go and find pop stars, actresses, actors, etc.
who would support this initiative. There, they got Song Hye
Kyo [a famous Korean actess] to be the ambassador for this
project — there are videos of her speaking on behalf of the
events. In Hong Kong, the Hong Kong Chinese Orchestra
played the piece that Tan Dun wrote for this symphony in all
traditional Chinese instruments. Within Google, we had peo
ple pushing the envelope, sorting out every last detail.
(i): Tell us about some of the more interesting video submis
sions that you received.
TL: Well, we had 10 submissions from Azerbaijan and 10 from
Kazakhstan. On the You Tube Web page, we got a surprising
number of hits from Azerbaijan. We got submissions from a
total of 70 countries. Of course, we got submissions from beat
boxers. One of the ladies who auditioned and was chosen to be
in the symphony played the piano — but her specialty was
playing toy pianos.
(i): How did you pick the ones that made it?
TL: Well, we partnered with over 40 different organizations
around the world. A subset of those helped us with judging —
the London Symphony Orchestra, Sydney Symphony, Hong

Kong Philharmonic Orchestra, just to name a tew. I his was
great because this means that we got the best professionals in
each section and instrument to choose from the auditions.
They helped us whittle it down to 200 finalists, and the final
200 videos were uploaded to You Tube for the community vot
ing.
(i): You got Michael Tilson Thomas of the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra to conduct the You Tube Symphony
Orchestra. Did he have any say in the final 200 contestants?
Why did you choose him for this role?
TL.: Michael Tilson Thomas had some artistic say in the for
mation of the orchestra — he knew how to put together an
orchestra. In many ways, Michael was the perfect conductor
for an initiative like this. He was always trying to push the fore
front of technology — how music would be perceived using
; technology. Secondly, he was used to working with musicians
from a wide range of backgrounds, from diverse ages, skill lev
els and expertise. Thirdly, he's not just the conductor of the
San Francisco Orchestra — he's also the director of the New
World Symphony.
Watching Michael in rehearsal is amazing. He has this
ability to pinpoint what musicians need to work on in pieces
and to bring out the best in every musician at every level
which was great, because in the You Tube Symphony, our musi
i cians ranged from aspiring amateurs to the very top.
(i): From the very beginning, how did you get people and
i organizations around the world to help you and become
involved?
I WONDERED WH ETHER WE
COULD...USE PLATFORMS LIKE
YOUTUBE TO ENCOURAGE

TL: Well, the very first set of phone calls I made were cold-calls
to some of the top organizations — Julliard's school, Carnegie
Hall. I wasn't expecting a warm response; I didn't know what
they would make of this new idea. What 1 found was that,
responses started becoming quite typical after a while. I would
call people and give them .1 10-minute summary of this initia
tive. Then they would ask a lot of the same questions — for
example, would the sound quality on You Tube be good
enough? What if the webcams don't pick up the frequencies of
piccolo and bass? How will people keep in time? Also, different
places around the world have different pitch levels.
Once we got past those questions, the response was almost
unilaterally, "Wow this is crazy, but it sounds very exciting."
Each of these institutes had its own idea of how this could shift
the whole classical music industry, bring a new spark to the
industry.
The London Symphony Orchestra approached this from
their own angle: education. They uploaded all these master
classes to encourage music education. At the beginning I just
wanted input from these music professionals. Eventually, once
we had established a dialogue, 1 asked them to support the ini
tiative in different ways. I think if you went around to these
different symphony halls around the world at the time, you
would have found posters and advertisements for auditions in
their programs and on the walls.

(i): Tell me about the logistics of the Carnegie performance.
How long did the chosen musicians stay there? How did the
performance go?
TL: Well, the concert was on Wednesday, April 15. The level at
which the players performed was just incredible. Some of the
winners didn't even speak a word of English, had never been to
New York. But as soon as the conductor hit the first downbeat
on the first rehearsal on Monday morning, all of them played
in tune, together, in synch. This was incredible — these people
had never met each other before, didn't even speak the same
language and were completely varied in age — yet they were
able to communicate through the common language of music.
Most of the winners arrived over Easter eeekend and they
rehearsed from Monday morning until mid-day on
Wednesday. So they had, in total, two and a half days to prac
tice. It was very intense, straight-day rehearsals. Everyone
worked incredibly hard in all of those three days.
In terms of the pieces played, they were very diverse. It
wasn't a typical classical music concert at all; we had a wide
variety of pieces, ranging from Mozart to Brahms to
Tchaikovsky to newer pieces by a DJ/composer. The program
was designed specifically to show the diversity of classical
music.
(i): Do you think this You Tube Symphony will make any musi
cians famous?

TL: I think it already has. There was a violin teacher from
Bermuda in the bunch. He was a very accomplished violinist,
but winning a place at the You Tube Symphony Orchestra has
energized the entire country — everyone there was very proud
of him. He's become a bit of a local hero in Bermuda.
One of our concert masters is actually a jazz violinist from
Mexico; and another violinist from Romania, near
Transylvania, has been in the Romanian spotlight since he
managed to join the You Tube Symphony Orchestra. This is
just the beginning; what these people do with their music
careers will be very interesting to watch.
(i): How did you get Oscar-nominated composer Tan Dun to
compose a five-minute piece specifically for the You Tube
Symphony Orchestra?
TL: It was all very lucky, actually. 1 managed to find out
through a classical music agent that he would be laid over in
Amsterdam from morning until this specific time in after
noon. So, I got someone from the Google Amsterdam office to
pick him up and drive him to the Google office, where 1 had a
one-hour video conference with him. 1 told him about the
concept of the project and from the very beginning he under
stood the possibilities of this idea. He was very excited — his
eyes were lighting up the entire conversation.
Once we were done talking, he was saying, I want to do
this. Obviously he had one major prior arrangement — he was
a special consultant to and composer for the Olympic Games
— but he said he would prioritize our project afterwards and
try to meet the tight deadline. After that, we met once again in
Germany. 1 sat down with him and described the project in
greater detail and gave him the context he needed to create a
piece to fit this initiative.
(i): Do you have future plans for the You Tube Symphony
Orchestra? What's the next step, if there is one planned?
TL: The original intent of putting this together was to set off a
new trend in online artistic creation. This was a demonstration
of the ways in which technology could be used to get people to
work together and create new things. From here, it can take
any direction. There are no plans as of yet from the organizers.
We'd just been working to make it to the concert. But in terms
of online collaboration — there is no question that this will
have a future. This will definitely have a life of its own; the
online platform is there — we've just shown that technology
can be used artistically on a major scale.
