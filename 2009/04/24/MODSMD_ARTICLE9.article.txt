# RESTAURANT REViEW
## Modern Vietnamese in style at Xanh 
### 
By many standards, Castro Street in Mountain View
offers cuisine that beats Palo Alto's offerings — at lower
prices, too. At one end of the spectrum are the budget
options like pho and ramen. But Castro Street is good for more
than just a cheap eat, and a prime example is Xanh, a contem
porary Vietnamese restaurant and lounge.
The Xanh experience is eye-catching from the very begin
ning. From the outside, it's hard to miss the name of the
restaurant spelled out in large chrome block letters surround
ed by a halo of blue and white light coming from behind.
Inside, the theme of blue light continues with an impressive
bar, also lit from behind. Adjacent is the sleek lounge, with
abstract decorations and

more of an earth-tone
theme in the lighting

and upholstery. And,
finally, there is the

dining room, which is

a little more subtle, but
is decorated by bits of care-

fully placed light and a wave

pattern on the wall that still
captures the same modern sophis
tication.

Xanh's basic cuisine is Vietnamese,
but the menu clearly shows influences
from other places — especially Japan.
The menu offers something for almost
any appetite provided that you aren't
too much of a

culinary
conser
vative.
To start,

there are
small plates
of rolls that are

geometrically similar to maki but arc more along the lines of a
spring roll in terms of ingredients. The primary fillers arc let
tuce, mint, chives and shallots, and the wrapper is a rice noo
dle, rather than seaweed. Ahi tuna is an option as the main fill
ing, but so are things like duck, shrimp and beef. Any of the
rolls would provide a good opening to a meal thanks to the
bulk of the volume being in the form of light veggies, but with
enough taste from the fish or meat to provide some real flavor.
For other starters, consider the ahi tuna tartare as a small
plate. The presentation is nothing short of dazzling, with a
cone of tuna and garnishes sitting atop a vase of continuously
bubbling water centered on a plate otherwise covered with
wonton chigs on which to spread the tuna. Since just seeing
the dish is possibly worth the price, the actual taste seems like
a bonus. Perhaps it is short of the worlds greatest tartare, but
the ahi is sufficiently fresh and tasty, and the accompaniments
make for an altogether excellent appetizer. The crispy shrimp
clouds, another small plate, are as heavenly as the name would
imply.
Moving into main courses, the main options come in the
form of noodles or meat-based large plates. The prawns with
garlic noodles arc on the simpler side and are presented
accordingly — nothing as extravagant as the tuna tartare. But
the dish does well by not trying to do too much — it offers
nicely cooked shrimp with noodles that are worth eating, even
on their own. The Shaking beef, a mainstay of Vietnamese
cooking (at least in Northern California) is one of the better
renditions in the area, though it once again does not live up to
the standards left by the starters.
The service is probably one of the weaker points at Xanh.
It was certainly not a horror story of incompetence that one
might expect at The Axe and Palm, but the wait to order drinks
and then the meal were a bit longer than they should have
been. Food arrived at a pace perhaps on the slow end of the
acceptable range, and the manner in which plates were placed
and collected was not quite consistent with the prices on the
menu.

The imperfect service, however, was insufficient to ruin
what was otherwise a very good meal. The starters were out
standing, the main courses were still above average, and the
surrounding decor and atmosphere made the outside world
seem boring. This, of course, isn't a cheap meal, with small
plates running mostly in the low teens and large plates reach
ing into the high 20s. However, the servings are quite generous,
and with a small group, the price per head is quite reasonable,
especially for the quality of the food.
