to turn the Admit Weekend fair into more of
a showcase event, where ProFros could get a
flavor for all Stanford extracurricular life has
to offer without feeling pressure to sign up
for anything. Admit Weekend coordinators
also hoped to avoid the awkward situation
wherein ProFros who end up elsewhere are
still getting emails from Stanford student
groups.
Those coordinating the event also prohib
ited student groups from selling things to
ProFros or making commercial solicitations,
which seems perfectly reasonable. I lowever.
the restriction on contact-info collection
seems needless and. at worst, an impediment
to clubs' recruitment and Pro Fro excitement.
If student groups were reminded to be re
sponsible with Pro Fro emails and asked to
limit their summer contact to one email in
late summer, we suspect they would have lis
tened. Next year, we hope email signup priv
ileges are reinstated for the sake of student
groups hungry for new recruits and a Univer
sity seeking to put its best foot forward.
