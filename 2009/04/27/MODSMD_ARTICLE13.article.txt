## Rethinking rivalries 
### 
I have a dark, filthy, dirty rotten secret: I
didn't always go to Stanford. It's the capi
tal-S Shame I've borne all three years I've
been here.and with seven weeks left until the
real world hits me like a left hook to the face,
I think the only way to finally feel better
about it is to get things all out on the table for
everyone to see (and by everyone, 1 mean the
mid-to-high single-digit number of readers I
draw on a weekly basis).
I transferred here, which by itself isn't
such a bad thing, but it's where I transferred
from that's branded me with the Shame for
years. See. 1 didn't just transfer from any
where — I very nearly ruined the rest of my
life by (gulp) going to the University of
Southern California. USC. the school of
I.amborghini's. a secret football dining room
that's even more luxurious than the regular
secret athlete dining room and ().J. I admit to
it.and I am so, so sorry.
If you're still reading and haven't crum
pled up your paper in anguish or smashed
your Macßook in unadulterated rage. I
should probably explain myself. As a Mid
westerner. I was raised to distrust anything
and everything not Midwest, so going to Cal
ifornia for school felt about the same as going
to the moon, and I didn't necessarily under
stand that different parts of it had, well, dif
ferent personalities. But after deciding to be
the idiot who turns down Stanford for film
school, it took about 3.7 seconds on the USC
campus to realize how wrong I was.
I was on the dark side for one entire soul
crushing year, and let me tell you. unlike
most stereotypes, which tend to be narrow
minded.overly generalized characterizations
of diverse groups of people, these ones
aren't; every single stereotype you have ever
heard about USC is true. The girls really do
march around in heels so tight it borders on
Chinese foot binding, and the guys really do
puff out their chests.grate their teeth and flex
their pecs 13 hours a day in a kind of preen
ing ritual that can only be described as Dar
winian. While the first night at Stanford is

spent meeting your dorm and going on band
run, the first night at I ISC is spent throw ing
the freshmen to the wolves on (rat row, with
all the people you've known for around
seven hours getting apocalyptically ham
mered and (if they're lucky) staggering 4
blocks back to campus. This is coincidentally
the night during which <S6 percent of all un
dergraduate friendships are forged and ce
mented. By week two. everything is set in
stone.
The flaunting of wealth is shameless, the
use of parental connections is criminal and
what we applaud here — character, intelli
gence. that kind of stuff —just isn't on the
USC radar. It's more like high school than
your high school was (unlessyou went to pri
vate school in L.A.. in which case it is proba
bly exactly like your high school was).
So I JSC sucks — big time — which brings
me to my main question: maybe I don't get it
because I wasn't here for freshman year and
didn't get the rivalry ingrained in me.but why
aren't these ridiculous cretins from the South
our most hitler rival instead (if Cal?
I never realized how one-sided the Stan
ford-Cal rivalry was until Big Game this year.
Specifically. I didn't realize it until a friend
and I tried to climb Tightwad Hill outside the
Cal stadium and were met by about <S()() Cal
fans chanting at us (and only us) to get the
hell out of Berkeley. It was all pretty funny.at
least until the first full beer can went fly ing by
my face, at which point I realized that the ri
valry meant something very different to Cal
fans than it did to me. To us it felt like just an
other game, and Berkeley was just another
school.To them, it was ideological war.
What made it even harder was that I
agreed with around L )() percent of their insults
— there's not much you can say to someone
yelling at you to "go back to Shallow Alto"
when you're completely on the same page
about the absurd decadence of our cit\
(three luxury imported rug stores on Univer
sity? really?).
I guess it makes sense to hate Cal since

we're, you know, near each other, hut could
n't we just start hating USC as a full-time
job? It's so much easier. Spend five minutes
on that campus watching a group of around
50 girls who were all the most insufferable
ones at their high schools and are now insep
arable best friends sunning themselves on
the north hill of the quad like Mufasa on
Pride Rock, or even look at Pete Carroll
(who is.bv the way.the highest paid universi
ty employee in America, and a consummate
jackass), and you'll understand why this
makes so much sense.
Enthusiasm leading up l<> Big Game has
been way down in recent years, and it's got to
be because we just don't have that much to
hate anymore. I he "what do Stanford and
Cal students have in common?" joke is old
and stupid and almost as obnoxious ;is one of
IJS( \ favorite things to say about IJCLA
(since I ( LA is consistently ranked higher
despite its much lower tuition, chants of

w ith St' fans outside the football stadium be
