# Mark My Words
## The 						freedom to speak selectively 
### 
As a newspaper columnist. I under
stand that there are some things I
simply don't do. I don't make up
facts or claims about a person or situation
and try to pass them oft as truth. I don't try
to incite discord, negativity or hatred among
my peers and readers and I certainly don't
intentionally go against the wishes of my ed
itors without good reason.
From one perspective.one could call me a
responsible journalist. I tell a story in a fac
tually sound and responsible way so as to
provide information and opinion without
baggage. Hut the reality of it is much simpler
and much less romantic. I don't do those
things because I know that if I do. my ability
to continue writing will either be severely
hindered or outright eliminated.
In my weekly musings as a columnist. I am
not exercising my right of freedom of speech;
I am merely being allowed to speak by my
editors. I am not exercising the freedom of
the press; I am being allowed to use an al
ready established press with the permission
of its owners. My ability to express myself is a
privilege, not a right, and it is a privilege I
protect because I enjoy doing what I do.
My predicament of choosing what I say.
when I say and how I say it. unbeknownst to
most, mirrors that of every Stanford student
every minute of every day-
There is a pervasive misconception on
this campus that while at Stanford we have
certain rights and freedoms the same
rights and freedoms that are guaranteed to
us by our government. Most students as
sume we have the right to free speech, the
freedom ol expression and a reasonable ex

pectation of privacy. In reality, these funda
mental rights are evanescent at best in a pri
vate institution.
The Foundation for Individual Rights m
Education (MRL).a liberty watchdog insti
tute that focuses on America's collegiate
campuses, has consistently given Stanford
University the worst possible rating when ii
comes to personal freedoms and liberties,
and for good reason.
Like it or not. the truth of the matter is that
the administration at Stanford I Jniversitv can
tell you to be quiet, stop acting a certain wa\
or just plain kick you out of school at any
given time for any given reason. Stanford re
serves to right to search everything from your
email to your cabinet at their whim.
Land of the free indeed.
Now. before we all panic, understand that
that was not the purpose of my writing about
this issue. In reality, Stanford allows as much
free speech as it feels comfortable allowing.
You can still spend a lazy lunch in White
Plaza watching pro-Palestinian and pro-Is
raeli groups wave flags.and you can siill have
the pleasure of getting heckled ever\ other
Sunday by a few fine gentlemen who would
like to inform you that you are going to hell
for listening to your iPod or for dancing
meringue or something else equalh sinful.
Stanford does believe that the basic
ideals of liberty and freedom are important,
and they do their best to allow the tree exei
cise thereof.
There is a responsibility, however, that
falls on the student body as a whole to exet
cise these privileges responsibly. When Stan
ford requests that we contain our protests

and acti\ ities to White Plaza, it is in the best
interests of those wishing to protest to do so.
When Stanford officials request that you
stop a particular action, you should probably
treat ii as a little more than a suggestion.
I oi us as students to retain the rights and
privileges bestowed upon us b\ this private
institution, we need totake advantage of said
privileges with forethought and discretion.
Now. that is not to sa\ that we should shv
meekh awa\ from challenge or take the Ad
ministration's word as gospel. While we as
students ma\ not have the ieverage lo force
the hand ol the I niversitv. our efforts, voic
es and discussions on the matter can better
bring to light what we considet fair and un
fair. w hat we see as right and w hat we believe
is fundamentally wrong. Ihe pressures of
public opinion (and more importantly, rich
alumni opinion) can exert the influence nec
essary to make changes.
We niav not be able to demand that the
OSA become transparent overnight, but we
can sure as hell ask w In it isn't. Questions and
approaches like this exhibit the rational, rea
soned and responsible discourse students of
i Ii is uni\crsii\ are respected and known for.
As a student bod\ and as individuals, we
must remcmhet thai our actions should be
both bold and considerate lo be too rash is to
bite the hand that feeds, while by being too
timid one would stirrendei the critical
thought and fire that is integral to every
human being.
We must make il a point to move forward
togethei with the University and its rules,
not in opposition to them.
