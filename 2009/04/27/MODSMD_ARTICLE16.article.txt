GAME NOTES After a disappointing one-win weekend
against Arizona, Stanford looks to rebound in Monday's
meeting with the Dons. The arrival of USF is the first of
,two home non-conference games the Cardinal will play
this week before traveling to Washington State over the
weekend.

In a series that many considered a must
win for Stanford, the Cardinal came up just
short, dropping two of the three contests
against Arizona to fall to IK-IK overall and K
-10 in the conference.The Wildcats were in last
place in the Pac-10 coming into the weekend,
but they steamrolled Stanford in the opener
and held on for a narrow victory in the week
end's last match to take the series and improve
to 19-20 and 5-13 in the conference.
The largest positive on the weekend was
freshman starter Brett Mooneyham. who
bounced back from a disappointing outing
against Arizona State to pick up a v.in and
hold Arizona to just one run in the Saturdav
game.
"1 wasn't niv best at Arizona State.

Mooneyham said. "I tried to work on my
breaking halls and did a much better job this
week with being able to lock guys up and get
outs."
Although it is impossible to know how
postseason selections will play out. it is likely
that Stanford will need to win every series the
rest ol the way to even have a chance of mak
ing the tournament.
Friday: Arizona 11, Stanford 1
112 reshman starter Jordan Pries — making
his first career I riday start pitched three
scoreless innings before getting into trouble in
the fourth. I"he Wildcats sent 10 men to the
plate and scored four times in that inning, al
though Stanford was close to getting out of
trouble a couple of times. Senior first baseman
Brent Vlilleville nearls caught a foul ball over
his shoulder, and sophomore right fielder

Kellen Kiilsgaard nearly made a diving catch
on a sinking line drive that would have ended
the inning. Pries didn't make it out of the fifth
allowing two more runs — and took the
first loss of his collegiate career to fall to 3-1.
"Pries got behind and then had to throw a
lot of fastballs." said head coach Mark Mar
quess. 'They got a few hits and then also got
hits after he walked guys, which is what really
hurt him."
()n the other side of the diamond. Arizona
starter Preston Guilmet pitched a gem. hold
ing Stanford to just one run on five hits over
seven innings. Ciuilmet allowed three men to
reach in the first, but was able to keep the Car
dinal off the scoreboard and eventually set
tled down to shut down the Stanford offense.
His lone blemish was a hii»h home run hit bv
junior left fielder Toby Gerhart in
the sixth inning — it was the first and
only home run Guilmet has giving up
in over 60 innings.
Saturday: Stanford 3, Arizona 1
Stanford turned to its other star
freshman pitcher, Brett Mooney
ham. to shut down the Wildcats and
even the series on Saturday. The tall
left-hander allowed just one run on
four hits in ft.2 innings of work, and
handed the hall off to sophomore
close Drew Storen in the seventh in
ning. Storen then picked up a seven
out save. Mooneyham struggled with
control at times, but for the most part
was able to get outs whenever Ari
zona threatened to score.
Stanford scored a run in the first
inning after Arizona starter Kvle
Simon walked the first three Cardi
nal batters, but Arizona tied the
game in the top of the fourth on an
RBI single by star first baseman
Dillon Baird. Milleville gave Stan
ford the lead right back when he
smashed his eighth home run of the
year over the left field fence to

make it 2-1. Perhaps the most im
portant play of the game came in
the next half inning, when Arizona
tried the squeeze play with a runner
on third and one out. Mooneyham
charged the bunt and Hipped it to
sophomore catcher Zach Jones,
who absorbed a hit and put the tag
down just in time to get Wildcat left
fielder Brad Glenn at the plate and
preserve the lead.
"[Mooneyham] is a good athlete
and he made a good play there."
Marquess said. "That was a bang
bang play, and that was a big play be
cause that saved a run there. In a
close game, that is a huge play."
Stanford's third run came when
senior Joey August drove in sopho
more Jake Schlander with an RBI
single in the fifth. Mooneyham
picked up the win to improve his
record to (4-2).
Sunday: Arizona 7, Stanford 6
The Wildcats scored two runs in
the first inning and held the lead al
most the entire game, but Stanford
was always right on their heels. Ari
zona never held a lead larger than 6-
3,and that only lasted briefly. In fact,
each time Arizona scored after the
fifth inning, Stanford put up the
same number of runs in the bottom
half the inning, but finally proved un

able to climb out of the one-run
deficit.
Four Cardinal batters finished
with multi-hit games, including
Gerhart. who went two-for-three
with two runs and two RBI, and hit
his fifth home run of the season.
Walsh. August and Jones all added
two-hit games. Milleville delivered
a pair of RBI. and Kiilsg'aard went
one-for-two and drew three walks.

capitalize and stranded 13 runners
on base.

sky scored two runs on four hits for
Arizona, and shortstop Bryce Orte
ga blasted a home run and finished
two-for-three with three runs and
two RBI to keep the Wildcats out in
front.
