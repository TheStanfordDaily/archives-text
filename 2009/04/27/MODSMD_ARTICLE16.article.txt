GAME NOTES After a disappointing one-win weekend
against Arizona, Stanford looks to rebound in Monday's
meeting with the Dons. The arrival of USF is the first of
,two home non-conference games the Cardinal will play
this week before traveling to Washington State over the
weekend.

In a series that many considered a must
win for Stanford, the Cardinal came up just
short, dropping two of the three contests
against Arizona to fall to IK-IK overall and K
-10 in the conference.The Wildcats were in last
place in the Pac-10 coming into the weekend,
but they steamrolled Stanford in the opener
and held on for a narrow victory in the week
end's last match to take the series and improve
to 19-20 and 5-13 in the conference.
The largest positive on the weekend was
freshman starter Brett Mooneyham. who
bounced back from a disappointing outing
against Arizona State to pick up a v.in and
hold Arizona to just one run in the Saturdav
game.
"1 wasn't niv best at Arizona State.

Mooneyham said. "I tried to work on my
breaking halls and did a much better job this
week with being able to lock guys up and get
outs."
Although it is impossible to know how
postseason selections will play out. it is likely
that Stanford will need to win every series the
rest ol the way to even have a chance of mak
ing the tournament.

though Stanford was close to getting out of
trouble a couple of times. Senior first baseman
Brent Vlilleville nearls caught a foul ball over
his shoulder, and sophomore right fielder

Kellen Kiilsgaard nearly made a diving catch
on a sinking line drive that would have ended
the inning. Pries didn't make it out of the fifth
allowing two more runs — and took the
first loss of his collegiate career to fall to 3-1.
"Pries got behind and then had to throw a
lot of fastballs." said head coach Mark Mar
quess. 'They got a few hits and then also got
hits after he walked guys, which is what really
hurt him."
