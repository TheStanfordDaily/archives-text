# Draft day division in the Bay
## 
### 
While one side of the Bay
cheered, the other could
only hang its head. That's
how the 2009 Nil Draft opened,
and that's how it closed, as well. On
the one weekend each year when the
nation's most popular sports — col
lege and professional football
come together for a single selection
extravaganza that's half corporate
event, and half picking dodgeball
teams at recess, the Bay community
was similarly split.
On the professional side of the
equation, the draft couldn't have
gone better for the peninsula, as the
49ers sat tight at No. 10 and this
year's most eye-popping playmaker
fell into their laps, potentially solving
what has been a half-decade long
problem for San I rancisco. Redshirt
sophomore Texas Tech wide receiver
Michael Crabtree had it all: the pro
duction in a top conference, as well
as the size, hands and leaping ability
to indicate that he was a near can t
miss receiver at the Nil. level.
But, when doctors noticed a stress
fracture in Crabtree's foot at the an
nual NI L Scouting Combine in Feb
ruary. it prevented the player who
some analysts deemed the most tal
ented player in the draft from run
ning the 40-yard dash for scouts. And
questions regarding his speed ulti
mately pushed him down on Satur
day as the Oakland Raiders, also in
need of a wide receiver, passed on
Crabtree at their seventh spot to se
lect Maryland widcout Darrius I lev
ward-Boy. 1 leyward Bey turned in a
blazing 40 time of under 4.3 seconds,
and Raiders owner Al Davis had
seen all he needed to see.Though the
Raiders were largely derided for
their choice over the next day and a
half of the draft, they had their man.
And two picks later, the Niners
had theirs. Whether the Raiders se
lection of I leyward-Bey will turn out
to be a classic draft blunder, only
time will tell. But most analysts were
quick to confidently proclaim that
Oakland's loss was San Francisco's
gain. Adding further insult to injury,
the Raiders' second round choice
was mocked as well, as safety
Michael Mitchell from Ohio (not
Ohio State, just plain old Ohio) was
considered such a non-prospect that
the FSPN broadcast didn't have a
highlight reel ready to roll when he
was selected I he network that has to
be ready for literally hundreds of
players across the nation to be select
ed simply wasn't ready to talk about
this guy.
In short, it was a bad weekend for
Raiders fans.
Meanwhile, for the first time since
2003. San Francisco has a potential
franchise weapon at receiver. After
megastar (and mega-headache) Ier
rell Owens left town for Philadelphia
prior to the 2004 season, the 49ers of
fense sank into an abyss from which
it has yet to fully emerge. Despite a
shaky situation at quarterback, the
selection of Crabtree for the 49ers
seems to. at the very least, represent
a step in the right direction, if not
portend an offensive explosion in
2009.
On the collegiate side, mean
while. it turned out to be a fantastic
weekend for the Pacific-10 Confer
ence and Cal.but another dismal one
for Stanford's NFF hopefuls. Lor the
second year in a row. no Cardinal
player was selected in the seven
rounds of the draft, though some will
undoubtedly latch on with teams as
undrafted free agents.
On the whole, however, it was a
banner weekend for some in the Pac
10, and especially USC. ITie Irojans
led the way with 11 players selected
on the weekend, including three in
the first round. Oregon State was
next in the conference with seven
players selected: Oregon had six.Cal
had three. Arizona and Arizona
State each had two. Washington
State had one and I J( "I A and Wash
ington joined the C ardinal in the oh
for category.
For the Trojans, the weekend
must have seemed especially sweet.
Beginning with the fifth overall pick,
when the Jets traded up to land for
mer Southern ("al signal-caller Mark
Sanchez, a veritable parade of Iro
jans had their names called in New
York. What's more, eight of the


Griffin
Rants and Raves
school's 11 overall players to be se
lected were picked in the fourth
round or earlier, a rare display of
confidence in players from a single
program.
In the end. it was the kind of
topsy-turvy weekend in the Bay
Area that only the NFL Draft can
bring. While Raiders fans mourned
in Oakland.49ers fans danced in San

Francisco. And while Cal players
and fans rejoiced in Berkeley, all
was quiet at Stanford. But the beau
tiful thing about the draft is this: de
spite all our initial impressions,
nothing is final. There's still time for
everyone — from the speedy but
unheralded Heyward-Bey to the un
drafted Stanford stars — to change
our minds. In the NFL Draft, the ul
timate rule, as always, is that time
will tell.
