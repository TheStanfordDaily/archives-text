Although Michael Crahtree might be the best
dressed rookie at next weekend's minicamp, he won't be
the only newcomer to the San Francisco 49ers' offense.
The 49ers replenished their stock of skill players
Sunday, adding Alabama running back Glen Coffee,
Ball State quarterback Nate Davis and Fresno State
tight end Bear Pascoe to the draft class led by Crabtree.

Although San Francisco failed to address its needs at
offensive tackle or outside linebacker, the club grabbed
several players with notable college careers. In addition
to their skill selections, the Niners also picked Pitt line

backer Scott McKillop early in the second day of the
NFL draft before adding two LSU teammates: safety
Curtis Taylor and defensive lineman Kicky Jean-Fran
cois.
But the Miners' focus was depth for an offense that
will have its seventh coordinator in seven seasons this
fall.
"I don't want to talk about what we didn't get." coach
Mike Singletary said. "I want to talk about what we did
get. It's obvious that most (teams) that drafted aren't
going to get what they want, and we're certainly on that
list. But I think that (general manager) Scot Mc( loughan
and our personnel department did an outstanding job
along with the scouts of producing the draft that we had."
