### GREG BEACHAM THE ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Although Michael Crahtree might be the best
dressed rookie at next weekend's minicamp, he won't be
the only newcomer to the San Francisco 49ers' offense.
The 49ers replenished their stock of skill players
Sunday, adding Alabama running back Glen Coffee,
Ball State quarterback Nate Davis and Fresno State
tight end Bear Pascoe to the draft class led by Crabtree.
the Texas Tech receiver chosen l()th overall a day earli
er.
Although San Francisco failed to address its needs at
offensive tackle or outside linebacker, the club grabbed
several players with notable college careers. In addition
to their skill selections, the Niners also picked Pitt line

backer Scott McKillop early in the second day of the
NFL draft before adding two LSU teammates: safety
Curtis Taylor and defensive lineman Kicky Jean-Fran
cois.
But the Miners' focus was depth for an offense that
will have its seventh coordinator in seven seasons this
fall.
"I don't want to talk about what we didn't get." coach
Mike Singletary said. "I want to talk about what we did
get. It's obvious that most (teams) that drafted aren't
going to get what they want, and we're certainly on that
list. But I think that (general manager) Scot Mc( loughan
and our personnel department did an outstanding job
along with the scouts of producing the draft that we had."
The 49ers also introduced Crahtree at a
news conference at their training complex
Sunday. Wearing a sharp tan suit with a red
tie.the fashion-minded receiver looked the
part of a new Niner while holding up his
new No. 15 jersey â€” although he said the
outfit was picked out weeks ago. well before
he knew the color scheme matched where
he would spend the next several years.
"I love interacting with my teammates."
said Crahtree. who won't participate in much
of the upcoming minicamp while resting his
surgically repaired left foot."That's the most
fun part, messing with my linemen and my
DBs, and just having fun with your team."
The Niners traded their second and
fourth-round picks Saturday to Carolina for
a first-rounder next year, so their highest
pick behind Crahtree was third-rounder
Coffee, the hard-nosed tailback who rushed
for 1,383 yards during the Crimson Tide's
outstanding season.

Coffee didn't make a pre-draft visit to
Santa Clara, but he already has watched
Frank Gore enough to know he'll enjoy
being the San Francisco star's backup.
"I'd probably want to run you over first,
but if I can't run around you. I 'm going to try
to make you miss and get away from you."
Coffee said."Trust me. if I see a hole, I won't
think twice about lowering my head."
Singletary envisions Coffee doing a bit
of the dirty work for Gore, who has been in
credibly durable in four seasons with the
49ers despite his lengthy injury history. Cof
fee is just 6 feet tall, but could add 10 to 20
pounds of muscle in the next couple of
years.
"Whatever Frank leaves over, whatever
little bit Frank leaves on the plate, then (Cof
fee) can pick it up." Singletary said. "Coffee
is a downhill guy. There's not a lot of slash in
him. He's just coming right at you."
Singletary valued McKillop. the Niners'
first pick in the fifth round, for his versatility
and immediate usefulness on special teams.
The 4 ( )ers won't be in a similar rush to use
Davis, the Mid-American Conference's of
fensive player of the year while leading Ball
State to the title game.
