Concerned Students for Community Centers (CSCC) marched on Friday, protesting the lack of transparency in community center
budget cuts. They argued for more information from the Vice Provost of Student Affairs and greater student input in the budget cut
process, which they believe will severely affect community centers. The Daily will have full coverage on the cuts in the coming days.
