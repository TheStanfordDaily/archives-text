The Stanford men's tennis team
entered Ojai, California on Thursday
for the Pacific-10 Championship
tournament, and by Sunday had won

championship titles.
Freshman Bradley Klahn earned
the title in both singles and doubles
following Sunday's competition, in
which he dominated USC's Steve
Johnson. 7-6(4). 6-4. and then later
defeated Bruin opponents Michael
Look and Eugen Brazdil, 6-3.3-6. 7-

wise, in the doubles bracket, the Car
dinal had four entering teams —
Wire and Muller. Klahn and Thacher,
Clayton and sophomore Ted Kelly
and invitational team sophomore
Greg Hirshman and senior Jeff
Zeller.
Clayton and Klahn found early
victories that advanced them to the
quarterfinals of the championship
singles bracket. Early Thursday
morning. Klahn beat out Aniit Inbar
of UCLA. 6-3.6-2. in the round of 32.
He continued to defeat USC's Ab
dullah Magdas. 6-4. 6-3. Likewise.

defeated UCLA's Matt Brooklyn, 7-
6, 6-4, and Clayton won over Ari
zona's Andres Carrasco. 6-1.6-1.

Klahn in the running for the champi
onship singles title after his victory
over USC's Robert Farah. 6-2. 7-5.
Clayton was defeated 6-4. 6-3 by
USC's Steve Johnson, over whom
Klahn then triumphed on Sunday

In the invitational singles bracket.
Stanford sophomore Greg Hirshman
and senior Jeff Zeller each advanced
to the quarterfinals on Thursday after
winning against respective oppo
nents of Tommie Murphy of Califor
nia (4-4) and Alex Rosinski of Wash
ington. 7-5.6-2. On Friday, Zeller was
defeated by USC's Dan Nguyen, 6-1.

beat Duncan MacDonald-Korth 6-2,
6-2. before leaving the tournament
on Saturday after a loss to UCLA's
Eugen Brazdil, 7-6(4), 6-4.
On the doubles side. Wire and
Muller beat out Arizona's Carrasco
and Ravid Hazi 8-3 on Friday before
losing to USC's Abdullah Magdas
and Nguyen 9-8(4). The big shocker,
however, came when Klahn and
Thacher advanced beyond UCLA's
Holden Seguso and Brooklyn to de
feat the nation's No. 2 pair in Farah
and Johnson of USC.
After Saturday's ensuing win
against opponents Derek Drabble
and Martin Kildahl of Washington.8-
3. Klahn and Thacher found them
selves in running for the Pac-10 dou
ble title — and they did not disap
point come Sunday.
"Klahn and Thacher played a
great game against a worthy oppo
nent." said Stanford head coach John

Whitlinger. "USC is a highly re
spectable team, and we came
through."
The invitational doubles bracket
competitors found success as well.
On Friday. Hirshman and Zeller beat
out opponents Tommie Murphy and
Evan Rose of California at a score of
8-4. Then, on Saturday, the pair con
tinued its domination of USC's Jason
McNaughton and Daniel Gilner. 8-1.
and continued its success into Sun
day's match against another Trojan
pair in Matt Kecki and Andrew Kells.
"It was a great win for Zeller to
come at the end of his college career,"
Whitlinger said.
Overall, the Cardinal's success
centered on the freshman Klahn who.
after being named Pac-10 Player of
Week on April 20. has already found
two highly anticipated Pac-10 titles.
Despite all of the success at the
Pac-10 Championships, though, the
team is still anticipating the NCAA
Championship, which begins for
Stanford on May 8.
"We hope to host at Stanford,"
Whitlinger said. "[So] we're treating
our first game as very important — it
is no matter who we play first."
