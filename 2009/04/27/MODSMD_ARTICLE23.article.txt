## No Stanford players selected in the NFL Draft 
### Wyndam Makowsky Haley Murphy 
In a repeat of last
April's NFL Draft, no
Stanford football players
were chosen in New York
this weekend. It was an
unexpected result, as
many predicted that Car
dinal athletes like defen
sive end Pannel Egboh
and cornerback Wopamo
Osaisai would be selected
based on their individual
potentials alone.
Egboh and Osaisai
quickly latched onto
teams as undrafted free
agents, though, as Egboh
signed with the San Fran
cisco 49ers and Osaisai
inked a deal with the San
Diego Chargers.
Still, for a school that
prior to 2(X)8 had at least
three players drafted for
six straight years, it was a
disappointing result. In
addition to Egboh and
Osaisai. longtime starters
like running back Antho
ny Kimble and center
Alex Fletcher were not
taken, and as of this arti-

cle's writing, had not signed free agent contracts, although both are
expected to do so. Other players who may latch on to professional
squads include linebacker Pat Maynor and offensive tackle Ben
Muth.
The Pacific-10 Conference in general had a hot-and-cold draft
season. USC had 11 players selected, and Oregon State and Oregon
had seven and six players taken, respectively. But. along with Stan
ford. Washington and DC'I.A had no athletes selected. Bay area rival
Cal had three players chosen, although two came in the final round.
Women's lacrosse wins MPSF Championship
In what has become its usual fashion, the No. 14 Stanford women's
lacrosse team earned the top spot in the Mountain Pacific Sports Fed
eration (MPSF). winning its fifth consecutive conference champi
onship on Sunday. It was the team's 12th in 15 years. The Cardinal
trampled Cal's Golden Bears. 18-13. in the tournament's final after
dominating UC-Davis. 17-3 on Friday.
Although the game went back-and-forth early on. including three
lead changes and seven ties before the 25-minute mark. Stanford
maintained steady control of the match-up after gaining a c >-7 lead.
Individually. Cardinal sophomores Leslie Foard and Karen Nes
bitt shined brightest. Foard registered a career-high five goals and

one assist in the finale, and Nesbitt was deemed the tournament's
Most Valuable Player after posting three goals, two assists and three
draw controls of her own. Stanford also got significant contributions
from MPSF Player of the Year junior Lauren Schmidt (three goals,
two assists), senior Jamie Nesbitt (two goals), junior Eleanor Foote
(forced four turnovers), and sophomore Ashley Aruffo.
With the win. the Cardinal extended its MPSF Tournament win
ning streak to 12 games, a stretch that goes back to 2004. Stanford re
turns to action in non-conference play, taking on Louisville at home
on Thursday at 3 p.m.
Please see Thursday's Daily for a preview of that match-up. and a
further recap of this weekend's games.
