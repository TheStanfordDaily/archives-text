## Tourney serves as NCAA prep 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN STAFF WRITER 
The No. 13 Stanford women's
tennis team competed at the Pacific
10 Conference Championships over
the weekend in Ojai, Calif. Though
the Cardinal women did not bring
home any titles this year, the experi
ence was a positive one for the well
represented Stanford squad.
"I thought the team's perform
ance was pretty good." sophomore
Hilary Barte said.
In the championship singles
draw, five Stanford players partici
pated, including Barte, junior Lind
say Burdette,senior Jessica Nguyen,
sophomore Carolyn McVeigh and
freshman Veronica Li.
Burdette dropped her first
round match to Cal's Bojana Bobu
sic in a hard-fought 3-6.6-2.6-4 loss.
McVeigh, meanwhile, bowed out in

her second-round match versus
IJCLA s Yasmin Schnack in a 6-2,6-
1 decision.
Still, Barte, Nguyen and Li all
made it to the quarterfinal round.
On their paths to the quarterfinals,
Nguyen and Li gained some much
needed revenge over previous foes.
In the first round, Nguyen routed
Cal's Mari Andersson 6-2. 6-3. Last
weekend. Nguyen fell to Andersson.
as Stanford lost 4-3 to its archrival.
Similarly. Li defeated Southern Cal
ifornia's Alison Ramos 6-1.7-5. Last
month. Ramos got the better of Li in
the first match-up, contributing to
USC's huge. 5-2 upset of Stanford.
"Jessica's win over Andersson was
pretty huge," Barte said of her team
mate. "[But.] I thought Li beating
Ramos was pretty important as well."
However, in the quarterfinals,
Barte and Li were set to face each
other, and Barte easily won 6-2. 6-2

over her teammate.
In the other quarterfinal match.
Nguyen fell 6-1.6-1 to USC's Aman
da Fink, leaving Barte alone in the
championship draw.
After going undefeated for near
ly two months, though. Barte was
shocked by Fink in a 6-4.2-6.7-5(5)
upset.The loss broke a 13-match win
streak for Barte that dated back to
Feb. 28 against Washington's Venise
Chan, and the USC senior went on
to take the championship title.
"I started off really well." Barte
said. "There was a lot of hype going
into it. It was a tightly contested
match — I had my chances and she
obviously did also."
In the invitational singles draw,
senior Isamarie Perez, sophomore
Jennifer Yen and freshman Logan
I lansen represented the Cardinal.
Perez and Yen fell in the first and
second round, respectively. Hansen
made the quarterfinals of her draw
before falling 0-6. 6-2. 6-4 to Wash
ington's Aleksandra Malovic.
In the championship doubles
draw. Stanford fielded two teams.
Hansen-Li and McVeigh-Nguyen.
The top duo of Barte and Burdette
elected to sit out the tournament to
focus on their singles play.
"We were definitely itching to
play, though." Barte said of doubles.
i lansen and Li fell out of the first
round with an 8-5 loss to USC's F ink
and Gabriela Niculescu. McVeigh
and Nguyen outlasted their oppo
nents in the semifinal round before
falling 8-6 to ASU's Laila and Nadia
Abdala.
Meanwhile, in the invitational
doubles draw. Perez and Yen
teamed up for the first time this
year.The duo made a surprising run
to the finals, but eventually fell 8-2
to Maya Johansson and Anna-Vik
toria Lind of UCLA.
"I thought it was awesome,"
Barte said of Perez and Yen. "They
beat some really good teams, and it
was a good showing for them."
With the Pac-10 Championships
concluded. Stanford's focus now
turns to the NCAA Championships
in two weeks. Two years removed
from a national title, the Cardinal is
eager to reclaim its place at the top.
"We have the first two rounds of
NC'AAs in two weekends' time."
Barte said. "We're all pretty excited
and looking forward to that."
The NCAA Tournament draw
will be announced on Tuesday. The
first two rounds will be played May
8-10, and the final 16 teams will con
vene in Texas for the NCAA Cham
pionships.
