### JACOB JAFFE DESK EDITOR 
The season ended in heartbreaking fashion for Stanford men's vol
leyball. when the team failed to hold onto a two-set lead over USC in
the first round of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) play
offs.
ITie No. 4 Cardinal (21-11,14-8 MPSF) lost to the No. 7 Trojans 20-
30. 27-30. 30-27, 30-24, 15-11 on Saturday night at Maples Pavilion.
Stanford had all the momentum coming into the match, winning 13 of
its final 16 matches in the regular season and clinching its first home
playoff match in six years after USC lost to Hawaii last weekend. This
momentum carried over into the first two sets of the match, when the
Cardinal showed its confidence.
"LJSC was a little bit startled and nervous because we had so much
positive energy from the gym around us." said freshman middle block
er Gus Ellis.
The positive energy came from the packed crowd of 1.2(H) people in
Maples, and the atmosphere was raucous all game long. Players, coach
es and fans from both teams were involved in a number of scuffles
throughout the game, culminating in the third set when USC head
coach Bill Ferguson was given a yellow card for arguing from the side
lines.
Hie Cardinal started off strong, hitting .365 in the first two sets, com
pared to only .247 for USC Stanford's digging and blocking were excel
lent in the first two sets as well, leading to a sideout percentage of ~ ! 1.
which also bested USC's 61.
"We were able to sustain a high level of intensity and a good rhythm
on defense." said Ellis, who had four kills on seven attempts. "We could
comfortably predict what sets [USC sophomore setter Riley Mckibbin|
would make."
The tide completely turned in the third set. though, as the Trojans
established control and wouldn't let go of for the rest of the night.
"As time wore on. they built their confidence up and felt more com
fortable." Ellis said.
USC players began to hit better and better, hitting .405..5(H) and .S(H)
in the final three sets of the match and siding out at a rate of 83 percent.
"[USC's players] started to play with a lot more consistency." 1 Mis
said.
"They had a good collective effort to plav defense, and they were a
solid all-around unit."

Junior opposite Evan Romero recorded 21 kills in Saturday's meeting with the Trojans, but the Cardinal couldn't hang
on to its early lead after a mid-match turnaround by USC.
Meanwhile, the Cardinal's hitting dropped
to .267 for the final three sets, and its sideout
percentage was 69. Over the last three sets, the
Trojans jumped out to early leads, and al
though the Cardinal responded with runs of its
own. Stanford could not gain a lead in any of
the last three sets. In particular, the Cardinal
had trouble defending USC's outside hitters
Murphy Troy and Tony Ciarelli. who combined
for 49 kills in the match. McKibbin was anoth
er source of trouble for the Cardinal, notching
69 assists and 16 digs, both match highs.
Stanford was led by junior opposite F.van
Romero's 21 kills, followed by freshman out
side hitter Brad Lawson with 15 kills.and soph
omore outside hitter Spencer McLachlin with
12 kills. Junior setter Kawika Shoji. who was
just named to the AII-Mf'Sl I irst Team, also
had 61 assists and five kills on six attempts.
Meanwhile, freshman libero Erik Shoji added
15 digs, giving him 447 for the year, which is be
lieved to be the NC AA record.although no of
ficial dig statistics have been kept.

After such impressive individual perform
ances and the team's early lead, the Cardinal
was devastated to end its season this way.
"The locker room was completely silent,"
F.llis said. "When [Kosty] came to address us.
he thanked the seniors, but he was still at a loss
for words."
Despite the tough loss, this season was a
great step forward for the Cardinal program,
as its 21 wins marks the most in 12 years.
The I JSC match ended the Stanford careers
of its four seniors, middle blocker Cameron
Christoffers, middle blocker Brandon
Williams, setter Miki Groppi and lihero Jarod
Keller.
Apart from its losses, the team is optimistic
about continuing its turnaround from a 3-25
record two years ago to its status this year as a
national powerhouse.
"|ln the locker rooni.| everyone was saying
it's going to be different next vear," Ellis said.
