### JACOB JAFFE DESK EDITOR 
The season ended in heartbreaking fashion for Stanford men's vol
leyball. when the team failed to hold onto a two-set lead over USC in
the first round of the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF) play
offs.
ITie No. 4 Cardinal (21-11,14-8 MPSF) lost to the No. 7 Trojans 20-
30. 27-30. 30-27, 30-24, 15-11 on Saturday night at Maples Pavilion.
Stanford had all the momentum coming into the match, winning 13 of
its final 16 matches in the regular season and clinching its first home
playoff match in six years after USC lost to Hawaii last weekend. This
momentum carried over into the first two sets of the match, when the
Cardinal showed its confidence.
"LJSC was a little bit startled and nervous because we had so much
positive energy from the gym around us." said freshman middle block
er Gus Ellis.
The positive energy came from the packed crowd of 1.2(H) people in
Maples, and the atmosphere was raucous all game long. Players, coach
es and fans from both teams were involved in a number of scuffles
throughout the game, culminating in the third set when USC head
coach Bill Ferguson was given a yellow card for arguing from the side
lines.
Hie Cardinal started off strong, hitting .365 in the first two sets, com
pared to only .247 for USC Stanford's digging and blocking were excel
lent in the first two sets as well, leading to a sideout percentage of ~ ! 1.
which also bested USC's 61.
"We were able to sustain a high level of intensity and a good rhythm
on defense." said Ellis, who had four kills on seven attempts. "We could
comfortably predict what sets [USC sophomore setter Riley Mckibbin|
would make."
The tide completely turned in the third set. though, as the Trojans
established control and wouldn't let go of for the rest of the night.
"As time wore on. they built their confidence up and felt more com
fortable." Ellis said.
USC players began to hit better and better, hitting .405..5(H) and .S(H)
in the final three sets of the match and siding out at a rate of 83 percent.
"[USC's players] started to play with a lot more consistency." 1 Mis
said.
"They had a good collective effort to plav defense, and they were a
solid all-around unit."
