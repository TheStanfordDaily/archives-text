# Ticket price same as previous years', but no open bar this year
## Seniors face cost issues over formal 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With May rapidly approaching. Stanford's
graduating seniors have two major events in
mind — thesis deadlines and senior formal.
While the former might be the greatest source
of stress for seniors, the latter is also arousing
some frustration among the Class of 2009
because of high ticket prices and the lack of an
open bar.

thereby incurring further costs.
Still adding to the formal price tag is a sep

campus to the venue are on sale for $18 each.
"The tier pricing was chosen because it pro
vides an incentive for students to buy tickets
early — a necessity given the intricacies of
venue contracts, which require us to pay the
