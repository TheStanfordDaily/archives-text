# Ticket price same as previous years', but no open bar this year
## Seniors face cost issues over formal 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With May rapidly approaching. Stanford's
graduating seniors have two major events in
mind — thesis deadlines and senior formal.
While the former might be the greatest source
of stress for seniors, the latter is also arousing
some frustration among the Class of 2009
because of high ticket prices and the lack of an
open bar.
Earlv-bird tickets for the May 9 formal at
San Francisco's AT&T Park were priced at
$65. increased to $75 this past week, and will
now cost $85; the price also does not include an
open bar, a popular feature of previous for
mals.
"I definitely think that the ticket prices are
too high, and that there could have been better
communication by those organizing the
events." said Anstes Agnew '09. "Senior formal
should be an event that is inclusive and open to
all seniors that want to attend, and these ticket
prices are simply not affordable for everyone."
Other students, however, felt that the tick
ets were appropriately priced.
'i think that they are really fairly priced."

said Mary Liz McCurdy '09. "It's expensive to
put on a really nice event. If you compare the
prices to local high schools' formals like Paly,
tickets are about $125. While $65 is not cheap,
putting on the event is not cheap."
According to senior co-president Johnny
McCormick '09, the ticket prices must cover
costs for the dance floor. DJ. jazz hand, photog
rapher and food. The class presidents also plan
to make avail of AT&T Park's scoreboard and
play a picture montage for the Class of 2009.
thereby incurring further costs.
Still adding to the formal price tag is a sep
arate transportation cost for seniors who do
not plan to drive to the event. Bus tickets from
campus to the venue are on sale for $18 each.
"The tier pricing was chosen because it pro
vides an incentive for students to buy tickets
early — a necessity given the intricacies of
venue contracts, which require us to pay the
full rental costs ahead of time." explained co
president Dimitar Iliev "09 in an email to The
Daily. "A secondary concern is that we need to
know how many people are going early on in
order to secure appropriate catering, security
and transportation reservations at
the lowest possible prices."
Iliev added that ticket prices for
senior formal have not increased
from the previous two years, with the
structure remaining the same and the
bus price actually decreasing by two
dollars.
However, this year's ticket price
does not include an open bar. which
was popular at previous formals.
McCormick, who attended last
year's formal, shared doubts about
whether or not an open bar would
have been a good bargain for his
peers.
"Once you got there, you didn't
have to pay for drinks because it was
an open bar. but you really had to
spend a lot of time waiting in line to
get your drinks," McCormick said of
the Class of 2(X)8 senior formal. "As
far as this year goes... if we had
pushed for an open bar, it would
have been prohibitively expensive."
McCurdv also thought that it was
appropriate that there was not an
open bar.
"I think it's nice that they event
planners tried to keep the cost as low
as possible," she said. "Since drinking
is a preference, it gives you the
option of if you want to drink or not.
I think that is nice."
Students however, remarked that
they were unclear about what they
would be paying for. Agnew
explained that she assumed there
was an open bar and that bus tickets
would be included in the fee because
the ticket price was already so high.
"1 understand that the venue is a
huge expense, but the organizers
haven't done a good job being trans

parent about where our money's
going." she said.
Aside from these concerns, senior
class presidents had difficulty secur
ing an appropriate venue. As the
chair of the formal committee. Siri
Sachs "09 revealed that they had a
limited number of options to choose
from.
"Most venues in San Francisco
won't take this kind of event any
more." Sachs said. "We did not have
that many options."
McCormick expressed similar
frustration over finding a venue. The
de Young Museum, which hosted last
year's formal, was initially a top
choice, but was unattainable.
McCormick suggested that past inci
dents might have led the museum to
decline Stanford's business this time
around.
"We got in contact with them
back in the fall, but they were not
interested in having us as one of their
clients again." McCormick said.
"It's interesting that AT&T is tak
ing us back because there were
mishaps last time, but that's also why
we have to hire additional security
this time," Sachs added.
The formal planners also faced
the difficultly of paying an upfront
fee for the venue space. The rental
costs for AT&T Park alone totaled
$17,500, leading the class presidents
to push for early ticket sales.
In spite of these challenges, the
formal organizers have remained
enthusiastic about the event.
"In general, our class has always
had unusually high attendance to
class-wide events, whether it has
been sophomore formal or junior
formal or even Senior Night,"
McCormick said."l have heard anec
dotally, from the cabinet members
who have been selling tickets in
White Plaza, that that is doing well."
Sachs echoed these sentiments.

hut is admittedly worried that ticket
prices might discourage some seniors
from attending the event.
"I've received maybe two or three
questions about it actually, and those
people still bought tickets." Sachs
noted. "Still, there might be people
who are just not bringing it up."
Indeed, some seniors have
planned a less expensive night out in
San Francisco as an alternative to the
formal, opting instead to have dinner
in the city with an intimate group of
friends.
But for seniors who do intend to
go to the formal, the event is a com
memoration of their undergraduate
years at Stanford.
"It's going to be at the end of our
four years together." Sachs conclud
ed. "For me. it feels very important to
have a very good, forming last expe
rience together and I think it's going
to be a lot of fun."
Even though some considered the
cost of the tickets to be high, they still
plan on attending.
"I've always planned on attending
senior formal, and so am willing to
accept, somewhat unhappily, the
[cost] of the event, but I recognize
that not all of my peers can do the
same." Agnew said. "It's unfortunate
that there's likely a lot of people out
there who are prohibited from going
due to the cost, when this should be a
night for the whole senior class to
enjoy."
Senior formal is scheduled for
May 9, 2009, from 9:30 p.m. to 1:30
a.m. Tickets will be on sale from
noon to 1 p.m. on Monday and
Friday in White Plaza, and from 7 to

However, this year's ticket price
does not include an open bar. which
was popular at previous formals.
McCormick, who attended last
year's formal, shared doubts about
whether or not an open bar would
have been a good bargain for his
peers.
"Once you got there, you didn't
have to pay for drinks because it was
an open bar. but you really had to
spend a lot of time waiting in line to
get your drinks," McCormick said of
the Class of 2(X)8 senior formal. "As
far as this year goes... if we had
pushed for an open bar, it would
have been prohibitively expensive."
McCurdv also thought that it was
appropriate that there was not an
open bar.
"I think it's nice that they event
planners tried to keep the cost as low
as possible," she said. "Since drinking
is a preference, it gives you the
option of if you want to drink or not.
I think that is nice."
Students however, remarked that
they were unclear about what they
would be paying for. Agnew
explained that she assumed there
was an open bar and that bus tickets
would be included in the fee because
the ticket price was already so high.
"1 understand that the venue is a
huge expense, but the organizers
haven't done a good job being trans

parent about where our money's
going." she said.
Aside from these concerns, senior
class presidents had difficulty secur
ing an appropriate venue. As the
chair of the formal committee. Siri
Sachs "09 revealed that they had a
limited number of options to choose
from.
"Most venues in San Francisco
won't take this kind of event any
more." Sachs said. "We did not have
that many options."
McCormick expressed similar
frustration over finding a venue. The
de Young Museum, which hosted last
year's formal, was initially a top
choice, but was unattainable.
McCormick suggested that past inci
dents might have led the museum to
decline Stanford's business this time
around.
"We got in contact with them
back in the fall, but they were not
interested in having us as one of their
clients again." McCormick said.
"It's interesting that AT&T is tak
ing us back because there were
mishaps last time, but that's also why
we have to hire additional security
this time," Sachs added.
The formal planners also faced
the difficultly of paying an upfront
fee for the venue space. The rental
costs for AT&T Park alone totaled
$17,500, leading the class presidents
to push for early ticket sales.
In spite of these challenges, the
formal organizers have remained
enthusiastic about the event.
"In general, our class has always
had unusually high attendance to
class-wide events, whether it has
been sophomore formal or junior
formal or even Senior Night,"
McCormick said."l have heard anec
dotally, from the cabinet members
who have been selling tickets in
White Plaza, that that is doing well."
Sachs echoed these sentiments.

hut is admittedly worried that ticket
prices might discourage some seniors
from attending the event.
"I've received maybe two or three
questions about it actually, and those
people still bought tickets." Sachs
noted. "Still, there might be people
who are just not bringing it up."
Indeed, some seniors have
planned a less expensive night out in
San Francisco as an alternative to the
formal, opting instead to have dinner
in the city with an intimate group of
friends.
But for seniors who do intend to
go to the formal, the event is a com
memoration of their undergraduate
years at Stanford.
"It's going to be at the end of our
four years together." Sachs conclud
ed. "For me. it feels very important to
have a very good, forming last expe
rience together and I think it's going
to be a lot of fun."
Even though some considered the
cost of the tickets to be high, they still
plan on attending.
"I've always planned on attending
senior formal, and so am willing to
accept, somewhat unhappily, the
[cost] of the event, but I recognize
that not all of my peers can do the
same." Agnew said. "It's unfortunate
that there's likely a lot of people out
there who are prohibited from going
due to the cost, when this should be a
night for the whole senior class to
enjoy."
Senior formal is scheduled for
May 9, 2009, from 9:30 p.m. to 1:30
a.m. Tickets will be on sale from
noon to 1 p.m. on Monday and
Friday in White Plaza, and from 7 to
9 p.m. in Old Union.
