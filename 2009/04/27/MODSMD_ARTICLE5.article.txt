### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
Stanford Women in Business
(SWIB) hosted its third annual "I
Don't Know to CEO" business confer
ence on Saturday, drawing many pre
professional attendees to a six-hour
series of events in Annenberg
Auditorium, which featured several
high-profile speakers, including top
executives from Wikipedia. Yahoo! and
You Tube.
Sue Gardner, executive director of
the Wikimedia Foundation, was the
conference's keynote speaker. The
Wikimedia Foundation is the non-prof
it entity responsible for operating
Wikipedia, the world's fourth most
popular Web site.
"One of the biggest pieces of advice
I would give to people just graduating
and entering the career phase of their
lives is to do what really drives you. to
not get pressured or tricked into think
ing that what drives other people is
what drives you," Gardner said.
"Follow your own path and the rewards
will follow."
Gardner also urged more women to
become involved in the Wikipedia edit
ing community, pointing out that cur
rently more than four out of five edi
tors on Wikipedia are male.
The conference featured a series of
workshops on a number of different
aspects of business, such as entrepre
neurship. marketing, networking and
even career paths after consulting.
Workshop speakers included current
Stanford Masters student Filip
Kaliszan. the founder of C'ourseRank.
CourseRank started as a project for an
undergraduate computer science class
and is now used by 97 percent of the
undergraduate student body.
The highlight of the event,
though, was a "power panel" enti
tled "View from the Top: Changing
the Face of Technology." The panel
was comprised of five speakers,
including co-founder of YouTube
Jawed Karim. former Yahoo! exec
utive Ellen Siminoff and CBS
International CEO Sophia Bekele.
The panel discussed the ways in
which technology is revolutionizing
how business is done and dispensed
advice on how to navigate the com
petitive business world.

"Follow your own
path and the
rewards will
follow."

— SUE GARDNER,
executive director of
Wikimedia Foundation

Karim emphasized the impor
tance of adaptability, pointing out
that YouTube initially started as a
dating service but changed its busi
ness model to reflect the desires of
users. Siminoff urged the audience
to not be afraid to make unconven
tional career decisions, remarking
that when she joined the founding
team at Yahoo!, most people just
thought of it as "that company with
the funny name."
Organizers argued that the idea
of "I Don't Know to CEO" was a
business conference for anyone,
regardless of their background.
"Especially [for] those who
don't yet know what they want to
do in life, but are interested in busi
ness, [I Don't Know to CEO is a
good way] to learn some basic busi
ness skills and get a sense for what
it's like in the boardroom of a real
company," added Leslie Georgatos
'09, co-president of SWIB.
The event's organizers were
extremely pleased with how the
event turned out, which was the
third annual conference hosted bv
SWIB.
"We were thrilled by the turnout
among Stanford students, new
admits and others in the communi
ty," said Melike Abacioglu '09. the
other SWIB co-president. "Every
single session was amazing."
