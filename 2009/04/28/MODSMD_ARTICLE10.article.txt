## EDITORIAL Reconfigure meal plans to include Fraiche 
### 
Students returned to Stanford this quar
ter to an unpleasant surprise: Fraiche,
the frozen yogurt shop that opened win
ter quarter in Tresidder. which students
flocked to in hoards, was no longer accepting
meal plan Cardinal Dollars. In light of the
cafe's tremendous popularity.it is little won
der that students were angered by the
change and quickly questioned Stanford
Dining's motives.
As The Daily reports today, it seems
Fraiche was never supposed to accept the
meal plan Cardinal Dollars that come auto
matically with meal plans of 10 or 14 meals a
week, but only separately purchased Cardi
nal Dollars. In addition, the mix-up was per
petuated due to a glitch in the Stanford Din
ing computer system. When Dining noticed
the glitch at the end of a billing period, they
went about fixing it. which took more than
two weeks. While the glitch has been fixed
and Fraiche is no longer accepting meal
points, overwhelming student response is a
good indication of the many improvements
Stanford Dining should consider.
At the very least. Stanford Dining should
analyze the computer system it uses for man
aging its serviees. I .ven after Dining officials
noticed the unexpected Cardinal Dollar
payouts to Fraiche. it still took more than
two weeks to rectify the problem. While yo
gurt-loving students enjoyed the continued
period during which their meal points were
still accepted, this lengthy process also
meant that students became all the more ac
customed to being able to use meal points at
Fraiche and were consequently even more
upset when the privilege was revoked a cou
ple of weeks later. Furthermore, Stanford
Dining should have communicated more
clearly to the Stanford public so that a Daily
investigation was not required in order to
simply understand what happened. Fraiche
management is unwilling to discuss the

changes with students, and Dining failed to
facilitate any kind of dialogue with the stu
dent body at large, leading to misinterpreta
tion and accusation.
But ultimately, the situation illustrates a
larger problem with Stanford Dining's
point-based system. When considering how
popular the on-campus Fraiche destination
became and how upset students were when
it stopped accepting meal points, it becomes
clear that Stanford Dining meal-plan op
tions are not satisfying all students and with
out authentic competition — particularly
venues that are open for late night snacking.
ever popular with students — the services
are not even honestly striving to compete
with Fraiche, Treehouse or the Coho, and
thus do not have large incentives to improve.
Stanford Dining points out that allowing
Fraiche into the meal plan Cardinal Dollar
club would mean allowing all the proceeds
from Fraiche sales to leave their system, ulti
mately requiring Dining to increase meal
plan costs for all. even those not appetized
by fat-free natural fresh yogurt. But Dining
could introduce further options that still
allow students to use their meal points at
Fraiche, while returning some revenue back.
For example, Fraiche could charge 1.5 or 2
times in meal plan Cardinal Points what they
charge for cash or credit payments, giving
Fraiche the regular-price revenue and Stan
ford Dining the premium. While this would
mean that some revenue would still leave
Stanford (and students would have to spend
a lot of money for a cup of frozen yogurt),
this compromise would provide a way for
students to keep using their dollars at
Fraiche if they are willing to pay the higher
prices. It would also limit Stanford's payout
and provide useful feedback to Dining bv il
lustratingjust how many students are willing
to pay a premium to eat somewhere besides
1 .ate Nite or the Axe & Palm.
