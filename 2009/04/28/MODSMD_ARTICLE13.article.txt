# Crime and Punishment
## Let the Grass Take Root 
### 
Probably the most shocking thing about
my trip to Kenya for a United Nations
Environment Programme (UNEP)
workshop on the role of the "sustainability
generation" was the customs guy at JFK who
asked me whether I was old enough to fly
alone.
Either that or the fact that a Starbucks in
the Dubai airport soils SOI FARE IX)NUTS.
Those are. however, somewhat beside the
point, though I guess that depends what the
point is.
Which actually leads me to my first point:
conversations are very difficult absent clear
definitions.
At UNEP. we heard a lot of rhetoric about
things like "sustainable development" and
"leadership," and I was left feeling emptied of
meaning after a while.
Even after assuming th thee definition of
"sustainable" is "something that can continue
indefinitely." what is sustainable develop
ment? Can it exist? I'd argue,especially after
this week,that it depends heavily on what you
define as development. Developing econom
ically forever? Forget it. Developing human
well-being forever? More possible. See what I
mean?
"Leadership" presents similar problems.
Whether someone is considered a good
leader heavily depends on what they're sup
posed to be leading. In the case of a grass
roots effort, a good leader is probably some
one who is able to connect with people, to
make them feel valued, to ensure that their
human dignity is protected and to nurture
more — many more — similar types of
leaders. In the case of a military action, a
good leader is probably someone who main
tains extreme levels of authority and re
spect, and is able to compel people to effec
tive action.
So for the second point of the day: climate
change mitigation is a verv tricky thing to trv

to lead, largely because the climate gives no
points for effort.
What I mean by this is that even if we
could mobilize the entire global community
to take some action in the name of preserving
the climate, no matter how good the inten
tions are. and no matter how hard people
work, if the actions taken do not physically
prevent the release of greenhouse gases,
they're worthless from a mitigation perspec
tive.
We could mobilize massive campaigns to
use electric cars in the American South, for
example. People could spend significant ef
fort. time and money to move to an all-elec
tric vehicle fleet. It would be a huge social ac
complishment requiring vast amounts of
grassroots leadership.
There's one problem: we forgot that the
American South gets most of its electricity
from coal, and so on balance, we're actually
worse off climatologically and otherwise
than we would have been if we'd stayed with
conventional gasoline vehicles.
So you see that grassroots leadership and
efforts are really only effective if there's
something good for the grass to take root in.
We need both the community leaders and
the somewhat dictatorial leaders who make
sure infrastructure is in place, who make
sure that there is a final expert opinion
levied somewhere — an edict that may or
may not agree with public opinion. Some
one's got to enact the top-down policies that
will make sure the grassroots efforts mobi
lize people in the right direction.
We spent last Thursday at the United Na
tions headquarters in Nairobi, where we
held a debate addressing the following topic:
"Europe and North America have caused
climate change — so why should Africans
have to do anything about it?"
I admit that 1 took issue with the ques
tion's phrasing, especially given that it was

posed hv Australians and no American had
the chance to speak. But I was very moved by
the ensuing conversation. During the debate,
the Bush administration's ... shall we say. in
ertia ... on the issue was brought up. as was
the volume of greenhouse gases produced by
the United States.
Afterward, one of the Kenyan students
went out of his way to point out that individ
ual American states and people have made
serious efforts to take action in the absence
of a federal movement. From him. the point
was far more powerful than it would have
been from me. and it reminded me once
again that the amazing power of individuals
is waiting to be harnessed and directed bv
good physical and political infrastructure.
Grassroots organizers and dictators are
going to have to work together on this one.
Americans, remember that the world is
watching. We are criticized for not ratifying
Kyoto by countries w ho have exceeded their
Kyoto limits more than we have: we are
mocked for high per capita emissions by peo
ple whose personal emissions likely, ahem,
exceed the averages for their countries. And
the criticisms are not unmerited — we have a
long way to go as a country. But it speaks to
the power of individual action that it isn't al
ways just Americans defending the small
things we have done right.
Grass, get ready to take root. But make
sure you're rooting in good soil.

At Much 0.83 over the Persian Gulf, culling this

idea. Fortunately, Emily landed. Email her at
