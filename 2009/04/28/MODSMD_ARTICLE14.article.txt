Just as a I JSC" student fiendishly hoards
their excessive inheritance (and a brief
shout out to Matt Gillespie's ass-kicking
column about Up Shit Creek), so, too, do I
lust after anthologies of quotations. A partic
ular gem is an out-of-date "Dictionary of
Quotations," compiled and edited by Bergen
Evans.
Under the title of "TAX(ES)" falls two
well-known lines out of American judicial
history. From the powerful Supreme Court
Chief Justice John Marshall, "The power to
tax involves the power to destroy." And from
Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., "Taxes
are what we pay for civilized society."
Other than explicit procrastination on my
part, I was drawn to the "Dictionary of Quo
tations" recently after reading up on the new
$167 quarterly Vaden I lealth Center fee. Ap
plied to all undergraduates currently on cam
pus (so all you B()SP,SIW and 1 lopkins folks
luck out), all enrolled graduates and a pot
pourri of other groups such as high school stu
dents in summer sessions and visiting re
searchers. the fee covers Counseling and Psy
chological Services (CAPS) and primary
medical services from Vaden. Not covered by
the fee are pharmacy prescriptions, physical
therapy and immunization services, among
others. You see Stanford. I can be slightly in
formative at times!
I am pretty confident that there is general
agreement on campus that our physical and
mental health services fill an invaluable role
on a campus filled with over-worked kooks.
and that these resources do not receive
enough funding as is.
Provost John Etchemendy.a man who has
taken more flack this year than most admin
istrators get in a lifetime, summed up such
thoughts in a now-publicized message de
fending the fee in light of massive hits to the
endowment, which provides a large portion
of the funding for our health services. And

though I am not one to defend the Universi
ty, V'aden provided a thorough Web site ex
plaining the intricacies of the fee
(http://vaden.stanford.edu/fees/).
However, a variety of problems remain.
Firstly, a large portion of the student body
was informed of the fee. not in an official
email from Etchemendy or Vaden higher
ups, but rather an internal email written by
(ireg Boardman that was circulated on a va
riety of student lists (thank you. kibbitz
means-chat!) Che fact that neither student
body — graduate nor undergraduate — was
even given a fair warning about the potential
increase is simply a continued testament to
the sheer disconnect between administrators
and students, as well as the total absence of
student input or oversight on this campus.
Another tremendous issue is the dispro
portionate effect of the fee on graduate stu
dents. Let's be terribly frank, undergrads: a
great many of us will not feel the impact on
our wallets. Hell, if The Daily had not cov
ered the topic, and kibbit/ and other lists had
not sent around a flurry of messages. I doubt
many of us undergraduates would have even
known about the fee.
For those who serve as our I'As, punch
lines for awkward sexual jokes and the sup
posed menaces around Meyer at 4 a.m. on
Saturday morning, it is an entirely different
story altogether. Cirad students can be in
school all four quarters, and as covered by an
excellent San Jose Mercury News article two
weeks ago. receive a stipend (roughly

$28.7(H)) that will not cover the expected
total costs of graduate expenses for the com
ing year. I believe firmly that Stanford is the
premier institution for undergraduate edu
cation in this country, but when you start out
pricing graduate students (literally some of
the smartest people in the whole world).then
you are in deep shit.
And so we return to my hook of quota
tions. On one hand, the funds collected hv the
fee are incredibly important in providing
basic services to our entire student body.
Vaden is terribly slow with regard to appoint
ment making, but the center is necessary for
the continued success of the I Jniversitv. The
fee is going to pay for our shred of "civiliza
tion" though if swine flu comes and wipes us
all out. then this is probably a moot point.
AX the same time, the fee is putting our
grad students under undue financial duress,
which threatens to harm the Farm in .1 variety
of ways. The University promotes the claim
that it strives to make a Stanford education
affordable for all. and for folks pursuing doc
torates. masters or advanced degrees, such a
notion becomes increasingly hollow, which
leaves Marshall's words of taxation's "power
to destroy" ringing in our ears. Or swine flu
simply owns the lot of us.
The undergraduate population gets shaft
ed a whole bunch (talking to you. Office of
Risk Management and Stanford Dining!),
but we need to take a strong stand in support
of this school's grad students by either subsi
dizing or reducing the financial burden on
the old farts in I V. Rains and the couches of
Mever at 4 a.m.

/tick would love to discuss well-known tax re
hellions, obscure quotes and student life issues
with any single History grads over Italian food
this weekend... so long as you don't have
swine flu. Interested and non-contaminated?
