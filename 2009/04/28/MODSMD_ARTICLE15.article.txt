### JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Hiere's just something about weekdays for Cardinal
baseball. Buoyed by nine runs in the seventh and eighth
innings and six errors committed by the San Francisco
Dons. Stanford (19-18.8-10 Pac-10). walked away with its
ninth straight weekday victory on Monday night after a
12-4 decision at Sunken Diamond.
Despite the six errors that the Dons committed on the
night, the Cardinal still made the plays it had to. Sopho
more second baseman Colin Walsh changed the com
plexion of the game with a two-RBI double with two outs
in the bottom of the seventh, scoring sophomores catch
er Ben Clowe and shortstop Jake Schlander. The clutch
double gave Stanford a 5-4 lead and all the momentum it
would need going into the eighth.
"The turning point of the game was Walsh's hit.'" head
coach Mark Marquess said. "That was a big hit bv Walsh."
The eighth inning was as successful for the Cardinal as
it was catastrophic for the Dons. San Francisco commit
ted four errors in the inning alone, allowing Stanford to
continue its rally â€” seven Cardinal players scored. The
inning was highlighted by third baseman Adam (Jaylord.
who hit a 3-run double to break the game open, giving
Stanford a 10-4 lead.
"It's good to see balls fall in." Gaylord said. "Beyond
that, those errors ... I think that we have one of the nicer
fields out there so I don't know what happened with [San
Francisco). I'd like to think that we took advantage of it."
Gaylord finished with four RBIs on the day. a career
high for the junior.

nal already up 12-4. Stanford catcher Zach Jones hit a
pop-up in foul territory that would normally be a routine
play. But it just wasn't a routine kind of night for the
Dons: the San Francisco pitcher, catcher and first base
man all collided into each other, with the ball just falling
out of the reach of Dons' first baseman Stephen Yarrow.
Though Jones fouled out a few pitchers later to the end
the inning, it was a play that pretty much summed up the
night for San Francisco.
Marquess was particularly baffled by the Dons' field
ing.
"I really don't know what it is." he said. "Just one of
those things.They're a better team than that."
The ('ardinal sent eight pitchers to the mound for the
night, but it was senior right-hander Max Fearnow who
earned the victory. Fearnow went three solid innings
without surrendering a hit or a run to the Dons, opening
up the opportunity for Walsh to come through with his
seventh-inning double. Despite the eight-run cushion,
sophomore closer Drew Storen was still called into the
game in the ninth; he had little trouble.retiring the Dons
