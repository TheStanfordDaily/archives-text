# BUDGET CUTS
## Fencers must raise funds to stay varsity 
### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
While most of the talk of Univer
sity budget cuts has been focused in
academic departments and student
life, the other side of Stanford — its
athletics — is proving no exception
to the dire financial situation. Since
early 2009. the rumor mill of the
Cardinal sports world has been
churning out stories about possible
cuts within the department, includ
ing the potential for elimination of
entire varsity teams.
The sports that ;ire not endowed
are presumed to be on the short list
for probable cuts, and the No. 9
Stanford fencing team is one of
them.The speculative plan.as inter
preted by members of the fencing
team, would be for a switch from a
varsity squad to a club team.
"We all understand the econom
ic situation." freshman fencer Kevin
Mo said. "We know that everyone
has to make sacrifices, but we don't
think that turning varsity fencing
into club fencing is a necessary
move."
"On a personal level, the oppor
tunity to train with the other indi
viduals on the team and to learn
from the Stanford coaches has been
one of the most valuable experi
ences I have had during college,"
junior sabre Chris Lowman added.
"I care ultimately for my individual
teammates, but the team itself —
the ability for it to represent Stan
lord's talent, interact with other
schools in the NCAA ;ind develop
with new and driven teammates —
is something that can only function
while fencing remains a varsity
sport."
In recent days, some of the ambi
guity over fencing's status has been
cleared. According to Save Stan
ford Fencing. ;i committee formed
on April 16 to help prevent (he abo
lition of the program, fencing co
head coach Lisa Milgram met with
Athletic Director Bob Bowlsby to
discuss the situation.
Members of the program were
hopeful that the University would
allow for the team to self-finance,
simply generating enough funds to
cover operating costs. However,
Bowlsby informed Milgram that the
program could continue through
the 2009-2010 season only if it was
able to raise enough funds to cover
both operating costs and the ere

ation of an endowment. The endow
ment will likely require much more
than the previous goal of a quarter
of a million dollars for operating
costs.
"In a meeting that lasted over an
hour and had parents [of fencers]
from as far away as New York. [Se
nior Associate Athletic Director for
Development] Jeff Shilling was ex
tremely helpful in outlining for the
committee what we need to accom
plish." said Melody Lowman, chair
of Save Stanford Fencing and moth
er of Chris Lowman. "He will he
supporting us as we raise 1(H) per
cent of the budget for the academic
year for 2009-2010 and go on to
raise an endowment to support the
on-going existence of fencing at
Stanford."
"We need to raise $250,000 for
the operating expense of 2009-
2010." she added. "We are working
on the endowment figure."
The athletic department did not
return inquiries by The Daily for
comment on the issue, but several
members associated with Stanford
fencing confirmed this information.
When asked if Save Stanford
Fencing was confident that this
amount could be raised. Melody
Lowman was hesitant, but opti
mistic.
"We are hopeful," she said. "In
this economy, one cannot be confi
dent of much of anything. We are
hopeful and deeply committed to
[George Pogosov, co-head coach],
Lisa and the team."
" The financial crisis calls for the
athletic department to cut some of
the teams and make expenditures
more efficient," said freshman
fencer Suraya Omar. "We under
stand that, but there is no cost to ac
tually keeping the team varsity. It
would cost the I Iniversitv very little
to keep us. We were completely sell -
funded for 15 years."
This is. in fact, the central argu
ment for the fencing team. For the
15 years leading up to the 2007-200N
season, the squad w;is entirely sell
financed. Although the fencing pro
gram is currently funded by the
University, coaches and athletes
alike are willing to revert back to
the years of self-sustenance.
Nonetheless, there is no doubt
among those involved that the ath
letic department will attempt to
preserve the rieh traditions of all ol
Cardinal sports, including fencing.
Milgram spoke highly of Bowls
bv and supported him during the
rough financial times.
"In his 35 years of being an ath
letic director, he has never cut a
sport in his life," she said. "He does
n't want to. nobody wants to."
'["he fencing program, given its
specified requirements for continu
ation. may be more fortunate than
other teams still buried in the ambi
guity of the fiscal situation. With lit
tle time left on the academic calen
dar. however, further news is likely
forthcoming in the next few weeks.
