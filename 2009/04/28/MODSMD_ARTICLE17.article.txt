# HURLING
## CARD HURLS BEST 
### ZOE LEAVITT STAFF WRITER 
Having broken ground in countless
fields of achievement over the cen
turies. Stanford recently pioneered
yet another national first while reliv
ing a classic tradition. The Stanford hurling
team continued the heloved Cardinal tradition
of heating Cal when it became the first-ever
California Collegiate Ciaelic Athletic Associa
tion champions after winning the inaugural col
legiate hurling series in American history.
Hurling, an ancient Irish sport that had lan
guished in America over the past century,
found a following in l loMo last spring. Sopho
mores Sam Svoboda and Ben Arevalo and sen
ior John Mulrow organized a small but dedicat-

Ed Stanford hurling team, gathering friends
who had never heard of the sport and teaching
them to love it.This spring, after a year of prac
tice. recruiting new members, teaching players
the game from scratch and explaining to puz
zled friends that no. it's not curling, the team
saw its progress come to fruit ion. After losing to

ruary, Stanford came back to dominate a two
game series on April 18, winning the first match
16-10 and the second match 27-14.
After February's exhibition game, the first
two collegiate teams in the country had
planned to hold a three-game series to deter

The newly formed Stanford hurling team celebrates its victory over Cal. The team hopes to
bring the sport of hurling to colleges across the nation and popularize it in the U.S.
game aggregate. Both teams im
proved rapidly since the exhibition
game, as many people who had never
held a hurley — or stick — before
joining the college team, scored
goals in the championship.
"The later game was a lot more
refined," Arevalo said. "Berkeley
had a lot of breakaways that we'd
just take the ball and reverse the mo
mentum, put them on their heels."
For Stanford, staff member Eoin
Buckley scored one goal and five
points, senior Chris Sater scored two
goals and one point, senior Marty
Casey scored two goals, sophomore

Darius Wod/iak scored one goal and
one point and Mulrow and Svoboda
scored one point each.
Besides being proud of its victory,
the Stanford hurling team is thinking
larger than the scoreboard. As excit
ing as the Cal-Stanford rivalry is. a
league with only two teams makes for
a tedious future. So the Stanford
hurlers have set out to help form
teams at other schools across the west
coast, and teams are already in the
works at USC, UCLA and the Uni
versity of Washington. Paul Bayly and
Eamonn Gormley of the San Francis
co Gaelic Athletic Association have
helped students form the CCGAA,
California Collegiate Gaelic Athletic
Association, which will organize fur
ther collegiate games.
The CCGAA league formation
has helped further invigorate hurling
fans throughout the Bay Area and
beyond. According to Arevalo, 'the
team has been receiving emails from
fans in Ireland congratulating them
for their efforts. The Stanford team
was recently featured in articles on
Irish Abroad.com and in the Irish
Times, one of Ireland's largest news
papers. Many Irish hurlers who have
watched the sport lose value in
America see the CCGAA as a new
opportunity.
"Colleges like C'al and Stanford
have a lot more brand recognition
with the American public, and thev

have rivalries pre-established in
other sports," said Eamonn Gorm
ley, SFCJAA's public relations offi
cer. "A game between Naomh
Padraigand Na Fianna doesn't mean
anything to the average viewer, but
Cal versus Stanford means some
thing and gives spectators a team to
support."
By breaking out of the Irish bub
ble, the new collegiate hurling teams
hope to continue to spark new inter
est throughout America. And as the
CCGAA league grows, its members
hope that many more college stu
dents will discover the sport, and
bring more fans along with them.
"1 have never doubted the selling
power of hurling" Gormley said.
"It's a game that has the potential to
stand toe-to-toe with the big four
American sports and still achieve
popularity. College hurling will be
the engine that drives this."
If the immigration of a sport into
the mainstream seems impossible,
just look at lacrosse, which is now
making its way over to the west
coast. While hurlers may lose their
Irish accents, the game will keep its
spirit, and maybe soon, over 3.000
years after the game's conception,
the Stanford hurlers will introduce a
new nation to an ancient sport.
