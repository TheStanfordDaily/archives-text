When the No. 2 Stanford women's water polo
team lost to No. I I ISC' in its final regular season
game, ruining the Cardinal's perfect conference
record. Stanford set its sights on an eventual re
match in the MPSI Tournament championship
game.The Cardinal got the rematch it w;is hoping
for. just not the result it wanted, losing 5 to the
Trojans in the title game on Sunday.
t Jnlike in its previous loss.Stanford jumped out
to an early lead. Four minutes into the game, jun
ior Kelly F-aton scored to put the Cardinal on the
hoard, and senior Kira llillman immediately fol
lowed with a goal of her own. llillman scored once
more at the end of the period to open Stanford's
lead to 3-0.
"We played well in nil phases of defense and on
our power play for most of
(Sunday's) game." said head coach John Tanner.
"That 's what allowed us to get off to a better start.

Stanford traded goals with the Trojans in the
second quarter to enter halftime with a 4-1 advan
tage.
I"he Trojans reenergized themselves during the
break and took control in the third period. The
I JSC defense denied Stanford any scoring oppor
tunities. while Michelle Stein scored twice to cut
the deficit to 4-3.
Senior Lauren Silver scored with five minutes
to play in the game to end a 15 minute Stanford
scoreless streak and give the Cardinal a little
breathing room.
Two goals proved not to be enough, however.
I S( scored on a 6-on 5 power play and again
on a penalty shot to tie the game at 5-5.
With just under two minutes to play. Stanford
had a golden opportunity to grab a late lead, but
could not score off a I JSC ejection.
Hie Trojans scored with 47 seconds left to take
their first and only lead of the game. I he Cardinal
could not convert on its final possession and
watched as I JSC held onto the hall to secure the

championship victory.
"We game shifted in the third quarter when we
were called for a slew of offensive and exclusion
fouls." Tanner said. "Just the same, we had a two
goal lead down the stretch and made some poor
decisions."
Stanford advanced to the championship after
an 11-10 overtime victory over IK'I.A on Satur
day and a 13-6 thrashing of S;m I )iego State on Iri
day.
Against the Bruins. Stanford found itself in a
usual position â€” trailing. Down 3-2 at the end of
the first period and 5-4 at halftime. the Cardinal
rallied late, as Hillman and Silver scored to mo
mentarily tie the game at 9- ( >. Stanford could not
hold onto the lead, though, as IK I A scored on a
penalty shot with four minutes to play.
With a little more than two minutes left, junior

it would stay through the end ol regulation.
