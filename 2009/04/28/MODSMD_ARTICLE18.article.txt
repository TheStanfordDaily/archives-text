When the No. 2 Stanford women's water polo
team lost to No. I I ISC' in its final regular season
game, ruining the Cardinal's perfect conference
record. Stanford set its sights on an eventual re
match in the MPSI Tournament championship
game.The Cardinal got the rematch it w;is hoping
for. just not the result it wanted, losing 5 to the
Trojans in the title game on Sunday.
t Jnlike in its previous loss.Stanford jumped out
to an early lead. Four minutes into the game, jun
ior Kelly F-aton scored to put the Cardinal on the
hoard, and senior Kira llillman immediately fol
lowed with a goal of her own. llillman scored once
more at the end of the period to open Stanford's
lead to 3-0.
"We played well in nil phases of defense and on
our power play for most of
(Sunday's) game." said head coach John Tanner.
"That 's what allowed us to get off to a better start.

Stanford traded goals with the Trojans in the
second quarter to enter halftime with a 4-1 advan
tage.
I"he Trojans reenergized themselves during the
break and took control in the third period. The
I JSC defense denied Stanford any scoring oppor
tunities. while Michelle Stein scored twice to cut
the deficit to 4-3.
Senior Lauren Silver scored with five minutes
to play in the game to end a 15 minute Stanford
scoreless streak and give the Cardinal a little
breathing room.
Two goals proved not to be enough, however.
I S( scored on a 6-on 5 power play and again
on a penalty shot to tie the game at 5-5.
With just under two minutes to play. Stanford
had a golden opportunity to grab a late lead, but
could not score off a I JSC ejection.
Hie Trojans scored with 47 seconds left to take
their first and only lead of the game. I he Cardinal
could not convert on its final possession and
watched as I JSC held onto the hall to secure the

championship victory.
"We game shifted in the third quarter when we
were called for a slew of offensive and exclusion
fouls." Tanner said. "Just the same, we had a two
goal lead down the stretch and made some poor
decisions."
Stanford advanced to the championship after
an 11-10 overtime victory over IK'I.A on Satur
day and a 13-6 thrashing of S;m I )iego State on Iri
day.
Against the Bruins. Stanford found itself in a
usual position — trailing. Down 3-2 at the end of
the first period and 5-4 at halftime. the Cardinal
rallied late, as Hillman and Silver scored to mo
mentarily tie the game at 9- ( >. Stanford could not
hold onto the lead, though, as IK I A scored on a
penalty shot with four minutes to play.
With a little more than two minutes left, junior
Alex Koran scored to tie the game at 10-10. where
it would stay through the end ol regulation.

Stanford had an early three-point lead over No. 1 USC in the MPSF Tourna
ment championship game, but could not hold the lead and eventually fell 6-
5. The Cardinal hopes to get an at-large berth into the NCAA tournament
Neither team scored in the first
overtime period, but Koran once
again came up big for the Cardinal in
the second overtime period. With
the game still tied. Koran scored the
game-winner with 2:05 left in the
game.
Silver led all Stanford scorers
with three goals, while freshman
Melissa Seidemann scored twice.
The Cardinal could not have
asked for a better opening-round
performance than the one it turned
against San Diego State.
Stanford jumped out to a 5-0 lead
in the first period and never looked
back. Freshman Alyssa Lo paced the
Cardinal with two first-period goals,
while freshman Pallavi Menon. jun
ior Kelly Eaton, sophomore Kim
Krueger, Silver and Seidemann each
tacked on a goal as well.
I'he story of the game, though,
was Koran. The southern California
native started her tournament off on
a good note with four goals on the
day.
"Alex scored some terrific goals
on Friday and Saturday to help get
us to the championship game," Tan
ner said.
Bv failing to win its conference

tournament, Stanford has put its fu
ture in someone else's hands. The
Cardinal will wait and hope for an
at-large bid to the 2009 National
Collegiate Championship, sched
uled for the weekend of May 8 in
Colleee Park. Md.
