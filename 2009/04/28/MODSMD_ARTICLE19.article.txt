# Surprised by Lopez? Don't be
## 
### 
Derrick Rose was named
NBA Rookie of the Year
last week. Congratulations
to hipi — the young Chica
go Bull was certainly deserving of the
award. Among the people he beat out
were OJ Mayo of Memphis and
Brook Lopez of New Jersey, who
placed second and third, respectively
— and both of them had stellar sea
sons.
Lope/, the former Stanford stand
out who led the Cardinal to the Sweet
16 last year, finished the year averag
ing 13 points. K. 1 rebounds and I.X
blocks per game I le improved as the
season progressed, was putting up
close to 15pointsand 10 rebounds per
contest by the end of the year.and did
it all even though he was frequently
the third, if not fourth, option on the
Nets. In the process, he established
himself as one of the three best young
centers in the league.
It was a season of affirmation for
I .ope/ after he inexplicably fell to the
tenth pick in the draft despite being
projected as high as third (insert
Michael ( "rabtree reference here il
was a coin flip between a I .ope/ and a
Ni l. Draft column). ITie word in June
was that Lope/ fell because he was
not fluid enough to be successful
against athletic NBA big men. I "won
der how many scouts still feel that
way.
It was. and remains, a curious com
ment. Did they watch his play against
Marquette in last year's NCAA sec
ond round, when lie put the Cardinal
on his back and hit a game winning
shot that is simply impossible to make
if you're a stiff? Did they not watch
throughout his entire Stanford career,
as he displayed a combination of de
fensive and offensive prowess that is
rarely seen at the collegiate level? It's
no secret that scouts tend to overana
lyze, and the fact that Lope/ couldn't
do a lOKO reverse windmill apparent
ly hurt him.even though he was one of
the most NBA-ready players in the
draft.
But. no worries. Lope/ found him
self in a good situation in New Jersey,
and succeeded accordingly. Yet this
idea that he was somehow ill-pre
pared for the league persisted and. as
he continued to play well, became one
of the memos of the NBA season:
"Look at the kid in New Jersey
who could have seen that coming?!"
From Hoops Hype to LSI'N, fans
and writers were bewildered by his
triumphs. The Worldwide Leader's
David lliorpe said. "Not even the
Nets expected Lope/, to be this good
this quickly, lie is a threat on both
sides of the ball, able to play slow but
excellent in early-offense schemes,
and a willing screener and rebound
cr."
Let's check ourselves here. In a
conference that, in Lope/'s sopho
more season, had a vast number of
prolific big men, he was top-five in re
bounding. scoring and blocks. He
made improvements in nearly all as
pects of his game between his first and
second years on the Farm, and
showed little indication that he was
niaxing out. Furthermore, there was
rarely a question of Lope/'s effort or

dedication to the intricacies of the
game. So on his end. he had the tools
necessary for success.
Then, examine his situation in
New Jersey. With an ever-improving
Devin Harris and a still-dangerous
when-he-feels-like-it Vince Carter
around him. Lopez did not have to
he"the man" immediately in East
Rutherford. Furthermore, there is a
vacuum of good centers in the East
ern Conference, with just a few play
ers (see: Howard. Dwight) estab
lished as premier fives. With effec
tive teammates and professional —
but not stellar — competition at his
position.it was hardly inconceivable
that he could have such a fine rookie
season.
Should it have been expected?

Absolutely, at least to some degree. It
was hardly a question that he would
contribute substantially out of the
gate. He did more than that, and
looks like a budding star in that
way. perhaps it was a bit unexpected.
But by reading your favorite sports
Web site, you'd think that he was
some small prospect from a school in
Andorra that picked up basketball
last week, when in fact he's been high
ly touted since the womb.
It is a maddening storyline, and yet
it persists. But ask the Sixth Man if
they thought Lopez could contribute
immediately in the pros. Homerism
aside, their expectations would be
more accurate than the teams who
passed him by, and the media mem
bers who stand shocked at his early
success.
