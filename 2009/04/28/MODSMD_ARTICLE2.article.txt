## Group meets to plan and prepare response 
### ERIC MESSINGER DESK EDITOR 
With fears of swine flu rising — the World
Health Organization has voted to raise its
global pandemic flu alert level — Stanford is
taking precautionary steps to meet any possi
ble threat.
In response to the outbreak, which has
drawn heavy attention from both the media
and public health officials, members of
Stanford's Infectious Disease Working
Group (IDWG) met over the weekend to
take steps to address the situation.

"We were concerned about the rapid
emergence of the swine flu situation and
what response measures to recommend for
the University," said Ira Friedman, director of
Vaden I lealth Center, in an email to The
Daily.
Friedman emphasized that the rapid pace
of the outbreak, combined with a number of
unanswered questions surrounding the dis
ease, both encouraged the meeting and posed
a significant problem.
"One difficult feature currently is how fast
the situation is emerging and how much
uncertainty there is at this point about the
virus and the disease it is causing." Friedman
said.
Associate Vice Provost for Environmental
Health and Safety Larry Gibbs. also a mem
ber of I DWG, expressed confidence in the
University's readiness.
"Stanford takes emergency planning very

seriously," he said. "We have had for a num
ber of years an active. University-wide emer
gency plan that can he applied to these situa
tions."
The I DWG came up with an initial set of
responses that the members hope will
increase preparedness, focusing upon inform
ing the Stanford community of the most rele
vant news.
"At this stage of the situation, communica
tion and education are the key measures,
through Web sites, flyers in residences and
emails," Friedman said. "We have reviewed
our response plans to make sure that all areas
... were ready for their response roles."
Gibbs reiterated that communication is
crucial, especially as the outbreak is overlap
ping with the period when symptoms of more
typical flu are expected.
"The key is to communicate to individu
als." Gibbs said. "We have to see if people

have flu-like symptoms, they're not just hav
ing the tlu. as we're at the tail end of influen
za season."
Gibbs added that those treating any
reported patients have been instructed to
inquire carefully about recent travel to affect
ed areas.
If the need arises to address a suspected
case of swine flu on the campus. Gibbs
explained that the response would escalate as
necessary through a number of possible
responses.
"Our contingency planning includes isola
tion and social distancing." Gibbs said.
"Currently." he added, "our plan is to inform
people."
Gibbs acknowledged, however, that the
University environment would pose signifi
cant problems, ones the IDWG hoped to
overcome.
"We have a large residential population in

fairly close living quarters." Gibbs said.
"That's always a challenge."
"But if a student shows symptoms, we do
have action plans for that." Gibbs added.
International travel has also undergone
scrutiny, given the swine flu's apparent ori
gins in Mexico and the quick path of its
spread. Friedman noted that the University
"has decided to recommend that students not
travel to Mexico." which he referred to as
"the most affected area."
Gibbs added that the situation outside of
the campus is being closely monitored.
"We're tracking what's going on in the rest
of the world." Gibbs said.
Gibbs and Friedman are the co-founders
of the I DWG. which began in 2003 in
response to elevated public concern sur
rounding the worldwide spread of SARS. In
its full complement, it consists of a
broad collection of campus staff and
administrators, including represen
tatives from Vaden, Stanford
Hospital, the School of Medicine,
the Department of Public Safety, the
Office of University
Communications, Residential
Dining & Enterprises and the Office
of the Vice Provost of Student
Affairs.
According to the Santa Clara
Health Department, no cases of
swine flu have been reported in
Santa Clara County, where Stanford
is located.
