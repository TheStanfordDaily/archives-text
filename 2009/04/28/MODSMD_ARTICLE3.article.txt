## Conviction in Stanford suicide case Colorado doctor gets jail for illegal medical practice 
### CHRISTINE McFADDEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Colorado doctor Christian
Hageseth was sentenced to nine
months in a ( olorado prison last week
after prescribing Prozac to John
McKay, a Stanford student who com
mitted suicide in 2005.
When Hageseth approved McKay's
online application for the drug fluoxe
tine. a tangled web of legal issues, viola
tions and criminal prosecution ensued,
only to be resolved four years later.
McKay, following his freshman year
at Stanford, submitted an online appli
cation requesting medication for what
he described as adult attention deficit
disorder (ADD), as well as "moderate"
depression. However, McKay claimed
to be not suicidal.
"My son John clearly made an error
in judgment when, in retrospect, he was
attempting to simultaneously hide and
deal with a serious medical problem
(depression) while in a vulnerable state
of mind." said McKay's father and for
mer Stanford Structural Biology
Professor David McKay.
Hageseth. working in Colorado, pre
scribed and shipped Prozac to John
McKay, despite working under a
restricted license and having never per
sonally examined the student himself.
McKay argued that contrary to
Hageseth's public claim that he was
licensed to write prescription renewals,
Hageseth's restricted license limited
him to administrative duties in clinical
trials and specifically forbade him from
writing prescriptions.
"At the time Christian Hageseth
began writing Internet prescriptions, it
is clear that he understood he was not
licensed to do so." McKay continued.
"[He knew] that his restricted
Colorado medical license was 'restrict
ed to research activities related to clin
ical trials of medications ... * and that
he '... may not prescribe medications
nor may he authorize prescription
orders.'"
Ninety capsules of the drug were
shipped to John, who resided in Menlo
Park. Prozac carries the Pood and Drug
Administration (IDA)-mandated
"black box" warning of "increased risks
of suicidal thinking and behavior,
known as suicidiality. in young adults ..
. during initial treatment (generally the
first one or two months)."
"He did so with no knowledge of. let
alone diagnosis of. John." McKay
said of Hageseth's shipment. "To
blindly prescribe a dangerous drug
to an adolescent is unacceptable."
Seven weeks later, on Aug. 2.
2005. McKay committed suicide by
carbon monoxide poisoning after
rolling up the windows in his car
and pumping in emissions.
Toxicology reports revealed that
McKay had both alcohol and fluox
etine in his system.
McKay's family filed a complaint
that October with the Medical
Board of California. After an inves
tigation. the board recommended
criminal prosecution to the San
Mateo County District Attorney.
In June 2006, San Mateo prose
cutors charged Hageseth with a
felony count of practicing medicine
without a license. According to
McKay, Hageseth's defense attor
ney. Carleton Briggs, did everything
possible to halt the case from mov
ing forward.
Several issues were brought up.
including jurisdiction and if
California could try an individual
who had been acting from out-of
state. In an appellate court in
California, it was unanimously ruled
that the state did indeed have juris
diction. Briggs filed an appeal to the
California Supreme Court, but it
was refused.
Briggs then argued that
Hageseth could not be extradited to
California because he had never
been in the state and was not fleeing
justice there. Colorado. Hageseth's
residence, was uncooperative in
extraditing him. However, in 2007,
Hageseth was extradited from
Nebraska due to a minor traffic vio
lation. which sent him to California
once Nebraskan law enforcement
found that there was a warrant out
for his arrest.
Judge James Ellis of the County
Superior Court sentenced I iageseth
on April 17 to nine months in
prison. Hageseth pleaded no contest
and was convicted of practicing
medicine illegally, but was neither
charged with prescribing the wrong

drug, nor held responsible for
McKay's death. Hageseth was addi
tionally ordered to pay $4,200 to the
California medical hoard for their
initial investigation.
This is one of the first cases deal
ing with the prescription of
"telemedicine," or ordering and
prescribing drugs from the phone or
over the Internet. What made this
case complicated was the issuance
of drugs over state lines, setting a
precedent for doctors issuing pre
scriptions in states in which their
medical license may not extend.
In an interview with The Daily,
Briggs argued that the conviction
would have important ramifications
for the future of telemedicine.
"I think the better solution is for
the federal government to regulate
the practice of medicine across state
lines," he said. "What's happening
here is that the state of California is
putting an end to telemedicine
because now any doctor who is not
licensed in all 50 states would be
cra/y to practice telemedicine. As a
practical matter, you can't be
licensed in all 50 states."
Professor Robert Weisberg, the
director of Stanford's Criminal
Justice Center, argued that the con
viction confirms the point of juris
diction law.
"State criminal jurisdiction law
is tricky in these cases where the
crime is a communication across
state lines, but this is a fair reading
of jurisdictional principles," he
wrote in an email to The Daily.
"Note that in theory, Colorado
could have prosecuted him as well,
and double jeopardy law would
not prevent two separate states
from punishing for the 'same'
crime."
In the end, McKay was pleased
with the strong precedent that the
case set and hopes that in the
future doctors will be more respon
sible when prescribing medication.
"Individuals writing such pre
scriptions can now rethink whether
the quick and easy money they
make doing it is worth the risk of a
felony conviction and the perma
nent loss of medical license in all
states that would go along with it."
McKav said.
