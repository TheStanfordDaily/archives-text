## Conviction in Stanford suicide case Colorado doctor gets jail for illegal medical practice 
### CHRISTINE McFADDEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Colorado doctor Christian
Hageseth was sentenced to nine
months in a ( olorado prison last week
after prescribing Prozac to John
McKay, a Stanford student who com
mitted suicide in 2005.
When Hageseth approved McKay's
online application for the drug fluoxe
tine. a tangled web of legal issues, viola
tions and criminal prosecution ensued,
only to be resolved four years later.
McKay, following his freshman year
at Stanford, submitted an online appli
cation requesting medication for what
he described as adult attention deficit
disorder (ADD), as well as "moderate"
depression. However, McKay claimed
to be not suicidal.
"My son John clearly made an error
in judgment when, in retrospect, he was
attempting to simultaneously hide and
deal with a serious medical problem
(depression) while in a vulnerable state
of mind." said McKay's father and for
mer Stanford Structural Biology
Professor David McKay.
Hageseth. working in Colorado, pre
scribed and shipped Prozac to John
McKay, despite working under a
restricted license and having never per
sonally examined the student himself.
McKay argued that contrary to
Hageseth's public claim that he was
licensed to write prescription renewals,
Hageseth's restricted license limited
him to administrative duties in clinical
trials and specifically forbade him from
writing prescriptions.
"At the time Christian Hageseth
began writing Internet prescriptions, it
is clear that he understood he was not
licensed to do so." McKay continued.
"[He knew] that his restricted
Colorado medical license was 'restrict
ed to research activities related to clin
ical trials of medications ... * and that
he '... may not prescribe medications
nor may he authorize prescription
orders.'"
Ninety capsules of the drug were
shipped to John, who resided in Menlo
Park. Prozac carries the Pood and Drug
Administration (IDA)-mandated
"black box" warning of "increased risks
of suicidal thinking and behavior,
known as suicidiality. in young adults ..
. during initial treatment (generally the
first one or two months)."
