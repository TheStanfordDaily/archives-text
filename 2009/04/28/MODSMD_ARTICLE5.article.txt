## Fraiche payment glitch resolved 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES EDITOR IN CHIEF 
Students who frequented the new 112 raiche
location in Ircsidder Union last quarter were
disappointed to find at the beginning of spring
that the yogurt shop no longer accepts meal
plan ( 'ardinal dollars.
The change, which led to rumors of an inten
tional modification by Stanford Dining
because of I raiche's popularity, was actually
the result of a winter-quarter computer glitch,
according to Michael (iratz. executive director
of Hospitality & Auxiliaries for Residential A:
Dining Enterprises.
(iratz. who oversees Stanford Dining's
retail cafes, explained the issue in an email to
The Dailv.

"Shortly after Fraiche opened [at the end of
January], the Stanford Meal Plan Office was
informed that the computer programming of
the register was accepting meal plan dollars
instead of purchased ( ardinal Dollars." he said.
"This was an oversight in the programming and
resulted in the cash register system accepting
meal plan dollars. This computer glitch was
fixed over spring break and announced at the
Fraiche store to all students."
(iratz added that Fraiche does, however,
still accept purchased Cardinal dollars, which
can be added to a student's account separate
ly from the meal plan. Still, the loss of meal
plan acceptance has left many confused over
the change, and some still hoping that they
can use their meal plan dollars again at
Fraiche.

purchased Cardinal dollars

While man> students confuse the

two types of ("ardinal dollars themselves.
Gratz explained that the difference is impor
tant toward understanding why Fraiche can no
longer accept meal plan dollars.
Purchased Cardinal dollars can he used at
all Dining locations, as well as Fraiche; the dol
lars function like actual money and can he
directed as necessary, based on their use.
On the other hand, meal plan dollars come
from money that is already in the Stanford sys
tern, coming from the board bill students pay
each quarter, 112 raiche. however, is not a
Stanford-owned location nor is it a fran
chised location, like Subwav and is instead

under

contract between

Hospitality & Auxiliaries and Fraiche owners
Patama Roj and Jessica Gilmartin.
The dollars must remain within the Stanford
system to ensure Dining's revenue and to pre
vent meal plan prices from increasing dramati
callv. according to Gratz.
"The majority of students would validate
the importance of keeping room and board
rate increases low and understand that Fraiche
can only accept Cardinal dollars purchased
outside of the Student Dining program because
