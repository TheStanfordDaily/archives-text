## Fraiche payment glitch resolved 
### CHRISTIAN TORRES EDITOR IN CHIEF 
Students who frequented the new 112 raiche
location in Ircsidder Union last quarter were
disappointed to find at the beginning of spring
that the yogurt shop no longer accepts meal
plan ( 'ardinal dollars.
The change, which led to rumors of an inten
tional modification by Stanford Dining
because of I raiche's popularity, was actually
the result of a winter-quarter computer glitch,
according to Michael (iratz. executive director
of Hospitality & Auxiliaries for Residential A:
Dining Enterprises.
(iratz. who oversees Stanford Dining's
retail cafes, explained the issue in an email to
The Dailv.

"Shortly after Fraiche opened [at the end of
January], the Stanford Meal Plan Office was
informed that the computer programming of
the register was accepting meal plan dollars
instead of purchased ( ardinal Dollars." he said.
"This was an oversight in the programming and
resulted in the cash register system accepting
meal plan dollars. This computer glitch was
fixed over spring break and announced at the
Fraiche store to all students."
(iratz added that Fraiche does, however,
still accept purchased Cardinal dollars, which
can be added to a student's account separate
ly from the meal plan. Still, the loss of meal
plan acceptance has left many confused over
the change, and some still hoping that they
can use their meal plan dollars again at
Fraiche.

Meal plan Cardinal collars and
purchased Cardinal dollars

While man> students confuse the

two types of ("ardinal dollars themselves.
Gratz explained that the difference is impor
tant toward understanding why Fraiche can no
longer accept meal plan dollars.
Purchased Cardinal dollars can he used at
all Dining locations, as well as Fraiche; the dol
lars function like actual money and can he
directed as necessary, based on their use.
On the other hand, meal plan dollars come
from money that is already in the Stanford sys
tern, coming from the board bill students pay
each quarter, 112 raiche. however, is not a
Stanford-owned location nor is it a fran
chised location, like Subwav and is instead

under

contract between

Hospitality & Auxiliaries and Fraiche owners
Patama Roj and Jessica Gilmartin.
The dollars must remain within the Stanford
system to ensure Dining's revenue and to pre
vent meal plan prices from increasing dramati
callv. according to Gratz.
"The majority of students would validate
the importance of keeping room and board
rate increases low and understand that Fraiche
can only accept Cardinal dollars purchased
outside of the Student Dining program because

it is not owned or operated by
Stanford." Gratz wrote in his email to
The Daily. "Given the current eco
nomic challenges, it is important to
bring value to students by providing
additional dining options in a fiscally
responsible manner."
The executive director further
noted that next year's board increase
is only 1.4 percent, which is low con
sidering the rising costs of food.
As for the meal plan dollars that
were spent by students in the winter.
Gratz said Stanford Dining honored
the fact that there was a glitch and
passed the appropriate revenue on to
Fraiche.
When asked why Fraiche was not
made aware of the meal plan distinc
tion beforehand. Gratz said that not
allowing meal plan dollars "was not
part of the business terms of our con
tract." and Dining did not find it nec
essary to notify Fraiche about meal
plan dollars given that the transaction
system should have worked correctly.
Current Fraiche employees and
co-owner Jessica Gilmartin declined
comment. A former Fraiche employ
ee. however, who asked to remain
anonymous for the sake of her rela
tionship with her former employer,
said the glitch was a source of consid
erable confusion among staff.
"Suddenly, the cards stopped
working one day."the former
employee said."and we ended up just
writing down everyone's ID num
ber."
A few days later, the employee
came to work again and was told by
her shift leader that Stanford Dining

"viewed [Fraiche] as a threat" and
would no longer allow the establish
ment to accept students' meal plans.
In actuality, a monthly report from
Dinings transaction system — han
dled off-site by Infogenesis—
revealed at the beginning of March
that the store's system had been func
tioning like regular Stanford Dining
locations, at which meal plan dollars
are deducted from first, followed by
purchased Cardinal dollars. Once the
problem was noted, it took a little
over two weeks for Infogenesis to
resolve.
While the issue was eventually
cleared up. the former employee said
she did not understand why it wasn't
made clear to Fraiche staff earlier on.
Potential for meal plan changes
While the loss of meal plan
acceptance at Fraiche has a reason,
many students are still upset by the
change and hope they can someday
use meal plan dollars once again.
"Because they stopped accepting
[meal plan) Cardinal Dollars. I'm not
going to go there as much." said Lane
Hartman '12. "That means 1 have to
spend my own money on it...
Fraiche costs roughly a meal at
Subway."
Marie Baylon "12 questioned the
Stanford Dining Cardinal dollar sys
tem and its relationship with inde
pendently owned businesses like
Fraiche.
"I think the Stanford Dining
Cardinal dollar affiliation is really
random," she said. "Often, the tastiest
and most popular places do not
accept (meal plan] Cardinal dollars.
Further, compared to other college
campuses, Stanford's lack of variety
creates monopoly and diminishes
competition. On a campus like ours,
where accessibility to the areas

beyond campus can be difficult, pro
viding students with a selection of
delicious and affordable options
should be a primary concern."
Employees at Fraiche. Dining and
even ASSU President David Gobaud
'ON M.S. '10 have all received com
plaints.
"Every time 1 talk to people,
they're not happy." Gobaud said of
the Fraiche reaction.
In response, Gobaud is starting a
conversation with students and
Stanford Dining about how the meal
plan system can be restructured to
allow students to use meal plan dol
lars at Fraiche and other campus
locations that currently don't accept
them.
According to Gobaud. one idea
put forward was to put a 50 percent
premium on Fraiche purchases using
meal plan dollars. For example, a five
dollar yogurt at Fraiche would
instead cost $7.50 in meal plan dol
lars. with five dollars going to Fraiche
itself and $2.50 to Stanford Dining.
"We're interested in what students
think about this, so we'd like for them
to contact us and also give us further
ideas." Gobaud said. "We'll then talk
to Dining and see if it's feasible."
When asked about starting a con
versation with students about
expanding the current meal plan sys
tem. Gratz was very open, but he
emphasized the need for looking at
the budget and assessing the poten
tial impact on students' bills if a
change was made.
"The question is not whether we
want to do it — its what the financial
impact would be if we did." Gratz
said.
"At the end of the day, we want to
bring value to the students," he
added.
"We want to bring more choices, and

those choices can't always be on the
meal plan."
