# ADMINISTRATION
## Budgets cut in three depts. 
### ELIZABETH TITUS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Budget cuts affecting the Stanford Alumni Association, the
Development Office and the Division of Land. Buildings & Real
Estate were announced last week, and administrators are now deal
ing with the ramifications of 49 layoffs and decreased funding for
the three divisions.
Provost John Etchemendv expressed regret at the layoffs in an
email to The Daily, saying that they were unavoidable.
"In all cases, of course. I am extremely sad about the loyal staff
who have been laid off in the process," Etchemendv said. "These are
all wonderful people who have contributed a huge amount to the
University. It's tragic when the University is forced to lay off people
like that. I wish it could be avoided."
Though he noted that expectations for the divisions would
change due to their now smaller budget cuts. Etchemendv is hope
ful that they will still continue to serve the University well.
"Do I think the development office will continue to fundraise
adequately?" the Provost asked. "We have the best development
office, and the most loyal alumni in the country, so I am confident
that they will continue to perform well. I feel equally confident
about the Alumni Association and Land. Buildings and Real
Estate."
According to Martin Shell, vice president for development, the
Office of Development is taking strong steps to cut costs beyond
last week's layoffs.
The division is shifting publications from print to online, and
scaling back on events.
Because of the toll that the recession has taken on the University
endowment — Stanford CFO Randy Livingston has estimated that
the value of the endowment will be down 30 percent b\ the end of
this fiscal year — the work of the development office is more
important than ever.
"Our donors want to help Stanford make it through this rough
patch, and they are interested in helping where they can make the
most difference." Shell said. "For example, we are receiving ques
tions about how gifts can help in sustaining our enhanced financial
aid program for undergraduates. Donors also want to ensure that
we maintain some of the newer programs established over the past
few years."
While Shell acknowledged that he has seen donations slow since
the financial crisis began, he said that
high volatility makes it impossible to
present a clear picture of fundraising
for the fiscal year.
The Division of Land. Buildings &.
Real Estate (LRBE) is facing a situa
tion similar to that of the Office of
Development.
Robert Reidy. vice president of
LRBE.says the divisions budget was
cut by $8.3 million, equivalent to 15
percent.
According to Reidy, the cuts
involved a salary freeze for all staff
and a salary reduction for executive
management ($1.5 million), reduc-

tions in planning, engineering studies,
conference attendance and office
equipment ($l.l million), business
process changes ($4.4 million) and
staff reductions and layoffs ($1.3 mil
lion).
"Our ability to realize efficiencies
in a variety of business processes will
be critical in the coming months and
years." he said. "We are encouraged by
our initial steps."
The Alumni Association laid off 10
employees on Tuesday and faces an
upcoming $2.7 million budget cut.
according to Association President
Howard Wolf. Three more employees
left voluntarily, six took a time reduc
tion and four vacant positions were
eliminated.
Wolf cited several additional cost
saving measures that the Alumni
Association will take, including the

reduction of printed materials and the
elimination of certain in-person com
ponents of an alumni continuing stud
ies program.
The Association, which serves
some 2()2.(XX) alumni worldwide, is
funded by three sources: the general
fund, a lifetime membership fund
invested in the endowment and sever
al businesses such as Stanford Sierra
Camp.
According to Wolf, these sources
are under "tremendous pressure."
Despite cuts, he said that alumni
are still confident in the University's
leadership.
"Stanford's alumni have tremen
dous faith in the president and the
provost" Wolf said. "All the indica
tions I've had in discussions... sug
gest that they're actually very comfort
able that we're looking at these things

strategically and responding appropri
ately."
According to Etchemendy, the
timing of this round of cuts has no sig
nificance.
"All units were notified of their
overall general funds allocations at the
same time, but units needed different
amounts of preparation and planning
before they could announce their final
decisions." he said. "There is no signif
icance to the tact that one school or
administrative unit might complete
this process sooner or later than
another."
