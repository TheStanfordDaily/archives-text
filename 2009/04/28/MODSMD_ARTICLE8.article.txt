## Me, You and the ASSU An in-depth look at the history of the student organization 
### VINEET SINGAL SHIA WANG 
The Associated Students of Stanford
University (ASSU) elections are over,
and the freshly elected candidates
must now perform their duties. David
Gobaud '08. M.S. '10 and Jay de la
Torre '10 are transitioning into their roles as
ASSU Executives, just as the organization is
channeling its efforts into a wider range of topics.
"['Hie ASSU has changed] from an organiza
tion that has focused primarily on student [and]
campus life issues, and has expanded its scope and
influence to tackle broader campus and commu
nity issues," said Vice Provost Greg Boardman.
The elected individuals are part of an histori
cal association, and the history of ASSU. while rel
atively unknown, is rich and full of interesting fac
toids about Stanford life.
The Early Years
The ASSU was organized on Oct. 20.1891. and
all registered students were members.
"The ASSU works to represent the interests,
needs and perspectives of Stanford students." said
Maggie Kimball, the University historian.
Ihe early committees of the ASSU included
Constitution and Bylaws, School Colors.
University Yell. Cooperative Association. Bulletin
Board and College Paper.
According to Kimball, the Constitution was
substantially rewritten in 1893-1894 for greater
accountability, which was initially lacking. In fact,
it is a relatively unknown fact that the color "car
dinal" was chosen by the ASSU.
"[The color selection) was kind of important
because they were originally kx)king at white and
gold," Kimball said. "It was the ASSU that made
official the precise shade of cardinal red from
among many swatches in 1893."
One of the most important responsibilities of
the original ASSU. according to its Web site, was
managing athletic teams and events.
"After all the Directors Cup we've won. I'm
sure the original ASSU would be proud." de la
Torre said.
Ihe group was in charge of hiring coaches,
managing the teams and handling gate receipts.
They used the income from the yearly Big Game,
for example, to help fund other teams and activi
ties for the entire year.
A Feb. 15. PXX) expense report from The Daily
Palo Alto describes how the ASSU spent its
money. In Dec. 1899, for example, the ASSU
spent $10,627.38 on things like the Ihanksgiving
show, tennis net repairs and band expenses using
profits from foot ball, tennis and basketball events.
However, the early ASSU was constantly on
the verge of bankruptcy. According to the ASSU
Web site, financial difficulties hindered the organ
ization from having notable effects on the
University. As a result, its responsibilities shifted.
In 1917. the Board of Athletic Control, a de facto
athletics department, was established, alleviating
ASSU of the burden of athletic events.
World War II and Beyond
"While the present war has put a more serious
emphasis on our work, it has also made us more
unified and spirited." said Ed Stamm '43, MBA
•47. then-president of the ASSU, in the Sept. 28.
1942 issue of The Daily. "Many campus activities
are planned for the next year, and we are all look
ing forward to a fine school year."
Indeed, this trend of progressivism continued
as America's entrv into World War II changed the
face of Stanford in the 19405. Female leaders

arose and took the charge as the population of
males on campus decreased. Janet McClanahan
'44, for example, became the ASSU's first female
president.
In fact. Peter Bing'ss was elected President of
the ASSU in 1954 and his Vice President was
Dianne Goldman '55 — now Senator Dianne
Feinstein of California.
Moreover, as the war ended, so did the domi
nance of a particular culture on campus.
Underrepresented populations, such as African
Americans, became more visible on campus as
the country became deeply divided on the issue of
racial equality. Many highly publicized acts of civil
disobedience occurred during the late 's()s and
early Wis on campus.
"The ASSU's responsiveness to such changes
can be seen through its willingness to correct past
wrongs, as it did when it overturned its earlier
decision to use an Indian caricature as the
school's mascot." the ASSU Web site states.
The organization also got more international
as a result of American involvement in foreign
wars.
According to Kimball, the ASSU oversaw the
Institute of International Relations, formed in
1947 by merging the Stanford Overseas
Information Service and other international
groups on campus. The ASSU also oversaw the
Speakers Bureau and the Elections Review
Board.
"The Speakers Bureau that the ASSU over
saw has really brought in some amazing speak
ers." Kimball noted.
The '7(K and *WK
In the '70s and \S()s. the student organization
boomed because of the elevation of awareness
both on campus and across the nation.This hurst
in student organization activity initiated the diver
sity of groups seen today.
Leadership within the organization followed a
different format a few decades ago.
"In 1%9. a tradition that lasted 27 years was
instituted where students elected a four-member
Council of Presidents to run student govern
ment." Kimball said.
This format would exist until 19%. giving way
to the present slate format, when William K. Shen
'98 was elected solo ASSI! president.
During the Council-era, the leaders of the
ASSU were often divided over the issue of serv
ice versus advocacy. While proponents of advoca
cy supported using the ASSU to represent stu
dent voice in decisions made by the administra
tion. proponents of service felt that the group
should simply provide resources to students,
according to the ASSU Web site.
The evolution of the ASSI J since the 11/7(Kl l /7(K has
led to the implementation of both styles of lead
ership in order to improve the organization's
effectiveness.
The Last 15 Years
Changes may have been made to the internal
organizational structure of the ASSU. but student
sentiment about the ASSU has not changed much
in the past 15 years. Every April before ASSU
elections, the candidates seeking office change,
but the complaints do not.
Students typically gripe that the ASSU is not
responsive to the needs of the student body and
suffers from organizational issues that render it
slow ;ind unproductive.
"Until people started to write campaign peti
tions, I had never really heard of any major
actions taken by the ASSU, and I don't think the
majority of the freshmen here know how the

ASSU proceeds or what change they have actual
ly implemented." said Lilly Sath '12. "I'd like to
see the ASSIi become a more transparent organ
ization and an active part of Stanford undergrad
uate life."
On Feb. 12.1998. Emily Andrus '98, then-pres
ident of the ASSU. acknowledged in an address
that Stanford students wanted the ASSU to spend
more time working toward its goals and less time
bickering over politics. In previous years, dis
agreements between the Executive and Senate
divisions of the ASSU had gridlocked any major
progress in addressing student concerns.
Similarly, in 2001. it appeared that the ASSU
was as familiar as ever with policy stalls and wran
gling over proposed bills.The ASSU did not make
front page headlines in The Daily for the entire
month of February, and even when it did in subse
quent months, it was only because of minor bills
that affected the special fees request process for
student groups, or election rules that did little to
inspire student interest.
Consequently, in the 2(H)1 ASSU elections, all
candidates agreed that the ASSU was largely
absent from everyday life and needed to be more
sensitive to issues that were important to students.
Candidates Brad Wolfe *02 and Ganesh Shankar
'02 drew attention to the isolation and fragmenta
tion of campus life, and remarked that the ASSU
needed to be more active in bringing various
types of student groups and communities togeth
er on campus.
The ASSU has since been responsive,some say.
"In recent memory, the ASSU had been, at
least in my opinion, primarily a student stx'ial life
organization, throwing events like Mausoleum
Party and Block Party, and providing the ASSU
Airport Shuttle." de la Torre said.
Other candidates demanded that the ASSU
open up and reach out to more students, and
increase awareness of administrative policy and
progress on campus.
Another major change has been the addition
of the Ciraduate Student Council. According to
Director of Student Activities Nanci I lowe. prior
to this split there was one Senate comprised of
both graduate and undergraduate students.
"Ciraduate students initiated the change to
two separate deliberative bodies so that they
could focus more directly on issues of importance
to graduate students." I lowe said. Since its incep
tion. the Ciraduate Student Council has been a
strong and active body, working to promote grad
uate issues and programs on campus.
Today, the ASSU is attempting to address
these concerns that seem to have been embedded
in its history. Current ASSU members cite Jonny
Dorsey *09 and l agan Harris '09. the previous
ASSI J president and vice president, as instrumen
tal to this shift
"Jonny Dorsey and l agan Harris focused on
issues like campus health, sustainability. diversity
and advocacy among other things," Gobaud said.
Gobaud mentioned examples like the ASSU
shuttle, which helps students get to the airport for
winter break as evidence of Dorsey and Harris'
success in broadening the scope of the ASSU.
I larris expressed hope that these changes will
change the face of the ASSU in the future.
"It's the perception of the ASSU as ineffectu
al that led Jonny [Dorsey) and I to run for office."
he said. "I think gradually, these perceptions that
the ASSU does nothing' can be overcome, pro
vided that administrations of the future work to
dispel them."

The ASSU was organized on Oct. 20.1891. and
all registered students were members.
"The ASSU works to represent the interests,
needs and perspectives of Stanford students." said
Maggie Kimball, the University historian.
Ihe early committees of the ASSU included
Constitution and Bylaws, School Colors.
University Yell. Cooperative Association. Bulletin
Board and College Paper.
According to Kimball, the Constitution was
substantially rewritten in 1893-1894 for greater
accountability, which was initially lacking. In fact,
it is a relatively unknown fact that the color "car
dinal" was chosen by the ASSU.
"[The color selection) was kind of important
because they were originally kx)king at white and
gold," Kimball said. "It was the ASSU that made
official the precise shade of cardinal red from
among many swatches in 1893."
One of the most important responsibilities of
the original ASSU. according to its Web site, was
managing athletic teams and events.
"After all the Directors Cup we've won. I'm
sure the original ASSU would be proud." de la
Torre said.
Ihe group was in charge of hiring coaches,
managing the teams and handling gate receipts.
They used the income from the yearly Big Game,
for example, to help fund other teams and activi
ties for the entire year.
A Feb. 15. PXX) expense report from The Daily
Palo Alto describes how the ASSU spent its
money. In Dec. 1899, for example, the ASSU
spent $10,627.38 on things like the Ihanksgiving
show, tennis net repairs and band expenses using
profits from foot ball, tennis and basketball events.
However, the early ASSU was constantly on
the verge of bankruptcy. According to the ASSU
Web site, financial difficulties hindered the organ
ization from having notable effects on the
University. As a result, its responsibilities shifted.
In 1917. the Board of Athletic Control, a de facto
athletics department, was established, alleviating
ASSU of the burden of athletic events.
World War II and Beyond
"While the present war has put a more serious
emphasis on our work, it has also made us more
unified and spirited." said Ed Stamm '43, MBA
•47. then-president of the ASSU, in the Sept. 28.
1942 issue of The Daily. "Many campus activities
are planned for the next year, and we are all look
ing forward to a fine school year."
Indeed, this trend of progressivism continued
as America's entrv into World War II changed the
face of Stanford in the 19405. Female leaders

arose and took the charge as the population of
males on campus decreased. Janet McClanahan
'44, for example, became the ASSU's first female
president.
In fact. Peter Bing'ss was elected President of
the ASSU in 1954 and his Vice President was
Dianne Goldman '55 — now Senator Dianne
Feinstein of California.
Moreover, as the war ended, so did the domi
nance of a particular culture on campus.
Underrepresented populations, such as African
Americans, became more visible on campus as
the country became deeply divided on the issue of
racial equality. Many highly publicized acts of civil
disobedience occurred during the late 's()s and
early Wis on campus.
"The ASSU's responsiveness to such changes
can be seen through its willingness to correct past
wrongs, as it did when it overturned its earlier
decision to use an Indian caricature as the
school's mascot." the ASSU Web site states.
The organization also got more international
as a result of American involvement in foreign
wars.
According to Kimball, the ASSU oversaw the
Institute of International Relations, formed in
1947 by merging the Stanford Overseas
Information Service and other international
groups on campus. The ASSU also oversaw the
Speakers Bureau and the Elections Review
Board.
"The Speakers Bureau that the ASSU over
saw has really brought in some amazing speak
ers." Kimball noted.
The '7(K and *WK
In the '70s and \S()s. the student organization
boomed because of the elevation of awareness
both on campus and across the nation.This hurst
in student organization activity initiated the diver
sity of groups seen today.
Leadership within the organization followed a
different format a few decades ago.
"In 1%9. a tradition that lasted 27 years was
instituted where students elected a four-member
Council of Presidents to run student govern
ment." Kimball said.
This format would exist until 19%. giving way
to the present slate format, when William K. Shen
'98 was elected solo ASSI! president.
During the Council-era, the leaders of the
ASSU were often divided over the issue of serv
ice versus advocacy. While proponents of advoca
cy supported using the ASSU to represent stu
dent voice in decisions made by the administra
tion. proponents of service felt that the group
should simply provide resources to students,
according to the ASSU Web site.
The evolution of the ASSI J since the 11/7(Kl l /7(K has
led to the implementation of both styles of lead
ership in order to improve the organization's
effectiveness.
The Last 15 Years
Changes may have been made to the internal
organizational structure of the ASSU. but student
sentiment about the ASSU has not changed much
in the past 15 years. Every April before ASSU
elections, the candidates seeking office change,
but the complaints do not.
Students typically gripe that the ASSU is not
responsive to the needs of the student body and
suffers from organizational issues that render it
slow ;ind unproductive.
"Until people started to write campaign peti
tions, I had never really heard of any major
actions taken by the ASSU, and I don't think the
majority of the freshmen here know how the

ASSU proceeds or what change they have actual
ly implemented." said Lilly Sath '12. "I'd like to
see the ASSIi become a more transparent organ
ization and an active part of Stanford undergrad
uate life."
On Feb. 12.1998. Emily Andrus '98, then-pres
ident of the ASSU. acknowledged in an address
that Stanford students wanted the ASSU to spend
more time working toward its goals and less time
bickering over politics. In previous years, dis
agreements between the Executive and Senate
divisions of the ASSU had gridlocked any major
progress in addressing student concerns.
Similarly, in 2001. it appeared that the ASSU
was as familiar as ever with policy stalls and wran
gling over proposed bills.The ASSU did not make
front page headlines in The Daily for the entire
month of February, and even when it did in subse
quent months, it was only because of minor bills
that affected the special fees request process for
student groups, or election rules that did little to
inspire student interest.
Consequently, in the 2(H)1 ASSU elections, all
candidates agreed that the ASSU was largely
absent from everyday life and needed to be more
sensitive to issues that were important to students.
Candidates Brad Wolfe *02 and Ganesh Shankar
'02 drew attention to the isolation and fragmenta
tion of campus life, and remarked that the ASSU
needed to be more active in bringing various
types of student groups and communities togeth
er on campus.
The ASSU has since been responsive,some say.
"In recent memory, the ASSU had been, at
least in my opinion, primarily a student stx'ial life
organization, throwing events like Mausoleum
Party and Block Party, and providing the ASSU
Airport Shuttle." de la Torre said.
Other candidates demanded that the ASSU
open up and reach out to more students, and
increase awareness of administrative policy and
progress on campus.
Another major change has been the addition
of the Ciraduate Student Council. According to
Director of Student Activities Nanci I lowe. prior
to this split there was one Senate comprised of
both graduate and undergraduate students.
"Ciraduate students initiated the change to
two separate deliberative bodies so that they
could focus more directly on issues of importance
to graduate students." I lowe said. Since its incep
tion. the Ciraduate Student Council has been a
strong and active body, working to promote grad
uate issues and programs on campus.
Today, the ASSU is attempting to address
these concerns that seem to have been embedded
in its history. Current ASSU members cite Jonny
Dorsey *09 and l agan Harris '09. the previous
ASSI J president and vice president, as instrumen
tal to this shift
"Jonny Dorsey and l agan Harris focused on
issues like campus health, sustainability. diversity
and advocacy among other things," Gobaud said.
Gobaud mentioned examples like the ASSU
shuttle, which helps students get to the airport for
winter break as evidence of Dorsey and Harris'
success in broadening the scope of the ASSU.
I larris expressed hope that these changes will
change the face of the ASSU in the future.
"It's the perception of the ASSU as ineffectu
al that led Jonny [Dorsey) and I to run for office."
he said. "I think gradually, these perceptions that
the ASSU does nothing' can be overcome, pro
vided that administrations of the future work to
dispel them."

Students line up at the post office to cast their ballots on the last day of ASSU elections
over 30 years ago. The ASSU has since redirected its focus to address broader cam
pus issues.

The Associated Students of Stanford
University (ASSU) elections are over,
and the freshly elected candidates
must now perform their duties. David
Gobaud '08. M.S. '10 and Jay de la
Torre '10 are transitioning into their roles as
ASSU Executives, just as the organization is
channeling its efforts into a wider range of topics.
"['Hie ASSU has changed] from an organiza
tion that has focused primarily on student [and]
campus life issues, and has expanded its scope and
influence to tackle broader campus and commu
nity issues," said Vice Provost Greg Boardman.
The elected individuals are part of an histori
cal association, and the history of ASSU. while rel
atively unknown, is rich and full of interesting fac
toids about Stanford life.
