# Set on Stanford, big tuition and all
## ProFros already thinking about classes, majors after Admit Weekend 
### AMY HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
It's decision time for the Class of
2013. Stanford rolled out the cardi
nal carpet for the Class of 2013 dur
ing Admit Weekend 2(X)9. hut until
their May 1 commitment deadline,
the decision is in the ProFros' hands.
With the failing economy on every
one's minds, the administration made a
concerted effort to underscore its com
mitment to financial aid for families dur
ing Admit Weekend, hut for many
ProFros. the economy, while an underly
ing concern, was not the primary hasis
for their college decisions.

Scott Thao, a
Pro Fro from Fresno,
CA has decided
unequivocally on
accepting Stanford.
Ihe economy was lit
tle more than a foot
note for Thao, who
was happy with the
financial aid package
Stanford provided.
His decision was
based on Stanford's
unique atmosphere.
" Hie people are
amazing and there's
so much to do!" he
said. "You have
every small little
niche, and there are

tons of people who
share the same interests."
Thao was attracted to Stanford for its
wide range of academic opportunities,
and the academic expos reaffirmed his
commitment to explore all that Stanford
has to offer.
"Academically, 1 kind of wanted to
play around a little bit. I'm almost 1 <X)
percent sure that I want to dorm in
SLE." he said.
Thao does admit, however, that his
parents are pressuring him to pursue a
financially-viable career path, but that's
not stopping him from following his pas
sions.
"I don't know what I want to major in
yet. but I'm being obligated by my par
ents to choose a major that's amazing,
because an annual income is apparently
all that matters to them, but not really to
me," he explained. "Happiness is one
thing as well, and it's a major contribu
tion. I don't know what I want to major
in yet, but I'm almost sure that I want to
double minor in visual arts and creative
writing, which are two of my passions."
I.ike Thao, Kapil Yedidi. a Pro Fro
from the Sacramento area, said that
financially, Stanford's price tag is a con
cern. but not a major problem.
"It's kind of a struggle. 1 guess, hut the
financial aid definitely helps." Yedidi
said.
But the economy was not on the fore
front of Yedidi's mind during Admit
Weekend. Prior to Admit Weekend.
Yedidi's academic trajectory was fairly
well defined. I le was initially drawn to
Stanford for its computer science pro
gram. but after touring the academic
expos, he saw his horizons expanding.
"I was thinking a lot about doing
computer science before I came here, but
over the academic expos, I saw STS
[Science, Technology, and Society], which
has a lot more of what I want, which is
liberal arts. I'm thinking about that."
Yedidi. too. is feeling the heat from his
parents.
"My parents want me to do some
thing that makes decent money. I guess,
like engineering, or computer science,"
he said. "But because I'm interested in
those things to begin with, they've never
pressured me to become a doctor.
"They would probably not want me
to do something like Spanish or some
thing." he conceded.
Schu Yi Zhou, a 2013 admit from
Boston. MA based her decision to come
to Stanford primarily on academics.
"I decided more on academics. I must
say." she said. "Before I was deciding
between a few schools, and I just don't
think the focus on undergraduate educa
tion is comparable to that of Stanford. So
I really appreciate that and everything
that I 'm going to go through. I really look
forward to it."
Admit Weekend provided Zhou with
the opportunity to indulge her many aca
demic interests, and like many of her fel
low ProFros. the academic expos were a
place of realization for her.
"I found out here that I'm a complete
fuzzy and I want to do classics and philos
ophy." she said. "I don't know if I'm
going to change mv mind, maybe I will.

hut it's something that I definitely want
to fall back on."
Zhou felt that all the emphasis on
financial success she received from her
family was less a testament to the finan
cial crisis than to the culture in which she
grew up.
"I don't think it's as much about the
economy as it is about culture," she said.
"I definitely think that my parents do
want me to become successful and do
measure parts of success in money, but
they say that I should make enough to
take care of myself and if I have some left
over, that 1 should take care of them,
too."
"Now that I'm leaving for college, I'm

actually putting this into perspective and
I guess, if I could. I would love to take
care of them, because they've really
made so many sacrifices for me," she
added.
While the economy failed to distract
students from the smorgasbord of cultur
al. academic and student expos and
workshops, administrators did then best
to underscore Stanford's commitment to
its financial aid programs.
Karen Cooper, director of financial
Aid, fielded questions regarding financial
aid from parents and students during
Admit Weekend, and noted that
Stanford's aid package is definitely a
determining factor in many students'
decisions this year.
"The one thing that has felt different
this year is for me to emphasize the fact
that the undergraduate financial aid pro
gram is one of the core values of the
University and we've actually increased
the budget despite budget cuts in other
areas," she said in an interview with ITie
Daily.
In terms of scholarship funds. $102
million was earmarked for the 2(X)X-09
budget.and $110 million is slated for next
year's Financial Aid program.
"And if it turns out that we need more
than that because family needs were
greater than anticipated, then we will do
our best to find resources to meet those
additional needs." ( ooper said.
Stanford's generous financial aid has
cushioned many from the shock of the
economic crisis, but for some families, it
still isn't enough.
"I met a few students who were strug
gling over Stanford versus their state
school because of the lower cost of
attending the other school," Dean of
Freshman Julie Fythcott Maims '89
wrote in an email to The Daily." I also ran
into a few parents who said their Pro Fro
needed to convince them to pay for
Stanford, but I hear this sort of thing
every year and didn't observe a marked
increase in such attitudes this year."
Shawn Abbott, director of Admission,
agreed, conceding that the economy will
undoubtedly have some impact.
"Many of our financial aid officers
remarked that the families they met with
this year were incredibly appreciative of
the packages they have received — more
so than in previous years." he wrote in an
email to 'lhe Daily. "Of course, there are
plenty of families appealing their pack
ages. but in general, families have been
appreciative of what we have been able
to offer thus far."
However. Abbott admitted that
despite the aid. Stanford is not cheap.
"There is no question that the price
tag of a Stanford education will involve
some level of sacrifice for any family."
Still. ProFros like Brandon Skcrda
from Denver. C(). are willing to bear the
cost, viewing Stanford's opportunities as
unparalleled.
"When Stanford offers all of these
ama/ing opportunities, it's just hard to
turn down." he said.

ISAAC GATENO/The Stanford Daily
Eager ProFros check in for Admit Weekend last Thursday.
Many were set on attending Stanford, despite a number of
financial troubles stemming from the recession.
It's decision time for the Class of
2013. Stanford rolled out the cardi
nal carpet for the Class of 2013 dur
ing Admit Weekend 2(X)9. hut until
their May 1 commitment deadline,
the decision is in the ProFros' hands.
With the failing economy on every
one's minds, the administration made a
concerted effort to underscore its com
mitment to financial aid for families dur
ing Admit Weekend, hut for many
ProFros. the economy, while an underly
ing concern, was not the primary hasis
for their college decisions.

Scott Thao, a
Pro Fro from Fresno,
CA has decided
unequivocally on
accepting Stanford.
Ihe economy was lit
tle more than a foot
note for Thao, who
was happy with the
financial aid package
Stanford provided.
His decision was
based on Stanford's
unique atmosphere.
" Hie people are
amazing and there's
so much to do!" he
said. "You have
every small little
niche, and there are

tons of people who
share the same interests."
Thao was attracted to Stanford for its
wide range of academic opportunities,
and the academic expos reaffirmed his
commitment to explore all that Stanford
has to offer.
"Academically, 1 kind of wanted to
play around a little bit. I'm almost 1 <X)
percent sure that I want to dorm in
SLE." he said.
Thao does admit, however, that his
parents are pressuring him to pursue a
financially-viable career path, but that's
not stopping him from following his pas
sions.
"I don't know what I want to major in
yet. but I'm being obligated by my par
ents to choose a major that's amazing,
because an annual income is apparently
all that matters to them, but not really to
me," he explained. "Happiness is one
thing as well, and it's a major contribu
tion. I don't know what I want to major
in yet, but I'm almost sure that I want to
double minor in visual arts and creative
writing, which are two of my passions."
I.ike Thao, Kapil Yedidi. a Pro Fro
from the Sacramento area, said that
financially, Stanford's price tag is a con
cern. but not a major problem.
"It's kind of a struggle. 1 guess, hut the
financial aid definitely helps." Yedidi
said.
But the economy was not on the fore
front of Yedidi's mind during Admit
Weekend. Prior to Admit Weekend.
Yedidi's academic trajectory was fairly
well defined. I le was initially drawn to
Stanford for its computer science pro
gram. but after touring the academic
expos, he saw his horizons expanding.
"I was thinking a lot about doing
computer science before I came here, but
over the academic expos, I saw STS
[Science, Technology, and Society], which
has a lot more of what I want, which is
liberal arts. I'm thinking about that."
Yedidi. too. is feeling the heat from his
parents.
"My parents want me to do some
thing that makes decent money. I guess,
like engineering, or computer science,"
he said. "But because I'm interested in
those things to begin with, they've never
pressured me to become a doctor.
"They would probably not want me
to do something like Spanish or some
thing." he conceded.
Schu Yi Zhou, a 2013 admit from
Boston. MA based her decision to come
to Stanford primarily on academics.
"I decided more on academics. I must
say." she said. "Before I was deciding
between a few schools, and I just don't
think the focus on undergraduate educa
tion is comparable to that of Stanford. So
I really appreciate that and everything
that I 'm going to go through. I really look
forward to it."
Admit Weekend provided Zhou with
the opportunity to indulge her many aca
demic interests, and like many of her fel
low ProFros. the academic expos were a
place of realization for her.
"I found out here that I'm a complete
fuzzy and I want to do classics and philos
ophy." she said. "I don't know if I'm
going to change mv mind, maybe I will.

hut it's something that I definitely want
to fall back on."
Zhou felt that all the emphasis on
financial success she received from her
family was less a testament to the finan
cial crisis than to the culture in which she
grew up.
"I don't think it's as much about the
economy as it is about culture," she said.
"I definitely think that my parents do
want me to become successful and do
measure parts of success in money, but
they say that I should make enough to
take care of myself and if I have some left
over, that 1 should take care of them,
too."
"Now that I'm leaving for college, I'm

actually putting this into perspective and
I guess, if I could. I would love to take
care of them, because they've really
made so many sacrifices for me," she
added.
While the economy failed to distract
students from the smorgasbord of cultur
al. academic and student expos and
workshops, administrators did then best
to underscore Stanford's commitment to
its financial aid programs.
Karen Cooper, director of financial
Aid, fielded questions regarding financial
aid from parents and students during
Admit Weekend, and noted that
Stanford's aid package is definitely a
determining factor in many students'
decisions this year.
"The one thing that has felt different
this year is for me to emphasize the fact
that the undergraduate financial aid pro
gram is one of the core values of the
University and we've actually increased
the budget despite budget cuts in other
areas," she said in an interview with ITie
Daily.
In terms of scholarship funds. $102
million was earmarked for the 2(X)X-09
budget.and $110 million is slated for next
year's Financial Aid program.
"And if it turns out that we need more
than that because family needs were
greater than anticipated, then we will do
our best to find resources to meet those
additional needs." ( ooper said.
Stanford's generous financial aid has
cushioned many from the shock of the
economic crisis, but for some families, it
still isn't enough.
"I met a few students who were strug
gling over Stanford versus their state
school because of the lower cost of
attending the other school," Dean of
Freshman Julie Fythcott Maims '89
wrote in an email to The Daily." I also ran
into a few parents who said their Pro Fro
needed to convince them to pay for
Stanford, but I hear this sort of thing
every year and didn't observe a marked
increase in such attitudes this year."
Shawn Abbott, director of Admission,
agreed, conceding that the economy will
undoubtedly have some impact.
"Many of our financial aid officers
remarked that the families they met with
this year were incredibly appreciative of
the packages they have received — more
so than in previous years." he wrote in an
email to 'lhe Daily. "Of course, there are
plenty of families appealing their pack
ages. but in general, families have been
appreciative of what we have been able
to offer thus far."
However. Abbott admitted that
despite the aid. Stanford is not cheap.
"There is no question that the price
tag of a Stanford education will involve
some level of sacrifice for any family."
Still. ProFros like Brandon Skcrda
from Denver. C(). are willing to bear the
cost, viewing Stanford's opportunities as
unparalleled.
"When Stanford offers all of these
ama/ing opportunities, it's just hard to
turn down." he said.
