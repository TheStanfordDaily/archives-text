I lie Senate has been the scene of acrimo
nious discussions over the ASSIJ Nomina
tions ('ommission, which oversees and man
ages the placement of student representa
tives on do/ens of official University com
mit tees, including the Board of Trustees. Sen
ator Stuart Baimel and I have both been crit
ical at times of the current Nominations
('ommission. led by I ric Osborne. We feel,
however, that our comments were taken out
of context and Osborne was not given equal
time to defend his position in the pages of
I he Daily. We want toset the record straight.
Stuart and I have been strong backers of
the current NomC 'om since its inception last
year. Osborne has taken it in a new. much
more effective direction and we are pleased
to see how effective NomCom has become.
Despite being appointed behind schedule
last year. I ric and this year's NomC 'om have
filled more committee positions more quick
ly than any recent commission. I "hey also
managed to set new standards for objective
and consistent interviews during the com
mittee appointment process.
We firmly believe I ric has been an excel
lent Nominations Commission chair. Con

trary to statements attributed we are quoted
making in The Daily ("Senate approves
Wellness funding," February 11,2009), we do
not believe that I ric should be removed
from his position. Our comments lamented
the breakdown of communication between
the I Jndergraduatc Senate and Nominations
Commission, a breakdown for which our
body was in part responsible. We in no way
meant to imply that NomCom has failed to
do its job. For any distress or difficulty we
may have caused I ric or the Nominations
( ommission. we apologize.
As the new NomCom is confirmed, we
want to warn both the new Senate and the
new NomCom that communication is ex
tremely important, and a two-way street. An
effective NomCom-Senate relationship is
important for effective student representa
tion on I Jniversity committees.This is partic
ularly crucial in a time of budget cuts, when
students need a voice on governing and advi
sory boards making important decisions
about large budget cuts.
