# Too Big to Fail
## Crash and burn 
### 
I took Five Hour Energy for the first time
this past spring break. Having simultane
ously committed myself to a week-long
alumni networking program and a week-
King series of performances with the Robber
Barons, I was running on fewer than four
hours of sleep a night as I shuttled between
interviews, rehearsals and social gatherings.
As the week wore on. I could feel myself
devolving into a subject in a "Sleep and
Dreams" experiment gone awry. Everything
1 was doing required my full energy and
focus, and my body just wasn't having it.
A frantic CVS visit later. I was chugging
out ol my very own non-FDA.-certified red
plastic vial. Insofar as I was still lucid. I was
worried about what Five 1 four Energy might
to do me — Seizure? Coma? Mutant third
eye? — but I reasoned it couldn't be more
unpleasant than my current state.
More importantly. I'd seen Five Hour all
around Stanford's campus and figured any
thing I could buy at the CoIIo couldn't kill
me.
It's not news that college students are con
stantly looking for ways to need less sleep.
The freakishly driven co-ed who pops illicitly
acquired Adderall or Provigil like candy in
order to be endlessly energetic and produc
tive is a stock character for sites like College-
Humor.com. as recognizable a character as
the drunk freshman and the idiot jock (I did
n't say we were talking about Stanford here).
And while our community can't be entire
ly immune to this phenomenon — "No real
ly. I have ADHD. I swear" — I get the sense
that most of us at least understand ingesting
a pill prescribed to someone else to be a
somewhat questionable act. for reasons both
ethical and. perhaps even more significantly,
physiological.
At Stanford, we're all about healthy liv
ing. We go the gym. We meditate. We clamor
for locally grown produce, gluten-free pita
chips, organic cupcakes and so on. Why, then,
does this same group of people — many of
whom would never dream of taking Adderall
drink energy drinks like water?
Earlier this year. I interviewed Ken Row
ers. the general manager of the Stanford
Bookstore and TressFx. At the time, I was

going to write a column about the push to
wards a "smoke-free Stanford." and I was cu
rious to hear his opinion about selling prod
ucts to students that endanger their health.
He explained that the stores only sell goods
for which there is a demonstrated demand.
Such is certainly the case with energy
drinks. Employees I spoke with at the CoHo
and TressEx confirmed that Five Hour E:.ner
gv sells like hotcakes (whatever hotcakes ac
tually are).
Even more popular, however, are "vita
min-rich" energy drinks like Revolution Tea
and I RS I lealthy Energy, that not only echo
Five I lour's promise of "healthy energy" but
assure greater overall wellbeing in addition.
We're not drinking Rockstar — it's loaded
with sugar — and Redbull is only acceptable
if vodka is involved (in which case there's no
pretense of being healthy anyway, so it's
fine). Anything natural.on the other hand, is
awesome.
Except not. By marketing themselves as
"natural dietary supplements." Five Hour
and its ifk position themselves in a market
that is entirely unregulated. By delivering
their product in the form of a drink, they
make it seem both innocuous and appealing.
So long as their marketing people don't out
right lie. they can imply anything they want.
None of the Web sites I looked at besides
Five Hour disclosed full lists of their prod
ucts' ingredients. Revolution Tea's Web site
describes its product only as "all natural."
and then prov ides links to articles suggesting
that drinking tea reduces your chances of de
veloping cancer.
The weirdest thing about looking at all
these sites, however (and yes, it is funny that
all these drinks have their own Web sites),
was how perfectly they targeted me. As an
educated, empowered woman. 1 can scoff my
way through Cosmo or Vogue without feel
ing the need to buy a new purse or lose 20
pounds. But give me a tasteful, muted page
layout and a video of trendy yet sensitive
multi-ethnic friends lying in the grass, enjoy
ing their healthy energy drinks as all these
sites do and I am sold.

drinks, "healthy" or not, from Stanford's

start seeing these drinks for what thc\ are:
brilliant marketing ploys with unclear side
effects. I took Five Hour once, and it was
weird. I'm fine, hut I won't ever do it again,
and you shouldn't either. ( This sounds
strangely reminiscent of a talk my parents
once had with me about pot.)
Nor do I mean to directly equate Five

clear exactly how either product works (to

produces a calming effect is not known"), but
Adderall is prescript ion-only, so that must
