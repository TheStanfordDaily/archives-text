Different year, same result.
One season after placing sixth at the Pacific-1 () Champi
onships in Palos Verdes, Calif, the women's golf team had an iden
tical finish at home, as it was not able to overcome powerhouses
such as Arizona State and Southern California.
Hosting the conference championship for the first time since
1999 and facing some of the toughest competition in the nation,
the No. 25 Cardinal started slow, shooting a collective 302 on Fri
day. but rebounded with back-to-back 294s on the second and
third days.
Stanford momentarily moved into fifth place after Saturday,
but California's surprising 2<S4 in the final round helped the Gold
en Bears overtake the Cardinal. Still. Stanford finished just six
shots behind fourth-place Arizona, and was able to place a nine
shot difference between itself and seventh-place Oregon.
That said, the top three teams — ASIJ, USC and UCLA —
finished far ahead of the competition.The Wildcats' final 32 over
par was a whole 20 shots behind the Bruins' 12 over.The Sun Dev
ils. the conference champions, finished at even par. nine shots
ahead of second-place USC.
Even with its slow start, the Cardinal was still in contention
after the first round, wrapping up Friday 11 shots behind first
place UCLA—a significant deficit, but not insurmountable.
However, Arizona State shot 2-S1 and 27K over the weekend to
eliminate any chance the Cardinal — or. for that matter, any
other team — had of winning the tournament. The Sun Devils
had three of their five golfers finish under par. including Jennifer
Osborn and Carlota Ciganda. who shared first-place honors at
three under with USC's Jennifer Song.
"I'm sure that everyone on the team felt that they could have
played better each day of the tournament." said Cardinal senior
Angela King. '"We definitely left some strokes out there, but we
held it together.Sure.it could have been much better, but it could
have been worse, too. We had rough starts each day and managed
to pull together and finish strong at the end of each day."
Stanford was led by sophomore Rebecca Durham, who fin
ished at seven over and in a tie for 16th place. Freshman Lila Bar
ton was not far behind, ending in a tie for 20th and shooting +10
overall.
"Rebecca and Lila came in with three consistent,solid rounds,
which always goes a long way in helping a team finish well." King
said.
The Cardinal was rounded out by senior Mari Chun ( + 12).
King (+l4) and freshman Sydney Burlison (+22). Burlison im
proved her play every day,as did Barton and Durham. Chun start
ed strong, finishing Friday'. first round in seventh place.but had a
rough outing on Sunday, shooting I Dover par.
"I think everybody played an important role in the team's fin
ish at Pac-lOs." King said. "Everybody contributed to our final
score. Mari played exceptionally well the first two days of the
tournament, which I think was really important in keeping us in
contention."
Stanford will now head to Ohio to compete in the NCAA Cen
tral Regional, one of four such tournaments that lead to the gen
eral NCAA Championships. The top eight schools from each re
gional advance, and the Cardinal will look to move further than
last season, when it lost in a heartbreaking playoff for the eighth
and final spot from the West Regional.
The Cardinal will face some familiar foes in ( olumbus.such as
now-No. 2 UCLA.The women will also have to compete with No.
4 Oklahoma State and other formidable squads, such as Purdue.

Stanford will enter the regional ranked ninth out of the 21 teams
in the Central — which, if such positioning holds, would have the
C ardinal headed home, instead of on to the NCAA Champi
onships in Maryland. King, however, disregarded the pre-tourna
ment seeding.
"Rankings are not always completely accurate and not telling
about how certain teams are going to perform." she said. "Golf is
such an unpredictable sport and sometimes all it takes is one play
er, or one hole to make the difference."
That noted. King recognized the arduous task ahead.
"I feel that the competition in every region is going to be very
difficult." she said. "The Central Region has several talented
teams, and we're right up there with the rest of them. It's going to
be a challenging tournament, but our team is definitely up to the
challenge."
Stanford will send the same five-person team that competed at
Pac-KK to play in ()hio. 'lhey will begin competition on May 7 and
play through May ( >.
