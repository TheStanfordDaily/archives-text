GAME NOTES; The Cardinal will host the National Synchronized Swim
ming Championships this weekend, which will take place at Avery
Aquatic center on Friday and Saturday. The women, who finished
second to Ohio State in the Collegiate Nationals last month, will now
take on the best collegiate and non-collegiate teams in the nation.
The Cardinal will try to defend its title from last year, when the women
split the championship with the Santa Clara Aquamaids.

Stanford will host the U.S. National Synchronized
Swimming Championships at Avery Aquatic Center this
weekend.
The Cardinal, which finished its regular season unde
feated. but lost to Ohio State at the U.S. Collegiate Na
tionals last month, will look to repeat last season's suc
cess. when the team split the U.S. team championship
with the Santa Clara Aquamaids.
The Aquamaids.a club team that is not affiliated with
Santa Clara University, will be Stanford's toughest com
petition this weekend, along with the Buckeyes. Before
last season, the Aquamaids had won 16 straight titles.
Despite finishing second to Ohio State last month,
the Cardinal swimmers feel that meet was one of its best
this year.
"1 think our biggest accomplishment so far is the way
we performed at NC 'AAs last month," said junior Taylor
Durand. "livery time we dove into the pool, our swims
were personal bests. We were really well-prepared, men
tally and physically, for that meet."
With that in mind.Stanford swimmers recognized the
level of competition they will face this weekend, but are
nevertheless confident that the team can succeed.
"As a team, we're ready for anything," said freshman
Morgan Fuller. "We've practiced under so many differ
ent conditions that we're prepared for any curveballs
that come our way. Our team has an advantage in that
we're used to being in our home pool. We've done it a
million times, so it will just be another meet for us."
ITie Championships will be split into team, duo and
solo events. As a result, although only IS squads will
compete, a total of 24 clubs will he
represented.
The team competition will consist
jf free and technical routines. The
free team program is a choreo
graphed set of moves, like lifts, that
are normally seen at meets.The tech
nical event requires all swimmers to
do the exact same thing at the same
time, with the exception of the
cadence element.
Stanford's squad will be largely
the same for the two variations.
Senior Erin Bell; juniors Debbie
Chen and Durand; sophomores
Michelle Moore and Corinne Smith;
and freshmen Maria Koroleva,
Olivia Morgan and Fuller will be the
free team. That lineup will remain
intact for the technical program,
except for one difference — fresh
man Alex Bollaidlaw will take
Fuller's place.
The Cardinal will have two duet
teams in Koroleva and Morgan, and
Chen and Durand. Morgan will also
compete in the lone solo event.
"I think our team's biggest fear
would be regret." Chen said. "We
want to go and put everything out
there. I expect that our team will be
focused on what we need to do for
each swim. If we just take it one step
at a time and add a bit of competition
adrenaline, we can hopefully have
our best swims of the season."
Since the completion of the

Collegiate Nationals, the team has
been focused on fine-tuning its tech
niques to ensure higher overall
scores.
"We've been working really hard
these past couple weeks to prepare for
nationals," Fuller said. "It would be
really nice to be able to end our season
on a good note in our home pool."
"We've worked ... to perfect four

new technical routines and push our
selves to an even higher level for U.S.
Nationals," Durand said.
Although Stanford hopes that it
can claim its second straight team
title — as well as repeat as champi
ons in the solo and duet events — the
Cardinal is nevertheless proud of the
strides it has made this season.
"It has been a year of bonding

from within, and as a senior. I can say
this year has been one of the most
special for me," Bell said. "All 1 want
is to enjoy this competition and leave
knowing we did our best, no matter
what the outcome ultimately is."
