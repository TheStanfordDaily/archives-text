# NHL has playoff excitement
## 
### 
This column lias been three
weeks in the making. I tried to
resist writing it. I really did.
Alas. 1 failed, and here is my
NHL. Playoffs hockey column. If you
don't want to read it.it is your loss,just
as it is your loss if you haven't been
watching the Nl 11. Playoffs.
Ihese playoffs are about as enter
taining as you could imagine. Much
more so than the NBA Playoffs,or the
dog-and-pony show that is the NFL
Draft.
Take the New York Rangers-Wash
ington ( 'apitals series, for example.This
series had literally everything from
coach-fan altercations tocheapshots to
comebacks to great goaltending. and
even the best player in the world. It is
like a soap opera crossed with a Mike
Tyson fight, game in and game out.
Consider that the heavily favored
Capitals were led by the overpowering,
yet eccentric. Alex Ovechkin.
Ovechkin is a charactci on and off the
ice. I le is a pseudo-rock star who lives
every second of life to the limit, which
translates into his relentless attacking
style on the ice.
However. Ovechkin was held in
check by a bevy of blocked shots, as
well as exceptional play of (perhaps the
best goaltender in the world) Henrik
Lundqvist early in the series, as the
Rangers won the first two games in
Washington, despite being drastically
outplayed.
ITiings got weird aftei the Rangers
went up three games to one. however.
The team benched league menace
Sean Avery for taking careless penal
ties and the Caps responded with a 4-0
drubbing of the visiting Rangers. The
game itself was only a sideshow to the
altercation between Rangers coach
John Tortorella and Caps fans seated
behind the Rangers' bench.
Tortorella was seen spraying water
on the fans, allegedly in response to re
peated homophobic remarks made to
ward Rangers players. You can't make
these this stuff up.Tortorella was subse
quently suspended for game six.
As if that wasn't enough drama for
one series. Caps thug I )onald Brashear
sent a late elbow to the head of Rangers
center Blair Belts, breaking his orbital
bone and earning Brashear a six-game
suspension.
Then there is the biggest bite con
troversy since Tyson-I lolyfield. Ac
cording to Ranger Brandon Dubinsky,
Caps defender Shaone Morrisonn bit
him during a scrum on Sunday. Mor
risonn denied the claim.
Although the underdog Rangers
were unable to pull off the upset, sur
rendering the 3-1 series lead.the series
was still one for the ages — and you
probably missed it.
The Caps-Rangers series wasn't the
only gem — there was also the battle
for Pennsylvania between the Philadel
phia Myers and the Pittsburgh Pen
guins.
There also was (if you are a Sharks
fan.you might want to skip ahead to the
following paragraph) an upset by an
eight-seed over a one-seed, as the
Nl II .'s best team in the regular season,
the San Jose Sharks,again tell victim to
the playoff blues, losing to the Anaheim
I )ucks.
There was also another game seven
yesterday, as the Carolina Hurricanes
stormed back with two late goals to
beat the New Jersey Devils.
Not only have these playoffs been
absolutely riveting, but there are some
undercurrents that make them even
more fun to watch.
Take playoff beards for example.
Looking at Ranger Paul Mara, you
would think he just spent six years by
himself in the backwoods of Montana.
In fact.he.like other players.stops shav
ing come playoff time as a superstition.
ITiese actions, trivial as they may
seem, are representative of the ab
solute dedication shown by Nl ll.play
ers in each and every playoff game.The
passion on the ice is tangible through
the television screen. It's something
you don't see in the NBA Playoffs (ex
cept maybe in the Bulls-Celtics series,
but they are simply playing for a right
to lose to the Cavaliers down the
road).
So go find a way to tune to it. Go to
a sports bar. or upgrade your cable
package, because you are missing
some really special stuff.
