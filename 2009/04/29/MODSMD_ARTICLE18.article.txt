# RESIDENTIAL LIFE
## ResEd adds two new focus house options 
### AMY HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
Students hoping to live in a focus
house have two new options this
year — Branner and Adelfa will
both take on new focuses as part of
the changes to the Housing Master
Plan.
Starting in the fall, Branner will
have a public service focus and
Adelfa will have a writing focus.The
two will add to the existing comple
ment of the Comparative Studies in
Race and Ethnicity (CSRE) focus
at Murray, and arts and performing
arts focus at Kimball, sophomore
focus at Toyon. and the
Freshman/Sophomore Residential
College.
Focus houses, as opposed to
cross-cultural theme houses and
academic and language theme hous
es. have special house programs that
relate to their focus. Student focus
assistants live in the houses to facil
itate relevant discussions and plan
and support programming.
On the student end. demand for
a public service focus is high, with
just over 90 students applying for 30
pre-assigned spots to Branner's pre
assignment.
Both Resident Fellows (RFs)
and students are excited about the
academic and social prospects of
these focus dorms.
Nancy Buffington. the RF at
Branner. came up with the idea for
Branner's public service emphasis
during a meeting last fall, when she
was informed of the upcoming
changes in the dorms.
"I thought about Branner's need
for a new identity when it goes
upper-class, and about the loss of
focus houses like Arroyo, since it's
going all-frosh." she said. "Literally.
I went from thinking, "maybe we
could create a focus house" to
"what kind of students would I want
to live with?" to "service!" in about
a minute."
Buffington coordinates with the
Program in Writing and Rhetoric's
(PWR) Community Writing Project
with her husband and co-RF Clyde
Moneyhun and has a strong back
ground in family literacy, so she
argued that service was a natural
choice for the pair.

"When Clyde and I talked things
through," Buffington said, "we real
ized that a focus might help achieve
a few things that are important to
us: give students more compelling
reasons to live in Branner than just
living in an admittedly beautiful
house, foster a lively dorm commu
nity instead of the stereotypical
upper-class dorm 'where fun goes to
die.' and give students' impressive
service work at Stanford a new
dimension of support."
As a PWR instructor, writing was
a subject close to West Lag
Resident Fellow Marvin Diogenes'
heart, and when he learned that
Adelfa would become an upper
class house he jumped at the oppor
tunity to institute a writing focus.
Diogenes drafted a proposal that
was given the go-ahead by Deborah
Golder. Director of Residential
Education, and in April, forms were
released to apply to pre-assignment
into Adelfa.
Diogenes feels Adelfa's writing
programs will foster intra-dorm dis
cussion and provide invaluable writ
ing support to residents.
"I'm hoping that the writing pro
gram will span a wide range of writ
ing-related activities." Diogenes
said. "We'll certainly have fiction,
poetry, spoken word, plays. In read
ing the pre-assignment applications.
I'm seeing that the students are
everything from journalists to play
wrights, to people who want to write
policy papers in their future careers,
so I'm hoping that the programming
in Adelfa will reflect the wide range
of interests that students have in
every type of writing that you think
of."
Judy Trieu 10. now a focus assis
tant in Murray, has been an active
member of the focus system, and
sees focus housing as both an
invaluable academic and social
opportunity. In Murray, she and
other focus assistants lead weekly
seminars on cultural and ethnic
issues, under the tutelage ot
Professor Michael Wilcox. Students
present on a topic of their choice
and then have a small discussion
with other students.
"To have a seminar where each
priority student is passionate and
excited about talking about the sub
ject encourages a deeper discussion
of the topic, whether symbolic sys
tems or CSRFi. If people aren't
really interested in a topic, the dis
cussions don't usually go anywhere,
but to have a focus where everyone
is just very interested in it. you real

lv get a lot out of the discussions."
Socially, she added, it's reward
ing as well.
"I felt that the discussions really
did bring us as a community closer
together, in terms of getting to
know each other in the dorm."
Buffington seconds Trieu's senti
ment of the bonding mechanism of
a focus dorm.
"For students who feel strongly
about a certain topic, focus houses
give them a place to live with other
students who share their interests,"
Buffington said. "This lets all kinds

of good things happen — they can
talk about what they're reading,
what they're doing in class, about
their plans for after graduation —
in a comfortable place with people
they know well. This can happen
over dinner in the dining hall, in
each other's rooms or even while
they're brushing their teeth. In gen
eral. it gives students more reasons
to meet each other, reasons to move
outside their draw group."
