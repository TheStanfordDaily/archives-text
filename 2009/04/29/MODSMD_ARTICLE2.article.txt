# Community centers face cuts
## Staff hours, student staff, programming reduced 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Due to the $3 million budget cut to the student
affairs division. Stanford's six community centers will
face new financial difficulties as they prepare for the
upcoming school year.
"As with every unit across the University, this was
an extremely difficult process, and we are not fin
ished yet with the cuts." said Associate Vice Provost
of Student Affairs Sally Dickson. "Every area within
student affairs was impacted."
ITie six community organizations which fall under
Dickson's purview are the Asian American Activities
Center, the Black Community Services Center, F.l
Centro Chicano. the LGBT Community Resources
Center, the Native American Cultural Center and
the Women's Community Center.
While each center is expected to experience pay
roll reductions, as well as decreases in their operation
and program budgets, the cuts will not be evenly dis
tributed.
"We decided not to do it across the board because

we wanted to look at every unit." Dickson said,
stressing that the individual centers pursue different
goals and therefore have different financial needs.
"The priorities that we gave [were] compliance, men
tal health, academic excellence [and] academic pro
grams. Also, for the centers, as with all of the other
units, it was trying to minimize layoffs â€” that was a
key."
For the most part, the payroll cutback will he felt
in the form of reduced work hours for professional
staff members. With the exception of the Native
American Cultural Center, each group will have two
staff members who are employed 10 months full
time during the school year and two months part
time during the summer.
"That's starting next year, not this summer."
Dickson added. "We did it that way to give people
time to adjust to that new arrangement."
At the Native American Cultural Center
(NACC). Assistant Dean and Director Winona
Simms shared a similar concern. In the upcoming

school year, the center will be forced
to limit its staff to 2.5 employees. With
a record number of 95 admits of
Native descent for the class of 2013,
Simms fears that "the Native
American Cultural Center will have
less manpower and less funding to
direct toward their retention."
"The work of our professional staff
focuses on the retention and timely
graduation of Native students"
Simms explained. "We monitor their
progress and advise them when things
seem not to be going well."
lino NACC has built up a three
person staff over the years, with one
advisor specifically dedicated to the
task of student retention. Together,
the three advisors work to smooth
students' transition to college and to
foster a close-knit community.
Ben Davidson, student affairs offi
cer for the LGBT Community
Center, explained that his center will

also feel the effects of staff cutbacks.
"It's going to be more of a chal
lenge to maintain the support that we
provide over the summer to students
who are on campus," Davidson said.
"Of course, it also poses a significant
financial burden to our professional
staff."
Cindy Ng. student affairs officer at
the Asian American Activities Center
(A A AC), added to the concerns over
the prescribed cut in staff hours.
"The reduced staff hours will
impact planning and preparation for
many of our programs, including ori
entation," Ng said. "Mentor and
mentee recruitment for our AIM
mentoring program also occurs dur
ing the summer months, so the
reduced staff time may affect recruit
ment and result in a delayed start to
the program and fewer participants."
But this decrease in staff hours
and compensation is only part of the
picture. Further contributing to the
strain on the six community centers is
a substantial reduction in overall
funding. Events put on by the com
munity centers will face a much
tighter budget.

"Both University and outside
funding is limited this year," Simms
said. "[As a result,] the Powwow
Committee is going to be extremely
stretched as they work to host this
major event."
Likewise, the Black Community
Services Center (BCSC) anticipates
that the budget cuts will curtail the
scale of its programs. For over a
decade, Jan Barker-Alexander has
served as the BCSC associate dean of
students and director.
Sharing her center's past accom
plishments, Barker-Alexander was
quick to express her pride in the
Academic and Community Awards
Program, which has existed for over
25 years and draws hundreds of
guests annually. But this year's
awards event will be scaled back
slightly, despite its stature as a long
standing tradition.
"It's a great program that we're
going to have to assess." Barker-
Alexander said. "How can we even
chip at it some more?"
The pinch of the VPS A budget
cuts will also be felt by El Centro
Chicano.

"Our signature programs such as
the Professional Development
Symposium, Posadas. El Dia de los
Muertos and Cesar Chavez
Commemoration will be scaled
down ," said Student Affairs Officer
Frances Morales.
"We're working with our staff to
identify every place that we can cut
costs without significantly impacting
any programs." added Davidson of
the LGBT Center. "One of the things
we felt very strongly about was that
we did not want to reduce our num
ber of student staff because they play
such a critical role in our programs ..
. But as a result, we have to be more
economical about how we distribute
funds across programs."
In this respect, the LGBT Center
differs from its fellow community
centers, many of which are capping
the number of student staff members.
Student Affairs Officer Laura
Harrison said that the Women's
Community Center will eliminate
two student staff positions in addition
to cutting back on its programming.
"Our programs are consistently
well-attended and I receive frequent

feedback about how a particular pro
gram gave students the tools they
needed to solve a problem that was
impeding their Stanford experience"
Harrison said. "We will obviously do
our best to minimize the impact, but
cutting the human and financial
resources to the Women's
Community Center this significantly
will clearly have an effect."
The BCSC has already been
forced to lay off a half-time adminis
trative associate and anticipates
fewer student hires next year.
"We are meeting with our student
staff and advisory board before we
finalize any cuts," Ng explained for
the AAAC. "However, we can antici
pate layoffs of student staff and ma jor
programming reductions and/or elim
ination."
As for El Centro, its "program
ming and student salary budget will
be reduced by 34 percent," Morales
said. "Thus, the center will hire fewer
students and reduce their work
hours."
"Outreach to the neighboring
schools will be reduced as a result of
fewer student staff members," she

added.
In the midst of all the budget cuts,
Dickson emphasized the carefulness
with which each was handled.
"The reduction to the centers in
no way reflects the importance that
the centers play... in the lives of
some of our students," she added.
"We understood the different mission
of each of the centers."
However, across the University,
departments and programs have
been increasingly constrained by
financial hurdles and the prospect of
more cuts in the future.
"We're in the midst of a massive,
global economic convulsion, which is
extremely challenging to educational
institutions, businesses, families and
individuals," Davidson said.
Yet. he was quick to offer a few
words of hope for the future.
"We're just going to do our best to
weather the storm, in the best way
that we can and [with] the most posi
tive outlook that we can under the
circumstances." Davidson said.
