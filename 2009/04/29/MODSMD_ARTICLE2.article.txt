## Staff hours, student staff, programming reduced 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Due to the $3 million budget cut to the student
affairs division. Stanford's six community centers will
face new financial difficulties as they prepare for the
upcoming school year.
"As with every unit across the University, this was
an extremely difficult process, and we are not fin
ished yet with the cuts." said Associate Vice Provost
of Student Affairs Sally Dickson. "Every area within
student affairs was impacted."
ITie six community organizations which fall under
Dickson's purview are the Asian American Activities
Center, the Black Community Services Center, F.l
Centro Chicano. the LGBT Community Resources
Center, the Native American Cultural Center and
the Women's Community Center.
While each center is expected to experience pay
roll reductions, as well as decreases in their operation
and program budgets, the cuts will not be evenly dis
tributed.
"We decided not to do it across the board because

we wanted to look at every unit." Dickson said,
stressing that the individual centers pursue different
goals and therefore have different financial needs.
"The priorities that we gave [were] compliance, men
tal health, academic excellence [and] academic pro
grams. Also, for the centers, as with all of the other
units, it was trying to minimize layoffs â€” that was a
key."
For the most part, the payroll cutback will he felt
in the form of reduced work hours for professional
staff members. With the exception of the Native
American Cultural Center, each group will have two
staff members who are employed 10 months full
time during the school year and two months part
time during the summer.
"That's starting next year, not this summer."
Dickson added. "We did it that way to give people
time to adjust to that new arrangement."
At the Native American Cultural Center
(NACC). Assistant Dean and Director Winona
Simms shared a similar concern. In the upcoming
