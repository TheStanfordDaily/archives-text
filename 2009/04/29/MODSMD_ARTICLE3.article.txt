## New GI Bill raises issues with aid Financial Aid Office has not yet determined program participation

A number of issues, ranging from
financial to logistical, are making it dif
ficult for veterans to receive financial
aid from Stanford and other private
universities.
Veterans who have served on active
duty since September 11. 2001 are the
subject of the Post 9-11 Veterans
Fducational Assistance Act of 2008
more commonly known as the Post
11 Cil Hill or "New GI Bill."
The New Cil hill provides payment
commensurate to the highest public in
state undergraduate tuition rate on a
term-by-term basis, and provides addi
tional allowances for books, fees and
living expenses.
The Yellow Ribbon Ci I Education
Enhancement Program, a provision of
the new bill, provides financial support
for veterans who wish to apply their
higher education funds to a private
institution. The program aims to give
additional aid when the cost of enroll
ment in the private university exceeds
that of the most expensive public
tuition rate in a given state.
Private universities may opt to enter
into an agreement with the VA to cover
up to 50 percent of the excess cost of
tuition for their veteran applicants. The
VA has agreed to match whatever the
universities offer.
Asked if Stanford had yet made the
decision to participate. Director of
Financial Aid Karen Cooper said yes.
but could not confirm details of fund
ing and distribution.
"We need to estimate how much it's
Igoing to] cost us before we can say at
what level we can participate and that's
proving to be very difficult because
things keep shifting... the fact that
there won't be a base benefit to start
with just means that we'll have to grant
