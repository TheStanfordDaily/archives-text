# FINANCIAL AID
## New GI Bill raises issues with aid Financial Aid Office has not yet determined program participation 
### AIMEE MILES 
A number of issues, ranging from
financial to logistical, are making it dif
ficult for veterans to receive financial
aid from Stanford and other private
universities.
Veterans who have served on active
duty since September 11. 2001 are the
subject of the Post 9-11 Veterans
Fducational Assistance Act of 2008
more commonly known as the Post
11 Cil Hill or "New GI Bill."
The New Cil hill provides payment
commensurate to the highest public in
state undergraduate tuition rate on a
term-by-term basis, and provides addi
tional allowances for books, fees and
living expenses.
The Yellow Ribbon Ci I Education
Enhancement Program, a provision of
the new bill, provides financial support
for veterans who wish to apply their
higher education funds to a private
institution. The program aims to give
additional aid when the cost of enroll
ment in the private university exceeds
that of the most expensive public
tuition rate in a given state.
Private universities may opt to enter
into an agreement with the VA to cover
up to 50 percent of the excess cost of
tuition for their veteran applicants. The
VA has agreed to match whatever the
universities offer.
Asked if Stanford had yet made the
decision to participate. Director of
Financial Aid Karen Cooper said yes.
but could not confirm details of fund
ing and distribution.
"We need to estimate how much it's
Igoing to] cost us before we can say at
what level we can participate and that's
proving to be very difficult because
things keep shifting... the fact that
there won't be a base benefit to start
with just means that we'll have to grant
more if we want [veterans] to have a
larger award," Cooper said.
Despite financial problems
posed by the recession. Cooper
remained confident that Stanford
would participate in the Yellow
Ribbon Program at some level.
"Would this have been easier to
do a year or two ago when the
endowment was making money
hand-over-fist?" she asked. "Sure.
That doesn't mean we won't do it
well and aren't committed to [veter
ans' financial aid]."
Stanford's admissions process is
also problematic for the Yellow
Ribbon Program's requirement to
administer aid on a first-come, first
serve basis, according to Cooper.
"Look at the way our students

are admitted — freshmen first, then
transfer students" she said. "[The
latter group) is where we are more
likely to see vets who qualify, hut
then freshmen might use (the avail
able funds] up first."
Then, there is the additional chal
lenge of coordinating between
schools.
"It's a little more complex at the
graduate level where each school
manages its own aid," Cooper said.
While the professional schools of
business, law and medicine have
centralized financial aid offices with
a need-based approach to aid, funds
are more limited in all other schools
at the graduate level, where aid is
more commonly found in the form
of fellowships and teaching assist
antships.
Determining supplemental aid
from the Yellow Ribbon Program,
however, is contingent upon the
base tuition rate established by the
state's most expensive public

school. In California, the billing sys
tem employed by public colleges
and universities presents a unique
legal quagmire — the costs of edu
cation for state residents are not
classified as "tuition." but rather as
"registration fees."
Because all of California's public
colleges and universities have
tuition rates listed as zero dollars
for 2008-2009. under a strict legal
interpretation, veterans in the state
would be required to pay out-of
pocket for the full cost of tuition
not covered by the Yellow Ribbon
Program. Cooper noted that, up
until a week ago. California's maxi
mum charge per credit hour was
listed as $254.
"Right now. that makes it look
like vets attending private institu
tions [in California] won't be
receiving any government base aid
from the VA." Cooper said.
But Cooper referred to the dis
crepancy as a "semantic differ

ence." though she acknowledged
that a minor technicality had the
potential to present major obsta
cles for prospective veteran appli
cants seeking aid in California from
the Yellow Ribbon Program.
The confusion created bv these
last-minute revisions has been com
pounded by the fact that state
tuition rates for 2009-2010 will not
be available until Aug. I. well after
the June 15 deadline for colleges to
offer their consent for participation.
Though the University's final
policy regarding the program has
not been decided on yet, but
Cooper was confident that it is
forthcoming.
"We've been having ongoing
discussion for the last six weeks or
so, and anticipate making our final
decision definitely before May 15."
