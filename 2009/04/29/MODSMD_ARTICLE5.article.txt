### LIZ STARK SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The average salary for a Stanford associate
professor is the highest in the country, and the
average salary for a full professor is the second
highest, behind only I larvard. according to the
annual report on faculty salaries by the
American Association of University Professors
(AAI T>
For the 200K- 2(X)9 year, prior to the decision
to freeze salaries, a full Stanford professor was
slated toearn an average of $1X1.900.0n1y full
professors at Harvard earned more

$ 192.6(H).
The average salary for a Stanford associate
professor was $ 12Â«S.(MX); the ( alifornia Institute
of Technology w;is second with $126,200.
According to Provost John Etchemendy.
these figures are the product of Stanford's
need to retain and attract a high-quality facul
ty.
"I ligh salaries go hand in hand with having
a top faculty." Etchemendy wrote in an email
to The Daily. "The higher quality your faculty,
the more competition there is with other uni
versities to attract and keep them, and this is
what pushes salaries up."

Professor of Sociology and Chair of the
Faculty Senate Karen Cook expressed concern
over the long-term effect of Stanford's recent
salary freeze on the University's faculty in an
email to The Daily.
"My sense of the faculty is that they are will
ing to take some pain in the short run in terms
of frozen salaries to help out the schools and
the University." she said."but that this is not a
wise strategy in the longer term because we
will begin to lose very talented faculty to com
peting institutions."
In comparison to the AAUP's data from
2007-2008. the average Stanford full professor

salary- increased by $8,200 or approximately
0.05 percent. The national average increase was
3.4 percent, according to AAUP calculations.
As expected. Stanford's salaries in the two
categories were significantly higher than the
national average. $151,403 for full professors
and $95,948 for associate professors.
In defending the salaries. Etchemendy cited
the recent individual academic program rank
ings in U.S. News and World Report, in which
alf 17 of Stanford's considered departments
were in the top 10 for their field.
