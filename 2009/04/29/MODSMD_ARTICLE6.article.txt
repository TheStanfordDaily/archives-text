goals and speak for the freedoms of the stu

ators to approach the year ahead with a mind
towards what they will be remembered for
and how they will benefit the individual stu
dents during their term.

and create change." De la Torre said, empha
si/ing the importance of the senators partici
pating in legislation as friends and servants
of the student body at large.
Ihe meeting proceeded with the election
ol the new Senate's chair and deputy chair.
"I decided I would only run for senate if
pigs fly: well, swine flu." Sivaram said in his
opening remarks to accept his nomination
for chair.

With no additional nominations. Sivaram
was questioned at length by members of the
audience and other senators who were con
cerned with how he would work with the
Senate to facilitate meetings.
Sivaram listed his primary goals as chair
as increasing coordination, accountability
and oversight of the Nominations
Committee, being a motivational force for
the Senate and forging strong and produc
tive relationships with administrators. He
also stressed his role in facilitating discussion
in the Senate.
"I want to be a strong moderating force

The 11th Undergraduate Senate convened for the first time last night. After a goodbye from previous senators, it continued with the business of
electing its chair, Varun Sivaram '1 1 (ninth from left), in a 14-1 vote, and its deputy chair, Kelsei Wharton '12 (fourth from left), in an 8-7 vote.
that allows the Senate to run seam
lessly and efficiently." Sivaram said.
"I want this body to have clout."
Shelley Gao '11. chair of the 10th
Senate, probed Sivaram on what he
envisions to be paramount on the
Senate's agenda — political issues
or issues of student life. Sivaram
noted the chief importance of cam
pus issues.
"I would really not encourage
this Senate to go out on a limb and
tackle tough political questions that
really are not within the realm of
the Undergraduate Senate,"
Sivaram said. "Our effectiveness
should be largely confined to cam
pus issues."
When he was later asked about
his thoughts concerning 2008
California Propositions 4 and 8.
Sivaram noted that he was not in
support of Proposition 8. but chose
not to elaborate, because he felt his
views were not relevant to the dis
cussion.
Wharton and Wanyoike both
emphasized the importance of bet
ter incorporating Senate associates
into the ASSIJ Senate and doing

more outreach during New Student
Orientation to recruit incoming
frosh who might be interested in
participating in student govern
ment.
"I feel like frosh council should
definitely be described in more
detail [to incoming frosh]," Wharton
said. "Thirty-four or 35 freshmen
just kind of there working on social
issues and not necessarily being
able to express themselves political
ly — I think it's doing a disservice to
the student body."
With its leadership elected, the
new Senate also discussed its first
series of proposed bills.
Although the funding modifica
tion bill for the Elections
Commission and all other student
funding bills were passed by the
preceding Senate, the new Senate
agreed to postpone discussion of a
sustainability bill, which would
place more stringent expectations
on the ASSIJ to adopt more sustain
able practices.
Although most were in support
of the spirit of the bill, the Senate
felt the details of costs, as well as
specifics of its implementation,
needed to be discussed before the
bill's passing.
