## Stan's Labyrinth 
### MOLLY SPAETH 
I walked into MemChu on Iriday morning at about
1 1 a.m.. curious and undeniably excited to finally
"Walk the Labyrinth" —a ritual that I had heard
about from a friend of mine, but a path that I had
never actually taken.
I have to admit that I was nervous, the idea of walking
so close to the altar of such a majestic church seemed
almost sacrilegious to me. Although I now no longer prac
tice, the idea of what my very-( atholic grandparents would
say about me walking a maze in such close proximity to an
altar of (iod did give me a slight case of the jitters.
I entered the doors of the church a few paces behind a
couple wearing cameras around their necks and past a
sign that read: "Walk the Labyrinth in Memorial Church.
I riday K a.m.-1 p.m. Sponsored by the Office for
Religious I ile." I started to walk into the main area of the
church when I was stopped by a man just outside the
door, lie pointed vigorously and decisively to a white,
laminated sign that read, quite clearly "NO PHOTOG
RAPHY."
I glanced down to see what I could have possibly done
to make him stop me so quickly in my tracks, while just a
few seconds earlier he had lei the couple with Canons
pass with ease. Was my rampant agnosticism that appar
ent? Did he think I was a harlot for wearing $20, hot-pink
pants? P<n>r outfit choice, I realized in retrospect.
In any case, I hadn't even set foot into the church and
I had already been met with discrimination, fueling my
already well-entrenched skepticism and negativity for
spiritual exercises This could be going better.
dive hack.
When I lirst entered the church, the only people there,
besides mysell, were the ( anon-clad couple. I watched as
the dark-haired woman took oil her shoes and entered
the labyrinth.
I had envisioned a maze of secret twists and turns.
Instead. I saw a simple, purple plastic mat laid out on the
floor.
There was a white sign next to the stairs leading up to
the labyrinth that read "Walking the labyrinth usually
takes about 20-30 minutes, and can take longer." I did a
double-take to make sure that the sign didn't say two to
three minutes, as the woman who had just entered a
minute ago was already in the center and posing for her
husband. A minute later, she had re-emerged.

Iliere was a box of purple pamphlets next to the stairs.
1 grabbed one and decided to see il there were any tips
that could help me walk the labyrinth with as much "zen"
as possible. According to my pamphlet, the labyrinth was
designed to be a path of prayer, a mirror of the soul and
a crucible of change.

I took my shoes oil and embarked on my journey into
the labyrinth. I tried to walk slowly, and was actually kind
of forced to because the turns in the maze are literally
hairpins. I started to get dizzy as I walked around and
around in circles. My brain was so locused on following
the path that all I could think about was how much easi
er this would be il I had been an urban studies major.
I reached the center after about a minute and a half.

and looked up to see that five more people had joined me
in the ( hurch. They were now staring at the shoeless girl
in bright pink pants and a white tank top, standing in the
middle of a purple mat at the front of one of the oldest,
most beautiful and sacred parts of one of the most privi
leged universities in the world. For the second time that
day, I regretted my outfit choice.
So much peace. So much love. So much joy. / can now
smile past my pain thank you. Hod.
I spent a few moments collecting my thoughts and tak
ing in the sights and sounds of the church. I exited the
labyrinth almost as quickly as I had come, disappointed in
both mysell and the labyrinth for not giving me the prop
er "zen" time I thought I was entitled to.
I was about to leave the Church, having been convert
ed from a hopeful agnostic to an even bigger, hardened
skeptic when a gold-emblazoned guestbook caught my
eye. I hesitated, and then darted around another Asian
tourist couple to grab it.

of war, pain, and suffering.

I don't know what happened to me then. As I read the
guestbook, tears began to well up in mv eyes. I don't
know if I was moved by the pain and beauty of the entries
of these random strangers, or the fact that I had been so
fundamentally incapable ol experiencing that kind of raw
emotion.
As I read, the same surroundings that I had previous
ly deemed judgmental and discriminatory now seemed
comforting, loving and accepting.

A lather luigs his two daughters,staring up at the front
of the church. He kisses them on their heads and whis
pers. "I love you "A man grabs Ins wife's hand and kisses
her on the lips as they read the quotes engraved on the
stone walls. A mom whispers to her son as he stares up at
the rose-colored stained glass.
This is so amazing and beautiful.
I may not have been centered in the labyrinth, but
somehow my experience with the labyrinth centered me.
Maybe I m not the kind ol person that can experience
paths of prayer or crucibles of change, but I believe what
I read in those guestbook entries really were mirrors of
the soul. I lie intimate exchanges ol love I saw between
the people in Memorial ( hurch that day were raw. real
and untainted expressions of love. It made me wonder
whether maybe, when it comes down to il. all you really
do need is love.
I lelt MemC hu with a smile on my face and maybe a
little more love in my heart. I waved goodbye to the NO
PI IO10( JRAPIIY man and wished him a happy week
end My experience with the labyrinth was probably not
typical, nor was it expected, but I can guarantee you that
it will be repeated.
