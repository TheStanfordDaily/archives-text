Stanford myth No. 2X: Even if you
sign up now, the waiting period to
get married in MemChu is five
year.
False.
Perhaps the myth started because
rumor has it that 70 percent of Stanford
students marry other Stanford students.
Hut according to I die Harry, Stanford
Alumni Association's vice president of
Marketing & ('onimunications. that's false,
too Hie number is probably no more than
15-20 percent Harry said after reviewing
Stanford's alumni database.
Whatever the reason, the approxi
mately 100 couples who get married each
year at Memorial Church can testify that
the waiting period is merely a few
months. Even wilh the 20 percent
increase in the number of weddings from
last year, couples can often select their
date of choice.
"I guess we're really lucky because I his
increase isn't a trend with other churches in
the area, who are experiencing a crunch,"
said MemChu Wedding Coordinator Mary
Gallagher '75. "With everything going
down the tank, it's wonderful that people
are still getting married."
Hul the staff likes to credit the popular
ity ol a MemChu wedding lo iis uniquely
comprehensive wedding program. Aside
from the obvious provision of a magnifi
cent location, all couples receive pre-mari
tal counseling, the Taylor-Johnson person
alitv profile test, the organist, photogra
phers. a wedding coordinator and clergy
service for a total fee of $2900.
The comprehensive program has
attracted couples who "have run the
gamut," said Organist Robert lluw
Morgan, who has been playing at MemC Tin
for nearly 10 years.
"Some are calm, cool and collected, and
others are frantic, running behind,"
Morgan said. "People have forgotten veils,
the marriage license and even the rings."
One time, the melodic sound of
Morgan's organ playing had lo compete

with ambulance sirens, as paramedics were
rushed through the church's double doors
to help a collapsed relative.
"Another time, the bride was walking
down the aisle, and she slipped right on her
ass," Morgan laughed, "l uckily the dress
served as a cushion."
While each wedding is inherently
unique and memorable, all couples have
one commonality in that at least one mem
ber must have an affiliation with Stanford,
whether as a student, faculty member or
even regular church-goer. Couples from all
faith denominations, and even same-sex
couples, are welcome to marry in
MemC lui.
Fo enhance this welcome. Reverend
Scolty Mcl ennan, dean of Religious Life
and a minister lor 34 years, ensures that
each couple receives its own tailored ser
mon. McLennan talks to couples months
ahead ol the wedding, acquainting himself
with them and then personalizing their
service.
"I never get tired of weddings because
every couple is unique," McLennan said.
"Lacli ceremony is intense and exciting."
"We're very serious about what we do."
(iallagher agreed. "We don't want to do
cookie-cutter weddings."
"It's an incredible privilege and honor
to be able to be a part of a couple's rite of
passage." McLennan added. "It's a joyful
celebration of their new life together.
Some people cry and can't finish their
lines. It's a very poignant time when two
people at that one moment are forever
joined together."
