## EDITORIAL Progress in grad, faculty diversity a positive sign 
### 
On April 16, the Faculty Senate met to
discuss issues of diversity among
Stanford graduate students and fac
ulty. I he Vice Provost's Office for Graduate
Education reported an increase in women's
representation in graduate programs — par
ticularly in earth sciences and engineering
however, the proportion of women in en
gineering, science and economics remains
low.
Along with improvements in gender di
versity in graduate programs, ethnic and
racial diversity has also improved in recent
years — enrollment of African-Americans
has increased bv eight percent since 1995.
while enrollment of Mispanics and Native
Americans has increased by four and six per
cent. respectively. Based on these statistics,
Stanford is doing better than other schools
nationwide; national enrollment for each of
these three minority groups has been drop
ping since 1985.7b date. African-Americans
compose 31 percent of the Stanford gradu
ate student population, Mispanics compose
5.1 percent and Native Americans make up
0.7 percent. The Asian American popula
tion. which stands at 13 percent of the total
graduate population, has continued to grow,
as has the international graduate student
population.
The editorial board commends the Uni
versity administration's commitment to
maintaining and promoting diversity in the
graduate schools, despite the challenges of
the economic downturn. Stanford should
continue to provide broad support for diver
sity in graduate education, while focusing
more of its efforts on increasing minority
representation within specific academic
fields, lor example, Stanford should try to
boost recruitment of women in engineering,
science and economics by honing its market
ing strategy and continuing to formulate
competitive funding packages.
Stanford also has significant room to im

prove when it comes to promoting faculty di
versity. According to Vice Provost for Facul
ty Development and Diversity Patricia
Jones, underrepresented minorities have not
seen any significant increase in representa
tion among Stanford faculty in recent years.
Although Asian-American representation
among the faculty has almost doubled since
1998. the percentage of African-American,
Hispanic and Native-American faculty
members has remained roughly constant at
2.4 percent, 3.2 percent and 0.2 percent, re
spectively. While the editorial board recog
nizes that the administration faces signifi
cant challenges to recruiting and retaining
an ethnically diverse faculty — including
legal constraints on targeting minorities for
hiring — this type of diversity is crucial to
upholding Stanford's standards of academic
excellence. When it comes to ethnic diversi
ty among Stanford faculty, we must find a
way to improve.That being said, the editori
al board congratulates the administration on
the large increases in female faculty in earth
sciences and engineering over the past 10
years.
Finally, the editorial board believes that
the President's Award for Excellence
Through Diversity is an important step to
ward honoring individuals and organiza
tions that have promoted diversity at Stan
ford. The award, which was created this year,
will be given to one individual and one cam
pus unit — such as a department or program
that has "made exceptional contributions
to enhancing and supporting diversity,
broadly defined, within the Stanford com
munity."
It is high time that the University institu
tionalized recognition for those who work
hard to champion campus diversity. We can
only hope that doing so will help us to move
forward and ensure representation for every
gender, race, ethnicity, culture and sexuality
regardless of the economic forecast.
