The pride you'll feel in being a doctor increases dramatically when you care for
our Soldiers and their Families. Courage is contagious. Our Health Professions
Scholarship Program (HPSP) helps you reach your goal by providing full tuition,
money towards books and lab fees, a $20,000 sign-on bonus, plus a monthly
stipend of more than $1,900.
