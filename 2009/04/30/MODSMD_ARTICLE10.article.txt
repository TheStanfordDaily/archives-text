## Nicole Demby A 						post-feminist critique of my sex life 
### 
It's funny how sometimes the themes
prevalent in my life and the themes ad
dressed in my classes coincide. This week is
devoted to questions of feminism in both the
personal and academic life of Nicole Demby.
Don't worry. I'm not about to launch into
some diatribe about how a boy held the door
open for me and sent me railing off about the
patriarchy. In fact, I've never really felt partic
ularly oppressed or discriminated against as a
woman. I have no doubt I owe so much of my
freedom of choice to my feminist forebears,
yet because perhaps I take this freedom for
granted, feminism has always seemed like a
slightly moot point in my own life.
That is. until last week when I realized my
relationship with feminism may not be that
simple. The realization occurred when I was
revealing to a friend how I am falling in love
wilh the guy I am seeing, and how I feel vul
nerable and out of control as a result. I told
her I was afraid to express my feelings to him
lest I lapse into that classically feminine role
so ingrained in our cultural consciousnesses
by TV and movies — that girl who scares the
boy away by talking about potential chil
dren's names on the third date.
Mv friend's wise remarks made me realize
how illogical the jumps in my mind were. I was
falling in love. sure. ()pening myself up and al
lowing my happiness to become contingent
upon someone else was putting me in a posi
tion of vulnerability, yes. Yet. how did it follow
that broaching the subject of my emotions
with my boyfriend was in some way too
"girly? In making this connection, I was im
plicitly bolstering social conventions of how
boys and girls act differently in relationships.
By thinking that my depth oi feeling necessar
ily [nit me in the position of the ["motional
Ciirl. I was implying that the succumbing in
herent in the love 1 was experiencing was cat
egorically feminine.
As I thought more about this over the next
few days, I realized my vulnerability with re
gards to my relationship was only a metonym
for a larger helplessness I've been feeling late
ly. A lot of this helplessness springs from the
fact that I'm broke. My poverty is fueling all
the anxieties I have about not being able to
sustain myself in the future.
Worrying about job prospects and the gen
eral direction in which my life should be head
ing has cracked open a Pandora's Box of all
the ways I feel inadequate. Suddenly. I can't
help thinking of myself as this free-floating,
artsy spirit totally incapable of functioning in

frn not about to launch into
some diatribe about how a boy
held the door open for me (...)

the real world. I can't even drive, for heaven's
sake.
The fact that my boyfriend is older and has
a car and great job prospects has been giving
these grossly overblown worries a gendered
dimension. My discussion with my friend, as
well as my subsequent self-analysis, has made
me realize that in thinking this way, not only
am I making my vulnerability classically fem
inine. I am thinking in terms of even broader
cultural stereotypes: the loopy, wide-eyed
artist as archetypically feminine, versus the
stable man capable of bringing home the
bacon.
In my classes this week, we talked about
meta-narratives and how feminists fight
against the way these discourses particularize
"women." These discourses seek to make
"women"a natural and easily defined catego
ry that connotes certain obvious traits. I read
Laura Mulvey's "Visual Pleasure and Narra
tive Cinema" for the billionth time in my aca
demic career (unavoidable if you study art or
film theory) in which she talks about repre
sentations of women on screen as catering en
tirely to the male gaze.
I Discussions of patriarchal meta-narratives
and society's construction of the "ideal
woman may seem old hat to women my age
territory well-trodden by our mothers and
grandmothers that is perhaps better put to
rest. Yet. maybe I have fallen prev to these
forces in my own life more than I would care
to admit. While I may not feel like any exter
nal force is oppressing me or forcing me into
a preordained role, my experiences have re
vealed that I have indisputably internalized
certain cultural expectations that complicate
my own relationship with myself.
Iliere are many women all over the world
who still face overt oppression on the basis of
their sex. We in the West are left to grapple
with the more subtly nefarious ways gen
dered thinking acts in our daily lives.
