## Oh, beautiful, marvelous you! 
### 
When we are honest with ourselves,
when we see past all the lies and
smoke screens we may place before
our eyes, we know that beyond everything
else, there is one group that lays the founda
tion upon which our society is built.They are
the rock of civilization, the standard by which
we may measure our own selves:
Attractive people.
How we adore and worship you,attractive
people! You, the pretty, the handsome, the
ever-deserving of our unending adulation!
You. the athletes, the six-packed, eight
packed. twelve-packed. Kappa-Theta-Delta-
Beta-Sigma-Greco-Roman gods on earth!
Oh, beautiful, magnanimous, magnificent,
glorious, wonderful you!
And don't you know it!? As you sit on
your perch, you still, with great self-aware
ness. understand that with good looks comes
great responsibility — not only to yourself,
but to your fellow attractive people. You
know that your power lies not in numbers,
but in concentration. What matters, as any
enlightened person knows, is not what you
do, but with whom you do if, not who you see.
but with whom you are seen: not how you
perceive yourself, but how others perceive
you. Fools — commoners — call it narcis
sism. What they fail to understand, as you do.
is that this is where the power lies.
And rightly so! What have the common
ers done to deserve your attention? What do
they offer you? Certainly not the status to
which you must grip firmly with both hands
at every public moment! For who can give
you status without being attractive, and what

is a person without status?
Certainly, there are fools in your very so
ciety. attractive people who threaten to bring
down the very power structure that has made
you kings and queens.They treat their fellow
humans as humans deserving of dignity, re
gardless of looks; they give the commoners
the time of day even if they desire neither sex
nor power from them: they even, it must be
said — and dare I say it — do not pick their
friends based on their looks.
Fools! What are they doing to you? What
are they doing to our system thai has given
you everything you have, that has given you
all the valued good-looking friends that
make legitimate your claim to attractive
ness?
You know better. And with those rolling
eyes, the little smile to a fellow attractive
friend and the dismissive hand, you dutifully
command that the commoners submit to
your silent rallying cry: "Keep them sepa
rate!"
After all. they can have each other— is
that not enough?! Must they lay claim to you.
as well?!
To which you must answer: No! Enough is
enough. How dare the commoners even
deign to ask you to give them the time of
day? Have they not considered what a
friendship between you. the magnificent, and
they, the ordinary, would do to your reputa
tion? TTiey should consider themselves lucky
that you even give them a morsel of your
table scraps of dignity, let alone that you even
consider — for one second — letting them
sit at such a table at all.

It was better in high school, when the mer
itocracy of good looks was fully in place, with
all barriers to entry still strong. Now, as your
first wrinkles appear behind your celebrity
sunglasses and the aging process is slowly set
ting in, your rivals of soul, kindness and per
sonality are giving your good looks a run for
the money that helped purchase them. What
are you without them? What will you be
when your friends no longer turn an eye?
Where will you turn?
It is the responsibility of the adoring to
rise and say as one: Please stop worrying. It
gives you wrinkles. You have made it to the
top on merit alone — let no one tell you dif
ferently. It is nothing less than your responsi
bility to treat those who appear to be your
equals as equals. And if someone is not equal
to you in appearance, what can they possibly
offer you? Friendship? Laughable.
Your attractive friends who treat the com
moners with respect simply will not stop,
though, and therein lies the problem. Oh. but
attractive people — the commoners are
whispering. Your reputation is being tar
nished. The time has come, at long last, to
stand up. AND DEFEND YOUR RIGHT
FUL PLACE OF POWER.
If you don't defend your well-deserved
right to the exclusive top of the social hierar
chy, who will? No one. I promise you. no one
will defend it. because no one can.

Mark knows what you re thinking: He had bet
ter be real attractive if he thinks he can get away
with writing something like this. Defend your
honor at mrdonig@stanford.edu.
