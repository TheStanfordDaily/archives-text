The Hornets stung the Cardinal again in
the eighth as Brent 11 of ('man hit a leadoff sin

just squirted through the left side, scored an
other run for the Hornets before Storen

into the bottom half of the inning.
The Stanford offense, though, wasn't done
for the evening. Walsh hit a leadoff single up
the middle against reliever Tommy Elrod.and
August and junior Toby Gerhart drew a pair of
walks to load the bases for Stanford with no
outs and the heart of the order due up in the
bottom half of the inning.
Kiilsgaard. though, struck out against Jeff
Roth, who came back to the mound from his
spot over at first base, and the I iornets pitcher
looked to have senior first baseman Brent
Milleville well in hand, taking the count to 1-2.
Bui Milleville unloaded on the next pitch,
driving his third career grand slam over the

left-field wall to tie the score at 4-4 with a sin
gle swing of the hat.
"My first couple of at bats were pretty
had." Milleville said of his 1-4 night at the
plate."They kept throwing me fastballs in. and
then,this at bat. they threw me a couple of slid
ers. [... Roth] left it over the middle of the plate

and. you know. [I] got lucky and connected. I
don't know, it felt pretty good."
