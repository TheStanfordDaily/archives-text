# LIVING WITH THE SLUGGERS
## 
### DAN BOHM STAFF WRITER 
It's not often that a sports writer has the privilege
to live in close quarters with the athletes he or she
is covering. I lowever. when you are a college stu
dent reporting on college sports, sometimes
everyday life mixes with action on the field.
As a member of the Sigma Alpha I psilon (SAH)
fraternity. I have had the unique opportunity to witness
firsthand the way in which Stanford baseball players
lives are simplified and enhanced by living together in a
fraternity.
To say there is an SAH undercurrent in Stanford
baseball would be putting it mildly. Baseball players
have long been a staple of the SAH house.
('leveland Indians first baseman Ryan (iarko was an
SAH at Stanford, as was Colorado Rockies pitcher
Cireg Reynolds — the second overall pick in the 2()()fi
MLB Draft.
Hie tradition continues today. SAH Jason Castro
was the IC)th overall pick in last year's draft and on
opening day this season, seven starters called SAH
home.
So why SAH? What is it about the house that attracts
baseball players?
Part of it has to be simply tradition. Players choose
to live with their teammates largely because of the
lengthy lineage.
Sophomore catcher Ben ( "lowe recognizes that.

"SAH has a long baseball tradition, and it's nice to be
a part of that and keep it rolling." ( lowe said.
That isn't the whole story, however.There are no jun
ior baseball players in SAH. yet there are three seniors
and six sophomores.
The players enjoy the ability to be with one another
whether it is to eat their meals together or to com
miserate about the struggles of a long season.
It isn't uncommon to see baseball players packed
onto infielder .I.J. Jelmini's couch to watch "House" or
"24" or TiVo. Jelmini, along with roommate Brent
Milleville (the two have roomed together for three
years running) and Jeff Whitlow are the pseudo-father
figures of the baseball faction.
Sophomore catcher/infielder Zach Jones recognizes
the influence the older players can have in all aspects of
life.
"It's nice to live with older players who have experi
ence on and off the diamond. They've been here for
awhile and they understand what it takes to succeed in
baseball and in the classroom," Jones said.
The three seniors can be seen telling tales of the past
and giving advice to the next generation of budding
Stanford stars — Jake Schlander. Jones and Clowe.
Iliey all have gregarious relationships with one anoth-

er. and at any time any one of them
can be the victim of a joke or a
prank.
At times, "arguments" over
whether a pitch was a ball or a strike,
or if a play was a hit or an error, can
rage for hours. Milleville's booming
voice can be heard echoing through
the hulls of the house telling Whitlow
and Jelmini they are wrong and that
that ball hit up the middle should ac
tually have been fielded by the sec
ond baseman.
In addition to the time spent with
one another, the ability to be a part
of a group outside of just the team is
also appealing to the baseball play
ers. Often times, college athletes are
caught up only associating with
teammates. Hv being a member of a
fraternity, the Stanford baseball
players are able to balance their time
with their team as well as another or
ganization.
"It's real nice to become close
with a lot of other guys. A lot of play
ers t)ii the team only hang out with
teammates. By being in SAE. I can
get away from baseball, broaden my
horizons and meet new people,"
Clowe said.

By taking part in the traditions of
SAH alongside other students, the
baseball players are able to clear
their heads and avoid becoming
overwhelmed with baseball all the
time.
As Whitlow points out. being in
SAE also provides the team with a
steady fan base.
"SAE is awesome. It provides a
very enthusiastic support group for a
less-than-rowdy fan base," he said.
Though this phenomenon is by
no means unique to baseball players
at Stanford, the tradition at SAE is
as perpetual and longstanding as
anv, and is likely to continue for
years to come.
