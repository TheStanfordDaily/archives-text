## Women clinch title in dominant fashion Cardinal proves itbelongs in tourney 
### SARAH OHR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The No. 13 Stanford
women's lacrosse team was un
stoppable this weekend as they
won the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation tournament
for the fifth consecutive time.
The title, won on the Farm, was
the Cardinal's 12th in 13 years.
On its way to capturing the top
spot. Stanford easily defeated
UC-Davis 17-3 and took down
California 18-13.
"Although some may be
tempted to mark this down as
just another title, I think this
year is more than that," said
senior Jamie Nesbitt. "We did
n't just win the MPS!" this year
we dominated the competi
tion and proved that to win a
title in this league, teams have
to find a way to stop us first."
Leading the Cardinal offen
sive against Davis were sopho
mores Karen Nesbitt and
Leslie Foard, and junior
Amanda Schwab, all of whom
scored three goals. The game
was also highlighted by fresh
man reserve Anna Boeri's
tying of the Stanford single
game record with five assists,
which was matched earlier this
year by junior Claire I lubbard.
"She's a player I'm looking
|forward| to coaching for four
years," Stanford coach Amy
Bokker said of Boeri. "She has
great vision on the field, and
that's something you can't
teach."
Foard and Nesbitt led the
offense again, along with
MPSF Player of the Year jun
ior Lauren Schmidt, during the
championship game against
Cal.
"The Cal game was pretty
close at times, which meant we
had to keep playing and never
let up because Cal is a team
that is going to keep coming at
you the entire bO minutes,"

Foard said. "I think we played
really good team lacrosse with
a lot of people contributing on
both sides of the field."
The Cardinal demonstrated
great defensive depth despite
season-long defensive injuries.
Big contributions came from
seniors Jamie Nesbitt and
Melissa Vogelsong, junior
Eleanor Foote, sophomore
Ashley Aruffo and freshman
Paige Farmakis.
"Paige and several others
have stepped up really well in
response to all the injuries, and
it's a great thing to be a part of
a team that doesn't give up
when luck isn't really on our
side," Schmidt said. "It's excit
ing that we are so deep and
that anyone can lead the team
on any given day."
Although the season is not
yet over, younger members
cannot help but realize that
this depth will likely play out
into what they hope will be an
other successful run next year.
Due to injuries, the Cardinal is
left with only three seniors
who are still able to play.
"Our depth means good
things for next year since most
of the team will be back."
Schmidt said.
In addition to the team title,
the Cardinal collected a num
ber of other MPSF awards this
year. Prior to tournament play,
it was announced that mem
bers selected to the 16-member
MPSF First Team include Stan
ford senior Maris Perlman and
juniors Julie Christy, Dana
Findsay and Schmidt. Stan
ford players selected for the
MPSF All-Tournament team
include Foard. Jamie Nesbitt.
Foote and Karen Nesbitt. who
also received the tournament's
Most Valuable Player Award.
"I thought she was the best
player," Bokker said of Nes
hitt. "She was getting draw con
trols. playing defense, marking
players and scoring goals. She was
doing it all."
Next up for Stanford is
Louisville. This non-conference
game will mark Stanford's final
home match for the 2009 season
before they travel to face No. 2
Penn. Since the winner of the
MPSF tournament does not re
ceive an automatic bid. this will be
an important game in Stanford's
fight to prove that it belongs at the
NCAA tournament. The at-large
bids will be announced from 7-8
p.m. on Sunday. May 3.
"It feels great to get another
title and ride off of that momen
tum going into our last two regu
lar season games, and I look for
ward to seeing how the NCAA
bid pans out." Foard said. "I think
we have a good chance, hut these
last two games are going to be big
for us."
"If we play the lacrosse we
know how to play and keep work
ing hard, I think we can make big
things happen."
