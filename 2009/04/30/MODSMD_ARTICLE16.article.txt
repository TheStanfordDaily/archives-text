# Baseball down, but not out
## 
### 
There is less than one month
left in the season for Stanford
baseball,and the possibility of
a repeat run to Omaha is be
coming slimmer and slimmer.
The Cardinal just wrapped up its
season-high seven-game homestand
with a winning record, but managed to
take only one of the critical three
game series against Arizona. Stanford
is now in seventh place in the Pacific
-10 Conference, and seven games be
hind conference leader Arizona State,
with just nine conference games to
play. Clearly, any hope of winning the
conference disappeared a while ago.
and it seems unlikely that any more
than two or three teams from the Pac
-10 will be selected to the NCAA Tour
nament.
But that doesn't mean the season is
over.
Stanford opens up another three
game conference series tomorrow
evening against the No. 2 team in the
Pac-10. Washington State. If the Card
manages to return from the Pacific
Northwest with a sweep under its belt,
the final three weeks could be pretty
interesting.
Not only would taking all three
games from the Cougars bring Stan
ford within a game and a half of its con
ference rival, depending on how other
series go this weekend, it could place
the Card within striking distance of the
top three in the conference. Throw in
two more strong weekends at USC
and a visit from Oregon State to close
out the season — not to mention an
extremely tough non-conference se
ries with New Mexico next weekend
— and Stanford could be in real posi
tion to grab one of the last at-large bids
to the postseason.
Sure, this is a long shot.and a lot of
things would have to go right, but hop
ing for miracles and being there when
they happen is one of the biggest rea
sons we love sports — just ask any
Carolina I lurricane fan after a last-sec
ond comeback in game seven two
nights ago.
Stanford has the bats to score six or
more runs every game it plays in, and
the weekend pitching can be lights-out
when it is on. Yes. this is what all the
baseball writers here at The Daily have
been pointingout all season,and it has
n't happened as often as any of us ex
pected — but it remains true.
'Iliis team is good enough to beat
anyone when everyone plays at their
best. The problem is that there hasn't
been more than a handful of games in
which the entire lineup is having qual
ity at-bats and the pitchers are all hit
ting their spots. It seems like when the
big guns in the middle of the order
Toby Gerhart, Kellen Kiilsgaard and
Brent Milleville — are all having good
days no one gets on base in front of
them, and when guys like Zach Jones.
Adams Gaylord and Jake Schlander
are picking up base hits no one is able
to drive them in. The pitching has
bailed out the offense to steal wins on
more than a few occasions, but it has
also given away more than a handful of
games.
Of course there have been those
mid-week games against California
and Santa ( lara when the offense ab
solutely explodes and the bullpen
committee that works during the
week combines for solid outings, but
this sort of success needs to be found
on the weekend and within the confer
ence.
No. this team isn't as talented as last
year's and they don't have quite the
same quantity of upperclassmen lead
ership and experience, but that does
n't mean they can't do the same things.
The 2009 version of the Cardinal is less
able to absorb poor performances
from a couple of key players than last
year's club, but if every player puts to
gether a solid game, this team is very
difficult to beat. That doesn't mean the
pitchers need to toss a shutout or the
team needs to pick up double-digit
hits to win a game, but if the pitchers
throw strikes and hitters work counts,
get bunts down and stay out of double
plays — while picking up a couple of
big hits it should be enough.
So don't give up hope yet. because
this team still has plenty of baseball left
to play. And even if things don't work
out, enough players should return to
make next year's team just as interest
ing.
