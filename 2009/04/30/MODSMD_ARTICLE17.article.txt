### DANIEL BUI STAFF WRITER 
Last night, the Graduate Student Council (GSC)
swore in its newly elected representatives and held
internal elections for various GSC positions, eventually
voting Eric Osborne and Nanna Notthoff as its co
chairs.
Ihe last meeting for delegates from 2(KIH-2(X)9
began with a generally positive review of last week's
Graduate Formal.
"It went much more smoothly than last year," said
Adam Sciambi, programming coordinator and a grad
uate student in applied physics."Everyone seemed like
they had a good time."
1 lowever. discussions of the event quickly gave way
to funding requests from various student groups across
aim pus.
Delegates approved $1,005 for Pakistanis at
Stanford. $600 for the Chinese and Culture Network.
$4,400 for the Korean Students Association, $5,155 for
the Mexican Students Association and $2,560 for

Stanford Classics in Theater to each hold their own
assortment of social and arts events.
After the budgetary matters were resolved, dele
gates began the transition of the GSC from the 2(X)K
-2( X to 2009-2() 1() year. In an informal ceremony, outgo
ing GSC co-Chair Polina Segalova swore in representa
tives chosen in the recent election to serve next year.
At the end of the meeting, the GSC spent a signifi
cant amount of time deliberating over the elected
members who ran for the privilege of serving on inter
nal positions within the council.
Robert I lennessey. fourth-year graduate student in
electrical engineering, and Justin Brown, third-year
graduate student in geophysics, ran as one slate for co
chairs. Iheir primary strength, they noted, lay in their
experience in graduate student programming, with
Hennessey and Broun serving as the co-chair of the
Graduate Student Programming Board (GSPB) and
programming coordinator for the GSC. respectively.
The Hennessey/Brown slate also stressed trans
parency in GSC leadership.
"I really hope that the big difference that
[Hennessey] and I can make is so that anyone feels
really comfortable about approaching either of us...
and making sure that the lives of graduate students are
always put first." Brown said.

Eric Osborne, second-year law student, and Nanna
Notthoff. second-year graduate student in psychology,
ran on the second slate for co-chairs.
Rather than having similar strengths,the candidates
offered more complementary benefits to their cam
paign. Notthoff explained her heavy involvement in a
number of different areas of the C iS(namely as finan
cial officer. In contrast. Osborne noted his experience
outside of the GSC in serving as the chair of the
Nominations Commission, as well as his extensive
involvement with University administration and the
ASSIJ.
"I would think that Nanna and I would be stronger,
perhaps, on working with the administration," Osborne
said, emphasizing their differences and experience as
an advantage in speaking with University staff.
After a long deliberation behind closed doors, vot
ing members of the GSC elected Osborne and
Notthoff as the new co-chairs for the 2(XW-2010 sch(X)l
year.
Both slates pointed out the importance of remain
ing neutral in dealing with graduate issues and working
as a team.
"We're all in this together," Osborne noted.
