In Wednesday's Daily storv.
"Report: Stanford No. 2 in full pro
fessor pay," it was noted that from
2007-2008, the average Stanford full
professor salary increased by
$8,200. The salary was incorrectly
calculated as an increase of 0.05
percent; the increase was actually
6.8 percent, double the national
average of 3.4 percent.
