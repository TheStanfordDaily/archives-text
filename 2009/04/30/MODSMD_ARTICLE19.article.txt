## 
### ROXIE DICKINSON STAFF WRITER 
The No. 4 Stanford men's golf
team took fourth place yesterday at
the Pacific-10 Conference Champi
onships in Seattle. The Cardinal
fired team scores of one-under 359
and one-over 361 during the third
and fourth rounds of the tourna
ment, but it was not enough to over
come No. 16 Arizona State, who
beat the Cardinal by one stroke to
take third place outright.
No. 5 Washington took the Pac
-10 crown on its home course yester
day and was the only team to post an
overall under-par score. The
Huskies boasted a 16-under team
score of 1424 for the conference
championship. No. 46 Oregon was a
lull IS strokes behind Washington,
with a modest two-over 1442.
"The guys played pretty solidly."
said Stanford head coach Conrad
Ray. "Washington just got off to a
really hot start and never looked
back. Washington has just been on
fire lately. The guys were a little dis
appointed as we would have liked to
have finished higher at the Pac-lOs."
Freshman David Chung led the
Cardinal charge, taking a piece of
13th place on the individual ladder.
His second round cost him a higher
rank when he posted a four-over 76.
Fortunately, the rest of the tourna
ment would make up for it as Chung
posted even-par scores on the links
for rounds one and three, and even
went two under in the final round,
recording a stellar nine birdies and
an eagle on the tournament.
Just one stroke behind Chung
were sophomore Sihwan Kim and
senior Daniel Lim. who both tied for
16th individually with a three-over
291. Unfortunately for Kim, he post
ed an eight-over 80 in the first
round, which dictated his placement
in the individual ranks. Though he
had a tough first round. Kim easily
made up for it in the final three to
post his best finish since February.
He tied his lowest round score in the
second round with a three-under 69.
followed by two one-under 71
rounds to complete the tournament.
Lim's tough round came in the

second, when he posted a six-over
78. Like Kim. he compensated for it
by firing a two-under-par score of 70
in the first and third rounds, fol
lowed by a one-over 73 for the last

Pac-10 Championship of his colle
giate career.
In just his third tournament this
year, sophomore Graham Brock
ington earned himself a share of

35th place with a nine-over 297. His
best rounds came in the third and
fourth with a three-over 74 and a
one-under 71.
Senior Dodge kemmer recorded
a 10-over 298 for his final Pac-10

Championship, putting him in a tie
for 38th. Kemmer played consis
tently over the course of the tourna
ment. posting a 73,74,75 and 76 for
the tournament, with 10 birdies to
boot. Rounding out the Cardinal
showing was No. 10 sophomore
Steve Ziegler. He completed the
tournament in a tie for 44th. just two
strokes behind Kemmer with a 12-
over 300.
" ITiere were some great contri
butions from our golfers this tour
nament." Ray said."Chung has been
solid for us all year, especially dur
ing the spring season. Kim didn't
have quite his best game this time.
He shot himself in the foot during
the first round, which was tough to
come back from. Brockington's
scores came in the top five for our
team for the first time this year.
"Lim is coming into form late,"
Ray continued. "He's playing better
than he has all year. Lim is a guy
who was an All-American as a
freshman, and 1 think he's just start
ing to realize that he only has a few
tournaments left to make the most
of his skill on the course.There were
a lot of bright spots for the Pac-lOs,
but the guys were a little disappoint
ed that we didn't finish higher."
This is the second time in a row
that Washington has beaten Stan
ford. once at the Farm and once at
the Huskies' home in Seattle. The
Cardinal has a two-week break be
fore it heads to the NCAA Region
al Qualifying Tournament to face
Washington again.
"If you asked all the guys how
they feel, they are motivated and ex
cited for the NCAAs," Ray said.
"We haven't had our best tourna
ment yet this year, and we are look
ing forward to playing some of our
best golf against the top teams in the
country at the NCAA Champi
onship."
