## SSE makes $50,000 investment Student startup gaining attention of investors

Ventures, an entrepreneurial funding
source for students on campus, has just
made its biggest investment in history
five times its previous record
despite the poor economic climate.
The venture fund invested $50,000
into Iliink Gum. which produces a
mint-flavored'chewing gum that com
bines various nutrients with caffeine.
The gum is meant to enhance cognitive
abilities and academic performance.
Matt Davidson, a first-year student
in the School of Medicine, has 2.5 mil
lion pieces of chewing gum stacked
along the walls of his parents' 20-foot
by-20-foot basement in Los Angeles
and explained that he came up with the
concept of ITiink Gum as an under
graduate at UC-Berkeley.
"I heard a couple stories about how
chewing gum could help memory, and I
was taking a class called 'Drugs and the
Brain,' where we learned about differ
ent aromas and how they help with
concentration and memory," Davidson
said."Being a student myself, 1 was tak
ing a lot of tests and was really looking
for any edge I could get. I began to
chew peppermint gum. and I put rose
mary in my gum."
Chewing this makeshift form of
Think Gum, Davidson noticed an
improvement in his performance. After
graduating Phi Beta Kappa with high
honors, he decided that this was a mar
ketable product that would appeal to
numerous students.
Think Gum combines herbal stimu
lates including rosemary and gingko
biloba with aromatherapy and antioxi
dants to increase energy and mental
power. It also contains the equivalent
of half a can of soda's worth of caffeine.
The act of chewing gum in itself has
also been shown hy research to poten-
tially enhance academic perform
ance.
Baylor College of Medicine con
ducted a 2009 study in which lOS
students ranging from 13 to 16 years
of age were broken into two groups:
one that had to chew gum during
math class and one that had to
refrain from gum chewing. Fourteen
weeks later, the gum chewers had a
three percent increase in standard
ized math scores and significantly
higher final math grades than the
other students. The results indicated
that chewing gum may have a posi
tive effect on academic perform
ance. Researchers speculated that
gum leads to a decreased level of
stress, thus enhancing focus and
concentration.
In particular, the effectiveness of
Think Gum attracted SSI- Ventures
— as well as its ability to generate
revenue.
"In 2008. they did $50,000 in
sales," said SSI: CF:() Matt
McLaughlin. "The majority of that,
something around $40,000. came in
the last six months of 2008. So if
you're an investor and you're put
ting in money, you're like. wow. they
actually already have some success.
And there's nothing better than
putting money into a product that
has already been successful."
Ibis money is a starting point
that will be used to attract other
investors and will assist in the mar
keting and manufacturing of the
gum. SSF ; . Ventures will also own a
share of the company after legal

documents have been signed.
ITiink Gum was created in late
2007 and began selling gum in 2008.
Davidson experienced certain hur
dles in the initial stages of product
development, including raising
money and the physical manufac
turing of gum.
"I actually tried to make it
myself at first and bought this kit
where you microwave these gum
pellets and you add stuff to it.and it
turned out really terrible,"
Davidson said. "It was really sticky
and just didn't work out."
Since then, Davidson has found a
place that manufactures the gum
and has sold over a million pieces of
gum both in the U.S. and interna
tionally. Think Gum is currently
sold in the United States. Canada
and the U.K.. and is the largest
pharmaceutical distribution compa
ny in Botswana. It is also sold at
Moonbean's Coffee and other cam
pus-wide vendors.
Davidson explained that the cur
rent economic climate has not
affected sales of Think Gum
because he views gum as an insulat
ed product. Weighing in at two dol
lars a pack, he believes that it is not
enough of an economic burden and
is thus optimistic for company
growth.
"In the future, the plan is to
expand from just lliink Gum to all
sorts of functional candies,"
Davidson said. "It would be chew
ing gum and mint that would help
not just with thinking, but potential
ly with people's digestion and help
ing them relax and even helping
them lose weight or stav healthv."
