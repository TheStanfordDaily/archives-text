## Hospital expansion meets resistance 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
Expansion plans for the Stanford University
Medical Center's (SIJMC) hospital facilities are
yet to be resolved as concerns about increased
road traffic and employee housing remain,
despite the withdrawal of the Stanford Shopping
Center expansion application in early April.
The University withdrew the application for
the Shopping Center expansion to eliminate the
distraction from its primary concern, the hospi
tals.
In a letter to the mayor and city manager of
Palo Alto dated April 13, Vice President of
Stanford Real Estate Robert C. Reidy expressed
concern that the Shopping Center expansion
project may "compromise the hospital projects'
core objectives." The University believed that the
removal of the Shopping Center project would
help reduce overall environmental impact. In
addition, the current economic conditions have
made it more difficult to maintain plans to add to
the Shopping Center in concurrence with expan
sion plans for the hospitals.
However. Stanford still faces a number of
issues over which the community authorities and
members have expressed great concern. The pri
mary concern of Palo Alto residents, according to
City Interim Planning Director Curtis Williams, is
the inordinate amount of road traffic expected as

a result of the influx of new

SIJMC employees.
"I think there's no ques
tion that in general, the pub
lic and the City are support
ive of the concept of improv
ing those [facilities] and
bring them up to today's
standards and beyond."
Williams said. "We have
heard quite a bit of comment
from the community, particu
larly about traffic. We have
some concerns about people
having to drive from farther

away, so that's been one of the

reasons that we're looking at solu

tions that have to [do| with providing
housing closer to the Medical Center."
In fact. Palo Alto requires Stanford to

provide housing for its new employees as a
requirement for approval, according to a letter
from Christopher (i. Dawes and Martha II
Marsh. CEOs of Lucile Packard Children's
I lospital and Stanford I lospital. to Palo Alto city
council members. Ilns condition states that the
University must provide S ( M affordable housing
units on land not owned by the hospitals and out
side the City's jurisdiction.
While Stanford is committed to encouraging
and offering transportation alternatives for its

employees in order to reduce road congestion.

the University is much more cautious about

agreeing to the City's housing requirements.
"The expectations that the hospital

would pay for a very large number for poten-

tial housing units is really completely

unprecedented in Palo Alto," said Executive

Director for Public Affairs Shelley llebert

"No other [non-commercial] employer has

ever been asked to do what has been

stated would be asked of the hospi
tal."

llebert said that the
hospitals' proposition to
afford its employees unlimit
ed rides via the Caltrain. at
no cost, sufficiently demon
strates commitment to the
project and to the needs of

CRIS BAUTISTA/ . ( l^
The Stanford Da.iy Nevertheless, the
University mav be

willing to make
some amends to ameliorate the housing issue.
"The hospitals are willing to discuss some level
of appropriate contribution towards affordable
housing needs through the negotiation of a devel
opment agreement." wrote Director of
Community Relations Jean McCown in an email
