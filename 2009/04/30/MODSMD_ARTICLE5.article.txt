Rice on Monday faced questions
from students regarding her role in
the Bush administration's approval
of waterboarding terror suspects,
denying both her personal authori
zation of the interrogation tech
niques as well as the qualification
of those techniques as torture.
"I didn't authorize anything."
Rice told a group of Roble students
in a conversation that surfaced on
You Tube Monday night. "I con
veyed the authorization of the
administration to the [CIA] that
they had policy authorization sub
ject to the Justice Department's
clearance."
The Associated Press (AP)
reported last week that following
Rice's nod of approval to then-CIA
Director George Tenet, the Justice
Department approved the use of
waterboarding in a top-secret Aug.
1, 2002 memo. That month, alleged
al-Qaida terrorist Abu Zubaydah
underwent waterboarding at least
83 times.
After 2005, the CIA voluntarily

crossed waterboarding off of its list
of interrogation techniques, accord
ing to the AP.
On Monday, Rice, who served as
National Security Advisor to the
President before being appointed
Secretary of State in 2(X)5. defended
the Bush administration's actions
against the label of torture, citing the
United Nations Convention against
Torture, which entered into force in
1987 and was signed bv the U.S. in
1988.
"The President instructed us that
nothing we would do would be out
side of our obligations — legal obli
gations— under the Convention
against Torture." Rice said. "So. by
definition, if it was authorized by the
President, it did not violate our obli
gations under the Convention
against Torture."
On Guantanamo Bay. Rice
denied the use of torture at the ter
rorist detention camp.
"We did not torture anyone."
she said. "The ICRC [International
Committee of the Red Cross] also
had access to Guantanamo, and
they made no allegations about
interrogations at Guantanamo."
