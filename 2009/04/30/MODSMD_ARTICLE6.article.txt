## Admits evaluate financial aid Univ. reaffirms committment to lowincome families 
### MOLLY SPAETH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Even in poor economic times, the
Office of Financial Aid has
increased its aid budget and reaf
firmed its commitment to low
income families. And with that sup
port. many admits to the Class of
2013 will likely have an easier time
saying yes to Stanford by tomor
row's reply deadline.
According to Director of
Financial Aid Karen Cooper, the
office has cut 15 percent of its oper
ating costs, but increased the size of
its scholarship budget from last
year's $102 million to $110 million
this year. She emphasized that her
office prioritized giving financial aid
to families based on need and that
the financial cutbacks would not
affect students directly.
"We have been sticking very
closely to our policies." Cooper said.
"[Stanford has been) principled and
equitable in distributing those funds
across students who really need it
first."
Cooper noted that although they
have been doing what they can to
accommodate recent changes in
parental incomes, there is still an
income bracket that will bear a larg
er portion of the tuition burden.
"Families making more than
$200,000 per year they're looking
at being asked to pay most, if not all.
of the costs at a place like Stanford."
Cooper said. "Their [alternative]
choice is to go to a public institution
in their home state, where tuition is
half as much. Those families are

going to have to make some difficult
choices."
However, for many Class of 2013
admits who fall below the $2(M).(XH)
income bracket. Stanford's commit
ment to need-based financial aid has
actually made it more economically
feasible to attend Stanford than a
public school.
Shilpa Apte '13. a prospective
freshman (Pro Fro) from Fargo.
N.D.. was very pleased with her
financial aid package from Stanford.
"It was the best one by far." Apte
said. "Its cheaper for me to go to
Stanford than the University of
Minnesota. I don't know how that
happened."
Apte was particularly pleased
with her award because, unlike a
large portion of the population, her
parents' income actually increased
from the time she sent in her finan
cial aid form.
"My parent's income went up sig
nificantly since December and they
still gave us the same aid package."
Apte said.
Although Apte said her experi
ence with the whole financial aid
process was relatively easy, for oth
ers the process was more difficult.
Brianne Huntsman '13, a Pro Fro
from I'tah.said that a lack of knowl
edge on the part of her high school
counselors made the application and
admission process considerably
harder.
"My [high school] counselors
didn't know what the Common
Application or the [financial aid]
Profile was." Huntsman said. "I sat
in my counselor's offices from seven
in the morning until late after school
and 1 was crying a lot. Stanford was
really helpful because they sent me
an email saying exactly what 1 had
to do."
For Huntsman, her financial aid
package decided whether or not she
would be able to confirm her
acceptance. After attending an
Admit Weekend that made her fall
in love with Stanford, Huntsman
was excited when she received her
financial aid package three days
later.
"After coming to Admit
Weekend. 1 needed to come here,
but I was so scared of financial aid,"
Huntsman said. "Not that my par
ents would have been able to afford
Stanford as a whole anyways, but
my parents kind of just said we hon
estly do not have the money. [The
financial aid] pretty much decided it
for me."
Although for some students the
financial aid package made the
Stanford education affordable.
Cooper has noticed the impact the
economic recession has had on W2
forms, one of the main applications
required in applying for financial aid.

"We're noting that many of 11he
W2's] have a notice of layoff or a
note of reduced earnings," she said.
"This is going to he a tough year for
our families."
Although Cooper quelled
rumors that there may be plans to
scale down financial aid. she did
sympathize with families wrestling
with the decision of investing in a
Stanford education in the midst of
an uncertain job market.
"It is a really difficult time to be
making that commitment." Cooper
said.
