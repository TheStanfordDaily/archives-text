## All Dollie-d Up and Ready to Go 
### MOLLY SPAETH 
-w" l -yhile still a little out of
% / breath from practice, the
% /% / five new baby Dollies
%/ %/ enthusiastically shuffled
T out of the Dollie room in
the Band Shak for an interview with I"he
Daily.
Shea Ritchie '12. Paula Markey '10,
Nia-Amina Minor '12. Kim Sou/a '11 and
Elise Birkhofer '12 — clad in leotards,
sweatpants. T-shirts and tights — quickly
engaged in a lively discussion about where
to sit for the interview.
"Should we go outside?"
"No. it will be too cold."
"Where are my shoes?!"
"Well, we can't go back in the Dollie
room — it's too hot."
"Let's just go over here!"
Watching these five girls interact and
finish each other's sentences, it's hard to
believe that they were brought together
only a few short weeks ago when they
were selected by the Band as Dollies for
the 2009-2010 school year.
Although the Dollie room is tucked
away in the very back corner of the Band
Shak. the energy radiating from the new
baby Dollies turned the gray corridor into
a bright hallway — filled with bubbly chat
ter about dresses, dancing and perhaps
their most exciting event of all:
DollieSpiash. happening tomorrow in
White Plaza at noon.
"It's going to be soooo fun!" Minor
exclaimed.
"We want our DollieSpiash to be awe
some," Birkhofer added.
And awesome it must be. Hie baby
Dollies have been practicing five to seven
days a week for two hours a day since they
were chosen, scrambling to learn and cre
ate their dances. The baby Dollies have
been practicing with their "grandma"
Dollies from 2007-2008, learning the
dances from years past and eager to pick
up any wisdom that their new Dollie fami
ly may have to offer.
Although the girls have an incredible
support network, soon they will be arrang
ing everything on their own.
"Our mom Dollies and grandma
Dollies are very much informational
sources." Birkhofer explained. "As soon as
we learn the dances from the grandma
Dollies, we are all running it together."
The girls have already arranged a sys
tem of organization: Ritchie does the
scheduling. Markey is in charge of the
finances and Birkhofer is in charge of
dress. Sou/a. the girls laughingly noted, is
in charge of the high kicks.
"We've all kind of fit into our positions
in the group." Ritchie said.
Dancing has always been a part of each
of the baby Dollies' lives. All of them have
had experience in ballet and jazz, and
Souza and Ritchie even had dreams of
going professional before coming to
Stanford.
"I've been dancing since I was really lit
tle," Souza said.'M quit for a while because
I didn't like tights, and then I started again
when I was eight or nine. I was thinking
about deferring the summer before my
senior year, before I decided that 1 wasn't
going to do ballet professionally."
Even if not all the girls dreamed of
dancing professionally, they did all share
one common goal: becoming a Stanford
Dollie.
"1 decided I wanted to be a Dollie
before I got into Stanford," Ritchie said. "I
went to a UCLA/Stanford game and saw
the Dollies and decided I should go to
Stanford. So. I guess it worked out for
me!"
Though the girls' current enthusiasm
seems unbeatable, they did admit that the
audition process was a little intimidating.
The girls recalled their experiences from

Profiles by VINEET SINGAL/The Stanford Daily

the second round of the audition process
when they were asked to perform a dance
of their own choreography in front of the
whole Band.
"1 thought it was hard dancing in
gloves." Markev recalled. "We had learned
all of the dances and then, all of a sudden,
they were like,'put on gloves.'"
Ritchie agreed.
"The first time in front of the Band is a
little bit intimidating, especially because
they're yelling at and for you." she added.
But once they were in. they were in. In
true LSJIJMB fashion, the Band has
thrown their love and admiration at the
new baby Dollies. Minor recalled how she
did not have time to check her Facebook
page for two days after her Dollie roll-out.
and when she finally did log in. she had
received 53 friend requests from Band
members.
"It's so cool, because when I'm biking
around all. the Band members say hi,"
Sou/a said. "1 just assume they're in the
Band — I don't actually know who they
are."
The girls recalled that one of their
favorite parts of being baby Dollies thus
far has been Tree Week, when all the
potential Tree candidates showered them
with presents in hopes of winning their
approval and affection. The gifts included
purses, food, robes, blankets, manicures
and pedicures. However, with Tree Week
now behind them, the girls are most look
ing forward to DollieSplash, when they
will make their debut as the 2009-2010
Stanford Dollies.
"It's a day that is actually all about us,"
Sou/a said. "Usually we're at band rallies
or football games or something that it
doesn't really matter, but at DollieSplash,
it's all about the Dollies."
"It's also kind of baptismal how we're
put into a fountain," she joked.
But for the current Stanford Dollies,
this year's DollieSplash will be bitter
sweet. as they relinquish their current role
in the Band and welcome the new crop of
Dollies.
Reflecting on her DollieSplash almost
one year ago. Taylor Phillips '10 recalled
how exhausting and rewarding the event
was.
"It's one of the few most intense bouts
of dancing a Dollie ever does during her
year." she described. "But having all of my
friends come out and watch and celebrate
with me made it one of the most exciting
days I've ever had as a Dollie. despite the
heat and fatigue."
Alison Romer'l 1. also a current Dollie.
had some advice for the incoming babies.
"Enjoy every moment of being a
Dollie."she said."lt's a wild and crazy ride,
but so much fun! It's been one of the best
experiences of my life."
The transition at DollieSplash affects
all members of the Band.
"DollieSplash is kind of like a changing
of the guard." said Tim Haefele '11, the
incoming assistant manager of the Band
and also the new "Dollie Daddy." "It's
both sad to see the past group leave the
Band, but it's also really exciting to see the
new group perform for the first time."
Peter McDonald '11. public relations
representative for the Band, drew a com
parison between DollieSplash and rebirth.
"It's fitting that DollieSplash this year
is on May Day because, like spring, it is a
beautiful representation of the cycle of
life," he said.
For the new baby Dollies, the best real
ly is yet to come. However, when asked
what ihey think may be the best part of liv
ing the Dollie life, all five girls stopped
their chattering to come to an unanimous,
conclusive consensus:
"Dresses!"

favorite parts of being baby Dollies thus
far has been Tree Week, when all the
potential Tree candidates showered them
with presents in hopes of winning their
approval and affection. The gifts included
purses, food, robes, blankets, manicures
and pedicures. However, with Tree Week
now behind them, the girls are most look
ing forward to DollieSplash, when they
will make their debut as the 2009-2010
Stanford Dollies.
"It's a day that is actually all about us,"
Sou/a said. "Usually we're at band rallies
or football games or something that it
doesn't really matter, but at DollieSplash,
it's all about the Dollies."
"It's also kind of baptismal how we're
put into a fountain," she joked.
But for the current Stanford Dollies,
this year's DollieSplash will be bitter
sweet. as they relinquish their current role
in the Band and welcome the new crop of
Dollies.
Reflecting on her DollieSplash almost
one year ago. Taylor Phillips '10 recalled
how exhausting and rewarding the event
was.
"It's one of the few most intense bouts
of dancing a Dollie ever does during her
year." she described. "But having all of my
friends come out and watch and celebrate
with me made it one of the most exciting
days I've ever had as a Dollie. despite the
heat and fatigue."
Alison Romer'l 1. also a current Dollie.
had some advice for the incoming babies.
"Enjoy every moment of being a
Dollie."she said."lt's a wild and crazy ride,
but so much fun! It's been one of the best
experiences of my life."
The transition at DollieSplash affects
all members of the Band.
"DollieSplash is kind of like a changing
of the guard." said Tim Haefele '11, the
incoming assistant manager of the Band
and also the new "Dollie Daddy." "It's
both sad to see the past group leave the
Band, but it's also really exciting to see the
new group perform for the first time."
Peter McDonald '11. public relations
representative for the Band, drew a com
parison between DollieSplash and rebirth.
"It's fitting that DollieSplash this year
is on May Day because, like spring, it is a
beautiful representation of the cycle of
life," he said.
For the new baby Dollies, the best real
ly is yet to come. However, when asked
what ihey think may be the best part of liv
ing the Dollie life, all five girls stopped
their chattering to come to an unanimous,
conclusive consensus:
"Dresses!"

PIQURE PERFECT- The five new Dollies strike one of their signature
poses. They will be officially inagurated a! DollieSplash on Friday.
-w" l -yhile still a little out of
% / breath from practice, the
% /% / five new baby Dollies
%/ %/ enthusiastically shuffled
T out of the Dollie room in
the Band Shak for an interview with I"he
Daily.
Shea Ritchie '12. Paula Markey '10,
Nia-Amina Minor '12. Kim Sou/a '11 and
Elise Birkhofer '12 — clad in leotards,
sweatpants. T-shirts and tights — quickly
engaged in a lively discussion about where
to sit for the interview.
"Should we go outside?"
"No. it will be too cold."
"Where are my shoes?!"
"Well, we can't go back in the Dollie
room — it's too hot."
"Let's just go over here!"
Watching these five girls interact and
finish each other's sentences, it's hard to
believe that they were brought together
only a few short weeks ago when they
were selected by the Band as Dollies for
the 2009-2010 school year.
Although the Dollie room is tucked
away in the very back corner of the Band
Shak. the energy radiating from the new
baby Dollies turned the gray corridor into
a bright hallway — filled with bubbly chat
ter about dresses, dancing and perhaps
their most exciting event of all:
DollieSpiash. happening tomorrow in
White Plaza at noon.
"It's going to be soooo fun!" Minor
exclaimed.
"We want our DollieSpiash to be awe
some," Birkhofer added.
And awesome it must be. Hie baby
Dollies have been practicing five to seven
days a week for two hours a day since they
were chosen, scrambling to learn and cre
ate their dances. The baby Dollies have
been practicing with their "grandma"
Dollies from 2007-2008, learning the
dances from years past and eager to pick
up any wisdom that their new Dollie fami
ly may have to offer.
Although the girls have an incredible
support network, soon they will be arrang
ing everything on their own.
"Our mom Dollies and grandma
Dollies are very much informational
sources." Birkhofer explained. "As soon as
we learn the dances from the grandma
Dollies, we are all running it together."
The girls have already arranged a sys
tem of organization: Ritchie does the
scheduling. Markey is in charge of the
finances and Birkhofer is in charge of
dress. Sou/a. the girls laughingly noted, is
in charge of the high kicks.
"We've all kind of fit into our positions
in the group." Ritchie said.
Dancing has always been a part of each
of the baby Dollies' lives. All of them have
had experience in ballet and jazz, and
Souza and Ritchie even had dreams of
going professional before coming to
Stanford.
"I've been dancing since I was really lit
tle," Souza said.'M quit for a while because
I didn't like tights, and then I started again
when I was eight or nine. I was thinking
about deferring the summer before my
senior year, before I decided that 1 wasn't
going to do ballet professionally."
Even if not all the girls dreamed of
dancing professionally, they did all share
one common goal: becoming a Stanford
Dollie.
"1 decided I wanted to be a Dollie
before I got into Stanford," Ritchie said. "I
went to a UCLA/Stanford game and saw
the Dollies and decided I should go to
Stanford. So. I guess it worked out for
me!"
Though the girls' current enthusiasm
seems unbeatable, they did admit that the
audition process was a little intimidating.
The girls recalled their experiences from

Profiles by VINEET SINGAL/The Stanford Daily

the second round of the audition process
when they were asked to perform a dance
of their own choreography in front of the
whole Band.
"1 thought it was hard dancing in
gloves." Markev recalled. "We had learned
all of the dances and then, all of a sudden,
they were like,'put on gloves.'"
Ritchie agreed.
"The first time in front of the Band is a
little bit intimidating, especially because
they're yelling at and for you." she added.
But once they were in. they were in. In
true LSJIJMB fashion, the Band has
thrown their love and admiration at the
new baby Dollies. Minor recalled how she
did not have time to check her Facebook
page for two days after her Dollie roll-out.
and when she finally did log in. she had
received 53 friend requests from Band
members.
"It's so cool, because when I'm biking
around all. the Band members say hi,"
Sou/a said. "1 just assume they're in the
Band — I don't actually know who they
are."
The girls recalled that one of their
favorite parts of being baby Dollies thus
far has been Tree Week, when all the
potential Tree candidates showered them
with presents in hopes of winning their
approval and affection. The gifts included
purses, food, robes, blankets, manicures
and pedicures. However, with Tree Week
