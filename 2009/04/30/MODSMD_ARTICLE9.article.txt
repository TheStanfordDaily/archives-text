## EDITORIAL Community centers deserve support amidst budget cuts 
### 
The $3 million in budget cuts to the stu
dent affairs division have drawn criti
cism for a lack of transparency and stu
dent input in the process, especially with re
gard to Stanford's six community centers.
I his is quickly becoming a familiar refrain,
as economic pressures force tough decisions
and those affected push back.
While acknowledging that this is a diffi
cult and complex process, the editorial board
commends Stanford students for taking con
structive action to make their opinions
known to the administration,and urging the
office of the Vice Provost of Student Affairs
to continue consideration of student con
cerns when dealing with budget cuts.
Despite the unpleasantness of all this, the
outpour of student activism has been im
pressive and welcome. Last Friday's rally by
the ( oncerned Students for Community
Centers (CSCC), an op-ed in the Daily and
a recent email petition all showcase the pas
sion students have tor the campus commu
nity centers and serve as a reminder of their
value. lor some students, they are resources
of encouragement to stay in school, and for
others they provide a sense of community
beyond their dorms and other affiliations.
There are those who further feel the centers
strengthen their happiness and mental
health.
Whatever the reasons, much of the Stan
lord community agrees that community cen
ters provide an important service to the cam
pus. Yet. as the CSCC email campaign notes,
the staff of the six community centers com
prises only six percent of the VPSA budget
but is 25 percent of the staff impacted by
the budget cuts. This lopsided number ap
pears to illustrate that the administration
does not see community centers as vital as
students do. and for this reason it is impor
tant that student voices are a part of the de
cision-making process.
It has been a welcome sight to see stu
dents joining together to make their voices

heard. ITiis activism underscores that stu
dents have not been full partners in the
budget cut process. Rallying and petitions
are what we resort to when a seat at the table
is not forthcoming.
To his credit. Vice Provost Greg Board
man has met with the CSCC and there are
representatives of the community centers
who feel happy with the manner in which the
process was conducted. It is unfair to unilat
erally condemn the administration.especial
ly when they have made efforts to address
student concerns in a number of these cases.
Nonetheless, the CSCC is still hoping for
greater transparency. As well as calling for
the restoration of community center staff to
full-time positions, the CSCC's email also
asks that detailed information on VPSA
budget cuts be made available to the student
body. Without knowing the details of what
that would entail, the editorial board feels
that such a step would go a long way toward
mitigating some of the tension and disap
pointment of these difficult cuts.
Mother Teresa once said. "Honesty and
transparency make you vulnerable. Be hon
est and transparent anyway." Increasing the
transparency of the budget process would
likely open up the administration to further
criticism. Even so, it is the right thing to do.
In the meantime,the editorial board encour
ages students to continue voicing their opin
ions through productive channels.

Correction

Yesterday's editorial. "Progress in grad.
faculty diversity a positive sign," said that
African-American students comprised 31
percent of the graduate student population.
African-Americans actually comprised 3.1
percent in 2008. according to the report by
the Vice Provost's Office for Graduate Edu
cation. The editorial hoard apologizes for
the mistake.
