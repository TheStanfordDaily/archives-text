# Staceyann Chin: Poetry and "Paradise"
## 
### 
During Admit Weekend, I entered the Spoken
Word Collective show featuring Staceyann
Chin believing that I knew what to expect. I
had watched every video of her on You Tube, visited her
personal Web site and read her Wikipedia site. I was
ready for spoken word poetry that would be loud,
funny and full of an interesting brand of activist fury.
What I got was something that was much softer and
much more intimate.
The show was in Cubberley Auditorium, but only
the front half was filled. It began with Lyla Johnston of
the Stanford Spoken Word Collective DJ-ing an amaz
ing set that had people dancing in the lobby as well as
in their seats. Staceyann Chin was sitting in the front
during all of this, and I wondered what must have been
going through her mind then. After Lyla finished,
Ariella Tai, a senior in the Collective delivered her own
poem. At one point during her delivery, Ariella
removed her lapel mic, which 1 believe set the tone for
how the rest of the night was to go. It became a show
that was more about sharing and less about perform
ing.
When StaceyAnn took the stage, 1 was elated but
cautious. 1 didn't know how a small, quiet Stanford
audience would handle all the energy that I had seen
on You Tube or all the talk about vaginas, but once
Chin began speaking, I knew 1 had nothing to worry
about. She knew how to read her crowd. Some of her

poems, which were normally yelled, were whispered on
that night. Poems that had been fast were slowed down
and finessed.
Chin also spent quite a bit of time reading to us
from her newly released book, The Other Side of
Paradise, a heart-wrenching memoir that tells the tale
of Chin's very difficult childhood. She made the audi
ence a part of her story, so that we laughed with her,
cried with her and felt as though we might actually
know everything there is to know about a vagina — in
a very empowering way.
Later, Chin gave a question-and-answer session
that really focused on aspects of her book that had
touched audience members. She was honest with us,
telling us about why she'd left her hometown in
Jamaica, and telling us about activist issues of the
LGBT community towards Jamaica that she didn't
agree with. One person asked Chin how she felt about
spoken word poetry now, and Chin responded that it
was good for her when she was younger and needed a
rant, but that these days she is ready for more nuanced
work.
And I think that work is what the Stanford audi
ence got a taste of; she was candid, and we were open.
The experience was a very lovely one.
