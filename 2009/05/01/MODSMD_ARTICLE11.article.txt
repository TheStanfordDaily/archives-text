# Oh, ProFros...
## 
### 
As most of you reading this are probably aware, last weekend was Admit
Weekend. That's right. Admit. Weekend. You know what that means...
ProFros! Everyone's favorite prospective freshmen storm campus hoping to
test the waters at this particular university before they make their decision to
attend. And in Stanford's case, the water-testing analogy is pretty true to life. The
University puts a surprising amount of effort into encouraging its visitors to
jump in the fountains. And off they go! Hundreds of high school seniors splash
around trying to get a sense if this is what they'd like in a college environment. Is
the water too cold? Is it too hot? Does it have the tannic taste of academia? Maybe
it tastes too much like athlete sweat. Maybe it doesn't have a high enough alcohol
content. Who knows? In truth, every single one of the ProFros receives a slightly
different taste of the Stanford experience, and whether they like it or not is sim
ply a matter of individual opinion.
There are, however, certain universal traits of a Pro Fro. For one, almost all of
them start on the same page. They show up with sleeping bags and backpacks full
of their most presentable underwear. They know that this lanyard around their
neck is important, but also that it's probably uncool. More than anything, they're
excited and tired and nervous and they'd follow that flag-waving UoHo into the
depths of the abyss if that were where he was leading. It's a pretty even playing
field. Then, they arrive at their assigned residence, where they are greeted by the
entire dorm. It's typically quite the spectacle. There arc banners and confetti and
silly string everywhere. Music is playing and people are dancing. This year, I saw
a bunch of shirtless guys wearing sunglasses act as part of a welcoming commit
tee, no doubt demonstrating Stanford's "shirt-optional" policy.
And right at that moment, the Pro Fro population starts to diverge and spe
cialize, demonstrating a large variety of different approaches to this whole "Admit
Weekend" situation. Many react as I would react in the face of such welcoming
revelry and blatant nipple-displays: they're shy. There are a lot of polite grins,
head nods and waves. The general sentiment seems to be, "Oh, you didn't have to
go through all the trouble. It doesn't have to be such a big deal." For others, how
ever, this kind of welcome clearly confirms their longstanding suspicions that
they actually ARE a big deal. You can see it. Their faces light up as they think, "Oh
my God, I knew it."
From there on, it's just more individuation. There are always those East
Coasters who flew in this morning and are so sleep-deprived and jet-lagged that
they fall into a coma around 10:30 p.m. and cannot be roused. Then there are
those who stay up all night in the lounge, comparing notes about test scores and
checking to see if high school social labels, like "nerd," still apply. The statement
"everyone at Stanford is kind of a nerd," will undoubtedly be thrown around at
some point, and that negation of identity will inevitably upset and frighten at
least half of the people in the room. There are the ProFros who attend every sin
gle event on their schedules and there are those who attend none of them. There
are the ProFros who wander aimlessly all over campus with apparently no knowl
edge of how to read a map. This is actually, again, sort of a universal trait of
ProFros. Apparently Stanford does not require its admits to have any understand
ing of North, South, or the phrase "You Arc Here."
By far the most interesting part of Pro Fro behavior, at least to me, is their
attempts at romantic interactions. I think there is something distinctly fascinat
ing about high school students' attempts to make out with strangers on weekend
trips. The media definitely encourages it. College is where you hook up, man. It's
crazy town. But also there's that thing about being away from your parents and
away from your normal peer group. These are NEW people, and their newness
means that they have sex potential. I mean, of course you can't make out with
Todd from back home. You know his whole social group. It wouldn't work out.
But Jake from Michigan? He might be totally into you. You should go for it. It's
very animalistic. And what amazes me is that sometimes it actually happens.
Every year you hear stories about ProFros hooking up with each other. Amazing.
I don't really understand the appeal of making out with someone for a weekend
and then chatting with them on instant messenger for the rest of the summer
about whether or not you're going to bring a mini-fridge. But then, I didn't attend
my own Admit Weekend, so maybe I don't understand the magic.
