# Intermission talks to Cloud Cult's Shawn Neary
## 
### 
As far as Stanford is concerned, sustainabili
ty and the environment are both very
important issues. For the band Cloud Cult,
the environment is of the utmost importance and
being environmentally responsible shapes much of
what they do. Cloud Cult has released ten albums
and has been denominated "absolute genius" by
"Pitchfork." Their album They Live On The Sun
was one of the most critically acclaimed of the year
and was ranked along the likes of Modest Mouse
and Radiohead. Their most recent album, Feel
Good Ghosts (Ten-Partying Through Tornadoes),
has also being garnering incredible reviews. Cloud
Cult recently performed at Coachella on the main
stage in the company of legends such as Paul
McCartney, The Cure, and Morrissey. Intermission
was lucky enough to receive a personal interview
with Cloud Cult bassist, Shawn Neary, and the
chance to chat with him about what the band is up
to.
intermission (i): You were formerly of (popular
indie band) Tapes-N-Tapcs. How did you wind up
in Cloud Cult?
Shawn Neary (SN): 1 was working in Minneapolis,
and got a call from a friend who books for Cloud
Cult telling me that they were looking for a new
bassist. He asked if I wanted to try and I mean,

Minowa (lead singer/visionary) and learned like

(i): How was Coachella, one of your first big music
festivals, this year?
SN: We went into that not really knowing what the
crowd was going to be like, and stuff like that. We
got too many groceries because we didn't know
things were going to be catered ... [laughs] You
know, we were so new to the whole big festival
thing. We drove from Michigan overnight, and I
only saw Beirut on Friday, and on Saturday 1 saw
M.I.A. for the first time. That was fucking sweet!
We saw Atmosphere from the top of our RV.
Sunday, we saw the Cure and My Bloody Valentine.
Incredible.
(i): Cloud Cult's music has been reviewed with the
best, like Modest Mouse, The Flaming Lips, and
Radiohead. Who would you say Cloud Cult draws
inspiration from?
SN: Well, one of Craig's favorite bands is the Cure.
But I mean, the Flaming Lips isn't too far off as far
as any comparison. What Craig is writing about
definitely shows some Lips. We also are hearing
that we sound a bit like U2, which I can see in a few
songs. I mean, it's pretty cool to hear we sound like
