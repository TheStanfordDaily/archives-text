# Intermission talks to Cloud Cult's Shawn Neary
## 
### 
As far as Stanford is concerned, sustainabili
ty and the environment are both very
important issues. For the band Cloud Cult,
the environment is of the utmost importance and
being environmentally responsible shapes much of
what they do. Cloud Cult has released ten albums
and has been denominated "absolute genius" by
"Pitchfork." Their album They Live On The Sun
was one of the most critically acclaimed of the year
and was ranked along the likes of Modest Mouse
and Radiohead. Their most recent album, Feel
Good Ghosts (Ten-Partying Through Tornadoes),
has also being garnering incredible reviews. Cloud
Cult recently performed at Coachella on the main
stage in the company of legends such as Paul
McCartney, The Cure, and Morrissey. Intermission
was lucky enough to receive a personal interview
with Cloud Cult bassist, Shawn Neary, and the
chance to chat with him about what the band is up
to.
intermission (i): You were formerly of (popular
indie band) Tapes-N-Tapcs. How did you wind up
in Cloud Cult?
Shawn Neary (SN): 1 was working in Minneapolis,
and got a call from a friend who books for Cloud
Cult telling me that they were looking for a new
bassist. He asked if I wanted to try and I mean,

obviously... I tried out the part with Craig
Minowa (lead singer/visionary) and learned like
thirty new songs. My first show was in September
2007, and it has just been crazy since then,
(i): How was Coachella, one of your first big music
festivals, this year?
SN: We went into that not really knowing what the
crowd was going to be like, and stuff like that. We
got too many groceries because we didn't know
things were going to be catered ... [laughs] You
know, we were so new to the whole big festival
thing. We drove from Michigan overnight, and I
only saw Beirut on Friday, and on Saturday 1 saw
M.I.A. for the first time. That was fucking sweet!
We saw Atmosphere from the top of our RV.
Sunday, we saw the Cure and My Bloody Valentine.
Incredible.
(i): Cloud Cult's music has been reviewed with the
best, like Modest Mouse, The Flaming Lips, and
Radiohead. Who would you say Cloud Cult draws
inspiration from?
SN: Well, one of Craig's favorite bands is the Cure.
But I mean, the Flaming Lips isn't too far off as far
as any comparison. What Craig is writing about
definitely shows some Lips. We also are hearing
that we sound a bit like U2, which I can see in a few
songs. I mean, it's pretty cool to hear we sound like

those guys.
(i): Is it true that Feel Good Ghosts (Tea-Partying Through Tornadoes) is the
last Cloud Cult album?
SN: That's actually not true. 1 mean, Craig hinted at that but there is talk of
another album down the road. We are going to slow down for a little bit. We
are touring for the film that we released this April. We are going to take a lot
of time to relax and spend some time focusing on other things. But it's not
the last — we just are going to slow down.
(i): Tell me about your label, Earthology Records.
SN: Craig, like eight years back, recorded his first album and he looked
around for a label that would release it in a way that he felt comfortable
with. They all put out so many toxins and pollutants. So he started his own
record label. It basically only puts out Cloud Cult records and it's been real
ly environmentally savvy. The only thing we can't solve is the plastic disc.
Thankfully, there is digital downloads. The sleeves we use are all recyclable
paper, and we use soy ink for the printing. We do the best we can to cut out
as many pollutants as possible, and minimize our carbon footprint. For any
environmental damage that is done, we plant a tree. It's important to us.
(i): We at Intermission are always looking for new bands to listen to. Are
there any bands out there that you are really getting into?
SN: Tonight I'm going to go see Horse Feathers. I really, really love that
band. There are some bands here [in Minneapolis]. There is this band Best
Friends Forever, you have to check them out. They are just ridiculous. My
friend just introduced me to T-Rex. I guess better late than never. I'm also
revisiting My Bloody Valentine, after this incredible Coachclla performance.
Cloud Cult will be playing at the Independent in San Francisco on May 12.
