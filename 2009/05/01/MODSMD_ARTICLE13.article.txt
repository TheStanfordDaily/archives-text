# Mocha MADNESS
## 
### 
Those who know this Daily editor know well that I'm
loud and proud about being a coffee addict. The term
"coffee addict" might not be the best way to describe it,
though.
1 mean, I truly am addicted: two-plus cups each day, and
when 1 don't have at least one of those by 5 p.m. on a given
day, I'll probably have a headache. However, I don't have a
particular affinity for straight-up coffee. Even with cream,
sugar and the intrinsic flavor that comes with good coffee, 1

can't possibly keep myself satisfied by just pouring another
cup from the pot.
So, I turn to espresso drinks — where the true artistry of
coffee comes into play. Give a barista some high-quality cof
fee beans, but it'll still take quite a bit of work to mix togeth
er the perfect drink. And for me, the drink of choice is mocha
— maybe white, maybe caramel, maybe even hazelnut.
And on a campus with four main coffee sources, there's
quite a bit of variety in the mocha experience.
CoHo
Small: $3 Medium: $3.50 Large: $4
I'm a regular at the CoHo for many reasons, not the least
of which is that they provide some high-quality drinks at the
center of campus. The CoHo mocha, while a little inconsis
tent in quality (you don't have to go all the time, like I do, to
know that it's really dependent on your barista), has enough
flavor and kick to keep you coming back for more.
The relatively reasonable price and ease of access may
have to do with it, but this is a perfectly suitable espresso
drink — one you won't be dissatisfied with on your way to
class or when spending some time on the CoHo couches.
That's not to say it can't be better; the CoHo surprisingly uses
Hershey's syrup for its chocolate, and one can only imagine
how much better it'd be if the mocha were made with some
rail cacao flavor.
A few tips for ordering this mocha: don't try the white —
it's made with Ghirardelli chocolate (a step up from
Hershey's), but far too strong; caramel is an excellent syrup
addition, and hazelnut is also nice. Oh, and ask for Juan to

make it.
Axe and Palm
Small: $3.10 Medium: $3.60 Large: $3.95
From the mocha with the best value for your time and
dollar to what is likely the worst value. Many things have been
said in the pages of The Daily about the quality of Axe and
Palm food some fair, and some maybe ignoring the delicious
ness of a few offerings — but it can't be denied: Axe and Palm
has the worst coffee. Period.
This espresso drink lacks even a hint of espresso flavor,
tasting more like the watered-down hot chocolate you had at
far too many concession stands as a teen. The espresso kick
may come through in the end, making this a somewhat
acceptable option if it's late, the CoHo has closed and you're
desperate for caffeine — but really, don't skimp on flavor just
for the sake of using Cardinal dollars.
Of all the mochas tried, this is the only one 1 don't rec
ommend frying.
Moonbean's Coffee
Small: $3 Medium: $3.50 Large: $4
Surprisingly, Moonbean's mocha is actually cheaper than
that at Axe and Palm (except for the large, but that's a minor
five cents). And really, it's better for many more reasons than
that. This one, like the CoHo, has actual chocolate flavor.
