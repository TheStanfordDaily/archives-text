# "The Namesake:" What's really in a name?
## 
### 
There are a variety of reasons I could tout Jhumpa
Lahiri's The Namesake. It has awarded the Pulitzer
prize, for one, and was a New York Times Bestseller for

many weeks ... except those are exactly the
sorts of things that usually warn me away from
a book. I could gush about the depiction of ex
pat Bengalis-in-America, or the struggles of
third-culture kids, or how marvelously Lahiri
immerses you in this confusing world.
These were not my particular draw, either,
however. I originally picked up the novel
because I had fond memories of her short
story collection Interpreter of Maladies that I
read in a high school English class, and the quip
on the back said that the main character's name
was Gogol. Okay, I thought. I like the cover art,
whatever. Right?
The book was in fact incredibly difficult
for me to get into. In part this was because my
personal life was, shall we say, going through a
rough phase, and the growing pains of a

Bengali-American boy in a novel were not exactly the sort of
material I looked to for relief. But when I finally bent my nose
back into the pages, parallels between the problems of Gogol's
youth and my own screamed at me.
Indeed, thousands — millions? — of American children
and adolescents face similar difficulties; we're a nation of
immigrants, even if we may have settled here however many
generations ago. Where to begin? One of the main "discussion
points," for lack of a better term, in the book is the sort of
aggregate surrogate family the Bengali form to replace the
family network they had been used to in their homeland and
help carry forward traditions and culture in an alien society.
America? Society? We're a society of nuclear families, one
of our most unifying holidays is Black Friday, and our most
identifying ethnic food is probably still Coca-Cola. At times I
feel more German than American, despite never having set
foot anywhere on the European continent. Because, after all,

what the is an American?
Identity crisis is what The Namesake is all about, though,
and as the title suggests, the protagonist's name carries a heavy
role in the talc. A series of communication difficulties and cul
tural barriers (such as a distinction between "given" and "pet"
names) land the newborn Bengali-American child with a trag
ic Russian author's surname, Gogol, as his given name.
I could think of a worse fate in a place where baby name
books are common fodder for parents-to-be to study. There
are some particularly amusing innovations. Supposedly one
recently popular girl's name was Nevaeh — heaven spelled
backwards. Regardless, Gogol's lack of a "good name" in
Bengali tradition compounds with adolescent insecurity as he
realizes that his name both sounds "weird" and isn't even a

"real" Indian name.
The breaking point for Gogol comes when, as a high
schooler, he attends a college party with a few of his friends,
flirts with a girl, calls himself Nikhil, and ends up losing his
virginity. This apparently positive outcome provides the moti
vation for him to officially change his name before taking off
for Yale. Much of his time is colored by confusion over his
name — his parents interacting with his roommates, for
example, or hesitancy to bring his girlfriend to his parents'
home, "where he is still Gogol."
I have perhaps experienced this sort of confusion more
than most. Arriving at Stanford in the wake of Hurricane
Katrina (my "given name") and carrying over a high school
nickname compounded in a way such that I often don't even
respond to my "proper" name. Thus the idea of "good" and
"pet" names naturally intrigues me, as I am drawn to the writ
ing profession and its history of pen names. Many of our cher
ished Dead White Men, for example, are remembered by
names they weren't born into.
What, after all, is a "real" name? Many cultures have a long
history of new names alongside life's milestones as, perhaps,
Skillful Bear Hunter becomes Three-Limbed Half-Face. And of
course, we have our own tradition of a name-changing com
ing-of-age ceremony: weddings.
In summary, it amuses me when Facebook berates us to
only use our "true" name, as the internet profligates the twin
antithesis to this with anonymity and security problems
abounding everywhere. And it frustrates me that names, num
bers, and their specters are stuck on us as if this really were
1984.
I mean, our dog has an RFID tag embedded in him. To
me, that screams, "this product is being tested on animals, get
ready humans."
