# Sex in the time of swine flu
## 
### 
What is with all of this swine flu madness? How is a gal sup
posed to find her next sexual conquest when everyone is so
nervous about some kind of pig disease?
Roxy knows that something is definitely wrong when the only dis
ease — STD or otherwise — that she has to worry about is the swine
flu. Things on campus definitely heated up even more when our very
own Provost John Etchemendy announced that Stanford is already

working on a massive contingency plan in the case of an
outbreak on campus — which might include sending
all of us home! A

As I fondled with the idea of school being can
celed and being sent back home (a girl can dream,
right?) it suddenly hit me: How am I supposed to
get my sex on at Stanford if I'm not even at

create an emergency sex checklist so that we all
can have our priorities in order in case of an
outbreak.

1. Pack up your essentials!
Don't worry about clothes or other such petty
belongings, all you need here is plenty of lube and

condoms. It wouldn't hurt to throw in some Endßac spray as
well.
2. Gather all the hot and healthy!

Before things become so crazy that the University has to send home all
of the students, you would be well-advised to quarantine yourself with
all the attractive people you can imagine. In Roxy's case, I'm going to
bring my favorite man candies with me for a no-holds-barred "slum
ber" party. Some of my favorites include some football players, swim
mers, hot professors (tenure only), TAs and maybe a beefy Phi Psi.
Only the strong and hunky here — so if you're sick and got the coughs,
you're welcome only at the hospital.

3. Sterilization party!
Before actually quarantining yourself, you have to make sure everyone
is clean and germ free. Roxy's suggestion? Pile everyone into a commu
nal show, lather, rinse and repeat! Of course, while you're all in the
shower together, you might as well enjoy yourself, right? Just make sure
your rubbers are waterproof

4. Lockdown!
Now that you're all squeaky clean, it's time to get
k dirty again. Choose your quarantine zone wisely

— Roxy's personal choice is Synergy (minus all
Ithe hippies). The house is gorgeous, the rooms
are huge, and it is quietly secluded on a hill
away from the heart of campus.

5. Bunker down like there's
NO TOMORROW.
Now that you're all set in your quarantine zone,
you might as well get reallv "cozy" with all of

qT" ' r v ' u ""6'" "-""7 "*«» «" "•
your new housemates. You never know when the
swine flu will hit pandemic proportions, so you might
as well enjoy life to the fullest while you can. Nothing

makes sex hotter than the highs of national hysteria and
end-of-the-world panic. If you thought make-up sex was
good, you have no idea what this will be like.

So now that you have Roxy's end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it sexper
tise, you are ready to handle any kind of disease outbreak — all you
have to do now is get on your back, point your toes to the heavens and
ride it out...
XOXO,
