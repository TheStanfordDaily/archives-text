## Wolverine: An action MOVIE WITH X-MEN MONIKER 
### 
These Intermission reviewers are huge X-Men fans, so it
pains us to have to say this: If you are looking for the
greatness that was "X-2," you'll have to look elsewhere.
"X-Men Origins: Wolverine" is action porn and blood
pumping at some points, but it's not epic on any proportions.
This doesn't mean you shouldn't see the movie — it just
means that you shouldn't go in with any expectations of char
acter or story development.

The movie begins at a furious pace. From the get-go we
see Logan (Hugh Jackman) as a child and therefore get a brief

glimpse of his home life. Logan's father is
killed by Victor Creed's father; Logan gets
revenge by murdering the elder Creed — who
in his dying breath admits that Logan was his

son as well. Logan and his newly discov-

ered half-brother Victor Creed
(Live Schreiber) go on the run

and participate in various wars
through the ages — the

American Civil War, World War I,
World War II and the Vietnam
War. After surviving a firing squad
during the Vietnam War, Logan
and Victor (later Sabertooth) are
recruited by William Stryker to join

a group of mutant fighters named
Team X. This is the first 15 minutes

of the film.
We are barely introduced to the members of Team X
before they engage in their first mission and Logan discovers
that the actions of this squad do not align with his own morals
— Team X is in Nigeria, about to kill a group of innocents,
when Logan stops and walks away. Therefore none of the char-

acters are that well-developed;
even cult fan-favorite
"Deadpool," played by funny
man Uyan Reynolds, is given min
imal screen time and thus no
chance to steal the show — which
definitely needed to be stolen at
times.

Logan then chooses a life of
seclusion* living with

love-interest Kayla Silverfox in the Canadian
Rockies while he works as a lumberjack. However,
when Victor returns for revenge and kills Kayla,

Logan is consumed by revenge and agrees to Stryker's
proposal to undergo the transformation into Weapon X —

thereby embedding adamantium into his skele
ton. The rest of the movie is Wolverine hell-bent
on revenge.
The transformation into Weapon X and the
I adamantium skeleton are two of Logan's defin-
I ing characteristics in the later X-Men films and
I comics. We remember him as the indestructi-
I ble and gruff, aloof man who heals unbeliev-
I ably fast and can destroy just about anything.
" You would think that given all this, the
Weapon X transformation that made him

indestructible would be epic. But it wasn't, and the scene was
in fact so short and underdeveloped that it was a serious let
down.
To us, Logan has always been one of the more tortured
and psychologically interesting characters of the X-Men crew.
His cold demeanor yet empathetic nature, and above all his
mysterious past, make him a fan-favorite. Therefore, we want-

Ed to see a movie that dealt with the core of Logan's character
and his origins. Considering the title, we don't think this was
an unreasonable expectation.
Yet this movie didn't tell me anything new about Logan; in
fact, despite being the main character that is constantly present
throughout all 107 minutes of this film, Logan manages to
come off one-sided and flat. This is probably because he never
undergoes any sort of character transition or development
throughout the entire movie — it seems like he was just born
the Logan we know. Even the man/animal identity crisis that
he undergoes is underdeveloped and barely memorable. In "X-
Men Origins: Wolverine," we learn about the things that hap
pened to Logan, but not really how he became Wolverine.
We wanted to love this film. We hoped that this new
"Origins" franchise would help reboot the series. Much to our
disappointment, all this movie offers is a ho-hum action out
ing that just happens to feature Wolverine and some X-Men
mutants thrown in.
