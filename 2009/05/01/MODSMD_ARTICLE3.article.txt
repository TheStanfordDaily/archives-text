North Korea

I've read some accounts of people who have gone to North Korea, and all of them
have said that it's like traveling back in time to the 1960s — North Korea has

remained essentially unchanged since then. Apparently,
going to North Korea is the next best thing to discover
ing a one-way, one-destination time machine.

Outer Space

This is definitely at the top of my
list, even though 1 listed it last.
Sure, it would set you back
$200,000, but if you were dying
tomorrow there'd be no good to
those savings away. As far as I
know, the only commercial space
flight is still with Virgin Galactic.
The trip is only three hours on a
private spacecraft, but it departs
from a remote section of the
Mojave Desert, and if you've got
the dough and the guts, you'll
also need several days at a resort
to prep for outer space. You'll
only be going 62 miles though —
just 62 miles vertically.

What would you do?

Personally, I would travel to all the places I've always wanted to go, but never got the chance,
especially those remote corners of the Earth that take lots of money and patience to reach. If you
might be quarantined anyway, why not just go to some of the world's most
remote travel destinations?

You've probably never heard of
this place. Which makes sense,
because it's the most remote
inhabited archipelago in the world
— population 271 at last count.
There are exactly 80 families on the
island and they share just seven
surnames: Glass, Green, Hagan,
Lavarello, Rcpetto, Rogers and
Swain. There is one visiting doctor
from South America and the first
television didn't arrive here until
2001. This group of volcanic
islands in the middle of the South
Atlantic Ocean is very difficult to
get to — one of the islands is even

called "Inaccessible Island." If
there was one place that
k would be safe from swine
R flu, this just might be it...

Antarctica and Falklan Islands

I, for one, have always wanted to go to Antarctica. As the only continent that I have never
stepped foot on before, Antarctica holds that certain unexplored, rugged appeal — not to
mention the gorgeous landscape, enormous ice mountains, icebergs and my favorite animal
next to pandas: penguins.
