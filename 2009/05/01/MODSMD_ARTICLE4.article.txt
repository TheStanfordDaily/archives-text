# Student film director Tim Gregory talks about "Political Animals"
## 
### 
On Wednesday afternoon, when I walked into The
Daily office, hollering staffers' names per usual to see
if anyone else was there, I suddenly found myself—
much to the my chagrin — in the middle of a film set. Turns
out the film set was part of a Stanford senior's feature film
project. After a wrap, I stepped aside to talk with director Tim
Gregory, a Stanford senior born and raised in Vienna, Austria,
on his feature film "Political Animals."
intermission (i): What's the title of the movie and what
inspired you to make it?
Tim Gregory (TG): The title of the movie is "Political
Animals" and it's my fourth movie at Stanford. Filming is hap
pening from April 5 to May 2, and we will wrap up in a few
days. I'm a political science major so 1 came up with the idea
based on a lot of the things I've seen repeatedly done here at
Stanford.
There are three main characters and each character is
based on tendencies I've seen in Stanford students. Tina is the
activist — she's very passionate about things, but doesn't
always think through the issues. She doesn't embrace complex
ities.
Sam is the investment banker. He's politically curious but
overwhelmed by all the different choices and groups. He finds
activism and politics to be intimidating, even though he's gen
uinely interested — so he goes into finance and becomes an
investment banker.
The third character is played by Daniel Torres-Rangel,
who graduated from Stanford in 2005. He works for a senate
campaign that he ideologically disagrees with. I've definitely
seen this in some Stanford students — compromising your
ideals to get the job.
i: Who are the actors in "Political Animals?"
TG: It's diverse. We have some Stanford student actors, some
professional actors. It's a diverse group. Tina is played by
Annamarie MacLeod, who is a semi-professional actress.
i: When do you plan to finish "Political Animals?"
TG: The final cut should be finished by the end of September.
We'll screen it at Stanford, then submit it to as many festivals
as we can, with Sundance and TrißeCa at the upper end. We'll
see what it gets into.
The last movie I filmed before this was about 45 minutes long,
so we sent it to some short film festivals. It was called "The
Strange Case" and it was about torture and the CIA. There
were a lot of Stanford students involved with that one, too.

i: Did you write the script for this
film?
TG: Yes, I did. I write all the scripts
that I direct — mainly because I'm
not in a position where I can pick
scripts. I really like coming up with
concepts and screenwriting. I gen
erally have all the ideas for the
movies I make. I came up with the
idea for this around November of
2007, and I was tired of making
short films — I was starting to feel
constrained by the length.
Of course, a few people helped me
with the storyline and such.
Professor Jim Fearon in the political
science department helped out with
coming up with the title and the
storyline. Professor Laura Whitman
from the French and Italian depart
ment also helped me a lot.

i: How did you manage the budget?
TG: We applied for two grants to cover most of the budget.
The total budget of this is about $10,000, which is ultra-low
budget for a film of its size. Most films of this length have
about a $200,000 budget, so $50,000 would be on the low side,
and $10,000 is considered really low.
But it can be done. The thing about "Political Animals" is
that there's no spectacular special effects or action scenes. It's
basically a drama, so there's a lot of character work. There are
no demanding locations either — it's mostly offices and apart
ments.
My previous movie, "The Strange Case," was a lot more
demanding in that respect. We needed a make-up expert, there
were some degrees of action scenes, and we even came up with
clever ways to fake torture. We had to stage a lot of action and
set pieces.
i: Isn't it difficult to make a good movie on such a small budg
et?

TG: It is a little bit, but I'm used to it — I've been making
movies with few resources for a while now. I'm used to doing
things on the cheap, and it's definitely possible. I think direc
tors can achieve a lot of things if they put their mind to it and
don't just take the first option that comes along.
For example, if someone offers you equipment for $3,000,
someone who has a large budget could just accept that offer.
But if you put more effort into it, networked and made friends
with the right people, you could potentially find something
that's half that price. If you do that for every item on your
budget, then you're in good shape.
i: Do you have any advice for students who are interested in
filmmaking or who want to try their hand at the craft?
TG: My advice would just be to get in touch with the film soci
ety at Stanford. Network with them and try to get crew posi
tions. My first years at Stanford, I worked crew on two movies.
The first gig was as a grip, so I moved things around, went to
get food, etc. On the other one, I was an assistant director.
Towards the end, I got to co-direct. Through working on set,
you get to learn who's good at what, so that when you have
your own idea for a movie, you'll know who to look towards or
what quality to look for.
i: What do you think of the film society at Stanford?
TG: I like the film society here, I think it's quite good. The
other college I was looking at when I was applying was
Cambridge, and I think their film society consisted of a few
guys who got together to watch a movie every week. But here,
we have decent equipment, workshops to get you familiar with
the equipment and a group of people who are always willing to
help each other out on their projects.
If there's one thing that can be improved, though, it would
be offering more money to students to make ambitious proj
ects. Stanford Film Festival is good, but it only shows mostly
really short movies. If the University just gave a bit more
incentive — right now, the greatest amount you can get in a
grant is $500, which covers about parking ticket costs for us —
I think students could be a lot more ambitious.
i: Who's your favorite director or directors?
TG: I think my favorite director would have to be Alejandro
Inarritu. He directed "Babel" and "21 Grams." Both are seri
ous, character-driven movies. My other favorite would be
Christopher Nolan, who directed "The Dark Knight" and
"Prestige." Both were big-budget blockbusters, but Nolan put
a lot of thought into plot and character, which is rare in these
big-budget action movies.
i: Favorite movies? Least favorite?
TG: [My Favorites are) "Babel,""The Dark Knight,""lndiana
Jones and the Last Crusade." I think "Slumdog Millionaire" is
very overrated; I dislike the way it's glorified so much. I also
hated "Quantum of Solace."
(i): What are your future plans after college?
TG: I don't really have any at this moment. I was wait-listed at
NYU Tisch Film School. I'll be around until I finish editing
this movie. After that, I could either go back to Europe or
search for a job in politics. Politics and film arc both open
options. I would much rather prefer a career in film, but I
think it's easier to get a paying job in politics.

activist — she's very passionate about things, but doesn't
always think through the issues. She doesn't embrace complex
ities.
Sam is the investment banker. He's politically curious but
overwhelmed by all the different choices and groups. He finds
activism and politics to be intimidating, even though he's gen
uinely interested — so he goes into finance and becomes an
investment banker.
The third character is played by Daniel Torres-Rangel,
who graduated from Stanford in 2005. He works for a senate
campaign that he ideologically disagrees with. I've definitely
seen this in some Stanford students — compromising your
ideals to get the job.
i: Who are the actors in "Political Animals?"
TG: It's diverse. We have some Stanford student actors, some
professional actors. It's a diverse group. Tina is played by
Annamarie MacLeod, who is a semi-professional actress.
i: When do you plan to finish "Political Animals?"
TG: The final cut should be finished by the end of September.
We'll screen it at Stanford, then submit it to as many festivals
as we can, with Sundance and TrißeCa at the upper end. We'll
see what it gets into.
The last movie I filmed before this was about 45 minutes long,
so we sent it to some short film festivals. It was called "The
Strange Case" and it was about torture and the CIA. There
were a lot of Stanford students involved with that one, too.

i: Did you write the script for this
film?
TG: Yes, I did. I write all the scripts
that I direct — mainly because I'm
not in a position where I can pick
scripts. I really like coming up with
concepts and screenwriting. I gen
erally have all the ideas for the
movies I make. I came up with the
idea for this around November of
2007, and I was tired of making
short films — I was starting to feel
constrained by the length.
Of course, a few people helped me
with the storyline and such.
Professor Jim Fearon in the political
science department helped out with
coming up with the title and the
storyline. Professor Laura Whitman
from the French and Italian depart
ment also helped me a lot.

i: How did you manage the budget?
TG: We applied for two grants to cover most of the budget.
The total budget of this is about $10,000, which is ultra-low
budget for a film of its size. Most films of this length have
about a $200,000 budget, so $50,000 would be on the low side,
and $10,000 is considered really low.
But it can be done. The thing about "Political Animals" is
that there's no spectacular special effects or action scenes. It's
basically a drama, so there's a lot of character work. There are
no demanding locations either — it's mostly offices and apart
ments.
My previous movie, "The Strange Case," was a lot more
demanding in that respect. We needed a make-up expert, there
were some degrees of action scenes, and we even came up with
clever ways to fake torture. We had to stage a lot of action and
set pieces.
i: Isn't it difficult to make a good movie on such a small budg
et?

TG: It is a little bit, but I'm used to it — I've been making
movies with few resources for a while now. I'm used to doing
things on the cheap, and it's definitely possible. I think direc
tors can achieve a lot of things if they put their mind to it and
don't just take the first option that comes along.
For example, if someone offers you equipment for $3,000,
someone who has a large budget could just accept that offer.
But if you put more effort into it, networked and made friends
with the right people, you could potentially find something
that's half that price. If you do that for every item on your
budget, then you're in good shape.
i: Do you have any advice for students who are interested in
filmmaking or who want to try their hand at the craft?
TG: My advice would just be to get in touch with the film soci
ety at Stanford. Network with them and try to get crew posi
tions. My first years at Stanford, I worked crew on two movies.
The first gig was as a grip, so I moved things around, went to
get food, etc. On the other one, I was an assistant director.
Towards the end, I got to co-direct. Through working on set,
you get to learn who's good at what, so that when you have
your own idea for a movie, you'll know who to look towards or
what quality to look for.
i: What do you think of the film society at Stanford?
TG: I like the film society here, I think it's quite good. The
other college I was looking at when I was applying was
Cambridge, and I think their film society consisted of a few
guys who got together to watch a movie every week. But here,
we have decent equipment, workshops to get you familiar with
the equipment and a group of people who are always willing to
help each other out on their projects.
If there's one thing that can be improved, though, it would
be offering more money to students to make ambitious proj
ects. Stanford Film Festival is good, but it only shows mostly
really short movies. If the University just gave a bit more
incentive — right now, the greatest amount you can get in a
grant is $500, which covers about parking ticket costs for us —
I think students could be a lot more ambitious.
i: Who's your favorite director or directors?
TG: I think my favorite director would have to be Alejandro
Inarritu. He directed "Babel" and "21 Grams." Both are seri
ous, character-driven movies. My other favorite would be
Christopher Nolan, who directed "The Dark Knight" and
"Prestige." Both were big-budget blockbusters, but Nolan put
a lot of thought into plot and character, which is rare in these
big-budget action movies.
i: Favorite movies? Least favorite?
TG: [My Favorites are) "Babel,""The Dark Knight,""lndiana
Jones and the Last Crusade." I think "Slumdog Millionaire" is
very overrated; I dislike the way it's glorified so much. I also
hated "Quantum of Solace."
(i): What are your future plans after college?
TG: I don't really have any at this moment. I was wait-listed at
NYU Tisch Film School. I'll be around until I finish editing
this movie. After that, I could either go back to Europe or
search for a job in politics. Politics and film arc both open
options. I would much rather prefer a career in film, but I
think it's easier to get a paying job in politics.
