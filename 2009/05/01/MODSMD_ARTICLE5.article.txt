## St. Michael's Alley: Eating on a prayer 
### 
Here's the scenario: your parents are in town and
offer to take you out anywhere in the area.
You're at a loss of where to go. Well, you are in
luck and stuck no longer as Intermission explores some
of the hidden gems of Palo Alto and help you and yours
eat out right. This week, we set out on a trek beyond
University Ave to the hearty Californian cafe known as
St. Michael's Alley.
While St. Michael's Alley is located at the corner of
High and Homer Streets just across the street from
campus, it's not (yet) a widely-known restaurant among
Stanford students. This is understandable as the classy
restaurant doesn't necessary cater to the college crowd,
considering that dinner entrees are in the $16-$3O range
per plate. Also, reservations are a MUST. I arrived for
lunch right when the restaurant opened and it was near
packed within 20 minutes.
Unless you are on a real nice date, this is probably not
the best place to go for the student on a budget, even for
brunch (served at 806 Emerson Street) in which plates
hover around $15. With that said, lunch is a possibility,
especially if you want to see some of the Palo Alto
movers & shakers, sample wines from their exhaustive
listings, or have a great business lunch. The elegant
atmosphere and good food make it a good choice to
"do" a meal in a business or romantic setting.
Understanding that lunch is at this choice is prob
ably your best bet, let's tackle the quality of the food. I
would say the overall quality is good, but choose wisely
as some dishes are better than others.
Let's begin with the starters, as much as you may be
tempted by its fancy name, don't pick the Charcuterie
Plate, which is essentially a meat antipasto. The portions
are way toO small to justify its $12 price tag. Their soups
are delicious as are their salads. Probably, the most

interesting dish on the appetizer menu consists of
Ginger Prawn Lollipops. My jury is still out is that one,
send me an email with what you think if you've tried it;
I'm open for some convincing either way.
For the heartier appetitive, St. Michael's Alley offers
several sandwiches and burgers, ranging from the
"ABC" half-pound Burger to a turkey wrap to a grilled
veggie sandwich. 1 focused in on the pastas, sampling
the Gnocchi, Fresh Pasta Shells, and Pepper Ravioli as a
daily special. While 1 might be predisposed to liking the
gnocchi dish as it's my favorite pasta, St Michael's Alley's
version of the classic tasted exactly like an incarnation
of the dish I enjoyed when I visited Rome in February.
The Pasta Shells with its favors blended together within
a creamy sauce were similarly delightful. Both of these
plates are quite filling and will make your tastebuds
dance for joy. As for the pepper ravioli, its sauce was a
little overpowering and while the ravioli's were cooked
well, quite a bit of the power of the dish was lost leading
to some disappointment.
In sum, St. Michael's is a great place for a power
lunch, but with its hefty price tags for its dishes (espe
cially for dinner) be sure to choose your dish wisely. I
encourage you to go with a friend and explore their
menu together as some of the dishes were outstanding.
St. Michael's Alley is open for lunch Monday
through Friday 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and for brunch
Saturday through Sunday 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Dinner is
served Monday through Saturday starting at 5:30 p.m.
