## Prime steak on THE FARM 
### 
Since Stanford University once served as the Stanford family's cattle
stock farm, it is only fitting that one can enjoy some top-notch meat
without leaving campus. Those who live in SAE might be able to
enjoy T-bone steak on Thursdays, but everyone else will have to venture
beyond their dining hall. But don't worry, The Axe and Palm has not
added steak to the menu (it would probably be safer to eat British beet
during the mad cow scare). To enjoy a top-ofc-the-line steak dinner with
out leaving Stanford's boundaries, one need only head over to Fleming's
at the Stanford Shopping Center.
Fleming's, which officially bills itself as a prime steakhouse and wine
bar, provides classic steakhouse fare in an environment that combines
modern accessibility and comfort with an otherwise appropriately con
servative atmosphere. The dark dining room, accented with wood and
leather, contains large tables surrounded by comfortable chairs or roomy
booths.
While the wine list offers an impressive 100 selections by the glass —
presumably justifying the wine bar moniker — the menu itself offers few
surprises. Appetizers include soups, salads and steakhouse standards such
as crab cakes. For entrees, one could theoretically opt for lobster tail or
some other seafood, but there really is no reason to discuss main courses
that aren't steak. Entrees are, of course, served rigorously a la carte, which
requires clients to order separate side items like asparagus, creamed
spinach or potatoes.
Perhaps the most impressive part of the meal was the chilled seafood
tower. Officially it was designed to serve two, though it wouldn't be too
unreasonable to have it feed three people, especially given the $55 price
tag. Embedded in a tower of ice were Alaskan king crab legs, lobster tails,
crab claws, jumbo shrimp and small bowls of Dungeness crab meat and
cevichc. The crab legs and shrimp were superb — easy to chew and full
of their own flavor rather than some added seasoning. The shrimp was
especially nice in contrast to the tasteless shrimp cocktails frequently
found at even high-end parties. The lobster, while tasty, still fell short of
a freshly-steamed lobster on the coast in Kennebunkport, Maine. As an
addition or alternative, consider the tomato and mozzarella salad. Both
appetizers set a high bar for the mains.
Fleming's signature dish is the bone-in rib eye. Other options
include a filet — either on or off the bone — or a New York strip. The
impressively-sized rib eye arrived from the 1,600-degree oven, cooked to
medium-rare perfection. It came pre-seasoned with some salt and pep
per and was delivered with carafes of three house sauces. The quality of
the meat was evident from the first bite. And while the fat was well dis
tributed to provide richness throughout — as should be the case in a rib
eye — I do think a slightly leaner steak would have been better as the
level of fat was detrimental to the texture and made it generally too rich
for a steak of that size. Along the lines of the richness, a little less salt and
butter might have allowed the taste of the meat to come through a bit
more and make the steak generally easier to stomach. The creamed
spinach on the side was easily passable, though the spinach flavor was
rather subtle compared to the cream. The mashed potatoes, however,

were outstanding and combined milky smooth
texture with natural flavor.
Fleming's service was professional and effi
cient. Orders were taken punctually, food arrived
at an appropriate pace and plates were always
removed in duly professional form. Neither the
water glasses nor the bread basket was ever
empty. However, everyone at the table agreed that
our waiter, while friendly, was a bit strange and
erred on the over-talkative side.
While clearly among the best meals you can
get without leaving Stanford, a Fleming's dinner

does not come without a price tag. After shelling
out a portrait of President Grant for an appetizer,
paying $43 for each rib eye doesn't help. Then
again, those prices arc about par for the course at
a steakhouse. And while Fleming's was very good
overall, it was a little short of the perfection that
goes with those prices. So, for the money, there
are better steaks in the world — but given the
convenience, Fleming's is by no means a bad bet.
