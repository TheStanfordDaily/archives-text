# The end of another "Heroes" volume
## 
### 
Heroes Seasons 3, Volume 4 ended on a slight
ly disturbing twist. If you haven't seen the
show, don't read this. If you have: Nathan
died but not quite, because Matt Parkman brain
washed Sylar to replace him.
The side-plot with Angelica Petrelli in the middle
of the season was, in my opinion, irrelevant filler. The
introduction of her sister seemed out-of-place in the
plot-line, and while the history behind the Company is
interesting, it could've been told elsewhere in the story.
Eithcrway, nobody likes watching filler, and that's what
a lot of Heroes season 3 episodes felt like.
The only reason I kept watching the show was in
part reminiscence for the awesomeness that was sea
son one and also to see Sylar. He is just about the most
awesome character and the only reason for watching
the show anymore. His personal history, development,
psychotic tendencies arc deeply interesting.
My only complaint against Sylar is that he is get
ting way too powerful. 1 really liked the Peter/Sylar
contrast in the first season — they had the same abili
ty to acquire other abilities, yet their personal goals
and personalities were completely different and Peter
was Sylar's only equal. Then the writers probably
decided that Peter was too powerful — and he proba
bly was — so they took a chunk of his abilities away.
Now they've decided that Hiro Nakamura (definitely
one of my favorites) is too powerful and he's suffering
repercussions from using his powers. Who next? I wish
there was more consistency in the show and less
wishy-washiness. The first two seasons were about
character development; recently, it's just been more
about powers and abilities. One of the only heroes
who's never underwent a change in her abilities is
Claire — and her self-righteousness and constant
whining on the show is near intolerable.
Also, how many times is Ali Larter going to re
appear in this show? First Niki/Jessica dies, then Tracy
Strauss appears, then fakes a death. The show insinu
ated that Niki, Tracy, and Barbara were triplets that all
were injected with various abilities. Barbara hasn't
even appeared yet — it appears that Ali Larter will
never be out of work.
Although initial fan reaction to the season finale twist

was negative — the Nathan/Sylar combination was
truly disturbing—l think it was interesting and
thought-provoking. What makes a person an individ
ual? What else can Matt Parkman's power be used to
do? The season finale ended in a giant philosophical
question mark.
Some are questioning whether Heroes will be can
celed. The first season peaked at 16 million viewers,
but the third season has been steadily declining in rat
ings. In my opinion, Heroes probably won't be can
celed; the season finale provided an interesting enough
twist, and most of NBC's shows are not doing well this
season. The Nathan/Sylar combination, formation of
another new Company, Sylar's proposal to Claire ...
all are interesting topics that can be played out well.
Also, I think Tim Kring should consider bringing back
some characters: The Haitian and Micah Sanders
should get bigger roles. Lyle Bennet needs to do some
thing because as of now he is just about the most use
less character ever. And Isaac Mendez' power, while a
good plot device, needs to stop haunting this show. I,
for one, am lukewarmly eager to see how next season
will play out.
