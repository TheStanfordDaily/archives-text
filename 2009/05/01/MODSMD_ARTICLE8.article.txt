# "Weeds" vs. "Breaking Bad:" Which drug show to watch?
## 
### 
Unsure about which hip drug-dealing show to watch?
Let Intermission help you figure out which is right
for you. Read on to discover the similarities and dif
ferences between Showtime's hit "Weeds" and AMC's award
winning "Breaking Bad," both of which deal with unlikely
drug dealers in unfortunate conversations. While both shows
are very close in many aspects, it is easy to tell the two apart
and decide which you want to fill up your TiVo.
Weeds
Starring Mary Louise Parker, "Weeds" is Showtime's half
hour-long hit "dramedy." It tells the story of Nancy Botwin, a
single mother of two, living in Agrestic, an upper-class subur
ban community. Her husband dies very suddenly
of a heart attack

and, due to poor financial planning, her family is left with
nothing. Unwilling to uproot her sons from school and the
community they are accustomed to, Nancy turns to the next
logical solution: marijuana. The demand for the drug in her
community is very high among adults, so Nancy transforms
from PTA mom to town dealer. The drama and hardship in
the show is offset by the hysterical characters in Agrestic.
Elizabeth Perkins, who plays PTA head Celia Hoades, is per
haps one of the funniest actresses on television and has won
multiple Emmys for her performance on "Weeds." Kevin
Nealon plays Doug Wilson,
Nancy's perpetually-stoned accountant who
causes more trouble than

good. While "Weeds" is packed to the brim with one-liners
and humorous situations, the show still boils down to the fact
that Nancy is facing arduous times, and, in order to support
herself and her sons, must work in a world that causes prob
lems for everyone involved.
Breaking Bad
AMC's Emmy award-winning series "Breaking Bad" is
notably more serious than "Weeds." Starring Bryan Cranston
from "Malcolm in the Middle," "Breaking Bad" follows the
life of Walter White, a brilliant chemist. Walter worked on a
chemistry project that ended up winning the Nobel Prize, but
due to unfortunate circumstances, receives neither a tenure
nor notoriety. He instead winds up working as a high school
chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, New Mexico. He is even
forced to keep a part-time job at a car wash to make ends
meet. He has a wife who surprises him with pregnancy and a
son with cerebral palsy. One day, after fainting at the car
wash, Walt is told that he has stage three lung cancer, which
means 15 months left to live. Through several strange cir
cumstances, Walt meets up with a former student, dropout
Jesse Pinkman, and becomes entrenched in the wonderful
world of crystal meth dealing. Walt begins cooking meth in
order to pay for his treatments and ensure financial security
for his family after he is gone. As depressing as this show may
sounds, Bryan Cranston gives an inspired performance that
recently won him an Emmy. It is almost impossible to believe
he is the dad from "Malcolm in the Middle." "Breaking Bad"
won't leave you happy and laughing — but it will leave you in
awe and on edge, excited to see what happens next week.
