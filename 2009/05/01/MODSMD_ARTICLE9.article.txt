# Our planet "Earth:" a collage
## 
### 
April 22 — My favorite holiday, Earth Day. Finally a
holiday solely dedicated to a topic that everyone
can appreciate — the fragility of our Earth. 1

had been anxiously waiting for this day for a while
— firstly, to celebrate the beauty of our planet, but
more importantly, to see the new movie "Earth."
This film, narrated by James Earl Jones, primarily
follows the lives of three "families" as they try to
survive varying adverse conditions: a polar bear

mother and her two cubs, a herd of elephants and their
calves and a humpback whale with its calf. The film also
depicts the many varying habitats on Earth, as well as the
animals that populate them.

Sounds familiar, right? That is because the Discovery
Channel series "Planet Earth" has a very similar concept. 1
love "Planet Earth," so the fact that the film seemed so similar
to the series was actually a major reason for my excitement in
seeing it. However, as I sat in the theatre watching the movie,
it all seemed very familiar. I had definitely not seen the movie
before, yet the scenes and animals were not new to me. Was 1
experiencing deja vu? I could not believe it — basically, the
film is different scenes from "Planet Earth," edited together
into one large, all-encompassing ode to the planet. The movie
itself is definitely entertaining and many of the environments
are breathtaking, but I've already seen it all before. And not
just once — I've seen "Planet Earth" a lot. The bottom line is,
1 felt kind of ripped off. I could just as easily have stayed
home and watched "Planet Earth" DVDs.

I could not be mad for too long because a lot of the cine
matography is mind-blowing, regardless of how many times
you've seen it. The use of editing enables the film to acceler
ate the natural changes an environment experiences through
out a single day, or even an entire season, to mere seconds for
us to witness. You can see plants blooming and moving in
relation to the sun, and the leaves of the trees changing colors
and falling off. The film showcases a wide variety of different
animals in different environments. It presents everything
from walruses swimming in the Arctic Circle to birds of para
dise courting potential mates in the tropics. Unfortunately,
the film also includes the harsh reality of the food chain —
there are several scenes of exchanges between predator and

prey. These interactions only emphasize the fact that our time
on Earth is very short.
It may sound odd, hut the sight of different animals and
the struggles they endure just to survive the day really makes
us appreciate the relatively easy life we have as humans. The
film is truly a testament to life and death, the power of nature
and the importance of familial bonds. The film made me
want to run outside, clog all the exhaust pipes of the cars sit
ting in the parking lot and scream profane things at people
who litter. The breathtaking landscapes and heartwarming
storylines make you realize the inadequacy of a single day
dedicated to the Earth — everyday should be Earth day.
