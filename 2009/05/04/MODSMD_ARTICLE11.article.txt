## Condival went too far 
### 
On I riday after lunch. I was biking
through White I'la/a to class when I
passed a small gioup ol students who
were perfotming ;i paiody of waterboarding.
I only saw ii in passing, but some students
held another above a tub ol water, while a
young woman y el led at him, asking where the
tenoiisls were, lite small crowd around the
scene laughed h\stei ically.
I he activity was called "waterboarding
lot apples." and was just one of several
booths ;i( ('ondival." an event that aimed to
piotest some ol ( ondoleezza Rice s actions
as Sccietary of Stale. I spoke with one ol the
events organizers,and I leai ned that ( ondi
\;il was intended as absurdist political the
ater to draw attention to the ridiculousness
(»l the Bush administiation's rhetoric. De
spite the ailistic goal. I believe the display
w;is iii bad taste.
Now. I, too. am a ct it ic of the Bush admin
istration. but I believe that presenting the is
sues in th:s maimer was immature. Water
boarding is not a joke,and treating it so light
ly offends nioic than it provokes thought.
I lie organizei that I spoke to said that he
wanted to put people out of their comfort
zones He succeeded, but instead of encour
aging meaningful discussion through this
parody, the event seemed to settle for sar
casm and i idicttlc.
I he event's e flyer was troubling as well
It had a picture of Rice above the slogan."So
much fun its a war crime.'' below which were
t:il Ii H»os <>l jMoups called "Republicans at

Stanford," "Stanford College Conserva-
'ampiis Review" and "Stanford Stu
dents lor Democracy." clear parodies of
many of the more conservative student
groups on campus. By indirectly linking Stan
lord's conservative groups with war crimes,
the flyer can only increase the division in the
campus political scene.
I he ( 'ondival event is only one of several
recent protests to Rice's return that have
gone too far. A few days ago. there was a dev
ilish image of Rice projected on Hoover
lower. ITiis newspaper carried a story with
the provocative headline."Rice Defends Wa
terboarding." while the content of the article
proved no such thing. One You Tube video
shows a student who repeatedly cuts off the
former Secretary of State while asking her
about the (iuantanamo Bay detention camp.
As students grapple with the role of
America in the world and with our Stanford
identity. I have no doubt that the intent of
these displays was good. However. I believe
that we as students need to conduct this dis
cussion with more civility. We should not
stand for crass displays that make conserva
tives leel attacked and that make students
like myself embarrassed to be a liberal at
Stanford. Instead, let's heed President
()bama's call during the campaign and tone
down our rhetoric so that we can create a
comfortable and vibrant political scene on
campus.
