## Is the Pope Catholic? 
### 
In the midst of swine flu, a global recession
and the most eventful first KM) days of a
new American administration maybe
ever. Pope Benedict XVI and the Roman
Catholic Church haven't been grabbing
many headlines lately. You may or may not
have heard, then,about what they've been up
to in the last several months. This is real a
shame,too, because the Pope and the ( hurch
have been up to all kinds of insanity while we
haven't been paying attention. Highlights
from the past twelve months include the
claim that saving homosexuals was roughly
as important as (and equivalent to) saving
the rainforest as well as Pope Benedict's re
cent claim that condom use accelerates the
spread of AIDS in developing nations.
In an increasingly secular and liberal na
tion. and at an overwhelmingly liberal
school, it's easy to write things like this off as
the archaic rants ol a very creepy old Ger
man. but to do so would be a mistake. The
Pope today may seem insignificant, particu
larly to those who aren't Catholic and
weren't raised (as I was.at least in school) to
follow what the Pope says and believe in his
words as if they were (iod's. While it might
seem like simply a ceremonial title these
days, the Pope still wields an incredible
amount of power, albeit power we can't eas
ily quantify. Perhaps it's better to say he
wields an incredible amount of influence.
and believe me, the idea that this man has
any kind of world influence should be a
very, very scary prospect to anyone who
considers themselves to be a supporter of
human beings.
The Pope presides over a global congrega
tion of one billion Catholics, making it the
most commonly held religious belief system
on the planet and accounting for over 50 per
cent of all Christianity. Unlike Islam and
I linduism (the next two largest world faiths),
Catholicism is rooted in the belief that the
Pope is ( hrist"s proxy here on I arth, a kind

of stand-in for God's wishes here on Earth.
Without getting into anything regarding the
legitimacy of such a belief (which is one I've
struggled with my entire life, and also some
thing I know is entirely beyond the scope of a
very amateurish Daily columnist), the fact is
that part of counting oneself a part of the
Church is being more or less down with
everything the Pope says. This is how we got.
among other things, the Crusades and the In
quisition — scary and pointless times of in
credible violence that began almost exclu
sively at the Pope's behest.
Being a global society, papal messages can
go out at light speed — encyclicals (letters
the Pope occasionally writes that are said to
be'channeling God') can be read within min
utes of their creation rather taking years to
reach all believers as they once did. and thus
the current Pope has an incredible ability to
get his message out quickly and to saturate
his followers with it. Simply put. considering
the scope of his influence and the efficiency
of modern technology at delivering his mes
sage, the Pope of today has a greater ability to
change and shape the course of history than
virtually any of his predecessors.
I lere's an example: I went to what I 'd con
sider a fairly moderate Catholic middle
school in terms of its level of fundamentalist
crazy, but even in sex ed class, we fast for
warded through the parts of the videos on
condoms, never discussed birth control and
almost never used the word 'sex' in a sen
tence without also using the word 'marriage.'
Even then it all seemed a little impractical,
but at the highest levels of government (both
at the Vatican and in the U.S.), this has been
the way of doing things for most of the past
decade. Probably nothing has done more to
increase the fury of the AIDS epidemic in
parts of Africa than the Bush-Benedict di
chotomy, which vehemently opposed the use
of birth control in developing nations and
pushed abstinence-only education programs

as a way of combating spread of the disease.
Add to this Benedict's recent comments that
condoms spread AlDS.and perhaps now you
can begin to see how horrific the conse
quences of the current papal views on global
health issues can be when they are taken as
God-dictated fact by millions of Catholic fol
lowers.
While some faiths have taken great steps
in the direction of reconciling faith and sci
ence (the Dalai I ama's embracing of genet
ics. for example). Catholicism is going in a
different, very dangerous direction. Recently
the Belgian Parliament passed a resolution
condemning Benedict's claims about AIDS,
which have nothing to do with science and
everything to do with archaic, centuries-out
dated beliefs, and I can only dream that our
own legislature be brave enough to do the
same.There are countless examples through
out history — hell, countless examples right
now — of theocratic leaders creating disas
trous consequences when they rely on whol
ly incorrect dogma in professing their views
and beliefs.and Benedict is no exception.The
name Benedict, of course, comes from the
Latin word meaning "blessed"; we would all
be very blessed if this Pope would go ahead
and keep his mouth shut about incredibly im
portant, world-changing issues that he simply
does not understand.
