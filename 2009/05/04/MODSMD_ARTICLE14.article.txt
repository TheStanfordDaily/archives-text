## The

The departure of Senator Allen Specter
for the Democratic Party is the most
dramatic indication yet seen of the
dire state the Republican Party is currently
in.'lTie Republican Senate caucus now con

Mark Warner and Dianne I einstein, among
many others. It is unclear whether moderates
have a home in the Republican Party at all
anymore, which bodes poorly for the party's
long-term electoral chances.
The Specter jump obscures a far more
concerning development for Republicans
the jump of moderate voters. Specter's ap
proval rating plummeted among likely Re
publican primary voters at least partially due
to the fact that moderates no longer identify
as Republicans, leaving huge majorities of
"conservatives" and "very conservatives."
not the types likely to support a pro-choice

ITie Republican tent seems to be getting
smaller and smaller just as the Democrats' is
getting bigger. I he Blue Dog Democrats, a
faction of moderate and conservative De
mocrats in the House ol Representatives,
currently numbers more than 50 members
more than a fifth of all House Democrats.
The grouping has had to turn away many ap
plicants for fear of growing too large and los
ing cohesiveness. I lie long ago days of 2(H)4,
when former Democratic Senator /.ell Miller
spoke at the Republican National Conven

Democratic Party, seem so long ago. New

sentation in its House delegations.
It is certainly appalling to see the treat
ment of moderates in the Republican Party.
Former New York City mayor Rudy C iiu
liani. for all of his other flaws, was roughed up
during the Republican presidential primary
for his pro choice and "pro-gay" views.
Michael Steele, the current RNC thairman.
was tarred during his campaign for that post
by daring to associate himself with the Re
publican l eadership Council, a moderate
group. It is ludicrous that in a major party, a
mere association with a moderate group can
be used as a negative.
The loss for Republicans is a huge gain for
the Democrats. Iliis conservatism is increas
ingly out of step with the populace at large.

During the 2(M)«S presidential election. I
watched a lot of George W. Mush's campaign
ads from 2(H M) to compare them to John Mc-
Cain's doomsday ads. Ihe Bush ads were
striking for how ihev appealed to the center,
not the right: bright and happy, with lots ot
talk of education and immigration reform.
The Cl()!' in the past few years does not seem
to care a whit about either of those issues, un

As someone who generally supports Pres
ident Obama. one might view this develop
ment as a good thing. Continued monopo
li/ation of moderates will ensure Democrat
ic victories for decades to come. But the De
mocrats will not be able to govern indefinite
ly — all ruling parties in strong democracies
lose eventually, unless you're in Japan. The
necessity is that all parties with the potential
to rule are responsible and do not respond
only to their hardline base The Democratic
Party in recent years has done an excellent
job of balancing between leftists and modcr
ates. but we cannot say the same for Repub
licans. who have yet to prove themselves fit to
rule again. Few phrases in the English lan
guage are more terrifying than "House
Speaker John Bochner."
It does seem likely that one day. Republi
cans will again acknowledge their moder
ates: indeed, that is the only way they will
ever be able to win states like California and
( onnecticut again. I Intil they do. the Demo
cratic Party will monopolize the policy dis
cussion.
