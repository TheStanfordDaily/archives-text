## CALLING CARD Stanford takes much-needed two of three from WSU 
### ERIK ADAMS DESK EDITOR 
Stanford baseball desperately needed a se
ries win to keep its postseason hopes alive, and
after dropping the opener in a close game, the
team rallied to take the final two from the num
ber two team in the conference, Washington
State.
Sophomore Drew Storen and junior Jeffrey
Inman earned wins, and freshman starter Jordan
Pries pitched a three-hit complete game on Fri
day. but took a loss. Taking two of three kept
Stanford (22-19. 10-11 Pacific-10 Conference)

within reach of the top third of the conference,
but it will take a very strong finish to earn a post
season spot.
"Winning the series was big for our whole sea
son." Storen said."lt helps keep you in the hunt,
and it is never too late when you are playing in a
conference like we are, because everyone is
going to be right there at the end. and we will
have a chance to move up."
Moreover, taking a series on the road from
the Cougars (22-20. 11-7) will only help Stan
ford's case come selection time,and the momen
tum from this weekend could help push the Car
dinal over the top.

in the first and two more in the third on a two-
RBI single by Milleville, which made the score 3-

first was a three-run double.and the next an RBI
triple.

chance to rally.
