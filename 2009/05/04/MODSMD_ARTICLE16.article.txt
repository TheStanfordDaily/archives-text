# Predicting Prematurely?

With the NFL Draft in the
hooks and the NBA
Playoffs still grinding
away with weeks to go
until the Finals, it's time
to turn our attention back to the hoys of
summer, and finally have something to say
about them.
You see, baseball's funny that way. You
can have your opinions about a team or a
player before the season starts, but it will
be weeks before you have any real idea of
whether you were right. Name one other
sport like that. Football may not always
give everything away right at the season's
opening kickoff. but when junior running
back Toby Gerhart shredded the San Jose
State defense two years ago, you knew he
was going to be special. If freshman QB
Andrew Luck shines just as bright to start
2009, Cardinal fans everywhere will have
a similar sense that this team is on to
something.
Basketball's the same way. really. How
long did it take people to figure out that
Dwyane Wade just might have been a bet
ter pick than Darko Milicic back in 2003?
And who can forget the debut of the
Lopez twins here on the Farm? I leek, we
all pretty much knew they were going to
be superstars before they even set foot on
campus. It's not like there are hordes of
seven-foot tall twins out there who have
the grades to make it into an Ivy League
caliber institution.
But baseball is just a horse of a differ
ent color. A freshman who goes 5-5 at the
plate to start the season might be the
biggest sports star to hit campus since
John Elway — or he might have just been
a little bit lucky. In a game that's more
about precision than prowess, where suc
cess is measured by doing things just the
right way over and over and over again, it
can take a little while to separate what's
really happening from the statistical
11 ukes at the start of every season. But. the
fun part is. year after year, eventually, the
picture always starts to become clear.
Here on the Farm, the picture is resolv
ing all too quickly for Cardinal fans' lik
ing. Stanford went into this weekend with
many of my colleagues at The Daily pro
claiming that the team needed a sweep to
stay in the postseason hunt. "This team is
solid." went the standard line of thinking.
"Maybe not great, but good enough to
contend, if they can just put it all togeth
er."
My colleagues aren't wrong.This team
would be good enough to contend if it put
everything together. Better than good
enough, even. The problem is, in the col
lege season, it's too late for could he's and
potential at this point.
Whenever a team goes into a series
knowing it needs a sweep to stay compet
itive, it's a bad sign. It's just a lot of pres
sure to put on a team, in a sport where
fluky things happen all the tirrte. That
holds true for the Cardinal as well as any
other squad out there. Plus,at this point, it
needs to be said that Stanford probably
isn't a good team just looking to put it all
together, but, more than likely,is an incon
sistent team that couldn't put it all togeth
er. Being in seventh place in the confer
ence in May isn't a good place to be when
vou want to make a run at Omaha.

I hope I'm wrong. Indeed, that's why
this game is fun. Because no matter how
much we think we know, there's always
that chance that at the end of the season
we'll be looking back and wondering,
"Man. how did I not see that one coming?"
Anecdotally, I was at the Giants' game
Friday night, when Randy Johnson got his
297 th career victory. It was a cold, wet
night for baseball, so the stands weren't
anywhere near full, but a couple of rows
behind me sat two boys, maybe 11 or 12
years old. And they were having a great
time, as one might expect.cheering loudly
for every Giants batter who came to the
plate. But who did they cheer for the loud
est?

This team
would be good
enough to con
tend if it put
everything to
gether [...]

Randy Johnson.
Yes, Randy Johnson with his .(KM) hat
ling average for the season and .125 mark
for his career. He was the one who drew
the loudest cheers from the boys, who
even went so far as to chant 'Ran-dy!
Ran-dy! Ran-dy!" as he awkwardly set
tled inio his stance at the plate.
And there was not a hint of irony in
their enthusiasm.They meant it.
There's no surprise ending to t his story.
Johnson struck out as the kids behind me;
were still enthusiastically chanting his
name.
But you know what? That career aver
age means that one in ten times, they'd
have been right. Would a hit have been
rare? Yes. Impossible? No. And. hitless or
not, Johnson still walked away with that
win. Yep, it's a funny game, baseball.
Which is why, after taking two out of
three from the Cougars this weekend, it's
still not time to despair and bury the Car
dinal's chances in 2009, and why I'd rather
not analyze this one too closely, or point
out just how many teams Stanford will
need to leapfrog in the conference stand
ings to maybe make it to the playoffs this
year.
Because, sometimes, it's more fun to
imagine Randy Johnson is a slugger.
