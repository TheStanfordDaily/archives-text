## Card sweeps Zona teams to remain on top 
### CHRIS FITZGERALD DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
The Stanford Softball team opened May
with another home sweep as it dealt out three
games of payback in the season series against
the Arizona schools.
No. 6 ASU (38-15,8-10 Pacific-10 Confer
ence) tagged No. 3 Stanford (44-6.13-5) for 10
runs just two weeks ago, hut the Cardinal re
sponded with an eight-inning decision against
the Sun Devils the next day and dominated an
other rubber match on Friday. Play began at 8
p.m.. after being delayed an hour by pockets of
heavy rain, but Stanford found the win worth
the wait.
Senior ace Missy Penna delivered 11 strike
outs in a two-hitter to pick up her 30th victory
of the year, and the Cardinal went on to win 4-
0. Penna recorded her 1.200 th career strikeout
on the final batter she faced,also recording the
first of her two weekend wins.
Junior Alissa I laber added three hits to the
offensive effort, including a home run. but
freshman Ashley Hansen provided the excla
mation point â€” all four KBIs belonged to
Hansen, and she went 2-4, with a home run in
the fourth to lift the Cardinal.
Stanford had never taken a season series
from No. 7 Arizona (39-13.11-6). But the Wild
cats, who came into play Saturday with a life
time record of 45-5-1 against Stanford, were
caught by surprise.
Sophomore Ashley Chinn got the nod from
head coach John Rittman. Chinn, who rarely
starts in conference games, tossed a complete

GAME NOTES: Stanford (44-6,13-5 Fbc-10) has won its last
seven games straight, bunching the Cardinal to the top of fbc
-10 rankings But, the Huskies' fourth-place position leaves them
in striking distance of Stanford. While Cardinal pitrher Missy
flenna has been dominant in conference play, Washington's
Danielle lawrie struck out 18 batters agomst Oregon in the
Huskies' 8-2 win. Washington will also be in search of revenge
after dropping to Stanford twice earlier in the season.

game in a come-from-behind. 4-3 win for the
Cardinal.
Meanwhile, the Wildcats' primary hurler,
junior Sarah Akamine. shut down Stanford
through five innings, but Stanford scored four
in the sixth and overtook Arizona for the win.
In that sixth inning, eight Cardinal batters pro
duced two doubles (from Hansen and senior
Maddy Coon) and two singles, and Arizona
added two errors. A passed ball helped
the Cardinal go ahead with two outs, as
sophomore pinch runner Autumn Al
bers took home to secure Stanford's
first lead.
Rittman was pleased with Chinn's
first career win over a ranked oppo
nent.
"Ashley's a competitor" he said.
"We have complete confidence in her
in the circle. We know she can handle it.
and she showed that."
Chinn's victory over the nation's
top offense moved her to 13-2. while
Arizona hung senior Jennifer Martinez
out to dry. The transfer relieved
Akamine in the sixth, with the bases
full, only to see the defense commit two
errors behind her en-route to a loss.
Rittman looked at the mistakes
each team made defensively, but
thought Stanford had the upper hand.
"We took advantage of their mis

takes," he said. "We gave them the
same type of opportunity [Sunday],
and they squandered it."
With two more weekend wins
under their belts, the Cardinal women
punished Arizona on Senior Cay at
Smith Family Stadium, giving up just
one hit and winning 2-1.
Penna redeemed herself against the
team that had walloped her for a dozen
runs in the desert earlier this season.
The All-American fanned 13 in her
33rd complete game on the year.
"I tried to eliminate walks and hit
batters," Penna said of her outing. "I
tried not to rely too much on a single
pitch. I mixed up the drop and the
change-up."
Stanford's bats faced sophomore
Lindsey Sisk. who lasted only one in
ning and surrendered three hits and
two runs. Sisk collected the loss, while
Martinez came on for the final 4.2 in
nings and allowed just five hits and no
runs.
Freshman Maya Burns helped out
Penna on Senior Day, going 3-3 and
scoring a run. The Cardinal put runs
across in the first and second, but none

after that. Haber was beaned by a pitch
to open the game, but got up after 60
seconds on the ground to take first.
From there, she stole second and
scored a run. as well as added two hits
and another stolen base as the day pro
gressed.
The only Arizona hit on the after
noon came from senior Jenae Leles on
a leadoff home run. Still in the fourth
with no outs, Penna hit junior catcher
Stacie Chambers with a pitch and al
lowed senior Sam Bannister to reach
on an error. Penna plunked her third
batter on the day. but struck out the
final two Wildcats and escaped with the
bases full.
The one-hitter on Sunday complet
ed a 14-inning weekend for Penna, in
which she allowed just one run and
three hits. Moreover, as a team, Stan
ford has won its last seven consecutive
games.
Ihe Cardinal will face No. 4 Wash
ington on the road this Thursday. The
Huskies are 13-0 at home this year.
