## Women's lacrosse season comes to a disappointing finish 
### 
Despite losing just four games all sea
son, roaring to a top finish at the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF)
Tournament and upsetting No. 3 Penn on
the road to close out its season, the Stan
ford women's lacrosse team found itself
on the outside looking in at the NCAA
Tournament. It was an outcome that left
the team stunned at the conclusion of
what could not be termed anything but a
wildly successful season in all other re
spects.
"We really thought we did what we
needed to do." said first-year coach Amy
Bokker to GoStanford.com.
Hie Cardinal (14-4. 8-0 MPSF) was
kept out of the tournament, despite its
strong play, in large part because the
MPSF is not currently assigned an auto
matic bid as a conference. While that is
scheduled to change next season, it was.
nevertheless, little solace for this year's
team, which watched the tournament se
lection show on CHS College Sports at
Jimmy V's Cafe.
The disappointing finish to the season
came shortly after one of the year's great
est triumphs earlier in the day. when the
Cardinal defeated No. 3 Penn. K-6. Junior
Lauren Schmidt led the way for Stanford,
scoring three goals, which put her second
on the team for the season with a total of
35. Junior Dana Lindsay added two goals
for the Cardinal, and sophomores Leslie
Foard and Sarah Flynn and senior Jamie
Nesbitt each chipped in one to give Stan
ford the win.

Junior Lauren Schmidt scored three goals in the Cardinal's 8-6 win over No. 3 Penn, but the
season finale's victory was not enough to earn Stanford a spot in the NCAA Tournament.
