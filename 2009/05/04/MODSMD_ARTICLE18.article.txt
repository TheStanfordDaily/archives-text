Despite losing just four games all sea
son, roaring to a top finish at the Moun
tain Pacific Sports Federation (MPSF)
Tournament and upsetting No. 3 Penn on
the road to close out its season, the Stan
ford women's lacrosse team found itself
on the outside looking in at the NCAA
Tournament. It was an outcome that left
the team stunned at the conclusion of
what could not be termed anything but a
wildly successful season in all other re
spects.

needed to do." said first-year coach Amy

kept out of the tournament, despite its
strong play, in large part because the
MPSF is not currently assigned an auto

Cardinal defeated No. 3 Penn. K-6. Junior
Lauren Schmidt led the way for Stanford,
scoring three goals, which put her second
on the team for the season with a total of

ford the win.
