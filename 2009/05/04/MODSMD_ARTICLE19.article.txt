# MEN'S ROWING
## Stanford too slow in Big Row 
### JEFF LU CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Despite putting forth a valiant ef
fort at Sunday's Big Row in Red
wood Shores, Calif., the Stanford
men's crew team was unable to pull
off a repeat of last year's decisive vic
tory over California. Although both
teams had been beaten by Washing
ton the weekend before, the Cardinal
still held a slight edge over the Gold
en Bears in the national rankings.
But. in the end, all three Cardinal
rowing teams came up short against
their Cal counterparts.
Scattered showers and overcast
weather marred the skies over the
2,000-meter course at Redwood
Shores, where No. 3 Stanford met the
No. 4 Cal crews to continue the Big
Row tradition. The event has
brought Stanford and Cal together
every year since 1903 for a day of
fierce competition. Prior to the Car
dinal's victory last year, the Golden
Bears had staked their claim to the
Schwabacher Cup. the men's portion
of the Big Row, for 18 consecutive
years.
Aside from being a friendly com
petition. the Big Row also serves the
dual purpose of linking both crew
teams to their larger communities
and promoting larger issues. This
year, the race sought to raise breast
cancer awareness.
"[Breast cancer] affects all com
munities. Cardinal and White, Blue
and Gold, and it's time to wear pink
to respect those who are in the fight,"
said Stanford head coach Craig
Amerkhanian.
For Amerkhanian, the charity as
pect of this year's Big Row was per
sonal. Spectators and supporters
alike wore T-shirts in the memory of
Carol Amerkhanian Marganian, the
sister of the Cardinal coach, who suc-

GAME NOTES: The Cardinal men's rowers
were swept by the Golden Bears at the Big
Row on Saturday, falling in the varsity eight,
second varsity eight and freshman races.
The first team varsity eight fell by just 4.54
seconds. Both teams wore pink to raise
breast cancer awareness. The Cardinal men
will now face a two-week break from com

onships in Gold River, Calif.

cumbed to breast cancer in October.
"This was a solid statement for
breast cancer awareness from both
Cal and Stanford," Amerkhanian
said.
The event kicked off with a heat
ed race between the Cardinal and
Cal varsity eight crews. Their first
two meetings of the year drew mixed
results — the Stanford crew edged
Cal in the preliminary heat of the San
Diego Crew Classic, but was out
paced by 4.54 seconds by the Golden
Bears in the finals.
Cal broke ahead by a boat-length
from the beginning of the race, and
was held to that margin by the Stan
ford rowers heading into the final leg
of the race. However, the Golden
Bears powered through the last 500
meters to clock 5:41:54, posting yet
another 4.54 second victory over the
Cardinal.
"We were over amped for the Big
Row," Amerkhanian said. "Our guys

learned that it is imperative to trust
one another and execute our race
plan."
Stanford's second varsity eight
fared slightly better in its first three
quarters of the race, racing nose to
nose with Cal up until the final S(X)
meters where Cal would once again
break away, this time finishing with a
time of 5:48:8,11.69 seconds ahead of
Stanford.
An hour later,a boat-length victo
ry by the Cal freshmen rowers gave
the Golden Bears a full sweep of the
men's side of the tournament — and
its 19th Schwabacher Cup in 20
years. Like the previous two races,
the Cardinal crew was within a few
feet of the Cal rowers, but unable to
match the Golden Bears' final sprint
to the finish line.
Still. Amerkhanian was satisfied
with the race's results.
"Today was a solid row," he said.
"Although we still have a lot of work
to do, I'm pleased that the team is
continuing to make significant tech
nical progress."
Amerkhanian's optimism may be
due in part to the fact that he is al
ready looking forward to the bigger
tournaments dominating the latter
half of the month.
"The season begins in earnest
with the Pac[ific]-10 Championships
in two weeks," he said. "Three weeks
after the Pac-10 Championships, the
IRA National Championship will be
held on the same course. We would
like to initiate momentum on [the
former] that will carry over to [the
latter]."
Unfortunately for Amerkhanian.
Sunday's loss means Stanford will be
seeded third, behind Cal and Wash
ington, at the upcoming Pac-10
Championships.
