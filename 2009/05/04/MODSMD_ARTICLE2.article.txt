# Execs push social issues
## The 						Daily interviews new ASSU Executives David Gobaud and Jay de la Torre 
### ELLEN HUET ZOE RICHARDS 
Ever since he was a Senate associate in his
first year at Stanford, David Gobaud 'OK M.S. '10
felt that Stanford was an amazing place that
could be made even better through the ASSU.
Four years later, and paired with Jay de la Torre
'10, he is finally in a position — as ASSU
Executive — to realize these goals by emphasiz
ing "cooperation" between different divisions of
the ASSU and political engagement of the stu
dent body.
When asked how they would like to be
remembered after their term as executives, both
Gobaud and de la Torre emphasized the impor
tance of raising awareness about social issues and

seeing more students involved in the political
process.
Gobaud. who has since the transition spent
more hours in the Old Union ASSU offices than
in his own dorm room, emphasized the impor
tance of mobilizing students. The Executives are
considering launching a Courseßank-style Web
site to help students explore volunteer service
organizations in an effort to attract students to
campus service.
"We hope that we can engage students that
typically aren't engaged." Gobaud said.
De la Torre also stressed that the combination
of input from the Executive cabinet and the stu
dent body at large could help the ASSU create
more innovative solutions to student concerns.

"It's about getting the entire campus to buy in
on the things we're doing," de la Torre said. "I
think a lot of that will be soliciting feedback and
suggestions from as much of the student body as
possible to feel that sense of ownership and con
tribution to making things happen."
The new ASSU chiefs noted a weakness in
past administrations to inspire involvement
among graduate students and they thus intend to
create cohesion between graduate and under
graduate communities.
The team hopes to maintain strong and trans
parent communication between themselves and
the student body by publicly disclosing progress

made on campaign platform issues
throughout the year. The pair also
pressed the importance of making
ASSU activities and updates more
accessible to students so that they
can become more involved in stu
dent government decision-making.
Gobaud and de la Torre will look
for students who can help them get
others excited about the issues on
their platform as they complete
interviews for the Executive Cabinet.
"We want people who can inspire
others to get work done," de la Torre
said, "to take ownership of these
issues, that way the sense of owner
ship spreads and more and more
people become engaged in the
issues."
In tandem with what they hope
will be an inspiring cabinet, the Execs
plan to increase contact between
themselves and the student body, by
following the trend of town halls that
sprung up this year in addition to
writing a blog to keep students in
stride with their plans and progress.
Although Gobaud and de la Torre
have only been in office for nine
days, the team has already begun sev
eral projects to improve student life,
such as the ASSU Matchmaker, a
centralized program designed to help
students find roommates, which
already has over 100 students signed
up.
"A student emailed us one day
saying that there should be some way
for students to find roommates based
on preferences, and we launched the
service within 72 hours," Gobaud
said. "The Web site matches people
before the Draw deadline, and they
have the chance to contact each
other."
As for the rest of spring quarter.
Gobaud said that the biggest goal is
to organize the executive team and
define each member's visions and
goals for the year. The summer will
be spent establishing the team infra

structure, interfacing with adminis
trators and fleshing out plans, all to
build the necessary foundation for
next year's work.
The team's goals for the year are
still somewhat undecided, as they
have yet to select their cabinet, which
will be organizing the projects. The
Gobaud-de la Torre platform prom
ised @stanford.edu email addresses
for life, which Gobaud said are
"going to be done by spring [2010]".
and are currently in discussions with
Dining Services about implementing
healthier food options in the Axe &
Palm. Over the course of the year,
the team hopes to increase the value
of student input by surveying for
campus opinion on food issues and
other preferences.
In general, the Executives hope to
work on projects in parallel rather
than focus on one at a time, and they
also plan to use their position to
highlight broader campus issues.
"[The work] we've done already
has been concentrated toward stu
dent life, but we don't want that to
be the defining characteristic of our
administration," de la Torre said.
"There's something to be said about
Stanford's perfect image clouding
some of the [awareness regarding!
serious issues that we lace as stu
dents— eating disorders, relation
ship abuse, mental health, etc."
Last year's Executives Jonny
Dorsey '09 and Fagan I larris '09 used
the ASSU to undertake longer-term
goals, and the current Executives
hope to continue the pattern. In
order to tackle these large-scale stu
dent issues such as mental health and

dependent healthcare for graduate
students. Gobaud and de la Torre
recognize that the efforts must span
across more than just one year's
administration.
"It's hard to do a lot in literally
two quarters." Gobaud explained.
"We're going to set a precedent of
working on a broader level, and this
is something that needs to continue
year after year."
The team plans to overcome the
common dilemma of approaching
multi-year problems with single
year terms by instituting a small
internal policy summit each year at
the time of administration turnover.
This year's will be the first, tenta
tively scheduled for May 10.
The transition summit will bring
together old and new members of

the Undergraduate Senate, the
Graduate Student Council, the
Executives, class slates and leaders
of various volunteer service organi
zations in an effort to streamline
service projects within the ASSU.
"We're trying to have better com
munication between all the bodies of
the ASSU," de la Torre said. "This
way, those who are passionate and
involved with specific issues can
establish a channel of communica
tion in order to get things done with
out duplicating efforts."
Gobaud and de la Torre are
quick to acknowledge that these
ambitious goals quickly deplete
their free time.
"This is the only thing I do
besides school," de la Torre
explained. "It's basically a 24/7 job."

Dorsey and Harris" office in Old
Union reflected (he full-time nature
of being an ASSIJ Executive.
"The first thing we did when we
got into the office was clean it up,"
de la Torre said with a laugh. "It's
still not looking great now, hut it was
definitely much worse. We found
some interesting foodstuffs."
