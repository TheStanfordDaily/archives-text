# Execs push social issues

						Daily interviews new ASSU Executives David Gobaud and Jay de la Torre

Ever since he was a Senate associate in his
first year at Stanford, David Gobaud 'OK M.S. '10
felt that Stanford was an amazing place that
could be made even better through the ASSU.
Four years later, and paired with Jay de la Torre
'10, he is finally in a position — as ASSU
Executive — to realize these goals by emphasiz
ing "cooperation" between different divisions of
the ASSU and political engagement of the stu
dent body.
When asked how they would like to be
remembered after their term as executives, both
Gobaud and de la Torre emphasized the impor
tance of raising awareness about social issues and

seeing more students involved in the political
process.
Gobaud. who has since the transition spent
more hours in the Old Union ASSU offices than
in his own dorm room, emphasized the impor
tance of mobilizing students. The Executives are
considering launching a Courseßank-style Web
site to help students explore volunteer service
organizations in an effort to attract students to
campus service.
"We hope that we can engage students that
typically aren't engaged." Gobaud said.
De la Torre also stressed that the combination
of input from the Executive cabinet and the stu
dent body at large could help the ASSU create
more innovative solutions to student concerns.

"It's about getting the entire campus to buy in
on the things we're doing," de la Torre said. "I
think a lot of that will be soliciting feedback and
suggestions from as much of the student body as
possible to feel that sense of ownership and con
tribution to making things happen."
The new ASSU chiefs noted a weakness in
past administrations to inspire involvement
among graduate students and they thus intend to
create cohesion between graduate and under
graduate communities.
The team hopes to maintain strong and trans
parent communication between themselves and
the student body by publicly disclosing progress
