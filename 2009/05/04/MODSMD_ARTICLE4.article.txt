## '60s anti-war movement reunited 
### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
The unassuming black door of Building 10. beveled
and framed by sandstone like any other around the
Quad, has seen more than its fair share of action.
At noon yesterday, several dozen alumni and current
students marched to Building 10 and nailed an informal
indictment against Condoleezza Rice, urging legal
authorities to investigate and prosecute the former
Secretary of State. Rice, who returned to campus during
winter quarter, has begun engaging students amid per
sistent controversy over her role in authorizing the
alleged torture of prisoners during the Bush administra
tion.
"Please-uh. please-uh, no Condoleezza," the protes
tors chanted as they walked ;i familiar route from the Old
Union, past the bookstore, down Lasuen Mall and into
the Quad.
The act was a symbolic, final flourish to a weekend
long reunion organized by anti-war student protestors
from the 1960s and '70s. many of whom had chanted and
marched from Old Union to the University President's
office. 40 years and six months ago. to nail their demands
for Stanford's withdrawal from Vietnam related research

"There are ways to push and
be radical without being
detached from reality."
— PAUL LOEB, A3M member

to that very same door. Al that time, they represented the
Stanford branch of the Students for a Democratic
Society (SOS), which struggled to sever the University's
association with the war effort. By the end of the decade,
they would call themselves the April 3 Movement and
ultimately claim victory for banning classified research

from campus. Defense-related research, however,
remained, as it did on many campuses.
Over 40 years, few have abandoned a commitment to
Left politics, in the roughest sense, although perspectives
have shifted. They were once a few hundred strong, with
sympathizers several times that, and still over 120 close
knit alumni pay their registration dues of $150 and gath
er from across the country, said Lenny Siegel. the organ
izer of the decennial reunions.
The weekend kicked off with a series of speakers at
the Palo Alto Sheraton Hotel on Friday evening and
moved to Tressider Union on Saturday for a full day of
panel sessions. History Prof. Barton Bernstein delivered
the keynote speech on Saturday night.
The reunion lacked the pomp that the University lav
ishes on Alumni Weekend, when the annual sight of con
gregations beneath white tents and autumn sunshine
implicitly suggest to students a path of prosperous stabil
ity and established prestige. Under an overcast sky in the
Old Union courtyard on Sunday morning, an A3M alum
nus speaking to a current junior claimed with a grin that
his generation of alumni classes has consistently donated
the least in the I Iniversity's history due to the deep-nx)t-
Ed antagonism with the administra
tion.
Indeed, those movement mem
bers who went on to venture capital
or banking were largely absent. And
if the stereotype of the University
reunion calls for trophy spouses and
careerist contest, then it fails com
pletely to describe a reunion
nonetheless that was consumed by
hefty political discussion. Barack
Obama's presidential victory loomed
large over the three days. The tone
was largely celebratory.
A number of speakers expressed
optimism and hope in national policy

instead of cynicism or frustration.
Urging grassroots organization was a
common theme.
Phil Trounstine, a political analyst,
hailed progress in American racial
politics and compared the current
atmosphere to his nostalgic student
days during a Saturday discussion.
"We have to stop and think about
what Barack Obama has meant."
Trounstine said several times. "I saw
the same kind of commitment at the
Obama [campaign] office and the
same readiness to break out."
The writer Paul Loeb identified
with Obama. who. as a one-time com

munity organizer, "was in a place
where a lot of us are."
If there was a genuine conviction
in unwavering progressivism among
those in the room, so too was there an
earnestness about retrospection.
"We have to be really, ruthlessly
self-critical," Loeb said. "There was a
revolutionary megalomania. We were
indulging in a fantasy that helped
destroy the movement."
Loeb emphasized a need to moti
vate a younger generation without
alienating them.
"There are ways to push and be
radical without being detached from

reality." Loeb said. "The horizons are
more limited today, and that's a loss,
hut it's much more grounded."
Still, the celebratory, wholehearted
embrace of a Democratic Party politi
cian and thus the state, the willingness
to organize and maneuver within the
body politic and the plea to rethink
the past indicated a sharp retreat
from the radicalism of the '60s that
spanned a much broader view of pol
itics.
Bernstein, the evening speaker,
polled the audience and revealed that
the overwhelming majority consid
ered themselves "radicals" during

their Stanford years and a very select
few thought themselves "liberals."
Forty years on, a few more people
identify as "liberals," several remain
"radicals" or "revolutionaries" but
most now label themselves as "pro
gressives."
After his poll. Bernstein said little
in explicit analysis as the hands went
down, but the point was made.
Outside the banquet hall. David
Hugh. 62, a former leader of SDS who
raised his hand at the roll call of "rev
olutionary," surveyed his former com
rades and classmates.
"I'm a little disappointed." he said.
"As people age, they're not as
involved in organizing. It's a reflec
tion of the ebb of the radical move
ment in general in the U.S., but we've
got to be relevant now."
Hugh's view suggested that despite
their common basic politics, the views
among the members, four decades
later, are hardly monolithic. But there
was a sense, perhaps, that much of the
shift in perspective came after many
movement members continued their
personal efforts for progressive caus
es well into middle age but found suc
cess through established, though lim
iting, mechanisms. In aligning their
fundamental beliefs, personal history
and the wisdom of age, the movement
members each found their own
answers.
On Sunday morning outside Old
Union. Siegel waited for his former
comrades to gather before heading to
President Hennessey's office.
"I don't agree with those guys who
said 'look at us. we're over the hill,"'
Siegel said, minutes before delivering
a lighthearted speech and briskly
leading the pack of several dozen
people to Building 10. "I'm at the top
of my game."

self-critical," Loeb said. "There was a
revolutionary megalomania. We were
indulging in a fantasy that helped
destroy the movement."
Loeb emphasized a need to moti
vate a younger generation without
alienating them.
"There are ways to push and be
radical without being detached from

reality." Loeb said. "The horizons are
more limited today, and that's a loss,
hut it's much more grounded."
Still, the celebratory, wholehearted
embrace of a Democratic Party politi
cian and thus the state, the willingness
to organize and maneuver within the
body politic and the plea to rethink
the past indicated a sharp retreat
from the radicalism of the '60s that
spanned a much broader view of pol
itics.
Bernstein, the evening speaker,
polled the audience and revealed that
the overwhelming majority consid
ered themselves "radicals" during

their Stanford years and a very select
few thought themselves "liberals."
Forty years on, a few more people
identify as "liberals," several remain
"radicals" or "revolutionaries" but
most now label themselves as "pro
gressives."
After his poll. Bernstein said little
in explicit analysis as the hands went
down, but the point was made.
Outside the banquet hall. David
Hugh. 62, a former leader of SDS who
raised his hand at the roll call of "rev
olutionary," surveyed his former com
rades and classmates.
"I'm a little disappointed." he said.
"As people age, they're not as
involved in organizing. It's a reflec
tion of the ebb of the radical move
ment in general in the U.S., but we've
got to be relevant now."
Hugh's view suggested that despite
their common basic politics, the views
among the members, four decades
later, are hardly monolithic. But there
was a sense, perhaps, that much of the
shift in perspective came after many
movement members continued their
personal efforts for progressive caus
es well into middle age but found suc
cess through established, though lim
iting, mechanisms. In aligning their
fundamental beliefs, personal history
and the wisdom of age, the movement
members each found their own
answers.
On Sunday morning outside Old
Union. Siegel waited for his former
comrades to gather before heading to
President Hennessey's office.
"I don't agree with those guys who
said 'look at us. we're over the hill,"'
Siegel said, minutes before delivering
a lighthearted speech and briskly
leading the pack of several dozen
people to Building 10. "I'm at the top
of my game."

Lenny Siegel, member of the April 3 Movement in 1969, nails a letter of grievances to the door of Building 10 in the Quad. The letter was an informal indict
ment against Condoleezza Rice, urging legal authorities to investigate and prosecute the former Secretary of State. Rice, who returned to campus during
winter quarter, has been engaging students amid controversy over her role in authorizing the alleged torture of prisoners during the Bush administration.
