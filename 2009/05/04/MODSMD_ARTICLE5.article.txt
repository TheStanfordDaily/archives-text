## O-Show cut due to tight budget for NSO A 						cappella groups no longer receive early housing in fall for event 
### AMY HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
Beginning next year, the O-Show will be a no-show,
as confirmed by the Office of Student Activities (OSA)
and Freshman's Dean Office (FDO). In yet another
attempt to tighten University purse strings, funds for
the New Student Orientation (NSO) event in Memorial
Auditorium were axed, striking a discordant note with
many in the a cappella community.
Edith Wu-Nguyen "99. director of New Student
Programs in the FDO.said that the large NSO programs
held in Memorial Auditorium cost the University thou
sands of dollars each to produce. When cuts to NSO
were considered this year, it was decided that the O-
Show was expendable.
"In deciding which to cut. we looked at which pro
grams align most closely with NSO's mission," Wu-
Nguyen said. "In this context, when viewed alongside
Faces, Real World, Iliree Books
and Discover Stanford, the O-
Show was the obvious program to
cut."
"The loss of O-Show is unfortu
nate. but I understand and support
the need for Orientation to focus
on what it considers are its core
programs amidst difficult budget
decisions," wrote Troy Steinmetz,
assistant director of Student
Activities, in an email to The
Daily.
Wu-Nguyen said that while the
economic crisis is a big driver of
this decision, the $16,000 O-Show
price tag was not the fundamental
issue. Before the economy soured,
NSO leadership had begun debat
ing why a cappella groups were
given the special opportunity to
perform in Memorial Auditorium
when other arts groups don't have
access to such an opportunity.
"Had the economic crisis not
hit, it's likely we would have
changed the O-show into a per
forming arts showcase featuring
some music, some dance, some
theater, etc.." Wu-Nguyen said.
Originally called A Cappella Fest
and then renamed the O-Show in
2002, Stanford's a cappella groups
began the now-hallowed NSO tradi
tion in 1992, according to Wu-
Nguyen's records. Per tradition,
Stanford's nine a cappella groups
perform two songs each for the
incoming freshman, amid waving
Hags and dorm cheers. The high
intensity environment provides a
chance to expose freshmen to
Stanford's musical sampling, and is
followed by auditions the next week.
"The O-Show is incredibly
important for auditions," said
Vinney Le '11. business manager
of Talisman. "When [Memorial
Auditorium] gets filled with all the
freshmen, and they are waving
their flags and going crazy, it's just
a really easy and essential and effi
cient way of exposing them to all
that we have."
Steinmetz and Wu-Nguyen are
cognizant of a cappella groups'
reliance on the O-Show for
recruits, and are planning a meet
ing with a cappella leadership
later this month to discuss the
impact on the auditions schedule,
which has previously been based
on the date of O-Show.
"We're committed to finding a
timeline that meets the needs of
the groups and is sensitive to the
goals of Orientation," Steinmetz
said, "and we'll do what we can to
lessen the impact for those groups
most effected, including helping
secure audition space."
Ben Lauing, a member of
Stanford Harmonics and point
person representing the a cappella
groups in talks with the OSA and
FDO, said that while the effort is
still in its preliminary stages, a cap
pella groups are working with the
OSA to develop an O-Show
equivalent that will be independ
ent of NSO.
Lauing and Le say that they are
hoping to have a show the
Monday of the first week of school
and are considering alternative
venues like Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
The nine a cappella groups plan
on splitting the cost for the show
through independent funds, Le
explained, but he noted that they
are hardest hit by the lack of early
housing due to the cancellation of
O-Show.
"It's not fair, if Stanford's going
to ask us to perform like we usual
ly do, but doesn't give us the time
or ability to sing to our full poten
tial if we're not on campus togeth
er. singing." Le said.
Previously, when O-Show was
in te lineup, a cappella members
returned to Stanford the Sunday
before NSO to practice and get
back into the swing of performing.
Housing for more than 70 a cap
pella members, Wu-Nguyen
explained, was preset by adminis
tration.
Le explained that for Talisman,
specifically, the early housing pro
vided an invaluable time to recruit
and perform at NSO activities.
"A lot of us have joked about
having all the a cappella groups
come and pitch tents in White
Plaza," Le laughed. "We have
talked about staying with our
members at their homes who live
in the Bay Area —we would all
come and sleep on their floors."
Yet while Le noted the great
loss of the O-Show to a cappella
groups themselves, he thinks the
freshmen will be the ones to suffer.
"All the a cappella groups are
so different and we need a way to
get our message and feel out there,
so that people can audition," Le
said. "Without O-Show, I don't
think people can get a feel of that
when they are walking through
White Plaza and all of us are
screaming at the freshmen, blast
ing our own music, and telling
them to come audition for us.
when they don't know who we are
or what we stand for."
