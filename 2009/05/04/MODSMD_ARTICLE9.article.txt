## EDITORIAL Students should give more consideration to gap years 
### 
Y" "oil spend youi liisi weeks at Stanford
learning to scream your graduating
class \ear at the lop of your lungs, pre
suming it's a given. I )i illed into your head is
the idea that a headfirst plunge into four
yeais of fast paced academic rigor is the best
trajectory for you and all of the other first
years, when in reality thai just may not be the
case.
I he ediloi ial board would like to urge an
option available to you throughout your
academic career that may seem counter
intuitive in thiseraol hyper productivity.but
can actually serve to enhance your academic
career with little 01 no negative impact on
yourdegiee ptogiessin the lom> term. I hat
option is the "gap year."
I he phenomenon of taking a gap year is
known by many names.including leave of ab
sence. year out. stopping out and various
other pseudonvnis that seem to imply that
taking a break lioni Stanford is like taking a
giant step into a black hole. I ear and stigma
slu oud the idea, as if Stanford flints the gates
on you il you consider taking a break to do
something else lot a while, lint the editorial
board is here to dispel the myth that taking a
leave of absence is a permanent or drastic
break from acadcmia and shed light on the
number ofcxciting ways you can sei/e life and
legain the piz/a// necessary to flourish at
St: 11 ford with a temporary leave of absence.
Particularly in the grim economic times
we lace, we may be wise to follow the lead of
oui I uropean peers, w ho take gap years far
more readily and use the opportunity to
work. volunteer and travel w liile still free of
"real world responsibilities. In a recent sur
vev, almost a quarter ol students in the Unit
ed Kingdom ages I ft to IS s;iid tliev hoped to
take a year oil of sclu>ol for travel, work 01
volunteering.
I or those ol us here at Stanford, there are
opi ' <i (unities abound to take volunteer po

sit ions in Africa, work abroad or domestical
ly or spend time in a non-academic pursuit
lor a time. Many students who take advan
tage of a gap year in this way find that they
come hack to school refreshed and more
aware of where their academic interests lie.
I "lie experiences they gain lend intention to
their pursuits, allowing them to avoid the
costly mid-term academic career switches
and the crises that can make the precious
time you have at Stanford hectic or unex
pectedly problematic.
Stanford also has extremely flexible and
generous policies for students choosing to
take time oil from the 112 arm, no matter what
their inspiration may be. Students who take
a leave of absence from the University vol
untarily on or before the first day of classes
of any term receive a full tuition refund and
are exempt from paying room and board for
whatever period of time they are not on
campus. When the time is right, returning to
school is equally simple. Students w ho take a
leave of absence have the full privileges of
returning students whenever they notify the
administration of their plan to come back,
and many resources — from Counseling
and Psychological Services (CAPS) to Dis
ability Housing Services — are on board to
make sure students who have taken a med
ical leave of absence have the smoothest
transition back to school possible.
laking time oil before completing a four
year degree is by no means right for every
one, and the majority of students screaming
their graduation year in Memorial Auditori
um that first week of classes may find that
graduation cannot come quickly enough.
Hut for those of you who do not feel like a
race to the finish line is the way you want to
pursue your undergraduate degree, know
that stopping out is both feasible and afford
able. and that Stanford will welcome you
back whenever vou make the call.
