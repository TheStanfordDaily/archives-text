-1 need an iClimate.
Seriously, if Apple's not busy, 1 have a job
for some really good interface designers.
I will also accept a teani of die-hard
SymSys kids. CS kids or the type of EE that
specializes in hardware design and then goes
to work at Google because he can't stand the
idea of working on things no person will di
rectly interact with. (Hi. buddy!)
Here's the deal. Climate protection and
sustainability are extremely difficult to enact,
and not just because of obvious barriers like
"Drag racing is fun" and "Oh man does that
steak smell super." The user interface is all
wrong.
The problem is that we are not taught to
produce in a way that makes use by other
people simplest — we are taught to produce
things as conveniently as possible.
Because we grow up being rewarded for
producing things in ways that make our lives
easier, we never really move past that stage.
If you'll get a better grade on a paper you
write about something you already know,
why would you try to write something new
and radical that may fall flat and that only
you and your professor will read anyway?
So we end up with machines designed to
process bottles submitted for recycling, but
only if the proper bottles are submitted. The
machines are precisely tuned to accept, say.
number 1 plastics. But the bottlers find it eas
ier to make number 1 bottles with resin lids
that aren't recyclable.so the lids become con
tamination. Making food containers out of
number 6 plastics is a bit cheaper, so restau
rants typically buy those. Many upstream de
cisions and processes are simplified, but in
the end? The consumer stands in front of a
recycling bin with precious little chance of re

cycling properly unless he or she has put sub
stantial time and effort into learning the nu
ances of the system.
As an energy engineer. I've been taught
that efficiency improvements at the end of a
chain are the most productive because of an
upstream snowball effect.Take light bulbs
changing out an incandescent for a CFL actu
ally has more substantial impact than it ini
tially appears. Not only are you using less
power at your outlet, hut you're avoiding the
transmission line losses and the generating
losses associated with the power you would
have been using. So reducing consumption
by one unit at the wall outlet is equivalent to
reducing consumption by many units all the
way upstream at the power plant.
It's this kind of thinking that has con
vinced me that we have to focus on sustain
abilitv's user interface. If we put a little more
effort into making more sophisticated recy
cling equipment, or. say. coordinated efforts
by recyclers and by packaging manufacturers
so that products could be both manufactured
and recycled efficiently, it would be much
easier for the public to take part in the sus
tainability movement.
After sucking up the initial pain of a new
system and of actually havingYo get indus
tries to communicate directly, enabling our
systems to interact efficiently would proba
bly not be that technically difficult. The
major issue would be financing the transition
— some sectors would save money and ef
fort, to be sure. Stanford has to hand sort
plastics to avoid contamination, and that's a
lot of work time that could be better used
elsewhere. Hut takeout container manufac
turers would have to cough it up for higher
grade plastic. Overall, we'd be setting our
selves up for simpler manufacturing process

es and ease of recycling instead of downcy
cling. but it would take some serious inter-in
dustry discussion and capital allocation.
I'd rather spend money on this than on
compostable plastics that compost facilities
don't know how to deal with, though.
Additionally, if education campaigns
could use slogans like "Recycle Plastic
Here!" instead of "Check the number on
your plastic container, then call your local re
cycling center to see if they can recycle that
type of plastic, then ensure it's in a shape they
can handle, then put it into the appropriate
bin — careful, there are five of them — and
recycle!" ...
You see what I mean. People would be
less frustrated and more empowered.
Beyond that, we wouldn't have to be
throwing out improperly mixed hags of recy
clables.etc.etc.etc. So the same amount of ef
fort would probably have a greater impact,
since we wouldn't constantly be compensat
ing for mistakes.
This argument and plea goes for many
more things than recyclables. Let's make it
easier to choose to move to mature, superior
technologies. Let's make it so that you don't
have to call the local utility to decide whether
an electric car is a good idea in the city you're
driving through. Let's develop climate poli
cies we like and make sustainability fun.
Killer app. anyone?
