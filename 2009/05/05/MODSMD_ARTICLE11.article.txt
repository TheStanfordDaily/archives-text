The great ideal of the academy is prima
rily that diametrically opposed and
contrarian beliefs can cross swords
and do battle for the betterment of the stu
dent body and humanity at large. Stanford
markets itself, as do other premier educa
tional institutions, as a repository of diverse
and dynamic ideas concerning how to com
prehend the world in which we reside. Be
sides an exalted quality of life and dreams of
immense wealth and luxury, the central draw
of the school is its supposed intellectual vital
ity "To be ignorant of one's ignorance is the
malady of the ignorant," which I believe
speaks to the importance of a solid liberal ed
ucation. though this could be the official slo
gan of the University of Southern California.
Stanford University, or at least how I took
down the Kool-aid.is meant to be welcoming
and receptive to ALL ideologies and creeds.
I lowever, this does not seem to be the actual
case here at the Stan. Last year's presidential
election exemplifies this truth to a tee. In the
name of full discretion, I am a proud, lifelong
Dem. I heard then-Senator Obama speak
two years ago and left the room truly in awe
of the man who seemed uniquely equipped
to lead the nation.
Yet after arriving on campus last year. I
was somewhat appalled at the outright loxic
environment spewing forth from the primar
ies. The energy I felt after hearing the Sena
tor had been perverted by a variety of
Obama-nistas into this smug self-righteous
ness that brutally attacked anyone w ho stood
against them. If it was not for the fact that I
couldn't stand Howard Wolfson and some
crap coming out of the Clinton campaign, I
would have seriously supported I lillary, if for
no other reason than to go against w hat came
across as a cult-like atmosphere pervading
the campus.
ITie general election was less worse, but
only slightly. I recall a frosh in the fall quar
ter.One unit CSRL-sponsored "Presidential
Politics" class trying to argue that HRC sup
porters were more likely to be racist, where
by I excoriated the chap for a few solid min
utes. And while I derisively mocked Gover-

I did not come to Stanford to

thou contempt for those
whose top priorities arerit in
lock step with the residents
of Palo Alto.

nor Sarah Palin because 1 legitimately be
lieve her to be an idiot. I still held ;i degree of
sympathy for actual McCain voters, whose
active support for their candidate was akin to
large-scale public suicide. With the Hoover
Institute. Condi, an incredible econ depart
ment and an inseparable marriage to Silicon
Valley's entrepreneurialism. Stanford, more
so than most of our peer institutions, has a de
cidedly less liberal bent, liven so. I"he Stan
ford Review and Stanford Conservative So
ciety had to hold its election-watching
party/wake off campus at the I Iniversitv Ave.
Round Table. HOORAY. PUBLIC'DIS
COURSE!
Such behavior, however, goes far beyond
the charged 2(X)X presidential election. I have
a variety of incredibly intelligent, well rea
soned and articulate friends who happen to
be more moderate, or *gasp*. conservative
than your average college student. Generally
speaking, only in small gatherings or private

discussions do such students actually feel
comfortable in expressing their beliefs. The
Review seems to occasionally pick absurdist
and highly contentious fights simply for the
hell of it. but the greater campus populace
summarily dismisses their views, regardless
of their persuasiveness or merit.
Issues regarding the emphases placed on
sustainability and \ar\ing conceptions of di
versity seem to be the third rails of campus
life: dare to even foster a healthy discussion,
and the responses are often less than cordial.
Disallowing issues from even being thrown
about in the public square, besides increasing
the tyranny of the majority, breeds intellectu
al stasis. I did nyt come to Stanford to lounge
in some plush, vaguely liberal echo chamber,
to wallow in holier-than-thou contempt for
those whose top priorities aren't in lock step
with the residents of Palo Alto.
I firmly believe in a woman's right to
choose, same-sex marriage as a civil rights
issue and public education as a fundamental
right for all Americans. However, this cam
pus needs to foster lively discussions on such
issues so that the focus is not on demoniza
tion.but rather on civil discourse vsith the po
tential to establish intellectual common
ground
What are we afraid of. folks? That the be
liefs we steadfastly cling to might not hold up
in the face of reasonable opposition? That
those \\ho might not fully agree with our be
liefs are racist, anti-environment or just less
er human beings? At an institution like Stan
ford, if we cannot be open to the ideas or be
liefs of others, if we cannot learn from the
varied experiences of those around us. we are
damned to shape a world that demands or
thodoxy, devalues minority opinions and re
jects intellectual diversity. In short, civiliza
tion as we know it will become one big I ISC.
