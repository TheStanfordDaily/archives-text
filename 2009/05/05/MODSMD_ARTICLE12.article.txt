### ANARGHYA VARDHANA STAFF WRITER 
Several members of the Cardinal track
and field team had amazing performances,
and even broke records, when Stanford host
ed the Payton Jordan Invitational this past
weekend.
Leading the way for the Cardinal were the
distance runners, led by freshman Chris Der
rick, who highlighted the meet by breaking
the American junior record in the 5,000 me
ters with a time of 13 minutes. 29.98 seconds.
The race was initially very close between
Derrick and Oklahoma State freshman Ger
man Fernandez. Derrick created a gap be
tween them in the final three laps, distancing
himself from Fernandez, while shattering the
previous record — held by 2008 U.S.
Olympian and current Oregon runner Galen
Rupp — by almost eight seconds. Derrick's
time is also the fifth-fastest time in the
NCAA this year.
"It was incredible to run a race like that in
front of all of my friends, my family, and on
my home track," Derrick said. "The great
competition to both win the race and get the
record only elevated the already tremendous
racing atmosphere."
Also faring well in the event was fifth-year
Hakon DeVries, who achieved a personal
best and regional-qualifying time of 14:03.64.
Fifth-year Garrett Heath finished third in
the collegiate division of the 1,500, moving
him to third in the NCAA rankings. His time
of 3:37.57 was also a personal best, and the
fifth best in Stanford history. Sophomore El
liot Heath followed in his brother's footsteps,
running a personal best and regional-qualify
ing time of 3:43.10 in the same race.
Senior Chris Mocko also ran a personal
best in the 3.000 steeplechase, placing fourth
in the event with a time of 8:50.30, which was

also a regional standard and the eighth
fastest in Stanford history.
The male sprinters were led bv freshman
Amaechi Morton, who won both the 400 hur
dles with a time of 50.23 seconds, and the
open 400 with a time of 47.23 seconds.
"1 need to learn how to get out a little
harder," Morton said of the improvements he
hopes to make. "However. I am glad with my
consistency and happy with my race."
Leading the men in the field events was
senior Daniel Schaerer. whose toss of 199
feet, four inches was a personal best and re

gional-qualifying standard. Schaerer's mark
also places him second on the all-time Stan
ford list. Another thrower who achieved a re
gional standard was freshman Geoffrey
Tabor with a toss of 55-3 in the shot put.
The women were also led by the distance
runners, with senior Lauren Centrowitz tying
the Stanford school record in the 1,500 with a
time of 4:10.42. Centrowitz's time was the
third-fastest this year in the NCAA.
Also faring well in the same event and
achieving regional standards were senior Ali
cia Follmar and freshman Laurvnne Chete-
