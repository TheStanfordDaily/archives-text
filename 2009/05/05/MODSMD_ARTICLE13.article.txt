# WOMEN'S RUGBY
## Card sees familiar foe, unfamiliar result Stanford loses to Penn State in championship 
### JACOB JAFFE DESK EDITOR 
For the fifth year in a row. the Stan
ford women's rugby team found itself
in the championship game, and for the
fifth year in a row. its opponent was
Penn State. For only the second of
those five years, though, the Cardinal
did not finish victoriously.
The women's rugby team, a club
team comprising about 40 girls, has
been one of Stanford's most success
ful programs in recent years, winning
three of the past four national titles
and placing second the other year.
The start of Stanford's run coincided
with its hiring of head coach
Jonathan Griffin, a former player
and coach in Ireland and the United
Kingdom. Griffin and his team came
into this season expecting more of
the same success.
"Our goal was to win the champi
onship, plain and simple." Griffin
said. "We felt we were good enough.
You have to set high goals and work
hard to achieve them."
Stanford entered the national
playoffs as the first seed from the Pa
cific Coast Conference. After domi
nating UCLA 81-10 in the Sweet 16
and edging Army 29-15 in the round
of eight, the Cardinal advanced to
the Final Four, which was held in
nearby Palo Alto this past weekend.
In Stanford's semifinal game
against Brown on Friday, the Cardi
nal ran up against tough opposition,
particularly in the early goings.
"Brown is a very physical team,"
said senior hooker/flanker Diana
Peng. "They play a very contact
heavy game, but we sustained really
hard defense against it."
With just 12 minutes left in the
game, the Cardinal held a slim 17-12
lead. The Stanford women respond
ed with 14 points in the game's final
minutes to cruise to a 19-point win
over Brown.
"[Against Brown] we forced them
to chase us wide and play in space,"
Griffin said. "We moved the ball
away from channel one and channel
two and used our team speed. We
were comfortable in the open field."
The win over Brown moved Stan
ford into the national championship
game on Saturday against Penn
State, which had blanked Navy 33-0
in the semifinals.

Penn State proved to be a tough
opponent for the Cardinal to handle.
The Cardinal hung with the Nittany
Lions for the first half of the champi
onship game, trailing only 12-7 at
halftime. In the second half, though.
Penn State exploded for 34 points, in
cluding five tries (rugby's equivalent
of touchdowns) in the final 25 min
utes of the game. Meanwhile, the
Cardinal could not manage a single
point after the 15-minute mark of the
game, allowing Penn State to run
away with a 46-7 win.
One main reason for the lopsided
second half was the three yellow cards
given to the Cardinal, which caused
the team to play down one player for
over 20 minutes of the game.
"We were under pressure the
whole game, so we were trying to
force things," Griffin said.
One of the bright spots for the
Cardinal was fifth-year inside center
Melissa Smit.
"She was simply magnificent —
she played absolutely brilliantly,"
Griffin said. "Her defense, her tack
ling, her leadership, her desire to get
back up and keep going and track
people down were sensational."
However. Penn State's forma
tions and strength were too much for
the Cardinal from the beginning, al
lowing only one try in the whole
game.
"Penn State had a group of senior
players who are very good, and that
gave them a wealth of experience,"
Griffin said. "They set a platform up
front we could not compete with,
which allowed the back line to domi
nate."
The loss is a disappointing end to
an otherwise successful season for
the Cardinal rugby team.
"Though we didn't achieve the
outcome we wanted, this group and
these experiences were something
life-changing to be a part of," Peng
said.
