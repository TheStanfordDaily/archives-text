# Trust issues in A-Rod exposś

Kind printing gratuitous drivel. What is

In the case of Alex Rodriguez, the em
battled New York Yankees slugger.every
thing.Or,at least that's the case that Sports
Illustrated's Selena Roberts presents in
her book, "A-Rod: The Many Lives of
Alex Rodriguez," which hit stands yester
day.
Roberts uses her status as the whistle
blower on Rodriguez's steroid abuse earli
er this year to pen this unauthorized biog
raphy. She spares no detail in examining
Rodriquez's life — she mentions every
thing from pitch tipping to steroids to his
affinity for wearing Yankees hats in strip
clubs to being abandoned by his father.and
that's just what the publishers released
early.
Roberts wants to paint a picture of the
man, but given the nature of the book
namely, that it relies heavily on anony
mous sources, and A-Rod has already
cried foul over its allegations — is it really
possible todoit in a responsible.journalis
tic manner?
Little gotcha facts like A-Rod's fond
ness of strippers are ancillary and unnec
essary points that do little but defame the
man; the more serious charges are that he
tipped pitches while in Texas, and Ux>k
steroids as far back as high sch(X)l and
through his days as a Yankee.That is rele
vant information for baseball fans, while
the off-field actions are. frankly, none of
our business.
But am we trust Roberts? Her report
ing of Rodriguez's steroid use in February
grants her some leeway, but whereas she
was quoting a report back then, she is
mainly reiving on nameless individuals
now. Since Watergate, anonymous
sources have become a fixture of Ameri
can journalism, and Roberts uses them at
will. But when people refuse to go on the
record, denials become easier—Buck
Showalter, Rodriguez's former manager
in Texas, laughed off allegations that A-
Rod tipped pitches. Pitch tipping is a seri
ous offense, one that should offend base
ball fans far more than steroid usage — it
true, it is a transgression on a Pete Rose
level, it is not something that can be stated
without l()0 percent certainty. Roberts
thinks she's right, and I doubt she would
publish if she didn't, but until a player
comes forth in sup[X)rt of Roberts' claims,
it's her word as an outside observer
against a man who coached A-Rod, day
to-day, for a year.
Additionally, Roberts is not infallible
— indeed, while at The New York Times,
she was the poster child for overeager
press coverage during the Duke lacrosse
rape trial. She led the rush to accuse and.
when it turned out that the athletes were
innocent, refused to apologize for equat
ing the students to gangsters and drug
dealers, instead blaming the District At
torney for leading the press down an er-.
rant path.The media'sactionsthroughout
the ordeal were reprehensible —
Roberts' in particular — but instead of
being punished.she received a spot at the
nation's most historic sports magazine.
Scoring first on the A-Rod steroids story
doesn't erase her history.
rhere is enough of a lack of certainty
about her sources that fellow media
members have been taking Roberts to
task all week. Jason Whitkx:k. writing in
The Kansas City Star,said,"The majority
of the stuff written in herlxxik is informa
tion the National Enquirer might reject."
()thers,such asWFAN's C Yaig C arton.g(>
after her for what is perceived as a hatch
et job that resembled her work on the
Duke case.
It's the essential problem with an
unauthorized work that relies on anony
mous sources and general observations
— the truth of its claims is very much un
certain. But a larger problem exists: Even
if Roberts' accusations are not proven be
yond a doubt.there is little that Rcxlriguev

the state of the modem press — with little
threat of libel suits, anything g(x.*\ from al
legations of cheating to unnecessary and
invasive l<x>ks into the lives of others.
Egregious errors are met with job offers,
