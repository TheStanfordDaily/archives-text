## PROF. TAKES SERVICE AWARD 
### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Education Prof. Linda Darling-
Hammond will take home a top
honor from the Haas Center for
Public Service for her efforts locally
and beyond.
Darling-Hammond is the recipient
of the Miriam Aaron Roland
Volunteer Service Prize, according to
The Stanford Report. The prize "rec
ognizes Stanford faculty who engage
and involve students in integrating
academic scholarship with significant
and meaningful volunteer service to
society."
Darling-Hammond has been
heavily involved in both the Stanford
community and Palo Alto. In addition
to founding the Stanford Leadership
Institute, Darling-Hammond has also
served as a faculty sponsor at the East
Palo Alto Academy, which she also
aided in founding. The Academy, a
public school, graduates 90 percent of
its students, which The Report refers
to as "unheard of for its area."

National education policy and
education reform efforts have also
been a part of Darling-Hammond's
work, including instrumental efforts
in the 1990s that included her book
"What Matters Most: Teaching for
America's Future." She focused par
ticularly on establishing the incen
tives that are often necessary to
attract quality teachers to lower
income areas.
More recently, she has served as
an education adviser to President
Obama during both his election cam
paign and his transition.
