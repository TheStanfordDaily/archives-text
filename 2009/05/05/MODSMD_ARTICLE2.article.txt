For once, a lack of certainty on the gridiron may he

two sessions of practice over and the spring game
in the btx>ks. the Cardinal has solidified a few
starters, but not out of anything negative —

intense position battles and the further emergence of
young players has led to challenges for even
entrenched, older Cardinal players. I
"We came charging out through each spring 112
practice — it was very intense," said head coach Jim
1 larbaugh. "It was hard to tell the first practice from
the 12th practice. It was highly competitive the whole
time."

There were 14 practices in total, spread out from February
24 to March 9, and from April 1 to the spring game on April
13. which was an inter-squad scrimmage conducted under

game-like conditions. In any given practice, coaches
would have players face off in position drills or
I larbaugh would bring them together for 7-on-7 or 11-
on-11 work.

As a result, players got a significant amount of
time to show off their talent and the results of a win
ter of weight training. With few certifiable stars and
a number of starter departing, this meant that
position battles were .argely up for grabs — from i
quarterback to kicker, depth charts shifted 112.
throughout the spring.

The most notable position battle was quarter
back. where senior Tavita Pritchard, who com
manded the team for the past year and a half, faced

an intense challenge from freshman Andrew Luck. After junior Alex
Loukas went down with an ACL injury, it became a two-man race,
and I uck came out on top after a five-touchdowp performance in the
spring game. I hough he has not definitively won the starting job, he
has jumped from third on the depth chart to first, and will be in the
new position of lending off a challenge from Pritchard in summer

"Andrew was very impressive in the spring game, but he was impres
sive all spring long." Harbaugh said.
While I .uck's performance quickly made news across the Pacific-10
Conference, other players emerged, too. such as freshman wide receiv
er (litis ()wusu. who beat out sophomore Doug Baldwin for a starting
job. The speedster, who missed a number of games last season with an
injury, impressed I larbaugh with his resilience.
"i Ic made huge strides," said Harbaugh, who is entering his third
year at the helm of the program. "1 lis level of competitiveness and

toughness emerged throughout the spring. I le got hit a lot. and wound
up being durable."
But the most hidden, and yet perhaps the most intriguing, story of the
spring was on the defense, and particularly in the back seven, where a
myriad of players are contending for jobs at linebacker and defensive
back.
Any Stanford football fan would reasonably assume that sen
iors Clinton Snyder and Bo McNally.teani leaders in recent years,
would be assured of starting roles. But I larbaugh emphasized that
no one was safe, and indeed that all three linebacker and all four
defensive back starting positions were still undetermined.
Freshman Johnson Bademosi has been pushing McNally at free
safety, while junior Nick Macaluso has been competing with Snyder at
middle linebacker. Meanwhile, the two outside linebacker positions
have no clear frontrunner— sophomores ("hike Amajovi and Max
