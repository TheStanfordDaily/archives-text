# Blood Center faces shortage
## 
### ERIC MESSINGER ESPERANZA GUEVARA 
Cardinal red may he the official color of Stanford, hut
the balance of hlood donations at the University is still in
the red.
The Stanford Blood Center (SBC) is currently facing a
"critical blood shortage" and is continuing its efforts to
increase the incoming supply from the Stanford communi
ty. The shortage is particularly serious for hlood types A
and (), the two most common blood types of the American
population.
Stanford Blood Bank Nurse Jane Gold noted that the
shortages are an ongoing problem in work on campus.
A crucial factor in the periodic shortages is the number
of institutions the SBC is responsible for supplying. The
SBC currently provides hlood donations to Stanford
Medical Center, the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital,
the Palo Alto Veterans' Medical Center, El Camino
I lospital and San Jose's O'Connor I lospital.
"We use more blood in this area than our donors give,"
noted SBC Public Relations Associate Brooke Krannich.
According to Krannich, shortages often force the SBC
to import blood from other locations.
"We do have to import blood from other parts of from
parts of the country," Krannich said, " flic Midwest is gen
erally a place that has more blood than they need."
"When I say typically, it's not all the time," she added.
The level of travel among the Stanford community, as
well as its international character, also causes problems for
the SBC by preventing contributions from potential
donors.
"Another reason there's a blood shortage is because of
the available blood pool," Gold said. "Anybody born in
F.urope is deferred because of mad cow disease. People
who have traveled to malarial countries â€” India, the
Philippines, Beli/e, 1 londuras. [This happens], especially in
the Stanford community, because we have so many foreign
students and people who travel."
Gold also pointed to the variety of complex medical
procedures conducted in local hospitals.
"Stanford Hospital does a lot of liver transplants [and|
heart transplants," Gold said.'in March, we had to [trans
port] 7.(XX) units of blood because of a lot of liver trans
plants. heart transplants and premature babies."
The SBC holds periodic blood
drives on campus in addition to
accepting donations throughout the
week. Monday saw a visit by the
Mobile Blood Van to Roble and
Lagunita Court following a recent
stop at White Plaza.
Gold said she is generally pleased
at the response from the Stanford
community when drives occur on
campus.
"The Stanford community
donates a lot," she said. "Whenever
we have the Blood Mobile, a lot of
students come."
Still, the SBC staff expressed a
hope that more members of the
Stanford community would con
tribute.
"I know people here are really
busy," Krannich said, "but they're
busy all over the country."
