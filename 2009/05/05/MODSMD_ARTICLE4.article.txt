# Law profs. eyed for Supreme Court
## Kathleen Sullivan, Pamela Karlan on many short lists 
### ERIC MESSINGER DESK EDITOR 
Stanford Law Profs. Kathleen Sullivan and
Pamela Karlan are rumored to he under con
sideration for President Obama's pick to
replace Supreme Court Justice David Souter,
according to numerous media reports.
Word leaked late Thursday night that
Souter plans to retire as of the Court's summer
recess. ITie retirement is the first under the
Obama administration, and will result in the
first appointment under a Democratic presi
dent in 15 years.
In discussions of likely prospects for who
President Obama will nominate. Law Prof, and
former Dean Kathleen Sullivan has placed
prominently on short lists of potential candi
dates. and has been discussed as a possible
pick since before Obama was elected. Sullivan
is a constitutional law scholar, and also has
research interests in federal litigation and.
appropriately, the Supreme Court.
According to Academe Today, an internal
publication put out by the Stanford Law
1 .ibrary which tracks mentions of Stanford fac
ulty and alumni in national discourse,
Sullivan's name has come up in short lists by
The New York l imes. The Washington Post,
The Wall Street Journal. Politico. The London
Times and Ihe National Law Journal.
Local papers have also noted the possibili
ty of Sullivan as a choice, with The San
Francisco Chronicle dedicating a prominent
editorial to a recommendation on her behalf.
The Chronicle was effusive in its praise, saying
that "She is perhaps the best intellectually
qualified person to replace Justice Souter. Her
work, particularly in the New Federalist

Papers, reveals a mind able to grasp and
explain the interplay between technology,
social change and the Constitution. Kathleen
Sullivan is the perfect choice, and the fact that
she's lesbian should not be an issue for any
one."
Sullivan served as Law School dean from
1999-2004, and was the first woman to serve as
the dean of any Stanford school.
Stanford Law Professor Pamela Karlan is
also being mentioned in discussions of possi
ble nominees. The New York Times reported
that Karlan "co-wrote an election law text
book that Mr. Obama not only taught from
but also contributed comments to when it was
in draft form."
While at the Farm. Karlan has founded the
Stanford Supreme Court Litigation Clinic,
which provides an opportunity for students to
get substantive practice in arguing cases. Like
Sullivan, Karlan studies Constitutional law.
and also studies public interest law. among
other research interests.
Fitting with the possibility of either Sullivan
or Karlan. Obama's pick is "a choice many
political observers expect will be a woman."


CRIS BAUTISTA/
The Stanford Daily
according to a New York Times
report. Most of the other legal lumi
naries considered to be in contention
for the spot, including U.S. Court of
Appeals Second Circuit Judge Sonia
Sotomayor. are also women.
In the event that President
Obama were to tap a Stanford facul
ty member, he or she would join a
Court already filled with Stanford
connections. Justices Anthony
Kennedy '58 and Stephen Breyer '59
both received bachelor's degrees at
the University. Justice Antonin
Scalia was a visiting professor at the

Law School decades ago, and Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg was also a fel
low at the Center for Behavioral
Sciences. 1977-1978.
The Daily attempted contact with
both Sullivan and Karlan, but they
were not reached for comment.
"There are a number of Stanford
Law School faculty and alumni who
may be considered for upcoming
judicial appointments, including the
Supreme Court of the United
States," wrote Assistant Director of
Communications Tayla Klein in an
email to The Daily. "As a matter of
policy, we do not comment on spec
ulation surrounding these appoint
ments."
