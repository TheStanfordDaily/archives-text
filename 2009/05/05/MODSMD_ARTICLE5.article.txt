## Dollies make a splash 
### MOLLY SPAETH 
( i S '"v ut with the old!"
"In with the new!"
"Out with the old!"
"In with the new!"
Clad in outfits ranging from gold lamae pants and a sil
ver bikini top to a piano keyboard-print vest and bright
blue Hawaiian shorts, members of the Band engaged in
a back-and-forth shouting match as they ushered in the

2009-2010 Stanford Dollies at Dolliesplash last Friday
under a rainy sky.
"I've been drunk since 10!" one Band member yells
across the crowd in front of the Bookstore.
"Me too!" his friend shouts back.
It was a little past noon, and Dolliesplash was
already underway.
Traditionally, Dolliesplash marks the time of transi
tion when the previous year's Dollies relinquish their
title to the newest Dollies. This year's Dollies are Shea
Ritchie '12. Nia Amina-Minor '12, Paula Markey '10,
Kim Sou/a 'II and Klise Birkhofer '12. During each
Dolliesplash. the new Dollies make their debut to the
Band and the Stanford community by performing a
variety of dances. At the end, the girls are traditionally
thrown into the Claw. Hence the name. Dolliesplash.
"Yeah, dollies! You're so beautiful!" a former
Dollie yells to the girls as they line up for their next
dance. With a beaming smile. Ritchie acknowledges the
support and starts to dance.
The new Dollies have clearly put care into making
their debut the best that they can. Dressed in white
dresses with red-jeweled embroidery, white Nikes with
red swooshes and white dancing gloves, the new
Dollies perform 10 dances. A few are traditional, and
some are based on their own choreography. All of
them, however, are met with applause from an enthu
siastic crowd.
"Go Kim!" one onlooker shouts.
Although it is apparent that the intense bouts of
dancing are taking a toll on the girls' stamina, the ener
gy that radiates from the Band and the crowd seems to
give the new Dollies the extra push they need to per
form. That's not to say that the girls are performing the
whole time. With occasional instrumental interludes
provided by the Band, the Dollies spend some time re
grouping in the back and giving their red Nike swoosh
es a chance to take a break.
During the middle ol the show. Dollies past and
present re-group for one of the most memorable events
of Dolliesplash — the Dollie alumni performance.
"This is amazing!" one Stanford sweatshirt-clad
freshman exclaims as the former Dollies, from different
years and different backgrounds, come together and
perform for the crowd.
It really is a sight to see, as around 20 girls come
together to perform a dance that had been, at least at
one point, very prevalent in their lives as Dollies. While
some former Dollies are dressed in tights and blue clit-

tor jackets, others look as if they had just come from an
11 a.m. Friday morning history section, beige boots and
.ill.
But although their dress may differ, as soon as the
Hand starts playing the familiar chords of years past,
the traditional moves and smiles from the women all
meld into seamless choreography.

going on. but hear something about Crayola costumes.
Nevertheless, the Hand and Dollies have attracted
quite a crowd around the Claw. The event seems to be
a success.

The Dollies made their debut at Dolliesplash last Friday.
Their dance consisted of new choreography, as well as
routines from past years.

However, there is one problem.
"Dude, there's no water in the fountain," says an
onlooker.
"Yeah. I thought it was supposed to be
DoIIieSPLASH," replies his freshman friend.
Some of the spectators who have seen
Dolliesplash in previous years, too, wonder exactly
what this unforeseen lack of flowing fountain water
is going to have on the girls' baptismal-like inaugura
tion.
"What are they going to do? The fountain's not
on," Kate Barber '1 112 says to her boyfriend.
Alas, the lack of water in the fountain on Friday,
due presumably to less-than-ideal weather condi
tions, seems to present a large barrier to fulfilling one
of the most fundamental goals of the event. But in a
sheer stroke of genius, members of the band once
again demonstrate their ingenuity by invoking one of
the most ancient and effective means of transferring
moisture — buckets of water.
After a highly energized and robust round of
"All Right Now." the Dollies happily collapse into
a panting group hug, celebrating the finale of an
event they have been working toward for weeks.
They're panting and visibly exhausted, but wearing
sparkling smiles that rival the shine of the glitter
adorned on their dresses. Jacob "Diego" Marshall
'09. however, is one of the first to disrupt this happy
hug of relief.
•'AAAAAAAAHHH!" he shouts with a warrior
like cry as he douses an entire bucket of water over
Minor.
The gil ls scatter. Although it is a little unclear how
many tubs of water the Band has stored within its
depths, they are clearly full of anticipation. But when
the new Dollies pose for a picture, a rally-clad mem
ber of the Band darts out from the back row with
another red bucket. In a tender moment. Wiley
Birkhofer '09 drenches his sister Elise. In true broth
er-sister fashion she pretends to get mad. but then
hugs her brother as they later pose for a picture with
their mom and the Tree, Jonathan Strange '11.
As the crowd scatters, the Dollies are left with
friends and family, dressed in Dollie-emblazoned red
fuzzy bathrobes to warm up. Although their
Dolliesplash has been atypical in the sense that the
"splash" had not come from the fountain, the girls
still maintained their optimism.
"It's supposed to be good luck when it rains on
your wedding day," Ritchie said, "so hopefully it was
a sign that it is going to be a great year."
