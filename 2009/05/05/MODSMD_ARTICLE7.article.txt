## Craft of the Cube Leyan Lo, three-time Rubik's Cube record-holder, reveals how he came to conquer the Cube 
### KATE ABBOTT CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Leyan Lo, a second-year graduate stu
dent in physics, was too young to
experience the original Rubik's Cube
fad during the 1980s. But after getting
involved with the Cube in college, Lo is
immersed in the resurging movement,
with some new twists and turns.
SQUARE ONE
Lo has earned three world records at
competitions since 2005 for events that did
not even exist 20 years ago. After picking
up the Cube during his undergraduate
years at Caltech, Lo has helped turn a pas
sion into an international competition.
Now carrying a Cube with him to most
places, Lo first encountered one in seventh
grade: a teacher at a summer camp assigned
solving the Cube as a final project. After
learning the basic sequences to solving the
first and second layers, he promptly put the
Cube down and pursued other interests.
In Los freshman year of college, friend
and now co-developer of the International
Rubik's Cube Competition Tyson Mao
convinced him to give cubing another try
"[Mao] picked it up at a summer camp
and was really good and got a bunch of
people together and they all solve it really
fast," Lo said.
The duo started a club and generated
enough interest to take a simple hobby to
the next level. Solving the Cube as quickly
as you can is commonly referred to as
"speedcubing," which is now one of the
three main events at competitions.
"At my first competition. 1 solved it in a
little over a minute," Lo said. "1 kept work
ing, and as I learned more algorithms, I got
faster and faster and now I solve it in 12
seconds on average."
DOING THE MATH
The key to the Cube is practice. And
then there are also sequences to learn, pat
terns to memorize and edge pieces to keep
track of. On first glance, the Cube is a fun

and nostalgic toy, but a deeper look with
Lo reveals the science behind the solution.
"[The Cube is] a good thing to have on
your desk when you're bored and you can
sit and play with it," Lo said.
Idle practicing helps to "cut down on
recognition time, which is essential to solv
ing it faster," according to Lo. And it cer
tainly doesn't hurt to know a thing or two
about the math involved.
Lo said that it is a common beginner's
strategy to solve the Cube layer by layer,
and to remember that you're not looking
to move colors, but to move coordinated
edge and corner pieces. There is a pletho
ra of information about basic solving
available on the Internet, especially on
Lo's Web site, www.leyanlo.com.
"There is lots of experimentation with
what is the best method, because no one
knows what that is," Lo said. "At first, cub
ing took up a lot of time mainly because I
was slow and spent a lot more time prac
ticing. [But] there's not that much to do
after you learn a certain point."
. A basic solve involves 100 moves, on
average. According to Lo, a speedcuber
averages 50 to 57 moves for each solve.
And the equipment has changed since
the 1980s, too. Lo showed off his
Speedcube, which had been lubricated and
re-stickered. The center white piece also
features his name.
"After it's been lubricated and broken
in. it turns a lot better than the ones you
get right out of the box," Lo said.
COMPETING
Cubing has become a popular culture
phenomenon in recent years. Rubik's
Cubes saw a surge of popularity following
the release of the movie "The Pursuit of
Happyness" in 2007. Mao taught Will
Smith how to solve the Cube for the
movie, and Smith can now finish it in two
minutes, Lo added.
The development of the International
Rubik's Cube Competition has taken this
popularity to the next level. Lo helped
develop a set of rules and regulations

specifically for competing. Sequences and
illegal moves are defined — and cubing is
no longer child's play.
"It's all easy until you start running a
competition," Lo said. "You think you just
have a stopwatch that you can start and
stop it, but we want to make it really pre
cise. There is a science to it."
Competitions typically feature three
main events: speed solving, one-handed
solving and blindfolded solving. Lo has
held three world records for speed solving
and blindfolded solving. His fastest speed
solve was 11.13 seconds.
"It happens with a lot of practice," Lo
said. "Trying to get the world record in
2006 was a lot different than trying to get
the world record today. In 2006 it was at
11.75, and now it's at 7.8 seconds, so it's
almost twice as fast as what it was."
And things continue to change.
"Back when 1 started, a six-minute
blindfold time was really good," Lo said.

Currently, Lo has no intention of trying
to break more records. Instead, he prac
tices occasionally and helps host events.
When he arrived at Stanford two years
ago. there was nothing like a Rubik's Cube
club. But in August, the U.S. cubing nation
als will be held on campus.
"Right now. I'm trying to get my one
handed time a little faster," Lo said. "I try
to stay on top of the speed solve and my
blindfold solve. I've learned everything
that I want to learn — every now and then
I play around with it."
But Lo continues to solve for fun, and
helps out his friends who are interested in
learning.
"It's always good to have a problem
that no matter how messed up it is,you can
always fix it,"he said.
