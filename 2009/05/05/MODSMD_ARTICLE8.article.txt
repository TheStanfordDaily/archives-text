## EDITORIAL Do not end Stanford as we know it 
### 
Columbia Professor Mark C Taylor's
recent op-ed in ITie New York Times
suggesting that we "Fnd the Universi
ty as We Know It" is one of a long line of cri
tiques of higher education, along with
William Deresiewic/'s "The Disadvantages
of an I lite Education" and Rick Perlstein's
"What's the Matter With College?" Because
these essays ostensibly evaluate our educa
tional experience right here at Stanford, we
wanted to take the opportunity to respond
to Taylor's indictment of universities as over
specialized. impractical and non-collabora
tive.
Stanford, we feel, is none of these things.
While there is some truth to Taylor's assess
ment perhaps more so at some institu
tions than others — one need only look at
the myriad of interdisciplinary and hands-on
departments, majors, programs, fellowships
and courses to see that Stanford University
appreciates both the value of specialized
knowledge and the importance of working
across traditional academic and real-world
divides.
Taylor, for example, proposes restructur
ing curricula, abolishing permanent depart
ments and increasing collaboration between
institutions. Here at Stanford, curricula are
frequently reappraised and restructured.
The history department has voted to remain
in the humanities rather than migrate to the
social sciences. Cultural and Social Anthro
pology and Anthropological Sciences have
engaged in a decade-long process of merg
ing.splitting and reconstitution.a mating rit
ual worthy of anthropological study itself.
That being said, abolishing permanent
departments might be taking things a bit far.
Many Stanford students enjoy being able to
focus their attentions on particular subjects,
and Taylor's proposal to create constantly
evolving "problem-focused programs" —
Mind. Body. Water, Language, Money — is
intriguimi. but does not necessarily appeal to
all.
Stanford welcomes those who prefer to
concentrate on electrical engineering, for ex
ample. rather than ask everyone to reorient
themselves around a given problem. At the
same time, we offer countless opportunities
for that same student to work within multi
ple departments, design his or her own
major, study at other universities addressing
our interests in different ways, collaborate
across departments and work outside of the
I Jniversity setting on specific problems.
Symbolic Systems faculty are drawn from
computer science, linguistics, philosophy,
psychology and education. The Science.
Technology and Society/S I S) program in
cludes a similar range of faculty from depart
ments as diverse as classics, electrical engi
neering. economics, management science
and engineering, English and Cultural and
Social Anthropology.
"Water." one of Taylor's proposed "prob
lem loeused programs." gets a significant
amount ot interdisciplinary attention at the
Bill Lane Center for the American West,
where several recent conferences brought
together environmentalists, farmers, legal
experts, water regulators and other stake
holders. Same noes for the Woods Institute

for the Environment, which lists a series of
Strategic Collaborations within and without
the University — on food security and the
environment with the Freeman Spogli Insti
tute for International Studies, with the
World Wildlife Fund and tllfNature Conser
vancy. and with the Monterey Bay Aquari
um.
I"he interconnectedness of Stanford's
majors, departments and programs is im
pressive. The depth that some students study
in incredibly specialized fields is similarly re
markable. Taylor may decry overspecialized
theses and publishing dissertations, but it
was just such a research project that led
Larry Page and Sergey Brin to develop
Page Rank and later Google.Taylor's sugges
tion to transform traditional dissertations by
using new media such as film and the Web
have been implemented in many PWR2
classes, as well as in Stanford's collaborative
Metamedia "Collaboratory." where stu
dents' final projects are often online and
wiki -based.
We are certainly a university looking to
the outside world and oriented toward real
world applicability, as envisioned by our uni
versity's founders. At the same time, we have
our fair share of philosophy students and lib
eral arts majors happily ensconced in Green
Library and willing to debate Marx at the
drop of a hat. Ibis intellectual diversity is a
strength which the University can draw on as
a foundation for the more interdisciplinary
programs it develops.
Stanford grad students, while perhaps
grumbling about being exploited for cheap
labor, are not the hyper-specialized, hope
lessly unemployable individuals who "will
never hold the kind of job for which they are
being trained" that Taylor contends most
graduate students are. Many will have trou
ble. especially in these economic circum
stances. finding a tenured position, but oth
ers will succeed, and still others will go on to
interesting careers where their undergradu
ate and graduate education will inform their
work and form the basis for their skills.
Professor tenures is a complex issue, and
Taylor is correct that tenure can lead to an
atrophied department, where no one has any
incentive to be productive and professors
merely stand in the way of their graduate
students getting jobs. Yet tenure also allows
professors to speak their minds — to pen
op-eds in major newspapers, for instance —
without fear of retaliation. And judging by
the proliferation of articles in "journals read
by no one other than a few like-minded col
leagues" (and all the students they've ever
taught) — most of Stanford's professors
have not fallen down on the job once they re
ceive tenure.
Thus, we applaud Taylor for leveling his
critique at the field of higher learning in
which he is an active and clearly caring par
ticipant. Such introspection is valuable if we
are to continue refining, improving and even
restructuring our universities. We also ap
plaud Stanford for striking an ideal balance
between specialization and generalization,
collaboration and individuality, liberal arts
and applied sciences and the practical and
the theoretical.
