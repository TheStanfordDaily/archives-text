The April 17 editorial,"Draw revamp as
opaque as Draw itself." had many state
ments that were erroneous and do not accu
rately reflect the work of the Draw Review
Task Force. Students have been asking for
revisions to the Draw for many years, and
we believe that the changes made have been
positively received. I he Draw Review Task
l orce was convened and charged by Shirley
Everett, senior associate vice provost for
Residential & Dining Enterprises (R&DE).
to simplify the Draw and room assignment
policies and processes, to achieve a greater
sense of fairness and to allocate the increas
ing supply of premier housing for upper
class students in support of the Housing
Master Plan. She placed a very high priority
on being inclusive by seeking broad student
faculty and staff input. Shirley also selected
a cross-section of the Stanford community
as committee members, including represen
tatives from R&DE — Student Housing.
VPUE — Freshman Dean's Office, VPSA
— Residential Education and other senior
administrators. The ASSU Nominating
('ommittee was also asked to select students
that represented a cross-section of the un
dergraduate population. The Task Force,
chaired by Rodger Whitney, executive di
rector for Student Housing, met for 10
months to gather input to formulate recom
mended changes to the Draw.
Student input began early in the process.
Every undergraduate student was surveyed
as part of the Student I lousing Annual Sur
vey in January 200 K. and information was
posted on the Student I lousing Web site re
garding the purpose of the committee and
asking students to contact us if they had
input. On Jan. L.we went public,sharing the
proposed changes, and met with the ASSU
council to seek information in a session
which was covered by The Daily ("Senate
hears new Housing. Draw plans," Jan. 28).
We also met with the resident assistants,res
ident fellows, resident deans and Ujamaa
House staff.
At every one of these public meetings
and up until now, there has been broad sup
port for the changes being recommended.
The task force chose to have a town hall
meeting for students, which was very well
publicized, including sending every under
graduate student living in housing an invita
tion. distributing posters throughout cam
pus and running an ad in your newspaper

asking students to attend. In an editorial, the
previous Daily editorial board even encour
aged students to attend the town hall meet
ing. "We call on students to attend the town
hall I lousing officials have in the works and
voice their opinions about changes coming
to residential life at Stanford. This is your
chance to have a real influence on impor
tant decisions at Stanford. Recently dis
cussed revisions are truly promising and we
hope each and every student who so desires
will play a role in providing feedback"
("Housing un-stuffing a welcome change,"
Jan. 30). Student Housing and Residential
Education have met with co-ops, have seri
ously considered their input and have
reached agreement on how assignments to
the co-ops will be made for this year. Your
own poll with results, published April 16.
showed significant support for the Draw
changes.
We also invited members from The Daily
to meet with us on several occasions. In Jan
uary. The Daily met with Greg Boardman.
John Bravman, Shirley Everett and Rodger
Whitney to hear the changes for the Draw
and Master Plan (see resulting Daily story
"Housing to expand," Jan. 30). We also met
with Daily editors and reporters for two
hours, explaining the changes, but much of
that information is yet to be published (see
resulting Daily story "Draw changes yield
concern." April 14). Like all new initiatives,
we will continue to work on improving the
Draw based on the outcome from this year.
We are concerned that the April 17 editori
al, which represented a very small minority
of students, was not helpful to the majority
of students on campus, who very much want
to learn about and make the most of the
newly updated Draw system. The April 22
article, "Draw opens today." also provided
very little concrete information about the
Draw.
We would like to request that you write
an article explaining the Draw changes, and
in so doing provide your readership with
critical information so that they can make
informed decisions w hen applying for hous
ing this year (draw2oo9.stanford.edu).
