## Angry conservatives 
### 
My last column, which ran two weeks
ago, provoked some interesting
emails and comments, mostly from
truly upset conservatives who disagreed with
my assertion that paying taxes is patriotic.
Apparently, they don't feel that way. Their
objections fell into two main categories.
Before I address those objections. I do
need to apologize for one thing, though. I
used the derogatory term "teabagging party"
instead of "Tea Party" protests. I was too flip
pant in my language. That being said, let me
state that I completely disagree with the
protests. First, while they purported to be
grass-roots efforts, they were heavily pro
moted by Fox News and conservative heavy
weights like Newt Gingrich. According to
Media Matters, during one of Glenn Beck's
programs, he even listed the location of vari
ous Tea Party events and labeled them "FNC
Tax Day Tea Parties."
More importantly, the parties smack of
dishonesty. While many of the participants
are genuinely angry at government spending.
I wonder where they were the past eight
years. During the Bush Administration, ac
cording to the U.S.Treasury Department, the
national debt rose from $5,727 trillion on Jan.
20.2001 to $10,626 trillion on Jan. 20,2009.
But now that Obama is spending money
on useless things like. say. trying to keep the
U.S. and global economy from collapsing, in
stead of. say. massive geopolitical blunders
and corporate welfare,apparently it's time to
invoke the spirit of the Founding Fathers.
Which leads to the first main objection 1
received from my correspondents. That ob
jection was thai taxes are bad because there's
lots of wasteful government spending. Exam
ples ranged from ACORN funding to the
stimulus bill. I really don't want to argue spe
cific programs, because in my previous col
umn. I never claimed that there is no waste

ful government spending. Of course there is.
And it's our responsibility as citizens to
vote for legislators who will spend responsi
bly. sponsor effective programs and elimi
nate ineffective ones. The answer to govern
ment waste is to work harder at good govern
ment. not to destroy government by simply
"starving the beast." And some waste will al
ways be inevitable,since we live in an imper
fect world; but that waste is the price we pay
for the good that government does.
For example, consider school lunches. In
2003, the Bush administration proposed new
eligibility requirements that would make it
more difficult for students to qualify for free
school lunches. But having worked as a
teacher in a public school and seen kids rely
on those meals. I personally would much
rather have some money get wasted rather
than have truly needy kids get cut off because
of overly-stringent requirements.
The second main objection I received was
more fundamental. One individual wrote
that "a government's role in its citizen's lives
is simply to keep a military, provide infra
structure and water and maintain an honest
justice system." By this definition, almost
every government program that exists today
is wasteful!
Well. I have to stand by my guns and re
mind my correspondents t hat we are a coun
try of 300 million vastly heterogeneous peo
ple living in the most complicated age in
human history. Without the federal govern
ment providing competent regulation of in
dustry, the environment, health and a myriad
of other factors, we would quickly descend
into anarchy.
Does any of you really want to eliminate,
say, the National Institutes of Health or the
Centers for Disease Control and just take
your chance with the swine flu? Or how
about we ax the EPA and its pesky regula

tions that keep lead out of gas, paint and chil
dren's toys?
One person even wrote me claiming that
there has never been a single successful gov
ernment program. I don't even know where
to begin with that one. How about Social Se
curity, which has been a major factor in re
ducing the devastating effects of poverty
among the elderly? The National Bureau of
Economic Research reports,"ln fact, there is
a striking association between the rise in So
cial Security expenditures per capita and the
decline in elderly poverty."
Or how about Head Start, a program run
by the U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services that provides education and
health programs for low-income children?
According to a report done in 2(X)5 by the
American Psychological Association. "Re
gression-adjusted impact analyses showed
that [threej-year-old program children per
formed better than did control children in
cognitive and language development, dis
played higher emotional engagement of the
parent and sustained attention with play ob
jects, and were lower in aggressive behavior.
Compared with controls, Early Head Start
parents were more emotionally supportive,
provided more language and learning stimu
lation. read to their children more and
spanked less."
God. what a waste of taxpayer money!
We live in a great country, and if we wish
to keep it that way. we must pay our dues.
Taxes, wisely levied and wisely spent, are a
patriotic duty.
