# Too Big To Fail
## Rejection, ejection, dejection

Terrified readers,
Today, there is a little over a month left
before that glorious beacon of hope
formally known as summer begins. If
you are anything like my parents, you are
concerned. The economy has reared its ugly,
downward-sloping head here in the form of
fewer department office supplies and fewer
unique, useful classes (e.g. Drama 104). but
until we started just now looking for jobs, this
nebulous economy thing didn't seem like
that big a deal. 1 low naive we were.
I lere is a frightening statistic that actually
exists: in March 2009. literally cS.S percent of
all Americans, or one in every 11 and three
quarters of a person,were unemployed. (IM
PORTANT NOTE: Dicking around with a
guitar does not. according to the Bureau of
Labor, qualify as employed.) More alarming
ly for those of us here. I did a little research
(which, yes, is itself alarming, but please stay
with me here) and found out that nearly 100
percent of full-time students at Stanford
don't have full-time jobs. Iliat is a big per
centage, and frankly, I am surprised and a lit
tle disappointed that President Obama has
not immediately resolved this as he has with
global warming and not owning a dog.
Moreover, of students intending to work
this summer, only. I don't know. N) percent
have jobs "locked down," and of those jobs,
probably only 30 percent are "good." It must
be the economy, right? Surely, if we can get
into one of the most elite universities in the
world, we can certainly work as temps,
cashiers or telemarketers or something,
right?
Wrong. Well, kind of. I have friends
bear in mind, these are people who are train
ing to be lawyers, doctors, businesspeople
who can't lock down jobs as house sitters, let
alone receptionists. I was starting to get wor
ried, and so, as I only do when necessity ab
solutely demands it, i did more research.This
is why my editor is inevitably upset at the ex
treme tardiness of this column — I have
never been particularly good at facts.
I consulted perhaps the best resource on

[... ] its time we eat our pride

low-paying jobs — Craigslist — and al
though no jobs I found specifically said
"Stanford grads need not apply," I didn't see
any that said "Stanford students ONLY." ei
ther. In fact, most jobs I found on Craigslist
didn't even mention a need for college de
grees. Several had major typos.
But it's getting late, our parents are start
ing to get worried and. damn it. we need the
money to pay for gas and our growing online
shopping addictions. As such, I've compiled a
list of some of the best jobs Craigslist has to
offer.
112 irst up: "Private Investigations Under
cover Decoys Needed." I didn't even need to
read the rest this is a job that lets you get
closer to your long-held dream of being a
professional spy Read this:" Phe ability to re

main calm under duress: the ability to act ac
cording to the assigned undercover character
profile; the ability to perform the above tasks
while possibly wearing/carrying a body-wire
or a hidden camera; $25/ hour." 1 have no
doubt that this is how James Bond got start
ed.
Next: "Grocery Sales Assistant/Broker." 1
have no idea what this means, but with the re
sponsibilities of a grocery store worker, you
get to tell your friends you're a broker.
Sweet.
Up next: "CASTING CALL for The Bad
Girls Club!!!" I don't know about you. but to
me. this sounds like a huge win; had I listed
this. 1 probably would have used at least five
exclamation marks. And while being "inde
pendent. spirited, opinionated, outspoken or
endlessly entertaining" doesn't necessitate a
Stanford degree, it couldn't hurt, right?
Right?
Next: "Users to try Spain's Hottest Work
out DVDs!" They may have only used one
exclamation mark, but don't be deceived —
this job is awesome. If you like being paid to
work out to the angry commands of spandex
clad Spaniards, you should contact this com
pany as soon as possible.
And finally: "Pain-in-the-butt boss needs
tough-as-nails personal/admin assistant."
ITiis job might not sound great, but if you can
save up material for the inevitable lawsuit,
you might just end up bagging six figures
after all.
Now. maybe none of these apply. Maybe
you're saying to yourself, "these suggestions
are great. Kevin, but even if I wanted to work
out to Spanish videos. I just can't afford a leo
tard anymore." Fair. But maybe.Stanford, it's
time we eat our pride and give up on the
dream job with seven figures and a desk, and
settle for the available job with two figures
and a free hamburger every third shift Well,
at least until Obama fixes the economv.

Kevin is still searching for johs, and if yon want
to consult him for his expertise in spying or for
eign workout tapes, contact him at
