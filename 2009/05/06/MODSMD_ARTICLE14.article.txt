achieved our goals, and that's really all you can
ask for."

"My proudest moment would be when we
finished competing in the technical routine
competition on Friday," Chen said. "I could
feel the energy and excitement from each per

on our technical program since coming back
from NCAA Collegiate Nationals, and every
thing paid off that day."

Morgan ranked fifth at 90.500, while team
mates Chen and Durand placed seventh at

"It was really great to compete at our home
pool. The energy of the home crowd was truly
amazing and made competing that much
more fun," Koroleva said. "Being a part of the
Stanford family definitely made the competi
tion really enjoyable, and I am once again so
glad that I have the opportunity to swim
here."
For the solo technical routines, Morgan
tied for seventh at 90.167. Once again leading
the pack were Canisius College, Santa Clara
and Ohio State.
