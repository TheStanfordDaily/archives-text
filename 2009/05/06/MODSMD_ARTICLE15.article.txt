# Women's lacrosse got snubbed
## 
### 
Let me preface this hv saying
that by no means am I a
lacrosse expert. I grew up
in New York, so I have an
inherent knowledge of the game,
but I have never played it. I have
been to very few games, and I have
read very little about it.
That being said, it does not take
an expert to realize that the Stan
ford women's lacrosse team got ab
solutely shafted on Sunday when it
was not given a bid to the 16-team
NCAA Tournament field.

There is an
underlying
problem [...]
East Coast bias

The outcome of Stanford's most
successful lacrosse season still left
the team wondering what it could
have done differently to make the
postseason.
The Cardinal finished 14-4 on
the season. All four of its losses
came at the hands of highly ranked
teams — teams that are in the
NCAA Tournament. Only one ol
these losses — an early-season
road match with No. 12 Notre
Dame — was particularly lopsided.
Stanford won its conference
the Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation (MPSF) — and its confer
ence tournament handily. Neither,
however, provided the team with
an automatic hid to the NCAA
Tournament.
The Cardinal played close
games with top teams and ended
the season with a shocking 8-f> win
over third-ranked University of
Pennsylvania. Given that the Car
dinal spent much of the latter half
of the season ranked in the top 15.
this win would seem to be icing on
Stanford's proverbial cake when it
came to making the tournament.
But, alas, the team was left out.
There is an underlying problem
with Stanford being left out of the
tournament. It is something I don't
normally give much weight to.
again, being from New York, and
that is an F.ast Coast bias.
