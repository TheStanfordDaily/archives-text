# Women's lacrosse got snubbed
## 
### 
Let me preface this hv saying
that by no means am I a
lacrosse expert. I grew up
in New York, so I have an
inherent knowledge of the game,
but I have never played it. I have
been to very few games, and I have
read very little about it.
That being said, it does not take
an expert to realize that the Stan
ford women's lacrosse team got ab
solutely shafted on Sunday when it
was not given a bid to the 16-team
NCAA Tournament field.

There is an
underlying
problem [...]
East Coast bias

The outcome of Stanford's most
successful lacrosse season still left
the team wondering what it could
have done differently to make the
postseason.
The Cardinal finished 14-4 on
the season. All four of its losses
came at the hands of highly ranked
teams — teams that are in the
NCAA Tournament. Only one ol
these losses — an early-season
road match with No. 12 Notre
Dame — was particularly lopsided.
Stanford won its conference
the Mountain Pacific Sports Feder
ation (MPSF) — and its confer
ence tournament handily. Neither,
however, provided the team with
an automatic hid to the NCAA
Tournament.
The Cardinal played close
games with top teams and ended
the season with a shocking 8-f> win
over third-ranked University of
Pennsylvania. Given that the Car
dinal spent much of the latter half
of the season ranked in the top 15.
this win would seem to be icing on
Stanford's proverbial cake when it
came to making the tournament.
But, alas, the team was left out.
There is an underlying problem
with Stanford being left out of the
tournament. It is something I don't
normally give much weight to.
again, being from New York, and
that is an F.ast Coast bias.

Normally I am championing
cast coast teams and think the al
leged East Coast hias is a figment
of sports fans' imaginations. In this
case, however, it could not he more
apparent.
Lacrosse is an East Coast sport.
Very few schools out west even
have teams, and those that do tend
not to get very much respect.
The entire 16-team NCAA
Tournament field is comprised of
teams from east of the Mississippi.
I don't know if it is assumed that
teams out west can't compete at a
high enough level, hut if so. it is a
foolish assumption
The Stanford lacrosse team is
comprised entirely of players from
the east. The furthest west any
player on the Stanford roster grew
up is Dallas, home of Caroline
Smith.
These women come from the
same schools as the players com
peting in the NCAA Tournament,
but they just happen to be smart
enough to go to Stanford. Inexplic
ably, they are punished for this.
In order to bolster its tourna

ment resume and gain national ex
posure, the Cardinal made four
trips to the East Coast over the
course of the season.
Despite this grueling travel
schedule, which only added to the
demands already facing all Stan
ford students, the Cardinal was not
rewarded.
According to head coach Amy
Bokker, the MPSF will have an au
tomatic bid to the NCAA Tourna
ment next year. With Stanford re
turning its nine leading scorers
from this season, as well as goalie
Annie Reed, that will undoubtedly
be an attainable goal a year from
now for the Cardinal.
But seniors Maris Perlman,
Jamie Nesbitt, Vikki Fanslow and
Melissa Vogelsong will never have
a chance to win a national champi
onship. and that is a shame.
At least a year from now. the
NCAA will begin to respect the
West Coast, whether by choice or
not,and the Stanford lacrosse play
ers can begin their season with a
chip on their shoulders, wanting to
prove to the country that they be
longed in the NC'AA Tournament
this year.
