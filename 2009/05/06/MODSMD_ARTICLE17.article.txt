Baseball rallies for win over San
Jose State
The Stanford baseball team rallied
from an early 7-1 deficit to defeat San
Jose State 9-8 at the Sunken Diamond
last night. Sophomore second base
man Colin Walsh went 3-5 and drove
in four runs, including a two-run sin
gle to give the Cardinal (23-19) its first
lead in the bottom of the eighth in
ning. and fellow sophomore Drew
Storen picked up the win despite let
ting up a run in his one and one third
innings pitched.
The Cardinal fell behind 7-1 after
two and a half innings, with its lone
run coming from a Ben Clowe solo
shot — the sophomore's second of
the season and second in his last two
games. However, junior outfielder
Toby Gerhart knocked in fellow out
fielder Joey August with a single in the
bottom of the third, and the Cardinal
exploded for five runs on the Spartans

(32-16) in the next two innings to tie
the game at 7-7. The score remained
the same until Walsh put the Cardinal
ahead in the bottom of the eight, driv
ing in sophomore Jake Schlander and
senior Jeff Whitlow from second and
third, respectively. Storen allowed a
home run from San Jose State's Corey
Valine to lead off the ninth: but after
walking the next Spartan hitter, the
Stanford sophomore got three
straight outs to close out the game.
