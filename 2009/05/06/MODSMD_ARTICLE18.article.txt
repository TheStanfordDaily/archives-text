## Students live off food stamps for a day Challenge gives just four dollars for meals 
### JULIA BROWNELL DESK EDITOR 
At lunch and dinner today outside
Old Union, students lined up to try to
pay for a day's meals with a four-dol
lar food stamp as part of Students
raking On Poverty's (STOP) Food
Stamp Challenge.
"It's a reality check when you
compare it to what you eat every day
in the dining hall." said Anton
Zietsman '12, a member of STOP
who participated in the lunch portion
of the challenge.
Approximately 140 people
showed up for the event, though 280
had registered: the majority came at
lunchtime. The event featured an
abundance of food spread out on a
table in front of Old Union with the
prices laid out per serving. For exam
ple. a slice of bread cost 20 cents.
"We had a number of options try
ing to represent what is inexpensive
and easy to prepare without a
kitchen, and also the food that might
be available in low-income neighbor
hoods; it's not farmers market fresh."
said I.ucv Litvak Ml. a director of
STOP
Part of the Challenge was to alert
people to the food choices that have
to be made on such a limited budget.
"The cheapest foods are the least
healthy — two Oreos were 25 cents,
but an apple was 50 cents: that's real
ly how it is when you go to a grocery
store," said Christina Guros,'o9. who
participated in the event for lunch
and dinner. "The tendency for people

with food stamps is just to get
what fills you up."

In addition to
the tvpes of food
available. STOP
tried to present the

difficulties of shopping
on such a tight
budget.

o
"I don't think

there was anything shocking ... so
much as going through the motions
of having to budget every 25 cents of
food." Litvak said. "Wiih a limited
budget, you make decisions about
what's going to fill me up."
Even after buying food. Guros
was faced with the realities of
hunger.
"I think of dinner as having a veg
etable and meat and some kind of
starch — I ended up just eating a cup
of noodles and a banana; I'm a little
hungry right now," Guros said a few
hours after the event. "Especially
having a family, I think coming up
with a meal at the end of the day
would be very difficult."
Zietsman felt that the event
forced the truth of the larger world
upon those in the Stanford Bubble.
"[The Food Stamp Challenge]
made you come to terms with the fact
that we do live a privileged life." he
said. "We lose touch with what things
actually cost — a lot is hidden behind
our dining hall cards."
After taking the Food Stamp
Challenge, participants were encour
aged to write letters to their senators
calling for the expansion of the
Childhood Nutrition Act to preserve
free lunches for students who need
them in public schools. At the event.
80 letters were collected.
"(The purpose was] also making
people aware that they can be politi-

cally involved by
writing letters to your
senator," Litvak
k said. She added
" that they also
urged participants
:o "pay attention to

how you vote on policies
involving food."

STOP also included infor
mation on how to get involved with
other groups fighting hunger on
campus, such as the Stanford
Project on Hunger (SPOON),
which serves food to the homeless
at the opportunity center, and
Challah for Hunger, which raises
money for many hunger-related
non-profits.
In addition to this event. STOP
put on a panel Monday night, fea
turing Leo O'Farrell, food stamp
program director for the City and
County of San Francisco; Colleen
Rivecca. advocacy coordinator for
the St. Anthony's Foundation:
David Kane, food system change
coordinator for Collective Roots;
and Matthew Stoltz '08, a Stanford
graduate currently on food stamps.
"[Stoltz] is currently on food
stamps because of unemployment,
and that hit home for me because I
don't have a job." Guro said. "It was
kind of a reality check.The stakes are
a little bit higher if you run out of
food."
The food stamps situation is wors
ening because of the economic crisis,
as more people turn to them to sus
tain their diet. According to
O'Farrell. the number of cases taken
on by San Francisco has gone up by
1,500 in the past year.
