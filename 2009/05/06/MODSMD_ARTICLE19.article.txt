## Research: Narcolepsy is autoimmue disorder 
### THE DAILY NEWS STAFF 
Stanford researchers believe they
have determined that narcolepsy is,
in fact, an autoimmune disease.
Narcolepsy is a disease affecting
approximately one in every 2.(M)()
people, characterized by extreme
drowsiness often to the point of ran
dom. uncontrollable bursts of sleep
throughout the day.
Emmanuel Mignot, professor of
sleep medicine at the School of
Medicine, and his colleagues conduct
ed a genetic study on 1 ,K(X) people with
the same variation of the Human
Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) gene,
which is involved in the body's immune
response. It has long been known that
HLA had a link to narcolepsy, and 8(X)
of the I,K(K) subjects had the disease.
The aim of the study, which was
published online Monday in Nature
Genetics, was to determine what
among those with the HLA variant
pushed some to develop narcolepsy.
Mignot found that those with nar
colepsy also presented a variant of a
gene related toT-cells, another com
ponent of the immune system.
Mignot postulates that the combi
nation of the HLA and T-cell vari
ants creates an immune response
that attacks cells that secrete
hypocretin. the hormone for wake
fulness that narcoleptics lack.
In addition to its relevancy to nar
colepsy treatment and research, the
findings could have implications for
other autoimmune diseases. This
study is one of the first that was able
to isolate a specific gene involved,
and such findings could lead to more
information on other autoimmune
diseases such as multiple sclerosis
and juvenile diabetes.
