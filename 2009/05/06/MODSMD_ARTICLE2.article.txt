# 43rd annual McClatchy Symposium
## Reporting in the red Journalists discuss media portrayal of the downturn 
### ALAN GUO STAFF WRITER 
At the 43rd annual McClatchy Symposium on
Tuesday night, a panel of journalists discussed the
particular challenges that the mainstream media
faces in covering the current economic crisis.
The panel featured Diana Henriques, senior
financial writer for The New York limes; Alan
Murray, deputy managing editor for The Wall
Street Journal; Steven Pearlstein, business colum
nist for The Washington Post; and Stephen
Shepard. former editor in chief of Business Week
and current dean of the CUNY Graduate School
of Journalism at City College of New York.
The symposium, moderated by Prof. James
Fishkin, chair of the communications department,
examined the difficulty of exposing this crisis
through the perspective of a reporter, columnist
and editor, all represented on the panel.
While each of the four panelists is actively
involved in covering the economic crisis, they
offered, at times, competing explanations of the
origin of the downturn and. subsequently, differ
ent views of the challenges that the media faces in
accurately informing the public.

"One facet that makes the crisis unusual and
challenging is the complexity" Henriques noted.
"Translating the complexity for a broad audience
is the most significant challenge for the media."
She quickly pointed out that mainstream
media, including The New York Times, reported
on many alarming aspects of the finance industry
as early as 2000. Yet. she admitted that the cover
age was not persistent and convincing enough to
produce significant impact.
"We should keep a sense of humility about the
media's ability to turn a powerful tide of public
opinion." Henriques said, noting the limitation of
the newspaper.
"The pen is mightier than the sword, but it is
not mightier than a yawn." she joked.
Murray begged to differ on delineating the
complexity of the crisis to the public.
"There were some pieces [of this crisis] that are
very simple, and we watched it because we had
hope and greed," Murray said, referring to prac
tices such as the prevalent offerings of zero-down
payment mortgages, a break from the leading
practices of banks for over 1 (X) years.

tured New York Times financial writer Diana Heririgues (right). Last night's panel focused on reporting in the economic crisis.
"The core [of this problem] was
simple, transparent and clear — we
all knew it was happening and many
of us were participating," he said. "It
was a good deal, so we wanted it to
he okay."
Yet Murray concurred with
Henriques on the limitation of the
media.
"At some point, you cannot hold
journalism responsible for people
who are with full information, mak
ing bad decisions." he added.
Pearlstein and Shepard attacked
the problem of reporting on the cri
sis by explaining the crisis on a
macro level.
Pearlstein saw the current prob
lem as a manifestation of years of
Americans living beyond their
means, consuming more than they
were producing anil having easily
available credit.
In alerting the reader to this "irra
tional exuberance," Pearlstein said
the challenge is that "the press is sup
posed to speak truth to the readers
about their own shortcomings."

Shepard portrayed the crisis as a
lack of check and balances, sprout
ing from the culture of de-regulation
that has been fermenting for years, it
not decades.
"The media followed the same
trend with the economy," Shepard
said. "Good stories [that reveal the
truth or raise concerns] were
drowned by the upbeat coverage of
the economy."
While the panelists held diverse
opinions and perspectives, all agreed
that the economic downturn would
speed up the transformation of the
media itself. Coming from main
stream media, the panel saw the
imminent restructuring of their pub
lications to tailor toward cyberspace.
'ITieir concerns about this trans
formation were evident throughout
the talk.
"There is a de-funding of media
as we search for a new business
model." Shepard said. "Our problem
is to figure out ways to sustain qual
ity journalism. not fragmenting it."
Envisioning the future of the
media, he added. "A publication
should do what it does best and link
to the rest."
