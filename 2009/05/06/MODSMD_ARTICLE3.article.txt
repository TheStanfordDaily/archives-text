## Freshman Hansen becomes Cardinal spark in first season 
### CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
A brief glance at the Stanford softball team's
statistics chart reveals plenty of stunning
numbers and talented players, from Missy
Penna — who ranks among the nation's
i top 10 in three pitching categories —to
some of Stanford's best power hitters of all time in
Alissa Haber, Rosey Neill and Shannon Koplitz.
Perhaps most impressive of them all. though, is a
young player posting nearly team-best numbers in
almost every offensive category in her first year with the
team — shortstop Ashley I lansen.
Just a freshman, I lansen leads her team in triples and
RBI, has the fewest strikeouts and most at-bats of any
regular starter and is on pace to be just the second
Cardinal player to ever bat over .400 on a season.
So where did this phenom come from?

For Hansen, a ver
satile athlete, the road
to college softball was
one of many options.
The Arizona-native
was practically raised
on the game, follow
ing in the footsteps of
her three softball
playing sisters, from
tee hall at age three to
a traveling club team
at just six. She went
on to dabble in vari
ous sports, but was
ultimately drawn to
the softball diamond
above all else.
"In middle school.
I played volleyball
and basketball and
continued to play vol

"She's an
outstanding
young player."

leyball through my senior year in high school," Hansen
said. "Softball has always been my calling, though. I just
love how it's a combination of a team and individual
sport. You get your moment in the spotlight every time
you come up to the plate, but you also know that your
teammates will always be there to pick you up. too.
Hansen's commitment to the game paid off in a big
way early in her high school career, giving her some
once-in-a-lifetime opportunities. Hansen led the Worth
Firecrackers club team to two ASA national champi
onship games and was a key member of a U.S. Junior
National Team that WOfl the Pan American
Championship in Puerto Rico in 2(M)(i. Just a year later,
she batted .483 for the gold-medal U.S. learn at the
World ( hampionships in I nschede. Holland.
Grateful for such unique opportu
nities, Hansen cites them as a major
catalyst for her growth as a player.
"I have been surrounded with some
of the best soft ball players in the coun
try' on both club and national teams,
and my coaches there taught me much
more than the fundamentals of the
game I lansen recalled. "They made
me more mentally tough. Any oppor
tunity to play in that type of big game
gives you the experience to grow and
develop as a player and prepares you
for the next step: college."
When the time came for I lansen to
take that step and commit to a particu
lar school, her choice was easy to make.
Stanford, she said, is the perfect place
for her.
"I knew it was the right fit for me."
I lansen said."The campus is absolute
ly beautiful.the weather is much better
than the scorching heat in Arizona and
it has the academics and the athletic
department that I have dreamed
about. Why wouldn't it be Stanford?"
Hansen's impact on the Cardinal
team was immediate and profound.
She belted a three-run home run in her
first at-bat as a college player, and con
tinued to put up solid numbers even in
clutch situations, including a bases
clearing double to defeat Cal on April
Her coach, John Rittman, couldn't
be more pleased with her contribu
tions to the team.

"She understands the game,"
Rittman emphasized. "She under
stands defenses, coverages; she knows
how to cater her play to a certain hitter
and get in position, and knows when to
be on the move and where. And offen
sively, she leads the team in triples and
almost in doubles. Just look at the stats.
She's an outstanding young player."
Beyond the numbers, though.
Hansen's impact can be seen in her
sense of camaraderie and her mature
approach to the game. Junior catcher
Rosey Neill, who had a chance to play
with Hansen before her career with
the Cardinal, had nothing but praise
for her integrity and character.
"I was teamed up with her in Puer
to Rico and then later in Holland, so I
had a chance to play with her before
we even put on a Stanford uniform to
gether," Neill explained. "I could tell
from the start that she was a good kid.
so when I knew she was committing [to
Stanford], 1 was definitely really excit
ed. She's a hard worker, and always
puts in the effort at practice. She's just
a good kid, a great teammate."
Rittman.considering himself fortu
nate to coach Hansen, has been very
impressed by her poise and determina
tion.
"She's very mature for her age. and
she's a team player and a great com
municator," Rittman said. "We're very
blessed to have her in our program. As

a coach, you couldn't ask for a better
player to work with, on and off the
field."
Hansen, in return, is just as thankful
to have teammates that she thinks are
fantastic, and looks forward to closing
out the season with them.
"I couldn't have asked for a better
group of girls," Hansen explained.
"Our team's camaraderie is amazing,
and it makes the sport that much more
en joyable to play every day. We've had
a fantastic season, and we are still on a
mission as it wraps up. Our main focus
is to take things one game at a time and
play our best game on any given day. 11
we do that, we have the tools to beat
any opponent in this country."
