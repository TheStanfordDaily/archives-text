is no stranger to pressure situations.
mand not only at the plate. From bat
ting in the heart of the Stanford order
to coming to the rescue of a father
and daughter in the waters off the coast of Maui,
tense situations, it seems, have a way of finding
the Cardinal slugger and testing his ability to
respond.
During winter break of 2(X)7. Kiilsgaard and
some close friends were vacationing in Hawaii
when he spotted a man and his daughter just off
the shore, struggling to stay afloat. A testament
to the good timing that seems to have followed
Kiilsgaard throughout his athletic career, the
current Stanford sophomore was in the right
place at the right time, and had. luckily, just

learned the skills he needed to help.
"I was in the middle of taking a life-sav
ing class that my dad taught at my high

school, actually, and so I knew a thing
or two about pulling people from the

water," Kiilsgaard explained. "I
went over and the dad actually
grabbed onto a rock and I
helped pull the girl in and
made sure she was ok. and i
then I helped pull the dad in. W
"I just helped some people
in need ... I didn't really feel
like I was a hero or anything." he

continued. "They were struggling out
there, so I thought 1 might be able to
help."

That perfect timing has carried over into
Kiilsgaard's baseball career on the Farm. I lie
Cardinal found itself in need of a heart-of
the-order batter, and Kiilsgaard was ready to
step into that role.
Anil he has produced. ITie sophomore
outfielder is hitting .313 on the year, just one
point behind team-leading sophomore sec
ond baseman Colin Walsh, with nine home
runs and a team-leading 12 doubles. Mis power
and production have made him a key cog of
the C 'ardinal offense this year, all the more con
sidering the shoes he's had to fill.
"Obviously, he's been huge because he's
filled a big void in terms of what we lost last
year," senior outfielder Joey August said of his
teammate. "Talk about (Jason | Castro and

[Sean] Ratliff and [Cord] Phelps and guys like
that... we obviously lost some home runs and
some RBIs and some things like that. So. to have
him really come out of nowhere and just have
such a great year has really just been huge."
Still, according to August, that's not to say
that the team didn't see Kiilsgaard's emergence
coming.
"He worked his butt off this summer and in
the fall." August said. "You just knew when he
showed up in the fall that he was going to have
a great year because he's just such a hard work
er and won't settle for failure."
But to the average Cardinal fan. Kiilsgaard
perhaps entered this season more famous for his
exploits on the gridiron than on the diamond.
The Auburn, Wash.-native was a two-sport star
in high school and was the Cardinal's most high
ly touted football recruit in 2006-2007. A four
star quarterback prospect according to
Rivals.com. Kiilsgaard displayed a rare blend of
running and passing ability in high school that

led some to wonder whether he could per
haps be groomed to eventually take the
starting job by then-new Stanford head
coach Jim I larbaugh.

But the high school star was
switched to safety and then full
back with the Cardinal, and
eventually decided that it was
time to make a choice that

would shape the remainder of
his athletic career.

said. "Talking
