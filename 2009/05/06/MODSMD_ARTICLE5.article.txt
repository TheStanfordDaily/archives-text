## Senate makes plans for policy summit 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
New senators have already
begun digging their heels in. as
they prepared for the ASSU's first
"Policy Forum" and discussed a
handful of proposed bills regarding
Vaden and sustainability at
Tuesday night's meeting.
ASSU Vice President Jay de la
Torre '10 announced that the two
chiefs of staff for the Executive
Cabinet have been selected.
Bennett Hauser *10, who ran for
Executive in this year's election,
and Andy Parker '11 will be work
ing closely with the Executives.
Although the other positions have
not been filled yet. interviews are
being conducted for other cabinet
positions this week.
The senators have also con
firmed their committee positions,
and will assign chair and deputy
chair positions for these commit
tees in the upcoming week. The
Communications Committee has

seen notable growth from the 10th
Undergraduate Senate — with five
members this term, it is up from
three members in the last.The shift
reflects an increased emphasis on
accountability and transparency to
the student body at large in this
Senate.
The upcoming Policy Forum
will have nine policy sessions: sus
tainability, student wellness and
health, diversity. Office of Student
Activities (OSA), housing, dining,
student life and two academic ses
sions. The policy sessions are
intended to bring student leaders,
administrators and the ASSU
together to talk at the same table
about their respective objectives
and how they can work together to
reach shared goals in the upcoming
academic year.
Senator Alex Katz '12. who is
heading up the project, addressed
the mission of the summit.
"We're trying to get policymak
ers. student leaders and administra
tors in the same room so we can just
talk about their views on these issues."
Katz said. "So for us. it's kind of a wav

of getting student input on what our
agenda should be."
Senator Zachary VVarma '11
agreed, noting the importance of
these sessions to give students an
opportunity to interact with relevant
administrators in a cooperative
"brainstorming session."
"[The Policy Forum is] giving a
chance for us to interact with the pub

lie, but also to really begin to craft
these sort of broad-ranging kind of
incentives and agendas that can push
all aspects of the ASSU forward
through the year." Warma said.
The Senate also discussed last
night a new party level that was pro
posed by the OSA. Senator Adam
Creasman '11 explained that the pro
posed change was a response to the

significant distinction between party
levels two and three, and the new
party level is intended to serve as an
intermediary that will allow students
to invite an infinite number of guests,
but not serve hard alcohol.
"The problem in the past is that
the rules haven't always lined up with
how parlies are actually run, which
means that when group leaders apply
for parties, they don't follow the
rules." Creasman said. "We can
improve communication with the
OSA and student leaders. I think it
will decrease the level of alcohol inci
dents on campus."
Two bills including the
Sustainability Bill and the Vaden
Advisory Committee Bill will be
voted on next week.
The Sustainability Bill looks to
reduce waste by placing stringent
policies on the use of green products
at ASSU events. The Vaden Advisory
Committee Bill is a response to
Vaden's new health fee for next year
and is intended to create a working
group of students and Vaden person
nel to improve Vaden as a resource, by
including more student feedback and
act as an intermediary relaying infor
mation to students.
The Senate also discussed how it
intends to organize itself to be more
effective and to hold individual sena
tors more accountable.
Returning Senator and previous
Senate Chair Shelley Gao'l 1 suggest
ed that the Senate ought to form com
mittees that are dedicated to address
ing specific issues, such as academic
advising or gender-neutral housing.
"I think there is a lot of tendency
from my experience last year for peo
pie to just escape under a big, large
heading of advocacy or not really
[maintain] substantial progress on
their particular issue." Gao said. "I
think that [issue-focused subcommit
tees) really encourages accountability
on our part and makes progressing
evident and clear."
Senator I jee Jackson' 12, while not
ing that he felt sub-committees could
be a good idea, stressed the impor
tance of concrete goal-setting and a
self-starting attitude among the sena
tors.
"I think that the inspiration for
people's work comes from them
selves. not from an institutional struc
ture," Jackson said.
Warma seemed to echo the atti
tudes of most of the senators when he
suggested that accountability will be
the foremost objective, as the new
Senate continues discussing how to
best organize itself.
"| Weekly updates and goal-setting
can act as] a very public means by
which we instill some accountability
into what people are doing so they
don't slip through the cracks," he said.
