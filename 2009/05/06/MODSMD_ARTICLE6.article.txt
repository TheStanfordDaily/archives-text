## Students pursue energy monitor system in Donner Project develops out of IntroSem 
### ELIZABETH TITUS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
For residents of Dormer's third
floor, a new pilot program meas
uring energy use in their dorm
rooms will begin to change their
energy habits â€” that is. if pro
gram designers Kevin Mori '12.
Matt Crowley "12 and Ben
Kallman '12 have anything to say
about it.
I"he trio, with the help of half a
dozen other students,oversaw the
installation of a circuit breaker
panel two weeks ago that sends
and receives real-time informa
tion about the floor's energy use.

The installation of this important
technical part of the program
marks a critical step for what
began as an introductory seminar
project.
"The goal is to make energy
something to be excited about,"
Kallman said.
Now that the technical piece is
in place, said the freshmen, they
will begin designing a way to
explain to residents what their
energy use means. That could
take the form of a Facebook
application, an inter-room com
petition or a desk lamp that
changes colors to show energy
use. they said.
"We want to make sure we
design this for humans, for
Stanford freshmen." Mori said.
"This is all from product design
perspective.
"You can access the raw data if
you want to," Crowley added. "We
want to make this as open-source as
possible."
With a stack of 150 Post-It notes
full of ideas, their work is cut out for
them. But, Mori said, finding the
best, least-intrusive design to show
people their energy use "fits with the
whole idea of respecting people."
A similar program exists in
Storey, but only measures energy
use floor-by-floor, explained Mori.
Storey residents must visit a Web
site to get information about their
energy use. which is provided in
terms of watts, pounds of carbon,
dollars and hamburgers. But the
freshmen hope to improve on that
design.
"Who cares if it's 5.3 watts?
ITiat's two cents," Mori said.
Associate Professor of
Mechanical Engineering Shilajeet
"Banny" Banerjee is advising the
project, called PIugVIEW
(Visualizing Individual Energy
Waste) by the students. He first met
Mori, Crowley and Kallman in his
fall-quarter introductory seminar.
"Think Like a Designer."
"We have a huge crisis in the
energy sector," Banerjee said. "We
have huge targets to thwart climate
change. Supply-side efficiency meas
ures are very important, but we need
to modify the consumption side as
well."
That means combining behav
ioral science with design, an effort
that has only begun to address ener
gy. he said.
"Kevin and gang are doing exact
ly that." Banerjee said. "Energy
companies are interested in seeing
these [sensors] deployed in every
home, in every building."
Donner Resident Fellow Linda
Paulson said residents seemed
receptive to the project.
"I think it'll work for people who
are already ecological; I think it
could work." said Josh Falk "12, a
third-floor resident. He said he
would be willing to have some sort
of energy monitor in his room.

The energy monitor pictured above
was installed on the third floor of
Donner as part of a project which
began as an idea for an IntroSem.
The project aims to monitor how
much energy Donner residents use.
"It doesn't bother us at all," said
Anne Warner '12. another resident.
Since Mori presented the project at
a house meeting, she said, "I've defi
nitely been thinking of turning off
my lights more."
Funds for the project came from
two sources: a $5,200 grant from
Green Fund and a sponsorship from
Veris Industries, who installed the
components of the circuit breaker
panel for free. That left $14 in ship
ping for the students to cover, plus
the cost of the server.The rest of the
grant will go toward developing
feedback devices for residents to
use.
Banerjee said he is confident
about the future of the Donner proj
ect.
"For 100 years, we've plugged
things into the wall and had it come
to us," he said. "It's not precious to
us. The challenge is in the hands of
folks like Kevin, Ben and Matt."
