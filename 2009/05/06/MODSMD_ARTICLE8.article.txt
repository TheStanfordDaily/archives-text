## A
						LEGISTORM OF CONTROVERSY Jock Friedly '90 creates Web site promoting government transparency, faces criticism 
### CAROLINE STOKES 
Should making public records avail
able to the public be a crime? Some
public officials think that LegiStorm,
a Web site created by Jock Friedly
_ '90, crosses the line.The site publish
es salary information, details of privately
financed trips, financial disclosure forms and
other publicly available records from sena
tors. representatives and Congressional
staffers.
The site has drawn attention and criti
cism since its 2006 launch. Last year, finan
cial disclosure forms outlining all financial
holdings of Congressional staffers and
spouses were released on LegiStorm.
"It generated a firestorm at the time on
Capitol Hill because staffers were outraged
that we would actually make public infor
mation JWMic," 1 Friedly explained.
All mm information has long been avail
able to tne public deep within the basements
of government archives, but Friedly has
made the effort to dig up these files and
enter the data by hand onto a freely accessi
ble. user-friendlv Web site.
And he's certainly getting a lot of flack
for it.
Three years ago. Rep. Roger Wicker (R-
Mass) tried to pass a law banning the Web
site. According to an article in Roll Call, a
Capitol Hill newspaper, he claimed that
while it's "a matter of public record" for the
public to know House members' salaries,
"it's taking it too far for rank-and-file
Congressional staffers to have their individ
ual salaries bandied about in the public
domain."
But Rvan Calo. a fellow at the Center for
Internet & Society at Stanford Law School.

explained that it will be hard to ban the site
due to protection from the First Amendment.
"First, the information is public... So
far, courts have been reticent to recognize a
legal violation stemming from just organiz
ing information you already have a right to
access," Calo wrote in an email to the Daily.
"Second, these records are arguably a mat
ter of public concern, which means that
LegiStorm will likely get heavy cover from
the First Amendment, which, as you know,
protects the right to free speech."
"They'd practically have to know that
they were publishing bad data, for instance,
to face liability for defamation or a privacy
violation." he added.
While Friedly concedes that the public
does not have a right to know all sensitive
government information, he believes tax
payers have the right to view the salaries
they're paying for.
"The public's right to know vastly out
weighs the right to privacy." Friedly said.
But many Congressional staffers who
now have all their personal finances from
mortgages to mutual funds published online
beg to differ. A recent Washington Post arti
cle described Friedly as "the Devil incar
nate" in the minds of Congressional staffers.
Rlogs also constantly attack the Stanford
alum — FamousDC.com, a political gossip
blog, even calls him "the neighborhood
bully."
But Friedly seems entirely unfazed by the
name-calling.
"I believe in what Em doing." he said
calmly and assuredly. "1 know that what Em
doing is for the public good, and that people
express their appreciation for what we're
doing."
Making political processes more trans
parent is nothing new for Friedly. After

Jock Friedly '90 created LegiStorm to
make the salaries and expenditures of
the members of Congress and their
staffers available to the public. The Web
site has since stirred up controversy sur
rounding freedom of speech versus gov
ernment privacy, especially concerning
the privacy the staffers feel entitled to.
deciding he wasn't cut out for the lab. the
physics major joined The Stanford Daily
after his sophomore year on the Farm.
"I found that 1 quite enjoyed the inves
tigative stories," he said. "You know, the
ones where you were digging something out.
where people didn't necessarily want the
information to he out there."
He also found his physics background
surprisingly useful.
"Science is very much a process of trying
to figure out the world and asking a lot of
questions and probing, testing theories." he
explained. "And that's exactly what inves
tigative reporting at its best is."
While at Stanford, he wrote a series of
articles about the student government and
how hidden its finances and legislative
processes were to everyday students. He
began his career in journalism at the Palo
Alto Weekly, where he claims his persistent
demand for public records spurred the city
attorney to press for changes to the
California Public Records Act in order to
make the law more explicit.

Ever since. Friedly has been a staunch
advocate for making public records avail
able, which is exactly why he created
LegiStorm. The payroll and financial data
conveniently displayed on LegiStorm has
helped reveal several possible abuses of
Congressional power and taxpayer dollars.
One salary record, for instance, pointed
out that Sen. Ted Stevens' (R-Alaska) per
sonal accountant was listed on his payroll.
The raw facts of the data raised another red
flag when this accountant's salary —
financed by taxpayers — increased signifi
cantly just as the FBJ was beginning to
investigate Sen. Stevens on charges of possi
ble corruption related to his finances.
"Washington dirties people," Friedly told
The Washington Post in April. So he's on a
mission to clean it up.
But it's not easy. He describes it as a
"long, hard slog" digging up the hard-to-find
books containing the approximately 7()().(K)()
public records now viewable on LegiStorm,
scanning them, entering all the data by hand
and checking for accuracy. Since LegiStorm
began. Congress has made some records
more electronically available.
Still, Friedly has found that it's easy for
government offices to hide data in "a little
obscure corner" of a Web site in a difficult to
use format.
So who's funding this lengthy and labor
intensive extraction and organization
process? For now, Friedly himself. The site is
currently operating at a profit loss, hut
Friedly channels profits from two of his
other revenue-generating sites, which pro
vide government documents and patent
information, to help support LegiStorm.
These other sites host records that are also
publicly available, hut Friedly says clients
are willing to pay for the convenience his
sites provide instead of searching through
government archives themselves.
Interestingly. Friedly plans to introduce a
paid subscription feature on LegiStorm. He
insists that all the current data will remain
free for browsing, but that additional fea
tures for more in-depth searches will require
a subscription.
How can Friedly advocate for trans
parency of public records w hen he himself is
charging others to see these records?
"It's got to be a sustainable thing," he
said. "So the question is. where does the
money come from? It's really the govern
ment's job to provide the information in the

ways citizens need it. It doesn't really do the
public any good if we came about this with
the idea of making all this information for
free, and then we didn't have a way to actu
ally pay to make it continue."
Friedly envisions LegiStorm as a newspa
per model, charging a relatively low sub
scription fee to make information easily
accessible to everyday people. Hut instead of
providing stories as newspapers do, he
hopes unearthing the nonpartisan facts of
government expenditures will help others
shape their own stories.
Since releasing the personal financial dis
closure forms of Congressional staffers
online last year. Friedly cites that at least
half a dozen Congressional chiefs of staff
have been accused of wrongdoing related to
these statements.
"1 think that says it all." he explained.
"[LegiStorm] has had an effect on things,
and people have used this to make a differ
ence and to try to clean up Washington. So I
feel good about how it's been used and what
kind of influence we've had."
And with the declining media business —
an industry most invested in revealing pub
lic records — Friedly stresses the impor
tance of sustaining a demanding investiga
tive reporting industry.
"If there aren't reporters there to find it.
I'm afraid there's going to be a lot more
shenanigans going on in Washington."he
predicted.
Stanford may be over 2,800 miles from
the nation's capitol, but Friedly still believes
Stanford students can get involved in advo
cating for a cleaner, more transparent gov
ernment. He recommends that students cap
italize on their unique skills — from writing
to organizing to technical abilities and so on
—in order to bring public awareness to
their passions and interests.
And what if people start calling you "the
Devil incarnate" in response to your blog
post or your student protest?
"Students should feel comfortable in
their own skin." Friedly advised. "They
shouldn't shv awav from controversy. They
should stand up for what's right and not
worry about the consequences. Frankly.
Stanford students are bright enough to not
have to worry about [feeling] like they have
to get along with everyone."
