## EDITORIAL New ASSU Execs must get to work 
### 
Now that the previous ASSU Execu
tives. Jonny Dorsey '09 and Fagan
I larris '09. have passed on the reins of
power, the Stanford community can reflect
on how much has been accomplished in the
2008-2(X)9 term, and also look forward with
confidence to the 2009-2010 academic year.
The incoming ASSU Executive slate. David
Gobaud 'OS M.S. '10 and Jay de la Torre '10.
has pledged not only to further several
Dorsey/Harris initiatives â€” including anti
bystander education and campus wellness
but also to launch a few of their own.
Over the next several months, we can expect
to see an array of new programs aimed at
promoting ASSU transparency, addressing
cost-of-living matters, encouraging diversity
and tolerance, and emphasizing public serv
ice and academic excellence.
The editorial board acknowledges that
the Dorsey/Harris team leaves the new
ASSU Executive team with big shoes to fill
after a remarkable and widely praised year
of ASSU leadership. Gobaud and de laTorre
will face their own set of challenges, and
should take full advantage of the momen
tum Dorsey and Harris generated last year
by fostering even more interaction and en
gagement among students, faculty and ad
ministrators. 112 or the coming year, Gobaud
and de la Torre should divide their efforts
between ensuring that pilot projects such as
the Wellness Room do not lose steam, and
focusing on those elements of campus life to
which Dorsey and 1 larris had less time to de
vote effort.
In particular, the ASSU Executive should
look to make sustainability a top priority,
flic editorial board commends Gobaud/de
la Torre's extensive green platform, which
includes plans to make Tresidder and Old
Union waste-free, eliminate wasteful prod
ucts such as Styrofoam from food service lo
cations, expand the ASSU Green Store and
reduce paper towel usage. These are good
ideas that should be acted on immediately. It
is often difficult to get the ball rolling on en
vironmental initiatives, so Gobaud and de la
Torre should start talking with Stanford's
food service providers as soon as possible to
ensure that there are more compost bins and
fewer paper towel dispensers as soon as we

return to campus in the fall.
I"he editorial board also urges the ASSU
Executive to follow through on the"Cost of
Living and Equality" platform plank it ad
vertised during the campaign. The concept
of equalizing the cost of living for houses on
the Row and other dorms on campus is novel
and worth pursuing. In tough economic
times, it makes sense to work toward equal
izing the cost of living on campus, especially
when students face so much uncertainty as
to where they will end up in the Housing
Draw. Making the cost of campus living con
sistent across all campus housing options
and more affordable in general should be at
the top of the Executive's list, both as a
short-term and long-term goal. On a related
note, Gobaud and de la Torre should also
focus on promoting the ASSU Executive
election spending cap that was hotly contest
ed this year, in an effort to limit the amount
of money that is spent during the election
cycle and level the playing field for all
would-be campaigners.
Aside from campus health, sustainability
and cost of living issues, the editorial board
welcomes Gobaud and de la Torre's ambi
tious goals for the coming year.The board is
confident that the 2009-2010 year will bring
quality of life improvements for both gradu
ate and undergraduate students, and contin
ue growing the voung but vital tradition of
open and transparent governance.
