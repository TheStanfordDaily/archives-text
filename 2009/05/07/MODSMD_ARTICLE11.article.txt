# Steal this Column
## Down the stretch we come 
### 
"Life is what happens to you while you're
busy making other plans."
— me, trying to think of the most appropri
ate John Lennon quote for this column
It was on the 280 freeway, on the way back
to campus after having taken in a minor
league San Jose Giants game against the
Modesto Nuts (yes. that's their real name),
when I got to thinking. It happened in a flash,
while I was talking with my buddies Cam,
Peter. Diaz and Spencer in the car about
graduation weekend plans. Suddenly, as the
conversation ended and I watched the cars
on the freeway make their way past ours. I re
alized: it's for real. Graduation — my gradu
ation from college — is coming. These mo
ments, with these friends, will soon be noth
ing more than a memory. It hasn't happened
yet. but. as Sally once wept to Harry, it's
there. Graduation, the end of an era. is just
sitting there, waiting.
(I must include one anecdote from the
game before continuing.even though it isn't
related: at around the third inning. I got the
shock of my life when a man three rows in
front of me got up. asked if 1 was Mark
Donig and handed me a folder with my
name on it. 1 le told me his client was filing a
defamation lawsuit for a recent Stanford
Daily column I had written. "You've been
served." he announced before re-taking his
seat. My friends laughed uproariously. It
was only after I opened up the folder that 1
joined in the laughter.The law firm? Dewey.
Cheathem. & Howe. The client? A 1 (See
"My Pal Al," April 22). The lengths my dad
will go to in order to continue his war on
conventional parenthood? Beyond belief.
Back to the article.)

The feeling that swept over me as we went
up 2KO that evening was startlingly new to me
here. I've felt it — that in-moment nostalgia
— in other places, but I grew up right nearby
Stanford.This area is my home. This was the
first time 1 ever felt that while in the Bay
Area.
The feeling is frustrating, though, and we
all know why. As soon as we get that wave of
nostalgia, we vow to ourselves that we will
enjoy the moment for all that it is, because it
will soon be gone. We envision ourselves
years from now, reminiscing about exactly
moments such as these, when we had not a
care in the world. We imagine ourselves as
fifty-year-olds, waxing nostalgic about those
moments when we thought to ourselves as
young little kiddos, "I am gonna be pretty
nostalgic about this some day.'"
The only problem with this particular nos
talgia is that, well, it's a lie. How many of us
really have moments when we don't have a
care in the world? How many of us ever have
a single moment in our purportedly care-free
youth without thinking something like,
"Damn it. this midterm is gonna kick my ass."
or "Crap. 1 hope my girlfriend isn't pissed at
me for what 1 did at pub night." or "I am way
past deadline for a column. Mv editor is going
to assassinate me in the heart"?
The fact is. when we reminisce, we ro
manticize. We forget that those times in our
lives when we were supposedly absolutely
and completely fulfilled and content were in
fact filled with incessant worrying and. in
some cases, legitimate hardship. As a
species, staying in the present is not exactly
our strongest suit. When we are in the race,
we are worried about preparing for the next
turn — and the finish line — rather than

how we feel in the moment.
To which I say, I guess human nature has a
point, but on the whole, evolution got this
one wrong. I genuinely wish I could enjoy the
present more, but I really don't know how; I
am not wired for it.'lTiis is such a happy time
for me — Spring Quarter senior year, for the
sake of goodness! And yet. how have I truly
appreciated this for what it is? Sure. I've been
having a good time, but I'm also spending a
lot of my time worrying about what the fu
ture holds.
In fact, I can't think of a single time I've
stopped to smell the roses this spring. And
even if I had. I wonder, would I be able to ap
preciate the smell without worrying that I
was wasting my precious time? Even as im
ages from that Monday night freeway ride
are etched in my head, if I am honest with
myself, I was not concentrating then on being
happy; frankly, just the opposite. I was deeply
saddened that moments such as these are
fleeting and soon to be gone. Ah. to be con
tent in the middle of the moment — what a
seemingly unreachable goal. What a noble
one. nonetheless.
And so. Class of 2009.d0wn the stretch we
come. Years from now. we'll look back at
these last few months of college, and we may
well say, "Those were the most exciting two
minutes of our lives." But for now. I just want
to make sure that when I say that, it will have
been true. I hope that in these last few pre
cious moments, I can learn how to make it so.
