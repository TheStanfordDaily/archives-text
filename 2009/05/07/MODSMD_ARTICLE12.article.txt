## Nicole Demby Facebook thinks I'm a pretentious ass

Apparently. I am a "post-modernist." a
typical representative of the bourgeois
intelligentsia. Well-read and witty, but
lacking both true understanding of the materi
al conditions of society (which I disdainfully
dismiss as a mere side product of speech acts)
and the courage necessary for revolutionary
action (which I. again, disdainfully wave off as
a manifestation of masculine domination).
Or so was the verdict of the Facebook qui/
"Which Deviation are You?", recommended
to me hy my political theory-majoring sister.
Plough these were rough words to hear, they
presented a not-uncommon caricature of peo
ple who like to read Derrida and talk about
things like "the structure of reality." I'd be lying
if I said I didn't fall into this category.
I've never been much of a doer. With few
hobbies and no sharply honed talents to speak
of. I generally just sit around and think a lot. A
large part of me feels that it's OK to succumb

to this tendency because it's simply reflective
of who I am. If I was disposed to be a star ath
lete, or the President of the United States, then
1 would undoubtedly do the things an athlete
or a future politician do. Yet sometimes 1 won
der if there isn't some categorical imperative
that says that being "a doer" is ideal. People at
Stanford generally seem to feel this way. their
ambition leading them to compulsively apply
for things,organize meetings and plan projects.
No doubt there's some virtue to being able to
analyze and write about the world in the way
that I do, yet sometimes I glance longingly at
product designers and pre-meds and envy how
immediately what they do affects the real
world.
In his essay,"The New Cultural Politics of
Difference." Cornel West elegantly articulates
a problem that faces anyone who tries to un
derstand the world with the aim of changing it:
"few cultural workers of whatever stripe can
walk the tightrope between the Scylla of re
ductionism and the Charybdis of aestheti
cism." he says. For him. reductionists take too
simple a view of the world, thinking, for exam
ple, that everything can be explained using the
correct single-factor theory, such as "crude"
Marxism, feminism, etc. Ilie aestheticians. by
contrast, hold a "hyper-subtle analytical per
spective that loses touch with the specificity of
an art work's form and the context of its recep
tion."
Perhaps, as Facebook suggests. I fall into
this latter category. Maybe I attribute so much
significance to things like "signs and signifiers"
to the point where I am totally out of touch
with material reality. I write about political
change. I take a stance on what I think is right
and wrong in society, yet how often do I de
scend from my ivory tower to be politically ac
tive or to try to correct what I perceive to be
the ills of society? Moreover, the views I ex
press about politics are often not ones that sug
gest any simple and corrective course of ac
tion.
There's some way in which it's more con
venient to explain everything away in words.
Theorists often get themselves into masturba
torv traps like, if every thing, especially lan
guage. is deconstructable. how is it possible to
say anything true? Or. if politics in postnuxJ-

With few hobbies and no
sharply honed talents to
speak of, I generally just sit
around and think a lot.

ern society is just pure aesthetic spectacle, then
how can I escape this and actually enact politi
cal change? These traps are frustrating for
both the theorist and the reader, hut also con
venient in a funny way.To those who subscribe
to them, they render any action problematic at
best, futile at worst. In this capacity, they can
easily be used as excuses to justify laziness.
If this all sounds awfully highfalutin'.let me
say that 1 think the tension between thinking
and doing is one that plays itself out in all our
lives. We like to think of the decisions we make
as being the product of rational choices. Be
cause of this, we justify doing what we do. but
also not doing what we don't do. Vet often,
under the guise of intellectual justification, we
try to rationalize decisions that may not be so
justifiable. For example, do 1 write about poli
tics more that I engage in them because I think
there's only so much political activity can
achieve? Or do I only convince myself that
most politics are futile in order to excuse my
own complacency? In other words, do 1 sit on
my ass reading and writing instead of volun
teering or protesting because I honestly be
lieve that the former has equal, if not more,
merit?
Of course, when it comes down to it. 1 feel
that both theorizing and acting are important.
We have to conceive of a working notion of the
way the world is before we can decide what ac
tions are worth devotinc our time to.
