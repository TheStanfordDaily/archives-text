GAME NOTES; Stanford first baseman Brent Milleville has
eight home runs and 14 RBI in the team's last 20 games.
The meeting vs. Santa Clara marked the 350 th game
between the two teams. Stanford second baseman Colin
Walsh has reached base in 28 straight games

On Tuesday, Stanford came back from a
steep deficit — six runs — to win against San
Jose State. On Wednesday, though,the eight-run
hole the team found itself in at Santa Clara was
just too much to overcome, as the Broncos
walked away with a 13-9 victory.
The Cardinal (23-20. 10-11 Pacific-10 Con
ference) dropped its first non-conference game
in 11 outings, falling behind 11-3 after the fourth
inning. Stanford quickly worked to reduce the
deficit, scoring five runs in the top of the fifth,
powered by first baseman Brent Milleville's
grand slam: il was his team-leading 11th home
run of the year. Milleville's bat has helped carry
the Cardinal afloat down the stretch, as the sen

however, earning his first save of the year.

tough to come back." sophomore second base
man Colin Walsh said."We battled well, though,
and made it a close game."
Freshman right-hander Brian Busick was
credited with the loss, moving his record to 1-1
on the season, while the Broncos' Corv Hall

pitched four and two thirds innings on the way
to earning his first win of the year. Hall notched
the win. despite allowing six earned runs, a tes
tament to the nature of a game that saw 22 runs
scored in all.
The loss was a disappointing one for the Car
dinal, which was coming into Wednesday night's
game on a three-game winning streak. The
Broncos are certainly on the lower end of the
spectrum of teams Stanford will face the rest of

this season as it tries to qualify for the postsea
son — despite last night's victory. Santa ( lata is
17-2S overall and only 4-11 in the West ( oast
Conference.

to swallow. Stanford sav\ strong performances
