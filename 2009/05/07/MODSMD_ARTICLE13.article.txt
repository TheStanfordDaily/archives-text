GAME NOTES; Stanford first baseman Brent Milleville has
eight home runs and 14 RBI in the team's last 20 games.
The meeting vs. Santa Clara marked the 350 th game
between the two teams. Stanford second baseman Colin
Walsh has reached base in 28 straight games

On Tuesday, Stanford came back from a
steep deficit — six runs — to win against San
Jose State. On Wednesday, though,the eight-run
hole the team found itself in at Santa Clara was
just too much to overcome, as the Broncos
walked away with a 13-9 victory.
The Cardinal (23-20. 10-11 Pacific-10 Con
ference) dropped its first non-conference game
in 11 outings, falling behind 11-3 after the fourth
inning. Stanford quickly worked to reduce the
deficit, scoring five runs in the top of the fifth,
powered by first baseman Brent Milleville's
grand slam: il was his team-leading 11th home
run of the year. Milleville's bat has helped carry
the Cardinal afloat down the stretch, as the sen
ior haseight home runs and 14 RBI in the team's
last 20 games.
Stanford got within two runs at 11-9 in the
eighth inning, with the go-ahead runners on

base and only one man out. Broncos reliever
J.R. Graham came in and shut things down,
however, earning his first save of the year.
"We got down big early, which makes it
tough to come back." sophomore second base
man Colin Walsh said."We battled well, though,
and made it a close game."
Freshman right-hander Brian Busick was
credited with the loss, moving his record to 1-1
on the season, while the Broncos' Corv Hall

pitched four and two thirds innings on the way
to earning his first win of the year. Hall notched
the win. despite allowing six earned runs, a tes
tament to the nature of a game that saw 22 runs
scored in all.
The loss was a disappointing one for the Car
dinal, which was coming into Wednesday night's
game on a three-game winning streak. The
Broncos are certainly on the lower end of the
spectrum of teams Stanford will face the rest of

this season as it tries to qualify for the postsea
son — despite last night's victory. Santa ( lata is
17-2S overall and only 4-11 in the West ( oast
Conference.

off hitter, reached base for his 28th
game in a row,going 2-for-4 and draw
ing a walk. Stanford's currently most
prominent two-sport athlete, junior
Toby Gerhart. went 3-for-5 on the
night with a double and two RBI,
while outfielder Joey August collect
ed two hits and an RBI.
The Cardinal's pitching was shaky
once again, with seven different pitch
ers taking to the mound throughout
the night: 10 of the Broncos' 13 runs
were spread among Busick, sopho
more right-hander Will Krasne and
senior lefty Blake Hancock.
"It's a bit frustrating, but baseball
is a team game — it goes both ways,"
Walsh said regarding Stanford pitch
ers having trouble getting outs. "I'm
sure they get frustrated if we don't get
hits, too."
Stanford will look to recover from
the loss this weekend when it takes on
the New Mexico Lobos in a three
game home series.Though the Lobos
play in the Mountain West Confer
ence, certainly a step down from the
Pac-10, they have been solid all year
with a record of 32-16 overall and 12-
K in conference. In any case, the Cardi
nal knows this weekend's series will
be a pivotal one if it is going to qualify
for the postseason.
"Overall we are playing pretty well
right now," Walsh said. "We know this

coming weekend is really important."

The meeting vs. Santa Clara marked the 350 th game
between the two teams. Stanford second baseman Colin
Walsh has reached base in 28 straight games

On Tuesday, Stanford came back from a
steep deficit — six runs — to win against San
Jose State. On Wednesday, though,the eight-run
hole the team found itself in at Santa Clara was
just too much to overcome, as the Broncos
walked away with a 13-9 victory.
The Cardinal (23-20. 10-11 Pacific-10 Con
ference) dropped its first non-conference game
in 11 outings, falling behind 11-3 after the fourth
inning. Stanford quickly worked to reduce the
deficit, scoring five runs in the top of the fifth,
powered by first baseman Brent Milleville's
grand slam: il was his team-leading 11th home
run of the year. Milleville's bat has helped carry
the Cardinal afloat down the stretch, as the sen
ior haseight home runs and 14 RBI in the team's
last 20 games.
Stanford got within two runs at 11-9 in the
eighth inning, with the go-ahead runners on

base and only one man out. Broncos reliever
J.R. Graham came in and shut things down,
however, earning his first save of the year.
"We got down big early, which makes it
tough to come back." sophomore second base
man Colin Walsh said."We battled well, though,
and made it a close game."
Freshman right-hander Brian Busick was
credited with the loss, moving his record to 1-1
on the season, while the Broncos' Corv Hall

pitched four and two thirds innings on the way
to earning his first win of the year. Hall notched
the win. despite allowing six earned runs, a tes
tament to the nature of a game that saw 22 runs
scored in all.
The loss was a disappointing one for the Car
dinal, which was coming into Wednesday night's
game on a three-game winning streak. The
Broncos are certainly on the lower end of the
spectrum of teams Stanford will face the rest of

this season as it tries to qualify for the postsea
son — despite last night's victory. Santa ( lata is
17-2S overall and only 4-11 in the West ( oast
Conference.

prominent two-sport athlete, junior
Toby Gerhart. went 3-for-5 on the
night with a double and two RBI,
while outfielder Joey August collect

The Cardinal's pitching was shaky
once again, with seven different pitch
ers taking to the mound throughout
the night: 10 of the Broncos' 13 runs
were spread among Busick, sopho
more right-hander Will Krasne and
senior lefty Blake Hancock.
"It's a bit frustrating, but baseball
is a team game — it goes both ways,"
Walsh said regarding Stanford pitch
ers having trouble getting outs. "I'm
sure they get frustrated if we don't get
hits, too."
Stanford will look to recover from
the loss this weekend when it takes on
the New Mexico Lobos in a three
game home series.Though the Lobos
play in the Mountain West Confer
ence, certainly a step down from the
Pac-10, they have been solid all year
with a record of 32-16 overall and 12-
K in conference. In any case, the Cardi
nal knows this weekend's series will
be a pivotal one if it is going to qualify
for the postseason.
"Overall we are playing pretty well
right now," Walsh said. "We know this

coming weekend is really important."
