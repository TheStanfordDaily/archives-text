# Tough road ahead
## Softball closes Pac-10 season with difficult three-game trip 
### CHRIS FITZGERALD DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
Stanford softball. dominant for most of the
season, finishes Pacific-10 Conference play with
arguably the toughest three-game stretch of any
team in the country. The No. 2 Card (44-6.13-5
Pac-10) travels to No. 4 Washington to play on
Thursday before flying south where a three-day,
three-game stretch culminates with No. 3
UCLA (38-9.13-5).
Washington (39-9,12-6) boasts a (lawless 13-
0 record on its own turf and is the only Pac-10
team unbeaten at home.
"I don't think Washington's home field ad
vantage is any different than it is for other
teams, "said Stanford head coach John Rittman.
"It starts with their pitching."
But Washington's pristine slate at home will
be challenged in the early weekend, as Stanford
has already bettered the Huskies twice this sea
son. The Cardinal has shutout the I luskies over
IS innings thus far.
Rittman looks to build on what his team
learned about Washington in Palo Alto.
"The game plan will be the same." he said.
"We need to work the count and be aggressive:
taking advantage of all opportunities is key."
Junior Danielle Lawrie allowed only a half
dozen hits between two games at Stanford, but
earned a loss in both games. I ler effort included
a complete game two-hitter, and a four-hit, 11-
inning effort at Smith Family Stadium in late
March. Stanford picked up wins by scores of I -0
and 2-0.
Lawrie is coming off Pac-10 Pitcher of the
Week honors for a record-breaking sixth time
this year.The Canadian National Team member,
who represented her home country in Beijing
over the summer, helped the Huskies top Ore
eon in consecutive games last weekend. Lawrie

When Stanford flies to Los Angeles for a pair
of games on Friday and Saturday, it will un
doubtedly be jousting for the Pac-10 title, with
current conference co-leaders UCLA.

But Rittman downplayed the effects of trav
el fatigue.
"Fvery team makes this trip." he said." It's dif

team is young and our players can handle it."

AGUSTIN RAMIREZ/The Stanford Daily
Stanford will look to continue its Pac-10 dominance as it travels to Seattle to face Washington
today. The Huskies are a perfect 1 3-0 at home, but have twice lost to the Cardinal this year.
This is quite a turnaround for a
team that lost four of their first five
Pac-10 games, with their only win
against Stanford.
When the Card touches down in
Los Angeles, it will remember that
UCLA handed the team its first
Pac-10 loss, breaking a national-best
28-game win streak. Upended 7-4
on the back of sophomore Monica
Harrison's 4 RBI. the Card strug
gled to touch ace Donna Kerr as
well. Stanford hits just under .300 as
a team, but mustered only four
knocks of any kind against the baby
blue on March 27.
But the Cardinal can back up its

No. 2 national ranking. Winner of
seven straight, Stanford swept the
Arizona schools last weekend, and
senior Stanford ace Missy Penna was
almost perfect. Now 35-4 on the sea
son, Penna fanned 24 hitters and al
lowed just three hits in two complete
games.
Also noteworthy is that Stanford
possesses another prominent right
hander in the circle, with the emer
gence of sophomore Ashley Chinn.
Chinn, who no-hit San Jose State on
April 22, garnered her first win ever
against a ranked opponent on Satur
day.
The tandem will work to shut
down Washington one more time on
Thursday. The first pitch is scheduled
for 1 p.m. in the Pacific Northwest.
