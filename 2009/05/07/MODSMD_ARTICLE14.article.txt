Stanford softball. dominant for most of the
season, finishes Pacific-10 Conference play with
arguably the toughest three-game stretch of any
team in the country. The No. 2 Card (44-6.13-5
Pac-10) travels to No. 4 Washington to play on
Thursday before flying south where a three-day,
three-game stretch culminates with No. 3
UCLA (38-9.13-5).
Washington (39-9,12-6) boasts a (lawless 13-
0 record on its own turf and is the only Pac-10
team unbeaten at home.
"I don't think Washington's home field ad
vantage is any different than it is for other
teams, "said Stanford head coach John Rittman.
"It starts with their pitching."
But Washington's pristine slate at home will
be challenged in the early weekend, as Stanford
has already bettered the Huskies twice this sea
son. The Cardinal has shutout the I luskies over
IS innings thus far.
Rittman looks to build on what his team
learned about Washington in Palo Alto.
"The game plan will be the same." he said.
"We need to work the count and be aggressive:
taking advantage of all opportunities is key."
Junior Danielle Lawrie allowed only a half
dozen hits between two games at Stanford, but
earned a loss in both games. I ler effort included
a complete game two-hitter, and a four-hit, 11-
inning effort at Smith Family Stadium in late
March. Stanford picked up wins by scores of I -0
and 2-0.
