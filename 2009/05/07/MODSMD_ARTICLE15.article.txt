### ZACH ZIMMERMAN DESK EDITOR 
With the title of best in the Bay on the
line, Stanford women's rowing refused to
disappoint its fans that made the journey to
Redwood Shores, despite the less-than-fa
vorable conditions.The No. 4 Cardinal swept
Cal in ITie Big Row. capturing the Lambert
Cup for the first time since 2002 last Satur

day.
One of collegiate rowing's greatest rival
ries. The Big Row was filled with drama,
peaking in the first varsity eight race. Cal was
victorious over Stanford's top eight just two
weeks before at the Lake Natoma Chal
lenge. beating the Cardinal by nine seconds
and making Stanford the underdog heading
into the race.
Hie Cardinal knew it had to jump on Cal
early, and did just that, notching a slim lead
after battling for the initial 1.000 meters. I u
eled by the cheers of its fans. Stanford held
on. crossing the finish line in 6:25.6. nearly
four seconds ahead of the Bears' 6:29.5.
The tense atmosphere did not let up. how

ever, as the varsity tour race proved to be the
tightest ol the regatta. At the start, Stanford
appeared to he dominant, coasting to an
open water lead shortly after the gun.
Stanford's second varsity, although expe
riencing some difficulty in the third 500 me
ters,easily defeated Cal's second eight with a
time of 6:42.5. Cal fought hack, closing the
gap to just a second at the 1,500-meter mark.
I Jnfortunately for Bears fans, this move only
catalyzed a final attack by the Cardinal.The
two boats clashed, but Stanford managed to
prevail, besting Cal's time of 7:39.25 with a
mark of 7:37.66.
