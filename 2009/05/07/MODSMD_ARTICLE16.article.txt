# Omaha still in sight for baseball
## 
### 
Last week, this column focused
on the remaining hope for the
Stanford baseball team's re
turn to Omaha, and since that
column was written, the ('ai dis 3-2 and
is picking up clutch hits seemingly at
will. Going back even further, Stanford
is 9-3 in 11 games played since being
swept at Arizona State, and had won 11
straight midweek before falling to
Santa Clara 13-9.
Suddenly, it seems like the Card
might be able to make the postseason
simply by playing well the rest of the
way and won't need a lot of outside
help if it takes care of things on its end.
C urrently. Stanford sits six games out in
the Pacific 10 Conference, but just
three games out of second place, with
six conference games remaining. If
Stanford continues the midweek dom
inance and keeps finding ways to win
on the weekend, a postseason berth
seems very likely.
Ofcourse it is a lot toask foraseries
sweep no matter who the opponent is.
and with a non-conference series
against a very tough New Mexico team
this weekend before the final two series
of the season against I !S( and ()regon
State, winning all nine remaining week
end games is almost close to impossi
ble. But this team has the hitting, the
starting pitching and the bullpen to win
every single game it plays. Only 12
games remain.and going 9-3 or better is
something this team is more than capa
ble of
Brent MiNeville has completely
shrugged off his cold start and is rein
venting himself as "Mr. Clutch." and
Colin Walsh isgettingon base seeming
ly with ease and is now driving in big
runs as well. Kellen Kiilsgaard and
loby (ierhart are becoming tougher
outs each game, and both are always
threats to drive the ball to or over
the wall Zach Jones is making his hits
count,and gobbling up base runners at
an amazing pace from behind the plate.
Jake Schlander and Adam C Jaylord
have been putting together at least one
huge at-bat a game from the bottom
two spots ol the order for weeks, and
Ben ( lowe s bat is as hot as they come.
Jeffrey Inman and Jordan Pries
were phenomenal last weekend, and
Brett Mooneyham looked great until
the wind turned easy fly-balls into
nightmares. Max Fearnow is coming
out of the bullpen and shutting teams
down lor three or more innings at a
time, and Michael Marshall is quietly
putting together excellent statistics.
And then there is Drew Storen. who
has picked up a win or a save in four
straight outings and is getting it done
even when teams are capitali/ingon his
rare mistakes.
Iliis team looks the best it has all
year right now. and just in time for a
late-season run. It would be a shame to
not see this squad play beyond the end
of May just because of a slow start. I lie
Cardinal can hit. pitch and is playing
some of the best defense in the entire
country, and it finally has that magic
aura back that the 2008°clubcarried all
the way to Rosenblatt.
The team is easily within the top 64
in the country talent-wise, and with a
strong finish. Stanford certainly tie
serves a chance to prove it. And it it
does make it. whoever faces Stanford
better be ready, because this team has
shown it takes a heck of a lot to knock
it down.
