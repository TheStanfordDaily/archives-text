## GSC discusses fate of 750 Pub, replacement Goubaud provides details on new advisory committee 
### ALAN GUO STAFF WRITER 
Last night, the Graduate Student
Council (GSC) discussed the future
of 750 Pub. the student bar located in
the ground floor of the Graduate
Community Center.
The owner of the pub has recent
ly filed a termination of service noti
fication to the University, spurring
the University to search for a new
occupant for the space. According to
the representatives, the owner is not
breaking even, and no longer wants
to operate the pub.
During the meeting, representa
tives voiced students' complaints
about the pub. raising questions
about costs and management of the
business.
"In the survey 1 conducted, stu
dents reported that the drinks at the
pub are overpriced and the owner is
hostile to students" said Earth
Science representative Mary Hoven.
"The management is running it sole
ly as a for-profit business, it does not
have the interest of the student in
mind."
Ryan Peacock, representative at
large and financial officer, echoed
Mary sentiments.
"The pub is not a student bar. it is
really a business that charges more
than other bars in Palo Alto," he
said.
Several options were tossed on
the table for the future of the space.
Matt McLaughlin, president of
Stanford Student Enterprises, the
financial arm of the ASSU. suggested
a a grocery store, in the style of
Safeway, as a replacement.
"Since the 750 pub clearly has
failed. I doubted the business model
of the bar is the way to go."
McLaughlin said.
Others reasoned that that the
space should remain as a bar and a
place where graduate students come
to relax and socialize. They pointed
out the failure of the pub was

inevitable due to the managing
structure of the building.
"Because the rent of place is so
high, no business can succeed in that
place," said former representative
Adam Beberg.
Unlike other community centers,
which are under the jurisdiction of
the Vice Provost of Student Affairs
(VPSA).the GCC and the pub space
are co-managed by Stanford
Housing and Dining. GCC does not
have a uniform body to manage it in
the interest of its student audience.
The shared oversight also puts many
external constraints on the vendor.
According to Justin Brown, rep
resentative at-large,the rent is $3,000
per month, while the vendor is only
making $1,000 per month after pay
ing its employees â€” forcing any
future vendors hoping to break-even
to increase prices charged to the stu
dents.
Peacock proposed negotiating
with the administrators to eliminate
the rent and sought collaboration
with SSE to establish an inexpensive,
vibrant student-bar run by students.
"Other schools have successfully
done this [student-run bar],"
Peacock said, citing examples such as
the Princeton Bar.
At the meeting. ASSU President
David Gobaud '10 also provided
details about the forthcoming Vaden
Advisory Committee, which seeks to
look at the health needs of the stu
dents in great detail. According to
Gobaud. the committee, led by Ira
Friedman, director of Vaden, will
consist of three Vaden staff, three
undergraduates and three graduate
students.
The body also discussed the mis
placed music equipment that repre
sentative Noa Lincoln has recently
begun to recover.
The council bought about $8,000
of music equipment for the general
access of graduate students. Due to
poor management, most of the
instruments have been misplaced,
and the GSC has only in possession
$2,000 worth of the instruments, still
without a proper place to store them.
