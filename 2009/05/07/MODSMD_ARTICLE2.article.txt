## Sororities feel left out of housing talks Administration promises to work with Greek system on new rules 
### ERIC MESSINGER DESK EDITOR 
Last week, the University administration
announced that housed sororities at
Stanford must give in-house preference to
seniors and juniors, causing sorority leaders
to express concern over the effect that the
new housing rules will have on the Greek
experience.
In a letter to all housed sorority members.
Office of Student Activities (OSA) Director
Nanci Howe and Residential Education
Director Deborah Golder said that the new
policy was the result of the dilemma posed
by bringing a larger-than-normal pledge
class into the sorority system, while still
catering to the wishes of seniors.
"Although we recognize the value of all
new members living together, we felt that
priority for senior honors recent sorority
housing practices and fulfills the tenets of
the University Housing Master Plan and the
Draw Task Force," they wrote.
I lowe told The Daily that one of the main
reasons for the new rules being implemented
was the unexpected surge in the size of
pledge classes, which was a result of an
increase of over 20 percent in the number of
women rushing. However, she promised to
work closely with the students in order to
resolve any issues that the new rules may
have caused. She commended the student
leaders in the Greek system for their cooper-
ation throughout this process.
"Everyone at Stanford has opin
ions about things." she said. "And
the people involved are doing a
really good job of trying to balance
them."
But sorority leaders have
expressed dissatisfaction with the
level of involvement they had in
making some of these crucial deci
sions.
"This year posed an unusual
challenge in regard to sorority hous
ing. requiring the three housed
sororities (TriDelt, Theta and Pi
Phi) to work closely with the OS A.
Housing and ResEd," wrote Inter
sorority Council President Ali Fox
'09 in an email to The Dailv. "While

the Housing and ResEd offices have
been most incompatible and resist
ant to the needs and desires of the
housed sororities. I am pleased with
the poise with which each sorority
handled the situation and found
solutions that each of their chapters
could agree upon. 1 fully support the
resolutions each sorority has adopt
ed to accommodate their housing
needs."
TriDelt President Cristina
Cordova '09 said that while the
unexpectedly large pledge class was
a major factor behind the housing
problems, they also resulted from
the administration's failure to ade
quately include sororities in the dia
logue.
"The si/e of the pledge classes is
the main problem," she said. "But
the fact that we were taken away the
right to deal with this problem as
autonomous organizations ampli
fied it."

"Communicating with the OSA,
Housing and ResEd was confusing
and challenging throughout most of
ihe decision-making process." added
TriDelt Resident Assistant Kelly
Peterson '09. "However. I felt very
well-supported by our Residence
Dean. John Giammalva, who wasn't
directly involved with the housing
changes being implemented, but
was always willing to listen to our
concerns."
Cordova also criticized the fact
that the new housing rules only
apply to sororities, but not fraterni
ties.
"The fact that sororities are
forced to follow this new policy, but
fraternities are not. adds to the
problem," she said. "Sororities are
being unfairly targeted and forced
to house in the preference |order| of
seniors, juniors, then sophomores
and fraternities are allowed to
house however thev choose. There is

gender inequity that results from
the enforcement of this policy."
Now that each of the sororities
has created a plan to address the
new policy and submitted a list of
members who will live in their hous
es next year, tension regarding the
change has calmed. But sorority
leaders say that the way the admin
istration imposed the new policy has
left them unsatisfied.
"While I'm happy with the end
result of this process, with all our
new members being able to live in
the house. I feel that we could have
avoided a lot of grief and stress if
the administration had made
greater efforts to communicate with
our chapter leadership earlier on in
the quarter, and learn more about
the issues at stake before enforcing
any drastic changes." Peterson said.
