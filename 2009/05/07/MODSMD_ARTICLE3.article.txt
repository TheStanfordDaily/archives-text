## Stanford researchers tackle swine flu Scientists say there are no easy treatments for potential pandemic 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
Research teams at Stanford Medical
Center are hard at work conducting different
studies in an effort to find treatment for the
MINI influenza strain — more commonly
known as swine flu — that has sparked fears
of a global pandemic in recent weeks.
Dr. Nayer Khazeni. an instructor in pul
monary and critical care medicine and an
associate at Stanford's Center for Health
Policy, has led her team to adapt their past
research on influenza to the demands of the
current health climate. One study entails a
computer simulation of a pandemic influen
za outbreak in areas such as New York City.
Designed over two years ago to cope with
the HSNI strain, known as avian flu. this
research is geared toward developing strate
gies in the event of a pandemic. The second
research area focuses on using treatment
drugs against influenza, such as Antiflu and
Relenza, in a preventative manner over long
periods of time.
"Pandemic ways can go on for very long
periods of time — usually at least six to eight
weeks," Khazeni said. "So. we are doing a
special quantitative statistical analysis of all
the data on trials that have administered pre
ventative antivirals for long durations to get
a sense of how safe and effective they would
be for prevention in a pandemic setting."
While both of Khazeni's teams are close
to reaching conclusions and prepar
ing publications of their results, she
declined to discuss their findings in
detail.
The constant mutation of the
influenza virus makes it incredibly
unpredictable and hinders experts
from providing a one-time cure for
the influenza.
"These situations are difficult
and we don't have sort of black-and
white answers and treatments,"
Khazeni said. "I don't anticipate
that something necessarily dramati
cally different in terms of treatment
is going to emerge during this cur
rent epidemic. But. there are still
very interesting potential vaccina
tion strategies for the future."
In fact, she pointed out that other
research endeavors at Stanford are
focusing on the development of a
universal influenza vaccine, which

will target the more consistent anti
gens of influenza. Such a vaccine
would facilitate the treatment of a
host of influenza viruses, including
the strains responsible for pan
demics. Die vaccine is too early in
development, however, to run clini
cal trials.
According to growth charts dis
played on the Web site of the Center
for Disease Control and Prevention
(CDC), swine flu has infected indi
viduals in 21 different countries and
41 US states as of 11 a.m.
Wednesday. A total of 647 cases
have been reported within the U.S..
including two deaths. Relative to the
36.0(H) influenza-caused deaths in
the U.S. each year, the swine flu
numbers may appear less trouble
some than originally expected.
"Severity can be defined on a
number of levels," Khazeni said.
"We [can] measure it in case-fatality
proportion — a ratio of number of
deaths per number of cases. Based
on just this.it would be premature to
call this a severe epidemic, but you
could look at it in others ways such

as the fact that it is a novel virus
with human-to-human transmission
which is spreading globally."
Although she discouraged acute
anxiety over the recent develop
ments in the HINI strain. Khazeni
stressed the importance of paying
attention to any signs of the flu, tak
ing immediate action and following
preventive measures as advised by
the CDC
