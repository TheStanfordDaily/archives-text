## Stanford researchers tackle swine flu Scientists say there are no easy treatments for potential pandemic 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
Research teams at Stanford Medical
Center are hard at work conducting different
studies in an effort to find treatment for the
MINI influenza strain — more commonly
known as swine flu — that has sparked fears
of a global pandemic in recent weeks.
Dr. Nayer Khazeni. an instructor in pul
monary and critical care medicine and an
associate at Stanford's Center for Health
Policy, has led her team to adapt their past
research on influenza to the demands of the
current health climate. One study entails a
computer simulation of a pandemic influen
za outbreak in areas such as New York City.
Designed over two years ago to cope with
the HSNI strain, known as avian flu. this
research is geared toward developing strate
gies in the event of a pandemic. The second
research area focuses on using treatment
drugs against influenza, such as Antiflu and
Relenza, in a preventative manner over long
periods of time.
"Pandemic ways can go on for very long
periods of time — usually at least six to eight
weeks," Khazeni said. "So. we are doing a
special quantitative statistical analysis of all
the data on trials that have administered pre
ventative antivirals for long durations to get
a sense of how safe and effective they would
be for prevention in a pandemic setting."
While both of Khazeni's teams are close
