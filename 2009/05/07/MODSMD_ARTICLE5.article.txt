"These are tough

He argued that that the poor state

"The fact that there is more of a

— all of that is really a chance to
make products better.'* Ballmer
said.
While he accepted thai Un
economic crunch meant
that funding has been
cut down, he argued
that there is still
more money

available than there are good, innova

"I don't think the contraction will

aren't going to get I'muling." Ballmer
said.
Indeed, he cited hotli Microsoft
and General Electric as evidence of
companies that were hoth started in
recessionary periods.
The software executive called the
economy "really had." and gave a sim

phase of resetting at
a lower level than it
was before this economic crisis.

"These are times that are rich in opportunity''
— STEVE BALLMER, Microsoft CEO



ALEX Vlf/The Stanford Doily
Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer told
students in a packed Memorial
Auditorium that the current economic
environment has created great
opportunities for start-ups.
The problem with software, how
ever. was not that people did not
want to buy computers. The difficul
ty. Ballmer explained, is that unlike
physical goods, software does not
break over time, so companies need
to work hard to ensure people want
to upgrade their software. At the
same time, software products are
only as good as their last couple of
versions.
"Windows is only as good as its
last release ... or two," Ballmer
said, as the audience laughed at the
subtle reference to Windows Vista, a

version of Microsoft's popular oper
ating system that has been beset
with problems.
When asked about Microsoft's
unsuccessful bid to buy Yahoo! last
year. Ballmer spoke of the opportu
nity of teaming up with the search
engine in order to target more cus
tomers and create a "better search
product."
Tech blog Tech Crunch reported
that Ballmer has been in the Bay
Area since at least the weekend,
sparking rumors that Microsoft and
Yahoo are closing in on a deal
involving cooperation in the search
market.
"Google's a very big company in
search." Ballmer said. "We're more
like a startup than a big guy in
search. We can't invest in everything

the market leader can."
While he would not comment on
possible discussions that the two
companies may he engaged in. he
said that he thought a merger would
have been "valuable."
"I'm glad we went down the
road." Ballmer said.
He added that while Microsoft
can't afford to out spend Google in
the search business. Microsoft has
less revenue to protect and so can
afford to take more risks.
"There are some things we have
an opportunity to do precisely
because we are not the market
leader." he said. "We can experi
ment with new business models. We
have less to lose than the market
leader does."
Ballmer did admit, however, that

not all risks would be successful.
"We'll try some new products
that are going to be a disaster." he
said, pointing to Microsoft Bob as
an example. "It wasn't terrible, it
flopped miserably, but I am glad we
did it."
Still, despite the economy.
Ballmer was optimistic about the
future. He saw a world in which
there was less debt, more innovation
and productivity and noted that it is
a great time for start-ups.
"Students are coming out of
school at a better time than me and
Bill." he said. "It is a phenomenal
time to be starting all kinds of com
panies."
