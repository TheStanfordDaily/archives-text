Tuesday, Microsoft CEO Steve
Italliner gave an upbeat speech at a
packed Memorial Auditorium yester
day afternoon, telling the audience
that his company is hiring and that
there is 110 better time to start a busi
ness.
"These are tough
economic times, hut
these are times that
arc rich in opportuni
ty," Ballmer said. "I
don't think the con
traction is dramatic
enough that we're

not going to see strong ideas come
through/'
He argued that that the poor state
of the economy forces entrepreneurs
to locus on innovation and the success
of their products, services and compa
nies.
"The fact that there is more of a
'critical screen," the fact that cus
tomers are pickicr with their mono
— all of that is really a chance to
make products better.'* Ballmer
said.
While he accepted thai Un
economic crunch meant
that funding has been
cut down, he argued
that there is still
more money

available than there are good, innova
tive ideas.
"I don't think the contraction will
he strong enough that really big ideas
aren't going to get I'muling." Ballmer
said.
Indeed, he cited hotli Microsoft
and General Electric as evidence of
companies that were hoth started in
recessionary periods.
The software executive called the
economy "really had." and gave a sim
ple explanation f<»r the worldwide,
hnancial crisis.
"The world bor
rowed too much
money," he said. "It
really is. a tough,
tough, tough envi
ronment."
The Microsoft
chief then argued
that the economy
is in a multiycar
phase of resetting at
a lower level than it
was before this economic crisis.
lie argued that all the consumer
and business debt was now being
Unshed out of the Hnancial system
and that it won't be replaced (piickly.
because after an economic crisis, indi

\iduals do not immediately start bor
rowing again.
Ballmer. to the amusement of the
audienee. recounted his earl) days at
Microsoft, including , when he
dropped out of Stanford's business
school to join Bill Gates at the then-
Hedging company. He pointed out
that, though he knew how to read a
balance sheet, he did not have real
business experience.
"All I'd ever done is interview for
and market brownie bits,"
Ballmer said, referring to his two-year
stint at Proctor and (iambic as mi
assistant product manager.
But. Ballmer noted, it was not
much of a risk to leave school, as he
could return to Stanford if the busi
ness failed.
"The> still have a spot for me if I
want to go back and finish im MBA."
he joked.
S et his decision to drop out of busi
ness was not well-received at home.
**M> parents thought I had lost m\
mind." he said. "M\ dad said 'What
the heck is software?" and im mom
said 'Win the heck would anyone
want a computer?"*
