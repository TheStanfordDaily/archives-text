## Draw deadline nears for students Housing encourages students to apply long before 6 p.m. Sunday deadline 
### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With the May 10 deadline for housing applications
approaching quickly. Housing Front Desks across campus
arc becoming more and more popular, as a swell of students
with last-minute questions concerning their living situations
next year seek advice and information, especially with this
year's changes to the Draw.
"There are always many questions from students around
the Draw.but we have seen a slight increase (probably about

20 percent) in the traffic in our office and at the Housing
Front Desks this year." said Sue Nunan. director of Housing
Assignments.
With several changes to the Draw this year, including a
three-tiered preference system put in place, Student
Housing is doing its best to answer any questions students
may have by providing several information sessions in din
ing halls and elsewhere around campus.
"Student Housing is committed to informing students
about the changes to the 2(H) 1 ) Draw." said Executive
Director of Student I lousing Rodger Whitney.
Whitney went on to list the three Draw forums conduct
ed bv Housing, in addition to numerous information tables
put out in dining rooms and in White Pla/a.
"Students are turning out for the forums and visiting the
information tables with their questions, so we feel these
efforts are very effective." he added.
Information tables have been held daily from 11:30 a.m.
to 1:15 p.m. during the past week. Remaining tables are
scheduled for Florence Moore on Thursday and Rranner on
I ridav.
Housing Assignment staff members have also been
attending house meetings when invited, and according to
Whitney.the> will be available from 1-5 p.m. this Sunday to
answer hist minute questions. Applications are due at h p.nv
that day.
"We encourage students not to wait until the last minute
to apply for housing ;is Axess only allows a certain number
of students in the system at one time." Nunan said. "II you
still have questions, visit an information table, stop by your

Housing Front Desk, stop bv Housing Assignments or write
to us at housingassignmentsO' lists.stanford.edu
Whitney added that a special newsletter has been creat
ed this year detailing changes made to the Draw. Emailed to
all students twice, it contains a worksheet students can use in
preparation for entering their application.
According to Whitney, paper copies of the newsletter, as
well as the worksheet, are available at I lousing Front Desks,
the Housing Assignments Office, and at the information
tables. The Housing Web site has also been revised, with
information available at http Draw2(KW.stanford.edu.

Number of pre-assignments
increases from last year

Pre-assignment results for select housing options came
out on April 27. which include houses that are ethnic-, aca
demic- or focus-themed. as well as co-ops.
Associate Director of Residential I ducation Nathaniel
Boswell noted that Branner. which will become a public
service focus dorm for upperclassmen next year, had the
highest number of applicants based on approximate num
bers of total applications. Casa Italiana and Freshman
Sophomore College followed with similar popularity.
When asked if more pre-assignment applications were
received this year. Boswell said that
it was difficult to tell.
"It's difficult to answer this ques
tion because we're essentially com
paring apples and oranges as the pri
ority policy was in place last year,
and this year it is not," he said. "In
general, there were more pre-assign
ments this year, but there were also
many more houses offering pre
assignment."
Boswell also noted that the statis
tics for pre-assignments tend to vary
drastically from year to year, regard
less of this year's changes.
While he was hesitant to specu
late the exact admittance statistics as
the exact numbers are still being
finalized. Boswell shed light on the
selection process.
"The process was hectic as we
were trying to implement the many
changes associated with the recom
mendations of the Draw Task Force in
a short period of time," he said. "We
intend to work with the various focus
and theme houses to improve the
process next year as we want to sup
port all theme and focus programs."
Ram Sachs '12, applied to Kairos.
a co-op house. Happy that he was
accepted, Sachs still expressed his
sentiments that the pre-assignment
process was far from perfect.
"It was sort of confusing: there
was a bit of a disconnect between
what the house staff was expecting

and what Housing wanted in terms
of the application," Saehs said. "It
was a hit unclear with what the spe
cific house requirements were."
In order to apply to live in a co
op, students must complete a job and
a house tour prior to the Draw dead
line. If these aren't completed and a
student ends up being placed in a co
op, they are taken out and placed
into dorms with spots open, which is
not always an ideal situation
For ihe time being, Boswell
thought that most students were
pleased with their assignments,
although there were flaws in the
application process.
"The greatest complaint we heard
was directed toward a lack of clarity
around which houses would be asso
ciated with using which tier in the
housing draw, which is understand
able." he said. "With so many

changes being made at once, there
are bound to be some complica
tions."
"Overall. I didn't think it was pub
licized enough," Sachs said. "I had to
find out about it [pre-assignments]
on my own. It was a hard process,
and I had to ask around and figure
things out by asking people I knew."
Sachs also said that the pre
assignment Web site seemed to be a
work in progress.
"I think just making it much more
clear and obvious exactly what the
requirements are for each house and
how to get in touch with people
would be best." Sachs continued. "It
was sometimes hard to get in touch
with the staff. As a freshman, it was
difficult to figure out."
