## GOLD MINE OF METAPHORS Stanford grad Brad Pasanek '06 creates a searchable data mine of mind metaphors 
### AMY JULIA HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
According to Aristotle, metaphors
cannot be taught. But metaphors
of the mind can be. proved Brad
Pasanek Ph.D'o6.an 18th-century
literary historian and assistant
professor of English at the University of
Virginia, and D. Sculley, a Pittsburg computer
scientist.
Pasanek provided the literary expertise
and Sculley the technical background to cre
ate the now immense online dictionary of
searchable metaphors of the mind called The
Mind is a Metaphor. The metaphor database
holds more than 8,700 entries and can be
searched by author, genre or subject.
Mind metaphors run the gamut from the
conventional — the mind is a blank slate —
to the bizarre — the mind is meat smoking
on a smoke-jack. This vast ocean of mind
metaphors, boasts the Web site, gives histori
ans and users the ability to track the evolu
tion of thought from Plato to Pvnchon.
The Metaphor Packrat
Pasanek piloted The Mind is a Metaphor
project as an English graduate student at
Stanford in 2005 while working on his disser
tation.
He was interested in tracking the evolu
tion of metaphors of the mind through the
18th century, and had been obsessively index
ing his findings in the backs of books and on
notecards.
Matt Jockers, an academic technology spe
cialist in Stanford's English department, was
aghast at the thought of compiling all this

information by hand, and built Pasanek a
Filemaker program to house his metaphor
collection.
To compile the now almost 9,0(X) entries
on the site, Pasanek took what he calls a
"hunt-and-peck" approach. He browsed
online collections of digital archives by hand,
searching key words like 'mind' and then fil
tering through the thousands of hits, deter
mining which qualified as metaphors.
"This was a draining exercise," Pasanek
confessed, so he jumped on the opportunity
to automate the collection process.
From Spam to Shakespeare
"Metaphors are a very human-understood
sort of thing." Jockers said. "If 1 say that my
love is a rose, how are we going to write a
program that understands that that's not to
be taken literally?"
That was the challenge for D. Sculley, a
machine-learning specialist and childhood
friend of Pasanek's who keeps his first name
secret. Sculley was working for Google at a
Pittsburg office on email spam classification,
but after reuniting with Pasanek at a wed
ding. decided to collaborate on The Mind is a
Metaphor project.
Sculley trained his email spam classifier,
an application in the field of "machine learn
ing" that discriminates spam-filled emails
from normal messages, to hunt for metaphors
of the mind instead of spam.
"If you could give a computer program a
whole bunch of examples of the thing that
you're looking for. it could potentially learn
to identify those things in the wild," Jockers
said, explaining the benefits of a machine
learning approach.
Sculley's classifier program breaks a piece

of text down into many different features or
variables, i.e. the presence or absence of a
word. 'Hie program then processes all these
variables and predicts whether or not a body
of work contains a metaphor of the mind.
"We were really surprised by how well the
program was able to identify the metaphors,"
Pasanek said, citing the software's overall
accuracy of 87 percent.
Pasanek is actively working to expand the
training set by uploading more metaphors,
which improves accuracy, and Sculley is pur
suing improvements on the machine-learning
end.
"I'm trying to find phonetic relationships
around words automatically," Sculley
explained. "For instance, if we could find the
phonetic relationship between 'mirror' and
'looking glass.' you may be able to get more
bang for your buck out of your training data."
Great Text-pectations
So what does one do with a vast database
of 18th century metaphors?
Pasanek says it provides a window into the
evolution of how man has thought about the
mind. He said his research has shown that
metaphors of the mind display an astonishing
persistence despite the Enlightenment fer
ment and revolutionary change that racked
the 18th century.
"This is where the new knowledge is,"
Jockers said. "How has fire been used in
metaphors of the mind throughout this 100-
year period? Is it like a stone that gets thrown
into a pond and ripples outward? Are there
repercussions?"
Pasanek says it is the ability to track the
careers of various mind metaphors that
makes his database rich.

"The classifier is particular
good for clustering." he said. "For
instance, when I clustered 'court
metaphors' during the 18th century. I

found that the Whigs and Tories, despite
holding opposed philosophies, shared many
of the same rhetorical usages. I wouldn't have
realized this without the program."
The program also offers a map to explore
previously unchartered literary waters.
"If, like me, you want to explore more of
the archives than have been read, there are
all of these books that people just haven't
opened in hundreds of years. In some ways,
this is a call to arms for literary history to nav
igate the 'great unread,"' Pasanek said.
"These are tools for exploring the great
unread."
A New Frontier
"We are at one of those watershed
moments in time where in the last 10 years,
something revolutionary has happened and
that something is the digitization of all
books," Jockers said. "It's even bigger than
the library of Alexandria, which you couldn't
process or mine. We now have the opportuni
ty to step back from the individual texts and
look at something else, which is not antitheti
cal to the close reading of the text. 1 call it

'macroanalysis.'"
Jockers says we may have reached a new
frontier of humanities where future study will
be computer-based. The Mind is a Metaphor
is a step in that direction.
"1 have a pseudo-imperial fantasy in
which the database would expand in either
direction," Pasanek laughed. "There's this
idea that we could expand the metaphoric
field backward and forward in time. While
the site does boast that it houses metaphors
from Plato to Pynchon, the density is really in
the IKth century because those are the
metaphors I've collected."
Hut will it be possible to use a metaphor of
the mind detector to create a straight
metaphor detector to mine through the great
unread? Jockers doubts its possibility, but
admits Pasanek and Sculley have the best
shot of anyone. It they succeed. Jockers said,
digital humanities will have reached the Holy
Grail — metaphorically speaking.
