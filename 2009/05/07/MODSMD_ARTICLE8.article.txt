## EDITORIAL Rice debate struggles to find right tone 
### 
For much of last week, the national
media was abuzz with commentary
about a conversation between Con
doleezza Rice and a Stanford undergraduate
that was caught on video and uploaded to
You Tube. ABC's political guru George
Stephanopoulos noted on his blog that it was
the "first time anyone has gotten Rice on the
record" about the Bush administration's
controversial interrogation tactics since the
recent release of Justice Department
memos. Keith Olbermann.host of MSNBC's
"Countdown," featured portions of the
You Tube clip on his show, as did Comedy
Central master of satire Stephen Colbert.
While Rice's revealing comments on her
perceptions of the boundaries of Executive
power have been picked apart bv the pun
dits, the editorial board feels it is also impor
tant to draw attention to the way this conver
sation came about and how we would like to
see a respectful, serious and ongoing dia
logue develop on campus between Rice and
her detractors. But some of Rice's actions in
the video — as well as the behavior of stu
dent groups behind the recent "Condival"
— leave the editorial board pessimistic
about the prospect that any actual construc
tive conversation will develop from this.
First,congratulation is in order for the stu
dents of Roble for posing tough questions
and in some cases rebuttals — to Rice, in
stead of allowing the pressure of the spotlight
and her level of authority coax them into self
censorship. Particular kudos must be given to
the student whose exchange with Rice was
featured in the You Tube video, and, of course,
to the student who was able to capture the ex
change on video. I lere we find examples of
how two students can he politically involved
in two very different ways — one through dis
course. the other through documentation. In
the end. both students helped bring the Stan
ford community into the larger discussion
currently affecting our national culture.
While the students involved with the dis
cussion should be commended for their in
volvement. the O&A with Rice did not go
nearly far enough in terms of fostering real
engagement between the former Secretary
of State and the students. For all the serious
policy debate that the talk did create, it still
fell short of reaching a real academic level of
discourse. Much of the fault for this must be

laid on Rice, who at times appeared conde
scending and dismissive toward the students.
Some of her advice to the student daring to
call her out on her claims — "No, dear,
you're wrong" and "do your homework" —
bordered on hostile.
At the same time, it is important to con
sider the charged atmosphere that greeted
Rice at Roble. Unlike her dinner with stu
dents at FroSoCo last quarter — where
there were no protestors, and students ap
plauded as she entered — the event at
Roble was replete with students dressed up
as mock torture subjects, and featured, of
course, the conversation now on You Tube.
While we remain skeptical that Rice's din
ing-hall tour is as much about academic dis
course as it is about stabilizing her public
image, we give her credit for taking the
tough questions from students. At least once
in the You Tube conversation. Rice waves off
handlers as they urge her to end the ex
change. We have to give her credit for not
blowing off the student as soon as the line of
questioning become uncomfortable.
While Rice's statements have not always
contributed to constructive discussion, it
would be remiss not to address those on the
other side of the issue who have contributed
to the poisoned public atmosphere. Last
week's "Condival" made light of water
boarding and other serious issues, which
brings down the level of public discourse.
The festival's repulsive tagline — so much
fun. it's a war crime! — and its spoofed sup
port from fake conservative organizations
only serve to widen the gulf between liberal
and conservative groups on campus.
The editorial board thinks the communi
ty — and the country — would benefit from
a frank, academic and public exchange of
ideas with Rice and other experts in her
field. Envision a highly anticipated forum at
Kresge or Memorial Auditorium where Rice
publicly debated the merits of the Bush ad
ministration's detainee policies with Stan
ford faculty members such as Philip Zinibar
door Lawrence Lessig. Whether Rice would
ever agree to such a forum is doubtful, but it
may just be what is needed to bring forth a
real level of discussion about this issue. Until
both sides of the issue are willing to address
it like responsible adults, passions and con
troversies will continue to rise in unison.
