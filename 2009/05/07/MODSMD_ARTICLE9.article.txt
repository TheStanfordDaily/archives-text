In the midst of swine flu, a global reces
sion and the most eventful first KM) days of a
new American administration, one ques
tions the need to cast into months past for
news to rant about. However, some might
condemn a rant on swine flu as inappropri
ate, a rant on the economic crisis as tiresome
or a rant on Obama as unacceptable preju
dice Instead. Matt Gillespie offered in his
Monday column something that is appropri
ate. fresh and acceptable prejudice: a rant on
Catholicism.
The controversy surrounds remarks Pope
Benedict made concerning AIDS in Africa.
Curiously, Gillespie omitted Benedict's ac
tual statement. Perhaps he was shielding us
from the "very creepy old German," or per
haps he needed the space for his ad
hominem rambles. Anyway, here are the
Pope's words: "I would say that one cannot
overcome this problem of AIDS only with
money — which is important, but if there is
no soul, no people who know how to use it
(money), doesn't help ... One cannot over
come the problem with the distribution of
condoms. On the contrary, they increase the
problem." Despite Mr.Gillespie's pontificat
ing that this "| has] nothing to do with science
and everything to do with archaic, centuries
old beliefs." our dilettante columnist re
mains factually challenged.
Dr. Edward Green of the I larvard School
of Public Health said. "There is a consistent
association shown by our best studies, in
cluding the U.S.-fundcd 'Demographic
Health Surveys.' between greater availabili
ty and use of condoms and higher (not
lower) HIV-infection rates." In the journal
Science. Rand Stoneburner reported "I 'gan
da has shown a 70 percent decline in HIV
prevalence since the early IWOs, linked to a
60 percent reduction in casual sex ... equiv
alent to a vaccine of HO percent effective
ness." And he noted. "Despite substantial
condom use and promotion ol biomedical
approaches, other African countries have
shown neither similar behavioral responses
nor HIV prevalence declines of the same
scale." Similar findings are available in other
journals such as The I.ancet and BMJ. Em
pirical science supports Benedict.
Not just the science, but also the Africans.
Martin Ssempa, a Ugandan AIDS activist.

said,"Our successful policy always put absti
nence and being faithful ahead of any med
ical products such as condoms and testing."
Like the Church. Africans see AIDS also as
a social ill. to be addressed at a deeper level
than technology affords. Biologist 1 lelen Ep
stein wisely explained, "When it comes to
fighting AIDS, our greatest mistake may
have been to overlook the fact that, in spite
of everything, African people often know
best how to solve their own problems."
ITius I find it amusing, being African,
when undergrads in California or politicians
in Belgium dramatically play the victim on
our behalf, certainly not at our behest. They
would do well to heed their own advice and
remain quiet about that which they little
comprehend. For our self-admittedly "very
amateurish" columnist, that would include
science, history. Africa. AIDS and Catholi
cism. By my tally, that still leaves Gillespie to
comment on USC and creative fiction.
