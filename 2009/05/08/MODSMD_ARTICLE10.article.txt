# New Orleans Jazz Festival beats on
## 
### 
Only in New Orleans would a church
sell beer to festival-goers to raise
money for a new handicap ramp.
This is just one of the many unique touches
that distinguishes the New Orleans lazz and
Heritage Festival. Celebrating its 40th
anniversary, the festival stands as a testa
ment to the resiliency of New Orleans and
its locals. For seven days over two weekends,
over 400,000 attendants celebrated
Louisiana cooking, crafts and, of course,
music. This festival stands apart due to the
obvious age gap in the attendants, ranging
from the typical partv-hard frat boys to the
grey-haired men and women who come
every year.
The acts included everyone from locals
such as Washboard Chaz to national bills
like Dave Matthews Band. Despite the local
protest against Bon Jovi performing at the
Jazz festival, many of the 90,000 attendants
on this past Saturday nonetheless went to
the main stage to hear Bon Jovi's new songs
and '80s classics like "Shot Through the
Heart." The other chunk of the crowd wait
ed for Kings of Leon, an "indie" band that
has now become synonymous with festivals
across the country, on the opposite side of
the park.
The Neville Brothers are a Jazz Fest sta
ple but their best acts occurred when they
performed individually. Aaron Neville
brought in a crowd that was twice the
capacity of the Gospel tent, causing the
NOPD and Fire Department to delay the
show until the crowd numbers were man
ageable. Some of the most upbeat perform
ances were from relatively unknown names
that patrons stumbled upon on their way to
the port-a-ports: Jazz trumpeter Sharmarr
Allen woke the crowd up with his rendition
of Nirvana's "Smells like Teen Spirit."

Though jazz and blues are festival essentials,
every genre is represented from country to
rap to indie rock. Across the 11 venues,
there was always someone to discover, even
if only to hear a song or two.
Though the music may draw in the
crowds, the food keeps them coming back.
For the weekend, it was essential to put any
Sprouts or Fraiche California diets on hold
and dive into the distinctive Louisiana cui
sine. There was no shortage of fried food or
butter, but that does not take away from the
distinctive dishes that have made a name for
themselves. Crawfish Monica and Cochon
de Lait are the most popular dishes — festi
val-goers formed lines so long that people
often stopped at another booth just to get a
snack while waiting. Though it is difficult to
know what is in the dishes other than the
main staple of "alligator" or "duck," most
people choose their food simply based on
recommendations from people. The boiled
crawfish shell trails left by experienced
eaters led back to the music.
While the performances at the
Fairgrounds ended by 7 p.m., the music car
ried on through the night throughout the
French Quarter. Some of the best were not
the national names at the House of Blues,
but rather the local street performers like
Grandpa Eliot, who sits at the corner of
Royal and Toulouse with the same red shirt
and overalls every day. Overall, the New
Orleans Jazz Festival is a must-do experi
ence, sprinkled with spontaneous parasol
dancing trains and festive parades that can
only be found in. New Orleans.
