# STAMP shows support for gay right with "Bent"
## 
### 
During a time when queer rights
issues remain controversial, the
Stanford Theater Activist
Mobilization Project (STAMP) addressed
their acceptance of queer rights by putting
on a production of Martin Sherman's
"Bent." With superb performances by the
cast members, STAMP was highly success
ful in conveying their acceptance of love
and queer identity.
Based on Nazi persecution during the
Holocaust, "Bent" was first performed in
1979 on West-End and Broadway produc
tions before the play was adapted into a
movie in 1997. With its depiction of Nazi
persecution of homosexuals, the play
fueled historical research of queer people
who died in concentration camps.
The story focuses on Max (Doc Tor
'11) and his complex relationship with
Rudy (Patrick Ardinger '09) as they are
eventually captured by Nazis and sent to
Dauchau, one of many concentration
camps during the Holocaust. Max then
becomes acquainted with Horst, played by
Patrick Kelly'l2. While the play deals with
a grim matter, the storyline does have

some bits of humorous dialogue that helps the audience to develop a personal connection
with the characters.
From my previous knowledge of the Holocaust, I knew that yellow stars were given to
captured Jews. Pink triangles were given to homosexuals. While I was aware that social
groups were persecuted during the Holocaust, the emphasis in the play on the pink triangle
as a poignant symbol had me realizing that I truly did not know enough about the persecu
tion of homosexuals during this time.
The outstanding performances by the cast really capitalize on the great quality of the
play. The character of Max has a cynical attitude towards his gay relationships due to his
previous experiences. In a number of emotional scenes, Tor really delivers a powerful por
trayal of the character.
The supporting cast of Ardinger and Kelly also should be commended for their excel
lent performances. Ardiner effectively utilizes some over-the-top antics with his portrayal of
the gay dancer Rudy. Meanwhile, Kelly gives an emotional performance as Horst. There are
quite a few intense scenes between Max and Horst, and based on those merits 1 would high
ly praise Tor and Kelly for their acting.
The clever dialogue and writing by Martin Sherman is one of many reasons for the


cast's plausible and effective depiction
of their characters. The interwoven
colloquialisms with the historical con
texts add greater understanding and
sentimentality to the play. Because of
that, I really enjoyed watching the
characters interact.
In a brief discussion with STAMP
after the play, they all were very pas
sionate about queer rights and theater
as a convincing medium for activism.
They cited the recent events of Prop. 8
and the theatrical release of "Milk" as
reasons for choosing "Bent" as their
next production. After asking if the
actors had prior acting experience, I
was surprised that this was quite a few
cast members' first acting experience.
To me, this simply shows the openness
and outspoken attitudes of STAMP to
foster queer rights.
STAMP produces its plays as a
means of political activism, and with
"Bent," the group is particularly effec
tive. The message resonates through
the cast's exceptional performances.
The play will be performed at the
Nitery tonight at 8 p.m., as well as on
Saturday at both 7 p.m. and 10 p.m.
