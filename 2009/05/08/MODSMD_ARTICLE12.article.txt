# "Pop to Present:" an acquired taste?
## 
### 
The Cantor Arts Center held a student reception yester
day evening to feature its newest exhibition "Pop to
Present," which highlights art from the 1960s to today.
During the event, students milled around the museum,
enjoying features of the event like a caricaturist, pipe-cleaner
sculpture and free refreshments.
"Pop to Present" does what any good modern art exhibit
should do: it challenges your definition of art. One painting,
entitled "Study for Fall (Brown)" was simply a brown square.
To be fair, it looked like it took quite a few coats of brown
paint. However, 1 struggled to see it as a work of art. Upstairs,
I encountered a similar work. This was a black square, with ..
. wait for it... a white semicircle attached to its side. Hmm. I
am afraid it was all far too pretentious for my taste.
Walking back to Cantor's stately marble entryway later in
the evening, the sound of a trumpet caught my ear. As a clas
sical cellist, 1 had found what was, for me, the evening's most
interesting and controversial display. Stanford Prof. Mark
Applebaum created a series of 12 pen-and-ink drawings,
inspired from music notation, entitled "Metaphysics of
Notation."
1 would not recommend trying to make sense of these
drawings. Parts of them look like Applebaum went wild with
the font Wingdings. Parts look like my doodles from IHUM
lecture — little airplanes, hearts, flowers and apples. These

intricate designs, at first glance, look
completely unrelated to traditional
music notation. However, upon clos
er inspection and with a pinch of
imagination, I found a few ways 1
could interpret them. For example,
one panel features a series of circles,
which grow bigger and more defined
as they arc. This could potentially be
a visual representation of a crescendo
on an ascending scale.
Student reactions to this exhibit
ranged from bafflement to intrigue.
"Traditional notation cannot cap-

ture all the sounds that instruments
can make," observed Will Basset A

'12, as he and his friends dis
cussed what they thought the A

work meant and what
Applebaum's motives
were in creatine it.

I overheard
one student iok- A

ingly wonder-

ing aloud,

"Is this
guy on
A

drugs?"
and a few

minutes after

staring at the draw
ings, he declared,

"Whatever, I like it." An

enthusiastic girl whispered,"! want to
try to play something based on this!"
In fact, that evening — and indeed
every Friday at noon — musicians are

invited to perform this work by interpreting it however they
like. Tonight's musicians were Stanford students Michael
Berger, Laura Chau, Blair Foley and Devin Mooers. They are
all members of the Stanford Improvisation Collective.
Trumpet player Michael Berger said that he wanted to
emphasize that they were not "improvising blindly" but
rather truly trying to interpret Applebaum's creation. The
musicians also explained how they wanted to create a "spatial
experience" by each starting at a different point in the work
and then converging together in the middle, all while playing
off of each other the whole time.
Personally, I still cannot decide what to think about
Applebaum's vision. He definitely breaks free of the con
straints in music theory and the like, but I believe he finds
himself rather awkwardly caught between composition and
visual art. Music, in my humble opinion, should communi
cate something to its listener — whether a feeling, a mood or
a whole story. "Metaphysics of Notation" is cool, but it
reminded me of a famous quote by Oscar Wilde: "All art is
quite useless."
