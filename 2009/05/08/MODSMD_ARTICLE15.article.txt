# Getting there by air
## 
### 
In the past, Intermission has taken you around the Bay
Area to find everything from cheap eats to high end
feasts. But sometimes San Francisco and environs can't
cut it. Whether you need some deep dish pizza in Chicago,
or you simply find it difficult to enjoy a meal within 500
miles of the Axe and Palm, sometimes getting the right food
requires getting on a plane. So this week, Intermission looks at
how to get there with your sanity and wallet (relatively) intact.
Perhaps the most used airline by Stanford students is
Southwest, which might best be described as the Greyhound
bus of the air. Fares are cheap and the pricing structure is sim
ple. Their fleet, which consists universally of Boeing 7375, is
sparse with respect to amenities â€” but at least but they get you
there in one piece, which is noteworthy considering
Southwest's record in keeping up with FAA mandated safety
inspections. Some may find the open (unassigned) seating
annoying, but at least Southwest doesn't bother with many of
the bogus fees that other airlines have instituted. But customer
service is first rate, and if you're traveling within their relative
ly small, mostly short-haul, network, it's an economical way to
get the job done.
