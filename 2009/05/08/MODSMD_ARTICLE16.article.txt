The low-fare airline was reinvented and the bar was raised
across the industry when Jetßlue rolled out its fleet of A32os,
in which every scat is leather-covered and equipped with
DirecTV. Consistently adding more destinations, Jetßlue's
hub-and-spoke network has grown to almost resemble a lega
cy carrier. Though their main hub is an impressive new termi
nal at IFK, they now offer numerous west coast services, flying
out of three major Bay Area airports. And while it's hard to
argue with the Jetßlue experience, it is worth noting that their
fares frequently are not the cheapest.
