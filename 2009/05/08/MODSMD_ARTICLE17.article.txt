Richard Branson shook things up again with recent intro
duction of Virgin America. Each A 320 is equipped with leather
seats, mood lighting and an entertainment system called Red
that provides live TV, on-demand music and on-demand
movies (for a fee) to every seat. Also with a few taps of the
screen and (if necessary) a swipe of your credit card, your food
and drink selection will arrive at your seat momentarily. The
addition of standard power outlets at every seat and the fleet
wide rollout of Wi-Fi, which is currently in progress, make
Virgin America a runaway for the best domestic coach there is.
And their fares are unbeatable. Destinations are still limited,
but the airline is SFO-based and offers flights mainly to SoCal
and the East Coast.
