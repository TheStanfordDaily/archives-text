### 
If vou rc traveling internationally or to a more obscure
destination, you may still have to brave a legacy carrier. With a
major hub at SFO, United might be the best bet for traveling in
and out of Stanford. If you're traveling to JFK, they offer a pre
mium service with a few extra inches of seat pitch and AC
power throughout coach, but otherwise their domestic has no
redeeming value. And if you ever have to call customer service,
your call will be routed off-shore, to agents who are impossi
ble to understand. You might even think they arc intentionally
misunderstanding you because there is no other way people
could be so clueless.
