American, in most ways,
can be lumped in with United,
though they deserve recognition
for being the only major airline to
offer in-seat power in coach on

virtually all of their planes, though only in select rows and
requiring a cigarette-lighter adapter. If you've got miles to
burn on an upgrade, their 767 fleet has a great domestic busi
ness class, though this aging segment of the fleet (which hope
fully will be replaced by 787s soon) breaks down about as often
as the printer in your dorm's cluster.
