# DELTA AIR LINES
## 
### 
Rounding out the lineup is Delta, which is a relatively
small player in the Bay Area. But with its recent acquisition of
Northwest (known to frequent-fliers as Northworst) is now
the world's largest airline. They still have a lot of work ahead
to upgrade their massive licet, but it seems they are working to
mix the best aspects of both legacy and low-fare carriers. Of
course, they already have a massive global network and are
nonetheless slowly rolling out leather seats and live TV and
on-demand entertainment on more and more planes. This is
complemented by style and professionalism throughout the
Delta experience from their Web site to the crew to the safety
video. It's still hard for them to compete with some of the new
startups, but for an old airline, Delta has made a solid effort to
separate itself from the competition.
