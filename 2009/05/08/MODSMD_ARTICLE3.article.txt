Like most people, you probably don't have a ton of extra
pocket money to go out and spend on new clothes. That's
all right — frugal fashion does exist, and Intermission is
about to introduce some ways to make the old clothes tha
you'd long ago discounted new and fresh again!

BLEACH YOUR JEANS

We all own those jeans that we wore to death three years ago but now sit untouched in
the back of the closet, or those cheap Target jeans we regret buying. Now's the time to put
them back into use! All you need is some bleach, water and a spoon/towel/toothbrush.
• Mix 2/3 water, 1/3 bleach.
• Take everything outside. Use a toothbrush to scrub the bleach onto the denim for a
detailed effect, or use a towel to rub it down if you want to cover bigger areas. Or just use
a spoon to splash it on. Put a newspaper in between the front and the back if you only

want to bleach one side.
• Alternatively you can also do this in the bathtub if you want your jeans to really
change shades. Fill your bathtub with the bleach mix, and soak those pants for 30 min
utes to an hour.
• Then throw the jeans into the washer!

...THEN GO AT THEM WITH SCISSORS

Instead of shelling money on some new shorts, why not just hack at jeans
that you already own? There are actually a lot of ways you can transform a
pair of jeans into shorts (for girls anyway), and here are some of them!

The Sydney Cut
I'rctty simple: instead of cutting your jeans evenly, cut in a diagonal so

that the shorts will be shorter at the outer sides — kind of like booty
shorts but not quite. If you want a frayed effect, use a pocket knife 01

just your hands to pick at the loose threads as much as possible

Add some decoration! Here are some ideas
• Add studs to the belt-loops. 1/4 Standard Pyramid Studs from
www.crustpunks.com would be perfect.
• Use a hole-puncher to punch holes into the denim, and loop chain
or old necklaces through the holes.
• Sharpie away! If you're good at illustrations, why not doodle on
your jeans?
