# That's what B.J. Novak said!

### 
Crowded
into a
small
auditorium, an
audience waited
in ravenous
anticipation for
the comedic tal
ents of B.J.
Novak, a writer,
producer and
actor of NBC's hit
show "The Office."
fhe line outside for

students sans tickets
stretched 50 bodies
long, while students

lucky enough to score
tickets during the

week filed into Annenberg Auditorium. The air was hum
ming with expectation when the ASSU Speakers Bureau
finally opened the show and introduced the two warm-up
acts, both of whom are close friends of Novak from college.
Steve Jabson served as the MC and started a round of bawdy
humor. Dan Mintz, a writer for Comedy Central's "Important
Things With Demetri Martin," had an amusingly deadpan
manner. His jokes, however, sounded like rejects from
Collegehurnor.com.
Fortunately, the opening acts were brief, and when
Novak walked out on stage the crowd erupted with applause.
His first joke, a "That's what she said," won laughs from the
audience as a Pavlovian response. Later jokes about Lien
Franklin also recalled the TV show and the memorable
episode when Jim hires a Franklin impersonator. Novak sur

prised the audience by pulling an adorable frog hand puppet
out of his briefcase for a sketch called "shy puppet." The awk
ward humor in the puppet too hesitant to deliver a joke was
part entertaining and part uncomfortable, not unlike the
atmosphere in "The Office."
Novak pulled off countless one-liners with gusto. Two
memorable ones were: "I bet a crack house starts out as a
really good party," and "My girlfriend's body is like poetry —
it bores me." Among clever witticisms about sleeping, flying,
pandas and Wikipedia, Novak's Spring Cleaning — a clear
ing-out of jokes from years past that were written on note
cards — stole the show. If the audience didn't respond to a
joke, Novak would literally toss it into a garbage can on the
stage. Yet he wasn't tossing many, as nearly all his quips elicit
ed roars of laughter from the crowd.

With jokes about topics like Trident, Novak's comedy
stings like a bee and then sticks with you. Mr. Novak's
positive interactions with the crowd were showcased
when he handed his cards out to fans, notably when an
audience member was the only one in the room to giggle
at a particular joke.
"Mr. Novak was really funny, a true professional, in
command of every second on stage," says Michael Brandt

'11, president of Spiked PunchLine,
Stanford's stand-up troupe. Brandt was
especially keen on Mr. Novak's on-stag<
jokes about "The Office" as calling it "tl
elephant in the room." Similarly, Bjorn
Roach '11, who is a big fan of the
show, thought Novak's performance
was "funny, and he was a lot different
from his character in 'The Office."' J
Keeping with the animal theme, I
bears were the real winner of the

night, according to Jeremy Keeshin '12, one of the founders of
the Stanford Flipside, whose favorite jokes were those that
revolved around polar bears and pandas.
After the show, Novak took time to meet people from
various on-campus groups. Signing autographs and taking
pictures before he left to go hang out at Blue Chalk in Palo
Alto, Novak commented that he was quick to dye his hair
back from the bleach-blonde featured on "The Office."
