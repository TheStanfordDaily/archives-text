# The 						best balls in town!

### 
Bubble Tea. Pearls. Tapioca. Boba. Terms like these get
Stanford students primed for a delightful study break
to one of the area's several pearl milk tea establish
ments.
For the initiated, pearl milk tea is a sweet tea of sorts
usually made with milk and various flavorings ranging from
fruit to root. The pearls, referred to as boba, are the most
recognizable part of the drink. These thick, chewy balls are
commonly made of sweet potatoes, tapioca (cassava root)
and brown sugar.
About 15 minutes from campus, on downtown
Mountain View's happening Castro Street, students are pre
sented with a delicious dilemma regarding boba tea —
there arc two cafes serving the stuff

on opposite sides of the street. Where should you go?
Intermission is here to help you out.
At the junction of Villa & Castro, turning left will take
you to Tapioca Express (TapEx), a franchise of an interna
tional string of boba cafes. The menu is abundant with sev
eral snacks as well as light meals, including chicken, pork
ribs and chicken steak. But don't come here for the food.
After trying the pasta primavera at another boba cafe and
sampling some snacks from others in the area, my recom
mendation is to get your eats on somewhere else, especially
since downtown Mountain View has a lot of edible options
to explore. While the food isn't a good draw, TapEx has a
great feel to it — there's abundant seating, full tables and
pumping Asian music. The drink menu is huge, with

options including flavored milks, juices, tea, the
snow bubble, yogurt, shaved ice and coffee. TapEx
definitely has the edge over Verde in terms of creative

boba flavors, with offerings including the familiar

Thai, strawberry and taro, but also Okinawa,
Green Lei and chocolate milk teas. For the
boba beginner, a good introduction to the
drink is taro or hot hazelnut. While TapEx
delivers strong drinks, I tend to go for two
other reasons: (1) to study or talk with

friends, as TapEx is more spacious than Verde; or
(2) if Verde happens to be closed.

Needing no introduction to the Stanford student pop
ulation, Verde Tea & Espresso Bar is the gold standard for
Stanford area boba. While sometimes crowded and often
loud, the quality of the drinks here more than compensate
for the ambient noise of the cramped cafe. Having tried
most of the menu here, I've learned to stay away from their
snack menu, where items are always drenched in grease.
With that said, the Taiwan Thick Toast is really delicious,
whether it is served plain, with peanut butter or with my
favorite — coconut cream. As for the drinks, stay away from
some of the more exotic sounding milk teas, such as rose
and dark brick. Instead, experiment with other options,
such as adding fruit, jelly or pudding instead of boba pearls
to your favorite tea. When I go with friends, I recommend
the peach or hot taro, both with pearls.
In downtown Mountain View, parking is plentiful and
Castro Street is an excellent place to take an afternoon stroll.
I encourage you to at least try the milk tea at both establish
ments, especially as these boba cafes are open nearly all day
— both cafes open until 11:30 p.m. on weekdays and
approximately 1 a.m. on weekends. Also, it's important to
note that TapEx is usually cash only, while Verde accepts
cards but has a $5 minimum purchase limit.
