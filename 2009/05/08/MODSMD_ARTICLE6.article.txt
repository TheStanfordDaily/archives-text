"Lost," J.J. Abrams is
NO STRANGER TO SHOWS
COMBINING MYSTERY
AND INTRIGUE.

When thinking about the most visionary directors in
Hollywood today, J.J. Abrams is sure to come to
mind. Known for television shows like "Alias" and
"Lost," J.J. Abrams is no stranger to shows combining mystery
and intrigue. His last major motion picture, "Cloverfield," was an
exploration into experimental film making and science fiction.
Today, Abrams new film,"Star Trek" opens with a lot of antici
pation from die-hard fans the world over. Recently, Intermission
got to listen in on a phone call with J.J. Abrams, where he was
asked about his ambitious and enormously awaited new film.
University of Chicago: You are known for visionary television
shows like "Alias" and "Lost." As for Star Trek, J just wanted to ask
if you had difficulties reconciling your own creative ideas with an
already established kind of canon.
J.J. Abrams (J J): You know, the fun of doing something like this is
sort of in embracing the limits. Whenever anyone has said, you
know, you can do anything you want, I've tended to, you know, I
tend to find it much more difficult to respond because there are
no walls to sort of bounce off of. It's sort of, you know, limitless.
And when someone calls me as, you know, Lloyd Braun did
at .ABC five years ago or so and said, you know, I want to do a
story, a TV show about people who survive a plane crash, you
know, immediately I'm like'oh my God, this is awesome'because
I have this sort of plan, you know, a certain sort of set of expecta
tions or limits or rules. And once you have rules, you know, you
can kind of go anywhere or do anything.
So I know it sounds silly, but the rules of Star Trek, which I
was not really familiar with because 1 wasn't really a huge tan to
begin with, were actually sort of a wonderful thing because it
gave us the sort of playground. And then once we were in the
playground, we could do whatever we wanted and we could just,
you know, go nuts.
And I think part of the fun also is taking the established
characters and playing with expectations. For
example, when you meet Chris Pine,
who is this, you

know, kind of hunkv sort of punk
and you go what, his name is Kirk,
Captain Kirk? You know, you know
he's going to be Captain Kirk, but
when you meet him he's hardly a
captain, he's sort of an aimless, lost
guy. So the interesting thing for me
was playing with the baggage that
we inherited and that to me is —
was really part of the fun.
Maryland: Hi, so which character
aside from Kirk and Spock did vou

most look forward to bringing to life in Star Trek?
JJ: I think that the, you know, diev were all interesting to me by
the time we were shooting. At the beginning, I was sort of hard
pressed to kind of connect with any of them, and now I feel like I
love them all.
I would say that selfishly, 1 was most looking forward to
Scottv because I love Simon Pegg so much, and we had worked
together on "Mission Impossible 3," and I was excited to work
with him again. I knew he'd be funny and great. Obviously work
ing with Leonard Nimoy was sort of, you know, a thrill even
though I wasn't a fan going in. I appreciated that he was this leg
end and thought that would be cool.
But as I worked on the movie, honesdy every character
from, you know, Chekov to Sulu and Llhura and, you know,
Bones, they — each of them has such a distinct voice and each
actor who played them, I thought they just did an extraordinary
job. So the truth is it was a total thrill working with each and
every one of them.
University of Florida: With your resume spanning anywhere
from "Felicity" to "Armageddon" to "Joy Ride," "Mission
Impossible," "Cloverfield," and so on, and now with "Star Trek,"
what else do you kind of hope to accomplish in your already
eclectic career?
JJ: I love working on any kind of thing. I mean, I don't care if it's,
you know, a drama or comedy or science fiction or horror film.
You know, I love movies and the idea of doing a movie or
TV show about almost any subject I find, like there's — I can
imagine a version that would be, you know, a thrill to be a part
of. I don't think I'm, you know, the downside is I don't feel like
I've got necessarily any one tiling I'm particularly, you know,
good at, meaning 1 just sort of dabble in everything and master
of nothing.
And so the one thing I would say is that doing a project that

is not a sequel based on a TV show that

.eonard Nimoy starred in because

having done "Star Trek" and also "Mission Impossible," which
Nimoy was also in, I feel like I'm living on this bizarre track of
recreating series that he did in the '60s. So I 'd love to do an origi
nal film next.
University of San Diego: For "Star Trek, what aspects of the
chemistry of the cast of the original series did you seek to recre
ate in this film?
JJ:That's a good question, and I think that, to me, it was impor
tant for the whole movie was to take the spirit of "Star Trek,"
which, again, I never really got into at the beginning when I was a
kid, it never really worked for me, but I've come to understand it
and appreciate it and see what the fuss is about.
And I think that some of the elements — the key element is
the characters. There arc these, you know, terrific characters at
the core. And not for the actors to do impersonations of the orig
inal actors but to, you know, bring their own stuff to it. But that
was the beginning.
Secondly, I love the optimism of the world that Gene
Rodenberry created. You know, for people who don't know about
Star Trek, you know, or for fans, I'll say that the idea that it's a
vision of our future in which, you know, we're alive, we're collab
orating across racial lines, political lines, religious lines, that there
is this inherent optimism for this world that I think is — some
would say — naive, and I would say well that's sad; I think it's
actually incredibly refreshing.
And I think that, you know, as someone who has loved
many films of recent years that have been very heavy and, you
know, shown a future that's been dark and cynical, I still like a lot
of those movies. It's just nice to see a version of the future that is
not post-Apocalyptic and dire.
And finally, I think that the, you know, sense of humor and
adventure that the original promised — I think that they were
always limited in resources, so they were never able to deliver the
kind of adventure that the show often discussed. And because
discussion was cheap, there was a lot of discussion in the early
shows.
And I think that the script that we have, and I think that this
movie, this version of "Star Trek," is a very different animal. It's a
much faster paced, sexier, I think even funnier and more kind of,
you know, adventure-delivering than what they were allowed to
do in the past.

tions or limits or rules. And once you have rules, you know, you
can kind of go anywhere or do anything.
So I know it sounds silly, but the rules of Star Trek, which I
was not really familiar with because 1 wasn't really a huge tan to
begin with, were actually sort of a wonderful thing because it
gave us the sort of playground. And then once we were in the
playground, we could do whatever we wanted and we could just,
you know, go nuts.
And I think part of the fun also is taking the established
characters and playing with expectations. For
example, when you meet Chris Pine,
who is this, you

know, kind of hunkv sort of punk
and you go what, his name is Kirk,
Captain Kirk? You know, you know
he's going to be Captain Kirk, but
when you meet him he's hardly a
captain, he's sort of an aimless, lost
guy. So the interesting thing for me
was playing with the baggage that
we inherited and that to me is —
was really part of the fun.
Maryland: Hi, so which character
aside from Kirk and Spock did vou

most look forward to bringing to life in Star Trek?
JJ: I think that the, you know, diev were all interesting to me by
the time we were shooting. At the beginning, I was sort of hard
pressed to kind of connect with any of them, and now I feel like I
love them all.
I would say that selfishly, 1 was most looking forward to
Scottv because I love Simon Pegg so much, and we had worked
together on "Mission Impossible 3," and I was excited to work
with him again. I knew he'd be funny and great. Obviously work
ing with Leonard Nimoy was sort of, you know, a thrill even
though I wasn't a fan going in. I appreciated that he was this leg
end and thought that would be cool.
But as I worked on the movie, honesdy every character
from, you know, Chekov to Sulu and Llhura and, you know,
Bones, they — each of them has such a distinct voice and each
actor who played them, I thought they just did an extraordinary
job. So the truth is it was a total thrill working with each and
every one of them.
University of Florida: With your resume spanning anywhere
from "Felicity" to "Armageddon" to "Joy Ride," "Mission
Impossible," "Cloverfield," and so on, and now with "Star Trek,"
what else do you kind of hope to accomplish in your already
eclectic career?
JJ: I love working on any kind of thing. I mean, I don't care if it's,
you know, a drama or comedy or science fiction or horror film.
You know, I love movies and the idea of doing a movie or
TV show about almost any subject I find, like there's — I can
imagine a version that would be, you know, a thrill to be a part
of. I don't think I'm, you know, the downside is I don't feel like
I've got necessarily any one tiling I'm particularly, you know,
good at, meaning 1 just sort of dabble in everything and master
of nothing.
And so the one thing I would say is that doing a project that

is not a sequel based on a TV show that

.eonard Nimoy starred in because

having done "Star Trek" and also "Mission Impossible," which
Nimoy was also in, I feel like I'm living on this bizarre track of
recreating series that he did in the '60s. So I 'd love to do an origi
nal film next.
University of San Diego: For "Star Trek, what aspects of the
chemistry of the cast of the original series did you seek to recre
ate in this film?
JJ:That's a good question, and I think that, to me, it was impor
tant for the whole movie was to take the spirit of "Star Trek,"
which, again, I never really got into at the beginning when I was a
kid, it never really worked for me, but I've come to understand it
and appreciate it and see what the fuss is about.
And I think that some of the elements — the key element is
the characters. There arc these, you know, terrific characters at
the core. And not for the actors to do impersonations of the orig
inal actors but to, you know, bring their own stuff to it. But that
was the beginning.
Secondly, I love the optimism of the world that Gene
Rodenberry created. You know, for people who don't know about
Star Trek, you know, or for fans, I'll say that the idea that it's a
vision of our future in which, you know, we're alive, we're collab
orating across racial lines, political lines, religious lines, that there
is this inherent optimism for this world that I think is — some
would say — naive, and I would say well that's sad; I think it's
actually incredibly refreshing.
And I think that, you know, as someone who has loved
many films of recent years that have been very heavy and, you
know, shown a future that's been dark and cynical, I still like a lot
of those movies. It's just nice to see a version of the future that is
not post-Apocalyptic and dire.
And finally, I think that the, you know, sense of humor and
adventure that the original promised — I think that they were
always limited in resources, so they were never able to deliver the
kind of adventure that the show often discussed. And because
discussion was cheap, there was a lot of discussion in the early
shows.
And I think that the script that we have, and I think that this
movie, this version of "Star Trek," is a very different animal. It's a
much faster paced, sexier, I think even funnier and more kind of,
you know, adventure-delivering than what they were allowed to
do in the past.
"Star Trek" opens in theatres everywhere today.
