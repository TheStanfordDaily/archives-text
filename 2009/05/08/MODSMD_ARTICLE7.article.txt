| ust to get it out in the open: "Star Trek"

J is BACK and it is AWESOME.
After being scrutinized by

the watchful eyes of
Trekkies (definition: avid
"Star-Trek" fans) and

non-fans alike, both had
legitimate concerns about

this sci-fi franchise remake.
You can't blame them; "Star
Trek" is a multi-million dol
lar franchise that is over 40

years old. Combine that
with the fact that most

remakes are very often hit-

or-miss, and you have a whole lot of skeptical
people to please. Thankfully, "Star Trek" suc
ceeds at updating a classic space concept while
appeasing both loyal fans and new viewers.
Before diving into the actual film, let's
first go over the basics. "Star Trek" began, first
and foremost, as a television series in 1966.
The original series was set in the not-too-dis
tant future, where space is explored and kept
safe by the intergalactic force known as The
Federation. The show's story revolved around
a diverse and quirky space crew whose mis
sion was "to boldly go where no man has gone
before," or explore space in their super
advanced space ship, the U.S.S. Enterprise.
The original cast included William Shatner as
Captain James T. Kirk, Leonard Nimoy as
Spock, Deforest Kelley as Dr. Leonard
"Bones" McCoy, James Doohan as
Montgomery Scott, Nichelle Nichols as
Uhura, George Takci as Hikaru Sulu and
Walter Koenig as Pavel Chekov. The original

season was a huge hit because of its theme of
space exploration and the great chemistry and

dynamics among all of the
characters. Since that first
ground-breaking season,
there have been four other
live-action seasons, one

animated season and
eleven feature-length
films — "Star Trek"

(2009) being the latest
addition.
Getting back to
the 2009 release, "Star
i Trek" weaves the story
| behind how Kirk and
Spock became friends

aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise. We also meet
every one of the rest of the ship's crew —
Uhura, Dr. McCoy and (my personal favorite)
Sulu. The film's story begins as a Federation
ship is attacked by an unknown alien ship —
later to be revealed of Romulan origin (anoth
er alien race within the Star Trek universe).
But the fact that those baddies were Romulans
isn't the surprise — as we quickly discover,
they actually hail from the future and have the
only goal of changing Star Trek history as we
know it.
Herein lies one of the film's biggest
strengths. The very presence of these time
traveling Romulans within the story means
that the storyline is new, not a rehash of what
fans originally knew about the Star Trek uni
verse. Uhura, played by the sexy Zoc Saldana,
says it best when she notes that they are now
in an "alternate reality." This little plot device
then accomplishes two important things. First,
it tells all the Trekkies out there that every
thing they know about Star Trek is going to

change. Secondly, it then tells the general
masses that prior knowledge of Star Trek is
completely unnecessary since the plot is
entirely new.
This, in my opinion, is a truly brilliant
set-up. Not only does this formula relieve a lot
of the adaptation pressures on the film and
make it more appealing to the masses, but it
also sets this movie up to be a much-needed
reboot to the Star Trek film franchise — sort
of what "Batman Begins" did for the Batman
series.
But that's not the only thing that makes
this film great. The movie's director, J.J.
Abrams (whose only other film credit is
"Mission Impossible III"), does an excellent

job. Action movies are definitely his forte and
he knows exactly how to make the cameras
work for him. As someone who is constantly
observing camera angles and movement, I can
tell you that Abrams' subtle attention to
details only further adds to the movie's mind
blowing action sequences. Flaying off of this
element, even when the CG effects aren't
blasting off of the screen at warp speed,
Abrams is able to emphasize the depth and
development of the characters, whether they
are in an intense arguments or humorous
interactions with one another.
Character interaction is another stand
out quality of the film. The Star Trek franchise
has always prided itself on its mix of charac
ters and personalities, and I am happy to say
that the movie succeeds again in creating
character depth and relatability on every level.
New actor Chris Fine really digs into the shoes
of the attractive yet brash Captain Kirk, while
Zachary Quinto fits the role of a young and
emotionless Spock almost too perfectly. Most
of the actors within the film arc of minimal
acclaim, but regardless their performances are

truly outstanding. Big kudos to John Cho (aka
Sulu aka Harold from "Harold and Kumar")
and Simon Pegg (Sean in "Sean of the Dead"),
who are able to put their own spins on their
characters. Finally, I was personally surprised
to discover that Aussie actor Eric Bana was in
this film — let alone playing the lead villain! It
was enjoyable to see him in a different con
text.
Touching back on the story, as previously
mentioned, "Star Tr"k" chronicles the lives of
the U.S.S. Enterprise team before they became
the way we know them today. Not to oversim
plify the plot — because it is not simple by
any means — but it basically revolves around
The Federation fighting Romulan threat, try-

ing to determine what they are after and how
to stop them. The film's story is wildly enter
taining and unpredictable, but even so, I have
to say that this film isn't perfect. The pacing
— although very suited to great action
sequences — can come oft manic at times.
Also, even though the time-traveling aspect of
the Romulans helped to frame the overall
film, the concept of time travel, even after
being explained by the characters, comes off
as downright confusing.
Minor flaws aside, "Star Trek" is no longer
just your father's TV series. This film is able to
stand on its own, prior knowledge be damned,
and the franchise is all the better for it. 1
would even go so far as to say that this film
has the potential to be the "Star Wars" of the
modern generation. The summer blockbusters
arc truly here, so beam us up "Star Trek!"

The Federation fighting Romulan threat, try-

ing to determine what they are after and how
to stop them. The film's story is wildly enter
taining and unpredictable, but even so, I have
to say that this film isn't perfect. The pacing
— although very suited to great action
sequences — can come oft manic at times.
Also, even though the time-traveling aspect of
the Romulans helped to frame the overall
film, the concept of time travel, even after
being explained by the characters, comes off
as downright confusing.
Minor flaws aside, "Star Trek" is no longer
just your father's TV series. This film is able to
stand on its own, prior knowledge be damned,
and the franchise is all the better for it. 1
would even go so far as to say that this film
has the potential to be the "Star Wars" of the
modern generation. The summer blockbusters
arc truly here, so beam us up "Star Trek!"
