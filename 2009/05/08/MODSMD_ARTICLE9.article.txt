# CFS stomps down the runway
## 
### 
Stanford students
strutted their stuff
on May 2 in the

largest fashion show on
the West Coast: Charity
Fashion Show (CFS).
With fashion ranging
from exotic couture to
lingerie to men's
underwear and casual

wear, the show was
spectacular and pro

fessional — and

the models them
selves were very

skilled, trained
and classy.

Numerous
designers had
exciting lines.
Among the more
well-known
. designers fea-

' lured on the
runway were

Betsey Johnson,

Claiborne, Oscar de la
Renta and Ralph Lauren. Some of the more excit-

ing clothes, however, came from Tu Tu Blu,
Nanette Lepore, JaiVe International Couture,

Tadashi and Kittinhawk.
Personally, Nanette Lepore was my
favorite designer. Lepore's couture was
gorgeous and every outfit looked per-

feet. The dresses were colorful, flowing

and irresistibly beautiful. I also enjoyed the
presentation of Kittinhawk by Allysum

Dutra. This line had lovely clothes and only uses

vintage and recycled materials, aiming to be classy,

but also eco-fricndly and sustainable.

1 also really enjoyed Jai're International Couture;
the line was different, chic and European. Tu Tu Blu
had cute and trendy dresses, and Tadashi's collection
featured one-of-a-kind pieces created with luxurious
fabrics and hand-embroidered beading. As for more
unconventional eye-candy, I, along with many girls in
the audience, enjoyed the men's underwear expo ...
CFS also hosted a competition around Palo Alto

high schools for prospective designers. Molly
Murphy won the competition and her designs

(MBGXM) were exhibited in the show. Her designs

were beautiful and unique, and I could barely believe
she was just a high school student.
The entire show had vibrant ambience, and the
excitement carried by the models and contributors was
contagious. The runway music was energizing, and
though CFS took place in a white tent on Roble Field, it
had the feel of a high-end fashion show, with countless
photographers and columnists present. The lighting
and stage setup were cool, yet simple, which helped
draw attention to the fashion and the models.
The CFS production is planned by a group of
enthusiasts of the fashion industry who are dedicated
to developing the arts, diversity and entertainment on
the West Coast and beyond. The CFS association of
individuals is highly selective and diverse, including
public relations specialists, models, designers, artists,
financial managers, agents, photographers, business
specialists and Web designers.
"Everyone was really fun and friendly, and 1 devel
oped some amazing friendships," said Raymond Braun
'12, one of the models.

The CFS team works throughout the
year to produce CFS, along with various

other events and photo shoots.

Their mission is to promote an
increased fashion presence
here in the Bay Area and on

the West Coast in general. All

proceeds arc donated to charity

— this year, Doctors Without
. Borders was selected.

Charity Fashion Show actu
ally originated from a dif-

ferent event, the AASA
Fashion Show. That pro
' gram ran for more than

' 10 years as an outlet for
Asian American designers

to promote awareness for

various causes within their

I community. As the event grew,
the focus shifted to national and
global creative causes, linking not
only Asian Americans, but also
other minority groups. Thus, CFS
promotes not only an increased

arts presence on the West
l Coast, but also cultural diver-

sity and multicultural kin-

ship.

"Besides it being a
fun way to meet new

people and loving fashion myself, 1 believe CFS is
very unique at Stanford," said model Raquel Goya
'12. "Fashion doesn't have a major presence on cam
pus, so this was a way to participate in raising aware-

ness about fashion, but more importantly helping

Doctors Without Borders and promoting cul

tural diversity at Stanford and around the
Bay Area."
