## Reconsidering the co-ed dorm room debate 
### 
The National Review Online recently
featured a piece written by Karen Ven
able Morin. a mother of a Stanford stu
dent who was residing in a co-ed room in one
of our co-ops. Following one of the media's
favorite — and oldest — themes about col
lege, the "OMG! Look at what those
naughty college kids are doing with their sex
and alcohol!" it was picked up by I"he New
York Times' "The Choice" blog about col
lege admissions.
Despite the fact that college students
have been havingsex.doingdrugsand drink
ing since the l%()s,the media never ceases to
be shocked! just shocked! at this occurrence.
There is a sense of voyeurism in this — that
college students are doing inappropriate, im
moral things at college — which obviously
interests a lot of people.Tom Wolfe's book "I
Am Charlotte Simmons" sold thousands of
copies for this reason — it purported to tell
what life at an elite university was really like.
The daughter, luckily, was given a chance to
respond, and it went back and forth — a par
ent and child debating the merits of her
mixed-gender rooming situation on the
pages of The Times.
Leaving aside the weird family drama —
the fact that the mother embarrassed her
daughter on a widely read Web site — the
mother also exhibited a grossly distorted
sense of gender relations. She insinuated
that her daughter was at a high risk for sexu
al assault simply due to the fact that one of
her daughter's male roommates drank, be
cause Ms. Morin knows "how closely related
inappropriate sexual behavior and sub
stance abuse are." One would think that in
college, students can form their own judg
ment about what is and what is not a safe sit
uation.
Ms. Morin does not mention at all in her
article that the gender-neutral policy was
created partially to make gay and lesbian
students more comfortable. The question is
to what extent, if at all. religious, politically
conservative conceptions of morality should
determine Stanford's housing policies.
Ms. Morin clearly thinks it has gone too
far. The issue most potentially damaging to
Stanford, and of elite, tolerant colleges in
general, is Ms. Morin's point later in her Na
tional Review piece: "Stanford and many
other colleges and universities do not re

spect their common-sense v;ilues. ITie uni
versity seeks to undermine those values."
Ms. Morin's values, which I certainly respect,
may not be "common sense" to everyone.
Many who commented on The Times' Web
site pointed out that parents cannot expect
to exert the same level of control on their
(now adult) children as they did during high
school. Daisy Morin, the daughter, is 22.
While maybe at 16 that level of parental con
trol is fair and reasonable. Daisy is now an
adult.
My parents sent me off to college confi
dent in the knowledge that they raised me
well enough to make smart choices — my
own choices,even if I chose options they did
not necessarily agree with. (Hi Mom and
Dad!) College is the appropriate time for
that transition to effective independence to
happen.
Ms. Morin could not quite wnip her head
around the fact that her daughter chose to
live in a gender-neutral room, instead choos
ing to spend much time pointing out how the
co-ops are technically not in the University's
gender-neutral housing program. Fact of the
matter is, her daughter made a choice that
was clearly not an impulsive, irrational deci
sion, and it demonstrates a sincere disagree
ment with her mother's opinion and world
view.
Ms. Morin should be confident that she
equipped her 22-year-old daughter to make
the right choice, even if she personally dis
agrees with it.This is something that happens
between adult children and their parents all
the time, and is perfectly acceptable. Parents
cannot expect to make choices for their chil
dren forever.
