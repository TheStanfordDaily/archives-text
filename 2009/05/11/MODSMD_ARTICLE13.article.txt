# Pith and Pleonasm
## Say yes 
### 
With about three years down and less
than five weeks to go, it's over
whelming and a little hit scary to
think back on everything I've learned here,
everyone who taught me (professors and
friends alike) and everything I'm going to
leave behind. Coming toward the end of
something that's wildly transformative and
profound, it's only natural to reflect not only
on all the great memories. All the times you
lost whole nights laughing with friends or
pulled off something so romantic that it
should have had a Snow Patrol soundtrack in
the background,or looked out at AT&T field
at Senior Formal and wondered how you
could have been lucky enough in life to be
there at that moment.
Natural too, then, is to reflect on the bad
times, the mistakes, the ones you wish you
could have back. While introspection is
something I normally try to avoid like the
plague, particularly when my quarter's M.O.
has been to have as much fun as possible at
all costs and invariably deny the onslaught of
grocery check-out lines and conference calls
that comes along with the real world, lately,
when really thinking back on the things I re
gret, they all have one basic thing in common.
ITiey all involve me. in some way. saying
no.
No is probably the easiest thing in the
world to say, because it almost always in
volves protecting ourselves from a risk or
chance that makes us scared or uncomfort
able. "Do you want to go out tonight?" "No,
I'd rather recheck my homework." "Do you
want to try this super interesting looking
class even though you don't have the pre
reqs?""No, I'm not about to screw my GPA."
"Do you want to tell me how you're feeling?"
"No. I don't."
No is how we cut ourselves off from op
portunity and challenge and cling to what is
expected of us and what we expect of our
selves, and these expectations almost always
come from a dull and bleak kind of place
that's rooted in nothing but external meas
ures of worth and value that are in no way
original.
I"hinking about my own regrets, what I
wish I got another shot at. I basically have

never done anything in a summer that I can
remember fondly or really be proud of, and
no is absolutely what got me there. No is what
made me not travel abroad for a summer to
fulfill the language requirement (meaning
that no is also what landed me with a 9 a.m.
Monday-Friday Spanish class my last quarter
of college). No is what made me not apply for
journalism internships. No is what made me
turn down three different offers to travel
with family members to Hurope.
Where no did get me was a 60-hour-per
week. unpaid internship in a San Francisco
hospital, where I made myself a doormat for
various medical egos in the hopes of some
day becoming a very serious and very similar
medical ego myself. No also got me to take
summer school last year instead of doing one
of the roughly 3,949.924 more interesting
things I could have done with my time. No is
what made me tell myself I had to be a doc
tor when even my family wasn't telling me
that.
No was a small box. a ball, a chain, a shal
low and narrow way of looking at the world
that consisted of me trying to imagine other
people's expectations of me and then turning
down every interesting thing that came my
way if it meant deviating from that very silly
path. No is the kind of thing that makes us
scared to like the wrong movies, write the
wrong poems, love the wrong people. No is
what gets us putting ridiculous assessments
of value onto things that, universally speak
ing. could not possibly matter in any way
(C «od willing, I'll forget which fraternity I was
in by the time I'm 30 and just remember the
friends I made).
I don't know if it's Stanford that taught me
to say no so much.or if I. like I did with every
other expectation I used to think was on me,
just taught it to myself. Hut this year in partic
ular. I've really worked hard at saying yes.
Yes.so far. has turned my life at Stanford into
so much more than I thought it could be. Yes
got me to give up the medicine idea and leave
it to people who will actually be brilliant and
passionate about it and not just force them
selves in without thinking about it.
Yes got me the last seat in a carpool to

Wallace even though most people whose lit

hack, and by virtue of this, saying yes got me

remember glycolysis or the prisoner's dilem

everything to do with a life that"s full of free
