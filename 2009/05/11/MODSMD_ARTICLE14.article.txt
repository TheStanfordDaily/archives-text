of the emotion of the crowd.

perdine that we had to he ready for a battle,"
Klahn said."They always come out with a lot
of energy and lire, hut we were ahle to get a
quick start in the doubles and take the energy
out of them. The crowd also played a big part
in the doubles, creating an incredible atmos
phere.and really helped us jump on them from
the start."
The Cardinal continued to build on its suc

bet Pepperdine's Alejandro Moreno, and
Thacher bested Wave Alex Llompart. 6-2. 7-
6(2). With these wins. Stanford made up for a
rare singles loss by Klahn against opponent
Omar Alt man n. 6-3.6-3.
"The team really stepped up against Pep
perdine, and it was a complete team effort,"
Klahn said.'One of the great things about this
team is that it is always a different person each
match that has the ability to raise their level
and provide a clutch win when another person

has an off day."
Stanford will continue its NCAA battle
against No. 8 DSC on Thursday. Ilie Cardinal
split meetings with the Trojans earlier in the
seasons, winning 4-3 in February and falling by
the same score in March.
Although the Cardinal will no longer have
the home court advantage that the first and
second rounds brought, this weekend offered
the team some momentum, and Stanford be
lieves it will be ready for the Trojans in College
Station.
"We have another great opportunity ahead
of us against USC on Thursday, and are expect
ing another hard-fought match." Klahn said.
"Everyone will be looking for revenge after
losing a tough 4-3 match here at the end of
March."
