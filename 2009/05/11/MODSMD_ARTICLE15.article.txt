First baseman Brent Milleville still has
nine games left in his Stanford career, hut late

Led by the bat of the senior, the Cardinal

back from a 7-1 decision this past Friday to
take two of three from New Mexico, the sec

ence (33-18 overall).
Milleville recorded an astronomical 11
RBI in Stanford's two victories over the
Lobos this past weekend — he hit two home
runs during Saturday's 17-5 victory before
serving up an encore performance on Sunday,
hitting a second inning grand slam (his 14th
home run on the year) to give the Cardinal a
lead it would never relinquish. The 17-run
total was the largest of the season so far for
Stanford.
"I'm seeing the ball well." Milleville said.
"My swing feels good."

Boosted by the run support, freshman left
hander Brett Mooneyham pitched seven and
a third solid innings, earning the win and im

hurler. he did not issue a single walk.
"No walks —I was pretty excited about
that." Mooneyham said.
"It was a very good day for Brett, very

"It's just one of those days. It was a good of
fensive day. just kind of funny that way."

the plate with the bases loaded, and
his bat did the rest of the work.
Milleville's slam made it 9-1, and
the Cardinal effectively cruised the
rest of the way behind the pitching of
senior right-hander Max Fearnow,
who went five and two thirds innings
to move his record to 4-3 on the year.
Fearnow entered the game when jun
ior starter Jeffrey Inman was taken
out after facing just one batter — no
official explanation was given for
Inman's short outing.
"Max did great, we have a lot of
guys that can throw." Milleville said.
"It's good to see him fill that role —
lie was basically a starter today."
Though Saturday and Sunday's
games were an offensive awakening
of sorts for the Cardinal, the start to

the series on Friday had been just the
opposite. The Lobos shut Stanford
down after the first inning, not allow
ing a run for the final eight innings in
a 7-1 victory.
Junior centerfielder Joey August
started things off strong for Stanford,
hitting a solo shot in the first inning to
give the team a 1-0 lead. It was all
New Mexico after that, though, as the
Lobos scored two runs in the second
inning and scattered five more
throughout the night. The pitching
duo of John Hesketh and Will Kerr
stifled Stanford — Hesketh went
four innings and only gave up a single
earned run. while Kerr closed the
door on the Cardinal with five score
less innings. He only gave up three
hits in the process.
"Timely hitting — they had it. we

didn't." Marquess said."We had h;ises
loaded twice and didn't score; and
every time they h;id a runner in scor
ing position, they got a hit."
Overall, though, it was a positive
weekend for Stanford, as the team
may finally be hitting its stride down
the stretch. After starting off 4-10.
Stanford is 21-11 since March 25 and
a postseason run isn't completely out
of the question. Crazier things have
