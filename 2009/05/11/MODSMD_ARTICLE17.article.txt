# CARDINAL HITS THE SWEET SPOT
## W. Tennis serves nothing but shutouts in Sweet 16s 
### ANTHONY NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
With two 4-0 shutouts over the weekend,
the Stanford women's tennis team will join the
men's team in the NCAA Championship
round of 16 in search of its 16th national title.
Hosting the first and second rounds of
the "Big Dance," the No. 13 Cardinal drew
Wichita State in the opening round. Like
every other first round opponent on the
Farm for the last decade, the Shockers were
quickly turned away.
"We played two really good opponents,"
said head coach Lele Forood. "Wichita was a
really strong team for a first round match
that we've seen in the past.They really got us
up to speed with our play with a competitive
team in the first round."
In the match, the Cardinal quickly se
cured the doubles point at the No. I and 2 po
sitions. With the early lead. Stanford picked
up two easy wins in singles by senior Jessica
Nguyen and sophomore I lilarv Barte.
Sophomore Carolyn McVeigh clinched
the match with a 6-4. 6-1 win over Lenore
Lazaroiu.
On Sunday. Stanford squared off against
No. 25 Louisiana State University in the
Round of 32. Again, the doubles teams set
the tone of the match with two decisive vic
tories. including one by Barte and junior
Lindsay Burdette.
"In both matches, we got up 2-0. lost the
next two games and then won pretty handily
after that," Burdette said. "It just goes to
show that even when we're struggling, we're
close to playing well."
In singles. Burdette demolished her op
ponent 6-1. 6-1 in perhaps her strongest
match of the season at No. 2.
"I haven't played a lot of matches lately,
with only one at Ojai." Burdette said. "The
two dual-matches before that were a little
rough. Today and yesterday. 1 knew I was
getting back on my horse a little bit. Today
was where I want to be."
Nguyen picked up her second win of the
weekend in a 6-1, 6-4 decision for the 3-0
Cardinal lead. The match eventually came
down to freshman Veronica Li and
McVeigh, who had also clinched Saturday's
match.
With a 6-3. 5-2 lead. Li went back and
forth against Nicole Kantor on multiple set
points.
"It was reallv hard at the end because I

was really nervous." Li said. "Carolyn was
catching up to me. and we both had match
point at the same time. I felt like I can't miss
and that I had to win the point because yes
terday Carolyn beat me to it."
With the crowd captivated on every
point. Li eventually won the match as Kan
tor threw down her racket in anger.
"I ended up clinching it.and it felt really
amazing." Li said.
On Court No. 1, Barte also had a defining
match of her own against No. 17 Megan Fal
con. After being broken in her first service
game. Barte battled back for the 6-3.3-4 lead
before play was suspended.
"Megan is a really quality opponent —
she's had a really strong record throughout
college." Forood said."Hilary was doing very
well, and I'd like to think that she would
come through that match as well. Coming off
Ojai when it was a disappointment for her.
she played very strong yesterday and really
got her game back together today."
With the win. Stanford will face No. 4
Baylor on Friday in a rematch of last year's
quarterfinal matchup. While Stanford de
feated them at the Indoor Championships,
the Lady Bears got the last laugh in a 4-1 de
feat of the Cardinal last year.
"We're a different team, they're a slightly
different team and it's going to be a totally
different experience this time around, quite
frankly." Forood said. "We're going to do
what we've been doing, and we'll see what
happens on Friday."
While the team that played last weekend
seemed to be a finely tuned machine, that
wasn't always the case at the beginning of
the season. After much work. Stanford is
now confident in the lineup it will send to
College Station.
"This has been, more than any other, a re
ally growth year for us." Forood said. "We
have a really young group. We've been tin
kering with doubles teams well into the dual
match season. It's been a season of coming
together."
"We've done a good job from where we
were in February to where we are now."
Forood added.
Two convincing wins aside, Stanford
knows it still has quite a battle ahead of it to
end its title drought.
"You can't guarantee anything, especial
ly at this tournament." Burdette said. "But
we're in a great place where we're not used
to being, which is the underdog. We're peak
ing. and a lot of teams are out of school,
doing two-a-days, while we're right in our
regular rhvthm."
