# MLB 'roids in the hands of fans
## 
### 
For MLB in the modern era. the story.it
seems, is never a simple one. and the
street is never one-way.
As word broke on Thursday that Los Ange
les Dodgers Icftficlder Manny Ramirez would
serve a 50-game suspension for testing positive
for banned performance enhancing drugs, the
pall of the steroids scandal that has engulfed
baseball for nearly a decade now grew darker
over the West Coast. Back cast, meanwhile.
New York Yankees third baseman Alex Ro
driguez returned to action the very next night,
after missing the first month of the season with
a hip injury amid new allegations of steroid use
by another of baseball's brightest stars.
Whether or not you think the Dodgers,cur
rently in possession of a 4.5-game lead in the
NL West, will still be OK without their star
slugger, there's no doubt they will miss him.
And by the same token, regardless of w hat you
think A Rod may have done, the Yankees are.
doubtless, glad to have him back in the lineup.
A team can't help but miss its best hitter and a
once-in-a-generation talent.These stories have
more relevance than that, though, because to
gether they are even more nails in the coffin of
the notion that the steroid era was the case of a
few bad eggs stealing the records of past leg
ends.
()n the contrary, it has become increasingly
obvious that there was not an innocent fran
chise in baseball. And while some players,
doubtless.ilid play clean, we the fans will never,
definitively, know who they were. It's unfortu
nate. but it's reality. When everyone from
scrubs to superstars, nice guys to malcontents,
gets caught, it's safe to say we don't know any
thing about it anymore.
But in the infamous words of one famous
steroid user. "I'm not here to talk about the
past." But. unlike Mr. McGwire on Captiol 11 ill
years ago. I think I have a follow-up to that
comment.
ITie question now isn't how the game can
catch the cheaters and right the record books;
its too late for that. And indeed, maybe I'm off
base here, but I'm starting to get the feeling
that the majority of the game's fans are getting
tired of the same old calls for players to come
clean and admit their mistakes every time one
of these stories breaks.
And that 's a good thing, because it's time to

direct that angst in another direction — that of
Bud Selig and the league itself. And. by exten
sion. to ourselves as fans.
If we look at the whole steroids era in an
other way. it shouldn't really he surprising at all
that we find ourselves in this situation. In an en
vironment with millions of dollars at stake and
hardly any testing or repercussions facing play
ers who juiced up. no one should he shocked
that players decided to cheat in any or every
era. Now. no one's saying that 1 lank Aaron or
Babe Ruth or any other great slugger of the
past would have used "roids.but you can be cer
tain that some of their contemporaries would
have. People just don't change that much over
time, especially when there's money at stake
— and lots of it.
So what was the problem? Simply this: new
technologies were introduced and no effort
was made to control them. Baseball turned a
blind eye. and to a large extent, is still turning a
blind eye — using urine testing rather than
more reliable blcxKi testing and not testing in
the offseason, giving players time to ramp up
their usage of a drug before a season to bulk up,
then tone it down before the season starts so as
not to get caught.
The question with baseball is no longer
who's innocent and who's guilty; it's what are
we going to do with it? And I say "we" for a rea
son. As fans, it's incumbent upon us to demand
a level playing field if that's what we really
want to see. Certain players are always going to
do what they can to get an edge, and others will
always try to keep up with them. Owners, team
management and league officials won't step in
to fight the union and right the ship until their
bottom line is affected.
And that's where we come in. Your ulti
mate recourse as a fan. if you don't like what
you see on the field and want to see it change,
is to stop buying so many tickets, foam fingers,
hot dogs and beers. And when you do. be sure
you let your favorite franchise know just why
you're doing it.
.So the demise of Mann\ Ramire/'s reputa
tion while Alex Rodriguez seeks to rebuild his
is nothing new. but what fans choose to do
about it can be. That is. if you really care.

Deni\ (Iriffin isn t calling for a boycott of base
ball — he's just saying it's tunc to put your money
where your mouth is, one way or the other. Con
tact him at edu.
