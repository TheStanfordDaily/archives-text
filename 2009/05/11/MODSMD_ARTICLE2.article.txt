## North Korean defector relays experiences Event highlights human rights political issues in North Korea 
### EMILY FINLEY 
The only North Korean defector to have
both been born in and escaped from a North
Korean gulag came to Stanford this Saturday
to share his story.
The Stanford Korean Students Association
(KSA) brought Dong-Hyuk Shin to campus
this Saturday as part of a panel that focused on
human rights and ongoing tensions in the
Korean peninsula.
Born in a concentration camp thirty miles
outside of Pyongyang, Shin grew up under Kim
Jong-il's socialist regime. He stressed that the
laws of North Korea are not observed inside
the regime's 22 camps, which are spread across
the country.
Shin said prisoners inside the gulags have
no contact with the outside world, and in gen
eral do not question their living conditions.
"People cannot even imagine running
away," Shin said through a KSA translator.
"They think it is a normal and obvious life."
Shin also emphasized there is a limit to the
aid the South Korean government and inde
pendent NGOs can provide to defectors. He
spoke about the economic difficulties that
many defectors face when they arrive in South
Korea, as well as the barrier that still exists
between North Korean and South Korean citi
zens.
While he does not support Kim Jong-il's
government. Shin argued that for the sake of
the North Korean people, he hopes North
Korea does not collapse soon.
Christine Ahn and Christine Hong, both
from the Korea Policy Institute, were members
of the panel and discussed the complexity of
the situation on the Korean peninsula.
Hong emphasized a nuanced view of the
current Korean political situation is necessary,
claiming that demonizing North Korea as evil
is overly simplistic. Both Hong and Ahn also
reminded the audience that a Cold War mind
set still affects relations in the peninsula.
KSA leaders were pleased with the event.
"Everyone was intensely focused on Mr.
Shin." said Chang Kim '09, KSA's campus liai
son director. " The people who came cared
about human rights issues in general. We
reached out to an audience that had the poten
tial to do something with this information."
Sean I lolbert '09 felt he was able to gain
new knowlediie from the event.
"I didn't know a lot about North
Korea." he said. "I definitely catego
rized the regime more as the Axis of
Evil, and this event showed me the
complexity of the situation."
Kim added that the two speakers
from the Korea Policy Institute cer
tainly enhanced the panel, but ques
tioned whether there was an audi
ence for a more complex message.
"The testimony of defectors can
be done in a sound bite," Kim said.
"It's something that people can
relate to and understand. Once
Christine Hong went up there and
started talking, once she started get

ting into the complexities of the sit
uation, a lot of people started leav
ing."
"It made me realize how many
other aspects there are to the situa
tion," Kim added, "such as U.S. mil
itary and political involvement in
the Korean peninsula."
Shin arrived two days before the
event, spending time in San
Francisco with the KSA. Kim said
Shin found his time in the Bay Area
relaxing.
"Mr. Shin has gone through hell,
and he's still doing fine â€”he still
hasn't lost his mind or anything,"
Kim said. "I feel like it makes me
really care about this issue a lot
more."
