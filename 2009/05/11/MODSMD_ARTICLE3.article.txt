## Profs, debate China's role in economic crisis 
### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Cautious optimism was the dominant
tone struck last Friday by the host of U.S.-
China experts gathered at Encina Hall.
The group discussed the economic and
political futures of two countries rapidly
becoming the most important couple on the
international stage in a workshop titled
"China's New Role in a Turbulent World."
"The giobal economic crisis has suddenly
thrust 'The U.S. and China' into the forefront
of thinking in both this country and China."
said .1. Stapleton Roy. a career ambassador
once posted to China under the Clinton
administration. "It's desirable in a way but
also has major dangers built into it. Perhaps
it has too quickly thrust China into a leader
ship role in the global economic sense."
Although the increasingly symbiotic rela
tionship across the Pacific has been noted for
years, in recent months the idea of the
"Group of Two" — the United States and
China as the world's predominant drivers of
policy — has rapidly gained currency relative
to traditional conceptions of agglomerated
economic clout, such as the GB.
The panelists, all China specialists in
either the fields of international finance or
politics, operated within that emerging
framework at the Encina event, a half-day
conference sponsored by the Shorenstein
Asia-Pacific Research Center. They agreed
that China has played a stabilizing role in the
recent economic crisis, and that as a result its
rise in world status has greatly accelerated.
The comments were echoes of the recent
G2O summit in London, when international

leaders stressed that a globally concerted
effort to reverse the downturn would depend
on collaboration between both the financial
ly paralyzed developed countries and the
savings-rich emerging economies, of which
China is the leader.
Hut the panelists warned of pitfalls. The
Chinese belief in open. Western-style capital
ism of past years has now been rattled by the
devastation wrought by excesses that began
in America, and speakers warned that
Beijing could revert to greater state control
of the economy and roll back liberalization.
"The model which they adopted was the
Anglo-Saxon financial market-consumer
business model and now they see it as a false
god." said Carl Walter Ph.D. '81, the CEO of
JPMorgan Chase Bank China. Walter's was
the first Western bank allowed to incorpo
rate within China, in 2(H)7.
Years of work put in by Western investors
in the banking industry to make their
Chinese counterparts more "international."
he said, "has probably been washed away."
Lvric Hughes Hale, the founder of a
China-Elated business news provider, said
that with the wave of fiscal stimulus and rise
of central direction in bank lending, "any
kind of new financial reforms now are off the
table: institutional reforms are off the table."
Stapleton. the former ambassador,
warned that a "leftist backlash" could surface
in the upper echelons of the Chinese
Communist Party after those who "were true
believers that the U.S. had mastered financial
services" had been discredited.
"Are we going to find ourselves drifting
