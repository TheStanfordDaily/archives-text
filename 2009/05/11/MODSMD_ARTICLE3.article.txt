## Profs, debate China's role in economic crisis 
### GERRY SHIH SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Cautious optimism was the dominant
tone struck last Friday by the host of U.S.-
China experts gathered at Encina Hall.
The group discussed the economic and
political futures of two countries rapidly
becoming the most important couple on the
international stage in a workshop titled
"China's New Role in a Turbulent World."
"The giobal economic crisis has suddenly
thrust 'The U.S. and China' into the forefront
of thinking in both this country and China."
said .1. Stapleton Roy. a career ambassador
once posted to China under the Clinton
administration. "It's desirable in a way but
also has major dangers built into it. Perhaps
it has too quickly thrust China into a leader
ship role in the global economic sense."
Although the increasingly symbiotic rela
tionship across the Pacific has been noted for
years, in recent months the idea of the
"Group of Two" — the United States and
China as the world's predominant drivers of
policy — has rapidly gained currency relative
to traditional conceptions of agglomerated
economic clout, such as the GB.
The panelists, all China specialists in
either the fields of international finance or
politics, operated within that emerging
framework at the Encina event, a half-day
conference sponsored by the Shorenstein
Asia-Pacific Research Center. They agreed
that China has played a stabilizing role in the
recent economic crisis, and that as a result its
rise in world status has greatly accelerated.
The comments were echoes of the recent
G2O summit in London, when international

leaders stressed that a globally concerted
effort to reverse the downturn would depend
on collaboration between both the financial
ly paralyzed developed countries and the
savings-rich emerging economies, of which
China is the leader.
Hut the panelists warned of pitfalls. The
Chinese belief in open. Western-style capital
ism of past years has now been rattled by the
devastation wrought by excesses that began
in America, and speakers warned that
Beijing could revert to greater state control
of the economy and roll back liberalization.
"The model which they adopted was the
Anglo-Saxon financial market-consumer
business model and now they see it as a false
god." said Carl Walter Ph.D. '81, the CEO of
JPMorgan Chase Bank China. Walter's was
the first Western bank allowed to incorpo
rate within China, in 2(H)7.
Years of work put in by Western investors
in the banking industry to make their
Chinese counterparts more "international."
he said, "has probably been washed away."
Lvric Hughes Hale, the founder of a
China-Elated business news provider, said
that with the wave of fiscal stimulus and rise
of central direction in bank lending, "any
kind of new financial reforms now are off the
table: institutional reforms are off the table."
Stapleton. the former ambassador,
warned that a "leftist backlash" could surface
in the upper echelons of the Chinese
Communist Party after those who "were true
believers that the U.S. had mastered financial
services" had been discredited.
"Are we going to find ourselves drifting

The Shorenstein APARC held a panel on the 60th anniversay of the founding of the People's
Republic of China that discussed U.S.-China relations in light of the economic crisis.
ideologically apart because of this
global crisis?" he said, suggesting
some uncertainty in the orientation
of Chinas future leaders, while cast
ing a watchful eye toward the CCP's
18th National Congress in 2012..
China's current top leaders are
due to step down then, and the Party
will likely elect leaders from a
younger generation that reached
political maturity after the wane of
the Cultural Revolution — and its
stiff Maoist ideology — in the mid
-19705.
With dramatic monetary expan
sion now underway in the United
States. China is also expected to think
twice about adding dollar-denomi
nated assets to its reserves, according
to the Chicago-based pair. The dol
lar's tenability was deteriorating in
the face of massive U.S. spending as
the cost of the economic bailout
mounts, warned Hughes Hale and
David Hale, a Chicago-based econo
mist with extensive Washington ties.
In what was viewed as a conces
sion of China's dilemma in holding
roughly $1.9 trillion in reserves of
uncertain long-term value, central
banker Zhou Xiaochuan recently
suggested a shift away from the dol
lar as the world's reserve currency.
"What Zhou was saying was
please don't monetize these Obama
budget deficits," Hale said. "If the
dollar were to lose its role as the
world reserve currency, it would have
catastrophic effects on the U.S."
Still, China's GDP in 2010 is
expected to rebound to roughly 7.5
percent, with some analysts' esti
mates as high as 10 percent, the pan
elists said. Despite the falloff in
exports, domestic consumption with
in China appears relatively robust.
"We might look back 10 years
from now and see how this was a sign
of how a developing country could
play a leading role," Hale said.
The tone was largely conciliatory
on political issues. Stapleton urged
against a "military balance" approach
to thinking about U.S. involvement in
the Taiwan Strait. That was only pos
sible "when China was weak." he
said.
Princeton Professor Thomas
Christensen said a move away from
bilateral issues to coordinating activi

ties in third areas would strengthen
relations by "selling" the relationship
to the public in both countries. Such a
policy could increase "room" for
Chinese national pride as well as
assuage fears here that "the rise of
Chinese influence will come at
America's expense." he said.
"But to collaborate, China needs
to soften its strict adherence to a pol
icy of non-intervention." Christensen
said, without making explicit refer
ences. He made only a brief mention
of the humanitarian crisis in Darfur
earlier in his speech as an example of
areas where China and the U.S. could
coordinate actions.
The event was held in honor of
the late Professor Michel Oksenberg.
a key member of the Shorenstein
Center and a highly distinguished fig
ure credited with advocating
improvement in IJ.S.-China relations
to everv U.S. President until his death
in 2001.
