### SARAH OHR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's season canic to a shocking
end last weekend, as the women's lacrosse
team was not awarded an N( AA tourna
ment bid.The ( ardinal knew it was on the
bubble, but after upsetting the third
ranked University of Pennsylvania team
in Stanford's biggest lacrosse upset of ail
time, on top of dominating conference
play, the (Kids were believed to be in its
favor. Rumors were flying on the Stanford
campus, sparked by a spontaneous, cele
bratory rally thrown for the players upon
arriving from Penn last Saturday night, as
well as projections on national lacrosse
Web sites such as Uixpower.com that
placed Stanford in the NCAA field.
Even first-year head coach Amy
Bokker was fairly confident about her
team's postseason future.

"I told the players after the game
[against Penn) —we can't say with MX)
percent certainty that we're in. hut it was a
quality win for us and I hope the commit
tee recognizes that." Bokker said just after
the victory. "I think we have a really gixxl
chance."
It is not surprising, then, that when
Sunday evening's selection announce
ment did not include Stanford as one of
the sixteen teams vying for the national
title, the women were in disbelief.
"Before the [selection] show started,
the nx>ni [at Jimmy V's Sports Cafe] was
full of nervous energy and excitement."
said senior Bess Siegfried. "And then,
when we didn't get in. there was just
silence."
In women's lacrosse. 16 teams are
invited to compete in the NCAA tourna
ment, eight by automatic bid after winning
their conferences outright. After the auto
matic bids are given for conference play,
eight at-large bids are given to teams
selected by committee. The Cardinal
hoped to qualify with one of these at-large
buis. as t he champion of its conference, t he
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, does
not vet receive an automatic bid.

"It is frustrating that other conferences
get automatic bids so teams way below us
will get in ahead of us." lamented junior
defender Eleanor Foote.
However. D'Ann Keller, the NCAA
liaison for women's lacrosse, explained
that the selection committee does its best
to eliminate bias when selecting at-large
bids.
"The selection committee is comprised
of appointed coaches and administrators
from the Division I membership." Keller
said. "It is a rotational regional appoint
ment made by various conference offices
and then approved by the NCAA
Division I Sport Management/
Championships ( abmet — appointments
are based on four-year terms, and many
are the same each year."
ITiis year, the committee included
Vanderbilt's Associate Director of
Student Athletics. Candice Storey Lee.
Vanderbilt w;is also viewed as a bubble
team, but found its way into the tourna
ment with an at-large bid. Keller,
