# Women's Lacrosse Special
## LA-CROSSED OUT OF TOURNEY FIELD Stanford women passed over by NCAA selection committee 
### SARAH OHR CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
Stanford's season canic to a shocking
end last weekend, as the women's lacrosse
team was not awarded an N( AA tourna
ment bid.The ( ardinal knew it was on the
bubble, but after upsetting the third
ranked University of Pennsylvania team
in Stanford's biggest lacrosse upset of ail
time, on top of dominating conference
play, the (Kids were believed to be in its
favor. Rumors were flying on the Stanford
campus, sparked by a spontaneous, cele
bratory rally thrown for the players upon
arriving from Penn last Saturday night, as
well as projections on national lacrosse
Web sites such as Uixpower.com that
placed Stanford in the NCAA field.
Even first-year head coach Amy
Bokker was fairly confident about her
team's postseason future.

"I told the players after the game
[against Penn) —we can't say with MX)
percent certainty that we're in. hut it was a
quality win for us and I hope the commit
tee recognizes that." Bokker said just after
the victory. "I think we have a really gixxl
chance."
It is not surprising, then, that when
Sunday evening's selection announce
ment did not include Stanford as one of
the sixteen teams vying for the national
title, the women were in disbelief.
"Before the [selection] show started,
the nx>ni [at Jimmy V's Sports Cafe] was
full of nervous energy and excitement."
said senior Bess Siegfried. "And then,
when we didn't get in. there was just
silence."
In women's lacrosse. 16 teams are
invited to compete in the NCAA tourna
ment, eight by automatic bid after winning
their conferences outright. After the auto
matic bids are given for conference play,
eight at-large bids are given to teams
selected by committee. The Cardinal
hoped to qualify with one of these at-large
buis. as t he champion of its conference, t he
Mountain Pacific Sports Federation, does
not vet receive an automatic bid.

"It is frustrating that other conferences
get automatic bids so teams way below us
will get in ahead of us." lamented junior
defender Eleanor Foote.
However. D'Ann Keller, the NCAA
liaison for women's lacrosse, explained
that the selection committee does its best
to eliminate bias when selecting at-large
bids.
"The selection committee is comprised
of appointed coaches and administrators
from the Division I membership." Keller
said. "It is a rotational regional appoint
ment made by various conference offices
and then approved by the NCAA
Division I Sport Management/
Championships ( abmet — appointments
are based on four-year terms, and many
are the same each year."
ITiis year, the committee included
Vanderbilt's Associate Director of
Student Athletics. Candice Storey Lee.
Vanderbilt w;is also viewed as a bubble
team, but found its way into the tourna
ment with an at-large bid. Keller,
thounh. defended the committee's

selection, reiterating that the NCAA
does its best to ensure an unbiased selec
tion.
"The committee also works with re
gional advisory committees.[which are],
again, coaches/administrators from the
D 1 membership, to conduct weekly
ranking and discussions of regional
teams." Keller said. "The committee
takes into account a variety of criteria."
No matter the selection criteria, it
seems the Cardinal could not have done
much more. Stanford hard arguably the
best season in school history, tying the
record for victories, surpassing the
record for total goals scored and domi
nating the MPSF conference tourna
ment for the fifth consecutive year.
Additionally, the win against Penn
marked the highest ranked team Stan
ford has beaten in program history. In
the end. though, selection likely came
down to overall strength of schedule. As
a West Coast team. Stanford has fewer
opportunities to play top-ranked teams.
Vanderbilt's proximity to East Coast
powerhouses,on the other hand.afford
ed more opportunities for upsets, and
the Commodores capitalized on those
opportunities — Vanderbilt had four
"big" wins to Stanford's one.
"It's frustrating that we didn't make
it — not just because we all really want
ed to go. but because we really, really de
served to go." Foote said. "We'd just
upset the number three team in the
country, and our only four losses out of
19 games were to teams in the top eight."
"We reallv thought we did what we

needed to do." Bokker added.
Alter a few moments, and tears
around the room. Bokker addressed the
team.
"You obviously have a lot to he
proud or she said. "You seniors have
made a mark on what we've heen able
to do as a program. I don't know w hat
else to say."
"We certainly feel like there is a bias
against West Coast teams in the lacrosse
world and no one seems to take us that
seriously," Foote said. "Unfortunately
our win over Penn has been seen by
some people as a minor falter on their
part instead of a recognition that we are
actually a top team that legitimately out
played them for the whole 6() minutes."
Still, the players are not letting this
disappointing decision overshadow
how proud they are of their season as a
whole. The 8-6 decision against Penn
capped off an incredible run for the ( or
dinal.
"We believed we could win from the
start and wanted to leave everything on
the field. We played our hardest for 60
minutes and never gave up. It was a great
team effort,"said sophomore goalkeep
er Annie Read.
Individually. Stanford players were
also hugely successful. Senior midfielder
Jamie Nesbitt had four draw controls in
the victory over Penn, and helped hold
the Quakers to their lowest goal total of
the season. As a result of her outstand
ing performances during the Cardinal's
last two games against Penn and
Louisville. Nesbitt was named MPSF

women's lacrosse Player of the Week,
the first such honor for Nesbitt, who
played in every game (73) during her
four-year Stanford career.
Read and MPSF Player of the Year
Lauren Schmidt also contributed to
what could be the biggest win of their
Stanford. Schmidt capped off an impres
sive season by scoring three goals and
adding one assist, while Read made
eleven saves.
With the season now complete, the
returning players intend to take the mo
mentum from the big win along with
their NCAA vendetta into next season.
The Cardinal returns the majority of its
starting line-up next year, and Bokker
will no longer be new to the Farm.
"Though we are disappointed with
the decision of the NCAA committee,
there are obviously a lot of things we can

he proud oC Read said. "We made
many great strides and accomplish
ments over the season which have creat
ed a great foundation for the future of
our program."

much more. Stanford hard arguably the
best season in school history, tying the
record for victories, surpassing the
record for total goals scored and domi
nating the MPSF conference tourna
ment for the fifth consecutive year.
Additionally, the win against Penn
marked the highest ranked team Stan
ford has beaten in program history. In
the end. though, selection likely came
down to overall strength of schedule. As
a West Coast team. Stanford has fewer
opportunities to play top-ranked teams.
Vanderbilt's proximity to East Coast
powerhouses,on the other hand.afford
ed more opportunities for upsets, and
the Commodores capitalized on those
opportunities — Vanderbilt had four
"big" wins to Stanford's one.
"It's frustrating that we didn't make
it — not just because we all really want
ed to go. but because we really, really de
served to go." Foote said. "We'd just
upset the number three team in the
country, and our only four losses out of
19 games were to teams in the top eight."
"We reallv thought we did what we

needed to do." Bokker added.
Alter a few moments, and tears
around the room. Bokker addressed the
team.
"You obviously have a lot to he
proud or she said. "You seniors have
made a mark on what we've heen able
to do as a program. I don't know w hat
else to say."
"We certainly feel like there is a bias
against West Coast teams in the lacrosse
world and no one seems to take us that
seriously," Foote said. "Unfortunately
our win over Penn has been seen by
some people as a minor falter on their
part instead of a recognition that we are
actually a top team that legitimately out
played them for the whole 6() minutes."
Still, the players are not letting this
disappointing decision overshadow
how proud they are of their season as a
whole. The 8-6 decision against Penn
capped off an incredible run for the ( or
dinal.
"We believed we could win from the
start and wanted to leave everything on
the field. We played our hardest for 60
minutes and never gave up. It was a great
team effort,"said sophomore goalkeep
er Annie Read.
Individually. Stanford players were
also hugely successful. Senior midfielder
Jamie Nesbitt had four draw controls in
the victory over Penn, and helped hold
the Quakers to their lowest goal total of
the season. As a result of her outstand
ing performances during the Cardinal's
last two games against Penn and
Louisville. Nesbitt was named MPSF

women's lacrosse Player of the Week,
the first such honor for Nesbitt, who
played in every game (73) during her
four-year Stanford career.
Read and MPSF Player of the Year
Lauren Schmidt also contributed to
what could be the biggest win of their
Stanford. Schmidt capped off an impres
sive season by scoring three goals and
adding one assist, while Read made
eleven saves.
With the season now complete, the
returning players intend to take the mo
mentum from the big win along with
their NCAA vendetta into next season.
The Cardinal returns the majority of its
starting line-up next year, and Bokker
will no longer be new to the Farm.
"Though we are disappointed with
the decision of the NCAA committee,
there are obviously a lot of things we can

he proud oC Read said. "We made
many great strides and accomplish
ments over the season which have creat
ed a great foundation for the future of
our program."
