## The 						Power of Powwow Native-American cultural festival draws 30,000 to the Farm 
### EMILY RIALS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
On April 21. 1971. a small
ad was placed in The
Stanford Daily, announc
ing a "May Day Pow
Wow" to be held in Frost
Amphitheater.
"The Native American students of
the Stanford American Indian
Organization are sponsoring the
event."the ad read. "Its purpose is to
stress American Indian culture to the
local community, both Indian and
Non-Indian."
Thirty-eight years later, the
Stanford Powwow has swelled to an
event that fills Eucalyptus Grove to
capacity and draws more than 30,000
people to Stanford's campus over the
course of three days.
Denni Woodward, associate direc
tor at the Native American Cultural
Center, has been affiliated with the
Stanford Powwow since 1990 and said
that Powwow is truly a community
event.
"A Powwow is something that
started out in the plains, with the
plains tribes, and it's really a coming
together — in this case a celebration
of native dance and music and cul
tures and art." Woodward explained.
Political Correctness: A Cardinal Rule
While Stanford's Powwow is now
an established tradition. Woodward
said that the celebration "came on the
heels of civil rights." In 1970. the newly
founded Stanford American Indian
Organization (SAIO) circulated a
petition for the removal of Stanford's
Indian mascot, arguing that the single
image perpetuated by the mascot was
"inaccurate and disrespectful."
In response to the University's
decision to ditch the Indian in favor of
the more politically correct Cardinal.

students decided to bring "more of a
native presence to campus" by hosting
a Powwow that spring.
"It started very small, as you might
imagine, and now. in its 38th year... I
can't even tell you how much bigger it
is," Woodward said. The Powwow is
now Stanford's largest on-campus
multicultural event.
A Trans-National (vent
"[The Powwow] is an event that
gives you a chance to showcase a cul
ture that a lot of people think isn't in
existence anymore." said Joe
Cartwright *09. one of this year's
Powwow co-chairs.
"Many of the Indian participants
will arrive from as far as Montana.
Oklahoma and New Mexico,"
explained that first Daily ad in 1971.
This year was no different, with com
petitive drum groups and dancers
hailing anywhere from Nevada to
Ontario. Canada.
"We try to bring in California
Indian tribes, just because this is their
land." Cartwright explained. "A lot of
the tribes and our head staff will be
Cherokee, or Navajo, or Cree or
Kiowa." with representation of
Northwest and Canadian tribes as
well. The head dancers "act as model
citizens and model dancers. They'll go
out and perform their dance of choice,
and then it'll lead off the competitive
dancing."
"There's a tremendous family
quality [to the Stanford Powwow]."
Woodward said. "Every year the head
dancers and drums that the students
invite reflect where our own students
come from. So the personality of it
changes every year, and the tribal mix
changes every year."
Held during Mothers' Day week
end every year. Stanford's Powwow is
one of the first of the summer pow
wow season. The Powwow is not only

a large event relative to Stanford's
standards: the Stanford Powwow is
also the largest student-run powwow
in the country.
"We figure that most undergrads
attend the Powwow at least once
while they're here [at Stanford],"
Woodward said.
The attendees of the Powwow are
often not just one-time visitors,
though.
"People really kind of fall in love
with it when they come for the first
time." C'artwright said. He's heard tell
of a couple who fly to California from
Germany every year for the purpose
of attending the Powwow.
Ruben Eagle Feather is an Apache
man from Menlo Park and has attend
ed the Stanford Powwow for the last
10 years.
" This is right up there with the big
powwows." he said. "It's one of the
easiest powwows to go to — people
are watching your back, you don't
have to worn about anything happen
ing to you ... everyone's so nice
here."
Powwows organized by individual
tribes are often planned by profes
sional event planners, according to
Woodward.
"Our Powwow is so large, it chal
lenges some of those professionally
run powwows." he said.
An Expanding Tradition
Ihis year, around 250 dancers were
expected to register for the weekend's
competitions, which included divisions
for all ages in a wide variety of dance
traditions. This weekend's Powwow
also welcomed a Raven Dancer, Gene
Tagaban from Washington, as a spe
cial third head dancer.
"[Raven Dancing] isn't something
that's traditionally performed at the
Stanford Powwow." C'artwright said,
"and a lot of us. including* myself, have

never seen it done."
As the event has grown, so have
the opportunities it presents to visi
tors. The fifth annual Powwow, fea
tured in Ihe Daily on May 17. 1976.
had relocated to "a powwow ground
constructed on the intramural fields"
and featured the sale of Native
American food, crafts and clothing in
booths around the central dance
arena. In more recent years, a Fun
Run/Walk has been added to the
agenda, and the schedule for this
weekend included the Second
Annual Maurice Morsette 3-on-3
Basketball Tournament. In addition,
about 112 booths circled the dance
arena at this year's Powwow, offering
everything from information to cloth
ing. pottery and jewelry to Indian
Tacos and fry bread.
Despite an expansion in activities
offered, from the organizers' perspec
tive, the Powwow is still focused pri
marily on education.
"It's all about education and bring
ing these cultures to campus,"
Woodward said.
"I think people really like it
because it is put on just by students,
and it's a huge event." C'artwright
added.
"Mv favorite part is, of course, the
dancing and the drumming." said
Alani Many Star, of the Blackfeet
tribe. 'This weekend marked her first
visit to the Stanford Powwow, though
she explained that she has previously
attended powwows across the United
States and Canada.
The vendors have also become a
main attraction. Many student visitors
to the Powwow divide their time
between watching the dancers in the

arena and frequenting the booths in
the grove beyond. A middle-aged
man named Mark explained, i play
Native American flute, so I like to see
the makers here." This was Mark's
fifth or sixth visit to the Stanford
Powwow, he estimated.

The Power of Powwow
For many, the
attraction of the
Stanford Powwow
seems to involve more
than specific dancers or

vendors. The event is an
end in itself—the power
of the overall experience
is what keeps them com
ing back. For Teddy
Butler, the power of the
Powwow is a restorative
one.

Butler, a man of
Pottawatomi. Sauk and

Fox descent, explained

that he has been com-

ing to the Stanford
Powwow since
around 1990. k

"I have mem
ories here." he
said, from danc
ing to being
introduced to a
later girlfriend.

Butler is a traditional drum
dancer.
"[Now.] I don't compete," he said.
"I just carry on."
When asked what brings him back
to the Powwow. Butler sighed.
"I'm a recovering alcoholic and


AGUSTIN RAMIREZ/The Stanford Daiily
addict," he said. "This is one of the
things that saved my life — this
Powwow, the carrying on. I go to pow
wows wherever I can."
The purpose of this weekend,
then, is ultimately about something
deeper than watching individual
dancers or shopping at individual
booths.The Powwow has a restorative
power, a power to widen the horizons
of those attending their 2()th such
event as well as those attending their
first. The Powwow is an event that
both affirms native cultures and
shares them, celebrates their past and
acknowledges the possibilities of their
future.
"[The Powwow] is a chance for
people of all sorts of tribes, and all
other ethnicities and cultures, to come
and see all sorts of native cultures put
on in one venue," Cartwright said.
"Once those people get here and see
that it's not just Stanford benefiting,
but that the whole country can bene
fit ... I think that's the power of it."

Stanford Powwow." C'artwright said,
"and a lot of us. including* myself, have

never seen it done."
As the event has grown, so have
the opportunities it presents to visi
tors. The fifth annual Powwow, fea
tured in Ihe Daily on May 17. 1976.
had relocated to "a powwow ground
constructed on the intramural fields"
and featured the sale of Native
American food, crafts and clothing in
booths around the central dance
arena. In more recent years, a Fun
Run/Walk has been added to the
agenda, and the schedule for this
weekend included the Second
Annual Maurice Morsette 3-on-3
Basketball Tournament. In addition,
about 112 booths circled the dance
arena at this year's Powwow, offering
everything from information to cloth
ing. pottery and jewelry to Indian
Tacos and fry bread.
Despite an expansion in activities
offered, from the organizers' perspec
tive, the Powwow is still focused pri
marily on education.
"It's all about education and bring
ing these cultures to campus,"
Woodward said.
"I think people really like it
because it is put on just by students,
and it's a huge event." C'artwright
added.
"Mv favorite part is, of course, the
dancing and the drumming." said
Alani Many Star, of the Blackfeet
tribe. 'This weekend marked her first
visit to the Stanford Powwow, though
she explained that she has previously
attended powwows across the United
States and Canada.
The vendors have also become a
main attraction. Many student visitors
to the Powwow divide their time
between watching the dancers in the

arena and frequenting the booths in
the grove beyond. A middle-aged
man named Mark explained, i play
Native American flute, so I like to see
the makers here." This was Mark's
fifth or sixth visit to the Stanford
Powwow, he estimated.

The Power of Powwow
For many, the
attraction of the
Stanford Powwow
seems to involve more
than specific dancers or

vendors. The event is an
end in itself—the power
of the overall experience
is what keeps them com
ing back. For Teddy
Butler, the power of the
Powwow is a restorative
one.

Butler, a man of
Pottawatomi. Sauk and

Fox descent, explained

that he has been com-

ing to the Stanford
Powwow since
around 1990. k

"I have mem
ories here." he
said, from danc
ing to being
introduced to a
later girlfriend.

Butler is a traditional drum
dancer.
"[Now.] I don't compete," he said.
"I just carry on."
When asked what brings him back
to the Powwow. Butler sighed.
"I'm a recovering alcoholic and


AGUSTIN RAMIREZ/The Stanford Daiily
addict," he said. "This is one of the
things that saved my life — this
Powwow, the carrying on. I go to pow
wows wherever I can."
The purpose of this weekend,
then, is ultimately about something
deeper than watching individual
dancers or shopping at individual
booths.The Powwow has a restorative
power, a power to widen the horizons
of those attending their 2()th such
event as well as those attending their
first. The Powwow is an event that
both affirms native cultures and
shares them, celebrates their past and
acknowledges the possibilities of their
future.
"[The Powwow] is a chance for
people of all sorts of tribes, and all
other ethnicities and cultures, to come
and see all sorts of native cultures put
on in one venue," Cartwright said.
"Once those people get here and see
that it's not just Stanford benefiting,
but that the whole country can bene
fit ... I think that's the power of it."

On April 21. 1971. a small
ad was placed in The
Stanford Daily, announc
ing a "May Day Pow
Wow" to be held in Frost
Amphitheater.
"The Native American students of
the Stanford American Indian
Organization are sponsoring the
event."the ad read. "Its purpose is to
stress American Indian culture to the
local community, both Indian and
Non-Indian."
Thirty-eight years later, the
Stanford Powwow has swelled to an
event that fills Eucalyptus Grove to
capacity and draws more than 30,000
people to Stanford's campus over the
course of three days.
Denni Woodward, associate direc
tor at the Native American Cultural
Center, has been affiliated with the
Stanford Powwow since 1990 and said
that Powwow is truly a community
event.
"A Powwow is something that
started out in the plains, with the
plains tribes, and it's really a coming
together — in this case a celebration
of native dance and music and cul
tures and art." Woodward explained.
Political Correctness: A Cardinal Rule
While Stanford's Powwow is now
an established tradition. Woodward
said that the celebration "came on the
heels of civil rights." In 1970. the newly
founded Stanford American Indian
Organization (SAIO) circulated a
petition for the removal of Stanford's
Indian mascot, arguing that the single
image perpetuated by the mascot was
"inaccurate and disrespectful."
In response to the University's
decision to ditch the Indian in favor of
the more politically correct Cardinal.

students decided to bring "more of a
native presence to campus" by hosting
a Powwow that spring.
"It started very small, as you might
imagine, and now. in its 38th year... I
can't even tell you how much bigger it
is," Woodward said. The Powwow is
now Stanford's largest on-campus
multicultural event.
A Trans-National (vent
"[The Powwow] is an event that
gives you a chance to showcase a cul
ture that a lot of people think isn't in
existence anymore." said Joe
Cartwright *09. one of this year's
Powwow co-chairs.
"Many of the Indian participants
will arrive from as far as Montana.
Oklahoma and New Mexico,"
explained that first Daily ad in 1971.
This year was no different, with com
petitive drum groups and dancers
hailing anywhere from Nevada to
Ontario. Canada.
"We try to bring in California
Indian tribes, just because this is their
land." Cartwright explained. "A lot of
the tribes and our head staff will be
Cherokee, or Navajo, or Cree or
Kiowa." with representation of
Northwest and Canadian tribes as
well. The head dancers "act as model
citizens and model dancers. They'll go
out and perform their dance of choice,
and then it'll lead off the competitive
dancing."
"There's a tremendous family
quality [to the Stanford Powwow]."
Woodward said. "Every year the head
dancers and drums that the students
invite reflect where our own students
come from. So the personality of it
changes every year, and the tribal mix
changes every year."
Held during Mothers' Day week
end every year. Stanford's Powwow is
one of the first of the summer pow
wow season. The Powwow is not only

a large event relative to Stanford's
standards: the Stanford Powwow is
also the largest student-run powwow
in the country.
"We figure that most undergrads
attend the Powwow at least once
while they're here [at Stanford],"
Woodward said.
The attendees of the Powwow are
often not just one-time visitors,
though.
"People really kind of fall in love
with it when they come for the first
time." C'artwright said. He's heard tell
of a couple who fly to California from
Germany every year for the purpose
of attending the Powwow.
Ruben Eagle Feather is an Apache
man from Menlo Park and has attend
ed the Stanford Powwow for the last
10 years.
" This is right up there with the big
powwows." he said. "It's one of the
easiest powwows to go to — people
are watching your back, you don't
have to worn about anything happen
ing to you ... everyone's so nice
here."
Powwows organized by individual
tribes are often planned by profes
sional event planners, according to
Woodward.
"Our Powwow is so large, it chal
lenges some of those professionally
run powwows." he said.
An Expanding Tradition
Ihis year, around 250 dancers were
expected to register for the weekend's
competitions, which included divisions
for all ages in a wide variety of dance
traditions. This weekend's Powwow
also welcomed a Raven Dancer, Gene
Tagaban from Washington, as a spe
cial third head dancer.
"[Raven Dancing] isn't something
that's traditionally performed at the
Stanford Powwow." C'artwright said,
"and a lot of us. including* myself, have

never seen it done."
As the event has grown, so have
