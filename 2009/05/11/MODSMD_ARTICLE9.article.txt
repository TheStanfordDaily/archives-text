## EDITORIAL GSB cafe dispute partly result of miscommunication 
### 
An ongoing controversy at the Gradu
ate School of Business' (GSB) Ar
buckle Cafe has pitted cafe workers
against managers from the Bon Appetit
Management Company, which runs the es
tablishment. The workers have complained
of harassment and retaliation for participat
ing in protected union activities, while the
management has emphasized the situation is
primarily the product of a few misunder
standings and reduced worker hours due to
the economic downturn.
While the situation is murky and both
sides likely have valid grievances, what's
clear is that communication between parties
has been lacking. Stanford's hard-working
support staff is unequivocally deserving of
respectful treatment. The management's ef
forts to continue providing quality service to
the University community despite difficult
economic times should also be recognized
and appreciated. Also commendable are the
students — notably those members of the
student group Stanford Labor Action Coali
tion (SLAC) — who have attempted to as
sist workers in airing their grievances.
What's most important to remember in situ
ations like this, however, is that communica
tion is key. We would like to encourage the
workers, management and students involved
to sit down and discuss at length the griev
ances in question so that all may better un
derstand the underlying issues involved.
Some workers have claimed that they
have been falsely accused of stealing food,
been dressed down in front of customers and
temporarily laid off for two weeks in retalia
tion for circulating a petition demanding a
more respectful work environment. The
management, on the other hand, contends
that the temporary layoffs were not directed
at particular employees, but instead were
furloughs that are typically utilized during
the spring break period, which is slow for
business. They also state that the petition in
question — the circulation of which is indis
putably a protected union activity — was

passed around during work hours, which is
prohibited on the basis that it may con
tribute to a "hostile work environment."
These allegations and disagreements
have led to the involvement of SLAC. which
has admirably attempted to protect workers'
rights in light of these alleged violations.This
culminated in several emails and a rally at
the GSB on April 21.
About the only clear-cut aspect of this
whole dispute is the lack of effective com
munication. Until last week, the Arbuckle
Cafe did not even have an official shop stew
ard. the union-appointed worker who would
be responsible for arbitrating this type of
dispute and who would likely have been able
to resolve any differences before the issue
became publicized campus-wide. And while
we would not want to put the onus entirely
on the workers to enhance communication,
language barriers, without question, con
tribute to misunderstandings over these
matters. Programs such as "Habla" and
groups like SLAC are extremely valuable in
helping workers navigate workplace diffi
culties. whether due to language or other
barriers, and incidents like these remind us
of their usefulness.
We do not want to point fingers at anyone
in this instance without a more thorough un
derstanding of the facts. Stanford's workers
deserve respect and dignity both as friends
and integral members of the Stanford com
munity. If worker harassment is becoming a
serious problem, it must stop immediately.
Yet. at the same time, there is often a tenden
cy to jump to conclusions on many campus
issues without interfacing clearly with the
administration and other authorities. Ilius,
we should also strive to understand the situ
ation from the point of view of the manage
ment. which is as affected by economic diffi
culties as other University programs. Ulti
mately, both workers and management
should sit down and have a clear airing of
grievances so that every faction feels its con
cerns are heard and can be addressed.
