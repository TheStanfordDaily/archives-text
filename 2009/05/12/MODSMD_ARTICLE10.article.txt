## Hydrogen and water: A view from the octorhombus 
### 
Seriously, walk over to the new School of
Engineering building (between Y2E2
and the Main Quad) and ga/e for a
minute. If you have a better word than "Oc
torhombus" for the stop sign-shaped mol
luscoid foot that's protruding into the mid
dle of the new engineering quad, let me
know.(And for the record: I'm pro-that
structure.)
Soon I will be sacrificing a good portion
of my soul to the Octorhombus. the mighty
new symbol of Stanford I Engineering, in the
sis form. Partially in the Octorhombus'
newly-faced honor, partially because all my
Pieces of Thesis are the only thing I can
think about right now and partially because
I'm pretty sure very few people will ever
read it. I'm going to cop out a little and write
about my thesis today.
In summary: please, please don't want a
hydrogen economy.
Yes. hydrogen is kind of cool. You can
burn it or you can run it through a fuel cell,
and all you'll get out is water. Word, right?
I mean, yeah, kind of. But if your goal is
to move away from fossil fuels entirely, and
if you're in California, there are a few things
you need to notice.
As 112. hydrogen is an energy carrier, not
an energy source. Phis means that we have
to make it out of something else, which
takes energy. The dream is that hydrogen
could help wean us off of fossil fuels, be
cause if you run renewable electricity
through water, you get hydrogen, and when
you use the hydrogen to make electricity,
you get water back. No carbon emissions. So
far. so . .. sort of good.
The major problems that I see with mov
ing to a hydrogen economy are that you end
up wasting a lot of electricity in conversions
and that, at least in California, the amount
of water required for electrolysis is not in

significant.
Since you're running electricity through
water to make the hydrogen, so that you can
put hydrogen in a fuel cell to make electric
ity. an obvious question is why you aren't
using the electricity directly. In the case of
renewable electricity, one answer is that fuel
cell output is controllable and dispatchable,
while many renewables are intermittent.
That's true, but you pay a major conversion
cost for the dispatchability of hydrogen.
I .osses associated with electrolysis, with fuel
cell operation, with fuel cell cooling needs,
with compressing or liquefying and then
transporting hydrogen are all very real, but
if wind only blows at night in the wintertime,
these losses may be justifiable. Oh. and by
the way. fuel cell systems often need battery
backup, so "we don't have good batteries"
doesn't really favor hydrogen.
The second major problem is that to elec
troly/e water,you need ... well, water. And
extremely high-quality water at that.
Though many people are working on ways
to cheaply electrolyze poor-quality waters
like brines or alkaline industrial waste
waters. for now, you basically need at least
potable water — and preferably deionized
water — that is carefully mixed with elec
trolytes to improve its conductivity.
Perhaps a lot of jargon, hut here's my
bottom line:
To power all of California's energy needs
that's transport, electricity and heating
via renewable electrolysis-based hydro
gen would require that about 180.(X)0 mil
lion gallons of high-quality water be reliably
available. That accounts for about two per
cent of the water we use annually, but here's
an analogy that might help show how much
that is in California:
Imagine you're really busy this week.
You have numerous deadlines that, if not

met. will spark the wrath of at least three
people who are really important to you (if
they happen to be agricultural, urban/indus
trial and environmental interests, this analo
gy is even better than I thought).
You've been running on a time deficit for
weeks — you've been, on average, borrow
ing 10 hours a week from the future, and you
haven't even thought about how you'll bor
row less in the future, let alone how you'll
pay it back. And now I'm demanding that
you give me three hours of your highest
quality time. During these three hours. I'll
require that you focus in a way that you have
never focused before. And once you sign up
for them, you're committed to providing me
with them every week for a very, very long
time. In case of emergency, these are three
hours you may not skimp on. Unfortunately
for you. you can't really skimp on any of the
other hours you're using either.
Those three hours represent two percent
of the week, or the very pure water electrol
ysis needs.
Your desperate situation represents Cal
ifornia's water supply, with the borrowed
time being annual overdrafting of nonre
newable water.
Remember, the water that would be
freed from not having to cool power plants
is almost universally saline. To supply my
water from desalinated seawater? Tack on
another 17 percent of California's annual
energy demand.
Now motivate me to design a future
based on hydrogen. not electricity.

Emily is going to see Honda 's fuel cell cur on
Thursday, and she'\ really excited about it. She
hopes that Testa — that rad electric car compa
ny — heats up all the fuel cell cars with its eves,
though. Invite lier for a ride in your Tcsla cm
