After roughly 5 p.m. on any day of the
week, the main campus gets eerily
quiet, not unlike all of USC"s libraries
year-round. I have long wondered where the
hell we all go. I lowever. our collective center
of worship never suffers from an absence of
bodies. Not Memorial Church, but rather the
Arrillaga Center for Sports and Recreation.
It has been remarked that we Stanfordians
don't go to church; we go to the gym. Dwarfed
only bv Johnny A's behemoth, nay, palatial.

Recreation sprawls expansively on Galvez.

nal faithful.
Monday 12:30 a.m., Friday pre-dinner: Ar
rillaga is always packed.The fact that 45 min
utes before closing on Wednesday mornings
all of the treadmills are taken is borderline
absurdity, at least in my book. You want polit
ical,cultural, religious and socio-economic di
versity? Then wait in line for an elliptical ma
chine or take a cursory glance ai the hordes
that frequent the plush confines of Arrillaga
on a given basis. Bimbos, blowhards and
brainiacs alike can be found pumping iron,
spinning on those surprisingly entertaining
yellow I.cMond cycles or just chatting in be
tween reps.
We Stanford students are a rather active
lot, and given that our ranks are swollen with
world-class athletes and vast amounts of for
mer high school varsity athletes, physical
well-being is unsurprisingly a high priority in
the lives of a great many.Though only a small
part of the total fitness equation, the gym cul
ture is something we seem to take rather seri
ously. Just last week 1 was privy to a rather in
tense discussion regarding proper gym eti
quette surrounding reading and the "correct"
expenditure of energy on treadmills. And in
the name of full disclosure, I attempt to fre
quent Arrillaga at least twice a week, lest I
feel like total shit.

this student body and the greater campus cul
ture well, but even when our out of shape
hipsters are gym rats, it makes me think that
something is just a hit off. Is it merely a collec
tion of individualistic motives that drive us
all. almost mechanically, to visit the basement
of Arrillaga for two to four hours each week,
or are there some greater forces at play with
this gym obsession?
One of the more profound realizations I
have come upon in my short time here at the
Stan is this institution's incredible ability to
develop and shamelessly cultivate a particu
lar image that it so brilliantly markets out to
the greater world. We have all been inundat
ed.and in particular ways (Admit Weekend!),
encouraged to support and reinforce particu
lar conceptions of the University, be it con
sciously or otherwise. Yet I am of the belief
that this obsession with image is not a hall
mark of simply the institution.
As a student body, we take pride in our
ridiculous and oft-unconventional antics, wit
nessed by the"VS() as drinking club"culture,
tlu- Band, lull Moon on the Ouad and I \otic

fcrotic (ihis l-riday —gel stoked!). However,
even our "/any" Stanford quirks (even
I .SJIJMB to an extent, sadly) are carried out
under heavy OSA scrutiny with the spon
taneity of bygone eras replaced by a feeling of
sanitized artificiality. And somehow we are
more than OK with such contrived absurdity.
I do not mean this as a direct criticism.but
more so than most college students, we at the
Stan are hypersensitive of the potential rami
fications of our actions. No one wants to lose
a job over a particularly obscene Facebook
picture or throw a party without navigating
the particular bureaucratic channels. A great
many of us. methinks. have been trained since
a young age to be cognizant of how we por
tray ourselves to the outside world, that par
ticular modes of appearance and style are
more conducive to particular social norms.
Which brings us back to the Center for
Sports and Rec. arguably John's best struc
ture on campus, and which happens to be one
of my favorite perks about being here at Stan
ford (a rock-climbing wall, realh Some may
claim decadence; I just see awesome). I can
not help but think that our obsession with
working out is in some way intimately con
nected to an acutely refined self-conscious
ness that is both a byproduct of our time at
Stanford as well as a trait many of us carry
into the beginning of freshman year.
We should not be ashamed of our healthy
habits, for it means that we will live far longer
lives than the vast preponderance of folks in
the Rust Belt, but we should also not blindly
conform to the accepted norms of the campus
without turning a skeptical, often sweat-cov
ered eye to the compulsions that fuel this
frenzied culture.
