## Card loses to UCLA in final seconds of semifinal, takes third place in championships 
### MICHAEL LAZARUS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
As the preseason No. 2 seed and the No. 1 seed
for most of the regular season, a third-place finish
at the National Collegiate Women's Water Polo
Championship was a disappointing end to the year
for Stanford.
In College Park. Maryland this past weekend,
the Cardinal lost to No. 6 UCLA in the semifinals,
sending Stanford to the third-place game, where it
defeated No. 4 Hawaii. 14-11.
Before squaring off against UCLA on Saturday.
Stanford dismantled Marist 21-5 on Friday. Even
after the convincing victory over Marist. the Cardi
nal knew it would have its hands full with UCLA.
Stanford found out just how hard its time would
be after UCLA took a 3-1 lead in the first period.
The Cardinal could not inch any further in the sec
ond period, entering halftime 5-3.
"We had a poor start against UCLA, falling be
hind because we rushed things on offense," said
Stanford head coach John Tanner. "They scored on
too many after-goal plays, answering our scores
with ones of their own, which kept us from taking
command."
In the third period. Stanford made its move.
Down by two with three minutes,3o seconds left in
the period, the Cardinal scored three consecutive
goals under just two minutes to grab its first lead of
the game. 7-6. Sophomore Kim Kreuger ignited the
Stanford scoring streak on an outside shot and

freshman Pallavi Menon scored the tying goal on
the ensuing possession. After the second straight
UCLA turnover, junior Jessica Steffens put the
Cardinal on top.converting on a 6-on-5 power play.
The lead did not last for long, however, as the
Bruins scored the final two goals of the period to
enter the fourth with an 8-7 lead.
The fourth period would take Stanford on an
emotional roller coaster.
After tying the game at 8-8. junior Kelly Eaton
scored with just over six minutes to play to give the
Cardinal the late lead. A minute later, senior Kira
Hillman stretched the lead to two with a goal of her
own.
UCLA reclaimed the lead, however, on a three
goal streak starting just 15 seconds after Hillman's
goal.
With less than a minute until Stanford's champi
onship dreams would come to a heartbreaking end.
the Cardinal had one final chance to tie the game.
As the shot clock ran down. Stanford tried to get off
a desperation shot. While the Cardinal was prepar
ing to take its potential final shot of the season, it
heard an unexpected, hut welcomed sound: the
UCLA bench blowing its air-horn to call a timeout.
In water polo, the penalty for the defensive team
signaling for a timeout is a five-meter penalty shot.
As it has all season. Stanford turned to its leader.
Lauren Silver.The senior, as she has all season, de
livered.and tied the game at 10-10 for a potential
overtime.
The Cardinal would not get the opportunity.

though, as UCLA scored the game-winning goal
with five seconds remaining.The Bruins went on
to defeat USC 5-4 to claim the national champi
onship.
"We came back and played [the] best we had all
season in those the last three quarters, which made
the loss that much worse." Silver said.
The loss sent Stanford to the third-place game
against I lawaii on Sunday.
While surely disappointed about missing out on
the national championship game, the Cardinal
made the best out of its situation. Stanford never
trailed in the game en route to the 14-11 victory.
"As difficult as it was playing in the third-place
game, our team got one more chance to play to
gether. and our seniors finished their stellar four
years here with a win."Tanner said.
Silver echoed her coach's sentiments.
"We've been practicing all season to win on that
Sunday — it was just the wrong game." the senior
said. "We finished the season right, at least."
Playing in her final collegiate game. Silver had
arguably her best game, scoring eight goals.
"I was a little upset not being in the finals, so I
wanted to go out swinging and I did that." Silver
said. "I would give up all my goals in the world in
order to play for the championship, though."
Stanford finishes the season with a 26-4 overall
record, a second-place MPSI trophy and a No. 3
national ranking.
