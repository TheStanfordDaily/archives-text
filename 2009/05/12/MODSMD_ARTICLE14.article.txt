Milleville wins weekly honors

Stanford senior first baseman Brent
Milieville was named last week's Pacif
ic- 10 Conference Player of the Week, as
well as one of four National Players of
the Week by the Collegiate Baseball
Newspaper and Louisville Slugger.
Milieville destroyed opponents'
pitching in his five games last week, hit
ting a torrid .474 and scoring six runs.
His largest impact, though, was in his
display of power, as he hit four home
runs, including two grand slams, and
drove in 16 runs. In particular,
Milieville excelled in the final two
games of the Cardinal's series with
New Mexico, driving in a career-high
seven runs on Saturday and hitting one
of his grand slams on Sunday.
The recent success is not an anomaly
for the Cardinal first baseman, though,
as he has hit .381 with 14 home runs and
47 RBI in his last 31 games, raising his
average for the season to .331. His
power surge has pushed him up to third
in the Pac-10 in RBI and fourth in
home runs. Most importantly, though.
Milleville's increased offensive pro

duction has coincided with Stanford's
increased success, as the Cardinal has
gone 20-11 over those last 31 games.
The Pac-10 award was Milleville's
first, and the CBN/LS award was
shared with San Diego State pitcher
Stephen Strasburg, Missouri outfielder
Greg Folgia and San Jose State short
stop Kyle Bellows.

Women's rowers sweep Cal

The Stanford women's open-weight
rowers, fresh off an impressive sweep
of California at this year's Big Row,
head to the Pacific-10 Conference
Championships on May 16 in hopes of
securing a conference title. The No. 1
Cardinal is poised to capture the con
ference championship after avenging
an early loss to the Golden Bears earli
er this year.The event lasts through the
weekend. Pac-lOs are expected to pro
vide solid preparation for the women
as they get ready for the NCAA Cham
pionships, which begin on May 29.
Both events will be held in Gold River,
Calif.
The Stanford women's lightweight
team was also victorious at Big Row.
defeating Cal's third varsity eight. The
team is currently tied with Radcliffe
(Harvard) for the second spot in the
national rankings. The lightweights
head to the Pacific Coast Champi
onships on May 16. This event is also
expected to be a stepping stone for the
team as it gears up for the Intercolle
giate Rowing Association (IRA) Na
tional Championships. Both regattas
will be held in Sacramento.
"The open-water win against their
open-weights was a good sign of our
progress and strength this season, but
we have room for improvement in the
next month before taking on our rivals
at nationals," sophomore lightweight
Katherine Heflin said.
