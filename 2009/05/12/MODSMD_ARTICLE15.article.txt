perennial rival California on its
way to winning the tournament,
despite several shaky showings.
No. 6 Bloodthirsty started off
the Northwest Regionals against

game, where Bloodthirsty won
12-11. While Cal got off to an
earlv lead, Stanford tightened its

defense and ended the half with a
4-1 run. Stanford eventually
buckled down on defense while
making some great passes and
catches to win the game.

was going to be close and a real
battle, but we thought that our
depth would help us pull away in
the second half," said junior team
