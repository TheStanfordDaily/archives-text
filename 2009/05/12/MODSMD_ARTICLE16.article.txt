# Manny being Manny, sort of
## 
### 
Manny Ramirez, suspended last
week for 50 games for steroid use, re
cently addressed his teammates on the
issue. The remarks, prepared at the re
quest of Los Angeles owner Frank
McCourt, were given last night at
Dodger Stadium. The Daily has been
fortunate enough to obtain his
speech, and will reprint it here for
public viewing.
Thanks for coming, every
one. I'll be brief. I won't
even continue to deny the
obvious. 1 admitted this to
Mr. McCourt, and I'll
admit it to you. Yes, I did steroids. But
what I didn't tell Mr. McCourt is this:
I don't regret it.
Let's be honest, I am not the only
one in this clubhouse who has juiced.
I'd only be mildly surprised if the
number of people who has reached
into double figures. I'm not trying to
out anyone, but let's not blind our
selves to the facts. Steroid users are
no longer pariahs, but instead the
rule. It's nothing foreign — doping in
this sport goes back to the days of
Eisenhower. It's just in this past
decade that we've become funda
mentally against it.
And so now we hear talk of aster
isks next to all of our records —
Barry Bonds. Mark McGwire, Alex
Rodriguez and me. But are we to act
like an entire generation of baseball
players never existed, never played
the game? This isn't merely a trou
bled few looking for a way to get
ahead — this is an institutional issue.
Baseball could have acted; it did not.
So, a cycle was born. Some use
and get ahead, and others feel left be
hind. so they dope up as well. But.
I'm not telling you anything that you
don't already know. We're cut from
the same cloth—you all know the
game — which is why I'll confide
these thoughts in you. But in public.
Manny can no longer be Manny, at
least for now. It's best for me to lay
low for now and not voice these opin
ions. I'm sure you look to me and say,
"If there's one superstar juicer who
will say what we're all thinking, it will
be Manny." No. it won't be. I'll play

along with the apology jig because at
some point. I have to preserve my
livelihood, and given how high and
mighty everyone is on the steroid
issue, I'd essentially he talking myself
out of the League. I may he edgy, hut
I haven't lost my mind.
That said, these thoughts will re
main with me. as I'm sure they will
remain with you. I'm fine being be
rated in public bv pundits who make
their paychecks by tearing down leg
ends. or by a general manager who
saved his career by trading for me.
But here, in this room, let's just be
real with ourselves. Let's acknowl
edge the 800-pound gorilla: we are all
complicit, and we all know the un
written law of land. Don't ask. don't
tell and definitely do not get caught.
But I was caught, so now 1 will say
this, to you, my teammates: The only
thing I'm truly sorry for is that I was
n't smart enough to shield my usage
better. And not even because of the
public shame it brought my family
and me — no. because my positive
test meant that I would have to sit
out nearly a third of the season, and.
let's be frank,there are few players in
the League more valuable to their
franchise than I am to the Dodgers.
From the playing field to extensive
marketing campaigns. 1 am. for all in
tents and purposes. Dodgers baseball
in the modern era. My absence will
hurt the team in the standings, and
for that 1 apologize.
But, we do play in the NLWest
it is so weak that merely breaking
.500 is probably enough to win the di
vision title. If we can't maintain our
lead without me, then we have far
greater issues than my steroid usage.
Still. I look forward to rejoining
you in July for the dog days of the
summer and eventually the postsea
son. Until that time. I simply ask that
you understand my perspective. And
given the pervasiveness of this so
called problem and its likely pres
ence in this very clubhouse. I know
you will.
