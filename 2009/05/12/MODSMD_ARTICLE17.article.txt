### ERIC MESSINGER DESK EDITOR 
Paul Stockton, a senior research scholar for home
land security at Stanford's Center for International
Security and Cooperation (CISAC), is President
Obama's nominee for Assistant Secretary for Defense
in charge of Homeland Defense and America's
Security Affairs.
Stockton will testify tomorrow before the United
States Armed Services Committee.
President Qbama was enthusiastic about the choice,
which comes along with the nomination of HIV expert
Eric Goosby to the State Department.
"The American people will be well-served b\ the
addition of these skilled and dedicated individuals."
Obama said in a White House press release."They will
be valued voices in my administration, and I'm confi
dent they will work to the greatest of their ability as we
work to tackle the challenges ahead of us and keep the
American people safe.
"I look forward to working with them in the coming
months and years." Obama added.
Stockton's responsibilities are aligned with his
research interests, which include homeland security
and responses to changing security threats.
CISAC co-Director Lynn Eden praised the
appointment.
"I've known Paul for a long time." Eden said. "He's
a very capable administrator: very strategic, able to set
priorities well and able to implement well.
"1 le also has tremendous political skills." she added.

Stockton's appointment is one of a number of high
profile moves from CIS AC to government in recent
history. C urrently, three members of CISAC serve on
either the National Security Council or the White
House Domestic Policy Council, including senior
research scholar Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall, CISAC
faculty member and Law Prof. Mariano-Florentino
Cuellar and former CISAC post-doctoral fellow and
Political Science Prof. Michael McFaul. who has main
tained ties with the organization.
Despite this. Eden said that CISAC did not put par
ticular emphasis upon government appointments.
"Being on the West Coast, it is not our main aim to
get people to Washington," Eden said. "We're very
proud and pleased when this happens, but it's not a
measure of our merit."
Eden also emphasized that she had no worries
about organizational continuity.
"We have a very stable crew," she said.
Stockton's CISAC colleagues expressed strong con
fidence in him as an appointee.
"Paul Stockton is a superb choice." said Scott Sagan,
political science prof, and CISAC co-director, in an
email to the Daily.
"He has deep substantive knowledge of the man\
national and homeland security challenges we face
today, has worked closely with both the U.S. military
and with foreign military officers through his position
at the Naval Postgraduate School, and excelled as a
staff member on Capitol Hill." Sagan added. "Paul
Stockton is an excellent example of a talented CISAC
scholar-practitioner — following in the tradition of
William Perry — who leaves Stanford for the
Pentagon to help serve the country."
Stockton has been working on Stanford's campus
for the past three years.
