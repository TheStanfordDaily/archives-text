How likely do you think it is that President Oboma will
nominate an openly homosexual justice for the Supreme
Court at some point during his administration?
a) Very likely. There's enough political momentum and it

b) Not sure. It will depend on how the gay rights

c) Unlikely. It's a big political battle to take on.
d) Not a chance.
e) I don't care.
