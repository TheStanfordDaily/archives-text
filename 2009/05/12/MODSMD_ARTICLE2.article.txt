## New student programs hit by cuts First-generation., low-income student programs face setback 
### LAURA STAMPLER 
The economic crisis is creating obstacles
for Stanford's continued efforts to increase
programming for low-income and first-gener
ation college students, according to University
administrators.
Last summer, the offices of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education
(VPUE) and the Vice Provost for Student
Affairs (VPSA) hired Siobhan Greatorex-
Voith to direct a year-long pilot project called
the"I irst Generation Program." providing
resources to first-generation and low-income
students.
Due to the economic crunch, however,
Greatorex-Voith's contract will not -be
renewed for the next academic year after it
expires on Aug. 31. She will be replaced by
(ireg Graves, who will work part-time at the
Native American Cultural Center and part
time on first-generation student issues for the
VPSA.
()ther programs have also been affected by
the economic crunch. The Bridge Program
a VPUE project proposed last year and sup
ported by the President's Fund â€” aims to
assist low-income students or students from
under-resourced high schools in making the
transition to Stanford. Although it was never
fully underway, the project has been put on
hold indefinitely until there is a shift in the
economic climate. Administrators still claim
that the program will go forward once the
recession subsides.
"I have every expectation that when the
economic crisis resolves, we will resume the
planning efforts for The Bridge Program with
lull force and enthusiasm," said Julie Lythcott-
Haims 'K l ). who has been involved with the
program as dean of freshmen and transfer stu
dents.
According to Sally Dickson, assistant vice
provost for Student Affairs, the cuts in VPSA
have been made with the intention of retain
ing "core" elements within offices.
"We all know that the economic crunch is
going to have an impact; what the actual out
come of that impact will be we don't know
yet." Dickson said. "What our concern is, is
that each office is still able to carry out its core
of responsibilities and functions to our stu
dents."
This is of particular importance with first
generation and low-income students, who
make up a significant proportion of the
Stanford student body.
According to Greatorex-Voith, official data
from the Office of Undergraduate Admission
says that 17.5 percent of the freshman class is
made up ol first-generation students, and that
number has gradually increased.
I lowever, financial data is confidential and
so the classification of low-income students is
not entirely clear. Greatorex-Voith estimated
that the number of low-income students
ranges from 12-20 percent of the undergradu
ate student body. Thirteen percent of students
