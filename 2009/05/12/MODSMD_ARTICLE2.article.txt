# BUDGET CUTS
## New student programs hit by cuts First-generation., low-income student programs face setback 
### LAURA STAMPLER 
The economic crisis is creating obstacles
for Stanford's continued efforts to increase
programming for low-income and first-gener
ation college students, according to University
administrators.
Last summer, the offices of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education
(VPUE) and the Vice Provost for Student
Affairs (VPSA) hired Siobhan Greatorex-
Voith to direct a year-long pilot project called
the"I irst Generation Program." providing
resources to first-generation and low-income
students.
Due to the economic crunch, however,
Greatorex-Voith's contract will not -be
renewed for the next academic year after it
expires on Aug. 31. She will be replaced by
(ireg Graves, who will work part-time at the
Native American Cultural Center and part
time on first-generation student issues for the
VPSA.
()ther programs have also been affected by
the economic crunch. The Bridge Program
a VPUE project proposed last year and sup
ported by the President's Fund — aims to
assist low-income students or students from
under-resourced high schools in making the
transition to Stanford. Although it was never
fully underway, the project has been put on
hold indefinitely until there is a shift in the
economic climate. Administrators still claim
that the program will go forward once the
recession subsides.
"I have every expectation that when the
economic crisis resolves, we will resume the
planning efforts for The Bridge Program with
lull force and enthusiasm," said Julie Lythcott-
Haims 'K l ). who has been involved with the
program as dean of freshmen and transfer stu
dents.
According to Sally Dickson, assistant vice
provost for Student Affairs, the cuts in VPSA
have been made with the intention of retain
ing "core" elements within offices.
"We all know that the economic crunch is
going to have an impact; what the actual out
come of that impact will be we don't know
yet." Dickson said. "What our concern is, is
that each office is still able to carry out its core
of responsibilities and functions to our stu
dents."
This is of particular importance with first
generation and low-income students, who
make up a significant proportion of the
Stanford student body.
According to Greatorex-Voith, official data
from the Office of Undergraduate Admission
says that 17.5 percent of the freshman class is
made up ol first-generation students, and that
number has gradually increased.
I lowever, financial data is confidential and
so the classification of low-income students is
not entirely clear. Greatorex-Voith estimated
that the number of low-income students
ranges from 12-20 percent of the undergradu
ate student body. Thirteen percent of students
receive I'll I. grants, which the fed
eral government awards to students
whom it qualities as low-income.
When those groups combine, the
number increases even further and
has been "guesstimated" to be
roughly around 24 percent ol the
student body. Greatorex Voith said.
"The Stanford community has
always included first-generation stu
dents and low-income students."
Lythcott-Haims said, "and over the
years we have developed greater
competence around understanding
the barriers they encounter and pro
viding the resources necessary to
help them have full access to the full
set of opportunities a Stanford edu
cation has to offer."
Cireatorex-Voith's position has
involved looking into better prac
tices to evaluate students' experi
ences holistically.
"Part of the pilot has been
research-based," she said. "I have
been assessing what students' needs
are. what their experiences are.
meeting with students: so. some of
the research has been more qualita
tive. I talk to students and help con
nect them with the resources that
are available on campus. I've been
more of a connector and emotional
social support in that sense."
(ireatorex-Voith also worked
with students to build communities
on campus. Among those is Next
Gen. an organization that puts on
programming across campus for
low-income and first-generation
students, and also has participants
reach out to their hometown
schools and assist students through
the application and scholarship
process.
"Siobhan, she's. . . wow." said
Michael McDaniels OS. president of
Next Gen "I'm so happy that her
position was put in place because
prior to this, when we started last
year, there was nobody, and now we
actually have someone in the
administration \\ ho can lobby for lis.
It has been a lot easier just to get
things done to gain legitimacy
because she lias the legitimacy of an
administrator. I think that it also
helps that she has some extra fund
ing. so if we want to have an event,
she can chin in."

(ireatorex-Voith said she under
stood the reasoning behind the cut.
"I think that there was the inten
tion there that it would continue."
she said, "but when the economy
started to go downward and they
were facing the challenge of where
to cut, they were not looking at
bringing in new budget line items
when they were needing to cut
back."
Many students among the low
income and first-generation com
munity said they are worried about
the loss of Greatorex-Voith.
"We are going from someone
who is sort of a recent graduate with
a centralized understanding [and]
who's in the office five days a week,
to someone who is not a recent
graduate, must be fulfilling multiple
roles and who will probably be in
the office maybe one day a week."
said Heather Buckelew 10. who
identifies herself as both low
income and first-generation.
Graves, who will be taking over
for ( ireatorex-Voith. did not return

made an effort to create long-term
programming for these students.

there will be low-income and first

reach out to this group at the begin
ning of the year and create welcome

Furthermore, they hope that it will
strengthen the community and give
first-generation and low-income
students an outlet that they might
not have otherwise received.
"There are resources in commu

aren't available to everyone in the
low-income and first-generation
category." Buckelew said. "I'm
white, for example, and can't go to

ages. Aside from financial aid. how
ever. McDaniels said he worries for
Next Gen's continued funding —
without Greatorex-Voith as an
advocate in the administration
especially considering that Next
Gen is a relatively new group on
campus.
In spite of un-renewed positions
and holds on programming, there is
still hope amongst administrators
for continued support of low-income
and first-generation students.
"Commitment is still there, and
the commitment to this community
is still there." Greatorex-Voith said.
"What our goal continues to be is
to create a welcoming environment
to all of our students and under
standing that students from different
backgrounds will have different
experiences at Stanford, and we
want to make sure that we are
addressing their transition to
Stanford." Dickson said. "This also
allows us to be thinking of socio-eco
nomic class in a very thoughtful way
and to recogni/e that students from
this community can add so much
value to the experience for all
Stanford students."

The economic crisis is creating obstacles
for Stanford's continued efforts to increase
programming for low-income and first-gener
ation college students, according to University
administrators.
Last summer, the offices of the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate Education
(VPUE) and the Vice Provost for Student
Affairs (VPSA) hired Siobhan Greatorex-
Voith to direct a year-long pilot project called
the"I irst Generation Program." providing
resources to first-generation and low-income
students.
Due to the economic crunch, however,
Greatorex-Voith's contract will not -be
renewed for the next academic year after it
expires on Aug. 31. She will be replaced by
(ireg Graves, who will work part-time at the
Native American Cultural Center and part
time on first-generation student issues for the
VPSA.
()ther programs have also been affected by
the economic crunch. The Bridge Program
a VPUE project proposed last year and sup
ported by the President's Fund — aims to
assist low-income students or students from
under-resourced high schools in making the
transition to Stanford. Although it was never
fully underway, the project has been put on
hold indefinitely until there is a shift in the
economic climate. Administrators still claim
that the program will go forward once the
recession subsides.
"I have every expectation that when the
economic crisis resolves, we will resume the
planning efforts for The Bridge Program with
lull force and enthusiasm," said Julie Lythcott-
Haims 'K l ). who has been involved with the
program as dean of freshmen and transfer stu
dents.
According to Sally Dickson, assistant vice
provost for Student Affairs, the cuts in VPSA
have been made with the intention of retain
ing "core" elements within offices.
"We all know that the economic crunch is
going to have an impact; what the actual out
come of that impact will be we don't know
yet." Dickson said. "What our concern is, is
that each office is still able to carry out its core
of responsibilities and functions to our stu
dents."
This is of particular importance with first
generation and low-income students, who
make up a significant proportion of the
Stanford student body.
According to Greatorex-Voith, official data
from the Office of Undergraduate Admission
says that 17.5 percent of the freshman class is
made up ol first-generation students, and that
number has gradually increased.
I lowever, financial data is confidential and
so the classification of low-income students is
not entirely clear. Greatorex-Voith estimated
that the number of low-income students
ranges from 12-20 percent of the undergradu
ate student body. Thirteen percent of students
receive I'll I. grants, which the fed
eral government awards to students
whom it qualities as low-income.
When those groups combine, the
number increases even further and
has been "guesstimated" to be
roughly around 24 percent ol the
student body. Greatorex Voith said.
"The Stanford community has
always included first-generation stu
dents and low-income students."
Lythcott-Haims said, "and over the
years we have developed greater
competence around understanding
the barriers they encounter and pro
viding the resources necessary to
help them have full access to the full
set of opportunities a Stanford edu
cation has to offer."
Cireatorex-Voith's position has
involved looking into better prac
tices to evaluate students' experi
ences holistically.
"Part of the pilot has been
research-based," she said. "I have
been assessing what students' needs
are. what their experiences are.
meeting with students: so. some of
the research has been more qualita
tive. I talk to students and help con
nect them with the resources that
are available on campus. I've been
more of a connector and emotional
social support in that sense."
(ireatorex-Voith also worked
with students to build communities
on campus. Among those is Next
Gen. an organization that puts on
programming across campus for
low-income and first-generation
students, and also has participants
reach out to their hometown
schools and assist students through
the application and scholarship
process.
"Siobhan, she's. . . wow." said
Michael McDaniels OS. president of
Next Gen "I'm so happy that her
position was put in place because
prior to this, when we started last
year, there was nobody, and now we
actually have someone in the
administration \\ ho can lobby for lis.
It has been a lot easier just to get
things done to gain legitimacy
because she lias the legitimacy of an
administrator. I think that it also
helps that she has some extra fund
ing. so if we want to have an event,
she can chin in."

(ireatorex-Voith said she under
stood the reasoning behind the cut.
"I think that there was the inten
tion there that it would continue."
she said, "but when the economy
started to go downward and they
were facing the challenge of where
to cut, they were not looking at
bringing in new budget line items
when they were needing to cut
back."
Many students among the low
income and first-generation com
munity said they are worried about
the loss of Greatorex-Voith.
"We are going from someone
who is sort of a recent graduate with
a centralized understanding [and]
who's in the office five days a week,
to someone who is not a recent
graduate, must be fulfilling multiple
roles and who will probably be in
the office maybe one day a week."
said Heather Buckelew 10. who
identifies herself as both low
income and first-generation.
Graves, who will be taking over
for ( ireatorex-Voith. did not return
multiple requests for comment.
Knowing that she will not be
here next year. Greatorex-Voith has
made an effort to create long-term
programming for these students.
New Student Orientation (NSO)
has been revamped to include low
income and first-generation pro
gramming. For the first time ever,
there will be low-income and first
generation community coordina
tors, as well as three community ori
entation volunteers (COVs) to
reach out to this group at the begin
ning of the year and create welcome
events.
Class will also be an issue that is
discussed during the NSO event
I-ACMS. Students within the com
munity are hopeful that increased

comfort or shame amongst students.
Furthermore, they hope that it will
strengthen the community and give
first-generation and low-income
students an outlet that they might
not have otherwise received.
"There are resources in commu
nity centers, but those resources
aren't available to everyone in the
low-income and first-generation
category." Buckelew said. "I'm
white, for example, and can't go to
F.l Centro Chicano."

most crucial points is that there will

and holds on programming, there is
still hope amongst administrators
for continued support of low-income
and first-generation students.
"Commitment is still there, and
the commitment to this community
is still there." Greatorex-Voith said.
"What our goal continues to be is
to create a welcoming environment

backgrounds will have different

want to make sure that we are
