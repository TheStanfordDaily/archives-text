## Former Secretary of State discusses meaning of life at Memorial Church 
### AN LE NGUYEN SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
Not a seat was empty in
Memorial Church last night as
Hoover Fellow and former
Secretary of State George Shultz
delivered a powerful speech on "The
Power of Ought" in his role as the
2009 Rathbun Visiting Fellow.
Shultz shared with the audience his
perspective on the values that con
tribute to a fulfilling life.
Shultz's speech marked the sec
ond annual Last Lecture, which
commemorates the late Harry
Rathbun's lifelong mission of exam
ining the meaning of human exis
tence. A Stanford Law School pro
fessor. Rathbun dedicated his last
lecture to this theme after reading
about a graduating student's trepi
dation in setting out into an uncer
tain world.
Harrv's Last Lecture on a

Meaningful Life began in the 1930s
and continued until Rathbun's
retirement in 1959. The lectures
were recently reintroduced when
the Office for Religious Life
received an endowment from the
Foundation for Global Community
(FGC) and decided to sponsor visit
ing fellows and University activities
in Rathbun's honor. Last year's
speaker was former Supreme Court
Associate Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor.
At Monday's event. Richard
Rathbun. chairman of the FGC
Board of Trustees, introduced Shultz
as "a person who is himself a mes
sage."
Explaining his vision of a mean

human actions are governed by the
concepts of "is" and "ought." But the

the world is and where it should be
is the difficulty, Shultz argued.
According to Shultz, the power
of ought is "the idea that you have a
vision out there — a place you
should go — and how complicated
it is in getting there."
Throughout his speech, Shultz
rooted this assertion in his own life
experiences. Among his many
achievements, Shultz served as
Secretary of the Treasury and
Secretary of State under Richard
Nixon and Ronald Reagan, respec
tively.
Outside of the political* arena,
Shultz has also worked as an aca
demic and businessman, lie is cur
rently professor emeritus of inter
national economics at the Graduate
School of Business and a distin
guished fellow at the Hoover
Institution.
In his speech, Shultz frequently
referred to his experience as

Secretary of State to explain how
individuals can work to transform
"what is" into "what ought to be."
Shultz used the Reagan-Gorbachev
vision of a nonnuclear world as an
example of an ideal that has been
achieved.
For Shultz, the Cold War repre
sented a time in which many
thought that mutually assured
destruction protected nations from
nuclear destruction. Having served
behind the lines, he stated that
there were "too many close calls"
for this tense state to feasibly con
tinue.
Shultz strongly argued. "People
don't have disputes because they
have weapons — they have weapons
because they have disputes."
For him. the peaceful resolution
between the Soviet Union and the
United States, made possible
through diplomacy and coopera
tion. highlighted the "interactive
process between the vision and the
things you need to do to achieve the
vision."
"Obviously, his big message was:
we always have to be looking at
how things are and how they ought

to be." Oliver Ennis 'II said of
Shultz's speech. "I le always had the
'ought' insight guiding his actions."
Although the audience left with
a clear understanding of Shultz's
message, many spectators had
entered unsure of what to expect
from the lecture.
"I came in with no expectations."
said Neth Walker, a graduate stu
dent in geological and environmen
tal sciences. "I think I've been here
long enough to know that a lot of
times it's hard to tell what some
body is going to speak about."
"That being said. 1 was
impressed by the message that he
offered and the hope that he
offered for the future." Walker
added.
Ennis also commended Shultz's
insight as a leader.
"Because he had a clear idea of
where he wanted to go. it really
helped him develop a clear objec
tive along the way on how to get
there." Ennis said. "I'm just very
grateful to have been able to hear
from such a distinguished person."
