## Out Law Profs, would make history on Supreme Court 
### ERIC MESSINGER DESK EDITOR 
Two Stanford Law School professors who
have been mentioned as top contenders for a
Supreme Court nomination are causing
excitement within the Stanford LGBT com
munity for each one's potential to he the first
openly homosexual justice on the bench.
Law School Profs. Kathleen Sullivan and
Pamela Karlan, both openly lesbian, have

been the subject of national press attention
in the speculation over who President
Obama will nominate to fill the seat of retir
ing Justice David Souter. Souter recently
announced he will step down at the start of
the C ourt's summer recess.
Political Science Prof Gary Segura stud
ies the phenomenon of "descriptive repre
sentation''— the representation of women
by women. African Americans by African
Americans and similar phenomena — in the

broader context of minority politics. I le said
that by virtue of their identity, either Karlan
or Sullivan could have a significant effect on
the Court.
"Their presence in the decision-making
body brings a point of view that might not
otherwise be heard." Segura said.
Segura added that they could also check
hostile behavior on the part of justices
toward gavs and lesbians as minority groups
simply bv their presence.

"It makes it very hard for
arguments to be advanced that
were particularly disrespectful
of gay persons, or openly homo
phobic." Segura s;iid. "whether
in chambers or in public."

Law Prof. Deborah Rhode

who works on issues relating to gender
and antidiscrimination in law. said the

appointment of either woman would
he a landmark event.
"I think it would be an enormous
step forward for the gay rights
movement to have an out lesbian on
the Court," Rhode said. "I think it
would help break stereotypes and
legitimate their qualifications and
legitimate their normality."
"Certainly having a role model
on the caliber of Kathleen Sullivan
or Pamela Karlan for the nation to
see can only be for the best." she
added.
Rhode acknowledged that an
actual nomination for either, or for
any openly homosexual person,
would put the nominee under a
great deal of scrutiny.
"It would take a personal toll."
Rhode said. "It sets them up on the
receiving end for a lot of hate mail."

Rhode cited her own memories
of harsh resistance to the nomina

tion of current Justice Thurgood
Marshall, the first African American
to serve on the Court, for whom she
clerked.
"I think it certainly adds a level of
vulnerability to the nominee,"
Rhode said. "But it also is an oppor
tunity to do something that is a land
mark."
"[The level of controversy]
wouldn't be unprecedented," she
added.
Students within Stanford's LGBT
community are enthusiastic about
the possibility of the first homosexu
al Court nominee. Jamie Tam '10, an
organizer with the Queer-Straight
Alliance and the Emma Goldman
Society for Queer Liberation, feels
the move would have great signifi
cance.
"The advancement of LGBT life
would be tremendous if there were
an openly queer person on the
Court," Tam said.
Tam also noted that Sullivan or
Karlan's "would do a lot for the
queer women's movement, which is
often marginalized."
Laura Wadden '09. a leader of the

Emma Goldman Society, agreed on
the particular significance of having
a member of the homosexual com
munity on the Court.
"1 would say it's different to have
someone advocate on your behalf
than it is to have someone who is
one of you." Wadden said.
Wadden said her respect for
Karlan also predates her knowledge
of her personal life.
"I've seen Pamela Karlan lecture
a bunch of times, and I actually did
n't know she was out until this news
broke." Wadden said. "I've always
been really impressed with her."
Sam King '10. an active member
in the LGBT community, said there
was the potential for a significant
step to be made.
"This is definitely a unique histor
ical opportunity," King said. "It
might not happen, but I'm optimistic
about it."
Segura also expressed doubt
about the likelihood that President
Obama would choose a homosexual
nominee, citing the administration's
unwillingness to engage on hot-but
ton gay rights issues in other areas.

including the military's "don't ask.
don't tell" policy and the choice of
Pastor Rick Warren to participate in
Obama's inauguration.
"The probability that either of
them is selected is very low." Segura
said. "President Obama has not
made gay priorities a priority of his
administration."
Still, students agreed that even
the discussion has symbolic value.
Rhode said that while she wished
Karlan and Sullivan's sexuality was
not significant to their consideration,
"that's not the world in which we
live," and the struggle for societal
acceptance often requires steps of
this nature.
"The only way we can get there is
to let people with the courage and
lifestyles be out there to represent,"
Rhode said.
Tam said that having representa
tion from Stanford would also be an
exciting prospect.
"1 think it's cool." she said. "It
would just be really, really cool."
