## PC of Mind Students tread fine line between political correctness and over-sensitivity 
### MELANIE SCHEIBILE 
Political correctness (PC) has a degree
of jurisdiction over a wide range of
contentious issues, on campus and
off. But the actual term "political
correctness" is ill-defined, at best.
This contributes to a variety of opinions about
when and where it's appropriate to be PC.
Members of Students for an Open Society
(SOS) confront issues like these.
"Politically incorrect? Is that supposed to
have a positive or negative connotation?"
questioned SOS member Boris Hanin '09.
Considering political correctness itself has
become something akin to censorship. SOS
believes it's better to be accountable than
politically correct.
"It's good [that we aren't offensive] insofar
as when things are less offensive, people are
generally being held more accountable."
Hanin said. "When something is offensive, it is
often closely associated to the fact that it is
fabricated or exaggerated."
At Stanford, it seems common to be cau
tious in choosing language when referring to
groups of certain races, ethnicities, religions,
genders or sexual orientations.
Students in the "Freedom, Equality and
Difference" Introduction to the Humanities
(IHUM) course said they asked their Teaching
Fellows (TFs) what terminology to use when
referring to members of racial groups.
Program in Writing and Rhetoric (PWR)
instructor Susan Schuyler identified a few
guidelines for students, such as to avoid put
ting the word "the" in front of any racial or
religious group.
However, Schuyler doesn't believe there
are very comprehensive resources available to
determine what is and is not PC. Rather, it is
an individual's responsibility and decision to
determine what kind of language is appropri
ate in any particular setting.
Schuyler prefers to err on the safe side.
"[I would] rather see people being over
sensitive," she said.
The rationale for beint> "over-sensitive" is

the potential benefits for both the speaker and
the listener in exchanges that are kept at a PC
level. Theoretically, being politically correct
should make us, as speakers, tolerant and
open-minded: as listeners, it should make us
respected and comfortable.
Experts, though, do not always support this
goal to be "politically correct."
"I'm rejecting the term ["political correct
ness"] outright." said Fred Turner, assistant
professor of communication and. by courtesy,
of American Studies. "The practice is to be
sensitive to difference. PC' can be a snarkv
term for that important process."
SOS aims to promote open dialogue across
campus, which can reach the core of complex
and controversial issues. Group members real
ize this can provoke offensive or insulting
remarks, but find it important that people are
able to appreciate opposing views and opin
ions. The discourse is to remain reasonable
and respectful to elicit legitimate considera
tion.
"Being PC is important because you need
to coexist, but it comes to an extreme when
you can't ask the really tough questions." said
Nada Ramadam '10. president of the Muslim
Student Awareness Network (MSAN). "K
they know someone in their class or in their
dorm. I don't think there's anything wrong
with having a heated discussion."
Ramadam added that she feels the pressure
in American culture to be PC. which she never
experienced in her native home of Saudi
Arabia. Yet. the dialogue keeps going.
"One of the things I love about Stanford
students is they'll raise sensitive issues in class
â€” for example, when an African student

encounters an African American
student's idea of race." Turner said.
"We have a culture where we can
talk about that kind of stuff."
lint what about political incorrect
ness?* Humor can take the form of
racial slurs, mimicking stereotypes 01
exploiting the disabilities of others.
MSAN. however, utilized
humor to bring a better
understanding to the non-
Muslim community about Islam by
putting on a comedy show earlier
this year.
"We had a lot of debate about
what the comedians should and
shouldn't be able to say."
Ramadam said. "Comedy is a
really touchy subject. We don't
want to monitor the comedy itself.

because if it's not touchy, it's not going to
be funny."
Prior success with Ahmed Ahmed, an
internationally popular Muslim come
dian. may have helped.
"Two years ago. Ahmed Ahmed
came and a lot of people came and
loved the act." Ramadam said. "But he
did make some Muslims uncomfort
able with jokes about Moses getting
high and seeing the Burning Bush. He
can get away with that because he's a
professional comedian."
Still, it's not always so easy for
Stanford students.
