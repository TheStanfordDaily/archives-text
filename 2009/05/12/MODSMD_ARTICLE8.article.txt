## EDITORIAL Univ. emergency response well-prepared for future 
### 
A large-scale disaster is a university's
worst nightmare. With 15,000 stu
dents in an earthquake-prone area
between three of the country's largest met
ropolitan areas and almost no annual rain
fall. Stanford is situated in the middle of a
hotbed for potential disasters. Fortunately,
Stanford takes a proactive response to po
tential disasters, which will hopefully mini
mize damage. It looks like the worst of the
swine flu (115N1) scare is behind us. but the
editorial board remains appreciative that
the University's emergency response proce
dures are here in case we really need them in
the future.
Stanford's Emergency Operations Cen
ter has been planning the University's re
sponse to a large-scale disease outbreak
since the SAKS scare several years ago. But
preparations really flew into full gear during
the swine flu scare and a lot of the work done
beforehand proved worthwhile, even if the
flu did not rapidly involve into the pandem
ic many expected.
Stanford is a national leader in using so
cial media for emergency response. The
AlertSU system — which has been develop
ing over the last several years — has
amassed emails, phone numbers and ad
dresses of students and relatives. And while
receiving text messages for emergency alert

testing at « a.m. on Saturday morning might
be annoying, these procedures, in the long
run. will give Stanford a powerful head start
in case of an emergency. Plans for a campus
wide siren are in place to further contribute
to Stanford's ability to communicate. One of
the chief lessons Stanford has learned is that
as many lines of communication as possible
are key to a well-executed response.
In addition to AlertSU. Stanford has di
rect lines of communication through every
department, and uses KZSU in the event of
an emergency. Stanford's earthquake re
sponse has also been noteworthy. Over the
past several years, Stanford has made a com
mitment to making every building on cam
pus "earthquake-safe," which the University
has more or less made good on. It is still de
batable how earthquake-safe a building can
be. but it certainly cannot hurt. In February,
Stanford ran a successful earthquake simu
lation which will hopefully come in handy in
the event of a real earthquake.
Stanford students, for the most part, tend
to remain blissfully ignorant of potential dis
asters that could spring up in the future. The
editorial board applauds Stanford's commit
ment to proactive disaster response. We
hope the day never comes when we have to
use these procedures, but it reassures us that,
if that day comes, we will be prepared.
