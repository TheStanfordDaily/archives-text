## EDITORIAL Univ. mishandled sorority housing situation 
### 
This housing Draw cycle presented
many challenges to the University
with the implementation of the new
Master Housing Plan. Gne of these chal
lenges was dealing with the sorority housing
situation, as sororities witnessed 20 percent
increases in rush and subsequent increases in
the minimum number of new members.
These increases meant the housed sororities
on campus — TriDelt. Theta and Pi Phi —
would face tough challenges when it came to
housing its new members. While the editorial
board understands the difficulties involved
in housing so many additional sorority mem
bers. we believe the University's handling of
the situation was not helpful.
In the past, housed sororities have been
able to decide their own chapter's housing
policy, but this year. Residential Education
(ResEd) sent a letter to housed sorority
members nine days before the Draw dead
line instructing them to give first priority to
seniors, second priority to juniors and third
priority to sophomores in accordance with
the University's new Master Housing Plan.
This mandate was an especially difficult thing
for housed sororities to face, considering
they typically tell potential new members
during Rush Week they will be given housing
their sophomore year — a large selling point
for those looking to become part of a new
community quickly No such mandate was
given to housed fraternities, which were left,
as usual, to decide their housing policies for
themselves.
This was an inappropriate move on
Res Ed's part. The purpose of the University
Master Housing Plan was to create an easier
and fairer housing process — one very good
way the new housing plan went about this
was by creating a system in which upperclass
men get priority in the housing process. But
in dealing with the sorority situation. ResEd
failed to recognize that issuing external man
dates on sororities that would prefer to de
cide their own housing processes is counter
active to the liberties sororities have received
in the past, and makes figuring out housing
much more difficult lor those students in
volved. Instead of allowine sororities — who

have the closest understanding of the inter
ests of upperclass members, new members
and the sorority as a whole — to decide their
housing policies for themselves, ResEd sud
denly decided that it would decide what was
best for the sororities.
Furthermore, notifying sororities of this
new rule little more than a week before the
Draw deadline forced individuals to scram
ble to change housing plans and create Draw
groups.an undue burden considering that the
University knew of the increased pledge
classes several weeks before the deadline. It
was also inappropriate for the University to
decide that sororities would be more strictly
regulated in their housing processes, while
leaving fraternities free to do as they please.
If the University decides to implement hous
ing requirements for housed Greek organi
zations. then these policies should be man
dated across all Greek houses, without dis
crimintation.
Although members of ResEd tried hard to
work with the sororities to find a solution,
their ultimate decision to mandate policy was
poor. The sorority housing situation has been
only partially resolved — TriDelt and Pi Phi
have managed to house all new members, but
Theta's housing situation remains unclear.
And this result was achieved at a cost, as some
upper-class members — including rising sen
iors— sacrificed their places and accepted
Tier Three housing next year for the sake of
their fellow sorority sisters.
It is important to keep in mind that the
University was involved in pushing sororities
to increase their pledge class sizes — a deci
sion that helped create the sorority housing
crunch in the first place — and there is no
reason why upperclass members should have
anticipated having to deal with this housing
problem as rising seniors. With over 6.000 un
dergraduate students on campus, the rising
seniors in sororities who were affected by
these policies were few. but the precedent of
imposing housing decisions on private stu
dent houses instead of expressing concerns
and allowing them to decide for themselves
does not bode well for future housing deci
sions.
