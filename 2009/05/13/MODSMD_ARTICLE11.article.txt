# The 						Voice of Experience
## Take it easy, take it easy 
### 
With midterms in lull swing and all of us
probably feeling at least a little bit
stressed lately. I thought I'd take the
time to reflect on the topic of work-life balance.
My guess is that this concept is. to put it mildly,
somewhat unfamiliar to most high-achieving
Stanford students.
I know it certainly was unfamiliar to me
when I was an undergraduate at I larvard. 1 lar
vard was a thrilling intellectual atmosphere,
and I'll always be grateful for going there. But
attending a top school has a dark side. too.
Being constantly surrounded by incredibly
successful people has the result of imprinting
the need for ultra-success into your brain, as
well as magnifying the feeling of failure if you
don't cure cancer by the time you're 23.
I was very ambitious in college, and I
worked hard and got good grades. At gradua
tion time, my friends and roommates all fol
lowed high-powered paths: Harvard Medical
School. Goldman Sachs. Oxford for a Rhodes
Scholarship, etc.
And so when I finished school. I looked to
carve out my own sector of the universe to be
master. I had studied engineering,and was curi
ous to explore other fields, finance seemed in
teresting. and my first real job out of schcx)l was
working on the floor of the New York Board of
Trade as a commodity options clerk. The goal
was to learn to become an options trader, and
then of course make millions of dollars.
One of the previous employees of my com
pany had made just under a million dollars in a
single wild day in the coffee pits. While I was
there,another trader made around $S(X).(XH) in
one day in orange juice. It was just like being
transported into the movie "Trading Places,"
except I didn't wind up on a yacht with Jamie
Lee Curtis.
Instead. I wound up spending day after day
getting elbowed in the face by huge.screaming,
wildly gesticulating commodity futures traders.
The job was exciting in some ways, and certain
ly a great education in finance,but I soon began
to realize that this was not how I wanted to
make my living.
Since that time, I've worked in saner fields:
teaching and engineering. And I've also
worked on modulating my ambition and hav
ing more of a work-life balance. I still want todo
my job really well and make a difference, but I
have to remind myself that I don't need to be
Bill Gates or Mother Theresa to have an impact
in the world.
So why am I mentioning this all now? Well,
I think achieving the kind of mindset that will
all( >w you to have a go< kJ balance in vour life be-

gins in college. If you allow yourself to be
caught up in the limitless ambition that a top
school like Stanford can foster, you might find
yourself forever scrambling for higher rungs of
success in order to be satisfied.
I also think there's another aspect to the
eternal quest for success — once you've
achieved it. failure is harder to tolerate because
it might indicate that you're not as gmd as you
once thought you were. It's like the curse of
being the best gunslinger in the West: the recog
nition is nice, but contenders are constantly
coming out of the wo<xJwork to challenge you.
and you spend your time scared to death that
the next one will be better than you.
So what's the cure to the treadmill? I think
it's to focus on doing your best with dedication
and care, while letting go of the results. It's easi
er said than done, but if you am achieve that
state of mind, you'll probably find that you suc
ceed most of the time anyway, with a lot less
stress. It also makes it easier to keep time for
friends, family, relaxing, etc., because you're less
terrified of what will happen if your grades slip
a bit or you have to quit one of your 18 extracur
ricular*.
I'm not saying that no one should ever
strive to start the next Google or be President
of the United States. If that's truly in your na
ture, then go for it.The world needs people like
I, arry, Sergey and Barack! My point is not to let
your rarefied environment instill in you false
ambition, or make you into someone you're
not.
In any case. I want to leave you with one of
my favorite quotations to think about when
you're deciding what classes to take, what
summer job to shoot for. what career to pick or
even how to spend your time. It's by Howard
Thurman. an American author and civil rights
leader. And it goes like this: "Don't ask your
self what the world needs. Ask yourself what
makes you come alive and then go do that. Be
cause what the world needs is people who
have come alive."
