# Too Big to Fail
## Integrity first? 
### 
I'd like to imagine that everyone has at
least one friend who seems to always
have it together (and that I'm not just
massively inferior to my friends). In my
case, my friend Kassandra Mangosing '10,
has always encapsulated everything I wish I
could be: down-to-earth, fully functional on
five hours of sleep and skilled in hand-to
hand combat.
In addition to being a full-time Stanford
student. Kassandra serves as the Cadet
Wing Commander of Air Force Reserve Of
ficer Training Corps (ROTC) Detachment
045. based at San Jose State University, a po
sition that has helped her build this skill set.
Though there was never a doubt in my
mind that 1 would be an epic failure in the
military, I recently became curious exactly
how epic a failure 1 would be. Could ROTC
training turn me, with all my self-indul
gence. into a woman of discipline?
Unfortunately. San Jose State recently
ended their spring term, so following Kas
sandra to her training was impossible. But,
in the name of pseudo-investigative journal
ism. 1 decided to design a makeshift ROTC
course for myself to see both how I faired
and whether 1 could become a person of
greater integrity in the process.
Because I like doing things that I know
I'll be relatively good at. I decided to start by
seeing how much sense I could make out of
an ROTC textbook. It was going well for the
first hundred pages or so — I learned when
to salute (short answer: all the time), the
characteristics of an effective team (trust
and commitment) and why the Lincoln's
Second Inaugural Address is a great piece of
writing (effective rhetoric, consistent mes
sage. clear leadership vision).
Things went immediately downhill when
I got to the "Terrain Analysis" section (no
pun intended). This requires evaluating the
terrain around you and then figuring out the
best locations for "cover and concealment."

After reading through the section. I decided
to try to apply what I'd learned by conceal
ing myself in the hushes outside the CoHo.
Within about thirty seconds, a little boy ran
up to me. burst into tears and ran away. I
called for an immediate retreat and bought
myself a soy latte.
I then spent a good 20 minutes trying to
use a protractor to determine my position
relative to true North and finally decided it
was " 1 ."Then I bought a cup of tomato basil
soup. Yes, 1 would love to be lost in the
wilderness with me, too.
Feeling somewhat crushed, I decided to
take a step back and practice folding the
American flag. Sure, it's something a group
of military personnel usually do at once, but
an ROTC pamphlet I found had a diagram
on proper folding technique, so I figured it
couldn't be that hard. Unfortunately, the
only flag I could get my hands on was the
French Tri-Color. Automatic fail.
Then, of course, came the physical fit
ness component of my training, Kassandra
told me that although AFROTC workouts
vary, they all stress "strength building and
endurance." She cited running long dis
tances as a good example, which I immedi
ately vetoed due to my mild scoliosis and
collapsed arches, which give me, as a podia
trist once put it,"the feet of a 60-year-old
woman."
Kassandra also mentioned that one
morning she and her fellow cadets did a
workout that included more than three hun
dred pushups in an hour. This morning. I
woke up at 5:30, put on the closest thing 1
own to a uniform (a Mexican club soccer
jersey that says "Rebel" in gold Gothic
script),and marched around my room for a
while. After saluting the mirror a few times.
I began the 300 push-up challenge, which
started out with me alternating pushups
with aerobics and ended with me alternat
ing pushups with lying on the floor and

weeping.
By any normal human metric, I'm in
pretty good shape (for the record, Hilly
Blanks workout tapes are way harder than
you think). 1 kept going with the pushups
until I got to 152, at which point I collapsed,
threw up and took a nap.
Hi us concluded the military training of
Jenna Reback.
Some of my other friends in ROTC told
me not to be discouraged, citing a peer in
their detachment (that's military-speak for
"group") who could only do a single pull-up
when he began training and can now do thir
ty-three in a row. As they see it. their train
ing is about honing physical and mental
strength — things that only happen through
continued experience over time.
Kassandra in particular explained that
her ability to work well with the other
cadets in her detachment came from having
shared so many experiences that required
everyone to push themselves past the limits
of what they thought possible. Further
more. these experiences helped her build
the character and equanimity that I'm so
jealous of.
If anything, my half-baked ROTC train
ing gave me further appreciation for the in
tegrity of my friends. Though my Stanford
education has benefited me in innumerable
ways, I know that a little more structure and
discipline couldn't hurt me.
Who knows? Maybe if I keep at it. I could
eventually do 300 push-ups in an hour. too.
No. probably not.

Jcnna is sore. Also, she would like to thank Kas
sandra and Iter other friends who made this ar
ticle possible. For more info on Detachment
