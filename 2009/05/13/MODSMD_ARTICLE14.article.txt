## ID card security system delayed due to budget cuts 
### ELLEN DANFORD 
Stanford is installing ID card
access in dorms across campus, at a
cost of $5 million dollars. The project
has been coordinating by Stanford IT
Services, along with Housing and
Dining Enterprises, and has been
dramatically reduced in scope due to
University budget cuts.
Currently, the program includes
Stern. Wilbur. Schiff and Adams in
Governor's Corner. Florence Moore,
Lagunita, Branner. Wilbur and
Roble. Full installation will take sev
eral years to complete.
"We had hoped to retrofit the
upperclass residences as well, but
with the financial crunch, we will
likely defer those for several years."
said Chief Financial Officer Randv
Livingston.
The aim of the initiative is to
increase the safety of students by
only allowing residents of a dorm
into the building with their recog
nized ID cards. All Stanford students
are allowed into the dining halls with
a valid SUID.
"The installation of card-key door
access systems is a long-term strate
gic initiative to enhance campus
security," Livingston said. "Our aspi
ration is to install these systems in
both student residences and academ
ic buildings throughout campus."
According to Alicia Restrepo,
assistant director for Housing,
Planning and Sustainability Projects,
the project, which began last sum
mer. has already seen systems set-up
at Stern, Wilbur. FloMo and Branner.
Lagunita is expected to finish in the
next couple weeks, and Roble's sys
tem will be running soon after
Commencement.
"Information Technology Services
and the University projected that
these installations would be completed
before the end of this academic year,"
added Executive Director of Student
Housing Rodger Whitney. "There
have been very few problems, if any."
But some students are not happy
that the project has been ongoing for
so long.
David Kravitz '12 expressed frus
tration at the length of the project.

"They told us it would be installed
at Lag by winter break." he said: the
installations at Lagunita have yet to
be completed.
Student responses to the construc
tion and logistics of the card system
have varied.
"The general student response to
the installation process has been very
positive." said Craig Harbick. the
front desk coordinator at Roble and
Branner. "Students enjoy the con
venience of just showing their cards,
rather than having to fish out a key."
Other students do not see the
point of installing a new way to
unlock the doors to residence com
plexes. but not to individual rooms.
"Unless the cards open our rooms
and the outer doors, it's a waste." said
Daniel Ibarra '\2. "If you go to
London School of Economics or
King's College, cards open both
doors like a hotel. It's not like we're
progressing any more technologically
if we are still using keys."
Kravitz expressed the same senti
ments.
"I'd rather just do all keys." he
said. "Why worry about two things at
once?"
Livingston and Whitney, however,
see the project as key to improving
campus security.
"There was a strong interest
IJniversity-wide in improving securi
ty across campus and using new tech
nology available to do so." Whitney
said, noting "the tragic events at
Virginia Tech and elsewhere, and also
experience and suggestions from par
ents and students who were familiar
with the card access systems at other
universities."
Other aspects of the project
include making a plan for crisis situa
tions and emergencies and adding
extra security measures at campus
residences.
Student Housing plans to contin
ue installation of card systems across
campus and asks students to take
care of their ID cards, seeing as it will
be one of the only ways to enter
buildings in coming years.
