## Senate discusses communication, commitees 
### ZOE RICHARDS SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After tweaking the Vaden Advisory
Board Bill and the Sustainability Bill for
ASSU Internal Events, the
Undergraduate Senate unanimously
passed both bills in Tuesday night's
meeting. The body then discussed orga
nizational changes to better specify the
purview of committees and communi
cation issues.
At the meeting, ASSU Vice
President Jay de la Torre' 10 announced
that the ASSIJ Executive Cabinet has
been selected for the upcoming year.
Andy Parker '11 and Bennett
Hauser MO will share top Executive
Cabinet positions as co-chiefs of staff.
Executive Cabinet members were
maintained in areas that continue the
legacy of mental health, diversity and
tolerance and sustainability pioneered
by previous ASSU Executives Jonny
Dorsey '(Wand Pagan Harris '09, do la
Torre added.
Incoming Schcx)l of Education grad
uate student Jon McNaughtan will serve
as the new Executive Cabinet member
responsible for graduate student out

reach. In accordance with the new
Executives' emphasis on improved
technologies and communication, there
will also be a chair of marketing and
human computer interaction, as well as
a chair of technology.
Senator Alex Katz '12. chair of the
Admin & Rules Committee, noted an
interest in re-evaluating and making
revisions to the Undergraduate by-laws,
noting three major flaws pertaining to
the responsibilities of each committee
within the Senate.
"112 irst is a lack of responsibility for
oversight of the internal Senate activi
ties." Katz said.
lie also addressed redefining the
responsibilities of the Student Life,
Housing & Education Committee
(SLHE).
"Right now. SLI IE has a budget to
do programming for the undergraduate
student body, and we think that is more
appropriate for the communications,
which is more in charge of interfacing
directly with the student body," Katz
said.
I le also proposed the specification
of clear differences between the SLHE
and Advocacy Committees, which he

described as. currently, "two amorphous
blobs." Katz suggested codifying the
separation between the two by chang
ing SLHE to a committee that
addressed health instead of housing,
while leaving its other objectives intact.
Essentially, such a committee would
address student life and voluntary stu
dent organizations (VSOs), and would
act as an oversight body to changes in
University policy and the like.
Katz suggested that the role of the
Advocacy Committee be further speci
fied with a name change to Community
& Residential Life Advocacy (CRLA),
focusing more on issues of housing and
dining, administration credibility and
transparency, public service, student
services and advocacy for community
centers.
Senator Zach Johnson '10. although
in agreement with the spirit of better
specifying the goals of each committee,
disagreed over what he saw as con
straining to the actions of each commit
tee and to A&R setting the agenda for
what committees ought to be doing.
"I think we're limiting ourselves and
making it too bureaucratic," Johnson
said.

As the Senate struggles to determine
the best means of communication with
the student KnJy. the body returned to
its discussion about the possibility of hir
ing a press secretary, which has been a
consideration since the last Senate left
office.
"The way you set out the vision, it
still seems almost like a reporter to me,
but backed by the Senate," said Senator
Mohammed Ali TO.
Several senators seemed to be in
agreement with what Anton Zietsnian
'12, chair of the Appropriations
Committee, described as a "logical"
assumption that the senators, as elected
officials, should have access to informa
tion that will enable them to better com
municate with all members of the
undergraduate community.
"I think that as the representatives of
the undergraduate class, it makes sense
that we should have access to every
member of that undergraduate class,"
Zietsman said. "I think that it would be
in the best interest of the undergraduate
class to know what we're doing."
