Despite this slip up. Stanford players still
have the utmost confidence in Storen.
"Drew is definitely our guv," kiilsgaard
said. "We go to him when the game is tight.
We'll go to him as early as he is ready. He got
unlucky tonight, but we know he did his job as
best he could."
The Cardinal took the lead in the top of the
ninth with a cheap run of its own. With two
outs, senior centerfielder Joey August reached

and driving in hig runs."
Storen. who came on to work the
Cardinal out of a first-and-third,
one-out jam in the seventh, was un
able to hold the lead.
Lost in the marathon of a game
was the pitching performance of
Stanford starter Michael Marshall.
The sophomore, making his first
start of the season and second of his
career, went five shutout innings, al
lowing just three hits while striking
out two. He left the game with a one
run lead that the Cardinal bullpen
was unable to hold onto.
Kiiisgaard led the Cardinal of
fense in the game. He had a third hit
to go along with his two late-inning
run-scoring singles.
Whitlow was also two-for-two off

the seventh. With the Cardinal lead
ing 4-2 and runners on second and
third, the game was delayed when
San Jose State coach Sam Piraro
came out to argue that Stanford re
liever Danny Sandbrink had balked.
Sandbrink turned toward second
for a pickoff attempt, but no in field
er was present. He then spiked the

ball into the ground and allowed
sophomore shortstop Jake Sch
lander to pick it up. Piraro argued,
but to no avail, as he was quickly
ejected.The balk controversy would
be deemed meaningless quickly as
Martin would then double into right
center, just out of the reach of a div
ing Kiilsgaard,scoring both runs and
tying the game.
Alter reliever Alex Pracher came
in and surrendered an infield single,
Storen was summoned. He then
struck out consecutive batters to
wiggle Stanford out of the jam.
This would be the end of the scor
ing until the ninth.
The Western Athletic Confer
ence-leading Spartans made a mess
of the game's scorebook, as they
used 25 players in the game. Only
five of the team's original starters
were still in the lineup at game's end.
Despite the long game, Stanford
has a quick turnaround as it plays
host to the University of Pacific this
evening at 5 p.m. on Sunken Dia
mond.
