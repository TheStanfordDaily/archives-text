The Stanford track and field team heads

in Eugene. Ore.
However, the team already has a good
start toward securing team titles thanks to
multi-event athletes, sophomores Corey
Dysick and Whitney Liehr. Dysick and
Liehr were in Eugene last weekend, as the
multi-event part of the Pac-10 ( hampi
onships started early.
Representing the men. Dysick competed
in the decathlon for the first time this sea
son. achieving a personal best of 6,864
points. Dysick's best event was the pole
vault, in which he secured a regional mark
and a career best with a vault of 16-6 3/4.
Dysick's performance allowed him to gath
er four points for the Cardinal men.
Liehr picked up three points for the
women with her personal best linish of
5.459 points, just shy of the automatic stan
dard. Liehr had two standout events.the 1(H)
meter hurdles and the long jump. Her leap

mark.
Willi an established base at the Pac-10
Championships, the rest ol the team will
hope to contend for the men's and women's
titles.
"Obviously we would love to win both
sides," said fifth-year senior and team cap
tain Claire Cormier-Thielke. 'II we pull to
gether and commit to some great perform
ances. anything is possible."
The women won the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSE) title in indoors
mere months ago.and the men were close to
the top as well. Most of the great indoor tal
ent has carried over to the outdoor season,
with some added runners as well. This
speaks to the fact that the men and women
do have a great chance to secure the title in
such a highly competitive arena.
"Just a few weeks ago, we defeated ( al in
the dual meet on both the men's and
women's sides." Cormier-1 hielke said.
"That's a meaningful accomplishment as
Cal is one of the top Pac-10 teams.
Cormier-Thielke herself will be compet
ing in the 800 meters,an event stacked with
top runners, all running incredibly similar
times. However, she is conlidcnt and look
ing for a Pac-10 Championship title in the
event; she will also be running the 4x400
