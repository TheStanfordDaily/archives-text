### ANARGHYA VARDHANA STAFF WRITER 
The Stanford track and field team heads
to the Pac-10 ( hampionships I his weekend
in Eugene. Ore.
However, the team already has a good
start toward securing team titles thanks to
multi-event athletes, sophomores Corey
Dysick and Whitney Liehr. Dysick and
Liehr were in Eugene last weekend, as the
multi-event part of the Pac-10 ( hampi
onships started early.
Representing the men. Dysick competed
in the decathlon for the first time this sea
son. achieving a personal best of 6,864
points. Dysick's best event was the pole
vault, in which he secured a regional mark
and a career best with a vault of 16-6 3/4.
Dysick's performance allowed him to gath
er four points for the Cardinal men.
Liehr picked up three points for the
women with her personal best linish of
5.459 points, just shy of the automatic stan
dard. Liehr had two standout events.the 1(H)
meter hurdles and the long jump. Her leap
of 19-11 1/2 was also a regional qualifying
mark.
Willi an established base at the Pac-10
Championships, the rest ol the team will
hope to contend for the men's and women's
titles.
"Obviously we would love to win both
sides," said fifth-year senior and team cap
tain Claire Cormier-Thielke. 'II we pull to
gether and commit to some great perform
ances. anything is possible."
The women won the Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation (MPSE) title in indoors
mere months ago.and the men were close to
the top as well. Most of the great indoor tal
ent has carried over to the outdoor season,
with some added runners as well. This
speaks to the fact that the men and women
do have a great chance to secure the title in
such a highly competitive arena.
"Just a few weeks ago, we defeated ( al in
the dual meet on both the men's and
women's sides." Cormier-1 hielke said.
"That's a meaningful accomplishment as
Cal is one of the top Pac-10 teams.
Cormier-Thielke herself will be compet
ing in the 800 meters,an event stacked with
top runners, all running incredibly similar
times. However, she is conlidcnt and look
ing for a Pac-10 Championship title in the
event; she will also be running the 4x400
relay.
Other top athletes for the women
include seniors Lauren Centrowitz,
Alicia Follmar, Idara Otu and
Michaela Wallerstedt. junior Griffin
Matthew, sophomores Brittni
Dixon-Smith and Arantxa King, and
freshmen Laurynne Chetelat and
Katerina Stefanidi.
The men. too, boast a talented
squad, led by the likes of seniors
Myles Bradley and Garrett Heath,
sophomore Elliot Heath, and fresh
men Chris Derrick and Amaechi
Morton. Elliot Heath and Derrick
will face off against Oregon's super
star. Galen Rupp. in the 3.000 me
ters.
Additionally, Derrick, ranked sev
enth in the nation for the 5,000 me
ters. will face Rupp once more in
that event, where Rupp holds the

No. 1 seed.
"If we want to compete for the
title, it's going to take a complete
team effort." said senior team cap
tain Hakon DeVries."Distance run
ners, sprinters, throwers and jumpers
are all going to have to contribute."
Although a relatively young
team, the Cardinal's energy is un
matched. and the combined motiva
tion of each athlete could bring a
championship title to fruition.
DeVries will be competing in the
1,500 meters and the 5,000 meters.
Placing fifth in the 1,500 last year,
DeVries once again hopes to score
points for the team and provide the
necessary push toward victory.
Going into the meet as the fastest
110-meter hurdler is senior team
captain Myles Bradley. Nearly un

touchable in the event. Bradley will
look to improve his own Stanford
record,and hopefully move up in the
national rankings. Most importantly,
Bradley's potential event win could
contribute massive points to the
team.
"The men's team has not placed
very high at this meet over the past
few years." Bradley said,"so we real
ly want to return to the top and fin
ish well."
Both vying for the titles, the Car
dinal men and women hope to pro
vide some excellent performances to
claim the Pac-10 Championship, and
also prepare for the upcoming re
gional and national meets.
