events. Stanford carried momentum on its
shoulders into the postseason, where the
young group of 37 placed third at nationals.
Not bad for a team that ballooned from
only a handful of riders back in the 19905.
"When 1 was a student, we did alright, but
only had six horses because it was challeng
ing for students to be full time managers of
the horses," remembers head coach Vanessa
Bartsch '99.
So how does a team grow from six

horses to 25?
"John Arrillaga said he would help out
with funding about lour years ago." Bartsch
said." 11 was really special because although
John is not a big horse guv. he loved the pro
gram and allowed horse people to actually
run it."
But even armed with funding, enthusi
asm from 37 riders and the knowledge that

equestrian is a budding varsity sport
around the nation, Stanford remains
at the club level.
Bartsch reasoned out this decision.
"We have five or six male riders,
some of whom are the best in the
country, and to keep the spirit of our
team and allow our team to partici
pate, and not just be a women's
sport, we should stay at the club
level."
Remaining a club sport also al
lows the program more flexibility in
caring for and managing the horses.
Each student dedicates hours a week
to the barn, beyond merely riding a
horse. Last year's team of just under
40 members put an astounding 5,000
hours in over the season.
Caring for horses takes time and
effort, but the hours a rider puts in
reciprocate in the arena.
Around a program with funding
and popularity, Bartsch watched
what was once a fledging idea grow
into its own campus culture — be
tween one third and one half of the
team lives at Stanford over the sum
mer to help with the horses.
"Our students do it because they
love horses," Bartsch said. "They are
able to find a home at the barn of
great kids, too."
Four years running, Stanford's
dedicated crew has won zone and re
gional championships in the English
division, with third place honors at
nationals to conclude the 2009 sea
son.
Bartsch pointed out that there is a
downside to being a one-horse-show
on the West Coast.
"We are in Zone One, which
stretches from British Columbia
down to Arizona," she noted. "Zone
Two is the state of New York."
But while travel can take a toll on
riders, many of whom will graduate
Phi Beta Kappa, Stanford's horses
avoid the travel bug. Each competi
tion features its own horses, meaning
riders who compete are saddling up
on a horse they have never worked
with.This also presents a fair playing
field for the competitors.
Stanford's talented equestrian
crew includes senior team co-presi
dent Lisa Rincon, ranked No. 13.
Adding to Stanford's competitive
team, sophomore Chris Holve fin

ished third and senior Anne Gomez
took fifth at nationals this year. All
three are primarily Western riders,
although the team's forte in the sad
dle is English.
Bartsch broke down the team's
stylistic strengths.
"Our goals for the Western team
are still quite demanding, but it's a
smaller pool of riders to choose
from," she explained. "We devel
oped 25 competitive riders from a
pool of 80 in English."
As competitive as Stanford's
team is, physical education classes,
which are open to all comers, are a
staple at the Red Barn, running sev
eral sessions a week.
One of the Card's elite riders
blossomed out of this PE program.
Now one of the premier riders in
Stanford's program, senior Alex Ja

cobs first saddled up early this sea
son, and now owns a travel spot as a
Walk-Trot rider.
The season begins in mid-Sep
tember, and carries until the nation
al finals in late April. Some start
young; others, like Jacobs, in their
senior year of college. Riding is a
sport in which 50-year-olds compete
with twenty-somethings, regardless
of gender.
"It's one of those sports you can
do for a lifetime," Bartsch remarked.
"My goal as a coach is to provide the
skills and love of riding that will last
a lifetime ... I love teaching, I love
riding, I love coming to work every
day in one of the most beautiful
barns in the country."
