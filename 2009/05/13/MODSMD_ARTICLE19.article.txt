# Greinke is unknown superstar
## 
### 
If you haven't heard the story of
Zack Greinke, you need to. It's
a story of fame, tragedy and
reconciliation, all in one. And
the kid is only 25.
He has been a phenom. a bust and
just about everything in between.
If you don't follow baseball close
ly. here is the Cliffs Notes version of
what the Kansas City Royals right
hander has done this season: In
seven starts, he is 6-1 (his lone loss
coming when he threw a complete
game four hitter, but his team lost 1 -
0) with a 0.51 ERA. He has thrown
four complete games, two complete
game shutouts, and struck out 59
while walking just eight batters.
The numbers don't describe it all
though. Greinke is doing things with
a baseball no pitcher has done be
fore. He throws % mph fastballs on
the corner, followed by 58 mph
curveballs.
He has a four-pitch repertoire
with complete command of all his
pitches, and an uncanny ability to
add and subtract on the mound as
necessary.
But despite being the best pitcher
in baseball right now, it has not al
ways been easy for Greinke.
After being a can't-miss two-way
prospect out of Apopka High School
in Florida, the Royals selected him
in the first round of the 2002 MLB
Draft. Greinke flew through the
minor leagues pitching like a man
among boys. He made his major
league debut at the age of 20 on May
22.2004.
He spent the rest of the season in
the Royals rotation, and was eventu
ally named the team's pitcher of the
year.
The next year, however, is where
it all went south.
For the first time in his life.
Greinke struggled mightily on the
field. In 2005, he went 5-17 with a
5.80 ERA. But there was more to his
troubles than mechanics or perform
ance.
In Feb. 2006. Greinke left the
Royals for personal reasons and was
diagnosed with a social anxiety dis
order and depression. Despite play
ing in a small market like Kansas
City. Greinke was overwhelmed, dis
interested and, most importantly,
tired of baseball.
This would have destroyed most
players' promise — but not
Greinke's.
He took time off from baseball,
and eventually came back to pitch in
Double-A that season — because it
was more fun — before being re
called to the majors after the Dou
ble-A season was finished.
He spent the next two seasons in
the big leagues improving, before fi
nally achieving the promise that was
predicted for him all his life this
year.
Why is this so special? Because
with the exception of maybe Josh
Hamilton (whose drug addiction
was also a mental issue, although
there were other factors in play),
such a comeback rarely occurs.
Racking my brain through all the
sports knowledge I may or may not
have. 1 cannot come up with a single
other example of a player, especially
a pitcher — as they tend to be the
biggest head cases on the field
who came back the way Greinke has.
You can't help but root for the
guy. He is a normal guy. with normal
problems. His social awkwardness
would in fact fit right in here at Stan
ford.
He's not a 'roider, he is not a
cocky jock, but instead just a guy
who speaks his mind and is master
ful at his craft.
This is not to mention how enter
taining it is to watch him pitch. He
has a boyish face, yet the mind of a
pit-bull on the mound. He doesn't
mind brushing a batter off the plate
in anticipation of buckling his knees
on the next pitch.
If you look at his stoic impression
on the mound, you'd think he is
bored — which he probably is.
I"hus he remains creative, and
makes pitching fun for himself.
Zack Greinke is a great story for
baseball, and a great story for life.
Find a way to watch him; you'll find
it both impressive and inspiring.

Let Dan Rohm know what you ilunk
of his new man-crush at hohmdi" Stan
