### MARISA LANDICHO SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
After 11 years between Meyer and Green
libraries. Moonbean's Coffee will be replaced by
Coupa ( afe by the end of June, Moonbean's Store
Manager James Rundell told The Daily yesterday.
Stanford Libraries solicited bids for the covet
ed spot between Meyer and Green, and Coupa
Cafe, which currently has an on-campus location
in the Y2E2 building, won out over Moonbean's,
the current occupant, and other bidders.
Rundell speculated that the decision was based
on reviews of the existing Coupa Cafe in Y2L2.
"I believe it was something about [Coupa]
being very popular." he said. "I feel it's odd.since
the majority of what 1 hear from customers is that
we're the most popular place on campus."
While rumors of the store's closure had circu
lated throughout year. Rundell believes this ver
dict is final.
Moonbean's pled its case to the selection

committee on Apr. 24. Libraries Director of
Communications and Development Andrew
Herkovic noted that there were "several other
bidders" for the space, but did not reveal the
identities of the other vendors.
Stanford Libraries originally intended to
announce its decision on May I. but the date was
extended to May 15 so the Library could con
duct a "site study," according to Rundell.
Moonbean's was notified that its proposal was
rejected on Monday.
Herkovic. however, was unsure if the agree
ment with Coupa Cafe was finalized.
"I believe a decision has been made, but we
are negotiating with vendors now," he said.

Reacting to the announcement, Rundell and
owner Jennie Reynolds were worried about the
future of their employees.
"We're kind of destroyed about [the deci
sion)." Rundell said, "in this economy and this
job market, it's going to be rough."
Looking to the future. Reynolds is hoping to
secure another location on campus, Rundell
said. Moonbean's Coffee is Reynolds' last
remaining coffee shop.
The Daily will have further coverage of
Moonbean's replacement in the coming days.
