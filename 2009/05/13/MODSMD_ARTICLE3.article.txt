## Endowed faculty positions face difficulty in bad economy Decline in funding puts pressure on tuition, etc. 
### ELLEN HUET STAFF WRITER 
I"he current economic recession
is expected to take a toll on the cre
ation of endowed chairs and profes
sorships, which may have a negative
impact on both faculty hiring and
the overall health of the endow
ment.
The economic downturn has
been felt across the University, espe
cially in Stanford's shrinking multi
billion-dollar endowment, which
just three years ago was the fastest
growing endowment in the nation. A
significant portion of this loss in
endowment value comes from fewer
newly created endowed chairs and
professorships.
Endowed chairs and professor
ships are positions across the
University whose salary, benefits
and occasionally other costs are paid
for by interest from a single multi
million-dollar endowment, usually
made in a donor's name. The posi

such as "The Charles Louis
Ducommun Professor in
1 lumanities and Sciences."
Stanford has several hundred
endowed positions across all seven

schools and other institutes, and
they play a vital role in the financial
health of the University The School
of Humanities & Sciences (H&S)
currently has the most endowed
positions at Stanford, and H&S
Dean Richard Sailer said these are
crucial to faculty salaries.
"The School of Humanities and
Sciences has a two billion-dollar
endowment," Sailer said. "About
half of the school's endowment
comes from endowed chairs and
professorships â€” it's by far the
bluest single source of endowment
for [H&S]."
The current economic climate,
however, is not conducive to the
large gifts required to establish
these professorships. Dean Sailer
explained that while I l&S has creat
ed 49 new endowed positions since
2001, only five were created in the
2008 fiscal year, and just one has
been created in the 2009 fiscal year
so far.
"It's too early to say for sure, but
the University is anticipating in gen
eral that donations will be lower this
year." said Stephen Hinton. senior
associate dean in the School of
H&S.
"There are fewer donors in the
current environment stepping up to
make these large gifts," Sailer
added. "With the decline in the
