## Endowed faculty positions face difficulty in bad economy Decline in funding puts pressure on tuition, etc. 
### ELLEN HUET STAFF WRITER 
I"he current economic recession
is expected to take a toll on the cre
ation of endowed chairs and profes
sorships, which may have a negative
impact on both faculty hiring and
the overall health of the endow
ment.
The economic downturn has
been felt across the University, espe
cially in Stanford's shrinking multi
billion-dollar endowment, which
just three years ago was the fastest
growing endowment in the nation. A
significant portion of this loss in
endowment value comes from fewer
newly created endowed chairs and
professorships.
Endowed chairs and professor
ships are positions across the
University whose salary, benefits
and occasionally other costs are paid
for by interest from a single multi
million-dollar endowment, usually
made in a donor's name. The posi
tions also come with faculty titles
such as "The Charles Louis
Ducommun Professor in
1 lumanities and Sciences."
Stanford has several hundred
endowed positions across all seven

schools and other institutes, and
they play a vital role in the financial
health of the University The School
of Humanities & Sciences (H&S)
currently has the most endowed
positions at Stanford, and H&S
Dean Richard Sailer said these are
crucial to faculty salaries.
"The School of Humanities and
Sciences has a two billion-dollar
endowment," Sailer said. "About
half of the school's endowment
comes from endowed chairs and
professorships — it's by far the
bluest single source of endowment
for [H&S]."
The current economic climate,
however, is not conducive to the
large gifts required to establish
these professorships. Dean Sailer
explained that while I l&S has creat
ed 49 new endowed positions since
2001, only five were created in the
2008 fiscal year, and just one has
been created in the 2009 fiscal year
so far.
"It's too early to say for sure, but
the University is anticipating in gen
eral that donations will be lower this
year." said Stephen Hinton. senior
associate dean in the School of
H&S.
"There are fewer donors in the
current environment stepping up to
make these large gifts," Sailer
added. "With the decline in the
value of the endowment as a whole,
the capital value of each endowed
chair has similarly declined, mean
ing less revenue to support faculty
salaries."
At present, a standard endow
ment to create a professorship costs
about four million dollars, and the
yearly payout — set at 5.5 percent
— helps pay costs that otherwise
would be taken out of tuition. Large
gifts can establish new endowed
positions, and when endowed facul
ty leave the University, their posi
tions are passed on to new faculty.
Provost John Etchemendy
acknowledged that a dip in the eco
nomic climate has resulted in added
pressure to the University's general
finances.
"(The economy] has not affected
existing endowed professorships,
except that, since the endowment
has declined by about 30 percent,
these professorships are paying out
that much less income to the budg
et," Etchemendy wrote in an email
to The Daily. "Since the professors
who hold those chairs still have to
be paid, the shortfall has to be cov
ered, usually by general funds (that
is, tuition)."
As a result of the financial diffi
culties, Stanford will have to
"impose serious restraints on facul
ty hiring for the next few years,"
Sailer said.
The University will also be cut
ting back on raises for existing fac
ulty.
"The gross macro effect is that
this year, there will be no salary rais
es," Sailer explained. "The endow
ment just won't pay out as much this
year as it has in the past."
Also ceasing are some additional
means to make the most of an
endowed position. In past years.cer
tain endowments have grown over

time and accumulated enough funds
to be split into two endowed posi
tions. a process called "chair-split
ting" which results in multiple posi
tions with the same name.
"I must say, in the current cli
mate, that kind of [chair-splitting] is
much less likely to be happening,"
Hinton said.
Sailer agreed that without a
growing stock market, chair-split
ting is simply "not happening."
Endowed faculty, however, are
not directly feeling the pinch.
Faculty salaries are settled inde
pendently of endowed positions, so
a drop in endowment doesn't usual
ly affect their finances, although the
title does arguably provide some
prestige.
"[Offering an endowed position]
can be one among several factors in
attracting and retaining faculty,
especially against offers from other
universities," Hinton said.
Faculty agreed that an endowed
professorship, while providing a
prestigious title, has little to no
effect on career. When asked how
an endowed position affected his
career. Political Science Prof. Joshua
Cohen replied bv email, "not at all."
"The truth is, it's not that big a
deal," said Graham H. Stuart
Professor of International Relations
Stephen Krasner. "The more
[endowed positions] there are. the
less important each one is. You
wouldn't retain a faculty member
with just the position itself —you'd
need other factors."
The opportunity for a named
endowment, however, appeals
greatly to donors and is a key factor
in soliciting large gifts for the
University.
"Stanford has arguably the best
faculty in the nation," Sailer said.
"Donors are absolutely delighted to
be associated with Stanford faculty,
and a named endowment is one way
to do that."
