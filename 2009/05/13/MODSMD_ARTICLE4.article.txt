## Office hours open on Facebook Monthly videos invite comments, questions 
### KATE BARBER STAFF WRITER 
111dsc ol us who arrived at Stanford
alter famed psychology professor
Philip Zimbardo stopped teaching can
now get a chance to hear about his
research and even ask him questions,
thanks to Stanford's new "()pen ()ffice
I louts" on l acebook.
Stanford Open Office Hours, part
of the Stanford University page on
Facebook. was created by Ian I Isu '9K
M.S. '01. Ihe online video series is
geared toward the greater Stanford
community.
For the series, a different professor
or researcher posts a video to the
Stanford University Facebook page
each month. Hie videos describe the
research topics that the professor is
currently pursuing.
Ihrough the new program, anyone
who is a "fan" of Stanford University
on I ace book can watch the videos and
ask questions by posting comments.
I Isu said he hoped Open Office
I lours would allow for more individu
alized learning 011 the Web.
"I wanted to see whether it might
be possible to bring a more intimate
and conversational learning experi
ence to a global online audience by
combining Facebook and online
video." he said.
The intended audience, however, is
still ambiguous.
"Right now. the idea is to reach to
alumni, but ultimately il may be a way
for faculty to deal with current students
who are too shy to go in|to in person
office hours)." Zimbardo said.
Zimbardo was third in the line ol
Stanford professors and researchers to
facilitate Open Office 1 lours, which
opened in March. Dr. B.J. Fogg, of the
Persuasive Technology Lab. and Dr.
Abraham Verghese, of Stanford
Medical School, hosted Office 1 lours
in March and April, respectively.
Hsu said he hopes to invite profes
sors. administrators and athletics offi
cials from across the University to par
ticipate in Stanford Open Office
Hours.
"I'd love to see about one professor
a month on an ongoing basis." I Isu
said.
Viewers can ask questions about
the videos by posting comments, and
hosts answer the most relevant ques
tions in one to two additional videos in
the following weeks.
"It's a very efficient way of commu
nicating in a brief, highly focused for
mat," Zimbardo said. "I think it's work
ing. I got 70 to 1(H) replies."

Many of these replies came from
incoming freshmen and past students,
as well as from "fans" not formally
affiliated with the University.
Hut with so many disparate users,
does posting a question that can be
read by thousands on Facebook truly
allow for an intimate academic experi
ence?
Given the large number of respons
es to each video, participating profes
sors have found it hard to respond to
everyone who posts a question.
"It's not one-to-one; it's one-to
many." Zimbardo said.
Still, he believes Open Office
I lours could be a valuable tool to allow
the I Jniversity to reach shv students or
students who are too busy for in-per
son office hours.
"I think it should be worked into
the curriculum." he said.
Dominique I.yew "12. who posted
the first response to Professor
Zimbardo's video, wasn't turned off by
the vast numbers of people who might
read her response, and believes the
main asset of Open Office I lours is
accessibility.

"I don't mind that my questions are
public: it's somehow less intimidating
than asking in private" Lyew said."By
seeing other people's responses, you
know what people have asked, so you
can build on topics and avoid being
repetitive."
Lyew also believes she is more like
ly to attend in-person office hours after
having participated in Open Office
Hours.
"I always just assumed his normal
office hours would be full of people
trying to talk to him, or that I should
not go because I'm not in any of his
classes and so 1 might not have any
thing relevant to say." Lyew said.
I Isu agreed that one of the goals of
Stanford Open Office Hours is to
allow students and other Facebook
users to interact with academics they
otherwise would not.
"I never took a class from Professor
Zimbardo when I was a student at
Stanford, and I've always regretted
that." Hsu said. "In a way. I'm making
up for lost time.and I'm simply inviting
others to the party"
Zimbardo has not yet posted his

response video, but plans to have it up
sometime next week.
"Next time, I will answer questions.
I printed out 70 and will touch on the
most interesting ones," he said. "Some
asked about time perspective, some
about shyness and some people just
love the pocket pal."
The "pocket pal" refers to the small
puppet Zimbardo used as a prop in his
Facebook video.
"It was just by chance I had it on the
table," Zimbardo said. "A college stu
dent from another school who was a
fan of mine had crcx-heted it for me."
