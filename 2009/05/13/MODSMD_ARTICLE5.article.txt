### EMMA TROTTER MANAGING EDITOR 
C.' ur morality is not for
j sale," wrote Karin
1 Morin in "Caveat
% m Parens: One family's
adventures in gender
neutral housing," published in The
National Review on Monday of last
week.
In the article. Karin, mother of Daisy
Morin '09, condemned the lack of trans
parency surrounding Stanford's gender
neutral housing pilot program, instituted
this year.
"Stanford's actions created not one
but two problems of institutional ethics."
Karin wrote in the article.The University,
she said, failed to inform parents of both
the changes in housing policy and. il par
ents did manage to track down online
information about the policy, the extent
of those changes.
Student's felt that Karin's claims were
out of line.
"In general. Stanford has no responsi
bility to inform parents about anything,"
argued James Barton '09. citing the fact
that the vast majority of Stanford stu
dents are at least IS years old and thus
legal adults. "Parents just need to learn to
let go. Their children are responsible
adults at this point."
"We're adults, so we have the right to
make the decision, but for a lot of people,
we are financially reliant on our parents."
agreed Lisa Tang '11. who shares a two
room. gender-neutral double in Castano
with Vasilly Sharikov-Bass '11. a close
male friend. "It comes down to talking to
your parents about it."
"I know that my mom was originally
completely against it, of course," she
admitted, "but I mean. I showed her the
room and said 'I ook, the door's closed, it
turns into a single. I promise there's noth
ing going on between me and the guy;
we're really good friends." And eventual
ly. she agreed, even though, originally, she
was kind of a conservative Chinese
mom."
"The level of information Stanford
provides to parents is already quite
extensive." Barton added. "And parents

can read The Daily online il they want to
keep abreast of what's going on. 1 vers
step of the gender-neutral housing
process was documented in The Daily."
Additionally, Assistant Vice Provost
and Director of Residential Fducation
(ResEd) Deborah Golder s;iid that
Stanford's online descriptions of gender
neutral housing practices had been
updated to reflect recent changes "long
before this became national news."
Karin's grievances also conflated
University-wide Housing policy with co
op policy, according to Golder.
"The mixed-gender housing policies
function distinctly from the co-ops." she
wrote in an email to The Daily "As I
understand it.the consensus decision
making process at Synergy and
Columbae, as well as the mixed-gender
room assignments, have been practiced
for decades."
Karin went on to say in her National
Review piece that her daughter was not
happy with her co-ed room assignment in
Columbae. During a seven-hour housing
meeting that relied on consensus deci
sion-making. Daisy was assigned to a
large, one-room quad with one other girl

and two boys.
Dais\ was not present at the meeting,
but had appointed another student as
prow who was clear on all of her prefer
encesâ€” which did not include stipula
tions about the gender of her roommates.
"I would have been fine one way or
the other." Daisy said in an interview
with I he Daily. She lived in co-ed rooms
during both fall and winter quarters, and
now she lives in a single-gender room.
Daisy called the issue "a family argu
ment." saying that Stanford Housing and
Residential Fducation (ResFd) were not
to blame at all.
She did have issues with I he National
Review, however.
"I think it's irresponsible of them that
the) didn't contact anyone besides m\
mom." Dais) said. "It took something
that was a private family argument and
tried to turn it into something political,
which it just wasn't."
I);ns\ said she's had a good experi
ence in ( olumbae so far.
"People have been reall\ supportive,"
she said.
