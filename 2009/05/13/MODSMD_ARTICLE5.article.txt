## Gender-neutral room assignments in national spotlight after mother criticizes Housing en-genders debate 
### EMMA TROTTER MANAGING EDITOR 
C.' ur morality is not for
j sale," wrote Karin
1 Morin in "Caveat
% m Parens: One family's
adventures in gender
neutral housing," published in The
National Review on Monday of last
week.
In the article. Karin, mother of Daisy
Morin '09, condemned the lack of trans
parency surrounding Stanford's gender
neutral housing pilot program, instituted
this year.
"Stanford's actions created not one
but two problems of institutional ethics."
Karin wrote in the article.The University,
she said, failed to inform parents of both
the changes in housing policy and. il par
ents did manage to track down online
information about the policy, the extent
of those changes.
Student's felt that Karin's claims were
out of line.
"In general. Stanford has no responsi
bility to inform parents about anything,"
argued James Barton '09. citing the fact
that the vast majority of Stanford stu
dents are at least IS years old and thus
legal adults. "Parents just need to learn to
let go. Their children are responsible
adults at this point."
"We're adults, so we have the right to
make the decision, but for a lot of people,
we are financially reliant on our parents."
agreed Lisa Tang '11. who shares a two
room. gender-neutral double in Castano
with Vasilly Sharikov-Bass '11. a close
male friend. "It comes down to talking to
your parents about it."
"I know that my mom was originally
completely against it, of course," she
admitted, "but I mean. I showed her the
room and said 'I ook, the door's closed, it
turns into a single. I promise there's noth
ing going on between me and the guy;
we're really good friends." And eventual
ly. she agreed, even though, originally, she
was kind of a conservative Chinese
mom."
"The level of information Stanford
provides to parents is already quite
extensive." Barton added. "And parents

can read The Daily online il they want to
keep abreast of what's going on. 1 vers
step of the gender-neutral housing
process was documented in The Daily."
Additionally, Assistant Vice Provost
and Director of Residential Fducation
(ResEd) Deborah Golder s;iid that
Stanford's online descriptions of gender
neutral housing practices had been
updated to reflect recent changes "long
before this became national news."
Karin's grievances also conflated
University-wide Housing policy with co
op policy, according to Golder.
"The mixed-gender housing policies
function distinctly from the co-ops." she
wrote in an email to The Daily "As I
understand it.the consensus decision
making process at Synergy and
Columbae, as well as the mixed-gender
room assignments, have been practiced
for decades."
Karin went on to say in her National
Review piece that her daughter was not
happy with her co-ed room assignment in
Columbae. During a seven-hour housing
meeting that relied on consensus deci
sion-making. Daisy was assigned to a
large, one-room quad with one other girl

and two boys.
Dais\ was not present at the meeting,
but had appointed another student as
prow who was clear on all of her prefer
ences— which did not include stipula
tions about the gender of her roommates.
"I would have been fine one way or
the other." Daisy said in an interview
with I he Daily. She lived in co-ed rooms
during both fall and winter quarters, and
now she lives in a single-gender room.
Daisy called the issue "a family argu
ment." saying that Stanford Housing and
Residential Fducation (ResFd) were not
to blame at all.
She did have issues with I he National
Review, however.
"I think it's irresponsible of them that
the) didn't contact anyone besides m\
mom." Dais) said. "It took something
that was a private family argument and
tried to turn it into something political,
which it just wasn't."
I);ns\ said she's had a good experi
ence in ( olumbae so far.
"People have been reall\ supportive,"
she said.


ARNAV MOUDGIL/The Stanford Daily
Columbae, a gender-neutral co-op, came under fire recently for its practices in a
National Review piece by Karin Morin, mother of Daisy Morin '09.
The National Review article itself
and the issues it raised spread across
the Stanford campus last week, and
sparked a New York Times blog entry
on Wednesday entitled "The C hoice."
The post received so many comments
including statements from both
Daisy and Karin Morin — th.it a sec
ond blog entry went up later the same
day.
In her comment, which was similar
to an email she sent to the Columbae
list. Daisy asserted that she is happy
with her room assignment and said
that Stanford acted immediately to
address the situation.
"This conflict has very little to do
with Stanford and gender-neutral
housing." she wrote. "It has every
thing to do with my parents having a
hard time adjusting to the fact that
I'm out of the house (I'm the oldest).
I'm 3,(KM) miles away.and — especial

ly— that I'm a liberal agnostic while
they are conservative Catholics."
Karin. meanwhile, contends that
her family issue was a newsworthy
event.
"For me. the point of writing
about what happened to our family
is to help other parents know what
questions to ask and what discus
sions to initiate." she wrote in a com
ment on the New York limes blog
post.
In The National Review. Karin
expressed concern for her daugh
ter's safety in the close company of
at least one male student who drinks
and about the immorality of sharing a
sleeping space with a member of the
opposite sex before marriage.
Sharikov-Bass agreed in part with
Karin's statements.
"Girls should not live with any
random people," he said. "If you go
into gender-neutral [housing], it
should be with someone you know.
It's a matter of personal security."
As for the worst fear in such a sit
uation with male and female
strangers — rape — Sharikov-Bass

wasn't concerned.
"I don't see it being likely to hap
pen." he said.
Barton agreed.
"Parents should he more worried
about the guy down the hall that their
daughter drunkenly made out with at
a party two weeks ago." he said.
"It comes down to the girl actually
trying to use her brain and seeing
what kind of guy she's rooming with,"
Tang added. "Even it you're not
rooming with a gender-neutral and
you're being really dumb and drunk,
there are always issues that could
possibly show up. so be smart about it
and it should be ok."
Overall, Sharikov-Bass saw few
differences between traditional same
gender housing and gender-neutral
housing.
"It's more like having a sister who
lives in the same house as you." he
said. "There is a different type of
interaction, but it's not drastically dif
ferent from living with a male room
mate."
Tang expressed similar feelings.
"It's actually pretty simple

because if I have the door closed, it's
like I have a single," she said. "If I
open the door, it's like a double."
"The main difference is actually
just how other people see it." she
admitted. "Everyone will pause and
be like. 'What, you're living with a
guy?' I mean, it's not drastically dif
ferent because I don't normally walk
around naked anyway. Plus, there are
not weird tensions with my room
mate, so it's chill."
When Sharikov-Bass told his par
ents in Yekaterinburg, Russia about
his choice to live with Tang, he said
that initially they were slightly con
cerned and surprised, but not outright
against the idea.
I"hey were concerned with my
security more than anything else, and
I hey were just trying to make sure
this was the best decision for me," he
said.
"Since I don't think that gender
neutral [housing] is such a big issue, 1
don't feel like parents should have a
say in it,"he added.
The Morins felt quite differently,
however. Karin and her husband cut

off payments for Daisy's spring-quar
ter tuition, forcing their daughter to
take out an additional $3.(XX) in stu
dent loans in order to remain at
Stanford.
"I could talk about conspiracy the
ories, and how the modern university
is trying to change society's norms."
said Karin's National Review piece.
"I could talk about how the universi
ty caters to the edgy' — whatever
that is at the moment."
While Daisy's parents did not wish
to make any further comment to the
press. Director of Housing
Assignments Sue Nunan clarified the
University's stance on gender-neutral
housing.
"The gender-neutral housing poli
cies were determined by a diverse
committee that met last year with
input from many sources," she wrote
in an email to The Daily. "We also
researched and spoke with many
other universities about their gender
neutral housing policies before final
izing our recommendations."
Nunan added that the program
has worked "very well" this year and

is being expanded to include more
locations next year.
Golder pointed to the increased
degree of choice that the co-op living
situation brings to Stanford's housing
options.
"The diversity of living experi
ences in the residences at Stanford is
a point of pride and reflects the
breadth of opportunities that our stu
dents seek." she said. "Ilie co-ops are
a critical piece of residential life at
Stanford."
"And unless there is reason to
believe that harm is coming to a stu
dent— something that would com
promise health, safety or community
— we will work to honor the culture
and traditions of those houses." she
continued."ln this case, our conversa
tions with our student indicated that
she was fine and she had no interest
in changing her room."
