Secretary."

schedule as the Rathbun Visiting 112 ellow. Shult/ attended
various receptions across campus on a diverse array of
topics, including life in public service, the role ot sports in
life and how to prepare lor and balance multiple profes
sions.
The dinner, however, was not all policy Shult/ joked
with the students present. When asked b\ a student how
he gets out of bed in the morning and remains motivated.
Shult/ had a simple explanation.
"I swing my legs over and push." Shult/ deadpanned.
"It's a little easier that way."
Most of the student questions revolved around how to
interact with others and deal with situations of conflict.
One student questioned whether on occasion during his
time as a public servant. Shult/'s personal opinions or
moral values conflicted with written laws In response.

Protestors stood outside Wilbur Dining during
Condoleezza Rice and George Schultz's visit for a din
ner discussion with 70 students. The protestors had lit
tle effect, however, upon the night's proceedings.
Shultz relayed a story of how lie
objected to the State Departments
policy of using lie detector tests for its
employees as a matter of principle. I le
argued that it was better to begin rela
tionships on trust rather than fear.
"I think you have to stick with your
values." Shultz said. "If you wind up
with something you think violates
that, you have to be ready to leave.
These jobs are wonderful; it's a great
opportunity to represent your country.
But you can't want the job too much,
otherwise vou may do things you don't
like."
Rice tended to agree and framed
the global war against terrorism in
moral terms, recalling that the Taliban
often employs tactics of embedding its
terrorists in civilian apartment build
ings. She also recalled meeting raped
and battered women in Darfur, but
said that the government was unable
to assuage the situation.
"If ever you feel that you're doing
something that compromises your
moral values, don't do it." Rice said.
"Sometimes you have a clear-cut case
where somebody has asked you to do
something that is clearly against you
moral compass — don't do it. More
often, we face moral dilemmas and the
answers are not clear."
Rice also pressed Shult/ on the
similarities between global politics and
domestic life and questioned whether
Shultz's policy of tending to and "gar
dening" relationships was applicable
on the micro level.

"If you plant a garden and then go
away and come back in six months,
you've got weeds." Shultz said. "So if
you're any kind of a gardener, and you
garden regularly — you water, you get
the weeds out when they're small
then you've got a good garden.
"I think a lot of it is true in terms of
human relationships and certainly in
the arena of diplomacy," he continued.
"You have to pay attention and listen

to people when nothing much is going
on — you just get to know them.Then,
when something starts happening that
has a lot of stress in it, you've built a
relationship and you can he candid
with each other."
Shultz continued by emphasizing
the value of education. I !e pointed out
that he had been involved with univer
sities continuously ever since he joined
the MIT faculty after serving as a
marine in World War 11.
" Hie University is the world of
ideas." he said. "In some of these gov
ernment positions, or in business, most
of the people don't have lots of ideas.
If there's a thread connecting my life,
it's having some root in the work! of
ideas."
Rice's presence at the event drew
the extra scrutiny that has accompa
nied her visits to student residences
recently.
Just last week, several dozen alum
ni and current students marched to the
University President's office and
nailed an informal indictment against
the former Secretary of State, urging
legal authorities to investigate and
prosecute Rice.
Outside the dining hall, a group of
protestors, including one student
dressed in orange prison garb bearing
a "Say No to War" sign, demonstrated

against Rice's appearance.
Two weeks ago, the national
media was abuzz with commentary
about a conversation — recorded
and posted on You Tube — between
Rice and an undergraduate during a
dinner at Roble Hall. This time. Rice
did not engage in any unstructured
conversations with students.
Electronic devices, including cameras
and tape recorders, were strictly pro
hibited from the venue.
I lowever. there were limited num
bers of protesters at the Wilbur event.
While there were students dressed up
as mock torture subjects and prison
ers. their impact on the event was
minimal. At the dinner, students were
generally respectful of both Shultz
and Rice and stuck to the event's stat
ed purpose, refraining from question
ing the former public servants about
controversial topics such as torture.
Shultz ended with some parting
wisdom for the students.
"I have learned in all sorts of ways
that you better learn how to listen." he
said."Because, when you listen.you're
going to learn something. If you
always have your mouth open, you
don't learn anything."
