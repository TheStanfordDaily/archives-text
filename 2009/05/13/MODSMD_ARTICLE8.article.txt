## ASSASSIN V.S. ASSASSIN "OUR CLIENTS REQUIRE A CERTAIN PEER OF YOURS ELIMINATED..." CRS BAUTSTA GRAPHICS 
### BY CAROLINE CASELLI CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
(*)
n Monday. Apr. 21 at
exactly 12:52 p.m., this
sinister message filled
the inboxes of 71
Roble residents. Hie email marked the
beginning of Assassins, Stanford's annu
al dorm tradition of anxiety, strategy,
paranoia and craftiness.
Within minutes. Assassins fever had
swept Roble Hall. Literally. Ken kansky
"12 wasted no time scoring his first "kill,"
knocking off his target a mere seven
minutes into the game.
"I was walking to class, and she hap
pened to be right in front of me." he
recounted with a chuckle. "I didn't even
have a gun at that point, so I ran back to
my room, grabbed my roommate's gun

and shot her. I had just found out my assignment."
And this was just the beginning of the mayhem. Soon, serious Assassins strategy
ensued.
"The most important thing is having a spy." said Julio Alvarado '12. Roble's reigning
Assassins champion, explaining the tactics he employed to ensure his eventual victory.
"And covering your tracks, like doing things differently, skipping class, making use of all
entrances into your room. And luck. I had a lot of luck."
Secret alliances were formed amongst residents. Door signs were switched to make
players more difficult to find. Sitting for hours in the dirt underneath the stairs to Roble's
side door became a socially acceptable behavior.
"It was like 1 a.m.." laughed Simon Ye '12. recalling his involvement in a friend's par-

ticularly persistent assassination attempt.

"Deniz [Kahramaner '12] knew that his

target was an upperclassman in the 3-

Center hall, so he decided to stake
him out in the bathroom."

But someone was taking a
shower inside. Ye decided to

leave, but Kahramaner waited
inside a bathroom stall, not

even knowing whether or not
the guy showering was his tar-

get.
"Deniz and the guy don't
know who each other are. so
they're just waiting," Ye con
tinued. "The guy taking the
shower gets scared, so he

stays in there for 30 minutes.
After he turns off the water.

he just stands in the shower
stall for another 15 minutes,
waiting."

Ilien, Kahramaner put on

a ski mask and opened the door.
But it wasn't his target.

The Web site also features two pages of official Assassins rules: The assassination must
occur within 24 hours of the email assignment. It cannot be witnessed by anyone else.
Certain safe zones — bathrooms, your own room, classrooms and the dining hall during
meal hours — exist to ensure some sense of normalcy.
"It would be really weird if people followed you into the bathroom," laughed Nicole
DeVille '12."Although I don't think the dining hall should have been a safe zone. It would
make the game more interesting. People would be even more paranoid."
In addition to assassinating, a player may "neutralize" a suspected assassin by shooting
someone that is potentially assigned to him or her. When neutralized, the player cannot
kill anyone for 120 minutes.
"I was neutralized like six times," Ye said. "Its too easy to take advantage of the neu
tralization rules because the only way you can protect yourself is by hiding yourself in your
room and locking your door. It's annoying."
Along with the regular assassins, there are also "terminators."The terminators'job is to
get rid of participants who have not assassinated their targets within the 24-hour window,
as well as players who fail to report their kill instantly. Unlike the regular assassins, the no
witness rule does not apply to the terminators, and they cannot be neutralized.
"I preferred being a terminator because I got to shoot people with water guns without
being paranoid about someone coming behind my back and shooting me," explained Aaron
Lewis *12, one of the leading terminators in Roble's game. "I got to have the power, the
authority."
While Assassins engrossed many students, some players were fairly apathetic toward the
game. Others forewent Assassins altogether.
"I signed up for the game thinking that 1 would be really involved." said Disney Williams
"12. "But when it came down to it, I was too lazy to go upstairs and pick up the squirt gun."
Yet for the students who did immerse themselves in the game. Assassins provided a four
day flurry of excitement and adventure — a welcome respite from the daily grind of classes,
schoolwork and activities.
"I almost lost friends," Alvarado laughed, reflecting upon his Assassins experience. "But
I got like five free water pistols. And pride. Yeah, that's pretty much it. Bragging rights. Like,
I am the sneakiest."

Ridiculous as they may seem, tales like these
are almost standard as the game nears its end.
leaving only the most dedicated and elusive
assassins still standing.

Other kills from this year's game
are anonymously storied on www.the
happyzork.com, a Web site set up by a
former Stanford Resident Computer
Consultant (RCC) that also serves to
coordinate the game.
Some of the accounts are concise.
"Epic game of cat and mouse. Cat
went home full."
Others are more detailed.
"She was in the dining hall (after it
had closed), when I spotted her and
quickly made my way to the table, and
poked my pistol into her back, busted a
fat load (of water), and then burst into
euphoria. Pretty average day, actually."
And then others are ... nostalgic?
Funny? Just weird?
"It is nice getting killed by a good

friend, instead of some random person .
.. I feel like lam Tom I lanks in the ending scene of Saving Private Ryan."
The Web site also features two pages of official Assassins rules: The assassination must
occur within 24 hours of the email assignment. It cannot be witnessed by anyone else.
Certain safe zones — bathrooms, your own room, classrooms and the dining hall during
meal hours — exist to ensure some sense of normalcy.
"It would be really weird if people followed you into the bathroom," laughed Nicole
DeVille '12."Although I don't think the dining hall should have been a safe zone. It would
make the game more interesting. People would be even more paranoid."
In addition to assassinating, a player may "neutralize" a suspected assassin by shooting
someone that is potentially assigned to him or her. When neutralized, the player cannot
kill anyone for 120 minutes.
"I was neutralized like six times," Ye said. "Its too easy to take advantage of the neu
tralization rules because the only way you can protect yourself is by hiding yourself in your
room and locking your door. It's annoying."
Along with the regular assassins, there are also "terminators."The terminators'job is to
get rid of participants who have not assassinated their targets within the 24-hour window,
as well as players who fail to report their kill instantly. Unlike the regular assassins, the no
witness rule does not apply to the terminators, and they cannot be neutralized.
"I preferred being a terminator because I got to shoot people with water guns without
being paranoid about someone coming behind my back and shooting me," explained Aaron
Lewis *12, one of the leading terminators in Roble's game. "I got to have the power, the
authority."
While Assassins engrossed many students, some players were fairly apathetic toward the
game. Others forewent Assassins altogether.
"I signed up for the game thinking that 1 would be really involved." said Disney Williams
"12. "But when it came down to it, I was too lazy to go upstairs and pick up the squirt gun."
Yet for the students who did immerse themselves in the game. Assassins provided a four
day flurry of excitement and adventure — a welcome respite from the daily grind of classes,
schoolwork and activities.
"I almost lost friends," Alvarado laughed, reflecting upon his Assassins experience. "But
I got like five free water pistols. And pride. Yeah, that's pretty much it. Bragging rights. Like,
I am the sneakiest."
