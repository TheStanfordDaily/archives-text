## On bootstraps, and picking yourself up by them 
### 
I t couldn't have been a more perfect plan,
and what was more, she would be a part
of it. I hadn't even thought to ask her to
be my senior formal date until a few weeks
before — 1 had thought I would be too busy
to even go. for a time — but when she said
she was coming. I couldn't have been more
thrilled.
On Friday, I would pick up my senior for
mal date from the airport at 7:30 after she
got in from Minneapolis (to quote Jack
Nicholson, "On my nickel, of course"), and
take her straight to my favorite restaurant in
San Francisco. The Slanted Door, where I
had made reservations. We would walk lazi
ly down the Fmbarcadero on a warm city
evening (the forecast for San Francisco over
the weekend: Friday - 70 degrees; Saturday -
70 degrees: Sunday - 70 degrees), with the
Bay Bridge and water to our right, and the
spectacle of dow ntow n to our left.
On Saturday. I would show her around
Stanford, and San Francisco again, visiting
all my favorite spots, all the places where I
grew up — The Grove on Fillmore.The Le
gion of Honor, Crissy Field. She would see
my home, my childhood, my life for the first
time through my eyes.
On Sunday, we would wake up and head
back down the Peninsula to my parent's
home, where she would meet my folks, and
we would take in a warm, relaxing Mothers
Day. I would take her to the airport and wish
her goodbye,and thus would end the perfect
weekend. I had it all planned, down to the
smallest detail.
And in between, we would go together to
senior formal at mv home awav from home.
AT&T Park.
Well. Thursday night came, two nights
before formal and less than 24 hours before
she was to arrive. A number that I did not
recognize showed up on my phone. I reject
ed it at first (1 was with my buddy Daniel,
and Vice was playing at the Col 10. dammit!)
but soon enough, the number was calling

again.
I answered.The person on the other line,
a friend of my would-be date, began to
speak. She might as well have picked up a
wrench and heaved it directly into my
phone, and weekend.
Something had come up. she told me — a
personal family issue — and my date would
not be coming. Her excuse was legitimate,
and I knew it was real. I walked silently back
into the Col 10, stunned.
Try as I might over the next few days or
so. I could not change her mind. I never once
even reached her by phone, but her friend
confirmed what she had already said the
night before. That evening, my date's flight
landed in San Francisco, and she was not on
it.
l"his is not the first time plans have gone
awry in my life. ;yid it certainly won't be the
last. My biggest tear when these things hap
pen to me is that they will turn me from the
idealist that I want to be. into the depressed
cynic I fear I may become. The former has
the ability to empower: the latter, the power
to paralyze. As I sat at the Suites Carnival
dinner on Friday night, resignedly explain
ing what had happened to my date — know
ing that I ought to be instead spending the
evening with her in San Francisco and
sighing over the injustice of it all. 1 felt that
paralysis sweeping over me.
One thing was for sure: Between my feel
ing sorry for myself and worrying about my
former date, there was no way I wanted to
go to senior formal anymore. I would sit in
my room, perhaps write a bit, perhaps strum
a guitar. But, I simply did not have it in me
to go.
Sometimes, the miracle of an enlighten
ing thought comes from life's situations:
other times, it arrives seemingly out of thin
air: and sometimes, it's a combination of
both. For whatever reason, as I sat silently
on Friday night, a light switch turned on in
mv head

These times when we're dealt a crappy
hand, and we suffer for it — even despite
our best efforts — is life. But even given all
that is out of our hands, so much more is
within them.
Our lives are not movies. There are no
scripts, no do-overs. In their stead are. on
one hand, w hat we should have done; and on
the other hand, knowing what we need to
do. and letting ourselves do it. On the one
hand, the unbearable pain of regret; on the
other, the light of truly living. In each mo
ment. the choice rests with no one else but
ourselves. It took a few hours, and the sup
port of many friends, to experience this
thought, but when I did. I knew it was ir
refutable.
So there it was. I thought to myself: I had
been dealt a crappy hand. It was no less than
that, but alas.it was also no more.The ques
tion was: What was I going to do about it?
Would I let it keep me down, or would I say
to myself. "Screw it. let's see if you can have
a good time"?
And so. 1 woke up on Saturday morning,
and I got Facebook a-messagin'. And soon
enough, a very understanding, very wonder
ful, very good friend had agreed to come
with me to senior formal. I am deeply in
debted to her. When Saturday night rolled
around. I was headed to San Francisco.
Could I have been a better date? You bet.
Did I get totally hammered? Sure did. (The
closest I came to making out on Saturday
night was with a toilet). But hey, life isn't
perfect, and both I and my date had friends
there.The important thing isn't whether life
imitates art; it is that we understand that it
does not always, but we can find ways to be
happy with it anyway.
At the very least, the next time bad luck
rears its ugly head at me, I'll know where my
bootstraps are.
