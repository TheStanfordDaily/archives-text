GAME NOTES.' Stanford is looking to advance to
the NCAA Championships for the third
consecutive time. Cardinal sophomore Steve
Ziegler is currently ranked No. 12 in the nation
and averages |ust 72 3 strokes per round.
Stanford must finish in the top five at Ihe Re
gional in order to advance.

In addition to the normal jockey
ing for the individual crown.Cardinal
golfers will have to compete against
10extra individuals from universities
that did not qualify a team/Ihe top
finisher among the 10 extra golfers
will also qualify for the NCAA
( hampionship.
As per program history, Stanford
again showcases itself as one of the
deepest teams in the tournament.
The Cardinal will rely heavily on
Ziegler; the sophomore has been
helpful to the team, firing the lowest
average strokes per round (72.3), the
lowest tournament total (202 at Stan
ford's own U.S. Intercollegiate), the
lowest round (65 strokes),and conse
quently, winning top individual honors
in the Ashworth Collegiate Champi
onship. all while carding eight top-25
finishes in 10 tournaments.
Other top performing Stanford
golfers include Chung. Kemmer and
Kim; each has participated in all 10
tournaments this year. The second
highest ranking Cardinal golfer is
Chung, lie has the second-lowest
stroke average (73.17) and has earned
five top-25 finishes; his best finish was at
the U.S. Collegiate Championship,
where he placed third.
Senior captain Dodge Kemmer
has also been a heavy contributor to
Stanford's performance this past sea
son. Kemmer also has five top-25 fin
ishes and is in a tie for the second-low
est round on the team (67 strokes).
Going into his last NCAA Champi
onship run, Lim scored his lowest fin
ish of the season in the Pacific 10 Con
ference Championship, finishing in a
tie for 16th.
"Our depth will definitely help us
out. but it's a very difficult course." Ray
said of the UT Golf Club. "We had a
good practice round [yesterday], but
this course is going to require a bunch
of guys to do their best to eliminate big
numbers each round. You never know
when you have to play three days of
golf. We're going to play our best and
hope for a good result."
The ('ardinal's final line for the sea
son includes nine top-five finishes (with

one team win) and only one eighth
place finish among the 10 tournaments
played.
"All five of our guys have con
tributed a lot — thats why they're
here." Ray said. "This course is not just
about the short game and putting, but
also requires golfers to hit well. We're
going to rely on our ball striking and
making good choices to keep our
scores down."
At last year's regional tournament
in Washington. Stanford was able to
qualify for the NCAA Championships
by coming in sixth with a 14-over-par
878. Though Stanford came in sixth, it
came up one stroke short of the nation
al title, taking the runner-up spot in the
NCAA Championship, behind the
UCI.A Bruins. Stanford was the
NCAA ( hampion just one year before
in 2(X)7. With such a rich recent history,
the Stanford men have high expecta
tions going into today's qualifying tour
nament.
"We should have some nerves be
cause we've worked so hard this sea
son for the chance to be in the
NCAAs, but 1 always tell the guys to
focus those emotions into something
they can control, specifically their
score." Ray said."l tell them to accept
their nerves and move on. Many of
