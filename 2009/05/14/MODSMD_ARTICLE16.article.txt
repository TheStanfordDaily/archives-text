# The 						NBA's deep dark secret
## 
### 
When I was in the sixth
grade, I had a huge erush
on two things: sports and
this girl in my geography
class. I thought she was smart and gor
geous,and I always tried to get her atten
tion whenever I could. I just knew in my
heart that this was my future wife.
But everything changed when one
day, during a qui/ on the state capitals. I
saw her peeking at the answers on an
other student's paper. Hie woman I
loved had committed an act so egre
gious that our certain destiny of connu
bial bliss was shattered right before my
eyes.
Seven years later, this girl's twin is
back in my life, causing me just as much
heartbreak. No. she's not another
blonde bombshell. She's the NBA.
The NBA is cheating on me.
I have been in love with the Associa
tion for as long as I can remember. I
grew up watching Michael Jordan
square off with Stockton and Malone,
making fun of the way Detlef
Schrempfs name was pronounced, and
praying that one time, before I had to get
a real job, the Magic would win a title.
I put more effort into my relation
ship with the NBA than the Lohans
did with their kids. I )avid Stern was my
unofficial godfather, someone who
would never let me down no matter
how bad things got. Hie NBA and I
were living high,our union as strong as
ever. Ilien Tim Donaghy smacked us
both in the face.
'ITie official who rigged many of the
most important games of the last decade
had tarnished the reputation of the
league. 1 was pissed and confused, but I
truly felt as if this was just a warning, that
the NBA had nothingtodo with thisand
that everything would be back to nor
mal for the next season. Livery relation
ship has its bumps, right?
Wrong. I he nightmare never ended.
Conspiracy theorists came stampeding
into my life, proposing the ludicrous
idea that the NBA was staged, using its
officials to fix the outcomes of games.
Sure. I knew it was a business, but a
mullibillion dollar enterprise could
never keep a secret this big â€” or so I
thought.
The 2(XW Playoffs have me jumping
aboard the conspiracy train.The games
have been plagued by the worst officiat
ing since, well, last year's playoffs. I can
not recall a time in my life when so many
players have been assessed flagrant
fouls, lined and suspended. We are only
midway through the second round, yet
the NBA has already dealt out over
1 (X),(MM) dollars in lines and shelved
three players for at least one game
apiece.
I larsh officiating is one thing. Incon
sistent officiating is in a league of its own.
ITie NBA is blatantly favoring big-mar
ket teams, choosing to give preferential
treatment to those teams most likely to
generate the most money the ('cities
and the I .akers. Not sold?
Magic p< )int guard Rafer"Skip t< > mv
Lou" Alston was suspended one game
for slapping I ddie I louse in the back of
the head like any of us have slapped a
sibling. I ddie threw a low elbow, and
Skip wasn't having it. Sure, Rafer knows
better, and should have kept his hands
to himself.
But what il I told you that just about
one week earlier.a Boston guard had in
tentionallv thrown an opposing player
into the scorer's table.only to then thrt >w
a forearm/elbow to face of the same
player when he naturally retaliated,and
was not suspended? What il I went on to
say that the same player had received no
punishment for punching an opposing
player in the face in one of the most im
portant moments of one of the greatest
first-round series ever? You would be
lieve an O.J. Simpson excuse in court
over my story.
Jusi ask that Boston guard. Rajon
Rondo, how he feels about the NBAs
decision making. Sure. I really don't like
the ( cities. Iliey are about to knock my
favorite team out of the playoffs, and
have broken my heart for nearly two
weeks. But I don't loathe Boston; I
loathe inconsistency and favoritism at
the highest levels of athletic competi
tion. I loathe betrayal and ignorance. I
loathe NBA officiating.
I "m not sure what is happening in the
NBA front offices. Hie fan relations de
partment is probably receiving hate
mail by the truckload. while Stern is lick
mg his chops over the possibilities of a
Kobe vs. Lebron, or Lakers vs. Celtics


Zath
Zimmerman
Dishing the Rock
matchup. I am not one to believe in a
conspiracy theory, but the league has
left me no choice.
And like that girl in sixth grade, the
NBA is cheating, and it is breaking my
heart.

/mil Zimmerman is ready to throw
'bows at Stern and crew. Hold liim hack
