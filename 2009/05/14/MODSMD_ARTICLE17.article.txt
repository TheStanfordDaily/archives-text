that of a Stanford student and star
track and field athlete.The top 4(H)-
meter hurdler on campus, freshman

Amaechi Morton
recently broke the
38-year-old Stan
ford record, set hy
Randy White, with
his time of 50.11 sec
onds.
Transitioning
from high school to
the highly competi
tive collegiate arena
has been challeng
ing yet rewarding
for Morton.
"I didn't really
have to go out so
hard in high
school." he said. "I
was one of the top
athletes and could
just cruise if 1 want
ed to."
However, col
lege has forced the
Cardinal freshman
to push himself to a
new level.
"I have to press

the whole entire race: there's no
room to hold hack."
ITie collegiate workouts them
selves have not been too different
for the Georgia native, although he
claims that Palo Alto is too cold.
"I'll show up to practice in four
layers with a hat and gloves, and
people will he walking around in
shorts and flip-flops," he said.
He does admit that the weights
have been difficult, as his high
school program did not focus on
lifting whatsoever.
"I came from a high school
where 1 lilted no weights, and being
put into a lifting environment. I felt
weak." Morton said.
Aside from the workouts. Mor
ton feels a bond with his teammates
as well as coaches. In particular.
Morton cites senior team captain
Myles Bradley as an inspirational
runner.

"I am more
aware and
confident
in my
running"

MORTON

"He has an incredible dedication
to the sport — he's always motiva
tional and hard working," Morton
said. "Not to mention his hurdling
form is on point."
Aside from being content with
the team. Morton admitted that, on
a social level. Stanford lacks the vi
brancy and spark of Atlanta. Al
though he occasionally ventures
out, he finds

himself sleep
ing and resting
more often,
which definite
ly bodes well
for his training
and perform
ance.
Amid
the Stanford
coursework,
Morton has
been able to
give his time,
passion and en
ergy to the
track, which has
paid off tremen
dously. Current
ly ranked No. 5
in the nation for
the 400-meter
hurdles, Morton
is looking to
move up in the
rankings in the
coming weeks.
With regard to

his national competition. Morton
does not feel like there is a signifi
cant frontrunner.and believes he has
a shot at a national title.
"1 feel like I have a good
chance," Morton said."l just have to
focus, and if everything comes to
gether. I feel like I can do it. It's def
initely not something out of my
reach.There are just things to work
on in order to get there."
As with most top athletes. Mor
ton says there are numerous ways in
which he can improve.
"The main things would be to get
more comfortable with the race, be
more aggressive and improve my
actual hurdling technique," he said.
The next few weeks will prove
challenging and strenuous for the
young runner, as he will compete at
the Pac-10 Championships and
then the NCAA Regional Champi
onships. His goal for each of these

meets is to win the 400-meter hur
dle title, secure some points for the
team and improve his own time. Top
five in each event at the regional
meet will advance to the NCAA
National Championship.
Morton has his sights set high, as
he hopes to win the national title in
his event as a freshman.
"It's not an unattainable goal —
if I don't hold back, and if every
thing goes well. I can do it."he said.
Also lingering somewhere in the
future are the London Olympics in
2012. Indeed, having yet eclipsed his
potential, some serious hard work
could pay off and result in interna
tional stardom for the freshman.
"I feel like as I i>et older and

more mature, my talents are in
creasing. I am more aware and con
fident in my running." Morton said.
In addition to that long-term
goal. Morton also hopes to use his
talents to better the Cardinal track
and field program. Since Stanford is
distinctly known for having a su
perb distances program. Morton
hopes to help develop the sprints
side of the team, and make Stanford
a well-rounded powerhouse. Addi
tionally. Morton wants to make his
record untouchable, reserving him
self a permanent spot on the Stan
ford boards.
