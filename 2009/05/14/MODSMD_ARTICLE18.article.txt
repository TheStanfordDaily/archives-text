## Univ. to host female Iraqi scholar 
### AIMEE MILES 
A pilot program developed hy the nonprofit Iraqi
Women's Fellowship Foundation (IWFF) is finalizing
plans to host an Iraqi woman faculty member for a year
long residence at Stanford for the next academic year,
according to Ryan Orr, executive director of the
Collaborative for Research on Global Projects (CRGP).
The IWFF aims to provide training and networking
opportunities for Iraqi female educators who have
begun a leadership track at their respective home insti
tutions.
While the IWFF requested that the faculty member's
surname and university affiliation be withheld for secu
rity reasons, they agreed to identify her as Dr. Afaneen.
Afaneen, who holds a Ph.D. in power engineering, will
be Stanford's visiting scholar for the 2009-2010 academ
ic year. She is an assistant professor in a university engi
neering department in Baghdad.
"1 will [try] to learn about the modern teaching and
researching methods in your university so as to improve
my teaching and researching skills." Afaneen wrote in an
email to the Daily.
The IWFF had been recruiting women like Afaneen
in Iraq through the Ministries of Education, deans of the
schools of engineering and applied sciences at Iraqi uni
versities, newspaper advertisements and a press release
by the U.S. Embassy. Criteria for qualification include
being a female faculty member in engineering or
applied science with functional English language skills
and the ability to travel to the U.S. for a year.
"[Afaneen] has indicated that [she] is [interested] in
conveying her newfound knowledge to her students, but
also in applying it to the improvement of Iraq's electri
cal network." IWFF President Mary Dates Smith wrote
in an email to The Daily.
After applying for placement through the IWFF's
nonprofit subcontract partner, America-Mideast
Educational and Training Services (AMIDEAST),
Afaneen was formally invited in a letter from the
CRGP's program administrative manager to interact
with the University's research team, audit classes, use
the libraries and attend eolloquia.
Orr indicated that he intends to introduce the schol
ar to "a cross-section of different labs in the Y2F2

[Building], including the CRGP, Construction
Engineering & Management, the Precourt Institute for
Energy Efficiency (PIEE), the Interdisciplinary
Program in Environment and Resources and the Woods
Institute."
Assistant to the Director of the PI EE Tammy
Goodall said that the Precourt Institute had expressed
an interest in developing an informal relationship with
the scholar though she said that she was not sure in what
capacity. While Afaneen would not be working with the
PI EE directly, Goodall said that affiliates were receptive
to showing her around in order to gauge the compatibil
ity of her research interests with theirs.
"We won't really know what her interests are until
she comes, and |we] help her map out a set of goals for
the year and make some connections to help her achieve
those," Orr added.
Afaneen will join the CRPG in the fall of 2009. In a
written recommendation of the candidate. AMIDEAST
coordinator Quincy Dermody described her as "An
energetic and outgoing woman who has been a lectur
er/assistant professor for 10 years."
Dermody confirmed that Afaneen would be attend
ing a cultural and logistical orientation in Iraq prior to
her departure, and would later be enrolled in an inten
sive English language-learning program at Stanford
beginning in July, two months prior to the start of the
program.
The I WIT currently has plans to develop a five-year
engineering and applied sciences program for future
generations of Iraqi women who aspire toward academ
ic leadership.
Orr was confident that the fledgling program would
achieve its short-term objective to provide a career
building experience for Afaneen.
"She'll learn more about modern western approach
es to science and research," he said. "[lt's an opportuni
ty! to think about her own career transition, and get
ready for that responsibility."
" Two decades ago. Iraq had a flourishing program of
science for women, but it was crushed under Hussein,"
Orr added. "It would be an honor to help give some
thing back to the Iraqi people."
