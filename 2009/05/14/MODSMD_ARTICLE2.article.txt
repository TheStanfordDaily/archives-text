## Former Secretary of State George Shultz relates his experiences to The Daily 
### KAMIL DADA DESK EDITOR 
At 88 years old, and after serving three
universities, two presidents and one of the
largest companies in the country, one
would expect George Shultz. to sit back
and reflect on his long career as a public
servant.
But Shultz isn't a man prone to reflec
tion.
"I'm not a very introspective person,"
he said during a lecture Monday night in
Memorial Church. "About all I can do is
tell stories."
In meetings with selected groups of stu
dents early this week as part of his
Rathbun fellowship. Shult/ relayed his
experiences as director of the Office of
Management and Budget, Secretary of
Labor and then Treasury under Nixon and
Secretary of State for Reagan. Outside of
government, Shult/ was a Princeton foot
ball coach in college, a marine in World
War 11. an Mi l professor, dean of the
University of Chicago's Graduate School
of Business, and director and president of
engineering firm Bechtel Group.
The Daily sat down with Shultz to dis
cuss everything from China's role in inter
national politics, the Iran-Contra affair and
torture to domestic California!! politics
and his alleged Princeton tiger tattoo.
When pressed on what he regards as his
finest accomplishment over his long career,
Shultz was reluctant to pick a particular
moment and instead pointed to memories
that had a human face.
"Obviously, the tectonic plates of the
world changed when I was in office."
Shult/ said. "The (Old War came to an end.

so that's a big deal, and I had at least a lit
tle part in it. But, human things have more
of an impact."
He pointed out that one of the prob
lems he worked on was the issue of Jews in
the Soviet Union who were oppressed and
not allowed to worship or emigrate to
Israel. Shultz referred to the case of Ida
Nudel. a refusenik and human rights
activist in the Soviet Union, who won the
right to leave the country in 1987. He vivid
ly recollected a phone call he received
from her on the day she arrived in Israel.
"The voice on the end of the line said.
'This is Ida Nudel. I'm in Jerusalem. I'm
home.'" Shultz recalled.
Shultz then quickly delved into politics
and elucidated his views on nuclear
weapons, an issue that he thinks is the
biggest threat facing the globe today. He
pointed out that he has been working with
fellows at the 1 loover Institution towards a
world free of nuclear weapons.To that end.
when asked whether negotiating with
world leaders in states such as North Korea
was a wise decision, Shultz. emphasized
leaving the channels of communication
open.
"We negotiated with the Soviet leaders
when we called the Soviet Union an evil
empire — and it was — but it was impor
tant to be engaged, and it paid off," Shultz
said. "It's tricky to do."
Yet he stopped short of giving specific
advice to President Obama and the current
administration.
"(Obama) has lots of different situa
tions on his hands," Shultz said. "He has
some bad actors like North Korea and
Iran. So. I think he needs to design his
approach to each of them specially. It's all

interrelated in a broad sense. So it" you
develop a good capability with Russia and
China, that's going to help in dealing with
Iran."
Shultz also touched upon the nature of
torture and waterboarding. given the
recent national press attention surround
ing declassified documents that reported
that former Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice gave the nod of
approval to then-CIA Director George
Tenet to use waterboarding. Shultz pointed
to the Geneva Convention that prohibits
the use of torture and said that he agreed
with it. However, he argued that the
Geneva Convention does not particularly
identify or define exactly what torture is.
"I don't want to try and second-guess
people who were in the administration or
Congress, who in the intense problems
right after 9/11 said that we also have to do
everything we can to protect the country,"
Shultz said. "They probably deviated
somewhat from what the Geneva
Convention called for."
He argued that the administration was
in a difficult situation and was operating in
a setting where it had to protect the coun
try after a major terrorist attack. To that
end. he did not believe that legal authori
ties should investigate or prosecute admin
istrators, such as Rice.
"I'm not in favor of going back and try
ing to prosecute people for doing what
they regarded as their duty to protect our
national security." he said. "I think it could
set a very bad precedent."
Just over two weeks ago. Rice noted to

Former Secretary of State and Treasury George Shultz discussed his experiences in politics
and weighed in on contemporary issues such as the economic crisis and national security.
