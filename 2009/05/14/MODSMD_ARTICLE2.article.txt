# A 						History of Service
## Former Secretary of State George Shultz relates his experiences to The Daily 
### KAMIL DADA DESK EDITOR 
At 88 years old, and after serving three
universities, two presidents and one of the
largest companies in the country, one
would expect George Shultz. to sit back
and reflect on his long career as a public
servant.
But Shultz isn't a man prone to reflec
tion.
"I'm not a very introspective person,"
he said during a lecture Monday night in
Memorial Church. "About all I can do is
tell stories."
In meetings with selected groups of stu
dents early this week as part of his
Rathbun fellowship. Shult/ relayed his
experiences as director of the Office of
Management and Budget, Secretary of
Labor and then Treasury under Nixon and
Secretary of State for Reagan. Outside of
government, Shult/ was a Princeton foot
ball coach in college, a marine in World
War 11. an Mi l professor, dean of the
University of Chicago's Graduate School
of Business, and director and president of
engineering firm Bechtel Group.
The Daily sat down with Shultz to dis
cuss everything from China's role in inter
national politics, the Iran-Contra affair and
torture to domestic California!! politics
and his alleged Princeton tiger tattoo.
When pressed on what he regards as his
finest accomplishment over his long career,
Shultz was reluctant to pick a particular
moment and instead pointed to memories
that had a human face.
"Obviously, the tectonic plates of the
world changed when I was in office."
Shult/ said. "The (Old War came to an end.

so that's a big deal, and I had at least a lit
tle part in it. But, human things have more
of an impact."
He pointed out that one of the prob
lems he worked on was the issue of Jews in
the Soviet Union who were oppressed and
not allowed to worship or emigrate to
Israel. Shultz referred to the case of Ida
Nudel. a refusenik and human rights
activist in the Soviet Union, who won the
right to leave the country in 1987. He vivid
ly recollected a phone call he received
from her on the day she arrived in Israel.
"The voice on the end of the line said.
'This is Ida Nudel. I'm in Jerusalem. I'm
home.'" Shultz recalled.
Shultz then quickly delved into politics
and elucidated his views on nuclear
weapons, an issue that he thinks is the
biggest threat facing the globe today. He
pointed out that he has been working with
fellows at the 1 loover Institution towards a
world free of nuclear weapons.To that end.
when asked whether negotiating with
world leaders in states such as North Korea
was a wise decision, Shultz. emphasized
leaving the channels of communication
open.
"We negotiated with the Soviet leaders
when we called the Soviet Union an evil
empire — and it was — but it was impor
tant to be engaged, and it paid off," Shultz
said. "It's tricky to do."
Yet he stopped short of giving specific
advice to President Obama and the current
administration.
"(Obama) has lots of different situa
tions on his hands," Shultz said. "He has
some bad actors like North Korea and
Iran. So. I think he needs to design his
approach to each of them specially. It's all

interrelated in a broad sense. So it" you
develop a good capability with Russia and
China, that's going to help in dealing with
Iran."
Shultz also touched upon the nature of
torture and waterboarding. given the
recent national press attention surround
ing declassified documents that reported
that former Secretary of State
Condoleezza Rice gave the nod of
approval to then-CIA Director George
Tenet to use waterboarding. Shultz pointed
to the Geneva Convention that prohibits
the use of torture and said that he agreed
with it. However, he argued that the
Geneva Convention does not particularly
identify or define exactly what torture is.
"I don't want to try and second-guess
people who were in the administration or
Congress, who in the intense problems
right after 9/11 said that we also have to do
everything we can to protect the country,"
Shultz said. "They probably deviated
somewhat from what the Geneva
Convention called for."
He argued that the administration was
in a difficult situation and was operating in
a setting where it had to protect the coun
try after a major terrorist attack. To that
end. he did not believe that legal authori
ties should investigate or prosecute admin
istrators, such as Rice.
"I'm not in favor of going back and try
ing to prosecute people for doing what
they regarded as their duty to protect our
national security." he said. "I think it could
set a very bad precedent."
Just over two weeks ago. Rice noted to

and weighed in on contemporary issues such as the economic crisis and national security.
public on You Tube. that President
Bush instructed officials that noth
ing they would do would be outside
of their legal obligations under the
Convention against Torture.
"So. by definition, if it was
authorized by the President, it did
not violate our obligations under
the Convention," Rice said to the
student.
The comment sparked off a
maelstrom of responses in the
national spotlight, with some sug
gesting that Rice implied that a
presidential authorization "by defi
nition" grants something legality.
Shultz. however, strongly dis
agreed with this interpretation of
the law.
"The President is never above
the law." he said.
Going back to the origins of the
George W. Bush administration,
many point to Shultz as playing a
defining role. According to
Jacqueline Edmonson, a biogra
pher of Condoleezza Rice, when
Bush gave a fundraising speech for
the Republican Party in 1998.
Shultz invited Bush to attend a
meeting with experts from the
Hoover Institution. According to
Edmonson. Rice impressed Bush
so much that she made regular trips
to Austin. Tex. to counsel Bush in
his run for President.
"We learned that [George W.
Bush] was going to be down in this
area ... so we said. 'Why don't you
come over to my house and I'll
gather a few people together, and
we'll talk about policy issues.'"
Shultz said. "We had a good discus
sion. and she was there. I think that
was probably the first time she
| Rice] engaged in a major discus
sion on policy issues. It was very
good. The argument went back and
forth and he [Bush] seemed to
enjoy it."
Indeed. Shultz pointed out that
as a result of that meeting. Bush
decided to inform himself on vari
ous political issues and regularly
invited people to talk to him in
Austin. Shultz said he was not part
of those meetings, but Rice and
Paul Wolfowitz — who had previ
ously worked under various aus
pices for both Dick Cheney and
Shultz — played a large part in the

meetings. Edmonson pointed out
that Rice and Wolfowitz assembled
a team of foreign advisors, all of
whom received prominent posi
tions in the Bush administration
once he was elected to office.
"Condi was the leader of it and
Paul Wolfowitz was one of the peo
ple involved." Shultz said. "They
did that and continued to he for
eign policy advisors to the cam
paign."
Reflecting upon historic
moments during his tenure as
Secretary of Sate under Reagan.
Shultz strenuously objected to the
U.S.-sponsored secret shipments of
weapons to Iran by Israel in 1985 in
exchange for the return of
American hostages. Shultz said that
Reagan cared deeply about the
hostages and felt that as President,
it was up to him ensure their safety.
"I think it was a mistake to care
too much, because if it becomes
clear that you will pay something to
get a hostage back, you encourage
taking more hostages." he said. "So,
I argued against this whole
process."
Shultz also weighed in on cur
rent-day political and economic
challenges, both at home and
abroad.
In terms of the global economic
crisis, when asked whether China
should re-value its currency and
de-link it from the dollar, as some
have suggested. Shultz prioritized
domestic stability.
"We have to be careful that we
don't build into the situation now
where [there is] a budget fiscal
deficit and a need for the federal
reserve to finance it."he cautioned.
"That leads to inflation. The
Chinese are worried about that."
He also argued that the govern
ment and the country as a whole
needed to save. He explicated the
relationship between domestic sav
ings and the global economy, by
pointing out how the U.S. was
unable to finance its own invest
ment.
"Other countries did save more
than they needed to save," Shultz
said. "So all their savings came
here."
As a result, he said that this
amounted to a large imbalance of
trade with a big deficit on the one
hand, and big surpluses on the
other.
"We should be coming out of
this, with households saving more."
Shultz said. "If we can do that and

get the government's dis-saving
under control, then we won't need
to be importing money, the savings,
from others. Then, we'll have a
more balanced trade situation;
that's something that can con
tribute to greater stability."
In terms of Californian politics.
Shultz co-chaired the Economic
Recovery Team with billionaire
investor Warren Buffet for
Governor Arnold
Schwarzenegger's gubernatorial
campaign and has been a long
time. informal economic advisor.
"Arnold Schwarzenegger is a
terrific guy." Shultz said. "He has
done a brilliant job. He is in a very
tough spot now because the econo
my has soured, and so the revenue
base of the California budget has
declined a lot."
Shultz described how the
California tax system is suscepti
ble to huge variations, depending
on the economy. He relayed how
Schwarzenegger was attempting
to create stability by creating a
"rainy day" fund to store cash
reserves when the economy was
going well.
"When things are good, it sky
rockets. but then when things go
wrong or go down, it plunges," he
said. "So, we ought to have a tax
system that has a little more stabil
ity to it."
Looking to future California
governor hopefuls, Shultz briefly
talked about Gavin Newsom, the
current mayor of San Francisco
who announced his intention to run
in the 2010 election in April of this
year. Shultz said that he knew
Newsom well and wished him well,
but was not optimistic about his
chances.
"He'll probably have a hard run
for governor. because San
Francisco is so different in the way
it votes than most of the rest of
California," Shultz said.
Besides his stories of foreign
diplomacy and politics, the one
time worid leader was also willing
to speak about the lighter side of
his personal life.
When asked about the alleged
homage to Princeton, his alma
mater, in the form of a tiger tat
tooed on his backside, Shultz gave
an elusive answer.
"I have a no-confirm-or-deny
policy." he said with a wry smile.
