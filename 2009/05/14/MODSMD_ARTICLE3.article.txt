## Facebook relocates offices 
### ROBERT TOEWS STAFF WRITER 
Today, social networkers around the
world will still be accessing Facebook at
the same Web address, but its employees
will be heading to work at a new location
at the Stanford Research Park.
Facebook is planning to move its head
quarters from downtown Palo Alto to
consolidate the rapidly growing social
networking company into a single, two
storv buildinu.

Tlie move marks the next step in the
growth of Facebook, which was founded
in a I larvard dorm room in I ebruary 2004
and now ranks as the fifth-most popular
Web site in the world.
In June 2004. the company moved to
its current location in downtown Palo
Alto. It quickly outgrew its office, howev
er. and had to rent increasing amounts of
space in surrounding office buildings.
Facebook headquarters now sprawl
across 10 different offices, an inconven
ient setup that executives say prompted

the move to Stanford Research Park.
"This new space is the next step in our
growth and positions us well to continue
looking for a long-term campus solution,
while also allowing employees to work
together as much as possible." the compa
ny said in a statement.
"We have loved our time in downtown
Palo Alto and consider it part of the DNA
here at Facebook." the statement added.
"Many of our employees live in the area
and will continue to be a part of the down
town community."

The new facility encompasses just
under 150.0(H) square feet and is located
at 1601 S. California Ave., adjacent to the
University. It will house the vast majority
of Facebooks nearly I.(KH) employees.
The location was previously an office of

Agilent, an electronics measurement
company spun off from Hewlett-
Packard.
Stanford Research Park was
founded in 1951 as a technology
focused office park offering compa
nies the opportunity for close collab
oration with members of the
University community. The Park is
believed to have played a key role in
the development of what would
eventually come to be known as
Silicon Valley.
It remains to be seen whether this
move signals the emergence of
stronger ties between Stanford and
Face book.
Daniel Schultz 10, who currently
works for l acebook. said the move
fit in with a tradition of Stanford
having a positive influence on the
company.
"There is no doubt that the
I diversity has a tremendous impact
on the company's success in the
high-tech realm." Schult/ said.
In a goodwill gesture, lacebook
hosted an open house for area resi
dents on May 11.
