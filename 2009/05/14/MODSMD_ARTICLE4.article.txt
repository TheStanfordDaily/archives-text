face off in the Round of 16 at College
Station. Texas.
While Baylor got the hest of Stanford
in last year's matchup, much has
changed for both teams since last year.
The Lady Bears are missing three sin
gles players from their previous squad,
including their No. I player Zuzana
Zemenova.
"They were a completely different
team last year, and quite frankly, so were
we." said Cardinal junior Lindsay
Burdette. "This year, they lost a couple
good players, and I feel like we are at
our strongest going into this match. I'm
really excited to play them the first
round."
No. 13 Stanford is coming off two
convincing shutouts in the opening
rounds of the NCAA tournament
against Wichita State and I SI I. With 14
wins in their last 16 matches, the
Cardinal women are ready to take on
the best of the best.
"We're carrying a lot of momentum
because of how we started off the sea
son." Burdette said."lt was a little rocky.

Led by sophomre Hilary Barte, the Stanford women's tennis team made easy work of
rounds one and two of the NCAA Tournament, sweeping both Wichita State and LSU.
and I think that we are a stronger team for
that. The momentum is definitely ours head
ing into the match."
(ertainlv. Stanford's lineup has shuffled a
hit from the beginning of the season.
In singles. Burdette and senior Jessica
Nguyen swapped places in the lineup in the
middle of the season. Since then, both have
thrived at their current spots with Nguyen
picking up two wins over the weekend and
Burdette posting a strong 6-1,6-1 win on Sun
day.
At the bottom half of the lineup, freshman
Veronica Li, sophomore C arolyn McVeigh
and freshman Logan Hansen have added
greater depth to Stanford's lineup.
However. Baylor is no slouch either. With
four nationally ranked singles players with at
least 20 dual match wins, the Lady Bears are
currentlv on a 20-match win streak heading

into I riday.
Still, the numbers do not matter to Stan
ford as they've shown in the past.
"We have the strongest confidence," Bur
dette said. "Their winning streaks don't mat
ter. If we play like we should, we will match up
very well with them."
Perhaps the strongest weapon in Stan
ford's lineup is sophomore Hilary Barte at
No. I Barte is currently playing at the top of
her game, and led No. 13 Megan Falcon of
I Sli before play was suspended on Sunday.
Barte (32-5 overall, 21-1 duals) will face Tay
lor Ormond. who is 10-12 at No. I and 27-20
overall on the year.
In doubles, Stanford has been aided by the
strong play of the No. 3 team of Li and
Hansen.'Che Cardinal women have not lost
the doubles point since March 2Kth against
I JSC

However, not all is in Stanford's favor.
Once again. Stanford will have to leave the
Farm, where they have been unbeaten for
over a decade. All four of Stanford's losses
have come on the road this season.
Adding to their road woes, Baylor fans are
expected to make the 92-mile drive to ( ollege
Station, where they will root on their Lady
Bears. Still, Stanford remains unfazed.
"We are going to have a pretty substantial
crowd with alumni and family," Burdette said.
"All in all. we're going to have a pretty well
simulated Stanford home court."
With scattered thunderstorms predicted
for the next few days, the weather can be a
problem in the first few rounds.
"It's really windy and hot out here, which
can be a factor in some of the matches." Bur
dette said. "We've played in the wind all sea
son, and we will handle that situation well."

Finally, the Cardinal women have one
more thing in their favor â€” the men's team is
also at College Station for the Round of 16.
"We're going out to watch their match to
morrow. and hopefully they'll he able to
watch ours." Burdette said, "it'll be basically
like a regular home match. It'll totally help us
with them there."
The last time both teams made it to the
Round of 16, the Cardinal women took home
the national title. In fact, the last time the
tournament was in Texas, Stanford also
cruised to the ('hampionship back in l l )K4.
With all signs pointing toward a title run.
perhaps it is time for Stanford to reclaim its
place at the top of the college world after a
two-year hiatus.
