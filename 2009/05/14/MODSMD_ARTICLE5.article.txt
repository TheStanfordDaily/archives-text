## Stanford's storied line of stem cell research 
### JULIA BROWNELL DESK EDITOR 
Among uniquitous construction or
Stanford's medical school campus, the niosi
recent project is the Lorry Lokey Stem ( el
Research Building, the new home foi
Stanford's Stem Cell Biology anc
Regenerative Medicine Institute (SCBRMI). I'lu
expansive new building highlights a rich history ol
stem cell research at Stanford and the accomplish
ments of one of the most elite research teams in tlx
nation.
Ever since the l ( )h()s. the tools for and trials ol steir
cell research have been fermenting in the minds ol
Stanford researchers. Dr. Irving Weissman has been ;â€¢
leader of stem cell research since the field's inception
and he now directs the SCBRMI on campus.
"[Weissman] really is one of the founding fathers ol
stem cell research, and so there's ;i long history ol
excellence in stem cell research |at Stanford|." said Dr
Renee Reijo Pera, a recent hire in embryonic stem eel
research and developmental biology from the I ( Sar
Francisco Medical School.
Stanford's stem cell history began in wher
Professor of Genetics I meritus Leonard ller/enbeu
developed the 112 luorescence Activated Cell Sortim
(LACS) machine. The device uses antibodies taggec
with fluorescent dye to differentiate various cells usim
a laser, which sends readings ol the cell dyes to .i com
puter. The computer can then tell which cell jusi
passed by the laser, and uses an electrode It) charge the
different cell types. The cells then pass through
charged electrodes into different test tubes.
The LACS allowed Weissman to isolate the tirs
mouse hematopoietic (blood) stem cell from a boiu
marrow sample in 19K7. In I Wl. Weissman isolated th<
first human stem cell, again a blood stem cell.
