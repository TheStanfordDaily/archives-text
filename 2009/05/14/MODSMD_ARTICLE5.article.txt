## Stanford's storied line of stem cell research 
### JULIA BROWNELL DESK EDITOR 
Among uniquitous construction or
Stanford's medical school campus, the niosi
recent project is the Lorry Lokey Stem ( el
Research Building, the new home foi
Stanford's Stem Cell Biology anc
Regenerative Medicine Institute (SCBRMI). I'lu
expansive new building highlights a rich history ol
stem cell research at Stanford and the accomplish
ments of one of the most elite research teams in tlx
nation.
Ever since the l ( )h()s. the tools for and trials ol steir
cell research have been fermenting in the minds ol
Stanford researchers. Dr. Irving Weissman has been ;•
leader of stem cell research since the field's inception
and he now directs the SCBRMI on campus.
"[Weissman] really is one of the founding fathers ol
stem cell research, and so there's ;i long history ol
excellence in stem cell research |at Stanford|." said Dr
Renee Reijo Pera, a recent hire in embryonic stem eel
research and developmental biology from the I ( Sar
Francisco Medical School.
Stanford's stem cell history began in wher
Professor of Genetics I meritus Leonard ller/enbeu
developed the 112 luorescence Activated Cell Sortim
(LACS) machine. The device uses antibodies taggec
with fluorescent dye to differentiate various cells usim
a laser, which sends readings ol the cell dyes to .i com
puter. The computer can then tell which cell jusi
passed by the laser, and uses an electrode It) charge the
different cell types. The cells then pass through
charged electrodes into different test tubes.
The LACS allowed Weissman to isolate the tirs
mouse hematopoietic (blood) stem cell from a boiu
marrow sample in 19K7. In I Wl. Weissman isolated th<
first human stem cell, again a blood stem cell.
After isolating these stem cells, Weissman
recognized their ability to regenerate the
immune and blood systems in a mouse, and
then brought the stem cells through FDA clin
ical trials.
"Our first clinical trial was down here at
Stanford." Weissman recounted, 'i remember
the first patient because I went to see the injec
tion. This was a woman who had breast cancer
that had spread through her whole body. They
injected into her the stem cells that were really
purified, and instead of having a liter and a half
of really bloody material called mobilized
blood, it was a 1-cc syringe and you couldn't
even see anything ... I think she's alive today."
Weissman's studies led to the first modern
bone marrow transplants. These now common
procedures used to cure blood cancers are the
often unrecognized accepted stem cell thera
pies today. As a result of the efforts of
researchers and doctors, these procedures have
made huge strides in curing leukemia and lym
phoma. The two cancers now have some of the
higher survival rates among cancer types.
"Of course it was incredible," Weissman said
of the trials. "That was the proof of principle
that you could do it."
Today Stanford is a leader not just in blood
cancer research, but in the larger field of can
cer stem cell research.
The Stanford Cancer Center has a large
stem cell research program, headed by Dr.
Michael Clarke and Dr. Roeland Nusse. The
center has isolated many different cancer stem
cells and is working on therapies to help better
target them in treatment. Clarke was the first
to isolate a solid tumor cancer cell, the breast
cancer cell, while at the University of Michigan
before coming to Stanford.
The new therapies for cancer stem cells
come out of Stanford researchers thanks to
generous funding from the California Institute
for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), author
ized by California voters in 2004 through
Proposition 71. This institute funds all forms of
stem cell research in laboratories in California,
despite federal bans on embryonic stem cell
research.

stem cells to regenerate the
human immune system

In addition. Stanford has a number of pri
vate donors that make it unique in support for
stem cell programs in the state and in the coun
try.
"An anonymous donor couple, who by now
I think have given $30 to 40 million ... It

allowed us to recruit people, it allowed us to
have a facility off-campus that never had NIH
money in it, so Bush couldn't come and sue us
or something, and their money, plus the money
of Lorry Lokey, has started the road to the
building," Weissman said.
Stanford is also unique as a program because
of its long history of collaboration with engi
neers, physicists and other physical scientists.
ITirough unique programs like the interdiscipli
nary Bio-X collaboration between the medical
school and engineers, and through general over
lap between different departments, Stanford has
created a unique environment of collaboration.
"The Bio-X program between the medical
school and the engineering department, we're
all working together ... there's a division of the
medical school that works on bioinformatics,"
Herzenberg said. "A lot of students get their
Ph.Ds and start companies or work for compa
nies."
"Stanford is very, very well placed to do all
these types of studies," he added.
Since Herzenberg's FACS helped Weissman
isolate the first stem cells, this collaboration has
led to amazing discoveries at Stanford. Among
other projects, bioengineers, cardiologists and
stem cell researchers are working together on
generating heart tissue for repairs and possibly
heart transplants.
"I can work with people in the cardiovascu
lar institute, neurological institute ... so we
really get to work across the board just by work
ing with the line with differentiation and basic
human development," Reijo Pera explained.
"Because [Stanford is] not huge, we seem to
multi-task."
Because of these collaborations, leading fac
ulty and long history of high-caliber research.
Stanford is a hot bed for stem cell research,
and should continue to be in the upcoming
years.
"1 think that a lot of the first clinical trials,
or at least the earliest applications for clinical
trials, are going to come out of Stanford." Reijo
Pera said.
