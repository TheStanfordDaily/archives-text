## STUDENT GOV'T GSC discusses 750 Pub, Vaden fee 
### MOLLY SPAETH CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The Graduate Student Council
(GSC) discussed student involve
ment in securing new ownership for
the 750 Pub. as well as graduate stu
dent selection for the Vaden
Advisory Committee, at its
Wednesday night meeting.
Delegates spent a significant
amount of time debating the future of
the 750 pub. the student bar that is
located in the Graduate Student
Community Center (GSCC). Mary
Van der Hoven. the earth sciences
representative to the GSC. relayed
information on the 750 to other coun
cil members, whoc discussed in detail
how the responsibility of selecting
new ownership could be shifted away
from Residential Dining &
Enterprises (RD&E) and toward a
more student-run enterprise.
"RD&E is currently in charge of
finding a vendor and those discus
sions are sort of underway." Van der
Hoven said. "We feel like maybe
that's not the person to be in charge
of that space because this is. after all.
the graduate community center.
Along either track, there is some
interest in students running that
space."
Other members voiced concern
with the pub's vacancy over the
summer, and whether the furniture,
pool tables and televisions would be
removed along with the current
ownership. Van der Hoven stressed
the urgency of finding a vendor
before the end of summer.
"1 would have to say that if we
don't have someone there by fall. I
think that everybody in this room is
not going to be very happy." Van der
I ioven said.
The next order of business was
the newly created Vaden Advisory
Committee. Jessica Tsai. the School
of Medicine representative and
GSC programming co-coordinator,
informed members that applicants
for the third graduate student posi

tion on the committee will be
attending the GSC meeting next
week. At that time. GSC members
will be able to ask questions and
vote on the final member. Ryan
Peacock, GSC member at-large and
financial officer, raised the idea of
having the responsibility of selection
moved to the Nominations
Commission (NomCom).
Discussion then moved to a for
merly proposed idea of using co
pays instead of the $167/ quarter fee
as a means to alleviate some of the
Vaden financial burden. Tsai
informed the members that
although she had discussed the idea
with Vaden Director Ira Friedman,
using co-pays eould actually turn out
to be more expensive. Peacock pro
posed talking to the administration
in attempts to get the fee subsidized.
"I do think that we still need to
go back and have a conversation
with the administration," he said.
"We can try to talk them into 50 per
cent — even if they're only subsidiz
ing 25 percent for 12-month stu
dents. that's $700 — that is still a sig
nificant chunk of change.
Earlier in the meeting. ASSU
President David Gobaud 'ON M.S.
'10 briefed the GSC on his newly
appointed cabinet, which has more
than 20 members. Gobaud intro
duced the GSC to Ryan Woessner
'10. who will he serving as legislative
liaison for the Gobaud-De La Torre
administration. Gobaud said that he
was currently in the process of creat
ing the graduate cabinet, and would
have more information in the next
few days.
In other business. Adam Beberg,
a computer science Ph.D. student
and former member of three GSC
councils, informed delegates that the
fee imposed upon students to com
plete a master's in addition to a
Ph.D. would increase from $50 to
$125 in the fall.
