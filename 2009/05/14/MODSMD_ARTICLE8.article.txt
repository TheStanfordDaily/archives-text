## EDITORIAL Row exemption to NSO alcohol policy carries mixed messages 
### 
Stanford's Alcohol Advisory Board
(AAB) announced last week that Row
houses will be exempt from the "dry
campus" policy during New Student Orien
tation (NSO) 2009.The decision to reaffirm
the Row's exemption to the NSO policy was
made despite a number of alcohol-related
incidents that took place on the Row during
NSO 2008.
However, the AAB has put in place a
number of new restrictions for Row resi
dents. including a later move-in date — peo
ple living on the Row had previously been
allowed to move in several days before stu
dents housed in other dorms on campus —
as well as increased restrictions on gather
ings that involve alcohol during the four-day
NS() period.The revised NSO policy places
a two-gathering limit on Row houses, man
dates that food be present during these gath
erings and maintains that no hard alcohol be
served, along with other limitations (see
"Row faces new NSO rules." May 8).
In general, the editorial board believes
that the University's revised alcohol policy
for NSO is reasonable. It is important for
Stanford to put its best foot forward during
Orientation, and upperclassmen have a re
sponsibility to help create a positive, safe en
vironment for new freshmen and transfer
students. (iiven that there were four alcohol
related medical transports and several unau
thorized gatherings with alcohol during
NSO 2008, the editorial board cannot blame
the I University for putting more restrictions
in place.
There seems to be a trend each year of
throwing enormous parties on the Row the

week before fall-quarter classes begin. While
it is normal for partying to get slightly more
out of hand when people have no academic
responsibilities, the student body should
take the new restrictions as a hint to be more
careful during NSO this fall.The AAB may
not be so lenient the next time alcohol-relat
ed emergencies take place during Orienta
tion.
That being said, the editorial board feels
that the no-hard-alcohol mandate over
reaches the goal of the AAB, especially if the
goal of the revised policy is to encourage ma
ture gatherings focused on welcoming Row
house residents. Vodka and rum may have a
higher alcohol content by volume than beer
or wine, but a mature gathering cannot take
place if the University does not treat students
like mature adults.The point of this policy is
to increase the level of caution exercised by
those hosting parties during NSO. Control
ling the type of alcohol served at these gath
erings goes too far, and may even encourage
students to ignore restrictions entirely.
It is clear that the University feels.at least
to some degree, that students are capable of
comporting themselves responsibly when al
cohol is present — hence the reaffirmation
of the "dry campus" exemption for the Row.
But to be effective, the AAB should demon
strate greater trust in students by avoiding
overly specific rules that are likely to be bro
ken. There is little doubt that parties will
happen on the Row during NSO, whether or
not the University wants them to. which is
why the AAB should focus on communicat
ing its expectations for students rather than
implementing nitpicky restrictions.
