## Nicole Demby In denial 
### 
Holocaust jokes were not infrequently
told in my presence growing up. No. I
don't come from the backwoods of
some Red state or from a family of Nazis.
Rather, from the time I was eight I attended
a Modern Orthodox Yeshiva on the Upper
Hast Side of Manhattan (imagine Gossip
Girl with long skirts and yamekas). Most of
my friends' grandparents, including my own,
were survivors. 'Hie Holocaust was some
thing we grew up with, a fact of our existence
as the third generation and something we
were taught about in school since kinder
garten. This intimacy seemed to allow us a
certain freedom when it came to how we
talked about the Holocaust because it was
taken for granted that we understood the
gravity of its horrors. It was only when I en
tered that world outside of the New York
Jewish bubble I was in that I realized this was
not a luxury afforded to the rest of the world.
(Hitside of my high school, the sheer men
tion of the I loloeaust seemed to require peo
ple's faces to assume an expression of utmost
sobriety, for their heads to bob up and down
slightly with an understanding nod. The
Shoah seemed to be the last frontier not
breached by Western civilization's affinity
for free speech (it's actually illegal to deny
the I loloeaust in some European countries).
You can say whatever you want, but not
about iluit.
The press has pointed out that when Pope
Benedict visited Israel this week, he seemed
to enter a political minefield in which he was
damned if he did, damned if he didn't. Many
criticized the pope for his speech at Yad
Vasliem. Israel's Holocaust museum. People
were unhappy that the Pope, a German who
participated compulsorily in the Hitler
Youth as a child and later served in the
Wehrmacht, referred vaguely to the "mil
lions of Jews killed" without mentioning the
sacred number "six million." Many were also
disappointed that Pope Benedict did not
speak about his own personal experiences in
the war. opting for a more generic engage
ment with the subject matter.
Another controversy over treatment of
the I loloeaust erupted this week when Face
book announced it was banning several
I lolocaust-denying groups such as one enti
tled "Holocaust is a I lolohoax" from the site.
The banned groups were accused of inciting
hate speech in denial of Facebook's State
ment of Rights and Responsibilities. Other

groups that questioned the veracity of the
Holocaust were allowed to remain on Face
book because, according to the company,
"the mere statement of denying the Holo
caust does not constitute a violation of our
policies." Of course. Facebook.like the Pope,
was in a situation in which it would necessar
ily garner criticism. It left itself open to
charges of anti-Semitism from those who
want all Holocaust-denial-related material
removed, and criticism from those who say
the company is refusing to take a moral
stand on the issue by resorting to citing poli
cy violations.
As you can see. things are never simple
when it comes to talking about the Holo
caust. Yet perhaps because 1 grew up not
feeling the need to tread so lightly on the
subject matter as society seems to require, I
can't help but feel there's something prob
lematic in relegating the topic such a sacred
realm in which the unspeakable still exists
despite all the free-speech rhetoric of liber
alism. Sure I think that people whose hate
speech seems to suggest impending violence
should be stopped and persecuted. Yet put
ting too much weight on issues like how
heartfelt the Pope is. or whether or not Face
book is anti-Semitic, distracts and detracts
from the actual historical reality of the 1 lolo
eaust.
In his book. "On Violence," Slavoj Zizek
says that by understanding the I loloeaust as
having been so horrible that it can only be
understood as a complete break from histo
ry. we create the notion of absolute evil. By
saying the Nazis were monsters without try
ing to understand the historical reasons why
Hitler may have come to power, we allow
people like George Bush to justify going to
war to fight the "axis of evil." and allow his
administration to justify torture against sim
ilar monsters. Instead of moralizing about
what the Pope or Facebook should have
done, we should see this issues as sympto
matic of a certain level of societal discomfort
with the topic. Perhaps recognizing this dis
comfort can spur productive discussion
about people's relationship to what actually
happened, and the way the history of the
I loloeaust affects us today.

Nicole promises this is the hist time Zizek will
come up in her column (fingers crossed behind
her hack). Email her at
