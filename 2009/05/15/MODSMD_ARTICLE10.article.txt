# Intermission's verdict on Backlight...
## 
### 
When I first heard about the concept of Backlight.org, I
thought to myself, "Wait, what? A website like that doesn't exist
already?" Backlight.org is a great home for creative minds, budding
artists, aspiring writers, or just anybody looking for a way to channel
their creative juices. Backlight.org is what the child of Deviantart,
Flickr, Blogger and Facebook might look like.
The layout of the website is also really fun and interactive.
Everything is user-friendly and thusfar the site is very easy to navi
gate. Take a look. Maybe even post something!
