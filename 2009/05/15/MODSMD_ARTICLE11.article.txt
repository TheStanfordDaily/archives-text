## King Lear 
### 
Deception. Royal intrigue. Madness. Such are the
classic makings of a Shakespearean tragedy.
Cigarettes, revolvers, coffee runs? Welcome to the
modern and apocalyptic world of William Shakespeare's
"King Lear" as envisioned by student director Zach
Chotzen-Freund '09 and the cast of the Stanford
Shakespeare Company.

This timeless Shakespearian
story follows the downfall of two
noble families, each torn apart by
greed and betrayal. An elderly King
Lear disowns her (yes, "her") faith
ful daughter, banishes her trusted
advisor, and leaves her kingdom in
the hands of the conniving daugh
ters Goneril and Reagan. Gloucester
is deceived by his bastard son
Edmund, falsely believing that his
loyal son Edgar conspires to murder
him. As Edgar flees from the court
under the guise of a beggar and the
fallen King Lear descends into a
tempest of madness, the families

intersect in a complex web of loyalty and treachery
As the play begins with a high-powered business din
ner, the cast attired in suits and contemporary garb, it is
evident that Chostzen-Freund has staged a fresh telling of
"King Lear." Indeed, the Stanford Shakes are renowned for
their innovative and engaging versions of Shakespeare's
works, as evidenced by their fall production of "The Two
Gentlemen of Verona," set in the opulent "Roaring
Twenties.' But this is no world of decadence we find our
selves in; instead, this is a modern society marked by cor
ruption and decay. Yet, despite its interpretive choices, the

company does an excellent job of retaining the essence of
Shakespeare.
"We tried not to change the original text too much,"
said cast member Philip Balliet *11. By fusing modernity
with Shakespeare's text, the director successfully highlights
the enduring human themes of family, duty, love and
betrayal.
One of the most noticeable features of this "King
Lear" is choice of casting a female as the title character.
When asked about the most difficult obstacle in preparing
tor this role, freshman Xandra Clark replied, "Fear. It was a
lot of pressure, and 1 had to tell myself to get over that
fear." There is no trace of hesitation in her performance,
however, especially in her later scenes — her regal portray
al of Lear in the first act serves to highlight the tragedy of
Lear's inevitable downfall.
There are absolutely no weak links in this cast. An
audience favorite was Alex Connolly '11, who played the
wicked Edmund with a devilish glee and an unexpected
comedic glimmer. Bronwyn Reed '12 should be commcnd-

Ed for her nat
ural perform
ances. Her
sweet, wide
eyed Cordelia
is so far
removed from
her role as the
droll and sinis
ter Fool — it
was a shock to
see her listed
as both charac
ters in the pro
gram.
The actors are

placed within a minimalistic setting of black furniture,
which works well with the dramatic lighting and the
expanse of the outdoors. Although there were several
issues with the lighting cues at the beginning of the first
act (the show was only permitted technical rehearsal this
past Monday), the effect of the Law School as a backdrop
served as a haunting reminder of the ambiguous morality
prominent throughout "King Lear."
The play runs a lengthy two and a half hours, but by
the time the lights descend upon the final scene, you will
be left with chills, and not just from the cold. Grab a blan

ket, and experience the drama
that is Shakespeare's "King
Lear."
Performances run
through Sunday outside of
the Richard Crown Law
Library. Admission is free.
