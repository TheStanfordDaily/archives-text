It starts as soon as you walk into the room. Sit down, be
quiet. The experience was immediate. Sleeper jump's ver
sion of the classical Medea story — the result of a Drama
Department senior project titled "MedeaMedeaMedea" — can
be summed up in one word: intense. This play will silence you
and make you lose your breath at times. You can't help but
always be focuscd on the central figure on stage: the puppet
Medea.
Sleeper lumps' production of Euripedes' classical Medea
was actually a retelling of a retelling. A major work by German
dramatist Heiner Miiller, "Despoiled Shore Medea Material
Landscape with Argonauts" is its own reworking of the original
Greek Medea tragedy written in 431 B.C. However, the Greek
myth of Jason and the Argonauts is taken to the next step in
MedeaMedeaMedea. After returning to Corinth with the
Golden Fleece, Jason is betrothed to Glauce, the princess, there
by abandoning Medea, the father of his children and savior in
his previous quest. The moral is: never mess with a witch
woman; Medea is understandably bitter and intent on bent on
revenge, therefore destroying everything in Jason's world. She
poisons golden robes and offers them to Glauce. She dies in the
arms of her father Creon, who also dies soon after. Finally, she
murders her two children to remove everything that Jason had
loved. It is very important to have some knowledge of the orig
inal play before entering the theatre. Sleeper Jump takes the
audience on a wild ride with no explanation, and follows the
Greek tradition of'in medias res,' starting in the middle of the
action.
The first thing you see onstage is a completely white back
ground. Sitting on the floor in a huge black dress is Medea's
puppeteer, Michelle Sutherland '09. She lifts a fold of her skirt
and removes a puppet with just a head and waist, with the
upper portion of legs all connected by string to disembodied
arms, like a doll.
When you first come into the theater, everyone sits down,
and it's completely silent. In fact, the entire play was silent save
for a German lullaby in the middle and eastern European music
toward the end. Along with Sutherland on the ground, hiding
the puppet from the audience, there are three other people:
Michael Bateman '08 as Jason, Hannah Kopp-Yates '12 as
Glauce and Cuauhtemoc Peranda '10 as King Creon — all of
whom were completely nude. Their nudity, like the silence in
the play, was purely an artistic choice made by Sleeper Jump.
What is interesting about the play was not exactly the lack of
sound, but its resultant focus on movement.
As the show builds toward the climax, Glauce is given a red
string meant to signify the poisoned robes. She falls dead, fol
lowed by her father and finally Jason. 1 lere, Sutherland puts the
puppet on the train of her dress, and walks through the stage,
leaving Medea by Glauce in the center of the stage. She dances
to the eastern European music and steps onto a stool. Above the
stage she yanks her hands and Jason jerks a puppet to her touch.
Lights fall, actors leave and when the lights turn back on, Medea
is left on stage, in the middle, tangled in the red rope. The audi
ence stays for a beat, collecting their thoughts together, before
standing up and leaving. There's no bow for Medea.
