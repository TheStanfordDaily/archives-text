# Stanford jazz orchestra with
## Jon Faddis 
### 
The Stanford Jazz Orchestra rocked Dinkelspiel
Auditorium this past Wednesday evening as they
jammed with renowned trumpet player lon Faddis.
The small-but-enthusiastic crowd cheered as Faddis strolled
on stage. Throughout the night, The Stanford Jazz Orchestra
played a number of songs written by Faddis and a few by his
mentor, the jazz icon Dizzy Gillespie. The show started with
Manteca, a Latin jazz tunc written by Chano Fozo and
Gillespie.
Jon Faddis does it all, representing the holy triumvirate of

music: performance, composi
tion and education. Having
started studying trumpet at the
age of eight, he has since
become one of the greatest lead
trumpet players in the world of
jazz. Faddis directs the Chicago
Jazz Ensemble and teaches at
the music conservatory at
Purchase College-SUNY. In
1997, he wrote a jazz opera
entitled "Lulu Noire," which
was critically acclaimed.
Faddis has completely and
totally mastered the technical
aspects of playing the trumpet.
He can play notes higher and
faster than I ever imagined pos
sible on the instrument. "He

has astonishing range!" commented one audience member.
He seems so comfortable on stage — performing truly comes
naturally to him.
Yet for all his fame and talent, Faddis defies trumpet play
er stereotypes, i.e. he does not appear to have a huge ego. He
seemed very genuine and likeable. He had a great sense of
humor, joking around a lot on stage. For example, during a
tense pause in the music, Faddis pointed to his sheet music

and shouted "Rest!" before resuming the song. The audience
responded well to him.
"Faddis has a lot of personality ... always entertaining,"
said Tyler Boyd-Meredith '12.
The jazz orchestra managed to not be overshadowed by
this trumpet titan — no easy task. The tight rhythm section
expertly drove up-tempo tunes like "The Baron," a piece that
was arranged specifically for The Stanford Jazz Orchestra.

There were occasionally problems with pitch in the trum
pet section, but nothing unforgivable.
Student soloists exhibited their skills of improvisation
throughout the evening. Freshman Jacob Wittenberg
showed an impressive command of the piano. Max and
Alex Eckstein, a pair of twins who arc only seniors in high
school, were also showcased in many numbers. Alex, on
the tenor sax, will actually be studying with Faddis in col
lege next year at Purchase. Bass player Leland Farmer was
another student soloist who stood out. Farmer was really
emotionally invested in the music, and as a result, his solos
were captivating.
Interestingly, only two members of the Stanford Jazz
Orchestra are music majors — a fact one would not guess
from listening to their excellent concert.
