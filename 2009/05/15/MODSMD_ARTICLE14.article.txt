# "7000 Islands One Beat": The Kayumanggi Spring Show
## 
### 
Kayumanggi's 4th Annual Spring Show, "7000 Islands
One Beat," featured a play with Filipino students per
forming as actors and actresses in lieu of the usual
MCs.
After the original — and hilarious — setup of the play, the
format mainly consisted of Filipinos from the more exotic
islands explaining the dances to their mainlander 112 riends. The
best explanations usually involved "show and tell" in the form
of either a simplistic rendition of the dancc or a dramatic per
formance of the dance's origins. The audience readily enjoyed
the change of structure to the show.
Logan Hehn '12 said, "It's helpful that they explain the
storyline and the historical context before each dance. It just
makes it that much more engrossing!"
The performances showcased Stanford's secretly thriving
community of Filipino students and simultaneously informed
and entertained audience members of all backgrounds.
"Even though I'm Filipino, I'd never even heard of many
of the traditional dances," said Ryan Torres '09. "The jokes
about the guy from Manila, who didn't know anything, were

funny, but they were also accurate."
Not everything in the show was wonderful, however.
I'hough most of the acting was phenomenal, some of the short
vignettes between dances seemed less well prepared and thus
created as many awkward lulls as humorous ones. The transi
tion into "7000 Islands One Beat" involved the audience stand
ing through the American and then Filipino national anthems.
Following Stanford tradition, the show went overtime
despite its brisk pace, and the food — the usual of crackers,
cheese, fruit and chips — had a considerably less generous
reception. "The advertising of'free food' was totally mislead
ing," said one attendee. "I was expecting Filipino dishes or

something. They
should have said,
'light refresh
ments provided.'"
Regardless, these
criticisms are
minor compared

to the show's new
and innovative structure as well as a great mix of culturally
informing and entertaining performances. Next year's organ
izers will surely have to work hard to top the bar that was set
this year.
The show also featured openers from Cardinal Calypso,
DVB, Kaorihiva, Talisman, Dil Se and FACS.
