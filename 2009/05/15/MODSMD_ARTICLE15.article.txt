# The 						Same Old Slang
## 
### 
In one of the defining moments of the 2004 independent
film "Garden State," Natalie Portman's character turns to a
disenchanted Zac Braff and places her earphones on his
head.
"You gotta hear this one song," she says. "It'll change your
life, I swear."
Cue "New Slang," the beginning of a silver-screen
romance and the astronomic rise of The Shins in the pop-cul
ture spotlight.
Five years removed from "Garden State" and anything
New )ersey for that matter, The Shins visited Oakland with
opening band Delta Spirit last Saturday night, playing a sold
out show at the plush new Fox Theatre. The Fox, which opened
in February, hosted the Fortland-based indie group, sandwich
ing their tour date in the middle of an impressive collection of
acts, which had already seen everyone from 8.8. King to Bloc
Party perform, and promises the likes of The Decemberists
and Sonic Youth in the near future.
The Shins, on their third tour since the 2007 release of
their junior album, "Wincing the Night Away," took to the
stage — complete with gold idols and trimming — on
Saturday night hoping to provide some inspiration to fans
before returning to the studio to record their fourth album.
However, unlike "Garden State," the performance was anything
but a life-changer.
While they opened with a cut of familiar songs off their
newest album, The Shins could not shake the noticeable fact
that they had a new look. The group, or what was left of it —
frontman James Russell Mercer, guitarist Dave Hernandez and
multi-instrumentalist Eric Johnson — failed to mention that
they had replaced members Marty Crandall and lesse Sandoval
with two new faces: one a lanky, ginger bassist and the other an
aloof drummer.
Though these artists were later identified to be Ron Lewis
from the Fruit Bats and Joe (insert "the" here) Plummer of
Modest Mouse, nonetheless the audiences' shock at seeing the

band with unannounced replacements was undeniable. With
group cohesion evidently lacking, minimized crowd interac
tion and banter between band mates created an almost uneasy,
quizzical air in the theatre. This feeling remained throughout
the night, a subtle slap in the face for fans expecting familiar
faces.
The sentiment seemed to translate into the performance.
A disinterested Mercer cruised through the opening songs,
from "Australia" to "Saint Simon," and the band struggled to
fill the venue with its musical intentions. Had Christopher
Walken attended, he would have chided the band for failing to
explore the studio space.
"Flay a loud song," a group of fans whined to no avail.
Acoustics aside, the band was also plagued by an oddly

chosen set list, creating an up-tempo atmosphere with songs
like "Phantom Limb," and then slowing it to walking pace soon
after with "Those to Come" and "Weird Divide," a mother's
favorite, according to Mercer. Furthermore, without any new
releases to tout, the band lacked the creative promoting ener
gy that had seen them embark on their previous two tours
with gusto and verve.
All they had this time were two new faces and a number
of pre-EP experiments. Mercer and Johnson went on to intro
duce these new songs and openly discussed switching their set
as they attempted to capture the crowd, which proved to be a
whole different endeavor in itself.
Those visiting The Fox to see The Shins perform provid
ed quite the eclectic mix ranging from middle-aged men to
high school students. Granted, while Mercer is fast approach
ing 40, one would not expect a crowd dynamic of awkwardly
swaying adults staring disapprovingly at drug-experimenting
teeny-boppers. Perhaps the teens, too eager to mature, had
taken Seth Rogen's "Pineapple Express" rant to heart: "You're
going to go off to college next year, and your going to get into
Godspeed You! Black Emperor, and the fucking Shins!"
As the night progressed, the band began to pick up its act
with "Sleeping Lessons" in particular proving quite impressive.
After returning for their encore, sans collared shirts, the band
continued to warm up to the crowd — but it proved to be too
little, too late.
Aside from Hernandez's tattered Iron Maiden shirt, the
night's overall confusion can perhaps best be encapsulated by
a 16-year-old's reaction to the performance of The Shin's claim
to fame: "New Slang."
"Gold teeth and a curse for this town were all in my
mouth," she sang. "Wait, those are the lyrics, right?"
