# "Jazzing" up the issues
## 
### 
Last night, Stanford Theatre Activist Mobilization Project (STAMP)
put on the second of its "Spring Into Action" One-Act plays,
"Jazzing."
At its onset, "Jazzing" by Yaa Gyasi seems to tread ground that has
been handled by artists for decades — racism is quite a common theme.
However, as the world of "Jazzing" starts to open up more and more, the
characters and their plights began to resonate and offer a meditation on
the nature of racism. "Jazzing" follows four youths in Montgomery, Ala.
in the mid-19505. Two of them, Comfort (Faradia Pierre '12) and Jeremy
(Justin Key'o9) are African-American and the resulting tension between
them and the white adults forms the backbone of the story.
The strongest parts of "Jazzing," though, are the powerful and poet
ic monologues. Most of the play is told in this manner, with characters
offering meditations on the predicaments that encircle them. The expert
direction of Alex Mallory '08 carries these scenes, giving the actors the
room to depict their inner emotional state without making them feel
contrived. On the other hand, these monologues do sometimes short
change the actual story, leaving little room to establish the dynamics
between characters. Each character has a moment to himself to flesh out
his personality, but sometimes at the expense of story flow. These mono
logues, though, are one of the primary ways in which "Jazzing" breaks
from the mold established by Southern plays of the past. One of the
stand-out lines from Jeremy was "I know it like I know the black of my
hand." This line takes a cliche and breathes new life into it, making it an
entertaining addition to the show. Sure, it makes one roll their eyes a bit,

but Key successfully sold it.
The actors, as a whole, did a
great job of making the environ-

ment feel real. Holly Rogers '10 carried the main character,
Hailey lane, through the trials and tribulations of her escapades. She was
able to straddle the line between empathy for her suffering and scorn for
her recklessness. This sort of contradiction Hows throughout the show. In
a post-show discussion, Gyasi stated that one of her goals is to show that
"nothing is black or white" and these characters were raised in a "culture
of racism." By showcasing this aspect of the society in which the charac
ters inhabit, it makes even Hailey's racist parents (Nathaniel Stockham
and Rachel Quint TO) carry at least some humanity in their actions. The
same goes for Hailey's boyfriend, Harris (Daniel Steinbock), who initial
ly seemed like a flat character, acting as a plot device to fill out the neces
sities of the story, but grew into a three-dimensional figure by the end.
"Jazzing" offers no pure villains and no pure heroes — instead, the
characters arc portrayed as victims of their time period and their circum
stances. It is a shocking change from the demonization traditionally given
to racist people. It makes the viewer pause, making them study the sort
of society that can produce these figures and what can possibly happen
to stop this cycle from its persistent repetition. It is unorthodox, but, in
the end, "Jazzing" is all the better for it.
