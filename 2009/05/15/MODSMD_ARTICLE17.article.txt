# Roble and the beast
## 
### 
Last Thursday and Friday, Roble Hall performed
Disney classic "Beauty and the Beast" to a standing
room-only crowd. Fellow residents, friends, teachers
and parents turned out in support of performers, filling
even the hallway outside Roble Theater.
"1 thought it was hilarious," said Disney Williams '12,
who attended Friday's show. "Comedic genius."
Residents took on roles as director, producer, staff,
musician and actor, and were able to do a lot with a relative
ly small number of dedicated participants. Many Stanford a
cappella groups also had representation.
Williams said her stomach hurt from laughing so hard.
"The characters sounded a lot like they did in the
Disney version, but people added their own pizzazz," she
said.
In one such moment, Aisha Ansano '12 (Mrs. Potts),
Brady Hamed '12 of the Mendicants (Lumiere) and Matt
Rubin '12 of the Harmonics (Cogsworth) burst into their
own rendition of "We're All in This Together" from "High
School Musical."
Ansano balanced the serious and comic aspects of the
Mrs. Potts role, moving audience members with her
poignant performance of "Beauty and the Beast — Tale as
Old as Time" as easily as her performance alongside Ed
Schmerling TO as Chip, her son, made everyone laugh.
"1 haven't had a lot of experience with acting before, so
I enjoyed the chance to get into a role," Ansano said. "It was
more of us all working together than being completely led
by the director, and I think this was because we were all stu
dents."
Sarah Spikes '09 and Ken Kansky '12, a member of Fleet
Street, starred as Belle and the Beast. Spikes'costume change
from conservative blue jumper to sparkly ball dress elicited
cat calls from the crowd, while Kansky's commanding stage
presence silenced the often-raucous crowd.
Along with I lamed, Chris Lewis' 12 of Mixed Company

drew a lot of laughs from the
audience as Gaston. Hamed,
sporting a delicious French
accent, shared the stage with
Rubin as worrywart
Cogsworth, while Lewis
hammed it up with sidekick
Lefou, played by Sean Tannehill
'12.
Producer Allison Portnoy
'09, who has worked with
Ram's Head and the Stanford
Drama department, said her
favorite part of the show was
when Tannehill said his first
line during the "Gaston" num
ber.
"It just felt really homey
and comfortable, like everyone

was on the same level at that moment," she said, remember
ing how the audience laughed and cheered during both
shows.
Lewis also en joyed performing "Gaston."
"I got to show Gaston's true character and exaggerate it
ridiculously," he said. "1 enjoyed assuming the personality of
a character that I've loved since childhood and sinking my
teeth into how he thinks."

According to Lewis, Gaston is not a villain.
"He's not really a typical bad guy, he's just
naive about why people don't like him," he H
laughed. "It's kind of fun to be that obtuse ]
sometimes." V
Cast and crew made do with just three ■
painted scenes — two inside the Beast's castle 1
and one of Belle's village.
Roble Resident Assistants (RAs) James Barton
1 09, Xavi Gaeta '09 and Jen Schmcrling '10 stuck
together throughout the show, first as one of Belle's
eccentric father's inventions, and later as silverware
in the Beast's castle. Roble Resident Fellow (RF) Kate

Chesley also made an appearance as a villager and member
of the chorus.
Although the pit orchestra contained only four mem
bers and stage staff counted about the same number, things
went according to plan, and very few errors were noticeable.
"Considering it was a dorm musical we put on in six
weeks, it looked amazing," Portnoy said.
"1 wanted to put on a show that that was fun for people
to be in and entertaining for their friends to watch," she
added. "I think my professional background allowed me to
help people have that experience."
