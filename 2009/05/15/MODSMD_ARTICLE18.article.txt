# The
						"Bush" AFTERMATH
## 
### 
The Spring Into Action Play Festival 2009 presented its
first showing on Wednesday to a small audience in an inti
mate setting. The festival, a production of the Stanford
Theatre Activist Mobilization Project (STAMP), is showcas
ing four different student-written plays that deal with cur
rent and past social issues. "The Bush Tree," a play written by
Jessica Cornwell '09 and directed by Alex Mallory '08, takes a
more creative approach to the STAMP motto of theatre for
progressive social change, presenting a story that alternates
between present day and a century past as it investigates the
motives behind colonization and human relationships.
The play, set in Western Australia, tells a generational
story between grandfather and grandson. James (Patrick
Davis '10) and Jane (Hannah Kopp-Yates '12), original set-

tiers of a land thick with jungle
I and haunted by old spirits and

mysteries, live in their house
in the middle of nowhere
and undergo circumstances
that test the strength of
their marriage. Two gener-

ations later, James' son
Marcus (also played by
Davis, which brings an
intriguing coherence
between the stories),

having left the Australian

wilderness 10 years before, returns on honey
moon with his new wife, Rachel (Chrysanthe Tan '09), after
having met her in San Francisco at art school. They return to
the same house where lames and Jane had once lived, and
things start to meld together as past becomes present with
the introduction of Rebecca (Liane Al-Ghusain), a mysteri
ous native girl who visits the house late one stormy night.
The entire story is framed by a child (Kendra Mitchell
'12), who begins and ends the play with a recounting of a
fairy tale about Bluebeard. The play connects thematic ele
ments through all three stories: Bluebeard, James and
Marcus. Certain motifs appear in all three stories — opening
doors, keys, etc. — that help lend continuity to the play.
Thematically, "The Bush Tree" covers a wide range of topics
without really making a grand statement on them. The play
discusses slavery, colonization, racial relations and relation
ship abuse, all within the scope of the characters in the high
ly mystical setting of Western Australia.
Since the play is a work in progress, the performance
was a staged reading — the actors sat on stage with their
scripts on music stands, standing up and moving toward the
audience when their part called for more physical move
ments. It created an ethereal atmosphere, and the audience
had to do their part to imagine the setting. After the play
ended, the writer and director came up on stage to partici
pate in a post-show discussion, again emphasizing that the
atre, especially this piece, is something that is always chang
ing and adapting to create social change.
"The Bush Tree" is playing on Friday at 8 p.m. in the
Women's Community Center. All STAMP Spring Play
Festival shows are free and open to the public.
