# The 						"Bush" AFTERMATH
## 
### 
The Spring Into Action Play Festival 2009 presented its
first showing on Wednesday to a small audience in an inti
mate setting. The festival, a production of the Stanford
Theatre Activist Mobilization Project (STAMP), is showcas
ing four different student-written plays that deal with cur
rent and past social issues. "The Bush Tree," a play written by
Jessica Cornwell '09 and directed by Alex Mallory '08, takes a
more creative approach to the STAMP motto of theatre for
progressive social change, presenting a story that alternates
between present day and a century past as it investigates the
motives behind colonization and human relationships.
The play, set in Western Australia, tells a generational
story between grandfather and grandson. James (Patrick
Davis '10) and Jane (Hannah Kopp-Yates '12), original set-

tiers of a land thick with jungle
I and haunted by old spirits and

mysteries, live in their house
in the middle of nowhere
and undergo circumstances
that test the strength of
their marriage. Two gener-

ations later, James' son
Marcus (also played by
Davis, which brings an
intriguing coherence
between the stories),

having left the Australian

wilderness 10 years before, returns on honey
moon with his new wife, Rachel (Chrysanthe Tan '09), after
having met her in San Francisco at art school. They return to
the same house where lames and Jane had once lived, and
things start to meld together as past becomes present with
the introduction of Rebecca (Liane Al-Ghusain), a mysteri
ous native girl who visits the house late one stormy night.
The entire story is framed by a child (Kendra Mitchell
'12), who begins and ends the play with a recounting of a
fairy tale about Bluebeard. The play connects thematic ele
ments through all three stories: Bluebeard, James and
Marcus. Certain motifs appear in all three stories — opening
doors, keys, etc. — that help lend continuity to the play.
Thematically, "The Bush Tree" covers a wide range of topics
without really making a grand statement on them. The play
discusses slavery, colonization, racial relations and relation
ship abuse, all within the scope of the characters in the high
ly mystical setting of Western Australia.
Since the play is a work in progress, the performance
was a staged reading — the actors sat on stage with their
scripts on music stands, standing up and moving toward the
audience when their part called for more physical move
ments. It created an ethereal atmosphere, and the audience
had to do their part to imagine the setting. After the play
ended, the writer and director came up on stage to partici
pate in a post-show discussion, again emphasizing that the
atre, especially this piece, is something that is always chang
ing and adapting to create social change.
"The Bush Tree" is playing on Friday at 8 p.m. in the
Women's Community Center. All STAMP Spring Play
Festival shows are free and open to the public.

has now become a power button. There are also now
three LED light indicators instead of the DS Lite's
two. Technically speaking, barely anything has
changed in the DSi. The speaker quality seems a
tad louder and clearer, but overall, you're not
j going to find any major changes to processing
power — this system is still meant to play DS
games, after all.
I Once you turn the system on and go through
the typical set-up process, you will notice a sig
nificant amount of internal changes. The navi
gation menu has a channel-like feel to it, more
closely resembling that of the Nintendo Wii. The
three channels worth noting are the inclusion of

a photo channel, audio channel and online
store. The photo channel is what you'd expect
— allowing you to take pictures with the DSi's
i cameras and then play around with them by
L way of goofy lens effects. At the moment
I though, this camera functionality seems more
B gimmicky than functional, as the picture
B quality is not that great, and it is also hard to
I see how these cameras can add anything
H extra to games. Keep your fingers crossed for
■ the ability to video chat with the DSi.

■ In terms of the audio channel —
similar to the photo channel — you have the
ability to record your own sounds and then play
around with them afterwards. You can also edit mp3
songs here, saved on your SL) card, as well as listen to
them, which is a nice function. Finally, and probably

most exciting, the inclusion of the DSi shop channel
screams of massive potential. Online video game
stores are already popular on the home consoles (PS3,
XBOX 360 and Wii), and Nintendo is definitely trying
to capitalize on this success with the DSi. Hardcore
fans will love to be able to download and play their
favorite retro handheld games on the new system —
which means that Gameboy Advance games can defi
nitely linger around for a few more years.
When it comes down to it, although the DSi
offers relatively minor changes to the popular system,
it does succeed in bringing the system more in line
with its equally successful Wii console system. So far,
the Wii has been able to capture a wide audience and
has been able to release software that appeals to both
the casual and hardcore gamer. With the inclusion of
a couple of new features, as well as the shop channel,
the DSi, although not revolutionary in its current
state, has massive potential to further expand
Nintendo's stranglehold on the handheld market — if
that's even possible. Now, when it comes to actually
purchasing one, if you're a casual, portable gamer that
already owns a DS Lite, you might want to wait a bit
before buying the DSi. However, if you arc a hardcore
gamer with the money to spare, the DSi is a fun pur
chase that will only get better over time.
The Nintendo DSi was released in the U.S. on April 5,
and it retails for $169.99.
