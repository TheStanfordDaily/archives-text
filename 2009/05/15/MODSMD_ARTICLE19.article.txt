# Anvil could have made it BIG
## 
### 
Director Sacha Gervasi wants us to know this from the
very start of his film, marching out a parade of heavy
metal legends to tell us how great Anvil was. This band
rocked, and the rockers we actually know are here to tell us
why. The comments from members of Guns N' Roses,
Metallica and Anthrax are part pity for Anvil's unrewarded
merit, part professional respect and part relief that they're the
talking heads at the front of the movie, rather than the subject.
On the one hand, this establishes credibility for the band,
which is useful because the band members themselves don't
earn it until late in the film. But it's also to set the possibility of
real fame clearly in the past. This is not a band struggling for a
big break; if they were going to have one, it was two decades
ago. Because we know that fame and fortune aren't in the off
ing, "Anvil: The Story of Anvil" becomes a film about one
question: How does a band like this keep going?
The answer is lead singer and guitarist Steve "Lips"
Kudlow. From the start, it's clear he's at the edge of stability,
flirting with a certain lunacy, hut also intensely charming. His
enthusiasm and his optimism never waver for very long. The
fire in his eyes, the belief that what's he doing means some
thing and that the world will finally break his way, can be sad,
but it also compels you to watch him, wondering how his
endurance has kept itself safe through decades of distortion.
The film introduces you to Lips first, and you expect to
find the other members similarly off, unable or unwilling to
give up no matter how long ago the door to rock immortality
slammed shut. Gervasi finds something far more interesting,
however, which is that most of the people involved in the band
are quite levelheaded. Drummer Robb Reiner seems to have
achieved an almost Zen calm over the years, his energy only
coming out when he plays. At home, he paints calm still-life

paintings and street landscapes. He may be
the quietest member of a heavy metal band
you'll ever see. Secondary members Glen
Gyorffy and Ivan Hurd simply look happy
to be involved, with all the wide-eyed inno-

cence of meeting their idols undiminished
by years of playing with them. Even the
hardcore fans aren't especially unhinged.
Half of these guys wouldn't draw an eye
walking down the street.

Somehow, though, Lips keeps them play
ing after two decades of middling success and slow decline.
When things go wrong, whether it's on a hellish tour of Europe
or a gig at a community center, it's always Lips who takes it the
hardest. The day after, it's Lips who is the most upbeat about
what took place. His friendship with Reiner is his anchor while
the pendulum of his emotions rises and falls, and it's a fasci
nating relationship. The two care equally about the music, and
about each other, but Lips' volatility can push the more relaxed
Reiner to the ends of his patience. Besides the length of time
they've been together, the music is what keeps them together.
What we hear of that music is the sound of unabashedly
generic metal, which gains a charm from its ferocious dou
bling-down on the most stereotypical elements of the genre.
The titles of their albums: "Metal on Metal," "Forged in Fire,"
"Strength of Steel," tell you all you need to know, doubling
down on the same concept again and again. It's an interesting
sound, if only for its purity, but if the band ever evolved, we
don't see it.
As the film moves forward and the band's hopes slip fur
ther and further out of reach, "Anvil: The Story of Anvil"
moves gleefully through the arc and expectations of the rock

documentary. But the pessimism that you feel in watching, the
worry that Lips' devotion is going to all be for naught, grows
the whole time. "How they keep going" becomes "will they,"
and it's clear that it will be up to Lips to decide. When you see
the hope in his eyes following the most modest of successes,
what you wind up watching for is whether the band will find
some reaction satisfying enough for Lips to declare a modest
victory.
To some extent, then, it's no shock that Lips finally man
ages to find something he can call success. More than anyone
else, the band is his whole reason for being, and to admit its
failure would be to give up on himself for good. What does
come as a surprise, however, is that when that victory comes,
you believe in it, too. Somewhere along the course of the film,
its wildly oscillating, fanatically devoted lead manages to do to
you what he's done to his friends and his band. 1 le makes you
believe. And when you do, the feeling rocks.
