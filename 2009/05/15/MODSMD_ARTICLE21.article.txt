# Roxy's Guide to Exotic Erotic
## 
### 
Roxy rarely needs an excuse to shed her garments, but with
temperatures heating up and Exotic Erotic fast approaching, one

need not ask twice. Twice is plenty, given the unspoken Exotic
Erotic rule of two articles of clothing for girls, one for guys.
Roxy plans to embrace this weekend like she would Fraiche

on a hot day — with lots and lots of licking.
Exotic Erotic, despite this year's elegant appellation of
Cirque D'Exotique, can't hide that fact that it's a riotous
peep show — that is, Roxy's natural habitat. With 680
Lomita's debauchery exposed for all to see, the party is a

veritable cornucopia of your favorite body paints, bare *
chests and baffled freshmen. Taking inspiration from the
party's theme, Roxy hopes to help pitch a few tents on Friday

— not of the circus persuasion.
So get ready to bring home your sweat-laden souvenirs, and with
so few clothing barriers to tie you up, it shouldn't be hard to get things

rolling. Or rocking. Whatever floats your boat. With Roxy's guidance,
you'll easily become the ringleader of your personal circus — maybe
even turning it into a three-ring threesome of your own.
And for the grand finale, Roxy introduces her complete field guide
that will help you tame the nude masses sans chair and whip. On sec
ond thought, whip optional.
1. Naked co-op'ers
If organic is your thing, look no further. These vegetarian types
may not eat meat, but they definitely know how to use it. You can
expect them to congregate in conga trains during the live shows, so feel
free to join the train and proceed front to caboose. If you're hesitant,
remember that after the fun and games, they're likely to make the bed,
clean your bathroom and cook you a little breakfast.
2. Kids with too much ci.othf.s
Who doesn't enjoy a good [clothed] challenge? Rules be damned,
these boys want to party but stick out like sore thumbs, often wearing
their polos and cargo shorts. It's not Sunsplash — that got cancelled
— it's Exotic Erotic. They probably came to see the sights, but Roxy
really just wants to see theirs; wearing clothing among naked people is
such a tease. You gott.i wonder what's hiding under that pink Lacoste
shirt. It's up to you to find out.

3. People who really should be

WEARING MORE CLOTHING
Roxy says: stay away. The delicate
balance is something that Roxy respects

almost as much as she respects the Kama
Sutra. Giving away too much is fun only if
there's something good to be given away.
That being said, beauty is in the eye of the
beholder, and let's be honest — Roxy will

behold almost everyone. However, for those
concerned, remember two things: body paint
and optical illusions. Vertical stripes are slim-

ming, and no one can see your body hair if you're
painted like a Jackson Pollack.

■ 4. OVERF.AGER FRESHMEN
Spotted traveling in herds, these freshmen come for the spectacle
but are woefully out of depth. Roxy has some advice to share: girls,
there's more to looking slutty than American Apparel onesies and
headbands. Flex your creativity: try foliage for a "greener" effect — we
all know that environmentally friendly is the new hot. As for the boys,
Roxy says if you're looking for an easy catch, look no further. At their
first Exotic Erotic, most of these boys will be too busy attempting to
drag their jaws off the floor. Here's a fun game: see how many fresh
men you can line up by the end of the night.
5. Men in uniform
As one of the biggest parties of the year, cops will promise to be in
full force to shepherd the masses. Roxy asks, "Why not?" Who doesn't
like a strong man in blue (or tan), wishing to jump in on the college
action? Roxy suggests you find the young, fit officers, complete with
handcuffs and nightstick. Roxy has had a few rides in cop cars, some
times stationary, and recommends breaking the law with officers of the
law. The back of their cars are surprisingly spacious, and it's all good
as long as you don't end up with a ticket for a noise violation or dis
turbing the peace.
