# Wicked
## 
### 
hen one considers the most classic of
Broadway musicals, the most common
ones that come to mind are shows like
"The Phantom of the Opera," "Rent" and
"The Sound of Music." The next genera
tion will certainly feel the same way about
the smash hit musical "Wicked," now
showing at the Orpheum Theatre in San
Francisco. For those that haven't seen the
play or read the book, "Wicked" tells the
story of the Wicked Witch of the West

(from"The Wizard of Oz") and shows an entirely new side to the legendary vil
lain.
The show opens with the people of Oz rejoicing the Witch's recent death
by melting, thanks to a young farm girl from Kansas. Glinda (The Good Witch)
arrives by bubble to tell the people that an age of fear is over, and an excited
townsperson asks Glinda if the rumors that Glinda and the Wicked Witch used
to be friends. The story unfolds from there.
"Wicked" is all about Elphaba, a girl who was born green but was unnat
urally gifted at sorcery. The play follows her trials as a young girl and the devel
opment of her strange and unexpected friendship with Glinda. Elphaba is
forced to overcome society's view of her skin color, and that is not the only
political undercurrent to appear in the show, as the Wizard of Oz and his
regime over the Emerald City is surprisingly corrupt. There is also a love story
involved, with Elphaba and Glinda caught in a love triangle that compromises
their friendship.
The Orpheum Theatre is a beautiful venue, and the crowd was buzzing
with excitement for the much-anticipated play. When the show finally did
begin with a powerful and attention-grabbing number, the audience was
hooked. Glinda (portrayed by Kendra Kassebaum) was absolutely hysterical,
inspiring the audience to both laugh and cry. Her vocals may not have been as
strong as expected, but her portrayal of a shallow and potentially basic charac
ter was so multi-faceted, honest and endearing that it more than made up for
her nondescript singing.
At the performance I saw, the lead role of Elphaba was being performed by

the standby, Vicki Noon. I was initially disappointed, becau
I was excited to see Teal Wicks in her starring role.
However, I had nothing to worry about because Noon
did an incredible job and blew the audience away with

her powerhouse vocals. It was astonishing to see the
amount of stage presence that she brought to
such an intense role. Her chemistry with the role
of Glinda was also so powerful — 1 was in tears at

the end because 1 believed in
their friendship so much.
Beyond the lead roles, the
rest of the cast was also
impressive, as were the sets
and costumes. There was a
lot of smoke and mirrors in
"Wicked" that kept the audi
ence ooh-ing and aah-ing all
throughout the play.
Chances are a lot of
Intermission readers have
already seen this wildly pop
ular musical, but if you
haven't, don't miss this
chance to see "Wicked," a
sure-to-be classic, at the
Orpheum Theatre.
