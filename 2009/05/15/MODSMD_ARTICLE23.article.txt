# MOVIE REVIEW
## Angels & Demons 
### 
cc Angels and Demons," the sequel to "The Da

than Vatican tunnels and Roman streets
put together. As one who would personally
rather watch "the game" than read a Dan Brown
novel, I went into the theater hoping to be enter
tained — and was I ever!
While assaults on the Catholic Church may
be offensive to some (although the Church is
portrayed as more the victim in this movie),
"Angels and Demons" is wildly entertaining and
you'll definitely get your money's worth.
Tom Hanks reprises his role from"The Da

Cardinals and the stolen, ticking time bomb.
Director Ron Howard's nuances in this film
are simply brilliant, and his detailed attention to
camera angles and lighting are masterful. Every
shot, without exception, has meaning and pur
pose. These subtleties add intensity to the
already thrilling storyline and caused this
reviewer to attack his already short fingernails.
Perhaps the one major flaw in this film is the

unpredictable curveballs arc continuously

and Demons" is a definite must-see. I give it two
slightly chewed thumbs up!
