# PAGE 2 IS ON HIATUS. INSTEAD, LET'S RECAP:
## Warning: Big spoilers ahead! 
### 
a Lost" viewers know to expect mind-bending season
finales, and Wednesday night's two-parter did not
disappoint.
Last week's episode ended with two plans: Jack made
it clear that he was going to follow through with Faraday's
plan and detonate the hydrogen bomb on the Island, and
Locke told Ben that he was going to lead the Others to
Jacob to kill him.
The results of these plans, on the surface, are
straightforward. By the end of two hours, Ben Linus
stabbed Jacob to death on Locke's orders, and a nuclear
bomb exploded when and where Jack wanted it. The det
onation led to a hide to white, and an agonizing wait for
the start of the next season.
It was a riveting episode, but it's a frustrating
cliffhanger. We want to know what's going to happen, and
what the implications of the detonation are. To its credit,
"Lost" has trained its viewers to react to the explosion of
a nuclear device by wondering where those in its vicinity
will wind up, rather than assuming they'll all die immedi
ately. But as a result, there's an uncertainty over whether
we just saw a "reset," and the very open-ended nature of
where the sixth season could go is both exciting and wor
rying in equal measure. We have no idea where this is all
heading.

And yet it's characteristic of "Lost" that answering
"what" is only the beginning of the mystery. The real cliffhang
er isn't what will happen; it's finding out the nature of what tiiil
happen. We don't know it lack succeeded in altering the course
of history, or if he merely fulfilled the inevitable. We don't
know who the man is who has inhabited Locke, why he's fight
ing with Jacob or how he found a way to end him. The stakes
are clearly high, but the mysteries are mostly a matter of inter
pretation, not prediction. We're waiting, oddly enough, to find
out what we've already seen.
There's a very real chance that the sixth season could be a
frustrating mess, and time-travel stories aren't usually good at

the endgame. The show has a lot of duels to bring to a close —
Ben vs. Widmore, Jack vs. Locke, Jacob vs. his enemy and, of
course, good vs. evil — and not a lot of time left to give them
all justice. This cliffhanger may go down as a big tease, a fake
out from a show that has run out of mysteries to conceal and
is scared to reveal the ones it has left.
But, it's worth pointing out that "Lost" has changed the
very nature of the tension we feel in watching television enter
tainment. The finale was a love letter to everything "Lost" has
accomplished in rewriting the rules of its medium, and in
changing the way we interact with the material. Even if it turns
out to be a swan song for the era when the show earned our

attention, it's one hell of a send-off.
And if you're worried about whether the show can pull it
off and bring everything in for a safe landing, I understand.
For everyone scared about number six, here's my advice: Relax,
and count to five.
