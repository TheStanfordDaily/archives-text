# MUSiC REVIEW
## Welcome to the Breakdown 
### 
Five years. That's how long it has been since Green Day's
last CD, American Idiot." So when the band announced
the imminent arrival of their new album, "21st Century
Breakdown," expectations were high. This isn't exactly surpris
ing considering "American Idiot" sold over 12 million copies
and revitalized the band's career. Thankfully, Green Day ful
filled those expectations and then some: "21st Century
Breakdown" is a masterwork, blending the punk styles that
made the band famous while charting a path into new sonic
horizons.
Green Day, comprised of Billie Joe Armstrong (vocals,
guitar, lyricist), Mike Dirnt (bass) and Tre Cool (drums), had
their start as a punk rock trio hailing from Oakland, Calif.
They reached mainstream success with their 1994 album,
"Dookie." Yes, they named their CD after poo. Despite this,
Dookie sold over 15 million copies. Each of their following
albums suffered from diminishing returns. Until after their
2001 CD, "Warning," Green Day was on the verge of collapse.
They didn't break up, though. Instead, they returned to the
studio and wrote a rock opera, "American Idiot," that was
hailed by critics and fans as one of the most important albums
of the year, if not the decade. Now, buoyed by this newfound
success, Green Day wrote "21st Century Breakdown," which
expands upon "American Idiot" in every way. It is longer,
grander and an even stronger indictment of a complacent

society that let the world crash around
them.

"Breakdown" begins sinv
ply with radio static and a

cappella vocals by
Armstrong. The lyrics
read like a prologue,
with images of bombs,
contraband, and war
>u: :..L»

where things might not \
end up alright. "Waging a
war and losing the fight."
The Beach Boys, this ain't.

This leads directly into the
title track. More than anything, this

song plays like a mix of The Who, Queen,
I he Clash, and even a dash of Bruce Springsteen,

all held together by the trademark pop-punk sen
sibilities that made Green Day famous — in other J
words, the song is fantastic and an excellent way to T
draw listeners into the album. From there, Green '
Day broadens their sound, taking in faux-Mariachi

rock ("Peacemaker" which is actually one of the
stand-outs on the album) and even Beatles-

esque love songs ("Last Night on Earth
and the opening of "Viva La Gloria!").

However, at its core, Green Day is still a
punk band and this never shined
brighter than on "Horseshoes and
1 landgrenades" which sounds like an >
amped-up version of The Hives, if ft

that's possible.
For all of their energy though, the
album does sometimes drag. I suppose I

should mention that this CD, with three acts
and 18 songs, is 69 minutes long. The second

act, Charlatans and Saints, especially has its
low points, like in "Last of the American
Girls," which while catchy and fun does not
A

measure up to the grandeur of the rest of
the CD. "Murder City" also suffers from an
incessant need to repeat the word "desper- i
ate" as many times as humanly possible, I
which detracts from the stunning imagery I
of the riots and despair that fill the rest M

of the song.
The real
heart, though,
of "21st Century
Breakdown," lies i
in its story. The J
album follows g
the two young 1
rebels, Christian
and Gloria, as
they weave their
way through the

pitfalls and the devastation left in the wake of the Bush admin
istration. Fart of what makes the story resonate so well is that
it recognizes that having President Obama in the White House
doesn't automatically solve everything. The world is still reel
ing from war, famine and disease. By the time the listener
reaches "See the Light," the final song, they are drained, angry
and scared for what the future brings. This makes this last song
all the more poignant for its message that maybe hope does
still exist, especially after the anthem-like chants of "I don't
wanna live in the modern world" in the previous song. That is
an apt message for the album itself, that even with songs like
'Murder City" and "American Eulogy" that serve as calls to the
revolution, this is not the final note Green Day leaves the lis-

tener with. Instead, they suggest that maybe the promise of
tomorrow is waiting just around the corner, that maybe all we

have to do is open our eyes and "see the light."
