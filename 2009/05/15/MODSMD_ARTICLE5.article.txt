# Nintendo DSi: Portable GAMERS GET AN UPGRADE
## 
### 
The portablegaming market is a tough sell these
days. Don't get me wrong, the kids these days are
eating handheld games up like crazy — but what
about us college-aged folk? How are we supposed to get
our video game kicks when we're waiting in line at the
post office or bored in lecture? Thankfully, Nintendo has
somewhat answered the call through the release of the
Nintendo DSi, the evolutionary successor to its widely
popular Nintedo DS system.
Now if you're the least bit video game savvy, then I
know the questions that you must have. Why say that we
college kids need a portable video game system when
there is so much out there already? Look at the Sony PSP,
the iPhone and of course the Nintendo DS Lite. What
makes the Nintendo DSi so interesting? Well, first off,
Sony's Playstation Portable (PSP), although gorgeous and
technologically brilliant, has an atrocious video game
library. Enter the iPhone. Although I will personally say
that I think Apple's wonderphone is a work of sheer
genius, not to be biased or anything (I have an iPhone), it
still fails to appease the hardcore portable video game
audience. Finally, this brings us to the Nintendo DS Lite.
Since the DS's first release in 2004, Nintendo's handheld
has quickly become the most successful handheld console
to date. The original DS, which was more of a brick then
a portable device, merely introduced this idea of dual
screen gaming. Then when the DS Lite was released, it
brought a much-needed cosmetic makeover to the sys
tem.

Even after the handheld gaming platform took off
after the release of the DS Lite, a part of me still felt like
the DS was missing something. Yes, it was supported by a
wealth of awesome games, but it still just seemed like the
system was skewed more toward the younger crowds. It is
for this very reason that Nintendo has recently decided to
update their popular system — which brings us to the

DSi.
On the outside, the DSi is not hugely different from
its predecessor. It's roughly the same weight of the Lite,
albeit noticeably thinner. Nintendo decided to forgo the
glossy plastic exterior of the Lite, adopting a matted

plastic (though I personally liked the glossy look of
the previous system). On the sides of the system,

you will notice that instead of a volume slider,

k adjustment. The three big changes to note on
