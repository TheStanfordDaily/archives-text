# Q&A: Backlight's Brad Wolfe
## 
### 
Stanford graduates don't often go on to become professional
musicians or artists, and even if they do they cannot escape
the entrepreneurial spirit that pervades the Stanford educa
tion. Intermission sat down with Brad Wolfe this week to talk
about his budding music career and his web creation and start-up,
Backlight.org.
intermission (i): What inspired you to become a professional
musician after graduating from Stanford?
Brad Wolfe (BW): When I was a junior here at Stanford one of my
best girl friends growing up who's a soccer player at Duke confid
ed in me that she'd be diagnosed with a rare form of pediatric can
cer. She came back to west coast and was placed in Stanford
Hospital. At that time, music was just a hobby to me. 1 did some
songwriting and I played at the CoHo. But when Sara was placed
in Stanford Hospital, I went over and played music for her by her
bedside. It became a really regular thing. My music became one of
the few things that bring her happiness and made her feel better
while she was battling this disease.
I wrote a song called "Sara's Got a Sunbeam." It's an anthem of
sorts that was inspired by her fight for life. She ended up passing
away during my senior year, but before she did we had some deep
conversations. She really inspired me to pursue music as a career. I
thought a lot about what she said and it was what 1 was passionate
about. 1 did my thesis in American Studies on why students don't
pursue their passions in life a lot of the time.
I stated this foundation called the "Sunbeam Foundation" to
find cures tor pediatric bone cancer simultaneously as 1 launched
my music career. That's when I started getting press and airplay on
Alice Radio and sold out the Great American Music Hall for my
CD release. Sarah Bareilles opened for me for that show. I've
played shows with Tim Reynolds from Tim Matthews Band and a
bunch of other artists. But 1 think main reason people were very
supportive of me was because of the story behind my music,
because of the story of Sara and her inspiration.
That's when I realized, really there's an inspiration behind
everything people create. When people realize the stories behind a
piece of art or creation, it becomes so much more powerful. For
example, all those pictures at the CoHo. You may judge them or
dismiss them, but if you knew the context behind them — the
back!ightbehind something — that picture becomes a lot more
personal, interesting, and meaningful.

"We want Backlight to
BE FULL OF ARTIFACTS AND
STORIES — A REPOSITORY
OF INSPIRATIONAL ARTI
FACTS. It's not just
ABOUT THE THINGS THEM
SELVES BY WHY PEOPLE
CARE ABOUT THEM."

intermission (i): What inspired you to create Backlight?
BW: Backlight was conceived about 3 years ago: I'm interested in
inspiration and creativity. Communication has become more
abundant but at the same time, more meaningless. We're looking
for more meaning online where people can share inspiration, art,
and all the normal things that people don't share.
On campus, so many people are creative who aren't necessar
ily art majors or involved formally in the arts. What do they do
with their creativity? It sits there latent. I think there should be a
way to express that sort of creativity. We want to capture the cre
ative community, build a home for the artist in everyone.
(i): Did you create Backlight alone or who's helped you in this
start-up?
BW: I have two partners. Jonathan Lipps and I both are Stanford
grads, art affair performers, have our own bands, and both play
shows. He worked in Africa for an organization called Hope Runs
after graduation. He also works for Inside Facebook, this big
Facebook blog. We both believe in creativity and meaning.
The other partner is Katie Bernacchi who went to UCLA and
is a graphic artist.
Backlight was my idea originally. Jonathan is the creativity officer
and Katie is the graphic design person.
(i): For those ot us who are still unfamiliar with Backlight, can you
describe to us what it is?
BW: It's an interactive online museum. All artists in Stanford com
munity are welcome on Backlight. Artists can post creations or
inspirations and people can read why these other people were
inspired to create those things. It's kind of like a social networking
website but based around creativity.
At Backlight, people can post anything creative, beyond the
normal definition of art. Creativity can extend to a photograph
you just took of your friends, a thought, a quote that inspired you,
or a brief snippet of a song.
It s more of a hub of creativity We hope to make it the largest
space of creativity and inspiration in the world.
We also want to focus on the stories behind these things,
whether art or inspirations, that people post. There might be bet
ter sites and forums online for specific art, but at those places peo
pie don t explain the inspiration behind the creation. We want
Backlight to be full of artifacts and stories — a repository of inspi
rational artifacts. It's not just about the things themselves by why
people care about them.
(i): How are you funding this?
BW: Were actually a start-up. We have a bit of Angel Funding.
