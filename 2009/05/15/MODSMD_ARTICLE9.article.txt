The Inspiration Behind Every Creation

We're about to start seeking more funding. Right now it's been like a project. We've been
doing it ourselves. We're looking for more dpvelopers to build and expand. This summer we
got someone from Stanford interning with us. We're excited to have her with us.
(i): Where do you plan on taking Backlight in the future?
BW: At the moment we're super under-the-radar. We decided we'd start at Stanford and go
from there. Our official launch maybe not be for a few months. There's no set timetable, but
Stanford students can get on it right now and sign up with a Stanford account.
We're actually already on post the Stanford art pages. Stanfordart.stanford.edu has post
ed our widgest all over their website — before it just had some outdated documentation of
artwork by Stanford students. SOCA is also using our widgets on their websites.
We just started working with Santa Clara University as well. Professors can create an
online portfolio of all the things that students in their class create, whether it's a poetry class,
a photo course, whatever. Our goal is to build creative community in the world. There's a lot
more beauty and creativity if you know where to look. We're starting at Stanford and Santa
Clara, but we're planning on reaching out to Berkeley and Harvard as well.
Eventually we do plan on opening this out to everyone in the world. At the moment, if
you open an account with your Stanford email you immediately join the Stanford network.
Universities and groups will be able to create galleries. We devised widgets that allow you to
take your gallery anywhere on the internet. Classes, departments, groups of friends can all cre
ate their own galleries.
(i): It seems like Backlight will be keeping you very busy. Are you planning on continuing to
develop your music career?
BW: Backlight is a big commitment. My goal in music is to make people feel a certain way and
be inspired to see the beauty in life. Backlights purpose is to do the same thing. I'll still be
playing music, we're actually recording a new album pretty soon. Creating a hub for other

peoples' creativity is part of the journey of life. My music career won't
be affected,
I like empowering people to feel a certain way. Backlight does that
better than anything else. Yeah, I'm going to keep forging ahead with
music. Hopefully I'll soon be putting on shows with people from
Backlight — I've found a lot of cool artists through the website. You
know, people are falling in love after meeting each other on Backlight
already.
Only put online starting this year at Art Affair. First time we
showcased. Testing a little bit. First time allowed normal people to
use the site. Few weeks ago. Gratifying is the response to Art Affair
was really positive. Fact now the Santa Clara wants to use it now too.
Most gratifying thing. Over time people start discovering things, even
more exciting. lust a kernel of where we want to be.
(i): This year you worked in conjunction with SOCA at this year's Art
Affair. What was your role?
BW: This year we took photographs of all the student art that was
presented at Art Affair and put it right on the site. It was really the
first time we showcased something on and allowed normal people to
use Backlight. We wanted to create a way for audiences to remember
what they saw at Art Affair — but it's also a way for artists to help
themselves as well. All the student groups have been really supportive
— Bria Long, Megan Miller and Sarah Woodward all were really
instrumental in getting this facilitated at Stanford. It's gratifying
because we got a really positive response from Art Affair.
(i): What do you think about the art scene at here at Stanfod?
BW: Jonathan and I were students here. There are so many talented
people at Stanford, but there' not really an outlet and a non-judg

mental space for people to show their creativity. Everyone has amazing stuff — drawings,
essays, music — from high school that are inspirational but no one ever reads . We're con

On the Stanford homepage there's a video of President Hennessy talking about the
importance of creativity at Stanford. But in many ways, Stanford pushes kids towards more
structured, less creativity things.
That's what we're trying to address. I was president of my class here and this issue was
part of what 1 really cared about. 1 want people to go onto our site and realize how creative
