# Pith and Pleonasm
## Pomp and (a very idealized) circumstance 
### 
As a fan of equal rights and the I S
Constitution, our upcoming com
mencement speaker probably would
n't have been my first choice for the job. al
though he's very distinguished, and has cer
tainly accomplished way more in an objective
sense than I will have 50 years from June 14.
However, since realizing that writing a col
umn criticizing the commencement speaker
choice of my school would be beyond obnox
ious, even for me. I decided to quote my way
to an idealized commencement speech in
stead. So:
i<< the graduating (la« of2OOV. ..
What can I say to people who know al
most everything? I here was a time when I
surely knew, because I'd just graduated
from college myself, after writing down the
sum of all human knowledge on exams and
research papers. Of course, the main re
quirement of speeches like this is talking
about your liberal arts education's meaning,
to trv to explain why the degree you are
about to receive has actual human value in
stead of just a material payoff. What do you
take with you from here? A story, a formula,
maybe a handshake, a special encounter, a
friendship. What will remain.except a diplo
ma? Much must remain, because when two
persons meet, a mystery is born, lake that
mystery and respect it.and it possible,invest
it with more meaning, with more miraculous
significance.
I hc world outside is a cold world, a cyni
cal world. I'm in no way an optimist. Opti
mism is a notion that there's sufficient evi
dence that would allow us to infer that if we
keep doing what we're doing, things will get
better. I don't believe that. I'm a prisoner of
hope that's something else. Now each of
you will have the chance to make your own
discovery in the years to come. And I say
"chance" because ... you won't have to take
it. There's no community service require
ment in the outside world, no one forcing you
to care You can take your diploma, walk off

this stage and chase after the big house and
the nice suits and the other things that our
money culture says you should buy.
Mul what matters is not the perception,
nor the fashion, nor who's up and who's
down, but what someone has done and if they
meant it. What matters is that you want to see
and make and do, on as grand a scale as you
want, regardless of what the tins voices of
tiny people say.
Do not be critics, you people. I beg you. I
was a critic and I wish I could take it all back
because it came from a smelly and ignorant
place in me. and spoke with a voice that was
all rage and envy. I)o not dismiss a book until
you have written one. and do not dismiss a
movie until you have made one. and do not
dismiss a person until you have met them. It
is an |expletive]load of work to be open
minded and generous and understanding
and forgiving and accepting, but ( hrist. that
is what matters
So worship power: You will end up feeling
weak and afraid.and you will need ever more
power over others to numb you to your own
fear. Worship your intellect: being seen as
smart, you will end up feeling stupid, a fraud,
always on the verge of being found out. But
the insidious thing about these forms of wor
ship is not that they're e\il or sinful, it's that
they're unconscious. ITiey are default set
tings. Ihey're the kind ol worship you |iist
gradually slip into, day after day. getting
more and more selective about what you see
and how you measure value without ever
being fully aware that that's what you're
doing.
TTie really important kind of freedom in
volves attention and awareness and disci
pline.and being able to truly care about other
people and to sacrifice foi them over and over
in a myriad of petty, unsexy ways every day.
Ilia! is real freedom lliat is being educated,
and understanding how to think Hie alterna
live is unconsciousness, the default setting,
the rat race, the constant gnawing sense of
having had. and lost, some infinite thing.

Ami of course, you're general, hut you're
also specific. A citizen and a person, and the
person you are is like nohody else on the
planet. Nohody has the exact memory that
you have. What is now known is not all what
you are capable of knowing. You are your
own stories and therefore free to imagine
and experience what it means to he human
without wealth — what it feels like to he
human without domination over others,
without reckless arrogance, without fear of
others unlike you. without rotating, rehears
ing and reinventing the hatreds you learned
in the sandbox. And although you don't have
complete control over the narrative (no au
thor does. I can tell you), you could never
theless create it.
Although you will never fully know or
successfully manipulate the characters who
surface or disrupt your plot, you can respect
the ones who do by paying them close atten
tion and doing them justice The theme you
choose m.t\ change or simply elude you. but
being your own story means you can always
choose the tone. It also means that you can
invent the language to say who you are and
what you mean.
But then. I am a teller of stories ... a be
liever in the ethical bend ol the human heart,
a believer in the mind's disgust with fraud
and its appetite for truth.a believer in the fe
rocity of beauty. So. from my point of view,
which is that ol a storyteller, i see your life as
already artful, waiting, just waiting and
ready for you to make it art
I wish vou all wav more than luck
