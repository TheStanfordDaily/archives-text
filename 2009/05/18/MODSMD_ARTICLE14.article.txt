# Card baseball still fighting
## 
### 
Incredibly, unbelievably, they're
still alive. If you were like me. a
couple of weeks ago, and essential
ly wrote off Stanford baseball's
chances in 2009.1 have to believe that all
but the most die-hard of Cardinal fanat
ics would forgive you. Back on May 1,
Stanford lost the first game of its three
game series on the road at Washington
State 3-1 .T he outcome dropped the Car
dinal to 20-19 overall and K-ll in an
overcrowded Pacific-10 Conference.
The Cardinal defeat with less than a
month left to play seemed to be one of
the final nails in the coffin — sealing, or
nearly so. the team's fate as a postseason
afterthought in 2009, just one year after
a trip to the College World Series in
Omaha.
But if you thought that, you were
wrong. Stanford has responded in a big
way. winning nine of its next 12 to im
prove to 29-22 and 12-12 in conference

play. It's an amazing run that has been
just enough to keep the team's hopes
alive after a disheartening April.
There is still, obviously, plenty on the
line. With just four regular season games
left to plav. Stanford still finds itself in
sixth place in the conference, but with a
golden opportunity to move up at least
one spot against fifth place Oregon
State next weekend. Who knows
whether or not a strong finish will be
enough to get the team to the postsea
son? But, at the very least, if the team
finishes strong, it will have a chance.
And that's better than most expected.
It's a shame to say. but if you were
placing odds on it. all that hard work the
Cardinal has put in still might not be
enough to get the job done. As I've men
tioned in a previous column, any time a
team needs to sweep to advance, it's a
tall order.
But in sports, sometimes the joy is in

the journey. And at the very least, this
team has now given its fans a journey to
remember. Whether or not Stanford's
late-season push is enough to carry it
across the finish line, it's heen better
than mediocre — it's been memorable.
And it's been building to the kind of fin
ish — as the team relies more and more
on young players, and gains increasing
confidence in its ability to rally — that
should only carry it forward into future
seasons. The Cardinal might not get its
chance at a title this season, but this late
season push has assured ramifications
for the future. The young stars of today
will be able to carry the charge forward

Look no further than the Cardi
nal rotation, led by freshman Brett
Mooneyham (who threw his first
eareer complete game against
USC on Saturday, racking up 11
strikeouts), for your hope for 2010.
Look no further than sophomore
rightfielder Kellen Kiilsgaard,
who has developed into the middle
of the order bat that the team will
most definitely need going for
ward, especially as senior Brent
Milleville graduates this year.
Look no further than other sopho
mores like Zach Jones and Jake
Schlander, solid position players
who could be due to break out at
the plate.The Cardinal of 2010 are
likely to be a veteran, experienced
squad, led by players who were
young when the Cardinal made its
drive to Omaha last season, but
now old enough to lead a new crop
of youngsters on the Farm them
selves.
To be sure, some key pieces will
be missing. Along with Milleville,
senior outfielder Joey August
helped provide some key veteran
leadership for this year's squad —
indeed, Kiilsgaard has credited
working with August in batting
practice for much of his improve
ment at the plate this year. Star
sophomore closer Drew Storen is
draft eligible, and may well be the
first college reliever selected in
June. If that were to be the case,
one would imagine there's a very
good chance he could go pro. Ju
nior outfielder Toby Gerhart
could, conceivably, return to play
football and decide to head to the
NFL rather than play one more
season of baseball on the Farm.
But even with those departures,
the Cardinal's recent record leaves
no doubt about it: Stanford's
young core has arrived, and it's
here to stay.
And yes, while you're looking
ahead to 2010, remember that
2009's team is still alive. Despite
everything this year has thrown at
it.
