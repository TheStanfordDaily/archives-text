Despite striking first with an impressive win in doubles competition, the No. 1 3 Stanford women's
tennis team was unable to prevail, losing to No. 4 Baylor in a Round of 1 6, late-night thriller, 4 3
senior Jessica Nguyen dropped a 4-6,6-
36-1 decision to Jelena Stanivuk.
Nguyen, playing in her last colle
giate dual match, is the last remaining
player from Stanford's 2006 national
championship team.
"I'm sure [Nguyen] was disappoint
ed," Forood said."We didn't talk about
it in those terms because we had to go
over and watch three other matches.
I'm sure she's not happy and disap
pointed with the results."
Barte salvaged the top-three singles
with an expected 6-1, 7-5 straight set
victory over Taylor Ormond.
"Hilary's been doing it all season so
we're not surprised when she gets a win."
Forood said. "She was very solid against
Ormand. and getting off in straight sets
was really important for us."
With the score tied 2-2, the match
would depend on the depth of both
teams.
"By winning two out of the three
matches really nullified any advantage
after the doubles point," Forood said.
"There's a different dynamic when you
don't put out everyone out at once."

Baylor took the 3-2 lead as sopho
more Carolyn McVeigh dropped a 7-
6(2), 6-2 decision to Nina Secerbegov
ic. Hansen would later tie up the match
with a gutsy 1-6,6-3,6-3 performance.
"It wasn't a good start for her, but
she really regrouped and did what she
had to do," Forood said of Hansen.
"She served quite well in the third set
and dominated it a bit."
The match came down to the final
court at N0.4 with Li and Baylor's Csil
la Borsanyi. After nearly seven hours
of play. Borsanyi would prevail 4-6.6-2,
6-4 to clinch the match for the Lady
Bears.
In the end. the match had drained
the best of both teams.
"Nobody felt good," Forood said.
"Even the people who won didn't feel
good when it was all over. It couldn't
have been any tighter as a match."
With a surreal loss at 2 a.m.. the Car
dinal women were left stunned.
"We were all kind of like." I can't be
lieve this just happened,'" Forood said.
"They're a really good team, so it's not
like we thought they would be easy to
beat. But, after it's that close, it's like.
'Wow. I can't believe it came down to
that one,' but it did."
With the loss, the question of "what
if?" comes to mind had the power out
age not occurred. When asked about

the possibility.Forood gave much cred
it to the Baylor squad.
"I don't know." Forood said when
asked about playing Baylor in a regular
match."They match up pretty well with
us. They've got a bunch of big, strong
girls and these courts were played pret
ty well for them. They were just a little
too much for us."
While it might take some time to get
over the loss, Stanford still has the indi
vidual championships left in their sea
son. Barte will represent the Cardinal
in the singles field, while two doubles
teams will compete for Stanford in the
bracket.
In spite of the results of the match.
Stanford has certainly grown leaps and
bounds over the course of the season.
What once was an unsure team with
out an identity matured into a squad
expected to contend for the champi
onship despite its low seeding.
"We had a lot of growth this year as
a young team." Forood said. "People
had to find their way a little bit. we had
to come together and do different
things with our doubles. We just ran
into a team that's pretty good.and we'll
see how far they go as this tournament
goes on."

good when it was all over. It couldn't
have been any tighter as a match."
With a surreal loss at 2 a.m.. the Car
dinal women were left stunned.
"We were all kind of like." I can't be
lieve this just happened,'" Forood said.
"They're a really good team, so it's not
like we thought they would be easy to
beat. But, after it's that close, it's like.
'Wow. I can't believe it came down to
that one,' but it did."
With the loss, the question of "what
if?" comes to mind had the power out
age not occurred. When asked about

the possibility.Forood gave much cred
it to the Baylor squad.
"I don't know." Forood said when
asked about playing Baylor in a regular
match."They match up pretty well with
us. They've got a bunch of big, strong
girls and these courts were played pret
ty well for them. They were just a little
too much for us."
While it might take some time to get
over the loss, Stanford still has the indi
vidual championships left in their sea
son. Barte will represent the Cardinal
in the singles field, while two doubles
teams will compete for Stanford in the
bracket.
In spite of the results of the match.
Stanford has certainly grown leaps and
bounds over the course of the season.
What once was an unsure team with
out an identity matured into a squad
expected to contend for the champi
onship despite its low seeding.
"We had a lot of growth this year as
a young team." Forood said. "People
had to find their way a little bit. we had
to come together and do different
things with our doubles. We just ran
into a team that's pretty good.and we'll
see how far they go as this tournament
goes on."
