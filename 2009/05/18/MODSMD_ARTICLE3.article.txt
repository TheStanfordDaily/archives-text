# "You can't bank on budget cuts, you can't bank on the economy going downhill,"
## FAGAN HARRIS, former ASSU Vice President Execs look back on time in office 
### CHRISTINE MCFADDEN MARISA LANDICHO SENIOR STAFF WRITERS 
When they were elected last spring, former
ASSIJ Executives Jonny Dorsey 09 and Fagan
Harris '09 pledged to change the issues that
dominate student government from bike light
giveaways to bigger issues, like sustainability
and public service. Theirs was to be a transfor
mational term at the head of the ASSU —
Dorsey and Harris hoped that their changed
attitude to student government would last for
years at Stanford, and maybe even translate to
other schools.

One year later, there is evidence that the
efforts of Dorsey and Harris to change the
tone of student government at Stanford have
been successful. The Executive slate candi
dates in this year's elections made big. public
service-oriented issues a focus of their cam
paigns. and Dorsey and Harris* endorsed team
of David Gobaud 'OS M.S. '10 and Jay de la
Torre '10 won the election.
But the accomplishments of Dorsey and
Harris within the issues they hoped to address
are not as obvious. In an interview with The
Daily, they claimed successes in three cate
gories— campus health, sustainability, public
service — while thev admitted thev had not

accomplished as much as they had hoped to in
diversity issues.
Dorsey and Harris entered office with a
platform packed with initiatives for a number
of key issues.
But events in their first quarter as
Executives overloaded their already packed
agenda.
"You can't bank on budget cuts, you can't
bank on the economy going downhill." Harris
raid. "You can't really even appreciate the time
and effort it takes in a national and state elec
tion."
Breaking ground in advocacy outside of the
University, both Executives were proud of

their efforts in fighting Proposition 8. Their
ASSU-backed phone hank was the largest in
the state. Dorsey noted.
Dorsey and Harris had more trouble,
though, in dealing with the "unprecedented"
economic crisis.
Harris admitted that their method of town
halls was perhaps ineffective at soliciting stu
dent feedback. Ir a conservative estimate, he
said around S(H) students were involved in the
process, but still pointed to some victories.
"At the very least, the symbolic gesture of
student involvement and the importance of
student voice was successful," Harris
said.
Student Wellness
The former Executives cited the
new Wellness Room in Old Union as
their most tangible achievement in
student health. The room is intended
to be a stress-free space open to all
students.
With the Wellness Room in oper
ation for only four months now, both
Dorsey and Harris acknowledged
that there were still aspects that
could be improved.
Despite the flaws, they main
tained that there has also been
increased awareness of campus
health, reflected in the tone shift in
leadership rhetoric.
"If you just look at the platforms
of the 60-plus Senate candidates
running and Executives running this
past year, I think that's evidence of a
dramatic shift in tone," Dorsey said.
"Now, it's a priority for people who
want to be leaders in student advo
cacy."
Sustainahility
Dorsey and Harris made sustain
ahility issues a focus of their term,
and they pointed to the establish
ment of the Stanford Green Store as
a big success in this area.
"3,200 cups were delivered just
this week," Harris said of the Green
Store's compostable cups. "That's
not an easy thing to do. It requires a
sophisticated, tough-out approach.
Human capital alone is really incred
ible stuff."
Harris also noted that it was not
just the number of cups distributed
that made a difference, but the com
munity of people gathered to deliver
them, showing support for sustain
ability, that was the primary gain.
Broader sustainability advocacy,
however, was difficult for the pair.
"We haven't seen the kinds of
results for sustainability from the
University that we'd really like,"
Harris said. "In context, in terms of
the budget year, they have a lot on
their plate."
Public service
Dorsey and Harris both alluded
to a new culture of service estab
lished during their time in the
ASSU; they highlighted the public

service summit as a great success
during the year. However, they said
that what is more important in rela
tion to the summit is how it develops
in years to come.
"It's not about what happens in
one year," Harris said. "While the
summit is cool and we get a lot of
credit for that, it doesn't matter if the
next steps don't happen."
Another public service program
they stressed was the tutoring of
staff children.
"How silly is it to have a school of
education and not be tutoring the
kids of our staff?," Dorsey said. "It's
appalling."
"We have all this human capital,
all this potential, all of this ability,"
Harris added. "What happens if we
leverage that to benefit someone
besides ourselves, if we created a
vehicle of service? We have a lot to
give, we just need the opportunity to
give."
Dorsey addressed the issue of
public service skepticism, and how
important it is to overcome it when
we live in a culture that's self-cen
tered.
"For years to come, this kind of
culture of service, this mindset of
service, will continue to permeate
the ASSU," Harris said.
Diversity
Dorsey and Harris noted accom
plishments among several diversity
issues, chief being the diverse repre
sentation at town hall meetings, the
diversity within their Executive cab
inet and the diversity of input in
budget cut advocacy.
Harris noted that Dorsey was
able to have an impact, although he
is not a minority.
"There's this conception that if
you have a white Executive that
they're just going to tune out,"
Harris said. "It's as much impressive
that Jonny, a white guy that lives in a
fraternity, had influence and sway
and was an equal member in diverse
conversations as in the Community
Collaboration Fund."
Additionally, both pointed out
that achievements were made
despite working with a very diverse
group of people.
"Even in the Senate, which is a
micro-chasm, I'm very pleased to
say that not only have we gotten
more legislation passed than any
other Executive in recent history —
if not the history of the ASSU —
but we did so with 15 'no votes,'"
Harris said.
"That diverse body, which some

administrators say is the most
diverse they've seen in 30 years,
passed a lot unanimously," he
added.
Harris, however, acknowledged
that not as much was accomplished
as he had hoped.
"Did we get everything we want
ed to on diversity done? No." he
said. "I really wanted to do a lot
more on class and socioeconomic
stuff. But to be honest, that's how we
got to budget cuts."
The good and the had
The former Executives were
quick to say that their favorite part
of their term was the quality and
quantity of people they were able to
meet and work with. Although there
were too many to name, they speci
fied the freshman class and the aver
age Stanford student as people they
were impressed with.
"Stanford students are more
engaged than given credit for. as evi
denced by phone banks, voter regis
trations, etc.," Harris said. "There's
some real talent coming up. and
that's exciting."
As for their least favorite aspect
of their term, they cited the narrow
window of time granted for their
term.
"It's rare to have a leadership
role that lasts for only one year,"
Dorsey said. "That influences a lot
of what you can do. Your strategy
has to be fully wrapped up in the
reality that you only have one year
and what we can do in that time. It's
hard; it's a sprint."
Dorsey added that it's difficult to
get invested in issues what will
potentially not be resolved or make
substantial progress in just one year.
Both Executives frequently men
tioned their one year term as a
source of frustration, but were
happy that they had taken the first
steps in "changing the tone" of the
student body.
Dorsey said the biggest adminis-

trative challenge of his year was
communication, mentioning the
poor attendance to their roaming
office hours during fall quarter.
"I think we really improved a lot
over our tenure, but I think we could
have done better," he said.
On the other hand. Harris cited
his main difficulty as "working with
in the bureaucratic machine" within
their limited time frame.
Both Execs expressed personal
frustration in dealing with the issue
of sexual assault, an area that they
would have liked to see more
progress in.
"The hardest part was talking to
individuals who had been assaulted, or
who had at least told stories of being
assaulted, on campus," Dorsey said.
"To me. it is appalling that this happens
at Stanford University. It's frustrating
to know that we're nowhere near
where we need to be on that front."

Post-Executive
Next year. Dorsey and Harris will
be leaving the ASSU office for life
outside of Stanford. Following up on
his strong public service back
ground. Dorsey will be relocating to
New York to work for Global Health
Corps, a nonprofit he co-founded.
He will be building up the organiza
tion's fellowship program, which will
send recent graduates to different
locations to promote global health.
Harris will remain in the area to
work for a clean technology start-up.
The two say they will continue to
offer advice to current Executives
Gobaud and de la Torre. Dorsey
advised the new office-holders to
"focus on the issues that matter."
"1 think the ASSU in general has
to believe in its own power." he said.
"What that calls for is focusing on
the big picture."
Harris was also complimentary of

the former cabinet, and noted that
the Executives' tenure laid the
groundwork for the new Executives.
"I think really great people
applied simply because we had a
great year," Harris said. "These guys
are coming in. and it's just so much
easier than back in our day."
Reflecting on their term, the for
mer Executives acknowledged that,
while accomplishing a lot. not every
platform goal was met.
"Realistically, after you're elect
ed, you have about six months, that's
about all," Harris said. "That's not a
lot of time, and I think, given that, we
did OK. We've had both successes
and failures, certainly, and in each
success, we've had a lot of failures
along the way to that, too."

while accomplishing a lot. not every
platform goal was met.
"Realistically, after you're elect
ed, you have about six months, that's
about all," Harris said. "That's not a
lot of time, and I think, given that, we
did OK. We've had both successes
and failures, certainly, and in each
success, we've had a lot of failures
along the way to that, too."

When they were elected last spring, former
ASSIJ Executives Jonny Dorsey 09 and Fagan
Harris '09 pledged to change the issues that
dominate student government from bike light
giveaways to bigger issues, like sustainability
and public service. Theirs was to be a transfor
mational term at the head of the ASSU —
Dorsey and Harris hoped that their changed
attitude to student government would last for
years at Stanford, and maybe even translate to
other schools.

One year later, there is evidence that the
efforts of Dorsey and Harris to change the
tone of student government at Stanford have
been successful. The Executive slate candi
dates in this year's elections made big. public
service-oriented issues a focus of their cam
paigns. and Dorsey and Harris* endorsed team
of David Gobaud 'OS M.S. '10 and Jay de la
Torre '10 won the election.
But the accomplishments of Dorsey and
Harris within the issues they hoped to address
are not as obvious. In an interview with The
Daily, they claimed successes in three cate
gories— campus health, sustainability, public
service — while thev admitted thev had not

accomplished as much as they had hoped to in
diversity issues.
Dorsey and Harris entered office with a
platform packed with initiatives for a number
of key issues.
But events in their first quarter as
Executives overloaded their already packed
agenda.
"You can't bank on budget cuts, you can't
bank on the economy going downhill." Harris
raid. "You can't really even appreciate the time
and effort it takes in a national and state elec
tion."
Breaking ground in advocacy outside of the
University, both Executives were proud of

their efforts in fighting Proposition 8. Their
ASSU-backed phone hank was the largest in
the state. Dorsey noted.
Dorsey and Harris had more trouble,
though, in dealing with the "unprecedented"
economic crisis.
Harris admitted that their method of town
halls was perhaps ineffective at soliciting stu
dent feedback. Ir a conservative estimate, he
said around S(H) students were involved in the
process, but still pointed to some victories.
"At the very least, the symbolic gesture of
student involvement and the importance of
student voice was successful," Harris
said.
Student Wellness
The former Executives cited the
new Wellness Room in Old Union as
their most tangible achievement in
student health. The room is intended
to be a stress-free space open to all
students.
With the Wellness Room in oper
ation for only four months now, both
Dorsey and Harris acknowledged
that there were still aspects that
could be improved.
Despite the flaws, they main
tained that there has also been
increased awareness of campus
health, reflected in the tone shift in
leadership rhetoric.
"If you just look at the platforms
of the 60-plus Senate candidates
running and Executives running this
past year, I think that's evidence of a
dramatic shift in tone," Dorsey said.
"Now, it's a priority for people who
want to be leaders in student advo
cacy."
Sustainahility
Dorsey and Harris made sustain
ahility issues a focus of their term,
and they pointed to the establish
ment of the Stanford Green Store as
a big success in this area.
"3,200 cups were delivered just
this week," Harris said of the Green
Store's compostable cups. "That's
not an easy thing to do. It requires a
sophisticated, tough-out approach.
Human capital alone is really incred
ible stuff."
Harris also noted that it was not
just the number of cups distributed
that made a difference, but the com
munity of people gathered to deliver
them, showing support for sustain
ability, that was the primary gain.
Broader sustainability advocacy,
however, was difficult for the pair.
"We haven't seen the kinds of
results for sustainability from the
University that we'd really like,"
Harris said. "In context, in terms of
the budget year, they have a lot on
their plate."
Public service
Dorsey and Harris both alluded
to a new culture of service estab
lished during their time in the
ASSU; they highlighted the public

service summit as a great success
during the year. However, they said
that what is more important in rela
tion to the summit is how it develops
in years to come.
"It's not about what happens in
one year," Harris said. "While the
summit is cool and we get a lot of
credit for that, it doesn't matter if the
next steps don't happen."
Another public service program
they stressed was the tutoring of
staff children.
"How silly is it to have a school of
education and not be tutoring the
kids of our staff?," Dorsey said. "It's
appalling."
"We have all this human capital,
all this potential, all of this ability,"
Harris added. "What happens if we
leverage that to benefit someone
besides ourselves, if we created a
vehicle of service? We have a lot to
give, we just need the opportunity to
give."
Dorsey addressed the issue of
public service skepticism, and how
important it is to overcome it when
we live in a culture that's self-cen
tered.
"For years to come, this kind of
culture of service, this mindset of
service, will continue to permeate
the ASSU," Harris said.
Diversity
Dorsey and Harris noted accom
plishments among several diversity
issues, chief being the diverse repre
sentation at town hall meetings, the
diversity within their Executive cab
inet and the diversity of input in
budget cut advocacy.
Harris noted that Dorsey was
able to have an impact, although he
is not a minority.
"There's this conception that if
you have a white Executive that
they're just going to tune out,"
Harris said. "It's as much impressive
that Jonny, a white guy that lives in a
fraternity, had influence and sway
and was an equal member in diverse
conversations as in the Community
Collaboration Fund."
Additionally, both pointed out
that achievements were made
despite working with a very diverse
group of people.
"Even in the Senate, which is a
micro-chasm, I'm very pleased to
say that not only have we gotten
more legislation passed than any
other Executive in recent history —
if not the history of the ASSU —
but we did so with 15 'no votes,'"
Harris said.
"That diverse body, which some

administrators say is the most
diverse they've seen in 30 years,
passed a lot unanimously," he
added.
Harris, however, acknowledged
that not as much was accomplished
as he had hoped.
"Did we get everything we want
ed to on diversity done? No." he
said. "I really wanted to do a lot
more on class and socioeconomic
stuff. But to be honest, that's how we
got to budget cuts."
The good and the had
The former Executives were
quick to say that their favorite part
of their term was the quality and
quantity of people they were able to
meet and work with. Although there
were too many to name, they speci
fied the freshman class and the aver
age Stanford student as people they
were impressed with.
"Stanford students are more
engaged than given credit for. as evi
denced by phone banks, voter regis
trations, etc.," Harris said. "There's
some real talent coming up. and
that's exciting."
As for their least favorite aspect
of their term, they cited the narrow
window of time granted for their
term.
"It's rare to have a leadership
role that lasts for only one year,"
Dorsey said. "That influences a lot
of what you can do. Your strategy
has to be fully wrapped up in the
reality that you only have one year
and what we can do in that time. It's
hard; it's a sprint."
Dorsey added that it's difficult to
get invested in issues what will
potentially not be resolved or make
substantial progress in just one year.
Both Executives frequently men
tioned their one year term as a
source of frustration, but were
happy that they had taken the first
steps in "changing the tone" of the
student body.
Dorsey said the biggest adminis-

trative challenge of his year was
communication, mentioning the
poor attendance to their roaming
office hours during fall quarter.
"I think we really improved a lot
over our tenure, but I think we could
have done better," he said.
On the other hand. Harris cited
his main difficulty as "working with
in the bureaucratic machine" within
their limited time frame.
Both Execs expressed personal
frustration in dealing with the issue
of sexual assault, an area that they
would have liked to see more
progress in.
"The hardest part was talking to
individuals who had been assaulted, or
who had at least told stories of being
assaulted, on campus," Dorsey said.
"To me. it is appalling that this happens
at Stanford University. It's frustrating
to know that we're nowhere near
where we need to be on that front."

Post-Executive
Next year. Dorsey and Harris will
be leaving the ASSU office for life
outside of Stanford. Following up on
his strong public service back
ground. Dorsey will be relocating to
New York to work for Global Health
Corps, a nonprofit he co-founded.
He will be building up the organiza
tion's fellowship program, which will
send recent graduates to different
locations to promote global health.
Harris will remain in the area to
work for a clean technology start-up.
The two say they will continue to
offer advice to current Executives
Gobaud and de la Torre. Dorsey
advised the new office-holders to
"focus on the issues that matter."
"1 think the ASSU in general has
to believe in its own power." he said.
"What that calls for is focusing on
the big picture."
Harris was also complimentary of

the former cabinet, and noted that
the Executives' tenure laid the
groundwork for the new Executives.
"I think really great people
applied simply because we had a
great year," Harris said. "These guys
are coming in. and it's just so much
easier than back in our day."
Reflecting on their term, the for
mer Executives acknowledged that,
while accomplishing a lot. not every
platform goal was met.
