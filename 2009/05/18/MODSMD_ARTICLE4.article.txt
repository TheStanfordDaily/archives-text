by five Cardinal runs posted in the sixth.

Alissa I laber. 1 laber was 3-4 with a double at the plate.
Freshman Ashley Hansen followed suit with a 3-4.

Hansen combined for six RBI. and finished the weekend

same types of pitches." 1 laber said of her and I lansen on
the field. "We talk during the game about how to
approach the pitching."

weekend, defending its home turf by handily defeating
Portland State, Nevada and Cal Poly. The Card faces
off against a tough Arizona team on Friday.

Hansen, before Portland junior Tori
Rodgers was relieved.
Stanford's intensity only picked up
after Friday's 13-hit extravaganza.
ITie Card handed Nevada (40-19,15-
5 Western Athletic Conference) its
first of two losses on Saturday in Palo
Alto. Pcnna fired a two-hitter en
route to the eventual 9-1 drubbing of
the Wolfpack.
I lansen and Haber again went 3-4
with a double apiece. Stanford had no
home runs on the weekend, but got
the job done with two-base hits.
Haber. now the Stanford record
holder for doubles in a season with 24.

broke down the importance of funda
mentals in hitting as the source of so
many doubles.
"i try to go gap to gap, rather than
aiming for the lines," she said. "Of
course, having speed helps, too."
On 11 hits, the Card put nine
across, leaving just five runners on
base in its only meeting of the year
with Nevada.
Fittingly Stanford's Sunday con
test matched the squad with familiar
regular-season rival Cal Poly (41-12.
18-3 Big West).
The Cardinal saw senior Mustang
pitcher Anna Calm for the third and
final time this season. Before play
Sunday, Cahn had given up only three
runs to the Cardinal over 17 innings of
work in the regular season.
But momentum continued to flow
in the direction of Stanford. The bats
produced seven hits, although Stan

cluded two bases-loaded situations in
the first and second inning with just
one run to show for it.
However, that one run proved to

Stanford survived off a one-run
lead after the first inning until the

sixth, when freshman Jcnna Bccerra
was hit by a pitch and cued produc

the Mustang's outfield for playing in

The triple marked a turnaround
for the back of the Card's order,
which was a combined 1-11 on Satur
day. The speedy Hassman scored on
yet another double from Haber.

After her 50th career shutout.
Penna took the win in stride.

knows what to call, after seeing Poly
twice this year." she said.
The Cardinal bats came alive on
I riday. and stuck around through
Sunday, outscoring opponents 23-4

over the span of three games.
Stanford head coach John
Kittman praised his team's determi
nation in Sunday's win.
"We probably had four or five hits
that were right at someone." he said,
"but we eventually found the holes."
Stanford's success means a super
regional in Palo Alto next weekend.
'ITie Card takes on an Arizona team
that has already lost a pair at Smith
I amily Stadium, but handily defeated
the Cardinal early in the conference
schedule.
"We know it's going to be a tough
super regional." Kittman said. "In my
opinion, it's the toughest."
Arizona comes to Palo Alto for a
best-two-of-three series with the ( ar
dinal beginning on Friday.
