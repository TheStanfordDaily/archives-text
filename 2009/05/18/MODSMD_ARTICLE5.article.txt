## An Erotic Affair Students enjoy party with few clothes; only one person arrested 
### ZOE LEAVITT STAFF WRITER 
Exotic Erotic: the morning after. When you can
lie in your bed with the warm gooey feeling of
(hopefully) satisfaction, knowing that last night you
bumped and grinded in closer proximity to a greater
mass of people closer to nakedness than you will
most likely ever experience again. Backed by almost
40 years of tradition, Stanford's famed Exotic Erotic
party still shocks, titillates and gets creative getting
down.
Say what you might about Stanford parties, but
it's not every day you enter a room by gingerly step
ping over two guys in Santa Claus thongs humping
each other in the reverse cowboy position on the
stairs. Descending into the den of sin was crowded
and sweaty. Green lights flashed around the first
dance floor, barely illuminating black walls covered
in bright graffiti. "F*** police!" one of the sayings
encouraged,perhaps inspiring the dominatrix make
out scene in the corner. Heavy techno beats often
sped grinding into drv-hump territory. The second
dance floor rocked with more typical hip-hop
rhythms, and provided better lighting. Alter walking
past the Sexual Health Peer Resource Center
(SHPRC) table handing out condoms, and the live

music of Dance Brown and Gabriel Peodros, guests
could choose to enter two dance floors or simply
enjoy the view.
There were lingerie, dominatrix hoots and thongs
of all colors. And those were just the guys. Some girls
showed faux flirtation with modesty, rocking the
"Risky Business" look â€” underwear and collared
shirts unbuttoned to varying degrees. Others
embraced the night in string bikinis, lacy lingerie and
see-through tops. One boy. showing that typical
Stanford innovation, flaunted the "one-piece" cloth
ing rule by strapping a cardboard box around his
midsection. That one caused some severe discomfort
for the surrounding dancers.
"As far as 1 know, no one entered the party com
pletely naked." said Taylor Durand *10. 680 Lomita
resident and house social manager. "No one exited
the party fully naked, but in between ... I don't
want to know what happened in my kitchen!"
Nadia Arid '12 and Jordan Richard-Craven *12
found the lack of nudity contrary to expectations
running up to the party.
"! was expecting more nudity." Richard-Craven
said. "Also, more creativity in costumes. A lot of it
was just slutty."
