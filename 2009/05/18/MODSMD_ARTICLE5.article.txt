## An Erotic Affair Students enjoy party with few clothes; only one person arrested 
### ZOE LEAVITT STAFF WRITER 
Exotic Erotic: the morning after. When you can
lie in your bed with the warm gooey feeling of
(hopefully) satisfaction, knowing that last night you
bumped and grinded in closer proximity to a greater
mass of people closer to nakedness than you will
most likely ever experience again. Backed by almost
40 years of tradition, Stanford's famed Exotic Erotic
party still shocks, titillates and gets creative getting
down.
Say what you might about Stanford parties, but
it's not every day you enter a room by gingerly step
ping over two guys in Santa Claus thongs humping
each other in the reverse cowboy position on the
stairs. Descending into the den of sin was crowded
and sweaty. Green lights flashed around the first
dance floor, barely illuminating black walls covered
in bright graffiti. "F*** police!" one of the sayings
encouraged,perhaps inspiring the dominatrix make
out scene in the corner. Heavy techno beats often
sped grinding into drv-hump territory. The second
dance floor rocked with more typical hip-hop
rhythms, and provided better lighting. Alter walking
past the Sexual Health Peer Resource Center
(SHPRC) table handing out condoms, and the live

music of Dance Brown and Gabriel Peodros, guests
could choose to enter two dance floors or simply
enjoy the view.
There were lingerie, dominatrix hoots and thongs
of all colors. And those were just the guys. Some girls
showed faux flirtation with modesty, rocking the
"Risky Business" look — underwear and collared
shirts unbuttoned to varying degrees. Others
embraced the night in string bikinis, lacy lingerie and
see-through tops. One boy. showing that typical
Stanford innovation, flaunted the "one-piece" cloth
ing rule by strapping a cardboard box around his
midsection. That one caused some severe discomfort
for the surrounding dancers.
"As far as 1 know, no one entered the party com
pletely naked." said Taylor Durand *10. 680 Lomita
resident and house social manager. "No one exited
the party fully naked, but in between ... I don't
want to know what happened in my kitchen!"
Nadia Arid '12 and Jordan Richard-Craven *12
found the lack of nudity contrary to expectations
running up to the party.
"! was expecting more nudity." Richard-Craven
said. "Also, more creativity in costumes. A lot of it
was just slutty."
"I was expecting streakers, but I
was glad to not see any," Arid added.
"That would've been gross to dance
with streakers."
In the works since December, this
Stanford tradition of letting it all
hang out required intensive organi
zation. Red Bull was one of the
sponsors of the event and provided
free Red Bull and DJs for the party.
The Stanford Green Store provided
recyclable cups. Stanford Concert
Network (SCN) organized the music
for entertainment, and 680 provided
14 kegs for the social lubrication.
The 680 team decorated the house,
diligently fireproofing every last
hanging streamer, and staff and resi
dents also kept control of the party
throughout the night.
"All the residents did a fantastic
job," Durand said. u As a staff, we
were very impressed."
But responsibility seems to be the
antithesis of the Exotic Erotic
dream. Based on its perception by
the outside world, this is the party
that dispels the myth that Stanford
students don't party. While one
Stanford Urban Dictionary defini
tion calls the Stanford party scene
"as dead as any Darwin Award win

ner," Exotic Erotic, an annual staple
for almost 40 years, once made it
onto Playboys top-10 campus par
ties list, nationwide. However, just as
Stanford students are known as mas
ters of the image they project
towards the world, the polished
eroticism found at Cirque
D Exotique has a wild-yet-con
trolled attitude.
"It's very Stanford," Durand said.
"There are 1000s of people, we pro
vide music, entertainment, but then,
when you look behind the scenes,
there are chain-link fences every
where, 30 cops. Risk management is
always extremely important."
Because of the intrigue, the
promise of skimpy outfits and col
lege students acting badly, this party
can attract far worse than the
"sketchy grad students" in the cor
ners of an average frat party. The
lure draws high school students and
Palo Alto community members
without fail. The San Francisco
Craigslist even featured two ads —
one from a 23-year-old and one from
a 27-year-old man — both looking
for male Stanford students to hook
up with at the party. For these rea
sons, 680 Lomita residents consid
ered the 30 policemen they hired a
necessity, and upped the number
from last year.
Compared to the normal
Stanford frat party, where the
behind-the-back ID slip, or the look

innocent-in-a-big-group-of-hot-girls
trick usually provides for the friend
from out of state or the one who for
got their SUID, Cirque D'Exotique
did not mess around. Bikini-wearing
hopefuls had to stand in long lines
looping around fences and pass
through at least three police check
points. including flashlight compar
isons of people's faces and ID pic
tures.
"Oh. I didn't know we needed
Stanford IDs." two boys whined.

They were firmly turned away.
Groups who tried to sneak in
through back entryways also found
crews of police waiting.
According to 680 Lomita staff,
one arrest for harassment took place
after a policeman stopped a man
from assaulting a girl at the party, but
details of the case are not yet clear.
No other incidents ruined the festiv
ities.
One logistical issue still needs
tweaking for next year.

"We got 14 kegs and only three
toilets!" laughed Durand, who will
also organize the party next year.
"People told us not to go behind our
bushes for a while — they're proba
bly covered in pee."
Besides the rampant abuse of the
foliage, sentiments were mixed as to
whether Exotic Erotic lived up to its
annual hype. Sexual undertones and
hook-up hopes can be a typical
weekend staple, and the only differ
ence last Friday may have been the
blatancy.
"The fun part was getting ready
and the hype about it," Arid said,
"while the actual party seemed the
same [as other frat parties]."
There was the same grinding and
the same prowling boys and dancing

girls locking making eye contact
from across the room. 'Hie decora
tions were more elaborate, and
many guests appreciated the sepa
rate rooms, live bands and fresh air
drifting in from the yard. And, of
course, prowling eyes had plenty of
places to land.
"Honestly, I thought it was the
exact same thing as any other frat
party, just with less clothes," said
Nicole Rodriguez '12. "Lots of male
buttocks."
And male buttocks of course
leave their mark. Most everyone left
the night stories of their own or
hearsay they could share with
friends from other schools. The resi
dents of 680 Lomita can rest assured
they furthered Stanford's party rep
utation across the country.
Throughout the cleaning process,
680 residents and volunteering frats
and sororities discovered a multi
tude of lost IDs, most likely because
of the complete lack of pockets
among guests. They also picked up a
few unpaired shoes, and, curiously,
an unworn thong with tags still
attached. But besides the ghosts of
crotches past, the house returned to
normal by Monday. There's less than
a year now of clothes and inhibitions
until Stanford students can shed
both once again.

Caution tape, body paint and lingerie were only a handful of the outfits
donned by partygoers on Friday night at 680 Lomita's annual Exotic Erotic.
Historically, the 40-year tradition is one of the biggest parties of the year.
Exotic Erotic: the morning after. When you can
lie in your bed with the warm gooey feeling of
(hopefully) satisfaction, knowing that last night you
bumped and grinded in closer proximity to a greater
mass of people closer to nakedness than you will
most likely ever experience again. Backed by almost
40 years of tradition, Stanford's famed Exotic Erotic
party still shocks, titillates and gets creative getting
down.
Say what you might about Stanford parties, but
it's not every day you enter a room by gingerly step
ping over two guys in Santa Claus thongs humping
each other in the reverse cowboy position on the
stairs. Descending into the den of sin was crowded
and sweaty. Green lights flashed around the first
dance floor, barely illuminating black walls covered
in bright graffiti. "F*** police!" one of the sayings
encouraged,perhaps inspiring the dominatrix make
out scene in the corner. Heavy techno beats often
sped grinding into drv-hump territory. The second
dance floor rocked with more typical hip-hop
rhythms, and provided better lighting. Alter walking
past the Sexual Health Peer Resource Center
(SHPRC) table handing out condoms, and the live

music of Dance Brown and Gabriel Peodros, guests
could choose to enter two dance floors or simply
enjoy the view.
There were lingerie, dominatrix hoots and thongs
of all colors. And those were just the guys. Some girls
showed faux flirtation with modesty, rocking the
"Risky Business" look — underwear and collared
shirts unbuttoned to varying degrees. Others
embraced the night in string bikinis, lacy lingerie and
see-through tops. One boy. showing that typical
Stanford innovation, flaunted the "one-piece" cloth
ing rule by strapping a cardboard box around his
midsection. That one caused some severe discomfort
for the surrounding dancers.
"As far as 1 know, no one entered the party com
pletely naked." said Taylor Durand *10. 680 Lomita
resident and house social manager. "No one exited
the party fully naked, but in between ... I don't
want to know what happened in my kitchen!"
Nadia Arid '12 and Jordan Richard-Craven *12
found the lack of nudity contrary to expectations
running up to the party.
"! was expecting more nudity." Richard-Craven
said. "Also, more creativity in costumes. A lot of it
was just slutty."
"I was expecting streakers, but I
was glad to not see any," Arid added.
"That would've been gross to dance
with streakers."
In the works since December, this
Stanford tradition of letting it all
hang out required intensive organi
zation. Red Bull was one of the
sponsors of the event and provided
free Red Bull and DJs for the party.
The Stanford Green Store provided
recyclable cups. Stanford Concert
Network (SCN) organized the music
for entertainment, and 680 provided
14 kegs for the social lubrication.
The 680 team decorated the house,
diligently fireproofing every last
hanging streamer, and staff and resi
dents also kept control of the party
throughout the night.
"All the residents did a fantastic
job," Durand said. u As a staff, we
were very impressed."
But responsibility seems to be the
antithesis of the Exotic Erotic
dream. Based on its perception by
the outside world, this is the party
that dispels the myth that Stanford
students don't party. While one
Stanford Urban Dictionary defini
tion calls the Stanford party scene
"as dead as any Darwin Award win

ner," Exotic Erotic, an annual staple
for almost 40 years, once made it
onto Playboys top-10 campus par
ties list, nationwide. However, just as
Stanford students are known as mas
ters of the image they project
towards the world, the polished
eroticism found at Cirque
D Exotique has a wild-yet-con
trolled attitude.
"It's very Stanford," Durand said.
"There are 1000s of people, we pro
vide music, entertainment, but then,
when you look behind the scenes,
there are chain-link fences every
where, 30 cops. Risk management is
always extremely important."
Because of the intrigue, the
promise of skimpy outfits and col
lege students acting badly, this party
can attract far worse than the
"sketchy grad students" in the cor
ners of an average frat party. The
lure draws high school students and
Palo Alto community members
without fail. The San Francisco
Craigslist even featured two ads —
one from a 23-year-old and one from
a 27-year-old man — both looking
for male Stanford students to hook
up with at the party. For these rea
sons, 680 Lomita residents consid
ered the 30 policemen they hired a
necessity, and upped the number
from last year.
Compared to the normal
Stanford frat party, where the
behind-the-back ID slip, or the look

innocent-in-a-big-group-of-hot-girls
trick usually provides for the friend
from out of state or the one who for
got their SUID, Cirque D'Exotique
did not mess around. Bikini-wearing
hopefuls had to stand in long lines
looping around fences and pass
through at least three police check
points. including flashlight compar
isons of people's faces and ID pic
tures.
"Oh. I didn't know we needed
Stanford IDs." two boys whined.

They were firmly turned away.
Groups who tried to sneak in
through back entryways also found
crews of police waiting.
According to 680 Lomita staff,
one arrest for harassment took place
after a policeman stopped a man
from assaulting a girl at the party, but
details of the case are not yet clear.
No other incidents ruined the festiv
ities.
One logistical issue still needs
tweaking for next year.

streakers, but I
was glad not to
see any''

"We got 14 kegs and only three
toilets!" laughed Durand, who will
also organize the party next year.
"People told us not to go behind our
bushes for a while — they're proba
bly covered in pee."
Besides the rampant abuse of the
foliage, sentiments were mixed as to
whether Exotic Erotic lived up to its
annual hype. Sexual undertones and
hook-up hopes can be a typical
weekend staple, and the only differ
ence last Friday may have been the
blatancy.
"The fun part was getting ready
and the hype about it," Arid said,
"while the actual party seemed the
same [as other frat parties]."
There was the same grinding and
the same prowling boys and dancing

girls locking making eye contact
from across the room. 'Hie decora
tions were more elaborate, and
many guests appreciated the sepa
rate rooms, live bands and fresh air
drifting in from the yard. And, of
course, prowling eyes had plenty of
places to land.
"Honestly, I thought it was the
exact same thing as any other frat
party, just with less clothes," said
Nicole Rodriguez '12. "Lots of male
buttocks."
And male buttocks of course
leave their mark. Most everyone left
the night stories of their own or
hearsay they could share with
friends from other schools. The resi
dents of 680 Lomita can rest assured
they furthered Stanford's party rep
utation across the country.
Throughout the cleaning process,
680 residents and volunteering frats
and sororities discovered a multi
tude of lost IDs, most likely because
of the complete lack of pockets
among guests. They also picked up a
few unpaired shoes, and, curiously,
an unworn thong with tags still
attached. But besides the ghosts of
crotches past, the house returned to
normal by Monday. There's less than
a year now of clothes and inhibitions
until Stanford students can shed
both once again.
