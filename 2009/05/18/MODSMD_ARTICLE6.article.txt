## 
### DAN BOHM STAFF WRITER 
After winning the first two games of the
series, the Stanford baseball team (2 l )-22, 12-12
Pacific-10 Conference) was unable to pull off the
sweep at I IS(' on Sunday, falling 5-2.
The Cardinal has now won three consecutive
series and six of seven games total ;is it tries to
make a late-season push at a postseason berth.
Stanford pitchers led the way all weekend,
especially in the K-ft win on Friday night and the
9-1 win on Saturday.
On Friday, freshman Jordan Pries took to the
mound and scattered nine hits and five runs
while striking out eight over eight innings for the
victory. Pries, who spent most of the season as the
Cardinal's Saturday starter is now 4-3 in a very
solid freshman campaign.

Pries was given a great cushion Friday by the
Stanford offense.The hig inning came in the third
when the Cardinal hatted around en route to
scoring six runs.
The game was scoreless entering the inning,
when sophomore shortstop Jake Schlander sin
gled to begin the rally. Sophomore second base
man Colin Walsh was then hit by a pitch, and sen
ior centerfielder Joey August bunted for a single.
A throwing error by tJSC" pitcher Anthony
Vasque/ allowed Schlander to score on the play.
Junior left-fielder Toby Gcrhart then scored two
with a double to center.
ITie scoring was capped later 111 the inning on
a squeeze bunt off the bat of third baseman
Adam (iaylord. scoring designated hitter Jeff
Whitlow.
The Cardinal didn't l<x>k back from there.
ITie one hie blemish on the scoreboard came

in the bottom of the ninth when Pries loaded the
bases with nobody out, causing Stanford head
coach Mark Marquess to summon sophomore
closer Drew Storen. Storen was greeted uncere
moniously by Vasquez, who blasted a Storen
pitch out of the ballpark for a grand slam, cutting
the Cardinal lead to two.That was all the Trojans
would muster off the Stanford closer, however.
Marquess was thrilled with the performance
of his freshman starter. Pries.
"Great performance," Marquess said. "He
had good command; he only had the one walk.
Normally, when he has good command, he is
tough, and he was today in a big game for us."
On Saturday, freshman Brett Mooneyham
would not need to hand the ball off to any reliev
ers. I lie southpaw threw his first career complete
game, surrendering just seven hits while striking
out 11 Trojans

On the other side of the ball, the Stanford
offense had little trouble figuring out USC starter
Robert Stoek.
Ihe Cardinal peppered Trojan pitching for 14
hits and scored runs in five different innings
Stock lasted just four innings before being pulled.
Gerhart and senior first baseman Brent
Milleville — the reigning Pac-10 Player of the
Week — led the offensive onslaught with three
hits apiece. Whitlow and sophomore right-fielder
Kellen Kiilsgaard each had a pair of RBIs to go
along with two hits each.
After Saturday's game. Marquess was happv
to have won the series.
"A win any time in the season — especially
late — is important to us so these wins are defi
nitely big." Marquess said.

GAME NOTES: Despite Sunday's loss to
USC, Stanford has still won nine of
its last 1 2 games. The Cardinal
pitching was exceptional on Friday
and Saturday with starting pitchers
going eight and nine innings,
respectively. Stanford beat Davis 5-2
in a match-up earlier in the season.
Despite carrying the momentum
into Sunday and knowing that it might
need a sweep in order to keep its slim
regional chances alive, Stanford fell 5-
2 in the final game.
The Cardinal was without its nor
mal Sunday starter, junior Jeffrey
Inman. who was out with arm sore
ness. Sophomore Michael Marshall
made his second start of the season in
place of Inman.
Marshall, along with relievers Max
Fearnow and Storen pitched reason
ably well, allowing five runs on a series
of weakly hit bloop singles. The lone
power shot by the Trojans was a solo
homer off the bat of All-American
shortstop Grant Green while facing
Storen in the ninth.
The story of the game, however,
was the Trojan pitching. Brad
Boxberger and Daniel Cooper com
bined to allow just six hits while
striking out 10 Cardinal batters in

the victory.
Boxberger, who Marquess called
"one of the top guys in the confer
ence," normally starts earlier in the
weekend, but had his start pushed
back to Sunday because of illness.
He showed no effects of his sick
ness as the lone Stanford runs came on
a fourth-inning two-run home run to
center by Gerhart. At the time, it gave
the Cardinal a 2-1 lead; however, the
Trojans would quickly answer back
with two runs in the bottom of the fifth
to take the lead for good.
Stanford now returns home for its
final four games of the season. It hosts
UC-Davis on Tuesday before its final
Pac-10 series of the season against
Oregon State this coming weekend.
The Cardinal likely needs to win all
four games to have a chance at the re
gional. It is a difficult task, but not in
surmountable for a team that began
the season 3-9 and has since gone 26-
13.
