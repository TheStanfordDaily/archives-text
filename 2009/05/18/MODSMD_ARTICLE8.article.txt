## EDITORIAL O-Show a No-Show, Fo' Sho'? 
### 
The Office of Student Activities and
Freshman Dean's Office recently an
nounced that the O-Show — the an
nual group a capella concert held during
New Student Orientation has been cut
for NSO 2(H)9 after running continuously
since 1992. The decision was part of a larger
string of budget cuts that every office on
campus has been struggling to make, but was
also part of a larger discussion about the un
fairness of a capella companies, and not
other performing arts groups, being show
cased during NS( ).The prohibitive price lag
for the event is mostly driven by the necessi
ty to house members of performing arts
groups for several extra days before they
would otherwise move in.
Student a capella groups have expressed
the valid concern that O-Show is a huge
source of publicity, and that it will be much
more difficult to attract new members with
out it. While the O-Show is undoubtedly a
huge recruiting tool, many a capella groups
tour residence halls in the first few weeks of
schools, and also table in White Pla/.a during
lunch and at the Activities Fair. It will be inter
esting to see whether fewer students try out
for one of the nine groups this fall, but we are
optimistic that many students will still be ex
posed to a capella during the first weeks of
school and opt to audition. ()ther performing
arts groups on campus — like dvK and ( ardi
nal Calypso have survived for years with
out a formal showcase at the beginning of the
year.
Additionally.cutting ()-Show allowed the
Freshman Dean's Office to preserve Faces.

Real World, the Three Books seminar and
Discover Stanford. Iliese programs all offer
different things to different members of the
Stanford community. This list of NSO pro
grams only reminds us that the schedule dur
ing NS() is already incredibly packed, so re
moving this one event might help ease the
over-scheduling that weighs on freshmen as
NSO week wears on. It is. however, regret
table that the program that was selected for
elimination was one that highlighted the
work of some of Stanford's most celebrated
student groups and their accomplished and
talented members.
The editorial board would like to propose
a middle ground. It appears that holding the
O-Show during NSO as in past years is finan
cially burdensome, and would continue to
weigh down an already crowded schedule.
On the other hand, to scrap it completely
would deprive freshmen of a valuable Stan
lord experience, and deprive a capella groups
on campus of some welcome exposure. There
also appears to be a need for other perform
ing arts groups on campus to have a chance to
perform for freshmen and advertise their
communities. Our suggestion is that during
the first week or two of class, the University
could sponsor a performing arts extravagan
za specifically targeted to freshmen. With this
compromise, many performing arts groups
011 campus get the publicity they need, the
OSA and I DO aren't left to pick up the tab
for extra housing for do/ens of singers and
out new freshmen are exposed to the wide
variety of talents present in our accom
plished and diverse campus.
