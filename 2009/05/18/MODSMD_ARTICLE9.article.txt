## Huntsman, Obama, 2012 and the GOP 
### 
President ()bama's decision to select Jon
Huntsman. Jr.. the Republican (iover
nor of I Jtah.tobe ambassador to ( 'hina
is certainly audacious. But Huntsman does
not appear to have been Obama's first pick.
A blog associated with Foreign Policy maga
zine. I he ( able,notes that several people are
thought to have turned down the job. includ
ing former Clinton Chief of Staff John
Podesta and former Republican Senator
( buck I lagel.
Instead of choosing someone who is a
lifetime China expert, as he did with Joseph
Nye's appointment as ambassador to Japan.
Obama has chosen someone with more po
litical and less direct foreign-policy experi
enee. although Huntsman was once ambas
sador to Singapore in the early 1990s under
President (ieorge II.W. Bush.
I lie selection is likely to please the ( hi
nese government. Choosing someone with
the stature and instant celebrity as Hunts
man sends a message that the I IS. highly val
lies the U.S.China relationship and the em
bassy in Beijing has ;i direct line to (lie Pres
ident. This is a move akin to French Presi
dent Nicholas Sarkozy's decision to co
opt/appoint a distinguished Socialist.
Bernard Kouchner. as his foreign minister.
As Mark McKinnon. a Republican strate
gist. commented. "Keep your friends close
and your enemies ( hina."
t he other end of the appointment the
acceptance — is even more interesting.
Huntsman was thought to be positioning
himself for a run at the presidency in 2012. A
two-term governor, he had previously de
clared he would not be running for a third
term in 2010. Recently endorsing civil unions
and building a relatively pro-environment
record, he was thought to be positioning
himself as a relative moderate in a prospec
tive field of who's-morc-conservative types
like Sarah Palm. Mike I luckabee and Bobby
Jindal. As someone who has received much
less national media attention than Palm and
Jindal. I luntsman would he able to run with
out the pre-existing negatives that Rudy
(iiuliani suffered from in 2008.
The question is why I luntsman passed up
a decent shot at the (i< )P nomination in 2012
to take the ambassadorial appointment. I he
calculation in Huntsman's mind could have
occurred in two different ways. I irst. that
Obama and the Democrats are so strong
that no Republican besides a reincarnated
Ronald Reagan would have much of a
chance against him. ()r. second, that his own
chances of capturing the nomination were
too small to really be a contender.
I"he first point is certainly a possibility.
I he primary schedule, which privileges the
conservative states lowa. Nevada and South
Carolina, heavily tilts any Republican pri
mary toward a conservative. Hie only reason
John McCain won the nomination in 200, X
was due to the division of self-identified

When the party is shedding
moderates like the average
cat sheds hair.it is certainly
not a good time to be a
moderate [...]

"conservatives" among Mike I luckabee.
Mitt Romneyand Fred Thompson. If conser
vatives had united around one candidate
early. Mc( 'ain would likely not have won the
nomination. The first primary. lowa, is the
most important and the moderates McCain
and (iiuliani were crushed in 2008. At a time
when the party is shedding moderates like
the average cat sheds hair, it is certainly not
a good time to be a moderate in the party.
On the other hand. Obama's hand looks
particularly strong against any Republican.
If the economy does start to recover in late
2010. as most economists project, Obama
will likely gain some amount of credit for it.
Hie number of self-identified Republicans is
at its lowest levels in decades, liie Democ
rats completely control the policy agenda
and the public seems to agree - polls show
that the public does not believe that the Re
publican Congressional leadership has been
bipartisan.
The true reason why Huntsman took the
job is probably both — that the Republicans
have a slim chance at capturing the presiden
cy m 2012. and Huntsman has a slim chance
at capturing a nomination that few politi
cians in their right mind should want. Hie
fact that a popular, charismatic Republican
governor would rather work with Obama
than run for President himself is a testament
to the strength of Obama's political position,
which is likely to remain extremely strong
for some time.
