# Crime and Punishment

On January 22. USC's Daily Trojan
wrote that all-new construction at
USC is going to be Leadership in Fn
ergy and Environmental Design (LEED)-
certified from now on. Big step. guys. I mean,
it's a good way to cast the gauntlet, but Stan
ford's going to ...
Oh wait.
We don't actually know yet. because
Stanford hasn't let students read its draft
sustainabilitv plan. Don't worry, though.
Someone gave me a lollipop and promised
it's one of the most stringent around.
This lack of access makes it very difficult
for me to publicly support or decry said plan,
and it is keeping me out of the elite Stanford
Daily Columnist USC-Bashing C lub be
cause I can't back up anything I say about
how much more awesome Stanford is than
USC.
(For the record. The Daily Trojan also
mentions USC's admirable commitment to
including students in planning.)
Fortunately, there's hope. Last week, a
group of Students for a Sustainable Stanford
(SSS) members met with President Hen
nessy to express our strong interest 111 having
the plan released to students. Since it was
students back in 2005 who started the cam
paign for such a plan and for a solid commit
ment to greenhouse gas emissions reduc
tions by the University, and since about
14.000 members of the Stanford community
are current students, it has been particularly
frustrating that students have not been able
to participate in the drafting process or even
be made privy to the contents of the plan.
President Hennessy made a commitment
at that meeting to release the draft plan to
students this week, which is pretty groovy
considering how long we've been waiting for
it. (Given that: please download it if you
have any interest in keeping Stanford bomb.

From the bits I've glimpsed at late at night
when Hie Man can't see me. it's got some
good points and some points that deserve to
he ridiculed by hordes of freshmen in the
streets.) Student input will allegedly be
sought for a section on how to keep students
involved.
This is all very, very good, because it in
creases the potential of getting somewhere.
To explain why that potential is some
thing that feels so new. let me describe the
current student relationship with campus
sustainabilitv planners.
We. the student body in general get slain
for being apathetic. We apparently don't do
or say much about the future of Stanford
sustainabilitv. so the administration doesn't
think we care.so it doesn't publicize sustain
abilitv or make opportunities for us to help.
That's not to say Stanford doesn't do a lot
- one of the reasons that the plan has taken
so long to draft is that Stanford has already
done a lot of the obvious things, like culling
incandescent light bulbs. Stanford cut its
daily water demand substantially with some
major infrastructure projects a lew years
back. I was in a particularly memorable class
where someone had tried to show that the
golf course is a ridiculously wasteful water
consumer relative to the Community Farm,
but she found that the golf course is actually
a model of water efficiency (for a golf
course) while the farm suffers from things
like people forgetting to turn oil hoses for a
couple of days. ()ops. So yes. Stanford is ad
mittedly pretty good at institutional efficien
cy.
W hat Stanford has not been particularly
good at is making sure we all care about effi
ciency. too. or try ing to create opportunities
for students to voice concerns and get in
volved. It's a vicious cycle. Stanford imple
ments top-down projects with the admirable

stated goal of affecting student life as little as
possible meaning that the University is
trying to be awesome at reducing carbon
emissions while allowing us to stand around
our house kitchens with the refrigerators
open while we chat about the delicious hum
mus we're eating. Which is ... good. I guess.
Because of these top-down projects that
get implemented behind the scenes.students
aren't aware of what's going on. So we don't
complain or rejoice about it very often. So
we're seen as apathetic. So the University
continues projects behind the scenes sans
student input.
When we ask what we can do. we're told
it would be helpful if the student body were
less apathetic. In turn, we say that we're not
apathetic â€” we need to know what action
would actually be useful, not just a sputter
ing make-work activity for someone's PWR
paper on student action or, worse, something
act ually counterproductive.
The best "tangible" mandate we've re
ceived is this: educate yourselves, and then
care, quietly and in your own way. To which
we say: it's difficult to tell the difference be
tween that and apathy, and can we please
have access to the materials that will allow us
to educate ourselves? To which we're told:
no.
... What?!
Apparently the University's worried we
might tell the press, plus the mother hen
wants her little chickies just to trust her on
this one.
I. for one, am ready for the chance to put
the force of conviction behind that trust (or
not) when we see The Plan Itself. And then
bash USC. To the press.
