# The
						Dude Abides
## That's a bummer, dude 
### 
Generally speaking, I am not much of a
sentimentalist. Known for wielding a
bit of a sharpened tongue, 1 have regu
larly used my K(H) words a week to bluster on
semi-serious topics regarding the means by
which we can attempt to improve the collec
tive Stanford experience. My comments have,
on occasion, reflected a rather Machiavellian
outlook toward the I 'niversitv: my concerns
are not with the processes undertaken to
achieve certain aims, but rather with the im
provement of the end results.
During the financial catastrophe that has
constituted our enormous. 15 percent across
the-board budget cuts, my life has remained
virtually unchanged. While I have bemoaned
the loss of our monetary dominance and the
cutting of particular budget line items, the ac
tual impact of the economic climate has
seemed like a sort of amorphous concept to
me. Just last week, though. I had a visceral ex
perience with the human cost of the financial
crisis.
Shockingly enough, there are a few folks
who, on occasion, give up a few minutes ol
their lives to read "The Dude Abides." One
such person is Teresa Riseborough. A region
al housing manager for (lovC'o and surround
ing environs, Teresa has sent me a few incred
ibly kind messages regarding my columns.
However, in ;i message I received last week.
Teresa told me that she would no longer be at
Stanford next year.
Though I had only ever communicated
with her over email. I asked Teresa if she
would care to chat. For over an hour and a
half last Wednesday afternoon, we sat at a
lunch bench in the l ag courtyard, chatting
over a wide range of topics. A 27-year veteran
of Mousing. I'eresa has helped manage nearly
every single residential complex on campus,
excluding the Row. A tremendously kind
woman, Teresa spoke of loving every minute
she spent in I lousing.

And the reason we are able to
lead such comfortable
existences here? Its the hard
work of people like Teresa.

ally tli) not shv away from making hold and
sweeping attacks at faceless bureaucracies,
particularly in this column, hut talking to
Teresa was an important reminder to me that
the overwhelming amount of people who
work at places like Stanford do so because
they want to provide a superior experience
for us all they want to see the school run in
a manner that is friendly, welcoming and very
much in tune with the needs ol its young and
ahsurd constituents.
Teresa is someone who spent a large por
tion of her working life in the service ol the
school's student hody. who exudes warmth
when speaking of particularly superior RAs.
But because of this economic shit storm, there
will be a particular absence in Housing be
cause Teresa will not he there.
In a perfect world. I would like nothing
more than to see leresa have her position rc
stored, or another comparable position of
worth be given to her. Unfortunately, this is
probahlv not in the cards, because the current
economic situation is |iisi that wretched.
I rom the departure ol people like leresa

(and I am dead certain that,given the 15 per
cent that is hitting the whole school,there are
a great many other exceptional employees
who will no longer be with us). I do believe
there are some potential lessons.albeit rather
bitter that I.and perhaps others, can take
from this all.
First: look at the workings of the school
from a less rigid world view. I still think The
Axe and Palm is a blight upon the world of
dining, and really do want to see improved
service and food quality. One possibility is to
simply outsource the "restaurant" to an inde
pendent retailer, w hose service would be infi
nitely less horrible, but whose employees
would more than likely be paid less. Instead of
pushing outright for gutting our unionized
work force, examining the situation from a
non-student perspective and advocating for a
variety of options is a far saner course of ac
tion
Second: appreciate the efforts of the
countless and oft-invisible staff members who
work to make our time at Stanford the four
years of pampered lunacy that it is. There is
undoubtedly a huge amount of people like
I'eresa. who. while interacting with students
on some degree, are largely invisible to the
general campus. It boggles my mind to think
of how you make an operation like Housing,
much less the entire bloody school, operate
on a consistent basis. And the reason we are
able to lead such comfortable existences
here? It's the hard work of people like Teresa.
I .astly: don't throw away your trash in the
bathroom bins. It is something 1 have been
guilt\ ot a variety of times, though Teresa. I
am officially disavow ing such behavior.

Zack is pretty sure that even at a place like USC,
there are administrators ami employees who
deeply aire about the well-being of the students.

tualh remained coherent in this article'.' Let him
