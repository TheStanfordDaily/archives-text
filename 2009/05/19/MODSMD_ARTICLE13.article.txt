up the individual ranks when he post
ed three more hirdies to give him
another 1 -under, leading him to finish
in a tie for fourth.
"Dodge has been one of the keys
to our success," Ray said. "He has
been disappointed in his own results,
but he has definitely been knocking
on the door for a while now.This tour
nament was great for Dodge. He
played solidly and definitely showed
that he is the backbone of our team."
Sophomore Sihwan Kim also had
a slow start but finished in a tie for
12th with an eight-over-par 221 for
the tournament. Kim finished the first
and second rounds with a 75 and 74 to
give him a seven-over 149 and put
him in a tie for 28th. He stepped up
for the Cardinal in the final round
when he came in with a one-over 72
for the day that boosted him up 14
ranks to finish in the top 15 for
Stanford.
No. 15 sophomore Steve Ziegler
had real potential to take the individ
ual crown but thunderstorms and
tough course conditions placed him
into a tie for 37th with a 13-over 226.
Ziegler finished the first round with a
one-under 70. just two strokes behind
first place. I lowever, he carded a six
over 77 and an eight-over 79. putting

him out of contention for the top
spot.
Freshman David Chung and sen
ior Daniel Lim tied for 56th with a 20-
over 233 for the tournament. Chung
struggled in the first round, posting an
82 and 78, but rebounded in the final
round with a two-over 73. Lim did
well in the first round, firing a 73, but
then went on to post a 79 and 81.
Stanford's outcome in its regional
is similar to the other top four teams
in the country. No. 4 Washington and
No. 2 Georgia came in second at the
Central and Southeast Regionals,
respectively. No. 3 Southern
California placed fifth in the West
Regional while No. 1 Oklahoma got
first in the South Central Regional.
"Everyone is in a similar situation
to us and now we need to regroup."
Ray said. "There are probably a hand
ful of teams that could win the
NCAAs and I think we qualify in that
group given our season finishes and
production. Next, we looked at the
team individually and I think that
there is not a team that we can't com
pete with if we play our best golf next
week. It's really going to come down
to which team has [its] best week next
week."
As a result, the Cardinal will be
continuing on the road to the NCAA
Championships next week for the
third consecutive season.
