42.1 seconds, a mere three-tenths of a second
behind the Golden Bears. Third-place Wash

onds behind Ihe winner. Washington. Al
though the Cardinal stayed within two boat
lengths of the I luskies and hung on the tail of
the Cal boat for over three quarters of the
race, the Stanford rowers found themselves
overpowered in the final 500 meters of the
race, where a power-10 helped both Ihe Gold
en Bears and Ihe Huskies pull ahead.
The men's freshmen eight also faced Ihe

same difficulties in overcoming their Washing
ton and Cal counterparts, who finished 19.60
and 10.80 seconds, respectively, ahead ol (lie

point, but any true championship rower
knows to never be satisfied and always strive
to put in more training than anyone thought
possible," he said.
