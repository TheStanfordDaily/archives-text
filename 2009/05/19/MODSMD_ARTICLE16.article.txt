# Trevor Ariza, why did you have to leave?
## 
### 
I've always been partial to un
derrated, unknown players. The
first artiele I ever wrote for any
paper was on the 2003 New
York Giants' running hack situ
ation, and why Delvin Joyce was hot
ter. dollar-for-dollar. than Heisman
Trophy winner Ron Dayne.
And in 2005. while fellow New
York Knicks fans were stocking up
on Starhury apparel. I came ever so
close to customizing Trevor Ari/a's
No. 21 jersey. It not for some inane
Madison Square Garden rule that
only allowed you to use the number
one on a custom uniform, it would
have come to fruition.
I'm not sure why,out of a roster of
a do/en guys. Ari/.a became my fa
vorite. Perhaps it was because the
other Knicks of that dreadful era
were, on the whole, entirely unap
pealing. and Ari/a's high-flying
dunks provided some of the lone ex
citement in an otherwise pathetic
time to be a New York basketball
fan. Ari/a was extraordinarily athlet
ic. hut remarkably raw. lie probably
left school a season or two too early,
but that was all right — he had the
natural talent to play in the NBA. but
he just needed a bit of practice.
Above everything else, he lacked
a sound jump shot from beyond 12
feet. He was pretty much helpless
along the arc, and even inside of it. A
nieme developed for a few friends
and me: II Ari/a could develop an IX
footer, lie was going to make the
Knicks very happy.
But that opportunity never came:
Ari/a was dealt to Orlando in early
2006 in exchange for Steve I rands.
The trade was seen as fairly safe for
the Knicks, but it left me distraught
still, if frauds could turn his ca
reer around and get back to his for
mer. superstar level, all would be
right.
But. just like every other plan dur
ing Isaiah's Reign of Terror, the
Ari/a brands trade didn't work out.
In his lone lull year in ()rlando,Ari/a
posted career highs in field goal per
centage and points per game in the
2006-2007 season. Even then,
though, he was still raw — it wasn't
until he was traded to the I.os Ange
les Lakers in late 2007 that lie began
to blossom.
By this past season, he had be
come a legitimate scoring option,
both with his drives to the hoop and
with a fairly developed juniper. Ari/a
has shot well from beyond the arc in
these playoffs, and though that part
of his game is still lacking overall,
he's become a complete player. In
short, he's developed that much
needed hS-footer. so much so that
even on a team with Kobe Bryant.
Pau (iasol and Andrew Bynum. he is
frequently the third or fourth option
on the attack. And it would be crimi
nal to go this entire column without
mentioning his defense, which is
quite good along the perimeter. And
then, ol course, there are the high
light plavs. like some of his steals and
dunks against Utah in the first round.
How many times have we seen him
leap out of bounds, save the ball and
give it off to a streaking teammate?
It's become a running joke at The
Daily office, and this column, self-in
dulgent as it is. has been a long time
in the making. We watch the 2009
playoffs,and see Ari/a as a legitimate
option on a Lakers team that has
seemed destined for the 112 inals prac
tically all year. After each impressive
play, a few editors in particular will
turn and watch me wallow in my
grief. As if the abomination known as
New York basketball over the past
decade wasn't painful enough. I'm
now stuck watching one of my fa
vorites help a team that has. let's say.
an interesting history with the
Knicks.
But the worst part is that Ari/a's
game would lit in perfectly with
Mike IVAntoni's offense.which is ;il
ready helping to turn the tide in New
York. Visions ol Nate Robinson dish
ing to Ari/a in transition are impossi
ble to erase from my mind.
More often than not. the un
knowns I choose to champion
amount to fairly little. Joyce, for ex-

Between the lines
ample, has been out of the NFL
for nearly five years, and was
never more than a decent return
man in his time in the league. And
by no means is Ariza a superstar
in the making — he'll likely be an
effective role player throughout
his time in the NBA, but never
All-World. That said, he has
already made significant strides,
and still hasn't tapped out his
potential.
But he's doing all this in SoCal,
and not New York. And that is a
tremendously hard pill to swallow.
