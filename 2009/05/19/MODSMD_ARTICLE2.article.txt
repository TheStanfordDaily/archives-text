## Charter school will have new site Univ.-affiliated elementary school heads to Menlo Park 
### ERIC MESSINGER DESK EDITOR 
Students at a Stanford-related
charter school in East Palo Alto
will be heading to their classes in
Menlo Park next year after a school
district decision made last
Ifiursday.
Trustees for the Ravenswood
School District voted to swap the
East Palo Alto Academy K-8
School (HPAA)site with that of the
James Flood Science and
Technology Magnet School (Flood
School). Students from Flood
School will now be headed to the
current EPAA location in East Palo
Alto, while I: PA A students will go
to Flood's former facility in Menlo
Park. The switch will take place for
the 2009-2010 academic year.
The district's decision was a
result of budgetary pressure, as
Ravenswood seeks to maximize its
funding. According to the San Jose
Mercury News, the trustees expect
the move to net $2()().()()() through a
combination of reduced transporta
tion costs and expected growth for
Flood at the new location. The
EPAA. which is a charter school,
does not receive per-pupil funding
from California, while each new stu
dent at Flood brings more money.
The EPAA K-8 School, as well
as the unaffected EPAA High
School, are run by the Stanford
New Schools, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit
organization created by Stanford's
School of Education in 2006. While
Stanford does not actively adminis
ter the school, it does appoint
EPA As Board of Directors, and
the Dean of the School of
Education serves as the president
of the board.
While the move has drawn sharp
criticism from Flood School parents
who believe their children will be
moving to a less desirable location
and facility, EPAA personnel do
not believe they are necessarily
benefiting from the switch.
"I don't know that it's an
improvement, it's just another
space." said Education School
Dean Deborah Stipek. "The pluses
and the minuses cancel themselves
out in some respects."
Stipek added that EPAA had
very little input in the decision.
"We don't have choices," Stipek
said. "The school district makes
them for us."
Stanford New Schools Chief
Operating Officer (Jail Greely said
the news of the move was not
expected.
"We did not think this was an
option under consideration for us
until about three weeks ago,"
Greely said.

"There was so much opposition
at the end of April," Greely added,
"that we were surprised they
moved forward."
Nonetheless, Greely said that
she believed the EPAA community
might be better-prepared for a dis
ruptive move than the members of
the Flood School.
"They have a long history at that
location, and a strong tie to that
location," Greely said. "We've had
some disruption from relocation
and expansion every year. Our
community and our sense of identi

ty is not rooted in our site."
As a K-8 charter school without
its own building, the EPAA must
by California law receive an ade
quate facility from the local school
district. While beneficial in that it
offers the EPAA the guarantee of a
site, it puts the organization at the
mercy of the district.
Stipek said that the change high
lights the desirability for the EPAA
to build its own site.
"Ultimately, it would be wonder
ful if we could raise the funds to
build our own building, and not be
at the whims of the district," Stipek
said.
Greely, however, cited the perma
nent nature of the Menlo Park facil
ity as a possible improvement.
Currently, the East Palo Alto site is
composed entirely of "portable"
spaces, while Flood will be leaving a
site that has a central permanent

building.
Greely also noted that the
switch would require significant
work to manage effectively.
"There are a lot of logistical
considerations," Greely said. "We
have to deal with the issues of
phones and computer networks."
In an email to The Daily, EPAA
K-8 Principal Nicki Smith said she
is aiming for a smooth transition
amidst the disruption of the move.
"1 was the principal of Slater
School in Mountain View which
was closed," Smith said, "and I
know how strongly a community
can feel about its school. We'll be
offering our parents a chance to go
and see Flood and I am very willing
to host Flood families at our pres
ent EPAA ES site [for a visit]."
