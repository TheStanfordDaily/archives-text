# 85 students admitted off waitlist
## 
### RYAN MAC DESK EDITOR 
Last week, the Office of Undergraduate
Admission announced that 85 students who
were previously on the waitlist had been
offered admission as part of the incoming
Class of 2013.
According to the office's Web site, the
decision to admit from the waitlist was
largely due to a change in admission strate
gy that saw the University admit fewer stu
dents this year than in years past.
"Although higher than expected student

responses have not allowed for the
University to go to the waitlist in recent
years, a reduction in the number of offers of
admission this year has resulted in the
planned use of the waitlist." read an online
statement.
Director of Admissions Shawn Abbott
confirmed this notion.
"It has been several years since we have
admitted students from the waitlist." he
wrote in an email to The Daily. "We lowered
our admit rate this past year, admitting MX)
fewer students in an intentional move to
avoid over-enrolling the freshman class. YVe

now have the flexibility to build up to 1.7(H)
students — accomplishing our goal of
ensuring that we would not enroll any more
than our target number [of] enrolled stu
dents."
In the previous two years, over-enroll
ment has contributed to an overcrowding of
undergraduate on-campus housing. This
year, the Office of Admission hoped to
avoid this problem by deliberately admit
ting fewer students and using the waitlist to
adjust numbers accordingly. "This led to a 7.6

percent admit rate,considerably less
than the 9.46 percent admitted for
the Class of 2012.
Other peer institutions have also
gone to their waitlist. Princeton,
with a yield of 59.7 percent, has
admitted 31 off its waitlist, while
Harvard, with a 76 percent yield,
will admit at least 85 students off its
waitlist. Yale has no plans to admit
from its waitlist as its yield of 68.7
percent has led to an already crowd
ed Class of 2013.
Unlike its peer institutions, how
ever, Stanford has yet to release its
final yield numbers.
"We will not be releasing the
yield for the incoming freshmen
until we have finished admitting the

class," Abbott said. "Since we have
admitted 85 students from the wait
list and will likely admit a few more,
it is premature to release that infor
mation."
As for other factors affecting
waitlist admittance and overall
yield, such as the current economy,
Abbott believes it too soon to make
conclusions.
"I cannot say for sure yet if the
current recession affected our
enrollment numbers thus far,"
Abbott wrote. "Please understand
that we have just begun to adminis
ter our admitted student question
naire. Once that survey deadline
passes and we have calculated and
analyzed our admitted student
responses, I might have a better idea
about the effect of the recession on
our enrollment numbers."
