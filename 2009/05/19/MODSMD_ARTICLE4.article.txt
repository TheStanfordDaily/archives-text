### ERIC MESSINGER DESK EDITOR 
Stanford received the British
Ambassador to the llnited States. Sir Nigel
Sheinwald.on Monday, as part of the diplo
mat's West Coast tour.
Sir Nigel has been visiting locations
across the West Coast, including Silicon
Valley, advocating for the continuation of a
commitment to open markets despite the
financial crisis, and commenting upon
Anglo-American relations.
While at Stanford, Sir Nigel spoke to
members of an undergraduate course on
British politics, participated in a roundtable
called "The Global Architecture — where
Europe fits in" at Encina Hall, and met
with Hoover Fellow and former Secretary
of State C'ondoleezza Rice.
Sir Nigel, who formerly served as Chief

Adviser to Prime Minister Tony Blair, also
sat down for an interview with ilie I )ailv at
Encina Hall. Over a half-hour he touched
upon a wide variety of issues facing
America and the I Jnited Kingdom, and the
"special relationship" between the two
nations.
Reacting to the recent scandal in the
U.K. over Parliamentary expense charges,
which foreign Secretary David Miliband
has said will make for a "dangerous month"
for British democracy. Sir Nigel connected
the public reaction to longer-term trends.
"All the evidence is that the scandal
over Parliamentary expenses has deepened
the mood of public disillusionment with
traditional politics and with Parliament as
an institution," Sir Nigel said, "and that is
very worrying for many of us who are
involved in public life, and it's been a wor
rying feature in many developed countries

tor quite some time.
Moving to President Obama. a figure
whose rise has arguably contributed to a
change in the tone of the US-Europe rela
tionship. Sir Nigel was warm in his assess
ment of the initial international reaction to
his administration.
"I think the overwhelming mood in the
U.K. and the rest of Europe is positive and
welcoming of the policy stance taken by the
new administration and by President
Obama." Sir Nigel said. "If you look at
what they're trying to achieve internation
ally in creating new sets of partnerships
with European and other allies, in basing
their foreign policy on values and principles
and the rule of law. in deploying the full
range of tools of American power — mili
tary and also political and also economic, in

British Ambassador to the United States Sir Nigel Sheinwald sat down with The Daily at Encina Hall on Monday for an interview. Sir
Nigel discussed a wide variety of subjects, including world reactions to President Obama and the challenges for world security.
being prepared to open a full dia
logue with adversaries, as well as
friends: all of these are things that
map pretty well to the way in which
we Europeans approach the broad
framework of our international rela
tions."
Sir Nigel emphasized, however,
that the international community was
facing a difficult set of problems in
both security and economics.
"Now we're on to the next phase
which is the phase of implementing
these policies," Sir Nigel said, "in try
ing to achieve results in a world which
is dangerous and difficult.
"All our governments are trying to
handle international and security
issues at the same time as we're all
handling the predominant issue, which
is getting our economies working
again, and having to keep so many
balls in the air as political leaders and
win public trust on that basis," he
added.
Sir Nigel noted that security issues
were a continuing crucial area for
Anglo-American coordination. The
British combat mission in Iraq offi
cially came to an end on April 30, and
Sir Nigel felt British troops left in a
satisfactory manner.
"We believe we are now leaving
Basra and the southeast part of the
country in a reasonable state to the
Iraqis who are capable of dealing
with both the political and the securi
ty challenges which lie ahead," Sir
Nigel said. "So our armed forces are
leaving with their heads held high
after a very difficult mission indeed."
With both the United States and
the United Kingdom sending addi
tional troops to Afghanistan in an
effort to stabilize the country. Sir
Nigel felt three factors were para
mount to achieve success.
"I think the first is to see the con
nections to Pakistan," Sir Nigel said.
"Not to equate Afghanistan with
Pakistan, because they're different
countries, but to recognize that you
won't make progress in either unless
you're able to make progress in both
— such are the inter-linkages
between the two sets of problems."
Sir Nigel also emphasized atten
tion to political considerations.
"The second thing is that you need
an integrated approach which is polit
ically driven," Sir Nigel said. "You're

dealing in Afghanistan which is an
insurgency, the Taliban, and we all
know from our history books that
you only defeat insurgencies through
political means, so you have to find a
way of ensuring that your political
strategy is dominant."
"Therefore you need to proceed
across a wide front — politically, eco
nomically and militarily — with
much more coordination than we've
seen so far," he added. "A great part
of that is trying to find a way of
encouraging reconciliation between
parts of the Taliban that are reconcil
able, that are not hardcore and deter
mined Taliban, but people who might
come across to normal politics with
encouragement."
Sir Nigel continued by noting the
importance of what he described as
"Afghanization," admitting that it
was an "ugly" word but emphasizing
the importance of building national
infrastructure.
"We're not going to achieve suc
cess in Afghanistan by pretending
that we can do it all ourselves — we
can't — and our exit strategy ulti
mately is through effective Afghan
security and through effective
Afghan institutions, so we have to
find a way of building them up. allow
ing them to take the responsibility."
Sir Nigel said.
Sir Nigel felt that policy coordina
tion between America and the
United Kingdom would continue
despite any political changes within
either country, including the possibili
ty of a transition in British govern
ment with upcoming elections.
"I think on Afghanistan actually
both the government and the opposi
tion have stressed what is now a very
clear part of the Obama administra
tion's policy, which is that we've got to
have a very clearly-defined and real
izable mission, which is publicly
understood," Sir Nigel said. "I think
that is related principally to avoiding
a situation where Afghanistan can
once again become a base for Al-
Qaeda. That's a strategic imperative.
That's what gives the mission its legit
imacy. and allows people to under
stand very clearly why we're there
and why we've been mandated by the
U.N. to be there."
In Sir Nigel's view, democratic ele
ments would have to form a part of
any workable solution to
Afghanistan's stability.
"You're not going to get
Jeffersonian democracy or
Westminster democracy overnight."
he said. "I don't think that the previ-

ous administration thought that was
going to happen — I know that our
government doesn't think that you
can achieve that quickly either — but
some element of representative gov
ernment is going to be important."
"I think it's important for us to
realize that that's what vast majority
of Afghanis want," he added, "that
they enjoy taking part in politics and
having the opportunity to express a
political choice. So I don't think we
should swing so far the other way as
to say that we would be happy if
Afghanistan returned to the dark
days of a feudal dictatorship; of
course that itself wouldn't provide
the stability and security that we
need."
Moving to the international finan
cial crisis. Sir Nigel expressed his

belief that moving away from open
market principles would be a mistake.
"We're absolutely convinced that
whatever changes are needed in terms
of the world financial system, the
answer doesn't lie in pulling down the
shutters on world trade, or going back
to protectionism, in order to "de-glob
alize," in order to pretend that what's
happened in the world over the last 20
years can be turned off," Sir Nigel
said. "We don't believe that's right,
and we believe that would actually sti
fle the growth which we hope will
return before too long to our econo
my; it would impoverish even further
the developing world because it
would close them off from the finance
that's needed for world trade."
"And we believe that London is
going to have a huge part to play in
that recovery when it comes in
months ahead," he added.
Closing with his personal take on
the core philosophy behind the "spe
cial relationship" between the U.S.
and the U.K., Sir Nigel focused on
three elements.
"I think the thing about the U.K.-
U.S. relationship, apart from a lot of
history — of all kinds," he said with a
laugh,"is that the partnership is glob
al. The partnership is not confined to
the military or intelligence area which
historically was the core in the
Second World War. but now extends
to the issues we've been discussing
today: to our economy, to sustainable
development and protecting the envi

"I think it passes the test of con
temporary relevance," he added.
Sir Nigel ended by saying that
while the long history of Anglo-
American relations was vital to
understanding their connections, his
eye is pointed towards the future.
"What matters is how we work
today," he said.
