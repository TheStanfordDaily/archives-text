## Over the Moon bean's 
### AMY HARRIS DESK EDITOR 
II is the nest ol limes and the worst ot times lor the
campus coffee scene. The announcement last
week that Coupa Cafe will replace Moonbean's
Coffee by the end of June spread like caffeine
through the Stanford bloodstream, brewing both
incredulity on the part of Moonbean's die-hards and
excitement from disenchanted customers and Coupa
fans.
"I'm devastated, for everyone," said a crestfallen

James Rundell, Moonbean's store manager. "Our cus
tomers are saying.'Where's the petition?' li s wonder
ful to hear that outcry of support "
Coupa Cafe already has a spot in the Jerry Yang and
Akiko Yama/aki Environment and Hnergy Building
(Y2li2). The news of Coupa's takeover giving it two
locations on campus — blind-sided many students, who
were perfectly content with the status quo.
"Moonbean's is definitely one of the high points to
eat and drink on campus." said Loren Newman '(R "I
like the Coupa Cafes in the area, but it seems like it's a
case of if it's not broken, why fix it. It seems like it's tak

ing a gamble on something that already works well."
Ciianna Masi '11. a Moonbean's barista who began
working at the kiosk this year, was likewise confused by
Coupa's move to replace Moonbean's.
"Everyone who I've talked to is really shocked that
Moonbean's is closing and they don't really understand
why," she said. "And to an extent. I don't really under
stand why It's sad that such a beloved coffee shop on
campus has to close."
Others, however, are over the moon about the coffee
kiosk's demise.
"Going to Moonbean's was like getting
beaten over the head with a stick," said Paul
Gowder, a third-year political science grad
uate student. "Moonbean's — I mean, let's
face it — was pretty terrible in just about
every respect, so Coupa can only be better."
Gowder said he would try to refrain from
too many "ding-dong-the-witch-is-dead"
comments, but was unable to hide his sheer
jubilation at Coupa's takeover.
"The prices at Moonbean's were insane
— you could only eat so many $2.50 cookies,
especially when they're not very good cook
ies," he continued. "You know, Coupa's
prices are pretty ridiculous too. but Coupa
actually has high-quality food and drinks."
Coupa Cafe owner Jean Paul Coupal
'07 agreed that the installation of

Coupa between the two
libraries represents a step up
in culinary value, and a
decrease in prices. A
"Currently, the lattes. ■
cappuccinos, all of our cof- V
fee drinks are cheaper than ■
Moonbean's," Coupal m
explained. "There's not one m
drink we have that is more 1
expensive than Moonbean s. \
We think you should be able
to get quality at an affordable

price."
Still, some students have
nostalgic attachments to the
funky kiosk and see Coupa's
expansion as uprooting an
eclectic cafe culture that took

years to cultivate.
"No one can compete with our
staff in terms of speed, efficiency and

attention to detail" Rundell said. "It takes
10 years to get a group like this going."
Situated between Meyer and Green for
11 years, Moonbean's adopted the business
model of creating a laid-back environment
with unique tunes and friendly service,
Rundell explained.
"I would always hear people say that
they love this place, that it was a breath of
fresh air from an otherwise 'stale' campus
life," he said. "We tried to cater to students
with our music — we don't play just jazz and
new age. I think that we try to keep it fun
and something that the students like, as
opposed to something that the students'
parents would like ... definitely outside the
cookie-cutter mold."
Students appreciated Moonbean's

unpretentious atmosphere.
"It's hard to put into words, hut
Moonbean's just has the right vibe and the
right connection of that vibe to the coffee
and tea" Newman explained. "It's just a
pleasant atmosphere."
Gowder. however, felt that any sojourn to
Moonbean's was anything but pleasant.
"If I needed a quick jolt of caffeine, there
was a convenience versus quality factor, and
sometimes, convenience won out," he
lamented. "I did go to Moonbean's very
many times, unfortunately."
"The sort of quintessential Moonbean's
moment, for me, was ordering a chai there,
with the use of god-awful chai swill." he con
tinued. "I mean, God only knows if it had
any tea in it."

Gowder's experience, however, seemed
the exception rather than the rule. Ben
Angulo '11 frequents Moonbean's daily, and
while he's disappointed at Moonbean's clos
ing. he was more concerned with the loca
tion than the change in ownership.
"I love Moonbean's ... it's just a good
atmosphere," he said. "You can come out
here on a sunny day and sit down and run
into 20 people you know."
Clair Gibson *09 said that getting her caf
feine fix was the ultimate issue, regardless of
owner, but dismissed Coupa's need to
expand to two on-campus locations as
"silly."
"Moonbean's has the best coffee on cam
pus, so I don't see why Coupa needs to take
over here when they already have a shop in
Y2E2," she said.
C'oupal said that he

understands the sentimental ties to
Moonbean's, but assured customers that the
new Coupa location will not disappoint.
"People do consider Moonbean's sym
bolic; it's been there for such a long time
since the SULAIR constructed it.and I
guess some people may be upset about it
closing," Coupal conceded. "But it's a free
market society, everyone was given a chance
to compete, and I think that the better com
pany with the better proposal was chosen."
But for the Moonbean's workers, the end
of Moonbean's represents an end to a
unique campus niche that, for many, was a
home away from home.
"We're not one of those machine coffee
shops that just churns it out." Masi said. "I
feel like we really do care about our cus
tomers. even though that's really cliche to
say."
Rundell said that the staff interaction
was Moonbean's most unique characteristic.
"I was rewarded with a cafe culture at
Moonbean's that most cafes wish they could
have." he said.
To replace that sort of dynamic will
be a tall order. Masi said.
"You would be hard-pressed to
find a more caring coffee shop than
||k Moonbean's." she said. "Coupa has
■ Pi big shoes to fill."

Moonbean's, located just outside of Green Library, has been a popular coffee stop on campus for 11 years. After losing a bid war for a
renewed lease, Moonbean's will close by the end of June to be replaced by Coupa Cafe, which also has a location in Y2E2.
