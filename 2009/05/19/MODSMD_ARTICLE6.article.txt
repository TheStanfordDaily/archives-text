## Hours at Green likely to shorten Budget cuts threaten to roll back new, post-midnight opening times 
### ELLEN HUET STAFF WRITER 
Students who celebrated Green Library's
extended late night hours this academic year may
see the gift taken back next fall due to the
University's budget crisis.
Stanford Libraries, along with the rest of the
school, have been required to trim budgets by 15 per
cent because of decreased endowment and the cur
rent economic recession, and are finding it difficult to
maintain extended hours with reduced funding.
Green, the largest library on campus and a pop
ular study space for undergraduates, pushed back its
closing time from midnight to 2 a.m. in the fall of
2(KW in response to overwhelming student demand
for increased post-midnight study spaces.
Former undergraduate Senator Eugene Nho '10
organized the student effort, conducting a wide sur
vey that found that SO percent of students surveyed
felt the current late night study spaces were inade
quate. After going to the Faculty Senate with the
statistics in the spring of 2(M)<K. the changes were
made for the following fall.
Given the current budget restrictions, however,
the extended schedule appears unlikely to survive
into the next academic year. Provost John
Etchemendv noted the strong possibility of a
change.
"I do not know if the hours are changing, but
given the budget situation. I'd be surprised if they
are not." Etchemendv said in an email to The Daily.
Library administrators agreed, noting that hours
might be scaled back to 1 a.m. or even to the origi
nal midnight closing time.
"(A change] is conceivable, given the 15 percent
budget reduction, which is a very deep cut," said
Rebecca Pernell. head of access services for the
library. "The University Librarian Michael Keller
has indicated that due to the budget cuts, we may
not be able to sustain the extended hours next fall."
"We are, however, looking at creative solutions
for perhaps staffing the library until I a.m., but
these plans are still very preliminary." she added.
Keller could not be reached for comment.
Pernell added that budget issues have already
affected the library, as the staff has been reduced
because of the University-wide hiring freeze imple
mented earlier this year.
For Nho. the news that his efforts to extend
hours might not last the year was disappointing but
understandable.
"I completely respect the place that administra
tors are in now." he said. "They're hard hit by the
dropping endowment, and they have to cut some
where. It's hard to figure out how to make cuts with
out inflicting too much damage on the student body
life."
However, he maintained that "ensuring student
study spaces should be one of the University's top
priorities." citing the results from last year's survey
and positive student feedback to the changes.
Next year's ASSI undergraduate senators, both
returning and incoming, expressed their intention to
advocate lor keeping Green l.ibrarv's current
