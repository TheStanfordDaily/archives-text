						farewell to Moonbean's 
### 
For 11 years.students have enjoyed the
fresh coffee, convenient location and
trendy atmosphere of Moonbean's, a
coffee shop |list between Meyer and Green
Libraries, that for many students is an inte
gral part of Stanford. Hut Moonbean's will
no longer occupy that spot come June 30.
when Stanford will commence with infra
structure upgrades to the site and prepare
for a ( oupa ("ale kiosk to open there in early
September.
Moonbean's contract was first let in
IWi. then renewed without competition in
2003 and finally extended until June 30,2009
alter it expired in December 2008, while
Stanford received bids for the space on cam
pus. It made one of four bids that were care
fully examined by the University, but lost
out to Coupa Cafe, which currently has a
kiosk in Y2E : .2 in addition to a location in
Palo Alto. ITie change has come as an un
welcome shock to many students who have
become attached to Moonbean's over the
years and has even sparked an on-campus
petition to retain Moonbean's in its current
location.
While the Daily editorial board under
stands these natural student responses in the
face of dosing a coffee shop that has charac
terized a part of the Stanford experience, we
ulso undeistand the I diversity decision to
open up the location to a competitive bid in
a year plagued by ;i diminishing endowment
and painful budget cuts across the board.
( her the past weeks, we have written about
our concerns over budget cuts for communi
ty centers and Summer Research College,
tiie lack ol need-blind financial aid for inter
national students, the need for continued
funding of service learning initiatives like
Impact Abroad, the inequities of the new
Vaden service charge for next year — and
the list does not end there.The I Jniversitv is

laced with tough choices in a period of finan
cial strain, so it is understandable to choose
to open up a campus location to competitive
bids that will increase the revenues it can
generate from prime retail space near the
well-trafficked Stanford libraries. Moon
bean's has contributed to Stanford for 11
years.and will be missed by many students.as
they walk between Meyer and Green. But
C'oupa may yet prove to be a positive new
addition to campus. We would only recom
mend retaining some of the friendly Moon
bean's employees who brighten the coffee
shop's atmosphere — and earn many repeat
customers.
One of the biggest fears surrounding the
new change is the apparent market domi
nance ( 'oupa will have with two locations on
campus and no competing coffee shop with
in walking distance. In announcing the
change. University Librarian Michael Keller
praised Coupa for its sound business plan,
proven environmental responsibility, profes
sional management and "wonderful social
consciousness." ITie editorial board encour
ages Coupa and Stanford to be wary of the
effects of a seeming monopoly on coffee
shops and keep prices that are low and af
fordable for all students.
Moonbean's will be missed, and we will
have to wait and see if it is able to secure an
other venue on campus. But its important to
keep in mind that Coupa is a family-owned
store and its owners. Jean Paul and Nancy
Coupal. have many connections to the Uni
versity. including three children who have
graduated from Stanford. Coupa has gotten
rave reviews in the Bay Area, and students
have responded positively to the cafe in
Y2F.2. Amid severe budget cuts and further
upcoming disputes as more programs are
trimmed or axed, a farewell to Moonbean's
is a sad but understandable change.
