international prizes for his research that laid the groundwork in recombinant DMA technology
and the biotechnology revolution. Dr. Berg was one of the principal pioneers in gene splicing
and he shared the 19X0 Nobel Prize for developing methods that made it possible to map the
structure and function of DMA.
I>r. Berg's contributions to science and society will be presented by Lucy Shapiro, the
