## His work at our fingertips After three years, the Martin Luther King, Jr., Research & Education Institute completes its project to make King documents publicly available online 
### ELIZABETH TITUS CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
The young man wrote home a few
times the summer before he
entered college. He asked his mom
to check his test scores and wished
for her homemade fried chicken.
He assured his dad he was staying out of
trouble.
"I am not doing anything that I would not
[be] doing [in] front of you." he wrote.
In another letter, he told them about his
travels.
"After we passed Washington [there] was
no discrimination at all." he wrote. "We go to
any place we want to and sit any where we
want to."
The young man was Martin Luther King,
Jr.. and to track his life through the docu
ments he left behind — letters like these —
scholars have long had to navigate a maze of
books, archives and Web sites to find where
these documents exist.
But on Monday, the Martin Luther King.
Jr., Research & Education Institute at
Stanford aimed to simplify that search by
launching a free online database (http://king
papers.org) with information on 1 (K) years of
King- and civil rights-related documents.
Major documents cover the Montgomery Bus
Boycott and more records will be added, staff
said.
"'lTiis is the only public database on King
archives that provides scholarly details and
description on each individual item." wrote
Institute Director Clayborne Carson in a
released statement. "It will prove to be of
immense value to King researchers and indi
viduals interested in the life and work of Dr.
King and the civil rights movement."
The project was funded by a three-year.
$450,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon

Foundation, according to Carson. Two other
institutions lent assistance — the Morehouse
College King Papers at Atlanta University
Center and the Howard Gotlieb Archival
Research Center at Boston University.
Historians agree the database is an impor
tant step toward opening history to a broader
audience.
"I think this is one of the most forward
looking projects in the scholarly world today,
and one of the most important." said Michael
Honey, a King scholar at the University of
Washington. Taconia. The author of three
books on labor and civil rights history, he said
he finds it increasingly difficult to get access to
King's papers.
Carson told The Daily that the project was
"democratizing research."
"There's always been an elitism in scholar
ly research that those who have resources can
do much better work than those who don't
have resources," he said."When we [the King
Institute] started our work in 1985, my guess is
that there weren't more than a dozen people
in the world who were doing concerted King
research. Now. anyone with access to a com
puter and an Internet connection can engage
in the same kind of research."
Carson's vision for the database, then, was
foreshadowed in a way by what King wrote to
the editor of The Atlanta Constitution as a
college junior:
"We want and are entitled to the basic
rights and opportunities of American citi
zens," he wrote, including "equal opportuni
ties in education."
That, the Institute intends, is where
Online King Records Access —or OKRA
— comes in.

OKRA works like this: A simple screen on
kingpapers.org allows users to search by
detailed criteria — bv author, title and date, of

course, hut also by topic, names involved and
genre. Selecting "City of Montgomery v.
Martin L. King" from the topic list provided
by the Institute yields four results, including
King's arrest warrant and court transcripts.
Entering "Paul. Saint" returns 18 records.
Searching by genre, 13 "manifestos" come
back.
The records — and the project — have
limitations. Because the King family holds
copyright on many of King's papers, the
Institute can't put original documents online.
Instead, the database directs users to where
they can see the documents — whether in one
of the nation's many King archives, the
Institute's six-volume "The Papers of Martin
Luther King, Jr.." the Institute's campus office
or elsewhere.
And adding records is time-consuming.
Institute staff had to spend more than a year
updating their internal database before the
public launch. Even then, the database only
contains records through 1958. Records
through 1960 will be added by the end of the
year, staff members said, and once they pub
lish the rest of the 14-volume "Paper" series,
records for those documents will go online
too.
That means that by December, the public
database will hold about B.(XX) records — a
fraction of the nearly 7(),(X)0 documents
entered by undergraduate research assistants
into the Institute's internal database since
1985.
Staff members emphasized the value of
the public records, which Archival Assistant
Josh Kunz called "the best of the best."
"These documents are now considered the
most historically important." he said.
Archival Assistant Stacey Zwald added
that her favorite documents showed her that
"really, there is an army" of players in the civil
rights movement.
Andrew Schneider '09. a history major

writing a thesis on King's opposition to the
Vietnam War. agreed that primary documents
shed light on the movement's players.
"Browsing through the King documents, it
immediately becomes apparent that MLK
was hut one leader in a larger movement." he
said. "The release of thousands of new docu
ments about MLK and the civil rights move
ment would be of great use to any student
writing a research paper, working on an in
class presentation or writing an honors the
sis."
Susan Englander. an associate director of
the Institute, explained that any Stanford stu
dent may ask to look at the physical docu
ments that he or she encounters in the data
base.
"We welcome Stanford students to come
by." she said. "We consider ourselves a
resource and we hope more people will avail
themselves of us."
"Students would have to check in with the
staff in most cases." Englander added regard
ing requests. "Just being curious about King is
good enough for me."
In his small office at the Institute on Via
Ortega, Carson — who edited King's autobi
ography—discussed the future of access to
historic documents.
"We have to overcome [the copyright)

obstacle," he said."l'm relatively certain that
we will. Probably within the next couple
years, we will make many documents avail
able."
"liopefully in the age of the Internet, doc
uments can be digitized and made available."
he added. "Research will still be hard, but I
think researchers will be able to undertake
more ambitious topics."
Maybe even young researchers.
Carson remembers when his daughter,
then a Palo Alto High School student, report
ed that her history textbook said that King
launched the Freedom Rides of 1%1.
"I could imagine now. a student coming in
and saying. "The history textbook is wrong.'"
he described. "'I know from looking at an
interview with Dianne Nash, who was one of
the leaders of the Freedom Rides, that she
wasn't a follower of Martin Luther King, that
she did it in order to push him to act.'"
"Why can't a high school student come up
with a new interpretation?" Carson said with
a smile.
With the help of OKRA, that reality —
while slow in coming — may be near.

papers.org) with information on 1 (K) years of
King- and civil rights-related documents.
Major documents cover the Montgomery Bus
Boycott and more records will be added, staff
said.
"'lTiis is the only public database on King
archives that provides scholarly details and
description on each individual item." wrote
Institute Director Clayborne Carson in a
released statement. "It will prove to be of
immense value to King researchers and indi
viduals interested in the life and work of Dr.
King and the civil rights movement."
The project was funded by a three-year.
$450,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon

Foundation, according to Carson. Two other
institutions lent assistance — the Morehouse
College King Papers at Atlanta University
Center and the Howard Gotlieb Archival
Research Center at Boston University.
Historians agree the database is an impor
tant step toward opening history to a broader
audience.
"I think this is one of the most forward
looking projects in the scholarly world today,
and one of the most important." said Michael
Honey, a King scholar at the University of
Washington. Taconia. The author of three
books on labor and civil rights history, he said
he finds it increasingly difficult to get access to
King's papers.
Carson told The Daily that the project was
"democratizing research."
"There's always been an elitism in scholar
ly research that those who have resources can
do much better work than those who don't
have resources," he said."When we [the King
Institute] started our work in 1985, my guess is
that there weren't more than a dozen people
in the world who were doing concerted King
research. Now. anyone with access to a com
puter and an Internet connection can engage
in the same kind of research."
Carson's vision for the database, then, was
foreshadowed in a way by what King wrote to
the editor of The Atlanta Constitution as a
college junior:
"We want and are entitled to the basic
rights and opportunities of American citi
zens," he wrote, including "equal opportuni
ties in education."
That, the Institute intends, is where
Online King Records Access —or OKRA
— comes in.

OKRA works like this: A simple screen on
kingpapers.org allows users to search by
detailed criteria — bv author, title and date, of

course, hut also by topic, names involved and
genre. Selecting "City of Montgomery v.
Martin L. King" from the topic list provided
by the Institute yields four results, including
King's arrest warrant and court transcripts.
Entering "Paul. Saint" returns 18 records.
Searching by genre, 13 "manifestos" come
back.
The records — and the project — have
limitations. Because the King family holds
copyright on many of King's papers, the
Institute can't put original documents online.
Instead, the database directs users to where
they can see the documents — whether in one
of the nation's many King archives, the
Institute's six-volume "The Papers of Martin
Luther King, Jr.." the Institute's campus office
or elsewhere.
And adding records is time-consuming.
Institute staff had to spend more than a year
updating their internal database before the
public launch. Even then, the database only
contains records through 1958. Records
through 1960 will be added by the end of the
year, staff members said, and once they pub
lish the rest of the 14-volume "Paper" series,
records for those documents will go online
too.
That means that by December, the public
database will hold about B.(XX) records — a
fraction of the nearly 7(),(X)0 documents
entered by undergraduate research assistants
into the Institute's internal database since
1985.
Staff members emphasized the value of
the public records, which Archival Assistant
Josh Kunz called "the best of the best."
"These documents are now considered the
most historically important." he said.
Archival Assistant Stacey Zwald added
that her favorite documents showed her that
"really, there is an army" of players in the civil
rights movement.
Andrew Schneider '09. a history major

writing a thesis on King's opposition to the
Vietnam War. agreed that primary documents
shed light on the movement's players.
"Browsing through the King documents, it
immediately becomes apparent that MLK
was hut one leader in a larger movement." he
said. "The release of thousands of new docu
ments about MLK and the civil rights move
ment would be of great use to any student
writing a research paper, working on an in
class presentation or writing an honors the
sis."
Susan Englander. an associate director of
the Institute, explained that any Stanford stu
dent may ask to look at the physical docu
ments that he or she encounters in the data
base.
"We welcome Stanford students to come
by." she said. "We consider ourselves a
resource and we hope more people will avail
themselves of us."
"Students would have to check in with the
staff in most cases." Englander added regard
ing requests. "Just being curious about King is
good enough for me."
In his small office at the Institute on Via
Ortega, Carson — who edited King's autobi
ography—discussed the future of access to
historic documents.
"We have to overcome [the copyright)

obstacle," he said."l'm relatively certain that
we will. Probably within the next couple
years, we will make many documents avail
able."
"liopefully in the age of the Internet, doc
uments can be digitized and made available."
he added. "Research will still be hard, but I
think researchers will be able to undertake
more ambitious topics."
Maybe even young researchers.
Carson remembers when his daughter,
then a Palo Alto High School student, report
ed that her history textbook said that King
launched the Freedom Rides of 1%1.
"I could imagine now. a student coming in
and saying. "The history textbook is wrong.'"
he described. "'I know from looking at an
interview with Dianne Nash, who was one of
the leaders of the Freedom Rides, that she
wasn't a follower of Martin Luther King, that
she did it in order to push him to act.'"
"Why can't a high school student come up
with a new interpretation?" Carson said with
a smile.
With the help of OKRA, that reality —
while slow in coming — may be near.

On Monday, Online King Records Access (OKRA) was launched, making thousands of
records related to Dr. King and the civil rights movement available to the public. Many more
documents are to be added by the end of the year.
