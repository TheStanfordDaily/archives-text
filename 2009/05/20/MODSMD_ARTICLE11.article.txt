## EDITORIAL Relax restrictions on rescheduling finals 
### 
With spring quarter almost over, most
Stanford undergraduates who will
not be staying on campus over the
summer have already lined up a job or in
ternship outside of the University. Regard
less of their department or the nature of their
academic pursuits, most students in the
spring quarter are already thinking ahead to
their summer plans off campus.
Hut while a Stanford affiliation often
makes it easier for students to find work for
the summer, many are also at a disadvantage
when it comes to coordinating the end of the
spring quarter with the schedule of a summer
job or internship. At a time when the econo
my has fewer jobs to offer college students —
and when having summer work experience is
practically a prerequisite for many careers
and graduate programs — the editorial
board would like to see more professors em
bracing flexibility with final exam schedules
to help students who need to leave campus
early.
Asa result of the University's quarter sys
tem. summer for Stanford students has con
sistently begun several weeks later than
those of students at peer universities. Final
exams officially end this weekend for stu
dents at Harvard and Princeton, while Yale
has been done with exams since May 12.
Those extra weeks often create problems for
Stanford students hoping to land an intern
ship that is scheduled to begin in late May or
early June, when most other college students
would already be done with classes. In all too
many cases, students are forced to make a
choice between putting off a required course
or turning down a good internship because it
begins too early.
Students in the humanities are in some in

stances able to leave campus early more eas
ily than others. In classes which require a
final paper or take-home final in place of a
seated exam in a classroom, a student's phys
ical presence on campus is not usually re
quired to complete a course. Courses in eco
nomics, chemistry, engineering, math and
other technical majors are, in general, more
difficult to complete early, simply because
they are designed to culminate in a massive
in-class, closed-book exam taken by several
hundred students at one time.
In the past, many large lecture courses —
most notably in computer science — have of
fered alternative final exam dates in advance
of the official final. Some professors will also
make individual arrangements for students
needing to leave early. While professors are
not required by the registrar to offer early
final exam options, the editorial board would
recommend that all professors consider of
fering alternative options, at least in the
spring quarter, for students who need to
leave campus early for work-related reasons.
Professors should also highlight these op
tions at the beginning of spring quarter when
reviewing the syllabus and class structure: we
would not want to deter students who are too
shy or feel like they are imposing on their
professors because they are not aware such
options exist.
In keeping with the founding spirit of
Stanford as a university focused on con
tributing to the larger world — and recogniz
ing the considerable strain students are
under just to find summer work — faculty
members should be understanding of stu
dents' obligations and help them as much as
possible to reconcile their summer plans with
spring exams.
