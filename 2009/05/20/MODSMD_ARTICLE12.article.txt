## Students fast in solidarity with community center staff 
### 
From Tuesday, May 1 8, to Friday. May 22,
13 students will fast each day. represent
ing all 13 community center staff who
were put on reduced time since the VPSA
budget cuts were made.Through this fast, we
hope to show the administration that the Stan
lord community is serious about this issue and
is joining in solidarity to support our commu
nity center staff.
The six community centers represent
only six percent of VPSA staff, yet they were
25 percent of the staff impacted by budget
cuts. For the past several months, students
have supported this fight against these dis
proportionate community center cuts and
the lack of transparency in the budget cuts.
On March 6 and April 24. more than KM) stu
dents and workers rallied in support of Stan
ford's community centers and greater trans
parency. ()n April 24. four members of Con
cerned Students for Community Centers
(CSCC) met with Vice Provost Cireg Board
man and Sally I )ickson to demand that com
munity center stall positions be fully re
stored and that the VPSA release a public
account of the budget cuts. The following
week, nearly 300 members of the Stanford
community sent emails to Vice Provost
Boardman expressing serious concerns
about the budget cuts. Two weeks ago, stu
dents hand-delivered a letter to the VPSA
office every hour on the hour.
Despite such an outpouring of support on
behalf of this cause. Vice Provost Boardman
has failed to address our concerns promptly.
After three weeks of trying to set up an addi
tional meeting with him through emails and
letter deliveries, Boardman finally agreed to
meet with us again. His failure to respond in

a timely fashion was both disappointing and
frustrating. The Vice Provost of Student Af
fairs should be addressing student affairs, yet
all we have received up until this point is a
recitation of the same information we al
ready knew and inaction on his part.
Given Vice Provost Boardman's inability
to take action, we have no choice but to turn
to Provost Etchemendy and urge him to take
action immediately. As Provost. John
Etchemendy is responsible for overseeing
I Jniversity-wide budget cuts. We still believe
that the cuts to VPSA staff disproportionate
ly affect community center staff and that
placing community center staff on reduced
time will result in increased staff turnover in
the future. We are frustrated by the lack of
transparency and student input in the process
of making these budget cuts.
ITius. we are lasting to show solidarity in
support of our community centers and the
staff. By putting the staff on reduced time,
the VPSA is taking something vital away
from the larger Stanford community. We
are making these sacrifices to demonstrate
that these are matters that affect all of us. A
vibrant, diverse student body is fundamen
tal to our growth as global citizens. As stu
dents. we should have our voices heard in
how the University is run. In these final few
weeks of the year, we need the Stanford
community to take action by joining this
movement to restore community center
staff to full-time and fighting for greater
transparency.
