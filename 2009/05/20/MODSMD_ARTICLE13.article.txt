# Letter to the Editor
## 
### 
The May IK article, "Execs look back on
time in office." made a few errors in reporting,
and. more importantly, set a tone that is very
different than how we feel about our time in
office.
We believe the blame for this is mixed
we probably spent quite some time in the in
terview discussing things we wished we'd
done better, areas we could have improved
and specific challenges we faced. We are
both introspective,and have been thinking a
lot about our numerous errors and short
comings. ITiat said, we believe The Daily lo
dised disproportionally on this, underem
phasi/ed the more positive things we shared
and made some key errors that really
change the meaning of some statements.
lor example, l agan discussed the "divi
sive" Senate as something we had to over

come, not a "diverse" Senate as some chal
lenge we faced. Obviously, that word change
has a substantial impact on meaning. In gen
eral. we were frustrated by how our senti
ments surrounding our efforts on public
service and diversity seemed a hit distorted
or taken out of context. We couldn't be more
pleased with our advocacy on behalf of com
munity centers, the CCF, the Student Service
Division and the Stanford Service Summit.
We are both extremely pleased with our
term in office and so glad to have served in
the ASSIJ. It was an amazing experience,
and we are very proud of our initiatives.
Most importantly, we're proud of our team.
Hie ASSIJ Ixec accomplished a lot this
year, but only a small sliver of that was
ihanks to the two of us.That's why we want
ed to write a letter to the editor and clarify

our thoughts. While we both admit to being
full of faults we want to fix. and would have
done some things differently were we to
have one more year in office, we are un
equivocally proud of what we as a team ac
complished this year. Our team was made
up of some of the most amazing people
we've had the pleasure of knowing, and to
gether they entirely changed the tone of the
ASSU and launched a variety of projects
that will have a major impact on this cam
pus. Working with this phenomenal group
made our ASSU term one of the most fulfill
ing times of our lives, and we will never be
able to thank our cabinet, Fxec fellows and
other collaborators enough
