# Too Big to Fail
## Stuff white people are ambivalent about 
### 
This column was originally published Feb. IS.
It's a new day —at least, according to
will.i.am. I don't know about you. but when
someone teleports into the CNN newsroom
and starts speaking, I listen.
So, even as the global economy collapses and
our planet corrodes into a noxious wasteland,
the good news is that racism is over in America!
Baby, it doesn't matter if you're black or white
— Michael Jackson has long since evolved into
his own species, and the rest of us are discovering
true equality in all being equally screwed.
That's right, white people. Country clubs
aren't cool any more, and the only person look
ing good in J. Crew is Michelle Obama.
Doubtless the end of white societal hegemo
ny is a good thing, especially considering that
the most significant cultural contributions by
Caucasian Americans recently have been
sweaters for dogs and crystal meth.
Still, there are bound to be some hard feel
ings. White people used to be a big deal in Amer
ica.and now they're just like everyone else.
Haven't you seen "Gran Torino?"
Nowadays, white people are divided into
two camps: those who check "Stuff White Peo
ple Like" on a regular basis, and those who
throwTupperware parties.
This first kind of white person feels conflict
ed. She wants to frolic joyously into the glorious
post-racial future, but even more than that, she
wants to be part of a milieu that doesn't cele
brate chastity balls.
Hail, overzealous yuppie Caucasian, and
embrace me as your true sister! But alas, we are
both deluded.TTie authors of "Stuff White Peo
ple Like" want to convince us that the remorse
and ethnic longing that dictates our hobbies and
tastes is the basis of a legitimate culture, and we
let them.
It's time we be honest with ourselves.To be
white and self-respecting in America right now is
to doubt one's self. And if you don't know who
you are. how do you know what you actually
enjoy?

What follows is a list — admittedly quite in
complete — of stuff that white people are am
bivalent about. I can't say it's going to help you
any but if there's anything white people love
right now. it's reading about themselves. Here we
go
1. ()ther white people
Don't worry — we're not like the rest of
them. I'm Jewish. You're one-fourth Scandina
vian. three-eighths French, two-sixths Irish and
6.25 percent Cherokee. And having successfully
linked your whiteness to a cultural tradition of
oppression and/or socialism,you are now free to
identify any remaining white acquaintances and
treat them with appropriate contempt.
Kevin Webb, for instance, is one of the few in
exorably white people I know, and though he
owns only 50 percent of this column, he is by de
fault 1(X) percent responsible for the havoc that
white people have wreaked upon America.
Feel free to email him with your complaints
about Fox News. NASCAR and the continued
production of "The Hills." He will take a break
from smoking cigars and drinking bourbon to
smile patronizingly and promise to put you in
touch with "his [white] people."
Because I know that none of that has any
thing to do with us. At least. I'm pretty sure.
2. Russia
Uninterrupted substance abuse. Artificial
ly — and unconvincingly — blond women. A
rich history of bigotry against ethnic and cul
tural minorities. 'ITiese are just three of the
many things that rural America and Russia
have in common. Yet for some reason, the for
mer territory is "our heartland." while the lat
ter remains a "global nuclear threat."
There must be something to be said of a
country that manages to crank out phonebook
length tomes on a regular basis, though, right?
(Or maybe they just haven't discovered
You Tube yet.) After all. white people believe
firmly in the transcendent power of literature to
really bring people together.

Still, it's pretty bad how Russians go around
wearing fur all the time. On the other hand, who
are we to try to impose our own mores on a cul
ture we don't entirely understand?
3. Consumerism
OMG. have you bought the new ninja war
rior app for the iPhone 3G? Neither have 1. be
cause buying stuff is so indulgent and needlessly
wasteful.
But in times like these, shouldn't we be pro
moting technological innovation and boosting
the American economy? Sure we should, which
is why I just bought the past three seasons of "30
Rock" on Amazon. I promise to recycle them
when I'm done, and to build an orphanage in a
third-world country with my bare hands as
penance.
I still feel terrible about it. though.
4. Britney Spears/Lindsay l ohan/Jessica Simp
son
The fact that these women are apparently
our only remaining cultural exports goes far to
explain the problems in America today. Still,
there's something deeply appealing about the
underdog — especially if you're white and fan
tasize about being one yourself — and if a 20-
something multi-billionaire struggling with the
expectations of a demanding and lecherous pub
lic father isn't an underdog. 1 don't know who is.
Like the current state of the economy, these
starlets' collective demise is undeniable proof
that ours is a broken and mendacious social sys
tem. No one is blameless. Which is why Jessica
Simpson's weight really matters. Apparently.
5. Bipartisanship
1 mean ... it was a really great idea. Wasn't it?
