# The 						Voice of Experience
## Re-fire Rummy 
### 
There was a great deal of outrage at Stan
ford back in the fall of 2(M)7. when the
Hoover Institution awarded Donald
Rumsfeld, former Secretary of Defense, a one
year visiting fellowship.
["he San Francisco Chronicle reported on the
controversy, quoting the Hoover Institution's di
rector John Raisian as saying,"Don has had im
mense experience in public service,and has much
to contribute to society as a result. I am pleased
that he will spend time during the coming year in
thinking, writing and advising on important mat
ters of public policy."
()n the other side of the issue. Stanford Prof.
Barton Bernstein blasted Rumsfeld.
"I le is a profoundly immoral man," he said.
"The 1 l(H)ver Institution has long been a refuge
for right-wing Republicans, hut what makes this
unusually disgraceful is Rumsfelds involvement
in a war started for reasons unprovable, un
proven and demonstrably wrong."
I tended tocome down on the anti-Rumsfeld
side. I had thought that Rumsfeld had been an in
competent Secretary of Defense, perhaps even

bordering on criminally negligent, and I didn't
feel that the I loover Institute should reward his
poor performance with such an honor.
Now. I understand that the Institution tends
to be Right-leaning, and 1 disagree with many of
its fellows, but I completely support its right to
gather legitimate scholars, regardless of how I
feel about their views.
But Rumsfeld was another matter. Not only
did he not have an academic background, but his
actions as Secretary of Defense were inept at best
and destructive at worst. I lis decision to send in
too few tnxips with Ux> little equipment cost
thousands of American lives, hundreds of thou
sands of Iraqi lives and led to the lawlessness and
breakdown of Iraqi society in the aftermath of
the war.
I 'II never forget the scenes of Iraqis lex iting t he
country's museums and other cultural institu
tions. Even today, the country's relative calm is
fragile, and due largely to the fact that ethnic
cleansing has eliminated many opportunities for
Shiite-Sunni violence. 1 >et us not be lulled by th«
lack of news out of Iraq into believing the coun
try will be stable and democratic any time stxm.
In September 2(X)7. General Sir Mike Jack
son.the head of the British army during the Iraq
invasion, called Rumsfeld's approach "intellec
tually bankrupt." Sir Malcolm Rifkind.a Con
servative Ml' and former defense minister
added. "I think one of the most fundamental
criticisms is not just that Rumsfeld was incom
petent — which he was — but his boss. George
Bush, actually made the extraordinary decision
tii put the Pentagon and Rumsfeld in control of
political nation-building after the actual war
ended."
And yet.despite all this. I didn't actively join in
any of the anti-Rumsfeld protests. I decided to
give him the last shred of the benefit of the doubt.
That remaining shred was blown aw ay by rev
elations by (iO magazine this past Sunday, based
on investigative journalism done by Robert
Draper. Apparently, during the first few months
of the Iraq war. Rumsfeld began adding cover
sheets to his top-secret intelligence briefings to
President Bush, at the suggestion of one of his
staff members. The cover sheets mixed photos
from the front with biblical quotations in a
grotesque and transparent attempt to sell the
war's progress to the religious minded President.

A cover sheet from March 17. 2( I) 3 shows
American soldiers praying, automatic weapons
in hand, captioned by the quotation "Here I am
Lord.Send me!"(lsaiah 6:8). On March 31 ,a dra
matic image of an M 1 tank in front of a blazing
sunset was captioned by Ephesians 6:13: "There
fore, put on the full armor of God, so that when
the day of evil comes, you may be able to stand
your ground..."
As the war progresses, so does the fire-and
brimstone narrative. On April 8. when US. tanks
entered Baghdad, the image was emblazoned
with Isaiah 26:2."0 pen the gates that the right
eous nation may enter, the nation that keeps
faith."
The full slideshow can be accessed at
http://men.style.com/gq/features/topsecret. I
highly recommend viewing it:it's mesmerizing in
a horrify ing way. like a bad traffic accident.
Aside from the blatant.cynical manipulation
these cover sheets display, they also represent an
utterly stunning and despair-inducing lack of
judgment on the part of Rumsfeld, who not only
mixed religion explicitly in with the statecraft of
the U.S.. but also gave the impression that the
man in charge of inserting our forces into the
powderkeg heart of the Muslim world was. in
fact, literally engaged on a Christian religious cru
sade.
Finally, please note that I'm not criticizing re
ligion here. Individuals are free to guide their
own morality using whatever basis they choose.
But to do what Rumsfeld did is rank and inex
cusable. It's t<Ki bad his appointment at the
Hoover Institution is up. because now I'd like to
call on them to fire him Instead.! urge them to do
the next best thing and symbolically rescind his
appointment Stanford and the Hoover Institu
tion should have no association whatsoever with
the oozing failure that is Donald Rumsfeld.
