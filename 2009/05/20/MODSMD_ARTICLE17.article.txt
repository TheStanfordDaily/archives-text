## Crucial time for Stanford sports 
### 
Like school, the Stanford sports
year is dying down. Seasons are
ending and summer is fast ap
proaching. For many Cardinal
athletes, the upcoming weeks
provide a rare break, a time to focus on fi
nals, get some rest and prepare for another
rigorous year.
This is the time of year that athletes get
to enjoy things they may not be able to
enjoy during the school year. For example,
Athlete Formal — the pseudo prom for
Stanford athletes — was Monday night.
My sports editor wants my columns to
be longer, as there are fewer sports to
cover for The Daily.
I lie strange thing about this period in
which most athletes' seasons are wrapping
up is that this particular week still might be
the most important of the year for Stan
ford Athletics.
Cardinal sports are at a crux this week.
Next week.il I choose to. I could be writing
one of two columns. *IT»e lead of the first
could be something like "Stanford sports
cap an up-and-down year with late-season
surges and postseason success."
It the results go a different direction,
however, the lead could look more like
this:"Season is over for Stanford.The Car
dinal crashes and burns under postseason
pressure."
What do I mean by all of this? A few
prominent Stanford sports are at a point in
the season in which they will either get
over a hump that has been haunting them,
or they will be going home for the summer.
lake the Stanford baseball team for ex
ample. After being ranked as high as No. 5
in some preseason polls, the Cardinal
stumbled out of the gate this season with a
3 9 start, all but burying its postseason
chances.
Now. with three games remaining, the
Cardinal faces a do-or-die match-up with
Oregon State at Sunken Diamond this
weekend, with the winner likely headed to
a regional and the loser's season ending.
Stanford may actually have to sweep
the Beavers to make the tournament, de
spite winning 26 of its last 39 games. Aaron
1 itt of Baseball America.com believes it
will be hard to keep Stanford out of the
tournament if it wins two of three this
weekend.
Failing to make a regional would be ex
ceptionally disappointing for a team that
went to the College World Series a vear

ago. Yes. the Cardinal has had some bad
luck — opponents have under-performed,
hurting its strength of schedule — but nev
ertheless this team has way too much tal
ent to be spending the end of May and
early June at home.
Friday night was supposed to be Fire
works Night at Sunken Diamond, but that
was moved to Saturday because there is
another Stanford team with an important
obligation Friday.
That is the Stanford softball team.The
Cardinal will be hosting the University of
Arizona in the Palo Alto Super Regional
this weekend. The winner earns a trip to
Oklahoma City and the Women's College
World Series.
How important is it for the Cardinal to
go to Oklahoma City? 'Hie team has never
won a WCWS championship and hasn't
even made an appearance in the WCWS
since 2(X)4. That means Missy Penna. not
only one of the greatest pitchers in Stan
ford softball history, but also one of the
greatest overall players in the team's histo
ry. has never made it to the dance.
It is her last chance, as well as Maddy
Coon's — a four-year starter and All-Pa
cific-10 Conference performer —to make
the pilgrimage to the Midwest.
This is also one of the best — if not the
best — Stanford softball team ever. It has
been ranked as high as No. 2 in the country
and has. at times, looked completely un
stoppable. It has potentially three All
Americans in Penna. junior outfielder
Alissa Haber and freshman shortstop
Ashley 1 lansen.
But if Stanford's Pac-10 rival bests it
this weekend, that will all be for naught,
and next week's column will not be a
happy one.
Baseball and softball are not the only
sports with big weeks.The men's golf team
will set its sights on its second NCAA
C hampionship in three years next week. In
tennis, the individual championships for
both men and women are this week.
If things go well in all of these sports,
then next week would be extremely cele
bratory for Stanford. I lowever.il things go
the other way it will be a sad week — and
we sportswriters won't have much to
cover.

Dan Hohm still needs to write 200 more
words to satis fy his editor. (live him ideas at
