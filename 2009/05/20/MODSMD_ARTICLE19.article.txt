ending his 34-game on base streak, and fellow
classmate Kellen Kiilsgaard went 0-for-3 to end
a 12-game hitting streak. As a team. Stanford
went into this game on fire, almost having
swept Southern California this past weekend
and winning six of its last seven games, as well
as nine of its past 12 contests.
"Tonight, we got beat every which way,"said
Stanford head coach Mark Marquess."Davis is
a good team, they hit well and pitched well. It
would have been easiet for lis to handle if the
game had been close."
The main Cardinal highlights came from
senior Joey August and sophomore Alex
Pracher. Stanford had only deposited one run
versus the Aggies' seven runs by the fifth. Au-

GAME NOTES: The Stanford baseball team will host Oregon
State this weekend in what will be a crucial series to end
the regular season. The Cardinal will need to bounce
back after a tough loss at home to UC-Davis last night,
dropping the game 11 -2. Both Stanford and the Beavers
are hoping to.get into the postseason, and given last
night's loss, the Card will likely need a three-game sweep
to extend its season.

gust decided to take it into his own hands and
rocket a solo shot to left field for his second
home run of the season. Pracher was the only
Stanford pitcher to last more than one inning
on the mound, giving up no runs on three hits
and two walks over 4.2 innings of work.
"1 came in when we were down by a lot of
runs.and I thought that if I could just hold them
for as long as I could, that we would come back

and score." Pracher said. "We have
good defense and good hitters and
normally it's the case that we would
have come back.
"After heating Davis last year. I
think there was some bad blood be
tween us." he continued. "Though it
would have been nice to win. Davis
definitely came to show us."
The Aggies' secret weapon that
shut the Cardinal hitters down was
winning freshman Anthony Kup
bens.The southpaw has only started
two other games this year and was 1-
1 with a 5.94 E:RA coming into this
big matchup against the Cardinal.
But Kupbens caught the Cardinal
off guard — he mixed his speeds
well and didn't throw the quick fast
balls necessary for Cardinal hitters
to launch anything past the warning
track, besides August's home run in
the fifth. Kupbens' final line was two
earned runs on five hits, along with
no walks over seven innings of work.
After Kupbens' outing came a
solid close from Davis sophomore
Tom Briner. Briner also didn't help
the Cardinal's case when he allowed
only three hits to go with no runs
and no walks over two innings
pitched.
Offensively, the Aggies scored six
runs in the second to start off the
game and four runs in the eighth to
seal the deal. The Aggies began the
second with a little small ball, having
batters reach on a double, single and
fielder's choice. Then, shortstop
Scott I laylman was hit by a pitch to

load the bases for the first time in
the game. It all went downhill from
there, when ninth hitter Scott
Kalush singled to plate two; then
just a batter later, first baseman Ty
Kelly hit a double to bring around
two more. A sacrifice fly from Justin

Schafer and a single from Ryan
Scoma brought in one each to make
six.
With two hitters on and one out
in the eighth, left-fielder Daniel
Cepin hit an RBI single that was fol
lowed up by a three-run homer by
Kelly to left center. Kelly was Davis'
power hitter, going 2-for-5 with five
RBI. Asa team, eight of nine starters
had at least one hit to their name
and all nine made the trip around
the bases at least once during the
night.
It was a tough game to lose for
Stanford as it was on the brink of re
ceiving a bid to the NCAA Region
al Tournament.
"This game is not easy to put
away, but we have to." Pracher said.
"On the bright side, we have a few
days to get back on track and focus
on getting a win on Friday. We are
just as good as any team in the coun
try, and hopefully playing this week
end's series at home will give us an
edge."
With only three games left in the
season, every contest counts. Stan
ford is going to have to sweep Ore
gon State (32-16 overall. 13-11 Pac
-10) this weekend to feel even the
slightest bit of security when it
comes to getting a bid to continue on
the road to Omaha.
"All of our games are important."
Marquess said. "This weekend's se
ries against Oregon State is going to
be big for us. Even if we had nothing
to plav for. we always try to play
well. We're just going to focus on the
upcoming game this I riday in order
to start the weekend off right."
