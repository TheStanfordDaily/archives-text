Championships in Eugene, Ore. The Cardinal
will be looking to build off of last weekend's per
formances at the conference championships
(also in Eugene), where the women took home
second place and the men took third.

Stanford track and field took in
gene. Ore. by storm this weekend at the
Pacific-10 Conference Championships.
A weekend filled with season bests, re
gional marks and personal records led
to a second-place finish for the women,
and a third-place finish for the men.
The impressive depth the women ex
hibited allowed them to gather points in
numerous events. Top-eight finishers

four in the long jump, with a second
place finish by sophomore Arantxa
King (20 feet. S inches), as well as
fourth-,fifth- and seventh-place finishes
by junior Griffin Matthew, sophomore

King and I iehr came back to place in
the triple jump, where I iehr finished
second with a career best mark of 42-K.
and King finished third with a mark of
42-0 1/2. Also gaining points in the event
was freshman Jordan Merback. who
placed fifth with a mark of 40-4 1/2.
" 11hink. overall, we came U>gether as
a team quite well," said fifth-year senior
and team captain Claire Cormier-
ITiielke. "We would have loved to come
away with the title, but it was a hard
fought battle with Oregon, and I think
we pulled oil some great performances
during the process. We had a lot of peo
ple set it up to clinch those fourth , fifth
and sixth-place finishes that are often
overlooked, but really make the differ
ence in championships."
Also faring well in the field events
for the women were seniors
Michaela Wallerstedt and Jaynie
Goodbody. Wallerstedt placed sec
ond in the shot put with a toss of 51-
6 1/4. and placed fourth in the discus
with a career-best 166-7. Goodbody
placed third in the hammer with a
mark of 192-3.

Stephanie Marcy in fourth
(35:20.01).
Freshman Emilie Amaro placed
second in the 3.000-meter steeple
chase with a time of 10:15.18.
"Emilie Amaro ran a really tough
race to get second place, which is just
extraordinary for a freshman," said
senior captain Lauren Centrowitz.
The only female with a Pac-10
title this past weekend was Cen
trowitz. who won the 5,000 meters in
16:15.86. She was followed by fresh

"As far as my performances, I was
pretty happy with the 4x400."
Cormier-Thielke said. "We won our
heat, posted our fastest time of the
season and ran a regional-qualifying
time, all while running it alone out at
the front of our heat. That's hard to
do."
