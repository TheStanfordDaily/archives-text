## Law students defend Three Strikes offenders 
### KATE BARBER STAFF WRITER 
While their classmates are busy reading
up on case law and listening to lectures,
some Stanford Law School students,
through the Criminal Defense Clinic, are
getting a chance to try high-stakes crimi
nal cases themselves, and have enjoyed
remarkable success of late.
The Stanford Criminal Defense Clinic,
which began in 2006. is one of the Law
School's 10 legal clinics. These clinics focus

on issues ranging from environmental law
to education, according to I ,aw School lec
turer Michael Romano.
'The Criminal Defense Clinic allows
seccond- and third-year law students to
adwocate in real cases by doing investiga
tioms. organizing briefs and even arguing
in ccourt. Hie clinic operates entirely on a
pro)-bono basis, and deals with criminals
comvicted under ("alifornia's controversial
Thrree Strikes I aw. a state law that dramat
icallly increases prison sentences of third
timie offenders regardless of the severit\ of

the third crime.
Students can apply each semester, and
12 to 20 are selected to work for the clinic.
"The idea was twofold." Romano said.
"First, to develop a first-rate, hands-on
learning experience for law students in the
context of criminal defense and appeals
and simultaneously to provide legal assis
tance for people who have been affected
by the Three Strikes Law."
Nick Xenakis J.D. '10. a student work
ing in the clinic, feels that one of the pur
poses of the clinic is to bring attention and

legal aid to three-strikes cases.
"A lot of our work is to make sure the
court knows our clients are not just more
statistics." Xenakis said.
So far. the program seems to be work
ing.
"Hundreds of parties have contacted
us. and we're currently representing 20."
Romano said.
Several weeks ago. recent graduates
Mark Melahn J.D. '09 and Jesse Goodman
J.D. "09 succeeded in freeing
Norman Williams from a possible
life sentence for stealing a car jack
and tools from a tow truck â€” a sen
tence he had been given due to
Three Strikes.
"We ended up with the dream
outcome," Melahn said. "While we
were doing the work, Jesse and I
never quite wanted to let ourselves
believe that it would work out like
this, because cases like this are
extremely difficult to win."
According to Romano, this is one
of four victories the clinic has
achieved so far.
One of the benefits of the clinic is
that it puts so much emphasis on stu
dent-client interaction.
"Students are responsible for
managing our relationships, going
into prison, interviewing families,
compiling records and arguing in
courts," Romano said. "So, the stu
dents really are responsible for man
aging the cases."
Despite the fact that those partic
ipating in the clinic are still in law
school, student participants feel they
haven't run into condescension from
other parties because of their age.
"I felt like we were treated like

genuine attorneys," Xenakis said.
"There was no coddling, this was the
real deal and we were treated like
real advocates. What I've heard from
other students who've gone to trial is
the same; they walked in with hesita
tion, but have been happy to be
treated with respect."
Three Strikes continues to be a
sensitive topic around the state, but
students in the clinic feel they have
been met largely with support for
their efforts.
"Because the clients for the clinic
have done such incredibly minor
third crimes. I don't think I've ever
encountered any hostility at all. "
said Elisabeth Oppenheimer J.D.TO,
a Criminal Defense Clinic student.
Currently, students can enroll in a
clinic for a semester, while simulta
neously taking classes. Some stu
dents stay on for a second semester
as an "advanced" student.
Next year, the clinic program will
be changing slightly as the law
school moves to align with the rest
of Stanford on the quarter system.
"Clinics will be a full-time com
mitment for a quarter next year,"
Romano said. "We have 10 clinics,
and each will be offered two of the
three quarters."
Even though balancing an
already tough load of law classes and
an actual case can be challenging,
students in the clinic feel the experi
ence is worth it.

"It's been incredible," Xenakis
said. "I think there's this sense from
the outside that these criminals
aren't really people. That's not really
the way life works or how people
are. Getting to know these people
has been an incredible experience."
Melahn said that visiting Williams
at the Folsom Prison added to the
experience.
"We established a rapport over
that time, and 1 found myself becom
ing more personally invested in the
outcome of the case than I would
have predicted at the outset,"
Melahn said.
Xenakis agreed that personal
interaction with clients is vital in
obtaining experience as a soon-to-be
lawyer.
"A lot of law school can be very
complex," he said. "As a lawyer, your
job is to be an advocate for a person,
and this clinic has taught that to me."
Students often view their work in
the clinic as some of their most
meaningful work in law school.
"I see the work we did for Mr.
Williams in the Clinic as my most
significant law school accomplish
ment and one of my most fulfilling
experiences, period," Melahn said. "I
will be much more likely now to
seek out Three Strikes pro-bono
cases as a practicing lawyer."
