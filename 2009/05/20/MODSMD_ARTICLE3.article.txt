## Law students defend Three Strikes offenders 
### KATE BARBER STAFF WRITER 
While their classmates are busy reading
up on case law and listening to lectures,
some Stanford Law School students,
through the Criminal Defense Clinic, are
getting a chance to try high-stakes crimi
nal cases themselves, and have enjoyed
remarkable success of late.
The Stanford Criminal Defense Clinic,
which began in 2006. is one of the Law
School's 10 legal clinics. These clinics focus

on issues ranging from environmental law
to education, according to I ,aw School lec
turer Michael Romano.
'The Criminal Defense Clinic allows
seccond- and third-year law students to
adwocate in real cases by doing investiga
tioms. organizing briefs and even arguing
in ccourt. Hie clinic operates entirely on a
pro)-bono basis, and deals with criminals
comvicted under ("alifornia's controversial
Thrree Strikes I aw. a state law that dramat
icallly increases prison sentences of third
timie offenders regardless of the severit\ of

the third crime.
Students can apply each semester, and
12 to 20 are selected to work for the clinic.
"The idea was twofold." Romano said.
"First, to develop a first-rate, hands-on
learning experience for law students in the
context of criminal defense and appeals
and simultaneously to provide legal assis
tance for people who have been affected
by the Three Strikes Law."
Nick Xenakis J.D. '10. a student work
ing in the clinic, feels that one of the pur
poses of the clinic is to bring attention and

legal aid to three-strikes cases.
"A lot of our work is to make sure the
court knows our clients are not just more
statistics." Xenakis said.
So far. the program seems to be work
ing.
"Hundreds of parties have contacted
us. and we're currently representing 20."
Romano said.
