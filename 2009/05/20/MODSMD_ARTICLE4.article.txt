### ELLEN DANFORD 
A group of 64 Stanford students contributed tin a national
fundraiser that raised $37.(HH) for clean water Ifor African
women Hie recently announced total is enough tto drill four
deep wells in Kuria. Kenya.
ilie fundraising effort, which consisted of a nationwide
walk across college campuses on April 21. was sponsored by
"He I lope to I ler." which looks to raise awareness of the lack
of accessible drinking water in Africa.
Be Hope to Her (BII20+) is supportedl by Nuru
International, a non-profit dedicated to pioneering sustain
able solutions to poverty that was founded bv Jake: I larriman,
MBA 'OS.
Because the April 21 event did not have OS/A approval
for fundraising it relied on the $2.(HK) contribuition of an
organization called "Dry Pears. ' as well as fundus from two
other event sponsors.
Hie wells that will be drilled using funds raised will hope
fully increase the level of access to sustainable, safe water;
decrease the prevalence of water-borne diseases; improve
water resource management on the local level amd promote
basic sanitation on the community level.
"In addition to providing clean drinking waiter for the
community,these wells will enable local girls to atltend school
rather than spending their days collecting water firom distant
sources." I larriman wrote in a press release.
Beyond raising money to drill new clean wellls in Alriea,
the group hopes to raise awareness on campuss about the
effect of inaccessible drinking water on womem's lives in
Africa. One way they attempted to do so was tlhrough the
sponsored walk across campus.
"That was phenomenal," said I milv Ciasner t) 1 ) ol the
walk. "Definite exposure to the reality of the women's bur
den in Africa!"
I .ong walks to retrieve water can be dangerous, for African
women, since they must carry on each of theiir heads 44
pounds of water, on average. Be Hope to llerr desires to
lessen the physical danger and give women mcnre time to
attend school.
"People in developed countries like the limited States
often take watei lor granted they can walk at few yards.
turn on it tap and have access to all
the water they could need." said
I )arcy White W. the Be I lope to I ler
campus coordinator. "It is important
toget people to realize that this is not
the case in places like Africa, where
the lack of readily available clean
water keeps girls from going to
school or getting jobs."
Many Stanford groups supported
the April 21 event, including FACFi
AIDS. Dance Marathon and
Initiative Against Malaria.
