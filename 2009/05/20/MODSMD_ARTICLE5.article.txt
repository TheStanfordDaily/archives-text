RAPPER'S DELIGHT: Parodying Jay-Z and JD's "Money Ain't a Thang," Tom McFadden '08 and
Derrick Davis '10 rap in the music video "Regulatin' Genes." McFadden, a Humßio course associate (CA), has
created multiple videos related to topics taught in the Humßio core, with the help of Davis and Jake Wachtel '09.
sport Atlanta Braves and NY
Yankees hats in their video; Colorado
Rockies and Toronto Blue Jays hats
top the heads of McFadden and
Davis. Jay-Z and JD toss money like
it's nothing; McFadden and Davis do
the same with A-plus papers.
But the core value that students
take away from the video is not the
entertainment, hut the content, which
is relevant to the specific subject the
class is learning. In non-hip-hop
terms. McFadden explained what the
video was about.
"(The] main theme is that
throughout evolution, different
organisms are using the same genes
and proteins to form very different
body types" McFadden said. "And
the way they do that is by selectively
regulating different genes."
The video makes regulating Hox
genes hip.
The Reaction
Though born out of a desire to
teach Humßio students. "Regulatin'
Genes" has received press from
numerous media outlets, including
The San Jose Mercury News. The
New York Times and England's The
Guardian.
"I've been getting contacted by a
lot of people," McFadden said.
"There's a science museum in the
Philippines that wants to use the
video. A lot of developmental neuro
biology professors are like. 'Can you
send me the hard copy so I can use it
in my class?" It's been nice helping
out other people involved in science
education."
Teaching has driven McFadden to
make "Regulatin' Genes" and other
videos, but how effective are they?
Humßio Professor Robert Siegel,
who was in the video "Plasma
Membrane," described them as use
ful teaching tools.
"The essence of teaching is to
motivate students, give them a handle
to remember relevant information,
make them want to learn." Siegel
explained in an email to The Daily.
"Tom's videos accomplish these
things and go even further because
they are available to such a wide
audience."
In fact, the video has been viewed
over 70,(XX) times on You Tube.
Students agree that McFadden's
videos are helpful. Will Lindemann
'11. a Humßio core student, pointed
out that the rap provides a different
context for the material, bringing
entertainment value to biology.
"I was really impressed by the
video when I first saw it,"he said. "A
lot of the material we cover can be
pretty dry, so to see it remixed like
that made it really amusing. There's

often a moment of realization when
Tom says something in his own way
that can be way clearer than in lec
ture."
Another core student. Lara Ortiz-
Luis '11, agreed.
"To be honest, not all of the mate
rial we learn is 1(H) percent exciting,"
she said. "The videos make even the
driest stuff accessible and entertain
ing."
Ortiz-Luis also pointed out that
she watched the video multiple times
just to see her CA in a new context,
as a rapper.
While the video uses hip-hop to
teach science, it hasn't quite succeed
ed in using science to teach hip-hop.
Professors Russell Fernald. Margaret
Fuller and Siegel admit that they
have not become hip-hop listeners
since Tom's videos.
"Maybe it is time for me to go on
Wikipedia and find out what hip-hop
actually is," Siegel joked.
The History
Though McFadden and Davis can
make music, they didn't learn about it
in formal settings. McFadden's for
mal training is limited to taking drum
lessons in sixth grade. Davis' training,
too, was short-lived.
"My formal music training ended
with the recorder in third grade,"
Davis admitted. But, he added, "I can
still bust out 'Hot Cross Buns.'"
They both learned their craft from
listening. McFadden's influences
include Wu-Tang Clan, Jurassic 5 and
Hie Roots. Davis' influences are
broad, but some favorites are JD and
Kanye West.
Collaboration between
McFadden and Davis began not on
campus, but in the mountains near
Lake Tahoe. Both were camp coun
selors at last summer's Stanford
Sierra Camp, a summer camp for the
families of Stanford alumni. Iheir
first raps were for the weekly staff
talent show, but they focused on top
ics less complex than gene regulation.

For instance, the first effort, set to
Lil Mama's "Lip Gloss," addressed
milkshakes.
Back on campus. McFadden and
Wachtel. another Sierra Camp alum
nus. made a few biology videos.
Meanwhile, Davis, a Larkin residen
tial assistant (RA). wrote songs for
his dorm. ITie three were brought
back together when McFadden called
Davis one day and asked him to be a
part of "Regulatin" Genes."
The two have since collaborated
in the newest video. "Synaptic Cleft,"
which also stars some Larkin resi
dents and Sierra Camp alumni
explaining what happens where two
nerve cells connect.
But that final product comes after
quite a bit of work.
McFadden said he's often inspired
to write the songs while he's doing his
CA gig.
"I'll be doing my job, basically
reading the textbook, and as I'm
doing that. I'll think of a little lyric
and write it down." he reflected.
Once he collects enough of these
for a coherent song, the recording
takes about an hour and the video
taping takes a couple of hours. Then.
Wachtel puts in a hefty chunk of time
editing.
"The editor has to listen to it like
a thousand times," McFadden said.
So what's the next step?
McFadden doesn't have any specific
ideas about the next big video and
said he's pretty open to anything.
Humßio student Lindemann sug
gested that a rap on what all the hor
mones in the body do would help.
Siegel proffered the timely topic of
the llu virus.
McFadden. as a CA. and Davis, as
a senior, are both returning to cam
pus next year, so there will be plenty
of opportunities for more collabora
tion. Keep your ears open for the
next Humßio rap track they drop.
