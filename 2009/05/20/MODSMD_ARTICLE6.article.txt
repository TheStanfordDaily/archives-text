# Ph.D. programs shifting with economy, budget
## Some shrink, others grow as funding sources change 
### ERIC MESSINGER DESK EDITOR 
The number of doctoral students
admitted by departments is changing due
to the recession and University-wide
budget cuts, though the exact nature of
the changes is still uncertain, according to
administrators.
At present, the complete picture of the
effects of the budget cuts upon graduate
programs at Stanford is unclear, because
Stanford does not have a centralized
administrative structure overseeing gradu
ate students. Associate Vice Provost for
Graduate Education Chris Golde empha
sized that no one office sets graduate fund
ing for Ph.D. students or coordinates

admissions decisions.
"At many institutions, there's an organ
ization entity called something like 'the
graduate school.* which allocates funding
and exerts a fairly tight control." Golde
said. "We're not like that."
As a result, the effect of the budget cuts
upon the number of Ph.D. students accept
ed by Stanford varies significantly from
department to department. Golde estimat
ed that Stanford has roughly 65 separate
programs or departments that offer doc
torates, each with their own set of decisions
to make.
Similarly, funding for doctoral students
can depend on a variety of sources, includ
ing endowment funds, fellowships and
external research grants from the govern

ment or foundations. And on top of admis
sion being a multi-year commitment —
with doctoral students potentially remain
ing past their predicted departure — the
picture becomes even murkier.
"All of the pieces that come together
for a given student — you have to think of
it as a quilt." Golde said. "Each student's
quilt is a little bit different."
While initial indications are emerging,
Golde stressed that the full picture in
terms of the total number of Ph.D. stu
dents would not be available until some
weeks into the upcoming academic year.
"I'm very hesitant to be in the predic
tion game," Golde said.
