# Ph.D. programs shifting with economy, budget
## Some shrink, others grow as funding sources change 
### ERIC MESSINGER DESK EDITOR 
The number of doctoral students
admitted by departments is changing due
to the recession and University-wide
budget cuts, though the exact nature of
the changes is still uncertain, according to
administrators.
At present, the complete picture of the
effects of the budget cuts upon graduate
programs at Stanford is unclear, because
Stanford does not have a centralized
administrative structure overseeing gradu
ate students. Associate Vice Provost for
Graduate Education Chris Golde empha
sized that no one office sets graduate fund
ing for Ph.D. students or coordinates

admissions decisions.
"At many institutions, there's an organ
ization entity called something like 'the
graduate school.* which allocates funding
and exerts a fairly tight control." Golde
said. "We're not like that."
As a result, the effect of the budget cuts
upon the number of Ph.D. students accept
ed by Stanford varies significantly from
department to department. Golde estimat
ed that Stanford has roughly 65 separate
programs or departments that offer doc
torates, each with their own set of decisions
to make.
Similarly, funding for doctoral students
can depend on a variety of sources, includ
ing endowment funds, fellowships and
external research grants from the govern

ment or foundations. And on top of admis
sion being a multi-year commitment —
with doctoral students potentially remain
ing past their predicted departure — the
picture becomes even murkier.
"All of the pieces that come together
for a given student — you have to think of
it as a quilt." Golde said. "Each student's
quilt is a little bit different."
While initial indications are emerging,
Golde stressed that the full picture in
terms of the total number of Ph.D. stu
dents would not be available until some
weeks into the upcoming academic year.
"I'm very hesitant to be in the predic
tion game," Golde said.
Individual Departments
Some graduate departments have
been forced to make cuts, hut others,
buoyed by increased external funding
stemming from increased research
spending, are actually adding to their
support of doctoral cohorts.
In at least two departments, signif
icant reductions in the number of
admitted doctoral students have
already been made. The history
department has already had to
reduce the size of its admitted cohort
for 2009-2010, according to History
Chair Paula Findlen.
In an email to The Daily, F indlen
noted that the decision came about in
response to a combination of rising
costs and reduced resources.
"Increasing costs, including the
new healthcare fees, and declining
endowments mean that each student
package costs more and we have less
to spend overall," Findlen said. "In
recent years, the University has asked
departments to contribute more dis
cretionary funds in support of gradu
ate student admissions packages,
which means that we have less of this
funding for students as they finish."
Findlen also emphasized that sup
porting graduate students entering a
difficult job market was an important
consideration.
"We need to support graduate stu
dents making good progress not only
in the beginning and middle stages of
their degree, but in the critical final
stage," Findlen said.
Communications has also reduced
its number of admitted students, from
a class last year of eight to a current
cohort of three.
"We would hope for a somewhat
larger class, just so we have a critical
mass and cohort." said
Communications Chair James Fishkin.
Fishkin said that the choice was
motivated by caution, particularly at
the uncertain levels of funding from
sponsored projects that provide cru
cial resources.
"We thought this was a prudent
choice," he said.
Many other departments are com
mitted to retaining their current num
bers of doctoral students. At the
School of Humanities and Sciences
(H&S), numbers are currently
remaining relatively steady, accord
ing to H&S Dean Richard Sailer.
"Our entering number of Ph.D.
students next year is going to be just
about the same as this year and over
the past few years," Sailer wrote in an
email to The Daily "It happens that
the natural sciences are down some,
and humanities and social sciences
are up. not by design, but again |by)
the random variation from year to
year."
Fnglish Chair Jennifer Summit

"Future budget cuts
might make
reductions in
our Ph.D. cohorts
unavoidable."

— TOM WASWO,
Linguistics Chair

said that she expects no reductions.
"We made the decision this year
not to reduce the number of stu
dents," Summit said. "It just felt too
essential, both to our mission and to
our profession ... We feel we have a
responsibility to train the next gener
ation of scholars."
The same financial crisis forcing
the budget cuts, however, is also pro
viding a benefit to certain depart
ments. Government research grants,
provided in association with stimulus
legislation passed earlier this year,
are helping to offset losses and even
expand the financial resources avail
able. according to School of
Engineering Dean Jim Hummer.
"In the short term with the stimu
lus, I think support for Ph.D. students
will be more, not less," Plummer said.
Dean of the School of Earth
Sciences Pamela Matson echoed his
assessment.
"We're assuming with the stimu
lus money and federal research
money that we can support a few
more students." Matson said.
Plummer said that this was indica
tive of the school's predominant
reliance upon external funding, such
as organizations like the National
Science Foundation and the National
Institute for Health.
"It's less of an issue in engineering
than it is in other departments
because so many of our students are
supported externally," Plummer said.
Plummer noted, however, that if
funding from Stanford Graduate
Fellowships (SGFs) were to decline,
then admitted cohorts might see
reductions in size.
Many departments that do not
draw primarily upon external fund
ing. however, are also weathering the
cuts. Other departments reporting
low numbers of admitted students
will be consistent with prior years,
including modern thought and litera
ture, religious studies and classics.
In an email to The Daily. Classics
Chair Walter Schcidel emphasized
the importance of flexibility in
departmental budget allocations for
weathering the economic downturn.
"Departments are currently
allowed to roll over grad aid savings
(i.e. anything that's left over from the

annual grad aid allocation, that is sur
pluses created by attrition, outside
fellowships, other internal resources)
into future years, which makes it eas
ier to smooth out fluctuations in
yield." Scheidel said. "If we will still
be allowed to do that in future years
and funding is held constant at cur
rent levels, we don't anticipate signif
icant cuts in terms of the number of
admits."
Religious Studies Chair Hester
Gelber also noted the importance of
accrued funds that had been left
unused in prior years.
"Our particular department was
in a really good situation because we
had not had to spend all of the funds
we had received." Gelber said. "We
think going forward we're going to be
alright."
Departments with traditionally
low levels of graduate students noted
the importance in upcoming years of
maintaining their current levels.
Linguistics Chair Tom Wasow, in an
email to Hie Daily, said that his
department's current level of five to
seven new students per year was at
about the minimum necessary level.
"If cohort sizes drop from that low
level, there is a real danger of not
having a critical mass of students at
approximately the same stage of their
graduate education," Wasow said.
"We do not anticipate having to go
below that level, but we recognize
that, with the economy in the state it
is in, future budget cuts might make
reductions in our Ph.D. cohorts
unavoidable."
Administrators also put an
emphasis on ensuring the financial
security of any admitted students
over the long term.
"We are committed to supporting
our graduate students," Matson said,
"and we won't admit our students if
we can't provide them funding."
