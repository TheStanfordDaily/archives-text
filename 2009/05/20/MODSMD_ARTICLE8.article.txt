In order to accommodate the number of goals he
has set for the year, as well as the increase in
Executive Cabinet staff. ASSU President David
Gobaud '08 M.S.'lO told the Undergraduate Senate
last night that hew ill be giving up $2,000 of his salarv
to provide his staff with stipends that are consistent
with past years. 'ITie Senate also discussed plans for
its upcoming town hall meeting.
"In order to maintain a similar salary level for all

more than willing to do," Gobaud said, emphasizing
the importance of addressing issues of disabilities

Gobaud is also looking forward to increasing
graduate student outreach and addressing more

"I'm very excited about what this will allow us to
do." he said.
