## Exec cuts salary for Cabinet Goband sacrifices $2,000 to Exec Cabinet; Senate discusses town halls 
### ZOE RICHARDS STAFF WRITER 
In order to accommodate the number of goals he
has set for the year, as well as the increase in
Executive Cabinet staff. ASSU President David
Gobaud '08 M.S.'lO told the Undergraduate Senate
last night that hew ill be giving up $2,000 of his salarv
to provide his staff with stipends that are consistent
with past years. 'ITie Senate also discussed plans for
its upcoming town hall meeting.
"In order to maintain a similar salary level for all
of them, we decided to pull from David's salary," de
la Torre told the Senate at Tuesday's meeting.
The Executive Cabinet includes five more mem
bers than it did this past year. The creation of addi
tional positions came with the added cost of com
pensation for these new stall members, and to
Ciobaud. a strong cabinet of 22 is more important
than a hefty Executive salary.
"Our cabinet is larger this year because we have
created grad-specific positions and we have co
chairs of disability issues and sexual education." de
la Torre said.
According to Gobaud. all the chair positions
received a salary of $1,000 in this past year's
Executive Cabinet, and in order to offer the 22 new
cabinet members a comparable salary. $2,000 had to
be pulled from Gobaud's Executive salary.
When asked why equal amounts were not pulled
from both Gobaud and de la Torre's salaries.
Gobaud told The Daily that his willingness to offer a
portion of his own earnings stemmed from his love
for the job and the fact that he can afford to give up
a portion of his wages.
"I'm lucky enough to have started a company,
and 1 have the resources to give $2,000 which I'm
more than willing to do," Gobaud said, emphasizing
the importance of addressing issues of disabilities
and accessible education, which have not been
emphasized enough in the past.
Gobaud is also looking forward to increasing
graduate student outreach and addressing more
undergrad issues.
"I'm very excited about what this will allow us to
do." he said.
Senator Michael Cru/ '12 applauded what he saw
as a selfless act on the part of (iobaud.
"I think it's very admirable that you would put
your Cabinet in front of yourselves." Cruz said.
Later in the meeting. Senate Chair Varun
Sivaram '11 unhappily recalled that Vice Provost for
Undergraduate Education John
Bravman alluded to a significant
decrease in advising programs dur
ing the Faculty Senate meeting last
week.
"Advising is getting killed,"
Sivaram said. "Basically, all we have
left are academic directors â€” I was
very unhappy with that."
In line with the urgency of these
changes. Sivaram encouraged sena
tors to get involved with an advocacy
effort to voice concern with adminis
trators on this issue.
The Senate will continue with
ASSU Town Halls, which com
menced during winter quarter to
gather student opinions on the budg
et crisis. The Senate and Executives
are preparing for the first of what
thev intend to be a series of

revamped town halls in order to fur
ther inform students of the state of
the budget cuts, according to de la
Torre.
The first town hall, scheduled for
Wednesday. May 27. will include dis
cussion with Bravman. Vice Provost
of Academic Affairs Rebecca
Warner, Vice Provost of Student
Affairs Greg Boardman on issues of
student affairs and undergraduate
education.
De la Torre emphasized the town
halls as a unique opportunity to gar
ner the voices of students and speak
directly and constructively to the
administrators who are making
budget decisions.
"This is probably the easiest way
for [students] to interact with admin
istrators face-to-face in a public
forum." de la Torre said.
Additional bills confirmed Anton
Zietsman '12 as liaison to the Legal
Counseling Office Policy Board. Lee
Jackson as ASSU Speakers Bureau
liaison and Alex Katz '12 as parlia

mentarian and treasurer. Sivaram
will be Senate liasion to Faculty
Senate.
Among committee business, the
Communications Committee
announced a decision to make an
ASSU Senate Facebook profile in an
effort to keep students updated on
Senate affairs, and that it will contin
ue to release one-minute video sum
maries of Senate meetings. The
Student Life, Housing & Education
committee (SLHE) announced the
formation of a sustainability sub
committee with Dean Young '11 as
its chair.
Also, starting this weekend, the
Nitery will also be opened up for stu
dent use as part of a pilot program.
According to Gobaud. the initiative
is intended "to increase the amount
of student space for meeting and
studying," and will be evaluated after
the trial run.
