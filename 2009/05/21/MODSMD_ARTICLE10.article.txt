## EDITORIAL Wellness Room requires drastic overhaul 
### 
If you had all the resources at your dispos
al to design a room of ultimate comfort,
peace and departure from a hectic pace
of life, what would it look like? The editorial
board has a suspicion — based on poor at
tendance at the Wellness Room —that, for
most students,a brightly exposed glass room
in the back of Old Union filled with Crayola
colors and floral decor is not the ultimate re
treat they have in mind.
The Wellness Room, a joint initiative of
the Student Affairs Office and the ASSU.
opened on Feb. 26 with the hope that the
pilot program would provide a student-run
alternative to Vaden and CAPS that"proac
tively" addresses students' mental, physical
and spiritual health concerns. Studies came
out earlier in the year revealing that student
mental wellness concerns run rampant on
high-achieving campuses like Stanford, and
the Wellness Room was meant to provide
students some relief from the pressure of the
Farm.
Unfortunately, the Wellness Room ap
pears not to be as proactive in practice as it is
in theory. A recent Daily article reported
that, in fact, the room is not only suffering
from low attendance, but is also not always
open when students do come to use it be
cause Wellness Room coordinators fre
quently miss their shifts. Other concerns
raised in the article include the space's
decor, which students called "feminine" and
noted looked like "a day care center." and
the lack of motivation students had for
spending their precious free time there.
The editorial board feels that, in spite of
the criticism, the Wellness Room initiative is

a good one. hut some careful reconsidera
tion of the existing structure needs to he im
plemented so that the room does not he
come one bright and colorful budget drain.
More than anything, a newly revamped
Wellness Room needs to reflect the student
hody it is meant to serve as hroadlv as possi
ble. We are all adults — legally at least —
and our mental wellness concerns need to be
treated as such, not as the mental wellness
concerns of five-year-olds. Not that a good
finger-painting session is inherently bad. but
many of us seeking help or solace at Stan
lord desire more privacy.more mature relax
ing activities and the sense that our pursuit
of wellness need not be on display, as it is
now in the glassed-in. monitored room at the
back of Old Union.
Furthermore, as a student body, we tend
to need incentives to do things — let's face
it. we're goal-oriented — and persuading us
to relax is especially difficult. The Wellness
Room might consider ways to make atten
dance more appealing, whether it's through
offering units for art and meditation classes,
coupons for Fraiche and other healthy items
when we attend a certain number of times or
maybe even social mixers that take place at
the room between different student groups
on campus with an emphasis on mental and
spiritual health.
The Wellness Room as it stands grossly
misinterprets Stanford students' needs, de
spite its admirable intentions. The editorial
board would like to see a student board care
fully review the suggestions made for revi
sion of the program, or consider replacing it
all together.
