## Nicole Demby The 						paradox of boredom 
### 
I sit in my room adjacent to the back court
yard of my house. I am downing a bottle
of wine, while dreading writing the
measly reading response I have to write for
my art history class, listening at once to the
song"So Bored" by WAVVES and the group
of people laughing as they pass around a
gravity bong outside my door.
Some light deconstruction of this sce
nario will reveal a particular and not-so-la
tent theme prevalent in this convergence of
events. So what's the commonality between
my disdain for the assignment for a class on
contemporary art (a topic I allegedly love
that will most definitely pertain to my future
career in some way), the pop-garage distor
tion of WAVVES (a 22-year old who lives in
a shack behind his parents' house in San
Diego and has a penchant for singing about
his boredom and his weed habit) and the
group of people outside my door, shameless
ly getting blasted on a Monday night? Apa
thy, ennui, boredom —call it what you will,
but it's something we were all synchronous
ly experiencing at that particular moment.
The inscription for Emory Professor Eliz
abeth Goodstein's book about boredom.
"Experience without Qualities: Boredom
and Modernity," is a quote from Roland
Barthes that translates to "Ennui... in ec
stasy glimpsed from the shores of desire."
This formulation is funny upon first en
counter because one usually thinks of ennui
as the antithesis of ecstasy and desire. Yet as
Goodstein explains, psychoanalysis has long
treated boredom as a means by which we
protect ourselves from desire, insulating our
selves from failure to attain happiness by re
signing ourselves to disenchantment, to not
caring.
Goldstein argues that boredom as a soci
etal epidemic is a profoundly modern histor
ical phenomenon, inextricably linked to the
shifts in the individual's conception of her
self as dictated by changes beginning with
the industrial revolution. Boredom becomes
a way to find some stasis in a rapidly fluctu
ating world, a world in which "the drives to
novelty and innovation, speed and progress
that have always defined modernity have be
come the foundation of a process of continu
ously accelerating transformation."
Boredom takes us out of this flux by re
jecting the notion that it's indicative of some
path to progress. I would also argue that
boredom as understood by psychoanalysis is
exacerbated by technology, the ease of com
munication and the pretense of upward mo
bility (at least in first-world countries) that
arguably characterize contemporary society.
All these things seem to impossibly raise the
stakes. It is in this setting of endless possibil-

If we resign
ourselves to feeling
like there's nothing
worth doing [...]
then we protect
ourselves from our
own ambitions.

ity that a person would feel most scared of.or
responsible for. his failure soaring to incred
ible heights.
I think this notion of using boredom as a
way to protect ourselves from failure to at
tain happiness takes on a profound signifi
cance at a place like Stanford. Society beck
ons us. the celebrated young people whose
smarts and talents are recognizable by the
name emblazoned across our paraphernalia
and on our diplomas, to stabilize our identi
ties not through boredom, but bv doing
something great. Worse, perhaps, than this
external pressure is the pressure many of us
put on ourselves to do something meaning
ful and important. The incredible stress of
these expectations makes disenchantment
an appealing option. If we resign ourselves
to feeling like there's nothing worth doing,
that class is meaningless, that what we're al
legedly interested in isn't really worth our
time, then we protect ourselves from our
own ambitions.
While we probably didn't recognize it at
the time.our boredom that night imbued our
trifecta with a meaning counter to the one
we are supposed to find when we win the
Nobel Prize or become a state senator. It in
stilled us with the significance of participat
ing in a lineage of nihilistic apathy one can
trace from Flaubert, to Jack Kerouac, to
James Dean, to Kurt Cobain. By taking re
course to the "I-don't-give-a-shit" attitude
embodied by so many reckless youth prior,
perhaps we insulate ourselves from our own
expectations.

Nicole doesn't give enough of a fuck to come
up with something clever to say for this part.
