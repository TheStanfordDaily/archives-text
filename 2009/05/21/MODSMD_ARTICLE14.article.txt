So about a week ago. I get this text mes
sage from my buddy. Scott: "Fellas —
tonight I'm going to ask Julie to marry
me!" And then, exactly two hours later:"She
said yes!"
Naturally, I reacted the same way anyone
does when a best friend gives the happy
news: by berating him and telling him he was
making the worst mistake of his life. (Thank
Ciod he knew I was joking, because I wasn't
entirely sure myself. Love you Julie!)
Well, not right away. First, I called him up
that evening and just held the phone as the
two of us wordlessly giggled for five consecu
tive minutes, both of us processing just how
ridiculous the thought of him getting married
is. It's not simply the fact that we're the same
age. and that I am nowhere close to being
psychologically prepared to have a new
woman in my life tell me when it's time to
clean my room.
It's the fact that, wait a minute — this is
Scott. I"he same guy who, as my freshman
year hallmate three years ago (Roble lb
baby!), suggested to me that devising a plan
to sell shirts that on the front said "Cal
Sucks." and on the back had quasi-factual in
formation regarding Cal students' eating
habits, testicular size and demon worship was
a worthwhile use of our time (he was right).
The same guy who. as my roommate two
years ago. would get into his bed as I got into
mine, knowing full well we would barely be
able to sleep, much less breathe, as we just
traded wisecracks for hours on end.The same
guy who last year thought we should have a
"debate" on our radio show called "Global
Warming: Myth or Fiction?" (boy. did that
elicit a response from both of the people lis
tening). And the same guy, who a few months
ago. during the election craze, wanted us to
get into the food business together. Hie idea?
Half burrito. Half taco. Call it a Burraco
Bomber.
I mean, this profile practically screams el
igible bachelor, right?
Yep.That's the same Scott who is now get
ting married.The crazy thing is. he's not even
my first friend at Stanford to get engaged. As

I write this, two doors down, my suitemate is
sitting in front of his computer working on
his senior thesis. In a couple of months, he'll
he walking down the aisle, too.
Scott's newsbreak really served as more
of a mirror than anything else. When I look at
the way he developed as a person in the last
four years — and Burraco Bombers aside, he
really has — I realize that pretty soon, I am
looking at myself. I entered Stanford in Sep
tember 2005 under vastly different circum
stances than most. Ilie summer before. I had
spent eight weeks in Israel, a time away that
had transformed me and given me new life. I
had not come to Stanford, as so many others
had. to discover who I truly was.That summer
made me believe that I already knew. And for
that reason, this beginning of a new chapter
did not seem to make sense to me. At the age
of 18.1 genuinely thought I had already fin
ished the book.
But as Stanford would instill in me. I had
not. Summer had been merely the end of the
chapter, and Stanford, the beginning of a new
one.The thing about those moments that de
fine you,change you and remain with you for
life, is that they don't happen in a vacuum.
The next day. you still wake up and face a
world that has not been transformed, even if
your perception of il has.
Now, the school year is coming to an end,
and I am likely about to embark on another
escapade back to Israel to get my master's
degree in diplomacy (now there's a region
that could probably use some). But for now.
it feels again as if the book is coming to a
close, as if the transformation is complete, as
if things are coming full circle as the Stanford
cycle ends for the Class of 2009.There is the
temptation to wax poetic about how we grad
uating seniors finally now know who we are.
who we are destined tobe.et cetera.et cetera.
As for me, I think I know better than to
make that claim. The day after graduation,
the day after I am no longer a Stanford stu
dent. I'll still wake up and have things to ac
complish, life to take on,tasks to tackle and a
lot of growing up to do I've got a summer trip
that will bring Americans. Israelis and (ier-

end of the book.

which I still have to finalize. (Got ideas for
funding? Let me know, pronto,Tonto!)
TTie day you decide you've got it all fig
ured out is the day you admit to yourself that
you can't get any better.The end of Stanford
isn't the end of the hook. It's the end of a
chapter somewhere around a quarter of the
way in..lust like my friend Scott, I still have a
lot left to be written in mine.
I mean, I haven't even gotten to the chap
ter about a sweltering August evening in
Paris, Kentucky in the summer of 2(X)9,
where a drunken groomsman says on the
wedding day. "Julie, you wouldn't believe
some of the things Scott said to me while we
were roommates. But hey, we've got nothing
but time, so why don't I tell a few quick sto
