## THREAT AT THIRD 
### BY CHRIS FITZGERALD DAILY SPORTS INTERN 
W, Stanford softball's first two bat
ters in the lineup both hitting over
.400 this year, it can be easy to dis
miss the importance of the player
occupying the third spot in ihe
order: junior Shannon Koplitz. But. on closer inspec
tion. Koplitz's numbers speak for themselves.
A .306 hitter, the New Orleans-native has blasted
eight home runs this season. The junior's powerful
presence in the heart of the Cardinal lineup has trans
lated t044 RBl,second on the team behind only fresh
man Ashley Hansen's 53.
But how did a kid from Louisiana make her way to
Stanford? For Koplitz. the seed was planted by watch
ing the Cardinal athletes who came before her.
"When 1 was a freshman [in high school], 1 went to
see Stanford volleyball play USC in New Orleans,"
Koplitz said. "After the game. I knew Stanford was a
candidate for me. [ It's] the best of [both] worlds:sports
and education."
In addition to her powerful bat. Koplitz has provid
ed the Cardinal with an unparalleled glove at third
base. She has made only five errors in SI attempts
from the hot corner, not bad for a player who had to
adjust from being an everyday second baseman last
season.
In moving to the left side of the diamond. Koplitz
was fast to recognize the possibilities of her new op
portunity.
"I really like moving around from position to posi
tion," Koplitz explained. "When you move back to
your old position, you have a whole new perspective
[on] how to plav it."
Koplitz fills a pivotal role for the Cardinal defen
sively. and has displayed a penchant for making the

miraculous plays as well as the routine.
"Former third baseman Michelle Smith | OSj has
been a big help." Koplitz said. "Everything [off the
bat) gets there faster [at third base]."
But Koplitz has not only negated potential game
winning knocks at third:at the plate.she has produced
a few herself. In clutch moments. Koplitz's value to the
team has extended far beyond the numbers.The righty
hit a walk-off homer in the ninth to beat Oregon, after
Stanford had loaded the bases with no outs in the
eighth and failed to score. The Cardinal junior also
bested Huskies Ail-American Danielle Lawrie for the
game-winning home run in the fourth inning to beat
then-No. 2 Washington on March 29.
"I've tried to make myself relaxed in the box." she
said."You always want to anticipate what you will see.
but ultimately you need to relax, and hit what the
pitcher throws."
After earning a starting job early in her freshman
season, Koplitz started every game last year, and has
played in all 56 this season. As regular as a
metronome, the junior is slowly ascending in the
record books with every at-bat. Koplitz's .450 slugging
percentage puts her at seventh on the all-time list at
Stanford and she is one RBI short of breaching the top
10 all time for a single season on the Farm.
With another full year left to play for Stanford, Ko
plitz received several honors this year including an
All-Pacific-10 Second Team selection. All-West-Re
gion honors for the first time in her career and an
ESPN Academic All-District VIII First Team pick.
Continuing the theme of achievement on and off
the field, Koplitz stands a chance of becoming the
