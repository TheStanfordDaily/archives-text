# MILLEVILLE'S MAGIC
## 
### BY JACK SALISBURY SENIOR STAFF WRITER 
This weekend, Stanford will play host
to Oregon State at Sunken Dia
mond in a series that can only ade
quately be described as do-or-die.
Win the series,and the Cardinal will
have a good chance of qualifying for the play
offs. Lose, and the team is out.
There's no room for sugarcoating things at
this time of the year, and senior Brent
Milleville probably knows this better than
anyone.
"I would definitely be upset if we don't
make the postseason." Milleville said.
The Stanford slugger can't be too upset
about the effort he's put forth and the results
he's racked up down the stretch of his senior
season, though. The first baseman currently
holds the lead in all three triple-crown stats on
the Stanford squad: batting average (.324).
RBI (52) and home runs (14).
Listed at 6-foot-4 and 240 pounds,
Milleville is faster than you might think, too:
he's second on the team in steals.sliding in suc
cessfully on seven of eight attempts on the
year.The senior has hit three grand slams this
season alone, and his hot streak down the
stretch has been a big factor behind the Cardi
nal's late-season push, reminiscent of last
year's run to the College World Series.
"I'm seeing the ball extremely well."
Milleville said."Right now I'm really comfort
able, really confident that I can beat any pitch
er I'm up against. That's something you have
to have to do to be a successful hitter."
"He's done a great job for us." said Stan
ford head coach Mark Marquess."! le's done a
phenomenal job —we wouldn't have been
able to make this run at the second half of the
season without him."
Phenomenal is an apt description.

the .400 mark during that stretch.The change
in hitting can he explained by a number of fac
tors — for one. the Cardinal faced one of the
toughest non-conference schedules in the na
tion during the first month of the season.going
up against the likes of Texas and Cal State-
Fullerton. For Millleville. though, success has
just been a matter of relaxing and finding his
groove.
"I was struggling,our team was struggling."
he said."l kind of put some pressure on myself
to do well to get our team going. After a while.
I just relaxed and things kind of fell into
place."
As one of the few seniors on a team laden
with younger talent, Milleville doesn't see
himself as a particularly vocal leader. That
said, though, his steadying presence has still
definitely been felt.
"He leads by example." Marquess said.
"He has a lot of respect from the other play
ers. because he practices and plays hard and
he provides that much-needed leadership

that you have to have if you're going to have
success. I le and the other seniors have done a
great job. We needed to have that and he's
provided that for us."
"I play the game hard and I try to set an
example for everyone," Milleville said. "I
don't think that's any different from anything
in the past. I haven't taken much of a differ
ent approach, other than I'm trying to help
out the younger guys through their struggles
because I've been through that."
With the streak he's been on down the
stretch, Milleville has definitely made his
case for pro scouts, lie's looking forward to
pursuing a professional career, but. consider
ing that the Cardinal will be fighting for its
life this coming weekend (against a team that
will also be trying to stave off elimination, no

less), it's understandable that the draft isn't
the first thing on his mind right now. And
though he has high expectations for the
team's finish to the season, Milleville knows
that — as was the case with his hitting this
season — it's sometimes better to take things
as they come.
"We're all going to be trying our best and
playing hard, but we can't take it too serious
ly because that's when you struggle and put
too much pressure on yourself," he said.
It's a mantra that has worked for Milleville
all season,especially down the stretch. If Stan
ford is lucky enough, it will work when the
team needs it most: this weekend against the
Beavers.
