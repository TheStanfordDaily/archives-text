# Punished by pingpong balls

### 
The NBA Draft lottery can
only be described as hilari
ous. Each year, the new
laughing stocks of the league
battle it out with the Clippers for the
title of the worst record — all for
more ping-pong balls in the NBA's
version of bingo, the popular nurs
ing-home pastime.
The lottery process makes sense
in theory: Each team that fails to
make the playoffs is entered into the
lottery. Ping-pong balls are awarded
based on record. The worst team by
record receives the largest chance
(most balls) tosecure the first pick in
the subsequent draft, the second
worst squad receives the second
best chance, and so on. Unlike the
NI L or MLB, which automatically
award their worst teams with the
first pick,the NBA instituted the lot
tery in order to prevent teams from
intentionally tanking at the end of
the season.
Each year, select representatives
from the 14 bottom feeders of bas
ketball congregate together, praying
that one of David Stern's cronies
picks an envelope often containing a
grizzly bear, a bobcat or a wizard.
The envelopes correspond to the
lottery results, which are determined
in a private setting using the tradi
tional ping-pong ball method.
This is how the NBA decides
draft order — by random chance -
and this is why there is a Cirand
Canyon-sized gap between good
and bad teams.
This year, the Sacramento Kings
entered Tuesday's lottery with a 25
percent chance (tops of any team) to
receive the No. I pick, which will
most likely be Oklahoma forward
Blake Griffin — the unanimous top
player in this year's draft who has
the leaping ability of a kangaroo on
speed. The Kings, to put it mildly,
were appalling in 2009,The pride of
California's capital finished 17-65.
two games back of the powerhouse
Clippers and Wizards. Sacramento
has some young talent, with scoring
machine Kevin Martin and develop
ing big man Spencer Hawes. Yet.
these two are surrounded by what
appear to be members of the Palo
AltoAAlJ under-15 team.
Kings nation was stoked for the
lottery. The chance to draft a player
like Griffin happens once in a
decade at most — unless you are the
Clippers — and he is the type of guy
that could help catalyze the revival
of Sacramento and return the fran
chise to its glory days of the early
2000s. He will make an immediate
impact in the league as his decision
to return to school last year has
clearly prepared him for the next
level.
But when the lottery came rolling
around, the Kings fell victim to the
system, failing to crack the top three
picks. Oklahoma City took third, fol
lowed by Memphis with the second
pick. And guess who came away with
No. I pick?
ITie cream ol the professional
crop, the Los Angeles Clippers, who
will undoubtedly find some way to
screw the draft up. Even if they do
select (iriffin.hc will have to battle it
out with. gulp, /.ach Randolph, the
Clippers' current power forward,
who is the NBAs version of a practi
cal joke.
The Kings came away with the
fourth pick: great news in 2003, poi
son in 2009. Maybe, just maybe, they
can come away with 7-foot-3 Con
necticut center llasheem Thabeet.
Sure, he'll provide a body in the
paint, but to be honest, the guy has
less natural talent than William
Hung. Hie best case scenario for
Sacramento is that they take a guy
like Arizona State guard James
Harden and he turns out to be a
high-caliber rookie that can help
lead the team to 25 wins.
Unfortunately, this just isn't w hat
the NBA needs. 13 ol the 16 playoff
teams should not be decided in De
cember. nor should a thinly veiled
form of gambling decide a fran
chise's fortune. Want a way to pre
vent teams from tanking? Level out
the playing field. The NFL Draft
process isn't complicated, but is in
credibly effective at maintaining a
respectable level of competition. If
your team finishes with the worst

record, you get the first pick.
Take, for example, the Miami
Dolphins, who. in the 2007-2008 sea
son, went a whopping 1-15. barely
heating a Baltimore Ravens team
with less offense than the French
army. The Dolphins wasted no time
in selecting Jake Long, an offensive
tackle from Michigan with the first
pick in the draft and. surprise. Long
was named to the Pro Bowl and
Miami bounced back to reach the
playoffs and finish with a record ol
11-5.
Contrast this with the NBA Draft
of 2008. Miami was the worst team
due to a season-ending injury to su
perstar guard Dwayne Wade, but
fell to the second pick. The differ
ence between the Heat's pick.
Michael Beasley. and the first over
all selection by the Chicago Bulls.
Derrick Rose, is self-explanatory.
Sure, Miami made the playoffs, but

they did so by putting the whole
team on Wade's hack. Can you
imagine the Flash teamed with Der
rick Rose? Let me introduce to you
a coach's version of a dream hack
court.
Quite frankly. I am sick of seeing
the same teams brawling for ping
pong balls. While I don't care about
the evolution of a barnyard animal
logo, I would love to observe the
evolution of the league. The NBA
lottery puts a huge damper on the
popularity of the league, as fans of
perpetually underperforming fran
chises (i.e. Memphis) are plagued
with routine disappointments in one
of professional sports' most ridicu
lous customs. Why exile fans and re
duce competition among teams? It
just doesn't make sense.
I know David Stern loves tradi
tion, but it's time that he grows some
ping-pong balls and abolishes the
lottery.

/.iicli Zimmerman does not like ping
pong hulls. Beirut players, contact him
at zachz@stanford.edu and vent your
displeasure.
