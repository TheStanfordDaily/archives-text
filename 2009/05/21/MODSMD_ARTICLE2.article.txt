### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY MANAGING EDITOR 
I ormer State Controller Steve Westly
'78 MBA "S3 spoke to students Wednesday
about the importance of clean technologies
and the growth of that industry, and called
for a immediate worldwide push for alter
native energy sources.
The talk. given through the
Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders (ETL)
seminar series, focused on innovations in
energy research that could have a substan
tial ripple effect. According to Westly, as
companies and countries focus more on
efficient, cost-effective green technology,
they will in turn help boost the global econ
omy and preserve the Earth.
The situation, both economically and
environmentally, is dire, Westly said, hut in
that urgency comes room for innovation.
"Historically, every five to 10 years,
entrepreneurs come up with some new
breakthrough." Westly noted, indicating

that the next big IPOs are likely to be clean
technology companies. "The clean tech
industry is likely to provide the jumpstart
that will help America and the rest of the
world get out of this recession."
At the same time, they'll assist in creat
ing a more environmentally conscious con
sumer society. In particular. Westly men
tioned the car manufacturer Tesla, a leader
in electric vehicles. Since Tesla debuted its
newest model just weeks ago, Westly
claimed that the company, whose hoard he
sits on, has received more orders for their
cars than General Motors has for its Saturn
brand over the same time period.
"You are going to see a move toward
electric cars faster than anything you can
dream," he added.
But beyond the automobile industry.
Westly sees the need for reform across the
board.
Using his background as both a venture
capitalist and politician, the former guber
natorial candidate called for global emis

sions standards, pointing to legislation
passed in Western Europe and Japan on
building standards and cap-and-trade pro
grams as an example for the United States
and China. Westly also expressed frustra
tion, however, with the political process
and a perceived lack of motivation to
become more environmentally conscious.
"Elected officials do us a huge disserv
ice," he said. "If you're a government regu
lator, there are no incentives for doing well.
If you're a private sector entrepreneur,
you're wondering what's wrong with these
government officials."
That said, his insistence on higher stan
dards was unwavering.
"We need a worldwide mandate to have
20 percent alternative energy as soon as
humanely possible," the former ASSU
President said. Westly successfully led stu
dent protests against the University's
