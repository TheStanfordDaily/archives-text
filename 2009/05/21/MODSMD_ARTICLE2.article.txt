## Former State Controller Steve Westly '78 MBA '83 stresses importance of green tech. 
### WYNDAM MAKOWSKY MANAGING EDITOR 
I ormer State Controller Steve Westly
'78 MBA "S3 spoke to students Wednesday
about the importance of clean technologies
and the growth of that industry, and called
for a immediate worldwide push for alter
native energy sources.
The talk. given through the
Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders (ETL)
seminar series, focused on innovations in
energy research that could have a substan
tial ripple effect. According to Westly, as
companies and countries focus more on
efficient, cost-effective green technology,
they will in turn help boost the global econ
omy and preserve the Earth.
The situation, both economically and
environmentally, is dire, Westly said, hut in
that urgency comes room for innovation.
"Historically, every five to 10 years,
entrepreneurs come up with some new
breakthrough." Westly noted, indicating

that the next big IPOs are likely to be clean
technology companies. "The clean tech
industry is likely to provide the jumpstart
that will help America and the rest of the
world get out of this recession."
At the same time, they'll assist in creat
ing a more environmentally conscious con
sumer society. In particular. Westly men
tioned the car manufacturer Tesla, a leader
in electric vehicles. Since Tesla debuted its
newest model just weeks ago, Westly
claimed that the company, whose hoard he
sits on, has received more orders for their
cars than General Motors has for its Saturn
brand over the same time period.
"You are going to see a move toward
electric cars faster than anything you can
dream," he added.
But beyond the automobile industry.
Westly sees the need for reform across the
board.
Using his background as both a venture
capitalist and politician, the former guber
natorial candidate called for global emis

sions standards, pointing to legislation
passed in Western Europe and Japan on
building standards and cap-and-trade pro
grams as an example for the United States
and China. Westly also expressed frustra
tion, however, with the political process
and a perceived lack of motivation to
become more environmentally conscious.
"Elected officials do us a huge disserv
ice," he said. "If you're a government regu
lator, there are no incentives for doing well.
If you're a private sector entrepreneur,
you're wondering what's wrong with these
government officials."
That said, his insistence on higher stan
dards was unwavering.
"We need a worldwide mandate to have
20 percent alternative energy as soon as
humanely possible," the former ASSU
President said. Westly successfully led stu
dent protests against the University's

investment in Apartheid-era South
Africa in the '70s.
Westly further acknowledged
the far-reaching potential of energy
sources beyond the traditional —
and unclean - oil and coal.
"Solar and wind are both stun
ning," he said. "They fit in different
parts of the world. But we're still a
ways away from doing it in the big
volumes that we need."
" Fhat said, the cost of solar is
going through the floor," Westly
continued, "It's going to half this
year. A husband and wife hear that
it's a seven-year payback. Now. it's
3.5 years. Psychologically, that's
huge."
Indeed, his final point about
consumer confidence led to a larg
er theme of the talk: environmental
and monetary goals are not mutu
ally exclusive. In fact, they may aid

one another, Westly said, especially
during dark economic times. While
acting in a more eco-friendly man
ner. governments and entrepre
neurs can still make money. Westly
pointed to three industries in par
ticular that have seen substantial
growth over the past three years, all
of which relate to clean technology:
smart grid and utility enhance
ments, green building materials and
energy storage.
"Whichever country moves first
[on clean technology] will be part
of a tectonic shift," Westly said.
"Countries will move up, countries
will move down."
"Clean technology affects
everyone in this room, and this
planet, whether they know it or
not," he continued. "Even if it
doesn't work, being alive right now,
doing what we're doing in clean
tech, is something they'll be talking
about hundreds of years from
now."
