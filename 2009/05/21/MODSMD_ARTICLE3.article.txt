## Univ. launches Global Gateway Web site 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
Planning for study abroad trips, searching for research
grants and finalizing four-year plans have been made easier
by the I Jniversity's new (ilobal Gateway Web site — the lat
est addition to the Stanford network, the site goes live today
at global.stanford.edu.
As part of the University's international initiative instat
ed in 2005. the development process for the Global Gateway
site began last spring. Members of the Board of Trustees and
the Office of the President approached the Freeman Spogli
Institute (I SI) of International Studies with the idea for the
Web site, as part of the University's larger globalization
effort.
"We're transitioning from Stanford being a premier
national university to being a premier international univer
sity." said FSI Assistant Director of Programs Catharine
Kristian. "We want to make sure that people — both inside
and outside the Stanford community — know about that,
whether they are faculty, students.collaborators in other uni
versities around the world or policy makers."
The Web site features three main sections: a course
search engine, research and interdisciplinary faculty listings.
ITiese segments, all of which are organized by region, are
geared towards easing student search efforts and interdisci
plinary faculty collaborations.
"The Stanford (ilobal (lateway is a portal." Kristian said.
"Our goal is to get people to their end destination — to be
able to find quickly and easily the information that they are
looking for"
"I very time a faculty member [wants] to teach a course
in the field, in a foreign country, he has to reinvent the wheel
all over again." Kristian continued."What we're doing inter
nally is to start building all those tools so that people don't
have to do that."
I br students, the Web site will help with tasks like sched
uling next quarter's classes.They can now find specific coun
try-related courses with a host of foci, and from disciplines
that may not appear to have obvious connections with their
subject of interest. Similarly, the Web site combines all the
research funding opportunities supported by campus
