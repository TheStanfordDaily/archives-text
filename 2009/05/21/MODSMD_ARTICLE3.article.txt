## Univ. launches Global Gateway Web site 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO STAFF WRITER 
Planning for study abroad trips, searching for research
grants and finalizing four-year plans have been made easier
by the I Jniversity's new (ilobal Gateway Web site — the lat
est addition to the Stanford network, the site goes live today
at global.stanford.edu.
As part of the University's international initiative instat
ed in 2005. the development process for the Global Gateway
site began last spring. Members of the Board of Trustees and
the Office of the President approached the Freeman Spogli
Institute (I SI) of International Studies with the idea for the
Web site, as part of the University's larger globalization
effort.
"We're transitioning from Stanford being a premier
national university to being a premier international univer
sity." said FSI Assistant Director of Programs Catharine
Kristian. "We want to make sure that people — both inside
and outside the Stanford community — know about that,
whether they are faculty, students.collaborators in other uni
versities around the world or policy makers."
The Web site features three main sections: a course
search engine, research and interdisciplinary faculty listings.
ITiese segments, all of which are organized by region, are
geared towards easing student search efforts and interdisci
plinary faculty collaborations.
"The Stanford (ilobal (lateway is a portal." Kristian said.
"Our goal is to get people to their end destination — to be
able to find quickly and easily the information that they are
looking for"
"I very time a faculty member [wants] to teach a course
in the field, in a foreign country, he has to reinvent the wheel
all over again." Kristian continued."What we're doing inter
nally is to start building all those tools so that people don't
have to do that."
I br students, the Web site will help with tasks like sched
uling next quarter's classes.They can now find specific coun
try-related courses with a host of foci, and from disciplines
that may not appear to have obvious connections with their
subject of interest. Similarly, the Web site combines all the
research funding opportunities supported by campus

resources to narrow down the
options available to students inter
ested in conducting projects over
seas.
The site will also help with plan
ning for prospective students who
already have an interest in going
abroad.
"We think the funding section is
probably going to be the most popu
lar with students," Kristian said, not
ing that this segment also presented
the biggest challenge in the develop

ment process.
A substantial amount of work
was dedicated to consolidating such
a broad set of resources. In fact, stu
dent research assistants were hired
to search for these grant-funding
opportunities that were previously
scattered among 300 different sites.
"[But| we know that what is on
the site now is just the tip of the ice
berg, so we strongly encourage peo
ple, to add material." Kristian said.
"We're actually very interested in
what the users want because that
will help guide where we're going in
the future."
She believes that student feed
back is essential to improving the
Web site on various levels — noting

that while the University has ideas
about what drives student interest, it
is still keeping a keen eye on which
aspects of the site attract the most
activity.
That said, future plans are
already underway even this early in
the Web site's lifespan. By next fall,
when the University believes stu
dent activity on the site will really
begin to pick up. Stanford hopes that
the site will also contain a calendar
of events with an international
theme, academic resources and RSS
feeds that will provide contact infor
mation for inter-student networking.
