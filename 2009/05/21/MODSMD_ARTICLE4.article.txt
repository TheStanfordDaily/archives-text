## Peer pressure may lead to lower income 
### CAROLINE STOKES 
Most Stanford students have taken at least one class
just because a friend was taking it or had recommend
ed it. But an academic paper co-authored by Stanford
Economics Prof. Giacomo De Giorgi suggests that
these peer-influenced decisions may be diminishing
students' future earnings.
De Giorgi and two professors from Bocconi
University in Italy recently conducted a controlled
study on first-year business students at the Italian uni
versity. where students are randomly assigned to sec
tions for their nine required first-year classes. After the
first three semesters, students choose either a business

01 an economics major. Based on their analysis of these
initial semesters, the researchers found that being fre
quently exposed to another student who chose eco
nomics ('frequently' defined as having at least four out
of the nine sections with the student), increased the
likelihood that the student would also study econom
ics. which is the less popular major by 7.4 percent.
In their paper, "Be as Careful of the Company You
Keep as of the Books You Read: Peer Effects in
Education and on the Labor Market." the professors
argue that the influence that peers' academic decisions
have on a student's choice of major can prevent that
student from choosing the major which best capitalizes
on her or his individual skill set. The researchers claim

the costs of this decision may be a lower CiPA and, as a
result, a reduced salary in the future.
"Results show that, indeed, one is more likely to
choose a major w hen many of his/her peers make the
same choice." the paper explains. "We estimate that,
when it diverts students from majors in which they
seem to have a relative ability advantage, this effect
leads to lower average grades and graduation mark, a
penalty that in the labor market could cost up to 871
euros (1.117 USD) a year."
Many say Stanford students are just as heavily influ
enced by their peers when making academic decisions.
