## Peer pressure may lead to lower income 
### CAROLINE STOKES 
Most Stanford students have taken at least one class
just because a friend was taking it or had recommend
ed it. But an academic paper co-authored by Stanford
Economics Prof. Giacomo De Giorgi suggests that
these peer-influenced decisions may be diminishing
students' future earnings.
De Giorgi and two professors from Bocconi
University in Italy recently conducted a controlled
study on first-year business students at the Italian uni
versity. where students are randomly assigned to sec
tions for their nine required first-year classes. After the
first three semesters, students choose either a business

01 an economics major. Based on their analysis of these
initial semesters, the researchers found that being fre
quently exposed to another student who chose eco
nomics ('frequently' defined as having at least four out
of the nine sections with the student), increased the
likelihood that the student would also study econom
ics. which is the less popular major by 7.4 percent.
In their paper, "Be as Careful of the Company You
Keep as of the Books You Read: Peer Effects in
Education and on the Labor Market." the professors
argue that the influence that peers' academic decisions
have on a student's choice of major can prevent that
student from choosing the major which best capitalizes
on her or his individual skill set. The researchers claim

the costs of this decision may be a lower CiPA and, as a
result, a reduced salary in the future.
"Results show that, indeed, one is more likely to
choose a major w hen many of his/her peers make the
same choice." the paper explains. "We estimate that,
when it diverts students from majors in which they
seem to have a relative ability advantage, this effect
leads to lower average grades and graduation mark, a
penalty that in the labor market could cost up to 871
euros (1.117 USD) a year."
Many say Stanford students are just as heavily influ
enced by their peers when making academic decisions.
When English major Luke
Henesy '10 realized after his sopho
more year that he was not looking
forward to reading Shakespeare and
studying literature during his last
two years at Stanford, he found him
self searching for a new major. When
Henesy's roommate in Madrid last
fall happened to he an architectural
design major who introduced
Henesy to this relatively new depart
ment at Stanford, he started map
ping out how he could start and
complete the major in two years.
Soon, he had a new major.
"I was basically open to anything
in Spain," he continued, "if my
roommate had been a studio art
major, I probably would've done
that if they'd spoke highly about it...1
feel like with a lot of people, major
decisions end up being pretty cir
cumstantial. Like based on the peo
ple that you know, what you're
exposed to."
Grace Laidlaw '10 agreed that
peers can easily influence students'
academic choices.
"I definitely decided to do Bio
over Hum Bio because my boyfriend
at the time, who I think is one of the
smartest people I know, told me that
Hum√üio was fuzzy and a lot less use
ful than Bio," she said.
Laura Selznick. special assistant
for diversity outreach to the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate
Education, has advised Stanford stu
dents since 1986, and is not surprised
by these instances of peer-influenced
major decisions.
"Stanford students are often
more comfortable talking to their
peers than the professors," she
explained.
Ashley Rhoades '12 agreed that
peers are more easily accessible and
useful sources of information on
classes than advisors.
"[My pre-assigned freshman year
advisor] didn't really give me any
sense of direction," Rhoades said.
"[She] just kind of just told me to do
what I wanted to do, which was kind
of overwhelming as a freshman. But
my peer mentor was actually a lot
more helpful than my actual advisor.
He was really good about telling me
which classes I should be taking that
are good, which professors and stuff."

Professor Michele Pellizzari of
Bocconi University, one of the three
economists who co-authored the
paper, said improving dissemination
of information about each depart
ment could help students make bet
ter decisions.
"Universities should make sure
that students are well informed about
what exactly each subject is about."
Pellizzari wrote in an email to Itie
Daily.
Although some Stanford students
admit to selecting classes and majors
based on peers' decisions, few seem
worried that these choices could have
negative effects on their future career
choices.
"Sure, switching from English to
architecture, my GPA is going to take
a hit, but I don't think it's going to be
too bad," Henesy said.
In fact. Henesy said he actually
believes his career options have
expanded now that he is gaining an
engineering background in addition
to all the English classes he took his
sophomore year. He also notes that
many of the Stanford graduates he
knows are now working in fields
completely unrelated to their major.
"While 1 don't think I want to be
an architect. I feel like the purpose of
an undergraduate major is just to
explore a subject that you're passion
ate about." he said. "At Stanford. I'm
only going to be here once, so I might
as well take advantage of something
that I might not be able to pursue
again."
On the other hand, although
Rhoades is interested in art history,
she thinks she will forgo majoring in
art history for a double major in
international relations and communi

cation in preparation for a career in
either journalism or diplomacy.
"I think, career-wise. I d rather go
into one of those two fields than any
thing to do with art," she said.
Selznick is quick to point out that
majors at Stanford do not pigeon
hole students into future careers.
"One mistake is that students
think the major has to be a prerequi
site for their career." she said.
Selznick said that through her
many years advising at Stanford,
there have been countless examples
of students who are now doing some
thing completely unrelated to what
they studied here on the Farm. For
example, one of her advisees was a
Japanese major but ended up in
healthcare consulting and ultimately
ended up at medical school, even
though she had not been pre-med at
Stanford.
That being said. Selznick encour
aged the students to pursue the fields
they are most passionate about.
"We encourage students to major
in something they're interested in
and are good at." Selznick said.
"Because two years later, your major
is going to matter a lot less than what
you learned and what you did."
Although the results of his study
suggest that students do not always
choose the major that is best for
their skill set. Pellizzari agrees that
interest in a subject is the most
important prerequisite for a major.
"Just go for the subject you like
better." he said. "You will generally
have a strong comparative advan
tage there, at least in terms of moti
vation."
Jemma Wolfe '12 has certainly
found this to be true during her first

year here.
"I think I do better in the classes
I enjoy the most because I put the
most effort into them." she
explained.

cumstantial. Like based on the peo
ple that you know, what you're
exposed to."
Grace Laidlaw '10 agreed that
peers can easily influence students'
academic choices.
"I definitely decided to do Bio
over Hum Bio because my boyfriend
at the time, who I think is one of the
smartest people I know, told me that
Hum√üio was fuzzy and a lot less use
ful than Bio," she said.
Laura Selznick. special assistant
for diversity outreach to the Vice
Provost for Undergraduate
Education, has advised Stanford stu
dents since 1986, and is not surprised
by these instances of peer-influenced
major decisions.
"Stanford students are often
more comfortable talking to their
peers than the professors," she
explained.
Ashley Rhoades '12 agreed that
peers are more easily accessible and
useful sources of information on
classes than advisors.
"[My pre-assigned freshman year
advisor] didn't really give me any
sense of direction," Rhoades said.
"[She] just kind of just told me to do
what I wanted to do, which was kind
of overwhelming as a freshman. But
my peer mentor was actually a lot
more helpful than my actual advisor.
He was really good about telling me
which classes I should be taking that
are good, which professors and stuff."

Professor Michele Pellizzari of
Bocconi University, one of the three
economists who co-authored the
paper, said improving dissemination
of information about each depart
ment could help students make bet
ter decisions.
"Universities should make sure
that students are well informed about
what exactly each subject is about."
Pellizzari wrote in an email to Itie
Daily.
Although some Stanford students
admit to selecting classes and majors
based on peers' decisions, few seem
worried that these choices could have
negative effects on their future career
choices.
"Sure, switching from English to
architecture, my GPA is going to take
a hit, but I don't think it's going to be
too bad," Henesy said.
In fact. Henesy said he actually
believes his career options have
expanded now that he is gaining an
engineering background in addition
to all the English classes he took his
sophomore year. He also notes that
many of the Stanford graduates he
knows are now working in fields
completely unrelated to their major.
"While 1 don't think I want to be
an architect. I feel like the purpose of
an undergraduate major is just to
explore a subject that you're passion
ate about." he said. "At Stanford. I'm
only going to be here once, so I might
as well take advantage of something
that I might not be able to pursue
again."
On the other hand, although
Rhoades is interested in art history,
she thinks she will forgo majoring in
art history for a double major in
international relations and communi

cation in preparation for a career in
either journalism or diplomacy.
"I think, career-wise. I d rather go
into one of those two fields than any
thing to do with art," she said.
Selznick is quick to point out that
majors at Stanford do not pigeon
hole students into future careers.
"One mistake is that students
think the major has to be a prerequi
site for their career." she said.
Selznick said that through her
many years advising at Stanford,
there have been countless examples
of students who are now doing some
thing completely unrelated to what
they studied here on the Farm. For
example, one of her advisees was a
Japanese major but ended up in
healthcare consulting and ultimately
ended up at medical school, even
though she had not been pre-med at
Stanford.
That being said. Selznick encour
aged the students to pursue the fields
they are most passionate about.
"We encourage students to major
in something they're interested in
and are good at." Selznick said.
"Because two years later, your major
is going to matter a lot less than what
you learned and what you did."
Although the results of his study
suggest that students do not always
choose the major that is best for
their skill set. Pellizzari agrees that
interest in a subject is the most
important prerequisite for a major.
"Just go for the subject you like
better." he said. "You will generally
have a strong comparative advan
tage there, at least in terms of moti
vation."
Jemma Wolfe '12 has certainly
found this to be true during her first

year here.
"I think I do better in the classes
I enjoy the most because I put the
most effort into them." she
explained.
