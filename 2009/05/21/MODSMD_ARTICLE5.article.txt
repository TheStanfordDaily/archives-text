GAME NOTES: The Cardinal takes on Arizona
for the fourth time this season with a trip to
the Women's College World Series on the
line. Senior pitcher Missy Penna will see if she
has what it takes to contain a conference
dominating Wildcat offense to improve
Stanford to 3-1 against Arizona this year.

Alto and Arizona winning in Tucson.
Despite going 2-1 tn the season series,
the Cardinal was outscored bv the
Wildcats 16-10.
"It's definitely an interesting
match-up," said Cardinal head coach
John Rittman. "Both teams are very
familiar with one another and every
body is just ready to play."
Cardinal left-fielder Alissa Haber

feels the team ean learn a lot from its
previous games against the Wildcats.
"We've learned that it is a fight
every time we play them." she said.
"We know we can't take them lightly
in any part of the game."
Stanford is coming off of an unde
feated performance in the Stanford
Regional last weekend. ITie Cardinal
bree/ed through, easily winning
games against Portland State, Nevada
and Cal Poly.
Arizona had a more circuitous
route to Palo Alto. Despite being the
ninth seed, the Wildcats were sent to
Kentucky for the Louisville Regional.
Many in Arizona saw this as a sign of
disrespect, and the Wildcats sent a
strong message in response.
In three games, the Arizona

offense, which leads the nation, scored
31 runs including 18 in a win over host
Louisville
Rittman recognizes the potential
of his opponent.
"They are a very talented team."
he said. "They have power up and
down the lineup. They have speed up
and down the lineup, and they have
three pitchers that have really
improved."
The Wildcats are undoubtedly
unhappy about having to make the
trip northwest to Palo Alto as well —
despite losing two of three to the
Cardinal this season, Arizona finished
in third place in the Pac-10, one spot
ahead of Stanford.

Although Stanford has won two of its three encounters with the Wildcats this
season, the Cardinal is wary of Arizona's offensive prowess. Senior pitcher
Missy Penna was clobbered with 12 runs in 13 hits in her last 'Cat encounter,
but this time, a trip to the Women's College World Series is on the line.
