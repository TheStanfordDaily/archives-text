Although Stanford has won two of its three encounters with the Wildcats this
season, the Cardinal is wary of Arizona's offensive prowess. Senior pitcher
Missy Penna was clobbered with 12 runs in 13 hits in her last 'Cat encounter,
but this time, a trip to the Women's College World Series is on the line.
The big question of the weekend will he if
the Wildcats' prolific offense can be tamed by
Stanford's ace. senior Missy Penna.
In her first start against the Wildcats
who have already shattered the single-season
team record for home runs in a season with
131 — Penna was lit up to the tune of 12 runs
on 13 hits, including three home runs, in 5.2 in
nings.
In her next start against Arizona, however.
Penna went the distance, allowing just one hit
and striking out 13 Wildcat hitters.
Penna hopes to repeat the success of her
second performance this weekend.
"You have good days and you have bad

days.' Penna said."lt is different when you are
home and away. They have a rowdy crowd
down there, but when I pitched at home. I was
more relaxed in our environment."
For the year, the senior is 34-6 with a 1.45
IRA. She has struck out 344 batters, and when
all is said and done.she will be seen as not only
one of the greatest pitchers in Stanford histo
ry, but as one of the greatest pitchers in Pac-10
history.
I .eading Arizona's offensive attack is junior
catcher Stacie Chambers. Although she is third
on the team with a .386 batting average, she
leads the nation in home runs with 31.
Penna tries not to let Arizona's power num

bers effect her preparation.
"They are just another team — a good team,
but regardless I prepare the same way," Penna
said."l try to get myself ready to play anyone."
While Arizona may hold an offensive ad
vantage. Stanford has not been too shabby at
the plate itself.
I"he top of the C ardinal lineup is as good as
any in the country, with I la her leading off and
freshman Ashley I lansen hitting second. Maber
leads the team with a .450 batting average and
59 runs scored.The two-time Ail-American Oiis
year also set a Stanford single-season record
with 24 doubles.
Hansen has been nearly as impressive. The

Pac-10 Freshman of the Year is hitting .410 with
23 doubles of her own to go along with a team
leading 53 RBI.
Many around the country see this as the pre
eminent Super Regional. Proof of this is that all
three games will he televised on either ESPN or
ESPN2.
"A lot rides on these games." Penna said.
"We know what we have to do. and we are just
going to leave everything on the field."
