## AWK-upied BATHROOMS AT STANFORD ARE FOR SHITS AND GIGGLES 
### CASSANDRA FELICIANO CONTRIBUTING WRITER 
very one does it. Some of us
are silent and secretive. Some
of us like to bring a snack or a
InHflK/l g°°d magazine, play a game
UHBBw'or burn incense. And some of
us are just looking to make new friends.
Stanford is a diverse place, but one thing
unites us all — the bathroom.
TOILET TALK
"It's a captive audience, and I've got
nothing else to do," explained Alden
Timme '11, who professed great enthusi
asm for making conversation on the john.
"It's a great time, because otherwise,
you're doing work or something and you
have to concentrate. But usually, when
you're showering or dumping, there's no
concentration that goes into cleaning your
self — you can have a good conversation."
For Timme, comfort room chats were
just another branch of dorm bonding.
Alex Scherer '11, who lived in Alondra
with Timme last year, is not so comfortable
with the idea of toilet talk.
"I don't like to talk while I'm naked,"
he said. "If you think about it, while you're
naked, you could be looking at your junk:
and if you're looking at your junk. 1 don't
want someone looking at their junk while
they're thinking of me or vice versa. I don't
want my face to be associated with junk."
Scherer has. in fact, been known to curb
any attempts at restroom conversation,
responding to a question or commenting
politely, albeit curtly, before choosing to
discontinue the bathroom banter.
"When I tried to talk with Alex last
year, he like almost yelled at me." Timme
noted. "(Alex) thought that bathroom time
was a man's time of solace to meditate on
his thoughts."
Many Stanford students are not as
rightwing as Scherer, and fewer are leftists
when it comes to toilet tete-a-tetes. In fact,
they usually hover somewhere around the
center of the spectrum, preferring to limit
discussions to the showers and sinks.
"That's usually where we'd have our
time to catch up," said Michelle Dadourian
'11. "Generally when you're in the stalls
though. I would say that's a no-go."
Eric Molina '11 agreed. .
"When you're on the toilet, it's like
being on the throne," he said. "You don't
want to be bothered. You want to com
mand in peace."
Some even go so far as to schedule their
showers together in order to avail of these
sink-side chats.
Naturally, however, as these codes of
etiquette are. for the most part, unwritten,
they rarely help in regulating the use and
misuse of the dormitory bathrooms. Where
the Emily Post protocol will not suffice or
simply does not apply, Stanford students
have resorted to intriguing solutions in
'loo' of etiquette.
YOUR BATHROOM IS A TEMPLE
Over the years, the water closet has pro
gressed into a make-shift hiding place — a
peaceful sanctuary that, for many, is supe
rior to the bedroom as a common go-to for
some quality "me" time. The white, or oth-

erwise neutral-colored, tiles and the prom
ise of privacy have long been conducive to
puzzling out the toughest questions on a
problem set, formulating a thesis or maybe
just doing a little late-night soul searching.
The men's bathroom on the third floor
of Rinconada (Rinc) in Wilbur has an
unusual architecture that hints at the regal.
Light pours in from a circular window,
bathing trapezoid-shaped urinals in glow
ing white light. There are five or six gath
ered together, as if the niche doubles as a
forum for the Roman Assembly. Students
may as well wear togas instead of towels as
they make their way to the showers in a
separate wing.
It's difficult to determine whether or
not it was the bathroom's natural character
or sheer audacity that propelled Cougar
Oswald '12 to pimp his potty.
"A man's toilet is his oasis." Oswald
wrote in an email to The Daily.
While this Rinc bathroom is not exactly
paradise, Oswald did try to come close.
Posters, smokeless incense and a literary
menu including Maxim were employed to
furnish this "home away from home."
Oswald also provided a poo diary for the
Rinc boys, perhaps to facilitate their soul
searching, though they have yet to reach
nirvana.
Oswald, unfortunately, declined 'Hie
Daily's offer for an in-bathroom interview,
in an effort to preserve the sanctity of his
private space.
"Some men. like those in the third floor
at Rinc, are lucky enough to have toilet
accessories " Oswald wrote. "Whether it is

a solo poo — a great opportunity to get
some time to yourself — or a social poo —
some of my best conversations are those
with fellow poopers in adjacent stalls —
my time on the john is often one of my
favorite parts of the day. Above all. howev
er, men go to the toilet to escape the stress
and social etiquette forced upon us by the
female sex. We can always rest assured that
our poos are private endeavors of which
the details are known exclusively by our
fellow males."
HIDE AND GO POOP
While most students do not have the
lavatory luxuries of the third floor at Rinc,
many still think of creative ways to pass
time in the 100. In Alondra last spring, a
small band of boys on the third floor
answered nature's call — of creativity.
Scherer introduced the game Hide and
Go Poop — known as Poop and Go Seek
outside of Europe — to fellow Alondrans
Timme. Zach Koehn '11 and Mark
Frykman '11. While Scherer is a firm
believer in private pooping, he proposed
that the game test one's ability to "secrete"
their time on the crapper.
"It's fun to do something that's silly and
wacky and a little revolting to some peo
ple," he said, smiling wryly. "You know, it
gets a rise out of people. It's a little taboo."
Hide and Go Poop contenders gained
points by either hitting their opponents
with a wet paper towel while they were on
the john or pooping without being hit. Five
points were awarded for each successful
poop and three points for a "catch."

The game grew to include a majority of
the hoys living on the third floor. They all
noted that timing was key in getting ahead.
"Certain times of the day are notorious
ly hot for dumping," Frykman said. "A lit
tle bit after lunch was a good one."
Some followed the "early and often"
plan or avoided contact altogether, choos
ing pockets of time when no one was
around, while others chose to go with the
flow. One Alondran even opted to squat
on top of the toilet in his eagerness to gain
a few points. Most tactics, however, were
ineffective due to the rather small pool of
players and limited facilities.
"We didn't have a lot of people playing,
so it was always pretty obvious that some
one was pooping," Frykman said.
Hide and Go Poop, in spite of the hype,
was relatively short-lived, lasting only two
to three weeks.The Alondrans lost interest
for a variety of reasons. Some, like Timme,
were frustrated, unable to climb the point
ladder.
"1 was losing pretty badly, and I tried to
sabotage the scoring system," he said. "But
I can't aim very well over the stall."
In the end. however, the Alondrans
were tired of the pressure.
"It was no longer exciting," Scherer
lamented. "1 just wanted to take a poop in
peace again."
THE LOOKING GLASS
Innovation is unparalleled in many
ways at Stanford — avoiding the awk
wardness of a public bathroom included.
But, sometimes, we just have to embrace it.

For Stanford students living in Phi Sig,
the issue extends beyond having privacy
invaded hv a common bathroom.
Residents must contend with glass shower
doors, which definitely leave little to the
imagination.
"You can't see through them complete
ly, but it's pretty invasive at the same time,"
said Ron Pomper '11. "Someone also took
a picture of me while I was in the bath
room. and that was really awkward
because you could tell it was me."
A few students opted to strategically
drape their towels over the shower doors
or shower in the dark. It became increas
ingly more uncomfortable, for the boys
especially, when the cleaning schedule con
flicted with prime morning shower time.
I lowever. many residents were not as
affected and became accustomed more
easily and quickly to the shower doors.
"Since they're somewhat misty, you
can't see people or whatever; you can just
see shapes and colors," Dadourian said. "I
want to say in the beginning of the year it
was definitely more awkward, but now
everyone's pretty used to the idea."
The inherently chaotic lifestyle of the
quarter system requires a bit of time to
flush away pandemonium from a Stanford
student's head, and toilet talk, games or a
simple conversation can help to alleviate
some of the stress. Stanford houses some
of the most brilliant people in the world,
but hey, we all still have to poop.

Translucent bathroom stalls in Phi Sig make any sojourn to the shower an illuminating experience. Residents have taken precautions by strategically draping towels over the shower doors to
provide a semblance of privacy.
