## Researchers visualize complex data 
### ERIC MESSINGER DESK EDITOR 
Representing complex data in
comprehensible visuals is a challenge
for researchers, both at Stanford and
in the private sector, and is gaining
popularity as a subject of academic
study on campus.
Faculty and students are working
on new ways to display information
in useful ways through innovative
visualizations. Computer Science
Professor Jeffrey Heer is involved in
these efforts, and said spatial repre
sentation provides a valuable way of
approaching complex issues.
"For the very large and difficult
questions, often times by mapping
data you're able to see patterns you
wouldn't get by running through the
numbers," Heer said.
Heer added that the field is seeing
an uptick in interest, particularly
from students looking to apply les
sons across disciplinary boundaries
to their work in technical fields.
"They're very much interested
and attuned to using insights from
psychology to motivate the kind of
systems that we're building," he said.
"It's funny, but no one thought com
puter programming would be the
sexy job of the '90s, and no one
thought data analysis would be the
sexy job of the next ten years."
Heer said the tools of visualiza
tion could be applied across any
number of data sets, ranging from
representations of the internal distri
bution of emails within Enron
Corporation to long-term immigra
tion trends.
The computer science professor
added that while the digital age has
brought a great increase in the avail
ability of valuable data, interacting
with that information in a meaningful
way has proven problematic. He said
research in the area primarily looked
toward the ways in which users relate
with displays.
"One area of interest has been in
patterns of human interaction." Heer

pointed out. "What we try to do is
understand, how do people use visu
alizations to find insight? We use data
sets as a kind of petri dish."
Heer said the goal was ultimately
to devise general principles for repre
senting any kind of data set.
"The hope is. as we build our
understanding and our set of tools, it
will be applicable beyond just the
data itself," Heer said.
Heer and his students were on
hand Monday at an event called
"Places and Spaces," which debuted a
collection of visualizations from non-
Stanford researchers focused upon
representing scientific data. The
exhibit will be housed at Wallenberg
Hall (Building 160) until the end of
2009.
Heer said the exhibition drew
upon the "rich tradition of cartogra
phy"
Jason Chuang.a fourth-year Ph.D.
student in computer science and a
former Daily photo editor, shared a
project that mapped the disciplinary
relationships between doctoral dis
sertations across a number of depart
ments. His research drew upon the
text from the abstracts of 9.068 dis
sertations from the past sixteen years.
Chuang's project was a dynamic
display that allowed users to cus
tomize their focus. Affinities between
the content of different dissertations
were typically represented by prox
imity. allowing observers to quickly
discern complicated relationships
between disciplines or even individ
ual papers.
Chuang said the work demon
strated the possibilities inherent in
examining the content of vast data
sets.
"It gets at the general problem of
a large collection of documents," he
said.
He added that the tool could be
applicable for researchers searching
for work in related, or unexpectedly
related, fields.
