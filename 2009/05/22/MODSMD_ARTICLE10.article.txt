The "Desperate Housewives" two-hour season finale ranked among one of
the most nerve-wracking episodes of the show's five seasons. The suspense
was driven by the storyline of psychotic Dave, whose delusional visions
brought Edie back for a cameo. Dave has been bad news since the season
premiere, but as he plotted to kill the adorable and young MJ, he became a
thing of nightmares.
While Gaby's shallow life lessons to her children kept things lighter,
the fear of Mi's fate drags on through the two hours. The Bree-Orson saga
will continue into the next season as Orson has blackmailed Bree into stay
ing married. The closest thing to a cliffhanger is Lynette's announcement
that she is carrying twins.
Compared to the time leap of last year's finale, this season ended with
some resolution. Will Gaby be able to handle her teenager? Will Tom get to
pursue his college dreams while having to provide for even more children?
Will Katherine be out for revenge against Susan for stealing her fiancd?
These questions will keep viewers wondering until fall, but ultimately, they
arc questions that can wait. At least the episode ended with a happy wed
ding, as the writers proved once again that anything that happens on
Wisteria Lane can be undone.
