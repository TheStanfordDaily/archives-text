The "Desperate Housewives" two-hour season finale ranked among one of
the most nerve-wracking episodes of the show's five seasons. The suspense
was driven by the storyline of psychotic Dave, whose delusional visions
brought Edie back for a cameo. Dave has been bad news since the season
premiere, but as he plotted to kill the adorable and young MJ, he became a
thing of nightmares.
While Gaby's shallow life lessons to her children kept things lighter,
the fear of Mi's fate drags on through the two hours. The Bree-Orson saga
will continue into the next season as Orson has blackmailed Bree into stay
ing married. The closest thing to a cliffhanger is Lynette's announcement
that she is carrying twins.
Compared to the time leap of last year's finale, this season ended with
some resolution. Will Gaby be able to handle her teenager? Will Tom get to
pursue his college dreams while having to provide for even more children?
Will Katherine be out for revenge against Susan for stealing her fiancd?
These questions will keep viewers wondering until fall, but ultimately, they
arc questions that can wait. At least the episode ended with a happy wed
ding, as the writers proved once again that anything that happens on
Wisteria Lane can be undone.

Season finales are supposed to be EPIC. Always.
No excuses. Also, in the case of Smallville,
titling a season eight finale "Doomsday" creates
a level of expectation. Unfortunately, this
episode lacked that overall "wow" factor and
failed on more levels than it succeeded.
Let's start with the good. I was personally
pleased and surprised when the show's writers
decided to kill Jimmy off, thereby breaking a
major adaptation rule. Good for them — just
don't kill Lois Lane. Besides that, Clark learned
an important lesson at the end of the episode
that will finally help to put him on the path of
being the hero that he's meant to be. Having
Davis Bloom, the human, kill limmy helped to
show the darkness in humanity — something
that Clark needed to realize.
Now let's talk about the bad, which I'll
have to make brief despite its many occur-

rcnces. The "fight"
between Doomsday
and Clark was an
epic disappointment,
especially the con
clusion. Although
having Lois travel to
the future was an
interesting concept, I
would have much
rather seen more
development in her
relationship with

Clark. Finally, although Clark realizing that
humanity isn't all that it's crackcd up to be is
important — I would have liked to have seen
more of an "ending" rather than just having
Clark leave. Pretty much every Smallville sea
son finale consists of Clark leaving in a huff of
angst. After eight seasons, 1 think we are all get
ting sick of it.
Looking into season nine, 1 think that
Smallville has had a great and healthy run —
but it's time to end it already. The characters are
running out of places to go, and Clark has
already faced some of his biggest enemies. My
fingers are crossed that Clark will finally open
his heart up to Lois and learn how to freakin' fly
already.
