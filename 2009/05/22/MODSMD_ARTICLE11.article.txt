# Stanford Film Festival
## 
### 
This past week, the south of France played host to some
of the most glamorous celebrities in the business at the
annual Cannes Film Festival. For those of you dreamily
waiting for the day when you will walk down the red carpet
with all the stars, fret no longer, for we have the (semi) next
best thing here at Stanford, in our very own Cubberley
Auditorium. Think we're joking? There actually will be a red
carpet, a Grand lury and a prize equivalent to the "Palme
d'Or" (Cannes' best Picture).
This Thursday, Friday and Saturday (May 21 to 23), the
Stanford Film Society will present "Show And Tell: The 2009
Stanford Student Film Festival." This festival will consist of two
nights (Thursday and Friday) of student films covering a wide
range of genres including dramas, comedies, art house, docu
mentaries, music videos and interstitials. On Saturday night,
prizes will be awarded. And we're not just talking about a gift
certificate to Fraiche — think something much bigger. Of the
60 films submitted, winners will receive such prizes as iPods,
camcorders and digital cameras. However, those aren't even
the big winners. The filmmakers that win the Grand Jury prize
will be sent on a trip to Los Angeles, where they will get to
meet with the Executive Vice President of Warner Brothers
Pictures, Bill Guttentag (also a Stanford graduate).
Intermission was privileged enough to get an advanced
screening of some of the movies. We were pleasantly surprised
with the high caliber of many of the films. Forty-four films
were accepted into the festival, and, from the handful that we

saw, most seem very entertaining. There will be approximately
100 minutes of film shown each night. Look forward to funny
movies about mismatched tour guides, or dramas that mod
ernize the story of Orpheus and Eurydice. Encounter two
lonely people unknowingly sharing a cup of tea in a lovely art
house piece. Or, enjoy a music video all about regulating genes.
Not to hype it up too much (1 don't want you to be disappoint
ed) but look out for The Fun, a very creative film shown from
the perspective of an oppressed individual. The amount of
material at the festival is varied and tun to watch.
It came as a bit of shock seeing how much talent and film
making prowess was shown in this small sample of films.
Unlike schools such as USC or UCLA, Stanford isn't exactly
known for its cinematic potential. This lack in film expertise is
exactly the reason the film festival this year has been vamped
into a glamorous weekend celebration. According to co-chairs
of the festival Ellie Wen '09 and Jesse Krompier '10, the prob
lem of feeble arts at Stanford has motivated the Stanford Film
Society to make this event better than ever. Filmmaking should
have a bigger, better presence on campus. Krompier could not
emphasize enough how he wanted this event to bring more
students into the Stanford Film Society and the film commu
nity on campus in general. As Krompier put it, "We are trying
to build an atmosphere of excitement on this campus, and we
certainly need to tighten the community."
So if you are looking for something to do this weekend, or
even if you've already made plans, cancel everything and head
over to the film festival. Come to the event and meet other stu
dents interested in making and watching movies. And at the

same time, get a glimpse of the movie making potential here
on campus. It truly seems like it will be a great, well-organized
event, close in quality to that of Cannes. You may even run into
Leonardo DiCaprio. But don't count on it.

The only way I can describe this film is trippy. The filmmaker
uses a very original method to capture a phenomenon that is
simply cool to watch. The filmmaker asks random people to
reenact what they are currently discussing while he records the
audio. Then the same people switch roles and while they reen
act it, he plays the audio that he just recorded. I know, really
confusing. You have to sec it for yourself.

This extremely creative comedy documents the oppressive life
of a ceiling fan. Forced to eternally spin without any acknowl
edgment from the people below, the fan claims that its life is
tragic. With this original perspective, the audience gets a
glimpse of what it's like to be controlled by someone else.
Maybe we should be nicer to our things, one day they might
retaliate...

From a technical point of view, this film was probably the best
one we saw. The setting and lighting was very instrumental in
establishing the proper mood. Specifically, the ringing could
drive a person mad. This drama is a modern take on the trag
ic myth of Orpheus and Eurydice. A man loves his neighbor,
but she is involved with another man. Consequently, the man
must decide how to appropriately act and whether love is truly
worth it.

This documentary recounts the history of the mov
ing picture. At first, this topic may sound dull, but
it is actually extremely interesting, especially
because the birth of the moving picture occurred
right here at Stanford. Apparently it all started
when Leland Stanford himself beseeched Eadweard
Muybridge, a photographer, to investigate whether
the legs of his prize-winning horse ever left the
ground all at the same time. The rest is history,
Who (aside from art history majors) knew?

Do you have any clingy friends? Friends that invite you to
lunch? Friends that make a Facebook event to invite you to
lunch? If yes, it'll make you chuckle.
