# An animated discussion Chris Wedge.
## 
### 
Have you ever seen the movie "Ice Age?" What about "Horton Hears
A Who?" Last Wednesday, the mastermind behind these adorable
animated films visited Stanford.
Chris Wedge is an Oscar-winning director and producer of animated
films, as well as the co-founder of Blue Sky Studios, a company that focus
es on realistic, computer-generated character animation. Wedge graduated
from the film department of SUNY-Purchase and received his master's
degree at Ohio State in computer graphics. He wrote and directed "Bunny,"
which won an Oscar for the best animated short film.
Wedge's talk on Wednesday night focused on the process of creating
animations step by step. He played various clips of the easily recognizable,
adorable squirrel Scrat from "Ice Age." Wedge was very down-to-earth,
explaining the collaborative effort of creating animation. He emphasized
the amount of detailed work that goes into Blue Sky productions. Lighting,
sound and character design arc all micromanaged. The movies start as
primitive black and white cartoons, which then go through a long creative
development. Instead of writing a script, artists paint colorful storyboards
called color keys.
"Everyone takes their job making cartoons very seriously," joked
Wedge.
Someone has to design and create every single branch, vine and leaf
you see in the movies. Wedge and his team created their own animation
software, developing an algorithm that tracks light rays in a scene and relays
the information back to the camera pixel by pixel. This illuminates their
movies, diffusing light so that the setting looks livelier and more complex.
Wedge described his philosophy as an attempt at nonverbally conveying
emotions and stories.
"Trying to put a storybook on film is a romantic notion for me," he
said. "In animation, you get to invent a world and immerse the viewer in it."
Wedge played clips from his movie, "Robots," and explained how he
took his team to a junkyard in Connecticut to find inspiration. This July,

"Ice Age 3: Dawn of the Dinosaurs"
will be released. The movie

continues the story of Scrat
the squirrel, Manny the
mammoth and Diego the

tiger. Scrat incessantly
searches for his acorn and,

along the way, finds romance
with a lady squirrel. Wedge's dis-

cussion was fairly interesting and
made one appreciate the amount of

hard work that goes into making ani
mated movies.
