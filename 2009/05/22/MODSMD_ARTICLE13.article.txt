## Perfectly Engineered Cooking 
### 
France is widely considered to be the home of the world's best
food, while California is frequently regarded as a center of
cutting-edge innovation — both politically and technologi
cally. So what could be better than combining the first-rate culi
nary influence of France with a fresh kick that could only exist in
California? The answer is not a great many thing, and this little fact
can be confirmed through a visit to Sent Sovi Restaurant in
Saratoga.
Located about 30 minutes from Stanford on Big Basin Way in
Saratoga, Sent Sovi occupies a small unassuming storefront with a
distinctly old-fashioned-looking wooden sign hanging outside.
The dining room is small and intimate — though not claustro
phobic — and is generally elegant, though with some rustic relief
thanks to plentiful copper accents on the walls. But the real
excitement begins when the menus arrive.

A dinner at Sent Sovi can be taken as a prix fixe or a la carte. The
seven-course tasting menu is $75 with the option of adding on wine
pairings. If ordering a la carte, starters are in the low teens while
mains are in the thirties. But unless money is not an object, the way
to go is with the weekly special prix fixe: three courses with two paired
wines for $45. The special does not offer any choice, but does change
every week.
This week, the starter was a generous-sized piece of arctic char (a
salmon-like fish) cooked to 117.5 degrees Fahrenheit — just hot
enough to clear everything from a food safety standpoint and make
the skin perfectly palatable, while still leaving the full flavor that
makes the fish worth eating. With nothing seasoning the fish besides
a little olive oil and salt, the result was simplistic perfection. While
substantially busier, the "Hangtown Fry" on the a la carte appetizer
menu was nothing short of spectacular. First, it includes an 18-hour
cooked bacon confit that provided the crispy, smoky flavor of bacon
with the decadent richness of pork belly. Also on the plate were two
flash-fried Bluepoint Oysters, generously breaded and crispy on the
outside, while still packing an almost-raw oyster taste inside. If that
wasn't enough, the icing on the cake was a sunny-side-up quail egg
topped with sturgeon caviar.
The main course on the weekly special was a slow-cooked braised
short rib. Similar to the char, cooking at a low temperature for a long
time allowed for an even, natural flavor while still being sufficiently
cooked. The first bite was almost jaw-dropping and while the '98
Cabernet Sauvignon was excellent, the richness of the short ribs might
have better been complemented by something more like a petite syrah.
Initially, the dessert listed simply as "compressed fruit" seemed
uninspiring. But it became apparent that this wasn't any ordinary fruit
salad when the chef had to come to the table to explain what was actu
ally going on. A brilliant complement had been chosen for each fruit:
orange brandy for the apple, vanilla for the cantaloupe, and simple
syrup for the watermelon. Each fruit then was infused with its comple
ment and put into a vacuum chamber causing the pores in the fruit to
fill with the added liquid. Chef Slone, who started out as an engineer
at UCLA, went onto describe the intricacies of the vacuum chamber
and all of the magic one can accomplish with it. He explained, for
example, the ability to achieve a low-temperature boil, "because obvi
ously PV=nRT," citing the ideal gas law as it applies in his kitchen.
After compression, the fruit was served in a sweet-but-tangy soup of
Indonesian peppers that, in one word, was genius.

Dining at Sent Sovi is far from cheap — but the $45 special din
ner is an absolute steal. The food is top-notch, the staff is knowl-

edgcable and professional and the atmosphere is classy but not
stuffy. Combining all of these aspects makes for a nearly per
fect experience. If you have trouble picturing it, just imagine

the typical chaos and misery of a meal at the Axe and Palm and
then imagine the complete and total opposite. It's worth every penny.
