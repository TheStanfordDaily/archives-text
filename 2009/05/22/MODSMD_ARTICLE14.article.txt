# Bay to Breakers 2009
## 
### 
Since early in the year, rumors about Bay to Breakers get
ting ruined by new city regulations have circulated
through chain emails. Concerned groups debated if it
would be the same without the floats that tote kegs and ice
luges. While many were relieved about the proposed ban on
nudity, everyone was far more excited when the whole thing
got tossed. Officials still threatened to persecute visibly intoxi
cated participants, setting a warning that probably was war
ranted anyway.
This Sunday began like every other year... a 5:30 a.m.
wakeup call that requires extreme willpower to resist ignoring.
While many groups plan a theme, Stanford students tend to
represent the "rally gear" that is inevitably just something
thrown together. The 6 a.m. CalTrain was flooded with stu
dents who have left their yawns and grogginess back on cam-

pus. The hour-long train
ride was the biggest party
public transportation has
ever seen. Once the hoards
unloaded the train by the
AT&T Ballpark, everyone
followed the masses to the
starting line. With beers in
hand, cheering bystanders
threw tortillas at the seri
ous runners, reminding the
racers that most of the
60,000 people would be
cruising behind them.
Once the floats were
unleashed, the real "race"
began.
The classic costumcs, like
the group of salmon,
walked the 7.2 miles

upstream, inviting partici
pants to join them and spawn. This year, Somali pirates and
swine flu existed in multiple forms, reminding San Francisco
of the overlap of CNN headlines and pop culture. A group
dressed as the Great Wall of China strictly guarded mile four,
linking arms in a Red Rover fashion, challenging participants
to break through. Overall, the costumes served as a conversa
tion starter, as all the participants acted like old friends.
The steep hill of Hayes Street did not slow down the fun,
as bands and boomboxes filled the street, leading to block
wide belting of everything from Eddie Money's "Take Me
Home Tonight" to Earth, Wind & Fire's "My September."
Confetti fell from the sky, acting as a marker for the true pur
pose of the event: to celebrate San Francisco. Many did not
make it all the way to the end, as people started resting along

the grass in Golden Gate Park. This was especially true, as the
90-degree heat continued to climb. By mile five, the drink of
choice became water, as volunteers handed out the entire 1.5
liter bottles instead of Dixie cups. The biggest trick about mak
ing it to the breakers on the West side of the city was the trek
back to the CalTrain station by the bay. The ride home was
filled with photographers reviewing their finds and naps all
around.
Despite early panics about the changes of Bay to Breakers,
it was more fun than ever without the drama. Only two people
were cited for public urination, which, in a city like San
Francisco, is certainly a success.
