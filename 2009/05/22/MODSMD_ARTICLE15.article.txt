# The 						start of a hazardous love

### 
Upon arriving at 18th and Telegraph in Oakland
hours before the Decemberists concert, I was
shocked to see that there were a lot of people lined
up outside, waiting for the doors to open. I shuffled to my
place in the back of the line, checking out the crowd that
had showed up hours earlier than I did. There were parents
accompanying their excited middle school kids, Cal stu
dents, middle-aged women — overall a wide variety of peo
ple.
After standing in line for an hour, I realized that this is
an enormous venue, much bigger than the intimate stages
The Decemberists arc used to playing. The concert was also
sold out, which meant that there was going to be a huge
crowd. I paled at the thought of not being against the stage
at lead singer/songwriter Colin Meloy's feet, but when the
doors opened 1 was aggressive, winding up exactly where I
wanted to be.
Then there was even more waiting for the opening act
to come on stage. The theatre was buzzing with excitement,
as Oakland was just the second stop of the Short Fazed
1 lovel tour. After an hour, the opener, a group called Other
Lives, came on stage greeted with enthusiastic and encour
aging applause. The group performed an amazing set, high
lighted by a beautiful cello and haunting piano. Their music
sounded like a hodgepodge of genres, leading them to be clas
sified as "post-folk." They were very well-received by the audi
ence, but the most applause that they were given came once
lead singer Jesse Tabish said, "I'd like to say thanks to the
Decemberists for letting us come with them. They're amazing,
aren't thev?"

With that sentiment, Other Lives finished up their incred
ible set and left the stage, leaving The Decemberists to take the
grand stage. The back'drop was set up to look like the album
cover of their recent release, "Hazards of Love" (reviewed in
Intermission last April). Without any words to the audience,
the band began performing their whole rock opera continu
ously, not speaking or taking a break between songs. For those

unfamiliar with "Hazards of Love," it tells a complex story of
two star-crossed lovers that are unable to be together because
of an evil queen.
The band sounded incredible, with Colin Meloy's strange
ly endearing voice pealing out through the back of the the
atre, all the way up to the top of the balcony. Becky Stark, of
Lavender Diamond, performed the vocals of Margaret, the
woman in love. While Stark's voice was nothing if not ethere
al and beautiful, the guest star that stole the show was Shara
Worden of My Brightest Diamond, who sang the part of the
queen. Her low range powerhouse vocals, combined with
infectious stage presence, had the audience cheering louder
for her than the band itself.
After completing the entire album, the group took a short
break and came back onstage for another set of some of their
other hits. Playing songs like "Grace Cathedral Hill," "The
Crane Wife 3" and "O Valencia!" The Decemberists captivat
ed the audience for the entire second set. The group then
returned for an encore of hodgepodge tunes that the band
seemed to play just because they enjoyed playing them. As the
audience spilled out of the theatre, the refrain that Colin had
asked to stick kept playing in our heads, sweetly sung by his
strange voice — "Hear all the bombs fade away ..
