## A 						DISAPPOINTING "NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM"

Nowadays, it seems that the motion picture industry is
littered with hackneyed, uncreative adaptations and

the "un-losable key ring."

Battle of the Smithsonian," the follow-up to 2006s "Night at
the Museum," does nothing to alter this notion. Directed by
Shawn Levy (of "The Pink Panther" and "Cheaper by the

Dozen," both remakes that led to irrelevant sequels), "Battle of
the Smithsonian" struggles to overcome a profusion of prob
lems — namely tedious, unimaginative writing and the

omnipresence of contrived gags that are misses
far more often than they are hits.
In the first film, Ben Stiller, true to form,
plays an average guy, Larry Daley, who takes a

job as a security guard at the Museum of
Natural History in New York — only to dis
cover that the museum's exhibits spring to
life each night. This phenomenon is

explained by the presence of an ancient,
golden Egyptian tablet in the museum that
animates its inhabitants. In "Battle", Stiller
reprises his role as Daley, who now has
become an extremely successful inventor of

products such as the "glow-in-the-dark
flashlight," the "super-big dog bone" and

Yet feeling unfulfilled with his life (a theme painfully
traced throughout the film), Larry soon finds himself back at
the Museum of Natural History where he learns that many of

the exhibits he befriended in the first film, like the cowboy
Jedediah Smith (Owen Wilson), Roman general Octavius
(Steve Coogan) and Attila the Hun (Patrick Gallagher), are set
to be put in storage at the Smithsonian in Washington, D.C. —
where they will no longer be able to enjoy the benefits of the
magic tablet. To prevent this, one of the exhibits, a monkey,
steals the tablet and brings it to the Smithsonian, thus bring
ing all of its inhabitants to life and setting the plot of the film.
As Larry tries to help his friends retain their threatened vitali
ty, he must contend with the Egyptian King Kahmunrah
(Hank Azaria), who wants the tablet for himself in order to
take over the world, all the while coming to terms with himself.
Oh, and he also has to negotiate the romantic overtures of a
vivacious, self-assured Amelia Earhart (Amy Adams), whom
Levy pits against Stiller to accentuate his character's uncertain
ty and tentativeness. If this all seems formulaic — that's
because it is.
While the setting in the sequel has changed, the stale plot,
flat humor, and uninventive dialogue have not. Levy seems
intent upon revisiting stereotypical gimmicks throughout the
film. For instance, as if the conniving, slightly annoying, but
redeemably endearing monkey routine had not been exhaust
ed over ten years ago in "Dunston Checks In," Levy bombards
us with it. This includes borrowing a scene from the first
"Night at the Museum", where Stiller and the monkey engage


TWENTIETH CENTURY FOX
in slapping cach other in a back-and-forth that, unless you
are eight years old, becomes more frustratingly uncom
fortable by the second.
It is not as if "Battle at the Smithsonian" does not
boast a gifted cast. Aside from those already mentioned,
Robin Williams (Teddy Roosevelt), Christopher Guest
(Ivan the Terrible), Ricky Gervais and Bill Hader (General
George Custer) lend their considerable talents to the film.
Hader and Guest, in particular, transcend what is, for the
most part, overworked dialogue to provide amusing cari
catures of their respective historical figures. However, the
film's writing really does not do justice to this ensemble of
actors, many of whom must work awkwardly with lines
aimed at a younger audience.
Furthermore, Levy and company fall short in crafting
the magical world they aim to create. Much of this can be
attributed to a brutally formulaic narrative that Levy tries
to inflate with a series of amateur themes that would make
a sixth-grade book report seem erudite by comparison.
And while the film operates under a far-fetched, fantasti
cal premise that allows one to look past certain plot incon
sistencies (of which there are many), some are simply too
egregious to ignore — such as when Earhart flies Larry
from the Smithsonian to New York, undetected, in her
famous Lockheed Vega 5b plane, which evidently is still
equipped with fuel after all these years.
Ultimately, "Battle of the Smithsonian" is a children's
movie and I would not recommend the film for anyone
else. While Stiller can be counted tin to deliver a couple of
good laughs, "Battle" is just another rudimentary, manu
factured product off the assembly line that skirts logic and
intelligence all in the name of contrived comedy.
