The season finale of 30 Rock, "Kidney Now!" featured a star-studded cast of guest actors,
including Mary J. Blige, Elvis Costello, Sheryl Crow and Clay Aiken. The plot is simple: in
an effort to find a kidney for his biological father Milton Green (Alan Alda), Jack (Alec
Baldwin) calls in all of the favors he's owed to put together a musical fundraiser. While the
stars certainly provide a few good laughs, (example: Mary J. Blige says, "We all believe in
this cause so much we're doing this for free. Except Sheryl." Sheryl Crow's response is,
"That's right, I'm the only one getting paid."), 30 Rock is not a show that needs celebrity
help.
Tina Fey and Tracy Morgan keep the laughs rolling plenty well on their own.
Throughout the course of the episode, Liz (Fey), following Jack's advice, decides to "get
hers," and goes on a media blitz as a relationship expert based on a skit called "Deal
Breaker." Unfortunately, as Jack puts it, "Suburban 7th graders have more experience than
[she) does."

Meanwhile, in the episode's least funny thread, Tracy
fights his fears and returns to his high school to give a A

speech at graduation. Still, even this produces some
great one-liners (Tracy: "lust be yourself, and I

guarantee every single one of you will be
President of the United States.")

The show vaguely hints at what might
happen next season, but it's hard to distill-

guish between a real hint and a throwaway
joke. When Tracy gets an honorary high i

school diploma, he tells Grizz,
Dotcom, and Ken that they're all going <

to college. Meanwhile, Jack tells Liz
that TGS has two years left, max. 1

doubt that the show is really going to
drastically change along either of those

lines, but that doesn't mean 1 wouldn't
love to see it. All in all, this finale was a i

great way to top off one more great sea
son, so I'm committed to watching

anything they put into season four
