# Roxy's on a BOAT!
## 
### 
Campus heated up this past week! Besides the scorching
weather, last weekend played host to Stanford's annual par
ties "Exotic Erotic" and "Cowabunga." Needless to say, there
were plenty of reasons and chances to scratch that itch. But of
course, the question on all of your minds is: How did Roxy spend
her weekend? Roxy is pretty much over the traditional party scene,
and instead spent her Friday night ON A BOAT.
A common spring quarter staple among dorms is boat dance,
which essentially ends up being a booze cruise in San Francisco Bay.
Roxy loves boat dances because not only are they a great change of
pace to a stuffy frat house, but she gets to enjoy one of her favorite
kinds of men — seamen. There's nothing like rocking an already
rocking boat, enjoying all the seamen from all the semen. Hmm,
Roxy thinks she might have gotten that spelling mixed up.
But of course, getting your sail off on a boat is not as easy as it
sounds, and there are definitely right and wrong ways to go about
doing things, especially during a boat dance. First off, Roxy quickly
ignored all the other Stanford guys that were hitting on her. Roxy
can tap that any time of the week — tonight was all about the crew
members... and their members. The first man-candy that Roxy
targeted on the boat was the bartender. Roxy has her priorities
down, and knows that all it takes is a good quickie behind the bar to
get free drinks for the rest of the night. The beautiful thing about
bars is that the bartender can still make his drinks while I'm having
mine down below.
With the bartender's notch added to my legendary belt, Roxy's
next target was the First mate. Roxy spotted her cabin boy from

across the dance floor as

he was "observing" us,
making sure that we
are all safe as the waves
rocked the ship. Our
eyes locked, and the
next thing Roxy knew,

that cute first mate was
torpedoing her porthole
in one of the bathrooms.

After Roxy was all warmed up,
she decided to go for a hat trick — setting
her periscope on the ship's captain. Of

course Roxy believes in aquatic safety and would never want to dis
tract the captain from piloting the boat — a captain's duty does
come first after all. Roxy's favorite nautical rule is that the captain
always goes down with the ship. Since the ship wasn't going down,
she decided to instead. Roxy could tell the captain was enjoying his
time because he had to crash the boat into a couple of waves to hide

the rocking on the bridge.
Then Roxy's mission was complete. Once the ship docked on
dry land again, she quickly cleaned up all the ocean spray and joined
the rest of her land-lovers. Good thing Roxy didn't tell any of her
boat dance conquests that she's a pirate, or else they might have
made her walk their planks ... or climb the mast... or heaven for
bid, scrub the poop deck — which Roxy is not a huge fan of at all.
