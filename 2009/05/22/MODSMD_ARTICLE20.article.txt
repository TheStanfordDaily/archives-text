## Shall we kiss? 
### 
a Shall We Kiss?" opens with an invigorating lack of pream
ble. A woman asks a man on a street corner where she can
find a taxi, but he knows of none nearby. When the two
seem ready to part, he thinks better of walking away, and from
the time he walks back to her, the two stay together far later
into the night. Thev find themselves in a car, and the man,

Gabriel (Michael Cohen), asks the woman, Judith
(Virginie Ledoven), for a goodbye kiss. Gabriel is careful
and desiring, and Judith is interested and hesitant, but the
pull and tension of their conversation lies entirely outside
of their words. Their tone and their diction sound more
like two scientists discussing a theorem than two attrac
tive people expressing their attraction. It's the first, and
the most fascinating, of conversations in the film where
characters search for a way to control their feelings in the
sturdiness of calm words.
The energy of these first scenes flags somewhat over
the film's full running time, but the intrigue of how
events will resolve themselves lasts until the final frames.
Neither Judith nor Gabriel is single, but she explains to
him her reservations not by appeals to loyalty, but to
precedent; she has a storv wemhinu on her mind. She

then begins narrating the experiences of Emilie (Julie
Gayet) and Nicolas (Emmanuel Mouret), two friends who
wind up finding a kiss a far more complex thing than either of
them had expected. The film unfolds and increasingly inter
weaves the two pairings over the rest of its running time.
It's a very French concept for a very French movie. "Shall
We Kiss?" came out in Europe in 2007, as "Un baiser s'il vous
plait," but has only made it across the Atlantic recently. That on
its own will be enough to turn many away; those who can't
stomach the combination of wit and red wine — a perfectly
forgivable stance — should avoid this movie if at all possible.
For those with the taste for it, though, "Shall We Kiss?" offers a

charming viewing.
Perhaps its most "French" quality is its ■
unhurried pace, which provides a richness to j
much of the material, but which does strain the
viewer's patience. It's a 96-minute movie that feels
at least an hour longer. This happens as a result of

the film's structure, which writer-director Mouret (also acting
adeptly as Nicolas) stages as essentially a never-ending series of
conversations between two people. Even his camera-work feels
uncomfortable unless he has two characters in frame at the
same time. In the rare instances of close-ups, or the still
scarcer scenes with only one character, he makes sure to pair
and double with another of the same variety. The film is as
insecure in lingering on one person as some of its characters
are with their partners; yet with each successive tour-de-force
of restrained dialogue, the film comes closer to saying, and
finding, something profound about love and lovers' fleeting

understanding of it.
In a film so reliant upon scenes between two

people, individual performances don't call attention to
themselves, and rarely do the actors have to carrv a great
weight by themselves. You get the sense that thev could,

however, as the ensemble work i*- uniformly excellent.
Ledoyen finds herself handling the most complex material
as Judith, a narrator in many senses; but she rises excellent
ly to the occasion and is particularly stellar in handling the
film's bittersweet ending.

All in all, "Shall We Kiss?" is a sometimes-trying but alto
gether rewarding experience. It offers fine conversation and
charms you over and over with its small discoveries. In its
characters' attempts to find wisdom (and escape) in story
telling and formality, you can see much of what the film itself
offers: not solace, exactly, but a comfort. More films would do
well to have such modest aim — and to so patiently attain it.
