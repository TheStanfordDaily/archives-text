## "Dance Flick:" A failed parody 
### 
All you really need to know about Dance Flick is that it is
a Wayans brothers movie. If you have seen any of the
latest installments in their ongoing series of spoofs,
such as Little Man, White Chicks or Stviry Movie, then you
know what I'm talking about. From the cheap attempts at
humor all the way to the entire cast and "creative team," Dance
Flick is littered with the proverbial, lowbrow type of comedy
that has come to define the Wayans.
Operating on an absurd premise designed to parody any
number of recent Films, ranging from as far back as You Got
Served to Edward Scissorhands, Dance Flick, like all of the
Wayans' movies, is characterized by a painful — but not unex
pected — brand of comedy that is presented with all the sub
tlety of a Looney Tunes episode. For instance, in the first 10
minutes of the Film, a woman is crushed to death after being
hit consecutively by three different cars, a pregnant street
dancer graphically gives birth during a performance, a charac
ter named Ms. Cameltoe (Amy Sedaris) is introduced, and
Megan (Shoshana Bush), a naive white girl with aspirations of
participating in dance battles, applies blackface before going to
a club.
Officially directed by Damien Wayans in his directorial
debut, Dance Flick tells the story of Megan and Thomas Uncles
(Damon Wayans Jr.), a street dancer with an ambiguous sexu
al orientation, who team up to win a dance contest. Ultimately,
the plot — or rather, the compilation of scenes — is unimpor
tant. The Film, written by almost the entire Wayans family
(Keenen, Shawn, Marlon, Craig and Damien), parodies more
sincere competitive dance-themed movies like Step Up and
Save the Last Dance.

Herein lies the greatest problem with Dance Flick, apart
from the ostentatious humor. While the Wayans satirize the
admittedly contrived aspects of such by-the-book pictures, in
ironic fashion, they have similarly repressed to the same for-

mulaic level of the films they parody, wherein their

spoofs have become its own genre deserving of

parody. At one point during an altogether

uncreative and unoriginal musical num-

ber performed by lack (Brennan

Hillard) where he sings abor*

being gay, the Wayans

inevitably — even though /
everyone knows it's coming '
— throw in a blatant

Brokeback Mountain allusion,
thus proving that they are not

above reusing jokes that
arguably were never funny and,

worse yet, grew old about three
years ago. Furthermore, with the

whole movie consisting of transparent set
ups to agonizingly cliched punchlines, the

Wayans seem to live by the creed that if
something isn't funny the First time, then

perhaps repeating the same gimmick
throughout the film will elicit a different

response. In this case, it never does.
Perhaps the most alarming aspect of my

Dance Flick experience was that the audience
in the screening appeared to have a much

different take on the film, laughing uproariously throughout
the film's 83-minute run time and erupting into applause dur
ing the closing credits. The Wayans seem to depend upon a
demographic of viewers that don't mind watching a series of
endless gags tied together by any means. There might be some
thing redeemable about this concept if any of these gimmicks
were at all creative or did not rely on jokes involving uncom
fortably stupid slapstick, but this is not true of Dance Flick.
Clearly some people can endure, and even enjoy, a film that
finds box office success with a relentless stream of comedy

i involving farts, testicles and disfigured vaginas. For everyone
L else, Dance Flick is not for you.
