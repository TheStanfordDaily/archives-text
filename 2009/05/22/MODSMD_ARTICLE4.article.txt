# Near-flawless dancing heats up Cantor, but not as much as the weather
## 
### 
Last Sunday, the Stanford Dance Division presented
"Cantor 'Rewired,'" an imaginative fusion dance piece
that melded the classical Southeast Asian style of
Bharatanatyam with post-modern dance. Despite tempera
tures that soared well above 90 degrees, a substantial crowd
gathered to follow nine undergraduate dancers perform in,
around and through Cantor.
The choreography of "Rewired" came from New York
based choreographer and Stanford alumna Parijat Desai, who
spent winter 2009 on campus with an Institute for Diversity
and the Arts residency. During her residency, Desai also co
choreographed an installment in the Department of Drama's
"The Waste Land" series. Rehearsal director and Dance
Division lecturer Diane Frank arranged Desai's choreography
— originally intended for a trio of dancers — for the Cantor
grounds. The piece was cast in triplet, with three groups of
three dancers performing a unique subset of the choreography
and interacting with each other in a way that Frank described
as "like mathematics" or "a kaleidoscope." Vibrant jewel-toned
costumes in three colors further differentiated the flights of
dancers, and the interplay of colors added a satisfying visual
dimension to the piece.
The staging of the performance meandered from the front
steps of Cantor, through galleries, and to multiple lawns and
courtyards on the museum's grounds, with mixed results.
Dancers received extensive training in the Bharatanatyam
style, which demands extremely specific hand gestures and
percussive footwork, during the rehearsal process, and on the
Cantor lawns, long vistas and the rich green grass amplified
the effect of the subtle choreography, giving even the dancers'
slightest movements an epic quality. Inside the building, how
ever, bottlenecked crowds craning for a view of dancers and
multiple reprimands from museum security broke the sense of
mystery and wonder, which was so present in the outdoor seg
ments. Furthermore, placing dancers next to visual art does
not necessarily draw a parallel between the two, and the bare

foot, fluid dancers of "Rewired," who seemed perfectly in place
among manicured lawns, seemed incongruous within both the
"Pop to Present" and Rodin galleries inside the museum.
The stamina of the dancers and their ability to maintain
concentration while dancing barefoot and sometimes lying
down on sizzling concrete was frankly astonishing. Different
"permutations" of choreography featured subsets of dancers
performing in pairs or across color groups and in coordination
with the space around them. While it may be the heat talking,
several sections of the performance bordered on the repetitive
as the dancers cycled through choreography.
When viewing practitioners of tai chi or yoga, I often feel
that while there is clear admiration for the body control and
mindfulness of the practitioners, their movement is not for
entertainment. In the same way, the deliberate, methodical
structure of the "Rewired" choreography made the piece seem
almost like an exercise rather than a dance. In contrast to tra
ditional Bharatanatyam, in which dancers' movements convey
a mythic narrative, Desai intended to draw only technique and
"kinetic information" from the dance form, and use these to
"rewire" the movement of a dancer's body.
From artistic and pedagogic perspectives, such a focus on
new kinetics fits into a grander study of the body's capacity for
movement and, according to Frank, the search for "what is
innovative within ancient forms" like Bharatanatyam.
However, as an audience member with an appreciation for
dance but little formal training, I found myself struggling to
make an emotional connection to a performance that felt
extremely rational and academic.
On the other hand, "Rewired" should not be judged for
failing to be something which it never intended to be. As a site
specific work of fusion, "Rewired" intended to focus on struc
ture, both within the dancers' movements and in the sur
rounding architecture, and it succeeded at pulling elements of
Bharatanatyam's punctuated style into a very modern staging.
While not exactly a piece for the masses, nearly flawless execu-

tion from an immensely talented group of dancers made
"Rewired" a meaningful addition to the Stanford dance calen
dar.
