# Finales A LOOK BACK AT THE SEASON'S END
## Fringe 
### 
Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI), paranormal science, bioterrorism, FBI action, a kick-ass
female lead, a new-age science manifesto with creepily religious undertones and conspiracy the
ories — throw all that together and you've got Fringe, denominated by creator J.J. Abrams as the
easier-to-follow counterpart to critically-acclaimed Lost. This first season of Fringe introduces
Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv), an FBI agent, and her sidekicks Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) and
his father/brilliant scientist Walter Bishop (John Noble) as they investigate a series of paranor
mal/fringe experiments taking place all around the world, collectively called "The Pattern."
While the show was a bit slow at the beginning, it really picks up later in the season. The
first season sets up the complex world and theories that is the Fringe universe. But if the first
season was the set-up, then the second will really dive into development and getting to know
the enemy for the Fringe team. The season finale ended on a cliffhanger, with Olivia traveling

for the first time to a parallel universe to meet William Bell (Leonard Nimoy — that's right,
Spock!). In that parallel universe, Dunham and Bell meet in the twin towers, which were not
destroyed by the 9/11 attacks. A glimpse at the newspaper suggests that the White House was
destroyed instead. And if you pay careful attention, there is no Statue of Liberty. There are infi
nite possibilities for this alternative universe (universes?).
Abrams has confirmed that season two will be faster and more thrilling than the first. While
the theories of MWI may be nothing new, I'm sure Abrams and Co. will find a new way to
explore this concept and the unravel the mystery behind the characters in an interesting way. I,
for one, am eager to keep watching.
