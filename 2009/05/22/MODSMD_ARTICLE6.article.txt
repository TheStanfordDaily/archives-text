# The 						Office
## 
### 
The fifth season of NBC's "The Office" wrapped up
last Thursday with a lot of warm, fuzzy feelings and
surprisingly few cliffhangers. It felt more like watch
ing an old episode of "Friends" without the laugh
track. That being said, one can't help but love it.
"Company Picnic" starts with another stellar prank
from Jim, though this time the joke is on Michael,
and everyone (even Dwight!) is in on it. The episode
then departs from the usual stuffy office setting as the
characters attend Dunder Mifflin's annual company
picnic.
Michael makes a blunder at the picnic by reveal
ing that the Buffalo branch was closing. Yet, in his
reunion with Holly, he is surprisingly sweet and
chooses not to make a move on her. Scranton branch
unites against corporate (in their ominous matching
black t-shirts) in an epic volleyball game. Pam,

injured at the game, is rushed to the hospital with Jim
where the big news of the episode is revealed as soon
as the nurse asks, "Any chance you're pregnant?" The
camera lurks outside the hospital room, and although
we can't hear the conversation, viewers can see
through the blinds as the doctor informs them of
Pam's pregnancy, leading to another adorable Pam
and Jim moment.
"Company Picnic" could easily have been the
end of the entire "Office" series. Everyone's favorite
couple is blissful, Michael seems to finally be safe in
his job, and even Dwight is getting along with the
group. The show's writers are going to have a tricky
time creating tension next season.
