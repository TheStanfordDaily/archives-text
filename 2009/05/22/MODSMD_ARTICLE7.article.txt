And after another 24 hours, Jack
Bauer can finally go to sleep (and go
to the bathroom. Seriously, is that
what he does during commercial
breaks?) Season seven of "24" has cer
tainly had its ups and downs, but as it
reaches its conclusion, this will stand
as one of the best seasons of the show.
While it did not have the incredible
originality and vitality of the first sea
son or the tension of the fifth season,
it was solid from start to finish, delv
ing into Jack's humanity more than
any other season.
By taking away CTU, Jack is
forced to confront the actions of his
past. This is symbolized, in particular,
by his relationship with FBI agent
Renee Walker. While she initially
serves as his foil, chastising him for
his torturous ways, she is slowly
pulled into his dark and twisted
world where the ends justify the
means. This comes to a climax in the
final scene of the season, where she
gives up her career to obtain vital
information coercively from a crimi
nal who would otherwise walk free. It
is a testament to Renee's arc over the
season how unsettling this scene was
to watch.
It's unfortunate that Jack's story
line at the close of the season was not
as exciting as Renee's. He does have
some pulse-pumping moments of his
own, though. The scene when he
escapes from the operating table
using only a small knife is particular
ly exhilarating. As a whole, putting
lack on his death bed from his expo
sure to the weaponized bio-agent
took away one of the show's main
assets — the raw power of lack Bauer

as a character. Hopefully, he will be
back to fighting form next season
after a last-minute stem cell treatment
from his daughter, Kim (whose story
line was nowhere near as ridiculous as
ones in previous seasons. Random
cougar, I'm looking at you). Tony
Almeida, thankfully, receives some
closure towards the end when he
reveals his true motivations: revenge
for his fallen wife. This serves as a nice
bit of resolution to explain, at least to
a partial degree, why the character
seemed to flip sides every other
episode. All in all, this season had all
of the traditional tension, anxiety,
and racing against the clock that
makes "24" such a compelling televi
sion drama.
