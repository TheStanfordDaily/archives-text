# Gossip Girl

lor almost two years now, The CW's hit show "Gossip Girl" has been a guilty pleasure of mine.
This fairly lengthy relationship started with a bang: "Gossip Girl" gave me cheap thrills that 1
hadn t experienced for years — ever since the troubled teen Ryan Atwood moved into Orange
County. Gossip Girl gave me a spark, a light, when 1 was beginning to give up on the teen
drama. Gossip Girl" was good to me, and I was good to "Gossip Girl." Just several weeks into
the first season, 1 found myself backing the show up as friends called it names. I protected it,
watched it grow ... and "Gossip Girl" gave back to me.
Season One quickly went by and the wait for Season Two was almost unbearable. Then
finally, one fateful Monday, it came back to me. The characters were all back together after a
summer separated. I he back and forth, on-and-off love between Blair and Chuck was almost
immediately revisited (and unfortunately, visited again and again all season long). Nate
Archibald, struggling for money, is accepting cash for sex from a much older, married woman.
Dan and Serena are together, then they aren t, and then they are again. Season Two certainly
looked promising.
Sadly, I was completely wrong about the future of "Gossip Girl." All season, the show con
tinued to spiral into a complete mess, with terrible writing, nonsensical plotlines, flat acting
ar, d—g as P —bad hair. As the show got more and more ludicrous, my disdain for wasting an
hour of my life grew. Finally, the season finale approached, and I made a pact — if this episode
was as crappy as the rest of the season, I would not be back for Season Three.
Unfortunately, it was just as terrible as the rest. It's graduation time on the Upper East Side,
and for some reason, Serena goes completely dramatic and decides to uncover the identity of
Gossip Girl. This leads to a murder mystery element, where everybody is suspicious of each
other. As tensions mount, friendships look as though they are destroyed. For the millionth time,
Chuck rejects Blair's love, and her heart is broken. Jenny Flumphrey decides to throw her hat
into the ring for the new Queen Bee (who really takes high school that seriously?) and is told to
come up with the juiciest piece of gossip to be crowned. As painfully skinny and horribly styled

Little J finds Blair at her weakest in the bathroom, she appeals for the crown. Blair tells her woe
fully, "You can't make people love you, but you can make them fear you." This line is delivered
with such ridiculous intensity that it's hard not to laugh at how completely lame this show is.
By the end of the season finale, the only elements that I felt at peace with were the engagement
of Lily and Rufus, and the coupling of Blair and Chuck (finally!), but I doubt that will last for
long.
For those of you who disagree with me and think this season was television genius, fret not.
The writers worked it out so that most of your favorite characters are at NYU for college, so
more mishaps can take place, only now it's collegiate style. As for me, 1 won't be watching.
"Gossip Girl" is like crack — if you aren't already hooked, don't try it. And if you are, it's prob
ably best for your health to wean off slowly.
XOXO, Intermission.
