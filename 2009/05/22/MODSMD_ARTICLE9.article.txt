# Grey's Anatomy
## 
### 
"Grey's Anatomy" has had a shaky run in the past cou
ple of years. Thankfully, season five brought the show
back to its roots: good, old-fashioned melodrama. This
season focused strongly on the individual lives of the
characters, paying more attention to the emotions
rather than the surgeries.
The show's ability to punch you in the emotional
gut could not be more pronounced than in the season's
latter episodes leading up to this two-hour finale. With
Meredith and Derek's pending wedding as well as
Izzie's constant struggle with cancer, viewers were on
edge going into the finale. The first hour of the finale,
"Here's to Future Days," focused on Izzie's decision to
undergo a hazardous brain surgery at the risk of mem
ory loss. The rest of the characters had their own sur
geries and problems to deal with — most notably
Cristina and Owen's up-and-down relationship.
Highlights included Izzie asking George for surgical
advice and Alex trying to convince Izzie to tear up the
DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) form that she had just
signed. The first hour ended with Izzie choosing the
surgery and George deciding to join the army — by far
the episode's biggest surprise.

The second half, "Now or Never," took all the ten
sion and emotion from the first half, and doubled it.
After Izzie's surgery, we discovered that she lost her
short-term memory, forcing Alex help her recover it.
Meanwhile, the other characters were kept occupied
with a John Doe trauma case and efforts to convince
George to not join the army. The show's most memo
rable and emotional moments flooded the final 10
minutes of the episode, barely giving viewers time to
react: John Doe was in fact George, and both Izzie and
George tell upon deaths doorstep, leaving viewers
guessing as to which characters will survive until next
season.
The "Grey's Anatomy" season finale succeeded on
multiple levels. Besides making viewers shed tears (or
flat-out cry), the show also succeeded in marking sig
nificant developments for several characters. Meredith
and Derek are entering married life, Bailey is leaving
her husband, Cristina and Owen are back together and
Izzie and George are.. . dead? Needless to say, the
show's writers have a lot of material to work with next
season.
